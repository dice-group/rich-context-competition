    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis study evaluated the Beliefs about Medicine Questionnaire to explore adherence to adjuvant endocrine therapy after\ntreatment for breast cancer (BMQ-AET). Factor structure of the BMQ-AET was explored alongside internal consistency,\nconvergent validity and acceptability. The BMQ-AET Specific Scale fitted the original 10 item model. Internal consistency\nof the BMQ-AET was much improved compared to the original BMQ and convergent validity showed predicted direction\nof correlation, although correlation with BMQ-AET concerns scale was low. Acceptability was good. The evaluation of\nthe BMQ-AET is encouraging, and could facilitate future research around adherence to AET.\n",

Investigating women's\nbeliefs about endocrine therapies is crucial to explore their\nperception of risk and perception of benefit from taking the\nmedication and develop interventions to improve adherence.\nThe Beliefs about Medicine Questionnaire (BMQ) has\nbeen tested in a wide variety of patient populations and is a\nvalid and reliable measure of medication beliefs (Horne\nand Weinman, 1999). A recent meta-analytic review reports\nthat across studies, higher adherence was associated with\nstronger perceptions of necessity of treatment (odds ratio\nremained significant when data were stratified by study\nsize, the country in which the research was conducted and\nthe type of adherence measure used (Horne et al., 2013).\nWhile it has been used to assess the beliefs and perceptions\nof women taking endocrine therapy after breast cancer\npsychometric evaluation of this measure for this population\nhas been reported.\nThe BMQ-AET adapted wording of the BMQ-Specific\nConcerns and BMQ-Specific Necessity items to be more\nrelevant to women taking AET following breast cancer.\nThis study aims to evaluate the factor structure, internal\nconsistency and acceptability of the BMQ-AET-Specific\nscale in a sample of women-prescribed AET for breast\ncancer.\nMethods and procedures\nDesign\nA cross-sectional study was carried out to explore women's\nexperiences ofAET.As part of this study, women completed\nthe BMQ-AET within a self-report postal questionnaire.\nSample\nParticipants included women aged 36\u00ad85years taking AET\nfollowing treatment for breast cancer. These women had\npreviously participated in the Joint Aches Cohort Study\n(JACS) looking at women's experiences of joint aches,\npain and stiffness in breast cancer (Fenlon et al., 2014).\nDuring JACS, participants were asked to indicate their\nwillingness to participate in future studies; we re-\napproached only this subsample for this adherence study.\nAll participants had been diagnosed with primary oestro-\ngen-receptive positive breast cancer and had been pre-\nscribed AET. Exclusion criteria included women with more\nadvanced cancer, women seriously ill with other conditions\nand women who had a poor comprehension of English.\nProcedure\nEthical approval was gained from the University Research\nEthics Committee (UREC). Informed consent was gained,\nand postal questionnaires were sent out in July 2014, with a\nreminder sent after 3\nweeks of non-response. Participants\ntook approximately 20\nminutes to complete the question-\nnaire, which include a range of nominal and multiple-\nchoice questions asking about their experiences of taking\nAET and two scales: the Medical Adherence Rating Scale\n(MARS; Thompson et al., 2000) and the BMQ-AET-\nSpecific scales.\nMeasures\nThe Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ) was\noriginally developed to aid understanding of people's per-\nception of medicine regimes and to help understand adher-\nence to medication. It is an 18-item self-report measure of\nbeliefs about medicine (Horne and Weinman, 1999) derived\nfrom a pool of items representing commonly held beliefs\nabout medication in a chronic illness sample (Asthmatic,\nCardiac, Diabetic, Renal, Psychiatric, and General; Horne\nitems) beliefs were analysed separately. The measure com-\nprises two sections, each divided into two subscales. The\nBMQ Specific comprises two five-item subscales: the\n`Specific Necessity' subscale (i.e. beliefs about the neces-\nsity of taking that specific medication to remain healthy)\nand the `Specific Concerns' subscale (i.e. concerns about\nthe negative effects of taking that specific medication). The\nBMQ-General comprises two 4-item subscales assessing\nbeliefs that medicines are harmful which should not be\ntaken continuously (General-Harm) and that medicines are\noverused by doctors (General-Overuse). All items of the\nBMQ are rated on a 5-point likert scale where 1 represents\nstrongly agree and 5 represents strongly disagree. Scores\nobtained for the individual items are summed to give a total\nscore for each subscale, and the two sections of the BMQ\ncan be used in combination or separately.\nTable 1 identifies the modifications made to the original\nBMQ for the BMQ-AET. The term `hormone treatment' is\nused instead of AET, as the former is a more recognised\nterminology for this treatment among women. Changes\nwere made in consultation with service users and the expert\nadvisory team for this study that included a breast cancer\nsurgeon, an oncologist, a general practitioner (GP), a health\npsychologist, a professor of cancer nursing and a medical\nsociologist. Most items had minor changes to make the\nitems relevant to the population. However, the item `my life\nwould be impossible without medicines' was changed to\n`taking hormone treatment makes me feel I am taking\nBrett et al. 3\npositive steps to remain well' because AET is not taken by\nwomen to reduce side effects of a condition, but to reduce\nthe risk of recurrence of breast cancer and is therefore not\nrelevant to this population.AET can often cause side effects\nthat make it difficult to continue with the treatment, and\ntherefore, adherence is more related to taking personal con-\ntrol to avoid the return of a condition rather than controlling\na pre-existing condition; this factor was not covered else-\nwhere and so deemed a relevant replacement item.\nService users from Independent Cancer Patients' Voice\n(n=2), cancer experts (n=4), and a representative from the\ncharity Breast Cancer Care evaluated the face validity of\nthe modified items during the development of the question-\nnaire, with minor adjustment to the final wordings made to\nensure comprehension. As items on the General beliefs\nsubscale are not condition specific, it was not necessary to\namend wording.\nThe Medical Adherence Report Scale (MARS-5)\n(Thompson et al., 2000) assesses adherence to treatment\nand was used to provide a measure of convergent validity\nwith the BMQ-AET. The MARS-5 consists of five general\nstatements about suboptimal adherence behaviour (I forget\nto take my AET medicine, I alter the dose of my AET medi-\ncine, I stop taking my AET medicine for a while, I decide to\nskip one of my AET tablets and I take AET less than pre-\nscribed) answered on a 5-point scale where 1 represents\n`always' and 5 represents `never'. Items were not summed\nbut used individually in determining types of adherence\nand non-adherence.\nAnalysis\nCOnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health\nMeasurement INstruments (COSMIN) were used in the selec-\ntion of evaluation methods for the analysis (Mokkink et al.,\n2010). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using direct\noblimin rotation was used to explore the factor structure of the\nmodified measure. PCA was chosen over factor analysis\nbecause it offers a more pragmatic psychometric solution,\nreducing the number of observed variables to a smaller num-\nber of components (factors) which account for most of the\nobserved variance, thus avoiding some of the potential prob-\nlems of factor interdependency which are associated with\nother types of psychometric scale development methods\n(Bartholomew et al., 2002). Furthermore, this method mirrors\nthat used in the development and evaluation of the original\nBMQ (Horne and Weinman, 1999), and it was our intention to\nbe able to compare across these two versions.\nThe resultant factors were subjected to internal consist-\nency testing using Cronbach's alpha tests. Convergent\nvalidity was explored by comparing correlation between\nthe BMQ-AET and MARS; due to non-parametricity of\nMARS data, Spearman's correlation tests were used.\nAcceptability was examined by exploring missing data\nand floor/ceiling effects, and face validity was assessed\nthrough discussions with service users and clinicians dur-\ning the development stage of the questionnaire.\nResults\nQuestionnaires were returned by 211 women (73%), all of\nwhom completed the BMQ-AET scale and 206 completed\nthe MARS. The socio-demographic characteristics and\nhealth status of responders are summarised in Table 2.\nFactor analysis\nStandard diagnostic tests were run to ensure that the data\nwere suitable for factor analysis. Both the Kaiser\u00adMeyer\u00ad\nOlkin (KMO\n=\n.791) test of sampling adequacy and\nBartlett's test of sphericity (p=<.001) indicated that the\ncurrent data were indeed appropriate.\nTable 1.

More recent\npractice has also been to consider a Parallel Analysis\nMonte Carlo simulation (using randomly generated data)\nto verify the number of required factors (Velicer et al.,\nwhich employs an upper bound of the 95\nper cent CI for\neigenvalues, averaging across 100 random data sets, this\nprocedure confirmed that two resultant factors were\nappropriate.\nTable 3 shows the factor structure matrix (with Kaiser\nnormalisation) resulting from the principle components\nanalysis; this accounted for 56.936 of the total variance\n(individual factor variances also indicated). Where items\nloaded onto multiple factors, they were retained only for\nthe factor onto which they loaded most strongly.\nTable 2.

Only one\nitem loaded with a very low factor loading (`Hormone\ntreatment is a mystery to me') with the remainder meeting\nloading item was included in the final measure as removing\nthis item did not improve overall psychometric properties\nof the scale, so it was retained to uphold the original struc-\nture of the measure.\nInternal consistency\nCronbach's alpha's statistics provide an indication of how\nwell items within a given scale are measuring a similar and\nstable construct. Typically, subscales with a Cronbach's\nalpha of less than .7 are considered inadequate; however,\nCortina (1993) notes that the method of calculating this sta-\ntistic is biased by item numbers whereby factors on a scale\nwith fewer items tend usually to produce a lower alpha\ncoefficient as a bi-product of the statistical calculation\n(Cortina, 1993). As our two subscales of specific beliefs\nnecessity, respectively; even when bearing in mind\nCortina's caution (which is relevant given that only 5 items\nappear in each subscale), these two scales exceed the usual\ncut-off for acceptability reliability. These figures are\naligned with, and in some cases exceed, those reported in\nthe confirmatory factor analysis reported by Horne and\nConvergent validity\nThe MARS is a self-report scale of adherence to medica-\ntion and so provided an adequate measure of convergent\nvalidity for these data, whereby we would anticipate a neg-\native correlation between both specific concerns and adher-\nence and a positive correlation between specific necessity\nbeliefs and adherence. Correlations tests indicated a signifi-\ncant correlation between higher treatment necessity beliefs\n(BMQ-AET Specific Necessity) and greater adherence\n(MARS) scores (rs\nbetween BMQ-AET Specific Concerns and MARS, while\nshowing the expected direction of association (higher treat-\nment concern beliefs correlated with lower adherence\nscores), failed to reach statistical significance (rs\nAcceptability\nAcceptability of the two individual scales was determined\nby examining the rate of missing responses to each item, as\nthis provides an indicator of how acceptable the instrument\nis in a given population (Fitpztrick et al., 1998). The BMQ-\nAET was completed by all 211 respondents, with only 5\ncases having missing responses for one or more items.\nFloor and ceiling effects (i.e. the percentage scoring the\nminimum and maximum score) were examined for the\nBMQ-AET Specific Concerns and the BMQ-AET Specific\nNecessity. The Specific Concerns scale had a 3.4\nper cent\nceiling effect and a 1\nper cent floor effect; The Specific\nNecessity had a 0per cent ceiling effect and a 8.7per cent\nfloor effect. As a proportion of up to 15per cent can be con-\nsidered a low effect (Terwee et al., 2007), the data show\nacceptable ceiling and floor effects.\nDiscussion\nThe BMQ-AET was included in a questionnaire survey to\nexplore women's experiences and views of taking AET to\nidentify factors that may be associated with adherence or\nnon-adherence.

The BMQ was modified so the\nwording was suitable to women who were taking AET. The\nevaluation of the BMQ-AET showed a similar factor struc-\nture to the original BMQ-Specific subscale (Horne and\nWeinman, 1999), and we report good internal consistency,\nencouraging convergent validity and good acceptability\nwithin this sample. The modified scale may therefore pro-\nvide a valuable assessment of women's specific beliefs\naround AET.\nThe results show that all factors had sufficient factor\nloading to be included, and therefore, the original factor\nstructure proposed by Horne and Weinman (1999) was\nretained. This is an important finding as it suggests that\nthe factors represent `core themes' underpinning com-\nmon representations of Specific Beliefs in this population\nwhich may generalise out to other specific condition\ngroups. One item `my life would be impossible without\nmedicines' was changed to `taking hormone treatment\nmakes me feel I am taking positive steps to remain well'\nbecause AET is not taken by women to reduce side effects\nof a condition, but to reduce the risk of recurrence of\nbreast cancer and is therefore not relevant to this new\npopulation. AET can often cause side effects that make it\ndifficult to continue with the treatment and therefore\nadherence is more related to taking personal control to\navoid the return of a condition rather than controlling a\npre-existing condition. Although the meaning of the item\nis slightly different, our psychometric analysis of the\nscale demonstrates that the new item is still correlated\nwith the other cluster items within the factor group. As\nsuch we would suggest that while the new item represents\nsome deviation, it is both a pragmatic and psychometri-\ncally valid alternation to make the scale relevant to this\npatient population.\nOther studies have reported similar findings in primary\ncare, general medical populations, and mental health popu-\nlations in the United Kingdom and across cultures (Browne\nthis study, the only exception to this was the item `Hormone\ntreatment is a mystery to me' and so this may require some\nfurther investigation in future uses of the scale. Internal\nconsistency exceeded that reported by Horne in the original\nevaluation of the measure, which has also been reported in\nother patient populations, including Stroke and Asthma\nindicating the generalisability of the BMQ (Horne and\nresults reported good completion rates, acceptable ceiling\nand floor effects. Face validity of the modified scale was\nconfirmed prior to completion of the questionnaire through\nconsultation with service users and health professionals in\nthe advisory group for this study.\nCorrelation between BMQ-AET-specific subscales and\nMARS was in the predicted direction, although only the\nassociation between treatment necessity beliefs and\nadherence reached significance. The low correlation between\ntreatment concern beliefs and adherence may have been due\nto the subjective nature of capturing non-adherence on self-\nreported measures such as the MARS. Correlation with\nobjective measures, such as pill counts, may provide a better\ngold standard in future studies. A recent meta-analysis\nreported significant correlation between both Concerns and\nNecessity in 33 and 31 studies correlating with MARS\n(Horne et al., 2013). However, they concluded that stratify-\ning by long-term condition and adherence measurement\nrevealed a need for further studies using objective measures\nin longer term conditions to ensure greater accuracy of meas-\nuring non-adherence long-term. Furthermore, a larger study\nmay have given greater power to the study at which point we\nmay expect these effects to more likely reach statistical sig-\nnificance cut-offs.Afurther meta-analysis exploring associa-\ntions between the BMQ and different measures of medical\nadherence concluded that they were correlated at a popula-\ntion level and across the majority of included conditions\nThis work is based on a self-selected sample that may\nhave presented response bias. The majority of the sample\nwere white Caucasians, so may not be generalisable to eth-\nnic minority groups. While this study reports a correlation\nbetween the modified BMQ-specific subscales and MARS\nin the predicted direction, more studies, possibly with larger\nsamples, may improve the statistical power to gain signifi-\ncance in both the BMQ-AET Necessity and the BMQ-AET\nConcerns. Further confirmatory factor analysis is also\nadvised to ensure that this factor structure is retained across\nmultiple samples with less exploratory methods of statisti-\ncal modelling. Additional studies investigating the psycho-\nmetric properties of BMQ in other settings and populations\nmay be beneficial to confirm our finding that suggests\nbeliefs provide `core themes' which are not necessarily\npopulation specific.\nIn conclusion, the BMQ-AET for women-prescribed\nAET following breast cancer has good internal consistency,\nencouraging convergent validity and good acceptability for\nthe Specific Beliefs about the necessity of and concerns\nregarding taking AET, and could facilitate future research\nin this field. Women are prescribed AET between 5 and\nyears after completion of primary cancer treatment\nadherence over the entire course is generally low, with con-\nsequent increased risk of cancer recurrence and mortality\ning to AET need to be investigated at an individual and\npopulation level. The BMQ-AET evaluated in this article\ncould facilitate a better understanding of factors which\naffect adherence to AET following breast cancer, to help\ndevelop interventions to support patients in engaging with\nthis treatment and coping with the challenging side effects\nthat might result.\nBrett et al. 7\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nATAC Group (2008) Effect of Anastrozole and tamoxifen as\nadjuvant treatment for early-stage breast cancer: 100 month\nanalysis of the ATAC trial.
