    "abstract": "Abstract\nHospital executives are key stakeholders in the hospital setting. However, despite extensive medical and nursing literature on\nthe importance of end-of-life (EOL) care in hospitals, little is known about hospital executives' perceptions of the provision of\nEOL care in their facilities. The objective of this study was to capture hospital executives' perceptions of the provision of EOL\ncare in the hospital setting. This descriptive, naturalistic phenomenological, qualitative study utilized in-person interviews to\nexplore executives' opinions and beliefs. The sample consisted of 14 individuals in the roles of medical center directors, chiefs\nof staff, chief medical officers, hospital administrators, hospital risk managers, and regional counsel in Arkansas, Louisiana\nand Texas. An interview guide was developed and conducted utilizing a global question followed by probes concerning\nperceptions of EOL care provision. Hospital executives acknowledged that EOL care was a very important issue, and more\nattention should be paid to it in the hospital setting. Their comments and suggestions for improvement focused on (a) current\nEOL care, (b) barriers to changing EOL care, and (c) enhancing provision of EOL care in the hospital setting. The findings of\nthis study suggest that hospital executives although key change agents, may have insufficient EOL information to implement\nsteps toward cultural and infrastructural change and should therefore be included in any EOL discussions and education.\n",

This qualitative\nmethod allowed us to explore executives' opinions and\nbeliefs more fully than might have been possible with other\napproaches.\nOverview and Setting\nWe recruited hospital executives, as they are the stakeholders\nwho have control over the availability, accessibility, and qual-\nity-of-health services and provide the environment in which\nphysicians, nurses, and other caregivers can practice EOL care\neffectively and efficiently from the Veterans Health\nAdministration (VHA) and community medical centers in\nArkansas, Louisiana, and Texas. University and VHA institu-\ntional review board approvals were obtained prior to the study.\nWe obtained written consent and addressed privacy protection\nwith participants prior to conducting the interviews.\nData Collection\nAn interview guide was developed based on the literature\nand consultation with a qualitative expert, the fourth author\n(J.C.M.), and a health services expert, the seventh author\n(J.E.K.). Questions were pre-tested with two executives and\nwere found sufficient to evoke responses that included the\nexecutives' perceptions of EOL care in their institution. All\ninterviews were conducted by the first author (K.K.G.) in\nparticipants' facilities. The interview began with a global\nquestion followed by probes (Morse & Field, 1995) concern-\ning his or her perceptions of EOL care provision. Interviews\nlasted 0.75 to 1.5 hr and were audio recorded, transcribed\nverbatim, and verified for accuracy. Hospital executives not\nemployed in the VHA system received a US$50 check for\nparticipation.\nData Analysis\nTranscripts were entered into Atlas-ti (Version 5.2, Scientific\nSoftware Development, Berlin), a text-based data manage-\nment program that allows data labeling and sorting by identi-\nfied variables. The interview data were coded using content\nanalysis, as described by Morse and Field (Morse & Field,\n1995) in which a systematic, objective analysis of message\ncharacteristics are identified, with constant comparison, or\ncontinual analysis of data by comparing one interview to\nanother, in an iterative process (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). The\nfirst author coded the initial three interviews, developed ten-\ntative definitions for each code, and prepared a preliminary\ncodebook, and then the seventh author reviewed the code-\nbook and transcripts. Emerging codes and coding differences\nwere discussed until consensus was reached. The first author\nrepeated this process with all interview narratives, compar-\ning one to the next, and coded the remaining interviews.\nNarratives were aggregated by similarity, forming categories\nfrom the aggregates, and developing overarching themes of\nthe perceptions of the executives. After 14 interviews, con-\nsiderable repetition of data was identified, indicating data\nSeveral techniques were used to maximize the validity\nand reliability of the study, following guidelines for trust-\nworthiness for qualitative studies (Lincoln & Guba, 1985).\nDependability was enhanced through the use of one inter-\nviewer (K.K.G.) and one interview guide for all interviews.\nIn addition, verbatim transcription and thoroughly reviewing\nthe transcripts against the recorded interviews ensured valid-\nity. The first author enhanced credibility and confirmability\nby keeping a detailed audit trail of coding, theoretical deci-\nsions, and consensus with the health services expert.\nUnedited examples of narrative were used to validate find-\nings. The separate coding by the two authors yielded strong\nResults\nSubjects\nThe sample consisted of 14 individuals in the roles of medi-\ncal center directors, chiefs of staff, chief medical officers,\nhospital administrators, hospital risk managers, and regional\ncounsel in Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas. These executives\nwere responsible for services provided by hospitals with a\nexecutives were male. There were 8 VHA (57.1%) and 6\ncommunity (42.9%) medical centers represented from met-\nsure of the executives' identity, no further information about\nthe hospitals and locations is provided.\nIt was widely acknowledged by the executives that EOL\ncare was a very important issue and more attention should be\npaid to it in the hospital setting. Their comments focused on\n(a) current EOL care, (b) barriers to changing EOL care, and\n(c) enhancing provision of EOL care in the hospital setting.\nCurrent EOL Care\nAll the participants described EOL care as an important con-\ncern for hospital executives; yet they gave different reasons\nfor its importance. For some, a major concern was the lack of\npreparation that patients and families had regarding their\nprospective needs for EOL care. The executives noted that\nvery serious and chronically ill patients arrived at the hospi-\ntal without clearly defined goals of care and with potentially\nunrealistic expectations for what the hospital was going to be\nable to do for them. One executive said,\nI mean you get patients here who are very sick and who may\nhave a low chance of survival to begin with, you get patients\nGarner et al. 3\nwho are here thinking they're coming to the \"Mecca\" and they're\nfinally going to get the you know [the] \"savior\" that they've not\nbeen able to get somewhere else . . . and quite frankly that can be\nmore than somewhat of a challenge . . .. (Interview 8)\nSeveral executives expressed concern about the current\npractice of avoiding or shifting EOL decision making to\npatients and families who had little preparation and often low\nliteracy or personal barriers to making these difficult and\ncomplex decisions. Another hospital executive said,\nPhysicians shift a lot of burden to families . . . especially when\nthe physician doesn't want to make a decision. And my basic\nthought on that is that it's the physician's job, that's not generally\nleft to lay people. (Interview 12)\nBecause of current organizational and system processes,\nhealth care providers frequently have little to no long-term\nrelationships with patients or their caregiver/families.\nAnother executive noted,\n[The lack of a long-term relationship] is exacerbated by\nhospitalists and intensivists and all these different roles, which\nmake a lot of sense . . . to have critical care people at the bedside\n. . . What it now means though is when you're at your sickest\nyou're probably with somebody you know you've never met,\nyour family's never met, you know . . .. (Interview 2)\nBarriers to Change\nThese hospital executives pointed to several difficulties in\nproviding quality EOL care in the hospital setting. Personnel\nshortages in all areas of health care were frequently men-\ntioned as barriers to effective EOL care. Lack of time to ade-\nquately discuss EOL care with patients and families was also\nfrequently cited. The executives noted the significant amount\nof time such discussions take and the increasing need for\nthese discussions along with ongoing shortages of health\ncare providers. In addition, many of the executives felt that\nhealth care providers, even if they had adequate staffing and\nwere willing to engage in an EOL care discussions, did not\nhave the training to do so. One executive said,\nWe don't have enough physicians to do that with the elderly . . .\nI mean golly there's so few physicians who are trained in that\narea or have an interest in it, we have one physician that is very\ngood at these discussions . . . but it takes so much of her time and\nshe's patient and willing, but we don't have many physicians\nlike that. (Interview 7)\nAnother executive with medical training noted that it was\nmost difficult to have discussions with patients at the EOL\nwho expected treatment but for whom current medical treat-\nments would not be effective. He explained,\nYou know . . . I grew up in an environment where I had to learn,\nlearn, learn, but I never learned how to talk to somebody where\nthere's no hope . . . and I'm not equipped to have that kind of\nconversation. (Interview 10)\nIn addition, executives noted that financial and care man-\nagement restrictions result in a fragmented process of care,\nwith shorter inpatient stays and rapid transfers to lower lev-\nels of care or outpatient management. One hospital executive\nsaid,\nCase management has been used so heavily to keep length of\nstay short, make sure people get to the right level of care and\ndischarged timely. But how do you get to that other whole\npopulation [patients at EOL] resourced early with a plan? I don't\nthink case management . . . has really shown us that they have\nexpanded their net in this arena yet. (Interview 10)\nChanging EOL Care\nThe executives described many strategies to improve EOL\ncare in the hospital setting. Many indicated the need for a\nchampion at each facility. One executive said,\nSo if you have one or two who are leaders . . . either officially or\nunofficially . . . on the medical staff who will say \"no . . . this is\na valuable service . . . this is a valuable program . . . we need to\nsupport it . . . we need to be open to it.\" That, I think is essential.\n(Interview 7)\nThey also recognized the importance of their own role in\nthe process.\n. . . even though the administrators often are not directly involved\nwith EOL care, the decisions made at the administrative level set\nthe tone . . . really . . . for the whole facility. (Interview 6)\nThe executives noted that EOL care, although critically\nimportant for patients and for families, is essentially an unap-\npreciated endeavor. However, many recognized a need for sus-\ntained system changes, and they proposed the development of\noutcome measures that recognize the provision of EOL care.\nWho's out there saying today, you know, isn't it great that Dr.\n\"so and so\" had four patients die comfortably in the proper way\nwith their family at their side? But you hear when so and so\nfinished a procedure in twelve minutes . . . I mean what do we\nreally recognize people for in medicine? (Interview 8)\nIn addition to outcome measures, the executives sug-\ngested the development of a hospital infrastructure and sys-\ntems to support EOL care:\nI would say that we need to acknowledge our limitations today\nand look for ways to strategically begin to look for statistical\nprojections to be able to develop a plan that addresses\ninfrastructure development of services over time. (Interview 1)\nThe executives suggested that this infrastructure should\ninclude education; EOL care should not only be an essential\n4 SAGE Open\ncomponent of current curricula but a part of continuing edu-\ncation of the current health care force and the general\npublic:\nI think a lot of it comes back to education and I don't know what\nwe're doing even in physician education to make people in\ntraining aware of the needs that are out there and the programs\nlike palliative medicine that can be of benefit. I don't know, I'm\nalmost certain in our master's degree program in health\nadministration we're not teaching that. (Interview 7)\nThe executives also indicated a critical need to educate\nthe general public.\nAnd a lot of that then you know the final thing is educating the\ngeneral public because so much of this is American culture. You\nknow this I want everything, every last thing done to me. I find it\ninteresting because most people, many people . . . with more of a\nclinical background are like, uh, uh, I don't want that . . . I don't\nwant to be put through some of the things that you know we put\npatients through. I don't think a lot of patients and their families\nhave those conversations, understand that, etc. and so we get\nourselves into those kinds of positions as well. (Interview 14)\nDiscussion\nThis is one of the first qualitative studies to examine a range\nof hospital executives' perceptions on and experiences with\nthe provision of EOL care in acute care settings. It is clear\nfrom the participants' accounts that a complex range of bar-\nriers exist in the provision of EOL care. The responses of\nhospital executives indicated that there is a need for focusing\nefforts on EOL care, and they identified some potential strat-\negies to overcome barriers that were identified.\nHospital executives characterized current EOL care as\ncare in which the burden of decision making is commonly\nshifted to families when patients become incapacitated at or\nnear the EOL. Often, health care providers demonstrated dis-\ncomfort with discussing palliative care with patients and their\nfamilies, which can delay or limit discussions. As noted by\nBraun (Braun & McCullough, 2011), this can have dire con-\nsequences because these are very difficult decisions, with an\nemotional and socioeconomic overlay that most families are\npoorly prepared to make. Our results concur with other litera-\nture that has found that with little or no guidance from the\npatient, the family may have difficulty identifying and\nexpressing the patient's preferences rather than their own\n(Braun & McCullough, 2011; Garner, Henager, Kirchner, &\ntainty and increasing dependence on the provider, others have\nalso suggested that providers may be paternalistic by guiding\nthe families toward their preferences, instead of the patients\nReich, 1999). The sometimes paternalistic view of the pro-\nvider was not found to be a salient theme identified by hospi-\ntal executives in this study. A prominent barrier identified in\nthis study was the lack of adequate time and training to pre-\npare patients and their families for the end of life, limit\nunnecessary treatment, and focus care on achieving wishes\nand improving quality of life. Hospital executives also noted\nthat a fragmented care process contributed to poor communi-\ncation and barriers to effective EOL care. While lack of time\nand training have been shown to be barriers to advanced care\nplanning in primary care, our findings, as well as others\n(Meier, 2011), confirm that these constraints also affect acute\ncare providers. This may be additional area for case manag-\ners, who are often on the front lines of communicating with\nand arranging discharges and transitions in care based on\nSome of the hospital executives in this study suggested\nchanges in communication about preferences at EOL. They\nsuggested that EOL care could be enhanced by linking case\nmanagement with interdisciplinary care to assist health care\nproviders in proactively establishing goals of care. Recent\nresearch identified improved communication as a high prior-\nity, specifically regarding preferences of care at EOL (Sadler\net al., 2014). This research concluded that inadequate commu-\nnication predicted family dissatisfaction with care. Case man-\nagers could initiate palliative care assessments and\nconversations about setting goals of care, even if only for the\ncurrent hospitalization. Identifying and communicating these\npreferences with families and health care providers early in\ncare, before a patient becomes incapacitated, could enhance\nthe ability of health care providers to achieve a patient's\nwishes, even if only for the duration of the current hospitaliza-\ntion. These assessments rarely occur in the community, and as\nhas been found by Meier (Meier et al., 2004), combining pal-\nliative care with case management is a \"logical, feasible and\neffective strategy to improve the care\" of patients with a life-\nlimiting illness. By initiating the assessment and discussions,\ncase managers may be able to facilitate subsequent communi-\ncation and planning with primary care providers and providers\nin other settings such as long-term care facilities.\nHospital executives indicated that improving education\nabout EOL care (Cooper et al., 2010; Lamba, Pound, Rella,\nand options for care is a critical need (Coulourides, Brumley,\nthey noted that hospital stays are relatively short and fre-\nquently not the best time to have extensive discussions about\nsuch an important topic. Recently, Fink and colleagues (Fink,\nOman, Youngwerth, & Bryant, 2013) surveyed administra-\ntors about palliative care and similarly concluded that inad-\nequate knowledge by practitioners should be improved,\nespecially in rural hospitals where resources are scarce.\nWhile they acknowledged that hospitals have an important\nrole to play in education, they thought that established orga-\nnizations with education as a primary mission (e.g., the\nAmerican Heart Association, American Lung Association,\netc.), local community or faith-based organizations and state\nor local health departments could address advance care\nGarner et al. 5\nplanning with individuals and families and address specific\ndisease concerns or cultural or spiritual concerns (Field &\nExecutives indicated that there is a great need to use\nadministrative and clinical tools to benchmark and track the\nquality of EOL care. Key performance indicators (Twaddle\nMorrison, 2013), and evidence-based practices (Qaseem\net al., 2008) have been developed for use in palliative care\nsettings. These measures could be adapted and used to\nimprove hospital-wide care by recognizing health care pro-\nviders and systems that achieve/exceed indicator measures\nand by developing compliance plans for those that do not. As\nTwaddle (Twaddle et al., 2007) has reported, hospital systems\nneed to be in place to identify patients with potential life-lim-\niting illnesses and address the physical, psychological, social,\nand spiritual needs of these patients and their families.\nIn considering how to improve EOL care in hospital set-\ntings, the executives acknowledged their own leadership role\nbut, at the same time, suggested that large-scale cultural\nchange was needed to move providers from \"cure\" to \"care\"\nand toward an appreciation for the provision of EOL ser-\nvices. The hospital executives in this study noted that such\nchange could be achieved through infrastructure that sup-\nports the development of champions, as well as ongoing edu-\ncation of providers, patients, and the general public. The\nfindings of this study suggest that hospital executives,\nalthough key change agents, may have insufficient EOL\ninformation to implement steps toward cultural and infra-\nstructural change and should therefore be included in any\nEOL discussions and education.\nIt is important to consider the limitations of this study.\nBecause of its qualitative nature and small sample, further\nresearch is needed to investigate the prevalence of the barri-\ners and potential solutions noted by these executives. In\naddition, this study was conducted in the Southern \"Bible\nbelt,\" which has been associated with more intensive life-\nprolonging medical care near death (Phelps et al., 2012);\nthus, the executives' perceptions of patient expectations and\ntendency of providers to shift responsibility to patients and\nfamilies may be a function of geographically prevalent\nbeliefs and coping styles.\nAuthors' Note\nAll authors listed have contributed sufficiently to the project to be\nincluded as authors, and all those who are qualified to be authors are\nlisted in the author byline.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for\nthe research and/or authorship of this article: This work was supported\nby the South Central Mental Illness Research, Education and\nClinical Center and the Geriatric Research Education and Clinical\nCenter.\nReferences\nAhalt, C., Walter, L.
