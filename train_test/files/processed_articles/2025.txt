This approach has been\ncriticized, and recommendations for scoring\nsystems that incorporate assessments of comor-\nbidity have been proposed as alternatives.9\nRecently, we proposed a new clinical staging\nsystem that ranks people with excess adiposity\non a 5-point ordinal scale, while incorporating\nobesity-related comorbidities and functional stat-\nus into the assessment (Box 1).6 The Edmonton\nobesity staging system is intended to comple-\nment anthropometric measures, but it requires\nfurther validation. In this study, we examine the\npopulation distribution of Edmonton obesity\nstaging system scores and assess the system's\nability to predict mortality independent of\nanthropometric indices in a large, nationally rep-\nresentative US sample.\nMethods\nData collection\nWe used data from the National Health and\nHuman Nutrition Examination Surveys\n(NHANES), including the NHANES III (1988\u00ad\n1994) and the combination of three two-year\ncycles of the NHANES continuous surveys\nstratified, multistage probability cluster design to\nobtain nationally representative samples of the\nUS civilian population, with the exception of\nthose residing in institutions.

In total, 4373\nrespondents from the NHANES III and 3770\nour eligibility requirements. People for whom\nmortality information was missing or for whom a\nscore could not be assigned were excluded (n = 6\nNHANES III respondents and n = 170 NHANES\nple sizes were 4367 NHANES III respondents\nRace/ethnicity was categorized into non-\nHispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican-\nAmerican and other. Smoking status was defined as\ncurrent smoker, former smoker (lifetime exposure \n100 cigarettes) or never smoked. When a respond-\nent reported consuming alcohol, average annual\nalcohol consumption was calculated by multiplying\nthe number of beverages ingested daily by the\nnumber of days on which alcohol was ingested.\nThe mobile examination centre consisted of\nfour large trailers containing the equipment and\npersonnel needed to perform physical and bio-\nchemical evaluations. Trained examiners used\nstandardized protocols10 to measure weight,\nstanding height and waist circumference. Excess\nadiposity was classified according to BMI into\n( 30 kg/m2) categories.

Respondents with a self-reported history\nof angina, heart disease, heart failure and cere-\nbrovascular disease were given a score of 3. If\nthese comorbidities were absent, each of nine\nobesity-related comorbidity variables and one\nphysical function variable (Appendix 1, avail-\nable was scored separately, resulting in 10 dif-\nferent possible scores for each subject. Subse-\nquently, the highest score across the 10\ncategories was assigned as the final Edmonton\nobesity staging system score for that patient.

Results were similar after\nadjusting for hypertriglyceridemic waist and in\nthe cohort of respondents eligible for bariatric\nsurgery (Table 1).\nInterpretation\nMain findings\nWithin a nationally representative cohort,\nhigher Edmonton obesity staging system scores\nwere a strong predictor of increasing mortality\nin both the overall population and in a cohort\nof people eligible for bariatric surgery. This\nability was independent of BMI and the pres-\nence of metabolic syndrome or hypertriglyceri-\ndemic waist. Even within strata of BMI cate-\ngories, there was clear separation of survival\ncurves according to Edmonton obesity staging\nsystem scores.\nThe Edmonton obesity staging system does\nnot directly or indirectly measure adiposity,\ntherefore it cannot be used to define excess adi-\nposity. Rather, the system is intended to comple-\nment anthropometric indices and provide incre-\nmental clinically relevant prognostic information\nin a manner analogous to the \"tumor, node,\nmetastasis\" system widely used in oncology to\ndefine the size and extent of the spread of can-\ncer.6 The major incremental contribution of this\nstaging system to anthropometric indices and\ncardiovascular risk equations is the direct mea-\nTable 1: Adjusted Cox proportional hazard ratios showing the ability of the\nEdmonton obesity staging system to predict all-cause mortality in the\noverall population and within a subgroup of people eligible for bariatric\nsurgery*\nModel adjusted for\npresence of metabolic\nsyndrome,\nModel adjusted for\npresence of\nhypertriglyceridemic\nOverall\npopulation\nEdmonton obesity\nstaging system score\n0/1 Reference Reference\nBMI\nOverweight Reference Reference\nPresence of\nPresence of\nhypertriglyceridemic\nwaist, age, yr\nSubgroup eligible\nfor bariatric\nsurgery\nEdmonton obesity\nstaging system score\n0/1 Reference Reference\nBMI\nClass II obesity Reference Reference\nPresence of\nPresence of\nhypertriglyceridemic\nwaist, age, yr\nNote: BMI = body mass index, CI = confidence interval, HR = hazard ratio.\n*Data are from the National Health and Human Nutrition Examination Survey III (1988\u00ad\n1994). The model is stratified to allow for different baseline hazards according to all\ncombinations of race/ethnicity (white, black and other) and smoking status (current smoker,\nformer smoker or never smoked).\nHypertriglyceridemic waist was modeled by age as a time-dependent covariate owing to\nevidence of deviation from proportional hazards when constant effects were assumed over\nall attained ages.\nResearch\nsurement of the presence and severity of under-\nlying obesity-related comorbidities, which\nenables a more comprehensive and individual-\nized assessment of risk.\nSuch enhanced risk assessment may enable a\ngreater understanding of obesity-related progno-\nsis and may also assist in determining the\nurgency of intervention. This may be particu-\nlarly useful as a means for prioritizing patients\nfor bariatric surgery. Surgery is widely consid-\nered to be an effective treatment for severe obe-\nsity.1 However, surgery is difficult to access in\nCanada because of high demand and limited\ncapacity, which has led to the emergence of pro-\ntracted, multiyear wait times.17,18 Currently, most\npatients are selected for surgery on the basis of\nBMI thresholds alone and have few obesity-\nrelated comorbidities. The practice of selecting\npatients using BMI alone has been criticized as\ninaccurate and arbitrary and may result in the\nselection of patients who are least likely to ben-\nefit from weight reduction.9 Prioritizing patients\nwith higher Edmonton obesity staging system\nscores -- and thus greater comorbidity and risk\nof death -- may help maximize the benefits of\nsurgery. Further study, including full character-\nization of the risks and benefits, especially for\npatients with the highest scores, is required.\nLimitations\nComorbidities within the Edmonton obesity\nstaging system, such as diabetes and osteoarthri-\ntis, have been arbitrarily assigned to be equiva-\nlent in terms of their burden of illness. It is not\nyet clear whether certain comorbidities should\nreceive a higher weighting.\nBecause this study was a retrospective analy-\nsis of pre-existing data, certain pertinent data for\nassigning Edmonton obesity staging system\nscores, such as respondents' psychological func-\ntioning, were unavailable. In addition, some\ncomorbidities were based on self-report or were\ninferred as present based on the absence of other\ncommon causes (e.g., fatty liver disease), thus\nthey may be subject to a higher risk of bias than\ndirect measurements.\nWe have examined total mortality only; other\nend points such as quality of life and costs merit\nassessment.\nNo differentiation between types of diabetes\ncould be made (of Americans with diabetes,\nsubtypes would require management in an over-\nweight or obese cohort and were thus judged\nappropriate for inclusion.\nA final potential limitation is that the most\nrecent mortality follow-up available was from\n2006. Although not contemporaneous, we feel\nthat the results of this study remain relevant to\npeople who currently have overweight or obe-\nsity. We do, however, acknowledge the need for\nadditional follow-up analyses.\nConclusion\nThe Edmonton obesity staging system is a\nstrong predictor of increasing mortality indepen-\ndent of BMI, metabolic syndrome and hyper-\ntriglyceridemic waist. We propose that this sys-\ntem be considered adjunctive to current\nanthropometric classification systems in assess-\ning obesity-related risk, determining prognosis\nand guiding treatment. Further refinement of the\nstaging system would assist in determining the\nbest way of incorporating it into clinical care.\nReferences\n1.
