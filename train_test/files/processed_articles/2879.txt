One reason for this is its threat to the stability of the nancial\nsystem as a kind of systematic risk. So far, there is still little evidence on the interest rate\nrisk of most German banks. Within this paper, we examine for the rst time the interest rate\nrisk of all German universal banks on an individual bank level and analyze its determinants\nwith respect to banks' attributes. For this purpose, we develop a new model that allows the\nquantication of banks' interest rate risk using accounting-based data like balance sheets or\nregulatory information.\nInterest rate risk refers to the exposure of a bank's nancial condition to adverse move-\nments in interest rates. Principally, it arises from the maturity mismatch of a bank's assets and\nliabilities as well as from its o-balance positions. Since, for most banks, there are no bank\ninternal information or market values available, we use accounting-based data for our estima-\ntion. Accounting-based information on the maturity of a bank's assets and liabilities is typically\ngiven in a form with little detail, in so-called `time bands'. The Basel Committee on Banking\nSupervision suggested a standardized framework to quantify the interest rate risk of banks using\nthis information under general assumptions. Similar models are applied by supervisors of other\ncountries. To obtain better estimates of the maturity of a bank's assets and liabilities, we develop\na new model (Time Series Accounting-Based Model, TAM), that allows the integration of time\nseries information and dierent data sources. We estimate this model for the German banking\nsystem on individual bank level.\nComparing the results to the bank internally quantied interest rate risk that is available for a\nsubsample of banks, we show that our model is indeed able to explain the cross-sectional variation\nof banks' interest rate risk better than a standard approach that relies on assumptions similar\nto the models proposed in the literature. We nd evidence that savings banks and cooperative\nbanks have a signicantly higher interest rate risk. In addition, the interest rate risk increases\nwith the bank's size, and the interest rate risk of trading book institutions is larger than that of\nnon-trading book institutions.\nNicht-technische Zusammenfassung\nW\u00e4hrend in den vergangenen Jahren das Interesse von Bankenaufsicht und Forschung fast auss-\nchlie\u00fflich Kreditrisiken und operationellen Risiken gegolten hat, r\u00fcckt zunehmend auch das Zin-\nsrisiko aufgrund seiner Eigenschaft als systematisches Risiko in den Blickpunkt. Bis dato gibt es\njedoch keine verl\u00e4sslichen Informationen zum Zins\u00e4nderungsrisiko der meisten deutschen Banken.\nIn dieser Arbeit analysieren wir erstmalig das Zinsrisiko aller deutschen Universalbanken auf\nEinzelbankebene und analysieren dessen Einussfaktoren. Zu diesem Zweck entwickeln wir ein\nModell, anhand dessen das Zinsrisiko von Banken \u00fcber buchhalterische Gr\u00f6\u00ffen, wie beispiels-\nweise den Jahresabschluss oder regulatorische Meldungen, quantiziert werden kann.\nDas Zinsrisiko bezeichnet die Gefahr, dass sich Zins\u00e4nderungen negativ auf die Finanzlage\neiner Bank auswirken. Es wird im Wesentlichen durch die Fristeninkongruenz von Forderungen\nund Verbindlichkeiten der Bank sowie durch au\u00fferbilanzielle Gesch\u00e4fte bestimmt. Da f\u00fcr die\nmeisten deutschen Banken weder bankinterne Informationen zum Zinsrisiko noch Marktwerte\nverf\u00fcgbar sind, verwenden wir f\u00fcr unsere Sch\u00e4tzungen buchhalterische Gr\u00f6\u00ffen. Buchhalterische\nInformationen zur Fristigkeit der Forderungen und Verbindlichkeiten von Banken liegen im All-\ngemeinen wenig detailliert nach Zeitb\u00e4ndern vor. Der Baseler Ausschuss f\u00fcr Bankenaufsicht hat\neinen Modellrahmen vorgeschlagen, um anhand dieser Gr\u00f6\u00ffen unter pauschalen Annahmen auf\ndas Zinsrisiko von Banken zu schlie\u00ffen. \u00c4hnliche Modelle werden auch von Aufsichtsbeh\u00f6rden in\nanderen L\u00e4ndern verwendet. Um genauere Sch\u00e4tzungen f\u00fcr die Fristigkeit der Aktiva und Passiva\neiner Bank zu erhalten, entwickeln wir ein neues Modell (Time Series Accounting-Based Model,\nTAM), das Zeitreiheninformationen und Informationen aus verschiedenen Datenquellen integri-\neren kann.

Wir nden Hinweise darauf, dass Sparkassen und Kreditgenossenschaften\nein deutlich h\u00f6heres Zinsrisiko aufweisen als Kreditbanken. Zudem steigt das Zinsrisiko mit der\nGr\u00f6\u00ffe der Bank an, und Handelsbuchinstitute haben ein h\u00f6heres Zinsrisiko als Nichthandels-\nbuchinstitute.\nContents\n3.1 Denition of Interest Rate Risk . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6\n3.2 Introductory Example . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7\n3.3 General Framework . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11\n4.1 Data . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 14\n4.2 Model Specication . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15\n4.3 Model Evaluation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 19\n4.4 The Interest Rate Risk of German Banks . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 22\nA Specication of the Objective Function 27\nB Comparison of the Models' Accuracy 29\nAnalyzing the Interest Rate Risk of Banks Using Time Series of\nAccounting-Based Data: Evidence From Germany\n1 Introduction\nWhile over the past few years both banking supervisors and researchers have nearly exclusively\nfocused their attention on banks' credit and operational risk, the spotlight is now being turned\nagain on interest rate risk. One reason for this is its threat to the stability of the nancial\nsystem as a kind of systematic risk. In 2004, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision\n(2004b) suggested `Principles for the Management and Supervision of Interest Rate Risk' that\ngo far beyond current practice. Within these principles the Committee states that this [interest\nrate] risk is a normal part of banking and can be an important source of protability but stresses\nthat it is essential to the safety and soundness of banks that interest rate risk is maintained\nwithin prudent levels. A historical example of a banking crisis where interest rate risk played an\nintegral role is the `Savings and Loan Crisis' which occurred in the US during the 1980s. Between\nwhile further failures were prevented by 333 supervisory mergers. The total costs of the crisis\nThe German banking system has some features that make an investigation of interest rate\nrisk in this market especially interesting. First, German banks still typically act as qualitative\nasset transformers which makes the German banking system quite particular in comparison to\nother banking systems like in the US or UK (Schmidt et al., 1999; Allen and Santomero, 2001).\nInterest rate risk hence still arises from the basic banking business. So far, there is no reliable\n1The research for this paper was partly conducted while Alexander Zeisler was a visiting researcher at the\nDeutsche Bundesbank. He would like to thank the Deutsche Bundesbank for its hospitality and nancial support.\nWe are grateful to the participants at the nance seminars at the Universities of Bamberg and Innsbruck in 2006,\nthe Operations Research 2006 Conference, Karlsruhe, the 2nd Workshop on `Research on nancial stability using\nBundesbank banking data' in 2006, Frankfurt/M., the EFMA 2007 Annual Meeting, Vienna, and, especially, to\nJos\u00e9 Manuel Campa, Thomas Kick, Heinrich Kuhn, and Laetitia Lepetit for helpful comments and suggestions.\n2See Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (1997) for a detailed analysis.\nanalysis of the interest rate risk of most German banks and its determinants, but there are\nindications that the level of interest rate risk might be comparatively high: in 2006 the Deutsche\nBundesbank conducted a stress test among a sample of 25 banks. For 10 medium-sized and\nsmaller banks a 150 basis point interest rate shock caused an average loss of 15% of liable capital\n(Deutsche Bundesbank, 2006a). Via scaling, this is close to the Basel Committee's denition of\n`outlier banks' in case the supervisor sets the standardized interest rate shock to 200 basis point.\nSecond, the German universal banking system has a special structure: in addition to private\ncommercial banks (`Kreditbanken'), there are the state-owned savings banks (`Sparkassen') and\nthe member-owned cooperative banks (`Genossenschaftsbanken'). The banking groups dier\nin their business model (Schmidt and Tyrell, 2004) and the relevance of their interest bearing\nbusiness (Deutsche Bundesbank, 2006b). Third, there is a large number of German universal\nBecause there is still no standardized access to banks' internally quantied interest rate risk,\nmost models proposed in the literature and applied by banking supervisors rely on accounting-\nbased data.\nthe Federal Reserve's Economic Value Model (EVM) presented by Houpt and Embersit (1991)\nwell as the `standardized framework' suggested by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision\n(2004b). The Net Portfolio Value Model applied by the Oce of Thrift Supervision (OTS) is\nsimilar to these models but requires far more detailed information on the assets and liabilities of\nbanks that is exclusively available to the OTS (Oce of Thrift Supervision, 2000).\nAccounting-based data typically shows the amount of positions within certain time bands:\n3The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2004a,b) recommends the supervisors to be particularly at-\ntentive to those banks (= outlier banks) whose interest rate risk in the banking book leads to an economic value\ndecline of more than 20% of the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital (= liable capital) following a standardized\ninterest rate shock. This standardized interest rate shock can be set to \u00b1200 basis point or to the 1% and 99%\npercentiles of the yearly interest rate change.\n4There is an extensive literature on the interest rate sensitivity of stock returns of exchange-traded banks.\nSee Staikouras (2003, 2006) for recent surveys. However, as most German banks are not listed, this approach for\nanalyzing the interest rate risk is not applicable for the vast majority of German banks.\nthe total outstanding amount of a given position is distributed among a number of time bands\naccording to remaining time to maturity (e.g. in the US) and/or initial maturity (e.g. in\nGermany). Given this information, the cash ow structure of a bank's on-balance positions and\nits interest rate sensitivity can be estimated, but the results depend on the assumed distribution\nof maturities within these time bands. For example, the Federal Reserve's EVM assumes a\nconcentration in the middle of the time bands to estimate the interest rate risk of US commercial\nbanks, which is also suggested by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2004b). Bennett\net al. (1986) assume a uniform distribution.\nIn this context, our contribution to the literature is threefold: rst, we present a new method\nto derive a bank's interest rate risk using time series of accounting-based data. This allows us\nto estimate the distribution of maturities within the time bands. By doing so, we get greater\nprecision with our estimates of the interest rate risk. The framework is a generalization of the\naforementioned models such as the EVM and the proposal of the Basel Committee on Banking\nSupervision (2004b) and is exible enough to capture dierent actual reporting practices, for\nexample in the US and Germany, as well as the `reporting framework' suggested by the Basel\nCommittee on Banking Supervision (2004b). Additionally, it allows the integration of several\ndata sources that are available to regulators and/or external analysts.\nSecond, using unique data on the bank internally quantied interest rate risk in the banking\nbook that is available exclusively to the German supervisory authorities, we evaluate our model\non a subsample of German banks. Wright and Houpt (1996) in turn evaluate the Federal Re-\nserve's EVM on regulatory data, Sierra (2004) on stock returns, and Sierra and Yeager (2004)\non accounting performance measures.\nThird, we examine for the rst time the interest rate risk of the German universal banking\nsystem on an individual bank level and analyze its determinants with respect to banks' at-\ntributes. So far, the interest rate risk has only been analyzed for small samples of German banks\nusing market values of equity (e.g. Oertmann et al., 2000) or bank internal data (e.g. Deutsche\nThe empirical evidence in this paper can be summarized as follows: rst, our model is able\nto explain the cross-sectional variation of the interest rate risk of banks more accurately than a\nstandard approach that relies on one-point-in-time data. Second, bigger banks have a higher level\nof interest rate risk than smaller banks and third, the interest rate risk of German banks diers\nbetween the banking groups. Savings banks and cooperative banks tend to have a higher level\nof interest rate risk than private commercial banks. Additionally, there are structural dierences\nin the interest rate risk of trading book and non-trading book institutions.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 outlines our hypotheses. The\nmethod is presented in Section 3. Section 4 contains the description of the data sources, the\nmodel evaluation and the analysis of the interest rate risk of German banks. Section 5 concludes.\n2 Hypotheses\nThe aforementioned models that aim to quantify the interest rate risk of banks using accounting-\nbased information rely on one-point-in-time data. To derive the cash ow structure of a bank\nand its interest rate risk, these models use information on time bands of the maturities of the\nbank's assets and liabilities and assume a certain distribution of maturities within the time bands.\nWright and Houpt (1996) argue that the Federal Reserve's EVM, acting as a representative of\nthese simple models, yields results similar to the more complex Net Portfolio Value Model of the\nOTS. We in turn expect that the integration of time series information and dierent data sources\n such as the breakdown by initial maturity  signicantly improves our ability to explain the\ncross-sectional variation of banks' interest rate risk even though our model relies on data that\nbasically has the same simple structure as the input data of the EVM.\nHypothesis 1 (Model Quality) Our model is able to explain the cross-sectional variation of\nbanks' interest rate risk better than a standard approach that relies on one-point-in-time data.\nMaturity transformation is often seen as a specic function of banks (e.g. Niehans, 1978):\ncustomers tend to borrow long-term capital and to lend short-term capital. Additionally, banks\nmay have an incentive to lend out for the long term and renance for the short term since\nthe slope of the term structure is usually positive (e.g. Bhattacharya and Thakor, 1993): on\naverage, long-term interest rates (for assets) exceed the short-term interest rates (for liabilities).\nThus, on average, the bank achieves a premium from maturity transformation. On the other\nhand, the resulting maturity mismatch between the assets and liabilities causes interest rate\nrisk. While there is the incentive to bear interest rate risk due to the expected yield, there\nare several economic reasons why rms should manage and limit their risks (e.g. Allen and\nSantomero, 1998). These include, among others, costs of nancial distress (Warner, 1977) and\ncapital market imperfections (Froot et al., 1993; Froot and Stein, 1998). The literature expects\nthat smaller banks have a higher incentive to keep their exposure to interest rate risk low than\nbigger banks for several reasons: rst, bigger banks may be assumed to be too big to fail by\ntheir investors and other stakeholders and hence face lower nancial distress costs (e.g. Saunders\net al., 1990). Second, bigger banks are more diversied than smaller banks and hence have a\nlower level of idiosyncratic risk. To obtain a certain level of total risk, these banks may bear\nmore systematic (interest rate) risk (e.g. Demsetz and Strahan, 1997). Third, the information\nrisk may be lower for investors of bigger banks and hence may be substituted by interest rate\nrisk (e.g. Banz, 1981). Fourth, bigger banks may have more opportunities to trade their risk on\nthe capital market and hence to alter their exposure to interest rate risk via o-balance activities\nquickly, once a stress situation occurs. Hence, we hypothesize for the German banking system:\nHypothesis 2 (Bank Size) Bigger banks have a higher level of interest rate risk than smaller\nbanks.\nWe expect that the interest rate risk does not only depend on a bank's size but also on its banking\ngroup. An explanation is that the business model of savings banks and cooperative banks is prone\nto term transformation. Therefore, we hypothesize for the German banking system:\nHypothesis 3 (Banking Group) The interest rate risk diers between banking groups. Sav-\nings banks and cooperative banks have a higher level of interest rate risk than private commercial\nbanks.\n3.1 Denition of Interest Rate Risk\nIn order to apply a comparable and widely accepted measure for the interest rate risk of banks,\nwe follow the `standardized interest rate shock' approach also proposed within the new Basel\nCapital Accord (Basel II) and the `Principles for the Management and Supervision of Interest\nRate Risk' that are published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2004a,b):\nDenition 1 (Interest Rate Risk) The interest rate risk (IRR) of a bank is given by the\nmaximum absolute decline of its economic value caused by an upward and downward 200 basis\npoint parallel interest rate shock in relation to its regulatory capital.\nApproximating the interest rate sensitivity by the duration, the interest rate risk of a bank in\ntref (`reference date') is measured by:\ntCF >tref\n(tCF - tref )\nP\nposP OSA\nCF(pos,tref ,tCF )- P\nposP OSL\nCF(pos,tref ,tCF )\n(1+Rac(tref ,tCF ))(tCF -tref +1)\nRC(tref )\nRC(tref ) denotes the regulatory capital in tref . POSA is the set of all interest rate-sensitive\nasset positions, POSL the set of all interest rate-sensitive liability positions and {tCF } the set of\nall points in time when cash ows are due. CF(pos, tref , tCF ) denotes the cash ow of position\npos in tCF > tref from the perspective of tref .\nThe set of all CF(pos, tref , tCF ) will be referred\nto as `cash ow structure'. Finally, Rac(tref , tCF ) represents the annually compounded spot rate\nin tref for the date tCF . In line with the earlier accounting-based models (See Section 1) we only\ncapture here the interest rate risk of the net portfolio value, excluding other components such as\nthe exposure of the going concern value (See Samuelson, 1945).\n5It is well known that the duration of a defaultable cash ow usually diers from the duration of a corresponding\ndefault-free cash ow. Jacoby and Roberts (2003) provide a recent literature overview. In line with the approaches\nproposed in the literature (See Section 1) we assume default-free cash ows and apply the eective duration (See\n6The cash ow due in tCF\n= tref\ndoes not inuence the bank's interest rate risk and is hence omitted.\nThe key to the analysis is determining the detailed cash ow structure in (1) that is usually\nunknown to regulators, external analysts and a bank's stake holders. In the following, we present\na new method to derive this cash ow structure using accounting-based data. Since the distinctive\nfeature of our model is the ability to integrate time series information, we refer to the model as\n`Time Series Accounting-Based Model' (TAM). To highlight the underlying idea, we start with\na simplied example before we present the general framework.\n3.2 Introductory Example\nThe bank is assumed to contract only one type of interest rate-sensitive, default-free business in\neach year with initial maturities of 1, 2, 3, 4, and/or 5 years. To keep the example as simple\nas possible, we omit here payments other than those due to the face value at maturity. Thus,\nthe cash ow structure is completely determined by the face values of contracted business and\nthe corresponding maturity dates. For the reference date tref = 0, the bank structure, i.e. the\ncomposition of the portfolio the bank holds, is shown in the top of Figure 1, where\nXtbeg,tend  0  tbeg, tend (2)\ndenotes the face value of business that has been contracted in tbeg and that matures in tend.\nThe cash ow in tCF > tref is the sum of all business with maturity date tCF that has been\ncontracted until tref :\nCF(tref , tCF ) =\nitref\nXi,tCF . (3)\nIf each Xtbeg,tend in (3) or each cash ow CF(tref , tCF ) were known to the regulators or\nexternal analysts, they could easily calculate the interest rate risk in tref via (1). However,\nbanks do not usually report the Xtbeg,tend nor the detailed cash ows. But they regularly report\nthe outstanding amount of the business within certain time bands according to the remaining\ntime to maturity and/or the initial maturity.\nAssume that the bank's annual report in t gives the outstanding amount of the business with\na remaining time to maturity of up to 1 year, denoted by RTM0,1\nt , and of more than 1 year and\nup to 3 years, denoted by RTM1,3\nt . If regulators only take RTM0,1\n0 into account,\nthey know in t = 0 the cash ow that is due in one year but cannot distinguish between the cash\nows in 2 and 3 years, because only its sum RTM1,3\n0 is reported. However, they can gain further\ninformation if they incorporate past reports: since the remaining time to maturity of a certain\nbusiness decreases from date to date, the business migrates between the time bands over time.\nThis eect can be used to restrict the estimates of future cash ows.\nFor illustration, we restrict our example to two reporting dates: t = 0 and t = -1. As\n0 denotes the business in t = 0 that has a remaining time to maturity of 1 year it consists\nof business that had a remaining time to maturity of 2 years in the previous date t = -1\nand new business that is contracted in t = 0 and that matures in 1 year. Hence, we know\n0 . This relation also provides information on CF(-1, 2), as the sum\nof both cash ows equals the report item RTM1,3\n0 . Additionally, CF(-1, 2) cannot exceed\nCF(0, 2), since the latter consists of the former plus the business contracted in t = 0 that matures\nin t = 2. Hence, we can conclude that\nThis relationship restricts possible values of CF(0, 3), too, as the sum of both equals the amount\nreported in the time band RTM1,3\nThis simple example shows that former reports can indeed add information on today's cash\now structure by restricting the possible estimates and, hence, can improve the estimation of\na bank's interest rate risk. When we model a realistic bank with a lot of dierent positions,\ntime bands and reporting dates, the system of equations becomes rather complex and unhandy.\nHowever, the representation can be conceptually simplied by using the above-dened variables\nXtbeg,tend to express each single report item as a function of these variables.\nFor instance, Figure 1 shows the bank structure in t = 0 (top) and t = -1 (bottom). The\noutstanding amounts with a remaining time to maturity of up to 1 year and those of more than\n1 year and up to 3 years, respectively, are marked on the left-hand side. Since the reported\namounts equal the sum of the business within the respective time bands, the following equations\nReports on the\nRemaining Time to Maturity\nReports on the\nInitial Maturity\nMaturity Date\nTime of Contract\nMaturity Date\nTime of Contract\nMaturity Date\nTime of Contract\nMaturity Date\nTime of Contract\nThis gure shows the bank structure in t = 0 (top) and t = -1 (bottom), respectively. The left-hand side shows\nthe business items with a remaining time to maturity of up to 1 year (light shading) and those of more than 1 year\nand up to 3 years (dark shading). The right-hand side shows the items with an initial maturity within these ranges,\nrespectively. The rows refer to the time of contract (tbeg\n), whereas the columns refer to the maturity date (tend\n).\nXtbeg,tend denotes the amount of business that is contracted in tbeg\nand that matures in tend\n.\nFigure 1: Bank structure and bank reports in t = 0 and t = -1.\nmust hold:\nThis formulation additionally allows us to easily integrate further sources of relevant infor-\nmation. In Germany for instance, also time bands according to the initial maturity are available\nto the regulators. Assume that the bank reports in t the amount of business with an initial\nmaturity of up to 1 year and of more than 1 year and up to 3 years, denoted as ITM0,1\nt and\nt , respectively. The corresponding variables Xtbeg,tend are marked on the right-hand side\nof Figure 1 and we have:\nThe approaches proposed in the literature only use the information of (6a) and (6c) and omit\nthe remaining information. Equations (6a) to (7d) ((6a) to (6d) if reports on the initial maturity\nare not available) and the non-negativity restriction (2) form a system of linear equations that\nrestricts the possible bank structure, and hence via (3) and (1) the bank's interest rate risk.\nHowever, in general the system of equations is not uniquely determined. Instead, there exists\na space of solutions of bank structures that are all consistent with the reported data.\nTo identify\nan economically sensible solution, further assumptions are necessary. For illustration, we here\nassume that the cash ow structure of the bank is as constant as possible over the two dates\nt = 0 and t = -1. This can be expressed by optimizing a function F on the space of solutions:\nwe select that solution that minimizes the sum of the quadratic deviations between t = 0 and\n7Note that an ambiguous bank structure does not necessarily imply an ambiguous level of interest rate risk.\nt = -1 of the cash ows due in 1, 2, ..., 5 years in relation to the sum of all cash ows from the\nperspective of the respective date. Formalizing this procedure, we obtain:\nminimize F(X) = d2\nsubject to\n(1) Deviational Variables\nds =\nCF(0, tCF )\n-\nCF(-1, tCF )\n(2) Restrictions\nwhere X denotes the set of all variables Xtbeg,tend . We go on formalizing the ideas presented\nabove in a general framework.\n3.3 General Framework\nAnalogous to the previous example, we start by describing the bank structure. We choose a\ndiscrete setting that allows us to capture the bank structure by a nite number of variables. Due\nto the discrete granularity of the available data, no information is omitted.\nModel Component 1 (Bank Structure) The bank contracts interest rate-sensitive default-\nfree business in certain time points with a xed time to maturity and a xed, periodically paid\ncoupon. Once contracted, the business is on-balance with a constant amount until its maturity.\nThe cash ow implied by each business consists of the repayment of the face value and coupon\npayments.\nThe assumption of a xed, periodically paid coupon as well as the omission of amortization pay-\nments and default of assets can be relaxed easily. However, calculations on a subsample of banks\nhave shown that these assumptions do not aect our later results but yield a reduction of cal-\nculation burden. A possible bias implied by these or the remaining assumptions is compensated\nas shown in Section 4. We go on formalizing Model Component 1.\nThe set of points in time when business is contracted and/or cash ows are due is given by\nT = {ti}iZ where we set t0 = 0 for simplicity. In each tbeg  T the bank contracts certain\namounts of business of a position pos  POS (such as customer loans on the asset side or\ninterbank liabilities on the liability side) that mature in tend > tbeg.\nThe amount is denoted\nXpos,tbeg,tend and assumed to be non-negative:\nXpos,tbeg,tend  0  pos, tbeg, tend. (8)\nWe will refer to these variables as `business items'. The set of all business items is referred to as\n`bank structure'. The corresponding coupons are denoted cpos,tbeg,tend .\nUnder these assumptions, the cash ow in tCF > tref related to position pos is given by:\nCF(pos, tref , tCF ) =\ntitref\nXpos,ti,tCF +\nti<tref , tjtCF\nXpos,ti,tj cpos,ti,tj . (9)\nThe rst part of the right-hand side of (9) denotes the payments due for the repayment of the\nface values of all business items that are on-balance in tref and that mature tCF . The second\npart represents the corresponding coupon payments.\nModel Component 2 (Reports on the Bank Structure) At certain points in time the bank\nreveals information on its structure by reporting time bands of the outstanding amount for each\nposition broken down by remaining time to maturity and/or initial maturity, respectively.\nThis assumption captures current reporting practice. In each reporting date t  Tobs  T the\nbank reports the sum of all business (classied by position) within specied ranges of remaining\ntime to maturity and/or initial maturity, respectively. We assume that for each pos  POS in\neach t  Trtm\nobs\n Tobs there are |Npos| report items characterized by the business' remaining time\nto maturity: RTMpos,n\nt with n  Npos denotes the amount of pos in t with a remaining time to\nmaturity tend - t within the time band (hpos,n\nlower\n; hpos,n\nupper].\nAnalogously, in each t  Titm\nobs\n Tobs\nthere are |Mpos| items characterized by the business' initial maturity: ITMpos,m\nt with m \nMpos denotes the amount of pos in t with an initial maturity tend - tbeg within the time band\n(hpos,m\nlower\n; hpos,m\nupper ].\n8Daily maturing business is not included, since  applied for the German banking system  the model cannot\ndistinguish between daily and monthly maturing business due to the monthly granularity of the reports.\n9According to German reporting practice, we model left open intervals.\nSince the amount within a certain time band equals the sum of the relevant business items,\nthe former can be expressed as a linear function of the latter. Thus we obtain one function\n(restriction) for each reported time band and each reporting date, leading to a system of linear\nequations:\nhpos,n\nlower\n<tj-thpos,n\nupper\ntit\nXpos,ti,tj = RTMpos,n\nt\nt  Trtm\nobs\nhpos,m\nlower\n<tj-tihpos,m\nupper\ntit, t<tj\nXpos,ti,tj = ITMpos,m\nt\nt  Titm\nobs\nwhere (10) captures the restrictions due to reports on the remaining time to maturity and (11)\nthose on the initial maturity.\nModel Component 3 (Objective Function) An economically sensible solution is obtained\nby the optimization of a function on the space of solutions.\nThe system of equations given by (10), (11) and (8) restricts the values of the business items\nXpos,tbeg,tend and hence via (9) and (1) the bank's interest rate risk. However, it is clear that the\nsystem is in general not uniquely determined, i.e. it is not possible to infer the bank structure\nand the bank's interest rate risk unambiguously using accounting-based data. Thus, analogously\nto the example, further assumptions on the bank structure are necessary in order to identify an\neconomically sensible solution. These can again be formulated in terms of the optimization of a\nfunction F (`objective function'\n) on the space of solutions, and the optimization problem can\nbe expressed as follows:\noptimize F(X)\nwhere X denotes the set of all business items Xpos,tbeg,tend .\n10Note that we present a description model here, thus `objective function' does not refer to the bank's objective.\nTable 1: German universal banks\nSample\nAll Banks\nComplete Sample Trading Book Merged\nNumber Fraction Number Fraction Number Fraction Number Fraction\nThis table shows the breakdown of banks according to their banking group as of 31 December 2005, both for all\nGerman universal banks and for the sample analyzed in this paper. `Trading Book' refers to banks that have a\ntrading book and `Merged' refers to banks that took part in a merger during the sample period (1999 to 2005).\n`Number' refers to the absolute number of banks, whereas `Fraction' refers to the relative share. Branches of foreign\nbanks are not included. Commercial banks include `Landesbanks' and cooperative central banks as they show more\nsimilarities to commercial banks than to savings banks or cooperative banks. Deutsche Bundesbank (2006a) uses a\nsimilar classication.\n4 Empirical Analysis\nThe analysis is based on German universal banks as of 31 December 2005. Table 1 shows the\ncomposition of our sample. Banks for which data are incomplete are excluded from our analysis,\nwhich results in a total of 1,785 banks, accounting for 92.4% of all German universal banks.\nWe make use of the following major regulatory data sources: the data schedule pursuant to the\nauditor's report (`Sonderdatenkatalog') and the monthly balance sheet statistics (`Monatliche\nBilanzstatistik') for estimating the bank structure, and an interest rate risk survey for evaluating\nour model. Due to structural breaks within the data sources at the end of 1998, we restrict our\nsample to the period from January 1999 to December 2005. All data is provided by the Deutsche\nBundesbank.\nThe data schedule pursuant to the auditor's report contains asset and liability positions\nbroken down by remaining time to maturity for all banks on a yearly basis.\nIn contrast,\nthe monthly balance sheet statistics contain on a monthly basis a respective breakdown by\n11See Section 68 of the German Auditor's Report Regulation (`Pr\u00fcfungsberichtsverordnung') for detailed infor-\nmation.\ninitial maturity.\nWe consider 3 interest rate-sensitive asset and 4 interest rate-sensitive liability\npositions. The former include `interbank loans', `customer loans', and `debt securities held'. The\nlatter consist of `interbank liabilities', `customer liabilities', `debt securities issued', and `non-\nmaturing deposits'. The positions and the reported time bands are shown in Table 2.\nAdditionally, we use the Bundesbank's survey of lending and deposit rates (`Erhebung \u00fcber\nSoll- und Habenzinsen') and the MFI interest rate statistics, which replaced the former in 2003.\nBoth statistics contain monthly information on the coupons charged and paid by banks on new\nbusiness classied by time bands. For mid- and long-term default-free interest rates, we use\nthe term structure estimated by the Deutsche Bundesbank from German governmental bonds\naccording to Svensson (1994), and for the short-term rates we use the money market rates\nreported by Frankfurt banks (`Geldmarkts\u00e4tze am Frankfurter Bankplatz'). Regulatory capital\n(own funds) is taken from the reports of Principle I.\nTo evaluate our model results for the German banking system we use a non-published interest\nrate risk survey (IRRS) that was carried out by the Deutsche Bundesbank and the German\nFederal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin). All German banks were asked to report the\nlosses in their banking book (in relation to regulatory capital) as a consequence of, among others,\na 200 basis point shift in the term structure according to their internal risk-management system.\nThe participation rate was nearly 60%. For these banks we have bank internal interest rate risk\nreports for the reference date of 30 September 2005 that are consistent with our denition of\ninterest rate risk.\n4.2 Model Specication\nIn order to test our hypotheses we estimate the interest rate risk of the German banking system\nfor the reference date of 31 December 2005 on the basis of the TAM using the data from January\nof the respective business items to calculate the cashow structure via (9). In this context, we\n13See European Central Bank (2003) and the respective report forms for detailed information.\n14According to Sections 10 and 53 of the German Banking Act (`Kreditwesengesetz').\nTable 2: Positions and time bands\n(hpos,n/m\nlower\n; hpos,n/m\nupper\n]\ninterbank loans\ncustomer loans\ndebt securities held\n(hpos,n/m\nlower\n; hpos,n/m\nupper\n]\ninterbank liabilities\ncustomer liabilities\ndebt securities issued\nThis table shows the positions we use in our analysis and the time bands that are available for the German banking system. The rows refer to the\nbalance sheet positions POS. RTM denotes the time bands according to remaining time to maturity (included in the data schedule pursuant to the\nauditor's report). ITM denotes the time bands according to initial maturity (included in the monthly balance sheet statistics). The columns refer to\nthe range of the respective bands (in years). The cells refer to the report items, that are denoted in line with Deutsche Bundesbank, i.e. [form].[item]\nand [form].[row]/[column] for the data schedule according to the auditor's report and the monthly balance sheet statistics, respectively. The report\nitems from the data schedule according to the auditor's report are available on a yearly basis, those from the monthly balance sheet statistics on a\nmonthly basis.\nThe amounts in the data schedule according to the auditor's report do not t the corresponding data in the monthly balance sheet statistics for a\nsmall number of banks. To obtain consistent data, we scale the former to t the latter for these banks.\n: The amount of business within the time band is bigger than the report item.\n: On a yearly basis, the outstanding amount of the position `debt securities issued' with a remaining time to maturity of up to 1 year (i.e. RTM0,1\nt\n)\nneed to decide how to deal with non-maturing deposits as there is no reliable information available\non the economic maturity structure or time bands of non-maturing deposits. Additionally, we\nhave to dene an objective function F to select an economically sensible solution from the space\nof solutions.\nThe\nsystem of equations is based on the positions and the time bands that are reported\nwithin the data schedule pursuant to the auditor's report and the monthly balance sheet statistics\n(See Table 2). Within our sample period, 7 yearly observations of the former and 84 monthly\nobservations of the latter report are available. Identifying the reference date December 2005\nwith tref = t0 = 0, we obtain Trtm\nobs\nobs\nreduce calculation burden the initial maturity of business Xpos,tbeg,tend is restricted to tend -\nvariables and 1,750 linear equations plus the non-negativity restriction for each variable.\nWe assume that\ncoupons of positions that are contracted with banks or the capital market\nequal the default-free market interest rate. For the remaining positions we take the coupons from\nthe statistics presented in Section 4.1 and assume that they refer to the middle of the reported\ntime bands. The coupons for the remaining maturities are obtained by interpolating the spreads\nto the default-free capital market rates linearly between the coupons that are given.\nTo\nselect an economically sensible solution we assume a stable bank structure over the time\n`Stability' of the asset positions means here that the fraction of the\n15The system of equations turned out to be not solvable for a small number of smaller banks. For these banks\nour assumptions were not consistent with the reported data. To obtain a solution we selected that bank structure\nthat best tted the system of equations.\n16Deshmukh et al. (1983) show in a simple framework that banks may have an incentive to alter their exposure\nto interest rate risk depending on the magnitude and volatility of interest rates. Since the term structure of\ninterest rates was quite stable during the sample period, we maintain the assumption of a stable bank structure.\nThe actual specication of the objective function was selected in a simulation-based analysis. We modeled several\nsynthetic banks with reasonable business strategies such as constant or varying maturity transformation strategies.\nWe then created reports that the respective banks would have had submitted to the Deutsche Bundesbank and\napplied several specications of the objective function to compare the respective model results with the theoretical\nones. Based on several measures of t like the sum of the absolute or quadratic deviations between the model\nimplied and the real cash ow structure at the reference date, we identied the actual specication as superior.\noutstanding amount of all asset positions with a certain initial and/or remaining time to maturity\nin relation to the complete outstanding amount of all asset positions of the respective date remains\nas constant as possible over time. `Stability' of the liability positions is interpreted analogously.\nWe implement this by minimizing the sum of the quadratic deviations of the relative outstanding\namount with a certain remaining time to maturity and initial maturity, respectively, over all\npossible maturities and all observation dates. See Appendix A for details.\nNon-maturing deposits can be interpreted as short-term liabilities. However, it is well known\nthat they can exhibit a high level of interest rate risk (e.g. Hutchison and Pennacchi, 1996,\nJarrow and van Deventer, 1998, and O'Brien, 2000). This can to a large extent be explained by\nthe fact that the development of their volume and deposit rates turns out to be sticky, yielding\na duration or, equivalently, an economic maturity that is higher than that of other short-term\nproducts. For estimating the most `reasonable' economic maturity of non-maturing deposits,\nwe make use of the IRRS above. For dierent assumptions about the economic maturity, we\ncalculate the TAM and estimate the following linear regression on the IRRS-subsample of banks\n(IRRS-banks):\nRMIRRS\ni\n=  +  RMTAM\ni\nwhere RMIRRS\ni and RMTAM\ni denote the interest rate risk for bank i derived from the IRRS and\nthe TAM, respectively. We choose the economic maturity which yields the highest R2. The best\nt is obtained when we assume that the economic maturity of non-maturing deposits equals the\nlegal maturity of 3 months.\nInterestingly, when we apply the bank-individual assumption to the economic maturity of\nnon-maturing deposits that is also reported in the IRRS, we obtain a rather poor t. This\nsuggests that a number of banks did not include their internally assumed exposure of non-\nmaturing deposits when reporting the interest rate risk, which implies that the evaluation of our\nmodel in the following is quite conservative (i.e. we underestimate the model quality using the\nIRRS), since we cannot distinguish between the respective banks.\nTable 3: Evaluation of the model quality\nTAM BM p-Value\nIntercept Slope R2 Intercept Slope R2 (H0\nBM\n)\nN\nThis table shows the results of the regression RMIRRS\ni\n= Model + Model RMModel\ni\n+ i\nfor the subsample of banks that\ntook part in the IRRS (IRRS-banks) and for which both the TAM and the BM could be calculated.

The p-value is based on t-statistics (See Appendix B) and corresponds to the null\nhypothesis H0\nBM\n. N denotes the number of observations. Signicance at the 10%/5%/1% level is marked\n//.\n4.3 Model Evaluation\nTo benchmark our model to standard approaches and hence to test Hypothesis 1, we addition-\nally estimate a `Benchmark Model' (BM) that relies on one-point-in-time data. We consider\nthe same asset and liability positions as for the TAM, assume also an economic maturity of 3\nmonths for the deposits and use the breakdown by initial maturity on 31 December 2005 for the\nremaining positions,\nassuming that the business is concentrated in the middle of the reported\ntime bands.\nBased on this, we assume that the business has been contracted continuously over\ntime and has a coupon of 5%. This allows us to derive a (continuous) cash ow structure for\neach position and to estimate the interest rate risk analogously to (1).\nFor the evaluation we run regression (12) for the TAM and the analogue regression for the BM\non the subsample of IRRS-banks. The part of the cross-sectional variation of interest rate risk\nexplained by the respective models is measured by the coecients of determination R2, 27.33%\nfor the TAM and 19.15% for the BM, respectively (See Table 3). In Appendix B we develop\na procedure similar to Morgan (1939) that can tell whether the R2 dier signicantly. Table 3\nshows the results. We nd strong evidence that the R2 of the TAM exceeds that of the BM and\n17We rst estimated a model based on the remaining time to maturity in line with the standardized framework\nproposed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2004b) which, however, yielded a rather poor t for\nthe IRRS. We therefore specify the BM based on the initial time to maturity, whereas all other assumptions are\nin line with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2004b).\n18For the time bands (2; ) and (5; ), we assume a concentration at 4 and 6, respectively.\nconclude:\nResult 1 There is strong evidence that the Time Series Accounting-Based Model is able to ex-\nplain the cross-sectional variation of banks' interest rate risk better than the Benchmark Model.\nTable 4 shows the R2 for some subsamples of IRRS-banks. We stress two distinctive features\nhere: rst, the TAM better ts the internal data of those banks that have not merged during\nthe sample period. Mergers are dealt with by creating an articial bank before the date of the\nmerger, aggregating the balance sheet positions. As the assumption of a stable structure over\ntime is quite strong for merged banks, our model provides better quality for banks that did not\nmerge during the sample period. However, in both samples, the TAM ts the banks' internal\ndata on the interest rate risk better than the BM.\nSecond, as reported in Section 4.2, we nd indications that a number of banks did not include\ntheir internally assumed exposure of non-maturing deposits when reporting the interest rate risk\nin the IRRS. If some banks include this exposure, we underestimate the model quality using the\nIRRS as a benchmark. However, this problem should be less severe for banks that assume a low\neconomic maturity for non-maturing deposits. In fact, Table 4 shows that we obtain much better\nresults for these banks. In the rst quintile of the reported bank internal assumption about the\neconomic maturity of non-maturing deposits, the coecient of determination yields more than\n50%, and for non-merged banks even more than 66%.\nA detailed analysis (not reported here) shows that both the TAM and the BM overestimate\nthe true interest rate risk on average  assuming that the results of the IRRS represent the banks'\ntrue interest rate risk. This is also reected in the regression results in Table 3. If the models\nproduce unbiased estimates of the true interest rate risk then the respective constants  should\nbe zero and the slopes  should be one. A positive (negative)  and a  bigger (smaller) than one\nmeans that the respective model tends to underestimate (overestimate) the interest rate risk. The\nslope for both models is positive but clearly smaller than one. As the constants are comparatively\nsmall, this corresponds to the fact that both the TAM and the BM overestimate the interest\nrate risk of banks. This bias was to be expected as it can be explained by our assumptions: we\nexclude provisions and premature redemptions on the asset side and prolongation options on the\nTable 4: Evaluation of the model quality on subsamples of IRRS-banks\nR2 p-Value\nBM\n)\nN\nBy Banks' Assumption on the Economic Maturity of Non-Maturing Deposits\nBy Banks' Assumption on the Economic Maturity of Non-Maturing Deposits\nThis table shows the results of the regression RMIRRS\ni\n= Model +Model RMModel\ni\n+i\nfor\nsubsamples of banks that took part in the IRRS (IRRS-banks) and for which both the TAM\nand the BM could be calculated.

N\ndenotes the number of observations.\nliability side and assume a very small economic maturity of non-maturing deposits, i.e. we tend\nto overestimate the interest rate sensitivity of the asset side and underestimate the interest rate\nsensitivity of the liability side. As banks usually have a positive duration gap (e.g. Deutsche\nBundesbank, 2003b), these assumptions hence cause higher estimates of the level of interest rate\nrisk. Additionally, we do not consider o-balance positions, such as interest derivatives, that\non average can be expected to be used to reduce interest rate risk by the banks (e.g. Schrand,\nand Yeager (2004) when evaluating the EVM. Since the coecient of determination is invariant\nto any linear transformation our analysis of the model quality is not aected by the bias.\n4.4 The Interest Rate Risk of German Banks\nThe next step is testing the Hypotheses 2 and 3. The previous Section 4.3 showed that our\nestimates of the interest rate risk of banks are biased. Since the bias could depend on the banks'\ncharacteristics, we unbias our estimates for size and banking group. In addition, we include a\ncontrol dummy variable for trading book institutions.\nWe estimate the following regression for the banks that took part in the IRRS:\nRMIRRS\ni\n=  + 1 RMTAM\ni\n+ 2 Log(Assetsi) + SB DSB\ni\ni\ni\nwhere Assetsi denotes the sum of assets of bank i and DSB\ni (DCB\ni , DTB\ni ) is a dummy for savings\nbanks (cooperative banks, trading book institutions). Table 5 shows the results.\nThe coecients imply that the bias is independent of the bank size but depends on the\nbanking group and whether the bank has a trading book. The positive sign of the dummies for\nthe banking group suggests that  as we overestimate the interest rate risk for all investigated\nsubgroups on average (not reported here)  the overestimation is less severe for savings banks\nand cooperative banks than for private commercial banks. This implies that the eect of the\nsimplifying assumptions, discussed in Section 4.3, is more severe for the latter banks. One specic\nreason could be o-balance activities. The more a bank uses derivatives to decrease (increase)\nthe interest rate risk, the more (less) we overestimate the risk as the TAM does not consider\nderivatives. So our results could indicate that private commercial banks use interest derivatives\nTable 5: Analysis of the TAM bias\nSlope Dummies\nIntercept\nThis table shows the results of the multiple regression RMIRRS\ni\n= +1 RMT AM\ni\nLog(Assetsi\ni\n+\ni\n+ T B DT B\ni\n+ i\nin the subsample of banks that took part in the IRRS (IRRS-banks) and for which the\nTAM could be calculated.

Signicance at the 10%/5%/1%\nlevel is marked //.\nfor hedging purposes to a higher extent than the other banks. Analogously, the positive sign\nof the trading book dummy implies that the overestimation is less pronounced for trading book\ninstitutions. However, we would have expected a negative sign of the dummy, as our approach\nincludes the on-balance positions of the banking and the trading book, whereas the IRRS only\ncaptures the banking book (including o-balance positions). On the other hand, trading book\ninstitutions may assume a higher level of interest rate risk via derivatives, because once a stress\nsituation occurs they can more quickly alter their exposure to interest rate risk via capital market\ntransactions. When doing so, there are regulatory incentives to take the interest rate risk rather\nin the banking book than in the trading book (e.g. Jones, 2000). This could be done by `hedging'\nthe on-balance positions on the liability side of the banking book via derivatives. The resulting\neect would be captured by the IRRS but not by the TAM which would reduce the overestimation\nand hence would explain the sign of the dummy.\nWith the coecients from regression (13) we calculate for each bank in the whole data sample\nthe unbiased measure of interest rate risk (e.g. Greene, 2003)\nRM\nTAM\ni\n= ^\n + ^\ni\n+ ^\n2 Log(Assetsi) + ^\ni\n+ ^\ni\n+ ^\nand run the regression\nRM\nTAM\ni\n=  +  Log(Assetsi) + SB DSB\ni\ni\ni\non the whole data sample to test Hypotheses 2 and 3.

We do not report the value\nof the intercept since the level of interest rate risk for the German banking system is handled\ncondentially by the Deutsche Bundesbank.

N denotes the number of observations.\nSignicance at the 10%/5%/1% level is marked //.\nsize turns out to be signicantly positive, i.e. we nd evidence that there is a positive correlation\nbetween size and interest rate risk which supports Hypothesis 2.\nResult 2 There is strong evidence that bigger banks have a higher level of interest rate risk than\nsmaller banks.\nInterestingly, the trading book dummy is also positive. This is consistent with the consid-\neration from above and from Section 2 that banks that can alter their exposure more quickly\nthrough capital market transactions tend to assume a higher level of interest rate risk.\nResult 2 seems to contradict the results of the stress test among German banks, where \nbased on a sample of 25 banks  medium-sized and smaller banks turn out to have a higher level\nof interest rate risk than commercial banks and central institutions (See Deutsche Bundesbank,\n2006a). However, we nd evidence that the dierence of interest rate risk quantied within the\nstress test is rather attributable to the banking group than to size as the analyzed subgroup\n`medium-sized and smaller banks' mainly consists of savings banks and cooperative banks. The\ncoecients of the respective dummies in our empirical analysis are both highly signicantly\npositive and they are economically relevant: More precisely, the interest rate risk of savings\nbanks and cooperative banks is higher than that of the remaining banks and the dierence is\nabout 0.12 and 0.15, respectively. These dierences are more important than the eect due to\nsize: A doubling of a bank's total assets increases the interest rate risk by 0.004 on average. This\nnding is in line with the Hypothesis 3.\nResult 3 There is strong evidence that the interest rate risk diers between banks of dierent\nbanking groups and that the interest rate risk of savings banks and cooperative banks is higher\nthan that of the remaining banks.\n5 Conclusion\nIn this paper we developed a model to quantify the interest rate risk of banks using time series\nof accounting-based data. The framework is exible enough to include dierent data sources and\nto capture the standardized reporting framework suggested by the Basel Committee on Banking\nSupervision (2004b) and dierent actual reporting practices like in the US and in Germany.\nFurther, we examined  for the rst time  the interest rate risk of the German universal banking\nsystem on an individual bank level and analyzed its determinants.\nBased on a subsample of German banks to whose internally quantied interest rate risk we\nhave access via a unique interest rate risk survey conducted by the Deutsche Bundesbank and\nBaFin, we could evaluate our model results. In line with earlier models and studies we found\nthat our accounting-based approach produces biased estimates of the interest rate risk of banks,\nwhich is attributed to some simplifying assumptions. However, we found convincing evidence\nthat our model is able to explain the cross-sectional variation of banks' interest rate risk better\nthan a benchmark model that relies on assumptions similar to models proposed in the literature\nand applied by banking supervisors. We controlled for the bias and analyzed factors that aect\nthe level of interest rate risk of German banks. We found strong evidence that bigger banks have\na higher level of interest rate risk than smaller banks. Further, we found good evidence that the\ninterest rate risk diers among banks of dierent banking groups. Savings banks and cooperative\nbanks have a higher level of interest rate risk than private commercial banks. Lastly, there are\nstructural dierences between trading book and non-trading book institutions.\nBanks may also have incentives to alter their exposure depending on the magnitude and\nvolatility of interest rates. Within our sample period, the term structure of interest rates was\nquite stable in Germany. As a structural break in the data at the end of 1998 bars us from\ngoing further back in time, an analysis of the time variability of interest rate risk in the German\nbanking system must be left for future research.\nAppendix A Specication of the Objective Function\nThe objective function that is to be minimized F() = FA()+FL() consists of two functions FA()\nand FL() that are related to the asset and the liability side, respectively. Since the asset and the\nliability sides are treated analogously, we only present the denition of FA() here:\nFA(X) =\ntTobs rtmRTM\nassets,t,rtm\n+\ntTobs itmITM\nassets,t,itm\nwith the deviational variables\ndassets,t,rtm =\nposPOSA j0\nwith j\n+rtmITM\nwithi+j\nITM\n-\nposPOSA j0\nwith j\n+rtmITM\nwithi+j\nITM\n t  Tobs, rtm  RTM,\ndassets,t,itm = posPOSA\nXpos,0,itm\nwithi+j\nITM\n- posPOSA\nXpos,t,t+itm\nwithi+j\nITM\n t  Tobs, itm  ITM.\nThe deviational variables dassets,t,rtm and dassets,t,itm correspond to the remaining time to ma-\nturity and the initial maturity, respectively. The rst part of dassets,t,rtm (dassets,t,itm) denotes\nthe outstanding amount with a remaining time to maturity rtm (initial maturity itm) at the\nreference date 0 in relation to the complete outstanding amount. The second part denotes\nthe respective fraction at the observation dates t  Tobs = {-83/12, -82/12, ..., 0}. As de-\nscribed in Section 4.2, the initial maturity tend - tbeg of business Xpos,tbeg,tend is restricted to\ncal eciency of the optimization procedure, we additionally reduce the number of deviational\nvariables: we do not include the deviational variable dassets,t,rtm for any possible remaining time\nthe objective function.\n19Several robustness checks showed that this simplication does not aect our results.\nAppendix B Comparison of the Models' Accuracy\nLet 1 and 2 with E(j) = 0, j = 1, 2, be the error terms of two regressions with the same\ndependent variable y.
