The paper discusses the design of simple monetary and fiscal\npolicy rules consistent with determinate equilibrium dynamics in the absence of Ricardian\nequivalence. Under this assumption, government debt turns into a relevant state variable\nwhich needs to be accounted for in the analysis of equilibrium dynamics. The key analytical\nfinding is that without explicit reference to the level of government debt it is not possible to\ninfer how strongly the monetary and fiscal instruments should be used to ensure determinate\nequilibrium dynamics. Specifically, we identify in our model discontinuities associated with\nthreshold values of steady-state debt, leading to qualitative changes in the local determinacy\nrequirements. These features extend the logic of Leeper (1991) to an environment in which\nfiscal policy is non-neutral. Naturally, this non-neutrality increases the importance of fiscal\naspects for the design of policy rules consistent with determinate dynamics.\n",

Im Kontext rationaler Erwartungsgleichgewichte impliziert dies,\ndass das Gleichgewicht zumindest lokal eindeutig determiniert sein sollte. Obwohl dieses Kriterium\nf\u00fcr eine vern\u00fcnftige Ausgestaltung makro\u00f6konomischer Politikregeln weitgehend akzeptiert ist,\nzeichnet sich die Literatur durch eine beachtliche Asymmetrie in der Analyse von geld- und\nfiskalpolitischen Aspekten makro\u00f6konomischer Regeln aus. Geldpolitische Regeln, die zumeist als\nZinsregeln konzipiert sind, die mit einem Feedback auf endogene Gr\u00f6\u00dfen wie Inflation oder\nOutputniveau reagieren, sind zuletzt in gro\u00dfer analytischer Detailliertheit untersucht worden.\nDemgegen\u00fcber gibt es jedoch keine vergleichbar detaillierte Literatur zum ad\u00e4quaten Einsatz\nfiskalpolitischer Instrumente.\nDiese Asymmetrie ist angemessen in Modellzusammenh\u00e4ngen, die durch Ricardianische \u00c4quivalenz\ngepr\u00e4gt sind und in denen Fiskalpolitik durch Variationen nicht verzerrender Steuern implementiert\nwird. Unter diesen speziellen Annahmen reduziert sich im Sinne des Ansatzes von Leeper (1991) die\ngenuine Interdependenz geld- und fiskalpolitischer Entscheidungen zu zwei separierbaren\nTeilproblemen, die rekursiv gel\u00f6st werden k\u00f6nnen. In einem ersten Schritt, unabh\u00e4ngig von\nfiskalischen Aspekten, l\u00e4sst sich das geldpolitische Design der Regeln charakterisieren.

Dazu wird ein analytisch handhabbares\nNeu-Keynesianisches Modell entwickelt, in dem die Verm\u00f6genseffekte staatlicher Schuldtitel nicht\nauf die intertemporale Budgetrestriktion des Staates beschr\u00e4nkt sind, sondern vielmehr mit allen\nanderen Gleichgewichtsbedingungen interagieren.

Zweitens, die Determiniertheitsregionen sind eine nicht\nstetige Funktion des Niveaus der langfristigen Staatsschuld, so dass es an bestimmten\nSchwellenwerten der Staatsschuld zu qualitativen Verschiebungen bei den geld- und fiskalpolitischen\nFeedbackparametern kommt. Diese beiden Ergebnisse, die ein direktes Resultat der unterstellten\nNicht-Neutralit\u00e4t der Fiskalpolitik sind, relativieren die eingangs skizzierte dynamische\nSeparierbarkeit von Geld- und Fiskalpolitik in einfachen makro\u00f6konomischen Politikregeln und\nimplizieren eine eher symmetrische Rolle der beiden Politikbereiche, auf die bei der Ausgestaltung der\nRegeln R\u00fccksicht zu nehmen ist.\nContents\n4 Classification of local equilibrium dynamics 13\n5 Endogenous labour supply of Ricardian consumers 20\nMonetary and fiscal policy interactions in a New Keyne-\nsian model with capital accumulation and non-Ricardian con-\n1 Introduction\nThe literature on the desirable design of macroeconomic policies typically concludes that\noperational policy rules should not be a source of non-fundamental fluctuations in economic\nactivity, implying that the induced rational expectations equilibrium should be at least\nlocally unique.

The views\nexpressed in this paper are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the European\nCentral Bank.\n2 For representative treatments, see Taylor (1993), Kerr and King (1996), Bernanke and Woodford\ndevelop a tractable New Keynesian model in which wealth effects of government debt are\nnot restricted to the intertemporal budget constraint of the government but fully interact\nwith all remaining equilibrium conditions of the economy. This implies that government\ndebt turns into a relevant state variable which needs to be accounted for in the analysis of\nlocal equilibrium dynamics.3 In our analysis, the `relevance' of government debt translates\ninto two findings. First, without explicit reference to the steady-state level of government\ndebt it is not possible to infer how strongly the monetary and fiscal instruments within\nsimple feedback rules should be used to ensure locally determinate equilibrium dynamics.\nSecond, the determinacy regions depend on the underlying level of debt in a discontin-\nuous way such that the determinacy conditions undergo qualitative changes at certain\nthreshold values of steady-state debt. Reflecting the assumed non-neutrality of fiscal pol-\nicy, these two features overturn the logic of separable monetary and fiscal dynamics as\nsketched above and lead overall to a more symmetric treatment of monetary and fiscal\npolicy aspects.\nTo make this reasoning precise, the analysis builds on a New Keynesian version of the\nmodel of Blanchard (1985) in which, assuming that all taxation is lump-sum, departures\nfrom Ricardian equivalence can be conveniently modelled through a change in a single pa-\nrameter, the probability of death of consumers. Specifically, Ricardian equivalence ceases\nto hold whenever this probability is assumed to be strictly positive, i.e. if consumers are\n`non-Ricardian'.4 Because of the short-sightedness of non-Ricardian consumers, govern-\nment debt affects aggregate consumption dynamics via the Euler equation, and government\ndebt dynamics are no longer separable from the remaining equilibrium conditions. Mon-\netary and fiscal policy are assumed to follow two stylized rules with a deliberately simple\nfeedback structure. Monetary policy follows an interest rate rule which specifies how the\nmonetary instrument (i.e. the interest rate) reacts to deviations of actual inflation from a\ntarget level of inflation. The single policy parameter of this rule is the `Taylor-coefficient'\non inflation, and monetary policy is called `active' (`passive') if this coefficient is larger\nthan unity, i.e. if the real interest rate rises (falls) in the inflation rate. Fiscal policy\nfollows a debt targeting rule which specifies how the unique fiscal instrument (i.e. the\nlump-sum tax rate) reacts to deviations of the actual level of real government debt from a\ntarget level of debt. The single policy parameter of this rule is the feedback coefficient of\ntaxes on debt. In line with Leeper (1991) and, among others, Sims (1998), Schmitt-Groh\u00e9\nand Uribe (2004), and Davig and Leeper (2005), we call the fiscal rule `passive' (`active')\nif this coefficient is larger (smaller) than the steady-state real interest rate.5\nIf consumers are non-Ricardian, our analysis of local steady-state dynamics shows that\nthere exist, depending on the assumed target level of government debt, two distinct stabil-\n3 We do not adress dynamic properties from a global perspective. Moreover, to allow for an exlusive focus\non government debt, real balances are assumed to be a negligible fraction of total government liabilities.\n4 For the same terminology, see Cushing (1999). In a related, but not identical specification Gali et al.\n(2004) consider `rule-of-thumb consumers' who intertemporally can neither borrow nor save. Frequently,\nthe literature refers to this type of consumers also as `non-Ricardian'.\n5 If defined in this way, a passive fiscal policy ensures under Ricardian equivalence that government\ndebt dynamics per se are not explosive, while under an active rule locally stable debt dynamics require the\nadjustment of some other variable, like a change in the price level.\nity regimes characterized by `low' and `high' steady-state levels of debt.6 In both regimes,\nlocal determinacy regions are not separated by the demarcation lines of active vs. passive\nfiscal policy-making. Moreover, the two regimes have the feature that there always exist\nregions of the parameter space (in terms of the two feedback parameters of the policy\nrules) which ensure determinate dynamics at `low debt' steady states, but not at `high\ndebt' steady states, and vice versa. This feature makes it impossible to infer the ranges of\nactivism and passivism of both instruments consistent with local equilibrium determinacy\nwithout explicit reference to the prevailing target level of government debt. Intuitively,\nin our economy the level of debt fully captures the non-neutrality of fiscal policy through\nthe associated wealth effect in the Euler equation. The relative importance of this wealth\neffect, however, varies in the level of debt. In particular, since the process of capital for-\nmation is endogenous in the model of Blanchard (1985), there exists a link between the\nsteady-state level of debt and the degree of crowding out of capital. This in turn affects\nthe steady-state real interest rate which is a key input for the marginal cost schedule of\nfirms. In other words, when the capital stock is endogenous, wealth effects of government\ndebt lead to non-trivial demand and supply effects which allow for qualitatively distinct\ndynamics at low and high levels of steady-state debt. Specifically, in a sense to be made\nprecise below, our model implies that in the high (low) debt regime the required degree\nof fiscal discipline increases (decreases) if monetary policy becomes more active. Finally,\nwe show that this classification of local equilibrium needs further modifications if one also\nallows for inefficient steady states.7\nThese rich findings contrast strongly with a regime of `Ricardian' consumers, character-\nized by the limiting assumption of a zero probability of death. In this regime, the wealth\neffect of government debt in the Euler equation vanishes and the economy converges to\na Ramsey-economy characterized by Ricardian equivalence and separable fiscal dynam-\nics. Consequently, government debt is no longer an informative state variable and local\ndeterminacy regions are separated by the demarcation lines of active vs. passive fiscal\npolicy-making, independently of the target level of government debt.\nOur paper links to the related literature in a number of ways. First, it needs to be\nemphasized that the usage of the terms `active' and `passive' policy-making, unfortunately,\nis far from uniform in the literature. In particular, Leeper (1991) himself motivates his\nanalysis from a generic definition which classifies a policy as passive (active) if it shows an\n(un)responsive reaction to current budgetary conditions. This leads him to the conclusion\nthat \"a unique pricing function requires that at least one policy authority sets its control\nvariable actively, while an intertemporally balanced government budget requires that at\n6 Throughout the analysis, government expenditures are specified as exogenous and changes in the\nsteady-state level of debt result from variations in the target level of the lump-sum tax rate. Hence, we\ndo not compare local dynamics between different fiscal instruments (i.e. between different fiscal closure\nrules), as done, for example, in Michel et al. (2006). The assumption of exogenously specified government\nexpenditures makes it particularly tractable to analyze the role of wealth effects if consumers are non-\nRicardian.\n7 Such steady states exist since the steady-state relationship between lump-sum taxes and debt turns\nout to be non-monotic beyond a certain threshold value. Beyond this value, the target level of debt no\nlonger summarizes all the relevant information on which characterizations of stabilization policies should\nbe conditioned. Instead, the target levels of both taxes and debt need to be made explicit.\nleast one authority sets its control variable passively\".8 From the perspective of such a\nmore encompassing definition, active and passive policy reactions, if considered outside\nthe particular structure of Leeper's model, are no longer necessarily linked to constant\nthreshold values of the feedback parameters in both policy rules. In principle, it would be\npossible to reclassify our determinacy regions along these lines. However, this would not\naffect our main result that under non-Ricardian consumers any such reclassification would\nbe conditional on the level of steady-state debt under consideration.\nSecond, a number of recent papers have addressed aspects of non-neutral fiscal policies\nto discuss various properties of monetary and fiscal policy rules in environments which\ndepart from Ricardian equivalence. All these studies, however, abstract from capital stock\ndynamics. Because of this feature, supply-side patterns are less rich and none of the\nstudies reports the existence of thresholds levels of debt which lead to qualitative changes\nin the dynamic properties of the economy, as established in this paper.\nUsing standard Ramsey-type set-ups, Edge and Rudd (2002) and Linnemann (2006) con-\nsider New Keynesian economies in which fiscal policy is non-neutral because of distor-\ntionary taxation. Both papers show that this modification, conditional on the nature and\nthe degree of the distortion, changes the benchmark of the Taylor principle, but there is\nno explicit reference to the role of debt. In similar spirit, Canzoneri and Diba (2005) give\nfiscal policy a non-neutral role by assuming that government bonds provide transaction\nservices. Similar to our conclusion, the paper offers numerical results which show that the\naggressiveness of monetary policy which is needed to ensure locally determinate dynamics\ndepends non-trivially on fiscal parameters, but the paper does not report a systematic\nrole of government debt in this context. Davig and Leeper (2005) extend the original\ncontribution of Leeper (1991) to an environment with switching regimes which cover all\nfour combinations of active and passive monetary and fiscal policy-making. This feature\nimplies that shocks to fiscal policy affect the dynamics of the price level even if the regime\ncurrently in place would suggest that Ricardian equivalence is satisfied.\nThird, our paper relates to the growing literature on monetary policy and capital accu-\nmulation, as recently summarized in Benhabib et al. (2005). In particular, because of the\ncontinuous time dimension of the model of Blanchard (1985), our findings can be related\nto Dupor (2001) and Carlstrom and Fuerst (2005), and we address this relationship in a\nseparate discussion in Section 5.\nThe remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 develops the model economy.\nSection 3 establishes the existence of steady states and summarizes the equations which\ngovern local dynamics around steady states. Section 4 derives the main results of the\npaper on the determinacy of equilibria. Section 5 offers a self-contained discussion of\ncritical aspects of the labour supply specification. Section 6 concludes. Technical parts\nand proofs are delegated to the Appendix.\nhowever, to the complementary terminology of Ricardian vs. non-Riardian fiscal policies.\n2 The Model\nConsumers are specified as in Blanchard (1985) in that they face a constant probability\nof death, denoted by   0. If this probability is positive ( > 0), the effective decision\nhorizon of private agents is shorter than of the government and the model differs through\nthis channel from a standard Ramsey-type infinite horizon economy. The latter type of\neconomy, however, can be discussed as a special case if one considers a zero probability of\ndeath ( = 0).\n2.1 Problem of the representative consumer\nA consumer born at time j has a constant time endowment of unity per period. In a\nrepresentative period, he chooses consumption (cj\ns) and real money balances (mj\ns) in order\nto maximize his intertemporal utility function, taking as given the rate of time preference\n and a constant probability of death .9 The individual labour supply is inelastically fixed\nat nj\ns = 1. We allow for three distinct assets: physical capital, interest-bearing government\ndebt, and real balances. Later on, when studying the dynamics of the economy, we consider\nfor simple tractability the cashless-limit. To this end, it is convenient to assume that real\nbalances enter the utility function of agents in an additively separable manner. Expected\nutility of the consumer at time t reads as\nEtUj =\nZ\n\nt\n[ln cj\ns\n+  ln mj\ns\n] \u00b7 e-(+)(s-t)ds, (1)\nwhere  governs the share of real balances in the consumer's portfolio (and   0 corre-\nsponds to the cashless limit). The consumer holds real non-human wealth aj\ns = kj\ns+bj\ns+mj\ns,\nconsisting of physical capital (kj\ns), real government bonds (bj\ns), and real balances. The con-\nsumer's flow budget constraint is given by,\ndaj\ns\n= rs(aj\ns\n- mj\ns\n) + aj\ns\n+ ws\n- j\ns\n- cj\ns\n- smj\ns\n+ j\ns\nPhysical capital and real government bonds are perfect substitutes, earning the same risk-\nless real rate of return rs, while real balances depreciate at the rate of inflation s. As\nconsumers do not live forever, competitive insurance companies are prepared to pay a\npremium aj\ns in each period in return for obtaining the non-human wealth of consumers\nin the case of death. The individual is paid a real wage of ws and is subject to a lump-\nsum tax j\ns. Consumers also receive a share of the profits of final goods producers of j\ns,\nto be derived below. The first-order condition for consumption is given by cj\ns\n,\nwhere j\ns\ndenotes the co-state variable from the current value Hamiltonian used to solve\nthe consumer's problem. Real balances satisfy /mj\ns = j\ns\n(rs + s), leading to the money\ndemand equation mj\ns = cj\ns/(rs +s). The co-state variable evolves over time according to\ndj\ns\n= -(rs -)j\ns\n, implying the law of motion for individual consumption dynamics dcj\ns =\n9 As to be discussed below, cj\ns\ndenotes a consumption index of the Dixit-Stiglitz-type, i.e. final output\nis produced in terms of differentiated goods (along the unit interval) and ps\nstands for the corresponding\naggregate price index.\n(rs-)cj\ns. Integrating the flow budget constraint and imposing the transversality-condition\nregarding non-human wealth (i.e. lims aj\ns \u00b7e-\nU\ns\nt\n(r\u00b5+)d\u00b5 = 0), the intertemporal budget\nconstraint can be written as\nZ\n\nt\ncj\ns\n\u00b7 e-\nU\ns\nt\n(r\u00b5+)d\u00b5ds =\n(aj\nt\n+ hj\nt\n),\nwhere hj\nt\nis the individual's human wealth\nhj\nt\n=\nZ\n\nt\n(ws + j\ns\n- s) \u00b7 e-\nU\ns\nt\n(r\u00b5+)d\u00b5ds.\nIntegrating the law of motion for cj\ns forward (in order to express cj\ns as a function of cj\nt\n),\none obtains from the intertemporal budget constraint the individual consumption function\ncj\nt\n= ( + )(aj\nt\n+ hj\nt\n2.2 Aggregate behavior of consumers\nFollowing Blanchard, it is convenient to normalize the population size (and, hence, the\nlabour force) by assuming that at any moment in time a new cohort is born of size .\nAny such cohort born at j has a size, as of time t, of  \u00b7 e-(t-j). Then, the size of the\ntotal population will always be unity, since\nR\nt\n-\n \u00b7 e-(t-j)dj = 1, implying nt = 1 for all\nt. Integrating over individuals of all cohorts yields the aggregate consumption and money\ndemand functions, respectively\nct =\n + \n(at + ht) (3)\nmt = \nct\nrt + t\n,\nwith variables without the j-index denoting aggregates. The evolution of aggregate human\nwealth follows dht = (rt + )ht\n- wt + t\n- t. Aggregate non-human wealth is given by\nat = kt+bt+mt and follows the law of motion dat = rtat+wt-(1+)ct+t-t. For further\nreference it is convenient to express the dynamics of the aggregate behavior of consumers\nin terms of ct and at. Upon differentiating ct with respect to time and substituting out for\nht, one obtains\ndct = (rt - )ct - \n + \nEquation (4) captures the well-known feature that, whenever  > 0, the growth rate\nof individual consumption (rt\n- ) exceeds the growth rate of aggregate consumption,\ndespite a constant propensity to consume out of wealth for all individuals. The reason\nfor this is given by the fact that at any moment in time agents with a high level of\nnon-human wealth are replaced by new-borns with zero non-human wealth. Because of\nthis generational turnover effect aggregate consumption dynamics in the Euler equation\n(4) depend on the aggregate level of non-human wealth (which includes the outstanding\nlevel of government liabilities), in contrast to a standard Ramsey-economy with  = 0. Of\ncourse, this is not the only way of introducing non-Ricardian behaviour in a macromodel.\nHowever, it has the advantage of introducing a pure wealth affect in consumption as the\nform of deviation from Ricardian equivalence, and moreover, this effect is entirely captured\nin a single parameter, , thereby facilitating comparison with a Ricardian benchmark.\nOther relaxations of Ricardian equivalence, such as introducing credit constraints (Gali\net al. (2004)) or distortionary taxation (Linnemann (2006)), will often be less tractable\nor contain direct supply side effects. Nevertheless, such devices are typically intended to\nhave the effect of allowing fiscal policy (and the level of debt) to affect aggregate demand,\nsuch that our approach can be treated as a particularly tractable way of introducing such\nan effect and, if desired, can be calibrated to mimic the empirical evidence on the ability\nof fiscal policy to do this.\n2.3 Problems of the representative firms\nWe have two types of firms in our model.\nThere is a competitive continuum of firms which accumulate capital for rental to final\ngoods producers. Let it denote the real investment of these firms, using a mix of final\ngoods which is identical to the private consumption pattern. Moreover, assume that\ncapital depreciates at the rate  > 0, leading to the law of motion for the capital stock\ndkt = it\n- kt.\nCapital rental firms are owned by private households. The return on capital is identical\nto the risk-free rate rt if the rental rate of capital (pk\nt\n) charged to the final goods sector\nsatisfies the zero-profit condition pk\nt\n= rt + .\nWe assume that final goods are produced by imperfectly competitive firms which are\nsubject to the constraints implied by Calvo-contracts (Calvo, 1983), such that at any\npoint in time firms are able to change prices with instantaneous probability . Firms are\nlined up along the unit interval and a typical firm, with index z, produces according to a\nCobb-Douglas function\ny(z)t = n(z)\nt\nt\n.\nInput markets are perfectly competitive. Cost-minimization implies that the combination\nof labour and capital employed by the firm is given by\nk(z)t\nn(z)t\n=\nkt\nnt\n= kt =\n\nwt\npk\nt\nwhich is common across firms because of price-taking behavior in the input markets.\nBecause of the Cobb-Douglas assumption, the cost function is linear in output, with\nmarginal cost of production being given by\nMCt = (pk\nt\nt\nIn period t firm z is assumed to face the demand schedule\ny(z)t = (\np(z)t\npt\n)-yt,\nwhere yt is the total demand for final goods and  > 1 denotes the constant elasticity of\ndemand.10 The objective of a firm which has the chance to reset its price in period t can\nbe written as\nVt =\nZ\n\nt\n[\n\u00b5\np(z)t\nps\n\u00b6\nys - MCs\n\u00b5\np(z)t\nps\n\u00b6\n-\nys] \u00b7 e-\nU\ns\nt\n(r\u00b5+)d\u00b5ds.\nThe optimal price implied by the optimization of this objective function is given by\np(z)t =\nR\n\nt\n\nps\n\u00b4\n-\nMCsys\n\u00b7 e-\nU\ns\nt\n(r\u00b5+)d\u00b5ds\nR\n\nt\nps\n\u00b4\nys \u00b7 e-\nU\ns\nt\n(r\u00b5+)d\u00b5ds\nwhich represents the forward-looking generalization of the familiar static (or steady-state)\nmark-up pricing rule p(z)/p = /( - 1)MC. The aggregate price index prevailing at time\nt can be seen as a weighted average of prices set in the past, where the weights reflect the\nproportion of those prices that are still in existence, i.e.\npt =\nZ\nt\n-\n(p(z)s)1- \u00b7 e-(t-s)ds\n.\nFinally, aggregate profits earned in the final goods sector can be written as\nt =\nZ\nt\n-\n[(\np(z)s\npt\n)1- - MCt(\np(z)s\npt\n)-]yt\n\u00b7 e-(t-s)ds, (5)\nwith profits distributed to the private sector as specified in (2).\nLet lt denote aggregate real liabilities of the public sector, consisting of real balances and\nbonds, lt = mt + bt. Substituting out for mt, flow dynamics of public sector liabilities are\ngiven by\ndlt = rtlt - (rt + t)mt + g - t = rtlt - ct + g - t (6)\n10 The demand schedule is consistent with the Dixit-Stiglitz consumption aggregator ct\n=\n[\nU\nc(z)\n\nt\ndz]\n\n-1 and the aggregate price level pt\n= [\nU\nt\n1- . In line with these aggregators, it is\nassumed that investment and public consumption have the same demand structure as private consumption.\nwhere gt = g > 0 denotes an exogenous and constant stream of government expenditures\nin terms of aggregate final output. It is assumed that monetary and fiscal policies follow\ntwo stylized rules with a deliberately simple feedback structure. First, regarding monetary\npolicy, we consider an inflation target of zero, i.e.  = 0. Given the nominal stickiness\ndue to Calvo-pricing contracts, the monetary agent has, in the short-run, leverage over\nthe real interest rate and we consider a feedback rule of the form\nrt = r + fM (t - ),  = 0, (7)\nwhere r stands for the steady-state level of the real interest rate to be derived below. The\nsingle policy parameter fM in (7) is the Taylor-coefficient, as discussed in the literature\non interest rate rules inspired by Taylor (1993). Accordingly, monetary policy is called\n`active' (`passive') if the real interest rate (rt) rises (falls) in the current inflation rate, i.e.\nif fM > 0 (fM < 0). Since (7) is directly expressed in terms of the real (and not the\nnominal) interest rate, the critical value of the Taylor-coefficient is zero (and not unity).\nSecond, fiscal policy follows a feedback rule which aims at stabilizing government liabilities\nat some target level l. To achieve this target, lump-sum taxes get adjusted according to\nt =  + fF (lt\nWith gt = g being fixed, the only fiscal instrument in (8) is t. This strong assumption\nserves to make departures from Ricardian equivalence in the local equilibrium analysis\nbelow as simple and transparent as possible. According to (6), in any steady-state equi-\nlibrium characterized by  = 0 real government bonds are given by\nb =\n - g\nr\nimplying that the real value of outstanding government bonds must be completely backed\nby the present value of future primary fiscal surpluses. There are two further comments\nworth making regarding the cashless limit to be considered below. First, as   0, this\nimplies lt  bt, and the feedback rule (8) turns into a purely fiscal `debt targeting rule'.\nSecond, with real government debt growing at the real interest rate rt, debt dynamics in\n(6) are, per se, locally not explosive if the single fiscal feedback parameter fF exceeds the\nsteady-state interest rate r. Following the logic of Leeper (1991), we call the fiscal rule (8)\n`passive' if fF > r, while it is `active' in the opposite and non-stabilizing case of fF < r.11\n2.5 Summary of equilibrium conditions\nFor further reference, the conditions which characterize dynamic equilibria at the aggregate\nlevel can be summarized as follows.\nConsumers:\ndct = (rt - )ct - \n + \n11 The local equilibrium analysis carried out below is based on approximated laws of motions. For the\nanalysis to be valid it is assumed that the two feedback parameters fM and fF are sufficiently close to the\nbenchmark values of 0 and r, respectively.\nGovernment:\ndlt = rtlt\nt =  + fF (lt - l) (13)\nFirms:\nt\nkt =\n\nwt\nrt + \nMCt = (rt + )1-w\nt\np(z)t =\nR\n\nt\n\nps\n\u00b4\n-\nMCsys\n\u00b7 e-\nU\ns\nt\n(r\u00b5+)d\u00b5ds\nR\n\nt\nps\n\u00b4\nys \u00b7 e-\nU\ns\nt\n(r\u00b5+)d\u00b5ds\npt =\nZ\nt\n-\n(p(z)s)1- \u00b7 e-(t-s)ds\nIncome identities:\nMutual consistency of the plans of all consumers, firms, and the government requires that\nin equilibrium aggregate final output yt satisfies the market clearing condition\nyt = ct + g + it. (20)\nIn equilibrium, aggregate output must also satisfy the income identity\nyt = wt + (rt + )kt + t, (21)\nwith aggregate profits t of the final goods sector defined as in equation (5). By the law\nbe satisfied as well if aggregate profits t follow (5). Because of the residual character of\nt, we can drop (5) and (21) from the following analysis.\n3 Steady states\nTo enhance the analytical tractability of the analysis we consider from now on the cashless\nlimit (  0), implying lt  bt. In steady state, p(z) = p, which we normalize to p = 1.\nFrom (18), mark-up pricing implies ( - 1)/ = MC. Combining (16)-(17), factor prices\ncan be rewritten as a function of the capital stock\nk\nc\nEH\n-\nkgr\n\n-\n(a) (b)\ng \u00af\n\n\u00af\nb\n\nb\nFigure 1: Steady-state configurations\nw =\n\nr =\n\nand w(k) and r(k) tend towards the marginal productivity expressions as the economy\nbecomes perfectly competitive (  ). Using (23), the remaining equations can be\narranged as a system in c and k. Combining the steady-state version of the consumption\nEuler equation (10) with the government's budget constraint (11), yields\nc = ( + ) \u00b7\nk + -g\nr(k)\nr(k) - \nwhile the steady-state resource constraint is given by\nEquations (24) and (25) are similar to Blanchard (1985) and can be graphed as in Figure\n1(a) to establish the differences between environments characterized by Ricardian and\nnon-Ricardian consumers. In the Ricardian limit ( = 0), wealth effects with respect\nto asset holdings disappear and the economy has a unique steady state (with k = kgr)\nwhich is characterized by the modified golden rule r = , independently of the structure\nof debt and taxes. By contrast, if  > 0 steady states exhibit r > , since `non-Ricardian'\nconsumers are more impatient than infinitely lived `Ricardian' consumers. To understand\nthe non-Ricardian case in further detail, consider initially a situation of a balanced primary\nbudget, i.e. g =   b = 0. Then, the economy is generically characterized by two steady\nstates with positive levels of consumption, capital and output, as long as the level of\ngovernment spending g > 0 is not too large. Holding this level of g constant, an increase\nin  generates a positive level of government debt which at both steady states affects k\nand c via wealth effects. Intuitively, government bonds are perceived as net wealth by\ncurrently alive consumers, since the tax burden, backing these bonds, is partly borne by\nmembers of future generations.12 However, the amount of debt that can be passed on\nbetween different generations cannot be arbitrarily large. As  keeps rising, (25) in Figure\n1(a) remains unaffected, while (24) shifts upward, and there exists a unique value (g),\nwith associated debt level b, beyond which the two steady states cease to exist.\nWe concentrate in the following exclusively on the high-activity steady state (EH) to\nfacilitate a meaningful comparison of our results with the Ricardian benchmark. To find\na simple operationalization for this, we make from now on the mild assumption\nAs shown in Appendix 1, under a balanced primary budget ( = g) any steady state which\nsatisfies (A 1) must be of the high-activity type.13 Importantly, as graphed in Figure 1(b),\nat the high-activity steady state (EH) the relationship between  and b is non-monotonic\nif one increases , holding g constant. The intuition for this feature is as follows. As  rises\nthe primary surplus  - g increases. Moreover, the real interest rate increases, since the\nwealth effect leads to a crowding out of physical capital. These two effects make the net\neffect on the steady-state debt level b, which is given by the discounted value of primary\nsurpluses (i.e. b = ( - g)/r)), ambiguous. For  sufficiently close to g the first effect\ndominates and b rises in . However, there exists a unique value (g) which maximizes\nthe steady-state value of government debt at b, while b falls as  further increases in the\ninterval (, ). For future reference, we summarize this pattern as follows:\nLemma 1 Consider a steady state of (24) and (25) with a balanced primary budget which\nsatisfies 0 < g =  < y. Then, by varying  and holding g constant, there exists a range\nof efficient high-activity steady states (EH) characterized by   (g, )  b  (0, b),\nand there exists a range of inefficient high-activity steady states (EH) characterized by\n  (, )  b  (b, b), as graphed in Figure 1(b).\nProof: See Appendix 1.\nUpon combining (10)-(20), local dynamics around steady states can be characterized by\na dynamic system in bt, ct, kt, and t. Given the non-linearity of the system, we consider\na first-order approximation. Let b\nxt = xt-x\nx\n, d b\nxt =  e\nxt\nt\n=\n\u00b7\nxt\nx\nfor x = b, c, k. As regards\ninflation dynamics, since  = 0, we consider t and dt = \u00b7\nt, respectively.\n12 For further details, see, in particular, Weil (1991). The crucial mechanism for this result is not the\nprobability of death, but rather the `disconnectedness' between consumers currently alive and those born\nat some point in the future.\n13 Assumption (A 1) says that the government expenditure ratio should be less than the Cobb-Douglas co-\nefficient of labour which is typically assumed to be around 2/3. Hence, (A 1) does not impose a `restriction'\nthat could become binding under plausible calibrations.\nStarting out from the differential equations (10), (11), and (14), when combined with the\ntwo feedback rules (12) and (13), it is straightforward to obtain the approximated laws of\nmotion for b\nbt, b\nct, and b\nkt :\ndb\nbt = (r - fF )b\ndb\nct = -( + )\nb\nc\nb\nbt + (r - )b\nct - ( + )\nk\nc\nb\ndb\nkt = -\nc\nk\nb\nct + [(1 - )\ny\nk\n- ]b\nMoreover, as derived in Appendix 2, inflation dynamics can be approximated by the\nexpression:\ndt = -(r + )b\nkt + [r - (r + )\nfM\nr + \nThe equations (26)-(29) constitute a four-dimensional linear system of differential equa-\ntions. The system is characterized by two state variables (b\nbt, b\nkt) and two forward-looking\njump variables (b\nct, t) with free initial conditions, and local dynamics can be assessed by\nthe Blanchard-Kahn conditions.14 Let J denote the Jacobian matrix of the system.

Hence, the matrix J in (30) turns into\nJ =\n\n\n\n\nk\nk\n0 0 -( + )  - ( + ) fM\n+\n\n\n\n14 The notion of a predetermined stock of real government debt can be justified as follows. First, because\na fraction of firms sets prices in a forwardlooking manner, the inflation rate t\nis a jump variable. Second,\nassume that the stock of nominal government bonds is predetermined. Then, real government debt must\nbe counted as a state variable, because it cannot move independently of the jump in inflation.\nCompared with (30), the assumption of  = 0 simplifies the dynamic structure of the\neconomy in two important ways, both linked to the aggregate consumption Euler equation\nas described by the second row in (31). First, since government bonds are not perceived\nas net wealth, consumption dynamics are not affected by government debt dynamics,\n( + )b\nc\n= 0. In fact, government debt dynamics do not affect any of the other three\ndynamic equations. As a result of this separability, one eigenvalue of (31) is given by\n =  - fF . Second, the absence of wealth effects also implies that consumption dynamics\nare not affected by capital dynamics, (+)k\nc\n= 0. This leads to a well-known and simple\nrelationship between the stance of monetary policy (measured by fM ) and the profile of\nconsumption close to the steady state, reflecting the assumption of logarithmic utility in\nconsumption. This relationship says that if in response to some shock inflation is above\ntarget (t > 0) consumption slopes upward (downward), whenever monetary policy is\nactive (passive), while it stays flat if monetary policy is neutral (fM = 0).\nExploiting the separability of government debt dynamics, we address first the isolated\nmonetary dynamics before we then turn to the joint monetary and fiscal dynamics of (31).\nBy deleting the first column and the first row in (31), monetary dynamics can be read-\nily inferred from the remaining sub-system in c, k, and . The monetary sub-system is\ncharacterized by one state variable (k) and two forward-looking variables (c, ).\nProposition 1 Monetary dynamics\nConsider the dynamic sub-system in c, k,  implied by the matrix (31).\n1) Assume monetary policy is passive. Then, dynamics are always determinate.\n2) Assume monetary policy is active. Then, dynamics are never determinate. There exists\na critical value q > 0 such that dynamics are indeterminate of degree 1 if fM > q.\nProof: With one state variable and two forward-looking variables, dynamics are deter-\nminate if Jc,k, has one negative and two positive eigenvalues.15 Let\nDet(Jc,k,) =\nc\nk\nTr(Jc,k,) = (1 - )\ny\nk\n-  +  - ( + )\nfM\n + \ndenote the determinant and the trace of the 3x3-matrix Jc,k,, respectively. Assume\nfM < 0. Then, Det(Jc,k,) < 0 and Tr(Jc,k,) > 0, implying one negative and two\npositive eigenvalues. Assume fM > 0. Then, Det(Jc,k,) > 0, i.e. dynamics are never\ndeterminate. Note that Tr(Jc,k,) is a linear function of fM , and Tr(Jc,k,) < 0 obtains\nif fM becomes sufficiently large. Hence, there exists a critical value q such that Jc,k, has\ntwo negative and one positive eigenvalues, implying dynamics are indeterminate of degree\n1 if fM > q. \u00a4\n15 We do not distinguish explicitly between real and conjugate complex eigenvalues, i.e. our classification\nrefers to the real part of any eigenvalue which is crucial for the stability behaviour.\nProposition 1 reflects the fact that local stability types of steady states under monetary\ndynamics depend on the single feedback parameter fM . The critical value fM = 0 defines\nthe boundary value for the unique parameter region of determinacy.16 It is worth pointing\nout that in the New Keynesian version of the model of Blanchard (1985), as developed in\nthis paper, passive (and not active) monetary policy is a necessary and sufficient condition\nfor determinate dynamics. Since the model is in many ways standard, the failure of the\nTaylor-principle may seem surprising, but there are two non-standard elements. First,\nlabour supply is assumed to be fixed. Second, monetary policy has non-trivial supply-side\neffects because of the contemporaneous link between the real interest rate and the return\non physical capital, as recently discussed in Dupor (2001) and Carlstrom and Fuerst (2005).\nWe show below that the failure of the Taylor-principle is entirely due to the second aspect.\nMore specifically, we show, at the expense of more tedious algebra, that the classification\nof Proposition 1 remains unaffected if one augments preferences with a standard elastic\nor even linear labour supply specification. However, since the Taylor principle itself is\nqualitatively not important for the main results of this paper, given our focus on the\ndependence of the nature of local dynamics on the target level of government debt, we\ndelegate this discussion to a self-contained analysis in Section 5.\n4.1.2 Monetary and fiscal dynamics\nUnder Ricardian consumers it is straightforward to extend any clear-cut characterization\nof the monetary sub-dynamics, as summarized in Proposition 1, to a characterization of\nthe combined monetary and fiscal dynamics. Fiscal policy adds a second state variable\n(b) and an additional eigenvalue  =  - fF . This eigenvalue is negative (positive) if fiscal\npolicy is passive (active). Combining this pattern with Proposition 1, one obtains:\nProposition 2 Monetary and fiscal dynamics\nConsider the dynamic system in b, c, k,  implied by the matrix (31).\n1) Assume monetary and fiscal policy are passive. Then, dynamics are always determinate.\n2) Assume monetary and fiscal policy are active. Then, dynamics are determinate if\nfM > q, with q as established in Proposition 1.\n3) Assume monetary policy is passive and fiscal policy is active or, alternatively, monetary\npolicy is active and fiscal policy is passive. Then, dynamics are never determinate.\nProposition 2 summarizes that fiscal policy contributes to the local stability properties of\nsteady states in a rather mechanical way if consumers are Ricardian. Essentially, whenever\nthe monetary sub-dynamics by themselves are determinate, this feature will be preserved if\nfiscal policy behaves passively, i.e. if government debt dynamics evolve in a self-stabilizing\nmanner. By contrast, active fiscal policy is decisive for the achievement of determinate\ndynamics whenever the monetary sub-dynamics exhibit one degree of indeterminacy. Intu-\nitively, in this situation active fiscal policy ensures that arbitrary expectations of inflation\n16 For small positive values of fM one obtains Det(Jc,k,) > 0 and Tr(Jc,k,) > 0 such that fM = 0\nseparates a region of determinacy from a region of instability (i.e. all three eigenvalues are positive).\nShaded areas: Regions of local determinacy\nfM\nfF\nq\n\n-\nFigure 2: Monetary and fiscal dynamics: Ricardian consumers\ncan no longer be validated in equilibrium since the local stability requirement of govern-\nment debt imposes uniquely defined values for the forward-looking variables (c, ). This\nsame mechanism is also at the heart of the `fiscal theory of the price level', as developed\nFor future reference, Figure 2 illustrates how the assumption of Ricardian consumers\nreduces the joint design problem of monetary and fiscal policy-making to two separable\nproblems which can be recursively addressed. Shaded areas describe the parameter regions\nof determinacy established in Proposition 2. These regions are separated by the demar-\ncation line of active vs. passive fiscal policy-making (fF = ) and they are independent\nof the target level of government debt. Again, we point out that this qualitative result\ndoes in no way depend on the failure of the Taylor-principle in Section 4.1.1 on monetary\ndynamics. Similarly, a richer monetary feedback-rule (reacting, for example, also to some\nmeasure of real economic activity along the lines of Woodford (2003)), leading to a crit-\nical value different from fM = 0, can be accommodated with the same logic, as long as\ngovernment debt dynamics remain separable.\n4.2 Non-Ricardian consumers ( > 0)\nOwing to the non-Ricardian structure, consumption dynamics are now, in general, affected\nby the dynamics of government debt, implying that the transition matrix J in (30) is no\nlonger separable with respect to fiscal policy. Reflecting the non-neutral role of fiscal policy,\nthe entries of J in (30) depend crucially on the `position' of the high-activity steady state\n(EH) which itself depends on fiscal policy. In particular, for any given level of g, the levels\nof c, k and r depend on the steady-state mix between bonds and taxes in a non-trivial\nmanner, as summarized in Lemma 1.\nTo assess the implications of the non-Ricardian structure for the local dynamics of steady\nDet(J)>0: Necessary condition for local determinacy\nfM fM fM\nfF fF fF\n(a)   (g, 1) (b)   (1, ) (c)   (, \u00af\n)\nr r\nr\nDet(J)>0, Tr(J)<0: Sufficient condition for local determinacy\n- - -\nFigure 3: Monetary and fiscal dynamics: non-Ricardian consumers\nstates it is instructive, in a first step, to investigate the necessary condition for determinacy\nwhere the coefficients 0, 1, and 2 are functions of the fiscal parameters. Notice that all\ntechnical results used from now onwards in this Subsection are summarized in Appendix 3.\nRearranging (34) one obtains for the critical demarcation line Det(J) = 0 the expression\nDet(J) = 0  fF = r(1 +\n).\nAssume first that steady states are efficient, implying that there is for a given level of\ng a one-to-one relationship between taxes and debt, i.e. g <  <   0 < b < b.\nThen, depending on the target level of debt, Det(J) = 0 has two distinct configurations\nin fM - fF - space which can be graphed as in Figures 3(a) and (b). To relate these two\ngraphs to the previous discussion notice that if  = 0 the locus of Det(J) = 0 coincides,\nirrespective of the level of debt, in both cases with the demarcation lines of active vs.\npassive policy-making (i.e. fF = r and fM = 0), as graphed in Figure 2. If  > 0,\nhowever, there exist two distinct regimes. Intuitively, for small levels of debt the wealth\neffect is also small and the parameter region consistent with Det(J) > 0 is close to the\ncombinations of active and passive policy-making underlying Figure 2.17 As b rises the\nwealth effect becomes relatively more important, leading to changes in the steady state\nlevels of c, k, r and, hence, also in 0, 1, and 2. We show that there exist unique\nthreshold values 1\n (g, )  b1\n (0, b) which lead to a change in the sign pattern\nof 0, 1, and 2. This change implies that at the target level of government debt b1 the\nlocus associated with Det(J) = 0 switches from Figure 3(a) to Figure 3(b), leading to a\nqualitative change of the local dynamics of the system. Intuitively, there is scope for the\nexistence of such threshold values because of the endogeneity of the capital stock. This\nfeature ensures that the wealth effect of government debt affects not only the demand side,\nbut also the supply-side of the system, since any change in the real interest rate resulting\nfrom crowding out effects shifts the marginal cost schedule of firms. Figures 3(a) and (b)\nreveal that this interaction is very non-linear. In particular, the two regimes, as graphed\nin Figures 3(a) and 3(b), have the feature that there always exist regions of the parameter\nspace which are necessary for locally determinate dynamics at `low debt' steady states,\nbut not at `high debt' steady states, and vice versa.\nThe reasoning so far is based on a necessary condition. To make it more operational we\ncombine (34) with the additional trace-condition Tr(J) < 0. It can be established that\nis a sufficient condition for locally determinate dynamics.18 From (30), the trace of J is\ngiven by\ny\nk\n(r + )\nr + \nwhich can be rearranged as\nEquation (37) describes at all debt levels a straight line with positive intercept and neg-\native slope in fM - fF - space, leading to the graphical representation of the sufficiency-\ncondition given in Figure 3. In sum, this leads to the conclusion:\nProposition 3 Monetary and fiscal dynamics at efficient steady states\nAssume   (g, )  b  (0, b).\n17 Specifically, assuming non-Ricardian consumers, it is easy to check within (30) that in the special\ncaseof of b = 0 one eigenvalue of J is given by r -fF . Hence, fF = r implies Det(J) = 0, similar to Figure\n2. However, if b = 0 there are nevertheless wealth effects associated with the capital stock. Because of this\nfeature, fM = 0 no longer implies Det(J) = 0.\n18 To further clarify the differences between Figures 2 and 3, notice that the shaded areas in Figure 2\nare based on a condition which is necessary and sufficient for local determinacy. By contrast, in Figure\n3 horizontally shaded areas correspond to a necessary condition, while horizontally and vertically shaded\nareas correspond to a sufficient condition.\n1) Reflecting the non-neutral role of fiscal policy, determinacy regions depend on the steady-\nstate level of debt and they are no longer separated by the demarcation lines of active and\npassive fiscal policy-making.\n2) There exist two qualitatively distinct regimes of local equilibrium dynamics, characterized\nby low steady-state debt (i.e.   (g, 1)  b  (0, b1)) and high steady-state debt (i.e.\n  (1, )  b  (b1, b)). These two regimes have the feature that there always exist\nregions of the parameter space which ensure locally determinate dynamics at `low debt'\nsteady states, but not at `high debt' steady states, and vice versa, as graphed in Figures\nThe first part of Proposition 3 summarizes the obvious insight that the assumption of non-\nRicardian consumers leads to a genuine interaction between monetary and fiscal policy.\nThis interaction implies that determinate dynamics require appropriate degrees of activism\nand passivism within either rule, and these degrees need to be jointly established. The\nsecond part of Proposition 3, however, is a priori not obvious, because it says that the\nlevel of government debt affects the interaction between monetary and fiscal stabilization\npolicies in a highly non-linear way. In other words, if fiscal policy is non-neutral, mean-\ningful characterizations of monetary and fiscal stabilization policies are conditional on the\nprevailing regime with respect to the target level of government debt. If this dependence is\nnot made explicit (and policies are solely characterized in terms of the feedback parameters\nfF and fM ), policy recommendations may well be misleading.\nTo illustrate this general principle, consider, for the sake of exposition, a combination of ac-\ntive monetary and passive fiscal policy-making. Under Ricardian consumers, this is never\nconsistent with determinate dynamics, reflecting the failure of the Taylor-principle in Sec-\ntion 3 in the isolated monetary sub-dynamics. However, under non-Ricardian consumers\nthere always exist certain combinations of active monetary and passive fiscal policy-making\nconsistent with determinate dynamics. In other words, conditional on an appropriate spec-\nification of the passivism of fiscal policy, the Taylor principle reappears for certain degrees\nof active monetary policy. Yet, depending on whether the steady state is characterized by\nlow or high debt, these combinations show significant differences.\nCorollary 1 Active monetary and passive fiscal policy at efficient steady states\n1) Consider steady states with low debt, i.e. 0 < b < b1. Then, if monetary policy becomes\nmore active, the fiscal discipline consistent with determinate dynamics decreases.\n2) Consider steady states with high debt, i.e. b1 < b < b. Then, if monetary policy\nbecomes more active, the fiscal discipline consistent with determinate dynamics increases,\nbut remains bounded from above.\n4.2.2 Inefficient steady states\nFor completeness, we extend the analysis to inefficient steady states, i.e. in terms of Figure\n1(b) we focus on inefficiently high tax rates   (, ) which are associated with debt levels\nb  (b, b). Under this assumption, there emerges a third region of the parameter space\nwith distinct equilibrium dynamics, as illustrated in Figure 3(c).\nProposition 4 Monetary and fiscal dynamics at inefficient steady states\nAssume   (, )  b  (b, b). Then, the non-neutrality features of Proposition 3\nextend to a third regime with qualitatively distinct local equilibrium dynamics, as graphed\nin Figure 3(c).\nProposition 4 extends Proposition 3 in a straightforward manner. Essentially, it says that\nif the relationship between taxes and debt becomes non-monotonic (in line with the logic\nof Laffer curves) the target level of debt no longer summarizes all the relevant information\non which characterizations of stabilization policies should be conditioned. Instead, the\ntarget levels of both taxes and debt need to be made explicit.\nNot surprisingly, if non-Ricardian consumers face both high debt and inefficiently high\ntaxes this leads to local equilibrium dynamics which differ from the benchmark case of\nRicardian consumers in the strongest possible way, as shown in Figure 3(c). To summarize\nthe characteristics of this third regime, it is instructive to focus again on combinations of\nactive monetary and passive fiscal policy-making.\nCorollary 2 Active monetary and passive fiscal policy at inefficient steady states\nConsider inefficient steady states, i.e.   (, )  b  (b, b). Then, if monetary policy\nbecomes more active, the fiscal discipline consistent with determinate dynamics increases\nRemark: All technical results stated in Section 4.2 are derived in Appendix 3. \u00a4\n5 Endogenous labour supply of Ricardian consumers\nThis self-contained section has the purpose to identify the mechanism which leads to\nthe failure of the Taylor-principle under Ricardian consumers ( = 0), as established\nin Proposition 1. Specifically, the Section shows that this failure is not caused by the\nassumption of a fixed labour supply which this paper has borrowed from the original\ncontribution of Blanchard (1985).20 Instead, the failure of the Taylor principle is due\nto the contemporaneous link between the real interest rate and the return on physical\ncapital in continuous time models, in line with the careful discussions in Dupor (2001) and\nCarlstrom and Fuerst (2005).21 Moreover, if being sufficiently aggressive (fM > q) active\nmonetary policy is consistent with non-fundamental fluctuations in activity, resulting from\nlocal indeterminacy of degree 1. The intuition for such non-fundamental fluctuations may\nbe summarized as follows. Assume first that the labour supply is fixed. Moreover, assume\nthat inflation is expected to be above target, triggering an expected rise in the real interest\nrate under active monetary policy. Via arbitrage this implies that the rental rate on capital\n19 This statement is subject to the caveat expressed in Footnote 10.\n20 There is a separate discussion in the literature of how to equip non-Ricardian consumers ( > 0) with\nan endogenous labour supply, as discussed, in particular, by Ascari and Rankin (2004). Since we go in the\nmain part of the analysis with the model of Blanchard (1985), this discussion does not affect our paper.\n21 Alternative mechanisms challenging the logic of the Taylor principle are discussed, among others, in\nneeds to rise as well. This in turn requires, for a predetermined level of the capital stock\nand a fixed labour supply, a lower mark-up charged in the final goods sector. This channel\nis on impact expansionary, and the associated rise in actual inflation may well become\nself-fulfilling under a consumption profile that follows on impact a rising path (supported\nby an increase in investment and output), before gradually returning to the initial steady\nstate.22 By contrast, if monetary policy is passive, such self-fulfilling expectations can\nnever be validated, leading to locally determinate dynamics.\nThe assumption of an elastic labour supply reinforces this logic since self-fulfilling increases\nin the inflation rate and the real interest rate under active monetary policy can now\nbe supported through a second margin, namely an increase in the labour supply. To\nsubstantiate this claim, we replace (1) by the more general utility function\nEtUj =\nZ\n\nt\n[ln cj\ns\n+\ns\n)1- +  ln mj\ns\nwhere nj\ns  (0, 1) denotes the flexible level of individual labour supply and  > 0 denotes\nthe coefficient of relative risk aversion to variations in leisure. Accordingly, individual\nlabour supply satisfies the first-order condition nj\ns = 1 - (cj\ns/ws)1/. Compared with the\npreviously derived set of aggregate equilibrium conditions (10)-(20), the assumption of\n(38) leads to three straightforward modifications, on top of imposing  = 0. First, the\naggregate labour-supply relationship\nnt = 1 - (\nct\nwt\nacts as an additional equilibrium condition in order to pin down nt  (0, 1). Moreover,\nthe two conditions\nyt = n\nt\nt\nand\nkt\nnt\n=\n\nwt\nrt + \nreplace (15) and (16), respectively.23 Similar to the analysis in Section 4.1, the new set of\naggregate equilibrium conditions gives rise to a unique steady state which is characterized\nby the modified golden rule r(k/n) = , as summarized in Appendix 4. For the sake of a\ncompact notation, let\n = \nn\ndenote the inverse of the Frisch elasticity of the labour supply with respect to the real\nwage. Then, as derived in Appendix 4, local dynamics around the unique steady state are\n22 The fact that a self-fulfilling burst in inflation comes together with an increase in the real interest\nrate may be intuitively classified as a dominance of supply-side over demand-side effects. However, any\nequilibrium sequence must always be consistent with both the demand side and the supply side of the\neconomy.\n= wt\nnt\n+ (rt\n+ )kt\n+ t\n, without affecting, however, the residual role\nof this identity.\napproximately given by \n\n\n\ndb\nbt\ndb\nct\ndb\nkt\ndt\n\n\n\n = J \u00b7\n\n\n\n\nb\nbt\nb\nct\nb\nkt\nt\n\n\n\nJ =\n\n\n\n\n\ny\nk\n+ c\nk\ny\nk\nk\ny\nk\nfM\n+\n-( + ) \n] fM\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n,\ni.e. the transition matrix J in (42) generalizes the previously discussed matrix (31) by\nallowing for an elastic labour supply.24 Consider the monetary dynamics of (42) in c, k,\nand .

This difference, however, does not affect the qualitative reduced-form feature of separable\ncapital stock dynamics under a linear labour supply.\nlink between the real interest rate and the return on physical capital in continuous time\nHowever, the failure of the Taylor principle in models with capital stock dynamics is not\na generic feature of discrete time models, as shown by Carlstrom and Fuerst (2005).28\nIntuitively, discrete time models allow for a natural distinction between the marginal\nproductivity of `today' and of the `future'. If one relates the real interest rate to the\nfuture marginal productivity of capital this essentially removes the binding restriction on\nthe return rates which causes the failure of the Taylor principle in continuous time.29 It\nis for this reason that we emphasized early on that our paper does not give new insights\non the role of the Taylor principle per se. However, our result that the nature of local\ndeterminacy requirements varies with the target level of government debt is likely to be\na robust result in models which include capital and non-Ricardian consumers even if we\nintroduce mechanisms for reinstating the Taylor principle in versions of the model which\nignore fiscal policy.\n6 Conclusion\nThis paper starts out from the observation that in the New Keynesian paradigm fiscal\npolicy traditionally plays no prominent role. While monetary policy rules, typically spec-\nified as interest rate rules with feedbacks to endogenous variables like inflation or output,\nhave been analyzed in great analytical detail, there is no similarly rich literature on the\nappropriate use of fiscal instruments. It is well understood that this asymmetric treatment\nis adequate in models in which fiscal policy acts through variations in lump-sum taxes in\nan environment of Ricardian equivalence, ensuring that the joint design problem of mone-\ntary and fiscal policy-making essentially reduces to two separable problems which can be\nrecursively addressed. The main contribution of this paper is to show within a simple and\ntractable framework how this logic needs to be modified in an environment which departs\nfrom Ricardian equivalence, implying that equilibrium dynamics are driven by a genuine\ninteraction of monetary and fiscal policy.\nTo this end, we develop a New Keynesian version of the model of Blanchard (1985) in\nwhich, assuming that all taxation is lump-sum, departures from Ricardian equivalence\ncan be conveniently modelled through a change in the probability of death of consumers.\n27 Related to this, see also the discussion of the Taylor principle after Proposition 6 in Benhabib et al.\n(2001b). In particular, the paper points out that the Taylor principle becomes fragile if the sign of the\nderivative of d with respect to  is ambiguous because of feedbacks between the nominal interest rate\nand production. Notice that in our paper this derivate is given by the term  -( +)[1- 1\n] fM\n+\n, and\nthe ambiguity of the sign of this term arises because changes in the interest rate (in response to inflation\nchanges) affect marginal costs of firms.\n28 Similarly, see Li (2002). Moreover, Lubik (2003), also using a discrete time specification, shows that\nthe effects of capital stock dynamics in this context depend critically on the degree of strucural distortions\nin the economy.\n29 In line with this reasoning, Annicchiarico et al. (2005), using a discrete time version of Blanchard\n(1985), discuss monetary and fiscal interactions by means of stochastic simulations in which the Taylor-\nprinciple plays a significant role. However, the paper does not discuss the role of government debt in a\nsystematic way.\nIf this probability is strictly positive (i.e. if consumers are `non-Ricardian'), Ricardian\nequivalence ceases to hold and government debt turns into a relevant state variable which\nneeds to be accounted for in the analysis of local equilibrium dynamics. Assuming simple\npolicy feedback rules in the spirit of Leeper (1991), our analysis of local steady-state dy-\nnamics shows that there exist, depending on the assumed target level of government debt,\ntwo qualitatively distinct regimes characterized by `low' and `high' steady-state levels of\ndebt. These regimes arise since wealth effects of government debt in the Euler equation\nlead to non-trivial demand and supply effects, which interact differently at different levels\nof steady-state debt and which are related to the endogeneity of the capital stock in the\nmodel of Blanchard. Specifically, our model implies that in the high (low) debt regime\nthe degree of fiscal discipline, which is needed to ensure locally determinate dynamics,\nincreases (decreases) if monetary policy becomes more active. More generally speaking,\nthis leads to the conclusion that, if fiscal policy is non-neutral, meaningful characteriza-\ntions of monetary and fiscal stabilization policies are conditional on the prevailing regime\nof the target level of government debt. If this dependence is not made explicit, policy\nrecommendations may well be misleading.\nThese rich findings contrast strongly with an environment populated by `Ricardian' con-\nsumers, characterized by a zero probability of death. Under this assumption, the wealth ef-\nfect of government debt in the Euler equation vanishes and the economy converges against\na Ramsey-economy characterized by Ricardian equivalence. Consequently, government\ndebt is no longer an informative state variable and local steady-state dynamics can be\nassessed without reference to the target level of government debt.\nAppendix\nAppendix 1: Proof of Lemma 1\n( + ) \u00b7\nk + b\nr(k) - \n= k1- - k - g, with: b =\n - g\nr(k)\n.\nHence,\nd b\nd \n=\nb\n\n+\nb\nk\nk\n\n=\nr\n-\nb\nk\n r+\nr\n(+)\nr(r-)\nd c\nd k\n\u00af\n\u00af\n- d c\nd k\n\u00af\n\u00af\n, with:\nd c\nd k\n\u00af\n\u00af\n\u00af\n\u00af\n=\nr + \nr - \n\nc\nk\n+\nc\nk + b\n+ \nb\nk + b\nc\nk\n(r + )\nr\nd c\nd k\n\u00af\n\u00af\n\u00af\n\u00af\ny\nk\n- \nAssume  = g  b = 0.

First, starting\nout from (18), the evolution of optimally adjusted prices p(z)t can be approximated to the\nfirst order as\nd\np(z)t\n=\np(z)t\n- p(z)\np(z)\n=\nZ\n\nt\n(r + )[b\nps + d\nMCs] \u00b7 e-(r+)(s-t)ds.\nDifferentiating this expression with respect to time, using the Leibnitz rule, gives\nd d\np(z)t\n= (r + )( d\np(z)t\n- b\npt - d\nMCt).\nSecond, the evolution of the aggregate price level (19) can be approximated as\nb\npt =\npt - p\np\n=\nZ\nt\n-\n d\np(z)s\n\u00b7 e-(t-s)ds.\nNote that db\npt =\n\u00b7\npt\np\n t and d2b\npt  dt. Differentiating b\npt with respect to time gives\ndb\npt  t = ( d\np(z)t\n- b\npt),\ni.e. inflation will be positive whenever `newly adjusted prices rise relatively more strongly\nthan average prices'. As regards changes in inflation, inflation accelerates (dt = \u00b7\nwhenever the `inflation rate of newly set prices' (d d\np(z)t\n) exceeds the (average) inflation\nrate (db\npt = t), with dt given by\ndt = [(r + )( d\np(z)t\n- b\npt - d\nMCt) - ( d\np(z)t\n- b\npt)] = rt - (r + ) d\nThird, combining (12), (16) and (17), marginal costs evolve approximately according to,\nd\nMCt =  b\nwt + (1 - )b\npk\nt\n= b\nkt +\nfM\nr + \nt,\nleading to\ndt = -(r + )b\nkt + [r - (r + )\nfM\nr + \n]t,\nwhich is equation (29) used in the main text.\nAppendix 3: Determinacy conditions under non-Ricardian consumers\nAs referred to in the main text, the determinant of the matrix J in (30) is given by\nDet(J) = [r - fF ][0 + 1fM ] + r2fM , with:\ny\nk\n-  -\nc\nk + b\n]\n(r + )(r - )\nr + \n{\nr + \nr - \n\nc\nk\n+\nc\nk + b\ny\nk\n+ }\n=\n(r + )(r - )\nr + \n{\nr + \nr - \n\nc\nk\n-\n(r - )r\n}\nr\n( + )\nb\nc\n(r + )\nc\nk\n=\n(r + )(r - )\nr + \n{\nb\nk + b\nc\nk\n(r + )\nr\n},\nwhere we use from (24) the cashless steady-state condition ( + ) = (r - )c/(k + b).\nFrom Appendix 1, note that\nd c\nd k\n\u00af\n\u00af\n\u00af\n\u00af\n>\nd c\nd k\n\u00af\n\u00af\n\u00af\n\u00af\nand  =   1 = 0, according to (44).
