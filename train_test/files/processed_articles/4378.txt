    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe literature review examines globalization and landscape architecture as discourse, samples its various meanings, and\nproposes methods to identify and contextualize its specific literature. Methodologically, the review surveys published articles\nand books by leading authors and within the WorldCat.org Database associated with landscape architecture and globalization,\nanalyzing survey results for comprehensive conceptual and co-relational frameworks. Three \"higher order\" dimensions\nframe the review's conceptual organization, facilitating the organization of subordinate/subtopical areas of interest useful for\ncomparative analysis. Comparative analysis of the literature suggests an uneven clustering of discipline-related subject matter\nacross the literature's \"higher order\" dimensions, with a much smaller body of literature related to landscape architecture\nconfined primarily to topics associated with the dispersion of global phenomena. A subcomponent of this smaller body\nof literature is associated with other fields of study, but inferentially related to landscape architecture. The review offers\nseparate references and bibliographies for globalization literature in general and globalization and landscape architecture\nliterature, specifically.\n",
    "reduced_content": "sgo.sagepub.com\nArticle\nInterest in globalization over the last several decades has\nprompted extensive related research and publication in the\nfields of, economics, political science, sociology, public\nhealth, geography, anthropology, education, and within the\ndesign and planning professions. With the increasing research\nand publication during this period, more detailed definitions\nof globalization have emerged, often according to political\nand social perspective, organizational mission, and disciplin-\nary context. Globalization, as a research topic, has also\nprompted considerable anecdotal discourse within the disci-\npline of landscape architecture, including the development of\nan emerging body of critical thought concerning globaliza-\ntion relevant to landscape architecture practice, education,\nand research. For example, Thayer (2008) speaks of a petro-\nchemically and technologically dominated landscape\nincreasingly separated by vanishing resources at a local level\nand interconnected through culture at a global level. Ndubisi\n(2008) proposes planning and design theory derived from\nideas of sustainable regionalism, theories of natural regional-\nism, and of critical regionalism in response to metropolitan\ngrowth and globalization. Bowring, Donald, and Liu, in turn,\nhave described the influence of hegemonic global visual\nrealms, the global export of cultural identity, and the loss of\ncultural consistency in landscape architecture (Licka &\nRoehr, 2008). Despite the interest and anecdotal reference,\nhowever, no work to date has either identified or situated\ncontemporary discourse concerning globalization and\nlandscape architecture within the larger body of literature on\nglobalization. Accordingly, this article offers a review of\ncontemporary literature, identifying and describing the prin-\ncipal areas of discourse related to globalization in general,\nand its intersection with contemporary discourse in land-\nscape architecture.\nMethod\nBecause globalization has been a topic of discussion for\nmore than three decades; because its related discourses have\nbecome extensive in scope, bridging disciplinary boundaries\nand geographic contexts; and because so little work has been\ndevoted to comprehensive reviews of the topic, this review\nincorporates methods consistent with what Fiss and Hirsch\n(2005) describe as a framing process for conceptual organi-\nzation. As such, the review traces the emergence of global-\nization as discourse, samples its various emerging meanings,\nand proposes methods to identify and contextualize the spe-\ncific literature related to globalization and landscape\narchitecture.\nHewitt\n1Clemson University, SC, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nRobert R.

Hewitt1\n Keywords\nglobalization, landscape architecture, literature review, bibliography\n2 SAGE Open\nIn light of the fact that the literature on globalization is\nboth multidisciplinary and discipline specific, the review\nexamines the existing literature comprehensively, and cate-\ngoricallyspecifictolandscapearchitecture.Methodologically,\nthe review surveys published articles and books within the\nWorldCat.org Database using terms related to globalization,\nin turn analyzing the identified literature for comprehensive\nconceptual and co-relational frameworks.\nResults\nGlobalization: Definitions and Conceptual\nOrganization\nFour general definitions are useful in describing globaliza-\ntion more broadly: The Oxford English Dictionary defines\nglobalization as \"the act of globalizing\"; from the noun\n\"global\": meaning, \"pertaining to or involving the whole\nworld,\" \"worldwide,\" \"universal\" (Oxford English\nThe World Trade Organization (WTO) Director-General,\nGlobalization can be defined as an historical stage of accelerated\nexpansion of market capitalism, like the one experienced in the\n19th century with the industrial revolution. It is a fundamental\ntransformation in societies because of the recent technological\nrevolution which has led to a recombining of the economic and\nsocial forces on a new territorial dimension (see http://www.\nwto.org/english/news_e/sppl_e/sppl16_e.htm).\nThe United Nations Poverty and Development Division\n(1999) adds that \"[w]hile the definition of globalization var-\nies with the context of analysis, it generally refers to an\nincreasing interaction across national boundaries that affects\nmany aspects of life: economic, social, cultural, and\npolitical.\"\nAnd the World Health Organization (2006) states\nGlobalization, or the increased interconnectedness and\ninterdependence of people and countries, is generally understood\nto include two interrelated elements: the opening of borders to\nincreasingly fast flows of goods, services, finance, people and\nideasacrossinternationalborders;andthechangesininstitutional\nand policy regimes at the international and national levels that\nfacilitate or promote such flows. It is recognized that\nglobalization has both positive and negative impacts on\ndevelopment.\nA brief review of the literature concerning the history of\nglobalization suggests ongoing processes of globalization,\nwhich have persisted from ancient through contemporary\nperiods. For example, Hirst and Thompson (1999) describe\neconomic globalization as a continuation of economic inter-\nnationalization originating in the Industrial Revolution.\nHopkins (2002), examining a much longer period, suggests\nthat globalization is ancient: citing evidence of technologi-\ncal, social, and intellectual interconnections well beyond the\nlocal or national level occurring over millennia in many parts\nof the world. Cited examples of such connections are found\nin the literature related to the diffusion of religious thought,\nthe expansion of political/military hegemony, and the socio-\ncultural acceptance of agricultural and technological innova-\ntion. Anecdotal discipline-related research concerning the\nantiquity of \"sprawl,\" the global plant trade, immigration of\nlandscape architects throughout the West during the 18th and\n19th centuries, and the globalization of contemporary land-\nscape architecture also suggest interrelationships between\nglobalization and landscape architecture over many centuries\nFiss and Hirsch (2005) trace the development and use of\nthe term globalization to the early 1970s, suggesting that\nwhile scholarly discourse on the topic has increased both in\namount and complexity, little consensus seems to exist con-\ncerning its definitive boundaries, limitations, and scope.\nGiven this context, they suggest that discourse surrounding\nglobalization still demands considerable interpretation,\nincluding the recognition of coexistence and co-evolution of\nits \"claims, its divergent interpretations, and selective cita-\ntions.\" Consistent with Fiss and Hirsch, Fishman (1978) and\nFairclough (1992) suggest as corollaries that (a) as contex-\ntual discourse increases, so too does diffusion across discur-\nsive fields; and (b) that as discursive diffusion increases\nacross topical fields, so too do shared understandings across\nand within fields.\nApreliminary review of the literature, in fact, suggests the\npresence of such a discursive context at broader scopes of\nreview. For example, a review of published work in the\nWorldCat.org Database using the term globalization returned\nIn turn, a search of published work in the WorldCat.org\nDatabase related to the term globalization and literature\nreviews noted 634 citations with 634 peer-reviewed citations.\nA brief examination of this surveyed literature identified a\nwide range of specific issues, including topics such as glo-\nbalization and governance (Martinelli & Midttun, 2010),\nlabor in developing regions (Stallings, 2010), urbanization\nand the natural environment (Clement, 2010), education and\nliteracy (J. Brooks & Normore, 2010), finance and invest-\nment (Schularick & Steger, 2010), and politics and media\nreform (Waisbord, 2010), among many others. No compre-\nhensive literature reviews of the topic of globalization, how-\never, were evidenced in that year's literature, and no such\nreviews were identified in the previous decade.\nOperationally, the absence of existing comprehensive\nreviews suggests the worth of preliminary legible and useful\norganizational structure capable of both interpretation over\ntime, and correlation of shared and unique issues and subject\nmatter. Accordingly, such comprehensive reviews\nshould (a) illustrate a hierarchy of more broadly shared\ndiscursive concepts and specific topics, (b) elaborate a range\nof subcategories capable of relating broader concepts of glo-\nbalization with specific topics, and (c) provide relevant cor-\nrelations between shared issues and topics across the\ndiscursive subcategories. Please see Figure 1 for an illustra-\ntion of this conceptual organizational structure.\nGlobalization: Topical Discourse and Leading\nAuthors\nGiven the above suppositions, a brief review of topical dis-\ncourse among leading authors on globalization offers a start-\ning point for the establishment of broadly shared discursive\ntopics, subtopics, and relevant issues suitable for the kind of\nframing contemplated by Fisch et al.\nI.\nSaskia Sassen's work on globalization, for example,\naddresses topical discourse closely related to migra-\ntion policy and governance, the emergence of politi-\ncal space, counter-globalization social movements,\nand globally networked cities. Her identification of\n\"global cities,\" as multiple postindustrial, socially and\neconomically polarized urban nodes, and their influ-\nence on traditional nation states suggests broader top-\nicsofglobalurbanismandnation-statetransformations.\nSignificant subtopics within her work address global\ncapital formation and information flows, transforma-\ntive technology, and increasing social inequity result-\ning from globalization. Her work correlates well with\ndiscourse originating in multiple disciplines, which\ninclude cultural and literary studies, feminist theory,\npolitical economics, sociology, and political science.\nArjun Appadurai examines issues of globalization\nclosely related to cultural processes, ethnographic\ninquiry, and the social influence of media, technol-\nogy, and finance. Topical discourse within his work\naddresses ideas of imagination as a social force in the\ndevelopment of identity, of nation-state transforma-\ntion influenced by mass migration, of electronic\nmediation of material culture and consumption, and\nof multiculturalism. His work bridges discursive\nboundaries related to the disciplines of the social sci-\nences, communication studies, political economics,\nand anthropology.\nZygmunt Bauman's elaboration of globalization\naddresses postmodern social dislocation within the\nbroader discourse of changing global boundaries,\ninstitutions, political loyalties, personal security, and\neconomic life. Significant themes evident in his work\nemphasize aspects of economic individualism, social\npolarization, placelessness, spatial segregation, secu-\nrity, and poverty. Like Sassen and Appadurai, his\nFigure 1. Conceptual organizational review structure.\n4 SAGE Open\nwork correlates closely with discourses originating in\nthe disciplines of the social science and political\neconomics.\nUlrich Beck extends the topical discourse of global-\nization to issues of modernization, ecological change,\nand individualism. His contributions to this discourse\ninclude the concepts of \"risk societies,\" and \"reflexive\nmodernization.\" Both concepts contemplate modern-\nization in terms of technological change in work and\nsocial organizations, individual lifestyle, political\nrepression, and social participation. Principal assump-\ntions underlying these concepts suggest the decline of\nthe nation-state as a result of economic and cultural\nglobalization, and the emergence of wide-spread eco-\nlogical crisis and environmental risk as predominant\nbyproducts. Specific subtopics addressed in his writ-\nings include the origins of transnational social space,\neconomic internationalization, reorientation of educa-\ntion, migration and networked economies, the femini-\nzation and naturalization of society, and the diffusion\nof cosmopolitan society. His work broadly correlates\nwith discourse derived from political economics, the\nsocial sciences, environmental sciences, communica-\ntion studies, and cultural studies.\nV.\nMichael Featherstone addresses topical areas related\nto counter-globalization, mobility, transnational net-\nworks, and global/local cultural identities. While the\nbroader themes of his work reflect preoccupations\nwith sociocultural reproduction and transformation,\nparticularly noteworthy subtopics in his work address\nculture as a world system, and international develop-\nment policy. Preoccupations with the sociocultural\naspects of globalization address the transformation of\nnational identity, cosmopolitan culture, transborder\ncultural conflict, global cultural economy, and the\nglobalization of diversity. Consistent with aspects of\nSassen, Appadurai, Bauman, and Beck, his work\nbroadly correlates with discourse associated with the\nsocial sciences, political science, economics, and cul-\ntural studies.\nWalden Bello contributes to globalization discourse\nassociated with the role of market-oriented, transna-\ntional corporations, capital formation, and reform of\nglobal financial management organizations. Themes\nin his work associated with economic globalization\naddress bridging the world economy, regional coun-\nter-globalization development strategies, and state\nfood security. Important subtopics within his work\nexamine geo-economic competition and sustainable\ndevelopment, democracy and civic society, agricul-\nture and the food industry. His work broadly corre-\nlates with discourse in the social sciences, economics,\npolitical economics, agricultural economics, economic\ndevelopment, and cultural studies.\nNoted author, Manuel Castells extends globaliza-\ntion discourse to the relationship between informa-\ntion and communications technology, urban\nsociology, culture, and political economy. Castells'\nconcept of the \"space of flows\" describes aspects\nof these relationships, describing urban concentra-\ntions of economy, society, and culture, transformed\nby increasingly horizontal information communi-\ncations networks, expressions of personal identity,\nand continually changing cultural context. His con-\ncept of \"the fourth world\" describes groups of\nexcluded urban subpopulations typically identified\nas nomads, subsistence farmers, and the hyper\npoor. Castells's work broadly correlates with dis-\ncourse in the social sciences, political economics,\ntechnology, communication studies, and urban\nstudies.\nSociologist David Held offers worthwhile contri-\nbutions to the discourse on globalization, national\nand international politics, global political interrela-\ntionships related to leadership, multilateralism, and\nglobal governance. Noted subtopics in his work\naddress the changing nature of the modern state,\ndemocracy, sovereignty, social justice, sustainabil-\nity, and cosmopolitanism. His work correlates\nbroadly with discourse in the social sciences and\npolitical science.\nEconomist Joseph Eugene Stiglitz offers topical\ndiscourse on the management of globalization,\nglobal economic inequities, and the role of pollu-\ntion in economic and political destabilization.\nThemes in Stiglitz's work address institutional\ntransparency, economic opportunity, economic cri-\nses, incomplete information markets, monetary, fis-\ncal, tax and trade policies, and economic\ncompetition. His work correlates broadly with\npolitical economics and economics.\nGlobalization: Framing Three Broad Dimensions\nand Their Subcomponents\nWhile consistent with the brief WorldCat.org Database liter-\nature survey in the section \"Globalization: Definitions and\nConceptual Organization,\" the prominent authors survey\nidentifies wider ranges and more detailed elaborations of\ntopical discourse on globalization, including discourse\nrelated to: political economy, governance, urbanization and\nthe natural environment, education, economics, communica-\ntion, technology, social inequity, corporate, trade and busi-\nness processes, global systems and processes, development\nstudies, and cultural and environmental studies, cultural pro-\ncesses, cultural identity, nation-state transformation, mass\nmigration, material culture and consumption, multicultural-\nism, security, placelessness, media and popular culture,\ncounter-globalization movements, resource conservation,\nand global crisis assessment and risk, among others.\nGiven the number and breadth of these topics and the\ncited operational need for legible organizational structure\ncapable of interpretation over time, Bergesen's conceptual\norganization of globalization literature according to dimen-\nsions of (a) political and economic processes, (b) large-scale\nsystems and processes, and (c) the diffusion of global phe-\nnomena, offers worthwhile framing structures for several\ndimensions of globalization correlate well with what Fiss\nand Hirsch describe as \"higher order\" dimensions as a basis\nfor framing discursive analysis. The use of such higher order\ndimensions facilitates broad-based organizations of existing\nliterature into a hierarchy of subordinate/subtopical areas of\ninterest useful for comparative analysis in a literature review.\nAnd this organizational framework facilitates the use of\nwidely available databases such as WorldCat to identify and\ncorrelate contemporary globalization literature. Because\nWorldCat is widely available as a database, a consistent com-\nprehensive longitudinal literature review is also possible by\ndifferent authors over long periods of time.\nDimensions of globalization: Political-economic processes.A\nsearch of literature in the WorldCat.org Database related to\nBergesen's first dimension of globalization and political-\neconomic processes returned 21.721 citations, of which\n11,344 were peer-reviewed articles. A brief review of the\nsubject matter available from this search provided five prin-\ncipal clusters of discourse related to (a) flows of trade and\nproduction between countries (Dicken, 1998), (b) intensifi-\ncation of economic competition (Abedian & Biggs, 1998),\n(c) internationalization of corporate production and sales (K.\nLee & Carter, 2005), (d) global governance based on multi-\nlateralism or internationalism (Kyoto Protocol, Rio Agree-\nment, North American Free Trade Agreement), and (e) the\ngrowing interdependence of existing states (Keohane, 1998).\nThese five clusters, in turn, exhibited subtopical framing,\nwhich can be elaborated within the following subtopical\nreviews.\nDiscourse Cluster 1: Flows of trade and production between\ncountries.A search of the WorldCat.org Database related\nto globalization, flows of trade, and production between\npeer-reviewed articles, concerning its economic, social, and\nenvironmental issues. Specific contours evident in the litera-\nture related to its economic issues, address business, geog-\nraphy, natural resources governance and law, specifically\n(a) globalization and theories of trade, and the geography\nof trade and production (Kamiski & Ng, 2001); (b) trade-\nrelated labor and rights, informal institutions, price fixing\nand international cartels, intellectual property, and interna-\ntional services (Choi & Harrigan, 2003); as well as (c) trade\ncontrols, and bilateral trade wars (Fatemi, 1997).\nPublished work concerning the environmental and social\naspects of this topical area broadly addresses (a) national\ngovernance and social justice and (b) public health, the envi-\nronment, agriculture, and security. Bandy and Baldwin pro-\nvide exemplary studies related to the conflict and social\njustice aspects within this work in their examination of trans-\nnational social movements, transnational environmental jus-\ntice, and transnational campaigns against child labor (e.g.,\nand the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United\nNations (FAO) offer worthwhile examples of literature in\nthis cluster related to public health and security, including\ntrade in public services and the influence of transnational\ncommodities and natural resource corporations (Taylor &\nThomas, 1999); and food system transformation, bioengi-\nneered products, rural migration, changes in diet and nutri-\ntion, and the spread of communicable disease (FAO, 2004).\nDiscourse Cluster 2: Intensification of economic competi-\ntion.

The contours of this clustered discourse\nappear to be more narrowly defined than that of the litera-\nture related to flows of trade and production, addressing\nissues of economic competition, politics, technology, busi-\nness, geography, culture, and sustainability. Subtopics of\ninterest in this cluster, address (a) the relationship between\nglobalization, protectionism, and competition (Faruqee,\n2006); (b) intellectual property and competition (Maskus,\n2008); (c) competition between political-economic sys-\ntems, ethnic conflict, and democracy (Mudambi, Navarra,\n& Sobbrio, 2003); (d) global cities, and global city-regions\n(Scott, 2001); and (e) sustainability and global cities (Bak-\nDiscourse Cluster 3: Internationalization of corporate produc-\ntion and sales. Publications related to the internationalization\nof corporate production and sales are also rather narrowly\nfocused, addressing issues of global commerce and busi-\nness, economic geography, and technology.

Discourse in this cluster to date\naddressed issues related to change in regional, national, and\ninternational relationships related to law, society, economics,\nculture, politics, security, and the environment. Specific sub-\ntopics within the literature address (a) global governance and\nregional integration of trade and investment, conflict pre-\nvention and peacekeeping, and culture and multilateralism\n(Cooper, Hughes, & De Lombaerde, 2008); (b) participa-\ntory multilateralism and international institutions, multiparty\nsocial action, and mutual accountability (Ebrahim, 2007); (c)\ngovernance and conflicts of interest in international financial\ninstitutions, and socially sustainable institutions (Fratianni,\nSavonna, & Kirton, 2007); (d) multilateralism, and democ-\nracy (Cox, 1996); political, economic, and cultural plural-\nism, (Farhang, 2000); and (e) social environmental change,\nglobal civic ethics, migration, and international law (Com-\nDiscourse Cluster 5: The interdependence of existing\nstates.The final cluster identified within Bergesen's first\nbroad dimension addresses the interdependence of existing\nstates. A search of the WorldCat.org Database returned 1,101\ncitations with 1,103 of the total peer-reviewed articles. The\nsurveyed literature addressed issues of economics, the envi-\nronment, development, politics, governance, and law, edu-\ncation and technology. Exemplary subtopics include (a) the\nglobal interdependence of trade, aid, migration and devel-\nopment (Aryeetey & Dinello, 2007); (b) transboundary air\npollution, regional climate change, management of shared\nwaters, transborder conservation and biodiversity conser-\nvation, and interdependence in \"green\" development (Le\nPrestre & Stoett, 2006); (c) interdependence between trans-\nnational corporations and governments (Buckley & Ghauri,\n1999); (d) interdependence of location, education, develop-\nment, and innovation, and strategic technology partnering\n(Narula, 2003); (e) interdependence, inequality, identity, and\ndemographics (Bonilla, 1998); (f) interdependence and insti-\ntutions, international relations, and international law (Keo-\nhane, 2002); as well as (g) regionalism, multilateralism, and\ninterdependence (Goddard, Cronin, & Dash, 2003).\nSummary discourse concerning political and economic pro-\ncess.As illustrated in Figure 2, the surveyed literature\nrelated to the political and economic processes of globaliza-\ntion provides five discursive topical clusters, which, as noted\nin the elaboration of each cluster above, address 26 subtopi-\ncal issues represented in the corresponding matrix. As one\nwould expect (considering Fiss et al.'s framing methodolo-\ngies), the cited subtopical areas within each cluster exhibit\ngreat variation in terms of their subject issues. Specifically,\nshared discursive issues between clusters address subject\nmatter related to economic, environmental, political, tech-\nnological, geographical, cultural, sustainability, governance,\nlaw, and security contours of this dimension. For example,\nshared economic issues are diffused across the entire range\nof clustered discourse, while social, business, educational,\nmedical, and agricultural issues are more clearly nested\nwithin unique subtopics of the literature in this dimension.\nIssues addressing the environment, politics, technology,\ngeography, and law are shared among three of the five dis-\ncursive subtopics, while issues related to culture, sustain-\nability, governance, and security are shared among two of\nthe five subtopical areas of discourse. Little evidence of dis-\ncourse related to issues of communication or urbanism was\nexhibited in this survey. These specific kinds and the extent\nof shared and unique issues between discursive clusters dif-\nfer markedly from the following two dimensions as will\nbecome evident.\nDimensions of globalization: Large-scale systems and pro-\ncesses.\nThe second dimension related to globalization\ndescribed by Bergesen addresses issues of large-scale sys-\ntems and processes. Consistent with review methods related\nto the political and economic processes of globalization, a\nsearch of published articles in the WorldCat.org Database\nassociated with the term globalization and large-scale sys-\nwere peer-reviewed articles. The subject matter available\nfrom this search suggests three principal discursive clusters\nwithin the dimension: (a) increasingly relative sovereignty\n(Agnew, 2009), (b) the replacement of socialist states by\nmarket-oriented states (F. Wu, 2009), and (c) the weakening\nof state primacy, autonomy, and international systems (Cole-\nman, Weaver, & Streeter, 2009). These three clusters also\nexhibit subtopical framing, as evidenced in the following\nreviews for each discursive cluster.\nDiscourse Cluster 1: Relative sovereignty.A search of pub-\nlished articles in the WorldCat.org Database related to glo-\nbalization and relative sovereignty identified 3,384 citations,\n1,679 of which were peer-reviewed articles. The surveyed\nliterature addresses issues related to politics, economics, law,\nhuman and civil rights, security, social and environmental\njustice, women's empowerment, global consumer culture,\ncapital, and identity. Specific subtopics within the literature\ninclude (a) human rights, environmental multilateralism,\neconomic justice, and security (Newman, Thakur, & Tir-\nman, 2006); (b) ethnic and national identity, civil rights and\ncivil society, and religion, terrorism, and revolution (O'Neil,\n2007); (c) globalization and empowerment, citizens' sover-\neignty, and the empowerment of women (Kartik & Sideras,\n2006), (d) cultural identity and global capital (Friedman &\nRanderia, 2004); (e) sovereignty, territoriality, and the global-\nization of finance (Smith, Solinger, & Topik, 1999); and (f)\nglobal consumer culture, community justice, environmental\nracism, and international water rights (Welton & Wolf, 2001).\nDiscourse Cluster 2: Replacement of socialist states by\nmarket-oriented states.The clustered discourse related to\nthe replacement of socialist states by market-oriented states\nexhibits considerable breadth.Asearch of the literature in the\npeer-reviewed articles. Issues evidenced in this literature\nincluded communications, sustainability/development, tech-\nnology, culture, economics, social justice, the environment,\neducation, security, and politics. Specific subtopics included\n(a) communication and state transformation, and markets\nand cultural transformation (Chakravartty & Zhao, 2008);\n(b) world heritage and socialist states, poverty and cosmo-\npolitanism, deregulated markets, and crime (Sassen, 2007);\n(c) women and the labor markets in socialist and capitalist\nstates (Blossfeld, Buchkolz, & Hof\u00e4cker, 2006); (d) capital-\nism, sustainability and climate change, and global political\nresistance (Anton & Schmitt, 2007); (e) globalization, class,\nand multiculturalism, and educational policy and socialist\npedagogy (McLaren, 2005); (f) socialist models of develop-\nment, and technology, poverty and development (Allen &\nThomas, 2000); and (g) liberalism, consumerism and democ-\nracy, and nationalism and mass culture (X. Zhang, 2001).\nDiscourse Cluster 3: Weakening state primacy, auton-\nomy, and international systems.This last discursive cluster\naddresses issues concerning security, international politics\nand law, education, political and economic regionalization\nand decentralization, governance, and urbanization. Identi-\nfied citations were derived from a WorldCat.org Database\nreviewed. Subtopics within the surveyed literature include\n(a) the internationalization of education policy and security,\nand global legal pluralism (Hurrelmann, 2007); (b) global-\nization, decentralization, and regional trans-governmental\ninteraction (Jun & Wright, 1996); (c) public empowerment\noutside the nation-state, and new forms of states (Boyer &\nout the classical state, international organizations as sources\nof political change (Sakamoto, 1994; Stubbs & Underhill,\ntionships among states, citizens, and education (Popkewitz,\nSummary discourse concerning large-scale systems and pro-\ncesses. Unlike the surveyed literature associated with Berge-\nsen's first dimension, the literature related to globalization\nand large-scale systems and processes exhibits a narrower\nrange of clustered topical discourse (specifically, 3 subtop-\nics, and 19 subtopics) with more shared issues across the\nentire range of subtopics and an equal number of unique\nissues among subtopics, as illustrated in Figure 3. Like\nBergesen's first dimension, subtopical areas within each\ncluster exhibit great variation in terms of their subject mat-\nter. Shared discursive issues between clusters address, to\nvarying degrees, subject matter related to economic, social,\nenvironmental, political, cultural, educational, governance,\nlaw, and security contours of this dimension. For example,\nshared economic, political, and security issues are diffused\nacross the entire range of clustered discourse, while techno-\nlogical, sustainability, business, communications, and urban-\nism issues appear as unique subtopics of the literature of the\ndimension. Issues addressing society, environment, culture,\neducation, governance, and law are shared by two of the\nthree discursive subtopics, while issues related to geography,\nmedicine, and agriculture were not represented within the\nsurveyed literature. As with the literature related to global-\nization and political and economic processes, cited literature\nwithin this dimension exhibits great variation in terms of its\nsubject matter.\nDimensions of globalization: Dispersion of global phenom-\nena. The third dimension related to globalization described\nby Bergesen addresses the dispersion of global phenomena.\nFigure 2. Correlation between clustered discourse concerning the political and economic processes of globalization.\n8 SAGE Open\nConsistent with review methods for the previous two dimen-\nsions of globalization, a search of published articles in the\nWorldCat.org Database related to the dispersion of global\npeer-reviewed articles. The subject matter available from\nthis search suggests two principal discursive clusters within\nthe dimension: (a) the simultaneous dispersion of global phe-\nnomena locally (Hansen, 2002) and (b) the subsequent trans-\nformation of social and economic space (MacKinnon &\nDiscourse Cluster 1: The simultaneous dispersion of global\nphenomena locally.A search of the WorldCat.org Database\nrelated to the term globalization and the simultaneous dis-\npersion of global phenomena locally resulted in 1,399 cita-\ntions, 885 of which were peer-reviewed articles. A review of\nthis literature identified broader issues related to bioethics\nand medicine, society, material culture, agriculture, media/\ncommunications, geography, design (including landscape\nand architecture), and technology.

Unlike the other two\ndimensions, the shared areas of discourse are more limited\nwithin this dimension. Its shared issues include geographi-\ncal, cultural, medical, and communications. This dimen-\nsion also includes the most unique issues, including those\nrelated to: economics, society, the environment, technology,\nagriculture, and urbanization. It also addresses the fewest\nissues, with no literature evident related to politics, sustain-\nability, business, education, governance, law, and security.\nAs observed in the discourse of the other two dimensions,\ndiscursive clusters are more differentiated within the specific\nFigure 3. Correlation between clustered discourse concerning large-scale systems and processes of globalization.\nsubtopics of their cited publications, and exhibit great range\nand variation.\nSummary discourse concerning the three dimensions of glo-\nbalization.As illustrated in Figure 5, the preceding three\nsurveys of globalization literature suggest the following\nfindings: (a) a broad confirmation of the definitions cited in\nthe Oxford English Dictionary, the WTO Director-General,\nthe United Nations Poverty and Development Division, in\nthe World Health Organization; (b) identifiable contours of\na widely differentiated contemporary discourse evident in\nthe writings of prominent authors on the subject; (c) con-\nfirmation and elaboration of these discursive contours from\nWorldCat.org Database surveys in terms of clustered sub-\ntopics and disciplinary issues; (d) evidence of the extent of\nshared disciplinary issues across discursive subtopics; and\n(e) evidence of potential areas for further development in the\ndiscourse of globalization.\nSpecifically, the reviewed literature suggests\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 10 clustered discourses describing globalization sub-\nsumed within three conceptual dimensions related to\npolitical and economic processes, large-scale systems\nand processes, and global phenomena,\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 59 subtopical areas nested within the clustered dis-\ncourses addressing 17 discipline-related issues,\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 variations in discipline-related issues within the 10\ndiscursive subtopics ranging from 4 to 10 of the 17\nidentified issues, averaging 7.3 per subtopic, and\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 variation in shared discipline-related issues across\nsubtopics ranging from 2 to 9, averaging 4.3 issues\nper subtopic,\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 a significant degree of shared discipline-related issues\nbetween discursive subtopics in economics, social sci-\nence, politics, the environment, and culture,\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 minimal amounts of shared discipline-related issues\nbetween discursive subtopics related to urbanism and\nagriculture.\nThese findings suggest that despite considerable growth\nin the discourse of globalization during the last several\ndecades, (a) significant areas for discursive development\nremain within all clustered subtopics; (b) significant oppor-\ntunities for shared discourse remain between most subtopics;\n(c) given the remaining potential for further development\nwithin the discourse of globalization, considerable change in\nits discursive contours may be anticipated over time; and (d)\ngiven these assumptions, the growth of other discipline-spe-\ncific inquiry not identified in this literature review.\nGlobalization and Landscape Architecture\nWhile these general definitions and reviews of the globaliza-\ntion literature offer useful measure of contemporary dis-\ncourse on globalization in general, a review of the literature\nrelated to landscape architecture and globalization (as sug-\ngested previously) poses a set of problems related to its con-\ntextualization and discursive framing. Accordingly, the\nremaining review section utilizes (a) the general framing\nmethodology applied above to identify the dimensions,\nshared topical discourse, and subtopical areas associated\nwith landscape architecture, and globalization as a means to\nidentify and analyze the broadest range of relevant literature;\nand (b) a review of select literature by prominent authors\noriginating specifically within the landscape architecture\ndiscipline.\nAs a means of establishing this broad range of literature\nassociated with landscape architecture and globalization, a\nsearch of published work in the WorldCat.org Database\nrelated to those terms resulted in 475 citations, 350 of which\nwere peer reviewed. As anticipated, the survey identified\nmore narrowly defined discipline-specific issues related to\nlandscape architecture, and a body of literature that was more\nbroadly associated with a range of fields related to landscape\narchitecture (see Figure 6). The surveyed literature, which\naddressed the more narrowly defined issues associated with\nlandscape architecture (dark green in Figure 6) fell primarily\nFigure 4. Correlation between clustered discourse concerning the dispersion of global phenomena.\nwithin Bergesen's second and third dimension: Large-Scale\nSystemsandProcesses,andDispersionofGlobalPhenomena;\nand primarily addressed discipline-related issues concerning\neconomics, sociology, the environment, politics, technology,\nculture, sustainability, communications, agriculture, and\nurbanism.\nIssues more broadly associated with other fields, which\nreferenced landscape architecture addressed every subtopi-\ncal cluster within Bergesen's first and second dimensions:\nexcept those concerning global governance, multilateralism,\nand internationalism, and replacement of socialist states by\nmarket-oriented states. Discipline-specific issues within this\nsurveyed group addressed economics, social sciences, the\nenvironment, politics, technology, culture, sustainability,\nbusiness, education, governance, and security (identified in\nlight green in Figure 6).\nLiterature in the narrow survey sample evidenced discur-\nsive interest in globalization and landscape architecture\nrelated to (a) global cities, communications, and architecture\n(Krause & Petro, 2003); (b) globalization and urban space\n(Guggenheim & Soderstrom, 2010); (c) globalization and\nlandscape urbanism (Berger & Crawford, 2006); (d) global-\nization, identity, and development (Viquar, Broudehoux,\nSinha, Shwayri, 1998); (e) globalization, landscape ecology,\nand sustainability (Musacchio, 2009); (f) globalization and\nurban agriculture (Malaque & Yokohari, 2007); and (g) per-\nvasive technology and society (Kourouthanassis & Giaglis,\n2008); (h) landscape assessment and risk analysis (Calder,\nHofer, & Messerli, 2008); (i) transnational sustainability\n(Keiner & Kim, 2007); (j) ecosystem biodiversity conserva-\ntion (Perfecto & Vandermeer, 2008); and (k) urban ecology\nAs noted, these discipline-specific issues correlated pre-\ndominantly with Bergesen's second and third dimensions:\nLarge-Scale Systems and Processes, and the Dispersion of\nGlobal Phenomena. Specific subtopical discourse was asso-\nciated with three of the five discursive clusters, including (a)\nthe simultaneous dispersion of global phenomena locally, (b)\nFigure 5.

Literature from this\nbroader survey sample related to the urban and cultural stud-\nies field addressed issues, including (a) globalization and\ncultural heritage (Kalay, Kvan, & Affleck, 2008), (b) global-\nization and inequality (Nelson & Seager, 2005), (c) global-\nization and sociocultural meaning (Elsheshtawy, 2008), (d)\nglobalization and material culture (Tilley, 2006), (e) global-\nization and urban identity (Lee, 2008), (f) urban public space\n(Law, 2002), (g) global and urban cultural economies\n(Latham, 2003), and (h) media and transnational culture\nDiscursive topics in the broader sample related to fields of\npolitics and economics fell largely within Berensen's first\ndimension of globalization: Political and Economic Processes\nof Globalization. Specific issues in this surveyed literature\nfell within four of five discursive clusters, including (a)\nflows of trade and production between countries, (b) intensi-\nfication of economic competition, (c) internationalization of\ncorporate production and sales, and (d) interdependence of\nexisting states. Issues identified in these clusters addressed\n(a) globalization, governance, and economic justice (Feher,\n2007); (b) globalization and political regionalism (Camilleri,\n2003); (c) globalization, governance, security, and natural\nresources (Lesage, van de Graaf, & Westphal, 2010); (d) eco-\nnomic development and infrastructure management (Zhang,\nXu, Zhang, Yi, & Jian, 2010); (e) globalization and technol-\nogy management (Kamel, 2003); (f) globalization, competi-\ntion, and consumer values (Zhao & Belk, 2008); and (g)\nurban cultural political economy (Fumaz, 2009).\nThe last group in the broader sample addressed education,\nfalling primarily within Bergesen's first and second dimen-\nsions: Large-Scale Systems and Processes, and Political and\nEconomic Processes. Examples of issues in this group\nincluded (a) globalization, diversity, and educational empow-\nerment (Chun & Evans, 2009); (b) globalization and\nFigure 6.

Specific subtopics were\nassociated in varying degrees with two of eight of the first\nand second dimension's discursive clusters, and addressed\n(a) the interdependence of existing states and (b) the weak-\nening of state primacy, autonomy, and international\nsystems.\nAs illustrated in Figure 7, these narrowly and broadly\nidentifiable groups suggest the following relationships\nbetween the landscape architecture and globalization litera-\nture and the more general globalization literature.\nCompared with the general literature on globalization, the\nreviewed literature on landscape architecture and globaliza-\ntion suggests\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 a narrow group of landscape architecture discourse\nfalling predominantly within Bergesen's third\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 dimension addressing all topics found in the general\nliterature on globalization except those related to geo-\ngraphical issues;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 a broader group of discourse more closely associated\nwith other fields falling predominantly in Bergesen's\nfirst and second dimensions, which covered many\nfewer issues than the general literature (14 as com-\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 shared discipline-related issues between discursive\nsubtopics in landscape architecture and globalization\nliterature that were less common and much less exten-\nsive, which addressed issues associated with: eco-\nnomics, politics, the environment, and culture, and\nsustainability;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 minimal amounts of shared discipline-related issues\nbetween discursive subtopics in the landscape archi-\ntecture and globalization literature, that were predom-\ninantly related to sociological and geographical issues,\nbusiness, communications, education, governance,\nlaw, medicine, security, urbanism and agriculture.\nThese findings suggest, despite the considerable growth\nin globalization discourse during the last several decades,\nand despite its relatively large breadth of discursive issues\nFigure 7. Composite correlations between landscape architecture literature and topical discourse on globalization.\n(note: approximately 450 citations in landscape architecture\ncompared with approximately 34,000 citations in globaliza-\ntion in general), that landscape architecture\u00adrelated discourse\nremains relatively underdeveloped within the larger body of\nglobalization literature.\nGiven the above suppositions, a brief review of topical\ndiscourse related to globalization by leading authors within\nthe landscape architecture discipline offers needed elabora-\ntion. The following section presents summaries of leading\nauthors' discourse, identifies prominent themes, and sug-\ngests significant discursive correlations across disciplines.\nProminent themes include critical regionalism, ecological\nmodernization and deglobalization, ecological democracy,\nthe political economy and landscape change, landscape per-\nception, international education, and landscape\nepidemiology.\nGlobalization and Landscape Architecture:\nTopical Discourse Among Leading Authors\nI.\nSimon Swaffield and Jackie Bowring address a range\nof globalization and landscape architecture\u00adrelated\nissues both individually and as coauthors, including\ncritical regionalism and culturally mediated land-\nscape. In Think Global, Think Local: Critical\nRegionalism and Landscape Architecture, Swaffield\nand Bowring identify significant themes related to\nglobalization and landscape architecture, including\nthemes reminiscent of Manuel Castells's proposition\nthat \"spaces of flows\" are replacing the \"space of\nplace.\" They cite Lane's reference to the transforma-\ntive influence of digital media on landscape architec-\nture, as well as, Yeung and Savage's idea of the\nhomogenization of commercial and \"touristic\" set-\ntings under the influence of global consumer markets\nSwaffield's and Bowring's conception of \"critical\nregionalism\" is consistent with well-established ideas\ncoined by Tzonis, Lefaivre, and Frampton, as well as\nJ. B. Jackson, suggesting a more critical response by\nlandscape architecture to the integration of universal\naesthetics and the technological imperatives of glo-\nbalization, utilizing, instead, regionalist traditions of\nthe vernacular, theories of place, and historic preser-\nvation. Bowring's and Swaffield's proposal for a land-\nscape approach to critical regionalism is consistent\nwith Frampton's identification of the landscape's\nredemptive and mediating qualities, recognizing the\ninherently reactive response of landscape to global-\nization. Their argument for more direct and reflective\nexperience as a means of capturing greater sense of\nplace and region suggests several design concepts rel-\nevant to landscape architecture, including: tactility,\neco-revelatory tectonics, and focus on occupation\nrather than aesthetics.\nNotable topics within their work correlate with disci-\nplinary issues identified in the globalization and\nlandscape architecture literature under Bergesen's\nthird dimension, including (a) globalization, the\ninvention of modern vernaculars, and the mediatory\npotential of built form (Umbach & H\u00fcppauf, 2005);\n(b) the architecture of resistance (Foster, 1983); (c)\npostmodernism and imagery (Docherty, 1993); (d)\ncultural studies and critical regionalism (Herr, 1996);\n(e) phenomenology and place, tectonics, and elec-\ntronic media (Nesbitt, 1996); (f) architectural identity\nand globalization (Tzonis & Lefaivre, 2003); and (g)\nauthenticity and place-based fantasies (Kollin, 2007).\nIngrid Sarlov-Herlin, Jorgen Primdahl, and Simon\nSwaffield address the relationship between globaliza-\ntion and landscape architecture associated with\nurbanization, agriculture, and rural culture. Sarlov-\nHerlin in her description of \"landscape globalization\"\ncharacterizes the transformation of contemporary\nlandscape as (a) a derivative of rapid urbanization and\nthe disappearance of everyday landscapes within the\nurban fringe, (b) a proliferation of \"characterless\ncompensation landscapes\" arising from formulaic\nmitigation of environmental impacts, (c) the aban-\ndonment of uplands and marginal areas in response to\nthe movement of agricultural production to more\nintensive areas, and (d) as dramatic and unpredictable\nconsequences of climate change (Herlin, 2004).\nSwaffield and Primdahl have amplified this dis-\ncourse, addressing the relationship between global-\nization and contemporary agricultural landscape\nchange focused on emerging market conditions,\ntechnological developments, and sociocultural con-\nditions (Swaffield & Primdahl, 2010) Specifically,\nthey examine the way in which the global market lib-\neralization and international sustainability policy\ninfluence the agricultural landscape in Europe, Asia-\nPacific and the United States ecologically, in terms\nof urbanization, biodiversity, sustainable landscape\nmanagement, and climate change.\nRobert Hewitt, Hala Nassar, and Carl Steinitz offer\nconceptual approaches to global and international\nscale landscape assessment concerning the relation-\nship between industrialized societies and environ-\nmental change--including the processes of\nglobalization. Aspects of Hewitt's and Nassar's work\nare derived from ecological modernization theory,\noriginating in the early 1980s primarily in western\nEuropean countries, notably Germany, the\nNetherlands, and the United Kingdom. Earlier contri-\nbutions to its theoretical development emphasizes the\nrole of technological innovation in environmental\nreform (Beck, Giddens, & Lash, 1994), and the role\nof the state and markets in ecological transformation,\nincluding its institutional and cultural dynamics.\nDuring the last decade, ecological modernization\ndiscourse has broadened theoretically and geo-\ngraphically to include examinations of the ecologi-\ncal transformation of consumption, and global\nprocesses. An important stream of thought within\nthis literature examines historically reactive\nresponses to modernization and globalization\ndefined by Janicke as \"reflexive modernization\"\n(Janicke & Jorgens, 2000). Examples of \"reflexive\nmodernization\" include (a) the institutionalization\nof nature conservation, (b) the merging of the envi-\nronmental movement and nature conservation, (c)\nthe growth of more aggressive environmental con-\ncepts and alliances such as the animal protection\nmovement, (d) the advent of \"green services,\" and\n(e) the development of nature values in cultural\nSteinitz's work is especially useful as a landscape\nissues framework for examining reactive responses\ncontemplated by ecological modernization and\ndeglobalization at three overlapping scales: global,\nregional, and local (Steinitz, 2004). Operationally\nSteinitz's framework predicts that the more global\ninfluences expand and regional/local influences\ncontract the more pronounced the negative aspects\nof globalization become.\nHewitt and Nassar (2006) cite Serrano's use of the\nterm deglobalization to describe reactive responses\nto globalization processes, which include the rever-\nsal of negative aspects of globalization through the\ndevelopment of \"more inclusive and sustainable\nsocieties in an extremely unequal and environmen-\ntally-damaged world (pp. 74-77).\" Their work is\nparticularly useful in relating globalization to an\nemerging class of landscapes associated with the\nactivities of international organizations advocating\nuniversal values and cultural diversity (Nassar &\nHewitt, 2004); and with the effects of international\nmedical protocols in response to the threat of global\nepidemic--described by Hewitt and Nassar in terms\nof landscape epidemiology.\nRandy Hester's recent work in landscape architec-\nture is broadly related to ecological sociology and\nenvironmental justice scholarship addressing glo-\nbalization and ecological democracy. Emphasizing\nboth ecological and democratic processes, Hester\nproposes the transformation of urban areas to \"with-\nstand short duration shocks.\" He suggests that the\ndevelopment of \"compelling not just consumptive\nenvironments\" and \"multiple avenues of steward-\nship,\" which incorporate human values, everyday\nbehavior, and participatory action can critically\nredress globalization related to climate change, eco-\nnomic exploitation, loss of culture, degraded bio-\nlogical diversity, social division, and loss of\ncommunity.\nHester's approach to globalization, described as\n\"glocalization,\" emphasizes (a) direct face to face\nparticipation; (b) the incorporation of \"local wis-\ndom,\" and global consequences in democratic deci-\nsion making; (c) a heightened respect for place\nattachment; (d) enhancing traditional culture; and\n(e) the preservation of social-ecological networks.\nHester emphasizes local community interests in\nrelation to global interests and ecological integrity;\nproposing that ecological issues and problems tran-\nscend boundaries, and that democratic practices can\nbe adapted to a wide variety of decision-making\nconditions in response to global change.\nV.\nJames Wescoat suggests a conceptual approach to\nglobalization and context sensitive landscape archi-\ntecture based on Kenneth Boulding's idea of an\n\"integrative power\" capable of linking political and\neconomic power with humanistic values and land-\nscape change. This approach acknowledges the sig-\nnificant but relatively small amount of literature on\nthe relationship of private capital to landscape\nchange, suggesting that the attainment of sustainable\nlandscape change is as much the result of political-\neconomic factors as cultural-ecological factors.\nWithin this broader rubric, Wescoat identifies two\nareas related to globalization: (a) finance connected\nto risk management and innovation and (b) \"glocal\"\nchange. Speaking to the topic of globalization and\nrisk management, Wescoat emphasizes two types of\nglobal land use and land cover changes: (a) those\ndriven by global scale processes like greenhouse\nwarming and (b) those related to aggregated local\nchange.\nWescoat's approach to glocalization is particularly\nuseful in relating a number landscape topics he iden-\ntifies as local and global, including (a) ubiquitous\nnetworks of international tourist destinations and\nvirtual landscape, (b) antiglobal and nostalgic public\nsentiment, (c) the increasing interest in fortified,\natomized, and communitarian places, (d) the broader\nphenomena of economic stagnation, political devo-\nlution, and (e) globally induced socioenvironmental\ndistress.\nCharles Waldheim and Alan Berger ground their\nthoughts on the relationship landscape and global-\nization in economic and geographic processes asso-\nciated with industrialization, resulting in distinct\nurban spatial organization and form reflecting previ-\nous spatial obsolete modes. Waldheim and Berger\nsuggest a contemporary second shift influenced by\nglobalization that is transforming industry from\nnationally decentralized to internationally distrib-\nuted organizations. Explained in terms of logistics\nlandscape, this shift is characterized by vast land-\nscapes devoted to global supply chains for distribu-\ntion and delivery, consumption and convenience,\nand accommodation and disposal. Waldheim and\nBerger's concept of logistical landscape is consistent\nwith aspects of Waldheim's \"landscape urbanism,\"\nwhich suggests that contemporary urban order is\nbest offers the most appropriate medium upon which\nto base urban order for the contemporary city for\nbetter ways to deal with complex urban projects.\nRobert Thayer Jr. addresses globalization and land-\nscape architecture in terms of technology, communi-\ncationsandmedia,sustainability,andbioregionalism.\nThayer identifies the ubiquitous proliferation of\ndigital imagery and technologically simulated land-\nscapes as principal characteristics of a globalizing\ncultural landscape, suggesting that sustainable\ndevelopment must ultimately balance primal human\nattitudes related to \"topophilia, technophobia, and\ntechnophilia.\" In response, he proposes a piece-by-\npiece transformation of our world from one based on\nthe development of landscape, which is local, recog-\nnizes resource conservation and consumption, is\ninterrelated with community-based living systems,\nand preserves essential ecological characteristics in\nthe form of sustainable landscape technology.\nThayer expands on these themes in his description of\nlandscape \"relocalization\" in response to declining global\nenergy resources and the advance of information technolo-\ngies, suggesting profound changes in the perceived and\nactual size, scale, and grain of developed landscape.\nSummary: Topical Discourse Among Leading\nAuthors\nLike the literature identified in the WorldCat.org Database\nsurvey related to globalization and landscape architecture,\nthe above literature concerning contemporary discourse\namong leading authors from landscape architecture is clus-\ntered around specific dimensions, categories and/or topics.\nSpecifically, much of the reviewed work on critical regional-\nism and culturally mediated landscape addresses topics con-\ncerned with the global diffusion of phenomena locally,\nespecially those phenomena related to traditional and global\nculture, the scholarship of place, communication, resistance\nand identity, the environment, and agriculture. Inferential\nconnections to other dimensions of globalization (its politi-\ncal and economic processes) are also evident in the scholar-\nship on political and economic humanism, and on critical\nregionalism, especially its subcategories related to material\nculture and the influence of technology on the built\nenvironment.\nA review of the discourse surrounding ecological democ-\nracy is also largely clustered around topics concerning the\nglobal diffusion of phenomena locally. As with the literature\naddressing critical regionalism, it emphasizes topics\nrelated to traditional and global culture, the discourse of\nplace, communication, resistance and identity, and the envi-\nronment. While the identified discourse on ecological\ndemocracy certainly finds support in broader subject areas of\necological sociology and environmental justice, it does not\nyet appear to have crossed significantly into topical areas\nwithin other dimensions of globalization.\nIn retrospect, the discourse concerning ecological mod-\nernization/deglobalization and the political economy of land-\nscape change are inferentially correlated across the three\ndimensions of globalization. Both discourses address broader\nglobal processes and systems, contemplated in Bergesen's\nsecond dimension; and both address the significant relation-\nships between global political/economic processes and local\nchange evidenced in Bergesen's second dimension. Because\nthe two disciplinary streams of thought are intimately tied to\nthe landscape and local culture, they also find significant\nsupport in the literature concerning the diffusion of global\nphenomena locally (Bergesen's third dimension). They offer\nspecific landscape associated discourse to the lesser devel-\noped areas of globalization literature addressing analytical\nmethodology across local and global scales, and global\nepidemiology.\nCommon threads within authors' discourses related to\nagriculture, urbanization, industrialization, declining global\nenergy resources, and advanced information technologies\nsuggest profound changes in size, scale, and grain of devel-\noped and undeveloped landscape, reflecting global influence\nassociated with broad themes within the globalization litera-\nture. Common threads within these discourses also correlate\nacross a wide range of discipline-related topics such as geog-\nraphy, agriculture, urbanism, politics and economics, the\nenvironment, sustainability/development, communications\nand media, technology, governance, and society. The con-\ntours of this discourse clearly fall within Bergesen's third\ndimension addressing the dispersion of global phenomena,\nand inferentially within Bergesen's second and third dimen-\nsions of globalization.\nSummary: Globalization and Landscape\nArchitecture\nAs a means of serving the needs of further research on glo-\nbalization in general and landscape architecture in particular,\nthe preceding review sought to place the surveyed literature\non globalization and landscape architecture in context of the\nlarger body of globalization literature through a systematic\nreview of (a) the cogent definitions and histories of global-\nization, (b) the works of recognized authors on the subject,\nand (c) the body of existing literature available through the\nWorldCat.org Database.\nIn recognition of Fiss and Hirsch's (2005) suggestion that\ncontextual discourse surrounding globalization still demands\nconsiderable interpretation, the review has addressed inter-\npretation through better defining discursive contours, limita-\ntions, and scopes. The details of these contours are most\nvisibly illustrated in the figures indicating correlations and\ndisparities in areas of the literature associated with its pri-\nmary components and discipline-related subject matter. The\nreview has suggested 10 subject categories of globalization\narrayed in three principal dimensions: the political and eco-\nnomic processes, the large-scale systems and processes, and\nthe phenomenological aspects of globalization, with correla-\ntions and discrepancies between these 10 subject categories\ndenoted across 17 identifiable discipline-related subject\nareas.\nInterpretive analysis of these correlations and discrepan-\ncies, if measured against Fishman (1978) and Fairclough's\n(1992) corollaries to Fisch and Hirsch's maxim on discursive\ninterpretation, suggests that discourse on globalization over\nthe last several decades has diffused unevenly across the\nthree conceptual dimensions. Interpretive analysis also sug-\ngests that the clustering of discipline-related subject matter\nacross dimensions is more pronounced in areas related to\neconomics, politics, the environment, business, governance,\ndevelopment, culture, and education; and that other disci-\npline-related subjects are less and sometimes much less well\nrepresented. These observations are confirmed through\nrepeated WorldCat.com Database searches under a variety of\nsearch methods ranging from very broad (entire text searches)\nto very narrow (subject searches), which lends some measure\nof reliability and predictability to interpretive analysis of the\nTo provide consistent criteria for comparative analysis of\nthe literature on globalization and landscape architecture, the\nreview has followed the methods and conceptual organiza-\ntion established in review of the more general literature.\nAccordingly, the review identified a much smaller body of\nliterature related to globalization with considerable scope\nacross the various discipline-related subject matter but con-\nfined primarily to topics associated with the dispersion of\nglobal phenomena. A subcomponent of this smaller body of\nsurveyed literature was more inferentially related to land-\nscape architecture, but more closely related to other fields. In\nshort, while there are not great quantities of scholarship asso-\nciated with landscape architecture and globalization, the\nexisting scholarship seems to address most of the important\ndiscipline-related subject areas, if not the entirety of its\ndimensions.\nAs with the literature review in general, the review spe-\ncific to landscape architecture provided relevant examples of\ncitations available in the broader searches. These exemplars\nare cited in the sections on references and bibliography, and\nshould be considered (for purposes of the review) samples of\nthe scholarship available within the larger database of more\nthan 30,000 citations. Separate references and bibliographies\nare included for globalization literature in general and glo-\nbalization and landscape architecture literature, specifically.\nAreference list of significant works in landscape architecture\nis also included to complement the review of prominent\nauthor's discourse on landscape architecture and\nglobalization. As a whole, this list of references is intended\nto complement and contextualize extant discourse on land-\nscape architecture and globalization, as well as provide cor-\nrelation between the more general literature on\nglobalization.\nAs such, it provides a significant source of data and ana-\nlytical methods, which remain useful to students of the sub-\nject, scholars interested in the relationship between the\nbroader topic and landscape architecture, as well as a more\ngeneral scholarly audience. Its methods are easily repeated\nand verifiable, and its sources and authors should remain\ncurrent for well in to the foreseeable future, as the cited work\nspans decades and is derived from relatively large data sets,\nwhich are unlikely to change appreciably.\n"
