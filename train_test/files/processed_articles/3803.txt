    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe purpose of this study was to explore an extended interpersonal model of health anxiety, according to which health-\nanxious individuals are trapped in a vicious circle of health-related reassurance-seeking, alienation from others, and worry\nabout health, while somatic absorption with body sensations, insecure attachment, neuroticism, safety-seeking behaviors, and\nmedical services utilization were also included in the model. Data were collected from 196 Greek university students using\nstandardized instruments. Results indicated that anxious attachment was directly related to absorption ( = .163, p < .05) and\nalienation ( = .204, p < .05), while avoidant attachment was directly related to absorption ( = -.344, p < .001), reassurance-\nseeking ( = -.130, p < .05), and alienation ( = .148, p < .05). Neuroticism was positively and significantly associated with\nall dimensions of health anxiety. Absorption, alienation, and anxious attachment were related to medical services utilization,\nwhich, in turn, was related to safety-seeking behaviors ( = .200, p < .01). Neuroticism and anxious attachment were also\nindirectly and positively associated with worry. Moreover, absorption was positively related to worry and reassurance-\nseeking, worry was positively related to reassurance-seeking, and alienation was positively related to worry. Study results\nhighlight the key role that interpersonal (e.g., alienation from others) and perceptual factors (e.g., the tendency to focus on\nbodily sensations) can play in health anxiety maintenance, and the importance of anxious and avoidant attachment in safety-\nseeking behavior engagement. Implications of the results and suggestions for future research and practice are outlined.\n",

Health anxiety, as conceptualized by Longley,\nWatson, and Noyes (2005), consists of four dimensions: alien-\nation, reassurance-seeking, absorption, and worry. Alienation\nis the interpersonal dimension of health anxiety and refers to\none's tendency to believe one is ill despite evidence to the con-\ntrary and that others are unconcerned about one's health.\nAlthough this dimension was originally considered to be a cog-\nnitive one, it seems to reflect more interpersonal content rather\nthan cognitive content. Reassurance-seeking is the behavioral\ndimension of health anxiety. It refers to one's tendency to seek\nsocial support for perceived health concerns.Absorption repre-\nsents the perceptual dimension of health anxiety and refers to\none's tendency to focus on bodily sensations. The fourth\ndimension of health anxiety, namely, worry, which is an affec-\ntive one, refers to one's tendency to worry excessively about\nillness and health.\nHealth anxiety ranges from mild and transient to severe\nand chronic, and can be present among clinical and non-\nclinical samples (Langley et al., 2010). It is typical for people\nto experience mild forms of health anxiety; concerns regard-\ning bodily symptoms may be adaptive and facilitate the early\ndetection of a medical condition (Asmundson, Taylor, &\n1Panteion University, Athens, Greece\nCorresponding Author:\nFotios Anagnostopoulos, Department of Psychology, Panteion University,\nEmail: fganagn@hol.gr\nExploring the Role of Neuroticism and\nInsecure Attachment in Health Anxiety,\nSafety-Seeking Behavior Engagement,\nand Medical Services Utilization: A Study\nBased on an Extended Interpersonal\nModel of Health Anxiety\nFotios Anagnostopoulos1 and Tzesiona Botse1\n Keywords\nhealth anxiety, insecure attachment, neuroticism, health services utilization\n2 SAGE Open\nCox, 2001). However, continuous and unwarranted health-\nrelated worries are distressing and maladaptive. Health anxi-\nety can be a feature of various psychiatric disorders, such as\npanic disorder, disease phobia, obsessive-compulsive disor-\nder, and somatoform disorders. A severe form of health anxi-\nety is hypochondriasis, characterized by preoccupation with\nunwarranted fears of having, or the idea that one has, a seri-\nous disease, based on a misinterpretation of one or more\nbodily symptoms (American Psychiatric Association [APA],\n2000). The preoccupation persists despite appropriate medi-\ncal evaluation and reassurance, and causes clinically signifi-\ncant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other\nareas of functioning. Excessive health anxiety places a con-\nsiderable burden on the health care system, leading to need-\nless medical consultations and unnecessary and potentially\nharmful medical tests or procedures (APA, 2000; Taylor &\nThe concepts of hypochondriasis and health anxiety have\nbeen replaced in the recent release of the Diagnostic and\nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.; DSM-5;\nAPA, 2013) by two psychiatric disorders: illness anxiety dis-\norder and somatic symptom disorder. Illness anxiety disorder\nis the one that actually corresponds to the concept of health\nanxiety and is characterized by excessive reassurance-seek-\ning, which is more likely associated with anxiety of already\nhaving a disease, and related behaviors. Illness anxiety disor-\nder is also characterized by avoidance of seeking health care,\nwhich is more likely associated with anxiety about becoming\nseriously ill in the future. Somatic symptom disorder resem-\nbles the current and broad diagnostic concept of hypochon-\nThe present study is based on the interpersonal model of\nhealth anxiety (IMHA; Noyes et al., 2003), which asserts\nthat health anxiety represents a maladaptive expression of\ninsecure attachment developed from adverse early caregiv-\ning childhood physical illness experiences through learning\nintimate relationships, usually with parents, influence one's\nsubsequent interactions and relationships with other people\n(e.g., close friends, partners, physicians). Attachment styles\nreflect the caregiver's ability to provide protection, comfort,\nand a secure foundation for the child, especially during times\nof threat and distress. Although both the conceptualization\nand measurement of attachment style have varied across\nstudies, most investigators agree that two primary dimen-\nsions are involved (Bartholomew & Horowitz, 1991;\nFraley & Spieker, 2003). The first dimension, attachment\nanxiety, concerns worries about rejection and abandonment;\nthe second dimension, attachment avoidance, concerns the\ndegree to which a person feels discomfort with closeness and\ndependency, or a reluctance to be intimate with others. Low\nscores on both attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance\nreflect a secure attachment style. High scores on both\ndimensions, or high scores on one dimension and low scores\non the other, reflect an insecure attachment style. According\nto Mikulincer and Shaver (2003), each insecure adult attach-\nment style is associated with a specific pattern of interper-\nsonal behavior and emotion regulation when a person\nperceives a threat, seeks proximity to an attachment figure,\nand none is available or responsive. Individuals high on\nattachment anxiety tend to use hyperactivating strategies,\ncharacterized by a proximity-seeking effort to elicit support,\ncare, and attention. This strategy involves exaggerating the\npresence and seriousness of threats and being highly vigilant\nregarding internal indications of distress. Anxiously attached\nindividuals use methods of coping that consist of intensifica-\ntion of negative emotions, mental rumination on related neg-\native thoughts, self-criticism, negative self-image, and overt\ndisplays of distress. Hyperactivating strategies may lead a\nperson to adopt a dependent and needy role that impairs the\nformation of mature relationships and to feel chronically\nfrustrated because of the unfulfilled need for demonstrations\nof interest and care. Others may take distance from the\ndemanding person as they feel abused by the person's end-\nless demands for security and care. Regarding attachment\navoidance, individuals high on attachment avoidance tend to\nuse deactivating strategies, which involve denial of attach-\nment needs, avoidance of closeness and intimacy, inhibition\nof the experience of distress, and an emphasis on self-reli-\nance and independence. Deactivating strategies lead to dis-\ntancing coping, attempts to maintain interpersonal distance,\navoidance and suppression of negative emotional states, and\ndiversion of attention away from threat-related thoughts\ninsecurity places individuals at risk for a variety of emo-\ntional, cognitive, behavioral, and adjustment problems, and\nhas several negative implications for distress management,\nsupport seeking, relationship quality, and the appraisal of the\nself and others.\nThe IMHA proposes that health anxiety is a type of inter-\npersonal behavior that is motivated by insecure attachment,\nwhereby expressing persistent complaints of illness is used to\nelicit support and care, and to seek reassurance from others\n(Stuart & Noyes, 1999). It claims that health anxiety is main-\ntained and exacerbated among insecurely attached individu-\nals through a vicious maladaptive interpersonal cycle of\nhealth-related reassurance-seeking, alienation, and worry.\nThis means that when health-anxious individuals are faced\nwith a perceived illness or somatic symptoms, they tend to\nseek reassurance from others (e.g., family members or physi-\ncians), in an effort to evoke comfort and a sense of security.\nHowever, their extensive complaints about their health lead\nothers to perceive them as fragile, needy, and difficult to reas-\nsure.As a result, excessive reassurance-seeking about somatic\ncomplaints is met with reactions of negativity, distancing, and\nalienation within interpersonal relations (Waldinger, Schulz,\nBarsky, & Ahern, 2006). This sense of alienation from others,\ncoupled with health-anxious individuals' perception of\nAnagnostopoulos and Botse 3\nabandonment, and beliefs that others are unconcerned about\ntheir health problems, may trigger more worry about health,\nwhich leads again to the need for further reassurance-seeking.\nConsequently, significant others' withdrawal of support, as\nwell as health-anxious individuals' belief that others do not\ntake their health complaints seriously, may be interpreted by\nthese insecurely attached individuals as evidence of rejection\nor others' unavailability, which, in turn, may magnify attach-\nment insecurities. While the IMHA does not specify which\ndomain of insecure attachment is most relevant, it has been\nfound that anxious attachment may be more relevant to the\nIMHA than avoidant attachment (Birnie et al., 2013). Yet,\nothers (e.g., Stuart & Noyes, 2005) maintain that health-anx-\nious individuals are characterized by insecure attachment,\ntypically avoidant (fearful or dismissing), or preoccupied in\nnature. Birnie et al. (2013) tested the IMHA to check if direct\npaths between anxious attachment, worry, alienation, and\nreassurance-seeking existed. Results of their study showed\nthat, with the exception of anxious attachment and reassur-\nance-seeking, which were not significantly related to each\nother, there were significant positive paths between anxious\nattachment and worry, anxious attachment and alienation,\nworry and reassurance-seeking, reassurance-seeking and\nalienation, and alienation and worry.\nAlthough our study is based on the IMHA, it proposes\nvarious extensions to the IMHA, where the perceptual\ndimension of health anxiety is added to the model, and links\nare suggested between neuroticism and health anxiety dimen-\nsions, as well as between health anxiety dimensions, medical\nservices utilization, and safety-seeking behaviors (Figure 1).\nRegarding research hypotheses, first, based on the IMHA,\nit was expected that health-related reassurance-seeking\nwould lead to health-related alienation, health-related alien-\nation would lead to health-related worry, and health-related\nworry would lead to health-related reassurance-seeking.\nGiven that significant correlations have been found between\nthe perceptual dimension of health anxiety (absorption) and\nthe other three dimensions of it (Longley et al., 2010;\nMacSwain et al., 2009; Stewart, Sherry, Watt, Grant, &\nHadjistavropoulos, 2008), the role of health-related absorp-\ntion was also explored in this study. The addition of absorp-\ntion to the proposed model was supported by previous\nresearch results suggesting that health-anxious individuals\nare more sensitive and intolerant of bodily sensations\n(Barsky, Wyshak, & Klerman, 1990; Lee, Watson, & Frey\nLaw, 2010). Moreover, persons with elevated health anxiety\nmay automatically interpret and evaluate bodily symptom-\nrelated information as being more dangerous than the others\nsee it, indicating an evaluation bias in these persons (Jasper\n& Witthoft, 2013; Schmidt, Witthoft, Kornadt, Rist, & Bailer,\n2013). This may lead to the assumption that absorption is a\nkey dimension in the model of health anxiety and can be used\nas a starting point for the health anxiety process, given that\nincreased body vigilance can increase health-related worry\nand may lead to an increased need of health-related\nreassurance-seeking.\nSecond, as the IMHA proposes that insecure attachment\nunderlies health anxiety, but it does not specify which domain\nof insecure attachment is more relevant, in this study we\nexplored the role of both anxious attachment and avoidant\nattachment in health anxiety. It was expected that both inse-\ncure attachment dimensions would be positively related to\nthe dimensions of health anxiety.\nThird, neuroticism is a personality trait involving the ten-\ndency to experience negative emotions and respond with\nnegative emotions to threat, frustration, and loss (Lahey,\nwith high scores in neuroticism as \"worriers,\" whose main\ncharacteristic was a constant preoccupation with things that\nmight go wrong and a strong emotional reaction of anxiety\nto those thoughts. Persons high in neuroticism tend to\nexpress more somatic complaints because they interpret\nbodily sensations as threats (Williams & Wiebe, 2000), and\nmake negative appraisals, overreact to stress, and are intro-\nspective, all of which may contribute to health anxiety\n(Pennebaker & Watson, 1991). As a result, based on prior\net al., 2014), neuroticism was expected to be related to\nhealth anxiety dimensions.\nFourth, the relationship between health anxiety and health\ncare utilization was explored. People with health anxiety\noften make use of health care resources in ways that are mal-\nadaptive and costly for the health care system (APA, 2000;\nBobevski, Clarke, & Meadows, 2016; Ciechanowski, Walker,\nKaton, & Russo, 2002). As Abramowitz, Schwartz, and\nWhiteside (2002) claim, health services utilization repre-\nsents a central way in which individuals with health anxiety\nFigure 1. The extended interpersonal model of health anxiety\nused in the present study.\n4 SAGE Open\nattempt to gain reassurance that they are medically healthy.\nThus, in our study, it was expected that health anxiety would\nbe related to health services utilization. Except from utilizing\nmedical services, to gain reassurance that they are healthy,\nhealth-anxious individuals may engage in a variety of safety-\nseeking behaviors, such as asking friends and family mem-\nbers for their opinion about their health concerns, reviewing\nmedical literature, and checking their body for the presence\nof any symptoms. These behaviors may include actions\ndesigned to detect a perceived threat, to prevent harm, attain\ncertainty, and reduce anxiety. Thus, based on previous\nresearch (Fergus & Valentiner, 2011; Olatunji, Etzel,\nTomarken, Ciesielski, & Deacon, 2011) it was expected that\nhealth anxiety would be related to engagement in safety-\nseeking behaviors. In this study, the relation between medi-\ncal services utilization and safety-seeking behaviors was also\nexplored. It was expected that medical services utilization\nwould be related to safety-seeking behaviors, as health-anx-\nious individuals would first visit a specialist to be provided\nwith professional reassurance and then turn to close others or\nthe Internet hoping that they would be given reassurance.\nMethod\nParticipants\nQuestionnaire administration took place during November\nand December 2013. The study's protocol was approved by\nthe research committee of the university. Questionnaires\nwere completed during lectures at the university lecture the-\naters, with the professors' permission. All participants in the\nstudy were informed about the purpose of the study, were\ntold that participation was entirely voluntary, and were\nassured of the anonymity and confidentiality of all data they\nprovided. Two hundred fifty questionnaires were adminis-\ntered to university students, but 18 of them were not valid,\neither because participants did not complete them or because\nthe answers given were not as per the instructions of each\nquestionnaire indicated. As a result, 232 undergraduate stu-\ndents (92.8% response rate) from different Greek public\nhigher education institutions participated in our study, study-\ning in departments such as nursing, economics and business,\nlibrary science, psychology, dentistry, and electrical and\nmechanical engineering. Given that our sample was non-\nclinical, we excluded 36 cases who reported suffering cur-\nrently from a serious mental or physical illness. Thus, the\nfinal sample consisted of 196 young adults. Regarding the\nMeasures\nAttachment styles were measured by the Experiences in Close\nRelationships Questionnaire\u00adRevised (ECR-R; Fraley, Waller,\ngeneral attachment experiences in emotionally intimate rela-\ntions. The ECR-R is composed of two 18-item subscales mea-\nsuring anxious attachment (e.g., \"I'm afraid that I will lose my\npartner's love\") and avoidant attachment (e.g., \"I prefer not to\nshow a partner how I feel deep down\"). Items were rated on a\nscale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).\nThe Greek translation of ECR-R was made by Tsagarakis,\nKafetsios, and Stalikas (2007), and Cronbach's alpha coeffi-\ncients for both subscales were equal to .91.\nHealth anxiety aspects and hypochondriacal traits\nwere measured by the Multidimensional Inventory of\nHypochondriacal Traits (MIHT; Longley et al., 2005). The\nMIHT is a 31-item self-report measure of four dimensions of\nhealth anxiety. Health-related reassurance-seeking (behav-\nioral factor) is measured with eight items (e.g., \"I turn to oth-\ners for support when I do not feel well\"), health-related\nalienation (interpersonal factor) is measured with seven items\n(e.g., \"Few people take my health concerns as seriously as I\ndo\"), health-related absorption (perceptual factor) with nine\nitems (e.g., \"I am aware of physical sensations\"), and health-\nrelated worry (affective factor) with seven items (e.g.,\n\"Reading articles about disease makes me worry about my\nhealth\"). It should be noted that health-related alienation did\nnot actually reflect cognitive aspects of health anxiety, but\nrather interpersonal ones (e.g., \"Sometimes others do not\nseem very concerned about my health complaints\"; \"The\nmore I talk about my health problems, the less others seem to\nlisten\"). MIHT items were rated on a scale ranging from 1\n(strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Cronbach's alpha\ncoefficients for the MIHT subscales have been reported to be\nHealth care utilization and safety-seeking behaviors\nwere measured by the Medical Utilization Questionnaire\n(MUQ; Abramowitz, Deacon, & Valentiner, 2007). The\nMUQ assesses two domains of health-related behaviors\nassociated with health anxiety. The MUQ initially inquires\nabout the utilization of 20 medical services or practitioners\n(e.g., inpatient hospital stay, dermatologist, cardiologist)\nover the past 6 months, and if the service has been used, par-\nticipants provide the number of times they have used the ser-\nvice during that period. Total scores are calculated by\nsumming the number of visits across all providers seen. Then\nthe MUQ asks participants to rate the frequency with which\nthey have engaged in 10 different safety-seeking behaviors\n(e.g., checked your pulse, accessed health material on the\nInternet) out of concern for their physical health during the\npast month. Responses to these items are provided on a\n5-point scale, ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (all the time).\nScores on all items are summed to yield a total score.\nNeuroticism was measured by Eysenck Personality\nQuestionnaire\u00adNeuroticism Scale (EPQ; Eysenck, 1947;\nEysenck, & Eysenck, 1968). The EPQ is a questionnaire\nassessing personality traits and consists of four dimensions:\nextraversion, neuroticism, psychoticism, and lie. Answers\nare given on a yes/no scale. The EPQ has been translated into\nAnagnostopoulos and Botse 5\nGreek by Papapetrou (1998). In the present study, only the\nneuroticism scale was used, which consisted of 22 questions\n(e.g., \"Does your mood often go up and down?\").\nProcedure\nGiven that no official Greek translation existed regarding the\nMUQ and MIHT, the forward-backward translation proce-\ndure was applied to translate and culturally adapt the\nEnglish-language version of these instruments into the Greek\nlanguage. The instruments were first translated from English\ninto Greek by two independent professionals; these transla-\ntions were compared and a single translated scale was cre-\nated through consensus. The scales were then back translated\nfrom Greek into English by two other independent profes-\nsionals. The back-translated versions were compared with\nthe original scales to identify discrepancies. Next the Greek\nversion was administered to 20 randomly selected students.\nTen students were also interviewed by the authors using a\ncognitive debriefing process to ensure the linguistic, seman-\ntic, and conceptual equivalence between the two scales.After\nthis process, the final measures were prepared for adminis-\ntration in a larger survey study.\nStatistical Analyses\nTo assess whether significant paths among variables were\npresent in the theoretical model, the significance of the\neffects of the independent variables (i.e., neuroticism, anx-\nious and avoidant attachment) on the dependent variables\n(i.e., safety-seeking behaviors) transmitted through multiple\nmediators (i.e., health anxiety dimensions), was tested using\npath analysis with observed variables. The bias-corrected\nbootstrap confidence intervals (CIs) for direct, indirect, and\ntotal effects were estimated. Bootstrapping is a non-paramet-\nric resampling method that can be extended to designs\ninvolving effects. In the case of simple mediation, indirect\neffects equal the product of two unstandardized regression\ncoefficients, one representing the effect of the independent\nvariable on the proposed mediator, and the other representing\nthe effect of the mediator on the dependent variable, control-\nling for the impact of the independent variable (Frazier, Tix,\n& Barron, 2004). However, using the product of regression\ncoefficients for making inferences about indirect effects\ninvolves implicit assumption that the sampling distribution\nof the indirect effect is normal. There are reasons to suspect\nthat this assumption does not hold when mediation is present\n(Shrout & Bolger, 2002). Thus, bootstrapping has been rec-\nommended (MacKinnon, Lockwood, & Williams, 2004). To\nbootstrap the sampling distribution of the indirect effects, the\nregression coefficients are repeatedly estimated k times with\nbootstrap samples, each of which contains n cases randomly\nsampled with replacement from the original sample (i.e., a\ngiven case can be selected multiple times), where n is the\nsize of the original sample. This process yields k estimates of\nthe indirect effects of the independent variable on the depen-\ndent variable. These k values of the indirect effects are then\nsorted from low to high, thus enabling the specification of\nthe lower and upper bounds of the desired CI. Bootstrapping\nwas conducted using Analysis of Moment Structures\nsamples and 95% bias-corrected CIs for total, direct, and\nindirect effects. Given that a significant indirect effect might\nbe detected even when the direct or total effect was not sta-\ntistically significant (Rucker, Preacher, Tormala, & Petty,\n2011), the direct, total, and specific indirect effects were\ntested separately, the latter being tested using Mplus v. 6.12\n(Muthen & Muthen, 2010). Correlation matrices of continu-\nous variables were used as input, and estimates were derived\napplying the maximum likelihood method. In case of multi-\nvariate non-normality, the Bollen-Stine bootstrapping\napproach to model testing and overall model fit assessment\nwas implemented to derive and determine a corrected p\nvalue. By drawing a large number of bootstrap samples and\nconstructing an empirical sampling distribution for bootstrap\ntest statistic values, the Bollen-Stine p value represented the\nproportion of bootstrap samples whose model test statistic\n(chi-square) exceeded the parent sample's maximum likeli-\nhood test statistic (chi-square) value, signifying that for these\nsamples the model fit was worse than expected. Five indices\nwere used to assess goodness of fit of the model: the root\nmean square error of approximation (RMSEA) accompanied\nby its associated 90% CI, the standardized root mean square\nresidual (SRMR), the comparative fit index (CFI), the\ngoodness-of-fit index (GFI), and the Tucker\u00adLewis index\n(TLI). Model fit was considered adequate when CFI and GFI\nwere greater than .95, TLI was greater than .95, SRMR was\nlower than .08, and RMSEA was lower than .06 (Hu &\nBentler, 1999). Improvements to model fit were indicated by\na decrease in the model Akaike information criterion (AIC; a\nmodification of the standard goodness-of-fit chi-square sta-\ntistic that adjusts for the complexity of the model), the model\nBayesian information criterion (BIC), and the model consis-\ntent AIC (CAIC) that takes sample size into account.\nResults\nDescriptive Statistics\nNearly half of the participants (49.1%) reported having a\nvery good health, while 21.9% reported an excellent health\nstatus, and 26% reported a good health. Regarding internal\nconsistency reliability of questionnaire scales, Cronbach's\nalpha coefficients were acceptable for all subscales (ranging\nand the correlations between main psychological variables.\nNeuroticism was highly significantly and positively related\nto anxious attachment, absorption, alienation, worry, and\nreassurance-seeking. Anxious attachment was highly signifi-\ncantly and positively associated with alienation, worry, and\n6 SAGE Open\nreassurance-seeking. Avoidant attachment was highly sig-\nnificantly and negatively associated with absorption and\nreassurance-seeking, whereas it was positively related to\nalienation. More frequent utilization of medical services was\nhighly significantly and positively related to anxious attach-\nment and alienation, while more frequent exhibition of\nsafety-seeking behaviors was highly significantly and posi-\ntively associated with alienation and worry.\nPath Analysis\nInitially, all paths from the independent variables (e.g., anx-\nious and avoidant attachment, neuroticism) to the dependent\nvariables (e.g., safety-seeking behaviors) passing through\nthe mediators (e.g., health anxiety dimensions) were esti-\nmated. Bootstrapping was conducted generating 2,000 usable\nbootstrap samples and 95% bias-corrected CIs for direct,\nindirect, and total effects. The model had a good fit to the\nTests of normality indicated significant degree of non-\nnormality (critical ratio value for joint multivariate kurtosis\n= 8.075). Thus, the Bollen-Stine p value was obtained to\nassess model fit. This p value was equal to .451, which indi-\ncated that the model fitted the data well, using a conventional\nsignificance level of .05. However, the key to path analysis\nand the model-building process was finding an approxima-\ntion to the saturated model (i.e., a model with zero degrees of\nfreedom and a perfect fit to the data), with fewer parameters\nto be estimated. Given that various paths appeared to corre-\nspond to non-significant relationships, we re-estimated the\nmodel retaining only the significant paths from the previous\nmodel. The new, trimmed, model (Figure 2) included the\nsame set of variables and had no significant worsening of\nfit indices that could take into account both model fit and model\ncomplexity\u00adparsimony, this trimmed model had lower AIC,\nrespectively), indicating a better fit to the data than the initial\nmodel. The variables included in path analysis (e.g., anxious\nattachment, avoidant attachment, neuroticism) accounted for a\nlarge proportion of variance in reassurance-seeking (39.5%)\nand worry (33.4%), and for a lesser proportion of variance in\nabsorption (17.5%), alienation (16.9%), medical services utili-\nzation (12.8%), and safety-seeking behavior (4.0%).\nDirect effects in path analysis. As can be seen in Figure 2, the\nmajority of the standardized regression coefficients pertain-\ning to the paths from anxious and avoidant attachment to\nhealth anxiety dimensions were found statistically signifi-\ncant. In particular, both anxious and avoidant attachment\nwere significantly related to absorption (perceptual dimen-\nsion) and alienation (interpersonal dimension), but they were\nnot significantly related to worry (affective dimension),\nwhile only avoidant attachment was negatively and signifi-\ncantly associated with reassurance-seeking (behavioral\ndimension). All standardized regression coefficients of the\npaths from neuroticism to health anxiety dimensions were\nfound significant at the .05 level (Table 2). In particular, neu-\nroticism was positively related to absorption, reassurance-\nseeking, worry, and alienation.\nAmong the paths leading from health anxiety dimensions\nto medical services utilization, only two were found statisti-\ncally significant. In particular, both absorption and alienation\nwere related to medical services utilization, but reassurance-\nseeking and worry were not significantly related to medical\nservices utilization. The path from anxious attachment to\nmedical services utilization was found to be positive and sig-\nnificant. Among the paths leading from health anxiety\ndimensions to safety-seeking behaviors, none of them was\nfound statistically significant. On the contrary, medical\nTable 1.

To assess whether media-\ntion was present in the model, the significance of the indirect\neffects was tested using the bias-corrected bootstrap CIs. As\nshown in Table 3 regarding total indirect (mediated) effects\nas well as two-path and three-path standardized specific indi-\nrect effects, neuroticism and anxious attachment were sig-\nnificantly associated with reassurance-seeking through\nworry, while they were significantly associated with worry\nthrough absorption or alienation. Anxious attachment was\nalso related to safety-seeking behaviors through medical\nservices utilization. Avoidant attachment was associated\nwith reassurance-seeking and medical services utilization via\nabsorption. In addition, absorption was significantly associ-\nated with reassurance-seeking through worry and alienation\nwas significantly associated with reassurance-seeking\nthrough worry, while alienation and absorption were signifi-\ncantly associated with safety-seeking behaviors through\nmedical services utilization.\nTotal effects in mediation analysis. Regarding significant and\nnoteworthy standardized total effects, avoidant attachment\nwas positively associated with medical services utilization\nand safety-seeking behaviors, whereas it was negatively\nrelated to absorption and reassurance-seeking. Neuroticism\nwas positively related to safety-seeking behaviors, alien-\nation, and worry (Table 2). Moreover, alienation was posi-\ntively related to reassurance-seeking ( = .126, 95% CI =\nFigure 2.

Results provided partial support\nfor the model. Specifically, insecure attachment (i.e., anxious\nand avoidant attachment) appeared to be directly related to\ntwo (i.e., alienation and absorption) of the four dimensions\nincluded in health anxiety. The positive link between anxious\nand avoidant attachment and alienation may be due to the\nfact that insecurely attached individuals with a fear of aban-\ndonment and rejection may focus more on the fact that others\nseem unconcerned about their health, do not take their health\nconcerns seriously, and react with negativity and distancing\n(Longley et al., 2005). Our finding that anxious attachment\nwas positively related to absorption and alienation was not\nunexpected, given anxious persons' exaggerated threat\nappraisal, clinginess, neediness, and dependency. Moreover,\nour findings that avoidant attachment was negatively related\nto reassurance-seeking and absorption, and positively related\nto alienation, were not unexpected. Avoidant individuals\nexhibit heightened reliance on distancing coping, heightened\nperceptions of self-efficacy, blockage in the activation of the\ncaregiving system, and exclusion of threat-related cognitions\nfrom awareness. These findings are consistent with that of\nprevious research. Birnie et al. (2013) have found negative\ncorrelations between avoidant attachment and health-related\nreassurance-seeking, as well as no significant correlations\nbetween avoidant attachment and health-related worry.\nJordan, Williams, and Smith (2015) have also found that\navoidant attachment is negatively associated with reassur-\nance-seeking. To further elaborate on this issue, the inverse\nassociation found in our study between avoidant attachment\nand reassurance-seeking and absorption might imply that\navoidant attachment could be a protective factor for health\nanxiety. However, if we closely examine the total indirect\neffects of avoidant attachment on medical services utiliza-\ntion and safety-seeking behaviors, we can notice that these\nare significant and positive. Thus, higher scores on avoidant\nattachment are related to increased engagement in safety-\nseeking behaviors. In this regard, excessive engagement in\nsafety behaviors is associated with increases in health anxi-\nety and may exacerbate health anxiety by transmitting illness\nthreat information and by leading individuals to infer the\npresence of danger and maintain strong disease convictions\n(Olatunji et al., 2011). In addition, avoidantly attached indi-\nviduals have been found to exhibit a heightened physiologi-\ncal activation to emotional stimuli, although they keep\ncontrol of their explicit behavior, and tend to avert attention\nfrom emotional information (Silva, Ferreira, Soares, &\nEsteves, 2015). By using deactivating strategies, they leave\nthe suppressed distress unresolved; but the distress can still\nbe indirectly manifested in somatic symptoms. In this way,\nTable 2.

A study by Sherry et al. (2014) showed that anxious\nattachment was significantly related to hypochondriacal\nworry, but avoidant attachment was not. Reiser (2013) found\nthat anxious attachment was not predictive of health anxiety,\nwhen additional variables (e.g., childhood abuse, emotion\nregulation, depression, anxiety sensitivity) were simultane-\nously included in regression models. It seems that anxious or\navoidant attachment may demonstrate less influence on cer-\ntain health anxiety dimensions in the presence of additional\nvariables (e.g., neuroticism).\nNeuroticism was positively related to all four health anxi-\nety dimensions. Based on our findings, it seems that neuroti-\ncism exerts its effects within the framework provided by the\nMIHT dimensions, while its effects are not extended to\nsafety behaviors or medical services utilization. Individuals\nwith high levels of neuroticism overreact to stress, respond\nwith negative emotions to stress, and make negative apprais-\nals (Pennebaker & Watson, 1991). This may contribute to\nTable 3.

Moreover, they tend to believe\nthat others are unconcerned about their health, hence worry\nmore about their health, and seek reassurance to alleviate\ntheir worry. These findings confirm results of previous\nConcerning the paths among the four health anxiety\ndimensions, results showed that, as expected (Jordan et al.,\n2015), worry was related to reassurance-seeking, while\nalienation was associated with worry. Contrary to what was\nhypothesized based on the IMHA, reassurance-seeking did\nnot lead to alienation. This inconsistency may be due to the\nfact that the items used to measure reassurance-seeking\nreflect a more passive desire for health-related reassurance-\nseeking, which stands in contrast to the active, incessant, and\naversive reassurance-seeking, as it is conceptualized by the\nIMHA and other theories (Puri & Dimsdale, 2011). Taking\naccount of the perceptual factor (absorption) in our analysis,\nresults showed that absorption was positively related to\nworry and reassurance-seeking. One's tendency to focus on\none's bodily symptoms may lead a health-anxious individual\nto experience worry about one's perceived health problems\nand engage in reassurance-seeking behaviors, while absorp-\ntion can function as a starting point for the health anxiety\nprocess. Significant indirect paths were also found between\nabsorption and reassurance-seeking through worry, and\nbetween alienation and reassurance-seeking through worry.\nThese significant indirect paths may indicate that health anx-\niety dimensions are strongly linked with one another, and\nthat health-related worry (i.e., the affective dimension of\nhealth anxiety) may play a major role in holding together the\nother three components of health anxiety. It seems that worry\ncan act as a significant factor that mediates the effects of\nalienation and absorption (but also the effects of anxious and\navoidant attachment and neuroticism) on reassurance-seek-\ning. The effects exerted by worry are limited within the\nframework provided by the MIHT dimensions and are not\nextended to medical services utilization or safety behaviors.\nMedical services utilization was found to be related to\nabsorption and alienation, the latter finding being consistent\nwith that reported by Longley et al. (2005) that the cognitive/\ninterpersonal dimension of health anxiety was related to the\nnumber of both clinic appointments and clinics attended.\nMedical services utilization represents a central way in\nwhich individuals with high levels of anxious attachment\nattempt to gain reassurance that they are medically healthy\nfinding may suggest that the interpersonal manifestations of\nhealth anxiety are most salient to increased medical services\nutilization. It was also found that medical services utilization\nled to safety-seeking behaviors. This may be due to the fact\nthat, by engaging in safety-seeking behaviors, health-anx-\nious individuals hope that they will verify what doctors told\nthem. It should be noted that repetitive safety-seeking\nbehaviors (e.g., checking Internet for information about\nhealth-related material, discussing one's health with friends,\nchecking one's body for potential signs of illness) may not be\nadaptive. These behaviors can generate much distress only in\nindividuals characterized by higher levels of health anxiety,\ncompared with that in individuals with lower levels of health\nanxiety. Finally, medical services utilization was found to be\ndirectly and positively related to anxious attachment, a find-\ning that is consistent with previous research showing signifi-\ncant associations between insecure attachment and frequent\ngeneral practitioner attendance (Taylor, Marshall, Mann, &\nAll in all, the extended IMHA confirms that health anxi-\nety is mainly affected by neuroticism (and secondary by anx-\nious and avoidant attachment), and that the interpersonal\ndimension of health anxiety (alienation), together with the\nperceptual dimension of it (absorption), coupled with high\nlevels of anxious and avoidant attachment may lead individ-\nuals to medical services utilization, which can result in\nengagement in safety-seeking behaviors. Anxious and avoid-\nant attachment may exert their effects on medical services\nutilization and safety behaviors through different mecha-\nnisms. Based on total effects, while anxious attachment is\npositively related to safety-seeking behaviors via medical\nservices utilization, avoidant attachment is positively related\nto medical services utilization through absorption. These\nfindings may suggest potential refinements in the IMHA.\nStudy Limitations\nWhile there are strengths to the current study (e.g., inclusion\nof additional variables in the IMHA, examination of poten-\ntial mediating factors in the relationship between insecure\nattachment, health anxiety dimensions, and safety-seeking\nbehaviors), there are also a number of potential study limita-\ntions to consider. First, only self-report questionnaires were\nused. Due to this, answers might not reflect the reality of\nparticipants' health condition as some participants might\nlack insight into their own beliefs, feelings, or behaviors,\nleading to inaccurate or biased presentation of their function-\ning (Ganellen, 2007). Moreover, observed correlations\nbetween measures might be inflated or deflated due to com-\nmon method bias in self-report data, representing variance\nattributable to the measurement method used rather than to\nthe constructs being measured (Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee,\n& Podsakoff, 2003). Data obtained from multiple sources\nand methods might offer a more objective view of health\nanxiety, attachment, neuroticism, medical services utiliza-\ntion, and safety-seeking behaviors. Second, generalizability\nof our findings from a non-clinical student sample to the gen-\neral population or to clinical samples is probably limited. As\nour study was carried out with young university students in\ngood health, the results are restricted to the subclinical phe-\nnomenon of elevated health anxiety and cannot necessarily\nbe generalized to the full clinical picture of hypochondriasis.\nAnagnostopoulos and Botse 11\nFuture studies could investigate the extended IMHA across\nother subpopulations, with a wider range and degree of vari-\nability in health anxiety severity (e.g., community, primary\nhealth care, psychiatric), physical health problems, age, and\neducation. Third, we tested our model using a cross-sectional\nstudy design. Thus, assumptions about path directionality\nand temporal precedence cannot be made. Future studies\nusing the IMHA should employ a longitudinal design.\nFinally, while the current study was based on the IMHA, the\ninvestigation is limited in the extension to other models of\nhealth anxiety. Future studies should examine the relation-\nships between health anxiety and safety behaviors (e.g.,\nrepeated medical consultations and tests, self-checking of\none's body, compulsive requests for reassurance and repeated\nsearches for reassuring information) in the context of the\ncognitive-behavioral model (Olatunji et al., 2014; Rachman,\ncomprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that under-\nlie, trigger, and maintain health anxiety.\nPractical Implications\nAs our study is based on an IMHA, we can discuss an inter-\npersonal perspective on the treatment of health anxiety. As\ninterpersonal psychotherapy focuses on how problems in\ninterpersonal relations predispose, precipitate, and perpetu-\nate a patient's distress (Weissman, Markowitz, & Klerman,\n2000), it is plausible to assume that it can be helpful for per-\nsons with health anxiety. Interpersonal therapy is a validated\ntreatment for a variety of disorders, such as affective disor-\nders, anxiety disorders, and eating disorders. Its targets con-\nsist of symptom relief, improved interpersonal functioning,\nand increased social support (Robertson, Rushton, & Wurm,\ncommunication analysis, and examination of interpersonal\nincidents involving care-seeking behaviors that occur in\ndaily communications, and reinforcement of communication\nchange. Interpersonal therapy would focus on insecure\nattachment and the interpersonal aspects of health anxiety,\nsuch as alienation and reassurance-seeking behaviors, which\nactually occur within an interpersonal context. Through\ninterpersonal mechanisms, health-anxious individuals can\ncommunicate their emotional needs and seek interpersonal\nsupport from others to relieve psychological distress (Alberts\n& Hadjistavropoulos, 2014). By teaching health-anxious\nindividuals (via interpersonal therapy) how to develop close,\nintimate, relationships with others and communicate more\neffectively with others, individuals will be assisted in obtain-\ning care more efficiently, reducing their psychological dis-\ntress (Stuart & Noyes, 2005). This can be achieved, first, by\naddressing maladaptive patterns of communication (that can\nlead such individuals to feel misunderstood, isolated,\nrejected, and unable to communicate that suffering effec-\ntively) and then by modifying them. In this way, their sense\nof alienation and their belief that they are uncared-for\npersons, and that others are unconcerned with their health\nproblems, will be diminished. Based on our results that indi-\ncate that alienation may lead to worry, if health-anxious per-\nsons' sense of alienation is reduced, the same will happen to\ntheir health-related worry levels and, consequently, to their\npersistent and compelling reassurance-seeking behavior.\nUnfortunately, the majority of studies on interpersonal ther-\napy have focused on the treatment of depression (Markowitz\n& Weissman, 2004) and somatoform disorders (Stuart,\nNoyes, Starcevic, & Barsky, 2008). Clearly, further research\nis needed to investigate the efficacy of interpersonal psycho-\ntherapy in the treatment of health anxiety.\nConclusion\nThis study gives an alternative view of health anxiety as our\nresults highlight the importance of insecure attachment (i.e.,\nanxious and avoidant attachment) both in health anxiety\n(specifically, absorption and alienation) and in engagement\nin safety-seeking behaviors. Also, when absorption is added\nto the model of health anxiety, results show significant links\nbetween this health anxiety dimension and worry and reas-\nsurance-seeking. This indicates that the addition of this\ndimension to the model provides us a wider perspective on\nhealth anxiety. What is more, results show that neuroticism\nmay play a key role in health-anxious individuals. Finally,\nthis study shows that health-related worry may play a cen-\ntral role in the health anxiety process and that absorption\n(the tendency to focus on bodily sensations) and dysfunc-\ntional interpersonal relationships (denoted by alienation)\nmay initiate the vicious maladaptive cycle maintaining\nhealth anxiety. These findings may be used to refine\nextended models and clinical practice developments in the\narea of health anxiety.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAbramowitz, J., Deacon, B., & Valentiner, D.
