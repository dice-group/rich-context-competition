    "abstract": "Abstract\nThere have recently been various empirical attempts to answer Molyneux's question, for example,\nthe experiments undertaken by the Held group. These studies, though intricate, have encountered\nsome objections, for instance, from Schwenkler, who proposes two ways of improving the\nexperiments. One is ``to re-run [the] experiment with the stimulus objects made to move, and/\nor the subjects moved or permitted to move with respect to them'' (p. 94), which would promote\nthree dimensional or otherwise viewpoint-invariant representations. The other is ``to use\ngeometrically simpler shapes, such as the cube and sphere in Molyneux's original proposal, or\nplanar figures instead of three-dimensional solids'' (p. 188). Connolly argues against the first\nmodification but agrees with the second. In this article, I argue that the second modification is\nalso problematic (though still surmountable), and that both Schwenkler and Connolly are too\noptimistic about the prospect of addressing Molyneux's question empirically.\n",

Held and colleagues did\ndemonstrate that the participants had visual representations sufficient for performing\nvisual matching, but Schwenkler argues that these representations could have been based\non viewpoint-dependent or low-level features, such as number of lines, and proposes two\nways to fix this problem. Connolly (2013) criticizes one of these proposed solutions but\nendorses the other. In what follows I attempt to show that this second solution, though\nnot irremediable, is nevertheless problematic as it stands.\nA Case for Pessimism\nHere is a brief description of the Held experiment we will be focusing on. It involves five\nnewly sighted subjects with 20 pairs of objects as stimuli, constructed from Lego blocks. The\nexperimenters have ensured that the stimuli ``are large enough . . . to sidestep any acuity\nlimitations of the subjects'' (Held et al., 2011, p. 551). The task involves two steps. First,\nthe participants are presented with one target stimulus, either tactilely or visually depending\non the conditions (see later). Then, two further stimuli are shown, again either tactilely or\nvisually. One of the latter stimuli will be identical to the target stimulus. The task is to identify\nwhich one that is. There are three conditions in the experiment: touch-to-touch (TT), vision-\nto-vision (VV), and touch-to-vision (TV) tasks. The crucial question is whether recognition of\nthe original shape is worse in the TV task than the other two.\nIt turned out that participants had high performances in both the TT task (98% accuracy)\nand the VV task (92% accuracy). However, they did poorly in the crucial TV task (58%\naccuracy). After five days and without explicit training, the participants improved from 58%\nto circa 80% accuracy in the TV task. Based on their results, Held et al. (2011) cautiously\nsuggested ``that the answer to Molyneux's Question is likely negative'' (p. 552). The basic\nlogic is this: given that the participants had high performances in both the TT and VV tasks,\nhow well they did in the TV task indicates what we should say about Molyneux's question.\nGiven the poor performances (58% accuracy), the Held et al. conclusion seems to be\nwarranted. Schwenkler's argument is that there is a sensible alternative explanation of the\nhigh performances in the VV task that has not been ruled out, that is, the high accuracy in the\nVV task does not show that the participants already have good enough visual capacity\nrequired by Molyneux's question.\nFor the sake of argument,1 let's agree with Schwenkler's criticism of the studies performed\nIn the VV task, subjects needed only to make gross discriminations based on the overall\nappearance of the stimuli, which were presented from a single viewing angle. Intuitively, this\ncan be done by attending to low-level visual features like colour, shadow and approximate overall\nHowever, I share Connolly's ``worry about whether subjects can appreciate depth cues\nimmediately post-surgery'' (2013, p. 510). Given this worry, the plausibility of Schwenkler's\nfirst suggestion, that we should ``re-run [the] experiment with the stimulus objects made to\nmove, and/or the subjects moved or permitted to move with respect to them'' (2013, p. 94), is\nindeed weakened. Moreover, depth from motion (motion parallax) is only one of at least 13\ncues used by the visual system to infer relative and absolute positions in-depth (Palmer, 1999,\np. 204). These include cues from the eyes, such as stereopsis and lens focus (accommodation),\ndynamic information from movement of the viewer relative to the object, such as motion\nparallax and texture accretion or deletion, and monocular cues present in static images, such\nas occlusion, aerial perspective, shading, shadows, blur, familiar size, and so on. It is,\ntherefore, unclear why motion parallax, rather than any other depth cue, was singled out as\nnecessary to provide newly sighted individuals with depth information.\nWhat I want to focus on here is Connolly's elaboration of the second suggestion offered by\nSchwenkler, namely that running the experiment with two-dimensional (2D) stimuli can fix the\nproblem because newly sighted individuals may not be capable of forming a three-dimensional\n(3D) representation of viewed objects. Connolly invokes raised-line drawings to make his point.\nThese types of drawings are used to make graphical, typically 2D printed materials, accessible\nto individuals who are visually impaired or blind. Connolly's proposal seems plausible if the\nMolyneux experiment were to be run in 2D: Raised-line drawings are exactly the kind of\nstimuli blind people encounter in the 2D context. Of course, it is not really 2D: Raised-line\ndrawings are raised so that a distinction between the object and its background can be made,\nbut the third dimension here is not relevant for object recognition: If the raised-line drawing in\nquestion stands for a pair of scissors, to change how much we raise the lines does not affect\nwhat is represented, though it might affect the difficulty of the task. Connolly's suggestion here\nis not lacking its intelligibility. Some vision scientists might be puzzled by this suggestion, since\nthe most interesting point in this area is whether the blind subjects have relevant 3D\nrepresentations. However, the original Molyneux's question concerns whether there is any\nshared amodal spatial representation between sight and touch, so given this purpose 2D\nstimuli are suffice for relevant experiments.2\nHowever, for a number of reasons, this modification still might not work. As all parties\nagree, in vision the formation of 3D object representations constructed from 2D projections of\nthe object onto the retina is a computationally difficult process, which may not be functional in\nnewly sighted individuals. These patients would need experience or training to use their vision\nto form 3D representations of objects and their environment. Patient SB studied by Gregory\nand Wallace (1963) was able to read the time on a clock, but was not able to judge distance.\nThis case is not ideal as evidence here as SB did have residual vision in his first year, but at least\nthis case chimes well with the current point.3 This contrasts with the visual recognition of 2D\ndepictions, such as line drawings and photographs, which can be matched to 3D objects with\nno experience or training with 2D depictions (Hochberg & Brooks, 1962; Kennedy & Ross,\n1975). Interestingly, in the tactile domain, the difficulty is reversed: Even for those who are very\nfamiliar with identifying objects by touch, such as blind subjects, it is very difficult for them to\nlearn how to associate those objects they encountered in 3D context with touch with their\ndepictions in 2D raised-line drawings. Because of this, the proposal involving raised-line\ndrawings is problematic: One wants to use 2D stimuli because, with regard to vision, going\nfrom 2D to 3D is likely to be difficult for newly sighted subjects; but similarly, and crucially, in\nterms of touch moving from 3D to 2D is difficult, perhaps even more so for currently or formerly\nblind subjects, who lack experience with line-based depictions that are common with vision\n(Heller, 1989). Therefore in moving from 3D to 2D, we fix one problem (that of generating 3D\nrepresentations from 2D retinal projections in vision) but generate another (that of generating\n2D representations from 3D objects in touch).\nConnolly preempts this objection to some extent:\n[A]s Picard and Lebaz summarize, identifying raised-line drawings by touch is ``hard but not\nimpossible'' (Picard and Lebaz, 2012, p. 427). . . . All of this suggests that rather than indicating\nthat a two-dimensional test for Molyneux's question is a non-starter, the raised-line drawing\nstudies point to constraints for such a test instead. (Connolly, 2013, p. 509)\nI agree with Connolly that this task is not impossible: Perhaps more intensive training for\nblind subjects with raised-line drawings before undergoing the relevant surgery and\nsubsequent experiment would do. But I want to focus on the obstacles for this\nimprovement: In the same paragraph, Connolly suggests that the reason why object-\nrecognitions tasks involving raised-line drawings are so difficult is because often the\nobjects in question are too complex. For the purpose of running the Molyneux\nexperiment, using simple shapes such as circles and squares is sufficient (Connolly, 2013, p.\n509). However, most blind children find that even with these simple shapes the task is very\ndifficult, and make many mistakes. There could be many reasons for this, but one is that in\nthe real world blind children are limited in terms of the amount of things they touch, for both\nsafety and convenience reasons, and because teachers and caregivers do not have the time to\ngenerate as many tactile examples for their blind students as there are visual examples of\nobjects in both 3D and 2D. This generates two problems: First, their experience of\nencountering different kinds of things is very limited; Second, and more importantly, their\nconcepts of shape might be different from those of typically sighted people: For example, it is\nnot obvious for many blind children whether continuity of contours is necessary for the\nintegrity of shapes. This should not surprise us, since in Evans (1985) among others, we\nhave seen that Molyneux's question is not purely perceptual, but also involves conceptual\ncapacities. To be sure, this difficulty can be remedied empirically: Those subjects just need\nmore extensive training. But I want to emphasise that the difficulties are more serious than\nsome researchers might have supposed.4\nLooking Ahead\nThe conclusion to be drawn is this: Molyneux's question, at least formulated in a certain way, is\nindeed an empirical question, but the empirical obstacles are more challenging than many have\nsupposed. To say that a question is empirically testable is to say that the very idea of the\nrelevant experiment does not violate empirical laws--such as physical laws. In Molyneux's\nstatement of the question, as quoted at the beginning of the article, there is no clash with\nempirical laws. I said that ``the sudden restoration of sight with no other concomitant issues\nmay not be empirically realistic,'' but it is still empirically possible to test it. In this regard, I\nagree with Held et al., Schwenkler, and Connolly. I also believe that the suggested modification\nconcerning 2D stimuli is a constructive contribution to the discussion. However, Schwenkler\nand Connolly seem to think that, with the minimal adjustments they propose, the experiment\nwould be ready to go. I hope to have shown that given blind subjects' limited experiences even\nwith tactile objects, although it is still empirically possible to test Molyneux's question, the\nobstacles are more challenging than Schwenkler and Connolly imply.\n"
