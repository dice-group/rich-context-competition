Ogden, MS; Catherine Loria, PhD;\nSuma Vupputuri, MPH; Leann Myers, PhD; Paul K. Whelton, MD, MSc\nBackground and Purpose--The few prospective studies that have explored the association between dietary intake of\npotassium and risk of stroke have reported inconsistent findings. This study examines the relationship between dietary\npotassium intake and the risk of stroke in a representative sample of the US general population.\nMethods--Study participants included 9805 US men and women who participated in the first National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES I)  . Dietary potassium and total energy intake were\nestimated at baseline by using a 24-hour dietary recall. Incidence data for stroke and coronary heart disease were\nobtained from medical records and death certificates.\nResults--Over an average of 19 years of follow up, 927 stroke events and 1847 coronary heart disease events were\ndocumented. Overall, stroke hazard was significantly different among quartiles of potassium intake (likelihood ratio\nP0.03); however, a test of linear trend across quartiles did not reach a customary level of statistical significance\n(P0.14). Participants consuming a low potassium diet at baseline (34.6 mmol potassium per day) experienced a 28%\nestablished cardiovascular disease risk factors.\nConclusions--These findings suggest that low dietary potassium intake is associated with an increased risk of stroke.\nHowever, the possibility that the association is due to residual confounding cannot be entirely ruled out in this\nKey Words: cardiovascular diseases  cerebrovascular disorders  potassium, dietary  prospective study\nObservational epidemiological studies have identified an\ninverse association between dietary intake of potassium\nand blood pressure level within and across populations.1 In\naddition, randomized controlled trials have documented that\npotassium supplementation lowers blood pressure in both\nhypertensive and normotensive persons.2 Some studies have\nindicated that potassium supplementation to lower blood\npressure may be more effective in persons consuming a low\npotassium diet.3 Clinical trials have also shown that a low\ndietary potassium intake increases blood pressure.4 Given that\nblood pressure level is a strong risk factor for cardiovascular\ndisease, particularly stroke, dietary potassium intake may be\ninversely related to the risk of cardiovascular disease via\nblood pressure.\nTo date, the relationship between dietary potassium and\nrisk of stroke has been examined in only a few prospective\nstudies. In a population of 859 male and female retirees in\nSouthern California, Khaw and Barrett-Conner5 identified an\ninverse association between potassium intake and stroke mor-\ntality. Ascherio et al6 documented an inverse relationship be-\ntween the risk of stroke and dietary potassium intake in a cohort\nof 43 738 male health professionals. However, data from the\nHonolulu Heart Study did not support an inverse association\nbetween dietary potassium intake and the risk of stroke.7 On the\nother hand, animal experiments tend to support the independent\nrole of potassium in reducing the risk of stroke.8\nWe took advantage of the large sample size, prolonged\nfollow-up, and national representation of the National Health\nand Nutrition Examination Survey I Epidemiologic\nFollow-Up Study (NHEFS) to examine the relationship be-\ntween a low dietary potassium intake and the risk of stroke\nand coronary heart disease.\nFrom the Departments of Epidemiology (L.A.B., J.H., S.V., P.K.W.) and Biostatistics (L.G.O., L.M.), Tulane University School of Public Health and\nTropical Medicine, and the Department of Medicine (J.H., P.K.W.), Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, La, and the National Institutes\nof Health, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (C.L.), Bethesda, Md.\nReprint requests to Jiang He, MD, PhD, Department of Epidemiology, Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, 1430 Tulane\nStroke is available at http://www.strokeaha.org\nOriginal Contributions\nhttp://stroke.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nSubjects and Methods\nStudy Population\nThe first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES I) used a multistage, stratified, probability sampling\ndesign to select a representative sample of the US civilian noninsti-\ntutionalized population aged 1 to 74 years.9,10 Certain population\nsubgroups, including those with a low income, women of childbear-\ning age (25 to 44 years), and elderly persons (aged 65 years) were\noversampled. The NHEFS is a prospective cohort study of NHANES\nI participants who were aged 25 to 74 years at their baseline\nage range at baseline, we excluded 1353 who had a self-reported\nhistory of heart attack, heart failure, or stroke at baseline or had used\nmedication for heart disease during the 6 months preceding their\nbaseline examinations, and we also excluded 2849 NHANES I\nAugmentation Survey participants for whom the study protocol did\nnot include the administration of a 24-hour dietary recall. Among the\nremaining participants, 400 (3.9%) were lost to follow-up, leaving a\nexperience to this analysis.\nMeasurements\nBaseline data collection included a medical history, standardized\nmedical examination, dietary assessment, laboratory tests, and an-\nthropometric measurements.9,10 A single 24-hour dietary recall was\nconducted by trained NHANES I personnel with a minimum of a\nbachelor's degree in nutrition; a standardized protocol and fifty-one\n3D models to estimate portion size were used. The dietary recall\nquestionnaires were coded by interviewers using nutrient informa-\ntion from the US Department of Agriculture Handbook No. 8 or\nother resources. Dietary intakes of saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium,\npotassium, calcium, vitamin C, vitamin A, and total energy were\ncalculated for each participant by the National Center for Health\nStatistics. Dietary fiber intake was calculated by using food compo-\nsition information from ESHA Food Processor software.11 Frozen\nsera were sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for\nmeasurement of total serum cholesterol levels. Blood pressure, body\nweight, and height were obtained by use of standard methods.9 Data\non education, physical activity, and alcohol consumption were\nobtained by an interviewer-administered questionnaire.9 The base-\nline questionnaire regarding medical history included questions\nabout selected health conditions and medications used for these\nconditions during the preceding 6 months.12 Baseline information on\nsmoking status was obtained in a subsample of 6913 participants\nwho underwent a more detailed baseline examination.10 For the\nremaining study participants, information on smoking status at\nbaseline was derived from responses to questions on lifetime\nThe validity of smoking information obtained by using this approach\nFollow-Up Procedures\na participant or his/her proxy to a current address, performing\nin-depth interviews with the participant or proxy, obtaining hospital\nand nursing home records, including pathology reports and ECGs,\nand, for decedents, acquiring a death certificate. Incident stroke and\ncoronary heart disease events were based on documentation of an\nevent that met prespecified study criteria and occurred during the\nperiod between the participant's baseline examination and last\nfollow-up interview. The validity of study outcome data from these\nsources has been documented.19\nIncident stroke was based on a death certificate report in which the\nunderlying cause of death was recorded by using the International\nClassification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) code of 430\u00ad\nin which the participant had a discharge diagnosis with 1 of these\ncodes. Incident coronary heart disease was based on a death\ncertificate report in which the underlying cause of death was\nnursing home stay in which the participant had a discharge diagnosis\nwith 1 of these codes. The date of record for incident events was\nidentified by the date of the first hospital admission with an\nestablished study event or date of death from a study event in the\nabsence of hospital or nursing home documentation.\nStatistical Analysis\nParticipants were divided into quartile groupings based on their\npotassium intake. For each baseline characteristic, the mean or\npercentage of study participants was calculated by quartile of\npotassium intake. The statistical significance of differences among\nquartiles was examined by using the F test from ANOVA (continu-\nous variables) and the 2 test (categorical variables). Trend tests were\nconducted by using orthogonal coefficients. The cumulative inci-\ndence of coronary heart disease by quartile of potassium intake was\ncalculated by using the Kaplan-Meier method,20 and differences in\ncumulative rates were examined by using the log-rank test.21\nBecause the risk of stroke was similar among the upper 3 quartiles of\npotassium intake and significantly higher in the lowest quartile of\npotassium intake, the risk of stroke in the lowest quartile was\ncompared with that in the upper 3 quartiles combined. Cox propor-\ntional hazards models were used to explore the relationship between\ndietary potassium intake and coronary heart disease risk.22 Age was\nused as the time scale for all time-to-event analyses.23 Data from the\nparticipants who had reached 85 years were censored because of\nthe small number of participants surviving in each quartile at that\nage. All Cox proportional hazards models were stratified by birth\ncohort, with 10-year intervals used to control for calendar period and\ncohort effects. The proportional hazards assumption was verified by\nusing time-dependent interaction terms.24 Methods to estimate vari-\nances that take into account the sample clustering and stratification\nof the NHANES I sample were used in all Cox proportional hazards\nResults\nThe baseline characteristics of study participants are present-\ned by quartile of dietary potassium intake in Table 1.\nParticipants in the lower 2 quartiles of potassium intake\ntended to be slightly older and were less often white or male\nthan their counterparts with higher potassium intake. Addi-\ntionally, compared with participants with greater dietary\npotassium intake, those with a lower potassium intake tended\nto have higher mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures, a\nhigher prevalence of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia,\nand a higher mean body mass index. Compared with partic-\nipants with higher potassium intake, those with lower intake\nwere also less physically active and less likely to have\ncompleted high school, to drink regularly, or to smoke. On\naverage, compared with persons in the lower quartiles of\npotassium intake, persons in the upper quartiles of potassium\nintake consumed more total energy, saturated fat, cholesterol,\nfiber, sodium, calcium, vitamin A, and vitamin C.\ndisease events were documented. Hazard ratios (HRs) and\n95% CIs for stroke and coronary heart disease according to\nquartile of potassium intake are presented in Table 2. Overall,\nstroke hazard was significantly different among quartiles of\npotassium intake (likelihood ratio P0.03); however, a test\nof linear trend across quartiles did not reach a customary level\nof statistical significance (P0.14). Compared with persons\nconsuming the lowest quartile of potassium intake\n(34.6 mmol/d), persons consuming a higher potassium diet\nhttp://stroke.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\n(34.6 mmol/d) experienced a significantly lower hazard of\nstroke after adjustment for age, sex, race, and energy intake.\nThe hazard of stroke for persons with a potassium intake in\nthan that of their counterparts in the lowest quartile (HR 0.76,\nhazard were obtained for persons in the third and fourth\nquartiles of potassium intake compared with those in the\nlowest. When additionally adjusted for systolic blood pres-\nsure, serum cholesterol, body mass index, history of diabetes,\nphysical activity, education level, regular alcohol consump-\ntion, current cigarette smoking, vitamin supplement use, and\nother dietary factors, the relative hazard estimates for stroke\nremained the same. For instance, persons consuming 34.6 to\n49.8 mmol/d of potassium experienced a 25% lower stroke\nwith those in the lowest quartile of intake (consuming\n34.6 mmol/d). Again, relative hazard estimates were similar\nfor the upper 3 quartiles of potassium intake. A linear trend\ntest was not statistically significant. Given the findings of\nsignificantly lower hazard estimates of very similar magni-\ntude at levels of potassium intake above the lowest quartile,\npersons with a potassium intake in the lowest quartile\n(34.6 mmol/d) were compared with participants having a\npotassium intake in the upper 3 quartiles combined\n(34.6 mmol/d) in further analyses.\nIn Kaplan-Meier analyses, the cumulative hazard of stroke\nfor persons in the lowest quartile of potassium intake com-\npared with all others is presented in the Figure. At age 85,\nthose in the lowest quartile of potassium intake experienced a\n42.2% cumulative hazard of stroke, whereas participants with\na higher intake of potassium experienced a 32.5% cumulative\nand 95% CIs for dietary potassium intake in the lowest\nquartile compared with potassium intake in the upper 3\nquartiles combined. In age- and energy-adjusted analyses,\npersons consuming 34.6 mmol potassium per day experi-\nenced a 37% higher hazard of stroke than did persons\nTABLE 1.

The relationship between potassium intake\nand coronary heart disease was not statistically significant.\nDiscussion\nThe present study documents an independent association\nbetween low dietary potassium intake and increased hazard of\nstroke and suggests the possibility of a nonlinear (threshold)\nrelationship. These findings are consistent with others sug-\ngesting that a low potassium intake may increase the risk of\nstroke.\nVarious lines of evidence suggest the possibility of a\nnonlinear relationship between dietary potassium intake and\nstroke risk. A low dietary potassium intake has been associ-\nated with elevated blood pressure levels. Krishna et al4\nconducted a randomized crossover trial of potassium deple-\ntion in normotensive men and found that feeding participants\na low potassium diet (10 mmol/d) significantly increased\nmean arterial blood pressure (4 mm Hg increase, P0.05).\nLater, Krishna and Kapoor25 conducted a second randomized\ncrossover trial examining dietary potassium depletion (from\n96 to 16 mmol/d) in hypertensive subjects. Again they found\nsignificant increases in both systolic (7 mm Hg increase,\npressures after feeding the subjects a low potassium diet.\nFurthermore, oral potassium supplementation to lower blood\npressure is more effective in populations with a low potas-\nsium intake.2 In phase I of the Trials for Hypertension\nPrevention (TOHP), potassium supplementation of\n60 mmol/d produced no significant reductions in blood\npressure after 6 months.26 The TOHP participants' baseline\nintake of potassium (78.3 mmol/d, assessed by dietary recall)\nmay have been an important reason for the null results\nobserved. In contrast, randomized trials of potassium supple-\nmentation in participants consuming a low potassium diet at\nbaseline (32 to 35 mmol/d) tend to show large reductions in\nblood pressure.3\nOur findings of an independent relationship between low\npotassium intake and increased hazard of stroke were consis-\nTABLE 2.

Although important, this finding\nwas based on a small sample (859 persons) with very few\nevents (24 stroke deaths in 12 years). In contrast, the present\nstudy is based on evidence from 9805 participants who\nevents. The study of Ascherio et al found a significant inverse\nrelationship between dietary potassium intake and the risk of\nstroke in men (relative risk for fifth versus first quintile 0.62,\nestablished cardiovascular disease risk factors. When relative\nrisk estimates were additionally adjusted for dietary intakes\nof magnesium and fiber, the association failed to reach\nstatistical significance (relative risk for extreme quintiles of\ntrend0.11). Their study was conducted among male health\nprofessionals, a highly select group with extensive education,\ngenerally high socioeconomic status, and a greater awareness\nof health-related issues than the general population. This\npopulation also had intakes well above the national average\nfor potassium. A recent study of stroke mortality in the\nNHEFS cohort by Fang et al27 revealed an inverse association\nbetween hazard of stroke death and dietary potassium intake\nin hypertensive men and black men only. In the present study\nof stroke incidence, there was no significant difference in the\nrelation of dietary potassium intake to hazard of stroke that\nwas due to ethnicity or hypertensive status. The study by\nFang et al examined stroke mortality only and did not include\nadjustment for dietary factors that might confound the rela-\ntionship between potassium and stroke risk, such as dietary\nintake of fiber, calcium, or vitamin C.\nThe present study extends the findings of previous pro-\nspective studies by examining the effects of potassium intake\non the risk of stroke and of coronary heart disease in a large\nrepresentative sample of the noninstitutionalized US popula-\ntion with high event rates. Other strengths of the present study\ninclude the assessment of incident stroke and coronary heart\ndisease over an average of 19 years of follow-up, with\nfollow-up experience available for 96% of the study par-\nticipants. Moreover, important dietary and nondietary cardio-\nvascular disease risk factors were measured at baseline and\ncontrolled in the analysis to reduce the potential impact of\nconfounding. For example, stroke risk has been inversely\nrelated to dietary intake of fiber, calcium, and vitamin\nC,6,28\u00ad30 whereas intake of potassium, fiber, calcium, and\nvitamin C are highly correlated in dietary studies. An addi-\ntional concern is that persons consuming a diet with high\nlevels of potassium may consume lower levels of saturated fat\nand cholesterol, important risk factors for stroke. We adjusted\nfor all of the above-mentioned nutrients and total energy in a\nmultivariate model. After this adjustment, the association\nbetween potassium intake and stroke hazard remained\nsignificant.\nData for coronary heart disease in the present study shows\na nonsignificant association with dietary potassium intake.\nExperimental evidence, primarily in animals, suggests that\npotassium intake may reduce the progression of coronary\nartery disease.31 Most prospective cohort studies, except\none,32 did not find significant association between potassium\nintake and risk of coronary heart disease. In a study con-\nducted in 11 692 men and women in Scotland, a significant\ninverse association between urinary excretion of potassium\nand hazard of coronary heart disease was found in men but\nnot in women. Those data should be interpreted with caution,\nbecause established cardiovascular disease risk factors, such\nas smoking, diabetes, and dietary nutrient intake, were not\nadjusted in the analysis.32\nOne limitation of the present study is the estimation of\npotassium intake using a single 24-hour dietary recall. Esti-\nmates from a single day of intake may not be representative\nof the usual long-term intake of the participant and, thus, may\nresult in misclassification of usual potassium consumption at\nthe individual level. However, random errors of measurement\nin potassium intake would tend to bias any observed associ-\nation toward the null rather than create a spurious association.\nAnother limitation of the present study is that all outcome\ndiagnoses were based on hospital and/or nursing home\nrecords or death certificates. Although it was possible to\nmisdiagnose the subtype of stroke, the clinical diagnosis of\ncomplete stroke should be straightforward. We did not use\nstroke subtype in our analysis. Furthermore, there was no\nreason to believe that misdiagnosis would differ by baseline\nlevel of potassium intake.\nLike all observational epidemiological studies, imperfect\nmeasurement of confounding variables and unmeasured po-\nTABLE 3.

For instance,\na single measurement of blood pressure was obtained in\nNHANES I and used for adjustment, which may not have\nreflected long-term blood pressure levels for individuals.\nFurthermore, repeated measurements were not available for\ndietary potassium intake and potential confounding variables.\nObservational studies like ours provide evidence for an\nassociation between low potassium intake and increased risk\nof stroke. However, only randomized controlled trials can\ndefine the causality of this association.\nThe inverse association between potassium and risk of\nstroke could result from a combination of factors. First,\npotassium supplementation tends to lower blood pressure, a\nmajor risk factor for stroke.1\u00ad3 It has been hypothesized that\nsuch reductions in blood pressure may be due to reduced\nrenal vascular resistance and elevated glomerular filtration\nrate, in addition to the natriuresis and diuresis observed with\npotassium supplementation.33 One study in African American\nhypertensive men indicates that a low dietary potassium\nintake (30 mmol/d) may enhance adrenergically mediated\nvasoconstriction in response to stress.34 Second, high concen-\ntrations of potassium may slow the atherosclerotic process\nand clot formation by reducing free radical formation, smooth\nmuscle proliferation, arterial thrombosis, and platelet aggre-\ngation.33,35,36 The latter effects have been observed only in\ntissue culture or animal experiments, so their relevance to\nhumans is unknown.\nOur findings of an independent relationship between low\npotassium intake and increased hazard of stroke in a repre-\nsentative sample of the US population have important clinical\nand public health implications. Stroke is the third leading\ncause of death and the leading basis for long-term disability\nin the United States.37 Given its severe health consequences,\nthe prevention of stroke in the general population is of critical\nimportance to reduce the public health burden of cardiovas-\ncular disease. Further prospective studies are needed to\nconfirm the association and pattern of dietary potassium\nintake and risk of stroke. Depending on the results of such\nstudies, randomized trials of potassium supplementation to\nreduce stroke may be warranted.\n"
