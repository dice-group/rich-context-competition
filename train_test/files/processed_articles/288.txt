We included 2355 participants\n>60 years who completed measures of cognition and\nPoryphyromonas gingivalis IgG. Using SUDAAN, logistic\nregression models examined the association of P\ngingivalis IgG with cognitive test performance.\nResults: Poor immediate verbal memory (,5/9 points)\nwas prevalent in 5.7% of patients, and 6.5% overall had\nimpaired delayed recall (,4/9); 22.1% had difficulty with\nserial subtractions (,5/5 trials correct). Individuals with\nthe highest P gingivalis IgG (.119 ELISA Units (EU))\nwere more likely to have poor delayed verbal recall (OR\n((57 EU), with dose\u00adresponse relationships for both (p\nAfter adjusting for socioeconomic and vascular variables,\nthese relationships remained robust for the highest P\ngingivalis IgG group (delayed verbal memory OR 3.01\nto 3.36)). In contrast, immediate verbal memory was not\nsignificantly associated with P gingivalis.\nConclusion: A serological marker of periodontitis is\nassociated with impaired delayed memory and calcula-\ntion. Further exploration of relationships between oral\nhealth and cognition is warranted.\nOral health problems, including periodontal disease,\ncaries, edentulism and infrequent preventative care,\nbecome more prevalent with increasing age.1 2\nPeriodontitis and caries are the two predominant\ncauses of tooth loss and reflect similar risk factors,\nincluding inattention to care; periodontitis is more\ncommon than caries among adults.3 4 Estimates of\nadult prevalence of clinical periodontitis vary from\nprevalence estimates likely depend on clinical\nmarkers used for disease definition.\nPeriodontitis is a chronic, potentially transmis-\nsible oral biofilm infection.6 7 Exposure to period-\nontal pathogens is ubiquitous in older adults,8 with\na large proportion exposed by adolescence.9 A\nsystemic host response to periodontitis is evi-\ndenced by serum antibodies to common period-\nontal bacteria,8 such as Porphyromonas gingivalis (a\npathogen causally associated with periodontitis),6\nplus elevations in serum inflammatory markers\ninterleukin 610 and C reactive protein.11 In addition\nto epidemiological associations, treatment of per-\niodontal disease decreases serum levels of inter-\nleukin 6 and C reactive protein.11\nEpidemiological evidence supports an association\nbetween stroke and serum antibody measures to P\ngingivalis.12 P gingivalis is associated with acceler-\nated aortic atherogenesis13 and increased carotid\nartery intimal\u00admedial thickness.14 Risk factors for\nstroke and dementia, including diabetes, obesity\nand smoking, have a similar systemic inflamma-\ntory profile to periodontitis15 16 and suggest that\nthey could play similar roles in a final common\npathway of atherogenesis related to systemic\nDespite the association of periodontitis with\nstroke and shared risk factors between stroke and\ndementia,17 to our knowledge, no epidemiological\nstudies have investigated periodontitis relative to\ncognition. We hypothesised that periodontal dis-\nease is a risk factor for poor cognition. Thus we\ninvestigated whether periodontitis, as defined by a\nserological marker, is independently associated\nwith cognitive test performance in older adults in\na nationally representative US sample, before and\nafter controlling for potential socioeconomic and\nvascular confounders.\nMETHODS\nSource of data\nThe Third National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES-III) was a cross\nsectional nationwide health survey of the USA,\nCenter for Health Statistics. NHANES-III enrolled\nstratified multistage probability sampling design.\nInclusion criteria\n9371 persons had serum analysis for immunoglobu-\nOf these, persons with both cognitive evaluations\nand serum analysis for these pathogens (n = 2355)\nwere included in this analysis.\nStudy variables\nSerum P gingivalis IgG was chosen for study to\ncapture evidence of systemic exposure to a\nResearch paper\ngroup.bmj.com\njnnp.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\ncommon periodontal disease causing pathogenic bacterium with\nwell described pathogenicity8 and associations with systemic\ndisease and stroke. Antibody measurements were reported in\nELISA units of IgG (EU). To examine for possible dose\u00adresponse\nrelationships of P gingivalis and cognition, we created four\nranges of P gingivalis IgG based on the only known report\nrelating periodontitis severity to P gingivalis IgG.8 That report\nfrom the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC,\nn = 1673) had similar demographics to the NHANES-III subjects\nstudied here and reported mean P gingivalis IgG for healthy\nparametric rank scores from general linear models for overall\nsignificance after having p,0.05 for the Hotelling T2 statistic for\nmultiple comparisons of 17 periodontal bacteria serum titres).8\nTo capture the relationship of increasing P gingivalis IgG\nassociated with increasing periodontitis severity, we used the\nmidpoint between each of these P gingivalis IgG means to create\ncut-off points for four P gingivalis IgG groups: (57 EU\nThree cognitive tests were measured in NHANES-III: an\nimmediate and delayed logical verbal memory test from the East\nBoston Memory Test,19 a three word registration/memory task\n(``apple,'' ``table'' and ``penny'') and five serial subtractions by\nintervals of three. Consistent with previous NHANES-III\nreports,20 21 a summary score of less than 4 out of a possible\n9 points in total (0\u00ad6 points from paragraph/story memory,\nplus 0\u00ad3 points from three word recall) was considered\nimpaired. For immediate memory (registration), again using a\nsummary score of logical memory and three word task, we\nconsidered less than 5 out of 9 points (10th percentile) to be\nimpaired. For the test of serial subtractions, any miscalculation\nduring the five trials was considered impaired. We also initially\nexplored a clinical definition of periodontitis22 relative to\ndelayed memory but found no association (data not shown).\nA comprehensive history was taken, including medical\nhistory, medication use and self-reported sociodemographic\nfactors. Race\u00adethnicity included data from the three major\ngroups, as collected in the survey: non-Hispanic White, non-\nHispanic Black and Mexican\u00adAmerican. Annual individual\nincome was categorised into three groups: ($14 999,\ndefined by active health insurance within the last month\n(private company, Medicare, Medicaid or military). Years of\neducation were categorised as ,12 years (less than high school\neducation), 12 years (equivalent to completion of high school)\nand .12 years of (at least some education beyond high school).\nSmoking status was specified as never, current or former\nsmokers.\nCoronary artery disease (CAD) was defined by history of\nmyocardial infarction or anginal symptoms (pain or discomfort\nin the chest while walking uphill that abates with rest).\nCongestive heart failure (CHF) was based on a history of a\nphysician informing the patient of CHF. Stroke was defined as a\nself-reported history of stroke or if the subject had been\ninformed by a physician of stroke. Diabetes mellitus was\ndefined by self-report of diabetes; women with only a history of\ngestational diabetes were not considered diabetic. Hypertension\nwas defined as present if the participant self-reported hyperten-\nsion, used anti-hypertensive medications or had measured\nsystolic blood pressure .130 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure\n.85 mm Hg. This more liberal assessment of blood pressure is\nconsistent with that of the metabolic syndrome23 and was used\nin order to minimise the potential effect of this possible\nconfounder.\nStatistical methods\nDescriptive statistics for selected characteristics and prevalence\nof the outcomes of interest were estimated. To determine\nsignificance of differences, t tests for comparison of means of\ncontinuous variables were used. To determine the strength of\nthe association between P gingivalis IgG and cognitive test\nperformance before and after controlling for selected covariates,\nlogistic regression models were fitted.

Moreover, neither vascular\nnor socioeconomic factors played an appreciable role in the\nrelationship of P gingivalis IgG and subtraction test perfor-\nmance.\nWe also explored potential effect modification of the relation-\nship between P gingivalis IgG and cognitive tests by age\n(dichotomised at a median age of 72 years), stroke history and\nrace (given its apparent role as a confounder in the relationship\nwith delayed memory). None of these potential effect modifiers\nwere statistically significant in crude or fully adjusted models\nfor any of the cognitive tests (data not shown).\nDISCUSSION\nWe identified a cross sectional association between a serological\nmarker of a common periodontitis pathogen and poor cognitive\ntest performance in a large nationally representative sample.\nIndividuals with high levels of P gingivalis IgG had significantly\ngreater odds of impaired verbal memory and subtraction test\nperformance and this finding remained robust when adjusting\nfor potential sociodemographic and vascular confounders.\nFurthermore, we identified a statistically significant dose\u00ad\nresponse relationship between subtraction test performance\nand increasing P gingivalis IgG and a similar but non-significant\ntrend regarding delayed verbal memory and P gingivalis IgG.\nGiven these findings, we performed post hoc analyses of A\nactinomycetemcomitans IgG (the only other periodontal pathogen\nevaluated in NHANES-III) and clinical periodontitis22 relative to\nall cognitive test outcomes but found no relationship in any\nmodels (data not shown), perhaps related to weak associations\nof A actinomycetemcomitans with systemic disease12 and imprecise\nclinical periodontal measurements in NHANES-III.24 Notably,\nan NHANES-III study found that among those aged 20\u00ad\n59 years, markers of periodontitis (gingival bleeding, loss of\nperiodontal attachment and tooth loss) were associated with\npoor symbol digit substitution test and serial digit learning test\nperformance. However, these same individual clinical measures\nof periodontitis were not associated with story recall in adjusted\nmodels among those aged 70 years and older.25\nThese cross sectional analyses do not allow inferences\nregarding the directionality of the association of cognition and\ndental health. A relatively straightforward argument can be\nmade for cognitive impairment leading to poor dental health:\npersons with impaired cognition could be inattentive to oral\nhygiene or oral health maintenance as impairment in cognition\nprogresses.26 Conversely, worth considering is whether poor oral\nhealth could contribute to subsequent cognitive impairment.\nAlthough results presented here are preliminary and incon-\nclusive, a growing body of evidence supports exploration of a\npossible association between poor oral health and incident\ndementia. Poor dentition, a late-life marker of earlier oral health\nconditions such as periodontitis, is associated with both\nIn addition, at least one randomised trial demonstrated that more\nintensive dental care was associated to a 1.5 point significantly\nslower decline in Folstein Mini-Mental Status Examination score\nDespite association of stroke with periodontitis,17 33 stroke did\nnot appear to be a confounder or effect modifier in the\nrelationship between P gingivalis IgG and cognitive test\nperformance. This could reflect an imprecise assessment of\nstroke based on self-report, or that the relationship between\nstroke, periodontitis and memory is masked within a cross-\nsectional study. Alternatively, periodontitis could be related to\ncognition independent of clinical stroke. Similar to diabetes,\nhypertension and smoking,34 periodontitis is associated with\nTable 3 Cognitive test performance relative to P gingivalis IgG\nTest\nOverall\n(%)\nP gingivalis IgG\n(EU) (95% CI) p Value*\nImmediate verbal memory/registration\n(9 possible points)\nDelayed verbal memory (9 possible\npoints)\nSerial 3 subtraction test (5 possible\npoints)\n*p values derived from t test comparison of means of P gingivalis IgG by population\ncharacteristic.\nTable 4 Crude and adjusted odds ratios for P gingivalis IgG and memory tests.

Measurable socioeconomic covariates\nprovide a restricted scope of lifelong socioeconomic status and\nperiodontitis could be or lead, at least in part, to residual\nconfounder; indeed, low socioeconomic status is strongly\nassociated with periodontitis in NHANES-III.22 Moreover,\npersons with low socioeconomic status may have low cognitive\nreserve,40 or relatively worse memory test performance despite\nsimilar brain pathology compared with other groups.\nAvailable NHANES-III cognitive tests are another limitation.\nThe cognitive measurements reported here are crude assess-\nments of cognitive test performance and may reflect individual\nor group differences in test understanding, rather than a true\nassessment of cognition. The limited scope of these tests also\ndoes not clearly inform a potential neuroanatomical basis for\nimpaired test performance, given likely overlapping cognitive\ndomains involved with each task. Furthermore, the precise\naetiology of impaired cognitive test performance cannot be\nknown from these data. Nonetheless, the components of the\noutcome used here have been validated as rigorous tools for\nscreening memory in epidemiological studies.19\nIn an attempt to capture a dose\u00adresponse relationship between\nP gingivalis IgG and cognitive test performance, we created P\ngingivalis IgG groups based on a report from another large\nmulticentre population based American study (ARIC),8 which\nfound a strong association between escalating levels of P gingivalis\nIgG and clinical periodontitis severity. Use of this schema for\ncreating P gingivalis IgG groups appears plausible but requires\nvalidation in other studies. Serum antibodies to periodontal\npathogens are strongly associated with worse states of oral health8\nand remain persistently elevated despite clinical treatment.41\nTaken together, these findings suggest that serum antibody levels\nreflect chronic, intermittent exposures of clinical periodontitis,\nbut it is uncertain whether to state that a higher periodontal titre\nimplies higher burden of acute exposures, more recent exposure or\nmore intense response to periodontal pathogens.\nPeriodontitis is a lifelong, highly prevalent, chronic inflam-\nmatory disease associated with stroke, systemic inflammation\nand endothelial dysfunction. Although our results are pre-\nliminary, they suggest that further exploration of relationships\nbetween oral health and cognition is warranted.\nAcknowledgements: NHANES-III is a publicly available data set.
