This study first considers age and cohort explanations for age-related changes in mean values and variance\nin self-rated health. Second, it evaluates the contributions of genes and environments to self-rated health mea-\nsured longitudinally.\nMethods. Subjects were participants in the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging. Self-rated health assessments\nwere collected in four waves over a 9-year follow-up period, from one or both members of 788 twin pairs. Linear mixed\neffect models were used to test for differences in means and variances. Structural equation modeling provided estimates\nof genetic and environmental components of variance and contributions to stability.\nResults. Changes in means and variance within cohorts seem to reflect illness. Earlier-born cohorts are more variable\nand have lower self-rated health. These cohort differences were not explained by childhood socioeconomic status.\nCorrelations between time points reflect both environmental and genetic factors.\nDiscussion. Both genes and environments contribute to self-rated health longitudinally, and both age and cohort effects\nare seen. Age-related changes in self-rated health can be attributed to illness. Cohort differences are most likely\nattributable to socially mediated and individual-specific environmental factors.\nINTEREST in the self-evaluation of health has grown over\nthe last 25 years. The most provocative finding is that\nsubjective health assessments are often superior to clinical\nassessments for predicting outcomes such as mortality and\nThomas, Kelman, Kennedy, Ahn, & Yang, 1992). Twin studies\nthat focus on self-rated health as an outcome have demonstrated\nthat cross-sectional increases in variability with age are\nprimarily due to environmental factors unique to the individual,\nbut also to genetic factors (Christensen, Holm, McGue, Corder,\n& Vaupel, 1999; Harris, Pedersen, McClearn, Plomin, &\nstein, & Pedersen, 2001). It is unclear, however, whether these\nfindings reflect differences in cohorts where earlier-born\ncohorts had more variability or whether the findings indicate\na true age-related increase in variance.\nThe extent to which change in self-rated health over time\nreflects genetic or environmental influences has, to our\nknowledge, not been investigated previously. If environmental\nfactors explain the correlation between follow-up occasions, this\nwould suggest that stability in self-rated health reflects\nindividual-specific environmental factors. These could be\naccidents or chance events that happen during the life span\nand that have enduring effects. If shared familial environmental\nfactors explain the time-to-time correlation, childhood socio-\neconomic status (SES) or other rearing influences may be of\nimportance. One of the most prominent factors contributing to\ncohort differences in Sweden the last century is SES. A large\nbody of literature also indicates that SES is predictive of\nmorbidity, mortality, and decline in functional status at different\nSeeman & Crimmins, 2001). Thus, it is reasonable to predict\nthat childhood SES contributes to both cohort differences and\nlongitudinal changes in self-rated health. If, instead, genetic\nfactors explain stability in self-rated health, this would suggest\nthat the consequences of genes are transmitted longitudinally. If\nthere are changes in genetic influences at later follow-up\noccasions or among older age groups, this might imply that\ngenetic influences tied to late-onset, chronic diseases are of\nimportance for individual differences in self-rated health as\npeople grow older.\nCross-sectional studies have demonstrated that increasing\nage, increasing number of symptoms, presence of a longstanding\nillness, and increasing number of new illnesses have shown\na marked effect on subjects' self-rated health status (e.g.,\nMurray, Dunn, & Tarnopolsky, 1982). Unde\n\u00b4n and Elofsson\n(1998) further showed that functional health and life style have\na greater explanatory value for level of self-rated health status in\nolder age groups than younger ones (younger than 44 years).\nHowever, cross-sectional studies do not allow one to distinguish\nproperly the effects of age from aging due to coexisting\nprocesses contributing to differences between age groups such\nas sampling, selection, or different life experiences related to\nOf the few longitudinal studies focusing on self-rated health\nas an outcome, some have reported change, while others report\nstability in level with age. Differences between studies are\nmainly due to differences between the study samples, differ-\nences in questions asked, and length of follow-up times. The\nLos Angeles Health Survey (Goldstein, Siegel, & Boyer, 1984)\nfound that self-rated health remained relatively stable over\n1 year. Changes in self-rated health status were not associated\nwith any indicators of objective health or health beliefs. In their\nreported a substantial stability of self-rated health and persistent\nJournal of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES Copyright 2005 by The Gerontological Society of America\nhigh positive congruence between medical evaluations and self-\nrated health. A Swedish longitudinal study showed no overall\nchange in self-rated health from 60 to 67 years of age (Tibblin,\nCato, & Svardsudd, 1990; Tibblin, Tibblin, Peciva, Kullman, &\nSvardsudd, 1990), and a Finnish study found similar results\n(Leinonen, Heikkinen, & Jylha, 1998), although another study\nreported a slight decline of self-rated health over an 8-year\nperiod (Markides & Lee, 1990). Nonetheless, results from the\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey I Follow-Up\nStudy suggest that not only is self-rated health sensitive to\ndeterioration in physical health over a 20-year period, but\ndeclines over time in self-rated health are associated with\nmortality (Ferraro & Kelley-Moore, 2001). In her 6-year follow-\nup study, Idler (1993) tested whether the observed optimism in\nself-rated health was attributable to changes in age, cohort, or\nsurvivorship with a sample of elderly persons (65 years or\nolder). She concluded that none of the explanations could be\nruled out; selective survivorship, processes of aging, and cohort\ndifferences all seem to play important roles. Taken together,\ncross-sectional and longitudinal studies suggest that age-related\nchange in self-rated health may not be great, whereas cohort\ndifferences may be present but generally overlooked.\nAn increase in individual differences across age groups has\nbeen demonstrated cross-sectionally for several health-related\nvariables, including self-rated health, although variance in-\ncreases are not universal (Birren & Schroots, 1996; Schaie &\nBaltes, 1996). A review of biologically oriented studies in the\ngerontological literature shows that 75% of the cross-sectional\nstudies show patterns of increasing variability, that is, in-\ncreasing individual differences (Nelson & Dannefer, 1992).\nIndividual differences can be traced to genetic or environmental\ninfluences. Genetic and familial factors represent illnesses,\nfunctional capacity, personality, SES, and other influences that\nin turn affect self-rated health status.\nAge group differences in variance reported in previous cross-\nsectional gerontological genetic studies (Harris et al., 1992a;\nSvedberg et al., 2001) could also reflect cohort differences in\nwhich earlier-born cohorts had a greater range of socioeco-\nnomic and cultural influences than later-born cohorts. Alterna-\ntively, terminal decline, a rapid change in social, physiological,\nand psychological functioning prior to death, has been sug-\ngested as a possible source of individual differences in late life\n(Berg, 1996). When studying elderly people, the population can\nbe presumed to include both elite survivors and an unknown\nnumber of individuals that are experiencing a terminal decline\nphase in their physical functioning.\nLongitudinal quantitative genetic data help to distinguish true\naging effects from cohort differences and also to investigate\ngenetic and environmental explanations for increasing in-\ndividual differences. Generally, longitudinal changes in both\nmeans and variance have been smaller than cross-sectional\ndifferences (Finkel, Reynolds, McArdle, Gatz, & Pedersen,\nKoskenvuo, 1994). Longitudinal analyses of number of organ\nsystems affected by disease were investigated in a Swedish twin\nstudy (Pedersen, Steffensson, Berg, Johansson, & McClearn,\n1999). For those twin pairs that survived to the age of 80 or\nolder, there were longitudinal increases in variance across a 30-\nyear period, entirely attributable to increases in environmental\ninfluences. Finkel, Pedersen, and colleagues (2003) also found\nsupport for increases in environmental variance with age for\ngrip strength and well-being, while genetic variance remained\nstable. Self-rated health has not been studied from a longitudinal\nquantitative genetic perspective.\nOur goals were first to investigate how mean levels change\nwith time and whether the increases in total variance and\nvariance components with age previously reported in cross-\nsectional studies of self-rated health are replicated in a longi-\ntudinal study. Four age groups were constructed based on birth\nyear. We predicted that mean levels within age groups would\nremain relatively stable across time and that longitudinal\nchanges would be smaller than cross-sectional. Additionally,\nwe test whether an index of illness accounted for any age-\nrelated changes in self-rated health and whether childhood SES\naccounted for any cohort differences in self-rated health.\nSecond, we sought to investigate the extent to which genetic\nand/or environmental factors contributed to phenotypic stability\nover time, that is, correlations between time points.\nMETHOD\nParticipants and Data Collection\nParticipants in this study are from the ongoing longitudinal\nSwedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging (SATSA). This study\nis based on a subsample from the Swedish Twin Registry\n(Lichtenstein et al., 2002) and includes twin pairs reared together\n(TRT) and twin pairs separated before 11 years of age and reared\napart (TRA). The sampling of SATSA twins and method of\nzygosity determination have been described in detail elsewhere\n(Pedersen et al., 1991). The data included in the present analyses\nwere collected by questionnaires in four waves starting in 1984\nwith new questionnaires sent out at 3-year follow-up intervals\nzygosity in which one or both members responded to the self-\nrated health items at least once (pair-wise response frequency\nmale. For the purpose of comparisons with earlier results by\nHarris and colleagues (1992a), we divided data into four age\ngroups based on age at first questionnaire (1984): younger than\nThese groups represent different birth cohorts. The age at the last\nmeasurement occasion of each age group is then the same as the\nage of first occasion of the next age group. Response patterns\nacross measurement occasions by age group are presented in\nTable 1. Fifty-four percent of the sample participated at all four\nquestionnaire occasions, and only 13 individuals had partners\nwith missing information on all four of the questionnaires.\nSATSA was approved by the Ethics Committee of Karolinska\nInstitutet, the Institutional Research Boards of the Pennsylvania\nState University and the University of Southern California, and\nthe Swedish National Data Inspection Authority.\nMeasures\nSelf-rated health was measured by a scale including four\nquestions (listed in Table 2), one of which asks respondents\nfor a global rating of their health and three items about their\nhealth in the context of their own aging experience. Following\nthe same procedure as Harris and colleagues (1992a), the\nitems were standardized at the first questionnaire occasion to\na mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 before summing.\nstandardized relative to means and variances at the first\nquestionnaire (1984) items and then summed, ensuring that the\ndefinition of self-rated health remained invariant across testing\noccasions. A more favorable self-rating of health is indicated by\na higher value on the scale. The items included were reasonably\nWe included a measure of the number of organ systems\naffected by a chronic illness (sum of illness) as an objective\nindicator of health. This is an index designed to mirror\n``constricted homeostasis,'' which is a general reduction in\nphysiological resilience that is not associated with a specific\ndiagnosis (Rowe, 1985). This scale is based on 51 health-related\nitems that were reduced to 13 categories (cardiovascular,\nrespiratory, neurological, metabolic, gastrointestinal, musculo-\nskeletal, urologic, female reproductive, visual, auditory, aller-\ngies, skin, and cancer). A score for the scale was then computed\nas the sum of all categories that were reported to be affected by\nat least one health problem (Harris et al., 1992a). A high score\nindicates more health problems.\nWe also looked at SES in childhood (rearing home) measured\non the first questionnaire in 1984. The SES Scale includes three\ncomponents: material resources within the household, highest\neducation, and highest occupational status of the parents. This\nscale is based on factor analyses. Variables were standardized to\na mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 before summing. A\nhigher score on the scale reflects higher SES level. For a more\ndetailed description, see Lichtenstein and colleagues (1992).\nAnalytical Procedure\nAnalysis of means and variances. --Linear mixed effect\nmodels with repeated measures and unstructured covariance\nstructures, different for different age groups, were fitted to the\ndata by running the Proc Mixed procedure in SAS (SAS/STAT,\ndifferences in means in self-rated health over time, within and\nbetween age groups. Second, a model was fitted to the data in\nthe same manner, including sum of illness and childhood SES\nas covariates. Two-sample Student t tests were calculated using\nthe SAS Proc ttest procedure to test for differences in mean\nchildhood SES between age groups. Then, similar models were\nfitted to test for differences in variances.\nQuantitative genetic analysis. --Differences in similarity\nbetween zygosity groups provide information about genetic\nand environmental effects that may be present. For example, if\nthe monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs are more similar than dizygotic\n(DZ) twin pairs, then genetic effects are indicated. Shared\nenvironmental effects refer to nongenetic influences that\ncontribute to similarity within pairs of twins regardless of\nzygosity, for example, family environment and contact through-\nout life. Nonshared environmental effects are individual-specific\ninfluences not shared within a twin pair, like accidents or\noccupations. To the extent that twin pairs are dissimilar,\nnonshared environmental effects are indicated. Genetic differ-\nences also contribute to dissimilarities within DZ twin pairs.\nTo investigate what factors contribute to the variance in self-\nrated health over a 9-year time span in the four different age\ngroups, a series of models was fitted to the raw data. Fitting to\nraw data allows for inclusion of single responders and therefore\nincreases power in the analyses and provides population based\nestimates of total variance. The series of models began with the\nfully parameterized Cholesky model in a temporal context\nThe figure depicts a simplified version of the model includ-\ning only one twin in a pair.

A, C, and\nE give information about anonymous influences that are not\nactually measured. Thus, A tells us that there are genetic\ninfluences but not which gene. Using this multivariate model,\nTable 1.

Within this framework with four measurements\n(time points), the first genetic factor (A) loads on all of the\nmeasures, a second genetic factor loads on all but the first\nmeasure, a third genetic factor loads on all but the first two of the\nmeasures, etc. Shared environmental (C) and nonshared\nenvironmental (E) factors load on the four measurements in\npatterns similar to that of the genetic factors. The relative\nimportance of genetic and environmental effects on each of the\nmeasurement occasions is calculated by squaring and summing\nthe parameter estimates for each measure and dividing the\nsquared parameter estimates by the sum of squares. Total\nvariance estimates from the model and the decomposition into\ngenetic and environmental variance at each measurement\noccasion will be presented. Heritability estimates for each\ntime occasion may be obtained by taking the overall genetic\nvariance over total variance. First, we fitted a full model (ACE)\nfor each age group. A series of submodels were then fitted when\nwe dropped common a, c, and e parameters that contribute to\ntransmission from the full model (i.e., only time-specific a11\n,\nwere kept in\nthe model; see Figure 1) to identify a parsimonious explanation\nof the data and evaluate the hypothesis concerning transmission\nof stability. Nested models were compared by likelihood-ratio\nchi-square. Degrees of freedom are equal to the number of\nparameters deleted from the full model. The reduced models\nwhere common a, c, and e were dropped from the model were\ncompared with the fit of the full model.\nAll models were fitted to the standardized observations of\nself-rated health by full information maximum likelihood\nestimation implemented in the program Mx (Neale, Boker,\nXie, & Maes, 2002). The models assume that there is random\nmating operating in the parental generation, no interaction\nbetween genes and environment, and equivalent influence of\nshared environments for MZ and DZ twins. A more detailed\ndiscussion of these assumptions can be found in Martin,\nThe standardized path coefficients from the Cholesky model\ncan be used to estimate how the correlations between self-rated\nhealth at different time points are mediated and thereby describe\nwhat factors contribute to stability over time. To evaluate\nlongitudinal stability, the proportions of the phenotypic\ncorrelation attributable to a, c, and e between time points for\neach age group were calculated (Plomin & DeFries, 1981). The\ngenetic component of the estimated phenotypic correlation (rP\n)\nfor self-rated health between times 1 and 2 is a11\n, the shared\nenvironmental portion is c11\n, and the nonshared environ-\nmental portion is e11\n. Following the same procedure among\nthe other follow-up occasions, the estimated genetic portion of\nthe phenotypic correlation for self-rated health between times\n), the shared environmental\nFigure 1.

Inclusion of TRT and TRA enables us to\nestimate the importance of similarities in the rearing environ-\nment, as distinct from other shared environmental influences\nthat might occur in adult life. In these analyses, a fourth\nparameter was included by a unity correlation between these\nlatent factors for TRT and a zero correlation for TRA,\nrepresenting influences that result in greater similarity of TRT\nthan TRA (Lichtenstein et al., 1992; Plomin, DeFries, &\nRESULTS\nAnalysis of Means and Variances\nMean values and standard deviations for the self-rated health\nscale at baseline and at follow-up questionnaire occasions are\ndescribed in Table 3 by age group. Younger adults were more\npositive about their health status than older adults at baseline. A\nlinear mixed effect model was fitted to the data controlling for\nsex, rearing, and zygosity.

There were statistically\nsignificant mean effects for age group and time and a significant\nage group-by-time interaction (p , .05).

To evaluate this further, we compared a model with no\nrestrictions on the variances and covariances with a model with\nequal variances at all four time points and equal correlations\nbetween data measured with an equal distance apart (a model\nwith different age group-specific Toeplitz covariance struc-\ntures).

The corresponding\nIf the missing data can be considered missing at random, the\nestimates obtained from the maximum likelihood estimation are\nunbiased. If this assumption is not true, the missing data are\nnot ignorable and the missing mechanisms should be modeled\n(Little & Rubin, 1987). With the advantage of technical and con-\nceptual simplicity, we performed a series of sensitivity analyses,\ntesting the effects of assumptions regarding the ``true'' responses\nby those who missed a measurement occasion. We computed\nmultiple imputations assuming correlated multivariate normal\ndistribution for the data within twin pairs and then recalculated\nour original analysis. Data missing because of death were not\nimputed, but the data available before death were used. In four\nseparate analyses, the imputed values were then decreased (or\nincreased) by \u00c00.5, \u00fe0.5, \u00c02, and \u00fe2 units, respectively, to test\nthe consequences of assuming that nonresponse represented\nworse (or better) true values. The results were consistent with the\noriginal analyses of means and variance development (data not\nshown), with only minor differences from the original results.\nWhen imputed values were negatively adjusted, there were only\nslightly lower means and higher variances, whereas for a positive\nadjustment, the opposite was found.\nReasons for nonresponses were available for 44% of the\nmissing subjects, with 28% having died during the follow-up\nperiod and 16% indicating that they were too sick to participate.\nOn this basis, we believe the nonobserved self-rated health\ndata represent poorer ratings rather than the contrary. This\nassumption is also supported by evaluating the means and\nvariances for those who participated in the questionnaire\nfollow-ups as a function of number of occasions of participa-\ntion. There is a pattern resembling terminal decline with\ndecreases in means at the last occasion of measurement (see\nFigure 6). We can see by visual inspection that mean values are\nlower for those who participated only at the first questionnaire\noccasion compared with those who participated at more than\none occasion. Those participating in all four occasions have the\ngreatest mean level stability, whereas the variance is higher for\nthose who participated only the first time and lower for those\nFigure 3.

Fewer twins participated\nat all four occasions in the oldest age group; therefore, we also\nlooked specifically at this group. The twins who participated at\nthe fourth occasion had lower variability in 1984 than those\nwho dropped out over the course of the study. This finding\nsuggests that these individuals are farther away from death and\nhence less variable because they are all healthier.\nIn conclusion, with these additional analyses, we consider the\nresults presented above regarding variances and mean de-\nvelopment to be conservative in the sense that availability of the\n``true values'' for missing data would probably only increase\nthe variances at later time points and older ages and simul-\ntaneously decrease the mean values.\nQuantitative Genetic Analysis\nA fundamental assumption of quantitative genetic analysis\nbased on twin data is that variances are equal in MZ and DZ\ntwins. Analyses of variance in SAS and Mx yielded no\ndifferences in means and variances between MZ and DZ twin\ngroups for the self-rated health scale except for the age group\n50\u00ad59 years. Violations of this assumption typically result in\na worsening of fit of the genetic models but no influence on\nparameter estimates.\nThere were no significant differences in intrapair similarity\nbetween the two rearing groups, and shared rearing environ-\nmental effects did not explain significant proportions of the\nvariance. Thus, in the following, we will focus on the results\nwhere rearing is not specifically taken into account.\nFigure 7 illustrates the total raw variances and the genetic and\nenvironmental variances based on the most parsimonious model\nfour age groups as well as average total variance over time for\neach age group. Table 4 shows the fit statistics of the model\nfitting procedures for the full and most parsimonious models\nbased on Akaike information criteria. The most parsimonious\nmodel for all of the age groups suggests that shared\nenvironmental factors (C) in common to the four measurement\noccasions could be dropped from the model; that is, only shared\nenvironmental factors unique to each time point were kept in the\nmodel. Nonshared environmental variance was the greatest\nsource of variance for all age groups at most of the measurement\noccasions, except for the last measurement occasion for the\noldest age group. Most of the remaining variance was explained\nby genetic factors.\nStability coefficients (i.e., phenotypic correlations [rP\n]) from\nthe most parsimonious model and their decomposition into\ngenetic and nonshared environmental components are shown in\nTable 5. The youngest age group has the lowest correlation\ncoefficients (rP\n) around .45. Nonshared environmental factors\nare the primary source of stability over a 9-year time span for\nthe youngest age group (under 50 years), whereas in the older\nage groups, both nonshared environmental and genetic factors\naccount for almost equal portions of the total correlation.\nDISCUSSION\nThis study aimed to investigate individual differences in self-\nrated health over a 9-year time interval and between four age\ngroups. The research questions of focus were first whether the\ncross-sectional decreases in mean values, increases in total\nvariance, and differences in sources of variation reported in\nearlier studies were paralleled in longitudinal changes or if those\ndifferences represent cohort effects. We evaluated the extent to\nwhich childhood SES and an index of illness account for cohort\nand longitudinal findings. Second, we asked how important ge-\nnetic and environmental influences are for phenotypic stability.\nCohort Versus Longitudinal Effects\nWe found that previous cross-sectional reports of a decrease\nin mean level and an increase in total variance with age are not\nfully replicated in longitudinal approaches. We found mean\nlevels to remain relatively stable over a period of 9-years within\nFigure 6.

However, we also found that younger age groups\nreport a better self-rated health status than the older age groups.\nAge differences in mean level have been reported earlier, and in\ngeneral, older people are more likely to rate their health as poor\n(e.g., Murray et al., 1982). Consistent with the role of health in\naccounting for self-rated health (Ferraro & Kelley-Moore,\n\u00b4n & Elofsson, 1998), the effect of change over time\nwas largely eliminated when disease status was taken into\naccount in our analysis. However, cohort differences remained,\nsuggesting that other factors play an important role for self-\nrated health across different age groups. Different birth cohorts\nmight be affected by societal changes in different ways (Fritzell\n& Lundberg, 2000). There has been strong economic de-\ngrew up when Sweden was fairly poor and during a time of\nmultiple epidemics. Industrialization increased the standard of\nliving, and the age groups born after World War I might have\ngained more from that development than the prewar cohorts. In\nsupport of this hypothesis, our comparison of SES during\nchildhood for the different age groups demonstrates that\nyounger age groups had a higher childhood SES level.\nHowever, inclusion of childhood SES in our mixed effect\nmodel did not explain the cohort differences in self-rated health\nto any great extent. Societal changes not tapped by our SES\nmeasure are more likely to explain these differences.\nOur results also show that the increase in total variance is\ngreater between age groups than longitudinal contrasts within\nage groups. This finding is consistent with the literature\ncontrasting cross-sectional with longitudinal findings within\nthe same study for other gerontological variables (Birren &\nThe age at the last measurement occasion of each age group is\nthe same as the age of first occasion of the next age group. The\ntotal variance estimates at the last occasion for the youngest age\ngroup matches the estimates of the first occasion for the second\nage group. However, there are clearer differences in the start and\nending points for the last two age groups (60\u00ad69 years and 70\nyears and older), suggesting clearer cohort differences and little\nlongitudinal change for these age groups. Neither childhood\nSES nor an index of morbidity explained these findings.\nSources of Variance\nThe contributions of genetic and environmental variance to\nthe total variance for all four age groups replicate well what has\nbeen found in previous cross-sectional studies (Christensen\nand environmental variance appear to increase longitudinally,\nalthough for the youngest age group in our present study, there\nis not much variability. The increased variability is due to both\ngenetic and environmental sources of influence. Increasing\ngenetic variability might result from the fact that the twins\nare coming into the age when many chronic diseases that are\ninfluenced by genetic effects have their debut, for example,\ncoronary heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, etc. Some\npeople become affected, and others remain disease-free, leading\nto increased individual differences.\nStability in Self-Rated Health Over Time\nStability of self-rated health, that is, interoccasion phenotypic\ncorrelation, is lower for the youngest age group compared with\nthe older age groups, which might reflect the restricted range in\nvariation or the onset of health-related conditions. Primarily\nnonshared environmental factors contribute to stability for the\nyoungest age group, and both genetic and environmental factors\ncontribute fairly equally to stability in the other age groups.\nA somewhat higher environmental component of stability\nindicates that the same environmental factors had an impact at\nmore than one occasion. Such nonshared environmental factors\ncould, for example, include social relationships, education, and\nTable 5.

Comparison of the Full Cholesky Model and Submodels\nAccording to AIC for Self-Rated Health by Age Group\nAge group\nNotes: AIC \u00bc Akaike Information Criteria; A \u00bc additive genetic effects;\nC \u00bc shared environmental effects; E \u00bc unique environmental effects.\naFor all age groups, the most parsimonious model based on AIC was the\nsubmodel where we dropped shared environmental effects (C). Time specific\nA, C, and E were still in the model as well as common A and common E.\naccidents that have an enduring effect on self-rated health. Equal\nmediation by genetic and environmental effects has also been\nfound for personality traits (Pedersen & Reynolds, 1998). The\ncorrelations between times are not explained by shared\nenvironmental effects in any of the age groups. This is consistent\nwith our finding from our mixed effect model where childhood\nSES, a typical measure of shared environment, does not explain\ncohort differences in variance or time effects in self-rated health.\nStrengths and Limitations\nThis study was restricted to a somewhat short follow-up time\nperiod of 9 years, yet we were able to impose a ``synthetic cohort\nsequential'' design such that the width of the age group was the\nsame as the length of the follow-up time. Only pairs where both\nmembers responded at any one point in time contributed to\ninformation on covariation (i.e., genetic variance); however, it is\na strength that we actually can include information on all twins\nto receive adequate total variance estimates in our Mx models.\nThe effect of attrition is notable at least for the oldest age\ngroup, an expected issue with a longitudinal project. Many in\nthe oldest group participated at fewer than all four occasions. As\nreported, those who ``survived'' four occasions of measurement\nwere less variable than those who dropped out. This may very\nwell have to do with terminal decline or selection. Less healthy\npersons in a population also tend to refuse answering questions\nboth initially and at follow-up occasions (Maddox & Douglass,\n1974), another liability in longitudinal studies in general. If\nanything, our results are attenuated by attrition.\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur findings suggest that previous reports of an increase in\nvariance in self-rated health with increased age primarily reflect\ncohort differences and are not fully replicated longitudinally.\nMean levels remain quite stable within age groups over time, and\nchanges with age in level of self-rated health seem to be\nexplained primarily by illness. For variance as well, we found\nmore substantial cohort differences than longitudinal changes,\nsuggesting that the influence of socially mediated and in-\ndividual-specific environmental effects may be greater than\nindividual differences due to onset of genetically influenced\ndiseases. The phenotypic stability over a 9-year time period is\nexplained almost equally by genetic and environmental factors\nfor all adult ages.\n"
