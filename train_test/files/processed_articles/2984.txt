Vitamin C indices of varying quality have been used; they have almost always been based on dietary sources of vitamin C alone. Many of these studies, particularly the cohort studies, have not been able to control properly for confounding variables.\n  It has also been hypothesized that there  are benefits of vitamin C intake at levels greatly in excess of the\n\n\nFrom the School of Public Health and Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90024.

A study of 3,119 Alameda County, California, adults found that 10-year total mortality was similar above and below 250 mg per day, using a crude measure of vitamin C intake.17 A large study of 1,000,000 Americans during the 1960s indi\u00ad cated that increased consumption of fruits and vege\u00ad tables was inversely related to lung cancer mortality, but that vitamin pills of unspecified nature showed no relation.18\nWe report here the relation between vitamin C\n\n\n\n\nintake and mortality in a large cohort based on a representative sample of the general U.S. population that has undergone an extensive nutritional examina\u00ad tion, including measuring vitamin C intake from both the diet and the use of supplements.\n\n\nSubjects and Methods\nThe NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study (NHEFS) is a prospective cohort study based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I).19 NHANES I was conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics between 1971 and 1975 on a representative sample of the civilian noninstitutionalized population of the United States.20 Persons estimated to be at risk of malnutrition (chil\u00ad dren, the elderly, women of child-bearing age, and the poor) were oversampled to improve estimates of nutri\u00ad tional status for these groups. A total of 14,407 adults age 25-74 years who were examined in 1971-1975 were included in the NHEFS, and over 90% of these persons were traced and/or reinterviewed between 1982 and 1984, with median 10-year follow-up. NHEFS was designed to investigate the association between factors measured at the baseline with subse\u00ad quent disease occurrence and death. The size and scope of these data provide a unique opportunity to examine etiologic relationships in a large, heterogeneous na\u00ad tional population.\n  The subjects of this report are the 11,348 persons on whom extensive diet and nutrition data were col\u00ad lected during 1971-1974 using food frequency and 24- hour recall questionnaires.21 Follow-up was completed on 10,550 persons (94% of the 4,479 men and 92% of the 6,869 women) and death certificates with cause of death information were obtained for 1,728 deaths (97% of the 1,069 male deaths and 94% of the 740 female deaths). The underlying cause for each death was coded by the National Center for Health Statistics following the rules of the Ninth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD9). Because of the ov\u00ad ersampling of elderly, 37% of the men and 26% of the women were age 65-74 years at eptry, and 80% of all deaths occurred among persons age 65-86 years at death. Analysis in this paper is limited to mortality.\n\nin the cohort. Lifetime cigarette smoking histories were obtained for 9,602 persons (91% of the 10,550 persons traced) in the 1982-1984 follow-up interview, includ\u00ad ing a proxy interview with a spouse or other informant for most of those who had died. Using both the 1971- 1974 and 1982-1984 data, cigarette smoking histories, including average number of cigarettes smoked, were available on 10,128 persons (90% of the cohort).\n  NHANES I collected extensive dietary data through personal interviews.21 These included 24-hour dietary recall data (all foods consumed during the midnight to midnight period preceding the interview) and 3-month food frequency data (frequency of food intake for the preceding 3 months). The National Center for Health Statistics processed food recall data for nutrient con\u00ad tents using a computer program that was adapted from one used in the Ten-State Nutrition Survey and was originally developed at Tulane University.21 The vita\u00ad min C content of each food consumed during the 24- hour period was determined using the nutritive values of food items appearing in the U.S. Department of Agriculture Handbook No. 8, as well as information from food industry sources and other databases. These values were summed by the National Center for Health Statistics to yield total dietary vitamin C intake in milligrams. Some food items had missing values for vitamin C and were not included in the total. The major food items containing vitamin C are oranges, grapefruits, tomatoes, and their juices. The food fre\u00ad quency question most relevant to vitamin C regarded intake of fruits and vegetables rich in vitamin C. There are some limitations to NHANES I, but basically it represents one of the most comprehensive nutritional surveys conducted on a national sample.19 21\n  NHANES I also  collected  1971-1974  information on type (but not quantity) of vitamin supplements used and frequency of vitamin supplement usage: never, irregular (defined as at least weekly but less than daily), and regular (defined as daily). These data have been described and tabulated in detail elsewhere. 14 Supple\u00ad ments containing vitamin C (multivitamin pills and/or vitamin C pills) were used regularly by 16%  of  the men, 20% of the women, and about  85%  of  those using any type of supplement regularly. The most common type of supplement used was  multivitamin pills. The only information on quantity or length of vitamin supplement usage was obtained in the 1982- 1984 follow-up interview on about 8,000  survivors (70% of the original cohort). We have combined the 1971-1974 data on dietary intake based on  24-hour recall with the 1971-1974 data on regular use of sup\u00ad plements containing vitamin C (defined as regular\n\n\n\n\nsupplements) to construct a simple index of three distinct levels of vitamin C intake: 0-49 mg, 50+ mg and no regular supplements, and 50+ mg and regular supplements. The first category includes a small por\u00ad tion (about 15%) of persons using regular supplements. Further subdivision has not been done because of fluctuations in dietary intake from that measured dur\u00ad ing the 24-hour period, the limited data on the quantity of vitamin C intake from supplements, changes in supplement usage over time, and the relatively small number of deaths in some subgroups.\n  Dietary intake based on one 24-hour recall period may be a somewhat variable measure of average long\u00ad term vitamin C intake for each individual. Thus, we have used the 1971-1974 data on the frequency of consumption of fruits and vegetables rich in vitamin  C during the preceding 3 months (defined as fre\u00ad quency) to construct a vitamin C frequency index. The four levels of the vitamin C frequency index are: frequency of less than one time per week; frequency of one to six times per week; frequency of at least one time per day and no regular supplements; and fre\u00ad quency of at least one time per day and regular supple\u00ad ments. This index does not include all sources of vitamin C, but clearly vitamin C intake increases with more frequent consumption of fruits and vegetables rich in vitamin C , as indicated in Tables 1 and 2.\n  We calculated the  standardized  mortality  ratio (SMR) for the subgroups defined by sex, vitamin C index, and other selected variables. The outcomes we examined were all causes of death, all cancers (ICD9 140-208), all cardiovascular diseases (ICD9 390-459), and selected major cancer sites. The SMR for each subgroup is the number of observed deaths divided by  the number of expected deaths, expressed as a per\u00ad centage. The total number of expected  deaths  is  the sum of the expected deaths for each 5-year age group starting at age 25. The number of expected deaths  for one 5-year age group is the number of person-years of risk multiplied by the age-specific  mortality  rate  for that age group of U.S. whites. Each person's period of risk began on the date of his or her initial examination during 1971-1974 and ended on the date of  death,  on  the date of follow-up interview  during  1982-1984,  or on the date the subject was lost to follow-up, whichever came first .\n  We calculated each SMR and its 95% confidence interval (Cl) using a computer program developed by Monson, 22 with expected deaths based on person-years of observation and concurrent death rates among all\nU.S. whites. By this definition, the SMR for all U.S. whites is 1.00. U.S. whites have been chosen as the\n\nreferent group for comparison because detailed data on them are widely available and because the NHEFS cohort is based on a nationally representative sample which is 82% white. The observed mortality among the NHEFS cohort has been shown to agree with expected mortality based on U.S. death rates.23\n  Because of the small number of deaths, especially for cancer, in some subgroups, we have calculated SMRs, which use a different standard for each com\u00ad parison, instead of direct age standardization with a common standard. The age distribution of the  cohort is similar for all levels of vitamin C index, however, so the changing standard does not introduce any serious distortion. The male age distribution at the time of original interview is: 17.8% for ages 25-34, 14.9% for\n  The sample weights associated with the oversam\u00ad pling of certain NHANES I subjects have not been used in our analysis. The SMRs are based primarily on deaths among persons at least 65 years of age. The cause of death was not obtained for 3% of the male deaths and 6% of the female deaths, and thus cause\u00ad specific SMRs are correspondingly lower than they should be. We also conducted analyses using the Cox proportional hazards model to investigate the relation of the vitamin C index to mortality while controlling for several potentially confounding variables. 24 25\n\nResults\nKey 1971-1974 demographic and nutritional charac\u00ad teristics for the NHEFS cohort as a function of the three-level vitamin C index are shown in Table 1 for males and in Table 2 for females. Several of the char\u00ad acteristics vary substantially by vitamin C intake, but the differences are slight between the two upper cate\u00ad gories. It is useful to note the strong correlation be\u00ad tween increasing vitamin C index and more frequent consumption of fruits and vegetables rich in vitamin\nC. This correlation indicates that the 24-hour recall data are consistent with the 3-month food frequency data, even though food intake fluctuates somewhat from day to day for each individual. Thus, individuals at the lower end of the index consume substantially less dietary vitamin C as a group than individuals at the upper end, whether measured by 24-hour recall or 3-month food frequency.\n  While the precise level of vitamin C intake from supplement use in 1971-1974 is not known, an indi-\n\n\n\nTABLE 1.

The consumption levels of these vitamins from multivitamin pills were not determined, but typical multivitamin pills usually contain levels of vitamins C, E, and A at least equal to the RDA, defined in 1980 to be 60 mg per day for vitamin C, 10-15 IU per day for vitamin E, and 5,000 IU per day for vitamin A.26 It is reasonable to assume that those persons regularly using supplements con\u00ad taining vitamin C ingested an average of several hundred milligrams of vitamin C per day, as well as some supplemental vitamin E, vitamin A, and/or other nutrients. The 1982-1984 data indicate changes since 1971-1974 in the regular use of supplements contain\u00ad ing vitamin C.\n  \nTable 3 shows the SMR and  95%  CI  as a function of the vitamin C index for major causes  of  death. Strong inverse trends are evident as a function of increasing vitamin C intake for all causes and all cardiovascular diseases, for males alone and for both sexes combined. There are  weaker  inverse  trends for all cancers and for females.\n  Table 4 shows the SMR as a function of the vitamin C frequency index for major causes of death. Again, strong inverse trends are evident as a function of this second measure of vitamin C intake. Compared with the cohort as a whole, the SMRs for the persons with the highest vitamin C intake are substantially reduced for all causes and all cardiovascular diseases among males, females, and both sexes combined. The SMRs for the highest level of the vitamin C frequency index are in good agreement with the corresponding SMRs for the vitamin C index even though these indices are based on different measures of vitamin C intake.\n\nTABLE 2.

The SMRs for esoph\u00ad agus and stomach cancer mortality among males con\u00ad suming at least 50 mg per day of vitamin C (1.15 and 0.0) appear to be substantially lower than the SMR for males consuming less than 50 mg per day (1.99). The large confidence intervals, however, preclude any con\u00ad clusion that high vitamin C intake has a  protective effect. No similar trend is found for esophagus and stomach cancer among females.  The  small differences in the SMRs for lung cancer are consistent with the minimal differences in  smoking  habits  seen  in Tables 1 and 2. Taken as a whole, the cancer data show no consistent relation to vitamin  C  intake,  but  they  do not rule out the possibility of a small protective effect.\n  Table 6 shows the persistence of the relation of vitamin C index to total mortality  during two follow\u00ad  up periods (up to 5 years and beyond 5 years), in spite  of changes in vitamin C intake over  time. The  relation is stronger during the first 5 years for both males and females, as might  be expected,  inasmuch  as changes in\n\n\ndietary and supplement intake would be less during a shorter follow-up period. Also  shown  is  the  relation of vitamin C intake and mortality, omitting the first 2 years of follow-up, because precursor  states  of illness at the time of initial examination could have influenced the intake of vitamin C. Note that omitting  these  2 years changes the relation only slightly, indicating that any such effect is not large.\n  We used the Cox proportional hazards linear model to fit length of survival up to 5 years or until the end of follow-up to key independent variables.24 25 The independent variables in this analysis are those indi\u00ad cated from Table 1 or 2 or from previous studies to be related to vitamin C intake or mortality. The results are presented in Table 7 in pairs for four models based on sex and length of follow-up. Shown are the coeffi\u00ad cient, standard error, and relative risk comparing high\u00ad est vitamin C index to lowest vitamin C index.

The variables and ordered subgroups within each variable (in parentheses) are as follows: vitamin C index (<50 mg, 50+ mg and no regular supplements, 50+ mg and regular supplements), age (25-74 years), sex (male, female), race (white, nonwhite), history of serious diseases (no, yes), education (0-8, 9-11, 12, 12+ years), cigarette smoking history (never, ever), recreational exercise (little or no, moderate, much), alcohol consumption (never, <1 time per month, 1-4 times per month, 2+ times per week), calories (<1,000, 1,000-1,499, 1,500-1,999, 2,000+), fat (<40, 40-59, 60-79, 80-99, 100+ mg), serum cholesterol (<200, 200-239, 240+ mg per di), and dietary vitamin A (<1,000, 1,000-2,999, 3,000-4,999, 5,000+ IU). The model results are presented for the vitamin C index after adjusting for age and sex only and after adjusting for age, sex, and the 10 potentially confounding variables. Negative coefficient (/3) indicates an inverse relation to mortality; /3 is for each of the two increments in the vitamin C index. Relative risk (RR) compares persons with highest vs lowest vitamin C intake. The 95% CI is based on standard error of /3.\n\n\n\ntially confounding variables: race, history of serious diseases, education, cigarette smoking, recreational ex\u00ad ercise, alcohol consumption, calories, fat, serum cho\u00ad lesterol, and dietary vitamin A. The definition of each variable is given in Table 7. The vitamin C index is a strong predictor of total mortality in each model after controlling for age and sex, consistent with the results in Tables 3 and 6. After adjustment for age, sex, and the 10 variables, the relation of vitamin C index to total mortality still remains strong in all but the last model. The relation is strongest during the first 5 years, as might be expected because of less change in vitamin C intake. During the first 5 years, the 10 variables have very little effect on the strength of the relation: they reduce the coefficient by less than 10%.\n\nDiscussion\nThe NHEFS findings are fairly consistent with the results for the earlier cohort studies in which reduced mortality (total, cardiovascular disease, or stomach can\u00b7 cer) is associated with increased dietary intake of vita min C.6 9\n\nconsuming less than 50 mg per day. Because of rela\u00ad tively few cancer deaths, it is difficult to  compare results here with the case-control studies for  cancer sites where vitamin C has been shown to have a preventive effect.\n  Because of these NHEFS findings, we have re-ana lyzed the data for the 3,119 adults from Alameda County, California, who were followed for 10 years .18 There were no material differences in mortality be\u00ad tween the individuals consuming above and below 250 mg per day of vitamin C, using a crude vitamin C index based on a few dietary sources and vitamin C pills. We have subsequently found, however, that the 227 individuals consuming over 750 mg per day of vitamin C experienced only 7 deaths, which is only about 40% of the total cohort death rate during the\n10 years. Thus, the results for the Alameda and NHEFS cohorts agree to a certain extent.\n  The NHEFS findings are consistent with the hy\u00ad pothesis that high levels of antioxidant vitamins (such as vitamins C, E, and A) increase the body's defense system against free radicals and reduce the risk of\n\nto those of the 1948 survey of elderly residents of San Mateo County, California.6 This  early  study  showed that after 7-year mortality follow-up, 377 individuals consuming more than 50 mg per day of vitamin  C  had  a total death rate only one-half that of 130 individuals\n\narteriosclerosis.5  Furthermore,  the  NHEFS findings\nare plausible in the sense that they are consistent with the secular trends during the last 20 years of large increases in the consumption of supplements contain ing vitamin C3 and large declines in age-adjusted death\n\n\n\n\nrates (total, cardiovascular disease, and stomach cancer) in the general population that are only partially ex\u00ad plained by established risk factors. 27 28 Obviously, we cannot conclude that vitamin C is responsible for the time trends, but it could have contributed to some extent. Also, because of oversampling of the elderly and the poor, the results have occurred primarily among segments of the American population that may experience poor nutrition and could reasonably be expected to benefit from increased vitamin C intake.\nEven if increased vitamin C intake per se has only a\nsmall beneficial effect, the population impact could still be substantial because of the large variations in dietary vitamin C intake and the widespread use of vitamin C supplements. Based on our regression analyses, the inverse relation of total mortality to vitamin C intake is stronger and more consistent in this population than the relation of total mortality to serum cholesterol and dietary fat intake, two variables on which strong public health guidelines have been issued over the years . Furthermore, the inverse relation between vitamin C and mortality in this cohort has been observed in spite of difficulties with dietary measurement and variability, which would tend to weaken an effect.\n\n"
