    "abstract": "Abstract\nObjective: To identify the unique clinical features and biological markers of lung cancer-associated\nstroke.\nMethods: We recruited 102 patients with lung cancer plus stroke, 102 with lung cancer, and\n102 with stroke. Detailed information was analysed and compared among groups.\nResults: The groups were age-matched. Patients with lung cancer plus stroke showed multiple\nlesions involving multiple cerebral artery territories on magnetic resonance imaging, compared\nwith stroke-alone patients. These patients also had a poorer modified Rankin Scale score at\n30 days, and high mortality (18.6%). Patients with lung cancer plus stroke had a higher incidence of\nmetastasis, and higher blood levels of D-dimer, CA125 and CA199 compared with patients with\nlung cancer alone. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that levels of D-dimer, CA125\nand CA199 were independently related to lung cancer-associated stroke.\nConclusion: Elevated plasma D-dimer, CA125 and CA199 may be independent risk factors for\nand biomarkers of lung cancer-associated stroke.\n",

This specific stroke subset is referred\nto as ``cancer-associated stroke''.13 Several\nstudies have reported correlations between\ncancer-associated stroke and high blood\nlevels of D-dimer, the occurrence of multiple\nlesions, and the absence of traditional stroke\nprise a heterogeneous group of disorders\nwith diverse pathologies and varied clinical\ncharacteristics, research into a specific type\nof cancer and its associated stroke might\nhelp us to understand the clinical features\nand pathogenesis of cancer-associated\nstrokes in general.\nLung cancer is the most common type of\ncancer among men and is also associated\nwith the highest mortality, while it has the\nthird highest incidence and second highest\nmortality among women.18 Although the\nincidence of stroke is significantly higher in\npatients with lung cancer,19 the correlation\nis not universally accepted because of the\nsmall sample sizes of the relevant studies.\nFurthermore, studies investigating lung\ncancer-associated stroke (LCAS) have been\nlimited. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to\nspeculate that strokes occurring in some\npatients with lung cancer may be associated\nwith the lung cancer itself, though it is\nunclear if such LCAS has unique clinical\nfeatures and unique biomarkers.\nTo overcome this knowledge gap, the\npresent study retrospectively investigated a\nrelatively large dataset of patients with LCAS\nand analysed the clinical characteristics of\nthis disease entity with respect to its clinical\nfeatures and biological markers.\nPatients and methods\nPatient selection\nAll patients were recruited from the First\nAffiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical\nDecember 2014. The diagnostic criteria for\nactive lung cancer were adopted according\nto Navi et al.20. Active lung cancer was\ndiagnosed on the basis of histopathology of\nlung biopsy specimens. The criteria for\nactive disease included failure to achieve\nclinical cure standards, confirmation of\ncancer recurrence, or occurrence of meta-\nstatic lesions. The diagnosis of acute cere-\nbral infarction was based on the American\nHeart Association diagnostic criteria for\ncerebral infarction,21 i.e., patients presenting\nwith sudden-onset of slurring speech, par-\nalysis and numbness of limbs, or other focal\nneurological deficits. Computed tomog-\nraphy (CT) images also showed no cerebral\nhaemorrhage and magnetic resonance\n(MRI) images showed hyperintense lesions\non T2 and diffusion-weighted images. The\naetiology of cerebral infarction was deter-\nmined according to TOAST criteria.22\nThe diagnosis of LCAS was slightly\nThe coexistence of both lung cancer and\nstroke in the same patient may be coinci-\ndental, and the stroke may be not associated\nwith the lung cancer. To rule out this\npossibility as far as possible, lung cancer\npatients with stroke who also had high risk\nfactors for stroke, such as elevated blood\npressure, atrial fibrillation, diabetes or\nhypercholesterolemia were not considered\nto have LCAS, given that the observed\nstroke in such patients was more likely to\nhave been caused by these factors than by\ntheir lung cancer. LCAS in the present study\nwas therefore defined as the occurrence of\nstroke in patients with active lung cancer\nand an apparent absence of common\nrisk factors. All patients were assessed by\nthree independent experts from oncology,\nneurology and neuro-imaging, who were not\notherwise associated with the planning and\nconduct of the study. The study protocol\nwas approved by the Ethics Committee at\nthe First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi\nWritten informed consent was obtained\nfrom all the participants.\nThe inclusion criteria for patients in the\nLCAS group were as follows: (I) active lung\ncancer; (II) age > 18 years; (III) hospitalized\nand (IV) stroke occurred during treatment of\nlung cancer, or diagnosed with lung cancer\nduring the treatment of stroke. The exclusion\ncriteria were: (I) presence of conventional risk\nfactors for stroke (such as hypertension, atrial\nfibrillation, diabetes or hypercholesterol-\naemia; or (II) lung cancer diagnosed > 5\nyears ago, with no evidence of recurrence or\nmetastasis; (III) metastatic lesions in brain;\n(IV) presence of other neurological diseases;\nand (V) presence of any other malignant\ncondition, in addition to lung cancer.\nThe inclusion criteria for patients with\nischaemic stroke alone were: (I) presence of\nrisk factors for stroke; (II) hospitalized\nand (III) age-and sex-matched to patients\nwith LCAS. The exclusion criteria were: (I)\ncerebral haemorrhage, (II) other neurological\ndiseases; (III) diagnosed with a malignant\ndisorder, and (IV) presence of organ failure.\nThe inclusion criteria for patients with\nlung cancer alone were: (I) patients with\nactive lung cancer; (II) hospitalized between\nage- and sex-matched to patients with\nLCAS. The exclusion criteria were: (I) pres-\nence of brain metastasis; (II) absence of\nactive lung cancer; (III) presence of other\ncancers; and (IV) organ failure.\nData collection and analysis\nThe medical records of the patients were\nscanned for relevant information, including\ndemographic data, routine laboratory inves-\ntigations, D-dimer levels, presence of cancer\npresence of conventional risk factors for\nstroke, relevant clinical data, imaging\nreports (CT scan, MRI, transcranial\nDoppler, magnetic resonance angiography,\ncomputed tomography angiography, and\ndigital subtraction angiography). A modi-\nfied Rankin Scale (mRS) was used to reduce\nthe potential impact of lung cancer on the\nprognosis of stroke, while the Barthel Index\n(BI) was used to assess the prognosis at 30\ndays post-stroke. Details of histological\ntype, metastasis and treatment were also\nobtained in patients with lung cancer.\nStatistical analyses\nAll statistical analyses were performed using\nSPSS 16.0. Quantitative data were analysed\nby analysis of variance or two independent\nt-tests. Frequencies of normally distributed\nvariables were compared using 2 or Fisher's\nexact tests. For variables exhibiting a non-\nnormal distribution (e.g., D-dimer, CA125,\ndifferences were evaluated using Mann \u00ad\nWhitney U tests. Multivariate logistic\nregression analysis was performed to iden-\ntify independent risk factors. P < 0.05 was\nconsidered as statistically significant.\nResults\nSubject characteristics\nA total of 102 patients with LCAS (mean\nyears), and 102 patients with stroke alone\nthe study. Each group included 84 men\nwere comparable among the three groups.\nLCAS group were hospitalized as a result of\nacute cerebral infarction. These patients\nshowed no other symptoms and the diagno-\nsis of lung cancer was made incidentally\nduring the management of stroke in the\ndeveloped cerebral infarction within\n4 months of the diagnosis of lung cancer,\nmonths after their diagnosis of lung cancer\n(Figure 1).\nClinical characterization of stroke\nin patients with lung cancer\nNone of the patients with LCAS had any\nobvious stroke risk factors, such as smoking,\nhypertension, diabetes or hyperlipidaemia.\nThere was no evidence of atrial fibrillation\non electrocardiography, and echocardiog-\nraphy showed no signs of congenital heart\ndisease or valvular disease. Carotid ultra-\nsound, magnetic resonance angiography and\nwhole-brain digital subtraction angiography\nshowed no stenotic lesion in the carotid or\nvertebral basilar arteries. The clinical pres-\nentation in these patients was similar to that\nin patients with stroke alone, including\nhemiplegia or single-limb paralysis, partial-\nbody sensory disturbances, slurring of\nspeech and other focal neurologic deficits.\nHowever, some unique characteristics were\nnoted in these patients, including crypto-\ngenic cerebral infarction, multiple lesions\ninvolving multiple cerebral artery territories\non MRI imaging, low mRS score, and high\nmortality within 30 days of the occurrence of\ncerebral infarction (Table 1 and Figure 2).\nClinical characterization of lung\ncancer in patients with LCAS\nThe clinical presentation of patients with\nLCAS included cough, haemoptysis, chest\npain, dyspnoea and laboured breathing,\nFigure 1. Time interval between lung cancer diagnosis and stroke onset.\nsimilar to that of patients with lung cancer\nalone. There were no differences in the\nhistological characteristics of the lung\ncancer between the two groups. However,\nLCAS patients had a higher frequency of\nmetastasis, and higher levels of D-dimer,\naggressive disease course (Table 2).\nRisk factors for stroke in patients\nwith lung cancer\nTo identify the potential risk factors for\nstroke in patients with lung cancer, we\nanalysed seven significant variables, includ-\nCA199, metastasis, and surgical therapy, by\nmultivariate logistic regression analysis.

Cancer-\nassociated stroke is thought to differ from\nstroke occurring in the general population,\nthough the differences have not been well-\ncharacterized. The current retrospective\nstudy aimed to fill this knowledge gap,\nbased on data from a relatively large\nsample of patients with LCAS.\nMost patients in the present study suf-\nfered from acute stroke within 4 months of\nthe diagnosis of lung cancer, consistent with\nthe findings of other studies. Bengt et al.\nfound that 1.6% of cancer patients devel-\noped stroke within 6 months of the diagnosis\nof cancer,16 and the incidences of stroke in\ncancer patients within 6\u00ad12 months and\nwithin 1\u00ad5 years of cancer diagnosis were\nalso reported a higher incidence of stroke in\ncancer patients in the first 6 months after the\ndiagnosis of cancer. Collectively, these\nresults suggest that a diagnosis of cancer\nshould prompt consideration of stroke-pre-\nvention therapy in addition to chemother-\napy, especially within 6 months of cancer\ndiagnosis.\nPrevious studies revealed that most\npatients with cancer-associated stroke had\nLCAS in the current study were defined as\nhaving active lung cancer and acute stroke,\nbut without any other stroke risks factors.\nIn the present study, patients with LCAS\nhad elevated levels of plasma D-dimer and\nFigure 2.

Further analysis\nshowed that elevated levels of plasma\nall independent risk factors for stroke in\npatients with active lung cancer.\nThe pathogenesis of stroke in cancer\npatients has been a focus of attention.\nElevated D-dimer levels and multiple lesions\nin multiple artery territories in patients with\ncancer-associated stroke suggest that the\nhypercoagulable state in cancer patients\nmay be an underlying reason for this\nassociation. However, the mechanisms\nresponsible for the development of a hyper-\ncoagulable state in cancer patients remain\nunclear. Previous studies investigating\nthis topic usually included patients with\nmultiple anatomic types of cancer, along\nwith stroke.\nThe present study showed that elevated\nplasma levels of D-dimer, CD125 and\nCA199 were independent risk factors for\nstroke in patients with active lung cancer,\nand that D-dimer levels were positively\nWe therefore concluded that elevated\nonly act as biomarkers of lung cancer, but\nmay also play a role in increasing the\nhypercoagulable state in lung cancer\npatients. Significantly increased CA125\nlevels have also been reported to be related\nto recurrent stroke.36 However, the mech-\nanisms whereby elevated plasma levels of\nstate in lung cancer patients, leading to\nstroke, need further investigation.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant funding\nfrom any funding agency in the public, commer-\ncial, or not-for-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
