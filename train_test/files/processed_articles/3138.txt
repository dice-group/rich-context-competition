Emotion suppression\nproduces more negative, not positive, emotions and more\ninauthentic feelings (Cheung and Park, 2010; Gross and\nlogical aspects, suppression relates to higher levels of\ndepressive symptoms, lower levels of life satisfaction, and\nless social support (English et al., 2012; Gross and John,\n2003). Despite its common occurrence, emotion suppres-\nsion involves psychological, social, cognitive, and physio-\nlogical costs, contributing to higher levels of stress.\nNevertheless, relatively few theory-driven studies have\nexamined how emotion regulation serves as an explanatory\nmechanism in the etiology of specific psychological disor-\nders such as perceived stress. However, during the last few\ndecades, research on anger regulation within emotion regu-\nlation has increasingly focused on perceived stress.\nAccording to Spielberger (1999), the definition of anger\nregulation applies to those people who often experience\nanger; however, people do not always express their anger\noutwardly. In fact, the various ways in which one can\nexpress anger are critical variables. Therefore, in this study,\nit is essential to distinguish expressions of anger, social\nanxiety, and personality differences in an individual's\nproneness to anger regulation in its effect on perceived\nstress. The exploratory function and role of anger regula-\ntion can be divided into three dimensions: anger suppres-\nsion, outward anger expression, and controlled anger\nexpression. However, the effects of these dimensions of\nanger regulation--anger suppression (anger-in (AI)), out-\nward anger expression (anger-out (AO)), and control of\nanger expression (anger control (AC)) together--individu-\nally and socially, as mediated by social anxiety on per-\nceived stress, have not been extensively examined in\ncross-cultural research.\nTherefore, this study examined the cultural underpin-\nnings of these three approaches to anger regulation and per-\nceived stress, mediated by social anxiety. First, the study\nreviews the social science literature regarding relationships\nEffects of anger regulation and social\nanxiety on perceived stress\nAyano Yamaguchi1, Min-Sun Kim2, Satoshi Akutsu3\nand Atsushi Oshio4\n Keywords\nanxiety, culture, emotions, stress, well-being\n1National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies, Tokyo, Japan\n2University of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, USA\n3Hitotsubashi University, Tokyo, Japan\n4Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan\nCorresponding author:\nAyano Yamaguchi, National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies, 7-22-1\nEmail: a-yamaguchi@grips.ac.jp\nReport of empirical study\n2 Health Psychology Open \namong the three approaches in anger regulation and social\nanxiety. Second, it attempts to explain the three approaches\nfrom a cross-cultural perspective. Third, it examines stress\nand health from a cross-cultural perspective. Fourth, the\nstudy proposes a cross-cultural approach, specifying its\ninfluence on perceived stress. Fifth, the study explores the\nconceptual model and analyzes results. The concluding\nsection discusses this research's implications and limita-\ntions, including directions for future research.\nCulture and emotional control: anger regulation\nCulture plays an important role in socially shared and trans-\nmitted information systems, which are reinforced by norms,\nvalues, beliefs, and everyday practices. In general, people in\nEuropean\u00adAmerican cultures differ widely from people in\nEast Asian cultures in how they view emotions, mostly urg-\ning other members of their culture to control feelings through\nemotional regulation. Cultures are characterized by empha-\nsis on either independence or interdependence (Markus and\nsuggest that independent self-construal refers to autonomy,\nuniqueness, and the personal aspects of one's self-concept,\nsuch as traits. In contrast, interdependent self-construal refers\nto interpersonal aspects of self-concept, such as social expec-\ntations, social harmony, and social and group memberships.\nEuropean\u00adAmerican cultures, which value highly independ-\nent self-construal, are more likely to emphasize the self as\nseparate from the social context and to focus on autonomy,\nindependence, and individual self-esteem, which constitute\nindependent self-construal. East Asian cultures, which\nencourage highly interdependent self-construal, are more\nlikely to emphasize the self as a constituent of a broader\nsocial context. East Asian cultures' concept of self encom-\npasses characteristics and qualities of the social environ-\nment, social expectations, social harmony, social and group\nmemberships, and collective self-esteem, which constitute\ninterdependent self-construal (Singelis, 1994).\nPeople in East Asian cultures tend to control their emo-\ntions and feelings more frequently than do people in\nEuropean\u00adAmerican cultures. In East Asian cultures, emo-\ntional control can have various meanings. A more concrete\nand differentiated theoretical framework for addressing\nindividual differences could focus on emotional control in\nemotional regulation, particularly anger regulation. For\nexample, people in European\u00adAmerican cultures with high\nindependence are more likely to value uniqueness and indi-\nvidual self-expression strongly, and they are more likely to\nencourage other members of their culture to express their\ninner thoughts and feelings openly. However, people in\nEast Asian cultures with high interdependence are more\nlikely to treat the self as fundamentally connected to others.\nThus, people in East Asian cultures are more likely to value\nconformity and cooperation strongly, and they are more\nlikely to encourage other members of their culture to\ncontrol thoughts and feelings that might interfere with\ninterpersonal harmony. Therefore, people in European\u00ad\nAmerican cultures are less likely to use anger suppression\nfrequently than are people in East Asian cultures. Such\nregulation influences anger expression of core aspects,\nsuch as emotions linked to self-construal (English et al.,\nAnger regulation refers to regulation of one emotion. In\nthis study, anger regulation is divided into three types:\nanger suppression (AI), outward anger expression (AO),\nand controlled anger expression (AC). First, anger suppres-\nsion (AI) is defined as the inhibition of anger. In suppress-\ning anger, individuals regulate their feelings in their minds;\nfor example, they withdraw from others, pout, or sulk\n(Spielberger, 1999). Anger suppression is recognized as\none function of anger regulation, but it has also been asso-\nciated with conflict avoidance, guilt, irritability, rumina-\ntion, depressive symptoms, and decreased life satisfaction\nand subjective well-being (Gross and John, 2003; Martin\npression might be related to mental health problems that\nlead to high levels of perceived stress. Second, outward\nanger expression (AO) is defined as the expression of anger\ntoward others. In this case, individuals express their feel-\nings of anger outwardly; for example, they slam doors and\nsay nasty things. Previous research findings show that out-\nward expression of anger is likely to reduce negative emo-\ntionsandparadoxicallypromoteshigherlevelsofwell-being\nand lower perceived stress (English et al., 2012; Gross and\nJohn, 2003). Third, controlled anger expression is defined\nas the primary reduction of the internal experience of anger,\nand run the risk of ignoring the adaptive functions of anger.\nThese experiences of anger are more likely to fail to recog-\nnize the importance of experience of anger in order to allow\nthe physiological and psychological processes with the\naccompanying the anger experience to affect their experi-\nence. Thus, the difficult emotions and complexities can be\nabsorbed, and other experiences and behaviors can proceed\nProposed model\nThis study aims to obtain a better understanding of the rela-\ntionship role among three types of anger regulation--anger\nsuppression (AI), outward anger expression (AO), and con-\ntrolled anger expression (AC)--and social anxiety on per-\nceived stress for older American and Japanese adults in a\ncross-cultural context. In particular, this study seeks to\nascertain the degree to which people engage in social anxi-\nety as mediator and then determine influences that such\nthought processes exert on levels of perceived stress. Thus,\nthe study expects three types of anger regulation and social\nanxiety to be associated with levels of perceived stress\nacross cultures. The study's measures might address the\nrole of the cross-cultural outlook as it influences reports of\nYamaguchi et al. 3\nperceived stress. Figure 1 provides a graphical presentation\nof the conceptual model that links these factors.\nMethod\nParticipants\nThis study used mainly Midlife in the United States\n(MIDUS) Project 4 of the second wave of MIDUS (i.e.\nMIDUS II) for US participants. MIDUS II contains longi-\ntudinal follow-up data from MIDUS I. For the US partici-\npants of MIDUS II, the subsample (N=1255) of the original\nMIDUS study (MIDUS I) was used. This study can use\nonly MIDUS II Project 4 since some measurements and\nscales of MIDUS I are irrelevant to this study. In this study,\nThe Japanese participants were the parallel data set of\nMIDUS, called Midlife in Japan (MIDJA) (N=1027).\nIn 2008, a comparison sample of middle-aged Japanese\nadults was obtained. Many of the same psychological vari-\nables measured in the MIDUS II data set were measured in\nthe Japanese data set, including the measures of independ-\nent and interdependent self-construal. Original MIDUS\nscale items were translated and then back-translated by\nnative Japanese speakers (Park et al., 2013).\nAnalysis plan\nThis study aimed to explore the relationship among anger\nsuppression, outward anger expression, and controlled\nanger expression in anger regulation, social anxiety, and\nperceived stress. We developed a model using structural\nequation modeling (SEM) to specify relationships among\nthese variables. Then, we examined findings to determine\nwhether the model was equal to pass coefficients from each\nfactor among older American and Japanese adults. Next,\nwe examined whether all-factor patterns appeared among\nolder American and Japanese adults. To address this issue,\nwe tested the model by conducting an SEM analysis with\nthe software AMOS SPSS for Windows (Bentler, 1990).\nRegarding the model fit index scores, for example, we cal-\nculated the goodness of fit (GFI) using a covariance matrix.\nRaykov et al. (1991) suggested calculating SEM results\nusing four fit indices--GFI and comparative fit index\n(CFI)--and the root mean square error of approximation\n(RMSEA). A model fit of .95 and above and an RMSEA of\n.06 or less signify a good model fit (Bentler, 1990; Bollen,\n(AIC) is a comparative measure of fit, and so it is meaning-\nful only when two different models are estimated. Lower\nvalues indicate better fit, and so the model with the lowest\nAIC is the best (Akaike, 1973). Finally, our data analysis\nrelied primarily on the pass coefficient significance test and\nthe critical ratios for differences between parameters to\naddress culturally specific pathway models and culturally\ndifferent patterns.\nMeasurement instruments\nThis study assessed anger regulation to measure angry feel-\nings with the State Trait Anger Regulation Inventory\n(STAXI; Spielberger, 1999). The STAXI integrates two\npreviously developed inventories: the State Trait Anger\nAI\nAO\nAC\nPSS\nSA\nFigure 1. Proposed model.\nAI: anger-in; AO: anger-out; AC: anger control; SA: social anxiety; PSS: perceived stress scale.\nThis is the hypothetical model.\n4 Health Psychology Open \nScale and the Anger Regulation (AX) Scale. Five inde-\npendent subscales constitute the STAXI: state anger, trait\nanger, anger suppression (AI), outward anger expression\n(AO), and controlled anger expression (AC). A sixth scale\nconstitutes three subscales designed to measure patterns of\nanger suppression and outward anger expression (AI and\nAO), as well as the frequency of an individual attempting to\ncontrol his or her anger expression (AC), with each state-\nment on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree)\nto 7 (strongly agree). Anger suppression (AI) refers to the\nextent to which one can control one's angry feelings or sup-\npress angry or furious feelings, or lose one's mind. The\nanger suppression (AI) scale has eight subscale items.\nThese items are as follows: in general, when I feel angry or\nfurious (1) I withdraw from people; (2) I pout or sulk; (3) I\nam angrier than I am willing to admit; (4) I am secretly\ncritical of others; (5) I boil inside, but do not show it; (6) I\nharbor grudges; (7) I keep things in; and (8) I am irritated\nmore than others are aware. Outward anger expression\n(AO) refers to the extent to which one can express one's\nangry or furious feelings, or lose one's mind. The outward\nanger expression (AO) scale has eight subscale items.\nThese items are as follows: in general, when I feel angry or\nfurious (1) I slam doors; (2) I say nasty things; (3) I make\nsarcastic remarks; (4) I argue with others; (5) I lose my tem-\nper; (6) I strike out at whatever infuriates me; (7) I express\nmy anger; and (8) If someone annoys me I tell them how I\nfeel. The controlled anger expression (AC) refers to one's\nability to control one's angry or furious feelings, or lose\none's mind, in the context of physical or verbal expression\nand communication. The controlled anger expression (AC)\nscale has four subscale items. These items are as follows: in\ngeneral, when I feel angry or furious (1) I control my tem-\nper; (2) I keep my cool; (3) I calm down fast; and (4) I make\n(AC) in Japan. Thus, these measurement models were\naccepted because all the relevant indices had good values in\nThis study used the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale to\nmeasure social anxiety, that is, a comparison of the psycho-\nmetric properties of self-report and clinician-administered\nformats (Fresco et al., 2001). This scale has nine subscale\nitems, and we asked the participants to indicate their degree\nof agreement with each statement on a 7-point scale rang-\ning from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). It has\nnine subscale items: (1) Talking to people in authority; (2)\nGoing to a party; (3) Working while being observed; (4)\nCalling someone you don't know well; (5) Talking with\npeople you don't know very well; (6) Being the center of\nattention; (7) Expressing a disagreement or disapproval to\npeople you don't know very well; (8) Returning goods to a\nstore; and (9) Resisting a high-pressure salesperson.\nCronbach's alphas were .85 in the United States and .89 in\nJapan. Thus, these measurement models were accepted\nbecause all the relevant indices had good values in this\nstudy. The mean score was 1.83 in the United States and\nIn addition, this study employed the Perceived Stress\nScale to measure stress status (Cohen et al., 1983). This\nscale has 10 subscale items, and we asked the participants\nto indicate their degree of agreement with each statement\non a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7\n(strongly agree): In the last month, how often have you (1)\nbeen upset because of something that happened unexpect-\nedly? (2) felt that you were unable to control the important\nthings in your life? (3) felt nervous and stressed? (4) felt\nconfident about your ability to handle your personal prob-\nlems?

(8) felt\nthat you were on top of things? (9) been angered because of\nthings that were outside of your control? (10) felt difficul-\nties were piling up so high that you couldn't overcome\nthem? Cronbach's alphas were .86 in the United States and\n.76 in Japan. Thus, these measurement models were\naccepted because all the relevant indices had good values in\nthis study. The mean score was 22.24 in the United States\nResults\nPreliminary analyses\nDescriptive statistics for this study's sample are presented\nin Table 1. The study used SEM to develop a model that\nspecifies relationships among the relevant variables. We\nthen analyzed findings to determine whether SEM results\nwere equal to pass coefficients for each factor among the\nsamples of older American and Japanese adults. In addi-\ntion, we examined whether all-factor patterns emerged\namong the samples. Confirmatory factor analysis specified\nand GFI values of data were then used in conjunction with\nTable 1.

Since previous cross-cultural\nresearch findings generally identify cross-cultural differ-\nences between individualistic and collectivistic groups in\nterms of perceived stress levels and assessments, differ-\nences were possible between older American and Japanese\nadults in our sample in terms of anger regulation and rela-\ntionships among these variables.\nWe tested whether patterns of all-factor loadings were\nidentical between older American and Japanese adults; in\naddition, confirmatory factor analysis established meas-\nurement equivalence of anger expression between these\ntwo cultural groups. Two hierarchically nested models\nwere compared as follows: an unconstrained model (free\nconstrained model), in which no constraints were placed\non factor loadings between the two cultural groups, and a\nconstrained one, in which the factor loadings were con-\nstrained to be equal for the two groups. First, the uncon-\nstrained model (free constrained model) provided a good\nSecond, when the factor loadings were constrained to be\nequal between the two cultural groups, the fit was no\nResults scarcely differed from those for the unconstrained\nmodel (free model) (Figure 2).\nThese findings establish factor equivalence between the\ntwo cultural groups. The results indicate that the measure-\nment model was metrically equivalent between the two cul-\ntures and that it could thus serve as a baseline in subsequent\nanalyses (Cheung and Rensvold, 2002). The covariance\namong AI, AO, and AC was significant at p<.001, save for\nAO to AC for the older Japanese adult sample. This is the\nmost parsimonious model still to provide excellent data\nConfirmatory factor analysis was used to assess correla-\ntion analysis with the key (latent) variables in the American\nand Japanese samples. Table 2 displays the study's correla-\ntion matrix; as one can see, most of the correlations were\nsignificant at p\n<\n.001. Ultimately, this study explored the\nrelationship between each of the three types of anger regu-\nlation (AI, AO, and AC) and social anxiety in terms of per-\nceived stress.\nMain analyses\nOur intention was to develop an anger regulation mediation\nmodel using a cross-cultural approach, with social anxiety\nserving as a mediator between anger regulation (AI, AO,\nand AC) and perceived stress. To test for any culture-spe-\ncific pathways in the proposed path model, we constrained\nall paths to be equal across the US and Japanese samples.\nThe study's primary objective was to propose and test a\nmodel delineating the process by which the three types of\nanger suppression--AI, AO, and AC--influence perceived\nstress. The model also incorporates social anxiety as the\npotential mediating factor for perceived stress. The study\nperformed a path analysis to test the integrated model.\nFigure 2 lists the path coefficients within such a model.\nAs shown in Figure 2, for American older adult samples,\nanger suppression (AI) positively influenced social anxiety\n(=.51, p<.01), outward anger expression (AO) negatively\naffected social anxiety (=-.10, p<.01), controlled anger\nexpression(AC)relatednegativelytosocialanxiety(=-.13,\nAI\nAO\nAC\nPSS\nSA\nFigure 2.

For example, the common processes are the\nrelationship between controlled anger expression and social\nanxiety in relation to perceived stress, and between con-\ntrolled anger expression and perceived stress. The study\nalso found cross-cultural differences in relationships\nbetween anger suppression and social anxiety in relation to\nperceived stress and between anger suppression and per-\nceived stress. Cross-cultural differences emerged in the\ncovariance between anger suppression and outward anger\nexpression, between outward anger expression and con-\ntrolled anger expression, and between anger suppression\nand controlled anger expression.\nDiscussion and conclusion\nThis study mainly clarified the role of social anxiety medi-\nated by the relationship between the three types of anger\nregulation and perceived stress. The results indicated that\nthe relationship between anger suppression (AI) and per-\nceived stress mediated by social anxiety was the result of\ncross-cultural differences between the United States and\nJapan. Compared to people in the United States, people in\nJapan are more likely to suppress their anger and to experi-\nence social anxiety, leading to high levels of perceived\nstress. This study identified the role of social anxiety medi-\nated by the relationship between AO and perceived stress in\nthe United States, not in Japan, as an indirect effect. In the\nUnited States, people who tend to express their anger out-\nwardly are less likely to feel social anxiety leading to high\nstress levels, but not in Japan. This study clarified the role\nof AO and perceived stress as the direct path effect in the\nUnited States, but not in Japan. This study also investigated\nsocial anxiety mediated by AC and perceived stress in the\nUnited States as an indirect effect, but not in Japan. In the\nUnited States, people who tend to control their anger are\nless likely to feel social anxiety, which leads to high levels\nof stress, but not in Japan. This study also identified the role\nof AC and perceived stress as direct path effects in the\nUnited States, but not in Japan.\nThis study identified pathways of the relationship\nbetween anger suppression (AI) in anger regulation and per-\nceived stress mediated by social anxiety resulting from\ncross-cultural differences between the United States and\nJapan. Our theoretical framework led us to distinguish three\napproaches to anger regulation and to hypothesize the rela-\ntionship among these approaches and perceived stress medi-\nated by social anxiety. The study found that anger\nsuppression was a significant factor in perceived stress\nmediated by social anxiety as the hypothesized indirect\neffect. Anger suppression was also related to perceived\nstress as the hypothesized direct effect. The correlation\nbetween anger suppression and social anxiety was stronger\nin Japan than in the United States. Thus, this study found\nthat, primarily, the role of anger suppression in the three\napproaches to anger regulation reflects cross-cultural differ-\nences between the United States and Japan.\nThis integrated approach allowed us to examine the the-\noretical model's external validity, as well as its culture-spe-\ncific boundary conditions. The study's main findings are\nunique in that they represent the first attempt to explore this\nemotion regulation model with social anxiety of cross-cul-\nturally perceived stress among middle-aged people in the\nUnited States and Japan. The SEM results showed that\nanger suppression was a significant factor of the effects of\nsocial anxiety on perceived stress among middle-aged peo-\nple in the United States and Japan.\nThese novel findings build upon, and are consistent\nwith, emerging research in emotion regulation. First, our\napplied model, based on the model of emotion regulation\n(Gross and John, 2003), extends this theoretical work by\nproviding initial empirical evidence of the model's applica-\nbility to older American and Japanese adults. The media-\ntion model's generally good fit demonstrated that anger\nsuppression does entail costs in regard to mental health out-\ncomes--specifically, perceived stress. This is consistent\nwith prior findings that emotion suppression is often asso-\nciated with negative psychosocial consequences (Gross and\nThird, the results represent an important contribution\ntoward building an empirical knowledge base of three dis-\ntinct approaches to anger regulation (anger suppression,\noutward anger expression, and AC). This study also found\nthat, to reduce their social anxiety, those who have high\nanger suppression (AI) with independence and uniqueness\ntend toward low levels of perceived stress in US samples.\nThis sample comprised middle-aged American and\nJapanese adults, and perhaps these age groups are more\nlikely to be concerned with their in-group (e.g. family)\ncounterparts than with younger generations.\nOur findings might suggest that the dominant, self-\nfocused manifestation relates to social anxiety as a social\nphobia within the Western cultural context. In contrast, the\ndominant other-focused manifestation relates to social anx-\niety as a social phobia within East Asian cultural contexts,\nsuch as Japan (Russell, 1989), which are more likely to be\nother-focused (Nakamura et al., 2002); this could be due to\nexcessive concern about embarrassing oneself in public.\nThe primary concern of socially anxious people is the\npotential to offend, which drives them to avoid others and\ncauses trouble for others as a result of inappropriate behav-\niors (Norasakkunkit et al., 2012). This study's main contri-\nbution is to advance understanding of the function and role\nof anger suppression, outward anger expression, and social\nanxiety in regard to lower levels of perceived stress. The\neffects and role of anger suppression and outward anger\nexpression on low levels of perceived stress were clarified.\nOur findings indicate that indirect effects of anger suppres-\nsion and outward anger expression on perceived stress also\n8 Health Psychology Open \nhave a direct effect on anger suppression and perceived\nstress in older American and Japanese adult samples. The\nresults indicate that anger suppression and outward anger\nexpression should not be ignored when considering social\nanxiety as the key factor that triggers perceived stress\nMethodologically, this study addressed some gaps in the\ncurrent literature on emotion regulation. Given prior rec-\nommendations (John and Gross, 2004), we closely exam-\nined regulation of one discrete emotion (namely, anger)\nrather than studying emotion regulation globally. The focus\non anger was also advantageous from a cultural perspec-\ntive, in that this emotion has demonstrated extensive vari-\nability across cultures in terms of its psychological and\nsocial impacts (Markus and Kitayama, 1991). Very little\nempirical research has investigated the role of cultural con-\ntext; this study was, therefore, precisely designed to do so.\nFinally, we used confirmatory factor analysis to test the\nrelationship between the variables of interest.\nOverall, this study explored a theoretical model of emo-\ntion regulation (Gross and John, 2003) and its effects on\nperceived stress mediated by social anxiety in nationally\nrepresentative older American and Japanese adult samples.\nThese study findings are among the first to test this mod-\nel's cross-cultural applicability. Moreover, the results\nhighlighted the importance of cultural context in demon-\nstrating moderation of the anger suppression\u00addepression\nlink based on interdependent self-construal. Understanding\nboth the universal and the culture-specific aspects of emo-\ntion regulation's role in the development of depression and\nother forms of psychopathology is essential to enable\neffective prevention and intervention efforts across diverse\npopulations.\nLimitations and implications for future\nstudy\nThe study's limitations should also be explained to help\nadvance further research. First, this study relied primarily\non self-reported measures and scales, and thus, various data\ncollection methods should be used to make the findings and\ninformation useful in further research. Second, since the\nnationally representative data sets were limited to the\nUnited States and Japan in terms of cultural variations, for\nfurther study, data should be obtained from different loca-\ntions and regions, such as European countries, Asian coun-\ntries (with the exception of Japan), and/orAfrican countries.\nThird, this study indicates that anger suppression and out-\nward anger expression have unique pathways to perceived\nstress mediated by social anxiety across cultures. Anger\nsuppression and outward anger expression might not be\ncontextual and culture-dependent, but rather universal, and\nthey could be further elicited by environmental cues\n(Oyserman, 2011); therefore, this study could suggest\nimplications of increasing and developing perceived stress\nmediated by social anxiety. For example, since this study\nfound associations among anger suppression, outward\nanger expression, controlled anger expression, and social\nanxiety and identified effects of perceived stress, such prac-\ntical implications might be the necessary first step in fur-\nther research. Fourth, the cross-sectional research design is\nlimited to discerning causal foundations. To address this\nissue, a longitudinal research design and data should be\nused to identify causal foundations.\nThe findings in this study may have important clinical\nand practical implications. Further research should focus\non health status. Interventions should be different across\ncultures with respect to health status and conditions. This\nstudy suggests that we need to create a counseling interven-\ntion program that considers cross-cultural differences and\nvalidations of symptoms of depression. For Euro-\nAmericans, interventions should increase the sense of con-\ntrol, which may originally come from cultural affordances.\nFor Asians, interventions should be based on relational ori-\nentations and socially supportive networks, which may\noriginally come from cultural affordances. For example,\naccording to Uchida, Kitayama, Mesquita, Reyes, and\nMorling (2008), indigenous psychotherapies in Japan, such\nas naikan therapy, are more likely to emphasize the cultiva-\ntion of a patient's reflective awareness of his or her depend-\nencies and indebtedness to others (Ishiyama, 1986). Such\ntherapies and intervention programs in Japan may be effec-\ntive and consistent with American therapies that focus on\nFurther research is needed with clinical populations.\nOne salient idea is that developing compassion, which is an\naspect of Buddhist theory, and understanding ideas of lov-\ning kindness toward self and others in counseling and ther-\napy may be important for an individual in promoting\nemotional well-being and obtaining a better health status.\nIn addition, further research is needed to explore how to\nachieve this, in that those who are highly self-critical and\nmay have experienced little warmth in their daily lives may\nfind it frightening to be compassionate to the self (Uchida\nIn conclusion, this study might be able, conceptually\nand operationally, to increase our understanding of per-\nceived stress in different cultural contexts; more specifi-\ncally, the proposed model of perceived stress should focus\non individuals' anger suppression, outward anger expres-\nsion, and controlled anger expression because these self-\nviews serve as clues to other cultural and individual values\nand behaviors that fit into perceived stress, health, and\nwell-being.\n"
