We then\npresent a theoretical distinction which has been made between three facets of metacognition, namely metacognitive experiences,\nmetacognitive knowledge, and metacognitive strategies (e.g., Efklides, 2008; Flavell, 1979). Referring back to the vignette examples\nfrom metaemotion research, we argue that a similar distinction can be drawn between three facets of metaemotion, namely\nmetaemotional experiences, metaemotional knowledge, and metaemotional strategies. We argue that this distinction clarifies some\nof the unresolved issues in metaemotion research, and therefore has important implications for the study of metaemotion, both\nmethodologically and theoretically.\n",
    "reduced_content": "Emotion Review\ner.sagepub.com\nThe concept of \"metaemotion\" was first introduced by Gottman\net al. (1996) within family therapy research. They claimed that\nparents differ with respect to the way they feel and think about\ntheir own and their children's emotions, which in turn affects\nthe way they approach emotions in everyday life. This organ-\nized set of feelings and thoughts about emotions was referred to\nas \"metaemotional philosophy.\" Gottman et al. demonstrated\nthat various outcome variables in middle childhood (e.g., aca-\ndemic achievement) were related to the metaemotional philoso-\nphy of parents.\nSince then, the concept has been adopted and explored fur-\nther by researchers within both philosophy and psychology.\nAn overview of a philosophical perspective on metaemotion is\nprovided by Mendon\u00e7a (2013). Within psychology, metaemo-\ntion has been the focus of interest in a variety of different sub-\ndisciplines, including personality psychology (Mitmansgruber,\nBeck, H\u00f6fer, & Sch\u00fc\u00dfler, 2009), media psychology (Bartsch,\nAppel, & Storch, 2010; Bartsch, Vorderer, Mangold, &\npsychology (Shaver, Veilleux, & Ham, 2013), which will be\nexemplified next. As will be illustrated in what follows, there\nis to date no consensus across psychological disciplines with\nregard to how metaemotion is defined, beyond the general\nagreement that metaemotions involve \"emotions about emo-\ntions.\"\nGottman et al. (1996) pointed to the parallel between metae-\nmotion, \"emotion about emotion,\" and metacognition, \"cogni-\ntion about cognition,\" in that they are involved in the executive\ncontrol of emotion and cognition, respectively. However, few\nattempts have been made to explicitly draw parallels between\nthe two research areas. Our aim is to show how distinctions\nmade within metacognition research may be usefully applied to\nmetaemotion research, in order to clarify the concept of metae-\nmotion further. A larger consensus on how metaemotion could\nbe defined and what components it may consist of would make\nit easier to compare and combine findings across different stud-\nies, and may provide a starting point for developing a broader\ntheoretical model of metaemotion. In addition, a clarification of\nthe concept of metaemotion may broaden the potential range of\nmeasures by which it can be assessed.\nIt should be noted that metaemotion is closely related to\n\"meta-mood\" (Mayer & Gaschke, 1988). While metaemotion\nrefers to \"emotions about emotions,\" \"meta-mood\" has been\ndefined as a reflective process that accompanies mood states,\nmore specifically, an \"ongoing process associated with moods\nwhereby individuals continually reflect upon their feelings,\nThe Concept of \"Metaemotion\": What is There\nto Learn From Research on Metacognition?\nElisabeth Norman and Bjarte Furnes\nFaculty of Psychology, University of Bergen, Norway\n Keywords\nexperience, knowledge, metaemotion, strategies\nCorresponding author: Elisabeth Norman, Faculty of Psychology, University of Bergen, Christiesgate 12, 5020 Bergen, Norway.

However, the difference between\nmeta-mood and metaemotion as it is treated in the literature is\nnot always clear. For example some self-report items used to\nassess meta-mood are in fact concerned with emotions (e.g.,\nthe Trait Meta-Mood Scale item \"I never give in to my emo-\ntions\"; Salovey et al., 1995). Thus many of the points raised in\nthis article would therefore also apply to research on meta-\nmood. Nevertheless, the differences between meta-mood and\nmetaemotion should be discussed and studied further in the\nfuture.\nSome Central Properties of Metaemotion\nIn a review of some central psychological and philosophical\narticles on metaemotion, Mendon\u00e7a (2013) points to a central\nproperty of metaemotion that qualifies it as a separate and dis-\ntinguishable concept within emotion theory. This property is\nreflexivitiy, that is, that the experience of a metaemotion may\nhave an impact on the first-order emotion, which may in turn\nchange the meaning of the emotional experience itself. One\nexample is when a \"blush of embarrassment may be intensified\nImportantly, Mendon\u00e7a points out that when parents and teach-\ners educate children about emotions this will necessarily have to\noccur through reflections about metaemotion. Mendon\u00e7a also\naddresses some unresolved questions in metaemotion research,\nfor instance whether there are limits to the number of layers of\nmetaemotion (e.g., is it meaningful to talk about an emotion\nabout an emotion about an emotion?), the extent to which the\nphenomenology of emotion and metaemotion can be under-\nstood separately, whether certain types of emotion can only\noccur at a certain level, and whether metaemotions are generally\nveridical.\nMendon\u00e7a (2013), who represents a philosophical tradition,\npoints to the need for more research on metaemotion, including\na more precise clarification of the concept and how it relates to\nneighbouring phenomena. In the following, we first present a\nsmall selection of empirical research on metaemotion taken\nfrom different psychological subdisciplines. The aim is to\nexemplify how metaemotion has been defined and measured\nwithin different studies, and to show how metaemotion has been\nfound to predict various outcome variables. Moreover, this sec-\ntion is intended to show that the clarifications requested by\nMendon\u00e7a are also clearly needed within empirical psychologi-\ncal research on metaemotion. We then turn to a different psy-\nchological research area, namely metacognition research. Our\nintention is to show how theoretical distinctions drawn within\nthis area can be transferred to metaemotion research in order to\nmore precisely clarify the concept. In our opinion, this would be\nuseful both from a theoretical and from an applied empirical\nstandpoint.\nStudies and Definitions of Metaemotion:\nSome Examples\nMitmansgruber et al. (2009) broadly define metaemotion as\nemotional reactions about one's \"emotional self.\" They claim\nthat metaemotion has a regulatory function, and that its phe-\nnomenological quality (e.g., anxiety, anger, compassion)\nreflects qualities of self-regulation, for example, its associated\nmotivation and action tendency. In a nonclinical sample they\nfound that individual differences in metaemotion predicted sub-\njective well-being over and above the related variables trait\nmindfulness and experiential avoidance. In this study, metae-\nmotion was measured with the Meta-Emotion Scale, a self-\nreport questionnaire assessing six components of metaemotion\n(anger, compassionate care, interest, contempt/shame, thought\ncontrol, and suppression).\nAccording to Bartsch et al. (2010), metaemotions are emo-\ntions that have other emotions as their appraisal object. They are\nrelated to \"concerns beyond the scope of the primary emotion\"\nand involve \"affective reactions toward the primary emotion,\nand motivation to change the expected course of the primary\nemotion\" (Bartsch et al., 2008, p. 16). In a field study among\nmoviegoers who watched drama or horror films (Bartsch et al.,\n2010), stable individual differences in metaemotion, which\ncould be referred to as \"trait\" metaemotion, were measured by\nthe Need For Affect Scale (Maio & Esses, 2001). This scale\nconsists of two dimensions, namely the tendency to approach\nversus avoid emotions. Primary emotions elicited by the mov-\nies, and emotions about current primary emotions, which could\nbe referred to as \"state\" metaemotions, were both assessed with\nself-report questionnaires. Two factors in state metaemotion\nwere identified--metaemotion enjoyment (e.g., \"I like this feel-\ning\") and metaemotion normative appreciation (e.g., \"I find\nthese feelings embarrassing\"). Need for affect scores predicted\nthe intensity, valence, and ambivalence of primary emotions,\nand differences in state metaemotions: high need for affect\navoidance predicted lower metaemotion enjoyment and norma-\ntive appreciation, whereas higher need for affect approach pre-\ndicted a higher tendency to view one's emotions as normatively\nadequate. The only effect of movie type (drama vs. horror) was\nthat drama movies were associated with more negative emotion.\nKoven's (2011) study is concerned with utilitarian reason-\ning, that is, \"in which action for the good of many is tantamount\neven at the expense of the good of one.\" The hypothesis is that\nthe tendency to make utilitarian decisions, assumed to require\ncognitive control of emotion, is related to individual differences\nin metaemotion. Metaemotion is here regarded as a set of strate-\ngies relevant for using emotional information adaptively,\nincluding \"the ability to pay attention to emotions, discriminate\namong emotions, verbally label emotions, and regulate emo-\nassessed by presentation of \"high-conflict\" personal moral\ndilemmas concerning \"whether it is appropriate to harm one\nindividual in order to save the lives of several individuals\" (p.\n1256). Individual differences in metaemotion were measured by\nthe Toronto Alexithymia Scale (Taylor, Bagby, & Parker, 1997),\nNorman & Furnes Metaemotion 189\nthe Trait Meta-Mood Scale (Salovey et al., 1995), and the Mood\nAwareness Scale (Swinkles & Giuliano, 1995).Afactor analysis\nidentified that questionnaire items could be grouped into two\nfactors--clarity of emotion and attention to emotion. Utilitarian\ndecision making was negatively related to clarity of emotion,\nindicating that high clarity of emotion may imply longer lasting\nemotional reactions to negative stimuli (e.g., \"high-conflict\"\nmoral dilemmas), which may impair cognitive control.\nShaver et al. (2013) hypothesize that differences in metae-\nmotion may partly explain individual differences in the ten-\ndency to \"drink to cope.\" Metaemotion is seen as a form of\nemotion where the appraisal object is \"any of the several com-\nponents that comprise a given primary emotional reaction\"\nresponse to an emotion's physiological changes, expressive\nactions, behavioural urges, or subjective feelings. They stud-\nied two forms of metaemotion, (a) anxiety sensitivity, that is,\nbeing anxious about physiological and expressive components\nof anxiety, measured by the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (Taylor\net al., 2007), and (b) nonacceptance, that is, difficulty in\naccepting one's negative emotions, measured by the Non-\nAcceptance subscale of the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation\nScale (Gratz & Roemer, 2004). Drinking to cope was predicted\nby trait negative affect and trait anxiety, but not by the two\nforms of metaemotion. However, they were both associated\nwith trait anxiety, and nonacceptance was associated with\nincreased negative affect.\nThese examples illustrate that metaemotion is considered a\npredictor of various indices of well-being and mental health.\nThey also show that different subdisciplines of psychology\nshare the same basic understanding of the phenomenon. The\ngeneral view that metaemotion is an emotion that has other\nemotional phenomena as an appraisal object is explicitly stated\nHowever they also illustrate inconsistencies in the way metae-\nmotion is specifically operationalized across studies: For\ninstance, one question is whether metaemotion should be seen\nas an emotion in its proper sense--that is, a multifaceted phe-\nnomenon with cognitive, phenomenological, motivational,\nphysiological, and behavioural correlates, or as a self-regulation\nmechanism. Furthermore, if metaemotions differ from emotions\nin terms of their appraisal object, is the appraisal object an emo-\ntion per se (as Bartsch et al. [2010] seem to indicate), or could\nany individual component of an emotion constitute such an\nappraisal object (as Shaver et al. [2013] suggests)? It is also\nunclear whether and to what extent various suggested subcom-\nponents of metaemotion overlap, for example, attention to emo-\nand contempt/shame (Mitmansgruber et al., 2009) versus non-\nMetacognition and Its Facets\nEven though Gottman et al. (1996) explicitly compared metae-\nmotion to metacognition, a systematic comparison of the two\nconcepts seems still to be lacking. Metacognition broadly refers\nto \"cognition about one's own cognition,\" and is assumed to be\ninvolved in monitoring and control of ongoing cognition\n(Nelson & Narens, 1990). Metacognition can be operationalized\nand measured in a number of different ways (see Tarricone,\n2011, for a comprehensive overview). The following discussion\nwill be based on a broad and widely acknowledged distinction\nbetween three facets of metacognition.\nThe distinction between metacognitive experience, metacog-\nnitive knowledge, and metacognitive strategies originates from\nFlavell (1979). He defined metacognitive experiences as \"any\nconscious cognitive or affective experiences that accompany and\nImportantly, they are experienced (and often reported) during a\ncognitive activity, for example, \"feelings-of-knowing\" in mem-\nory situations. Metacognitive experiences can be subdivided into\ninformation-based metacognitive judgements and experience-\nbased metacognitive feelings (Koriat, 2007; Norman, Price, &\nDuff, 2010), depending on whether the experience occurs in rela-\ntion to explicit/conscious or implicit/unconscious cognitive\nactivity. Metacognitive knowledge is \"that segment of your ...\nstored world knowledge that has to do with people as cognitive\ncreatures and with their diverse cognitive tasks, goals, actions,\nbeliefs about one's own cognitive processes and the factors that\ninfluence specific cognitive processes and their outcome, for\nexample, knowledge about the effect of rehearsal on memory.\nMetacognitive knowledge can be further subdivided according\nto whether the knowledge concerns oneself, others, task-specific\nknowledge, or one's possession of cognitive strategies (Dunlosky\nnoted that Flavell (1979) pointed to the potential overlap between\nmetacognitive knowledge and experience, in that \"Some experi-\nences have such knowledge as their content and some do not;\nsome knowledge may become conscious and comprise such\nMetacognitive strategies are strategies that the individual\nengages in with the aim of controlling cognitive processes--the\n\"deliberate use of strategies (i.e., procedural knowledge) in order\nused the term actions/strategies to refer to this form of metacog-\nnition. Even though he classified it as a separate metacognitive\nentity, he emphasized that it differed from knowledge/experience\nonly in content and function, not in form or quality, and therefore\ncould also be seen as a variety of metacognitive knowledge. It\nshould be noted that Flavell (1979) also included \"metacognitive\ngoals/tasks\" as a fourth form of metacognition. However, since\nthis is not commonly acknowledged as a separate metacognitive\nfacet (see, e.g., Efklides, 2008), and because it is less applicable\nto the area of metaemotion, we have not included this possible\nfacet in our discussion.\nThree Facets of Metaemotion?\nAs an attempt to clarify and attune a more precise definition of\nmetaemotion, we propose that the metaemotion phenomenon as\na general construct can be understood in terms of the interplay\nbetween three different classes of phenomena that correspond to\nthree facets of metacognition presented before. It should be\nnoted that although an in-depth understanding of metaemotion\nrequires that all three proposed facets are taken into account,\nindividual facets can in principle be targeted separately.\nMetaemotional Experiences\nMetaemotion is often described as a \"meta-level\" experience in\nongoing emotional experience, with its phenomenological\nqualities being as differentiated as those of primary emotional\nexperience. As pointed out by Shaver et al. (2013), the phenom-\nenology of metaemotions may include feelings of anger, sad-\nness, embarrassment, shame, anxiety, etc. The \"raw feel\", or\nsubjective component of metaemotions, not necessarily acces-\nsible to conscious introspection or control, may be seen as cor-\nresponding to metacognitive experiences and be labelled\nmetaemotional experiences. The concepts of metaemotion\nenjoyment (e.g., \"I like this feeling\") and metaemotion norma-\ntive appreciation (e.g., \"I find these feelings embarrassing\";\nBartsch et al., 2010) seem to reflect this aspect of metaemotion.\nThe Anxiety Sensitivity Index used by Shaver et al. (2013) also\nseems to address the subjective reaction associated with the\nexperience of anxiety, for example, whether one feels scared,\nembarrassed, or worried. Moreover, the Non-Acceptance sub-\nscale of the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (Shaver\net al., 2013) contains items that primarily seem to reflect metae-\nmotional experiences (e.g., \"I experience my emotions as over-\nwhelming and out of control\").\nEven though we describe metaemotional experiences as\nemotional by nature, they may sometimes be accompanied by\ncognitive experiences. For example, a father who gets angry\nwith his child may metaemotionally feel sad that he reacted in\nthis way. In addition, he may also reflect upon why he reacted\nwith anger in this particular situation. This situation cannot\npurely be understood as a case of \"emotion about emotion\"\nbut also as \"cognition about emotion,\" thus the distinction\nbetween metaemotional and cognitive experience is not\nalways clear-cut.1\nMetaemotional Knowledge\nGottman et al. (1996) distinguished between parents'\"metaemo-\ntion philosophy\" and their actual way of approaching their own\nand their children's emotions.An organized set of thoughts about\nemotions seems parallel to metacognitive knowledge, which\nrefers to people's declarative knowledge about cognitive pro-\ncesses. One suggestion would therefore be to categorize this\nform of metaemotion as metaemotional knowledge. Declarative\nmetacognitive knowledge can further be subdivided into differ-\nent knowledge areas, for example, between knowledge of self\nand others, and knowledge of task and context (Tarricone, 2011).\nThe latter could for instance refer to knowledge of human mem-\nory and the situational and behavioural factors that may influ-\nence a person's memory. A similar subdivision of declarative\nmetaemotional knowledge could be made between knowledge of\none's own and others' emotions, general knowledge about emo-\ntions, knowledge about specific emotions, and knowledge about\nsituational and behavioural factors that may influence a person's\nemotions.\nSome of the items in the self-report scales referred to earlier\nconcern the individual's degree of insight/knowledge into their\nown patterns of emotional reactions, their tendency to regard\nemotions as useful information source, and to label and make\nuse of this information. In other words, they all reflect various\nforms of metaemotional knowledge. Such items include those\nof Mitmansgruber et al.'s (2009) subscales that concern peo-\nple's tendency to react with anger to their emotions (e.g., \"I\nrepeatedly get angry about my emotional reactions\"), The Non-\nAcceptance subscale of the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation\nScale (e.g., \"When I'm upset, I acknowledge my emotions\")\nused by Shaver et al. (2013), and items that load on Koven's\n(2011) factors attention to emotion and clarity of emotion (e.g.,\nthe Toronto Alexithymia Scale item \"I find examinations of my\nfeelings useful in solving personal problems\"). When Mendon\u00e7a\n(2013) claims that metaemotions are influenced by the person's\nvalues and beliefs, this can also be understood as a case of\nmetaemotional knowledge. Furthermore, Mendon\u00e7a (2013)\nprovides a series of examples of situations where teachers and\nparents communicate knowledge about patterns of emotional\nexperiences to children. For example, they may teach and give\nchildren feedback about the duration and progression of emo-\ntions, and which emotions are appropriate or normal in a given\nsituation. Mendon\u00e7a's examples concerning the education of\nemotion all seem to reflect different subtypes of metaemotional\nknowledge.\nMetaemotional Strategies\nSeveral authors address the control/regulatory function of\nmetaemotions. According to Bartsch et al. (2008), metaemotion\nmay play a role in those forms of emotional self-regulation that\nattempt to change the emotion itself. In discussing metaemotion\nand reflexivity, Mendon\u00e7a (2013) also addresses the regulatory\naspect of metaemotions. This aspect of metaemotions can be\nseen as parallel to the concept of metacognitive strategies, and\ncould be labelled metaemotional strategies. The Meta-Emotion\nScale's (Mitmansgruber et al., 2009) subscales thought control\n(e.g., \"I repeatedly force myself to pull myself together\") and\nsuppression (e.g., \"I cannot come to grips with strong emo-\ntions\"), and the Trait Meta-Mood Scale Mood Repair subscale\nall concern the ability to regulate one's emotions. Similarly,\nsome Toronto Alexithymia Scale items, like \"I am able to\ndescribe my feelings easily\" also seem to reflect this form of\nmetaemotion. It could also be argued that some of the scales and\nitems reflecting the ability to make use of emotional informa-\ntion, categorized before under metaemotional knowledge, are\nconcerned with the person's metacognitive insight into a metae-\nmotional strategy. This illustrates that metaemotional knowl-\nedge and strategies are closely related, as is also the case for\nmetacognitive knowledge and strategies (Flavell, 1979).\nNorman & Furnes Metaemotion 191\nIn some cases, metaemotional self-regulation involves the\nregulation of ongoing emotions. For example, if a sudden strike\nof anxiety triggers negative metaemotional experiences (e.g.,\nbeing anxious of one's ongoing anxiety), one may attempt to\nalleviate the primary emotion by distracting oneself from the\nobject or situation that triggered it, or by mechanisms like reap-\npraisal or suppression. Here, metaemotional strategies involve\nthe application of strategies for the control of current emotion.\nHowever metaemotional self-regulation may sometimes occur\nat a more superordinate level. First, they may relate to the pre-\ndiction and control of future emotions (e.g., being anxious about\none's future anxiety). Second, they may involve identification\nof current emotions, monitoring of changes in one's emotional\nstate, planning of strategies to be applied later, regulating one's\nemotions in case they deviate from predicted emotions, and\nevaluating the outcome of emotional regulation attempts.2\nThe Relationship Between the Three Proposed\nFacets of Metaemotion\nAlthough we propose that the three facets of metaemotion can\nbe theoretically distinguished and operationalized indepen-\ndently of one another, it is also important to keep in mind that\nthey are, to some extent, mutually dependent. For instance,\nMitmansgruber et al. (2009) argue that the quality of metaemo-\ntion provides information about regulatory processes operating\non the target emotion--for example, being angry about one's\nanxiety may influence the experience of the primary anxiety and\nlead to attempts to alleviate it. This is different from experienc-\ning compassion about anxiety. Here metaemotional experiences\n(of, e.g., anxiety or compassion) seem to influence the applica-\ntion of metaemotional strategies (e.g., attempting to alleviate\nanxiety). In addition, both the phenomenal quality of the metae-\nmotion and which regulatory metaemotional strategies are initi-\nated, may be influenced by metacognitive knowledge of, for\nexample, whether it would be appropriate/normal to experience\nand express anxiety in the given situation. Mendon\u00e7a (2013)\nalso presents an interesting example where awareness of metae-\nmotion can reduce interpersonal conflict by helping people to\nshift perspective and take on a more collaborative attitude. This\ncould be seen as a case where introspection on metaemotional\nexperience may generalize or transform to metaemotional\nknowledge, which in turn influences the person's metaemo-\ntional strategies.\nThe relationship between these three facets can also be illus-\ntrated by an example from research on affective forecasting, that\nis, prediction of future emotional states (Wilson & Gilbert,\n2003). Affective forecasting per se could be regarded as the\napplication of metaemotional knowledge, that is, assumptions\nor knowledge about one's own and others' emotional reactions.\nHowever, it has also been shown that the impact bias in affec-\ntive forecasting is influenced by individual differences in a trait\nmindfulness facet concerned with the ability to observe one's\nemotion (Emanuel, Updegraff, Kalmbach, & Ciesla, 2010).\nThis could be seen as a metaemotional strategy that concerns\nthe ability to accurately identify metaemotional experiences.\nMetaemotion: Trait or State?\nIn the previous presentation of metaemotional experience,\nknowledge, and strategies we have not directly specified\nwhether we regard each of these as state or trait variables. For\nexample, the metaemotional experience of being angry at one's\nanxiety may be seen as a state variable in the sense that it refers\nto a short-lived psychological state that has a specific precur-\nsor. However, the tendency to react to one's anxiety with anger\nmay be influenced by more stable individual differences. Thus,\nmetaemotional experiences cannot straightforwardly be classi-\nfied as either a state or trait variable, and may best be seen as a\ncombination of both. The same applies to metaemotional strat-\negies and metaemotional knowledge, where \"trait\" refers to the\npotential availability of certain metaemotional strategies or\nknowledge, and \"state\" refers to whether or not a potentially\navailable strategy or potentially available metaemotional\nknowledge, respectively, is applied in a given situation. For\nexample, the metaemotional self-control strategy reflected on\nitems like \"I repeatedly force myself to pull myself together\"\nmay be seen as a trait variable because it refers to a relatively\nstable self-regulatory mechanism. However, although in pos-\nsession of such strategies, one can imagine cases where people\nare not able to activate/use them due to the context surrounding\na given situation, see the work of Baumeister and colleagues on\nself-control depletion (Baumeister, Vohs, & Tice, 2007;\nMetaemotion Versus Emotional Intelligence\nThis view of metaemotion as involving both state and trait prop-\nerties makes it different from the related concept of emotional\nintelligence, which has been measured using some of the same\nself-report scales, and which has also been divided into subcom-\nponents that have some resemblance with the suggested facets\nof metaemotion. For instance, the Trait Meta-Mood Scale\n(Salovey et al., 1995) and the TorontoAlexithymia Scale (Taylor\net al., 1997), have been used to measure both metaemotion and\nemotional intelligence, and the emotional intelligence branch\n\"Managing emotions so as to attain specific goals\" (Mayer,\nSalovey, & Caruso, 2008) has some similarity to the concept of\nmetaemotional strategies as defined in the previous lines. Thus,\nin spite of the apparent overlap the most important difference\nbetween the two concepts is that whereas emotional intelligence\nrefers to a person's relatively stable characteristics, whether\ndefined in terms of \"trait\" or \"ability\" (see Mayer et al., 2008),\neach component of metaemotion may be seen as involving an\ninterplay between trait and state (cf. previous discussion).\nImplications for the Study and Measurement\nof Metaemotion\nThe most obvious implication of our multifaceted view is that\nresearchers should explicitly specify which facet of metaemo-\ntion is being studied. This makes it possible to more directly\ncompare findings across different studies, and to build broader\nmodels for how to understand the phenomenon of metaemotion.\nIn addition, there are a number of methodological and theoreti-\ncal implications. We now address a few of these.\nIn the aforementioned studies, all three potential facets of\nmetaemotion, including metaemotional experiences, were\nmeasured by self-report questionnaires. This also typically\napplies to the three facets of metacognition. However, a differ-\nence between the two research areas concerns the measurement\nof the primary emotional/cognitive event. In metaemotion\nresearch, measures of the primary emotion are not always\nincluded (but see Bartsch et al., 2010). In contrast, metacogni-\ntive experiences are normally measured in direct conjunction\nwith the cognitive event to which they relate, and performance\non the cognitive task is also measured. Examples include \"feel-\nings-of-knowing\" (Koriat, 2007), \"judgements of learning\"\n(Koriat, 2007), and \"confidence ratings\" (Norman & Price, in\npress). Very few methods have been developed for studying\nmetaemotional experience in direct conjunction with the pri-\nmary emotional experience. Future research should aim to\ndevelop such methods. However it should be noted that the con-\ncept of metaemotional experiences may be broader than that of\nmetacognitive experiences since emotion involves physiologi-\ncal and behavioural response patterns in addition to subjective\nfeelings. The potential range of measures to assess metaemo-\ntional experiences may therefore include any technique used to\nassess emotion, including various psychophysiological tech-\nniques to measure the behavioural correlates of emotions, for\nexample, measurement of skin conductance responses, heart\nrate, blood pressure, cortisol level, electromyography, and res-\nto some properties of metaemotional experience that may have\nimplications for its measurement. First, it is an open question\nwhether emotions are always accompanied by metaemotion,\nthat is, it may not be meaningful to measure metaemotion in\nconjunction with all forms of emotional experiences because\nthe emotion does not always elicit a metaemotional response.\nFor example, the extent to which anger is accompanied by\nmetaemotion (e.g., anxiety) would depend on a variety of indi-\nvidual and situational factors. One may even hypothesize that\nasking people to report their metaemotional experiences may\neven trigger metaemotions in cases where these would other-\nwise be absent. Second, it is likely that metaemotions are some-\ntimes experienced separately from the primary emotion,\nwhereas in other cases the two are intertwined. An example pro-\nvided by Mendon\u00e7a (2013) is a person who experiences sadness\nabout feeling jealous, either immediately upon the experience of\njealousy, or \"after the strike of jealousy has phenomenologically\ndisappeared\" (p. 390). This has consequences for the extent to\nwhich metaemotion can be measured independently from the\nprimary emotion. Third, there may be variation in the degree of\nsimilarity between the primary emotion and the metaemotion,\nwhich may also influence the distinguishability of the two. For\ninstance, a case of \"sadness about sadness\" is more difficult to\nmeasure than a case of \"anxiety about sadness,\" especially if the\ntwo co-occur. The development of techniques to measure metae-\nmotional experiences separately from the primary emotion to\nwhich they relate should focus on cases in which the metaemo-\ntion is both phenomenologically different and temporarily\nremoved from the primary emotion in question.\nThroughout the article we have highlighted the close rela-\ntionship between metaemotional knowledge and metaemo-\ntional strategies. The relatedness of the two phenomena has to\ndo with the fact that the application of a strategy will always\nrequire and be influenced by relevant knowledge. However\nthere is also a methodological reason why it can sometimes be\nchallenging to differentiate between the two: Self-report meas-\nures of strategies will by definition reflect no more than the\nperson's knowledge of their strategies. To the extent that\nmetaemotional strategies involve implicit, procedural knowl-\nedge, this will not necessarily correspond to the person's ver-\nbalizable strategies. Mendon\u00e7a's (2013) claims that people\nmay be even less conscious of their metaemotions than their\nemotions, which adds to the importance of this argument.\nFuture research should aim to develop methods for measuring\nmetaemotional strategies more directly, for instance by apply-\ning methodological principles from research on implicit cogni-\ntion, where dissociation between behavioural performance\nmeasures and verbal report is taken to indicate, for instance,\nthat an attitude is implicit (Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz,\n1998) or that learning is acquired independently of conscious\nA related implication concerns the debated question of\nwhether or not definitions of metaemotion should include\nthoughts about emotions. As pointed out by Eisenberg (1996),\nmetaemotion may influence behaviour in ways other than those\ncaptured by the person's explicit beliefs, and the inclusion of a\ncognitive component of metaemotion may therefore seem con-\ntradictory. The broader, multifaceted view of metaemotion sug-\ngested here opens for the possibility that explicit metaemotional\nknowledge may sometimes dissociate from the more implicit,\nautomatic properties of metaemotion which are more likely to\nbe reflected in metaemotional experiences and strategies.\nConcluding Remarks\nIn this article we have proposed a framework for understanding\nthe phenomenon of metaemotion that builds on a frequently used\ndistinction in metacognition research, namely the distinction\nbetween metacognitive knowledge, metacognitive strategies,\nand metacognitive experiences. We suggest that metaemotion\ncan be subcategorized into metaemotional knowledge, metae-\nmotional strategies, and metaemotional experiences. This\nattempt to integrate knowledge from metacognition research into\nresearch on metaemotion is inspired by Gottman et al. (1996),\nwho pointed to the two fields as being analogous. It constitutes\nan attempt to move towards a more precise clarification of the\nconcept of metaemotion, which has been identified by Mendon\u00e7a\n(2013) as an area of priority for future research. In our view, the\nsubdivision into three categories of metaemotion can be a useful\ntool for understanding and interpreting existing research findings.\nImportantly, it can also be seen as a framework that can\nguide future research. More specifically, it may allow for the\nNorman & Furnes Metaemotion 193\nformulation of more targeted research questions, as well as the\ndevelopment of more precise measurement methods, for instance\nmethods that assess metaemotional experience in direct conjunc-\ntion with the primary emotional experience.\nNotes\n1 We thank an anonymous reviewer for pointing out the distinction\nbetween metaemotional experiences and cognitive experiences related\nto one's emotions.\n2 We thank an anonymous reviewer for suggesting the distinction\nbetween different levels at which metaemotional self-regulation could\noccur.\nReferences\nBartsch, A., Appel, M., & Storch, D.
