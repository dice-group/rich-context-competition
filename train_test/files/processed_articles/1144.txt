Television is a rich medium that can teach a\nvariety of social behaviors. Meta-analyses conclude that\nviewing violent television increases children's antisocial\nbehaviors and decreases their positive social behav-\niors.16-18 Such negative social behaviors can lead to so-\ncial isolation, while positive social behaviors can lead to\nsuccessful peer relationships.19-22 The content of televi-\nsion, therefore, may be at least as important to chil-\ndren's social integration as the time they spend with the\nThe context in which television is viewed may also in-\nfluencechildren'ssocialinteractions.Whiletelevisionview-\ning is often perceived as an isolating activity, it frequently\noccurs in the company of friends.24 Because socializing\nbuilds interpersonal skills,12 television viewing with friends\nmay provide a venue for these skills to develop.\nWhile television may isolate children, the reverse causal\ndirection is also plausible--lonely children may turn to\ntelevision for entertainment and companionship. Chil-\ndren who are marginalized by their peers use television\nto escape the stresses of their lives and meet their social\nneeds.25 Conversely, children who are socially integrated\nspend less time watching television.26-29 In this model, it\nis social isolation that motivates media use. Overall, it is\nmost likely that both effects occur--children who watch\nmore television become more socially isolated, which leads\nthem to spend more time watching television.\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate the extent\nto which television viewing is associated with children's\npeer integration. It tests the hypothesis that the more time\nchildren watch television, the less time they spend with\ntheir friends. Additionally, children's exposure to vio-\nlent and nonviolent programs will be distinguished to de-\ntermine the independent relationship of these 2 types of\ncontent with peer integration. Finally, this study inves-\ntigates whether coviewing television is linked to the\namount of time children spend with friends not watch-\ning television.\nMETHOD\nDATA\nData for this study were drawn from the Panel Study of In-\ncome Dynamics\u00adChild Development Supplement (PSID-\nan ongoing, nationally representative panel study of adults con-\nducted by the Survey Research Center at the Institute for So-\ncial Research, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

The primary caregiver, with help from the child when ap-\npropriate, accounted for every minute of activity performed by\ntheir child for 24-hour periods from midnight to 11:59 PM the\nnext night. Along with duration of activities, parents reported\nlocation, other people who were present, and any secondary\nconcurrent activity. When television was the primary activity\nreported, the title of the program or movie viewed was also re-\nquested.\nTwo coders used their own knowledge and information\ngained from Web sites to determine the presence of violence\nin each show reported by the participants. News, sports, and\nother nonfiction programs contained widely variable content\nand were not coded. Programs were considered violent if vio-\nlence was a central theme to the program.

Alternatively, chil-\ndren who regularly spend time with their friends may en-\ngage in a variety of activities with them. Viewing televi-\nsion together may be one activity in the repertoire of a rich\nchildhood friendship. Regardless of the direction of influ-\nence,thisfindingdoesnotsupportthehypothesisthatview-\ning television with friends interferes with relationships or\nreplaces other shared activities.\nLIMITATIONS\nThe large number of television programs reported by the\nparticipants of the PSID-CDS necessitated a limited vio-\nlence coding procedure. Differing depictions of vio-\nlence on television can influence the viewer in different\nways43; the binary, violent vs nonviolent coding used in\nthis study does not capture important yet subtle differ-\nences in content. Further research using more precise and\nobjective coding strategies is necessary to understand more\nfully the relationship between violent television view-\ning and social isolation.\nAlthough time-use diaries are a valid and accurate\nmethod of measuring television viewing, they may be lim-\nited by recall bias because they are filled out for the pre-\nvious day. Additionally, because diaries were collected\nfor 2 sample days, activities that occur rarely are likely\nto be underrepresented. While 80% of children watch tele-\nvision every day,11 viewing with friends is a much less\ncommon activity and may be underreported in these data.\nThere was not enough coviewing reported to permit analy-\nses examining differences in viewing violent vs nonvio-\nlent television programs with friends. Finally, the cross-\nsectional nature of these data does not permit analyses\nof the direction of influence between television viewing\nand peer integration. Longitudinal research is necessary\nto further examine the direction and strength of this re-\nlationship.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe more time that children between the ages of 6 and\n12 years spent watching violent television, the less time\nthey spent with their friends. This content-specific rela-\ntionship indicates that television may not simply dis-\nplace peer interactions. At the time our study data were\ncollected, the National Television Violence Study found\nthis type of content was readily available to children--\n61% of all television programs and 66% of children's pro-\nThese results demonstrate that it is important to con-\nsider television content whenever investigating the re-\nlationships between media use and behaviors. Other re-\nsearch has reached similar conclusions with different\nbehavioral outcomes. Educational television viewing\namong children in preschool has been shown to have long-\nterm positive effects on children's academic success,46\nwhile early viewing of violence predicts aggression and\nviolent crime in adulthood.47\nThese findings expand and enrich our understand-\ning of the effects of television exposure on the healthy\nsocial development of children. Violent television\nviewing may influence younger children to be more\nantisocial, resulting in their becoming socially isolated\nwhich, in turn, attracts them to more violent media.\nTo optimize children's social development and long-\nterm mental health, parents, teachers, and pediatri-\ncians should discourage the viewing of violent televi-\nsion programs.\nIn response to these and other findings indicating\nthe potential effects of violent media, pediatricians\nshould incorporate media use histories in children's\nhealth maintenance visits to determine how much time\nchildren view television or play video games, what con-\ntent they are exposed to, and with whom they view or\nplay. Special attention should be given to a child's\nmedia exposure when there are indications of social iso-\nlation, declining school performance, or aggressive,\nanxious, or withdrawn behavior. Parents should be\nurged to remove televisions, video games, and Internet\naccess from children's bedrooms and to budget media\nuse for school-aged children to time after all home-\nwork, sports, and social obligations have been com-\npleted. Parents should be encouraged to make them-\nselves aware of their children's media use, watching\ntelevision or using other media with them, and discuss-\ning problematic content. Finally, pediatricians should\nencourage the development of media literacy, the ability\nto use media critically and to protect oneself, for both\nchildren and parents. Aware of the potential risks to\ntheir children's mental health and social development,\nparents should model and enforce healthy and safe\nmedia use habits in their homes.\nCorrespondence: David S.
