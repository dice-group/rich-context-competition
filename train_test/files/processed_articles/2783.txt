Intra-abdominal adipose tissue (IAAT) con-\ntributes to cardiovascular and metabolic risk regardless of body weight\n(1). Midlife women are at higher risk for IAAT accumulation (2,3).\nCross-sectional studies report that white women have more IAAT\nthan black women for a given total body adiposity (4-8). Although\nit has been shown that both white and black women gain IAAT dur-\ning midlife (3), there is no clear understanding about the racial dif-\nferences in the longitudinal change of IAAT.\nClinical trials of weight loss have reported conflicting results on\ndifferences in short-term IAAT change between white and black\nwomen. Some reports suggest a greater average IAAT loss in\nwhite women when compared with black women, whereas others\ndemonstrate no difference in the percentage of the IAAT loss\namong the two races (8-11). There is a need to clarify the racial\nspecifics of the naturalistic long-term IAAT changes among mid-\nlife women.\nThe principal focus of this investigation was to compare the natural-\nistic long-term IAAT changes among black and white women during\nmidlife.\nMethods\nThe Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN), a\ncommunity-based seven-center observational study, enrolled pre-\nmenopausal women aged 42-52 years as previously reported (12).\nThe ancillary Fat Patterning Study conducted at the Chicago site\ncoincided with the annual SWAN follow-up visits 4 through 11\nwere recruited, because many SWAN participants had already\n1 Department of Preventive Medicine, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, USA.

These women were originally\nscreened for the SWAN study but were too young to participate at\nthat time. The details of the Fat Patterning Study have been\ndescribed elsewhere (5). Enrollees of the Fat Patterning Study were\nsimilar in all baseline characteristics to those who did not enroll. Of\nthe 435 women enrolled, 41 were excluded from our analysis due to\nsurgical hysterectomy (due to distortions of intra-abdominal anat-\nomy) or diagnosis of diabetes (due to diabetes and therapy-related\neffects on IAAT). Furthermore, 57 women were excluded as they\ndid not have longitudinal IAAT data. Thus, the final cohort con-\nsisted of 337 women, 78% of all Fat Patterning Study participants.\nIAAT assessments were conducted annually by planimetric com-\nputed tomography obtaining a single 10-mm-thick abdominal image\nat the level of L4\nvertebral interspace, as reported previously\n(5,13). Scans were read using software developed by the reading\ncenter at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center (RSI,\nBoulder, CO). This protocol is in line with other longitudinal studies\nthat use planimetric (cm2) rather than volumetric methodology to\nestimate IAAT volume or weight (cm3 or kg). Planimetric IAAT\nassessment at the level of L4\nvertebral interspace correlates well\nwith total IAAT volume and has been used most frequently in other\nlarge studies (14,15). Total body fat was assessed on the same day\nwith whole body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (GE-Lunar,\nMadison, WI) and expressed as a percent of fat in soft tissue. Scans\nwere analyzed with GE-Lunar enCORE software (GE-Lunar).\nA standardized SWAN protocol was used to assess age, race, men-\nstrual bleeding patterns, hormone therapy use, depressive symptoms,\nand physical activity, as previously described (16). For the purpose\nof the current analysis, the women who had no menstrual bleeding\nin the 12 months prior to assessment were classified as postmeno-\npausal. Hormone therapy was determined as use of estrogen or pro-\ngesterone alone or in combination. Physical activity was estimated\nat the initial assessment as a sum score of modified Kaiser\nPhysical Activity Survey (17), and depressive symptoms were\nassessed with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale\nDistributions of the variables were checked, and violations of nor-\nmality were detected in the outcome of interest, IAAT, which was\nlog-transformed. Time was calculated in years based on assessment\ncompletion dates. A series of linear mixed-effects models were con-\nducted with log-transformed IAAT as the outcome and race as the\nprincipal predictor, adjusting for time, age at initial assessment, total\nbody fat (time-varying), and IAAT at the initial assessment (Model\n1); with additional adjustment for time and race interaction (Model\n2); and adding menopausal status, hormone use, physical activity,\nand depressive symptoms (Model 3). The annualized percent change\nin IAAT was calculated multiplying the time estimate by 100 (19).\nModel fit was evaluated with appropriate diagnostics. All analyses\nwere conducted using PC-SASV\nR 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).\nResults\nThe race-stratified cohort characteristics at the initial assessment are\nshown in Table 1. There were no racial differences in age or meno-\npausal stage. Black women were less likely to use hormonal therapy\nand had lower physical activity and higher depressive symptom\nscores.\nThe average follow-up time between the first and the last IAAT\nassessments was 2.1 6 0.4 years, with a median of three IAAT\nassessments per participant. The annualized total body fat change\nshown in Table 2, there were no differences in annualized IAAT\ngain estimate between black and white women. The estimated mean\nannualized percent of IAAT gain was 3.9%, after adjustment for\nage, race, initial IAAT, and time-varying total body fat (Model 1).\nLikewise, the mean annualized IAAT gain was 4.4% in the models\nthat additionally adjusted for annual IAAT and race interaction\n(Model 2), and also menopausal status, menopausal hormone ther-\napy, depressive symptoms, and physical activity (Model 3). Like-\nwise, no significant racial differences in the IAAT change were\nfound when the models did not include the adjustment for total\nbody fat (results not shown).\nDiscussion\nThe principal finding was that community-dwelling black and white\nmidlife women had similar rates of naturalistic IAAT gain over up\nto 4 years of adiposity assessments. The comparisons were con-\nducted with adjustment for total adiposity, as cross-sectional studies\nsuggested racial differences in IAAT after adjustments for total\nbody fat (4-7). Although short-term IAAT changes during weight\nloss have been studied previously (8-11), our report provides a\nunique racial comparison of long-term IAAT gain in a naturalistic\nsetting among midlife women.\nBlack women had significantly higher total body fat than white\nwomen, which may explain no significant racial differences in unad-\njusted IAAT area at the initial assessment. This finding is consistent\nwith previously published baseline IAAT comparisons from the\nTABLE 1 Cohort characteristics at initial evaluation stratified\nby race (unadjusted variable comparisons)\nVariable\nBlack White\nMenopausal hormone\ntherapy, n (%)\nInitial IAAT (cm2), geometric\nCES-D score, Center of Epidemiological Study-Depression Scale (scores 16 are\nindicative of depression); KPAS, Kaiser Physical Activity Scale.\naPremenopausal stage was defined as regular menstruations within the past 3\nmonths.\nBrief Cutting Edge Report Obesity\nSWAN Fat Patterning Study (4,5,13) and aligns with other published\nresearch, suggesting that white women have more IAAT than black\nwomen after adjustment for differences in total body fat (6-8).\nThe principal strength was a naturalistic longitudinal observation of\nadiposity changes in a community-based, representative sample of\nmidlife women from a well-characterized cohort, with validated\nmethodology applied for assessment of intra-abdominal and total\nbody fat across the representational adiposity spectrum. Our report\nis also distinct for demonstrating the similar rates of long-term\nIAAT gain among black and white midlife women, without signifi-\ncant change in total body fat over time (i.e., similar rates of adipose\ntissue redistribution during midlife in black and white women). Our\nfindings are in line with a similar study (20), which also found no\nracial differences and larger changes in IAAT than in total body fat.\nHowever, their cohort was younger, normal weight or with recent\nintentional weight loss to achieve normal weight (20).\nThe potential limitation of this study was planimetric rather than volu-\nmetric methodology used for IAAT assessments. To date, more stud-\nies have used planimetric (cm2) rather than volumetric methodology\n(cm3 or kg) to estimate IAAT. A planimetric IAAT assessment at the\nlevel of the L4\nvertebral interspace (as a proxy for a volumetric\nIAAT assessment) has been used commonly in epidemiological stud-\nies, where larger sample sizes compensate for the lower precision of\nplanimetric methodology (14,15). Volumetric measurement of IAAT\nchange has been necessary for smaller studies, limited by the need for\nhigher measurement precision (14,15). Our study used the \"annualized\npercent of IAAT change\" as a practical metric that permits compari-\nsons across studies or methodologies for IAAT estimation (14,15).\nThus, our findings can be applied to design intervention trials for the\nprevention of IAAT gain during the midlife transition.\nConclusion\nThe mean annualized percent of IAAT change was similar among\nblack and white midlife women after adjustment for total body fat,\nbaseline IAAT, age, menopausal status, hormone therapy, depressive\nsymptoms, and physical activity. Although weight loss interventions\nare important, a more rational way to reduce cardiometabolic risk dur-\ning midlife is to prevent menopause-associated IAAT gain in the first\nplace. As the IAAT gain was similar among black and white women,\nthe same preventive abdominal adiposity targets apply to both races.O\n"
