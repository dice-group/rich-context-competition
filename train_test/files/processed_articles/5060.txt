Furthermore, to my\nunderstanding, multilevel modeling has not been applied\nmuch in health care studies.\nTherefore, this study attempts to fill the gap in the previous\nliterature in 3 ways: First, this study analyzes Medicaid man-\naged care program in Florida. Second, this study analyzes how\nthe market competition and competitive influence of Medicaid\nmanaged care penetration differently affect LOS and inpa-\ntient costs between Medicaid managed care and Medicaid\nfee-for-service (FFS) patients. Third, using hierarchical linear\nmodeling (HLM), this study provides more precision in esti-\nmating the effects of Medicaid managed care plans and market\nstructure variables on LOS and inpatient costs.\nMethods\nThis study addresses the following research questions:\nResearch Question 1: Do Medicaid patients in managed\ncare have a shorter LOS and lower inpatient costs than do\npatients in Medicaid FFS?\nResearch Question 2: Do Medicaid managed care\npatients have much shorter LOS and lower inpatient costs\nas the competition of Medicaid managed care organiza-\ntions (MCOs) and Medicaid managed care penetration\nincreases?\nResearch Question 3: Does Medicaid managed care pen-\netration affect LOS and inpatient costs for Medicaid FFS\npatients?\nThe databases consisted of the following files: (1) the\nFlorida Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA)\nhospital inpatient discharge data file, (2) the Florida\nMedicaid managed care enrollment report, (3) the hospital\nMedicare cost report from the Center for Medicare and\nMedicaid Services (CMS), (4) the CMS inpatient prospec-\ntive payment system impact file, (5) the Florida Statistical\nAbstract, and (6) the Urban Influence Code from the US\nDepartment of Agriculture.\n1Florida State University, Tallahassee, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nJungwon Park, Postdoctoral Researcher, Askew School of Public\nAdministration and Policy, Florida State University, Tallahassee,\nEmail: park.fsu@gmail.com\nThe study population was comprised of all Medicaid\npatients aged 18 to 64 years who were discharged from short-\nterm general hospitals in Florida from January 1, 2006, to\nDecember 31, 2012. The total study population at the patient\nobserved in the population varied across analysis models\nbecause of different missing patterns and sample extraction\nstrategies. Then, the size of the sample was 684267 patients\nin the LOS model and 1\ncosts model. This study examined 902 short-term general\npitals were unbalanced. For example, this study included 148\nanalyses in 2012. This was because of missing data from\nMedicare Cost Reports, hospital closings, and mergers over\nthe study period.\nThe 2 dependent variables used were LOS and total inpa-\ntient costs. A hospital-specific cost-to-charge ratio was used\nto convert total inpatient charges to costs by multiplying the\nratio by each patient charge. Total inpatient costs were\nadjusted for inflation to 2010 dollars. This study included\nthe insurance type of the Medicaid patients as a main inde-\npendent variable. The insurance type of the Medicaid\npatients was a dichotomous variable (1 = Medicaid man-\naged care, 0 = Medicaid FFS). At the patient level, the study\ncontrolled patients' demographic characteristics, such as\ngender, race, and age. Also, the total number of secondary\ndiagnosis (TOD) and diagnosis-related group (DRG) weight\nwere controlled.\nAt the hospital level, this study included the level of hospi-\ntal competition. After the mid-1980s, empirical studies\nreported that increased hospital competition leads to lowered\nhospital costs and prices.9-12 Unlike previous studies that\nadopted a largely arbitrary definition of the hospital market\nbased on geopolitical units or fixed distance, this study identi-\nfied a service-specific market for each hospital.11 To calculate\nhospital competition, this study followed the two-step calcula-\ntion by Zwanziger and Melnick11 and provided the Herfindahl-\nHirschman Index (HHI) for individual hospitals. To measure\nHHI for each hospital, the first step was to calculate HHI for\neach ZIP code area in the state during each year period. Then\nthis study determined the weighted average of the HHIs of\neach ZIP code from which a hospital received patients. A\nhigher HHI value indicated a highly concentrated market.\nThis study also controlled hospitals' organizational char-\nacteristics, such as ownership, teaching status, total number\nof beds, and average bed occupancy rates. In addition, this\nstudy adjusted analytical models for a labor market's area\nwage index value, hospitals' Medicaid patient volumes, and\ncase-mix indices (CMIs). Different CMIs by payer indicated\ndifferent reimbursement levels among payers. For example,\na higher reimbursement rate (ie, high CMI) from private\ninsurers makes Medicaid patients less attractive to hospitals.\nTo capture the different reimbursement rates between com-\nmercial insurers and Medicaid, we calculated the difference\nin payer-specific CMIs between 2 payers by subtracting\nMedicaid CMI from private insurer CMI.\nAt the county level, the study used 2 measures of Medicaid\nmanaged care market structure: Medicaid managed care pen-\netration rates and the HHI of Medicaid MCOs. The HHI of\nMedicaid MCOs took into account the different market\nshares of each firm competing in the county. The HHI was\ncalculated by summing the square of each Medicaid MCO's\nmarket share. Other county-level control variables included\nrurality, total number of Medicaid recipients, and total num-\nber of Medicaid admissions.\nAll models involved hierarchical data structures, and\nstudy data were pooled cross-sectional data over time. To\nfind appropriate estimation approaches for each dependent\nvariable, dependent variables were examined as a first step.\nFirst, hospital LOS was measured in days, and it was posi-\ntively skewed, so linear modeling was not appropriate\nbecause the residual errors did not follow a normal distribu-\ntion. This study used Poisson regression to analyze LOS.\nSecond, as inpatient cost was a nonnegative dependent vari-\nable skewed by rare but extreme high-cost cases, the HLM\nmodel for inpatient costs in raw scale violated the assump-\ntion of normality. Thus, this study transformed the total inpa-\ntient costs by the logarithm function.\nThis study applied 2-level (ie, patient-hospital) hierarchi-\ncal models to estimate dependent variables. Due to low aver-\nage cluster size at level 3 (ie, county) and small variance\nbetween level 3 units, this study used 2-level hierarchical\nmodels. Therefore, the county-level variables were disaggre-\ngated to the hospital level. All statistical analyses were con-\nducted at a set a priori level of significance (.05).\nResults\nTable 1 provides the descriptive statistics for the variables\nused in the analyses over all cross-sections and periods. The\naverage LOS for Medicaid patients was 4.7 days. The aver-\nMedicaid patients in the sample had a mean age of 37.\nThere was unbalanced gender distribution in the sample. The\nlargest proportion of patients were in traditional Medicaid\nFFS, and black patients accounted for 30% of all Medicaid\ninpatient discharges. The average Medicaid patients had 4.6\nsecondary diagnoses. On average, Medicaid patients were\nhospitalized with a DRG weight of 1.08.\nAt level 2, there were 902 hospital-year observations\nfor hospitals. Of the 902 observations, the most common\nform of ownership was private for-profit hospitals, followed\nby private nonprofit hospitals and public hospitals. One\nfourth of the hospitals were teaching hospitals. Hospitals had\nan average of 262 beds and an average bed occupancy rate of\n59%. On average, Medicaid patients accounted for 7.4% of\ntotal hospital discharges. The average hospital's CMI was\nequal to 1.46. The mean difference in payer-specific CMI\nbetween commercial payers and Medicaid was 0.17, indicat-\ning that hospitals received more reimbursement from com-\nmercial insurers than from Medicaid. For characteristics of\nthe counties where the hospitals were located, Medicaid\nmanaged care penetration rates ranged from a low of 36% to\na high of 76%, with an average of 66%. The HHI of counties\nof hospitals were located in rural areas.\nTable 2 shows statistically significant fixed effects of\nlevel 1 predictors on the expected log of LOS. On average,\neach predictor was significantly related to the expected LOS\nacross hospitals. The results show that Medicaid managed\ncare was associated with shorter LOS. In Model 1, the inci-\ndence rate ratio (IRR) value for Medicaid MCO patients was\nabout 0.93, which means Medicaid MCO patients had nearly\n7% shorter LOS than did Medicaid FFS patients.\nThere was a strong association between hospital competi-\ntion and LOS. As HHI is a measure of concentration,\nMedicaid patients had longer LOS in hospitals with large\nmarket shares. However, the study found neither a signifi-\ncant effect of Medicaid managed care penetration nor a sig-\nnificant effect of the HHI of Medicaid MCO patients on\nhospital LOS.\nWith regard to other characteristics of hospitals, the study\nfound that government hospital status, number of hospital\nbeds, inpatient bed occupancy rates in hospital, wage index,\nand CMI difference were statistically significant at the .05\nlevel. In sum, level 2 predictors explained 40.7% of the\nparameter variation in intercept.\nModel 2 in Table 1 presents cross-level interactions\neffects in multilevel modeling. The effect of Medicaid man-\naged care on hospital LOS was moderated by market struc-\nture variables. Figure 1 shows that the LOS of Medicaid\nMCO patients was significantly associated with the level of\nMedicaid managed penetration, whereas the LOS of\nMedicaid FFS patients remained unaffected by managed\nTable 1.

Thus, high Medicaid managed care pene-\ntration was not associated with shorter LOS in hospitals for\nMedicaid FFS patients. Regarding the HHI of Medicaid\nMCOs, there was an interaction between payer groups and\nMCO_HHI. Under a competitive market, Medicaid MCO\npatients had much shorter LOS than did Medicaid FFS\npatients, but the difference became smaller under a concen-\ntrated market (see Figure 1b). Last, hospital competition did\nnot affect Medicaid MCO patients differently than it did for\nMedicaid FFS patients.\nTable 3 presents the models of hospital inpatient costs.\nThe study found statistically significant fixed effects of level\n1 variables, except for BLACK, on hospital inpatient costs.\nThe results show that Medicaid managed care is associated\nwith lower inpatient costs of care. In Model 3, the coefficient\nfor Medicaid managed care patients was -0.019. As the\ndependent variable was log transformed, being a Medicaid\nmanaged care patient changed inpatient costs by -1.88 while\nall other variables were held constant.13\nIn Table 3, the Medicaid managed care penetration rate was\nnot significantly associated with hospital inpatient costs for\nMedicaid patients. Also, the HHI of Medicaid MCO had an\ninsignificant effect on the costs of inpatient care. With regard\nto hospital concentration, there was a significant negative asso-\nciation between hospital concentration and hospital inpatient\ncosts. Thus, increasing competition in the hospital markets\nincreased the hospital inpatient costs for Medicaid patients.\nForotherhospital-level variablesinModel 3,theresearcher\nfound that all level 2 predictors except for MMC_PCT,\nMCO_HHI, and RURAL were significant. The results show\nthat both nonprofit and government hospitals were positively\ncorrelated with higher Medicaid inpatient costs, compared\nTable 2.

Also, the number of hospital beds,\nwage index, CMI, and percentages of Medicaid discharges\nwere positively associated with average inpatient costs.\nHowever, teaching hospital status, high levels of bed occu-\npancy, and a relatively commercial insurer-specific CMI\n(than Medicaid-specific CMI) were associated with decreased\nMedicaid inpatient costs. In sum, level 2 predictors explained\n26.2% of the parameter variation in the intercept.\nModel 4 shows that only 1 cross-level interaction (ie,\nMMC \u00d7 MMC_PCT) was statistically significant. In Figure\n2, Medicaid MCO and Medicaid FFS patients had slopes of\nopposing directions, and 2 slope lines intersected. Figure 2\nshows that Medicaid inpatient costs for FFS patients signifi-\ncantly decreased as Medicaid managed care penetration\nincreased. This result demonstrated the spillover effects of\nMedicaid managed care on other patients enrolled in\nMedicaid FFS.\nDiscussion\nThis study attempted to examine how Medicaid managed\ncare enrollment was related to hospital LOS and inpatient\nFigure 1. Predicted LOS by (a) Medicaid insurance status and MMC penetration rate and (b) Medicaid insurance status and HHI of\nMedicaid MCOs.\nNote.

There was a fairly large variation in LOS and inpa-\ntient costs across hospitals. The presence of these large vari-\nations between groups justified the use of HLM to improve\nprecision (ie, unbiased stand errors) by estimating shared\nvariance.\nThe type of Medicaid program in which patients were\nenrolled was significantly related to hospital LOS and inpa-\ntient costs. The study found that Medicaid managed care\npatients were more likely to have shorter LOS and lower\ninpatient costs compared with FFS Medicaid patients.\nSpecifically, Medicaid managed care patients had 7% shorter\nLOS and a 1.9% lower inpatient cost than did their FFS\ncounterparts. A Medicaid managed care program appears to\nhave had a negligible effect on hospitalization costs for each\nindividual patient, but we need to look at the aggregate\neffects of cost saving. In 2014, Florida spent a total of US$23\nbillion to cover its Medicaid program; thus, the aggregate\namount of cost reduction is not negligible. The result is con-\nsistent with findings from previous studies.14,15 De Jong\net al15 explained that health maintenance organizations'\n(HMOs) utilization management strategies and financial\nincentives for physicians significantly influences physicians'\nLOS decisions. In addition, there is less variation in LOS for\nmanaged care patients because physicians face similar con-\nstraints and incentives from HMO insurance.15 Following the\nmethodology of De Jong et al,15 this study examined some\nDRGs that were frequent among Medicaid patients in terms\nof mean and variation differences between Medicaid\nTable 3.

For most DRGs, Medicaid managed care\npatients had shorter LOS and more similar LOS than did FFS\nMedicaid patients. Medicaid managed care patients also had\nlower inpatient costs for two obstetrics DRGs (ie, cesarean\nsection with complication and without complication), and\ntheir variances in costs were smaller than those of Medicaid\nFFS patients. In sum, this study demonstrates that Medicaid\nmanaged care constrains physicians' behavior, which in turn\nreduces LOS and inpatient costs.\nExamining the Medicaid managed care and interaction\nterm market structure (ie, MCO_HHI and MMC_PCT) and\nMedicaid managed care, it can be seen that Medicaid man-\naged care patients had shorter LOS in high Medicaid MCO\ncompetition markets than in low Medicaid MCO competi-\ntion markets. When competing for Medicaid managed care\ncontracts, Medicaid MCOs have financial incentives and use\nmanagement strategies to lower costs by reducing utilization\nlevels of hospital inpatient care. MCOs reduce inpatient uti-\nlization by \"using fewer resources once a customer is admit-\nted.\"16 Furthermore, hospitals can lower costs and increase\nprofit margins by reducing LOS after the adoption of pro-\nspective payment systems.11 Medicaid managed care pene-\ntration also moderated the relationship between Medicaid\nmanaged care and LOS. Medicaid MCO patients admitted in\nhospitals with high Medicaid managed care penetration had\nshorter LOS than did patients in low penetration markets.\nThe results demonstrate that Medicaid MCOs had more\nmarket power on utilization of hospital service in an area\nwith high penetration. Greater market power can lead to an\nenhanced bargaining position of MCOs over hospitals,\nallowing them to extract steep price discounts from hospitals\nand physicians.17 As a result, health care providers change\ntheir practice patterns and decrease LOS for Medicaid man-\naged care patients\nThe findings from this study supported the existence of a\nspillover effect of Medicaid managed care on the hospital\ninpatient costs for Medicaid FFS patients. Greater Medicaid\nmanaged care penetration was associated with lower inpa-\ntient costs for Medicaid FFS patients, as shown in Figure 2.\nThe spillover effects of managed care penetration may be\ndue to changing physician behavior and practice patterns\nthrough increased activity of managed care.18 A previous\nstudy suggests that health care providers are more likely to\npay attention to cost-effective procedures in a highly man-\naged care penetration area.17 Physicians may decide to forgo\ncostly procedures and tests under the contracts with managed\ncare plans, and these changes in physician behavior and\npractice patterns may influence the care of patients in non-\nmanaged care plans. As a result, highly managed care pene-\ntration generates a cost-decreasing spillover to FFS patients.\nHowever, the results should be interpreted with caution, as\nthey may be attributable to the fact that more high-cost/high-\nrisk FFS patients move into managed care programs. This\nselection bias can be associated with changes in inpatient\ncosts of Medicaid FFS patients when Medicaid managed\nFigure 2. Predicted inpatient cost by Medicaid insurance status and MMC penetration rate.\nNote. MMC = Medicaid managed care; MCO = managed care organization; FFS = fee for service.\ncare penetration increases. Likewise, increasing costs for\npatients covered by managed care Medicaid can be attributed\nto selection effects.\nThis study has some limitations that have to be pointed\nout. First, we cannot generalize the results of study to other\nstates, which have different market conditions and man-\naged care policies. Second, the study used hospital inpa-\ntient discharge data as its primary source of patient data.\nThe use of administrative data for research has limitations\nbecause those data are restricted in scope and do not include\nbroader information on patients. Hospital inpatient dis-\ncharge data do not include patients' socioeconomic sta-\ntuses, detailed patient health information, or patterns of\nhealth service use that could influence dependent variables.\nFuture studies might consider including these control vari-\nables at the patient level.\nSupporting Information\nMean and Variation in LOS and Inpatient Costs for DRGs\n"
