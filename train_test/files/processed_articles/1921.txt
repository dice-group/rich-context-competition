We\nreexamine and build upon 2 recent studies exploring\nrecent widowhood and social participation. Using\ndifferent data, we perform a quasi-replication of Utz,\nCarr, Nesse, and Wortman's (2002; \"The effect of\nwidowhood on older adults' social participation: An\nevaluation of activity, disengagement, and continuity\nand employ different analytic strategies to Li's (2007;\n\"Recovering from spousal bereavement in later life:\nDoes volunteer participation play a role?\" Journal of\nGerontology Series B: Psychological Sciences and\nand Methods: A synthetic cohort of recently wid-\nowed individuals aged 60 years and older (n = 228)\nwas compared with random, non-widowed older\nadult controls (n = 228) across 3 waves of Americans'\nChanging Lives data.

This suggests that continuity\nof volunteer engagement and enhanced social par-\nticipation are important following widowhood. Given\ntheir positive associations with late-life well-being, ef-\nforts to help older widows and widowers increase\ntheir social participation and maintain established\npatterns of volunteerism following spousal loss are\nwarranted.\nKey Words: Social participation, Volunteerism,\nSocioemotional selectivity theory, Replication study\nwere widowed, with the majority being older than\nowhood places individuals at a greater risk for de-\nclining health (Williams, 2004), depression (Lund,\nCaserta, & Dimond, 1989; Siegel & Kuykendall,\n1990; Thompson, Gallagher-Thompson, Futterman,\nGilewski, & Peterson, 1991; Umberson, Wortman,\n& Kessler, 1992), alcohol abuse, and suicide\n(Harwood, 2005). Widowhood can also add to\neconomic strain through increased health care\ncosts (Prigerson, Maciejewski, & Rosenheck,\nther, widows may have a more difficult time deal-\ning with their loss, as they have fewer people with\nwhom to discuss their feelings of grief (Siegel &\nKuykendall). Older widowed persons are also par-\nticularly vulnerable to decreased social participa-\ntion as they may become more susceptible to\nisolating factors such as depression (Harwood)\nand the effects of disability (Prince, Harwood,\nBlizard, & Thomas, 1997) because the deceased\nspouse may have facilitated or jointly engaged in\nsocial activities.\nThe aim of this study was to build upon and\nextend recent studies examining changes in social\nparticipation following recent widowhood among\nolder adults in the United States. These effects are\nimportant because social participation, defined as\n\"social interaction with persons other than a\nspouse\" (Utz, Carr, Nesse, & Wortman, 2002,\np. 523), may play a part in decreasing feelings of\nisolation and promoting general well-being. We\nbegin with a review of the extant literature on for-\nmal and informal social participation, highlight-\ning their importance in the lives of widowed\nindividuals.\nInformal and Formal Social Participation\nWidowed individuals often lose a major re-\nsource for socializing when their spouse dies and\nfinding support in others becomes increasingly im-\nportant (Umberson et al., 1992). Informal social\nparticipation, including activities with family,\nfriends, and neighbors, provides the widowed indi-\nvidual with not only emotional support but also\ninstrumental assistance with practical needs such\nas meals, transportation, and house repair\n(Balaswamy, Richardson, & Price, 2004); however,\nit may not necessarily decrease the amount of time\nwidows spend grieving (Stroebe, Zech, Stroebe, &\nThe nature of informal social participation may\nchange after a widowhood event; widowhood may\ndiminish certain social relationships such as friend-\nships made through or primarily maintained by\nthe deceased spouse, whereas others may be en-\nThese enhanced relationships may include friend-\nships (Ferraro, Mutran, & Barresi, 1984) as well\nas relationships with children and siblings (Guiaux,\nvan Tilburg, & van Groenou, 2007). Although so-\ncial participation may change after widowhood, it\nremains uncertain if those changes positively affect\nadaptation to widowhood (Miller, Smerglia, &\nFormal social participation occurs through social\nand religious organizations and is often sought out\nby widowed persons (Ferraro et al., 1984). Gener-\nally, older adults involved in clubs and organizations\nreport having higher self-esteem, life satisfaction,\nand fewer symptoms of depression than those who\nare uninvolved in any organization (Pillemer, Moen,\nWethington, & Glasgow, 2000). Involvement in re-\nligious organizations may provide widows with new\nfriendships and a sense of community (Neill &\nKahn, 1999), and an increase in religious attendance\nfrequently occurs directly after the loss of a spouse\n(Brown, Nesse, House, & Utz, 2004). Balaswamy\nand colleagues (2004) found that widowers who\nhad more recently lost a spouse were more involved\nin social and religious activities at their place of wor-\nship than those who had been widowed for more\nAlthough social participation is important to\nthe well-being of older adults, we seek to examine\nhow the widowhood event affects involvement in\nthese activities. We are guided by Utz and colleagues\n(2002), who examined the impact that widowhood\nhad on both formal and informal social participa-\ntion by using data from the Changing Lives of\nOlder Couples (CLOC) study. In this study, a\ngroup of 297 recently widowed individuals' social\nparticipationrateswerecomparedwithconsistently\nmarried persons (n = 87) over a period of 48\nmonths. They found that whereas formal social\nparticipation did not change, informal social par-\nticipation rates increased after the loss of a spouse.\nA majority of those in the study stated that they\nincreased social participation to combat the nega-\ntive effects of widowhood. The authors speculate\nthat these effects may also be seen in other forms\nof participation, such as formal and informal\nvolunteerism.\nFormal Volunteerism\nFormal volunteerism entails working for or\nthrough an organization in an unpaid capacity. It\nallows older adults to contribute to their commu-\nnities and exhibits a positive association with mea-\nsures of well-being (Jirovec & Hyduk, 1998;\nMorrow-Howell, Hinterlong, Tang, & Rozario,\nbeen shown to decrease depressive symptomatol-\nogy in those older than 65 years (Musick & Wilson,\n2003) as well as mortality risk (Musick, Herzog, &\nHouse, 1999), and this effect is enhanced when\ncombined with religious involvement or social sup-\nport(Harris&Thoresen,2005;Oman,Thoresen,&\nolder adults benefited more from volunteering than\ntheir younger counterparts and that volunteering\nfor more than one organization resulted in in-\ncreased life satisfaction and perceived health.\nHowever, other research has also shown that the\ntype or number of organizations that elders volun-\nteer for does not further contribute to well-being\n(Morrow-Howell et al.).\n \nAnother potential advantage of formal volun-\nteerism is that it may enable widowed persons to\nincrease their social network by meeting other vol-\nunteers as well as gain the positive benefits of help-\ning. Elders who volunteer with an organization\ntend to be women, who are more likely to partici-\npate in volunteer activities at a higher level. Elders\nwho volunteer are also more likely to have a high-\ner income and be married (Kim & Hong, 1998).\nThe stress-buffering effects found through involve-\nment with voluntary organizations (Rietschlin,\n1998) may help decrease the stress associated with\nwidowhood.\nLi (2007) examined the relationship between\nwidowhood and formal volunteerism using the\nAmericans' Changing Lives (ACL) study. Using\ncross-sectional time series analysis, pooling respon-\ndents into two waves of data, Li found that wid-\nowed individuals had a higher likelihood of\npursuing formal volunteer roles than did non-\nwidowed individuals, within 1\u00ad4 years following\nthe death of a spouse. Li hypothesized that this was\ndue to widowed persons adopting volunteer roles\nas a compensatory measure after the loss of a\nspouse. Furthermore, Li found that volunteerism\nwas protective against depressive symptoms and in-\ncreased hours of volunteering was protective against\ndepressive symptoms and increased self-efficacy.\nInformal Volunteerism\nInformal volunteerism involves helping family,\nfriends, and neighbors, and continues to be a part\nof a person's life into old age (Choi, Burr,\nMutchler, & Caro, 2007). It can entail providing\ninstrumental support in the form of transporta-\ntion, child care, and housework without pay (Brown,\nBrown, House, & Smith, 2008). It is one of the\nmost common forms of activity among older adults\n(Hinterlong, 2008) and may contribute to general\nlevels of late-life functional and subjective health\n(Hinterlong, Morrow-Howell, & Rozario, 2007).\nInformal volunteerism after spousal loss has been\nshown to mitigating depressive symptoms in be-\nreaved individuals (Brown et al.).\nTheoretical Underpinnings\nOur examination of widowhood and social par-\nticipation draws upon both socioemotional selec-\ntivity (Carstensen, Isaacowitz, & Charles, 1999)\nand continuity theories (Atchley, 1989). First, the\ntheory of socioemotional selectivity posits that\n\"perception of time is inevitably linked to the selec-\ntion and pursuit of social goals\" (Carstensen et al.,\ngoals shift from the acquisition of knowledge to\nmeeting emotionally based goals. Knowledge-based\ngoals involve the pursuit of information, whereas\nemotionally based goals derive emotional satisfac-\ntion and meaning from social contacts, being aware\nof the present moment rather than focused on fu-\nture events (Carstensen et al., 1999). Furthermore,\nas emotional goals become primary, individuals\nturn more frequently to known social partners, as\nthose who are familiar to them may more reliably\nbe able to provide predictable and positive contact\n(Carstensen, Fung, & Charles, 2003; Carstensen\net al., 1999). Although the overall size of a social\ncircle decreases over time (Carstensen, 1992), the\nimportance and satisfaction derived from those\ncontacts remains constant (Lansford, Sherman, &\nAntonucci, 1998). The theory of socioemotional\nselectivity theory would posit that after the loss of\na spouse, the widowed individual might focus more\non emotionally based goals, and there will be an\nincrease in social participation to meet emotional\ngoals and compensate for the loss of the spouse.\nBeyond general social participation, evidence exists\nthat although the number of volunteer activities\nundertaken by older adults may decrease, levels of\nvolunteering may increase or remain constant for\nindividuals who are already engaged in volunteer\nactivities (Hendricks & Cutler, 2004). This sup-\nports the idea that significant social contacts, in\nthis case volunteer contacts, are retained over\ntime.\nFurther theoretical underpinning for this study\nis found in continuity theory (Atchley, 1989),\nwhich posits that as individuals age, they will at-\ntempt to maintain the roles and activity patterns\nthat they established earlier in their lives. Thus,\nfollowing widowhood, individuals may try and\nmaintain types and levels of social participation\nconsistent with those prior to the loss of a spouse\n(Dean, Matt, & Wood, 1992; Zettel & Rook,\n2004). Even when an obligation such as care giv-\ning takes the time of older adults, they are likely to\ncontinue in their volunteer work (Choi et al.,\nThe Current Study\nThe current study combines and builds upon\nfeatures of both Utz and colleagues' (2002) and\nLi's (2007) studies to address outstanding issues\nidentified by those authors and our review of the\nliterature. We begin with a quasi-replication of the\nwork of Utz and colleagues using the ACL data. In\ntheir call for future research, Utz and colleagues\nnoted the need to understand the impact of wid-\nowhood on specific forms of social participation.\nLi offers some insight by narrowing the focus in his\nexamination of widowhood and formal volunteer-\nism. We have extended this analytic approach to\nreexamine Li's assessment of formal volunteerism\nfollowing widowhood and consider how informal\nvolunteerism is impacted by spousal loss. We di-\nverge from both Utz and Li by examining how ro-\nbust various forms of social participation are\nfollowing a widowhood event. The final question\nwe examine is whether any of the various forms of\nsocial participation are impacted by widowhood,\ncontrolling for previous levels of participation.\nIn attempting to replicate the work of Utz and\ncolleagues with the ACL data, our study design dif-\nfers in several ways. First, we identify random non-\nwidowed controls to approximate their use of\nmatched case controls. Second, the ACL does not\ncontain all the independent variables used in their\nstudy (i.e., drive automobile, spouse health charac-\nteristics). We also address methodological limita-\ntions identified by Li (2007). Specifically, Li uses all\nwidows in the ACL while controlling statistically\nfor time since the spouse's death; similar to Utz and\ncolleagues however, we include only those individ-\nuals widowed within the past 3 years, which mini-\nmizes recall bias and places the spousal loss more\ntemporally proximal to the outcomes under investi-\ngation. Additionally, Li did not control for pre-loss\nrespondent characteristics but rather used the post-\nloss data as proxy indicators. Our use of randomly\nselected never-widowed controls eliminates this\nconcern by controlling for pre-loss characteristics.\nMethods\nSample\nThe data used for this study are drawn from the\nfirst three waves of the ACL study (House, 1994).\nInitial face-to-face interviews were conducted in\nadults aged 25 years or older. Subsequent data\nsamples Blacks and adults aged 60 years and older.\nWe limited our sampling frame to adults aged 60\nyears and older at any wave (n = 1210) and identi-\nfied 228 individuals who experienced a widow-\nhood event within the 3 years prior to any interview.\nThese were pooled to form a synthetic cohort. We\nthen randomly drew 228 never-widowed individu-\nals from the sampling frame to serve as controls.\nMissing data are a common issue under all study\ndesigns but are especially prevalent in complex\nlongitudinal studies like the ACL. We used multi-\nple random imputation (MRI) to represent the\nmissing data resulting from reasons other than re-\nspondent death. MRI, a preferred method for ad-\ndressing missing data, enables us to use\ncomplete-data analytic methods. We weight our\nfindings to generalize back to the U.S. population\nof noninstitutionalized older adults.\nAnalysis\nTo take advantage of the longitudinal nature of\nthe ACL, we use generalized estimating equations\n(GEEs) to estimate our models. GEE allows seri-\nally correlated data produced by panel studies to\nbe examined within a general linear model frame-\nwork that accommodates the inclusion of both\ncategorical and continuous independent and de-\npendent variables. By accounting for autocorre-\nlated error, GEE produces more accurate standard\nerrors and less biased parameter estimates than or-\ndinary least squares regression. We begin by iden-\ntifying differences among recent widows and\nnever-widowed controls across our analysis vari-\nables. We then use GEE to test for hypothesized\ndifferences between these groups on each measure\nof social participation.\nWe present three nested models for each depen-\ndent measure. The first two models parallel the\nanalyses of Utz and colleagues. Our final models\nexamine levels of social participation, controlling\nfor previous levels of participation and all other\ncontrol variables. This allows us to examine how\nrobust patterns of social participation are follow-\ning a recent widowhood event.\nMeasures\nDependent Measures.--Four dependent vari-\nables were used in this analysis, formal and infor-\nmal social participation, and formal and informal\nvolunteering. Formal social participation is a stan-\ndardized index of two variables: (a) how often do\nyou attend meetings or programs of groups, clubs,\nor organizations that you belong to and (b) how\noften do you usually attend religious services. Utz\nand colleagues included hours of volunteering in\ntheir measure of formal social participation.\nWe do not; because volunteerism is being assessed\n \nseparately in our analyses, it was not included as\npart of the formal social participation index. In-\nformal social participation is a standardized index\nof two variables: (a) in a typical week, about how\nmany times do you talk on the telephone with\nfriends, neighbors, or relatives and (b) how often\ndo you get together with friends, neighbors, or\nrelatives and do things like go out together or vis-\nit in each other's homes. Formal volunteering re-\nflects unpaid activity done for an organization\nduring the past year. Informal volunteer status re-\nfers to the provision of instrumental assistance to\nfriends and neighbors without pay such as help\nwith household chores or transportation. Both\nforms of volunteering are dichotomized (1 = yes,\nWidowhood.--Widows are identified as indi-\nviduals who experienced a widowhood event with-\nin the 3 years preceding the ACL interview.\nNon-widows are individuals who report never\nexperiencing a widowhood event.\nControl Variables.--We include the same con-\ntrol variables as Utz and colleagues. These vari-\nables include age, years of education, total\nhousehold income, sex (1 = male, 2 = female), ho-\nmeownership (1 = own home, 0 = does not own\nhome), and race (1 = White, 2 = non-White). We\nalso controlled for functional health status, self-\nrated health, depression, extraversion, employ-\nment status, and no children. Functional health\nstatus is an index of 12 variables assessing the ease\nin which the individual attends independently to\nactivities of daily living. Self-rated health is as-\nsessed by asking, \"How would you rate your health\nat the present time?\" Response options vary from\nexcellent (1) to poor (5). Depression is assessed us-\ning nine items from the Center for Epidemiological\nStudies-Depression scale (Radloff, 1977). In the\nACL, extraversion is an index of four variables: (a)\nare you a talkative person, (b) do you usually take\nthe initiative in making new friends, (c) do you\ntend to keep in the background on social occa-\nsions, and (d) are you mostly quiet when with oth-\ner people. Employment status is a dummy code\n(1 = employed, 0 = unemployed) as is no children\nWe were unable to include two variables used by\nUtz and colleagues due to limitations in the data set,\nincluding whether the individual provided care for\nhis/her spouse and if he/she drove an automobile.\nResults\nWidowhood and Social Participation\nAs shown in Table 1, we identified several sig-\nnificant demographic differences between widows\nand non-widows in our sample. Widows had high-\ner levels of informal social participation at Waves\n1 and 3. Widowed individuals also had higher lev-\nels of formal social participation at Wave 3. Wid-\nowed individuals were more frequently women,\nsignificantly so at Waves 2 and 3, and significantly\nolder than non-widows at Waves 1 and 3. Non-\nwidows had significantly higher levels of education\nat Wave 2, had higher household income in Waves\n1 and 2, and were more likely to own their own\nhome in Wave 2. Further differences were identi-\nfied in Wave 2, when non-widows were more like-\nly to have higher levels of functional health.\nWidows reported higher levels of depression at\nWaves 1 and 2 as well as lower levels of employ-\nment at Wave 2. Of note, some of the mean scores\nare negative because both positive and negative\nvalues were associated with the construct (i.e.,\nextraversion, depression).\nOur first aim was to replicate the findings of Utz\nand colleagues using the ACL data, as seen in Mod-\nels 1 and 2 on Table 2. Model 3 tests the robust-\nness of the relationship between recent widowhood\nand current social participation, controlling for\nprevious levels of participation. We were able to\nsuccessfully replicate some of Utz and colleagues'\nfindings, however several of our results differed.\nAs in Utz and colleagues' study, we found that\nwidowhood had a significant positive relationship\nwith informal social participation in the controlled\nboth analyses indicate women reported greater in-\nformal social participation (b = .275, p < .01). Our\nanalyses identified significant relationships not ob-\nserved in Utz and colleagues', including those be-\ntween informal social participation and age (b =\n.05). Our analyses did not show the significant\nrelationship Utz and colleagues found between\ndepression and informal social participation.\nAs seen in Model 3, we then estimated a model\nusing the identified variables as covariates, widow-\nhood status as a fixed effect, and prior social partici-\npation as a control. These full models explained over\nhalf of the variance in social participation due to the\ninclusion of lagged participation. Consequently,\nmany of the statistically significant relationships seen\nin earlier models disappear. Specifically, the relation-\nship between gender, age, education, and homeown-\nership and informal social participation disappears.\nVariablesthatremainsignificantlyrelatedtoinformal\nsocial participation include widowhood (b = .671,\n(b = .511, p < .05).

As noted in Table 3, our analyses did not find\nthat widowhood was significantly related to either\nformal or informal volunteerism. Variables that\nwere related to formal volunteerism included edu-\nand extraversion (b = .47, p < .01). Variables dem-\nonstrating a statistically significant relationship to\ninformal volunteerism included age (b = -.08, p <\np < .05). We did not control for prior formal and\ninformal volunteerism because the initial analyses\nfailed to show a significant effect for widowhood.\nDiscussion\nOur findings on social participation are consis-\ntent with socioemotional selectivity and continuity\nTable 3. Unstandardized coefficients from regression of predictors of volunteer status on recent widowhood\nVariable\nFormal volunteer status Informal volunteer status\nEstimate SE Estimate SE Estimate SE Estimate SE\naAfrican American is reference group.\ntheories, insofar as levels of social participation\nwere maintained or increased after the widowhood\nevent. In the case of this study, levels of social par-\nticipation remained the same or increased after a\nwidowhood event, which may be attributed to the\nindividual attempting to compensate for the loss of\nthe spousal relationship. We did not observe the\nsame relationship between widowed individuals\nand formal and informal volunteerism. This lack\nof findings may be due to the way in which volun-\nteerism was measured in the data set or simply be-\ncause of a nonsignificant relationship between\nvolunteerism and widowhood in this population.\nBeyond the theoretical implications of our find-\nings, three goals were articulated for these analy-\nses. The first goal was to attempt to reproduce to\ntheextentpossiblethefindingsofUtzandcolleagues\n(2002) in regards to social participation after\nwidowhood. Second, we build on Li's (2007) anal-\nyses by examining what differences might exist in\nformal and informal volunteerism after widowhood,\nand finally, we extend on both previous efforts by\nexamining the robustness of the observed relation-\nships by controlling for previous levels of social\nparticipation and volunteerism.\nWe did reproduce some of the findings of\nUtz and colleagues in regards to widowhood and\n \nsocial participation in older adults. Specifically, we\nfind a positive relationship between recent widow-\nhood and informal social participation. These data\ndemonstrate that in two separate samples, wid-\nowed individuals reported a higher level of infor-\nmal social participation than did non-widows, and\nwidowed women were more likely to report higher\nlevels of informal social participation than were\nwidowed men. Our analyses identified additional\nsignificant relationships between informal social\nparticipation and age, education, homeownership,\nextraversion, and no children. In addition to infor-\nmal social participation, analyses of formal social\nparticipation and the identified variables revealed\na number of differences from the Utz and col-\nleagues' findings. Specifically, our analyses revealed\na significant relationship between widowhood sta-\ntus and higher levels of formal social participation.\nFurthermore, homeowners as well as those with\nhigher levels of extraversion report greater formal\nsocial participation. This stands in contrast to the\nfindings of Utz and colleagues, in which they found\nthat formal social participation had a significant\nrelationship to gender, education, and race. The\nonly findings from Utz and colleagues that were\nreproduced in terms of formal participation in-\ncluded negative relationships between levels of for-\nmal social participation and depression.\nAs the stated goal was to attempt a quasi-\nreplication of the Utz and colleagues' findings, the\nrelationships that were reproduced in these analy-\nses included the significant relationship between\nwidowhood and greater informal social participa-\ntion, as well as between gender and informal social\nparticipation. In terms of formal social participa-\ntion, the only replicated findings that reflected a\ndecreased level of participation were in those with\nincreased levels of depression.\nThe second stated goal was to build on Li's\n(2007) findings involving the relationship between\nformal volunteerism and widowhood. Although Li\nfound that there was an increased likelihood of\nwidows taking on a volunteer role after the wid-\nowhood event, these findings were not replicated\nin these analyses. As Li notes, the effect of widow-\nhood status on volunteer role in that sample was\nrelatively modest possibly due to the low number\nof individuals widowed between the two data col-\nlection periods. It is a possibility that the different\nmethodological choices made in this study (the use\nof those only widowed in the past 3 years and the\nuse of randomly selected never-widowed controls)\nmight explain the discrepancy in findings. These\nfindings present an interesting conundrum, as pre-\nvious research has shown that older married indi-\nviduals are more likely to volunteer than unmarried\nindividuals (Kim & Hong, 1998). Therefore, it\nwould follow that widowed individuals would\nshow a lower rate of volunteerism than would\ntheir married counterparts. The answer may be\nfound in socioemotional theory, which posits\ngreater emphasis on meeting emotional goals later\nin life. If an emphasis is placed on meeting emo-\ntional goals by maintaining important social con-\ntacts, then perhaps despite the widowhood event,\nthe widowed individual will retain the volunteer\nrelationship. This would lead to similar rates of\nvolunteerism between widowed individuals with a\nhistory of volunteerism and married individuals.\nMore research is needed to explicate the differenc-\nes in volunteerism between married individuals\nand different types of non-married individuals (i.e.,\nnever-married or widowed).\nThe final goal of this study was to test the ro-\nbustness of the relationships between widowhood\nand formal and informal social participation as\nwell as formal and informal volunteerism. These\nfindings are perhaps the most compelling in the\nstudy as they demonstrate that widowhood has a\nsignificant relationship with both formal and infor-\nmal social participation, even when prior levels of\nsocial participation are controlled for. This indi-\ncates an increase in both formal and informal social\nparticipation regardless of the level of social par-\nticipation prior to the widowhood event. Indeed,\neven when demographic variables became nonsig-\nnificant, widowhood retained a significant relation-\nship to social participation. This indicates that\nwidowhood status, more than other demographic\ncharacteristics, may influence social participation\nin older widowed adults. Controlling for previous\nlevels of social participation also significantly in-\ncreased the explanatory power of the model; more\nthan 50% of the overall variance was explained for\nboth formal and informal social participation.\nLimitations\nSeveral limitations exist in this study that must be\nnoted. First, we were only able to attempt a quasi-\nreplication of the Utz and colleagues' study. The\ndifferences in the CLOC and ACL data sets made a\ntrue replication unfeasible. A second limitation lies\nin the observational nature of the study. Although\nwe were able to control for a host of factors, we\nwere unable to include consideration of what the\nexperience of the widowed individual both prior to\nand during the spousal loss might have been. These\nfactors may act as unmeasured confounders that\nwe were unable to control for in this study. Fur-\nther, despite the availability of baseline formal and\ninformal social participation data, the nature of\nthe study makes positing any sort of causal con-\nnection impossible.\nPractical Implications\nThese findings advance our understanding of\nthe experience of widowhood and can aid those\nseeking to enhance the well-being of widowed old-\ner adults, as well as guide policymakers in develop-\ning programs that are rooted in scholarly\nevidence.\nPractice Implications.--For professionals, this\nstudy adds to the growing evidence that sustained\nand increasing social participation by widowed in-\ndividuals is protective against negative health out-\ncomes. Identifying practical strategies for leveraging\nthis understanding is important. When dealing\nwith older adults who have recently experienced a\nwidowhood event, it is important for health and\nmental health professionals to explore the older\nperson's previous and recent history of social par-\nticipation and volunteerism. In particular, helping\nolder adults to overcome barriers to participation\narising from the loss of a spouse may be a central\naim of these efforts. For example, social workers\ncould assist the individual to identify and pursue\nfuture opportunities to be involved in formal and\ninformal social activities. These intervention efforts\nmay take place in a variety of settings, including\nhospice care, grief counseling and support groups,\nhospitals and other health care settings, or psycho-\neducational programs to facilitate the transition\nfrom spouse to widowed individual (e.g., Caserta,\nFurthermore, this research adds to the body of\nevidence of the importance of interaction with\nfamily and friends to those who have experienced\na widowhood event. To protect against the nega-\ntive effects of widowhood, including an increased\nrisk for declining health, disability, alcohol abuse,\nand suicide, family must continue their participa-\ntion with the widowed individual. This may be dif-\nficultgiventheincreasingmobilityandgeographical\nseparation evident in families. For these reasons,\nnonfamilial social relationships may become an in-\ncreasingly important source of support for indi-\nviduals after spousal loss (Ha & Carr, 2005). This\nis suggested in our finding that older widows gen-\nerally increase their involvement within nonfamil-\nial relationships. Future research should consider\nhow to facilitate and optimize informal social par-\nticipation using new technologies and within ever\nmore complex built and social environments.\nResearch Implications.--Future research also\nshould pursue several additional issues that we were\nunable to address in this study. Investigators should\nexamine how the pre-loss experience of widows\nand widowers affects later social participation. In-\ndividuals who are heavily involved in the care of a\nspouse may have a fundamentally different experi-\nence of social participation after the widowhood\nevent than those who lost spouses suddenly or were\nnot as involved in the care giving process. The sub-\ntleties of the pre-loss and widowhood experience\nmay influence later social participation in ways that\nwere not captured in this study.\nAdditional research may focus on a more con-\ncentrated and detailed examination of the relation-\nship between widowhood and volunteerism.\nAlthough no significant relationships were ob-\nserved in this study, further investigation may lead\nto a greater understanding of the relationship be-\ntween marital status, changes in that status, and\nvolunteerism. Given the robust relationship ob-\nserved between widowhood and social participa-\ntion found in this study, it is certainly possible that\ninvestigation with a larger population of widowed\nindividuals or a conceptualization of volunteerism\nthat is nondichotomous will reveal relationships\nthat were not observed here. Indeed, socioemo-\ntional selectivity theory indicates that in older indi-\nviduals, although number of or time spent in\nvolunteer activities may diminish as an individual\nages, their level of commitment to valued volun-\nteer roles likely remains consistent or increases.\nPolicy Implications.--As the baby boomers age, a\ngreater number of widowed individuals will be pres-\nent within the population. Given the findings in this\nstudy, future policy should focus on supporting\ncommunity-based programs that promote social in-\nvolvement, such as senior centers, various Older\nAmericans Act services, and engagement in commu-\nnity life through more formal volunteer activities.\nRecent national legislation has moved in this direc-\ntion. The 2006 amendments and reauthorization to\n \nthe Older Americans Act call for a greater attention\nto civic engagement and provide a statutory frame-\nwork upon which to pursue these aims. Addition-\nally, the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act\n(2009), will significantly expand funding to create\nand manage formal volunteer opportunities for in-\ndividuals older than 55 years. Although not directly\nintended to address the needs of older widows, these\npolicy advances could be leveraged to create inno-\nvative approaches to assist this population by re-\nducing barriers and expanding access to organized\nactivities that benefit both the older individual and\nthe broader community.\nThe valuation of social participation in older\nadults is not limited to legislative efforts. Significant\nemphasis has been placed on civic engagement\namong older adults by both research institutions and\nfunding sources. Given that emphasis, this research\nsuggests that greater scholarly attention might be\npaid to engagement among widowed individuals as\nthey may particularly benefit from an increase in en-\ngagement. Finally, agencies that serve older adults\nshould make an effort to make widowed individuals\naware of these opportunities for increased social\nparticipation. By focusing efforts on increasing en-\ngagement by widowed persons, agencies can target\ntheir endeavors on a potentially vulnerable subset of\npopulation, maximizing their overall efficacy.\nIn summary, as the population of widowed in-\ndividuals grows in this country, mitigating the po-\ntential deleterious consequences of spousal loss\nbecomes increasingly important. In this study, we\nhave shown that formal and informal social par-\nticipation emerge as increasing salient activities in\nthe initial period following widowhood and thus\nmay play a significant role in that mitigation.\n"
