Hence, it is vitally impor-\ntant to document the origins of innovation that undergirds\nresearch, as it often involves more than simply the applica-\ntion of existing methodology. This article tells a story about\ncrime and a problem-solving methodological approach. It\ntells of analytic hoops we jumped through in our research\nexamining why many types of crime have been falling in\nEngland and Wales (Figure 1) and elsewhere over the last\nquarter century.\nThe purpose of the story is to show how and why we\nfocused on `data signatures' to analyse the source of the puz-\nzling and pervasive crime drops that began in many countries\nfrom the early 1990s (and a little earlier for some property\ncrimes in the United States). Our focus on the data signatures\nfound in the crime drop has been useful in eliminating many\nof the reasons that have been advanced for the crime drop as\nwell as for corroborating one of them, at least for now (Farrell,\nThe story begins in 2006 when we wrote our first research\ngrant proposal on this topic, and at the time of writing in mid-\n2015, our third sequential project is underway.

These\ninclude cyber-crime, theft of smartphones and similar high-\nvalue portable electronics, and the growing prominence of\norganised crimes such as illicit trafficking of different types.\nThe realist deal\nKey to the research has been a problem-solving approach,\nwhich is consistent with a realist orientation to evaluation\n(Pawson and Tilley, 1997). Pawson and Tilley stressed the\ndevelopment of Context Mechanism Outcome Pattern\nConfigurations (CMOCs). CMOCs refer to the causal\nmechanisms that are activated or deactivated when a pro-\ngramme or policy is introduced in a range of contexts lead-\ning to changed regularities, producing an outcome pattern.\nThe more precisely the changes in regularities can be specified\nthrough the CMOC conjecture, the more confidence can be\nhad in the conjecture. The problem-solving counterpart to\nCMOCs is the development of interventions where prob-\nlems are identified (`Scanning'), casual mechanisms gener-\nating them analysed (`Analysis'), measures developed that\nwith undermine relevant mechanisms generating the prob-\nlems (`Response') and evaluations undertaken to determine\nwhether the problem has been eliminated or ameliorated\n(`Assessment'). These terms form the acronym SARA,\nwhich was devised by Eck and Spelman (1987), and has\nbeen widely used to capture this process. In our work, we\nbegan with a puzzling outcome \u00ad steep, widespread and\nunexpected drops in crime rates \u00ad rather than a programme\nto assess. However, the approach we have adopted accords\nwell with Pawson and Tilley's realist evaluation and with\nEck and Spelman's SARA process.\nIn particular, the identification of a series of data signa-\ntures has been critical to our work. Data signatures per se are\nnot new (cf. Bowers and Johnson, 2004; Garwood et al.,\ntion as a methodological tool for crime prevention research\nhas been spurred on by Eck and Madensen (2009). They find\nthat `The analysis of crime signature change, as part of crime\nprevention evaluations, can improve the internal validity of\nhighlight the distinctiveness of the mechanisms associated\nwith different situational crime prevention interventions and\nthe associated outcome patterns that would follow from the\nactivation of these mechanisms. Our triangulation work is\nconsistent with three important points on signatures made by\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Signature changes consistent with expected interven-\ntion mechanisms eliminate rival explanations;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Signature changes inconsistent with the expected\nintervention mechanism undermine the validity of the\nconclusion that the intervention produced the crime\nchange;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The more specific and prominent the change in signa-\ntures, the fewer viable candidate explanations there\ncan be.\nFarrell et al. 3\nThe more precisely an observed pattern accords with\nthe expected signature, the more confident we can be in\nattributing causality to it, as also stressed by Pawson and\nTilley.\nA proto-realist evaluation, to which Pawson and Tilley\nrefer as one of their exemplars, which also accords well with\nEck and Madensen's emphasis on crime signatures, is\nLaycock's study of property marking in South Wales villages\nas a means to prevent domestic burglary (Laycock, 1985,\n1991). Overall falls in domestic burglary in the villages fol-\nlowed introduction of the initiative. Laycock, however,\n`directed her outcome measurements towards precise theo-\nOne mechanism might involve retrieving stolen property and\nanother detecting offenders with stolen goods. Both were\nmeasured but neither found. Laycock conjectured that inten-\nsive and persuasive publicity leading to increased perceived\nrisk to local burglars (remembering that the contexts was iso-\nlated villages in a Welsh Valley), deterring them from offend-\ning, might comprise an important mechanism to generate\nfalls in burglary (the initiative had been highly publicised\nwhen first introduced to encourage uptake in the villages).\nCleverly, Laycock also tracked offending patterns after her\nfirst report was published and received positive publicity,\nand immediately subsequent renewed falls in burglary\nappeared to corroborate her conjecture. Her conclusion was\nthat rather than the property marking per se producing\nthe crime drop, it was the intensive and persuasive publicity\nthat risks to local offenders were being increased. The out-\ncome signature was consistent with one but not the other\nexplanation.\nThe specifics of the data signature approach as it relates to\nthe historical crime drop on which our research focused\nshould become apparent as the remainder of the article\nunfolds.\nInternational relations\nIn parallel with the analysis described below, we examined\nthe global crime drop. Back in 2007, it was not as well-\nknown that crime had declined in many countries, and we\nconfirmed the general finding of others (Van Dijk et al., 2007\nin particular) and added to the knowledge base. We used\nthe International Crime Victims Survey (ICVS) which is a\nunique resource as the only cross-national standardised\ngeneral victim survey (Mayhew and van Dijk, 2014). It has\ncountries, with small but representative national or city sam-\nples and an identical questionnaire. This means its findings\nare widely comparable, unlike police statistics which have\ndefinitional reporting and recording differences, and national\ncrime surveys, which have definitional and survey methodol-\nogy differences (Van Dijk and Tseloni, 2012).\nWe examined five volume crime types \u00ad domestic bur-\nglary, theft from the person, theft from car, car theft and\nassault \u00ad using multivariate multilevel regression modelling\nin an innovative manner: treating the different time periods\nof country-level data as repeated measures within each coun-\ntry to test for a linear or non-linear trend. Three of the insights\nthis provided will be highlighted here (see Tseloni et al.,\n2010 for the full story). First, cross-nationally, domestic bur-\nglary and car theft were the first offences to decline, and they\ndid so from the first ICVS sweep in 1988. Theft from the\nperson and theft from cars began their decline with the 1995\nsweep with assault declining from the 2000 sweep. Second,\nvolume crime drops were roughly similar across countries\nexcept for burglary which, to the extent that could be deter-\nmined with the more fragmented available data, fell faster\noutside Europe, North America and Australasia. Third, in\naddition to displaying common cross-national trends, the\ncrimes of burglary, theft from the person and car theft were\nhighly correlated cross-nationally, while assault appeared\nstrongly related to burglary and car theft.\nThe international analysis is an important counterpart to\nthe analysis that follows. The likelihood that crime declined\nrapidly by chance in many countries at a similar time is van-\nishingly small. For us, this implies the possibility of a com-\nmon cause which first impeded car thefts and burglaries then,\nperhaps via a spill-over effect, other crime types including\nviolence. In addition, it means that we suspect our England\nand Wales-oriented work, described below, has broader geo-\npolitical implications.\nOur argument is, thus, that the data signatures we exam-\nine, although relating largely to one country, suggest more\ngeneral patterns and hence a way of addressing a major puz-\nzle in criminology. Of course to corroborate this, what we\nhave done would need to be replicated by research in other\ncountries to determine whether similar distinctive signatures\nare found there also.\nThe other logistic regression\nWe used the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW,\nformerly the British Crime Survey) as our main data source.\nIt provides data for crimes occurring in 1981 onwards, was\ners much additional information including some on security\nmeasures, albeit with varying consistency over time.\nWe will skip past most survey method issues here, but\nexperienced readers will know that the task of analysing sep-\narate sequential data files such as those of the CSEW is an\nimmensely time-consuming task which necessitates great\nattention to detail. Each annual survey sweep requires sepa-\nrate analysis with new code to be written. It requires signifi-\ncant skills such as repeated reorganisation of the files \u00ad or\nwhat is known to us as the other logistic regression. So we\nare surprised and thankful to have made it thus far, and have\ntwo exhausted research assistants \u00ad who ruthlessly aban-\ndoned the team once they got their PhDs \u00ad to show for it.\n4 Methodological Innovations\nIt's a sign of the crimes!\nWe started by analysing car theft, in part because we believed\nits decline to be under-researched (see Farrell et al., 2008).\nThe first three signatures we identified provide information\non the causal role of security. If opportunity is driving car\ntheft, then we would expect to see some specific changes\nwhere security measures are introduced to reduce it.\n1. The average age of stolen vehicles should increase\nbecause newer vehicles have better security.\n2. Door lock-forcing should decline much more than\nother means of entering vehicles, due to central dead-\nlocking systems.\n3. Temporary theft for joyriding and transportation\nshould decline sooner and faster than permanent\nthefts for chopping and re-sale \u00ad because younger\nless experienced offenders were more easily deterred.\nWe find that all these expectations are met. The change in\nmeans of entry to vehicles is shown as Figure 2 by means of\nexample.\nWe were able to replicate the results with Australian data\nand added a fourth signature to the repertoire when we hap-\npened upon a natural experiment:\n4. In Australia, electronic vehicle immobilisers were\nintroduced in one state (WesternAustralia) in advance\nof elsewhere. Car theft fell sooner in that state and\nthen fell in the rest of the country, both times tracking\nthe spread of security (Farrell et al., 2011b).\nNote that the statistical signatures only make sense when\ninformed by the theoretical mechanisms by which different\ntypes of security device ought to work: we have information\non central locking, electronic immobilisers (but also mechan-\nical immobilisers \u00ad often the awkward old steering wheel\nclamps known as clubs or crook-locks), car alarms and track-\ning devices \u00ad and this aspect of the work is described next.\nCompeting explanations for the drop in car theft would, of\ncourse, have also to be consistent with these specific patterns.\nAuto crime and autocorrelation\nAfter releasing an early version of part of the work in a news-\nletter (Farrell et al., 2008), we were astonished at the speed\nwith which teams in other countries replicated and extended\nit (though some may have evolved in parallel). By now, with\nsome variation in method and data, the finding that security\ncaused the fall in car theft appears true for Australia, England\nand Wales, the Netherlands and the United States (Fujita and\ning evidence on the effectiveness of electronic immobilisers\nfrom Germany and elsewhere (Bassman, 2011; Brown,\n2013). Not only does the replication bode well, but since\nautomobile security was improved (often by legislation) at\ndifferent times in different countries, together the studies\nprovide the fifth signature:\nFarrell et al. 5\n5. The timing and trajectory of the spread of security in\ndifferent countries appears to track the introduction\nand spread of electronic vehicle immobilisers.\nAlthough it was not part of the research by the present\nauthors, some confirmation of the likely importance of secu-\nrity was identified by interviews with offenders in Australia\n(Brown, 2015). Offenders were asked why they thought\nproperty crime had declined and the most popular response\nwas that it was due to security.\nBut which security devices work best? And which work\nbest for different types of car crime? Here, we included theft\nfrom cars as well as vandalism, initially comparing crime\nrates for cars without security to those with particular types.\nThis evolved into what we termed the Security Impact\nAssessment Tool (SIAT). The SIAT uses odds ratios of the\nlikelihood of crime when particular security devices, or com-\nbinations, are present, to tease out their relative crime pre-\nvention effects (Farrell et al., 2011a). The term we adopted\nfor the measure this generates is the Security Protection\nFactor, or SPF, which is the same acronym as Sun Protection\nFactor \u00ad and both measure the units of time, relative to the\nabsence of protection, after which the user is burnt.An exam-\nple of SIAT output is shown later for burglary. Conceptually\nthough, what it does is quantify the effectiveness of different\ncombinations of devices. The SPFs are our sixth statistical\nsignature and told us that:\n6. Specific security devices and their combinations vary\ngreatly in their security effectiveness, which varies\nby crime type, and these patterns fit with theoretical\nexpectation.\nWe found tracking devices to be very effective against\ncar theft but they were not around much in the 1990s when\ncrime plummeted. Of devices that were, we found elec-\ntronic immobilizers to be the most effective, mechanical\nimmobilisers and central locking systems to be also quite\neffective, alarms only modestly effective, and other\ndevices (window etching, parts marking) of little use.\nTheft from vehicles is more likely to be interrupted by\ncentral locking than electronic immobilisers, which makes\nsense since a car with only the latter remains easy to break\ninto but is harder to steal. Car alarms only ever had a mod-\nest effect, but it was larger against theft from cars, which\nalso makes sense (i.e. conforms with theoretical expecta-\ntion of how the preventive mechanism works) as the less\nexperienced offenders committing these crimes are more\neasily deterred.\nAn important finding is that devices work much better\nwhen used in combination. That is, combinations of good\ndevices produced non-linear benefits. Electronic immobilis-\ners and central locking were dominant but cars with those\nplus an alarm and a tracker were found to have a car theft\nSPF of 25 against theft \u00ad that is, to be 25 times safer than a\nvehicle without security. The importance of combinations of\ndevices was confirmed in subsequent analysis of household\nsecurity devices and burglary which is detailed next.\nAlarming implications\nThe focus shifted to domestic burglary for the second main\nstrand of the research. Building on the car theft work, we\napplied the SIAT to household security devices. This was\nmore challenging because of the larger number of burglary\ndevices recorded in the CSEW. There were nine devices in\ntotal which in principle produce hundreds of combinations.\nWe identified the most prevalent devices and combinations\nand focused our analysis on them. We found that burglary\nsecurity devices, individually but especially in certain com-\nbinations, are much more effective than car security. As\nexpected, some work better than others and combinations are\nparticularly effective, sometimes exponentially so. You can\nrest easy if you have the combination of: Window locks,\nInternal lighting on a timer, Door deadlocks and External\nsensor-lighting, which in our shorthand became the WIDE\ncombination (we had long been using one-letter abbrevia-\ntions to summarise the myriad permutations), as shown in\nFigure 3 (`External & Internal lights, Window & Door\nlocks').1 We found WIDE to provide 49 times the protection\nof `no security' against burglary. So to prevent burglary, not\njust the more the merrier, but the WIDEr the better (Tseloni\nAn unanticipated finding from our research \u00ad but one that\nin some ways gives it that real-world feel \u00ad is the finding that\nburglar alarms appear to be largely ineffective (Tilley et al.,\n2015).Although there has been previous research into house-\nhold security devices, most of it tends to group security\ndevices together, so it is possible this has been missed. While\nit has long been known that most alarm activations are false\nnot mobilise much formal or informal surveillance, it was a\nlargely unanticipated finding that warrants further research.\nSneaky measures\nTwo things were particularly troublesome in the early stages\nof the research into household burglary \u00ad so much so that\nthey potentially falsified the security hypothesis. The first\nwas that, even before burglary plummeted in 1993, a fair pro-\nportion of households already had some security of different\ntypes. The second was that while there was a significant\nincrease in security levels when burglary fell, it was too\nmodest to account for the fall. So how, we pondered, could\nsecurity be responsible if there was already a fair bit of it and\nif it failed to increase hugely?\nThe answers appear to be quality and combinations. We\nstrongly suspect the quality of security devices dramatically\nimproved from the early 1990s \u00ad but that this is masked in\nthe simple counts of the prevalence of individual devices.\n6 Methodological Innovations\nFinding a signature to test this conjecture was challenging.\nTo try to do so, we developed a sneaky measure that drew on\nhow we had examined car theft, and looked at how offenders\ngained entry (with inspiration for sneaky measures from\nGarwood et al., 2000). We grouped entry methods into two\nbroad types:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Forced entries \u00ad where security was overcome, includ-\ning lock-forcing on doors or windows, the removal or\nbreaking of door panels or windows;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Unforced entries \u00ad where no security was overcome\nincluding unlocked doors, entry with a key, pushing\npast the occupant or use of deception.\nIf it was security that improved, then the signature we\nwould expect is that burglaries where security was involved\nwould fall sooner and faster than the others. This is what\noccurred, shown in Figure 4. The issue is most evident\nwhen means of entry via doors or windows are examined\nseparately. It is clear that a reduction in forced entries\naccounted for the bulk of the decline in household burglary\nwhereas other types of entry declined less and declined\nlater (Figures 5 and 6). While this does not directly show a\nchange in the quality of devices, it does show that it was\nforced rather than unforced entries that declined, for which\nthe best explanation we can come up with is more and bet-\nter security.\nWhile the data were imperfect, we were also able to gain\nsome insight into the use of combinations of devices.\nUnfortunately, the best data were only available from 1998\nonwards but we extrapolated the trends backwards. Rather\nuncannily, the extrapolated trends identify a dramatic\nincrease in the use of combinations of the WIDEr more\neffective devices in the early 1990s at the time when bur-\nglary began to fall. The same data imperfections meant the\nproportion of households without any security devices\nappeared to have fallen dramatically in the early 1990s due\nto different definition of `no security' prior to the 1998\nCSEW. These signatures dovetail well with the analysis of\nbetween-device variation in effectiveness and previous\nanalysis of the role of combinations of devices against car\ntheft.\nSo, there is mounting evidence that security may have\ninduced the fall in household burglary. But how and why\nwould security have spread and improved? We anticipate\nthat the improvement in security occurred via the spread of\nhome improvements, particularly insulation and double-\nglazing (sometimes termed storm windows). Double-glazed\nwindows have two tougher panes of glass, and have stronger\nframes such that breaking them is more difficult. Further,\ndouble-glazed windows and doors tend to have built-in rather\nthan add-on locks which means they are more likely to be\nused (the awkward nut on the bolt is not left lying around or\nlost). Figure 7 shows the spread of fully double-glazed\nhouseholds in the United Kingdom and the drop in burglary\nin the 1990s, and while the data are incomplete across the\ntimespan of the decline in burglary, they are at least some-\nwhat indicative.\nFarrell et al. 7\nThis burglary analysis is detailed in a study that is under\nreview for publication at the time of writing but versions of\nthe findings were presented at the conference to mark the end\nof our funded research on burglary and an international\nIndependent support appears to derive from the recent work\nof Brown (2015) in Australia. Offenders were asked why\nthey thought crime had declined and the most popular\nresponse was that they believed it was due to security.\nLooming violence\nWhat about violence? This is probably the biggest question\nremaining and the topic of our more recently awarded\nresearch grant. We suspect that security played a key role\nboth directly and indirectly. For some crimes such as rob-\nbery, the effect is likely to have been direct. Banks and com-\nmercial stores, buses and taxis have all introduced an array of\nimproved security measures to reduce robberies. A recent US\n8 Methodological Innovations\nstudy demonstrated that taxi-driver homicides fell in the\n1990s in those cabs with security cameras installed, relative\nto a control group without (Chaumont Menendez et al.,\n2014). Older readers will remember the days when bus driv-\ners carried a large bag of fare monies \u00ad the days before cor-\nrect-payment by machine and a secure drop-box for cash.\nLate-night shops now tend to have limited cash on the prem-\nises and an array of design improvements. We anticipate that\nthese and other measures reduced violence in and around\nmany public and private premises and spaces. Robbery\ndisproportionately results in homicide, and other homicides\nare assaults-gone-wrong, so their decline may have reduced\nhomicide as a natural statistical consequence.\nAlongside the adoption of security technology to protect\ntheir cars and homes, individuals may have become more\ncrime risk-averse, adopting or modifying their routine\nFarrell et al. 9\nactivities to reduce their exposure to stranger and acquaintance\nviolence, especially in night-time economy (Ganpat et al.,\nreduced levels of exposure to risks of stranger violence in pub-\nlic places and hence lower levels of actual violence among\npreviously highly victimised groups showing enhanced pre-\ncautionary behaviour. However if `street' crime is more dif-\nficult due to security it is possible that this also nudges\nadolescents to stay indoors.\nWe are also exploring the indirect effects, that is, how\nfalling property crime may have reduced violence. It may\nsurprise some generalist readers to learn that most `career\ncriminals' are not specialists. That is, they tend to commit\ndifferent types of crime across the spectrum of property and\nviolence \u00ad including sexual victimisation and domestic vio-\nproperty crime, they commit mainly that plus a small amount\nof violence. Perhaps much of that violence is committed\nwhile undertaking, following-through on, or in the wake of\ncompleted property crimes, which could mean the reduction\nin property crime has triggered some of the broader reduc-\ntions in violence. So, for example, acquisitive property crime\nis a precursor of fencing, and car theft may be a precursor to\ncrime requiring a getaway vehicle such as suburban burglary.\nWe term this the keystone hypothesis because the removal of\nthe volume property crimes may, like the removal of the key-\nstone in an arch, have caused all the other crime types to\ntumble.\nThe second main indirect route we are examining is the\ndebut crime hypothesis. This involves examining the extent\nto which early-career offenders who are stifled if their debut\ncrimes \u00ad mainly shoplifting, car theft and other property\ncrimes \u00ad do not progress to commit the broader array of\ncrimes including violence. The signatures for this might\ninclude falling levels of acquisitive criminal activity among\nyounger offenders followed by falls in violence as they reach\nlater adolescence, while levels of violent behaviour are\nmaintained in other cohorts whose onset of criminality has\nnot been inhibited by increases in security relating to typical\ndebut crimes. Promising evidence on changing criminal\ncareer patterns speaks to this hypothesis (Farrell et al., 2015b).\nHence, we suggest that while there is a great need for further\nresearch into security and the violent crime drop, there are\nsome promising avenues to pursue.\nConclusion: of signatures and\nsignificance\nTriangulation from a variety of data signatures and sources\nis, statistically speaking, an oddity. If one indicator has, say,\na 5% chance of error, then two independent indicators,\nfor example, based on different data sources, imply a\n\u00d7\n=\nchance, and so on. With the broad range of data signatures\nidentified to different data, plus some near-replications from\nother countries in relation to the car theft and burglary work,\nand since these findings fit with theoretical expectation at\ndifferent levels plus there is reason to anticipate some broader\napplication of these findings, then what, statistically\nspeaking, is the chance of error? Well do not look at us\nbecause we do not know. But we now feel fairly safe sug-\ngesting that there is good evidence to support the security\nhypothesis while recognising that a long and winding\nresearch road lies ahead.\nAnd we hope for responsible criticism and attempts at fal-\nsification, and challenge researchers to identify suitable data\nsources that facilitate such efforts. But we would also ask\nreaders to identify plausible alternate hypotheses that could\naccount for the various data signatures described herein, for\nwe cannot. For example, when considering a rival hypothe-\nsis, first consider why it might reduce forced but not unforced\nentry to households. Then run it past some of the other signa-\ntures because a plausible rival hypothesis should be consist-\nent with each one.\nCrime drop research falls increasingly into the domain of\nmodern history. It will require archival research and imagi-\nnative efforts to pursue. Trawling through the records of\nsecurity manufacturers, insurers, construction companies,\nthe market research industry, business groups and others,\ncould shed light on where, when and what security develop-\nments occurred and were implemented. In-depth interviews\nwith experts including ageing offenders or ex-offenders (see\nBrown, 2015) and experts involved in security at and around\nthe time, are required. The clock is ticking on the last aspect\nbecause the likelihood of retirement of domain-specific\nexperts increases daily. Other sources of information should\nemerge as the work progresses, consistent with the nature of\nthe investigative triangulation approach.\nThe most important policy conclusion suggested by the\nresearch is that society should put time and effort into encour-\naging elegant security solutions. The process can, we feel, be\naccelerated. Government should assist the corporate sector in\nreducing its crime emissions \u00ad products and practices that\ngenerate volume crimes: it took decades to get secure cars,\nand we should have had secure phones long ago, while there\nis scope for Internet service providers to secure key compo-\nnents of the Internet much more immediately.And society has\na significant comparative advantage over even the most adap-\ntive of offenders. This story of our use and abuse of statistical\ndata signatures and theories of causal mechanisms has been a\nkey component of how we reached this conclusion. Rather\nthan arrest for the wicked, we advocate elegant design and\nsecure solutions that remove crime opportunities.\nWhat we have described here is a research programme\nthat embodies iterative progression and the development of\nmultiple data signatures to test context-mechanisms outcome\npattern conjectures relating to security improvements and the\ncrime drop. This investigative triangulation approach sits\nwithin the realist evaluation framework: confidence in a\n10 Methodological Innovations\nconjecture can be multiplied where successive signatures\ncorroborate one another and where alternative explanations\ncan be compared for their consistency with signatures. The\nidea of multiple `signatures' specifically comes from situa-\ntional crime prevention and was initially formulated for eval-\nuating small-scale interventions to address specific crime\nproblems. We suspect that the method has more general\napplication and its use in this article is intended to illustrate\nthis and to encourage others working in different fields.\nThere are many sources of data collected using many differ-\nent methods. To mix metaphors, just as we need to select\ningredients from a well-stocked larder to cook a bespoke\ndish, so too we need to look to data source larders to select\nthe ingredients to empirically test our hypotheses. In refer-\nring to a dish, we hope the culinary allusion is not too\nabstract, for we regularly taste each doughy signature as it ...\nproves.\n"
