    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nPMD (Pelizaeus\u00adMerzbacher disease) is a rare neurodegen-\nerative disorder that impairs motor and cognitive functions\nand is associated with a shortened lifespan. The cause of\nPMD is mutations of the PLP1 [proteolipid protein 1 gene\n(human)] gene. Transgenic mice with increased Plp1\n[proteolipid protein 1 gene (non-human)] copy number\nmodel most aspects of PMD patients with duplications.\nHypomyelination and demyelination are believed to cause\nthe neurological abnormalities in mammals with PLP1\nduplications. We show, for the first time, intense microglial\nreactivity throughout the grey and white matter of a\ntransgenic mouse line with increased copy number of the\nnative Plp1 gene. Activated microglia in the white and grey\nmatter of transgenic mice are found as early as postnatal\nday 7, before myelin commences in normal cerebra. This\nfinding indicates that degeneration of myelin does not\ncause the microglial response. Microglial numbers are\ndoubled due to in situ proliferation. Compared with the jp\n(jimpy) mouse, which has much more oligodendrocyte\ndeath and hardly any myelin, microglia in the over-\nexpressors show a more dramatic microglial reactivity than\njp, especially in the grey matter. Predictably, many classical\nmarkers of an inflammatory response, including TNF-a\n(tumour necrosis factor-a) and IL-6, are significantly up-\nregulated manyfold. Because inflammation is believed to\ncontribute to axonal degeneration in multiple sclerosis and\nother neurodegenerative diseases, inflammation in mam-\nmals with increased Plp1 gene dosage may also contribute\nto axonal degeneration described in patients and rodents\nwith PLP1 increased gene dosage.\n",

Clinically, nystagmus, psychomotor\ndevelopmental delay, spasticity, hypotonia and ataxia present\nwithin the first 2 months of life in connatal forms of the\ndisease (Hodes et al., 1993). Investigators have concluded that\na major biological function of PLP protein is to maintain the\nstructural integrity of the myelin sheath (Duncan et al., 1987;\nBoison et al., 1995). However, the protein has other functions\nthat include regulation of oligodendrocyte cell death (Knapp,\net al., 2001). There are currently no cures or treatment\noptions available for this rare disease, and the cellular and\nmolecular mechanisms that lead to the phenotypes are poorly\nunderstood.\nTransgenic rodents with Plp1 [proteolipid protein 1 gene\n(non-human)] increased gene dosage are valid models for PMD\nbecause they show the same behavioral deficits that include a\nshortened lifespan as PMD patients (Mastronardi et al., 1993;\nAt the cellular level, many different abnormalities have been\ndescribed in Plp1 transgenics that include not only defects in\n1 To whom correspondence should be addressed (email rskoff@med.wayne.edu).\nAbbreviations: BrdU, bromodeoxyuridine; CCL3, CC chemokine ligand 3; CCR1, CC chemokine receptor 1; CD8, cluster of differentiation 8; CD11b, cluster of differentiation\nmolecule 11B; CNS, central nervous system; CRP, C-reactive protein; CXCL, CXC chemokine ligand; DAB, diaminobenzidine; DPN, day postnatal; EAE, experimental allergic\nencephalomyelitis; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; Iba1, ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1; IL-1b, interleukin-1b;\niNOS, inducible nitric oxide synthase; jp, jimpy; MOG, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein; PMD, Pelizaeus\u00adMerzbacher disease; PLP1, proteolipid protein 1 gene (human); Plp1,\nproteolipid protein 1 gene (non-human); QPCR, quantitative PCR; qRT\u00adPCR, quantitative reverse transcription\u00adPCR; Ta, Tabby; TNF-a, tumour necrosis factor-a.\nE 2010 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://\ncreativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is\nproperly cited.\noligodendrocytes but also neurons. Mice with Plp1 increased\ngene dosage exhibit major oxidative phosphorylation defects\nthat include 50% reductions in ATP brain levels and decreased\nmitochondrial membrane potentials in neurons as well as\noligodendrocytes (Hu\n\u00a8ttemann et al., 2009). Axonal degenera-\ntion is also a peculiar feature of rodents that overexpress the\nHowever, the sequence of events that begins with increased\nPlp1 gene transcription and leads to axonal degeneration is\nunknown. In the present study, we describe microglial\nactivation and up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines\nin the cerebrum of a transgenic mouse that overexpresses\nnative Plp1 (Plp1tg). The relevance of an inflammatory\nresponse cannot be underestimated because inflammation is\na known major contributor to axonal damage and subsequent\nneurological sequelae in many neurodegenerative diseases.\nMicroglial cells are considered resident macrophages of the\nCNS that act as immune defence cells. In normal mature\nbrains, microglial cells are responsible for immune surveil-\nlance (Block and Hong, 2005) and exhibit a distinctive\nmorphology in normal mammals. Microglia can also become\nactivated and turn into motile, amoeboid cells and play a\nmajor role in initiation and progression of neurodegenerative\n1999). These cells undergo dramatic morphological altera-\ntions upon brain injury or immunological stimuli transform-\ning from resting microglia into activated amoeboid microglia\n(Kreutzberg, 1996). For example, in the demyelinating\ndisorder multiple sclerosis, microglia proliferate and increase\nlysosomal activity around active sites of demyelination\nThis is the first study that shows microglial activation in a\ntransgenic mouse that overexpresses native Plp1. Microglial\nactivation in the spinal cord of the jp (jimpy) mouse, a mouse\nwith a Plp1 missense mutation, characterized by its severe\nhypomyelination has been described (Vela et al., 1995). The\noptic nerve and spinal cord of Plp1tg mice are characterized\nby demyelination, but the striatum and cortex are surprisingly\nnormal (Readhead et al., 1994). Therefore it would not be\nexpected that microglia exhibit intense reactivity in areas of\nthe cerebrum if microglial activation is based solely on\nhypomyelination/demyelination. To our surprise, we found that\nmicroglial activation begins before myelination commences in\nthe normal cerebrum. Accordingly, interactions between\noligodendrocytes and axons rather than frank demyelination\nand/or hypomyelination must lead to axonal degeneration\n(Garbern et al., 2002). Thus strategies to modulate oligoden-\ndrocyte function in vivo are necessary to alter the course of\nPMD if myelin abnormalities are not the direct cause of certain\ndebilitating diseases (Garbern et al., 2002).\nTo support the hypothesis that an immune response is\noccurring in Plp1tg mice, we found extensive microglial\nactivation accompanied by an increase in many cytokines\nthat are also elevated in CNS disorders. For example, TNF-a\n(tumour necrosis factor-a) and IL-6 (interleukin-6) are\nelevated in several CNS disorders (Navikas and Link, 1996;\ndemonstrate that TNF-a exacerbates focal ischaemic brain\ninjury and that blocking endogenous TNF-a is neuroprotec-\ntive (Barone et al., 1997). What role these cytokines play\nin exacerbating oligodendrocytes and neuronal dystrophies in\nanimals with Plp1 increased gene dosage is yet to be\ndetermined.\nAnimals\nB6CBA mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, U.S.A.) and\nmale and female Plp1tg mice (Readhead et al., 1994) were\nused for genotyping, immunocytochemistry, cytokine assays\nand electron microscopy. Plp1tg mice aged 30 days and older\nwere first identified by tremors and seizures followed by\nextraction of DNA from tails with the Qiagen DNA easy kit\n(Qiagen, Valencia, CA, U.S.A.). DNA from both tremoring\nPlp1tg mice and presumptive Plp1tg mice younger than 30\ndays were used to measure copy number. Copy number was\ncalculated with the DDCt\n(Ct\nis threshold cycle value) method\nusing a wild-type male with one Plp1 gene as the calibrator\n(Regis et al., 2005). Plp1tg mice that had at least two extra\ncopies of the native Plp1 gene and exhibited tremors and\nseizures were studied. QPCR (quantitative PCR) was per-\nformed with an Eppendorf Realplex PCR system using SYBR\nGreen (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, U.S.A.). Seventeen\u00ad19 DPN jp\nmice (jp+/+Ta; Ta is tabby) were obtained from our breeding\ncolony housed in the Division of Laboratory Animal\nResources, a federally approved animal facility.

This antibody has been used to identify\nmicroglia in many mammalian species (Tonchev et al., 2003;\nYamada et al., 2006). Iba1 immunostained microglial cells are\npresent throughout the grey and white matter of both the\nnormal B6CBA and the Plp1tg mouse cerebrum (Figure 1).\nTypical microglia in normal cerebra, often referred to as\nramified, have characteristic long and thin processes of even\ncalibre (Figure 1A). Their primary processes are usually twice\nas long as the long axis of the perikaryon. Secondary processes\nbranch acutely from primary processes, and sometimes tertiary\nprocesses are distinguishable. Perikarya are characteristically\noval-, pear- or triangular-shaped and are easily distinguished\nfrom the smoothly contoured round oligodendroglia perikarya\nand the larger, irregularly shaped astroglial perikarya. The\nramified morphology is similar across all age groups that we\nstudied in normal B6CBA mice.\nLow-magnification pictures show that the distribution of\nmicroglia in normal cerebra is evenly spaced, with minimal\ncontact between processes of neighbour microglia in both\nthe cortex (Figure 1B), striatum (Figure 1C) and corpus\ncallosum (Figure 1D).\nIn the Plp1tg mice, the morphology and dispersion of these\ncells in the cortical, striatal and callosal regions of cerebra\ndrastically differ from the B6CBA controls (Figures 2A and 2B) in\nall age groups analysed (Figures 2C\u00ad2F). Activated microglia in all\nPlp1tg age groups are distinguished by coarse and short\nprocesses, a notable increase in the amount of these processes,\nand an enlargement of the cell body within the cortical\n(Figures 2C and 2E) and striatal (Figures 2D and 2F) regions. In\nthe cortices, microglia are often clustered together with an\nentanglement of brush-like processes. This arrangement has been\npreviously described and is due to actively proliferating microglia\ncells as an early response to neurodegeneration (Dissing-Olesen\net al., 2007). This pattern is most easily observed between the\ncortex and the white matter in the ventral cortex. In the striatum,\nmicroglial processes run parallel with each other with long\nstraight processes, as if they are following axonal trajectories.\nCorpora callosa of normal B6CBA mice appear to have\nfewer microglia than grey matter (Figure 1D). When com-\npared with controls (Figures 1, 2A and 2B), white matter in\nPlp1tg have an abundance of activated microglia\n(Figures 3A\u00ad3C), with coarse, straight processes that parallel\nthe trajectory of callosal axons.\nMicroglial morphology of Plp1tg mice changes as\nthe mice age\nWith age, the activation of microglia increases in the Plp1tg\ncerebra. In the cortices and striata at 30 DPN (Figures 2E and 2F),\nmicroglia have stubby processes and are found in clusters with\nother brush-like microglia. At 19 DPN (Figures 2C and 2D), the\ntransition from a ramified morphology to a reactive morphology\nis noticeable as processes shorten in length and diameter. In the\nstriatum at 19 DPN (Figure 2D), cell processes do not follow a\nparticular path as do the 30 DPN (Figure 2F) processes.\nIn both white and grey matter at 7 DPN, the earliest age\nstudied, activation of microglia has already begun in the Plp1tg\ncerebra (Figures 4C\u00ad4E). While many microglia have a normal\nmorphology, others exhibit shortened and numerous processes.\nIndividual microglia appear to have long, thin processes typical\nof ramified microglia on one side of the cell and shortened,\nnumerous processes typical of reactive microglia at the opposite\nside of the cell. Microglia in normal brains at this age (Figures 4A\nand 4B) are similar to microglia at older ages, having long\nprocesses that often end in an expanded ball. At 7 DPN in the\nnormal brain, myelinated fibres are not yet detectable in 1 mm\nplastic sections (Figure 4F). Myelinated axons have dark rings\nsurrounding an opaque centre and easily visible in semi-thin\nplastic sections. Therefore the activation of microglia at this age\nis not due to abnormal myelin structure or demyelination.\nGeneration of new microglia in 8 DPN Plp1tg\nmice\nIn addition to microglia activation beginning at 7DPN,\nmicroglia are stimulated to divide at this young age.\nCombined Iba1 and BrdU immunostaining was performed\non Plp1tg cerebra with two or more copies of Plp1. Mice were\ninjected intraperitoneally with BrdU on 6 DPN and killed 40 h\nlater on 8 DPN. Generation of new microglia is abundant\nbecause Iba1+/BrdU+ microglia are present in the cerebrum\n(Figures 5A\u00ad5D). Microglia in the metaphase stage of mitosis\n(Figure 5B) have been detected, indicating that microglia\nTable 1 List of primers used in QPCR analysis\nGene (accession number) Forward primer Reverse primer\nCL Tatar and others\n222 E 2010 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\ndivided approx. 40 h earlier at the time of the BrdU injection\nand shortly before killing. Figure 5 also shows many BrdU+\ncells that are not Iba1+; these cells serve as a control to show\nthat the BrdU-labelled cells are not non-specifically labelled\nwith the Iba1 antibody. Some of these BrdU+ cells are Olig1+,\nindicating that oligodendrocyte progenitors are stimulated to\ndivide (results not shown).\nThe number of microglia is increased in Plp1tg\nmice\nPlp1tg mice with increased gene dosage lead to an increase in\nmicroglia cell number in both white and grey matter of the\ncerebrum when compared with B6CBA mice. A low-\nmagnification micrograph (Figure 6A) shows a hemi-section\nat the level of the anterior commissure at 30 DPN of the mice.\nFor quantification, only cobalt-enhanced sections were used\nfor both control and Plp1tgs.

It can be seen that 19\u00ad27-day-old Plp1tg\nhave significant increases (P,0.0001; Figure 6B) in all three\nareas counted: dorsal cortex immediately superior to the\ncorpus callosum and adjacent to the inter-hemispheric sulcus,\nthe ventral\u00adlateral cortex adjacent to the most ventral tip of the\ncorpus callosum, and the striatum immediately inferior to\nthe corpus callosum and adjacent to the lateral ventricle. The\nresults indicate that the density of microglia cells is higher in\nPlp1tgs (Figure 6B), with a 76% increase in the dorsal cortex,\na 95% increase in the ventral\u00adlateral cortex and 85%\nincrease in the striatum. It is likely that the increase in\nmicroglia in Plp1tg mice is even greater than the cell counts\nbecause microglia are clustered together and sometimes it is\ndifficult to determine the exact number.\nUltrastructure of microglia\nMicroglia in Plp1tg mice (Figures 7A and 7B) exhibit the same\nnuclear and cytoplasmic features as ramified microglia in\nnormal mice. The chromatin forms a dense layer immediately\nbeneath the nuclear membrane and the density of the\ncytoplasm is intermediate to that of oligodendrocytes and\nastrocytes (Skoff, 1975). However, the activated microglia in\nFigure 3 Iba1 cobalt-enhanced immunostaining of 50 mm Vibratomed\nsections from the corpus callosum of 19- (A), 30- (B) and 50-day-old (C)\nPlp1tg mice display activated microglia, where processes follow\ntrajectories of callosal axons\nAt 30 and 50 DPN, microglia are more activated in the white matter\ncompared with the 19 DPN.

They tend to have larger perikarya and thicker\nprocesses than ramified microglia. These features probably\ncorrespond to the larger cell body and thick coarse processes\nvisualized with Iba1 immunostaining. In addition to the\nactivated microglia present in Plp1tg, small, dark cells are also\noccasionally present (Figures 7C and 7D). These cells have too\nlittle cytoplasm to permit definitive classification. The cell in\nFigure7(C) has the nuclear features of an oligodendrocyte\nprogenitor; the cell in Figure 7(D) has the nuclear features of\na microglial cell or oligodendrocyte as these cell types often\ndirectly abut the perikarya of neuronal somata. Conversely,\nthey may be immune cells that have invaded the CNS.\nMicroglial response in jp mice\njp mice have a missense mutation in the Plp1 gene, and they\nexhibit an intense astrocytic hypertrophy and hyperplasia\nthat accompanies the virtual lack of myelin (Skoff, 1976). In\ncontrast with the Plp1tg mice, microglial reactivity in jp is\nrestricted mainly to the white matter (Figures 8A and 8B).\nFurthermore, the Iba1 immunostaining in jp does not appear\nto be as intense as in the Plp1tgs.\nUp-regulation of cytokines\nBased on the intense reactivity of microglia in Plp1tg mice,\nwe predicted the up-regulation of classical inflammatory\nmarkers. qRT\u00adPCR (quantitative reverse transcription\u00adPCR)\nFigure 5 Combined Iba1 and BrdU immunostaining of 50 mm Vibratomed\nsections from a 8 DPN Plp11tg mouse\nMice were injected with BrdU at 6 DPN and killed 40 h later on 8 DPN.

However, there was no increase in IL-1b or\niNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase) at 7\u00ad8 weeks of age.\nBased on a Mouse Inflammatory Cytokine and Receptor RT2\nProfilerTM (SABiosciences) that profiles the expression of 84\nkey genes, we selected the chemokines CCL3, CCL8 and\ninflammatory marker CRP for qRT\u00adPCR. Expression of CCL8\nwas significantly increased by 3.5-fold at 3 weeks and then\nsignificantly increased by 15-fold by 8 weeks postnatal.\nExpression of CCL3 was increased by 4-fold at 3 weeks and\nonly slightly increased by 4.8-fold at 8 weeks postnatal.\nSimilarly, CRP increased modestly from 3 to 8 weeks postnatal\ncompared with normal mice. These results indicate that\nactivation of inflammatory markers is well advanced by 3\nweeks of age, and even increases for some markers as the\ndisease progresses.\nThe qRT\u00adPCR data shown above confirm the results of a\ncytokine and receptor Super Array profile performed on a Plp1tg\nand a wild-type mice at 27 DPN that showed similar increases in\nmessage levels for these chemokines (Table 3).\nThe cell types expressing these inflammatory markers and\ntheir receptors are unknown but are likely to involve a\ncombination of macroglia, microglia and, possibly, immune\ncells because markers of T and B immune cells have been\ndetected in the Plp1tg mice (Ip et al., 2006). We investigated\nwhether macrophages invaded the CNS in the Plp1tg mice.\nThe F4/80 surface antigen was easily detected in spinal cord\nsections of C57BL/6 mice with EAE injected with MOG-(35\u00ad\n55) (Figure 9A). However, spinal cord sections from Plp1tg\nmice processed alongside the EAE sections showed non-\nspecific staining, mainly in axons (Figure 9B). The picture\nshown here represents the most intense staining we found in\nthe overexpressors.\nDISCUSSION\nThe coding region of the PLP1 gene in humans is identical with\nthe Plp1 gene at the amino acid level in rodents (e.g. Stoffel\nsame mutations in rodents as in humans might exhibit\nthe same cellular abnormalities and behavioural deficits.\nIndeed, increased gene dosage of the PLP1 gene in humans\nand Plp1 gene in transgenic rodents exhibit many similar\nbehavioural abnormalities that include ataxia, tremors and\noften a shortened lifespan (Garbern et al., 1999). At the tissue\nlevel, both rodents and humans with increased gene dosage\nexhibit demyelination and/or hypomyelination. At the cellular\nlevel, death of oligodendrocytes and axonal degeneration have\nbeen described in humans and in rodents with higher copy\nmolecular and cellular sequence of events that cause the tissue\nand behavioural abnormalities is poorly understood. Since PLP\nis expressed at high levels only in oligodendrocytes, it is\ngenerally assumed that oligodendrocytes and/or abnormal\nstructure of myelin must directly cause all the abnormalities,\nincluding axonal degeneration. However, in many neurode-\ngenerative diseases, secondary microglial activation and an\ninflammatory response have been described in many human\ndiseases including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and amyotrophic\nlateral sclerosis (Wojtera et al., 2005). In these neurodegen-\nerative diseases, the contribution of microglia to inflammation\nand neuronal destruction is a subject of intense investigation.\nHints that an inflammatory response was present in a human\ncase of PMD have been described because a young male\npatient positively responded to corticosteroids (Gorman et al.,\n2007). In rodents with higher copy number, markers of\nimmune and macrophage cells have been described (Ip et al.,\ninflammatory molecules are activated has not been examined.\nHere, we describe for the first time intense microglial\nreactivity in Plp1 transgenic mice and the up-regulation of\nFigure 7 Ultrastructure of microglia in Plp1tg mice\n(A\u00adD) Electron micrographs from a 43 DPN Plp1tg mouse.

Although it remains to be\ndetermined whether and how the inflammation contributes\nto the neural degeneration in the Plp1tg mice, the well-\nknown role of cytokine and chemokine activation in other\nneurodegenerative diseases makes it likely that microglial\nactivation contributes to disease progression.\nWe find that increased Plp1 gene dosage in line 66 of the\nPlp1tg mice (Readhead et al., 1994) leads to dramatic\nmorphological changes of microglia. The morphological\nchanges in microglia are as dramatic in the grey matter, if\nnot more so, than in the white matter. From 3 weeks\npostnatal, shortening and thickening of microglial processes\nbecame progressively more pronounced in grey matter, and\nthe number of microglial processes was increased. In the\nstriatum and corpus callosum, microglial processes were\nincreased, but they were longer and followed axonal\ntrajectories. Whether they are interposed between oligoden-\ndrocyte processes and axons or directly abut axons is unclear.\nIn active grey matter lesions in multiple sclerosis, activated\nmicroglia appose and ensheath apical dendrites, neurites and\nneuronal perikarya (Peterson et al., 2001). In the cerebral\ncortex in multiple sclerosis patients, more recent studies have\ndemonstrated microglial activation associated with extensive\ninterestingly, microglial activation was noted in regions that\nare not demyelinated (Kutzelnigg et al., 2005). Following an\nexperimentally induced axonal lesion in C57BL/6 mice,\nactivated microglia were proliferating within 3 days and\nmost of the proliferating microglia were aggregating into\nmulticellular clusters (Dissing-Olesen et al., 2007), similar to\nthat observed in our study. Previous studies have examined\nthe distribution and morphology of microglia cells in diseased\nor injured spinal cord and noted greater microglia activation in\nwhite matter as opposed to grey matter (Vela et al., 1995; Vela\nmatter microglia were 3\u00ad5-fold greater than in normal animals\nbut only 60% greater in grey matter than normal animals . We\nfound nearly a doubling of microglia in the grey matter of the\nPlp1tg mice and, as noted in the Results section, these\nnumbers are likely to be underestimates because microglia are\ndensely clustered together. These and our present study (see\nbelow) suggest that microglial activation is caused by other\nfactors/molecules besides degeneration of myelin.\nMost importantly, by the first postnatal week, transforma-\ntion of resting microglia into activated microglia has begun in\nFigure 8 Light micrographs of the brain from a 19 DPN jp mouse stained with Iba1 antibody\n(A) Microglial staining is strongest in corpus callosum (CC), but weak in cerebral cortex (CeCo) and striatum (St).

Some microglia retain a normal\nmorphology, whereas others are retracting and thickening\ntheir processes. The presence of myelin was examined in 1 mm\nplastic sections of complete transverse cerebral sections, in\nwhich individual myelinated axons can be resolved. At this\nage, axons are still unmyelinated in normal cerebrum. This ob-\nservation demonstrates that microglial activation is neither\ndue to demyelination nor due to hypomyelination. Of course,\nthe primary cause of the microglial activation must be\noverexpression of the Plp1 gene, but not necessarily defects in\nmyelination. Both Plp1 mRNA and the protein are detectable\nin mouse cerebra at this age (Macklin et al., 1991). While the\nprincipal function of PLP is often considered to be that of an\nadhesive molecule in myelin (Boison et al., 1995; Gudz et al.,\nfunctions (Nadon and West, 1998; Skoff and Knapp et al.,\nRecently, we described major oxidative phosphorylation\ndefects in the Plp1tg mice that lead to 50% reduction of\ntissue ATP and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. The\ncause of these metabolic defects is likely due to the insertion\nof PLP into mitochondria when the gene is overexpressed\n(Hu\n\u00a8ttemann et al., 2009). Activation of microglia by increases\nin extracellular or exogenous ATP has been described in\nATP, in turn, activates microglial purinergic receptors.\nHowever, as presented above, total ATP levels in tissue\nhomogenates are reduced in these mice. The possibility that\nATP or its degradation products are secreted into the\nextracellular space at higher-than-normal amounts by\nneuroglia is under investigation in our laboratory.\nIn Plp1tg mice, the number of Iba1+ microglia is doubled\nby the third postnatal week, due to their endogenous\nproliferation. Injection of BrdU on 6 DPN and killing 40 h\nlater on 8 DPN followed by Iba1 immunostaining show BrdU+/\nIba1+ microglia with long, branching processes characteristic\nof resting microglia and microglia with short, slightly\nthickened processes characteristic of activated microglia.\nThe cell proliferation studies, carried out between 6 and 8\nDPN, lend further support to the hypothesis that microglial\nTable 3 Overview of cytokine and chemokine mRNA expression in brain of Plp1tg mice (with .3-fold change)\nGene symbol Description Up- or down-regulated\nCRP C-reactive protein pentraxin-related 3.62\nFigure 9 F4/80 immunostaining of 50 mm Vibratomed cervical spinal cords from an 8\u00ad9-month-old EAE mouse (A), a Plp1tg at 43 DPN\n(B), and the Plp11tg without the F4/80 primary antibody (C)\n(A) The EAE spinal cord shows macrophage infiltration (arrows) indicated by cytoplasmic and process staining of membranes.

Our\nfindings agree with the data from jp mouse studies that show\nthat endogenous microglia proliferate. In jp, activated\nmicroglial cells in the grey matter of the spinal cord were\nnot associated with neurons, but were intermingled with\nnerve fibres crossing the grey matter laminae (Vela et al.,\n1995). The origin of additional microglia cells is unknown,\nbut it is suggested that the main source of macrophage/\nreactive microglia cells in jp is the proliferation of\nendogenous microglial cells (Vela et al., 1995).\nThe intense microglial reactivity in Plp1tg mice suggests\nactivation of multiple cytokines and chemokines. Not\nsurprisingly, mRNA expression of classical inflammatory\nmarkers TNF-a and IL-6 were elevated 24- and 7-fold\nrespectively in 2-month-old animals. Since TNF-a and IL-6\nare activated by other regulatory molecules, we performed a\nmultianalyte PCR analysis of inflammatory chemokines and\ntheir receptors from a 27 DPN Plp1tg mouse. mRNA levels of\nnine chemokines were elevated by more than 3-fold and\nseveral were down-regulated. For some of these chemokines\nsuch as CCL3/MIP-1a (macrophage inflammatory protein), its\nreceptor (CCR1) is also up-regulated.\nMany types of immune and glial cells secrete the\nchemokines and cytokines listed above. CCL3 and its receptor\nCCR1 have been identified on astrocytes, oligodendrocytes\nand radial glia after spinal cord injury (Knerlich-Lukoschus\net al., 2010). CCL3 has also been identified in microglial cell\nlines of Sandhoff disease model mice (Kawashita et al., 2009).\nCRP, usually associated with susceptibility to stroke (Di Napoli\net al., 2005), suppresses EAE, suggesting that it has a\nprotective effect in this experimental model of multiple\nsclerosis (Szalai et al., 2002). CXCL13 (CXC chemokine ligand\n13; BCA-1), a chemo-attractant for B lymphocytes, is down-\nregulated in these mice, suggesting that B-lymphocytes may\nnot be attracted to the CNS. However, lymphocyte and\nmacrophage markers (CD8+ and CD11b+) have been detected\nin aged heterozygous Plp1tg mice (Ip et al., 2006). We failed\nto find evidence of macrophages in the Plp1tg mice using the\nclassical F4/80 antibody that we do not think is due to\ntechnical issues because in the same immunostaining\nexperiment we identified F4/80+ cells in EAE mice. Our\nfailure to find vascular derived macrophage cells may be due\nto the differences in age of the transgenic mice used in the\ndifferent studies. Increases in CD11b+ cells were first detected\nat approx. 4 months in Plp1tg heterozygous mice and their\nnumbers increased with age (Ip et al., 2006); in contrast, we\nused 1\u00ad2-month-old homozygous mice as they die at approx.\n2 months of age. Because the CD11b+ marker is also\nexpressed by endogenous microglial cells (Clausen et al.,\ncells may be microglia. Other studies have shown that\nmicroglial precursors derived from embryonic stem cells\n2009) and other immune cell markers, making it difficult to\ndistinguish between resident and invasive immune cells. Since\npresentation of antigens by microglia to T-cells requires a\nperiod of time (Brown and Neher, 2010), a combination of\nboth microglia and immune cells is likely present in Plp1tg\nmice, the ratios of innate to humoral cells changing as\nthe rodents age. More important than identifying all the cell\ntypes that contribute to inflammation in the Plp1tgs, the\nmolecular events that cause the inflammation and how\nthe different cytokines modulate neuronal function need to\nbe investigated. Importantly, the extent and type of\ninflammation in PMD patients needs to be examined and\ncompared with rodents that overexpress Plp1.\n"
