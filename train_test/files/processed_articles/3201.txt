In contrast to the existing studies on inflation forecasting for the euro\narea, this study employs and compares both direct and iterated forecasting models.\nThe results suggest that M3, especially its trend or core growth rate, was on average a useful\nindicator for inflation at medium term horizons, which is consistent with the role of the\nmonetary analysis in the ECB's monetary policy strategy as a tool for the assessment of the\nmedium to long-term risks to price stability. But, a closer look at the forecasting performance\nreveals that, over the last three years, the forecasting performance of M3 has not been as\ngood anymore as it used to be in the early years of EMU.\nThe further analysis reveals, however, that it might be premature to neglect monetary\nindicators on these grounds. We find that a simple combination of all monetary forecasts\nperforms well also over the more recent period. Also, the extremely good and stable\nperformance of an M3 series corrected for the effects of portfolio shifts into and out of M3\nsince mid 2001 constructed by the ECB suggests that M3 is still a very useful indicator for\nfuture price movements once the distorting effects of speculative portfolio flows are\nidentified and removed. These results therefore suggest on the whole that monetary\nindicators are still useful indicators for inflation in the euro area, but that a thorough and\nbroad based monetary analysis is needed to extract the information content of monetary\ndevelopments for future inflation.\nNicht-technische Zusammenfassung\nDieses Papier untersucht die G\u00fcte monet\u00e4rer Prognosen der HVPI Inflationsrate im Euroraum\n\u00fcber den Zeitraum erstes Quartal 1999 bis zum vierten Quartal 2005.

Introduction\nThe main elements of the ECB's monetary policy strategy, announced on 13 October 1998\ndefinition of price stability and a so-called \"two-pillar\" framework for the assessment of the\noutlook for price developments and the current risks to price stability. The ECB's definition\nof price stability is an annual increase in the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) of\nbelow but close to two percent. The two-pillar framework for the assessment of the risks to\nprice stability combines a `'broadly based assessment of the outlook for the future price\ndevelopments'' based on a \"wide range of economic and financial variables\" (economic\nanalysis) and a \"prominent role for money\" with a reference value for the growth rate of the\nbroad monetary aggregate M3 (Money Pillar).1\nThe prominent role assigned to money in the ECB's monetary policy strategy was mainly\nmotivated by the conviction that the development of the price level in the medium to long-\nterm is a monetary phenomenon (ECB, 1999), which was supported by a number of empirical\nstudies showing that the long-run euro area M3 demand function was stable (Brand and\nwere leading euro area inflation (e.g. Gerlach and Svensson 2000, Trecroci and Vega 2002\nHowever, the ECB's special emphasis on the monetary analysis has been subject to intense\ncriticism from the very beginning. Besides theoretically motivated reservations against the\n I thank J\u00f6rg Breitung, Claus Greiber, Heinz Herrmann, Christian Schumacher, Jens Weidmann and\nAndreas Worms for helpful comments and suggestions. The views expressed in this paper are solely\nmy own and do not necessarily represent the views of the Deutsche Bundesbank.\n1 While the two pillars were originally described as two parallel analytical perspectives, the ECB\n(2003) has clarified in the evaluation of its monetary policy strategy that the money pillar \"mainly\nserves as a means of cross-checking, from a medium to long-term perspective, the short to medium\nterm indications coming from economic analysis.\" In this context, the ECB has further clarified that\nthese medium to long-term risks to price stability are assessed based on a broad based monetary\nanalysis, which \"will take into account developments in a wide range of monetary indicators,\nincluding M3, its components and counterparts, notably credit, and various measures of excess\nliquidity.\"\nmoney pillar,2 it has also been argued that money might be an unreliable indicator for\ninflation because of frequent shifts in velocity.3 In fact, since the beginning of EMU the\nannual growth rate of the M3 monetary aggregate was almost continuously above the ECB's\nreference value of 4.5%, since mid 2001 even substantially so, without showing signs of\nreversion or triggering a tightening of policy rates or an acceleration in goods price inflation.\nThese developments appear to support the critics' view and have cast doubt on the usefulness\nof M3 as an indicator of risks to price stability in the euro area.\nIn this paper we want to assess this issue by testing the performance of monetary indicators in\ncontrast to the existing studies on inflation forecasting for the euro area, this study employs\nand compares both direct and iterated forecasting models. Direct forecasts involve regressing\nan h-period-ahead value of the dependent variable on its own lags and lagged values of other\nindicators. H-periods ahead out-of-sample forecasts are then calculated as a one-step ahead\nforecast from the estimated forecasting regression. Iterated forecasts entail estimating a VAR\nor near-VAR model comprising the variable to be forecast and the other indicator variables\ntaken into account in the forecasting model. H-periods ahead forecasts are then obtained by\niterating the estimated VAR h-periods forward. Most empirical forecasting studies rely on the\ndirect approach to forecasting, motivated by theoretical findings that the h-step ahead\nprojection approach reduces the potential impact of specification error. However, the widely\naccepted view that direct forecasting models are superior has recently been challenged.\nMarcellino, Stock and Watson (2004) argue that choosing between direct and iterated\nforecasts involves a trade-off between potential estimation bias and estimation variance.\n2 As Gal\u00ed (2003) puts it, while the pillar associated with the economic analysis can be related to\nmodern New Keynesian style models, \"it is much harder, however, to think of a class of models that\nwould attribute a more direct role to money in the determination of inflation and which central bankers\ncould view as useful.\"\n3Estrella and Mishkin (1997) have argued that volatility in money demand dominates movements in\nmoney growth in an environment of subdued inflation and money growth, giving rise to a low signal-\nto-noise ratio of money growth with respect to inflation. The same line of reasoning has also been\n4Out-of-sample performance tests are commonly regarded as being superior to in-sample tests, as the\nlatter are commonly held to generate spurious rejections of the null of no predictability because of size\ndistortions arising from data mining (e.g. Granger, 1990). Other compelling reasons to rather rely on\nout-of-sample tests is that they more accurately reflect the data and information constraints faced by\nforecasters and policymakers in real-time and that in-sample tests may be misleading if there is a\nstructural break in the forecasting model (Stock and Watson, 2003). In the light of the recent\ndiscussion of the potential instability of the link between M3 indicators and inflation in the euro area,\nthe last point is of particular relevance in the present context.\nWhile the direct forecasts reduce the impact of model mis-specification bias, the iterated\nforecasts produce more efficient forecasts when the models are correctly specified. In the\nfollowing we estimate both direct and iterated forecasting models of euro area HICP inflation\nin order to see which approach works best for forecasting euro area inflation. This dual\napproach also serves as a robustness check of the findings on the predictive ability of the\nindicators considered.\nThe analysis starts by assessing the forecasting performance of simple bivariate forecasting\nmodels considering a large number of aggregate euro area monetary and non-monetary\nindicators. The forecasting performance of the indicators is evaluated against the forecasts\nproduced by simple autoregressive forecasting models of inflation. By taking a closer look at\nthe forecast errors we assess whether the forecasting performance of monetary indicators has\ndeteriorated over the more recent period. We also consider the performance of factor based\nforecasts and simple forecast combination methods, which have commonly been found to\nimprove upon single indicator based forecasts.\nBesides these more standard forecasting exercises, we further assess the usefulness of\ntrivariate forecasting models, combining the low frequency component of M3 growth with\nother non-monetary indicators. This exercise is motivated by the recent literature on the role\nof monetary aggregates in explaining inflation dynamics in the euro area. Gerlach (2003,\n2004) has suggested to interpret the ECB's two pillar strategy as a combination of two\ndifferent models of the inflation process, the money pillar as a model of the longer-term\ninflation trends and the economic analysis as a model of the short to medium-run\ndeterminants of inflation, which can be formalised by a two-pillar Phillips Curve, adding\ntrend or core money growth to an otherwise standard empirical Phillips Curve. While several\nstudies have shown that such a two-pillar Phillips Curve provides a good in-sample fit for\neuro area inflation5, the usefulness of the concept for forecasting inflation out-of-sample has\nnot yet been explored. In this paper we aim to fill this gap by considering the out-of-sample\nperformance of trivariate two-pillar Phillips curve type forecasting models.\nFinally, we assess the relevance of the estimated effect of portfolio shifts on the out-of-sample\nforecasting performance of M3 based indicators. The ECB has commonly argued that the high\ngrowth rates of M3 observed since mid 2001 were driven by portfolio shifts caused by a\nstrong preference of investors for liquid assets in the wake of the exceptional economic and\nfinancial uncertainties during this period and that the otherwise close link between M3 and\ninflation has been temporarily blurred by this effect.6 The ECB constructs a measure of M3\ncorrected for the effect of portfolio shifts based on an ARIMA model of M3 augmented with\nintervention variables to capture the effects of portfolio shifts into and out of M3.7 In order to\nassess the effect of the estimated portfolio shift effects on the indicator property of M3 we\nalso assess the forecasting performance of the corrected M3 measure. Clearly, the portfolio\nshift correction of the M3 aggregate is done based on ex-post information and was not\navailable ex-ante, so that the forecasting exercise is not a real assessment of the out-of-sample\nperformance of the corrected M3 measure. However, analysing the indicator property of the\ncorrected M3 measure is still useful as it gives an indication of whether M3 is in principle\nstill a useful indicator of inflation and whether the corrected M3 measure might be useful for\nthe current assessment of future risks to price stability.\nThe paper is organised as follows. In section 2 we assess the performance of simple univariate\nand bivariate forecasting models. Section 3 investigates the performance of forecasts based on\nfactor analysis and simple forecast combination methods. In section 4 we assess the\nperformance of trivariate two-pillar Phillips Curve type forecasting models combining the\nlow frequency component of M3 growth with other non-monetary indicators. In section 5 we\ninvestigate whether adjusting the euro area M3 series for the estimated effect of portfolio\nshifts helps to improve the performance of M3 based indicators in forecasting inflation over\nthe more recent period. Section 6 concludes.\n2. Standard autoregressive and bivariate forecasting models\nIn this section we assess the performance of univariate and bivariate forecasting models in\nsimulated out-of-sample set-up. This means that forecasts are calculated using only data prior\nto the forecasting period in order to most accurately reflect the data limitation faced by\nforecasters in real time.8 The analysis employs both direct and iterated forecasting models and\nUnless otherwise indicated, all data are official aggregate euro area data taken from the ECB\nwebsite, backdated with the corresponding series from the Area Wide Model (AWM)\ndatabase if necessary. The sample period for the recursive forecasting regressions starts in\n1985Q1 in order to insure identical sample periods for all forecasting regressions and also to\nmitigate the effect of the disinflation of the early 1980s on the results. The range of forecast\nhorizons considered is 1 to 12 quarters.\nAs a first step we assess simple univariate forecasting models of inflation, modelling the\ninflation process solely as a function of its own lags. The univariate direct forecasting model\ntakes the form:\n( )\nh h\nt h t t h\nL u\n   \n+ +\n= + + ,\nwhere\nt\n is the quarterly HICP inflation rate and h\nt h\n\n+\nis the h-period ahead rate of change in\nh\nt h t h t\n\n+ +\n= . The lag order was recursively determined\nbased on the Schwarz-Bayes information criterion (SBC) considering up to four lags. Since\nwe consider forecast horizons of 1 to 12 quarters, this means that we estimate at each\nrecursion twelve forecasting models (one for each forecast horizon), compare for each\nforecasting model four model specifications and calculate one step ahead forecasts based on\nthe model with the best SBC.\nThe iterated autoregressive forecasting model is given by:\n( )\nt t t\nL u\n   \n+ +\n= + + ,\nwhere again the lag order of the lagged endogenous variable was recursively selected using\nthe SBC. Here we estimate at each recursion only one forecasting model, compare four\nspecifications and calculate one to twelve steps ahead forecasts based on the model selected\n8 Of course, in order to perform a \"real\" real time exercise one would need to use unrevised real time\ndata as they were available at the time the forecast was made. Such a real time database does\nunfortunately not exist for the euro area.\n9 A possible complementary approach to construct forecasts for euro area aggregates is to aggregate\nindividual country forecasts. See e.g. Marcellino et al. (2001) and Angelini et al. (2001).\nby the SBC. Since equation (2) generates forecasts for quarterly inflation we have to obtain\nthe forecast for the h-period ahead inflation rate by calculating at each turn the h-period ahead\naverage of the quarterly inflation forecasts.\nIn Table 1 we report the Root-Mean-Squared forecast error (RMSE) produced by the\nproduced by a simple random walk forecast, which takes the last observed inflation rate as the\nforecast. Finally, we report in the last row of the table the ratio of the Mean squared forecast\nerror (MSE) produced by the direct forecast to the MSE produced by the iterated forecasts\nwith the p-value of the test the ratio is equal to one, i.e. that the forecast performance was not\nsignificantly different, in parentheses.10 The results show that both autoregressive models\nclearly outperform the random-walk forecast. The iterated forecasts perform slightly better\nthan the direct forecasts, but not significantly so. A look at the absolute forecast errors\nproduced by the two competing models since 1999 (Figure 1) shows that the iterated forecast\nmodel also performs better in the majority of periods, though, with few exceptions, only by a\nTable 1: Performance of univariate forecasting models\nRMSE Direct\nRMSE Iterated\nRMSE Random-\nNote: The table reports the root mean squared forecast error (RMSE) for the direct, the\nrow reports the ratio of the mean squared forecast error (MSE) generated by the direct\nforecasting model to the MSE of the iterated forecasting model with p-values of a test that it\nis equal to one in parentheses. An MSE ratio smaller (larger) than one therefore indicates\nthat the direct model performs better (worse) than the iterated model.\n10 The standard error for the MSE ratio was calculated based on a heteroskedasticity and\nautocorrelation consistent (HAC) estimate of the variance-covariance (VCV) matrix of the forecast\nerrors using the  -method. The HAC estimate of the VCV matrix was obtained using a Bartlett\nkernel with the number of lags equal to the forecast horizon. This approach to forecast evaluation,\nwhich has been suggested by West (1996), is applicable in this context since the direct and iterated\nforecasting models are non-nested at forecast horizons 2 to 12.\n11The finding that the iterated forecasts perform in general better than the direct forecasts is consistent\nwith the findings by Marcellino et al. (2004) for the US.\nFigure 1: Performance of univariate inflation forecasts\n1 quarter ahead\n3 quarters ahead\n5 quarters ahead\n7 quarters ahead\n9 quarters ahead\n2 quarters ahead\n4 quarters ahead\n6 quarters ahead\n8 quarters ahead\nNote: The plots show the absolute forecast errors for the autoregressive direct forecasting\nmodel (solid line) and the autoregressive iterated forecasting model (dotted line).\nTaking the autoregressive forecasts as the benchmark, we assess as the next step bivariate\nforecasting models of inflation, modelling the inflation process as a function of its own lags\nand lags of one other indicator variable x. The bivariate direct forecasting model is given by:\n( ) ( )\nh h\nt h t t t h\nL L x u\n    \n+ +\n= + + +\nand the bivariate iterated forecasting model is given by a SUR of the form:\n( ) ( )\n( ) ( )\nt t t t\nt t t t\nL L x u\nx L x L v\n    \n   \n+ +\n+ +\n= + + +\n= + + +\nThe lag order was again determined based on the SBC, allowing for different lag orders\nacross regressors and also across equations in the case of the iterated forecasting model\nsearching respectively over up to four lags. Forecasts were then computed in the same way as\nfor the univariate forecasting models.\nThe performance of the single indicator forecasting models is evaluated based on the ratio of\nthe MSE produced by the bivariate models to the MSE produced by the respective univariate\nmodel. A caveat is that the evaluation has to be based on the relative MSE number only. Due\nto the recursive lag order selection, the bivariate and univariate models are at some dates\nnested and at some dates not, so that neither the forecast evaluation approach suggested by\nWest (1996) for non-nested models nor the approach suggested by Clark and McCracken\nWe consider four monetary growth indicators: The quarterly growth rates of the monetary\naggregates M1, M2, M3 and of bank loans to the private sector (dm1, dm2, dm3, dloans).13\nAgainst the background of the recent literature which has stressed that it is only the low\nfrequency movements in M3 which are relevant for inflation14 we also consider the trend, or\ncore growth rate of the M3 aggregate (dm3t), calculated using a one side Hodrick-Prescott\n(HP) filter with a smoothing parameter of 1600.15 We further consider three M3 indicators\nderived from the long-run money demand model: the change in p-star (dpstar), the real\nmoney gap (mgap) and the monetary overhang (mov). These indicators are derived from a\nrecursively estimated long-run M3 demand function using the current consensus specification\n( )\nt t t t\nm p a a y a oc u\n- = + + + , where m is the\n(log) M3, p is the (log) GDP deflator, y is (log) real GDP and oc is the opportunity cost of\n12 Giacomini and White (2004) have recently suggested a test which is applicable to both nested and\nnon-nested models. However, the test requires moving window estimation of the forecasting\nregressions, while we perform recursive estimation throughout. We also experimented with moving\nwindow estimation of the forecasting regressions but found these forecasting models to perform much\nworse than the recursively estimated models.\n13 The seasonally adjusted series for private sector loans from the ECB website was spliced with the\nseries constructed by Calza et al. (2001) in 1991Q1. All quarterly monetary series are monthly\naverages.\n15 We also experimented with other values of the smoothing parameter. The lower the smoothing\nparameter the more closely the filtered series adjusts to the actual series, so that the results become\nincreasingly similar to the ones obtained from the quarterly M3 growth rate. Higher values of the\nsmoothing parameter delivered worse forecasts.\n16 Alternative specification of the long-run M3 demand function have been proposed by Brand and Cassola\nholding M3, measured as the spread of the three months money market rate over M3's own\nrate of return.17 From the estimated long-run money demand function we obtain the long-run\ntrend price level p-star * * *\nt t t t\np m a a y a oc\n= - - - , where an asterisk denotes the long-run\ntrend level of a variables which was calculated using a one sided HP filter with a smoothing\nvalue of 1600. The change in p-star is then given by * * *\nt t t t\np m a a y a oc\n =  - -  -  , the real\nmoney gap is given by * * * *\n( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )\nt t t t t t t t t t\nm p m p p p m p a a y a oc\n- - - = - - = - - + + and\nthe monetary overhang is simply the long-run residual given by\n( )\nt t t t t\nu m p a a y a oc\n= - - - - .\nBesides these eight monetary indicators we further consider a number of non-monetary\nindicators: quarterly real GDP growth (dgdpr), the level and first difference of the output\ngap18 (ygap and dygap), the level and first difference of the unemployment rate (unr and\ndunr), the log level and quarterly growth rate of total employment (emp and demp), the level\nand first difference of the short-term interest rate (irs and dirs), level and first difference of the\nlong-term interest rate (irl and dirl), the yield spread (long-term rate less short-term rate), the\nquarterly rate of change in the share price index (dsp), the quarterly rate of change in the\nproducer price index (dppi), the log level and quarterly growth rate of real unit labour costs19\n(rulc and drulc), the quarterly rate of change in nominal unit labour costs (dulc), quarterly\nnominal wage inflation (dwage), quarterly import price inflation (dimpp), the quarterly rate of\nchange in the nominal effective exchange rate (dexr), the quarterly rate of change in the euro\nbased commodity price index20 (dcom) and the quarterly rate of change the euro based world\noil price index21 (doil).\nTables 2 and 3 present the results. An MSE ratio less (larger) than one means that the\nbivariate model has produced a lower (larger) MSE than the autoregressive model. The results\nsuggest that the M3 growth indicators improve upon the autoregressive forecast at forecast\nhorizons beyond six to eight quarters, while the M3-demand based indicators as well as the\nother monetary growth indicators do in general not outperform the autoregressive forecast. In\n17 The data for the own rate of M3 were taken from Calza et al (2001) and extended by own calculations using\nBundesbank data.\n18The output gap is calculated as the percent deviation of real GDP from its long-run trend obtained using a one\nsided HP filter with smoothing parameter 1600.\n19 Nominal unit labour cost deflated with the GDP deflator.\n20 The commodity price index is the HWWA US-$ based commodity price index converted to  using the\nhistorical -$ exchange rate from the OECD Economic Outlook database.\n21The oil price index is the US-$ average price of crude petroleum from the IMF International Financial Statistics\ndatabase also converted to  using the historical -$ exchange rate series.\naccordance with the findings of the recent literature on the information content of low\nfrequency movements in money for inflation already referred to above, we find that the best\nperforming monetary indicator is the one sided HP-filtered M3 growth rate. In the group of\nnon-monetary indicators, only the change in nominal wages and, to a lesser extent, the change\nin nominal unit labour costs, generate better forecasts than the autoregressive forecasting\nmodels. In fact, nominal wage inflation is the best performing single indicator at forecast\nhorizons beyond four quarters, except for direct forecasts beyond the two year horizon, where\nthe M3 growth indicators perform better. A more detailed assessment of the relative\nperformance of the direct and the iterated forecasting approach is provided in the appendix.\nOn the whole, the results suggest that M3 growth contains useful information about future\nHICP inflation in the euro area at least at longer prediction horizons. This finding is consistent\nwith the results reported by Nicoletti Altimari (2001). However, as we have already discussed\nin the introduction, since 2001 euro area M3 growth has been well above the ECB's reference\nvalue, without triggering an acceleration of inflation or an increase in ECB policy rates. This\nsuggests that the usefulness of M3 growth as an inflation indicator may have deteriorated over\nthe more recent time period.\nIn order to assess this point we take a closer look at the forecast errors produced by the M3\ngrowth indicator models over time. Figures 2 and 3 show the absolute forecast errors\nproduced by the quarterly M3 growth model and the trend M3 growth model respectively\ntogether with the absolute forecast error produced by the autoregressive forecasting model.\nThe graphs reveal that the good average forecasting performance of the M3 growth indicators\nfor longer forecast horizons over the sample period is mainly driven by the very good\nperformance of these indicators, especially for the direct forecasting models, over the first two\nyears of EMU. Since 2003, however, the money growth indicators cannot outperform the\nautoregressive forecasts anymore. Compared to this, the forecasting performance of wage\ninflation, which we show in Figure 4, has been more stable. The wage inflation based\nforecasts did not perform as well as the direct money growth forecasts in 1999 and 2000, but\ncontinuously outperform the autoregressive forecasts over the full sample period.\nTable 2: Bivariate direct forecasting models\nMonetary indicators\nNon-monetary indicators\nNote: The table reports the ratio of the mean squared forecast error (MSE) generated by the\nrespective bivariate forecasting model to the MSE of the autoregressive forecasting model.

Factor based forecasts and forecast combinations\nIn order to avoid over-parameterisation of the forecasting models, time series forecasting of\neconomic variables usually focuses on low-dimensional models like the autoregressive or\nsingle indicator models considered in the previous section. The disadvantage of this approach\nis that when the information content of one or a group of indicators is considered, the\ninformation contained in the other available indicators is not taken into account. In order to\ncombine and condense the information contained in a large group of indicators, two\napproaches have been suggested in the literature: the use of diffusion indices or factors, which\nextract the main common driving forces (factors) of a group of indicators before estimating\nthe forecasting model, and the use of forecast combination methods, which combine the\nforecasts produced by the single indicator models.\nFactor models suppose that a group of indicator variables is driven by a few common factors\nwhich may summarise their information content for forecasting purposes. Stock and Watson\n(2002) propose to use static principal components analysis to derive the common factors.22 In\nthis framework, we obtain the first r static factors for a group of n indicators over a sample\nperiod of size T from\nt t\n=  , where F is a Txr matrix of static factors, X is a Txn matrix of\nobservable indicators and  is an nxr matrix of eigenvectors corresponding to the r largest\neigenvalues of the sample variance-covariance matrix of the indicator variables. In order to\nassess the performance of factor based forecasts we first recursively determine the number of\nfactors using the\nP\nIC criterion of Bai and Ng (2002)23 and then estimate based on the thus\ndetermined number of factors direct and iterated forecasting models. We perform the principal\ncomponent analysis separately for the group of monetary indicators and the group of non-\nmonetary indicators and also for the group of all indicators together, considering one factor\nfor the group of monetary indicators, up to two factors for the group of non-monetary\nframework developed by Stock and Watson to also allow for dynamic relationships between the\nvariables in the model. However, these extensions impose a certain structure on the dynamics of the\nsystem which may not be consistent with the data and also have a more complicated structure, so that\nthat they are more prone to misspecification in empirical applications. Boivin and Ng (2005)\ninvestigate the forecasting performance of the different approaches to factor derivation and conclude\nthat the Stock and Watson approach outperforms the other approaches just because of these caveats.\nFor these reasons we rely on the Stock and Watson approach to derive the factors.\n23 The criterion function is given by })\n,\nln(min{\n)\n/\n)\n((\n))\n(\n)\n/\nln((\n)\nT\nN\nNT\nT\nN\nr\nF\nC\nX\nNT\nr\ni\nT\nt t\ni\nit\nP\n+\n+\n-\n=  \n= =\n,\nwhere r is the number of factors, N is the number of indicators, T is the size of the sample period and\ni\nC is a nxr matrix of factor loadings which is estimated by applying OLS to each equation (Bai and\nNg, 2002). The number of factors is determined by minimising the criterion function.\nindicators and up to three factors for the group of all indicators. For each recursion the\nforecasting model is specified according to the number of common factors selected by the\nP\nIC criterion. The dynamic specification is then chosen based on the SBC criterion as in the\nprevious section considering up to four lags for each regressor and allowing lag orders to\ndiffer across regressors and across equations.24\nAn alternative to constructing composite indicators based on principal component analysis is\nto first estimate the forecasting models for the individual indicator variables and then to\ncombine the forecasts using forecast combination techniques.25 The combination forecast is\ngiven by\nn\nc\nt it it\ni\nf f\n\n=\n=  , where\nit\nf is the forecast produced by indicator i in period t and\nit\n\nis the weight given to this forecast. The combination forecasts we consider here are the mean\nand the median of the forecasts produced by the bivariate models estimated in the previous\nsection.26 We again recursively perform the analysis separately for the group of monetary\nindicators and the group of non-monetary indicators and also for all indicators together.\nTable 4 reports the relative MSEs of the factor based forecasts and of the forecast\ncombinations with respect to the autoregressive forecast.27 The results suggest that the\nforecast combination methods perform better than the factor based forecasts, which is\nconsistent with the findings of Stock and Watson (2004). The mean forecast, in particular for\nthe group of monetary indicators, can clearly improve upon the autoregressive forecast and on\naverage also tends to perform better than the bivariate forecasts of the previous section.\n24 This means, for example, that if at one of the recursions three factors were selected for the whole\ngroup of indicators, four dimensional forecasting models had to be estimated. In the case of the direct\nforecasting model this entailed regressing h-period ahead inflation on its own lags and lags of the three\nfactors selecting the lag order of the regressors based on the SBC, which means comparing for each\nforecasting horizon 256 models and selecting the one with the best SBC. For the iterated forecasting\nmodels a four equation SUR had to be estimated with lag orders of the four equations determined by\nthe SBC, which means that 256 models had to be compared for each equation of the SUR.\n25 For surveys of the forecast combination literature see Diebold and Lopez (1996), Newbold and\n26 More sophisticated forecast combination methods base the forecast weights in some way on\nprevious forecast performance. Due to the small sample period we do not have sufficient forecast\nobservations to apply such more sophisticated combination methods. However, in their comparison of\nthe forecast performance of various forecast combination methods, Stock and Watson (2004) find that\nsimple forecast combinations, like the mean, tend to perform better than more sophisticated methods.\n27 A comparison of the performance of the direct and the iterated forecasts shows that, as in the case of\nthe autoregressive and single indicator models, the iterated forecasts tend to perform somewhat better\nthan the direct forecast, except for the longest forecast horizons. But the MSE ratios are again never\nsignificantly different from one. We do not report the results here for brevity, but they are available\nupon request.\nTable 4: Factor forecasts and forecast combinations\nDirect forecasting models\nIterated forecasting models\nNote: The table reports the ratio of the mean squared forecast error (MSE) generated by the\nrespective forecasting model to the MSE of the autoregressive forecasting model. M refers to\nthe group of monetary indicators, NM to the group of non-monetary indicators and T to the\ntotal group of monetary and non-monetary indicators. An MSE ratio smaller (larger) than\none therefore indicates that the model performs better (worse) than the autoregressive model.\nFigure 5 takes a closer look at the forecasting performance of the mean forecast of the\nmonetary indicators over time. The graphs reveal that the mean monetary forecast not only\nperformed very well on average, but that the performance was also very stable over time. The\nfinding that simple combination forecasts may improve upon autoregressive forecasts even\nwhen the forecasts based on individual predictors are unstable over time and on average\nperform worse than an autoregressive benchmark is consistent with findings reported by\nStock and Watson (2003) who study the performance of forecast combination techniques in\nforecasting GDP growth in the G7 countries. An implication of this result is that a broader\nbased monetary analysis, taking into account the information content of a larger group of\nmonetary indicators, may yield a more reliable and more robust assessment of inflation trends\nthan focusing on a single monetary indicator.\nFigure 5: Mean forecast of monetary indicators vs autoregressive forecasts\nDirect forecasting model\n1 quarter ahead\n3 quarters ahead\n5 quarters ahead\n7 quarters ahead\n9 quarters ahead\n2 quarters ahead\n4 quarters ahead\n6 quarters ahead\n8 quarters ahead\nIterated forecasting model\n1 quarter ahead\n3 quarters ahead\n5 quarters ahead\n7 quarters ahead\n9 quarters ahead\n2 quarters ahead\n4 quarters ahead\n6 quarters ahead\n8 quarters ahead\nNote: The plots show the absolute forecast errors of the mean forecasts of the bivariate\nforecasting models of monetary indicators (dotted line) and of the autoregressive forecasting\nmodel (solid line).\n4. A two-pillar Phillips Curve forecasting model\nIn the evaluation of its monetary policy strategy, the ECB (2003) has emphasised that the\neconomic analysis within the framework of its non-monetary pillar serves to \"identify short to\nmedium term risks to price stability\", while the monetary analysis in the framework of its\nmoney pillar assesses the \"medium to long-term trends in inflation\". This phrasing suggests\nthat the ECB's two pillar strategy may be interpreted as a combination of two separate\nforecasting models for inflation, the non-monetary pillar for the short to medium-run and the\nmoney pillar for the medium to long-run (Gerlach 2003, 2004). As a way to formalise this\nview of the inflation process, several studies have adopted a two-pillar Phillips Curve model,\nspecifying the euro area inflation process as a function of trend or core money growth and\nsome measure of the output gap. 28 While these studies have shown that such a two-pillar\nPhillips Curve model provides a good in-sample fit for euro area inflation, the usefulness of\nthe concept for forecasting inflation out-of-sample has not yet been explored.\nIn this section we proceed to forecast euro area inflation based on trivariate, two-pillar\nPhillips Curve type forecasting models, modelling inflation as a function of its own lags, lags\nof trend money growth measured as the growth rate of one sided HP filtered M3 ( T\nt\nm\n ), and\nlags of a non-monetary indicator (x). The trivariate direct and iterated forecasting models are\nrespectively given by\n( ) ( ) ( )\nh T h\nt h t t t t h\nL L m L x u\n     \n+ +\n= + +  + +\n( ) ( ) ( )\n( ) ( ) ( )\n( ) ( ) ( )\nT\nt t t t t\nt t t t t\nT\nt t t t t\nL L m L x u\nm L L m L x\nx L L m L x v\n     \n     \n    \n+ +\n+ +\n+ +\n= + +  + +\n = + +  + +\n= + +  + +\nLag orders were selected and forecasts computed recursively in the same way as for the\nunivariate and bivariate models, allowing for different lag orders across regressors and also\nacross equations in the case of the iterated forecasting model searching over up to four lags\nrespectively.\nTables 5 and 6 report the ratio of the MSE produced by the trivariate forecasting models to\nthe MSE produced by the respective univariate model. For comparison we also report in the\nfirst row of the tables the relative MSE for the bivariate model including trend M3 growth.\nBesides considering each non-monetary indicator separately, we also consider a factor based\nforecast29 and the mean and median of the trivariate forecasts. The results suggest that the\ntrivariate models perform very well, on the whole clearly outperforming the autoregressive\nforecast over the full sample period. Some of the trivariate models also outperform the best\nbivariate forecasting models and also the forecast combinations considered in the previous\nsection. For the direct forecasting model, a true two-pillar Phillips Curve model comprising\ntrend money growth and the output gap performs best on average, while for the iterated\nforecasts a trivariate model comprising wage inflation is the best performer. A more detailed\nassessment of the relative performance of the direct and the iterated forecasting approach is\nagain provided in the appendix.\nOn the whole, the results suggest that the two-pillar Phillips Curve forecasting model is a\nuseful tool for forecasting inflation. However, a closer look at the performance of the models\nover time reveals that also the trivariate models were not able to outperform the\nautoregressive models over the more recent time period. Figure 6 shows as an example the\nperformance of the trivariate model with the output gap as the non-monetary indicator. The\ngraphs show that while the model performs better than the bivariate model with M3 growth,\nits predictive ability relative to the simple autoregressive forecasting model has also\n29 The factor analysis is performed in the same way as in the previous section, considering up to two\nfactors.\n30 For the other non-monetary indicators we obtain a very similar picture. The results are available\nupon request.\nTable 5: Trivariate direct forecasting models\nNote: The table reports the ratio of the mean squared forecast error (MSE) generated by the\ntrivariate forecasting model comprising trend M3 growth and the respective non-monetary\nindicator to the MSE of the autoregressive forecasting model.

Portfolio shift effects\nThe ECB has commonly argued that the high growth rates of M3 since 2001 have been driven\nby transitory portfolio shifts caused by a strong preference of investors for liquid assets in the\nwake of the exceptional economic and financial uncertainties during this period.31 This would\nimply that the information content of M3 indicators for inflation has only temporarily been\nblurred and that a correction of M3 for the effect of portfolio shifts would restore the indicator\nproperty of M3 for inflation trends.\nThe ECB constructs a measure of M3 corrected for the effect of portfolio shifts based on a\nseasonal reg-ARIMA model \u00ad regression model with seasonal ARIMA errors - of the log-\ntransformed index of adjusted stocks of euro area M3, which captures the portfolio shift\neffects since 2001 by means of intervention variables (ECB, 2005). The portfolio shifts\nrespectively modelled by a linear trend. The gradual unwinding of past portfolio shifts in the\nperiod from mid-2003 to mid-2004 is assumed to proceed linearly at a quarter of the pace\nobserved for the earlier shifts into M3.32 For the stochastic part of the model an ARIMA\nIn order to assess the effect of the estimated portfolio shift effects on the indicator property of\nM3 we analyse the out-of sample forecasting performance of the ECB portfolio shift\ncorrected M3 series. An obvious objection is that the portfolio shift correction of the M3\naggregate is done based on ex-post information and was not available ex-ante, so that the\nforecasting exercise is not a real assessment of the out-of-sample performance of the corrected\nM3 measure. However, analysing the indicator property of the corrected M3 measure is still\nuseful as it gives an indication of whether M3 is in principle still a useful indicator of inflation\nand whether the corrected M3 measure might be of use for the current assessment of future\nrisks to price stability.\n32An alternative approach has been proposed by Greiber and Lemke (2005), who capture the effect of\nportfolio shifts on the demand for M3 by including measures of aggregate risk to an otherwise\nstandard specification of the M3 demand function. They show that including these measures\nsubstantially reduces the estimated monetary overhang at the end of the sample period.\n33 The parenthesis term refers to the specification of the regular part and the bracket term refers to the\nspecification of the seasonal part of the model. The chosen specification states that for both parts a\nspecification with no AR components, first order differencing and a first order moving average was\nchosen.\nTable 7 shows the relative MSEs with respect to the autoregressive forecasts for the bivariate\nforecasting model with portfolio shift corrected M3 indicators. We consider again the\nquarterly growth and the trend M3 growth rate34 as well as recursively calculated M3 demand\nbased indicators, namely the change in p-star (dpstar), the real money gap (mgap) and the\nmonetary overhang (mov). The results suggest that the portfolio shift corrected M3 growth\nindicators deliver for all forecast horizons on average better forecasts than the unadjusted M3\nseries. In fact, the bivariate models for the adjusted M3 growth indicators deliver lower MSE\nratios than all the bivariate models, forecast combinations and trivariate models we have\nconsidered in the previous sections. A look at the forecasting performance of the corrected\nM3 growth indicators over time, shown in Figures 7 and 8, reveal that when M3 is cleansed\nfrom the estimated effects of portfolio shifts, it outperforms the autoregressive forecast also\nover the more recent time period.\nTable 7: Forecasting performance of the portfolio shift corrected M3 series\nDirect forecasting model\nIterated forecasting model\nNote: The table reports the ratio of the mean squared forecast error (MSE) generated by the\nrespective forecasting model to the MSE of the autoregressive forecasting model. An MSE\nratio smaller (larger) than one therefore indicates that the model performs better (worse)\nthan the autoregressive model.\n34 The trend growth rate is again calculated based on a one-sided HP filter using a smoothing\nFigure 7: Portfolio shift corrected quarterly M3 growth forecasts vs autoregressive forecasts\nDirect forecasting model\n1 quarter ahead\n3 quarters ahead\n5 quarters ahead\n7 quarters ahead\n9 quarters ahead\n2 quarters ahead\n4 quarters ahead\n6 quarters ahead\n8 quarters ahead\nIterated forecasting model\n1 quarter ahead\n3 quarters ahead\n5 quarters ahead\n7 quarters ahead\n9 quarters ahead\n2 quarters ahead\n4 quarters ahead\n6 quarters ahead\n8 quarters ahead\nNote: The plots show the absolute forecast error of the bivariate forecasting model with\nportfolio shift adjusted quarterly M3 growth (dotted line) and of the autoregressive\nforecasting model (solid line).\nFigure 8: Portfolio shift corrected trend M3 growth forecasts vs autoregressive forecasts\nDirect forecasting model\n1 quarter ahead\n3 quarters ahead\n5 quarters ahead\n7 quarters ahead\n9 quarters ahead\n2 quarters ahead\n4 quarters ahead\n6 quarters ahead\n8 quarters ahead\nIterated forecasting model\n1 quarter ahead\n3 quarters ahead\n5 quarters ahead\n7 quarters ahead\n9 quarters ahead\n2 quarters ahead\n4 quarters ahead\n6 quarters ahead\n8 quarters ahead\nNote: The plots show the absolute forecast error of the bivariate forecasting model with\nportfolio shift adjusted trend M3 growth (dotted line) and of the autoregressive forecasting\nmodel (solid line).\n6. Conclusions\nThe money pillar of the ECB's monetary policy strategy, which stresses the importance of\nmonetary indicators, in particular of the broad monetary aggregate M3, for medium to long-\nrun risks to price stability, has been subject to intense criticism from the very beginning. The\ncontinued brisk growth of M3 since mid 2001, which did not trigger a tightening of policy\nrates or an acceleration in goods price inflation, appears to support the critics' view and has\ncast doubt on the usefulness of M3 as an indicator of risks to price stability in the euro area.\nIn this paper we assess this issue by testing the performance of monetary indicators in\ncontrast to the existing studies on inflation forecasting for the euro area, this study employs\nand compares both direct and iterated forecasting models. The paper further contributes to the\nliterature by assessing the out-of-sample forecasting performance of trivariate two-pillar\nPhillips Curve type forecasting models, combining trend M3 growth with other non-monetary\nindicators, which have so far only been shown to provide a good in-sample fit of euro area\ninflation dynamics.\nThe results suggest that M3, especially its trend or core growth rate, was over the EMU period\non average a useful indicator for inflation at medium term horizons, which is consistent with\nthe role of the monetary analysis in the ECB's monetary policy strategy as a tool for the\nassessment of the medium to long-term risks to price stability. However, a closer look at the\nforecasting performance reveals that M3 has become less useful as an inflation indicator over\nrecent years. Since 2003, even the on average best performing trend M3 growth indicator\ncannot outperform simple autoregressive forecasting models of inflation. The further analysis\nsuggests, however, that it might be premature to discard monetary indicators on these\ngrounds. In particular, we find that a simple combination of all monetary forecasts performs\nwell also over the more recent period. Also, the extremely good and stable performance of an\nM3 series corrected for the effects of portfolio shifts into and out of M3 since mid 2001\nconstructed by the ECB suggests that M3 is still a very useful indicator for future price\nmovements once the distorting effects of speculative portfolio flows are identified and\nremoved. Taken all together, the answer to the question of whether monetary indicators still\npredict inflation in the euro area is probably yes, but a thorough and broad based monetary\nanalysis appears to be needed to extract the information content of monetary developments\nfor future inflation.\nReferences\nAngelini, E., J.

We compare for each indicator variable the ratio of the MSE\nfrom the direct forecast to that of the iterated forecast. For the bivariate models the results\nsuggest that, on the whole, the iterated forecasting models deliver lower MSEs than the direct\nforecasting models except maybe for the M3 growth based indicators at longer forecasting\nhorizons.35 The results for the trivariate models suggest that the iterated method works better\nfor shorter forecast horizons, while the direct forecasting approach appears to perform better\nat longer horizons. Since the direct and the iterated forecasting models are non-nested for\nforecast horizons 2 to 12 we also performed a test of the statistical significance of the MSE\nratio as we have done for the autoregressive forecasts below following the approach\nsuggested by West (1996), i.e. we calculate the standard error for the MSE ratio based on a\nheteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent (HAC) estimate of the variance-covariance\n(VCV) matrix of the forecast errors using the  -method.36 The results of this test, which we\ndo not report for brevity, reveal that the MSE ratios are never significantly different from\none, implying that the forecasting performance of the direct and iterated models is not\nsignificantly different. 37\n35 Note that, although the specification of the forecasting equation for the inflation rate in the direct\nand the iterated forecasting model are identical, the MSE ratio is not equal to one as has been the case\nin the autoregressive forecasting model because the iterated forecasting model here also comprises a\nforecasting equation for the indicator variable which is estimated jointly with the inflation equation by\nSUR, which also affects the coefficient estimates in the inflation equation.\n36 The HAC estimate of the VCV matrix was obtained using a Bartlett kernel with the number of lags\nequal to the forecast horizon.\n37 The p-values of the tests are available upon request.\nAppendix-Table 1: Bivariate model, direct vs iterated forecasts\nMonetary indicators\nNon-monetary indicators\nNote: The table reports the ratio of the mean squared forecast error (MSE) generated by the\nrespective direct forecasting model to the MSE of the iterated forecasting model.
