Reports of insomnia symptoms are common among the elderly. However, little is known about the relationship\nbetween insomnia symptoms and objective assessments of sleep in the general population of older adults. We assessed concord-\nance between insomnia symptoms and actigraphic sleep characteristics in a nationally representative sample of olderAmericans.\nHealth, and Aging Project, respondents were asked how often they (a) feel rested when they wake up, (b) have trouble falling\nasleep, (c) have trouble with waking up during the night, and (d) have trouble waking up too early and not being able to fall\nasleep again. Responses to these questions were compared to sleep characteristics estimated from three nights of actigraphy\nfor the same individuals. Statistical analyses were adjusted for age, gender, race and ethnicity, income, assets, and education.\nResults. Feelingrested(Question(a),above)wasnotcorrelatedwithanyactigraphy-estimatedsleepcharacteristics.Questions\n(b)\u00ad(d) each had several significant correlations with the actigraphy metrics, but generally not with the specific objective sleep\ncharacteristics that each question intended to reference. In some cases, the associations were not in the expected direction.\nConclusions.Although three of four questions about insomnia symptoms were significantly associated with objec-\ntively estimated sleep characteristics, responses seem to be general indicators of sleep quality rather than reports of\nspecific sleep characteristics.\nKey Words: Epidemiology--Geriatric assessment--Sleep.\nDecision Editor: Stephen Kritchevsky, PhD\nInsomnia is a highly prevalent condition, with an\nestimated 30% of adults having some symptoms and\n6\u00ad10% meeting clinical definitions (1). Insomnia is defined\nand diagnosed on the basis of patient-reported problems.\nWhile clinical definitions differ somewhat between the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and\nInternational Classification of Diseases, and between edi-\ntions, several key components are similar (2). These include\nreported difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep (specifi-\ncally falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up too early)\nand daytime sequelae, including feeling unrested.\nThe diagnostic criteria for insomnia rely on the pres-\nence or absence of a set of symptoms (3). Little is known\nabout the extent to which reports of insomnia symptoms\ncorrespond to objective assessments of sleep. Although a\nfew studies have tried to compare reports of insomnia to\nobjective sleep assessments (4\u00ad7), the majority of them\nmeasure sleep characteristics identified by sleep specialists,\nin a series of patients who sought treatment for insomnia\nor related conditions. These patients are not representative\nof the general population seen in primary care settings or\nreporting such symptoms in surveys. There has been little\nattention to the relationship between insomnia symptom\nreports and objective sleep measures in the general popu-\nlation of older adults. Insomnia is very common among\nolder adults. Prior studies suggested that nearly half of\nolder adults report at least one insomnia symptom (8), and\nthose with medical problems are particularly likely to have\ninsomnia symptoms (9,10). Furthermore, insomnia has\nbeen linked to adverse health outcomes among older adults,\nincluding declines in cognitive function (11\u00ad13), daytime\naddition, insomnia at old ages was associated with greater\nuse of costly health services (19). Understanding the nature\nand correlates of insomnia symptom reports in relation to\nobjective sleep measures in the general population of older\nadults would enhance our knowledge of how to interpret\ninsomnia reports from population-based studies and in clin-\nical practice.\nIn this study, we assessed the concordance between four\nsurvey questions about insomnia symptoms and actigraph-\nestimated sleep characteristics, using a nationally rep-\nresentative sample of community-dwelling older adults.\nSpecifically, we compared each sleep question, as well as\na composite score based on these questions, to several acti-\ngraph-estimated sleep characteristics. Because these ques-\ntions asked respondents to recall specific characteristics of\nsleep, some of which are also estimated through actigraphy,\nwe expected that insomnia symptoms would significantly\ncorrelate with actigraphic sleep characteristics.\nMethods\nNational Social Life, Health, and Aging Project\nThis study used data from participants in the National\nSocial Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP). NSHAP is\na population-based, longitudinal study of health, social life,\nand well-being of older Americans. A nationally representa-\ntive probability sample of 3,005 community-dwelling indi-\nviduals aged 57\u00ad85 was selected from households across the\nU.S. screened in 2004 and the first wave of the survey was\nApproximately one-third of the Wave 2 respondents were\nrandomly invited to participate in an additional \"Activity\nand Sleep Study.\" The design and detailed information on\nthis study has been described previously (20). The activity\nand sleep study had two components: (a) a self-administered\nsleep booklet, which included questions about respondents'\nsleep experience and (b) 72 hours of wrist actigraphy using\nthe Actiwatch Spectrum model from Phillips Respironics.\nThe booklet and Actiwatch were mailed out with a pre-\npaid return mailer a few days after the in-home NSHAP\ninterview. Participants were instructed to wear the Actiwatch\non the nondominant wrist (the one not used for writing) for\nthree full days. Most participants did so but a few individuals\nwore theActiwatch for fewer or more days. In total, 766 indi-\nviduals aged 62\u00ad91 completed the Activity and Sleep Study.\nAfter excluding 39 individuals with no recorded or usable\ndata from the actigraphs, the sleep study yielded a sample\nof 727 individuals with complete data. There were no sys-\ntemic differences in social and demographic characteristics\nbetween the subsample and the NSHAP full sample.As such,\nthe sleep subsample is also nationally representative.\nActigraphy and Actigraph-Estimated Sleep\nCharacteristics\nThe Actiwatch records intensity and frequency of\nmovement with a piezoelectric linear accelerometer in\nepochs (15-second epochs were selected for this study).\nThe Actiwatch continually registers wrist movements,\nand the sum of all wrist movements during each epoch\nis saved as an activity score. These data were analyzed\nusing manufacturer-developedActiware software (version\n5.59). In this study, we focused on nine actigraph-derived\nsleep parameters, capturing three aspects of older adults'\nsleep characteristics: duration, timing, and consolidation.\nThe duration variables are sleep period (the total amount\nof time between when an individual first falls asleep and\nlast awakens) and total sleep time (the total duration of\nall of the epochs scored as sleep during the sleep period).\nThe timing variables are the clock time falling asleep\n(first epoch recorded as sleep) and clock wake up time\n(last epoch recorded as sleep). The consolidation vari-\nables are percent sleep (the percent of the sleep period\nscored as actual sleep), wake after sleep onset (or WASO,\nthe minutes awake during the sleep period), number of\nwake bouts during the sleep period, sleep fragmentation\n(21) (an index of sleep disruption that is the sum of two\npercentages: the percentage of the sleep period spent\nmoving and the percentage of immobile periods only 1\nminute long, and latency (the amount of time it takes an\nindividual to fall asleep initially after she or he begins\nto try falling asleep). Latency was only estimated for the\nsubset of nights when participants remembered to press\nthe event marker when they began trying to fall asleep,\nas instructed.\nAll actigraph-estimated measures except latency are\nthree-night averages. For the 53 individuals (<7% of the\ntotal sample) with fewer than three nights of data, we aver-\naged all available nights. Weekdays and weekends acti-\ngraph-estimated sleep characteristics were similar in this\nmostly retired population.\nInsomnia Questions\nThe NSHAP core survey included a restorative sleep\nquestion asking \"How often do you feel really rested when\nyou wake up in the morning?\" The sleep booklet included\nthree additional questions related to initiating and maintain-\ning sleep: \"How often do you have trouble falling asleep?\";\n\"How often do you have trouble with waking up during the\nnight?\"; and \"How often do you have trouble with wak-\ning up too early and not being able to fall asleep again?\"\nResponse categories for all four questions were: most of the\ntime = 2, sometimes = 1, and rarely/never = 0.\nIn addition to examining each of these questions sepa-\nrately, we constructed an insomnia symptom scale (total\nscore ranging from 0 to 8) by reverse-coding the feel-\ning rested question and then summing all four items.\nExploratory factor analysis showed that these four items\nloaded into a single factor and the reliability of the scale is\nwithin the acceptable range ( = 0.65).\nExpected Relationships between Actigraph-Estimated\nSLEEP and Insomnia Symptoms\nBased on the insomnia questions and the definition of\nactigraphic sleep characteristics, we expected that individu-\nals who reported feeling rested in the morning would have\nmore total sleep time, higher percent sleep, less WASO,\nfewer wake bouts, and a lower sleep fragmentation score.\nFor trouble falling asleep, we expected a positive associa-\ntion with earlier clock time falling asleep (as individuals\nwith insomnia commonly get into bed too early) and longer\nlatency. We expected that trouble waking up during the night\nwould be inversely correlated with percent sleep and would\npositively correlate with WASO and number of wake bouts.\nFinally, we expected that individuals who reported waking\nup too early would have less total sleep time and an earlier\nwake up time.\nStatistical Analyses\nIn our statistical analyses, the aforementioned insom-\nnia questions and insomnia symptom scale were out-\ncome variables of the statistical analyses and actigraphic\nparameters were predictors. We used ordered logistic\nregression to assess associations between each insomnia\nsymptom question and each actigraph-estimated sleep\nparameter, controlling for age, age squared, gender, race/\nethnicity, education, household income, and household\nassets. Although ordinal logistic regression is easy to fit\nand makes interpretation of the results straightforward, it\nassumes that the associations of the independent variables\nwith each one-unit change in the dependent responses are\nthe same (ie the proportional odds assumption). To ensure\nordered logistic regression was a valid approach, we tested\nthe proportional odds assumption. For a few models where\nthe proportional odds assumption was violated, we used\nthe partial proportional odds model, which models each\none-category change in the dependent variable separately\n(22). When the insomnia symptom scale was the outcome\nvariable, we used ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions\nand we used multiple imputation to recover missing values\namong control variables (23).\nWhen latency was the key explanatory variable, we per-\nformed the analysis using a subsample of actigraphy data\nwith nonmissing start-event markers because the estimate\nof latency is imprecise when the start event marker is miss-\ning. This ensures that our analysis was based on the best\navailable estimate of latency. The sample size for these\nanalyses was 627. All analyses took into account the study\ndesign and survey weights using Stata 12 (24).\nTable 1.

As\nthe table shows, about 13% of older adults said that they\nrarely or never feel rested when waking up in the morning,\n12% reported having trouble falling asleep most of the time,\n30% indicated they had problems with waking up during\nthe night most of the time, and 13% reported problems with\nwaking up too early and not being able to fall asleep again\nmost of the time.\nWith respect to actigraph-estimated sleep characteristics,\nthe average duration of sleep period was 7.9 hours and the\naverage total sleep time was 7.25 hours. The mean percent\nsleep was 82%, the mean sleep fragmentation index was\n14%, mean WASO was 39 minutes, and the mean number\nof wake bouts was 46. The average clock time falling asleep\nof older adults averaged 10:27 pm and their average wake-\nMean Actigraph-Estimated Sleep Characteristics by\nInsomnia Symptoms\nTable 2 shows mean actigraphic sleep characteristics by\nthe three response levels for each of the insomnia questions\nand for tertiles of the insomnia symptom scale. We tested\nfor differences in actigraphic sleep characteristics for each\nquality question using a rank-based nonparametric test of\ntrend (25). This test allowed for examining whether acti-\ngraphic sleep characteristics systematically increase or\ndecrease over the frequencies of insomnia symptoms.\nFor the \"feeling rested\" question, we found no significant\nrelationships to any of the actigraphic outcomes.\nFor the \"trouble falling asleep\" question, we expected\nassociations with latency and perhaps earlier clock time\nfalling asleep. We did not find a significant relationship with\nlatency, and the relationship to clock time falling asleep was\nweak (p = 0.06) and in the unexpected direction. Instead,\nwe observed that trouble falling asleep was associated with\nincreasing sleep period, later wake up time, lower percent\nsleep, longer WASO, and more wake bouts.\nFor the \"trouble waking up during the night\" question,\nwe observed significant relationships with longer WASO\nand lower percent sleep, as expected. However, we did\nnot observe a relationship with number of wake bouts. In\naddition, we also observed trends in longer total sleep time\nand shorter latency with greater trouble waking up during\nthe night.\nFor the last question, \"trouble waking up too early,\"\nwe would expect earlier clock wake up time and perhaps\nshorter total sleep time. There were significant associa-\ntions with both earlier clock time falling asleep and ear-\nlier wake up time, as well as shorter latency. However,\nwe did not observe a trend in total sleep time, indicating\nthat sleep was phase shifted to earlier in the day. Finally,\nhigher scores on the insomnia symptom scale were related\nto longer wake after sleep onset and decreasing percent\nsleep as expected, but also with increases in sleep period\nand total sleep time.\nAdjusted Models of Insomnia Symptoms and\nActigraphic-Estimated Sleep Characteristics\nTable 3 summarizes the results from ordered lo\ngistic\nregression models and OLS regression models using\nactigraph-estimated sleep characteristics to predict\nolder adults' responses to the four survey questions\nand the insomnia symptom scale controlling for age,\nage squared, gender, race/ethnicity, education, income,\nand assets. Adjustment for these characteristics had lit-\ntle effect on the associations previously observed in\nTable 2. The three survey questions with the most signifi-\ncant associations with the actigraph-estimated sleep char-\nacteristics were trouble falling asleep, trouble with waking\nup during the night, and trouble with waking up too early.\nTrouble waking up too early was significantly associated\nwith earlier wake up time, but also with earlier bedtime\nand shorter latency. Reports of waking up during the night\nwere associated with lower percent sleep, longer WASO,\nand longer sleep period and total sleep time. Waking up\ntoo early was associated with earlier clock time falling\nasleep and earlier wake up time. Both longer sleep period\nand longer WASO were positively correlated with insom-\nnia symptom scale. Percent sleep was negatively associ-\nated with the scale. We found no evidence (results not\nshown) that the associations between actigraph-estimated\nsleep characteristics and insomnia symptoms differed sys-\ntematically by gender.\nThere were a few cases where the proportional odds\nassumption did not hold (data not shown). Although Table 3\nsuggests that there was no association between waking up\ntoo early and sleep duration variables, the partial propor-\ntional odds model showed that both sleep period and total\nsleep time were associated with waking up too early from\n\"sometimes\" to \"most of the time.\" These results suggest\nthat sleep duration variables have stronger effects on fre-\nquent sleep complaints but not occasional sleep distur-\nbances. We also performed sensitivity analyses excluding\nparticipants with fewer than three nights of actigraphy data.\nThere were 53 individuals with fewer than three nights of\ndata (44 individuals had 2 nights and 9 one night). Results\nwere very similar. We also stratified the sample by three age\nif the relationships between self-report insomnia symptoms\nand actigraphic measures vary. Although patterns were\nsimilar across age groups, many of the associations of the\nsecond and third age groups were nonsignificant which in\npart might due to the relative small sample size of the last\ntwo groups. Finally, we tested the role of cognitive abil-\nity in affecting the reported-actigraphic relationships by\ncontrolling for scores of cognitive assessment and interac-\ntions between cognitive scores and actigraphic measures.\nMost of the interaction terms were nonsignificant. Thus,\nthere was no strong evidence that the observed relationships\nbetween self-report sleep experience and actigraphic meas-\nures varied systematically by cognitive scores.\nDiscussion\nThis study compared survey reports of insomnia symp-\ntoms collected in the context of a general survey to objec-\ntively estimated sleep characteristics in a large nationally\nrepresentative study population of older adults, focusing\non four survey questions that measure key components of\nTable 2.

Actigraphic sleep characteristic was only significantly associated with insomnia symptom\nfrom \"sometimes\" to \"most of the time\".\nclinical definitions of insomnia. These questions have also\nbeen included in many general health surveys. Researchers\nhave found that responses to these questions correlate with\nand predict other aspects of health, but there has been rela-\ntively little attention paid to their relation to objective meas-\nures of sleep in a nonclinical population.\nAlthough we found significant associations between the\nthree questions tapping into initiating sleep and maintain-\ning sleep and several actigraphic-estimated sleep character-\nistics, some associations were not specific to the aspect of\nsleep queried. For example, while reports of trouble falling\nasleep would logically be linked to long latency, we did not\nfind a statistically significant association between the two.\nInstead, reported trouble falling asleep significantly corre-\nlated with more WASO and an increased number of wake\nbouts. These associations suggest that the reports of trouble\nfalling asleep may also relate to trouble staying asleep dur-\ning the night and a longer sleep period. The finding that\nawaking too early was not only associated with earlier wake\ntime but also earlier clock time falling asleep and shorter\nlatency similarly suggests that this question may tap into a\ncircadian phase advance that affects both bedtime and wak-\ning time (26). Older adults may complain of waking up too\nearly despite accumulating substantial hours of sleep. The\nfinding that respondents who reported waking up more fre-\nquently during the night had more total sleep time is also\nunexpected. These associations may be a consequence of\npoorer health, as longer sleep duration and poorer sleep\nquality may be both markers of illness at older ages (27).\nLastly, feeling rested was not systematically related to\nany actigraphic measures. This is consistent with prior stud-\nies suggesting that global ratings of sleep are unlikely to\nrelate to single physiological sleep measures in a consistent\nmanner (28). It is also possible that feeling rested corre-\nlates with other objective sleep outcomes that are not meas-\nured by actigraphy, such as amount of slow-wave sleep or\nabsence of sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea.\nHowever, polysomnography studies have reported no cor-\nrelation between feeling rested and sleep characteristics in\na clinical adult sample (29), which suggests that a ques-\ntion about feeling rested may tap into other aspects of older\nadults' everyday health or psychological experience. Taken\ntogether, these unexpected findings suggest that answers to\nthese survey questions are not shaped solely by objective\nsleep characteristics. Instead, they may reflect older adults'\nsubjective evaluation of overall sleep experience as well as\nother dimensions of health and wellbeing.\nSeveral large population-based studies of older\nadults, including the Established Populations for the\nEpidemiological Study of the Elderly and the Health and\nRetirement Study, have included these survey questions\nabout sleep problems, which tap into the definition of insom-\nnia. Data from these questions have been used to investigate\nhypotheses related to sleep problems and insomnia among\nreports of what seem like specific sleep problems from sur-\nvey questions may be more accurately viewed as indicators\nof general problems or dissatisfaction with sleep that may be\ndue to complex environmental, physiologic, psychological,\nand social processes. These survey questions and actigraphy\nmay measures different domains of sleep experience.\nWe acknowledge several limitations. First, we only had\nthree nights of actigraphy data, which may not fully cap-\nture the within-subject variability of sleep behavior in older\nadults.Wedidnotaskwhetherthesethreenightsweretypical\nof the individual's sleep schedule or quality. However, our\nlarge sample compensates for the greater noise in our data\ncompared to longer observation periods, and the three-night\nobservation introduces no systematic bias in our estimates\nas population-level sleep characteristics were very similar\nbased on the full sample and the sample that excluded par-\nticipants with fewer than three nights of data. Second, actig-\nraphy provides good estimates but not perfect measures\nof sleep. However, there is no perfect measure. Although\npolysomnography is often consider as the gold standard in\nsleep research, it has a very limited role in the current clini-\ncal practice and evaluation of patients with insomnia (34).\nFurthermore, it may interrupt normal sleep behaviors and\nthus overestimate the sleep problems of insomnia patients.\nSeveral clinical studies comparing sleep estimates from\nactigraphy and polymnography suggested that actigraphy\nmay modestly overestimate insomnia patients' sleep time\nand underestimate wake time by scoring motionless peri-\nods in bed as sleep (35\u00ad37). Accordingly, actigraphy may\nunderestimate the differences in sleep duration, percent\nsleep, WASO, wake bouts, and latency among older adults\nwith and without insomnia. However, this would give us\nconservative estimates of the correlations between insom-\nnia report and actigraphic measures, and yet we found many\nsignificant associations. Third, we cannot exclude the pos-\nsibility that the absence of association between latency and\ntrouble falling asleep could be due to imprecisely pushing\nthe event marker. However, the mean latency (e.g., 29 min)\nin our sample was not substantially different from other stud-\nies (38). Fourth, there is no specific timeframe for insomnia\nquestions. For clinical diagnosis of insomnia, symptoms\nmust persist for 6 months. As such, these questions are best\nviewed as screening tools for insomnia symptoms for the\ngeneral population of older adults rather than diagnostic. It\nis also possible that the limitation in survey questions led\nto weaker correlations between self-report and actigraphic\nsleep measures than expected. Fifth, the Sleep Booklet did\nnot ask questions about diagnosis of sleep apnea. As such,\nwe were not able to adjust it in our analysis. However, we\nperformed a sensitivity analysis by stratifying the sample\ninto a \"higher-risk apnea\" group (rarely or never, N = 81)\nand a \"lower-risk apnea\" group (most of the time and some-\ntimes, N = 646) based on answers of the feeling rested ques-\ntion and comparing the reported-actigraphic relationship in\nthese two groups. As individuals with apnea would be very\nlikely to answer \"rarely\" or \"never\" to this question, this\nsensitivity can provide additional insights on the potential\ninfluence of sleep apnea on the reported-actigraphic rela-\ntionship. Our results from these two groups were similar\nalthough many of the coefficients from the \"higher-risk\napnea\" group were nonsignificant because of the very small\nsample size of the \"higher-risk apnea\" group. Thus, results\nfrom this sensitive analysis offer some suggestive evidence\nthat sleep apnea may not be an influential factor in shaping\nreported-actigraphic relationship. Finally, individuals may\nanswer these survey questions differently than they might\nanswer similar questions in a clinical encounter.\nIn sum, our findings suggest that three of four insomnia\nsymptom reports correlated with estimates of sleep charac-\nteristics of older adults based on actigraphic measures but\noften not to the objective features that seemed to be indexed\nby these questions. We conclude that insomnia symptom\nreports among older adults may act as more general indica-\ntors of sleep satisfaction that tap into various dimensions of\nsleep and perhaps also other aspects of health.\nFunding\nInstitute of Aging (NIA), the Basic Behavioral and Social Sciences\nResearch Opportunity Network (OppNet) National Institutes of Health,\n01 for \"NSHAP Wave II Partner Data Collection\" from the NIA, and\nNORC & University of Chicago from the NIA.
