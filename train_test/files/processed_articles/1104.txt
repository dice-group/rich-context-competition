In the\nother study, Collins et al20 found that viewing more sexual\ncontent on television was associated with an increased\n1-year risk of sexual initiation.\nWe performed a secondary analysis of longitudinal data\nfrom a large nationally representative sample of adoles-\ncents to determine whether self-reported hours of tele-\nvision viewed was associated with initiation of sexual in-\ntercourse in young adolescents (aged 16 years) during\nthe subsequent year. We also studied whether parental\nregulation of television programming was associated with\nrisk of initiation. We hypothesized that adolescents would\nbe more likely to initiate intercourse within 1 year if they\n(1) watched more television or (2) lacked a parental rule\nabout television programming.\nMETHODS\nSAMPLE\nWe used data from waves 1 and 2 of the National Longitudinal\nStudy of Adolescent Health (Add Health).22 The sampling frame\nwas all high schools in the United States that had an 11th grade\nand at least 30 students. A systematic, random sample of 80\nhigh schools and 52 associated feeder schools from across the\nUnited States was then selected, stratified according to region,\nurbanicity, school type, ethnic composition, and school size.\nSubjects were weighted on the basis of the complex sampling\ndesign to establish a representative cohort of all 7th through\nof the original in-school sample were randomly selected for in-\nhome interviews, conducted in 1995, which included ques-\ntions about more sensitive health behaviors. Of these, 16 706\nwere selected for a second interview approximately 1 year later,\nand 13 568 completed the interview and received a weight. Me-\ndian interval between baseline and follow-up interviews was\nwho were younger than 16 years at baseline interview and com-\npleted 2 interviews (n=7063) were included in our study if they\nreported at baseline interview that they had never had sexual\nintercourse (n=5518), if they provided information about the\nprimary exposure of interest (hours of television per week,\ncause of small sample sizes of other races/ethnicities, we fur-\nther restricted our analysis to subjects who reported their race/\nethnicity as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, or Hispanic\nMEASURES\nExposure Variables\nHours of television watched per day at baseline interview was\nthe primary exposure of interest and was calculated from self-\nreported hours (0-99) of television watched per week. We chose\nto categorize television use as low (2 h/d) or high (2 h/d).\nA cutoff of 2 h/d was selected to correspond to the American\nAcademy of Pediatrics24 recommended limit for children's tele-\nvision exposure. Two hours per day was also the median daily\ntelevision exposure for subjects in our sample. In our final mod-\nels, we explored television hours parameterized as a continu-\nous variable and used an alternate categorization scheme to look\nfor a dose-response effect by using the following categories of\nhours of television watched: 0 to less than the 25th percentile,\npercentile, 75th to less than the 90th percentile, and 90th per-\ncentile or greater.\nParental monitoring was a secondary exposure of interest.\nAt baseline interview, subjects were asked if their parents al-\nlow them to make their own decisions about which television\nprograms they watch. We refer to adolescents as having a con-\ntent rule if they answered no to this question. Subjects were also\nasked if they made their own decisions about how much tele-\nvision they watch, but we excluded this amount rule variable\nfrom our final models because of the concern that it may be\nhighly correlated with hours of television viewed.\nOutcome Variable\nInitiation of sexual intercourse (defined as penile-vaginal in-\ntercourse) was the primary outcome of interest and was re-\nported (yes/no) at follow-up interview. Answers to this and other\nsensitive questions were obtained by using a confidential com-\nputer-assisted self-interviewing system and were entered into\na laptop computer.\nCovariates\nSociodemographic variables included in this analysis were age\n(years/months) at baseline interview, sex, race/ethnicity, and\nmaternal education. Race/ethnicity was self-reported and cat-\negorized as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, or His-\npanic. Maternal education was reported by the resident mother\nor mother figure for most subjects or, otherwise, by the sub-\nject; responses were classified as less than high school, high\nschool graduate, more than high school, or college or more.\nParental presence was assessed by asking each respondent how\nfrequently his/her mother or father was present before school,\nafter school, and at bedtime. We created a dichotomous vari-\nable that defined decreased parental presence at home as occur-\nring when a parent was sometimes, almost never, or never pres-\nent at any of these times. Perceived parental tolerance of\nintercourse was measured by asking subjects at baseline inter-\nview if mother and/or father would approve of them having sex\nat this time of life. If subjects reported anything other than strong\ndisapproval they were placed in the category of does not per-\nceive strong parental disapproval of sex. Depression was as-\nsessed using the sum of responses to 19 items selected from\nthe Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, which\nmeasures depressive symptoms in the community and has been\nvalidated in junior and senior high school students.25,26 Higher\nscores indicated more depressive symptoms. For the purposes\nof our study, we defined depression as scoring in the top quar-\ntile on this scale. Self-esteem was assessed by summing 6 of 10\nitems modified from the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Inventory, which\nhas good reliability (Cronbach =.86).7 We defined low self-\nesteem as a score below the median. Subjects were asked to as-\nsess the importance of religion by using a 5-point scale. We re-\ncoded these answers and created a dichotomous variable that\nclassified as less religious all who did not respond that religion\nwas very important. Educational aspirations were measured with\na question asking subjects to rank on a scale of 1 to 5 how likely\nit is that they will go to college. We recoded answers dichoto-\nmously and placed subjects who did not answer highly likely\nin the category of less likely to attend college. Other potential\ncovariates that were explored in the univariate analyses but ex-\ncluded from multivariate models were taking a virginity pledge\n(yes/no), intelligence as measured by means of the Add Health\nPicture Vocabulary Test, and pubertal status.\n\u00a92006 American Medical Association.

Preliminary analysis demonstrated that this rela-\ntionship varied according to parental attitude toward adoles-\ncent engagement in sexual intercourse; therefore, we stratified\nsubsequent analyses according to this variable. We chose to in-\nclude only covariates that appeared to be related to primary ex-\nposure and outcome in univariate analysis or that had been in-\ncluded in previous literature on this subject.

We also found that lack of parental regu-\nlation of television programming was associated with\nincreased 1-year risk of sexual initiation in these adoles-\ncents. The magnitude of these associations remained con-\nstant after controlling for multiple potential confound-\ners. Although we failed to find any statistically significant\ninteraction between the amount of television watched and\nparental regulation of content, we found that among sub-\njects who reported strong parental disapproval of sex, the\nrate of initiation was highest among those who watched\ntelevision 2 or more hours per day and had no content\nrule and that the risk of sexual initiation was approxi-\nmately twice that observed in subjects who watched less\ntelevision and reported a content rule.\nOur finding that hours of television viewed is associ-\nated with 1-year sexual initiation differs somewhat from\nresults of the 2 other longitudinal studies available on\nthis subject.20,21 Peterson et al21 found a positive, but in-\nconsistent, relationship between hours of television\nwatched and sexual initiation for boys; however, this study\nwas based on television viewing data from the 1970s,\nwhich may not reflect more recent programming.

All rights reserved.\nlins et al20 reported that the amount of sexual content\nviewed, but not hours of television watched, was a sig-\nnificant risk factor for sexual initiation. This finding was\nbased on a multivariate model that, by design, retained\nseparate variables for amount of television watched and\namount of sexual content watched.20 Because we did not\nhave any data available on the sexual content of pro-\ngrams watched by the subjects in our study, it is difficult\nto compare our results directly with those of Collins et al.20\nPrevious research results showed that adolescent per-\nception of parental attitude toward sex is related to sexual\ninitiation.28,29 On the basis of our results, we hypoth-\nesize that for adolescents who do not perceive strong pa-\nrental disapproval of sex and are already at higher risk\nfor sexual initiation, television may not have affected their\nbehavior. However, for adolescents who perceive strong\nparental disapproval of sex and are at lower risk for sexual\ninitiation, contradictory messages, such as those seen on\ntelevision, may be more influential.\nAlthough results of our study and those of Collins et\nal20 provide evidence that television watching increases\nthe risk of sexual initiation by adolescents, neither study's\nresults resolve the question of whether attempting to con-\ntrol content or limit amount of television watched would\nbe most likely to reduce this risk. Limiting amount of tele-\nvision may be easier and more effective than limiting con-\ntent, given the pervasiveness of sexual content in televi-\nsion programming.18 In addition, unlike limiting content,\nlimiting the amount of television children watch may have\ncollateral benefits such as prevention of obesity30 and re-\nduction in aggressive behavior.31\nWe found that adolescents in the top 10th percentile\nof television viewing (5 h/d) were not at increased risk\nof sexual initiation. This result provides support for a theo-\nretical babysitter effect20 or displacement effect in which\ncertain adolescents may spend extraordinary amounts of\ntime viewing television and are therefore less likely to\nparticipate in other activities or to initiate sexual activ-\nity. Failure to account for such an effect may distort at-\ntempts to understand the true effect of increased televi-\nsion watching, especially if amount of television is\nmodeled as a continuous variable.\nWe found that lack of a content rule was associated\nwith 1-year sexual initiation only among adolescents who\nreported strong parental disapproval of sex, a result re-\nlated to that of Peterson et al,21 who found that coview-\ning television and discussing television with parents were\nrelated to decreased sexual initiation in certain adoles-\ncents. These results support the hypothesis that paren-\ntal regulation of television viewing may affect television-\nrelated outcomes in some adolescents.\nEffects of parental regulation have been studied pre-\nviously. Although results of some studies showed that\ncertain types of regulation are associated with differ-\nences in television-related behavior,32-34 additional re-\nsearch is needed to understand whether mediation of tele-\nvision use by parents might influence television-related\nsexual behavior.\nStrengths of this study include use of a data set that is\nlongitudinal, provides a nationally representative sample,\nand has good measures of individual and family charac-\nteristics that are important control variables. Using lon-\ngitudinal data eliminates the potential for reverse cau-\nsality, a possible problem in cross-sectional studies.35,36\nThe generalizability of our study results is strengthened\nby the comparability of mean hours of television watched\nin our sample to that in other large nationally represen-\nOur study has several limitations. First, the available\nmeasure of television exposure, a self-reported global es-\ntimate, was crude and may be less accurate than a view-\ning diary or other format that includes more than 1 mea-\nsure across time. We recommend that future surveys\ndesigned to explore determinants of adolescent health in-\nclude more extensive questions to establish the quan-\ntity and quality of adolescent exposure to multiple types\nof media. Second, although we adjusted for many poten-\ntial confounders, our results still may be subject to re-\nsidual confounding due to unmeasured social or envi-\nronmental factors. In particular, rules about television\ncontent may be a proxy measure for parental willing-\nness to monitor other behaviors that may be associated\nwith the risk of sexual initiation. Third, available data\nprovided no direct measure of the content of television\nprogramming watched. Although this is an important limi-\ntation given the diversity of programming that different\nadolescents are likely to select, it is still reasonable to as-\nsume that those who watch more television will see more\nsexual content given the high level of sexual content in\nshows that adolescents watch. Fourth, our outcome mea-\nsure was limited to sexual intercourse defined as vaginal/\npenile intercourse, and we had no information on oral\nsex or other types of sexual behavior that are increas-\ningly prevalent among teens. Future surveys should in-\nclude questions about other types of sexual behavior. Fifth,\nbecause we excluded those who had already initiated in-\ntercourse, we necessarily selected for subjects who were\nslightly younger, included somewhat more female and\nwhite subjects, included fewer black subjects, and had a\nhigher maternal educational status (data not shown). Fi-\nnally, the data used for the study were almost 10 years\nold, and the sexual content of television programming\nhas changed over that time.18 In addition, as adolescents\nhave increasing sources of media available to them, such\nas the Internet, the amount of television they watch and\nits role in their lives may be changing.19\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that\nchildren and adolescents view television no more than\n2 hours each day and that parents take an active role in\nguiding television use.24,37 Although there is limited evi-\ndence about the effectiveness of these recommenda-\ntions, our results suggest that successful implementa-\ntion of these guidelines may diminish the risk of early\nsexual initiation by young adolescents. Further re-\nsearch is needed to understand how families might ef-\nfectively minimize the potential harms to children and\nadolescents associated with television exposure, whether\nby limiting total amount of television watched or by lim-\niting access to specific types of programming. Interven-\ntions, including clinic-based interventions, designed to\nalter television use and improve parental mediation of\ntelevision use should continue to be developed and tested\nto determine if they are feasible and effective in chang-\ning television use and its behavioral effects.\n\u00a92006 American Medical Association.
