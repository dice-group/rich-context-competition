HIP combines these dia-\nmetrically opposed themes by promoting personal responsibility while providing sub-\nsidized health protection to those who can least afford it.1\nWhat should be made of this? Personal responsibility to oneself and one's\nneighbours arguably belongs to some kind of `ethic' rather than to a mere rugged\nindividualism. But an ethic that emphasizes personal responsibility is, she believes,\n`diametrically opposed' to a `Judaeo-Christian' ethic that privileges concern for\nthose `who can least afford' health protection.\nIs this how a Christian ethic, at least, should conceive of personal responsibility\nin healthcare? The parable of the good Samaritan might give some support to this.\nThe `one who had mercy/compassion upon' the injured man is commended but this\nkey parable raises no question of whether the injured man was irresponsible\nin taking the Jericho road, putting himself in harm's way. This is hardly an\nendorsement of an ethic of patients' personal responsibility but rather of taking\nresponsibility for others' well-being. So perhaps Verma is both right and wrong on\nwhat Christian wisdom offers to US healthcare.\nFocusing on responsibility presses the question of how disease should be\nconceived. Is disease, its prevention and its cure, in any sense rightly conceived\nas the patient's responsibility? If so, does this in some way reformulate what com-\npassion means in everyday clinician practice and patient experience, whether in the\nUSA or the NHS?\nResponsibility in healthcare\nQuestions of responsibility characterize the collaborative relationships between\npatients and healthcare staff which have largely replaced paternalist attitudes.\nPatient choice, values and beliefs are central. In shared decision-making (SDM),\n`clinicians and patients make decisions together using the best available\nevidence . . . [and] patients are encouraged to think about the available screening,\ntreatment, or management options and the likely benefits and harms of each'.2\nSuch SDM requires `collaborative deliberation', rooted in a relational notion of\nautonomy `where the two (or sometimes more) parties ``dance together'', figuring\nout who leads, and in what direction'. Collaborative deliberation `requires that\nclinicians are curious about and respectful of patients' informed preferences, recog-\nnizing that this process should incorporate insight about emotions, gut feelings,\nand biases'.3 It thus `serves as an underpinning framework for empathic clinical\npractice'.4\nBut `informing and exploring preferences is not enough'.5 SDM should involve\n`an existential journey aimed at fostering patient autonomy with the curating help\nof physicians who are attentive to patients' informational, emotional, and rela-\ntional needs'. This relational autonomy aims to avoid both paternalism and aban-\ndonment to `bear the burden of self-blame if things go poorly'.6\nFor collaborative deliberation might over-correct paternalism to thrust\nunwanted responsibility onto highly vulnerable people. Disease then transforms\ninto the occasion of becoming a `health-care sinner' because of poor past behaviour\nand ill-judged choices for future treatment, adding burdens of guilt and worry on\ntop of the disease itself.\nThinking about compassion helps to illuminate what is pernicious and what is\nbeneficial about personal responsibility for health. Compassion is almost univer-\nsally commended as basic to healthcare. But what one thinks about responsibility\nin healthcare will shape the compassion one espouses. Understanding compassion\nin relation to responsibility will enable an at least partial diagnosis of how disease is\nconceived both by the one experiencing the disease and by other parties. Is it\ncompatible with compassion to conceive of someone's disease as a consequence\nand embodiment of past faults and poor decisions?\nCompassion in two traditions\nTwo classic traditions yield two ideas of compassion: eleos and misericordia.\nContrasting them sheds light on how responsibility and disease should be associated.7\nCompassion-eleos\nCompassion-eleos in Aristotle and in Greek tragedy provide useful counterpoints\nto the Christian traditions considered below. For Aristotle's eleos ( feoB; often\ntranslated as `pity'), desert is central:\nPity may be defined as a feeling of pain caused by the sight of some evil, destructive or\npainful, which befalls one who does not deserve it, and which we might expect to\nbefall ourselves or some friend of ours, and moreover to befall us soon.8\nThose who deserve their bad condition \u00ad including those causally responsible for\ntheir bad condition \u00ad are unworthy of `pity'. They may be dubbed the `undeserving\nsick' \u00ad their sickness is so identified with their just deserts that they are undeserving\nof eleos.\nThis bracing option seems frankly nai\u00a8ve about distinguishing different causes of\ndisease. Martha Nussbaum nuances Aristotle's account through narratives con-\ncerning desert `in Homeric and tragic appeals for compassion'.9 She recounts\nhow Philoctetes, an expert archer, en route to the Trojan War, trespasses on a\nsanctuary. The gods punish him with a snakebite which develops into a painful,\npus-filled and smelly leg-wound. Being thus generally unpleasant as a companion,\nhe is abandoned by the Greeks on an island for ten years. However, realizing they\ncannot defeat the Trojans without him, the Greeks return to pick him up. After\nvarious treacherous twists, Neoptolemos, conflicted about Philoctetes' abuse and\nsuffering, resolves to help him.\nNussbaum's nuance is that it is\nnot inconsistent with [Aristotle's] account to have compassion for people for things\nthey do out of their own bad character or culpable negligence \u00ad so long as one can\neither see the suffering as out of all proportion to the fault or view the bad character or\nnegligence as itself the product of forces to some extent excusably beyond the person's\nMoreover, in a passage oddly neglected by Nussbaum, Philoctetes bitterly rejects\nthe assistance offered. And so Neoptolemos addresses him thus:\nMen must bear the fortune given them by the gods. But those who are set upon by\ndamage that is of their own doing, such as yourself, it is just neither to have sympathy\nfor them, nor to pity them. You have become an animal, and refuse all advice: if\nsomeone, thinking on your behalf, does give advice, you hate him, you consider him\nIn collaborative deliberation, such eleos would entail compassion for misfortune\nbut not for patients who reject help, making their condition worse. The unjustly\ntreated if `undeserving sick' receive compassion; but not the apparently subhuman\nand `obstinate sick'.\nIn summary, there is some discretion for how compassion relates to responsi-\nbility and desert. Compassion-eleos is `a painful emotion occasioned by the aware-\nness of another person's undeserved misfortune'.12 Those responsible for their\nsuffering \u00ad those who have `brought it on themselves' \u00ad are not deserving of com-\npassion-eleos although certain factors may mitigate this. In particular, compassion-\neleos is not appropriate to those who reject help to address their current suffering or\nto prevent future suffering.\nCompassion-misericordia\nAquinas interprets the eleos Jesus commends and the inner, bowel-level response of\nthe Samaritan to the injured man (e\n\\ spagni\nsyZ, esplanchnisth\ne) in terms of\nmisericordia.13 Developing but qualifying some of Aristotle's insights and building\non Augustine, he writes that:\n. . .mercy is heartfelt compassion for another's misery, a compassion which drives us to do\nwhat we can to help him. Indeed the Latin word for mercy, Misericordia, comes from\none's heart being miserable (miserum cor), at the sight of another's distress. Now\nmisery is the opposite of happiness. But it is of the essence of beatitude or happiness\nthat a man gets what he wants: Happy the man, says Augustine, who has everything he\nwants and wants nothing that is evil. Hence misery, on the other hand, implies that a\nman suffers against his will.14\nAquinas is thinking through how virtues proper to human life relate to joy and the\nhope of a stable, loving friendship with God. Happiness is not simply getting what\nyou want but wanting that which is good \u00ad that is, friendship with God \u00ad and getting\nit. So how are compassion and responsibility interrelated? Aquinas argues that:\n. . .there is a sense in which fault itself is punishment, in so far that there goes together\nwith it, something against the will of the sinner, and in this way it can be considered\ndeserving of mercy. . .15\n. . .mercy is a kind of sadness. Now the reason for sadness is always some weakness;\nthat is why. . .sick people become sad more easily than others. It follows that the\nreason why one person has mercy on another is because he himself suffers some\nThe reason given elsewhere for this claimed propensity to sadness among the sick is\nthat harms suffered by those already sick are felt more grievously.17 Thus Aquinas\nclaims that the conditions people experience on account of their faults are suffering\nenough: something is happening against their will to be happy (even if, as Aquinas\nallows, happiness is not conceived as friendship with God). This thwarting of the\nwill is, he thinks, punishment enough for any fault which has contributed to their\ncondition.\nMercy or misericordia emerges as sadness which arises because of weakness:\nweakness, generally speaking, in the one exercising misericordia just as much as\nthe one receiving it; weakness, specifically, in the form of disease, which may or\nmay not be linked to some specifically moral weakness. The conception is not of the\nundeserving or obstinate sick but rather of the `sad sick'. But to talk of the sad sick\nis not necessarily to dismiss issues of responsibility regarding any sin which engen-\nders sickness and sadness.\nAn experienced hospital chaplain comments that\n. . .the relationship between a person's way of life, sin and disease in many cases is\nobvious and often lurks in the background of conversation with patients. . .[exoner-\nation is not] a theologically proper or humanly helpful answer to the question con-\ncerning some one's own responsibility for the event of having become sick.18\nSin is to be reckoned with, not treated as a category inapplicable to disease.\nHonestly examining responsibility rather than inappropriately ignoring it (exoner-\nation) makes conceivable a compassion-misericordia in which responsibility for\ndisease is treated with leniency. This attitude stems from God's providence, justice\nand mercy, which aims to restore sinners to friendship with God. It accompanies an\nunderstanding of human weakness, negligence and deliberate fault. This in no way\nimplies downplaying the accidental conditions of life and diseases which simply\ncome upon us. However, questions concerning those matters for which we are,\nmore or less, responsible are not neglected.\nThis merciful mental process, properly routinized, will cultivate an attitude of\ncompassionate candour in collaborative deliberation with those who suffer disease,\nengaging in past faults and future responsibilities where relevant and appropriate.\nDisease is not necessarily an alien intrusion unrelated to the subject's agency but\nmay somehow be interwoven with it. At the same time, compassion-misericordia\nrejects a judgementalism which ignores other party's faults and responsibilities,\nunderplays environmental factors or requires more strength than people can\nmuster. What emerges is an ethos of lenient if searching accommodation of persons\nin their weakness, failure and faults amidst the accidents of life.\nIf fault is reckoned with and yet treated with the heartfelt sadness of mercy,\nwhat follows for the subjective self-awareness of the sufferer, the self-conception of\ndisease? The chaplain comments that:\nDisease, insofar as it is experienced as a life crisis, can awaken a person to a dimension\nof sin which encompasses and determines his life as a whole, and which cannot be\nlimited to a moral guilt in view of singular actions.19\nSuch awakenings hardly imply that suffering or its likely onset always makes\npeople `come to their senses' and change their lives. Evidence suggests that\ntaking responsibility for healthy behaviour change is seldom primarily associated\nwith understanding one's genetically informed risk profile. Indeed, connecting\nhealth and disease with more subtle sources of self-understanding seems a more\npsychologically plausible way to encourage responsibility taking.20\nThus, such awakenings are potentially significant pastoral matters inasmuch as\nthey concern the perception of the self's responsibility for disease. A distinction is\nimportant here. Awakening to responsibility in SDM as a prospectively oriented\nactivity differs from self-perceptions informed by a solely retrospective introspec-\ntion about one's responsibility for disease. In SDM the dangers lie principally in a\nperhaps unwanted level of patient choice and that `burden of self-blame if things go\npoorly'.21 Nonetheless, pastorally speaking, a psychologically plausible process of\ncollaborative deliberation must incorporate some retrospective consciousness of\nhow past unhealthy ways of life may contribute to a poor outcome to any pro-\nspective treatment decision made.\nSo how should compassionate, candid, collaborative deliberation incorporate,\nwith pastoral sensitivity, this complex self-awareness regarding responsibility both\nfor disease and its treatment? Self-consciousness is associated with conscience in\nChristian thought \u00ad a self-conception which may involve both approving and dis-\napproving thoughts. To give rise to a bad conscience but then fail to support\nchange \u00ad pastorally, clinically and environmentally \u00ad seems as irresponsible as\ndenying the possible benefits of a troubled conscience is implausible.22\nTo develop this pastoral line, Aquinas cites St Augustine to demonstrate that\nwhat he calls fraternal correction is itself a feature of compassion-misericordia:\nit is. . .the discretion of charity that makes us spare evil-doers, not rebuking them or\nchiding them on the spot, but waiting to find a more favourable occasion; or again\nbecause we fear that it will only make them worse, or cause them to hinder and\noppress others who are weak and need instruction in a life of goodness and piety,\neven to the extent of turning them away from the faith.23\nWhat it is pastorally wise to say and do is again seen against the horizon of\nfriendship with God through faith. Wisdom involves picking your moment or, in\nsome cases, avoiding any reckoning with responsibility altogether. At the same\ntime, there may be real benefit through an early, pastoral engagement with respon-\nsibility for disease. This may be particularly relevant when others are directly\naffected by one's actions. I think of the mother I heard movingly describe her\ndaily self-reproach for the wrong she thought she had done her child by smoking\nduring pregnancy.\nPastorally speaking, while giving space for "
