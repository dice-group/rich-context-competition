    "abstract": "ABSTRACT. Objective. Depression, impulsivity, and\naggression during adolescence have been associated with\nboth adoption and suicidal behavior. Studies of adopted\nadults suggest that impulsivity, even more than depres-\nsion, may be an inherited factor that mediates suicidal\nbehavior. However, the association between adoption\nand adolescent suicide attempts and the mechanisms that\nmight explain it remain unknown. The objective of this\nstudy was to determine the following: 1) whether suicide\nattempts are more common among adolescents who live\nwith adoptive parents rather than biological parents; 2)\nwhether the association is mediated by impulsivity, and\n3) whether family connectedness decreases the risk of\nsuicide attempt regardless of adoptive or biological sta-\ntus.\nMethods. A secondary analysis of Wave I data from\nthe National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health\nwas conducted, which used a school-based, clustered\nsampling design to identify a nationally representative\nsample of 7th- to 12th-grade students, with oversampling\nof underrepresented groups. Of the 90 118 adolescents\nwho completed the National Longitudinal Study of Ad-\nolescent Health in-school survey, 17 125 completed the\nin-home interview and had parents of identified gender\nwho completed separate in-home questionnaire. The\nsubset of adolescents for this study was drawn from the\nin-home sampling according to the following criteria: 1)\nadolescent living with adoptive or biological mother at\nthe time of the interview, 2) adolescent had never been\nseparated from mother for more than 6 months, 3) mother\nwas in first marriage at the time of the interview, and 4)\nthe adoptive mother had never been married to the ado-\nlescent's biological father. Of the 6577 adolescents in the\nfinal study sample, 214 (3.3%) were living with adoptive\nmothers.\nVariables. The primary outcome measured was ado-\nlescent report of suicide attempt(s) in the past year. Other\nvariables included in the analyses were sociodemograph-\nics characteristics (gender, age, race/ethnicity, family in-\ncome, parental education), general health (self-rated\nhealth, routine examination in the past year, need for\nmedical care in the past year that was not obtained),\nmental health (depressive symptoms, self-image, trouble\nrelaxing in the past year, bad temper, psychological or\nemotional counseling in the past year), risk behaviors\n(cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana, sexual intercourse ever,\ndelinquency, physical fighting in the past year, impul-\nsive decision making), school-related characteristics\n(grade point average, school connectedness), and family\ninteraction (family connectedness, parental presence, ma-\nternal satisfaction with parent\u00adadolescent relationship).\nData Analysis. Univariate analyses were used to\ncompare adoptees versus nonadoptees, suicide attempt-\ners versus nonsuicide attempters, and adopted suicide\nattempters versus nonadopted suicide attempters on all\nvariables. Variables that were associated with attempted\nsuicide were entered into a forward stepwise logistic\nregression procedure, and variables that were associated\nwith the log odds of attempt were retained in the model.\nThe area under the model's receiver operating character-\nistic curve was calculated as a measure of its overall\nperformance. After the association of adoption with at-\ntempted suicide was demonstrated, the potential mediat-\ning effect of impulsivity was explored by adding it to the\nmodel. The same procedure was followed for any vari-\nable that was associated with adoption in the full sample\nor the subsample of suicide attempters. To determine\nwhether any variable in the model moderated the asso-\nciation between adoption and suicide attempt, the inter-\naction term for that variable  adoption was forced into\nthe model.\nResults. Adoptees differed significantly from non-\nadoptees on 4 of 26 variables. They were more likely to\nhave attempted suicide (7.6% vs 3.1%) and to have re-\nceived psychological or emotional counseling in the past\nyear (16.9% vs 8.2%), and their mothers reported higher\nparental education and family income. Attempters dif-\nfered significantly from nonattempters on all variables\nexcept for age, race/ethnicity, parental education, family\nincome, and routine examination in the past year. On\nlogistic regression, 9 variables were independently asso-\nciated with attempted suicide: depression (adjusted odds\nedness (AOR: 0.60). The receiver operating characteristic\ncurve for the model had an area of 0.834, indicating\nperformance significantly better than chance. The AOR\nfor adoption did not change when parental education,\nfamily income, and impulsivity were forced into the\nmodel. None of the interaction terms (adoption  an-\nother risk factor) demonstrated a significant effect.\nConclusions. Attempted suicide is more common\namong adolescents who live with adoptive parents than\namong adolescents who live with biological parents. The\nassociation persists after adjusting for depression and\naggression and is not explained by impulsivity as mea-\nsured by a self-reported tendency to make decisions\nquickly. Although the mechanism underlying the asso-\nciation remains unclear, recognizing the adoptive status\nmay help health care providers to identify youths who\nare at risk and to intervene before a suicide attempt\noccurs. It is important to note, however, that the great\nmajority of adopted youths do not attempt suicide and\nthat adopted and nonadopted youths in this study did\nFrom the Division of Adolescent Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Chil-\ndren's Hospital Medical Center, University of Cincinnati College of Medi-\ncine, Cincinnati, Ohio.\nReprint requests to (G.S.)

CES-D, Centers for Epidemiologic Studies De-\npression Scale.\nStudies of the psychosocial function of adopted\nadolescents vary widely in their methods, find-\nings, and interpretations. A 1998 review of the\nliterature1 cites 7 studies that demonstrate no differ-\nences between adopted and nonadopted adoles-\ncents,2\u00ad8 15 that demonstrate poorer adjustment\namong adopted adolescents,9\u00ad23 and 3 that demon-\nstrate better adjustment among adopted adolescents\non at least some variables.24\u00ad26 Much of the disagree-\nment is attributable to differences in the populations\nof adopted youths that are studied and the control\ngroups with which they are compared. For example,\nadopted and nonadopted subjects differ more when\ndrawn from clinical rather than community popula-\ntions.27\u00ad30 Subjects who are adopted in late childhood\ndiffer more from nonadopted subjects than do sub-\nsubjects who were neglected during early childhood\ndemonstrate more psychosocial difficulty during ad-\nolescence than do late-adopted subjects who were\nThe greatest controversy in the literature compar-\ning adopted and nonadopted adolescents rests with\nthe nature versus nurture interpretation of the re-\nported differences. Although the study of adopted\nindividuals has been an important strategy for ex-\nploring the genetic and family-associated environ-\nmental factors related to psychiatric disorders, its\nfocus has been on the comparison of adoptive and\nbiological relatives of adoptees rather than on the\ncomparison of adoptees and nonadoptees. Conse-\nquently, findings that support an association of a\ngiven mental health disorder with family genetics\nrather than with family environment do not neces-\nsarily indicate that adoption is a risk factor for the\ndisorder.\nIn an important adoption study designed to ex-\nplore the role of genetics and family environment in\nthe cause of mood disorders, Wender et al34 found\nsignificantly higher rates of unipolar depression, sui-\ncide, and attempted suicide among the biological\nrather than the adoptive relatives of adult subjects\nwith mood disorders. The suicide rate among the\nbiological relatives of subjects with a history of pan-\nic-type behavior or an impulsive suicide attempt was\neven higher, suggesting that impulsivity rather than\ndepression may be the inherited factor that mediates\nsuicidal behavior. In adolescents, impulsivity and\naggression have been associated with both suicidal\ncases, gender and social environment modify the\nreported associations. Although these findings sug-\ngest an association between adoption and suicidal\nbehavior, it is unknown whether adoptive status in-\ncreases an adolescent's risk for suicide attempt or\ncompletion.\nThis study used data from a large, national, school-\nbased survey to test the primary hypothesis that\nattempted suicide is more common among adoles-\ncents who live with adoptive parents than among\nadolescents who live with biological parents. Second,\nwe hypothesized that the association is mediated by\nimpulsivity. Third, we hypothesized that one aspect\nof social environment--family connectedness--de-\ncreases the risk of suicidal behavior independent of\nadoptive or biological status.\nMETHODS\nThis study is based on data from The National Longitudinal\nStudy of Adolescent Health (Add Health), the largest and most\ncomprehensive survey of adolescents ever performed in the\nUnited States. Add Health was developed to examine the associ-\nations among health-related behaviors, social contexts, and phys-\nical environments. Data were collected through 4 surveys admin-\nand 2 surveys administered during Wave II (April 1996 through\nWave I in-home sample.\nDesign of Add Health\nAdd Health used a school-based, clustered sampling design to\nidentify a nationally representative sample of adolescents in the\nwho completed the questionnaire plus students who did not com-\nplete the questionnaire but were enrolled in the schools were\neligible for inclusion in an in-home sample. A random subset of\n15 243 adolescents stratified by gender and grade were selected,\nand the 12 105 adolescents who completed in-home interviews\ncomposed the core in-home sample. In addition, special over-\nsamples were drawn for the in-home survey to provide represen-\ntation of ethnic minorities, in-school social networks, youths with\nphysical disabilities, and siblings. The total in-home sample there-\nfore consisted of the 20 745 adolescents who completed interviews\ncent respondent, preferably the mother residing with the adoles-\ncent, was asked to complete a separate in-home questionnaire.\nQuestionnaires were completed by 17 125 parents of identified\nThe in-school survey was a self-administered paper question-\nnaire completed during a 45- to 60-minute class period on a\ndesignated school day. Students who were absent from the class\nwere not given another opportunity to complete the question-\nnaire. To maximize confidentiality on the 90-minute in-home in-\nterview, the adolescent recorded all answers on a laptop com-\nputer. An interviewer read less-sensitive questions aloud to the\nadolescent. More-sensitive questions were prerecorded, and the\nadolescent listened to the audiotape through earphones and re-\ncorded the answer directly into the computer using audio-CASI\ntechnology.41 The 30-minute parent questionnaire was interview-\ner-assisted and op-scanned.24\nStudy Sample\nThe sample for this study was drawn from the Wave I set of\n17 125 adolescents who completed in-home surveys and whose\nparents completed in-home surveys. An adolescent was consid-\nered eligible if he or she was living with his or her adoptive or\nbiological mother at the time of the in-home interview and had\nnever been separated from her for more than 6 months. If the\nadolescent's mother had not completed the parent questionnaire,\nwas not married at the time of data collection, or had been married\nmore than once, then the adolescent was excluded from this study.\nAn adolescent who lived with an adoptive mother was excluded\nif the adoptive mother had ever been married to the adolescent's\nbiological father. The final sample consisted of 6577 adolescents.\nEach adolescent in the study sample was categorized as\nadopted or nonadopted according to information provided by the\nmother on the in-home questionnaire. The adolescent was consid-\nered adopted when the mother identified herself as the adoptive\nmother and nonadopted when the mother identified herself as the\nbiological mother. The question, \"Are you adopted?\" was asked\ndirectly of adolescents on the in-school survey. However, because\n25% of adolescents in Wave I did not complete the in-school\nquestionnaire, the item was not used to define adoptive or non-\nadoptive status. It was included in the analysis to explore concor-\ndance between adolescent and maternal report of adoption. Of the\nadopted group.\nVariables Included in the Analyses\nAll of the variables described below were derived from items\non the in-home interviews of adolescents and their mothers. Some\nof the variables were derived from single items, whereas others\nwere derived from groups of items. Participants who answered at\nleast 75% of the items that composed a multi-item variable were\nincluded in the analysis of that variable. For these participants, the\nratings for unanswered items in a multi-item scale were imputed\nfrom the mean rating of answered items in the scale. The study\nvariables and their assigned categories are described below.\nSuicide Attempt\nAdolescents used a 5-point Likert scale to answer the question,\n\"During the past 12 months, how many times did you actually\nattempt suicide?\" Responses were dichotomized into no attempt\nversus 1 or more attempts. Add Health did not include a question\nabout suicide attempts ever.\nSociodemographic Characteristics\nGender was identified by the adolescent on the in-school inter-\nview and validated by the in-home interviewer. Age was calcu-\nlated from the date of interview and the date of birth. Racial/\nethnic identity was indicated by the adolescent, with instructions\nto select the predominant affiliation if more than 1 was noted. The\nresponse was categorized as white non-Hispanic, black non-His-\npanic, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, or other.\nFamily income was defined as the mother's report of the total\npretax income in dollars received by all household members in\n1994, including dividends and welfare benefits. Report of 0 in-\ncome was considered a missing response. Otherwise, reported\nincome was adjusted for household size, compared with the 1994\nthreshold for poverty established by the US Census Bureau, and\nassigned to 1 of the following 5 classes: 1) 1.5 times the poverty\nthreshold (a conservative estimate of substandard living condi-\nincomes, and 5) the top 5% of incomes.43\nParental education was determined from the mother's response\nto the questions, \"How far did you go in school?\" and, \"How far\ndid your partner/spouse go in school?\" The higher of the 2\nanswers was defined as parental education and was assigned to 1\nof the following 5 categories: 1) did not graduate from high school\nand did not go to a vocational school instead of high school; 2)\ngraduated from high school, received a high-school equivalency\ndegree, or went to vocational school instead of high school; 3)\nwent to vocational school after high school or went to college but\ndid not graduate; 4) graduated from college; and 5) attended\nprofessional school after college graduation.\nGeneral Health\nThe adolescents were asked to rate their health on a 5-point\nLikert scale ranging from 1 (excellent) to 5 (poor). Self-rated health\ncorrelates with physical, mental, and social health. It is a valid and\nreliable indicator in adolescents and adults that differentiates in-\ndividuals with and without chronic disease and is predictive of\nboth the diagnosis of serious illness and the likelihood of surviv-\nTwo items about general health care were included in the\nanalyses. Adolescent responses to the question, \"When did you\nlast have a physical examination by a doctor or nurse?\" were\ndichotomized as less than a year ago versus more than a year ago\nor never. Adolescent responses to the question, \"Has there been\nany time over the past year when you thought you should get\nmedical care, but you did not?\" were dichotomized as yes or no.\nMental Health\nAdd Health contains 16 of the original 20 items that composed\nthe Centers for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-\nD).46,47 Two additional items from the CES-D were included in\nmodified form. The internal consistency of the modified 18-item\nscale was excellent (Cronbach's   0.87) and decreased when any\nitem was dropped. The sum of these 18 items therefore was used\nto impute the full 20-item CES-D score after correcting for unan-\nswered items. Each item was rated on a scale of 0 to 3. Potential\nCES-D scores thus ranged from 0 (no depressive symptoms) to 60\n(maximum depressive symptoms).\nIn a study of 9th- to 12th-grade adolescents, Roberts et al47\nfound that the sensitivity and the specificity of the of the CES-D\nfor the detection of major depressive disorders were maximized at\nscores of 24 for females and 22 for males. We used these\ncutpoints in the current study to create a dichotomous variable\nindicative of depression.\nThe self-image score was calculated as the mean of 6 items, each\nof which was rated on a 5-point Likert scale (Cronbach's  \nself-image). Trouble relaxing in the past 12 months was assessed\nby a single item on the adolescent survey rated on a 5-point scale\nranging from 0 (never) to 4 (daily). Bad temper was assessed by a\nsingle dichotomous item on the parent survey asking whether the\nadolescent had a bad temper.\nPrevious mental health care was assessed by dichotomized\nyes/no responses to the question, \"In the past year, have you\nreceived psychological or emotional counseling?\"\nRisk Behaviors\nItems that assessed cigarette use were combined to create a\nvariable with the following 6 levels: 1  never smoked, 2  never\nsmoked a whole cigarette, 3  smoked a whole cigarette but not in\nthe past 30 days, 4  smoked at least a whole cigarette but less\nthan a pack per week in the past 30 days, 5  smoked at least a\npack per week but less than a pack per day in the past 30 days, and\n6  smoked at least a pack per day in the past 30 days.\nItems that assessed alcohol use were combined to create a\nvariable with the following 5 levels: 0  never had alcohol, 1 \nhad alcohol but not on more that 1 or 2 days in the past 12 months,\n2  had alcohol on more than 2 days in the past 12 months but less\nthan every week in the past 12 months, 3  had alcohol on 1 to 5\ndays a week in the past 12 months, 4  had alcohol every day or\nalmost every day in the past 12 months.\nItems that assessed marijuana use were combined to create a\nvariable with the following 5 levels: 0  never used, 1  used but\ntimes in the past 30 days.\nSexual activity was assessed as a yes/no answer to the ques-\ntion, \"Have you ever had sexual intercourse?\" Delinquency was\nassessed as the sum of 15 items, each rated on a scale of 0 to 2\n(Cronbach's   0.84). Potential scores thus ranged from 0 to 30.\nAggression was assessed by the question, \"During the past 12\nmonths, how often did you get into a physical fight?\" Responses\nwere dichotomized as \"once\" and \"more than once\" versus \"nev-\ner.\" Impulsivity was assessed by the statement, \"When making\ndecisions, you usually go with your ``gut feeling' without thinking\ntoo much about the consequences of each alternative.\" Responses\nwere dichotomized as \"strongly agree\" and \"agree\" versus \"nei-\nther agree nor disagree,\" \"disagree,\" and \"strongly disagree.\"\nSchool\nTwo variables that pertained to school were included in the\nanalyses. The adolescent's grade point average was the average of\nthe self-reported letter grades at the last grading period in at least\n2 of 4 core subjects: English, mathematics, history, and science.\nThe grades were coded as follows: 1  A, 2  B, 3  C, 4  D or\nworse.\nThe school connectedness scale score was derived from 8 items,\neach rated on a 5-point Likert scale (Cronbach's   0.75).40 Four\nitems were rated on a scale of 1 to 5. The ratings for 3 items\noriginally were coded by Add Health investigators on a scale of 0\nto 4; these ratings were recoded on a scale of 1 to 5 to maintain\nconsistency across items. The 8 item ratings were summed to yield\na scale score with a potential range of 8 (low connectedness) to 40\n(high connectedness).\nFamily\nThree variables that pertained to family relationships were\nincluded in the analyses. The family connectedness scale score\nrated on a scale of 1 (low connectedness) to 5 (high connected-\nness). The ratings of 3 items were averaged to yield a mean. The 10\nremaining items were divided into 4 subgroups, and the highest\nrating within each subgroup was selected to represent the sub-\ngroup. The 5 resulting ratings were summed to yield a scale score\nwith a potential range of 5 (low connectedness) to 25 (high con-\nnectedness).\nThe parental presence scale consists of 7 items and has a po-\ntential range of 4 (low presence) to 22 (high presence)40; its method\nof construction precludes use of Cronbach's . Maternal satisfac-\ntion with the relationship with the adolescent was rated on a\n5-point Likert-type scale. A higher rating reflected lower satisfac-\ntion.\nData Analysis\nSample weights were not applied in these analyses because\nfewer adopted than nonadopted subjects had been assigned\nweight variables by the Add Health investigators (90.2% vs 94.6%;\nP  .006). To decrease the likelihood of a type 1 error resulting\nfrom the unweighted analyses, we set statistical significance con-\nservatively at P  .01. Nonparametric test phi coefficients were\nused as the measure of association for variables that violated\nassumptions of normal distribution.\nThree sets of univariate analyses were performed. In the first\nset, adopted and nonadopted adolescents were compared on all\nvariables. In the second set, adolescents who did and did not\nreport suicide attempt(s) were compared. In the third set, adoptees\nand nonadoptees who attempted suicide were compared.\nVariables from the second set of analyses that were associated\nwith attempted suicide at P  .01 were entered into a forward\nstepwise logistic regression procedure to identify those that were\nindependently associated with attempted suicide. Variables that\nwere associated with the log odds of attempted suicide at P  .05\nwere retained in the model. To enhance comparability of the\nadjusted odds ratios, the continuous and ordinal variables in the\nmodel were converted to dichotomous variables. The CES-D score\nwas dichotomized using Roberts' criteria, as described above.47\nThe self-image, delinquency, and family connectedness scores\nwere dichotomized as the highest tertile (low self-image, high\ndelinquency, high family connectedness) versus the lower 2 quar-\ntiles. Cigarette use was dichotomized as levels 1 and 2 (never\nsmoked or never smoked a whole cigarette) versus levels 3 to 6.\nThe adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals are re-\nported, and a receiver operating characteristic curve of the model\nwas drawn by plotting the sensitivity (true positive rate) and\n1-specificity (false-positive rate) at different cutpoints in the prob-\nability estimation of attempted suicide. The area under the curve\nwas calculated as a measure of the overall performance of the\nAfter the association of adoption with attempted suicide and its\nindependence of depression and aggression was demonstrated,\nthe potentially mediating effect of impulsivity was explored by\nadding it to the model. The same procedure was followed for any\nvariable associated with adoption in either the full sample or\nattempt subsample. To determine whether any variable in the final\nmodel moderated the association between adoption and attempt,\nwe forced into the model the interaction term for that variable \nadoption.\nRESULTS\nlived with biological mothers. At least 1 suicide at-\ntempt in the past year was reported by 213 (3.3%) of\nAdopted and nonadopted adolescents differed sig-\nnificantly on 4 variables: attempted suicide, parental\neducation, family income, and mental health coun-\nseling in the past year.

Mean family income level was\nnonadopted group (P  .0001). At least 1 parent with\na professional degree was reported by 73 adoptive\n.001). Counseling in the past year was reported by 36\nadolescents (8.2%; P  .001). There were no signifi-\ncant differences between the adopted and non-\nadopted groups on any other variables.\nThe univariate analyses comparing adolescents\nwho did and did not report suicide attempt(s) in the\npast year are summarized in Tables 1 to 4. The\ngroups differed significantly on all variables except\nTABLE 1.

Comparison of\nadoptees and nonadoptees who attempted suicide\nrevealed significant differences in only 2 variables,\nCES-D score (P  .005) and self-esteem score (P \n.05), both of which were retained in the final model.\nNone of the interaction terms (adoption  another\nrisk factor) demonstrated a significant effect on the\nlogistic model.\nDISCUSSION\nThe results of this study indicate that attempted\nsuicide is more common among adolescents who live\nwith adoptive parents than among adolescents who\nlive with biological parents. The study population\nintentionally was limited to adolescents who were\nliving with their adoptive or biological mothers and\nwho had not been separated from their mothers for\nlonger than 6 months. Furthermore, because the par-\nticipants' mothers were in first-time marriages, it is\nlikely that most of the participants had not experi-\nenced parental divorce and were living in 2-parent\nhouseholds. The adopted and nonadopted groups\ntherefore were matched for 3 variables that have\nconfounded many studies of adopted youths: family\nstructure, parental divorce, and mother\u00adchild sepa-\nration. Other important aspects of adoption, such as\nthe child's age at which it occurred or whether the\nadoptive parents were biologically related to the\nchild, were not included in the Add Health data set.\nVariables such as these therefore remain key targets\nfor the future study of suicide attempts among\nadopted youths.\nThe results of the current study support the pri-\nmary hypothesis that adoption is associated with\nattempted suicide but do not support the secondary\nhypothesis that the association is mediated by im-\npulsivity. However, it is important to remember that\nthe Add Health survey did not include a validation\nof impulsivity. The CES-D, which is a validated mea-\nsure of depression, showed much better discrimina-\ntion between participants who did and did not at-\ntempt suicide than did the nonvalidated measures\nfor impulsivity and aggression. Perhaps in-depth in-\nterviews designed to elicit self- and/or parent per-\nceptions of impulsive or aggressive behavior would\nhave yielded different results. Conversely, previous\nstudies indicated that depression is a stronger and\nmore consistent correlate of attempted suicide\namong adolescents than is either impulsivity or ag-\nThe study results do support the third hypothesis\nthat family connectedness decreases the risk of sui-\ncidal behavior regardless of adolescent adoptive or\nnonadoptive status. The association between family\nconnectedness and adolescent suicide attempt was\nreported previously for the full Add Health sample,\nwhich includes a broad array of family structures.40\nThe demonstration of its continued association in the\nhighly select subset analyzed in this study, as well as\nits independence of adoptive or nonadoptive status,\nemphasizes how important family connectedness is\nto adolescent well-being. The finding is supported by\nthat it is the quality of the parent\u00adadolescent rela-\ntionship, rather than adoptive or nonadoptive status,\nthat predicts adolescent psychosocial risk. Family\nfunction, defined and measured differently than the\nAdd Health construct of family connectedness, also\nhas been shown to be associated with adolescent\nsuicide attempt,54 other risk behaviors, and depres-\nIn addition to depression, adoption, aggression,\nand family connectedness, the following 5 factors\ndemonstrated independent associations with at-\ntempted suicide in this study: mental health counsel-\ning in the past year, female gender, cigarette use,\ndelinquency, and low self-image. All have been re-\nported previously to increase the risk of suicide at-\ntempt during adolescence. The rate of suicidal be-\nhavior is 3 times higher for adolescents who have\nreceived previous outpatient mental health care and\n7 times higher for adolescents who have received\ninpatient care than for adolescents with no history of\ncare.56\u00ad60 The predominance of females compared\nwith males among adolescents who attempt suicide\nis well documented and contrasts sharply with the\npredominance of males who complete suicide during\nmid- and late adolescence.61,62 However, data from\nthe 1999 National Youth Risk Behavior Survey of 9th-\nto 12th-grade students indicate that race/ethnicity\nmay affect the association between suicide attempt\nand gender. Rates of suicide attempt were signifi-\ncantly higher among white non-Hispanic and His-\npanic females than males but did not differ by gen-\nder among black non-Hispanic students. Among all\nracial/ethnic and grade-level subgroups, females\nTABLE 5.

Although cigarette smoking in most studies\nis associated with both suicide attempt and sub-\nstance abuse, it seems to be a marker of risk rather\nthan an independent predictor of suicidal behav-\nvious studies compared with the current study may\nreflect the differences between the clinically derived\nsamples of previous studies and the school-based Add\nHealth sample of the current study. It is likely that the\nseverity of both suicidal behavior and substance abuse\nis higher for adolescents who have a history of psychi-\natric inpatient and/or outpatient care than it is for\nadolescents who are attending school and living at\nhome. It also is possible that the in-home setting of the\nAdd Health survey interfered with adolescent disclo-\nsure of alcohol and other drug use.\nAnother discrepancy between the current and pre-\nvious studies is the independent nature of the asso-\nciation between low self-image and suicide attempt.\nLow self-image has been demonstrated to be a more\nconsistent association with suicidal ideation than\nfound to predict suicide attempt independent of\nother variables. The persistent effect of low self-im-\nage in this study, after adjustment for well-estab-\nlished predictors of attempt such as depression, ag-\ngression, impulsivity, and family factors, suggests\nthat the adolescents who reported attempt(s) in the\npast year may have had ongoing suicidal ideation at\nthe time of the survey.\nCONCLUSION\nSuicide attempts are significantly more common\namong adolescents who live with married adoptive\nmothers than among adolescents who live with mar-\nried biological mothers. The association between\nadoption and attempted suicide persists after adjust-\ning for depression and aggression and is not medi-\nated by impulsivity as measured by a self-reported\ntendency to make decisions quickly. Although the\nmechanism underlying the association remains un-\nclear, adoptive status may help health care providers\nto identify youths who are at risk and to intervene\nbefore a suicide attempt occurs. It is equally impor-\ntant to note, however, that the great majority of\nadopted youths do not attempt suicide and that\nadopted and nonadopted youths in this study did\nnot differ in other aspects of emotional and behav-\nioral health. Furthermore, high family connectedness\ndecreases the likelihood of suicide attempts regard-\nless of adoptive status and represents a protective\nfactor for all adolescents.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThere was no financial support outside the division for this\nstudy.\nThis research is based on data from the Add Health project, a\nprogram project designed by J.
