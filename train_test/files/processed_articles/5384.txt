    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe aim was to develop a new instrument for measuring length of sleep as well as television and computer habits in school-age\nchildren. A questionnaire was constructed for use when children visit the school health care unit. Three aspects of the validity\nof the questionnaire were examined: its face validity, content validity, and construct validity. Test\u00adretest reliability was\nassessed by giving the questionnaire twice, 2 weeks apart, to the respondents. The questionnaire was assessed as being rea-\nsonably valid, the test\u00adretest results (n \u00bc 138) showing 90.4% of the estimates regarding bedtime on weeknights on the two\nsurvey occasions to lie within + 30 min of each other, the test\u00adretest agreement also being rather close (k > .600) regarding\nboth sleep and media habits. The instrument can be a valuable tool in a clinical setting, both for measuring sleep habits in a class\nand for discussing sleep with individual school children and their families.\n",

All school children in Swe-\nden are provided the possibility of an individual visit to the\nschool health care unit every 3 years, a school nurse discuss-\ning matters of health with them at the time, their height and\nweight also being measured then (Clausson, 2008). Sleep\nproblems in children have been found to have increased\nin recent years, lack of sleep being one of the most common\ncomplaints of children and adolescents today (Bremberg,\n2006). Sleep problems in childhood appear to be a possible\nindicator of later risk of neuropsychological difficulties\n(Gregory, Caspi, Moffitt, & Poulton, 2009), such as those\ninvolving depression (Gregory, Rijsdijk, Lau, Dahl, &\nEley, 2009), anxiety, and aggression (Gregory, Van der\nEnde, Willis, & Verhulst, 2008). Nevertheless, the avail-\nability of clinical sleep-diagnostic and treatment services\nfor children is generally inadequate in most countries,\nincluding Sweden (Owens, 2005). In order to have an ade-\nquate basis for providing children advice regarding their\nsleeping problems, reliable information on their sleeping\nhabits and on factors that influence their length of sleep are\ncalled for. There was the need of a questionnaire suitable\nfor use in a school health care setting for children with\nand without sleep problems that could provide a basis for\ndiscussions during health care visit.\nOne problem connected with many existing question-\nnaires is of their being designed primarily for use in diagnos-\ning serious sleeping difficulties that are clinical in character,\nrather than for studying differences in children's sleep habits\ngenerally. Another problem is the length of questionnaires.\nIn the present study, the suitability of a new, short question-\nnaire was investigated. The questionnaire is designed so that\nschool nurses can distribute it to school children at the time\nof their ordinary school health care visits. Development of\nthe questionnaire was inspired by various other sleep-\nevaluation scales and questionnaires (Lomeli et al., 2008).\nSeveral of the existing questionnaires, specifically the\nSchool Sleep Habits Survey (Wolfson & Carskadon,\n1998), the Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire (Mindell &\n1 School Health Care, Klosterga\n\u00b0rdsskolan, Lund, Sweden\n2 Centre for Primary Health Care Research, Lund University, Sweden\n3 Faculty of Medicine, Lund University, Sweden\nCorresponding Author:\nPernilla Garmy, School Health Care, Klosterga\n\u00b0rdsskolan, Nordanva\nLund, Sweden\nEmail: pernilla.garmy@lund.se\nThe Journal of School Nursing\nReprints and permission:\nsagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav\nhttp://jsn.sagepub.com\nOwens, 2003), the National Sleep Foundation Questionnaire\n(2006), and the Children's Sleep Habit Questionnaire\n(Owens, Spirito, & McGuinn, 2000), were found to be rather\ntime-consuming, each of them several pages long. For the\npurpose of guiding an interview leading to health counsel-\ning, what was needed was a short, easy-to-use questionnaire\nthat children above a certain age could readily fill out and\nparents of younger children could complete on their child's\nbehalf. The instrument employed is a further development of\nan earlier 10-item questionnaire developed for use in a pilot\nthe television and computer habits of primary school chil-\nAim\nThe aim of the present study was to develop and evaluate the\nvalidity and reliability of a new instrument for measuring\nboth the length of sleep and the television and computer\nhabits of children of school age.\nMethod\nThe study has a psychometric, cross-sectional design.\nApproval of the study was obtained from the head principal\nof each school and from the school's head physician.\nRespondents were told that participation was voluntary and\nthose participating gave their informed consent. The study\nwas also reviewed by the Advisory Committee on Research\nThe Questionnaire\nA questionnaire (see Appendix A) consisting of 11 questions\nwas constructed. The questions pertained to eight variables\nconcerning sleep as well as possible effects of lack of sleep,\nand also to TV and computer habits (length of sleep on\nweeknights and on weekends, time for getting ready for bed,\ntime of going to bed, amount of time spent watching televi-\nsion and at the computer). There were four questions regard-\ning problems related to sleeping habits and their possible\neffects such as difficulties in falling asleep, difficulties in\nwaking up, experiencing feeling tired at school, and enjoy-\nment of school. Although asking the time the child got up\non weekdays and weekends, and went to bed on weekends,\nwould have provided a certain check on the child's estimates\nof hours slept, these questions were not asked, due to the aim\nof keeping the questionnaire brief. The questionnaire was\nconstructed for use at the regular, individual school health\ncare visits children have while in the preschool class (age\n14) and in the first upper secondary school grade (age 16).\nFor children in the preschool class or in grade 1, admin-\nistration of the questionnaire took place during the child's\nfirst health care visit at school, when one of the parents or\nboth came with their child to the school health care unit\nand filled out the questionnaire on the child's behalf. For\nchildren in grades 4 and 8 and in upper secondary school,\nit involved the pupils filling out the questionnaire them-\nselves during a school health care visit. The present ques-\ntionnaire was developed initially on the basis of a review\nof pediatric literature on sleep and was inspired by earlier\nsleep questionnaires developed by Wolfson and Carskadon\nNorberg, Lennerena\n\u00a8s, Gillberg, and Pernler (2004), and the\nNational Sleep Foundation (2006). The instrument is also\na further development of the 10-item questionnaire used in\nthe pilot study referred to. Regarding the reliability of the\n10-item questionnaire, results of the two separate testing\nconducted were found to correspond rather closely with one\nData Collection\nThe questionnaires were distributed by six school nurses in\nwith more than 4 years of experience in school health care,\nwere informed both in writing and orally that they should be\nsensitive in their approach and not try to persuade any of the\npotential respondents to participate. The respondents were\ntold that there were no right or wrong answers, that it was\na question of what they themselves thought.\nSample and Setting\nThe study, which was part of a larger study concerned with\nchildren attending the preschool class, grades 1, 4, and 8, and\ngrade 1 in upper secondary school (n \u00bc 4692), was con-\nducted in a municipality in southern Sweden of about\nborn abroad, the unemployment rate was 2.4%, and 1.6% of\nthe populace received welfare payments (Sva\n\u00a8rd & Nilsson,\nthese were selected randomly for inclusion in the study. The\nsample taken consisted of 160 respondents. The sample size\nwas based on the recommendations of Fleiss (1986), that is,\nthat 15\u00ad20 subjects would be required for estimating the\nreliability of a quantitative variable. There were 116 child\nrespondents (32 being pupils in grade 4, 31 pupils in grade\n8, and 31 pupils in first grade in upper secondary school) and\n44 parent respondents whose children were in the preschool\nclass or grade 1, 138 of them having filled out the question-\nnaire on both occasions on which it was given, 2 weeks\napart. Fifty-three percent of those in the sample were girls\n(n \u00bc 73). Twenty-two of the respondents only answered the\nquestionnaire once. For the pupils in grades 4 and 8 and the\nfirst upper secondary school grade, the reasons for failure to\nfill out the questionnaire the second time were either their\nbeing absent the second time the questionnaire was distrib-\nuted (n \u00bc 7) or a lack of desire to participate then (n \u00bc 2),\nand for 13 of the parents of children in the preschool class\nor in grade 1 it was failure to fill out and return the second\nquestionnaire. Cases in which the questionnaire was not\nfilled out the second time (whether by the children them-\nselves or their parents) were found to not differ from the\nremaining cases in terms of the age and gender of the chil-\ndren, or of geographic location.\nTests of Validity\nThree aspects of the validity of the questionnaire were exam-\nined: its face validity, its content validity, and its construct\nvalidity. Validity refers to the degree to which an instrument\nmeasures what it is supposed to measure, face validity to the\nextent to which an instrument appears valid to those who use\nit, content validity to the extent to which a measure repre-\nsents all facets of the content area being assessed, and con-\nstruct validity to the degree to which a survey or test score\ncorrelates with some related measure (Polit & Beck, 2006;\nStreiner & Norman, 2003). The face validity of the instru-\nment was evaluated, for the children who filled out the ques-\ntionnaire themselves, by asking all of them, both orally and\nin writing, to comment on the questionnaire, and urging\nthem to write down their comments on it. The time taken for\ncompleting the questionnaire was also noted. In addition, the\ncontent validity of the questionnaire was evaluated by letting\nan expert group consisting of four persons review and com-\nment on the questionnaire. One of them had more than 10\nyears of experience as a registered nurse working with chil-\ndren and had been a school nurse for 7 years, another had\nmore than 20 years of experience in the development and\npsychometric analysis of test instruments, and the remaining\ntwo persons had considerable experience in connection with\nuse of sleep medicine.\nThe construct validity, the association between the\nlength of sleep and feelings of being tired at school, as well\nas difficulties in sleeping, were assessed using the chi-\nsquare test. The length of sleep the children had was dichot-\nomized so as to form two groups: those sleeping less than\nthe median for their grade (short sleep) and those sleeping\nlonger. The median length of sleep per night was 10 hr at\nTest of Reliability\nThe reliability of the questionnaire was tested by giving the\nrespondents (n \u00bc 138) the same questionnaire twice within a\n2-week period. This made it possible to evaluate the test\u00adret-\nest reliability or stability. An assessment of the test's power\nindicated 30 individuals in each grade to suffice for accepta-\nble conclusions to be drawn regarding the test's reliability.\nTaking account of the fact that sleep and media habits can\nfluctuate, it was considered, in line with the expert group's\nassessment, that +30 min was a reasonable time span of dif-\nferences between the two time estimates for there to be basic\nagreement between them.\nStatistical Analysis\nThe chi-Square test and the Fisher Exact test were used to\nidentify the association between length of sleep and both\nfeelings of being tired at school and difficulties in sleeping\nconsidered statistically significant. Kappa analysis and per-\ncentage of agreement were both used for assessing the agree-\nment of the two measurements in test\u00adretest terms.\nUnweighted Kappa was used for dichotomized variables,\nweighted Kappa for ordinal data (Altman, 1991), and per-\ncentage of agreement for continuous variables. For the\ntest\u00adretest assessment of sleep length, of bedtime, of time\nof getting ready for bed, and of time spent at a television set\nor at a computer, that is, of all the variables considered, an\ninterval of +30 min was considered by the expert group\nto represent an acceptable level of agreement. The kappa\nvalues were classified in the manner described by Altman\nsame criteria were used for percentage of agreement. The\nstatistical analyses were performed using statistical package\nfor the social sciences (SPSS) version 14.0 (Chicago, IL) and\nthe VassarStats website for statistical computations (http://\nfaculty.vassar.edu/lowry/VassarStats.html).\nResults\nValidity\nFace validity. The parents of the children in the preschool\nclass and of those in grade 1 tended to report no difficulties\nin answering the questions on behalf of their children. The\npupils in grades 4 and 8 and in upper secondary school raised\nquestions of what was meant by getting ready for bed,\nwhereas none of the parents had such questions. The chil-\ndren in grade 4 often needed help in calculating their length\nof sleep. Some of the children wrote down the time they\nwoke up rather than the length of time they slept. The time\ntaken in filling out the questionnaire was generally about 3\u00ad\n7 min. The children in grade 4 took the longest time.\nContent validity. The expert review of the instrument led to\nthe development of a version of the questionnaire that also\nincluded two questions regarding stress and self-\nconfidence since sleep problems are often associated with\nstress and low self-efficacy (Bremberg, 2006). The two\nquestions were ``I feel stressed'' (never, seldom, often, or\nevery day) and ``I'm pleased with myself'' (every day, often,\nseldom). A group of 30 pupils were asked to fill out this\nquestionnaire. Since all of them answered these two ques-\ntions in about the same way, both of the questions were\nexcluded from further development of the questionnaire.\nAnother result of the expert review of the test instrument\nwas that a question specifically concerned with the length\nof time the child slept was included in the final questionnaire.\nEarlier, only questions about bedtime and the time the child\ngot up were asked, which only enabled the time the child\nspent in bed to be calculated, rather than the length of time the\nchild slept.\nConstruct validity. The median length of sleep on\nweeknights was 10 hr for the preschool class, as well as for\ngrades 1 and 4, whereas for grade 8 it was 8 hr, and for the\nupper secondary school class considered it was 7 hr and 30\nmin. Those in each grade sleeping less than the median time\nformed a short-sleep group. Being short of sleep was found to\nbe significantly related to being tired in school (w2 \u00bc 6.265,\ndf \u00bc 1, p \u00bc .012,) and to having difficulties in sleeping\nReliability\nThe test\u00adretest results showed a high level of agreement con-\ncerning bedtime on weeknights, 90.4% of the answers on the\ntwo testing occasions being within +30 min of each other.\nThe answers to length of sleep on weeknights also showed a\nhigh degree of concordance, 86.8% within a +30-min inter-\nval on the two occasions, see Table 1. All of the continuous\nvariables (bedtime, time for getting ready for bed, length\nof sleep on weeknights and on weekends, and time spent\nwatching television or at the computer) showed reasonable-\nand weighted Kappa values for having bedroom TV, having\ndifficulties in falling asleep, feeling tired in school, having\ndifficulties in waking up, and enjoying school showed\nreasonable-to-excellent agreement according to methods\nDiscussion\nSleep is a fundamental need in terms of human health and is\nthus an obvious area for school health care. The availability of\na reliable and valid instrument to screen students' sleeping\nhabits and the time spent on TV and computer is valuable. For\none thing, it provides a unique entry point for a conversation\nregarding sleep and media habits of pupils at individual visits.\nIn addition, it gives the school nurse a tool to use in identify-\ning sleep habits in a class or in a school district.\nThe questionnaire was validated in terms of face validity,\ncontent validity, and construct validity. Regarding face\nvalidity, the questionnaire was found to be easy both to\nunderstand and to fill out with two exceptions. Children in\ngrade 4 often needed help in calculating the length of time\nthey slept, and many of the children, regardless of their\nage, had difficulties in understanding what getting ready for\nbed stands for. School nurses found the questionnaire valu-\nable in providing an opportunity to discuss sleep hygiene\nwith the pupils. Construct validity was assessed in terms\nof the degree of association between stated sleep length and\nanswers to questions about being tired in school and having\ndifficulties in sleeping. In both cases, the association was\nfound to be highly significant, clearly supporting the con-\nstruct validity of the test.\nClose agreement was obtained in the test\u00adretest compar-\nison of the questionnaire results for length of sleep and for\nbedtime on weekday nights. The agreement was somewhat\nless but was still rather close for length of sleep and bedtime\non weekend nights, which is rather understandable in view\nof weekends usually being less rigidly scheduled than week-\ndays are. The questionnaire showed a high degree of reliabil-\nity regarding difficulties in waking up and bedroom TV. The\nother questions, concerning sleeping difficulties, feelings of\ntiredness at school and enjoying school, showed a reason-\nLimitations\nOne potential drawback to the results is that the schools\nselected cannot be assumed to adequately represent the pop-\nulation of Sweden generally. However, the random selection\nTable 1.

Although some of the percentages of agreement and\nkappa values are lower than others, we can see no linear\ntrend reflective of age differences in the test\u00adretest\nresponses. The answers of the pupils to the questionnaire\nshowed a slightly lower degree of stability than the answers\nto the questionnaires by parents, yet the instrument seems to\nfunction relatively well for all the grades that were involved.\nThere is a clear advantage in employing a short and easy-\nto-use instrument in a clinical setting, although this does\ninvolve limitations, since the short length of the question-\nnaire makes it impossible to examine all aspects of the sleep\nhabits and of the television and computer habits, as well as\nhabits of other sorts that could be of interest related to sleep.\nStress and lack of self-confidence, for example, represented\nhere by the questions ``I feel stressed'' (never, seldom, often\nor every day) and ``I'm pleased with myself'' (every day,\noften, seldom), respectively, have been shown to be associ-\nated with sleeping difficulties (Bremberg, 2006). The focus\nof the present study and the breadth of the test instrument\nwere necessarily limited. Investigating sleep habits in\ngreater depth and studying other variables that contribute\nto sleep would require use of a longer instrument. The use\nof cellular phones by adolescents for text messaging and for\ncalling after lights are out is prevalent and readily increases\nthe degree of tiredness of many adolescents (Van den Bulck,\n2007), yet is not examined here. Despite the limitations of\nthe present instrument, the evaluation of its validity and\nreliability points to its being a potentially valuable tool in\na clinical setting.\nSchool Nursing Implications\nSchool nurses should obviously continue their important\nwork of promoting healthy lifestyles in children, including\nhealthy sleep habits and healthy TV and computer habits.\nRegarding sleep, a first step that a school nurse should take\nis to teach children with sleep problems, and their families as\nwell, sound sleep habits through emphasizing the need of\nmaintaining a regular and consistent sleep schedule and bed-\ntime routine, having the child's bedroom conducive to\nsleep--dark, cool, and quiet--keeping TV and computers\nout of the child's bedroom, and avoiding the child consum-\ning caffeine (Mindell & Owens, 2003; National Sleep foun-\nprovides a point of entry for conversations with the children\nor with the parents regarding the sleep and media habits. If\nsleep problems are noted, it is important that the family be\ninvolved. Use of both a sleep diary and a questionnaire hav-\ning more detailed questions than those involved here can be\ndesirable. Judith Owens' Children's Sleep Habits Question-\nnaire (Owens et al., 2000) is an example of an instrument\ncontaining further questions regarding sleep habits. If prob-\nlems persist, the child should see a doctor to rule out possible\nmedical causes of insomnia or daytime sleepiness. Note that\nsleep apnea associated with snoring can also occur in school\nchildren.\nConclusions\nThe questionnaire shows rather close test\u00adretest agreement\nregarding having sleeping difficulties, having bedroom TV,\nfeelings of tiredness at school, enjoying school, and having\ndifficulties in waking up. It also showed a reasonable level\nof reliability for length of sleep, bedtime, time for getting\nready for bed, and time spent either watching television or\nat the computer. School nurses found that the questionnaire\nwas a help in opening up a discussion with pupils regarding\ntheir sleep habits. Parents and school children alike found the\nquestionnaire to be easy to fill out. It appears that the instru-\nment could be a valuable tool in a clinical sense, both for mea-\nsuring sleep habits and for discussing matters of sleep with\nindividual school children and their families.\nAppendix\nQuestions Regarding Sleep and Lifestyle\n1.
