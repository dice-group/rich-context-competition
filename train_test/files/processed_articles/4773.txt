    "abstract": "Abstract\nColor-in-context theory is the first theoretical framework for understanding color effects in human mate preferences, arguing\nthat red clothing enhances attractiveness ratings. Here we present three empirical studies failing to support this prediction.\nWe aimed to extend the current literature by differentiating color effects by temporal context (short-term vs. long-term\nmating). Experiment 1 involved Dutch participants rating a woman in red, white, and black on (sexual) attractiveness.\nExperiment 2 replicated the first experiment with an American sample. In the final experiment, we aimed to replicate a study\nthat did find evidence of a red effect, using a substantially larger sample size. The results from each of the three studies\n(totaling N \u00bc 830 men) fail to support the red effect. We discuss the implications of our results and avenues for future\nresearch on red effects and attractiveness.\n",

Craig Roberts2, and Thomas V. Pollet1\n Keywords\ncolor, red, black, white, attraction, sexual attraction, human mate preferences, sexual receptivity\nIn recent years, several researchers have argued that humans\nmight be affected by the presence of color cues in opposite-sex\nconspecifics (e.g., Elliot & Niesta, 2008; Pazda, Elliot, &\nColor-in-context theory (Elliot & Maier, 2012) is the first the-\noretical framework formulated by social psychologists aimed\nat understanding the effects of color in mate choice. Color-in-\ncontext theory has six core premises. First, color is argued to be\nnot merely of aesthetic value but rather carries symbolic mean-\ning and may have a utility function as well. Second, the percep-\ntion of a color affects psychological functioning in line with the\nmeaning of that color. For instance, if a certain color carries\npositive connotations, then it will evoke approach-related psy-\nchological processes. Third, color effects take place largely\noutside of conscious awareness (i.e., they are automatic).\nFourth, color meanings are derived from both innate prefer-\nences and learning (culture). These are not seen as mutually\nexclusive processes: instead, the latter builds upon the former\nand may even extend the association between color and mean-\ning beyond biological signals to artificial displays and orna-\nmentation, as in clothing and cosmetics. An example of the\nformer would be reddening of the skin that can potentially cue\nsexual receptivity in females (Elliot & Maier, 2012), whereas\nthe latter can be exemplified by women wearing a red dress to\nsignal interest in casual sex (Elliot & Pazda, 2012; also see\nBeall & Tracy, 2013). Fifth, it is postulated that color influ-\nences not only affect (e.g., excitement and attraction; anxiety\nand fear), cognition (e.g., flexible global processing; narrow\nrigid processing) and behavior (e.g., approach behavior; avoid-\nance behavior), but that a reverse effect also exists: affective,\ncognitive, and behavioral processes impact on color perception\n(e.g., Bubl, Kern, Ebert, Bach, & van Elst, 2010). Finally, color\ncan encompass diverse meanings in different contexts and\n1 Department of Experimental and Applied Psychology, Vrije Universiteit\nAmsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands\n2 Division of Psychology, Faculty of Natural Sciences, University of Stirling,\nStirling, UK\nCorresponding Author:\nLeonard S.

The ruby red\nsurroundings of the Red Light District invite the perceiver to\napproach, whereas the flashing red lights of the fire brigade\nwarn perceivers to keep their distance. Elliot and Maier (2012)\nargue that, in a similar way, red can undermine intellectual\nperformance in the achievement domain (Elliot, Maier, Moller,\nFriedman, & Meinhardt, 2007; Maier, Elliot, & Lichtenfeld,\n2008) but can enhance attractiveness in the affiliation domain\n(e.g., Elliot & Niesta, 2008; Niesta Kayser, Elliot, & Feltman,\n2010). It is this affiliation context, more specifically the mating\ncontext in which men evaluate women's attractiveness, which\nforms the focus of this paper.\nEmpirical Evidence for the Red Effect in Human Mate\nPreferences\nBackground color. In their seminal work, Elliot and Niesta\n(2008) demonstrated that the color red has a significant impact\non opposite-sex ratings of attractiveness. Across four experi-\nments they found that a black-and-white photo of a woman in\nfront of a red background was deemed more attractive and\nsexually desirable by men, and participants wanted to engage\nin more sexual behavior with the woman, than the same woman\nin front of a white, gray, or green background. Schwarz and\nSinger (2013) extended research on the red effect by distin-\nguishing women of reproductive age from menopausal women\nby showing men a photograph of a young woman versus an\nolder woman in front of a red or white background. No support\nfor the red effect was found for physical attractiveness ratings\nfor either the old or young woman. However, the young woman\nin the red condition received higher sexual attractiveness rat-\nings compared to the same woman in the white condition.\nMoreover, Elliot, Tracy, Pazda, and Beall (2013) presented\npreliminary evidence for the potential universality of the red\neffect in human mate preferences in a relatively isolated com-\nmunity in Burkina Faso. In this study, the stimulus woman in\nthe red condition was deemed more attractive and increased\nmen's willingness to meet and court her. However, there was\nno significant difference in the willingness to have sexual inter-\ncourse with the woman, or in the perceived sexual interest of\nthe woman. Lastly, Young (2015) presented participants with\n40 images to investigate the influence of baseline attractiveness\non the red effect. The red effect emerged for female faces\nprerated as attractive but not for unattractive female faces using\ngray and blue as contrast colors.\nClothing color. Most studies investigating color effects on attrac-\ntiveness ratings have manipulated the clothing color of the\ntarget. Across studies, mixed results have been obtained. Elliot\nand Niesta (2008: Study 5) found that a stimulus woman\ndressed in a red shirt received higher ratings on perceived\nattractiveness, sexual desire, desired sexual behavior, and will-\ningness to date and spend money on the woman compared to\nthe same woman dressed in a blue shirt. Providing additional\ninsight into color effects, Roberts, Owen, and Havlicek (2010)\ncompared red clothing with five contrast colors: black, white,\nyellow, blue, and green employing a within-participant design.\nIn Study 1, stimulus women in red clothing were not signifi-\ncantly different from black or blue clothing in terms of the\nattractiveness ratings received by men. However, women\ndressed in red apparel received higher attractiveness evalua-\ntions by men rating photographs than women in green, yellow,\nand white colors. Similarly, in Study 2, women wearing red\nshirts did not receive higher attractiveness ratings compared to\nblack, blue, and green contrast colors but were significantly\ndifferent from yellow and white shirts. Importantly, in Study\n3, it was demonstrated that clothing color has psychological\neffects not only on perceivers but also on wearers. Women in\nred clothes may feel more desirable and consequently behave\ndifferently than women wearing other colors, underlining the\nimportance of distinguishing perceiver from wearer effects\nwhen investigating the red effect. Gu\u00b4\na photograph of a young woman in a red, white, blue, or green\nshirt. Higher attractiveness scores were obtained for the woman\nin a red shirt compared to the same woman in green or blue\nshirts. However, there was no significant difference between\nthe red and the white condition. Similarly, Pazda, Elliot, and\nGreitemeyer (2012) demonstrated higher attractiveness evalua-\ntions and heightened sexual desire by men for a woman in a red\nshirt compared to the same woman in a green shirt. The authors\nreported in a later study (Pazda et al., 2014) that the woman in a\nred knee-length dress received significantly higher attractive-\nness ratings compared to the white knee-length dress. Yet, no\nsignificant difference on the attractiveness measure was found\nbetween the red and the black dress. Wen, Zuo, Wu, Sun, and\nLiu (2014) investigated sexual dimorphism as a potential mod-\nerator of the red effect. In their study, feminine women dressed\nin red did receive significantly higher ratings on sexual attrac-\ntiveness compared to the same women dressed in white or blue\napparel. Masculine women did not differ over color conditions.\nOverall, there were no significant differences in general attrac-\ntiveness when presenting men with pictures of women in red,\nwhite, or blue clothing. In an experiment by Lynn, Giebelhausen,\nGarcia, and Patumanon (2016), no red effect was found in a\nlarge (N \u00bc 1,075) online experiment using a hypothetical tip-\nping scenario. In fact, men tipped the waitress in red clothing\nsignificantly less than the waitress in black, whereas no signif-\nicant difference was found between red and white shirts. Also,\nthere were no significant differences in attractiveness ratings\nfor the waitress in red, white, or black apparel.\nMoving beyond attractiveness ratings, Niesta Kayser et al.\n(2010) showed in a laboratory study that men asked women\nwearing a red shirt more intimate questions and sat closer to\nwhere a woman in red was expected to sit, compared with\nwomen wearing green or blue shirts.\nGu\u00b4\neguen (2012a) extended these laboratory-based findings\nto the field: hitchhiking women in red clothing were offered\nmore rides than women dressed in other colors. Gu\u00b4\neguen and\nJacob (2013) performed another field study to find out if\nwomen would receive more responses to their online personal\nprofile if they wore red compared to five other colors, which\nwas indeed the case. In another field study, men were found to\n2 Evolutionary Psychology\ngive waitresses higher tips when they were dressed in red com-\npared to other colors (Gu\u00b4\nsignaling function of red, it appears the red-attraction link is\nmediated by sexual receptivity, where women choosing to pres-\nent themselves in red clothing are regarded to be sexually\nreceptive and have more sexual intent than women in white,\ngreen, or blue clothing (Gu\u00b4\nGreitemeyer, 2012). However, whereas Pazda, Elliot, and Grei-\ntemeyer (2014) found higher sexual receptivity ratings for a\nwoman in red versus the same woman in white, ratings for red,\nand black did not differ significantly.\nFace and body coloration. Research investigating the red effect on\nattractiveness has also considered facial coloration. Redness in\nwomen's faces is preferred by men as these are rated to be\nhealthier (Re, Whitehead, Xiao, & Perrett, 2011; Stephen,\nCoetzee, Law Smith, & Perrett, 2009) and more attractive\n(Re et al., 2011) than unrubified female faces. Similarly, red-\nness in women's facial lips enhanced the apparent femininity\nand attractiveness of female faces to male participants (Stephen\n& McKeegan, 2010). In a more applied setting, Gu\u00b4\neguen\n(2012c) examined the effect of lipstick in two field studies.\nWomen who wore red lipstick were approached by more men\nin a bar compared to the brown lipstick or no lipstick condition,\nwhereas red and pink lipstick were not significantly different.\nSimilarly, women with red lipstick were approached by men\nsooner than women in the no lipstick condition. Gu\u00b4\neguen and\nJacob (2012) also found that women with red lipstick received\ntips more frequently than women with brown lipstick or no\nlipstick, with no significant difference between red and pink\nlipstick. The amount of tips women received were higher for\nwomen in the red lipstick condition compared to the no lipstick\ncondition. Furthermore, women with a red hair color (Gu\u00b4\neguen,\n2012d) did not receive more tips than women with either blond,\nbrown, or black hair color. Finally, contrary to the suggestion\nby Morris (1967), research found that red vulval skin color did\nnot increase men's sexual attraction compared to pale pink,\nlight pink, or dark pink contrast colors (Johns, Hargrave, &\nObject color. To our knowledge only one study has investigated\nthe effect of nearby red objects to women's attractiveness. Lin\n(2014) found that women with red laptops were significantly\nmore attractive and had more sex appeal than women with\nblack, silver, or blue laptops. Furthermore, women with red\nlaptops enhanced men's desired sexual activity with the woman\ncompared to women with silver laptops. No significant differ-\nences were found on the desired sexual activity measure\nbetween red, black, and blue laptops.\nStrategic Clothing Color Preference\nElliot and Pazda (2012) demonstrated that women are more\nlikely to choose to wear red when imagining being interested\nin casual sex, and more likely to advertise themselves in red\nclothing on their web profile when indicating desire for casual\nsexual relations compared to women who do not express such\ndesires. Incidentally, in this study black is by far the most\npreferred clothing color in both the casual sex web profiles and\nthe nonsexual profiles. However, the preference for black\nclothing does not shift contingent on women's desires. Simi-\nlarly, women expecting to converse with an attractive versus a\nnonattractive man were more likely to choose to wear red\nclothing rather than green clothing and more likely to wear red\nclothing over blue clothing when expecting to converse with an\nattractive man versus an attractive woman (Elliot, Greitemeyer,\n& Pazda, 2013). These findings are corroborated by a study by\nNiesta Kayser, Agthe, and Maner (2016) where significantly\nmore red was displayed by women expecting to meet an attrac-\ntive versus an unattractive man. The women also displayed a\nlarger quantity of red and more conspicuous red in the former\ncondition. In line with these studies, Prokop and Hromada\n(2013) report that women indicated a preference for red cloth-\ning in situations where the probability of meeting a potential\nmate was high (e.g., going to a party or on a date) compared to\nsituations where the chance of meeting a potential mate is low\n(e.g., working in the garden or visiting grandparents). Recently,\nsome research has also investigated the effect of fertility status\non clothing color preferences. Beall and Tracy (2013) found\nthat women wearing red or pink were substantially more likely\nto be at the high conception risk phase of the menstrual cycle as\ncompared to women not wearing these colors (for a critical\ndiscussion, see Gelman, 2013). According to Tracy and Beall\n(2014), the red-dress effect may be moderated by weather con-\nditions and they found that fertility is most predictive of pink or\nred clothing choice during colder but not warmer weather.\nProkop and Hromada (2013) did not find support for the\ncycle-phase red effect using the counting method to determine\nthe menstrual phase of women. Eisenbruch, Simmons, and\nRoney (2015), however, used hormonal measurements to\nassess women's ovulatory timing. Their results supported the\ncycle phase effect for red clothing preferences.\nSexual Strategies in Men\nThus far it seems that the physical attractiveness ratings of red\nhave been examined without paying attention to the potential\nrole of sexual strategies. Buss and Schmitt (1993) proposed in\ntheir sexual strategies theory that men have evolved distinct\npsychological mechanisms that underlie short-term (ST) and\nlong-term (LT) strategies. A man acting on his ST mating\ndesires may benefit reproductively by attempting to inseminate\nmultiple fertile women. Men pursuing a LT strategy, however,\nmay benefit in reproductive terms by attempting to monopolize\none woman's lifetime reproductive capacity so as to increase\ntheir paternity certainty over any conceived children. In line\nwith this argument, men typically indicate a preference for\novert sexual availability in women when pursuing a ST mating\nstrategy (e.g., Oliver & Sedikides, 1992; Regan & Berscheid,\nargued to solve the ST adaptive problem for men of gaining\nsexual access swiftly and easily, without displaying\nPeperkoorn et al. 3\ncommitment first. In contrast, men who desire a LT partner\nprefer women who are sexually exclusive. Their restricted sex-\nual access to other men would solve the LT adaptive problem\nof paternity certainty while investing heavily in one's mate and\npotential offspring.\nST Red and LT White\nGiven that red is commonly associated with lust, love, sexu-\nality, and passion (Elliot & Maier, 2012) and that sexual\nreceptivity has been argued to act as a mediator between red\nand sexual attraction, we expect the signaling function of red\nto be especially pronounced in a ST mating context. For\nexample, studies described above indicate that women might\nuse red clothing to advertise a potential interest in casual sex\nby choosing to wear red when imagining being interested in\nsex and actually advertising themselves in red clothing on\ncasual sex dating websites (Elliot & Pazda, 2012). Indeed,\nPazda et al. (2012) predict that the red effect is specific to ST\nmate evaluations, and Schwarz and Singer (2013) state that\nthe red effect should be much stronger in a ST versus LT\nmating context.\nWhile such cultural and social associations involving the\ncolor red have been much discussed in recent studies\nreviewed above, other associations with different colors do\nexist and are worthy of brief consideration, not least because\nthey are relevant to alternative conditions in tests of the red-\nattraction effect, especially to studies exploring context-\ndependent effects. For example, the color white can also be\nargued to serve an important signaling function. In several\nsocieties, white symbolizes chastity, purity, high virtues, and\n``whiter than white'' (very pure, honest, and moral), ``pure as\nthe driven snow,'' and ``white lie.'' Interestingly, John Lyd-\ngate's poem King Henry VI's Triumphal Entry into London\ncladde in white, in tokne off clennesse, Lyche pure virgynes''\n(loosely translated as, ``All were dressed in white, as a sym-\nbol of their purity, as if they were pure virgins''). From about\nthe middle of the 18 century, white became widespread as a\nsymbol of virginity in western societies (Monger, 2004). Phi-\nlip (2011) reports that the word ``white'' is the main collocate\nof the word ``wedding.'' Indeed, in modern western societies\n(including those tested in this paper) brides typically wear a\nwhite gown. In addition, the white Japanese wedding kimono,\nshiro-maku (translated as white and pure, respectively) sym-\nbolizes innocence (Dennis-Bryan, Hodgson, & Lockley,\n2008). However, in other cultures (e.g., in China, Vietnam,\nand India), women typically select a red wedding dress\ninstead of a white dress, symbolizing pure love, happiness,\nand good fortune (Dennis-Bryan et al., 2008; Hutchings,\na LT mate, an important trait for males to consider for a\nwoman would be premarital chastity and sexual fidelity,\ngiven the problem of paternity uncertainty (e.g., Buss,\npay for women to signal these traits in a LT context (see,\ne.g., Fisher, 2013). Based on this argument, we might pre-\ndict that in many societies (especially many western coun-\ntries), men pursuing a LT sexual strategy would find women\nin white more attractive due to the color's associations with\npurity and chastity. Thus, we select the color white as our\ncontrast color to red as this color is likely to be associated\nwith LT interest.\nApart from red and white, other colors have been argued to\ncarry important color-meaning associations in affiliation con-\ntexts that may potentially impact opposite-sex evaluations\n(e.g., Pazda et al., 2014 have investigated the influence of the\ncolor black). In Color-in-context Theory (Elliot & Maier,\n2012), no argument derived from evolutionary theory is pro-\nvided for a ``black effect.'' Rather, Pazda et al. (2014) argue\nthat, in modern societies, black clothing is seen as fashionable\nand wearing such fashionable clothes is seen as attractive\n(hence the term, ``little black dress''). Indeed, fashionableness\nwas found to be a mediator for the link between black and\nattractiveness (Pazda et al., 2014). Given that black is also seen\nas attractive in modern western societies, we select this color as\nour control color as it should not differ contingent on the tem-\nporal context.\nResearch Overview\nThe current research aims to conceptually replicate the red\neffect while distinguishing between short- and LT mating moti-\nvations. Elliot and Niesta (2008) were the first to investigate\nthe red-attraction effect. Hence, we selected this study to assess\nattractiveness ratings of a woman dressed in white, black, or\nred clothing. However, to make a sharper distinction between\nattractiveness and sexual attractiveness, we chose to ask parti-\ncipants more explicit questions used by Schwarz and Singer\n(2013) to assess sexual attractiveness. Lastly, Elliot and Pazda\n(2012) were the first to use a scenario methodology to examine\nthe red effect. In the present study, we use a similar scenario\ndesign that allows us to manipulate short- and LT mating\nmotivations.\nAs argued above, we expect a signaling function of red to be\nespecially pronounced in a ST mating context. In contrast,\nwhite is associated with chastity, purity, and innocence, and\nwe therefore expect a potential signaling function of white in a\nLT mating context. Black has been argued to signal fashion-\nableness and as such it might not be very useful in differentiat-\ning between a LT and ST mating context. This leads us to the\nfollowing hypotheses:\n1. Women in red are considered the most attractive in both\nmating contexts1 (ST, LT) in comparison to black and\nwhite, but especially in a ST context.\n2. Women in white are considered more attractive in a LT\ncontext than in a ST context.\n3. Women in black are considered equally attractive in a\nST context as in a LT context.\n4 Evolutionary Psychology\n4. In a LT context, women in white are considered to be\nmore faithful in comparison to women in red or black.\n5. In a ST context, women in red are considered more\nsexually attractive than women in white or black.\nExperiment 1\nIn Experiment 1, we tested the above hypotheses in a Dutch\nstudent sample using a picture of a woman in a red, black, or\nwhite shirt. Temporal context was manipulated using a sce-\nnario methodology in which participants were randomly\nassigned to either the ST or LT mating condition.\nMethod\nParticipants\nTwo hundred and six male participants participated in this\nhad the Dutch nationality only (others include Moroccan\nDutch, Turkish Dutch, Surinam Dutch). The sample was\nrestricted to individuals who indicated that they were hetero-\nsexual (n \u00bc 204) or bisexual (n \u00bc 2) in orientation. Excluding\nthese two bisexual participants does not alter the conclusions\n(see Online Supplementary Material 1A). Participants were\nrecruited at the main building of the Vrije Universiteit Amster-\ndam and received 2 compensation for their participation. This\nexperiment was approved by the psychology ethics committee\nof the university.\nDesign, Procedure, and Materials\nParticipants were randomly assigned to one of six between-\nsubject conditions2 (mating context: ST, LT; color: red, black,\nwhite): ST-red (n \u00bc 34), ST-black (n \u00bc 37), ST-white (n \u00bc 34),\nAfter providing informed consent, participants were given a\ntablet (Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1) and a manila folder con-\ntaining the photo of the woman. Participants were told that the\nexperiment concerned first impressions of other people. Parti-\ncipants were instructed not to open the folder until told to do so\nin the questionnaire on the tablet. They could look at the photo\nfor as long as they felt necessary and completed the experiment\nindividually. Upon completion students returned the tablet and\nmanila folder, filled out the reimbursement form, were paid,\nand debriefed (via e-mail after data completion had finished).3\nThe scenarios describing the allocated ST and LT mating\ncontexts were based on Elliot and Pazda's (2012) scenario\ndescriptions, as follows:\nST scenario: Imagine that you have decided to make use\nof a dating website because you've heard that this is a\ngood way to find a one-night stand. After indicating\nyour preferences you've found a match. Open the\nfolder and view the photo of the woman with whom\nyou have a match and then answer the following\nquestions.\nLT scenario: Imagine that you have decided to make use\nof a dating website because you've heard that this is a\ngood way to find a partner for a committed relation-\nship. After indicating your preferences you've found a\nmatch. Open the folder and view the photo of the\nwoman with whom you have a match and then answer\nthe following questions.\nThe female photo was selected from the webpage of Amer-\nican Apparel (http://www.americanapparel.net). Our choice of\nwhich specific white, red, or black color to use was based on\nthe color labels provided by the American Apparel webpage as\nrepresenting that particular color in the shirt chosen. The pic-\nture was cropped (16 cm width \u00c2 9 cm height) to include only\nthe head and upper torso (from above the bust) of an attractive\nyoung woman with brown hair, wearing a plain white T-shirt\n(with a round neck) and having a neutral facial expression. The\nbackground color of the cropped image was a very light gray\nand the surrounding unprinted area had a plain white color of\nthe paper itself.

The photo was sent to a professional\nphoto editing company to digitally color the shirt in red and\nblack. The image area of the colored T-shirt was approximately\n8 cm in width and 2.5\u00ad3 cm in height.

The instruc-\ntions and questions were presented in Dutch. All participants\nevaluated the woman's attractiveness with a scale composed of\nthe same 2 items used in Elliot and Niesta (2008): ``how attrac-\ntive do you think this woman is?'' and ``how pretty do you\nthink this woman is?'' (a \u00bc .88). Students assigned to the ST\nscenario answered questions about sexual attraction, using two\nof the three sexual attraction items used by Schwarz and Singer\n(2013): ``how much do you want to be intimate with this per-\nson?'' and ``how much do you want to have sex with this\nperson?'' (a \u00bc .89). In contrast, those assigned to the LT\nPeperkoorn et al. 5\nscenario answered two questions pertaining to the woman's\nperceived faithfulness: ``how faithful do you think this person\nis in a relationship?'' and ``how polygamous do you think this\nperson is in a relationship?'' Internal consistency was unaccep-\ntably low (a \u00bc .05), possibly due to the fact that the word\n``polygamous'' is rarely used in colloquial language. In fact,\ntwo students indicated to the researcher that they were unclear\nabout this question. Hence, only the first item was used in our\nanalyses. Furthermore, in line with Elliot and Niesta's (2008)\nprocedure, participants indicated to what extent the rating of\nthe woman's attractiveness was influenced by (a) the woman's\nfacial expression, (b) the woman's clothing, or (c) the color of\nthe woman's shirt, to probe for respondents' awareness of the\neffect of color. Irrespective of condition, all participants\nresponded to the attitude facet of the revised Sociosexual\nOrientation Inventory (SOI-R) to control for differing sexual\nexample item is ``sex without love is OK'' scored from 1\n(strongly disagree) to 9 (strongly agree). After answering the\nmain questions, participants provided demographic informa-\ntion (such as age, sexual orientation, relationship status, and\nbirth country) in addition to some items serving exploratory\npurposes (i.e., participant's height, weight, and muscularity),\nwhich are not discussed here. All statistical analyses were con-\nResults and Discussion\nBefore conducting the analyses, one extreme outlier on the\nattractiveness scale was removed during preliminary data\nscreening (>3 interquartile range [IQR]). This single extreme\nscore may have a disproportionate impact on the outcome of\nthe data analysis. However, the removal of data points may also\nchange the outcome of the analysis. For this reason, we ran the\nanalysis both including and excluding the extreme outlier.\nIncluding this single outlier does not alter the conclusions (see\nOnline Supplementary Material 1B).\nA 3 (color condition: red, black, white) \u00c2 2 (mating condi-\ntion: ST, LT) between-group analysis of variance (ANOVA) on\nperceived attractiveness was used to assess the first three\nhypotheses. The analysis revealed a nonsignificant Color \u00c2\neffect for condition was also nonsignificant, F(1, 199) \u00bc .86,\nmore attractive compared with those in the red (M \u00bc 7.06,\nHowever, Tukey post hoc tests4 did not reveal a significant\ndifference, both p > .075. Results are shown in Figure 1.\nLimiting the sample to other age-groups (i.e., including\nparticipants up to age 35, 30, and 25) did not result in the\npredicted red effect (see Online Supplementary Material 1C).\nContrary to our predictions, the woman in red was thus not\ndeemed the most attractive overall (Hypothesis 1), nor was\nthere a difference in attractiveness ratings between the LT\ncontext and ST context for the woman in white (Hypothesis\n2). In line with Hypothesis 3, women in black were judged\nequally attractive across both mating conditions.\nTo assess whether participants in the LT mating condition\nconsider the woman in white to be more faithful in comparison\nto the woman in red or black (Hypothesis 4), a one-way\nANOVA was conducted with perceived faithfulness as the\ndependent variable.

Higher attractiveness ratings were not\nfound for the woman in red. Instead, a marginally significant\nwhite effect on attractiveness emerged. No difference was\nfound between mating conditions for the woman in white, con-\ntrary to our hypothesis. Women in white were not perceived to\nbe more faithful in the LT condition nor were women in red\nconsidered more sexually attractive in the ST condition. Parti-\ncipants did indicate, however, that color had the least influence\non their evaluations of the woman. This prompted us to repli-\ncate the experiment and further explore the robustness of the\nred effect.\nExperiment 2\nIn Experiment 2, we aimed to replicate Experiment 1 while\nchanging the population from Dutch to American participants\nand changing the medium through which the survey was admi-\nnistered, from a tablet to an online crowdsourcing service:\nAmazon's Mechanical Turk (https://www.mturk.com), which\nhas been shown to generate high-quality data (e.g., Buhrmester,\nmore, as M-Turk does not by itself differentiate by participant\nsex, we devised an additional hypothesis which involved\nfemale participants rating female photographs and reported\nfeelings of jealousy. It should be noted, however, that our main\nfocus is on opposite-sex ratings, hence we will not discuss\nsame-sex effects here (see Online Supplementary Material 2E\nand 2F for the results on women rating the female photograph).\nMethod\nParticipants\nstudy. Participants were predominantly U.S. American (85.8%\nU.S. Americans, 3% other, and 11.1% unspecified. Participants\naccessed the experiment through Amazon's Mechanical Turk's\nchannel via Crowdflower (www.crowdflower.com) and\nreceived US$0.25 for their contribution.\nDesign, Procedure, and Materials\nAs in Experiment 1, male participants were randomly\nassigned to one of six between-subject conditions: ST-red\nstudy was approved by the psychology ethics committee of\nthe lead author's university.\nThe welcome screen presented the consent form and\nexplained the experiment was about first impressions. After\nreading the scenario, respondents were presented with the same\nphoto of the woman from Experiment 1 and could look at the\nphoto for as long as they felt necessary (display resolution:\ndescribed in Experiment 1 was changed to accommodate for\nthe different presentation of the female photo: ``Click further to\nsee the photo of the woman with whom you have a match and\nproceed to the following questions.''\nMeasures\nAll participants evaluated the woman's attractiveness with the\nsame 2 items used in the previous experiment (Cronbach's a \u00bc\n.93). Male respondents assigned to the ST scenario answered\nquestions about sexual attraction, the same as those from\nExperiment 1 (a \u00bc .95). Male participants assigned to the LT\nscenario condition received two questions pertaining to the\nwoman's perceived faithfulness: ``how faithful do you think\nthis person is in a committed relationship?'' and ``how likely\nis this person to have an affair while in a committed relation-\nship?'' Note that we changed the second question in this experi-\nment as compared to Experiment 1 to avoid possible confusion\nabout the meaning of the question. Internal consistency for this\nscale was satisfactory (a \u00bc .72) and so both items were com-\nbined in a single measure. The awareness probe and the demo-\ngraphical items were the same as in Experiment 1. Participants\nwere asked to indicate the woman's shirt color to control for\ncolor blindness (out of the original 201 male participants\n95.02% of men correctly identified the woman's shirt color).\nThose who did not correctly indicate the color were excluded\nfrom analyses. In contrast to Experiment 1, we did not employ\nthe revised sociosexual inventory (Penke & Asendorpf, 2008)\nto assess sexual attitudes, due to the need for brevity.\nResults and Discussion\nBefore conducting the analyses, we conducted preliminary data\nscreening and found one extreme outlier on the attractiveness\nscale which was removed from the male analyses (>3 IQR).\nIncluding this outlier does not alter the conclusions (see Online\nSupplementary Material 2A). As in the first experiment, we\nused a 3 (color condition: red, black, white) \u00c2 2 (mating con-\ndition: ST, LT) between-group ANOVA on attractiveness rat-\nings made by men. The analysis revealed a nonsignificant\nmain effect for condition was nonsignificant, F(1, 184) \u00bc .26, p\n\u00bc .611. The main effect for color was also not significant, F(2,\nin red was not considered the most attractive by men5 (Hypoth-\nesis 1), nor was there a significant difference in attractiveness\nratings between the LT context and ST context for the woman\nin white (Hypothesis 2). In support of Hypothesis 3, the woman\nin black was judged equally attractive by males across both\nmating conditions. Results are shown in Figure 2.

The ANOVA was nonsignificant, F(2,\n3.18) was not considered to be significantly more sexually\nattractive than the woman dressed in either black (M \u00bc 6.38,\nIn the awareness probe, color was again viewed as having\nthe least influence of the three factors on men's judgments of\nattractiveness: Mfacial expression\n\u00bc\nt-tests indicated that the rating for color was significantly\nlower than the ratings for the woman's facial expression,\nIn summary, the results for this experiment were again\ninconsistent with our predictions: the woman dressed in red\nwas not rated the most attractive across conditions. No\nsignificant difference was found for the woman in white\nbetween mating contexts. In line with our expectations, there\nwas no difference between mating conditions for the woman in\nblack. However, the woman dressed in white was not perceived\nto be more faithful in the LT context as compared with other\ncolors and the woman in red was not considered more sexually\nattractive in the ST context. Consistent with Experiment 1,\ncolor had the least influence on participant's ratings of the\nwoman.\nExperiment 3\nIn the previous experiments the results did not support the\nexistence of a red effect on mate preferences. Although we\nthink our design provided a fair test of the proposed hypoth-\neses, it could be argued that differences in experimental design\nbetween our experiments and those in the published literature\nwere responsible for null effects. We therefore decided to con-\nduct a replication of a previous experiment that did find results\nindicative of the red effect. We selected experiment 1a in the\npaper by Pazda et al. (2012) because they employed Amazon\nMechanical Turk to obtain participants, thus allowing us to\nfollow an identical procedure. Note that we did not select the\nweb study by Pazda et al. (2014) as in this study a woman was\npresented in a knee-length dress while in Pazda et al. (2012) the\nwoman was presented in a shirt, a style of dress that is more\ncomparable to our present studies. In order to obtain the exact\nquestions and stimulus materials, we contacted the authors\nwho helpfully sent us all necessary materials. Although Pazda\net al. (2012) included only male participants, we did not\nexclude women from this study. This allowed us to compare\npotential sex differences in color effects as well as to further\nexplore the jealousy questions asked in Experiment 2 with a\nlarger sample size. However, we do not discuss the results of\nthe jealousy study below as it is beyond the scope of this paper\n(see Online Supplementary Material 3A for complete results\non female participants) and support the null findings we report\nabove for Experiment 2. Again, we set out to investigate\nopposite-sex red effects and hence we focus here on the repli-\ncation of the Pazda et al. (2012) study, although all results on\nfemale participants are available in Online Supplementary\nMaterial 3A.\nMethod\nParticipants\nstudy.

(2012), male participants were randomly\nassigned to one of two between-subject conditions: red (n \u00bc\nstatistical methodology) and stimulus material was the same as\ndescribed by Pazda et al. (2012). The welcome screen and\ninstructions were provided by the original authors by sending\nus the URL of a forthcoming web study. The participants\nentered a welcome screen, stating that the experiment was on\nfirst impressions and would involve viewing a picture of a\nfemale for 5 s, followed by a questionnaire. The indicated time\nto complete the study was specified to take less than 10 min.\nThe instructions read, ``the next screen will display a picture of\na female. Please look at the picture for 5 s, then proceed with\nthe survey.'' The picture displayed a moderately attractive\nyoung woman with brown hair and a tanned to mid-brown skin\nWe should note that the informed consent form may differ\nbetween surveys, as the policies differ between universities.\nAlso, we employed Qualtrics (www.qualtrics.com) to admin-\nister the survey, whereas Pazda et al. (2012) may have used\nSurveyGizmo (www.surveygizmo.com) as the URL of a forth-\ncoming web study directed to this platform. Finally, we used a\nsubstantially larger sample size (the original Study 1a had n \u00bc\n11 in the red condition and n \u00bc 14 in the white condition).\nMeasures\nAs in the Pazda et al. (2012) study, male participants rated the\nperceived sexual receptivity of the woman on 4 items (i.e.,\n``how sexy is this person acting,'' ``how seductive is this per-\nson,'' ``how flirtatious is this person,'' and ``this person is\ninterested in sex'' summed into a scale a \u00bc .92) using a 1 (not\nat all) to 9 (extremely) scale. Participants were asked to guess\nthe purpose of the experiment and to indicate the woman's shirt\nrectly identified the woman's shirt color, resulting in our sam-\nResults and Discussion\nAn independent samples t-test indicated no effect of color on\nParticipants in the red condition (M \u00bc 3.57, SD \u00bc 1.82) did not\nrate the woman as more receptive than participants in the white\nUL: .07). When asked about the purpose of the experiment, 17\nparticipants mentioned color; however, results did not change\nwhen excluding them from the analyses (see Online Supple-\nmentary Material 3B). The conclusion did not change when\nlimiting the sample to heterosexual participants (see Online\nSupplementary Material 3C), limiting participants to the age\nor controlling for relationship status (see Online Supplemen-\ntary Material 3E).\nFigure 3 depicts a comparison of effect sizes between\nstudies.\nDiscussion\nWe began this study to test for the red effect on attractiveness\nand to further extend the increasing literature by distinguishing\nbetween temporal contexts (ST, LT). Contrary to our expecta-\ntions, participants' judgments did not differ across color con-\nditions. We shall discuss each hypothesis separately in light of\nthe results from the first two experiments.\nFirst, we hypothesized that the woman in red should be rated\nby men as the most attractive compared to the same woman in\nwhite or black, especially so in a ST mating context. The results\nfrom the first two experiments do not support our hypothesis:\nthere is no significant difference between attractiveness ratings\nof the woman in the three different colors. Second, it was\npredicted that women in white would receive higher attractive-\nness ratings in a LT context as opposed to a ST mating context.\nThe results do not provide support for the hypothesis: there is\nno difference between temporal contexts for the woman in\nwhite. Third, the woman in black was expected to be equally\nattractive in a short- or LT context. This expectation is sup-\nported by our results. The aforementioned findings from the\nfirst two hypotheses are at odds with previous research manip-\nulating shirt color where red is contrasted with white and black\nstimulus woman in a red or black shirt was found to be signif-\nicantly more attractive than the same woman dressed in white.\nHowever, other studies also failed to find a significant differ-\nence between attractiveness ratings of a woman dressed in red\nversus white (e.g., Lynn, Giebelhausen, Garcia, Li, & Patuma-\nFourth, we predicted that men in the LT mating context\nwould rate the woman in white to be more faithful than the\nCohen's d\nFigure 3. Comparison of Cohen's d effect sizes contrasting Pazda\nCI for Cohen's d.\nPeperkoorn et al. 9\nsame woman dressed in red or black. We do not find support for\nour hypothesis. To our knowledge, no previous research has\ninvestigated the ``white effect'' on faithfulness so we cannot\ncompare our results with other studies.\nFinally, we hypothesized that in a ST mating context, a\nwoman in red clothing would receive higher sexual attractive-\nness ratings as compared to the same woman in white or black\nclothing. The hypothesis is not supported by the results. Until\nnow, there has been no study investigating sexual attractiveness\nwhere a woman dressed in red is compared with a woman\ndressed in black. However, one recent study by Wen et al.\n(2014) measured sexual attractiveness in men and women rat-\ning the opposite sex in red, blue, and white apparel. The red\neffect on sexual attractiveness emerged for feminine women\nrated by male participants. In addition, higher sexual attractive-\nness ratings have been found in a study manipulating shirt color\nusing blue (Elliot & Niesta, 2008, Study 5) or green (Pazda\net al., 2012, Study 2) as a contrast color. In addition, studies\ninvestigating sexual receptivity (Gu\u00b4\nto be more sexually receptive compared to women in white\nclothing. These studies hint at the possibility that women in\nred clothing would be evaluated as more sexually attractive as\ncompared to women in white clothing; however, we do not find\nsupport for such a prediction.\nThe consistent null findings from our first two studies\nprompted us to conduct a direct replication of a study (Pazda\net al., 2012, Study 1a) that did find support for the red effect in\nmen rating a woman on sexual receptivity. Contrary to Pazda\net al. (2012), we did not find any evidence for the original\nstudy's higher sexual receptivity ratings for the woman in red\nclothing over the woman in white clothing, even though we\nsampled from the same study population, employed identical\nquestions, displayed the same photo materials, utilized the\nsame medium through which to administer the survey, ana-\nlyzed the data using the same statistical tests, and used a sample\nsize (N \u00bc 433) more than 17 times as large than used in the\nThe lack of evidence for a red effect in our three experiments\ntherefore leads us to question the robustness of the red effect in\nhuman mate preferences. Consistent with our results are two\nlarge studies on the red effect in the affiliation domain, which\nalso failed to find evidence of the red effect (i.e., Lynn et al.,\nbeing a reply to Francis (2013) on publication bias in this\nresearch area), although note that Pazda et al. 2014 (N \u00bc\n361) did find support for both a red effect (mediated through\nsexual receptivity) and a black effect (mediated through fash-\nionableness) on attractiveness ratings.\nSmall studies are likely to end up in a file drawer as com-\npared to large studies when they fail to find significant results\n(Button et al., 2013). This may also apply to investigations\nwithin color research into the red effect where many attempts\nmay not have led to publications. Indeed, it would be in line\nwith The ``Many Labs'' Replication Project (Klein et al., 2016),\nwhen significantly stronger effect sizes are found for the\noriginal research group (i.e., the investigators who first\nreported the red effect (Elliot & Niesta, 2008), than publica-\ntions by independent scholars over the next decades. However,\ndifferences in obtained effect sizes between laboratories could\nbe based on methodological variations such as by using differ-\nent chromatic color comparisons or variations in chroma and\nlightness (Elliot, 2015). Conducting research on the psycholo-\ngical effects of color requires understanding of the complex-\nities involved in generating appropriate stimulus materials.\nHowever, it should be noted that such differences should lead\nto increased noise in the data: causing overestimations of the\nred effect at one instance and underestimations of the red effect\nat other instances. It is possible that null findings, in particular,\nare not shared within the scientific community. The value of\nsharing null findings and replicating experiments to arrive at a\nbetter understanding of the influence of color on attractiveness\nhas been illustrated by Seguin and Forstmeier (2012). It has\nbeen presumed in behavioral ecology for some time that red-\ncolor bands affect male courtship rates in zebra finches (Tae-\nniopygia guttata). Seguin and Forstmeier (2012) demonstrate\nwith meta-analytic techniques that the influence of color bands\nappears to be a false positive.\nThe current study has several potential limitations, some of\nwhich are shared by the studies it sought to replicate. In the first\nexperiment, we used a tablet to administer the survey, which\nmight be an unfamiliar way to respond to survey questions on\nmate preferences. Participants in Experiments 1 and 2 could\nlook at the picture for as long as they felt necessary, which\ndiffers from some other studies investigating the red effect\nSinger, 2013) where participants are instructed to look at the\nphoto for 5 s. However, it should be noted that in our close\nreplication, Experiment 3, we used the same procedure as\nPazda et al. (2012) and found no support for the hypothesis.\nWe also believe the theoretical and practical significance of the\nred effect would be limited if the red effect could only emerge\nwith an exposure time of less than 5 s. More studies are how-\never needed to determine if the red effect is bounded by view-\ning time (especially over 5 s). Similarly, in line with previous\nwork, we presented just one female target to investigate the red\neffect in Experiments 1 and 2 (the same target in both experi-\nments), which does not allow us to compare different women\nwho might vary, for instance, in skin tone and hair color. How-\never, it should be noted that also no red effect was found in\nExperiment 3, using a photo of a different woman with a darker\nskin tone (as compared to the woman in the other experiments)\nand that this photo was used before. Future studies may present\nparticipants with a large set of photographs of diverse models\nto control for idiosyncrasies of the depicted models. For\ninstance, a recent study by Young (2015) presented participants\nwith 40 images to investigate the influence of baseline attrac-\ntiveness on the red effect. The red effect emerged for female\nfaces prerated as attractive but not for unattractive female\nfaces. Our Experiments 1 and 2 used a photograph of a woman\nfrom the website of American Apparel. Given that the woman\nis a model, the probability of finding supportive evidence for\n10 Evolutionary Psychology\nthe red effect in these experiments should be higher compared\nto an average looking woman.\nWe also used a between-subject design in which the target\nwoman was seen in different colors by different men, rather\nthan a within-subject design in which the same raters saw the\ntarget in different colors (see, e.g., Roberts et al., 2010). How-\never, it should be noted that other papers reporting significant\nred effects also use between-subject designs, including the\nstudies we sought to conceptually replicate (Experiments 1 &\n2) or closely replicate (Experiment 3). Given the paucity of\ncolor research employing a within-subject design, future\nresearch might benefit from a combination of both designs in\na single paper so as to guarantee good methodological practice.\nEven though we did not find evidence of the red effect in our\nexperiments, there might in fact be a red effect outside the\nlaboratory due to psychological effects on the wearer, possibly\nfeeling more desirable in red and behaving in a more attractive\nWe initially set out to replicate and extend research docu-\nmenting the red effect on attractiveness. To our surprise, how-\never, we found no support for the red effect in our empirical\nstudies. In other words, we did not find support for the premise\nthat color affects psychological functioning in the affiliation\ndomain: the women in red were not deemed more attractive\nthan women in white or black clothing (Experiments 1 and 2)\nor more sexually receptive compared to only white clothing\n(Experiment 3). The finding that the red effect does not emerge\nwhen contrasted with black is a challenge to color-in-context\ntheory, as there is a clear theoretical rationale for a positive red\neffect (rooted in biology and culture), but such an elaborate\nexplanation is lacking for a black effect, which is seen as fash-\nionable and hence attractive (see Pazda et al., 2014). Future\nresearch might benefit from exploring why black clothing does\nnot lead to substantially different effects from red clothing\n(Roberts et al., 2010), and we suggest that it would be desirable\nto incorporate black as a standard control condition in research\non mate preferences and color.\nFuture research might further investigate the robustness of\nthe red effect using large samples. It must be said that the\nsamples for experiments in this research area tend to be small,\ninstigating what is known as the ``winner's curse'' effect (But-\nton et al., 2013). Perhaps it is even worth considering whether\none aspect, such as shirt color, would be predicted a priori to\nhave such a dramatic effect on attractiveness (Cohen's d\nthat if red has an effect on human mate preferences, then it is\nlikely to be small. We also note that in our experiments the\ncolor of clothing was rated as a substantially less important\ntrait than other aspects for attractiveness, such as facial attrac-\ntiveness or clothing.\nIn summary, we did not find empirical support for the red\neffect on attractiveness judgments across three experiments.\nWe therefore call for more empirical research on the red effect\nin romantic contexts, focusing on rigorous hypothesis testing\nrather than exploration. We are hopeful that in time larger\nstudies will be conducted, providing clear answers on the\nrobustness of the red effect on mate preferences. Future\nresearch on the red effect is needed as it has important impli-\ncations for researchers in the domains of sales, advertising\ntions, and fashion (e.g., Ellinwood, 2011), where such findings\nmight have applied value. Finally, we hope that our research\nprovides an incentive for researchers to share their (null) find-\nings, so as to efficiently and effectively allocate resources in\nexamining and understanding our colorful world.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nSupplemental Material\nThe online [appendices/data supplements/etc.] are available at http://\nNotes\n1. Note that we distinguish perceived physical attractiveness from\nsexual attraction in line with Elliot and Niesta (2008) who suggest\nthat the former refers to a positive judgment regarding the target's\nphysical appearance, whereas the latter refers to a further desire,\nbased on this judgment, to become romantically involved with the\nwoman. In this sense, physical attractiveness will be useful infor-\nmation both for men pursuing a short-term mating strategy and for\nthose pursuing a long-term strategy.\n2. The present study aimed to partially replicate and extend the liter-\nature on red effects on attractiveness. Note, however, that by\ntoday's standards the between-subject design we employed in\nExperiments 1 and 2 may have too small a sample size per condi-\ntion, making the design not particularly robust. However, given\nthat the reported effect sizes in previous studies range from\nmedium to large, our sample sizes are still adequate to detect a\nmedium effect if the effect indeed exists (See Online Supplemen-\ntary Material 4 for anticipated power values using G*Power 3.1).\nWe also reflect on this matter in the General Discussion.\n3.
