Factors\naffecting CPF by sex were analyzed using multiple regression analysis.\nResults: All parameters were higher in men than in women. CPF was affected by thorax\nexpansion at the tenth rib, inspiratory muscle strength and forced expiration in 1 s in men, and\nthorax expansion at the tenth rib, inspiratory reserve volume, and expiratory muscle power in\nwomen. A weak negative correlation was observed between CPF and age (p = -0.24, p < 0.05)\nin women.\nConclusions: The factors affecting CPF differed by sex in community-dwelling adults.\n",

Participation was voluntary, and all par-\nticipants provided informed consent. Participants\nwith respiratory illness or missing data were\nexcluded from analysis (Table 1). Sample size was\ndetermined using a power analysis program for sta-\ntistical tests (G*Power 3.1.9.2, Heinrich-Heine-\nUniversity Dusseldorf University, Dusseldorf);\nand an effect size of 0.35, the desired sample size\nwas 55. However, to perform multiple regression\nanalysis, we need more than 90 samples for both\nsexes because we require approximately 10 times\nthe number of explanatory variables to be input.9\nMeasurements of CPF, height, body weight, res-\npiratory function, respiratory muscle strength,\nthoracic excursion, and grip strength were rand-\nomized. All measurements, besides height and\nbody weight, were performed with the partici-\npants sitting upright, the soles of their feet touch-\ning the floor, and their heads and necks in a\nneutral position.\nCough peak flow measurement\nTo measure CPF, a face mask was attached to a\npeak flow meter (Assess Peak Flow Meter\nUSA).4,5 Peak flow was measured during peak\nvoluntary coughing from maximal inspiratory\nlevel in the face mask. All participants were\ninstructed to cough with maximal effort. Three\nmeasurements were performed, with the highest\nvalue adopted for analysis.\nRespiratory function measurement\nRespiratory function tests were conducted with an\nelectronic spirometer (SpiroShift SP-470, Fukuda\nDenshi, Tokyo, Japan). The following parameters\nwere measured: peak expiratory flow (PEF), vital\ncapacity (VC), forced vital capacity (FVC), forced\nexpiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1\n), inspiratory\nreserve volume (IRV), expiratory reserve volume\n(ERV), and inspiratory capacity (IC).\nRespiratory muscle strength measurement\nRespiratory muscle strength was ascertained by\nmeasuring maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP)\nas an indicator of inspiratory muscle strength and\nmaximum expiratory pressure (MEP) as an indi-\ncator of expiratory muscle strength.10 As with res-\npiratory function tests, measurements were\nconducted with an electronic spirometer (Spiro\nShift SP-470, Fukuda Denshi), to which a nose\nclip was attached and a mouthpiece was affixed.\nThoracic excursion measurement\nThoracic excursion was measured with a thoracic\nexcursion measurement device (T.K.K. 3345,\nTakei Scientific Instruments Co. Ltd., Niigata,\nJapan). After 30 s of quiet breathing, participants\nwere verbally instructed to perform maximum\ninspiration and maximal expiration. The differ-\nence in thoracic circumference between maxi-\nmum inspiration and maximum expiration was\ndefined as thoracic excursion. Measurements\nwere taken at the axilla, the xiphoid process, and\nthe tenth rib level.\nTable 1. Participants' basic characteristics.\nMen\nWomen\np value\nA Yawata, A Tsubaki et al.\njournals.sagepub.com/home/tar 429\nGrip strength measurement\nGrip strength, an indicator of general muscle\nstrength,11 was measured with a baseline hydrau-\nlic hand dynamometer, Nihon 3B Scientific, Inc,\nNiigata, Japan). Participants gripped the\ndynamometer with a neutral wrist position while\nseated upright with the shoulders in a neutral\nposition and the knees flexed at 90\u00b0. During\nmeasurement, the participants were encouraged\nto exert maximum grip strength. Measurements\nwere performed twice for both hands, with the\nhighest value adopted for analysis.\nStatistical processing\nMen and women have been reported to exhibit\nanatomical differences in the larynx and to have\ndifferent breathing patterns7; therefore, we ana-\nlyzed men and women separately. Fifteen male\nparticipants demonstrated a ceiling effect in CPF\nmeasurement and were therefore excluded. Thus,\nfor analysis, we ultimately incorporated 87 men\ning normality tests using the Smirnov-Grubbs\noutlier test, measured values were compared\nbetween men and women. Items demonstrating\nnormality were analyzed with Welch's t test, while\nitems not demonstrating normality were analyzed\nusing the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.12\nStepwise multiple regression analyses for factors\naffecting CPF were performed separately for men\nand women. Instances where predictive formulas\nusing height and body weight are represented\nwith formulas using other variables, such as res-\npiratory function8 and respiratory muscle\nstrength,9 involve covariance.13 In this study,\nCPF was used as the dependent variable in multi-\nple regression analysis, and the explanatory vari-\nables were PEF; VC; FVC; FEV1\nMIP; MEP; and thoracic excursion, as measured\nat the axilla, the xiphoid process, and the tenth\nrib, as well as grip strength. Age, height, and\nweight were excluded as explanatory variables\nbecause these were involved in the formulas for\ncalculating other variables.\nThe relationships between age and MIP, MEP,\nand CPF were analyzed using Pearson's rank\ncorrelation coefficient. Statistical analysis was\nperformed using Excel Statistics 2015 (Social\nInformation Service Co., Ltd., Nishi-Shinjuku,\nShinjuku-ku, Tokyo) with the level of statistical\nEthical considerations\nThis study was approved by the Niigata University\nof Health and Welfare Institutional Review Board\nexplanation of the study, and written informed\nconsent was obtained.\nResults\nAll items demonstrated a normal distribution,\nexcept for body weight in women.

Men were found to demon-\nstrate significantly higher values than women on\nall measurement items except for age. In terms of\nfactors affecting CPF, thoracic excursion at the\ntenth rib was adopted for both men and women,\nMIP and FEV1\nwere adopted for men only, while\nIRV and MEP were adopted for women only;\nthus, the factors affecting CPF were found to dif-\nfer between men and women. A significant,\nalthough weak, relationship between CPF and\nage was observed only in women.\nIn comparisons of measurement items between\nmen and women, men demonstrated significantly\ngreater height and body weight than women.\nHeight and body weight affect respiratory function\nand respiratory muscle strength;10 this may explain\nwhy men demonstrated significantly higher values\nfor respiratory function and respiratory muscle\nstrength than did women. Furthermore, the sig-\nnificantly greater height and body weight in men\nthan in women may also be the reason for the\nlarger cross-sectional muscle area and greater mus-\ncle force in men than in women. Additionally, the\nfact that thoracic excursion expands and contracts\nthe thorax by the action of the respiratory muscles\nmay be why men, with their larger cross-sectional\nmuscle area and greater muscle force, demon-\nstrated significantly higher values for thoracic\nexcursion than did women.\nTable 2.

Correlation between cough peak flow and\nage in women.\nA Yawata, A Tsubaki et al.\njournals.sagepub.com/home/tar 431\nBased on their functions, respiratory muscles are\ndivided into inspiratory muscles and expiratory\nmuscles. When inspiratory muscles contract, the\ndiaphragm descends towards the abdomen, while\nthe anterior chest expands longitudinally and then\nhorizontally as the ribs are lowered, thus expanding\nthe lungs.14 Contraction of expiratory muscles\nincreases abdominal pressure, which is considered\nto aid expiration.15 Since it is useful to determine\nand treat the problematic procedures in cough-\ning,16 we examined the factors affecting CPF from\nthe perspective of kinematics. The methods used to\nmeasure maximum inspiratory pressure (PImax)\nand maximum expiratory pressure (PEmax) were\nbased on guidelines of the American Thoracic\nSociety. We believe that one of the reasons that our\nobserved values were smaller than previous reports\nis due to the geographic origin of our study sample.\nChen and Kuo17 established that Asian people have\nlower muscle strength than European people.\nThe single factor affecting CPF in both men and\nwomen was thoracic excursion at the tenth rib.\nThe diaphragm, which is the main inspiratory\nmuscle, and the transverse abdominal muscle, the\ninternal abdominal oblique muscle, and the exter-\nnal abdominal oblique muscle, which are the\nmain expiratory muscles, are attached at the tenth\nrib. During inspiration, excursion of the tenth rib\nresults in extension of the attached transverse\nabdominal muscle, abdominal oblique muscles,\nand rectus abdominis. This extension, in turn,\nincreases the tension of these muscles, which is\nconsidered to reflect larger inspired volumes dur-\ning the first phase of cough and increase the mus-\ncle force exerted during expiration.\nHowever, other factors affecting CPF differed\nbetween men and women. MIP and FEV1\nwere\ninfluential in men, while IRV and MEP played a\nrole in women. Men tend to exhibit abdominal\nbreathing7 and are thus considered to exert dia-\nphragm strength easily. During deep inspiration in\ncoughing, the diaphragm functions intensely and\nexpands the thorax, thereby triggering inspiratory\naction,14 which may explain the role of MIP.\nDiaphragm function is also correlated with inspir-\natory muscle strength and increases the inspired\nvolume during inspiration.14 Inspiration early dur-\ning the coughing process is necessary for increas-\ning total lung capacity, and a high lung capacity\nimproves the expiratory flow rate.7 Therefore, it is\nplausible that the tendency of men to exhibit\nabdominal breathing permits rapid reduction of\nintrathoracic volume and complete expiration of\nERV, which explains the role of FEV1\n.\nFor women, who predominantly exhibit thoracic\nbreathing,7 deep inspiration by primarily using\nthe strength of the diaphragm is difficult; thus, it\nis plausible that deep inspiration in women also\nuses the activity of the intercostal muscles. The\nfact that the intercostal muscles exhibit inspira-\ntory action and increase inspiratory volume15\nmay explain the role of IRV in affecting CPF.\nFurthermore, rapid expiration using the abdomi-\nnal muscles may be difficult for women, whose\nabdominal muscles exhibit less action during\nexpiration than do those of men.7 The internal\nintercostal muscles exhibit not only inspiratory\naction, but also forced expiratory action.15 During\nvoluntary coughing, these muscles are mobilized,\nthereby increasing intra-abdominal pressure and\nTable 3.

The fact that contraction of the internal\nintercostal muscles lowers the ribs and reduces\nthe intrathoracic volume15 may explain the role of\nMEP in modulation of CPF in women.\nBased on the above, although both men and\nwomen are affected by deep inspiration and\nstrong expiration during coughing, sex differ-\nences were observed in the factors affecting vol-\nuntary coughing. The results of the present\nstudy indicate that during deep inspiration, men\ndemonstrate the effect of strength, whereas\nwomen demonstrate the effect of volume; while\nduring strong expiration, men demonstrate the\neffect of force, whereas women demonstrate the\neffect of strength. These results suggest that for\nmaintaining and improving CPF, which is\nimportant for preserving self-drainage ability,\nmore detailed individual therapeutic interven-\ntions are possible for coughing in men and\nwomen, respectively.\nIn terms of the relationship between CPF and\nage, a weak negative correlation was observed\namong women only. Women demonstrate greater\nage-related morphological changes and greater\nvertebral deformation associated with reduced\nbone density than do men, as well as age-related\nkyphosis of the spine and expanded thoracic\nanteroposterior diameter. Expansion of the tho-\nracic anteroposterior diameter, which puts the\ndiaphragm in an extended position and leads to\ndiminished respiratory muscle strength,8 is thus\nlikely to affect CPF. This effect of expansion of\nthe thoracic anteroposterior diameter may be\nwhy women demonstrate a significant weak neg-\native correlation between CPF and age. Another\npossible reason that may explain the relationship\nbetween CPF and age in women is age-related\ndecline of MEP. MEP is generated from expira-\ntory muscles, and muscle strength declines with\nage.4 Although we did not observe any age-\nrelated decline in MEP, any changes in MEP\nmight be reflected in the relationship between\nCPF and age.\nThe present study has some limitations. First, the\nparticipants were healthy individuals recruited at a\ncommunity athletic facility, thus, the results of\nthis study may not be directly applicable to elderly\nindividuals or patients with respiratory illness.\nAlthough it will be necessary to verify our results\nin the elderly and in patients with respiratory\ndiseases in the future, the findings obtained in this\nstudy can be referred to in developing strategies\nfor improving coughing ability. Second, we did\nnot measure the intrathoracic pressure and\nabdominal pressure based on the limited time to\nmeasure in the gymnasium. Cough is reported to\nbe related to both intrathoracic pressure and intra-\nperitoneal pressure.3,5,6 Because there are many\ninfluences on cough, future research will be neces-\nsary to clarify our results. Third, CPF was the pri-\nmary parameter of interest in this study, and the\nexclusion of all those with the strongest CPF lim-\nits the ability to generalize this study's results.\nInclusion of those participants' data could have\naltered the relationships found with the associated\nfactors. Finally, although Smith and colleagues18\ndemonstrated that operating volume is a determi-\nnant of CPF, we were unable to control the oper-\nating volume among the participants.\nDespite these limitations, the present study can\nbe used to compare such participants with healthy\nparticipants. The present study could also be\nused to aid in maintaining, improving, and pre-\nventing decline in voluntary cough intensity.\nBecause the present study is a cross-sectional\nstudy, changes in CPF should be tracked longitu-\ndinally in the future in order to determine the\neffect of age on CPF.\n"
