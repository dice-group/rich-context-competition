    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis article reports on a research project at the University of Agder that has studied the use of e-readers as a tool for\nacademic study. E-readers (Kindle DX and iPad) were loaded with texts from required reading lists in five courses with 94\nparticipating students. Initially, 87 students responded to the invitation to participate in a survey, but eventually 13 of these\nsubmissions had to be removed, as the degree of completion was not sufficient. The final response rate achieved was 79%.\nStudents were in general positive to the use of e-readers but still show a preference for print on paper as the best medium\nfor serious academic study. When reading books, 54% preferred print, 28% a combination of print and e-reader, and finally\nonly 11% were satisfied solely using an e-reader. The iPad scored significantly better than the Kindle DX on tasks that\nrequired active interaction with the texts such as highlighting and note taking.\n",

Our\nmain research question in the following article is whether\ncurrent e-book readers loaded with curriculum-based e-books\nand articles can provide an effective learning experience for\nstudents in higher education.\nAcademic libraries have been purchasing e-books for\nquite a few years. Electronic versions of major reference\nwork such as encyclopedias and dictionaries were natural\ncandidates for purchase in the beginning. Pioneering vendors\nsuch as Ebrary and Netlibrary were successful in launching\nsubscription-based collections for academic libraries at an\nearly stage. An expansion of interest in the field seemed to\noccur around the year 2000. The journal Library Hi Tech\ndevoted a special issue to e-books more than 10 years ago\nThe number of offerings from vendors and publishers and\nthe percentage of library funds devoted to e-books have\ngrown considerably the last few years. Duke University\nPress conducted a survey of libraries with regard to e-books\npurchase e-books at all. A majority of the libraries have also\nincreased the amount of funds devoted to e-books in spite of\nthe current economic climate.\nOne factor that still limits the use of e-books in higher\neducation is the limited availability of e-textbooks. Only\n20% of the English language books on the required reading\nlists at the University of Agder were available for purchase\nas e-books when this was checked in 2010. The situation\nregarding Norwegian textbooks is even less satisfactory,\nalmost none of these are available as e-books.\nThe e-books we have made available to patrons have\nmostly been for online PC-based usage with limited possi-\nbilities for downloading and printing. Access to an e-book\nversion does not seem to fulfill the needs of our students and\nfaculty members as interlibrary loan or purchase requests are\noften made. Preferences for print have been clearly docu-\nmented at other academic libraries that have questioned fac-\nulty or students in regard to e-books. A recent survey of\nattitudes among business school faculty at Brigham Young\nwould prefer a book in print format if they could choose.\nEase of reading and portability were the two important rea-\nsons for preferring print.\n1The University of Agder, Kristiansand, Norway\nCorresponding Author:\nKristiansand, Norway.\nEmail: arthur.n.olsen@uia.no\nE-Book Readers in Higher Education:\nStudent Reading Preferences and\nOther Data From Surveys at the\nUniversity of Agder\nArthur N. Olsen1, Birgitte Kleivset1 and Henry Langseth1\n Keywords\ne-book readers, reading, academic study, surveys, Kindle, iPad\n2 SAGE Open\nThe University of Agder has established a multiyear pro-\ngram to explore ways that the deployment of new or innova-\ntive technology can enhance learning for our students who\nbelong to a generation of Digital Natives (Prensky, 2001).\nfor pilot projects that contribute to the implementation of\nideas and projects aimed at improving student learning out-\ncomes. A dialogue between LA2020 and Agder University\nLibrary resulted in funding for a project to explore the use of\ne-readers as a learning tool. Funds were provided to purchase\nfirst generation) in addition to some e-content course mate-\nrial and salary for staff. Extensive information from the proj-\nect is available on our blog (mostly in Norwegian).2\nEarlier Studies\nThere is a quite extensive body of literature that has studied\ndigital reading. The transition from the physical book or print\non paper to screen reading confronts one with a series of\nquestions on how this changes the way we read and how this\ninfluences comprehension and learning outcomes. A. Dillon\n(1992) provides a detailed review and synopsis of early\nresearch on reading speed, accuracy, and comprehension\nwhen reading from paper in contrast to VDUs (Visual\nDisplay Units). These early studies generally favored paper\nfor better performance in regard to the metrics mentioned\nabove. Today's high-quality LCD- and LED-based screens\nDespite great improvement in display technology, users still\nseem to dislike on-screen reading for extended periods.\nResults regarding learning outcomes have recently been\nreported by Ackerman and Goldsmith (2011). Their study\nshows that test performance was just as good for on-screen\nas paper reading when study time was fixed. However, when\nstudy time was self-regulated, the results changed for the\nworse in regard to on-screen reading. The authors explain\nthis difference in terms of the varying quality of metacogni-\ntion, in this case monitoring one's comprehension while\nreading. It seems that readers often overestimate their prog-\nress when reading on-screen.\nAnother recent study (Schugar, Schugar, & Penny, 2011)\nis one of the first that has analyzed differences in reading\ncomprehension between print on paper and a modern e-reader\nbased on e-ink. One group of students read the required texts\non the Nook e-reader while the control group read printed\nbooks. Formal testing showed no discernible differences in\nreading comprehension levels between the e-reader and\nnone-reader groups. One significant difference between the\ngroups was the level of interaction with the texts; readers of\nthe traditional texts were much more active as regards book-\nmarking, highlighting, and annotations. This result could be\nlinked to limited and cumbersome functionality for interac-\ntion in the Nook e-reader.\nTexasA&M University Libraries have pioneered the eval-\nuation of the new generation of e-readers based on e-ink. The\nuniversity library launched a project to test the new Kindle\ne-book reader from Amazon in 2008. They recruited a group\nof 36 students for a long-term study of usability.Aqualitative\nanalysis of user viewpoints based on a survey and focus\ngroup sessions was held after the students had used the\ne-readers for 1 month. Results of the focus groups showed\nthat students found the Kindle suitable for immersive fiction\nreading but felt that there were major problems in regard to\ndocument availability, graphics, and licensing issues. About\nhalf the students believed that the Kindle would never be a\nrealistic alternative to the printed book (Clark, Goodwin,\nSamuelson, & Coker, 2008). Some of the negative view-\npoints in regard to the Kindle in this study are less relevant\nfor the current Kindle e-readers (third generation) that have\nbetter screen contrast and more refined software at a much\nlower price. Texas A&M University Libraries has followed\nthis study with a lending program for Kindles that focuses on\npopular reading material as the devices were found to be less\nappropriate for academic study (Clark, 2009).\nIn conjunction with the launch of the Kindle DX reader in\n2009, Amazon sponsored a pilot project involving seven\nU.S. universities the goal of which was to evaluate the feasi-\nbility of replacing students' paper texts with electronic texts\npresented on an e-reader. Many of the studies were cut short\nbecause of protests from the American Council of the Blind\nthat the device could not be used by blind students. Some\ninteresting results have been made public but mostly as\nreports and not in the peer-reviewed literature. A pilot project\nwas established at Princeton University (2010) involving\nthree faculty members and 51 students. Three courses, one\nundergraduate and two graduate in the humanities and social\nsciences, were chosen for the project. Three major goals\nwere identified for the project: first, to reduce the amount of\nprinting needed for the required readings; second, to evaluate\nif the Kindle DX could provide a better learning environment\nthan the traditional paper-based experience; and third, to\nevaluate current technology and provide thoughts about key\nfeatures for future devices.\nThe goal of reducing printing was achieved but students\nreported many unsatisfactory aspects of the e-readers in\nregard to the active learning process. Reading was deemed to\nbe acceptable but interaction with the texts in the form of\ncomments, highlighting, and annotation was difficult and\nmuch less intuitive than with paper-based documents.\nReed College is another of the participants in the Kindle\nDX pilot study that has reported their findings (Marmarelli &\nRingle, 2009). The students praised the Kindle DX for good\nlegibility and battery life among other features but criticized\nother aspects of the device. PDF handling was deemed as\nunsatisfactory with a complete lack of facilities for high-\nlighting and note taking. Specific passages in the mono-\ngraphs in Kindle format could not be referred to by page.\nUsing the e-reader made work with several texts at one time\ndifficult. Reed has followed their Kindle DX study with a\nstudy of the Apple iPad in an academic setting (Marmarelli\n& Ringle, 2011). The findings from this study are more\nOlsen et al. 3\npositive to the device's potential as an efficient study tool\nthan the previous Kindle study. Students consider the iPad to\nbe responsive and flexible with adequate tools for highlight-\ning and annotation. Students do not report excessive fatigue\nwhen reading due to the LCD screen.\nA team at the Aalto University in Finland has recently\nstudied five e-readers based on e-ink technology (Aaltonen,\nMannonen, Nieminen, & Nieminen, 2011). The e-readers3\nwere first evaluated for compatibility in relation to the\ne-book holdings at the university library. In general, e-books\nfrom publishers such as Springer are fully compatible and\neasy to use with e-readers. E-books from aggregators such\nas DawsonEra are in general not usable due to digital rights\nmanagement (DRM) incompatibilities. A high-quality\nusability study involving students was also undertaken.\nOnly four of the e-readers were tested as the Amazon Kindle\nhad to be dropped due to technical difficulties. Students\nliked reading material on the e-readers and also thought that\nthey might purchase one for leisure reading. They found that\nthe devices lacked necessary functionality for serious study.\nNote taking, highlighting, and annotation were viewed as\ncumbersome. Nonlinear reading requiring efficient naviga-\ntion and browsing was too difficult.\nThe first long-term study of the Amazon Kindle DX\nreader has been published by a group at the University of\nWashington (Thayer et al., 2011). The study examines the\nacademic potential of e-readers by making use of A. K.\nPugh's notions of reading strategies. Pugh identifies five stu-\ndent reading techniques--scanning, search reading, skim-\nming, receptive reading, and responsive reading (Thayer et\nal., 2011). The study suggests that the Kindle DX supports\nreceptive reading but is poor on skimming, scanning, search\nreading, and responsive reading. Students switch between\nreading techniques rapidly. A successful future for e-readers\nin academia \"depends on understanding how to support stu-\ndents' varied reading practices more effectively\" (Thayer et\nThere has been a range of projects at other Norwegian\nuniversities and university colleges involving e-readers in an\nacademic setting. We have collaborated and exchanged\ninformation with colleagues in an informal network.\nPreliminary results have been published informally in blogs\nand other venues but formal publications are now\nappearing.\nA project looking into e-curriculum at the NTNU\nUniversity Library in Trondheim (Angeletaki, 2011) was\nconducted in 2010. E-readers loaded with material from\nreading lists were introduced to students in two courses.\nOf the 46 students asked, 12 willing students borrowed\ne-readers. After the test period, 80% of the 12 said they\npreferred reading on the digital readers rather than from\nprintouts. The main goal of the project was \"to investigate\nhow library staff can help University researchers and stu-\ndents to easily access up-to-date electronic resources and\nassure quality service\" (Angeletaki, 2011, p. s4).The use\nof new technology in the project seemed to contribute to\na user-oriented library service. The project manager\nAlexandra Angeletaki states that \"this type of collabora-\ntive project allows the library to establish itself as a learn-\ning space and an important educational collaborator for\nA project based at Oslo University College (Eikebrokk,\nKnutsen, & Thaule, 2011) has explored whether the use of an\niPad could improve students'study habits. The iPad was cho-\nsen as it was the e-reader/tablet that had the greatest degree\nof utility as regards the licensed e-resources at the institution.\nAfter a semester of use by students in two study programs,\nthe students received an electronic survey and participated in\nfocus group meetings. A major finding was that students\nthought that facilities for taking notes, printing, and access-\ning documents were less than ideal. The participants found\nthat the iPad worked well for reading online documents and\nshorter articles but not so well for books. DRM-related issues\ncontributed to reduced user satisfaction.\nThe earlier studies above regarding e-readers based on\ne-ink seem to point to the fact the this technology is now\nmature enough for immersive leisure reading but still defi-\ncient as far as serious study is concerned. Tablets such as the\niPad are a different class of device with a stronger feature set\nfor vital functions such as navigation, highlighting, and\nannotation. Very few studies have been done based on the\niPad or other tablets, but these devices seem to have potential\nfor higher education as the study at Oslo University College\nshows.\nChosen E-Book Readers\nDescribing current e-book readers is a challenge as technical\nspecifications change rapidly. The number of offerings\nworldwide has grown immensely but the number of major\nplayers is limited. Readers based on e-ink screens have been\navailable since 2004 but Amazon's launch of the Kindle\ne-book reader in late 2007 was a major turning point for mar-\nket penetration. Most users prefer e-ink screens for better\nreadability and ergonomics for extended reading, but there is\nlittle research that shows a definitive advantage in compari-\nson with modern LCD/LED screens as regards visual fatigue.\nTwo different readers were chosen for further study at\nAgder University based on a study of availability and fea-\ntures. We focused on readers that were marketed as suitable\nfor use in higher education. Delays were encountered due to\nlimited availability in Norway. In all, 20 Amazon Kindle DX\n(first-generation international version) readers were pur-\nchased in June 2010 and 20 Apple iPad (first generation) tab-\nlets were purchased from June to November 2010.\nThe Kindle DX comes with a 24.6 cm (9.7 inch) E-Ink\nscreen instead of the 15.2 cm (6 inch) normal Kindle screen.\nIt has support for International 3G Wireless and native sup-\nport for PDF documents. We were rather unfortunate with\nthe timing of this purchase asAmazon launched the improved\n4 SAGE Open\nsecond-generation Kindle DX (graphite) in July 2010. This\nversion has much improved screen contrast and some\nimprovements in PDF handing. As for all Kindles, the DX is\nonly compatible with e-books in Mobi and Amazon AZW\nformat.\nWe purchased the first-generation iPad WiFi with 16 MB\nmemory. The iPad's touchscreen display is a 25 cm (9.7 inch)\nresistant and scratch-resistant glass. The iPad is a multifunc-\ntion device which is especially suitable for media\nconsumption. Our focus was reading e-texts, both e-books in\nflowable formats and PDFs. The functionality of the iPad can\nbe extended in many ways by installing suitable Apps.\nStudents who participated in our study were advised that the\nfollowing iPad Apps were recommended:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Dropbox for file transfer4\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 iBooks and Kindle for e-books\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 GoodReader5 or ReaddleDocs6 for PDF reading, high-\nlighting, and annotation\nResearch Goals and Methodology\nAs stated above, our main research focus for this study was\nto establish whether current e-book readers loaded with the\nrelevant electronic texts could replace printed books and\njournal articles in an academic setting. A correct analysis of\nthe realism in the transition from print to e-reader is vital\nfor academic libraries when establishing a future library\nmedia acquisition policy. Secondary research questions\nwere related to a variety of usability issues of the studies'\ne-readers.\nThe University of Agder has more than 9,000 students.\nTeaching and research cover a wide range of subjects. In this\nstudy, we asked 94 students from four study programs to use\nthe Kindle or iPad for one semester (47% men, 53% women,\naverage number of years as students at the university 4.2).\nParticipants were offered the opportunity to download books\nand articles from the reading list, or other types of relevant\nresources that they might want, if available. Due to limited\navailability in compatible e-formats, only about 40% of the\nreading list material was accessible for the students on elec-\ntronic reading devices.\nStudents in four courses were given the Kindle DX or\niPad:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 European Integration, a problem-oriented summer\ncourse for students at the master level introducing his-\ntorical, economic, and political processes behind the\ndevelopment of a European Community.

The students had 3 weeks to complete the survey\nand received a reminder after 10 days if no response had\nbeen given.

A total of 46% of the participants left a com-\nment using the open-ended question at the end of the\nsurvey.\nSample Surveyed\nage, and there were slightly more female respondents (54%)\nthan male.

In addition, 42%\nuse a smartphone and 22% a traditional mobile phone for\nsurfing. These figures are in-line with previous studies\namong Norwegians (Statistics Norway, 2012).\nDevice Characteristics\nThe students were enthusiastic about receiving the e-reader\nand were asked to describe their first impressions regarding\nsome of the features. In total, 61% categorized the design as\neither good or very good, and 64% were also satisfied with\nOlsen et al. 5\nTable 1.

As many as 81% were also\npleased with battery capacity.\nNavigation and Usage\nAs seen in Figure 1, the students were asked to rate different\nfeatures of the e-reader. Only 40% found general navigation\nsatisfying. However, 66% stated they were satisfied with\nfinding the main menu on the device. Opening a document\nwas found to be poor among only 9% of the students and\n66% thought turning pages were either good or very good.\nThe percentage of students who were less satisfied with the\ntime it took to load a new page was 29%. As for zooming,\n56% were satisfied with this feature. Switching between dif-\nferent documents was found to be poor or very poor by 30%\nof the students. In all, 69% were satisfied with returning to a\ndocument they had previously opened. The possibilities to\ntake notes within a document were categorized as either poor\nor very poor by 46% of the students, and also 23% found it\nneither poor nor good. Furthermore, only 21% thought the\npossibility to highlight text was satisfactory. In this case, as\nmany as 14% stated that they did not know about this option.\nPrint or Electronic?\nA total of 79% thought the e-reader was good or very good\nfor reading journal articles but a little less, 61%, had a similar\nopinion as regards reading books. Despite a high degree of\nsatisfaction with the e-readers, fewer saw themselves as\nsolely relying on such a device. Having been given the\nopportunity to read literature from the reading list on an\ne-reader, 54% replied that they still preferred paper in terms\n6 SAGE Open\nFigure 2. E-reader versus print.\nFigure 3. Location of e-reader usage: Where have you been using the reading device?\nof books. Only 11% would rely solely on the device, and\n28% found that combining paper and an e-reader was best\nfor study purposes. Seven percent answered that they did not\nknow what kind of format they preferred books to be in. This\nis illustrated in Figure 2.\nThe results for reading journal articles were somewhat\nmore positive for e-readers. In all, 24% preferred just using\nthe e-reader, and 32% saw themselves using a combination\nof print and the e-reader. However, 41% still wanted to stay\nwith paper versions of journal articles, and 3% were not sure\nwhich format they preferred such documents to be in.\nAcademic Setting and Learning Outcomes\nLocation. In regard to location of use, Figure 3 above shows\nthat 59% of the students never or seldom brought it with\nthem to class. A total of 44% sometimes or often used it out-\ndoors, and 50% had also used it when traveling. Interest-\ningly, 49% had also taken the e-reader with them to bed.\nPurpose.The students had the e-readers in their possession\nfrom 1 to 4 months, depending on which course they were\nattending. In our study, we wanted to find out to what extent\nthe e-readers had been used for entertainment only. Surpris-\ningly, 56% never or seldom used the e-reader for entertain-\nment; however 26% stated they did sometimes. Of the\nsample surveyed, 19% used it either often or all the time for\nentertainment.\nWhen asked to what extent they had used it for academic\npurposes, only 19% seldom or never used it for academic\nstudies and 46% replied that they used it sometimes for this\npurpose. There were 27% who used it often for academic\nstudies while 8% used the e-reader all the time.\nAsked what the main purpose had been when using the\ne-reader, a majority of 39% used it mainly when preparing\nfor lectures as illustrated in Figure 4. Next, 34% stated their\nmain purpose was studying for exams. Sixteen percent had\nused it in class, and last, 11% replied they mainly used it dur-\ning group work and similar sessions.\nKindle Versus iPad. Although this study has not had its main\nfocus on the student's perceptions of the Kindle and iPad,\nsome findings should still be mentioned as the results\nclearly show differences between the two reading devices.\nOlsen et al. 7\nFirst, the iPad receives better scores in terms of turning\npages. In total, 46% thought this feature was very good\nusing the iPad and 20% gave the similar score for the Kin-\ndle. Next, zooming receives far better score with iPad. A\ntotal of 61% thinks this is very good, in sharp contrast to\nonly 4% giving the same score for the Kindle. Taking notes\nand highlighting text are two very important needs students\nhave when studying. As for the possibility of taking notes,\nthis was categorized as either good or very good by 28%\nusing the iPad. Only 7% answered with these categories\nwhen using the Kindle. Highlighting text also received bet-\nter scores with the iPad, 32% of iPad users finding this fea-\nture good or very good versus only 11% with the Kindle.\nLast, the reading devices did not score very differently as\nregards reading books, but for reading articles 92% of the\niPad users found this to be either good or very good in con-\ntrast to 72% saying the same about the Kindle. We also\nobserve the iPad is more of an entertainment device in com-\nparison with the Kindle, but this should not be a surprise to\nanyone familiar with these devices.\nThe above-mentioned features seem to be the areas where\nthe iPad is ahead of the Kindle. The remaining features pres-\nent so little variation that it would only be of interest if a\nlarger sample was surveyed.\nLearning Outcomes. Only 4% of the students participating in\nthe project thought they had a better learning outcome using\nthe e-reader for studying. But 46% thought they had learned\nabout the same, and as many as 41% stated they had learned\nless well using the e-reader in comparison with printed text.\nNine percent did not know.\nDiscussion\nDespite the fact that students in general were positive to the\nuse of e-readers, our research suggests that current e-book\nreaders loaded with curriculum-based e-books and articles\ncannot, to a full extent, provide for an efficient learning\nexperience in higher education. Students report unsatisfac-\ntory aspects of the e-readers in regard to active reading.\nInteraction with the texts in the form of comments, highlight-\ning, annotation, and nonlinear reading is difficult. The tech-\nnology still seems to be immature for serious study in an\nacademic setting.\nThe main results of our study as to student preferences\nare still in line with what other investigators have found.\nStudents of today still seem to prefer print on paper as the\nprimary delivery mechanism for texts as part of their educa-\ntion. The current technological infrastructure as to e-readers\nand content is not yet as functional as traditional printed\nmedia. This outcome is also related to work habits and how\nfamiliar the current generation of students is with using\ne-readers. Our study reports the subjective viewpoints of the\nparticipating students who were relatively inexperienced\nusers of e-readers. The courses surveyed were all in the\nhumanities and social sciences; results might have been dif-\nferent if students from the natural sciences, medicine, or\nmathematics had been included in the study.\nDue to student preferences and uncertainty as to learning\noutcomes, the field is still in a state of flux. The major pub-\nlishers of academic textbooks have still not embraced e-read-\ners. Universities and academic libraries should possibly\nmoderate plans and projects for a transition to e-texts and\ncontinue studying current e-book readers.\nIn this study, the iPad received better scores than\nKindle DX as to taking notes and highlighting. The stu-\ndents also reported that they brought the iPad to class.\nThis might point to this device's potential as an effective\nstudy and reading tool, and should be more thoroughly\ninvestigated.\nRecent developments in smartphone technology are also\nof great interest. The widespread adoption of smartphones\nwith large screens, powerful processors, and a sophisticated\nsoftware environment means that most students will already\nhave a device that could be a suitable tool for academic\nstudy. An added advantage of smartphones as a learning tool\nis that students already know how to use them. A new study\nfocusing on these ubiquitous devices would be of great\ninterest.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research and/or authorship of this article: This project\nFigure 4.
