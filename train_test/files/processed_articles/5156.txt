Feigning psycho-\nsis is one of the main manifestations of malingering.\nAccording to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of\nMental Disorders (5th ed.; DSM-5; American Psychiatric\nAssociation [APA], 2013), malingering is defined as \"the\nintentional production of false or grossly exaggerated physi-\ncal or psychological symptoms, motivated by external incen-\ntives such as avoiding military duty, avoiding work, obtaining\nfinancial compensation, evading criminal prosecution, or\nent from factitious disorder in that the motivation for the for-\nmer has an external incentive whereas for the latter external\nincentives are absent (APA, 2013). However, the distinction\nbetween malingering and factitious disorder is usually diffi-\ncult and problematic in clinical work (Rogers, 2008b;\nRogers, Bagby, & Vincent, 1994). Regardless of the differen-\ntiation of these, the first most important step is to detect\nfeigning, which means \"the deliberate fabrication or gross\nexaggeration of psychological or physical symptoms without\nany assumptions about its goals\" (Rogers, 2008b, p. 6). As it\nis often difficult to determine individuals' underlying moti-\nvations, psychological tests can be used to establish feigning,\nFeigning is not rare. Surveys concerning forensic and\nnonforensic referrals yielded mean percentages of approxi-\nmately 15% to 17%, respectively, and about 7% for feigning\n(Rogers, 2008b). In a study on the feigning of neuropsycho-\nlogical symptoms, 17% of criminal cases, 13% of personal\ninjury cases, 13% of disability or workers compensation\ncases, and 4% of medical or psychiatric cases were found to\nhave either symptom exaggeration or probable symptom\nexaggeration (Sullivan, Lange, & Dawes, 2005). Feigning\nhas also been recognized in the military context (Malone &\n1Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Yuli Branch, Yuli, Taiwan\n2Chung Yuan Christian University, Chungli, Taiwan\n3National Dong Hwa University, Shoufeng, Taiwan\nCorresponding Author:\nWai-Cheong Carl Tam, Department of Psychology, Chung Yuan Christian\nEmail: cheong@cycu.edu.tw\nDetection of Feigning Psychosis With\nMultiscale Personality Inventories:\nA Simulation Design Pilot Study in Taiwan\nYi-Ting Chang1, Wai-Cheong Carl Tam2,\nand Shih-Kuang Chiang3\n Keywords\nmalingering, forensic assessment, MMPI-2, dissimulation, response styles\n2 SAGE Open\na draftee sample for psychiatric reevaluation, 9.1% were sus-\npected to be feigners.\nThe phenomenon of feigning may create a range of seri-\nous problems. First, clinicians are trained with scientific\nknowledge and methods to find the psychiatric truth.\nObviously, clinicians have not done their job well if they are\nfooled by their clients. Second, medical resources may be\nwasted on unwarranted care with clients with feigned illness.\nThird, when the reports of the assessment of clients' condi-\ntions are used in judicial procedures, justice may be hindered\nif sentencing is based on incorrect evidence. Acceptance of\nincorrect evidence may affect individuals' social standing,\ntheir property holdings, or even issues of life and death.\nHowever, the detection of feigning is not easy. Both lay\npeople and professionals are typically not very good at detect-\ning lies (Vrij, 2008).Although there are individual differences\nin judging deception, few people can be identified as experts\nin deception detection (C. F. Bond & DePaulo, 2008; G. D.\nBond, 2008). Scientific investigation on the detection of\ndeception has pointed toward verbal and nonverbal behaviors\nthat may be helpful cues in detecting deception. Yet, despite\nmany years of research, the accuracy of all these suggestions\nis not high due to the enormous variation of human behavior\nwhile lying or telling the truth, both at the intrapersonal and\ninterpersonal levels (Boyd, McLearen, Meyer, & Denney,\ners focus on the physiological responses of liars and poly-\ngraph methods have been proposed for detecting deception.\nHowever, as is well known, generally speaking, the opinions\nof researchers on the accuracy of the polygraph fall on the\nnegative side. In fact, the National Research Council of the\nUnited States National Academy of Sciences found that the\nvalidity of the polygraph has not been scientifically supported\nOn the contrary, the clinical assessment of response styles\nhas made progress. Methods for the detection of feigning\nhave evolved from case studies and group differences to\ndetection strategies (Rogers & Correa, 2008). The\nInfrequency (F), Lie (L), and Correction (K) scales of the\nMinnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) were\nregarded as the beginning of the assessment of response\nstyles both systematically and empirically (Rogers, 2008a).\nThere are four basic distinct response styles in clients within\nthe psychiatric setting: reliable response style, irrelevant\nresponse style, defensiveness, and malingering (Rogers,\nBagby, & Dickens, 1992). At present, the most commonly\nused multiscale personality inventories in clinical or forensic\nsettings in the United States are the MMPI-2, the Personality\nAssessment Inventory (PAI), and the Millon Clinical\nMultiaxial Inventory\u00adIII (MCMI-III), and significant\nresearch has been devoted to assessing the validity of these\nmeasures for detecting specific response styles (Boyd et al.,\nto the MMPI-2, some scales, such as the Infrequency Scale\n(F), the Back Infrequency Scale (Fb), the Infrequency-\nPsychopathology Scale (Fp), the Gough's Dissimulation\nIndex (F-K), and the Gough's Dissimulation Scale (Ds),\nhave been shown to be useful in detecting feigning (Gough,\nRogers, Sewell, Martin, & Vitacco, 2003). These are either\nvalidity scales or scales constructed for detecting feigning.\nAccording to the review by Rogers et al. (2003), the strate-\ngies used for the detection of feigned mental disorders in the\nMMPI-2 include the following: rare symptoms, symptom\nseverity, comparison of obvious and subtle symptoms, and\nerroneous stereotypes. For example, the scales F, Fb, Fp, and\nF-K use the detection strategy of rare symptoms, while the\nscale Ds belongs to the strategy of erroneous stereotypes.\nDespite the presence of various basic research designs in\nstudying response styles, most research on feigning mental\ndisorders relies on simulation designs using analog research\nmethod, in which nonclinical participants are randomly\nassigned to different experimental conditions (Rogers,\n2008c). Then the experimental group is compared with the\ncontrol group (i.e., honest or standard conditions). The\nstrength of simulation designs is strong internal validity\n(Rogers, 2008b). In addition, coaching is considered to be an\nimportant variable in this kind of research (Bagby, Nicholson,\nGraham, 2000), as the assumption that the examinees in the\nforensic psychological assessment are uninformed of the pur-\npose and method of testing is untenable (Rogers, Bagby, &\nChakraborty, 1993). There are two kinds of coaching: symp-\ntom/disorder-based coaching and detection-based coaching\n(Rogers, 2008c). Research showed that the factors assisting\nfeigners who succeeded to avoid detection on the MMPI-2\nwere greater intelligence, prior knowledge of the condition\nfeigned, and prior information of the MMPI-2 (Pelfrey, 2004;\nWalters & Clopton, 2000). Moreover, Wetter and Corrigan\n(1995) reported that 50% of attorneys felt obliged to inform\ntheir clients about the MMPI-2. On the contrary, the effect of\nincentives on simulators is another issue in research on feign-\ning mental disorders, and it appears that the desire for the\naward increases the motivation to feign (Rogers, 2008c).\nSome researchers attempted to provide higher incentives but\nmade them available to only the top few performers in the\nThe MMPI-2 has been translated into Chinese and pub-\nlished by the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Cheung,\nZhang, & Song, 2003). Nevertheless, the Ko Mental Health\nQuestionnaire (KMHQ) and the Health-Personality-Habit\nInventory (HPH) are the two most frequently used multiscale\npersonality inventories in clinical settings in Taiwan. They\nhave also been used in forensic psychiatric/psychological\nassessment ordered by courts. However, there has been no\nresearch on the utility of the KMHQ or the HPH with respect\nto the detection of feigning psychosis.\nChang et al. 3\nTaken together, this pilot study investigated the utility of\nthe Chinese MMPI-2, the KMHQ, and the HPH in the detec-\ntion of feigning psychosis. The following hypotheses were\nmade.\nHypothesis 1: The scales of the Chinese MMPI-2 used\nfor detecting feigned mental disorders would be effective\nin discriminating participants in the feigning and control\ngroups.\nHypothesis 2: The validity scales of the KMHQ would be\neffective in discriminating participants in the feigning and\ncontrol groups.\nHypothesis 3: The validity scales of the HPH would be\neffective in discriminating participants in the feigning and\ncontrol groups.\nIn addition, the effect size, best cutoff score, classification\naccuracy rate, sensitivity, and specificity of the scales of the\nabove three inventories in discriminating participants\nbetween feigning psychosis and honestly responding were\ninvestigated, respectively. Furthermore, for each of these\nmultiscale personality inventories, the best discriminative\nvariables were also explored. This information is extremely\nimportant and useful for clinicians conducting forensic psy-\nchological assessment.\nMethod\nParticipants\nThe participants were recruited through advertisements\nposted on campus notice boards and the webpage of a uni-\nversity in northern Taiwan for 2 months. The inclusion crite-\nria for participants were (a) at least 17 years old, (b) no\nhistory of psychiatric illness, and (c) not studying psychol-\nogy or psychology-related courses. In total, 70 participants\n(19 men and 51 women) responded voluntarily to the adver-\ntisements and they all satisfied the inclusion criteria of the\nfrom 17 to 47 years old. The mean education level of the\n19 years. With regard to occupation, 64 of the participants\nwere students. In addition to the university's institutional\nreview board's (IRB) approval of this research project and\nthe signing of informed consent forms by all participants, the\nDeclaration of Helsinki was strictly followed in the protec-\ntion of participants' rights.\nMeasures\nDahlstrom, Graham, Tellegen, & Kaemmer, 1989). It is a\nself-report questionnaire comprising 567 items which can be\nanswered \"True\" or \"False,\" and has seven validity scales.\nThe MMPI-2 was standardized on an adult norm. There has\nalready been accumulated a large amount of research on the\nreliability and validity of the MMPI-2 which supports its uti-\nnese MMPI-2 was first published in 2003 (Cheung, Zhang,\n& Song, 2003). Two norms have been reported: China norms\nand Hong Kong norms. Generally speaking, the psychomet-\nric properties of the Chinese MMPI-2 are similar to that of\nthe English version (Cheung et al., 2003). Previous research\nindicated that Chinese respondents endorsed much more\nitems of the MMPI F scale than American respondents, and\nthus a new Chinese Infrequency scale (ICH) was developed\nfor the Chinese MMPI (Cheung, Song, & Butcher, 1991).\nThis scale has also been used in the Chinese MMPI-2. As\nmentioned above, the scales F, Fb, Fp, F-K, and Ds have\nbeen shown to be useful in detecting feigning. In addition, as\nthe ICH is the specific Infrequency scale for Chinese\nMMPI-2 respondents, the scales Fb, Fp, F-K, Ds, and ICH\nwere used for statistical analysis in this study. The scales Fb,\nFp, and ICH are in the standard scoring system of the Chi-\nthe Gough Dissimulation Index (F-K), which is the raw score\ndifference between the F and K scales, and the Gough Dis-\nsimulation Scale (Ds), which has 58 items in the MMPI-2.\nThe raw scores of these scales were used for computation.\nKMHQ.The KMHQ is a Chinese multiscale personality\ninventory for assessing psychopathology and has been used in\nTaiwan for many years. The purpose of constructing this mea-\nsure was to have an indigenous test similar to the MMPI. The\nitems were empirically derived without adhering to any par-\nticular personality theory or psychiatric diagnostic system\net al., 1992), respectively. The latest version was published in\nresponded to using 6-point rating scale, ranging from totally\nuntrue to totally true. The KMHQ has 38 scales, in which six\nof them are validity scales, namely, Reliable Responding (S1):\nthe degree which the respondent claims to respond honestly;\nUnreliable Responding (S2): the degree which the respondent\nclaims to respond dishonestly; Maintaining Good Image (S3):\nlooking good; Inconsistency (S4): discrepancy in responding\nto identical items; Opposite Response Consistency (S5):\nresponding to items with similar meaning in a similar way;\nand Infrequency (S6): endorsing items that describe infrequent\nor odd behavior. There are three kinds of norms: junior-high\nstudents, senior-high students, and university students/adults,\nwith each further classified into male and female norms.\nAccording to the manual of the KMHQ (Ko, 1998), most of\nthe 38 scales (except three) had reliability coefficients (Cron-\nbach's s) that ranged from .5 to .97. The author of the KMHQ\nexplained that the low reliability coefficients of some scales\nwere due to few items in each of these scales (Ko, 1998). The\ntest\u00adretest reliability coefficients (30-40 days) for most of the\n4 SAGE Open\nscales were above .6. The validity of the 1998 version of the\nKMHQ was investigated via differences between males and\nfemales, comparison of healthy versus unhealthy groups, and\nfactor analysis. All these analyses supported the construct\nstudied the validity of the KMHQ by using meta-analysis on\n11 scales of the measure. The analysis comprised the data of\n52 studies. They concluded that the extent of the KMHQ's\nvalidity generalization was high and its discriminating capac-\nity among the various mental disorders was good. The 1998\nversion of the KMHQ was used in the current study. As there\nhas been no previous research on the utility of the validity\nscales of the KMHQ in the detection of feigning psychosis, the\nstatistical analysis of this study focused on the six validity\nscales and the raw scores of these scales were used for\ncomputation.\nHPH.The HPH is a Chinese multiscale personality inven-\ntory for assessing psychological health and personality char-\nacteristics in Taiwan. The HPH was first published in 1995\nderived according to the clinical experience of the authors of\nthe HPH and in reference to the diagnostic criteria of mental\ndisorders described in the DSM system (Ko & Chang, 2003).\nThe purpose of the HPH varies conceptually from the\nKMHQ. The items of the HPH are different from that of the\nKMHQ. In the HPH, there are 256 items in total. There are\n27 clinical scales and five validity scales. The validity scales\nare labeled as Self-Rated Mentally Healthy (D5): I feel psy-\nchologically well; Self-Rated Mentally Unhealthy (D6): I\nfeel psychologically poor; Self-Rated Reliable Responding\n(D7): I am responding honestly; Self-Rated Unreliable\nResponding (D8): I am responding dishonestly; and Infre-\nquency (D9): I have uncommon behaviors different from the\nnormal population. The response of each item is scored on a\n6-point rating scale, ranging from totally untrue to totally\ntrue. There are five kinds of norms: junior-high students,\nsenior-high students, junior college students, university stu-\ndents, and adults, with each further classified into male and\nfemale norms. According to the manual of the HPH (Ko &\nChang, 2003), most of the scales had reliability coefficients\n(Cronbach's s) above .6. The measure possessed good sta-\nbility (1-month test\u00adretest). The validity of the 2003 version\nof the HPH was investigated via content analysis, differences\nbetween males and females, comparison of clinical versus\nnormal groups, factor analysis, and correlations between the\nHPH with the KMHQ, the Edwards Personal Preference\nSchedule (EPPS), and the Interpersonal Behavior Survey\n(IBS). All these analyses supported the construct validity of\nthis measure (Ko & Chang, 2003). The clinical validity of the\nHPH was further investigated on a sample of patients diag-\nnosed with schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder, major depres-\nsive disorder, and anxiety disorders, respectively (Liu et al.,\n2015). The results found that the HPH displayed satisfactory\ndiscriminative power among the various mental disorders.\nThe latest 2003 version was used in the current study. As\nthere has been no previous research on the utility of the\nvalidity scales of the HPH in the detection of feigning psy-\nchosis, the statistical analysis of this study focused on the\nfive validity scales and the Z scores of these scales were used\nfor computation.\nProcedure\nWhen each participant arrived at the testing room, a coin\nwas tossed to decide which of the two groups, feigning\npsychosis or honestly responding, to which the partici-\npants were assigned. In total, 40 participants (seven males\nand 33 females) belonged to the feigning psychosis group\nestly responding group. The participants in the feigning\npsychosis group were coached by reading a two-page\ndescription of schizophrenic symptoms. To ensure that the\nparticipants understood and remembered the instructed\nsymptoms, a 10-item quiz was administered; correctly\nresponding on eight or more items was considered as sat-\nisfying the manipulation check requirements. The coach-\ning procedure was repeated if the eight correct responses\nwere not achieved. All the participants in the feigning psy-\nchosis group passed the manipulation check. The partici-\npants in the feigning psychosis group were instructed to\nimagine that they had killed someone and were eager to\nescape culpability by feigning psychosis. To enhance their\nmotivation of feigning, they were told that the two best\nfeigners would receive a monetary reward. The partici-\npants in the honestly responding group were asked to\nrespond honestly according to their present feelings and\nthinking. Three multiscale personality inventories, that is,\nthe KMHQ, the HPH, and the Chinese MMPI-2, were\nadministered to each participant in this sequence. The par-\nticipants completed the testing in two separate sessions on\ndifferent days.\nStatistical Analysis\nStatistical analysis was implemented by using SPSS version\n20 computer software. To examine the differences of the\nscores of the scales of the three inventories, respectively,\nbetween the two participant groups, MANOVA, t test, and\nCohen's d were computed. Receiver operating characteristic\n(ROC) analysis and discriminant analysis were also con-\nducted to evaluate the accuracy of the scales of each inven-\ntory in differentiating feigning psychosis and honestly\nresponding.\nResults\nTo compare the means of the scores on the scales Fb, Fp, F-K,\nDs, and ICH of the MMPI-2 of the feigning psychosis and\nChang et al. 5\nhonestly responding groups, MANOVA was first conducted.\nAccordingly, one-tailed t test was used on each of the scales.\nThe means, standard deviations, t tests, and Cohen's d of each\nof the scores of the scales of the Chinese MMPI-2 of the two\nparticipant groups are shown in Table 1. Similar procedures\nin statistical analysis were implemented for the validity scales\nof the KMHQ and the HPH. For MANOVA, the Hotelling's\nThe means, standard deviations, t tests, and Cohen's d of each\nof the scores of the scales of the KMHQ and the HPH of the\ntwo participant groups are shown in Tables 2 and 3.\nThe utility of the scales with significant t-test results of\neach inventory in the detection of feigning psychosis was\nexamined with ROC analysis. The results, including the area\nunder curve (AUC), best cutoff scores, the percentages of\nthe participants correctly classified, sensitivity, and speci-\nficity, are shown in Tables 4 to 6. In addition, discriminant\nanalysis, with stepwise procedure, was conducted to explore\nthe best discriminant variables of each of these inventories,\nrespectively. For the Chinese MMPI-2, the Wilks's lambda\nwere Fp and Fb, while the classification accuracy rate was\n97.1%. For the KMHQ and HPH, the Wilks's lambdas were\np < .001, respectively. The best predictors were Infrequency\n(S6) and Inconsistency (S4) for the KMHQ, with a classifi-\ncation accuracy rate of 90.0%. With regard to the HPH, the\nbest predictors were Infrequency (D9) and Self-Rated\nMentally Unhealthy (D6), while the classification accuracy\nTable 1.

In fact, of the 16\ndetection scales analyzed in the current study, only two had\nnonsignificant t-test results in comparing the means between\nthe feigning psychosis and honestly responding groups.\nAs this study appeared to be the first in investigating the\nutility of the Chinese MMPI-2 in the detection of feigning\npsychosis, it may be informative to compare the results of\nthis study with those using the English MMPI-2. To adhere\nto academic strictness and simplicity, meta-analyses of the\nMMPI-2 in the detection of feigned mental disorders were\nreviewed (Nelson, Hoelzle, Sweet, Arbisi, & Demakis, 2010;\nRogers et al. (2003) reported effect sizes for simulators ver-\nsus nonclinical controls and the mean cutoff scores of\nvarious detection scales in the meta-analysis. Compared with\nthe results of Rogers et al. (2003), the effect sizes and clas-\nsification rates of the scales Fb, Fp, F-K, and Ds were higher\nin the present study using the Chinese MMPI-2, as shown in\nTable 7. However, these comparisons were made between a\nlarge sample (2,514 participants in the meta-analysis) and a\nsmall sample (70 participants in the current study). The dif-\nferences in the statistical sample representation of the two\nsamples might lead to the above differences in the effect\nsizes and classification rates of the Chinese versus English\nMMPI-2. One other possibility might be the effects of coach-\ning the feigning psychosis group, which in turn enhanced the\ndifferences between the feigning psychosis and honestly\nresponding groups. With regard to cutoff scores, all of them\nexcept for Ds were also higher in the Chinese MMPI-2 than\nthose of the English MMPI-2. Previous studies have indi-\ncated that test takers in the Chinese society generally seemed\nto have higher MMPI-2 scores than those in the Western\nsocieties (Cheung et al., 1991). This implies that cultural dif-\nferences would be one of the reasons for having higher cutoff\nscores for the Chinese MMPI-2 compared with the English\nMMPI-2. In other words, if clinicians conduct psychological\nassessment and use measures which are translated from other\nlanguages to Chinese, they should be familiar with research\non cultural differences and do not interpret the scores of the\nmeasures only according to the studies in other cultures.\nAnother finding of this study was that, among the five\nscales of the Chinese MMPI-2 in the statistical analysis, the\nscales Fp and Fb appeared to be the best predictors in discrimi-\nnating feigning psychosis from honestly responding. However,\nICH was a new scale created especially for the Chinese MMPI\nand has also been used in the Chinese MMPI-2 (Cheung et al.,\n1991). This pilot study seemed to be the first research to inves-\ntigate its utility in the detection of feigning psychosis. Results\nshowed that, in addition to its high correlation with the Fb, Fp,\nTable 5.

This implies that ICH is a valid\nscale for validity checking. Therefore, in addition to the scales\nof the MMPI-2 which have already been examined thoroughly\nin the detection of feigning psychosis, it is recommended that\nthe utility of ICH of the Chinese MMPI-2 should also be care-\nfully investigated in future research.\nDespite that this is the first pilot study on the utility of\nthe KMHQ and the HPH in the detection of feigning psy-\nchosis, the results of this study seemed to be very encour-\naging. For the KMHQ, the scales Infrequency (S6) and\nInconsistency (S4) appeared to be the best predictors in\ndiscriminating feigning psychosis from honestly respond-\ning, using discriminant analysis. Moreover, the validity\nscale Maintaining Good Image (S3) also possessed good\naccuracy with regard to effect size and classification rate.\nFor the HPH, the validity scales Infrequency (D9) and\nSelf-Rated Mentally Unhealthy (D6) were good discrimi-\nnant variables in discriminating feigning psychosis from\nhonestly responding. However, besides relying on the\nvalidity scales of the KMHQ and the HPH for the detection\nof feigning psychosis, specific detection scales, such as Ds\nof the MMPI-2, should be developed in the future.\nMoreover, for the MMPI-2, detection models, which con-\nsisted of algorithms integrating individual indices, have\nbeen advocated to increase the accuracy of detecting\nfeigned mental disorders (Meyers et al., 2002; Rosenfeld,\nGreen, Pivovarova, & Dole, 2010; Steffan, Morgan, Lee,\n& Sellbom, 2010). The development of the detection mod-\nels of the KMHQ and the HPH might be another future\nresearch direction.\nFrom a clinical point of view, in this study on the detec-\ntion of feigning psychosis, the scale with the largest effect\nsize, classification accuracy rate, sensitivity, and specificity\nfor the Chinese MMPI-2 was the Chinese Infrequency scale\n(ICH). Similarly, for the KMHQ, the scale with the greatest\naccuracy was the Infrequency scale (S6); for the HPH, it was\nalso the Infrequency scale (D9). All these three scales use the\ndetection strategy of rare symptoms. According to research,\nthis rare-symptom strategy is the main technique for assess-\ning feigned psychosis and has been shown to be a robust\non the Chinese MMPI-2, the KMHQ, and the HPH may\nfocus on the effectiveness of other detection strategies such\nas symptom severity, comparison of obvious and subtle\nsymptoms, and erroneous stereotypes.\nThere were several limitations in this study. First, the\nsample size was small (N = 70). Second, the participants\nhad generally high education levels (M = 14.7 years). Third,\nthe comparison group consisted of healthy participants,\ninstead of psychiatric patients, without psychopathology.\nFourth, this was a simulation design study which lacked\necological validity. Fifth, the participants were not ran-\ndomly selected from a base. Sixth, the incentives given to\nthe simulators might be an issue of confounding variable.\nAs a result, it should be cautious in the generalization of the\nresults of this study to other populations and much further\nresearch is needed.\nIn conclusion, the results of this study supported the util-\nity of the Chinese MMPI-2, the KMHQ, and the HPH in the\ndetection of feigning psychosis in Taiwan. In addition, the\nscales which are particularly useful in the detection were also\nindicated for further study.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nAmerican Psychiatric Association.
