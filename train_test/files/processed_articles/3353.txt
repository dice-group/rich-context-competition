    "abstract": "Abstract\nCrime surveys of businesses have revealed that while crimes in which men were victims tend to be reported, those in which\nwomen were victims are likely to go unreported to the police. Understanding the reasons behind male reporting and female\nnon-reporting is useful not only for collection of crime statistics but also for improving crime control competences of law\nenforcement agencies. This article examines the impact of crime involving market women on their crime-reporting practices\nin Oyo town, Oyo State, Nigeria. The study adopted quantitative and qualitative approaches. Copies of a questionnaire\nwere administered to collect quantitative data from randomly selected 210 market women at Akesan, Sabo, and Mosadoba\nmarkets in Oyo town. Five focus group discussions, in-depth and key informant interviews were conducted to complement\nquantitative data. Both data were analyzed. The study found that cultural considerations stand between crime events that\nhurt the economic interests of women and their readiness to report to the police. Due to the very low confidence that\nmarket women have in the ability and willingness of the police to apprehend criminals, they prefer to internalize their losses,\ntake their cases to traditional rulers who use \"oro cult\" to protect them against criminals, or approach available faith-based\noptions such as churches and mosques. The article concludes that women have economy-enriching roles to play in the\ncontext of sustainable security. It therefore suggests that the government should address public safety to enable market\nwomen make their modest contribution to Nigeria's economic development.\n",

The inability of market women to\nplay a significant role in Oyo's accusatory justice constitutes\none of these difficulties. Being a multi-faceted social chal-\nlenge, crime has no easy fix, anywhere in the world.\nNevertheless, crime reporting is one of the most effective\nresponses by which members of civilized societies provide\nsolutions to crime issues.\nThe history of crime and its reporting by women in con-\ntemporary Nigeria have focused essentially on the interac-\ntions that occur among the victim, criminal justice system,\nand the offender. In the quest to discover a great deal about\nhow certain crimes are and are not reported, the network of\nsocial intervention, gender structure of crime reporters, the\ntwin spectacles of the apprehension and escape of offenders\nhave stimulated this inquiry. It was almost invariably these\nindividuals who decided whether a crime was to be prose-\ncuted in the first instance, and it was their words which were\nrecorded by magistrates during trials.\nDespite small businesses serving as major income earners\nand new employment providers for Oyo's teeming youth,\novercoming business crimes that threaten the contribution of\nmarket women to the economic development of this ancient\ncommunity is probably its most critical challenge. Although\nbusiness and retail crimes are commonly assumed to include\nall crimes and disorder committed by or against businesses,\nthe onslaught on them has lately become an issue of signifi-\ncant interest to individuals who monitor developments within\nthe Nigerian economy with patriotic interest.\nIf current statistics, which paint the exact picture of vic-\ntimization of women within the economy were available,\nthese would have revealed how acutely deprived women\ntraders have been in Nigeria. While substantial research has\nbeen conducted in relation to crimes against individuals,\nresearch into crimes against businesses has traditionally\nreceived less attention, although this gap has started to close\nin recent years (Burrows, Anderson, Bamfield, Hopkins, &\n1Lagos State University, Nigeria\nCorresponding Author:\nJohnson Oluwole Ayodele, Department of Sociology, Faculty of Social\nSciences, Lagos State University, Lagos, Nigeria.\nEmail: johnson.ayodele@lasu.edu.ng\nCrime-Reporting Practices Among\nMarket Women in Oyo, Nigeria\nJohnson Oluwole Ayodele1\n Keywords\nmarket women, cultural considerations, crime reporting, Oyo, Nigeria.\n2 SAGE Open\nhaps, but not so appreciably in most developing countries of\nthe world, especially in Nigeria.\nThus, providing inadequate empirical evidence to confirm\nthe assumption that crime against businesses is almost as\ntwice the estimated number of crimes against households. It\nis regrettable that among the general public, a commonly\nheld perception is that, as transgressions against inanimate\nobjects, business crimes are obscure, \"victimless\" events.\nBusiness victims consequently generally fail to arouse the\nsort of empathetic responses ordinarily reserved for \"real\"\nvictims--individuals--as they are seen as better able to\nmanage the event and absorb the losses (Johnston, Leitner,\nShapland, & Wiles, 1994). Although business crime has\noften been regarded as a victimless crime due to difficulties\nin quantifying its nature, scale, and impact (Robson &\nTeague, 2005), the potential costs of business crime to both\nthe individual business and the wider community are now\nbetter documented (N. Taylor, 2002), even if business\noffenses still mostly go unreported.\nOne of the most basic aspects of civil society is the guar-\nantee of citizens' safety and liberty to undertake decent\nengagements, including ones with economic motivation\nwithout any form of harassment. However, protecting the\nrights of individuals, who transact their businesses legiti-\nmately at market places has remained a challenge in many\ndeveloped and developing countries of the world. When the\nmeans of a people's livelihood is threatened, economic hopes\nbecome shattered. Apart from the absence of employment\nopportunities for able-bodied youth that makes vandalism a\nperennial problem, some people see their reckless siege on\nmarket traders as \"no more than youthful high spirits or as an\nunconscious attempt on the part of children to exercise con-\ntrol over their environment by leaving some sign of their\nCould youth not constitute an army of informal commu-\nnity security outfit, which imposes service charges on clients\nas a more socioeconomically responsible means of establish-\ning their presence? The wanton activities of badly behaved\nyouth could result in a situation that causes mass panic and\ninsecurity to flourish. This could affect the welfare of poor\nand rich people in the community. It can cause injury and\ndeath, reduce family income, and generate a climate of fear\n(Department for International Development [DFID], 2000).\nAlthough some Nigerian laws exist to guarantee freedom of\nlawful competition, security of assets, and the protection of\nthe business people's rights of ownership, nevertheless, con-\nflict scholars present the theoretical argument that crimes\nserve as a sort of non-institutionalized protest against the\nexisting social relationships as well as a reaction to those\nrelationships. Therefore, criminals who victimize market\nwomen respond to failures in social consciousness and in\nlegislation intended to redistribute property and social status\namong various social groups (Tulyakov, 2004).\nStudies conducted in the area of business crime provide\nsupport to the thesis that a substantial proportion of busi-\nnesses suffer from crime. By virtue of their sizes and income\nthey bring about, small businesses lack the human and finan-\ncial resources of larger businesses to implement crime pre-\nvention measures. Often, surveys report that approximately\nhalf of the businesses surveyed had experienced a crime\nthis figure can be even larger (up to 76%), as was found in\nanother study (Wood, Wheelwright, & Burrows, 1997).\nUnfortunately, market women do not report crimes to the\npolice.\nThe British Chamber of Commerce (2004) reports that the\nmain reasons for businesses not reporting crime were the\nrelatively small or no loss/damage to the premises or prop-\nerty, no confidence in the police response, and too time-con-\nsuming. In addition, FSB (2005) indicates that businesses are\nparticularly reluctant to report minor crimes as well as crimes\nthat occur infrequently. The reluctance of business people to\nreport crimes does not translate into crime prevention; nei-\nther does it cause them to be immune to revictimization.\nWhat it does imply is a conspiracy of silence that rubs public\nrecord of due statistics for crime monitoring, community sur-\nveillance, and resource allocation policies.\nBesides, the limitations of official police recorded crime\nstatistics are well known in that they only indicate the nature\nand level of crime that is reported to the police (Carcach &\nMakkai, 2002). It is even more difficult to accurately deter-\nmine the true nature and extent of business crime because it\nis often left unreported (N. Taylor, 2002).\nAgain, the reasons why business crime is underreported\nare manifold but such underreporting means that police\ncrime statistics do not reveal the true extent of the problem.\nMost business people, who refuse to report crime incidents\ninvolving them, are probably ignorant of the fact that their\nattitude affects the ability of the police to target and tackle\nthe effectiveness of any data collection mechanism is inti-\nmately connected with the preparedness of victims to report\nthe crimes to which they have been subjected (West, 2000).\nIn the face of negative crime-reporting practices of busi-\nness people, small businesses are concerned that the impact\nand seriousness of crime against businesses are overlooked\nby the criminal justice system with an overwhelming number\nof business owners stating that current deterrents are not suf-\nficient to protect small businesses from the threat of criminal\nactivity (FSB, 2005). In traditional African settings, most\nmarkets are places either open or covered, where individuals,\nirrespective of their ethnic nationalities, who have wares to\noffer for sale, meet and agree with their prospective custom-\ners, usually after non-mandatory negotiating interactions, to\nexchange goods for money.\nFor the peculiar nature of policing in Nigeria, market\nwomen do not need to be convinced that the Nigeria police\nare, even if illegitimately, too preoccupied with maintaining\nthe peace in other public spaces, in which the presence of\nwealthy government officials and politicians is more perva-\nsive, particularly to protect from harm than embark on less\nrewarding market patrols. Customarily, therefore, market\nwomen are accustomed to engaging members of vigilante\ngroups to secure their wares. In this particular circumstance,\nthese traders probably took the safety of their wares in the\nmarket for granted. As a result, they did not arrange private\nsecurity and paid dearly for that negligence.\nThe effects of crime on market women's businesses can be\ndevastating for the wider community in the following regard:\nIt often subjects women traders to repeat victimization and\ndisruptive turnover; crime affects their ability to meet their\ncustomers' deadlines, attract new customers, and ultimately\ncause them to face the risk of businesses closing down and\nputting local patronage at risk. Business crimes affect profit-\nability; deter investment and scarce financial resources are\ndrained partly through crime prevention measures.\nOn the whole, crime is a drain on the economy, inhibiting\nprogress and damaging competitiveness. It imposes direct\nand indirect costs on the business, and it is often the impact\nof crime, rather than the direct cost, which is most devastat-\ning (Robson & Teague, 2005). The businesses of market\nwomen are usually done on a small scale. This makes their\nenterprises particularly vulnerable to collapse, as they lack a\ncompetitive market edge, and hence experience greater dif-\nficulty in absorbing the costs of victimization (Fisher &\nfor these reasons that market women whose businesses fall\nvictim to crime are often left to bear the cost alone or in con-\njunction with their friends and family members.\nDespite the likelihood of women seeming too naturally\nscared about crime, it is alarming that studies have found out\nthat even businesses are somewhat resigned to the experi-\nrespondents were reconciled to accepting victimization as a\nfact of entrepreneurial life--a natural cost of doing business.\nAllegations of a \"grudging acceptance [by retailers] that theft\nis a fact of [business] life\" have also been noted in Australia\nAt this juncture, the consistent finding that commercial\npremises face a greater risk of criminal victimization and\nrevictimization than their residential counterparts (Bamfield,\n&Terlouw, 1996) is of particular relevance, especially to\nsmall business enterprises, where multiple or chronic victim-\n& Hopkins, 1998). All these make the lack of interest in\nreporting of business offenses by market women seem\nnormative.\nBeyond that, the commercial strength of market women\nhas not attained the level at which they can, without being\nprodded, insure their wares for the purposes of risk\nmanagement; it is high time these traders appreciated the\nbroader context of doing businesses that must succeed. There\nis hardly a way the environment and its components, which\nsometimes have counterproductive impact on business activ-\nities will not, in some subtle ways, frustrate the crime-report-\ning initiatives of market women. In reality, the boundaries\nbetween the business and public domains are far from dis-\ncrete, and hence, the effects of crime against businesses\nreverberate throughout the society (Cromie, 1993; Fisher,\nThe organized and unorganized private sectors of the\nNigerian economy, for example, contribute significantly to\nsituations that threaten the well-being of businesses, even if\nthey facilitate domestic capital investment, employment\ngrowth, gross domestic product, and economic well-being of\nthe country, in general. Therefore, any assault on the busi-\nness sector is, therefore, an assault on business strength, eco-\nnomic vigor, and social well-being of all Nigerians. It is the\nrealization of this that makes an inquiry into crime-reporting\npractices of market women irresistible, at this time.\nSocial Action of Marx Weber was used as the theoretical\nframework of this study. His school of thought holds sociol-\nogy as a comprehensive science of the subjective meanings\nof the understandable motives of human actors. These sub-\njective meanings are attached to human actions in their\nmutual orientations within specific sociocultural contexts.\nTherefore, any behavior outside of this web, as Weber insists,\nfalls outside the purview of sociology. It is probably in this\ncontext that Secher (1962) credited Weber with the belief\nthat an action is \"social,\" if the acting individual takes\naccount of the behavior of others and is thereby oriented in\nits course.\nIn the context of crime against market women and their\nreporting practices, the emphasis of this theory is on how\nshared values encourage or frustrate individual action in\nrespect of how or how not to respond to issues of business\nvictimization. This theory tries to explain how actors and\nsociety interact in the aftermath of crime. Market women\nvictims just do not base their crime-reporting decision mak-\ning on the contextual issues only, they often look beyond,\nespecially at the broader interactional implications of their\ncrime control initiatives for gainful future integration in the\ncultural milieu. Surprisingly, business crime has received\nrelatively little attention from the U.K. government and\ncriminologists despite the fact that it can have a significant\nprevention efforts have similarly focused on households and\nindividuals, because they are the victims of a higher propor-\ntion of crimes than businesses (Burrows & Hopkins, 2005).\nWhile interest in business victimization has increased in\nrecent years, research in this domain is still limited and more\nwork has been done in countries other than Australia (Fisher\nTilley & Hopkins, 1998) and Nigeria. It is against this back-\ndrop that this study aims to contribute to the knowledge base\n4 SAGE Open\nof crimes against women's businesses through the involve-\nment of the criminal justice system, in Oyo town, Nigeria, by\nproviding answers to the following questions:\nResearch Question 1: What is the nature of crime com-\nmonly committed against market women in Oyo town?\nResearch Question 2: How do the women victims handle\nthe reporting of crimes committed against their\nbusinesses?\nResearch Question 3: How satisfied are these market\nwomen victims with the outcomes of the reports of their\nvictimization?\nMaterials and Method\nThe study location was Oyo town in Oyo state (Figure 1).\nOyo is mostly inhabited by the Yoruba people. The popula-\ntion for this study comprises residents, especially female\nFigure 1. The study site in Nigeria.\nNote. The map of Nigeria shows the country divided into 36 states and the capital Abuja. Lagos in the southwest, Kano in the north, and Rivers, whose\ncapital city is Port-Harcourt, in the south are the main business districts.\ntraders aged 18 years and above, that is, young and old\nfemale traders who are resident in Oyo town where their\nexperiences of crime incidents make them prone to reporting\ncrime in the way they do. The study randomly selected 225\nwomen traders at Akesan, Sabo, and Mosadoba markets in\nOyo town, as respondents to copies of a questionnaire.\nThe questionnaire was crafted in English but was trans-\nlated to Yoruba for respondents who did not understand\nEnglish. The research assistant filled out the questionnaire\nafter the respondents had answered the questions. Even those\nof the respondents who could write, judging by their power\nof expression, were not inclined to do so because of the\ninfringement of doing so on their sales' time. The three mar-\nkets were randomly selected. As observation later revealed,\nthe population of traders in the three markets, the number of\ntheir customers, and the level of socioeconomic activities\ngoing on there, showed that they have the requirements to\nserve as representative samples of others.\nIn addition, these markets are located at different geo-\ngraphical areas of Oyo town with diversity in socioeconomic\nand cultural characteristics. These make selected respondents\nfrom the markets quite representative and therefore suitable\nfor the study. Also, five focus group discussions (FGDs) were\nconducted to capture the underlying thoughts that inform\nmarket women's crime-reporting practices, their sociodemo-\ngraphic characteristics and suggestions for improving their\ncrime-reporting responses, so as to guarantee safer commer-\ncial interactions and livelihoods in Oyo markets.\nThis study adopted the probability and non-probability\nsample procedures. Therefore, random sampling and purpo-\nsive sampling methods were used in selecting study sites and\nrespondents. FGD respondents were selected through purpo-\nsive sampling (opinion leaders such as market women lead-\ners, police officers, customers, and members of civil rights\nfighters).\nConcepts and Measurements\nThe dependent variables used for the study are whether mar-\nket women reported their victimization experiences prior to\nthe survey. The independent variables are age, place of trad-\ning, marital status, educational level, occupation, religion,\nand volume of trade. For knowledge about crime prevention,\nrespondents who mentioned more than three ways of pre-\nventing victimization were classified as having good or high\nknowledge about prevention. From the causes of crime\nagainst market women, only three of those options are cor-\nrect, those who mentioned any of the options were regarded\nas having good knowledge about the causes, whereas others\nwere categorized as having poor knowledge of the causes of\nvictimization in this article.\nSampling Design and Selection\nFurthermore, these markets are heterogeneous enough to\ncontain the diversity in sociocultural, political, and economic\ncharacteristics required for representativeness in the study.\nThese make respondents quite suitable for the study. The\nsample size for this study was 225 female respondents (18\nyears and above) in Oyo town to study their crime-reporting\npractices and the efficacy of such practices in containing\nbusiness victimization in Oyo town. For the reason that bor-\nders on education policy in Nigeria, it is a crime for a school-\nage child to be engaged in commercial activities during\nschool hours. As a result, the study did not envisage finding\nschool-age children selling in open markets, where they\ncould be easily located by government officials who might\narrest them for engaging in illegality.\nAlso, five FGDs were conducted. The sociodemographic\ncharacteristics of respondents make them appropriate for the\nprovision of suggestions that could help strengthen security\nconsciousness and make Oyo market women operate their\nbusinesses in a safer Oyo community. This study adopted the\nprobabilityandnon-probabilitysampleprocedures.Therefore,\nrandom sampling and purposive sampling methods were\nused. Key informant interview respondents were selected\nthrough purposive sampling (opinion leaders such as market\nleaders, key community leaders such as the head of the vigi-\nlante group, a chief, and a police officer).\nData Collection\nBoth quantitative and qualitative methods were used for data\ngathering. While the questionnaire method was used to fetch\nquantitative data, FGD provided complementary qualitative\ndata for the study. Five final-year students of Sociology\nDepartment of the Lagos State University, comprising three\nmen and two ladies, were engaged as assistants who con-\nducted the FGDs and administered copies of the question-\nnaire with the researcher. The research assistants primarily\nused Yoruba language in translating the questions to Yoruba\nrespondents and Pidgin English (commonly called broken\nEnglish, which is understood across Nigeria as the simplest\nmode of informal communication) to translate to other\nrespondents from other ethnic groups. In the FGD, the Pidgin\nEnglish was mainly used.\nThese assistants were rigorously trained on the techniques\nof interviewing people in ways that will prevent respondents\nfrom holding any vital information back or injecting their\npersonal biases. Pre-interview practice sessions were held to\navail the research assistants the skill to administer question-\nnaire, handle tape recorders, and transcribe their contents.\nThese orientation exercises took 5 days. In all, 210 copies of\na questionnaire were administered, retrieved, correctly com-\npleted, and analyzed for the study.\nSample selection\nQuantitative.To make the sample size representative\nof the entire population of market traders in Oyo town in\nthe study area, three markets were randomly picked from\namong the markets in the town. From each of the three mar-\nkets, 70 respondents were randomly selected to respond to\n6 SAGE Open\ncopies of a questionnaire. In all, 210 copies of a question-\nnaire were correctly completed and analyzed for the study.\nFrom these responses, information about respondents'\nsociodemographic characteristics and crime-reporting\npractices were captured.\nQualitative. Five FGDs were conducted to elicit informa-\ntion about crime-reporting responses of market women in\nOyo town to capture the underlying thoughts that keep the\nobserved crime-reporting practices enduring in contempo-\nrary times. The focus group discussants were selected across\ndifferent socioeconomic backgrounds within the study area.\nEach of the FGDs consisted of eight participants. Consent\nforms were administered to all the participants before the\ndiscussions. Tapes, notes, and consent forms were safely\nkept by the researcher.\nData Analysis\nQuantitative data. Returned copies of a completed question-\nnaire were thoroughly edited. Being a pre-coded instrument,\nentry and analyses were facilitated. The quantitative data\ncollected from this survey were subjected to three levels of\nanalysis. The first level involves an examination of the distri-\nbution of the respondents according to selected characteris-\ntics. This is because the behavior of individuals in society is,\nto a large extent, determined by their personal characteristics\nas well as those of the environment in which they live.\nFor this reason, it is expected that crime-reporting\nresponses will be greatly determined by background charac-\nteristics such as education, age, marital status, and type of\ntrade invested in. To this end, simple percentages were used\nto describe these variables. The second level involves the\nexamination of the pattern of relationship between the inde-\npendent variable, that is, market women and other dependent\nvariables such as crime-reporting practices.\nQualitative data. The discussions from the FGDs were tran-\nscribed and translated verbatim. Analysis involved develop-\ning a system of indexing the data into sets of categories or\ncodes that provided structure to the data based on the research\nobjectives and the topic included in the question guide. A\nqualitative software ZY-index software package for ethno-\ngraphic data was used for textual data analysis. Some strik-\ning expressions were used for verbatim reporting. Data from\nqualitative survey have been extensively used in this article\nto validate quantitative analysis where and when desirable.\nResults\nSocioeconomic Characteristics\nAbout 88.5% of respondents who admitted having been vic-\ntims of crimes are between ages 26 and 40 years holding\nWest African School Certificate (37.8%), First School\nLeaving Certificate (36.7%), National Certificate of\nEducation (19.4%), and First University Degree (6.1%).\nFrom the foregoing, respondents cannot be assumed to be\nignorant traders, who are completely oblivious of the impli-\ncations of the dynamics of crime reporting. Their culture\nmay simply be overwhelming.\nThe marital status of respondents, who have fallen vic-\ntims of crimes, is as follows: married (71.2%), divorced\n24% who are Christians admitted that they have been victims\nof crime and 26.1% that they are not. However, 70% of the\nrespondents who are Muslims said that they have been vic-\ntims of crime, whereas 67.4% said that they have never been\nvictims of crime. It was not as if, in reality, they were not\nvictimized but being victims of crime, especially in a tradi-\ntional environment, is interpreted to be a kind of punishment\nfor concealed sins. Victimhood, therefore, attracts lots of ste-\nreotypes and stigmatization. This explains why most tradi-\ntional individuals want to avoid being classified as victims,\nat all costs.\nOf the respondents surveyed, 39.7% who accepted ever\ndents who conceded to having reported crimes to the police\nowed. Rather than marriage impeding crime reporting\nbecause of its numerous cultural encumbrances, it provided\ncrime-reporting resources in this study.\nTwenty-one percent of surveyed respondents who\nreported crime to the police hold First School Leaving\nCertificate, West African School Certificate (33.3%),\nNational Certificate of Education (24.6%), and First\nUniversity Degree (10.5%). Education of respondents does\nnot appear to have tilted crime reporting to a direction that\ncould be considered significantly positive or negative. About\n79.4% of the respondents who agreed to have reported crime\nto the police are Muslims, Christians (11.1%) and others\nAlthough Muslim respondents reported more crimes in\nthis study, it should be borne in mind that different religions\nhave their diverse values. While crimes are mostly reported\nby Muslims market women could be due, in part, to their\ntradition, religion, and level of education. Crimes committed\nby known offenders among the traditional Yoruba people are\nusually not formally reported, especially when the victims do\nnot have western education. There are customary structures\nin place to address these.\nThe value of loss that Muslim women respondents\nincurred must have accounted for their high rate of crime\nreporting. Otherwise, Muslims are noted to accept every\nmisfortune that befalls them as an act of God. Right from the\nbeginning of Nigeria, ethnic and religious tensions between\nthe different ethnic nationalities are primary challenges. At\ndifferent times, unpatriotic politicians have intensified the\ncrises by fanning the embers of political sentiments.\nNevertheless, Nigerians from diverse ethnic backgrounds\nstill interact in mutually rewarding contexts in their ordinary\neveryday socioeconomic activities. It is, therefore, common\nin Nigeria to have both Christian and Muslim women selling\nin the same market, without any observable bitterness.\nBeyond these, from their secondary market interactions, pro-\nfound primary relationships that often culminate into inter-\nethnic marriages are known to have developed. On the\nwhole, buying and selling are commonly done by Nigerians\nwithout ethnic resentment.\nThe Nature of Crime Commonly Committed\nAgainst Market Women in Oyo Town\nRegarding the nature of crime and crime reporting, 71.1% of\nthe respondents revealed that their victimization involved\nbeating which caused them severe bodily injuries that neces-\nsitated treatment at nearby clinics, which sometimes resulted\nin outright admission; 15.6% said that it was offensive touch-\ning and 13.3% noted that it was outright rape. The respon-\ndents said that their victimization involved theft of money\nobserved that the offenders threatened persons they found on\ntheir premises; 47.4% said that the offenders actually used\nweapons and 42.1% confessed that no threat whatsoever was\nused.\nFrom the foregoing, it is clear that the offenders did not\nhave any particular crimes other than theft in mind.Therefore,\nthe time of the day in which a crime occurs has influence on\nthe crime-reporting practices of the respondents. About\n21.1% of the respondents who reported crimes to the police\nsaid that the crime took place in the morning, at night (66.7%)\nand did not know precisely when the crime occurred (12.3%).\nMajority of the crime that took place at the market occurred\nat night when power outage was most likely and offenders\nwill have all the liberty in the world to cart away as much\nitems of the market women they could.\nVictims' Handling of Reporting of Crimes\nCommitted Against Women's Businesses\nAvailability of alternative conflict resolution structures in\nOyo town, too, has its influence, no matter how subtle, on the\ncrime-reporting practices of market women. While 65.8% of\nthe reported their victimization to town association, 18.4%\nreported to traditional rulers and 15.8% to Oodua People's\nCongress (OPC). In Nigeria, the capacity of community resi-\ndents to report crime has been badly frustrated by fear of\noffender retaliation. For instance, in the time past, one noto-\nrious armed robberAnini became a national threat so extraor-\ndinary that Babangida as head of a military government\nasked Etim Iyam, the then inspector general of police, after a\nsupreme council meeting, \"My friend, where is Anini?\" No\nNigerian was courageous enough to report his or her exploits\nfor fear of reprisal.\nOn arrest, Anini confessed that his gang had George\nIyamu, the deputy superintendent of police (DSP) as an\ninsider within the police hierarchy who shielded, would\nreveal police secrets to them, and would give them logistic\nsupport such as arms to carry out robbery operations. After\neach operation, Iyamu joined the criminals in sharing their\nloot.\nAs a result, he had choice buildings in Benin City as his\ninvestment of the loots he obtained from men of the under-\nworld (Anini, 1986). Imagine, if any foolhardy community\nresident had gone to report Anini and provided useful infor-\nmation to the police which their ring leader, DSP Iyamu,\nknew about, the consequence for that reporter meant nothing\nshort of death.\nRounding off a regime of crime typified by Anini in the\ncontext of fear-invoking criminality in Nigeria, Omo-Agege\n(1986) in his judgment said thatAnini will forever be remem-\nbered in the history of crime in this country, but it would be\nof unblessed memory. Few people if ever, would give the\nname to their children. As a result of this, public trust in the\npolice has become incredibly low. Therefore, most of the\ncommunity residents who are victimized willingly explore\ncultural structures for solution to their crime challenges,\ninstead of notifying the police.\nNevertheless, 48.7% who reported their victimization to\nthe police said that the police believed their reported crime\naccounts, 35.9% said that the police arrested the offenders,\nand 15.4% said that the police ignored them and their com-\nplaints. Similarly, social network influences have a signifi-\ncant effect on the crime-reporting practices of market women\nin Oyo town. The people to whom the respondents confided\nin about the occurrence of crimes determined the direction of\ntheir crime-reporting preferences as 11.8% received support\nfrom those they told, 27.5% said that such individuals\nadvised them, while 60.8% actually said that these individu-\nals reported their victimizations to the police on their behalf.\nSatisfaction of Market Women Victims With\nOutcomes of Crimes Reported to the Police\nHow comfortable are these market women victims with the\nprocesses involved in the formal reporting of their victimiza-\ntion? None of the respondents were very satisfied with the\npolice handling of their complaints. While 65.8% are dissat-\nisfied with the police, 18.4% are satisfied and 15.8% found it\nextremely difficult to define their state of satisfaction with\npolice services. That majority of the respondents who\nreported their victimization experiences to the police ended\ndissatisfied bears eloquent statistical testimony to the level\nof trust disconnect between the community and the police.\nDespite all the shortcomings of the police, market women\nshowed a willingness to assist in making the police functional\n8 SAGE Open\nfor public good by suggesting a way out of the commercial\ninsecurity of women at Oyo markets. Fifty percent of the\nrespondents suggested that the government should invest in\nmass security education in the three main Nigerian ethnic lan-\nguages (Igbo, Hausa, and Yoruba) and 50% recommended\nthat voters should elect good leaders for Nigeria in future who\nwould be committed to ensuring public safety.\nIt is understandable when some respondents denied ever\nhaving been victims because this has its roots in cultural ori-\nentation. The meaning of crime in Yoruba is \"oran,\" which is\noften interpreted as a tragedy. In typically cultural parlance,\nthe criminal (odaran), his or her crime (oran), and the vic-\ntims are symptoms of varying layers of misfortune.Therefore,\ncrime is often ascribed to cultural retribution of some kind.\nExcept a respondent has had a deep sense of detachment\nfrom his or her natural entrapment by cultural socialization,\nto accept being a victim of crime in a deeply cultural envi-\nronment is as clear as indicating that one is a cultural sinner.\nIn the study site, when someone is victimized, he or she is\ncommonly assumed to be atoning to a secretly committed\nagainst the gods and rhythm of traditional order (cultural\nsin). However, this claim has roots only in stereotypes, which\ndrive interaction among deeply traditional members of the\ncommunity. Among educated indigenes, this does not enjoy\nany generic and considerable acceptance. For the fact that\ncrime victims are most likely to be stigmatized in traditional\nsurroundings, every victim would prefer to conceal his or her\nstate of victimhood to avoid some embarrassing interpreta-\ntions and painful cultural labeling. Qualitative data support\nmost of the quantitative findings as insights from the contri-\nbutions of respondents of in-depth interview indicate :\nRespondent A observed as follows:\nBurglary of locked up shops is the most common crime that\nmarket women face in Oyo town. We report them to market\nleaders who then notify the police. However, by conduct, the\ndifference between the police and offenders is not clear. In\nNigeria, police corruption is not strange to anyone. Therefore, no\none is immune to police extortion. Occasionally, the police in\nassociation with immigration officials raid open markets in which\nmarket women do their legitimate businesses. The police use\nforce to retrieve smuggled goods. When these happen, Nigerians\nunanimously condemn the police whose duty it was to have\nprevented the entry of all these banned items, in the first place.\nHowever, markets women's associations may reach special\narrangements with the police for protection which might involve\nmoney payment; it is not common for police to collect money\nfrom individual market women, ostensibly to provide protection.\nThis is not to deny the truth that the police usually make reporters\nfeel stupid as they request them to report at their stations at odd\ntimes when the victims are supposed to be making efforts to\novercome their losses. At the end of the day, the offender may\nnever get apprehended and losses too never recovered. This is\ndouble loss of some kind to us [market women].\nRespondent B observed,\nI have no confidence in the police. Whenever they are alerted,\nthey blow siren to alert the robbers of their arrival. In effect, the\noffenders would just leisurely walk away, undetected. What\nhappened next? The police would begin to harass and arrest\ninnocent citizens as suspects of more scandalous crimes. To bail\nthemselves out from police net, they are made to pay various\nforms of illegitimate dues. This is really a humiliating tradition\nin the face of available best practices in crime control that\ncharacterize the 21st century.\nRespondent C observed,\nIt is like the bad eggs outnumber the ethical ones in the Nigeria\npolice. Government should totally overhaul the police and\nprovide jobs for our teeming youths to reduce the threat of\nburglary to the economy of market women in Oyo town.\nA female FGD argued,\nThe only way to counter deep-seated traditional fears of Oyo\nwomen in terms of crime reporting of their abusers is to embark\non carefully coordinated crime-reporting education which will\ncommit them to reporting without inducing the police and\novercoming all cultural inhibitions to assert their rights in a\ncivilized manner.\nAnother female FGD observed,\nThe general air of discrimination against women on the basis of\ntheir sex has widely spawned a culture that rejects modern\nvalues which enjoin men to show consideration to women and\ntheir concerns. Except market women rise as a critical vessel for\ncrime reporting, their economy may become more endangered\nin future.\nRespondent F, a female cloth seller, said,\nWhen her trade experienced crime some few months before the\nstudy, she was extremely traumatized. She felt the urge to report\nhoping she would recover some of the items stolen but she feared\nthe offender might revenge after he must have been arrested,\nprosecuted, punished and released. The police cannot be trusted\nto keep the particulars of crime reporters confidential, as\nexpected.\nRespondent G, an adult female smoked-fish seller, said,\nCases of abuse of market women are though disturbing, some of\nthem derive from long-standing practices that we have\ngrudgingly tolerated for years. We have started to feel the impact\nof their onslaught more deeply and painfully. This informs our\nunsolicited embrace of formal crime-reporting choices in\nmodern times.\nRespondent H, an old female pepper seller, said,\nSuch business abuses by offenders were part of a pattern of\ndisturbing behaviour for years among young men in Oyo\ncommunities. Most of their sympathizers often attempted to\nreduce the effect of their misconduct by claiming that it was the\nbad economy that drove young men to violate the rights of\nmarket women in Oyo town. Beyond this, if all economy-\naffected youth have to unleash their anger on market women,\nwill their mothers still remain in most homes perpetuating\nmotherhood activities?\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nIt is a verifiable statement that many crimes against market\nwomen go unreported. This is probably so because of the\nlevel of confidence the traders have in the police ability to\nensure recovery of stolen items through prompt apprehen-\nsion of criminals. In the colonial epoch, the style and princi-\nples of policing have been described as anti-people by several\nbetween the police and the policed in the study site must\nhave taken its root from this unpleasant beginning.\nColonial police had a universal agenda. Everywhere there\nwas colonialism, the focus of the colonial police was to foist\ncompulsory order, tolerable or not, on the citizenry.\nTherefore, to ensure that colonial subjects obeyed their mas-\nters hook, line and sinker, the colonial police probably, inad-\nvertently, adopted adversarial policing which worsened the\nalready suspicious civilian/police relations in Nigeria.\nFor the foregoing and other reasons, market women in\nNigeria, generally, and those in Oyo town, in particular, are\nencouraged to develop the culture of business insurance,\nnow that insurance policy has been liberalized, so that their\nexpectation of compensation could enhance their survival\ncompetence and crime-reporting interest in the aftermath of\nvictimization. In the light of crime-reporting reality on\nground, the study suggests that market women in Oyo should\ndeemphasize spiritual security of their economic wealth and\ninvest in formal security channels and insurance.\nThe truth that most market women in Oyo town appear to\nignore is that crimes against their businesses are usually\ncrimes of opportunity. In some instances, individuals who\nare not career offenders may offend simply because market\nwomen leave their precious items without capable guardians.\nWith the economic dislocation that inundates most Nigerian\nenvironments with employable but unemployed youth, frus-\ntrated individuals who hitherto did not have criminal inten-\ntion may take advantage of carelessly exposed items in the\nmarkets. In sum, if market women continue to make their\nmarkets easy for criminals to steal from, chances are, every\nsituational criminal who otherwise might not have taken to\ncriminality will take advantage of this porous market situa-\ntion, to help themselves.\nAlthough the history of community police relation in\nNigeria has been described as frosty as the idea of policing\nimposed on the country by the colonial masters was calcu-\nlated to foster an antagonism between the policed and the\n1970), a lot could still be achieved in terms of public secu-\nrity, if Nigerians decide to make good of a bad job. It is,\ntherefore, concluded that making crime against their busi-\nnesses risky, costly, and unrewarding through proactive and\nprotective measures is about the best option that Oyo market\nwomen could explore in their circumstance to sustain their\nbusinesses.\nRecommendations\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Market women should overcome cultural limitations\nand begin to disclose crimes they have been tradition-\nally disinclined to report.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Public policy should simplify crime-reporting proce-\ndures to further encourage women to report crimes\ninvolving them and their varied interests.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 In addition to imbibing the culture of crime reporting,\nmarket women should insure their business risks with\ninsurance companies to have something concrete in\nterms of compensation to fall back on times of inevi-\ntable victimization. Therefore, market women should\ntake advantage of the ongoing (insurance liberaliza-\ntion) simplified insurance conditions, through group\napplication, to insure their wares.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Market women should save their money in banks on a\ndaily basis to reduce their losses at each victimization\nepisode by taking advantage of the (banking liberal-\nization) softened banking conditions, which encour-\nage diverse saving packages that are convenient for\npetty traders. Most banks have branches all over in\nNigeria and through their numerous aggressive mar-\nketers are reaching out to petty traders to avail them-\nselves of the available packages that ease bankability.\nAs yet, Nigerian banks do not discriminate against\ncustomers on any grounds.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Market women should invest more on crime preven-\ntion strategies for less cost of business crime.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The mind-set that crimes against businesses are natu-\nral costs of doing business and therefore facts of busi-\nness life should be changed because it is tolerant of\ncrimes and criminals.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Women should report crime against their businesses,\nso that criminal data emanating from them could form\ncritical guiding components for the development of\nculturally based interventions.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAlemika, E.
