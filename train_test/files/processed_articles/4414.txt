Neurons born in the SVZ migrate along\nthe RMS (rostral migratory stream) to become OB (olfactory\nbulb) interneurons. While migrating, immature interneurons\nmaintain a simplified morphology with a single leading\nprocess as they migrate in chains (Lois et al., 1996). OB\ninterneurons do not attain full morphological maturity until\nthey reach their appropriate destination within the OB. This\nentire process from specification to functional integration\ntakes 5\u00ad9 days in the adult mouse (Petreanu and Alvarez-\nBuylla, 2002). As OB interneuron specification and complete\nmorphological maturity are separated substantially in both\nspace and time, this is an ideal system for studying the\nmorphological development of neurons in the postnatal\nbrain.\nWnt signalling is integral to both neuronal specification\nand development. In the postnatal brain, Wnts are important\nin stem cell proliferation (Adachi et al., 2007) and have been\nshown to be involved in both differentiation (Lie et al., 2005)\nand neurite development of hippocampal granule cells (Rosso\nto what roles specific Wnt signalling pathways play in these\ncells. Increased dendritic complexity was shown to be\ndependent on b-catenin; however, this effect did not require\nLEF (lymphoid enhancer factor)/TCF (T-cell factor)-mediated\ntranscriptional activation (Yu and Malenka, 2003). Moreover,\nYu and Malenka demonstrate that activated LEF-1 has the\nopposite effect of activated b-catenin, and suppressed\nneurite outgrowth in hippocampal cultures. It is therefore\nlikely that b-catenin influences dendritic growth through its\nrole in modulating cell adhesion and the actin cytoskeleton,\nindependent of Wnt signalling (Yu and Malenka, 2003;\nWnt7b has been shown to increase the complexity of\nhippocampal neurons in culture via the non-canonical JNK\n(c-Jun N-terminal kinase) Wnt pathway (Rosso et al., 2005).\nThe addition of Wnt inhibitor sFRP-1 (secreted frizzled-\nrelated protein 1) to these cultures not only blocked the\neffect but also simplified the morphology of the neurons\nbeyond that of control cultures, indicating an endogenous\nrole for the non-canonical Wnt pathway in the morphological\n1 To whom correspondence should be addressed (email sam.pleasure@ucsf.edu).\nAbbreviations: BMP, bone morphogenic protein; CB, calbindin; CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; DAPI, 49,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; DKK-1, Dickkopf-related protein 1; JNK, c-Jun\nN-terminal kinase; LEF, lymphoid enhancer factor; LRP5/6, LDL (low-density lipoprotein)-receptor-related protein 5/6; NPC, neural progenitor cell; OB, olfactory bulb; OSN,\nolfactory sensory axon; PFA, paraformaldehyde; RMS, rostral migratory stream; sFRP-1, secreted frizzled-related protein 1; SVZ, subventricular zone; TDBTN, total dendritic\nbranch tip number; TH, tyrosine hydroxylase; VGAT, vesicular c-aminobutyric acid transporter.\nE 2011 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://\ncreativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is\nproperly cited.\ndevelopment of hippocampal cells. The JNK pathway was also\nshown to increase neurite outgrowth in ESFT (Ewing sarcoma\nfamily tumour) cells, which can be stimulated by Wnt3a or\ncanonical inhibitor DKK-1 (Dickkopf-related protein 1) (Endo\net al., 2008). However, sFRP-1 has also been shown to\nincrease dendritic outgrowth in a non-Wnt-dependent\nmanner in retinal ganglion cells (Rodriguez et al., 2005).\nRecently, Wnt5a signalling via the Wnt/Ca+ pathway was\nshown to stimulate dendritic spine morphogenesis in\nhippocampal neurons (Varela-Nallar et al., 2010). These\nfindings suggest that specific Wnt molecules may play\ndifferent roles depending on cellular context. It is still\nunknown as to whether Wnts play a role in the morphological\ndevelopment of SVZ-derived OB interneurons; although it\ndoes appear that the Wnt/b-catenin pathway is important for\nthe proliferation of progenitor cells in the SVZ (Adachi et al.,\n2007). Interestingly, traditionally non-canonical Wnt ligands\nWnt5a and Wnt7b, but not canonical Wnts, are expressed by\nOB interneurons themselves (Shimogori et al., 2004).\nUsing soluble Wnt ligands Wnt5a and Wnt3a, and inhibitors\nDKK-1 and sFRP-1 on SVZ progenitor cell cultures, we show\nthat non-canonical Wnt signalling is necessary for normal\nmorphological maturation of OB interneurons. In our culture\nsystem the activation of the non-canonical Wnt pathway acts\nin opposition to canonical Wnt/b-catenin signalling. Moreover,\nevidence from the Wnt5a knockout mouse indicates that\nnormal morphological development of OB interneurons is\ndisrupted in the absence of endogenous Wnt5a.\nAnimals\nAll animal protocols were approved by the UCSF IACUC. P5\nCD1s (Charles River) were used for cultures. Wnt5a knockout\nmice (Yamaguchi et al., 1999) were backcrossed more than 7\ngenerations with C57BL/6. Pregnant mice were killed at E18.5\n(embryonic day 18.5) via cervical dislocation after being\nanaesthetized with isofluorane. Mutants were identified\nvisually using the very distinctive Wnt5a phenotype. Males\nand females were used for all experiments.\nIn situ hybridization\nP1 brain tissues were collected after intracardiac perfusion\nwith 4% (w/v) PFA (paraformaldehyde) and post-fixed with\n4% PFA overnight at 4\u00b0C. Fixed tissues were cryoprotected in\n20% sucrose before embedding in OCT (optimal cutting\ntemperature) compound (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA,\nU.S.A.). Tissues were cut on a cryostat at 20 mm and directly\nmounted on to Colorfrost slides (Fisher Scientific, Houston, TX,\nU.S.A.). The slides were stored at 280\u00b0C before use. For in situ\nhybridization, slides were warmed to room temperature and\ntreated with proteinase K (50 mg/ml) for 2 min, and fixed with\nacetic anhydride in 0.1 M triethanolamine, pH 8.0, for 10 min,\nfollowed by three PBS washes. Slides were incubated with\novernight incubation with a digoxigenin-labelled probe (300\nng/ml). Five high-stringency washes were performed with\n0.26SSC at 65\u00b0C. Slides were then incubated with horseradish\nAP (alkaline phosphatase)-conjugated anti-digoxigenin and\nNBT (nitroblue tetrazolium)/BCIP (5-bromo-4-chloro-indolyl\nphosphate) (Roche) for signal detection. The non-radioactive\nprobes were made from EST (expressed sequence tag) clones\nfor Wnt2b and Wnt5a, which were purchased from Open\nBiosystems, and the Wnt3a cDNA plasmid was a gift from Roel\nImmunohistochemistry\nBrains were processed using standard methods.

One-half of the treated medium was\nreplaced each day. The cultures were analysed after 4 days of\ntreatment.\nImage analysis and quantification\nThree biological replicates of each experiment were per-\nformed. For in vitro experiments, cells from 3 to 5 620\nmagnification images were quantified for each replicate of\neach culture condition, including at least 100 cells from each\ncondition. Cells were excluded from the analysis if all dendrite\ntips could not be clearly visualized.\nOne mutant and one littermate control animal were\nanalysed from three separate litters. Cell counts from\nstandardized counting boxes in three coronal sections of\neach brain were averaged for both the Pax6 and CB staining.\nDAPI counterstains were used to confirm the presence of cell\nbodies. PGL width was measured in four places for each TH\nand VGAT stained section and averaged. These values for each\nanimal were then pooled and compared across genotypes.\nStatistical analysis\nResults are expressed as means\u00a1S.E.M.

Any\nvalue of P#0.05 was considered significant.\nRESULTS\nWnt5a and non-canonical Wnt signalling\nincrease neurite complexity\nTo study the role of Wnt ligands in regulating the neuronal\ndifferentiation of SVZ-derived OB interneurons, we took\nadvantage of the ease of generating these cells in vitro via\ndifferentiation from neural precursors. We cultured neural\nprecursor cells from the SVZ of P5 mice, then placed them in\nserum-containing medium for 24 h to induce differentiation.\nWe then treated the cultures with soluble Wnt ligands and\ninhibitors for 4 days, and then analysed the neuritic complexity\nof the resulting neurons. This experiment is designed to\nexamine the effects of Wnt ligands on differentiation rather\nthan neuronal specification since the ligands were not added\nuntil well after the global differentiation stimulus of serum\nwas added to the cells. The largely non-canonical Wnt ligand,\nWnt5a, and the largely canonical Wnt ligand, Wnt3a, had\nmarkedly different effects on neurite development in these\nFigure 1 Wnt5a and Wnt3a have opposite effects on neurite development\nNeurons are identified by staining with Tuj1 (red) and MAP2 (green) antibodies.

Wnt5a treatment led to increased\nneurite growth, whereas Wnt3a inhibited neurite outgrowth.\nWe used a simple measure of neurite complexity, TDBTN (total\ndendritic branch tip number) (Rosso et al., 2005), to assess\nthese findings in a quantitative way. We found that TDBTN was\nsignificantly higher in cultures treated with Wnt5a compared\nwith controls, and cultures treated with Wnt3a significantly\ndecreased TDBTN compared with control cultures treated with\nvehicle only (Figure 1F).\nOur results imply that Wnt5a leads to distinct effects on\nneuritic maturation in these cultures compared with Wnt3a,\npossibly due to differences in Wnt signalling pathway\nactivation (Wnt/b-catenin signalling versus non-canonical\nsignalling). To tease apart the differences in these effects, we\ntreated the cultures with different families of extracellular Wnt\ninhibitors to determine the pathway specificity. When sFRP-1\nwas applied to cultures, an inhibitor that blocks both canoni-\ncal and non-canonical Wnt signalling by sequestering Wnt\nligands and so they cannot bind their cognate Frizzled receptors\n(Rattner et al., 1997), the neurite complexity was decreased\n(Figure 1D) and TDBTN was significantly lower than in control\ncultures (Figure 1F). In contrast, cultures treated with DKK-1,\nan inhibitor that specifically blocks canonical Wnt signalling\nby interfering with LRP5/6 [LDL (low-density lipoprotein)-\nreceptor-related protein 5/6] co-receptors (Mao et al., 2001),\nshowed an increase in neurite complexity (Figure 1E) reflected\nby a significant increase in TDBTN (Figure 1E). Our results\nimply that canonical and non-canonical Wnt signalling have\nmarkedly different effects on the morphological maturation of\nneurons derived from the mouse SVZ. In addition, the effects\nof inhibitors on cultures without the addition of exogenous\nWnts indicate that under normal culture conditions Wnt\nsignalling is probably a potent regulator of neurite outgrowth,\nboth positively and negatively.\nWnt signalling plays a sustained role in neurite\ndifferentiation in culture\nWnt signalling appears to be a significant regulator of neurite\ndevelopment in neural precursor cells during the first few\ndays in culture. However, given the profound roles of\ncanonical Wnt signalling in neural precursor proliferation\nand cell fate acquisition, we wanted to determine whether\nWnt signalling plays an ongoing role in the growth of\nneurites or whether the Wnts predominantly act at the stage\nof initial neurite outgrowth, perhaps by influencing the cell\nfate acquisition process itself or initial stages of neurite\npolarization. In addition, if Wnt signalling plays a role in\nneurite maturation when the interneurons reach the OB, then\nthe effects of Wnts should be ongoing even after several\ndays.\nTo address this, we used neurons differentiated from SVZ\ncultures that were allowed to grow in serum without\nadditives for 72 h. We then treated the cells with Wnts and\nWnt inhibitors starting at this later time point. It was\napparent that neurites continued to extend during this\ngrowth period in control cultures (Figures 2A and 2B) and\nthis was reflected in the TDBTN (Figure 2G). Like at the earlier\nstage of neurite outgrowth, we found that Wnt5a increased\nthe complexity of neurite outgrowth significantly over what\nwe observed in controls and Wnt3a inhibited the complexity\nFigure 2 Effects of Wnts signalling on growth of neurites in later cultures\nWnts and Wnt inhibitors affect neuron development up to 96 h after\nspecification.

The\nretardation of outgrowth in the sFRP-1 condition compared\nwith the acceleration in the DKK-1 condition suggests an\nongoing balance of endogenous non-canonical and canonical\nWnt signalling that acts to regulate the rate and extent of\nneurite growth and complexity throughout the culture period.\nCellular organization of the OB is intact in\nWnt5a mutant mice\nSince there are many Wnt ligands in the genome and there is\nextensive redundancy, examples of clear loss-of-function\nphenotypes for Wnt ligands are not that common. However,\nwe wanted to determine whether there is a role for Wnt5a in\nregulating olfactory interneuron neurite development in vivo.\nPrevious reports showed that Wnt5a is expressed in the early\npostnatal mouse OB periglomerular (PGC) and granule (GC)\ncells (Shimogori et al., 2004). First though we examined the\ndistribution of canonical Wnt signalling during the early\npostnatal phase. Interestingly we found using the Bat-gal\nmice (Maretto et al., 2003) that P1 mice have ongoing\nsignalling in the SVZ but little evidence of this in the RMS or\nwithin the OB (Figure 3A). This may be indicative of our\nmodel that non-canonical Wnt ligands may have a more\nprominent effect on the OB interneurons as they arrive in the\nOB and begin to mature. Indeed, we found that Wnt5a is\nexpressed in GCs, PGCs, and at the base of the RMS at both\nP1 and P5 (Figures 3B and 3E). Therefore, as immature\ninterneurons reach the OB after migrating through the RMS,\nthey begin to express Wnt5a and also encounter already-\nestablished neurons expressing Wnt5a as they seek to\nintegrate themselves into the local network. To determine\nthe expression of potentially relevant canonical Wnt ligands,\nwe examined the expression of Wnt3a, Wnt2b and Wnt1, all\npreviously examined by others in these structures as well\nto be expressed at high levels primarily in the fimbrial\nneuroepithelium at P1 (Figures 3C and 3D) and were unable\nto see convincing evidence for Wnt1 expression at this age\n(results not shown). Given the recent evidence that there is\nextensive exposure of the ventricular zone and SVZ to ligands\nsecreted into the CSF (cerebrospinal fluid; Lehtinen et al.,\nFigure 3 Expression of Wnt ligands and Wnt signalling in the SVZ and OB\n(A) Bat-gal reporter mice show that canonical Wnt signalling is prominent in the SVZ at P1 but much less apparent in the RMS and\nOB.

These mice do not\nsurvive past birth, and so we confined our analysis to late\nembryonic stages (E18.5). Since the role of Wnt5a in olfactory\ninterneurons has not been previously examined, we first\nlooked for defects in cell number and organization of PGCs\nand GCs in the OB of Wnt5a knockout mice. A nuclear DAPI\nstain of Wnt5a2/2 OB shows no obvious difference from\nlittermate control animals (Figures 4A and 4B). To examine\nspecific populations of OB interneurons, we turned to\nantibodies that are specific for subpopulations of PGCs and\nGCs. Pax6 is a nuclear marker that labels a subset of both GCs\nand PGCs in the OB (Kohwi et al., 2005) and allows for a\nstraightforward and sensitive measure of the cell density of\nthese groups of neurons. There was no obvious difference\nbetween Wnt5a2/2 mice and littermate controls in the PGC\nlayer (Figures 4C and 4D). CB (calbindin) is another useful\nmarker expressed in the cytoplasm of subsets of OB\ninterneurons (Kohwi et al., 2007), and we found no clear\ndifference in the numbers of CB+ cells in the OB of mutants\nand control mice (Figures 4E and 4F). To quantify the\nFigure 4 Interneuron organization and numbers are normal in Wnt5a mutants\n(A) Wnt5a+/+ and (B) Wnt5a2/2 OB stained with DAPI. (C) Wnt5a+/+ and (D) Wnt5a2/2 OB stained for Pax6.

For Pax6, we\nrestricted our cell counts to PGCs because of the substantial\nnumber of neural progenitor cells that express Pax6 deep in\nthe core of the OB near GCs. This analysis revealed no\ndifference in the number of these cells between mutant and\ncontrol mice (Figure 4G). We also examined CB+ PGCs and\nGCs and found no difference between mutants and controls\n(Figures 4H and 4I).\nWnt5a mutant mice have reduced OB\ninterneuron neuropil\nThe results of our Pax6 and CB analyses indicate that overall\norganization and cell number of several groups of OB\ninterneurons are preserved in the OB of Wnt5a2/2 mice,\nbut we wondered whether their morphology might be altered.\nWe wanted to examine structural differences in the OB of\nWnt5a2/2 mice directly using more sensitive markers of neu-\nropil morphology. TH is expressed in a subset of PGCs (Kohwi\net al., 2007), staining both their cell bodies and dendrites, and\ngives a useful view of PGC morphology. Control mice had\nstrong staining for TH in the PGC layer. This marker highlights\nthe cell bodies of these cells and also stains a reticular network\nof processes that are distributed throughout the PGC layer\nforming a meshwork of dendritic processes around the\nglomeruli (Figure 5A). In Wnt5a2/2 mice, the number of\nPGCs appeared unchanged (similar to our findings with Pax6\nand CB), but the density of neuropil staining was dramatically\ndecreased and the reticular network of dendrites was\nsubstantially less dense (Figure 5B). These differences were\neven more apparent in high-power images of the PGCs\n(Figures 5A' and 5B'). To quantify this difference, we measured\nthe width of the TH+ neuropil in multiple places in the PGC\nlayer to establish a measure of PGC layer neurite complexity\nand found that it was significantly reduced compared with\nlittermate controls (Figure 5C).\nSince periglomerular interneurons are GABAergic, we also\nstained for the VGAT to further examine the neuropil in the\nPGC layer in these mutants. This showed that VGAT staining\nwas markedly decreased in Wnt5a2/2 mice (Figure 5E). At\nhigh power, much of the VGAT staining was punctate in\nappearance, presumably reflecting its localization to pre-\nsynaptic GABAergic terminals, and the density of these\nFigure 5 Reduction of TH\u00a1 and VGAT\u00a1neuropil in Wnt5a mutant mice\n(A) Wnt5a+/+ mice (high-power inset A') and (B) Wnt5a2/2 (high-power inset B') mice stained for TH.

In addition, as with TH, the thickness of the PGC layer\nwas much reduced in mutants (Figure 5F).\nDISCUSSION\nOur results show that the morphological development of OB\ninterneurons derived from the SVZ is dependent on Wnt5a,\nwhich likely acts via non-canonical Wnt signalling to increase\nneurite complexity. Blockade of Wnt signalling in SVZ-derived\nneural precursor cells in vitro using the non-specific Wnt\ninhibitor sFRP-1 resulted in a simplified neuronal morpho-\nlogy, indicating a role for endogenous Wnts in morphological\ndevelopment. In mice lacking Wnt5a, interneuron morpho-\nlogy is disrupted in the OB, while cell number and OB\narchitecture remain intact. Our findings are reminiscent of\nthose in rat hippocampal cells where sFRP-1 blocks neurite\noutgrowth and non-canonical Wnt ligand Wnt7b increases\nMoreover our results support previous reports that Wnt/b-\ncatenin signalling inhibits neurite outgrowth (Ouchi et al.,\ncatenin seems to have the opposite effect when acting\noutside the Wnt pathway (Yu and Malenka, 2003). This\nimplies that Wnt signalling may be important in regulating\ndendrite maturation elsewhere in the nervous system,\nalthough the role of specific Wnt molecules may vary in\ndifferent systems.\nWnt5a is able to act as either a canonical or non-canonical\nWnt ligand depending on receptor context (Mikels and Nusse,\n2006), and previous studies have been ambiguous about\nwhich Wnt pathways are important for morphological\ndevelopment in postnatal neurogenesis (Yu and Malenka,\n2010). In our cell culture experiments, DKK-1, a canonical\nWnt inhibitor acts to increase neurite complexity, and the\nlargely canonical Wnt ligand Wnt3a slows down the rate of\nmorphological development. These findings suggest that\nWnt5a acts on the non-canonical pathway in this system. It\nalso indicates that canonical Wnt signalling directly sup-\npresses dendrite maturation and acts in opposition to non-\ncanonical signalling in SVZ-derived neurons.\nMorphogenesis is a dynamic process in neural precursors\nfrom the SVZ, with migrating and dividing cells of the RMS\ncontinually protruding and retracting processes throughout\nthe cell cycle (Coskun and Luskin, 2002). During migration,\ndividing cells predictably retract their processes immediately\nbefore cytokinesis (Coskun et al., 2007), indicating that cell\ncycle factors also impact morphogenesis. More specifically, a\ngradient of BMPs (bone morphogenic proteins) in the RMS\nhas been shown to influence when SVZ-derived immature\nneurons become postmitotic (Coskun and Luskin, 2002), and\nmay have some additional influence on neurite development\nin vivo. The presence of BMP or other factors in the RMS may\ntherefore contribute additional regulation to neurite out-\ngrowth, providing a bridge for controlling morphogenesis\nwhile immature neurons migrate from the SVZ to the OB.\nOnce in the OB, PGCs form synapses around the glomeruli\nwhere they come into contact with OSNs (olfactory sensory\naxons) and mitral cells. OSNs have been previously shown to\nexpress Wnt5a, and their axons are responsive to Wnt5a in\nvitro (Rodriguez-Gil and Greer, 2008). Additionally, exogenous\napplication of Wnt5a on to OSNs in culture resulted in\nincreased growth cone branching compared with control\ncultures (Rodriguez-Gil and Greer, 2008). These findings\nindicate that Wnt5a in the OB may affect multiple cell\npopulations, including innervation of the glomeruli by OSN. It\nis therefore possible that the thinning of the glomerular layer\nwe observed may reflect decreased innervation by the OSNs,\nand further studies should be conducted to test this possibility.\nPrevious studies have highlighted the role of canonical\nWnt signalling in the regulation of neural precursor\nproliferation and neural cell fate (Yu and Malenka, 2003;\nAdachi et al., 2007). Our findings suggest that canonical Wnt\nsignalling may have an additional role in maintaining already\ndifferentiated OB interneurons in a simplified morphology\neven after cell fate has been determined. In our model, neural\nprecursor cells are exposed to canonical Wnt signalling in the\nSVZ, which along with other factors including BMPs help\nmaintain cells in a simplified morphology. Once the migratory\nneurons reach the anterior RMS and OB and contact mature\ninterneurons in the periglomerular layer and granule layer,\nthey are exposed to Wnt5a via paracrine signalling and\ncomplete their morphologic differentiation. This model\nimplicates a novel interaction between canonical and non-\ncanonical Wnt signalling pathways in the regulation of\nneuronal morphology in OB interneurons that may be\nimportant elsewhere in the nervous system.\n"
