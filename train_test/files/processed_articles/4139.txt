    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: The only treatment for celiac disease (CD) is a gluten-free diet (GFD). However,\nthere is interest among patients in a medical therapy to replace or help with a GFD. Therapies\ninclude gluten-degrading enzymes (glutenases). There are glutenases available marketed as\ndietary supplements that have not been demonstrated to digest the toxic epitopes of gluten.\nMethods: We investigated the contents, claims, and disclaimers of glutenase products and\nassessed patient interest using Google AdWords to obtain Google search frequencies.\nResults: Among 14 glutenase product, all contained proteases, eight contained X-prolyl\nexopeptidase dipeptidyl peptidase IV, two did not state the protease contents, and eight failed\nto specify the name or origin of all proteases. Eleven contained carbohydrases and lipases and\nthree probiotics. One declared wheat and milk as allergens, two contained herbal products\n(type not stated) and one Carica papaya. Thirteen claimed to degrade immunogenic gluten\nfragments, four claimed to help alleviate gastrointestinal symptoms associated with eating\ngluten. Disclaimers included not being evaluated by the US Food and Drug Administration and\nproducts not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. On Google AdWords,\nthe search frequency for the product names and the search terms was 3173 searches per\nmonth.\nConclusions: The names of these products make implicit claims that appear to be supported\nby the claims on the labels and websites for which there is no scientific basis. Google search\ndata suggest great interest and therefore possible use by patients with CD. There needs to be\ngreater oversight of these `drugs'.\n",

It is characterized by an inflamma-\ntory immune reaction in the small intestine trig-\ngered by consumption of gluten, a protein found\nin wheat, barley, and rye. The autoimmune reac-\ntion causes flattening of the villi in the small\nbowel, leading to malnutrition, anemia, osteo-\nporosis, infertility, growth problems in children,\nand other disorders. While the clinical manifes-\ntations vary greatly, acute exposure to gluten in\nCD may cause vomiting, diarrhea, and bloating.\nCurrently, the only available treatment for CD is\ncomplete elimination of gluten-containing foods\nfrom the diet.1\nGluten's markedly high proline content causes a\ncomplex structure with regions which are largely\ninaccessible to human endoproteases, allowing\nlarge, proline-rich gluten fragments to reach the\nsmall intestine intact.2 These large molecules,\nthe products of gluten digestion, are up to 33\namino acid in length remain. These molecules\ninclude the 33-mer -gliadin and the 26-mer\n-gliadin fragments. These particularly toxic\nmolecules enter the small intestinal lamina pro-\npria, become activated by the enzyme tissue\nCommercially available glutenases:\na potential hazard in coeliac disease\nSuneeta Krishnareddy, Kenneth Stier, Maya Recanati, Benjamin Lebwohl\nand Peter HR Green\n Keywords: celiac disease, glutenases, gluten free diet\nCorrespondence to:\nPeter HR Green\nCeliac Disease Center,\nColumbia University\nWashington Avenue, Room\nUSA\npg11@cumc.columbia.edu\nSuneeta Krishnareddy\nKenneth Stier\nMaya Recanati\nBenjamin Lebwohl\nCeliac Disease Center\nat Columbia University,\nColumbia University, New\nYork, USA\nOriginal Research\nTherapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 10(6)\n474 journals.sagepub.com/home/tag\ntransglutaminase that facilitates their binding to\nHLA-DQ2 and -DQ8 on antigen-presenting T\ncells. Binding is optimized with fragments nine\nor more amino acids in length. Therefore, reduc-\ntion of the immunogenicity of gluten requires\nthat it be degraded into fragments shorter than\nnine amino acids before the protein reaches the\nsmall intestine.3 One therapeutic approach is to\nadminister prolyl endopeptidases that can com-\npletely degrade gluten in the stomach, minimiz-\ning the presence of the larger toxic gluten\nfragments. A few enzymes have been proposed\nfor this purpose.\nProlyl oligopeptidases from the organisms\nFlavobacterium meningosepticum, Sphingomonas\ncapsulate, and Myxococcus xanthus have shown\npromise, being able to successfully degrade\nimmunogenic gluten amino acid sequences, but\nthey are optimally active outside gastric pH levels\nand are degraded by pepsin,4 rendering these\nproteases useless in a gastric environment. A\ncombination of aspergillopepsin from Aspergillus\nniger and dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV), an\nX-Pro N-terminal protease from Aspergillus ory-\nzae, was found to successfully degrade small\namounts of gluten in vitro.5 ALV003, produced\nby Alvine Pharmaceuticals (San Carlos, CA), is a\ncombination of a cysteine protease from barley\nand a prolyl endopeptidase from Sphingomonas\ncapsulata that has been shown to successfully\ndegrade immunogenic gluten fragments in the\nstomach,6,7 and a synthetic enzyme called\nKumaMax from the Institute for Protein Design\nat University of Washington (Seattle, WA, USA)\nhad similar in vitro results to ALV003,8 but is still\nunder development. Finally, Tolerase G, a com-\nmercially available dietary supplement sold by\nDSM (Kaiseraugst, Switzerland) that contains\nAspergillus niger derived prolyl endoprotease\n(AN-PEP), has had very promising in vitro, ex\nvivo, and in vitro initial results.8,9\nIn addition to these gluten-degrading enzymes\n(glutenases), there are numerous dietary supple-\nments already on the market that are marketed to\naid in the digestion of gluten and reduce its toxic-\nity. These products are mainly based on DPP-IV,\nwhich has limited proteolytic activity on its own.\nThey are most prominently marketed to patients\nwith CD or gluten intolerance who are maintain-\ning a gluten-free diet (GFD) by choice. In this\nstudy, we investigate various aspects of 14 com-\nmercially available glutenase products. We show\nthat these products have minimal published evi-\ndence of efficacy and may actually be hazardous\nto patients with CD who are taking them.\nMethods\nIdentifying glutenase products\nWe conducted a Google search for glutenases\nusing the following terms and variations thereof:\n`glutenase', `gluten enzyme', `digest gluten', and\n`celiac enzyme'. We used online articles to sup-\nplement our search to ultimately find 14 prod-\nucts. Our criteria for glutenase products required\nthat they be commercially available, enzyme sup-\nplements, claim to degrade gluten, and available\nin the United States.\nCollecting product data\nWe examined the manufacturers' websites, prod-\nuct labels, and other published information and\nadvertising materials for the glutenase products\nto find the following data: active ingredients;\ndeclared allergen content; indications for use;\ndata supporting efficacy; claims made about the\nproduct; disclaimers; and the US Food and\nDrug Administration (FDA) classification of the\nproduct (i.e. food item, dietary supplement,\ndrug, etc.).\nGoogle search frequency\nWe used Google AdWords' Keyword Planner\ntool to obtain Google search frequency data. We\nlooked at search frequency for the glutenase prod-\nuct names as well as a few related search terms\n(`CD', `gluten free', and the search terms we used\nto find the products) for basis of comparison. For\nthese search terms, we used Google's data for the\nlatest available six months' preceding data collec-\ndata; we limited the inquiry to the United States\nfor the purpose of keeping the data local; and we\nused the data separated by month rather than the\nmonthly average presented by the Google\nAdWords tool to minimize rounding error appar-\nently inherent to Google's calculations.\nResults\nActive ingredients\nThrough our Google search, we found 14 glute-\nnase products that met our criteria (Table 1). All\nS Krishnareddy, K Stier et al.\njournals.sagepub.com/home/tag 475\nof the products were classified as dietary supple-\nments and, as such, are exempt from many FDA\nlabeling standards. We first identified the active\ningredients of each of the products from their\ncontent labels (Table 2). We found that all of the\nproducts contained proteases, while 8 of the 14\nproducts contained the X-prolyl exopeptidase\nDPP-IV, and one, Digest Gluten Plus, listed\nTable 1.

Five of the products contained lipases,\nthough no product listed more than one lipase,\nnor did any product containing lipases specify\nwhat lipase it contained, nor their sources.\nNeither carbohydrases nor lipases degrade glu-\nten proteins.\nThree of the products contained probiotics, with\nLactobacillus species occurring in two products.\nNo other bacterial family was listed as a probiotic\nin more than one product.\nThe FDA requires that dietary supplements\ndeclare any `major allergens' (including wheat)\nthat may be present in the products. One of the\nglutenase products (Digest Gluten Plus) declared\nwheat content, as well as milk. As seen in Table 3,\nthree of the products possibly contained plant\nmatter, two contained herbal products (type not\nstated) and one Carica papaya (a tropical fruit).\nIngredient origins\nAfter the active ingredients, we looked at the ori-\ngins of the active ingredients of the glutenase\nproducts (Table 3). Eight of the products used\nfungal sources; each of these eight used Aspergillus\noryzae, five used Aspergillus niger, four used\nAspergillus melleus, and two used non-Aspergillus\nspecies alongside Aspergillus species. Two prod-\nucts (Digest Gluten Plus and Gluten-Ade) used\nbacterial sources, excluding bacteria used as\nprobiotics; both of these products used Bacillus\nsubtilis. Three products used plant sources, two\nof which used the plants as herbs, while the third\nused a papaya-derived protease. Unfortunately,\nwe are not aware of where all of the ingredients\ncome from, as the manufacturers do not list all\nof the origins, as is noted in Table 3.\nClaims and disclaimers\nWe then identified the claims and disclaimers the\nmanufacturers made on the products (Table 4).\nTable 3.

Four products claimed to help allevi-\nate gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms associated\nwith eating gluten. Six products made claims\nregarding their activity in a `range of pH' found in\nthe stomach. No other claims relevant to CD\nwere made by any of the products.\nAlong with these three types of claims, the manu-\nfacturers also included many disclaimers; the\nindividual products carried as many as five dis-\nclaimers. The most prevalent disclaimer, present\non 11 of the products, was the standard `These\nstatements have not been evaluated by the FDA.\nThis product is not intended to diagnose, treat,\ncure, or prevent any disease.' Similarly, five prod-\nucts advised that pregnant and breastfeeding\npatients take extra precautions, and two products\nadvised that patients discontinue use if they react\nadversely to the product. More notably, however,\none product advised patients to discuss using the\nproduct with their physicians; one said to contact\na physician if gluten sensitivity symptoms persist\nwhile using the product; two products advised\nthat patients with CD use the products only under\na physician's supervision; and seven products\nstated that patients with CD should maintain a\nGFD even while using the product.\nSearch frequency\nUsing Google AdWords to obtain search frequency\ndata, we found that the Google search frequencies\nfor the glutenase products' names is remarkable\n(Figure 1).

People are looking for therapies for\nCD, given the 3173 searches/month aggregate\nGoogle search frequency for the search terms we\nused to find the glutenase products and the prod-\nuct names themselves, the results comparable to\nsearches for information on `CD'. The fact that\nwe found the 14 glutenase products in this study\nusing such search terms as `digest gluten' and\n`celiac enzyme', among others, demonstrates how\npatients with CD may be finding these products.\nThere has been considerable interest in the\nresearch and pharmaceutical development of\npotential therapies for CD.15 A major area of\nresearch is the development of enzyme prepara-\ntions that will digest the toxic fragments of glu-\nten in the stomach preventing exposure of these\nfragments to the intestinal mucosa.16 The devel-\nopment of specific enzymes that digest the toxic\nfragments of gluten has advanced considerably\nto phase II clinical studies.17 However, the glute-\nnases in the commercially available products\nthat we investigated have not been demonstrated\nto digest the immunogenic, toxic fragments of\ngluten in the acid milieu of the stomach.3\nThe glutenase products we investigated almost\nunanimously assure degradation of gluten to\nminimize or eliminate the effects of consuming\ngluten. Many products also claim to diminish\nvarious GI symptoms. Even the names make\nimplicit claims: Gluten Cutter, Gluten Defense,\nGlutenEase, and other similar names hold the\nclear suggestion of protection against gluten\nconsumption. All of these claims may be very\nalluring to patients with CD who feel restricted\nby the diet. There is very little evidence, how-\never, that these products actually do what they\nclaim to do. One paper finds only 64% hydroly-\nsis of gluten by a particular enzyme combination\nFigure 1. Monthly Google search volume for product names, January 2015\u00adJune 2015. Columns represent\nmean search volume. For comparison searches for CD and gluten free are included as well as the glutenase\nproduct names. Monthly search volumes obtained from Google AdWords. There were insufficient data for\nGluten Enzyme DG and Procellax DG2.\nS Krishnareddy, K Stier et al.\njournals.sagepub.com/home/tag 479\nincluding DPP-IV.18 Another study reports on\nDPP-IV degradation of the N terminus of gluten\npeptides but does not specify the speed of degra-\ndation or efficacy in gastric conditions.19 In\nanother study, it was specifically found that cur-\nrent commercially available glutenases, primar-\nily DPP-IV-based products, are not effective in\ndegrading the toxic epitopes of gluten; the five\nproducts tested by Janssen and colleagues left\nthe immunogenic amino acid sequences in glu-\nten completely intact.3 Indeed, it is entirely pos-\nsible that any relief patients may experience from\nthe glutenase products we investigated can be\nattributed to the placebo effect or the carbohy-\ndrases and lipases paired with an underlying,\nundiagnosed digestive condition. Thus, the effi-\ncacy claims made by the glutenase product man-\nufacturers are misleading and may cause patients\nto cause themselves harm by eating gluten while\nbelieving they are protected.\nBeyond the apparent lack of efficacy of the glute-\nnases, the products in and of themselves may\nactually pose a hazard to patients. One of the\nproducts declared wheat content in the allergen\ninformation. This wheat content poses a clear\nhazard to patients with CD using the product,\nand it is possible that other products contain\nundeclared wheat (or other allergens), as the\nFDA does not closely monitor these enzyme sup-\nplements and their labels. Recent publicity in the\nlay press20 has highlighted the high rate of misla-\nbeling of dietary supplements, lack of the product\non the label detected in the product, and high\nrates of product substitution with nondisclosed\nitems such as wheat, rice, and noxious herbs.21\nPrevious work done by our group has found that\n55% of probiotics contain gluten, despite being\nlabeled gluten free, and 18% contain more than\nthe 20 ppm limit for gluten-free foods set by the\nFDA,22 creating a potential hazard to patients\nwith CD. Furthermore, the probiotic content and\nbacterial and fungal origins of the glutenase prod-\nucts we investigated are worrisome. The use of\nthese microorganisms may unintentionally permit\npathogenic contamination of the products, in\naddition to inadvertent gluten exposure.23\nThe array of disclaimers on the products in this\nstudy may be another issue. Eleven of the prod-\nucts actually say that they are `not intended to\ndiagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease', as\npart of the standard FDA-mandated disclaimer,\nwhich included CD. These products should be\nclearly labeled with disclaimers about use and\nrisks of use in CD. Furthermore, seven of the\nproducts explicitly state that they are not intended\nto replace GFD in patients with CD, along with\nother disclaimers which should indicate to these\npatients that the drugs are not effective in treating\nCD. Two products even advise patients with CD\nnot to use the product without physician supervi-\nsion. Unfortunately, Kesselheim and colleagues24\nfound that such disclaimers, which should really\nserve as warnings, do not consistently communi-\ncate the issues they are trying to express. Instead,\nthese disclaimers are either misunderstood or\nsimply ignored, causing patients to unwittingly\nput themselves at risk. Furthermore, all the prod-\nucts do not contain these disclaimers and should\nbe made to in order to clearly identify the risk to\npatients using these products.\nThe FDA is responsible for ensuring the safety\nand efficacy of drugs, medical devices, biological\nproducts, cosmetics, food, and radiation-emitting\nproducts in the USA, but the FDA has little\nauthority over dietary supplements and is specifi-\ncally prevented from closely regulating the indus-\ntry.25 Product labels and claims are not subject to\nthe same approval requirements as drug labels\nand dietary supplements are not subject to the\nsame rigorous testing standards. Consequently,\ndietary supplement manufacturers have a sub-\nstantial amount of latitude in what they can say\nand do. For example, dietary supplement labels\nmay not be as clear as they should be, such as\nwith the ambiguity in ingredient listings noted in\nTable 2. Because of the FDA's limited authority\nover dietary supplements, they are not as well\nregulated as drugs in terms of safety, consistency,\nefficacy, or labeling, and may be at higher risk of\nmisinformation or even hazardous contents,\nincluding gluten. Although the addition of gluten\nto these products is a clear contraindication for\npatients with CD, patients with nonceliac gluten\nsensitivity might also be sensitive to the amounts\nof gluten in these products and should be aware\nof these issues.\nTolerase G, the AN-PEP-based supplement, was\nnot evaluated in this study because it was not\nfound via the search methods used. This is likely\na result of the time at which the searches were\nconducted, the search terms used, and the Google\nsearch algorithm. Tolerase G became commer-\ncially available in June, approximately 1 month\nprior to when the searches were conducted, which\nTherapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 10(6)\n480 journals.sagepub.com/home/tag\nmay have contributed to the apparent low visibil-\nity through the Google searches. While Tolerase\nG effectively reduced the amount of consumed\ngluten that was exposed to the duodenum in a\nclinical study, it did not completely degrade the\ngluten.9 Therefore, it is not an effective treatment\nfor CD, as no safe concentration of gluten in the\nduodenum has been determined, and the same\nstudy even states, `AN-PEP is not intended to\ntreat or prevent coeliac disease'.9 Tolerase G,\nbeing a dietary supplement, is also not FDA regu-\nlated and therefore has the same regulation con-\ncerns as the supplements evaluated in this study.\nWith the potential hazards and lack of evidence of\nefficacy of the glutenase products we investigated,\nit appears entirely inadvisable for patients with\nCD to use the products. Rather, it remains that\nthe only valid treatment option presently availa-\nble for CD is lifelong adherence to the GFD.\nThere are, however, some promising therapies\ncurrently being developed in the United States\nand Europe that will be required to demonstrate\nefficacy and safety in clinical trials. It is most\nadvisable that patients with CD maintain GFD\nwhile awaiting the approval and production of\nsafe, properly regulated therapies. We need to ask\nall our patients on GFDs with CD or nonceliac\ngluten sensitivity about their use of dietary sup-\nplements and protect them from this very poorly\nregulated industry and specifically the misleading\nlabeling of these glutenase products, especially as\npatients increasingly use the internet to seek med-\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nConflict of interest statement\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nReferences\n1.
