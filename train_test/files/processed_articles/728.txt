    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The continued rise in the uninsured population has led to consider-\nable interest in tax-based policies to raise the level of insurance coverage. Using\na detailed microsimulation model for evaluating these policies, we find that\nwhile tax subsidies could significantly increase insurance coverage, even very\ngenerous tax policies could not cover more than a sizable minority of the\nuninsured population. For example, a generous refundable credit that costs\n$13 billion per year would reduce the ranks of the uninsured by only four million\npersons. We also find that the efficiency of tax policies, in terms of the cost per\nnewly insured, inevitably would fall as more of the uninsured were covered.\nDespite an economic boom that has had only one inter-\nruption in fifteen years and low levels of health care cost\nincreases, uninsurance rates in the United States continue to\nrise. This has motivated considerable policy discussion at both the\nfederal and state levels. At the federal level, it was one of the factors\nthat led the Clinton administration to promote comprehensive\nhealth system reform. The policy focus has now shifted to incre-\nmental reforms, particularly to the idea of using the tax system to\nsubsidize individuals' purchase of insurance. This would provide\nfinancial benefits to individual coverage holders that are now en-\njoyed only by the self-employed or those with employer-sponsored\ncoverage. Also, tax subsidies for buying insurance would rely on the\nprivate insurance system rather than on a government-sponsored\nprogram that might carry stigma for some people. Finally, it can be\nseen as providing a tax cut rather than creating a more politically\ncontroversial new spending program.\nYet while the tax-equity argument is compelling--especially\ngiven the estimated $100 billion in yearly federal tax subsidies for\nthe purchase of employer-sponsored health coverage--tax subsi-\ndies' ability to meaningfully reduce the number of uninsured per-\nsons remains uncertain and unproven. Moreover, the spectrum of\ntax-based approaches that has been proposed is quite broad, rang-\ning from deductibility of insurance costs for individuals to refund-\nable tax credits that might cover most or all of the cost of a typical\nhealth insurance policy.\nIn this paper we assess the potential implications of a range of\ntax-based approaches using a new microsimulation model devel-\noped specifically for this purpose. We examine how various charac-\nteristics of these proposals are likely to affect the overall cost to the\nfederal government, the number of uninsured persons who would\ngain coverage, which income groups would benefit from the subsi-\ndies, and how those who now have employer-sponsored coverage\nwould be affected.\nn Background. Health insurance is now subsidized through the\ntax code in four ways.

Second, those who spend more than 7.5 percent of their\nincomes on health care and health insurance can deduct the excess\nexpenditures on their income tax returns. Third, workers in firms\nwith a group health insurance plan that qualifies under Section 125\nof the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) code can make before-tax\npremium contributions. Finally, the self-employed can deduct from\ntheir income tax a portion of their insurance expenditures, currently\nPersons who are not self-employed but who are not offered health\ninsurance by their employers remain outside the current scheme of\ntax subsidies. In addition, much of the spending on insurance, even\nby those whose employer spending is tax-subsidized, is through\nnonsubsidized employee contributions. Using the model described\nbelow we calculate that roughly 16 percent of the nonelderly popu-\nlation is not eligible for a tax subsidy for health insurance at some\npoint in time.\nn Methodology. In this paper we model a variety of approaches\nto expand tax subsidies, to consider their impact on health insur-\nance coverage and costs. We use a detailed microsimulation model,\nbased on the February/March 1997 Current Population Survey\n(CPS) and augmented with data from a variety of sources on health\ninsurance costs in the group and nongroup markets. The central\nfeature of this model is consideration of a wide variety of behavioral\nresponses to tax subsidies, such as the extent to which (1) the\nuninsured would purchase insurance if it were subsidized; (2) those\nnow holding nongroup insurance would take up the subsidy; (3)\nfirms would drop group coverage or reduce their premium contribu-\ntions if nongroup coverage were subsidized; (4) those who hold\ngroup insurance would switch to nongroup insurance if it were\nsubsidized; and (5) those whose employers raise contributions\nwould drop their group insurance and become uninsured.1 For this\nanalysis we consider the following types of policies.\nRefundable tax credit for nongroup insurance. We first consider the\navailability of a tax credit for the purchase of insurance that covers\n\"base\" policy). This credit covers about 43 percent of the premiums\nof a typical nongroup policy for an uninsured individual and about\n31 percent of the premiums for a typical uninsured family. This\ncredit is refundable; that is, if the amount of the credit claimed\nexceeds the individual's tax liability, he or she can receive a refund\nfor the difference. This is particularly important because 45 percent\nof the uninsured do not pay any taxes against which a subsidy could\nbe applied. We assume that the availability of this credit is income-\nSUBSIDIES\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ V o l u m e 1 9 , N u m b e r 1\nI n s u r a n c e C o v e r a g e\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

It is available only for non-employer-\nsponsored insurance, so that it cannot be used toward the purchase\nof employer health insurance premiums, but it is available to all\npersons, even those whose employers offer health insurance.\nNonrefundablecredit for nongroup insurance. This policy is identical to\nthe base policy except that the credit is not refundable, so individu-\nals can only claim it up to the level of their existing tax liabilities.\nDeduction for nongroup insuranceexpenditures. We next consider using\ninstead of a tax credit an unlimited deduction for the costs of non-\ngroup insurance. This parallels the tax treatment of employer-spon-\nsored insurance, except that the costs of that insurance also are\nshielded from payroll taxation.\nRefundable credit for nongroup insurance restricted to those not offered\ninsurance. This policy is identical to the base policy but is restricted\nto those who are not offered nongroup insurance. This approach\nimposes significant administrative and enforcement difficulties but\nhas the potential to target the tax subsidies more precisely to per-\nsons who otherwise would be uninsured.\nRefundable credit for any insurance expenditure. Finally, we consider a\npolicy that is identical to the base policy but applies to any individ-\nual insurance expenditure, not just to nongroup policy purchases.\nThus, persons can use this credit against the cost of their share of\nemployer-sponsored insurance premiums.\nCosts And Coverage Under The Base Policy\nn Aggregate impacts. Using our microsimulation model we show\nthe impacts of the base policy on the total cost of the policy; the\ntake-up of the subsidy by various groups, categorized by their pre-\nsubsidy insurance status; and the net change in the size of these\ngroups from before to after the subsidy (Exhibit 1). We explore in\nparticular, for the employer-insured, the avenues that lead to the net\nchange in this group.\nThe total cost of using the base policy would be $13.3 billion per\nsubsidy (8.2 percent of the total nonelderly population). Of those\ntaking it up, 4.7 million would be previously uninsured, 8.6 million\nwould be previously covered by nongroup insurance, 4.7 million\nwould be previously covered by employer-sponsored insurance, and\n0.4 million would be previously covered by Medicaid. On net, the\nnumber of uninsured persons would fall by slightly more than four\nmillion, the number of persons with nongroup insurance would rise\nCOVERAGE\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ J a n u a r y / F e b r u a r y 2 0 0 0\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

This latter change would be\nmade up of 1.1 million persons whose firms stopped offering group\ninsurance and who moved to the nongroup market; 0.1 million per-\nsons whose firms stopped offering insurance and who became unin-\nsured; 3.6 million persons who switched from group to nongroup\ninsurance; and 0.6 million persons who became uninsured because\ntheir firms raised the employee share of insurance premiums and\nwho decided to drop coverage.\nWhile the base policy would lower the number of uninsured\npersons, it also would induce a shift from employer to nongroup\ncoverage. Moreover, almost half of those taking up the subsidy would\nbe persons who were already purchasing nongroup insurance. As a\nresult, the net cost of the policy per newly insured person would be\nalmost $3,300, which is substantial when compared with average\nemployer-based insurance costs of $1,860 per person in our sample\nand nongroup insurance costs of $2,100. That is, because of imper-\nfect targeting, the government would pay about 50 percent more\nthan the cost of the typical nongroup policy per newly insured person.\nIt is interesting to note that most of the cost of imperfect target-\ning of this subsidy would arise through take-up by those with non-\ngroup insurance, not through dropping group coverage or switching\nto nongroup insurance by those with job-based insurance.

For example, for\nthose workers whose firms dropped their health insurance cover-\nage, we assume that their wages would rise because their employer\nwould no longer be paying for health insurance and could therefore\nafford higher wages. These higher wages would then be taxed, rais-\ning new revenues and offsetting the cost of their take-up of the new\ninsurance subsidy. For those who switched from group to nongroup\ninsurance, we assume that the cost savings to the employer would\nbe passed back to workers in the form of higher wages (although not\nspecifically to the switching employees), once again raising reve-\nnues. Revenues also would rise because employers would react to\nthis base policy to some extent by lowering their pretax contributions\nfor health insurance and again raise wages to compensate for this.\nn Distributional impacts. Given the strong correlation between\ninsurance status and income, it is important to consider not just the\naggregate impacts of the base-policy subsidy, but its distributional\nimplications as well. Exhibit 2 shows the distributional effects of\nthe policy for different segments of the population relative to the\nfederal poverty level ($17,274 for a family of four). For each group we\nshow the net cost and the percentage of costs attributable to the\ngroup; the subsidy take-up in absolute and percentage (relative to\ngroup size before the policy impact) terms; the change in the unin-\nsured in absolute and percentage terms; and the cost per newly\ninsured person (that is, total dollars spent on that group relative to\nthe reduction in the uninsured).\nFirst, we find that the lowest income group, which contains 45\npercent of the uninsured, would receive about 26 percent of the net\nspending on this policy. Only about 1.3 million of the uninsured in\nthis group would gain coverage, which is about one-third of the\ntotal number of uninsured who would gain coverage across all in-\nDistributional Analysis Of Model Tax-Subsidy Policy\nSOURCE: Authors' calculations.\nNOTE: FPL is federal poverty level ($17,274 for a family of four).\nCOVERAGE\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ J a n u a r y / F e b r u a r y 2 0 0 0\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Overall, this policy is more efficient for this subgroup\nthan for the full population, with a cost of $2,739 per newly insured\nperson. This is primarily because there would be few persons with\nnongroup insurance taking up the policy in this income range, rela-\ntive to the number of uninsured persons taking it up.\ncent of poverty, a group that contains another 30 percent of the\nuninsured, would receive about 30 percent of the net spending from\nthis policy, and about 1.6 million fewer persons in this group would\nbe uninsured.\npoverty would receive almost 20 percent of the net spending from\nthe policy, but the number of uninsured persons would fall by only\n0.7 million. As a result, spending would be less efficient for this\ngroup, with a cost per newly insured person of more than $3,500.\nFinally, persons with incomes above 300 percent of poverty would\nreceive 24 percent of the net spending of this policy, but the number\nof uninsured persons would change only slightly, mostly because so\nfew persons in this income group are uninsured. As a result, spend-\ning would be much less efficient at these higher income levels.\nThus, a majority of spending (56 percent) under this policy would\nbe targeted to those with incomes below 200 percent of the poverty\nlevel, and three-quarters would be targeted to those with incomes\nbelow 300 percent of poverty. But the spending for those above 300\npercent of poverty would be very inefficient: A total of $3.3 billion\nwould be spent on this group to reduce the number of uninsured\nCosts And Coverage Under Alternative Policies\nThe base policy mimicks a number of proposed tax subsidies; how-\never, a host of alternative structures have been proposed. We cannot\ndo justice in this limited space to the full variety of alternatives\navailable to policymakers, so we consider several alternative ap-\nproaches to provide a flavor of how the effects of tax policy change\nas the structure of a program is altered.\nn Making the credit nonrefundable. One option that would\ngreatly lower costs and simplify administration is to make the sub-\nsidy nonrefundable. However, this would severely limit the benefits\nof this subsidy for the uninsured, more than 60 percent of whom\nhave tax liabilities of less than $1,000 (and therefore can only par-\ntially benefit from a nonrefundable credit).\nthe costs of the subsidy, which would fall to almost half the cost of\nthe refundable base-policy credit (Exhibit 3).

As a result, the cost per newly insured per-\nson ($3,827) would be even higher than with the refundable credit\n($3,296), largely because such a high share of the dollars would be\ngoing to the previously nongroup- or employer-insured. Moreover,\nthe distributional consequences of this approach are much less at-\ntractive. Only 23 percent of the spending through this policy would\ngo to those with incomes below 20 percent of the poverty line.\nThere are a number of political and administrative arguments\nagainst refundability, most significantly the question of whether net\ntax refunds to low-income families are hidden forms of \"welfare\"\npayments. But the results here speak clearly: Refundability is criti-\ncal for appropriate targeting of tax incentives to low-income per-\nsons who are uninsured.\nn Using a deduction. Another alternative that could limit costs\nfurther is to use a tax deduction rather than a credit, but this ap-\nproach has problems similar to those of nonrefundability in reaching\nthe uninsured. Moreover, of the half of the uninsured who do pay\ntaxes, 90 percent are in the 15 percent tax bracket, so a subsidy in\nthe form of a deduction would be worth relatively little to them.\nIn our microsimulation model we assume that an unlimited de-\nduction of nongroup health insurance costs is an \"above-the-line\"\ndeduction that would be available to all taxpayers, not just to those\nwho itemize their deductions. The costs of this policy (only $870\nmillion per year) would be dramatically lower than those of the\nalternatives. But its impact on insurance coverage would be much\nmore modest, with only 250,000 uninsured persons gaining cover-\nAlternative Policies For Tax Subsidization Of Health Insurance\n<\nBase policy\nNonrefundable credit\nDeduction\nLimited to those not\noffered insurance\nCredit for all insurance\nNo liquidity constraints\nno liquidity constraints\nSOURCE: Authors' calculations.\nNOTE: FPL is federal poverty level ($17,274 for a family of four).\nCOVERAGE\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ J a n u a r y / F e b r u a r y 2 0 0 0\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

This is because there would be only a modest overall take-up of\nthis subsidy by the uninsured to begin with (600,000 persons), and\nmuch of this would then be offset by firms' dropping group coverage\nand reduced coverage because of firm contribution reductions. Esti-\nmating with precision the change in the number of uninsured per-\nsons in the range around zero is difficult, but it is clear that the\neffects of a deduction on both costs and coverage would likely be\nminimal. At the same time, this policy would have much worse\ndistributional characteristics: Less than 30 percent of the benefits\nwould accrue to persons with incomes below 200 percent of the\npoverty line.\nNote that the cost that would arise from this policy would not be\nthe result of take-up by the previously employer-insured. The gov-\nernment would actually make money on this population, because\nthe government revenue from higher wages as a result of firms'\ndropping coverage and reducing contributions would outweigh the\ngovernment's cost of subsidy take-up. Rather, the inefficiency\nwould arise primarily from the fact that three-quarters of those who\nwould take up this subsidy would already have nongroup insurance.\nn Limiting the credit to those not offered coverage. One way\nto better target the subsidy may be to limit the refundable\nsponsored insurance. There are of course difficult administrative\nissues associated with implementing and enforcing such a policy.2\nBut the advantage is that being offered insurance by one's employer\nis closely related to being covered by insurance, so this policy pro-\nvides a device for better targeting subsidy dollars to the currently\nuninsured.\nThe total cost of this option is much lower than that of the base\npolicy, only $6.2 billion per year, although the number of newly\ninsured persons would fall as well (to 2.1 million) (Exhibit 3). The\nefficiency of this alternative would be somewhat better than in the\nbase case, at $2,930 per newly insured person. This increase in effi-\nciency arises from the lower take-up of this policy by persons with\nnongroup insurance, since many of them are offered employer-based\ninsurance. On the other hand, firms' dropping group coverage would\ncause a much larger increase in the uninsured pool. We estimate\nthat firms would drop 3.2 million persons from their insurance rolls,\nThis policy is somewhat more distributionally attractive than the\nbase policy, with more than two-thirds of the benefits accruing to\npersons with incomes below 200 percent of poverty. These modest\ndistributional gains, however, must be balanced against the costs\nand difficulty of enforcing this administratively awkward restric-\nSUBSIDIES\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ V o l u m e 1 9 , N u m b e r 1\nI n s u r a n c e C o v e r a g e\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

On the one hand, this would greatly increase costs, as more than\n70 percent of the employer-insured pay some or all of their premi-\nums, and all of these costs would now be paid by the government.\nOn the other hand, the CPS reports that almost 40 percent of the\nuninsured are offered group health insurance, and a large subsidy\nwould essentially make insurance free for this population, with dra-\nmatic impacts. Moreover, there would be neither firms dropping\ngroup insurance nor employees switching to nongroup insurance\nunder a policy such as this.\nThe cost of this policy would indeed be substantial: $62.2 billion\nper year (Exhibit 3). On the other hand, the impact on the uninsured\nwould be equally dramatic, with more than 12.4 million uninsured\ngaining coverage. Overall, however, this is the least efficient of the\npolicies considered, with a cost of more than $5,000 per newly\ninsured person.\nExpanding the subsidy would have a very broad reach, with more\nthan 127 million persons taking it up. This group would of course be\npredominantly made up of the employer-insured, who would take\nup the subsidy to cover their share of premiums. Indeed, a major\ndifference between this and the policy options mentioned earlier is\nthat the number of employer-insured persons would be rising, not\nfalling, which may be of intrinsic value to some policymakers.\nThis policy alternative is less distributionally attractive than a\nrefundable credit would be, but it spends a higher share of its dollars\nat the bottom of the income distribution than does the nonrefund-\nable credit or deduction. (Only 36.5 percent of the spending is on\nthose below 200 percent of poverty.) It is worth noting, however,\nthat the inefficiency of this policy comes more from its scale than\nfrom its structure. As we show in the next section, the cost per\nnewly insured person from this approach would not be appreciably\nhigher than the cost from the base policy, which would provide\nhigher levels of coverage to the uninsured.\nn Changing the scale of the subsidy. While we have chosen a\npolicy, one could consider less or more generous alternatives as well.\nThus, we now consider first halving, then doubling, the generosity\nof this policy. We find that smaller credits cover fewer people but do\nso in a more targeted way. For example, with a credit of $500 for\nsingles and $1,000 for families, we estimate that costs would be only\nCOVERAGE\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ J a n u a r y / F e b r u a r y 2 0 0 0\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

As a result, spending per newly\ninsured person would be only $2,239, well below even average group\ncosts per person. On the other hand, with a credit of $2,000 for\nsingles and $4,000 for families, which would approximate the full\ncost of insurance for these populations, we estimate that costs\nwould rise almost threefold, but the number of newly insured per-\nsons would almost double, so that spending per newly insured\nwould rise to $4,915 per person. At the same time, the small credit\nwould cover only 2.1 million newly insured persons, whereas the\nlarger credit would cover more than 7.7 million.\nThe smaller subsidy also would target its spending more directly\nto the poor, with more than 60 percent of the dollars flowing to\nthose with incomes below 200 percent of poverty. On the other\ndollars on those with incomes below 200 percent of poverty. This\nworsening of the distributional impacts as generosity rises reflects\nthe dramatic increase in take-up by both the (relatively high in-\ncome) nongroup-insured and the employer-insured.\nThus, there is a clear trade-off as the generosity of the tax credit is\nchanged. Modest credits cannot deliver a very large change in the\nuninsured population, but the newly insured persons who are cov-\nered tend to be those with the lowest incomes. Very large tax credits\ncan induce substantial changes in the uninsured population, but\nonly at a very steep cost per newly insured person.\nn Easing liquidity constraints. A key issue in implementing tax\ncredits is the mismatch between the flow of tax subsidies and the\nflow of insurance premium payments. Low-income households that\nwould like to take advantage of tax credits during a given year, but\nthat only receive their credit the next spring, may face liquidity\nproblems. If the government can find a solution to this timing mis-\nmatch, it could increase the propensity of the uninsured to take up\ntax subsidies. A variety of analysts have proposed solutions to this\nproblem, such as paying tax credits directly to insurers.3 But our\ntrack record with the earned income tax credit (EITC) suggests\ncaution in assuming that this problem can easily be overcome: Al-\nthough persons can claim their EITC throughout the year, and pre-\nsumably for many it would be of some value to do so, more than 99\npercent of claimants receive the credit as a lump sum the next spring.4\n\"Large tax credits can induce substantial changes in the uninsured\npopulation, but only at a very steep cost per newly insured person.\"\nSUBSIDIES\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ V o l u m e 1 9 , N u m b e r 1\nI n s u r a n c e C o v e r a g e\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

As shown in Exhibit 3, easing\nliquidity constraints would increase by $1.4 billion the cost of the\nbase policy (absent any additional interest or other costs to the\ngovernment of easing these constraints) and would insure an addi-\ntional 1.4 million persons, for a total of 5.5 million newly insured\npersons. This implies a substantial increase in the efficiency of the\npolicy, with a cost of only $2,683 per newly insured person.

Although the effects of\nany major change in health care financing cannot be estimated with\nperfect precision, simulation analyses using common assumptions\nare particularly useful for comparing the effects of alternative pro-\nposals. Our approach in analyzing alternative tax-based mecha-\nnisms for covering the uninsured in this way is similar to a recent\nseries of analyses carried out by a Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation\nproject to study incremental health reform.5\nn Summary of findings. Several clear conclusions follow from\nour analysis. First, it is difficult to design a tax policy that insures a\nlarge number of new persons at a modest cost per person. The base\npolicy considered here is more generous than are many of the pro-\nposals being considered by federal policymakers, and yet it still\nwould subsidize less than half of the estimated cost of typical non-\ngroup insurance. Although it would decrease the number of unin-\nsured persons by an estimated four million (less than 10 percent of\nthe uninsured population), the average cost per newly insured per-\nson would be $3,300. Raising the value of the credit would insure\nmore people but also would raise the cost per newly insured person.\nSecond, there are clearly more and less efficient ways to cover a\ngiven number of uninsured persons. We find in particular that non-\nrefundable credits would be much more expensive per uninsured\nperson covered and would cover fewer of the uninsured. We also\nfind that policies that can match the timing of tax subsidies with the\ntiming of insurance payments could improve both the scope and the\nCOVERAGE\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ J a n u a r y / F e b r u a r y 2 0 0 0\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

In\ncontrast, a policy that allowed people to deduct nongroup insurance\npremiums would provide less than 30 percent of its benefits to\npeople in that income group, and a credit that was not refundable\nwould target an even smaller portion of aid to them.\nFinally, tax-based subsidies--particularly those whose subsidies\nare most generous--would likely lead to reductions in the number\nof persons with employer-based coverage. For example, we estimate\nthat the base-case policy would reduce the number of persons with\nemployer coverage by 5.4 million. Most of these (3.6 million) would\nswitch from employer to nongroup insurance because they would\nfind the new tax subsidies more attractive than their current situ-\nations. However, the remainder would either be dropped from their\nfirms' insurance rolls or become uninsured because their employers\nincreased the amount that employees must pay for insurance. Poli-\ncies that mitigate firms' dropping coverage or employees' switching\nto nongroup insurance tend to cost more in total and also per newly\ncovered person.\nn Potential impact of insurance market reforms. If there are\npooling advantages to having individuals obtain their insurance\nthrough the workplace, then this is a potential concern with policies\ntargeted only to nongroup coverage. Our analysis, in fact, assumes\nthat policies in the individual market are universally available (at\nhealth risk\u00adadjusted prices). While such \"guaranteed issue\" in the\nindividual market is required in some states, most states allow in-\nsurers to exclude people who are in poor health, which could reduce\ntake-up rates. State or federal regulators could accompany tax sub-\nsidies with individual market regulations to limit such practices,\nbut these regulations are controversial. Also, the net impact of insur-\nance market reforms in the context of tax subsidies is uncertain,\nbecause it would raise costs for the most healthy persons and lower\nthem for the least healthy.\nOn the other hand, doubling the size of the nongroup insurance\nmarket (as we estimate would occur in the base policy) could\n\"Most states allow insurers to exclude people who are in poor\nhealth, which could reduce take-up rates.\"\nSUBSIDIES\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ V o l u m e 1 9 , N u m b e r 1\nI n s u r a n c e C o v e r a g e\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Also, non-\ngroup insurance plans might design policies targeted specifically to\nthe available level of the credit, further increasing take-up from\nwhat is modeled here (although take-up might be for plans with less\ngenerous benefits than are typical today).

Dick Armey (R-TX) on the right to Rep.\nPete Stark (D-CA) on the left--for using federal tax credits as\na sensible way to expand health insurance coverage. Tax\ncredits would support the voluntary purchase of private\ninsurance. However, a key question is how much broadened\ncoverage the federal government could anticipate through this\napproach. In this paper Jonathan Gruber and Larry Levitt,\nusing a new microsimulation model developed specifically for\nthis purpose, assert that the ability of tax subsidies to greatly\nreduce the number of uninsured persons remains uncertain and\nunproven. But they also write that if Congress decides to\npursue the expansion of coverage through changes in tax\npolicy, some approaches are distinctly better than others are\nfrom the standpoint of sound public policy.\nGruber is a professor of economics at the Massachusetts\nInstitute of Technology and also directs the Program on\nChildren at the National Bureau of Economic Research. During\nsecretary for economic policy at the Treasury Department.\nGruber earned his doctorate in economics at Harvard\nUniversity. His particular research interests include the\neconomics of employer-provided health insurance, the\nefficiency of current systems that deliver health care to the\nindigent, and the economics of smoking.
