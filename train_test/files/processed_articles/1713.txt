The Joint Food\nand Agricultural Organization of the United\nNations/WHO Expert Committee on Food\nAdditives (JECFA) recently concluded that\nsubstantial uncertainty remains regarding the\nlong-term significance of the effects of cad-\nresults from epidemiologic studies that inves-\ntigated the association between low-level\nenvironmental exposure to Cd and its direct\neffects on bone.\nCadmium is a toxic metal that is released\ninto the environment from industrial activity,\nincluding mining and smelting, fuel combus-\ntion (e.g., coal-fired power plants), disposal of\nmetal-containing products, and application of\nmunicipal sludge or phosphate fertilizer\n[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease\nRegistry (ATSDR) 1999]. Human exposure to\nCd is primarily through food [International\nProgramme on Chemical Safety (IPCS) 1992],\nwith low levels of Cd found in all foods\ntwice the Cd intake compared with non-\nsmokers because cigarette smoke contains Cd\ntaken up by the tobacco plant (ATSDR 1999).\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration's\nTotal Diet Study update reported a 26%\nincrease in dietary Cd exposure from 1990\nson/day; the latter exposure constitutes 21% of\nthe provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI)\nCadmium accumulates in the human\nbody, particularly the kidney, where it can\nremain for many years.

Gallagher,1 John S. Kovach,2 and Jaymie R. Meliker1\n1Graduate Program in Public Health, and 2Department of Preventive Medicine, Stony Brook University Medical Center, Stony Brook,\nNew York, USA\nBACKGROUND: Urinary cadmium (U-Cd) has been associated with decreased peripheral bone\nmineral density (BMD) and osteoporosis. This association, however, has not been confirmed\nusing femoral BMD, the international standard for diagnosing osteoporosis, at levels < 1.0 \u00b5g\nCd/g creatinine.\nOBJECTIVES: Our goal was to investigate the statistical association between U-Cd, at levels  1 \u00b5g/g\ncreatinine, and osteoporosis, as indicated by hip BMD and self-report in a population-based sample\nof U.S. women  50 years of age.\nMETHODS: We drew data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys for\noffs based on the international standard and self-report of physician diagnosis. We analyzed U-Cd\nlevels for association with osteoporosis using multiple logistic regression.\nRESULTS: Women  50 years of age with U-Cd levels between 0.50 and 1.00 \u00b5g/g creatinine were\nat 43% greater risk for hip-BMD\u00addefined osteoporosis, relative to those with levels  0.50 \u00b5g/g\nmates using self-report of physician-diagnosed osteoporosis. Smokers did not show a statistically\nincreased risk.\nCONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that U.S. women are at risk for osteoporosis at U-Cd levels below\nthe U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's 3-\u00b5g/g safety standard. Given null find-\nings among smokers, dietary Cd, rather than tobacco, is the likely source of Cd-related osteoporosis\nrisk for the U.S. female population  50 years of age.\nKEY WORDS: bone mineral density, cadmium, femur, hip, osteoporosis, women. Environ Health\nlevels of U-Cd might be associated with\ngreater odds for osteoporosis, and that Cd lev-\nmight suggest a significant exposure\u00adeffect\nrelationship relative to the reference group\nwith the lowest Cd levels.\nMaterials and Methods\nWe obtained the study sample data sets\nfrom the Third U.S. National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III)\nprimary analysis of hip BMD, and NHANES\nfor the secondary analysis of survey-respon-\ndent\u00adreported physician diagnosis of osteo-\nporosis. NHANES is a cross-sectional, random\nhousehold survey of the civilian population\nbased on a complex probability sampling\ndata sets included two phases of data each\nobtained by bone densitometry, conducted at\nthe Medical Examination Center and per-\nof age. We limited our analysis to women\n 50 years of age because female sex and age of\n 50 years are recognized risk factors for osteo-\nporosis (Dontas and Yiannakpoulos 2007).\nBMD measurements were performed on 3,379\nwomen  50 years of age, with 2% rejected\nand 3,311 with acceptable BMD data (Looker\net al. 1997).

For\nthe secondary analysis, osteoporosis status was\nindicated by survey participant reporting dur-\ning the NHANES interview. The interview\nquestion read, \"Has a doctor ever told you\nthat you had osteoporosis, sometimes called\nthin or brittle bones?\"\nFor both primary and secondary analyses,\nurinary Cd was obtained from a single urine\nspecimen collected and measured by the CDC\nlaboratory using atomic absorption spectrome-\ntry and reported in nanograms per milliliter.\nUrinary creatinine was obtained from the same\nurine specimen and measured in milligrams\nper deciliter. Quality control procedures call\nfor urine specimens to be processed, stored,\nand shipped to the CDC laboratory for analy-\nsis per NCHS quality control protocol (CDC\nmeasure (micrograms per gram) was generated\nby dividing U-Cd (nanograms per milliliter) by\nurinary creatinine (milligrams per deciliter).\nAnalyses were limited to women with CDC\nlaboratory-measured Cd and creatinine, with\nU-Cd levels  20 ng/mL. In an NHANES II\nstudy, Whittemore et al. (1991) used this same\n20-ng/mL exclusion, citing the determination\nis considered an upper bound for plausible val-\nues in environmental exposures. As a result, no\nobservations were excluded in our primary\nanalysis, and only one observation, with an\nextreme creatinine-adjusted Cd level of\nanalysis. To facilitate comparisons with the\nOSCAR study, which used U-Cd levels of\n1 nmol/mmol creatinine = 1 \u00b5g/g creatinine\n(Jarup et al. 2000), we used a reference U-Cd\nlevel of  0.50 \u00b5g/g creatinine. However, to\ninvestigate relative effects at lower levels of Cd\n(i.e., < 1.0 \u00b5g/g creatinine), we used the follow-\nIn our primary analysis, 664 women\ndid not; in our secondary analysis, 200 women\nin this age group had osteoporosis and 851 did\nnot. We conducted logistic regression to cal-\nculate the urinary creatinine-adjusted Cd odds\nratio (OR) for osteoporosis, both unadjusted\nand adjusted for age, race (white compared\nwith nonwhite), family income category (low-\nest to highest), underweight (< 127 lb or\n57.61 kg), and smoking status. According to\nthe National Osteoporosis Foundation's\nPhysician's Guide to Prevention and Treatment\nof Osteoporosis (National Osteoporosis\nFoundation 2003), low body weight (e.g.,\n~ 127 lb) is a major risk factor for osteoporosis\nand related fracture in Caucasian post-\nmenopausal women. We delineated smoking\nstatus into ever-smokers, who reported having\nsmoked at least 100 cigarettes and other\ntobacco in their lifetime and/or current smok-\ning every day or some days, versus never-\nsmokers, who responded negatively to both\nformer and current smoking.\nWe also adjusted for reported renal impair-\nment in the secondary analysis in an effort to\nproxy Cd-induced renal tubular damage that\nmay indirectly result in low BMD and osteo-\nporosis through secondary effects on bone\ngate measure was available in the NHANES\nimpaired renal function as a \"yes\" response to\nthe NHANES survey question, \"Have you ever\nbeen told by a doctor or other health profes-\nsional that you had weak or failing kidneys?\nDo not include kidney stones, bladder infec-\ntions, or incontinence.\" The same question was\nnot asked in the NHANES III study, nor were\nbiomarkers of Cd-induced renal tubular dam-\nage available, for example, urinary retinol-\nbinding protein (Jarup et al. 2000; Schutte\n-microglobulin (Chen et al.\n2006). Consequently, the primary analysis did\nnot adjust for renal impairment.\nWe also investigated the relationship\nbetween U-Cd and BMD from NHANES III\nusing multiple linear regression. We conducted\nthis analysis to compare results using continu-\nous BMD measures with those relying on\nBMD cutoffs of osteoporosis (Looker et al.\n1997), as are used in multiple logistic regres-\nsion analyses.\nWe conducted statistical analysis for calcu-\nlation of ORs using SAS, version 9.1 (SAS\nInstitute Inc., Cary, NC). We used SAS-\ncallable Sudaan to calculate 95% confidence\nintervals (95% CIs) and p-values (of\nSatterwaithe adjusted F-test statistics) for all\nstatistical analyses, as well as -coefficients and\nmultiple R2 values for linear regression, per\nanalytic guidelines for complex survey analysis\nof one or more variables from the medical\nexamination component (MEC) (i.e., U-Cd\nand creatinine), we used NHANES III MEC\nlated 6-year MEC weights for the appropriate\ndata release years using 4-year MEC weights\nand 2-year MEC weights. The convergence\ncriterion was satisfied for logistic regression\nanalyses, and global chi-square statistics were\nsignificant, thus providing no indication to\nquestion the validity of model fit. In the linear\nregression analyses, we analyzed two dependent\nvariables in separate regression equations:\nfemur BMD and total hip BMD. Plots of both\ndependent variables approximated normal dis-\ntributions; however, plots of creatinine-\nadjusted U-Cd did not, so we standardized\nUrinary cadmium and osteoporosis in U.S. women  50 years of age\ncreatinine-adjusted U-Cd by natural log\ntransformation of its value + 1.\nResults\nUnadjusted findings.

The smaller\nset may have limited our ability to detect sta-\ntistical significance of adjusted Cd levels\n< 1.00 \u00b5g/g for reported osteoporosis.\nFindings were consistent with our primary\nhypothesis that Cd levels between 0.50 and\n1.0 \u00b5g/g creatinine are associated with osteo-\nporosis, relative to reference group levels of\n 0.50 \u00b5g/g creatinine. Additionally, osteo-\nporosis and BMD were statistically associated\nwith age and underweight, but not with smok-\ning status or income. Self-reported renal\nimpairment was statistically associated with\nself-reported osteoporosis, as well. We found\nevidence of risk of Cd-related osteoporosis at\nlevels less than half that of the OSCAR study\n(Jarup and Alfven 2004). Our ability to detect\nrisks from lower level exposures reflects that\nour population resided in areas of no known\nCd contamination, in contrast to the OSCAR\nstudy population (Jarup and Alfven 2004). In\nopposition to our findings, Horiguchi et al.\n(2005) reported no association between U-Cd\nand BMD in female Japanese farmers. One\npossible explanation is selection bias: those\nwomen able to continue to work as farmers\nand thus be eligible for Horiguchi et al.'s study\nwere likely not to have the debilitating effects\nof osteoporosis. Another design flaw is the lack\nof transparent and objective selection criteria\nfor designated contaminated and uncontami-\nnated populations (Horiguchi et al. 2005).\nOur study has several advantages over pre-\nvious studies. First, we used decreased hip\nBMD measurements based on the WHO\nUrinary cadmium and osteoporosis in U.S. women  50 years of age\nTable 3.

Lack\nof confirmation of respondent-reported diag-\nnostic findings can be interpreted as a limita-\ndata. However, our analysis of NHANES III\nBMD-based data may be limited by the lack of\nexpert consensus on the use of BMD as a diag-\nnostic criterion for osteoporosis (CDC 2007d;\nNational Institutes of Health 2000). Specificity\nis limited; that is, a physician cannot defini-\ntively rule out osteoporosis at other sites\n(Nelson et al. 2002). Moreover, Cummings\net al. (2002) asserted that the relationship\nbetween decreased BMD and increased risk of\nfracture is continuous so that a cutoff value to\ndifferentiate high-risk from low-risk individu-\nals is problematic. Results of multiple linear\nregression analyses that took advantage of con-\ntinuous BMD, however, also revealed an\ninverse association between BMD and U-Cd,\nlending support to the logistic regression analy-\nses of the BMD cutoff value.\nAnother consideration is that diagnostic\ncriteria are based on BMD measures and cut-\noff values calculated for white women, so they\nmay underestimate osteoporosis in minorities\n(CDC 2007d). Of note, a greater proportion\nof white women had hip-BMD\u00addefined\nosteoporosis (88%), compared with the pro-\nportion of white women with the reported\nosteoporosis outcome measure (75%). It is\nalso interesting that white race was signifi-\ncantly associated with decreased BMD using\nmultiple linear regression but not with BMD-\ncutoff\u00addefined osteoporosis using multiple\nlogistic regression. Notwithstanding the limi-\ntations of linear regression for the nonpara-\nmetric continuous primary predictor Cd, the\ndiscrepancy in significance of the dichotomous\nrace covariate may suggest limited application\nof cutoff values to nonwhites. This possibility\nis strengthened by the additional discrepancy\nthat white race was significantly associated\nwith increased odds for self-reported osteo-\nporosis, but not osteoporosis defined by BMD\ncutoff, and merits further research.\nIn this study we did not address fracture\noutcomes; however, it is noteworthy that asso-\nciations between environmental Cd exposure\nand fracture risk have been previously reported\nin the literature. Staessen et al. (1999) found a\nstatistically significant association between a\n2-fold increase in U-Cd and 73% increased\nrisk of fractures in women. The OSCAR study\nreported evidence of an association between\nincreasing Cd exposure and excess risk of fore-\narm fractures in people  50 years of age (Jarup\nthat the fracture hazard ratio increased by 18%\nper 1-nmol Cd/mmol creatinine for this same\nage group. Zhu et al. (2004) reported increased\nfracture prevalence among people  50 years of\nage living in a Cd-polluted area in China com-\npared with residents of a control area.\nA biological mechanism for Cd-induced\nosteoporosis is uncertain. It has been hypoth-\nesized that Cd-induced renal tubular damage\nleads to hypercalciuria, which secondarily\ncauses bone mineral loss (Kjellstrom 1992;\nmechanisms underlying the effects of Cd on\nbone include interference with calcium\nabsorption from the intestines, disruption of\nparathyroid hormone's stimulation of vitamin\nD production in renal cells, and diminished\nkidney enzymatic action to activate vitamin D\n(Kjellstrom 1992). Yet, recent research has\nprovided evidence of primary effects on bone\n(2006) interpreted findings of a positive asso-\nciation between U-Cd and deoxypyridinoline,\na biomarker of bone resorption, to suggest a\ndirect effect of Cd on bone in a Swedish pop-\nulation-based study of women. A Belgian\npopulation-based analysis of women without\nrenal tubular dysfunction, as measured by the\nbiomarker urinary retinol-binding protein,\nshowed a positive association between U-Cd\nand two biomarkers of bone resorption, uri-\nnary hydroxylysylpyridinoline and lysylpyridi-\nA limitation of this study was our inability\nto adjust for biomarkers of renal tubular\nimpairment in the primary analysis and to\nprecisely adjust for Cd-induced tubular kidney\ndamage in the secondary analysis, in which\nparticipant-reported physician diagnosis of\nkidney disease provided a weak surrogate rela-\ntive to tubular dysfunction biomarkers such as\nretinol-binding protein (Schutte et al. 2008)\nConsequently, our analysis did not provide\nevidence to support conclusions regarding the\neffects of Cd on osteoporosis independent of\nrenal tubular dysfunction. However, our find-\nings of increased odds for osteoporosis at Cd\nlevels below those previously associated with\nrenal tubular dysfunction indicate the possibil-\nity of a direct effect. Moreover, Schutte et al.\n(2008) reported findings of direct effects of\nCd on bone, independent of renal tubular dys-\nfunction biomarkers. Further work is needed\nto understand the independent effects of Cd\non osteoporosis and renal tubular dysfunction.\nAn additional limitation of our study was\nthe potential for selection bias. NHANES\nconducts household surveys and does not\ninclude the institutionalized U.S. population.\nColon-Emeric et al. (2007) estimated the\nprevalence of osteoporosis among nursing\nof females. Because of missing data for this\ninstitutionalized elderly population, our find-\nings omit measures of association between Cd\nand osteoporosis for this high-risk subpopula-\ntion. Moreover, NHANES III\u00adexamined\nsample response rates were lowest for women\n 80 years of age, so again, the frail elderly\npopulation may be underrepresented.\nAnother limitation of this study is that Cd\nmeasurements were based on a single urine\nsample that does not capture possible signifi-\ncant temporal variations in U-Cd levels\namong NHANES participants. We adjusted\nU-Cd for urinary creatinine in an attempt to\ncorrect for varying concentrations among\nsamples collected from different individuals at\ndifferent times. Specific gravity has also been\nrecommended for such an adjustment\n(Suwazono et al. 2005), but this variable was\nnot available in NHANES. Although U-Cd\nadjusted for creatinine may be affected by age,\ngender, and body size (Suwazono et al. 2005),\nwe controlled for these influences, and adjust-\nment for creatinine is commonly used, allow-\ning comparisons among a number of studies.\nOther limitations are lack of inclusion of\nother factors that may be associated with the\nrisk of osteoporosis, such as menopause, hor-\nmone replacement therapy, adult calcium or\nvitamin D intake, excessive alcohol intake,\nand personal or family history of fracture.\nConclusion\nThe present study suggests that U.S. women\nare at risk for osteoporosis at U-Cd levels\nbelow the U.S. Occupational Safety and\nHealth Administration's (OSHA) minimum\neven at levels < 1 \u00b5g/g, a concentration not\nassociated with renal tubular damage. The\ncross-sectional design of NHANES limits\ndeterminations of causal associations, and we\ndid not address the onset of osteoporosis in this\nstudy. U-Cd is a biomarker of long-term Cd\nexposure, however, and a temporal sequence\nbetween Cd exposure and osteoporosis is plau-\nsible. This national sample allows calculation\nof an attributable fraction for the entire popu-\nlation. Given that 73% of U.S. women\n 50 years of age are estimated to have Cd\nbody burdens that are associated with excess\nrisk (> 0.50 \u00b5g/g creatinine), as estimated from\nthe NHANES III data set, these results suggest\nthat 21% of osteoporosis prevalence among\nwomen  50 years of age may be attributable\nto Cd. Because these effects have been\nobserved at current U.S. dietary exposures that\nconstitute only 21% of PTWI for Cd (Egan\net al. 2007), there is a need to investigate the\nGallagher et al.\nUrinary cadmium and osteoporosis in U.S. women  50 years of age\nrelationship between Cd and osteoporosis and\nto reexamine the safe levels of Cd in food, the\nmost common source of Cd exposure for the\ngeneral population.\nREFERENCES\nAkesson A, Bjellerup P, Lundh T, Lidfeldt J, Nerbrand C,\nSamlioe G, et al. 2006.
