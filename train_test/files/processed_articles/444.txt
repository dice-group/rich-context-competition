Individuals high on the\nGFP are altruistic, agreeable, relaxed, conscientious,\nsociable, and intellectually open, with high levels of\nwellbeing, satisfaction with life, self-esteem, and emo-\ntional intelligence. The explanation we favor for the\nGFP is that, like g, it arose through evolutionary selec-\ntion for adaptive traits that facilitate performance\nacross a wide range of contexts (Rushton et al., 2008).\nThe main alternative interpretation of the GFP (and\nother higher-order factors above the Big Five) is that\nthey arise from artifacts of evaluative bias and scale\nconstruction (Ashton et al., 2009; B\u00e4ckstrom et al.,\nThe GFP has been found across diverse samples,\nprocedures, and inventories.

(2008) found\nthe genetic variance was primarily of the nonadditive\nvariety (dominance and epistasis). For example, 53%\nof the variance in the GFP extracted from a Prosocial\nQuestionnaire and the EAS temperament scales was\nnonadditive in a study of 575 pairs of 2- to 9-year-old\nKorean twins rated by their mothers. Nonadditive\ngenetic variance is important because it indicates a\ntrait has been under recent natural selection, which is\nexpected for a Darwinian fitness character, i.e., one\nthat leads to greater reproductive success (Fisher,\nhas been found for numerous personality scales as\nwell as for cognitive abilities, albeit sometimes only in\nsmall quantities (e.g., Bouchard & McGue, 2003; Hur,\nal., 1992). Support for genetic dominance also comes\nfrom the preliminary evidence of inbreeding depres-\nsion on components of the GFP, just as there is for the\ng factor of mental ability (Jensen, 1998). Inbreeding\ndepression occurs on a trait when deleterious recessive\nalleles combine to lower the scores of offspring rela-\ntive to parents. Thus, an Italian study found inbred\nfamilies were lower in extraversion and openness to\nexperience (Camperio Ciani et al., 2007). A Dutch\nstudy revealed that the offspring of parents who came\nfrom the same region in the Netherlands (and so were\nmore likely to be inbred) scored lower on sensation\nseeking than those whose parents came from different\nThe existence of a GFP poses interesting theoretical\nquestions regarding its evolutionary and genetic\norigins. Rushton et al. (2008) suggested that because\nindividuals at the positive pole of the GFP possessed\nmore cooperative and prosocial personalities, they left\nmore progeny than those at the negative pole, since\npeople prefer as mates, fellow workers, and leaders,\nthose who are agreeable and emotionally stable. This\nview of social and sexual selection was initially pro-\nposed by Darwin (1871), who suggested that\ndirectional selection acted to endow contemporary\nhumans with more cooperative and less contentious\npersonalities than their archaic ancestors, or than their\nnearest living relatives, the chimpanzees.\nRushton et al. (2008) further proposed that the\nGFP arose from directional selection for a slow life\nhistory strategy. Building on MacArthur and Wilson's\n(1967) analysis of r-K reproductive strategies, which\nexplains how animals and plants populate islands,\ndimension -- K -- underlies much of the field of per-\npersonality traits co-evolved with altruism, intelli-\ngence, attachment styles, growth, health, longevity,\nsexuality, and fecundity to form a cocoordinated suite\nof traits organized to meet the trials of life -- survival,\ngrowth, and reproduction. Unlike conventional per-\nsonality psychology, life history theory predicts hierar-\nchically organized traits, culminating in a single,\nheritable, super-factor. Traits need to be harmonized,\nnot work independently of each other.\nLife History Theory describes the strategic alloca-\ntion of bioenergetic and material resources between\nmajor components of fitness such as survival and\nreproduction. The fast-slow (r-K) continuum repre-\nsents a covarying range of reproductive behavioral\nstrategies inversely relating life history traits such as\nfecundity and parenting. Life History Theory predicts\nthat species living in harsh (high-risk of mortality),\nunpredictable, and uncontrollable environments\nevolve clusters of `fast' life history traits, whereas\nspecies living in predictable, stable, and relatively safe\nand controllable environmental conditions evolve clus-\nters of `slow' life history traits (Ellis et al., 2009).\nHence, the fast life history strategist is a short-term\nplanner, taking benefits opportunistically with little\nregard for long-term consequences. In contrast, the\nslow life history strategist is a long-term planner,\ndelaying immediate gratification in the service of\nfuture eventualities.\nThese considerations suggest that the slow life\nhistory strategy predisposes individuals to favor\nsocially and sexually mutualistic or prosocial over\nantagonistic or antisocial strategies (Figueredo &\nJacobs, 2009). Slow life history strategists are more\nlikely to engage in reciprocally altruistic relationships\nwith both kin and non-kin, as well as with both\nromantic (not just sexual) partners and their offspring.\nSlow life history strategists prefer long-term and coop-\nerative social as well as sexual relationships, which are\neasier and more profitable to maintain in their charac-\nteristically more stable, predictable, and controllable\nenvironments. We should therefore expect life history\nevolution to favor the evolution of the GFP, because\nthe conditions favoring slow life history strategy are\nthose favoring the cooperative sociality indicative of\nthe GFP.\nResearch has confirmed many predictions from life\nhistory theory (Bogaert & Rushton, 1989; Figueredo\namong university students, Bogaert and Rushton\n(1989) found correlations between self-reported delin-\nquency, sex guilt, mating effort (e.g., number of sex\npartners), general intelligence, and an aggregate of\nitems assessing family size, maturational speed,\nlongevity, and altruism. Although the average correla-\ntion between single indices of K-selection was low,\naggregate measures were predictive of a general factor\non which single items loaded an average of .31. The\nresults held true when three separate measures of\nfamily background were statistically controlled.\nIn a twin study, Figueredo et al.

These three lower-order factors formed a sub-\nstantially heritable `Super-K' dimension. Figueredo et\nal.'s (2004) study was based on the National Survey of\nMidlife Development in the US (MIDUS), a representa-\nal. (2007) replicated these results using a sub-sample of\n2,095 non-twin parents who by middle-age had chosen\ntheir life niches to marry (or not), to bear and raise off-\nspring (or not), and to create social networks. Both\nstudies controlled for `social privilege' by regressing out\nlevel of education, race, and family income and found it\naccounted for less than 10% of the variance and did not\nchange the pattern of factor loadings.\nIn the present study, we reanalyze Figueredo et al.'s\n(2004) published twin data to examine whether domi-\nnance covariance contributes to the substantially\nheritable Super-K Factor, thereby suggesting a\ncommon evolutionary history of recent directional\nselection. The phenotypic and genetic correlations\nfound between the K-Factor and the Covitality Factor\nresulted from a direct test of life history theory, in\nwhich decreased morbidity and mortality were pre-\ndicted to be features of a slow life history (e.g., Ellis et\nal., 2009).

Moreover, assortative mating effects\nhave not been taken into account in these models but\nwe know they exist on comparable measures at a sta-\ntistically significant level and are crossculturally\n2009). As such, they will increase the DZ twin correla-\ntions and increase the confidence in our conclusion\nabout not being able to rule out a nonzero nonaddi-\ntive genetic component. The main point of our\nanalysis, however, is that to the extent that there is\nnonadditive genetic variance in these three traits, the\npreponderance of that nonadditive genetic variance is\nshared, presumably indicating a common history of\nrecent directional selection. The fact that this nonaddi-\ntive component of genetic variance is shared among\nthree traits makes this finding relatively unlikely to be\nthe result of a Type I Error.\nDiscussion\nThe present results show that nonadditive (D) models\ncannot be ruled out to account for the shared contri-\nbution of three lower-order heritable factors (a\nlower-order K-Factor, a Covitality health factor, and a\nGFP) to the Super-K Life History Factor identified by\nFigueredo et al. (2004). This suggests these three traits\nhave been under the same recent directional selective\npressures. These genetic correlations support the view\nthat slow (K-selected) life history strategy, good physi-\ncal and mental health, and the GFP coevolved and are\nmutually coadapted. Moreover, it suggests that a slow\nlife history arose from directional selection.\nThe evolutionary genetics of personality has been\nre-gaining theoretical momentum in recent years with\nincreasing effort to compare rival hypotheses using\nquantitative estimates of relevant parameters. For\nexample, Penke et al. (2007) discussed three models of\nthe origins of individual differences -- selective neu-\ntrality, mutation selection balance, and balancing\nselection by environmental heterogeneity. The advan-\ntage of identifying a GFP at the apex of the hierarchy\nof personality is that it clarifies the underlying trait\nstructure, integrates lower-level theories, and helps\nchoose between the competing evolutionary theories.\nAccording to a life history perspective, traits will be\nhierarchically organized, culminating in a single, har-\nbe coordinated and work together, not act indepen-\ndently or in opposition to each other.\nThe well-defined positive and negative pole of the\nGFP (the former being more cooperative and proso-\ncial) suggests how and why unidirectional selection for\npersonality might have occurred from `primeval man\nand his ape-like progenitors', as Darwin (1871, p.\n159) phrased it.

Hrdy argued that it\nwas cooperation among extended kin over child-\nrearing that produced the human life history (and, by\nimplication, the GFP). She wrote, `novel [child]\nrearing conditions among a line of early hominins\nmeant that youngsters grew up depending on a wider\nrange of caretakers than just their mothers, and this\ndependence produced selection pressures that favored\nindividuals who were better able at decoding the\nmental states of others, and figuring out who would\nbetter help and who would hurt' (p. 66).\nOther evolutionary scenarios are possible.\ntheory of runaway social selection for displays of\npartner value and altruism in which competition to be\nselected as a social partner produces runaway selective\nprocesses in the same way that competition to be\nselected as a sexual partner does in runaway sexual\nselection. Individuals prefer social partners who\ndisplay valuable resources and bestow them selectively\non associates. This produces selective pressure for\nindividuals to accurately identify: (1) socially valued\nresources, subject to the economic principles of supply\nand demand; and (2) preferred social partners, based\non their resource and altruistic displays. These selec-\ntive pressures tend to produce genetic correlations\nbetween the resource displays and the partner prefer-\nences. Thus, these traits will come to be correlated\nbecause of runaway social selection for an ideal\nperson. Moreover, people able to cooperate in groups\nare also more likely to win competitions and wars\nThis theory might also help inform the debate in\nother ways. The main alternative to an evolutionary\nexplanation for the GFP is some form of methodologi-\ncal artifact such as social desirability responding (e.g.,\nHowever, such criticisms are psychometrically, but not\nevolutionarily informed. For example, if one seriously\nconsiders Nesse's (2007) theory of runaway social\nselection, then the generally acknowledged population\npreference for a personality profile reflecting the\npattern of the GFP (Figueredo et al., 2006; Miller,\n2007) will inevitably produce selective pressure that\ncreates a GFP even when none previously existed.\nMoreover, the preference for the trait and the trait\nitself would become genetically correlated. Therefore,\nthe existence of an evaluative bias does not, by itself,\nconstitute a sufficient theoretical reason to discount\nthe reality of the GFP, but instead provides grounds to\npropose its existence as a truly substantive phenome-\nnon. In social evolution, an evaluative bias is not a\nmethodological artifact, but a selective pressure (e.g.,\nFisher, 1954). Individuals with a socially desirable\nresponse bias, indicating an evolved preference for\nsocially desirable behaviors in themselves and others,\nwill therefore actually be more likely to carry genes\nfor exhibiting those socially desirable behaviors.\nIn spite of our present emphasis on the evolution-\nary significance of shared nonadditive genetic variance\nfor the coevolution of personality with life history\nstrategy, substantial additive genetic effects have been\ndocumented by ourselves and others in the GFP and\nlower-order traits as well as in life history strategies.\nAs Penke et al. (2007) discuss, additive effects are\ncompatible with balancing selection and with muta-\ntion-selection balance. If allied to runaway social\nselection, this too could imply directional selection\nconsistent with a mutation-selection model including\nboth additive and nonadditive effects. Figueredo,\nWolf, et al. (in press) have recently outlined the multi-\nple selective pressures that have hypothesized to bear\non the evolution of individual behavioral differences.\nMany evolved adaptations are the product of, not one,\nbut multiple selective forces. In Newtonian Physics,\nthe `resultant' is the vector sum of two or more\nvectors representing multiple forces acting simultane-\nously on a single material particle. The same principles\nhold in evolutionary biology.\nAs in contemporary theories of Multilevel Selection\n(Wilson & Wilson, 2007), multiple selective pressures\nmay act on any given trait simultaneously. Thus, there\nis seldom a one-to-one correspondence between a spe-\ncific trait and a specific selective pressure. For\nexample, both intrasexual and intersexual selective\npressures clearly influence female mate choice.\nFemales may prefer males with good genetic quality,\nbut may also prefer males that demonstrate intrasex-\nual dominance. Thus, distinguishing the products of\nintra-sexual competition from intersexual selection,\neven in female mate choice, is a challenge because\nboth may be responsible for the evolution of a particu-\nlar trait. Thus Life History Strategy, the GFP, and\nPersonality in general may be the results of both bal-\nancing and directional natural selection, as well as\nsome elements of runaway social and sexual selection,\ngiving rise to both additive and nonadditive compo-\nnents of genetic variance.\nThe confirmation of a GFP may also shed light on\nthe neurobiology of personality and provide help in\nthe search for personality genes.
