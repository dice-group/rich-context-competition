Cell Counting Kit-8 was used to detect\nHep-2 cell viability at 24 and 48 h following treatment with different CpG ODN7909 concen-\ntrations. Cellular colonization was evaluated using microscopy. Cell cycle distribution and\napoptosis rate was determined with flow cytometry. Interleukin (IL)-12 and tumour necrosis\nfactor (TNF)-a concentrations were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.\nResults: Hep-2 cells were found to express TLR9, and CpG ODN7909 treatment suppressed\nHep-2 cell viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Cell survival curve analyses revealed a\nsensitivity enhancement ratio of the mean death dose of 1.225 for CpG ODN7909 plus irradi-\nation versus irradiation alone. Furthermore, the population of Gap 2/mitotic-phase cells, apo-\nptosis rate and secreted IL-12 and TNF-a levels were significantly increased in Hep-2 cells treated\nwith CpG ODN7909 plus irradiation versus IR alone.\nConclusion: CpG ODN7909 enhanced the radiosensitivity of Hep-2 cells in vitro.\n",

Recent years have seen a trend\ntoward improved post-treatment voice qual-\nity in patients with early-stage LSCC treated\nwith external radiation.4\u00ad7\nRadiotherapy is not only an adjuvant\ntreatment following surgery, but also an\nimportant treatment for patients with local-\nly advanced LSCC who can't undergo sur-\ngical resection or who have a strong desire\nto protect the larynx.8,9 Various studies\nhave shown that irradiation (IR) combined\nwith conventional chemotherapeutic drugs,\nsuch as cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu),\nmay achieve better results compared with\nIR alone.10\u00ad13 Nevertheless, there remains\na risk of recurrence and metastasis in\nsome patients with LSCC, for whom the\nefficacy of re-irradiation is poor and radia-\ntion resistance is prone to occur, resulting in\nreduced quality of life and shorter life\nspan.14 Hence, there is an urgent need to\nexplore an effective radiosensitizer in the\ntreatment of the patients with LSCC.\nRecent studies have indicated that syn-\nthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing\nunmethylated cytosine-phosphate-guanine\nmotifs (CpG ODNs) may induce anti-\ntumour responses as immunoadjuvants in\ncombination with other therapies, via inter-\nacting with toll-like receptors (TLRs) that\nplay a fundamental role in the innate\nimmune system.15\u00ad17 Moreover, a previous\nstudy by the present authors suggested that\nexpressed in human non-small cell lung cancer\nto potentiate X-ray-induced inhibition of pro-\nliferation in this cell line.18 Nevertheless, the\nrole of CpG ODN7909 on the radiosensitivity\nof human epidermoid cancer strain 2 (Hep-2)\ncells, a human laryngeal carcinoma-derived\ncell line, remains unclear.\nIn the present study, TLR9 expression,\ncell radiosensitivity, was assessed. The effects\ncellular proliferation, cell cycle distribution\nand apoptosis was also investigated in the\nHep-2 cells.\nMaterials and methods\nHep-2 cells purchased from the Chinese\nType Culture Collection (CTCC; Wuhan,\nChina) were maintained in the following\nculture medium: Minimum essential\nmedium (MEM; BioWest, Loire Valley,\nFrance) supplemented with 10% foetal\nbovine serum (FBS; Gibco, ThermoFisher\nScientific, Waltham, MA, USA), 100 U/ml\npenicillin G, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin at\nwas obtained from Shanghai Sangon\nBiological Engineering Technology and\nServices Limited Company (Sangon,\nShanghai, China), dissolved in phosphate\nmaintained at \u00ad20C until use.\nWestern blotting\nWhole cells were lysed in protein lysis\nbuffer with 1 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl\nfluoride. Total proteins were harvested\n4C), and protein concentrations were\ndetermined by the Bradford Assay. Briefly,\nequal amounts of proteins (50 mg) were\nseparated by sodium dodecyl sulphate-\npolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and trans-\nferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (EMD\nMillipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Membranes\nwere blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin\n(BSA) and then incubated overnight at 4C\nwith monoclonal mouse anti-TLR9 antibody\nBeverly, MA, USA) and glyceraldehyde-3-\nphosphate dehydrogenase primary antibody\nTechnology, Beverly, MA, USA). After\nthree washes with Tris-buffered saline\nthe membrane was incubated with horserad-\nish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-\nChina) at room temperature for 1 h. The\nmembrane was finally washed three times\nwith TBS-T. TLR9 protein levels were\nexpressed as the optical density value of the\ntarget protein/GAPDH using a G:BOX\nChemiXR5 gel doc system with Gel-Pro32\nsoftware (Syngene, Cambridge, UK).\nReverse transcription (RT) polymerase\nchain reaction (PCR)\nHep-2 cells using TRIzolV\nR Reagent\n(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), then\nreverse transcribed to cDNA using a\nPrimeScriptTM RT Master Mix (TaKaRa,\nDalian, China) according to the manufac-\nturers' instructions. The cDNA was then\namplified using the following TLR9\nprimer sequences: 50-GCAAAGTGGGCG\n(reverse), with AccuPowerV\nR 2X GreenstarTM\nqPCR Master Mix (Bioneer Corporation,\nDaejeon, South Korea). PCR was preformed\nusing the LightCyclerV\nDiagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) with the\nfollowing thermal-cycling conditions: 5 min\nat 95C for pre-denaturation, followed by 32\ntion, and a final extension at 72C for 10 min.\nThe 578 bp reaction product was resolved by\nelectrophoresis using a 1.5% agarose gel,\nstained with ethidium bromide, and photo-\ngraphed using an ultraviolet transilluminator.\nRadiation exposure\nHep-2 cells were exposed to 6 MV X-rays\nusing a linear accelerator (Varian Medical\nSystems, Palo Alto, CA, USA) under the\nsource-to-skin distance of 100 cm, with a\ndose rate of 2.0 Gy/min. Graded irradiated\ndoses, ranging from 0 to 10 Gy, were used\nin Hep-2 clonogenic survival assays. For all\nother experiments, 10 Gy radiation was\nemployed.\nDetection of cell viability via cell counting\nEach well of 96-well plates were seeded with\nmedium. Various concentrations of CpG\nwere added, and the cells incubated for 24\ntreatment, 10 ml of CCK-8 reagent (Dojindo\nLaboratories, Kami Mashiki-gun, Japan)\nwas added to each well, and the cells incu-\nbated for a further 3 h at 37C in the dark.\nOptical densities were then measured at 450\nnm, and cell viability of CpG-treated cells\nwas calculated as a proportion of the\nuntreated cells, as follows: absorbance of\nCpG-treated cells/absorbance of untreated\n2 cells were then seeded as before, and equal-\nly randomized into four groups, comprising:\ngroup (CpG group), irradiation group (IR\ngroup (CpG \u00fe IR group). Based on the\ninitial cell viability results, Hep-2 cells in the\nCpG and CpG \u00fe IR groups were treated\nwith CpG ODN7909 at a final concentration\nof 10 mg/ml, and cells in all groups were cul-\ntured for 24 h. Following 24 h culture at\n37C, cells in the IR and CpG \u00fe IR groups\nwere then exposed to 10 Gy radiation.\nA further 24 or 48 h following irradiation,\ncell viability was determined in all cells using\nthe CCK-8 assay. All experiments were per-\nformed three times for each condition.\nClonogenic survival assay\nHep-2 cells were divided into two treatment\ngroups and incubated for 24 h with or with-\nout CpG ODN7909 at a final concentration\nof 10 mg/ml. Cells were then irradiated with\nand harvested using 0.05% trypsin-EDTA\ndescribed,19 in triplicate. Following incuba-\ntion for 14 days, colonies were stained with\ncrystal violet and fixed in methanol. The\nnumber of stained colonies (not less than\n50 cells) was imaged and counted manually\nunder a microscope. The clonogenic surviv-\nal fraction (%) was calculated as follows:\n(irradiated cell colony numbers/unirradi-\nated cell colony numbers) \u00c2 100. The radio-\nbiological parameters (D0\n, N, Dq\n) were\nanalysed with a single-hit multi-target\nis the radiation dose that can\nreduce survival by a factor of 1/e in the\nexponential region of the curve, N is the\nextrapolation number or zero-dose extrap-\nolate, Dq\nis the quasithreshold dose,\nDq\nCell cycle and apoptosis analysed\nby flow cytometry\nHep-2 cells, growing in logarithmic phase in\nsix-well plates, were divided into four treat-\nment groups (control group, CpG group,\nIR group, and CpG \u00fe IR group) as above.\nation (IR groups only), cells of each group\nwere harvested. The cell cycle distribution\n(proportion of cells in Gap 2/Mitotic phase\n[G2/M]) was detected by measuring the\nDNA content stained with propidium\niodide (PI; BD Biosciences, San Jose,\nUSA) in the presence of RNase, according\nto the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly,\nwere harvested using 0.05% trypsin-EDTA\nand centrifuged at 233 g at room tempera-\nture for 5 min. The cells were then fixed\nwith 70% cold ethanol overnight at\ning solution (containing 200 ml of RNase/\nPI) at room temperature for 15 min in the\ndark prior to flow cytometry. The propor-\ntion of apoptotic cells was determined using\nan annexin V fluorescein isothiocyanate\n(FITC) apoptosis detection kit (BD\nBiosciences, San Jose, USA). Briefly, har-\nvested cell pellets were resuspended in\n190 ml binding buffer and stained with 5 ml\nof annexin V FITC and 5 ml of PI staining\nsolution for 30 min at room temperature in\nthe dark. Cell cycle and apoptosis were\nevaluated by flow cytometry using a\nFACScanTM system with CellQuestTM soft-\nware, version 3.3 (Becton Dickinson,\nMountain View, CA, USA), according to\nthe manufacturer's instructions. The pro-\nportion of cells in G2/M phase was calcu-\nlated as: (number of cells in G2/M phase/\ntotal number of cells) \u00c2 100.

Human\nIL-12 ValukineTM enzyme-linked immuno-\nsorbent assay (ELISA) kit and Human\nTNF-alpha ValukineTM ELISA Kit (R&D\nSystems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) were\nused to measure secreted IL-12 and TNF-\na levels, respectively.\nStatistical analyses\nGraphPad Prism software, version 5.0\n(GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA)\nwas used for data analyses and graph pro-\nduction. All data are presented as mean\n\u00c6 SD of at least three independent experi-\nments. A single-hit multi-target model was\nused to fit colony counts to a clonogenic\nsurvival curve. Differences in cell viability,\nflow cytometric analyses or secreted cyto-\nkine levels between the treatment groups\nwere determined by one-way analysis of\nvariance (ANOVA) using Tukey's honest\nsignificant difference (HSD) multiple com-\nparisons test. The two treatment groups in\nthe clonogenic survival assay were analysed\nusing Student's t-test. A P-value <0.05 was\nconsidered statistically significant.\nResults\nExpression of TLR9 in Hep-2 cells\nWestern blots and RT-PCR results showed\nthat TLR9 was expressed in Hep-2 cells.\nThe optical density value of TLR9/\nPCR revealed a product of 578 bp, which\ncorresponded to the expected TLR9 frag-\nment size (Figure 1b).\nCell viability\nwas shown to be inhibited in a dose-and\ntime-dependent manner (P <0.01), dis-\nplayed by a gradually increasing inhibitory\ncentrations and lower cell viability at the\nhigher concentrations between 24 and 48 h\n(Figure 2a).

The mechanism may be that\naltered the cell cycle distribution, with\ncell arrest at G2/M phase, in which the\ncells were more sensitive to radiation\nand were more likely to enter the apoptotic\npathway.\nFurthermore, the present study showed\nthat at 24 and 48 h following irradiation,\nIL-12 and TNF-a secretion by Hep-2 cells\nwas significantly increased in cells treated\ncompared with X-rays alone. IL-12 is\nknown to play a significant role in inhibit-\ning tumour development and metastasis,37\nand TNF-a is a cell factor with strong direct\nantitumour activity, that is reported to be\nclosely involved with radiation sensitivity.38\nTNF-a has been shown to inhibit the pro-\nliferation of various tumour cells, and to\nthat IL-12 and TNF-a could be up-\nregulated in the human glioma cell line\n(CHG-5) when these cells were treated\nwith a combination of CpG ODN and\n\u00df-rays, which apparently inhibited cell clo-\nnogenic survival.41 Similarly, the present\nresults showed that secretion of IL-12 and\nTNF-a had an increasing trend following\ntion of IL-12 and TNF-a was increased\nmore significantly following treatment\nThe present authors hypothesize that Hep-2\ncells can secrete these factors through\nautocrine mechanisms, and these factors\nmay participate in improving the roles\ntumour cells.\nIn conclusion, the present results showed\nradiation decreased cellular clonogenic\nsurvival and increased cellular apoptosis,\npercentage of cells at G2/M phase and\nsecretion of specific cytokines, compared\nwith X-ray radiation alone, suggesting\nradiosensitivity of Hep-2 cells in vitro.\nThese results may provide a clinical per-\nspective for improvement of radiotherapy\ntreatment effects in patients with LSCC.\nHowever, the precise mechanisms by\nwhich TLR9 may mediate signal transduc-\ntion pathways related to radiosensitivity\nremain unclear, and require further studies.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research was supported by the Jinshan\nDistrict Health and Family Planning\nReferences\n1.
