However, the most\nsuitable type of plate remains controversial.\nAn improper implant may cause changes in\nthe local biomechanical environment of the\nfeet, leading to complications such as implant\nbreakage, loss of reduction, and malunion.2\nTherefore, the biomechanical characteristics\nof different plates must be evaluated.\nBiomechanical research of the irregularly\nshaped first TMT joint is difficult using\ncorpse specimens.3 Therefore, a three-\ndimensional (3D) model of first TMT joint\nfracture-dislocation was established by finite\nelement analysis (FEA), and fixation was\nsimulated using two kinds of plates: a lock-\ning plate (DARCO Modular Forefoot\nSystem UPS 2.7 Plate; Wright Medical\nGroup, Memphis, TN, USA) and a five-\nhole 1/4 tubular plate (Kanghui Medical,\nChangzhou, China). The aim of this study\nwas to determine the displacement of the\narticular surface and the stress distribution\nof each plate and thus provide experimental\nevidence for the choice of plate when repair-\ning first TMT joint injuries.\nMethods\nGeneral data\nA 35-year-old healthy male Chinese volunteer\nPhysical and X-ray examinations of his foot\nshowed no deformities or damage. The vol-\nunteer provided written informed consent\nregarding the potential radiation hazard.\nThe experiment was approved by the Ethics\nCommittee of Ningbo No. 2 Hospital.\nEquipment and software\nThe following equipment and software\nwere used in the present study: (1) a 4D\ndual-source CT system (Siemens, Erlangen,\nLeuven, Belgium), (3) Geomagic Studio\n(Geomagic, Morrisville, NC, USA), (4)\n` mes, Ve\n\u00b4 lizy-\nVillacoublay, France), and (5) ANSYS 13.0\n(ANSYS Ltd., Canonsburg, PA, USA).\nExperimental method\nThe 4D dual-source CT system was used to\nscan the volunteer from the lower segment\nof the leg to the whole foot in the neutral\nposition. The original CT image data were\nmodel of the foot. After optimization, the\nmodel was loaded into ANSYS 13.0 to\nobtain a 3D FEA model of the foot with\nials in the model were simplified as homo-\ngeneous elastic materials. The thickness of\nthe cortical bone was set at 2 mm, and the\nligaments and plantar fascia were estab-\nlished by a two-node truss unit. The model\nof the foot was then loaded into\nthe dorsal and plantar ligaments between\nthe medial cuneiform and first metatarsal\nand performing an osteotomy along the\narticular surface of the first TMT joint, thus\ncreating a first TMT joint intra-articular\nfracture model.4\nThe geometric parameters of the plates\nand screws were loaded into SolidWorks\n2010, and two implant models were estab-\nlished according to the experiment. The\nlocking plate was placed on the dorsal side\nof the first TMT joint, and trans-articular\nfixation was performed with four locking\nscrews that were respectively fixed to the\nplate according to the designed directions.\nThe five-hole 1/4 tubular plate was also\nplaced on the dorsal side of the first TMT\njoint, and trans-articular fixation was per-\nformed with four cortical screws perpen-\ndicular to the plate with two screws on each\nside of the joint.\nAccording to the mechanism of TMT\njoint injury, the ankle was fixed at 30 of\nplantar flexion. We set the lowest contact\npoint of the tibia and fibula and the head of\nthe first metatarsal with the ground as the\nconstraint point. The load was 700 N in\naccordance with the body weight. The dir-\nection was set from the lower leg perpen-\ndicular to the ground, while the reverse\ndirection was set in the head of the first\nmetatarsal. The tensile force caused by the\ntraction of the muscles and ligaments that\naround the joint could be offset according to\nthe principle of the synthesis and decompos-\nition of the force.5\nResults\nDisplacement of articular surface\nAfter application of the 700-N load, both of\nthe plates provided firm fixation of the\nmodel without breakage of the plates or\ndestruction of the model. However, the\narticular surface still showed a tendency\ntoward dorsal dislocation in both models.\nThe maximum displacement in the locking\nappeared in the first metatarsal head.\nHowever, the minimum displacement in\nin the first TMT articular surface. The\nmaximum displacement in the 1/4 tubular\nappeared in the first metatarsal head.\nHowever, the minimum displacement in\nin the first TMT articular surface (Figure 1).\nStress distribution in both implants\nAfter application of the 700-N load, a\nbalanced stress distribution was observed\nin both the locking plate and 1/4 tubular\nplate models. The maximum stress in the\nwhich was mainly concentrated in the holes\nof the locking plate and in the locking\nscrews, especially on the side of the first\nmetatarsal, which supported more stress\nthan did the the side of the medial cunei-\nform. The maximum stress in the 1/4 tubular\nwas also mainly concentrated in the holes\nof the plate and in the screws on the side of\nthe first metatarsal (Figure 2).\nDiscussion\nFEA is used for biomechanical research\nbecause of its special advantage of high-\naccuracy simulation of complex shapes and\nmaterial properties.6,7 In the present study,\nthe original data from the CT scan of the\nfoot was loaded into Mimics 12.0 software\nto obtain an initial 3D model of the foot.\nSolidWorks 2010 was then used to cleave the\nmodel according to a Myerson classification\ntype B1 injury to obtain a model of first\nTMT joint fracture-dislocation. ANSYS\n13.0 can simulate operations and\nassign physical properties to implants.\nAfter loading, calculations could be carried\nout to determine the displacement of the\narticular surface and the stress distribution\nin the implants. However, FEA also has\nintrinsic limitations because the mechanical\nproperties of materials are defined as con-\ntinuous, homogeneous, and isotropic; there-\nfore, this assumption will be slightly\ndifferent from the real situation of the first\nTMT joint itself.8,9\nAccording to the mechanism of TMT\njoint injury, the model was axially loaded at\n30 of plantar flexion of the ankle. To more\naccurately reflect the displacement of the\narticular surface and stress distribution of\nthe implants, the fracture line and articular\nsurface were replaced and bonded by soft\nmaterial with a modulus of elasticity of\n5 MPa and Poisson ratio of 0.40, and the\ntitanium plate and screws were replaced with\na material with a modulus of elasticity of\nloading, the results showed that the\nFigure 1. Displacement of the articular surface. (a) The maximum displacement in the locking plate fixation\nmodel was 6.4710 mm, which appeared in the first metatarsal head, and the minimum displacement in this\nmodel was 0.6471 mm, which appeared on the articular surface of the first tarsometatarsal joint. (b) The\nmaximum displacement in the 1/4 tubular plate fixation model was 4.5990 mm, which appeared in the first\nmetatarsal head, and the minimum displacement in this model was 0.3833 mm, which appeared on the\narticular surface of the first tarsometatarsal joint.\nFigure 2. Stress distribution in the implants. (a) The maximum stress in the locking plate was\n1.212 \u00c2 103 MPa, which was mainly concentrated in the holes of the locking plate and in the locking screws.\n(b) The maximum stress in the 1/4 tubular plate was 1.107 \u00c2 103 MPa, which was also mainly concentrated in\nthe holes of the plate and in the screws on the side of the first metatarsal.\ndisplacement of the articular surface was\n<2 mm in both models, indicating that both\nof the implants could provide firm fix-\nation.10 However, the articular surface still\nshowed a tendency toward dorsal disloca-\ntion in both models. In the locking plate\nfixation model, the minimum displacement\nplate fixation model. These results show that\nthe firm fixation provided by either the\nlocking plate or 1/4 tubular plate could\nrestore the normal anatomy and slight\nmobility of the first TMT joint. According\nto the FEA results, the maximum displace-\nments were located in the in the head of the\nfirst metatarsal bone in both models.\nTherefore, in patients with a first TMT\njoint injury, it is advisable to avoid weight\nbearing on the foot regardless of whether the\nimplants are fixed. Continued weight bear-\ning may cause instability of the first ray,\nleading to complications such as metatar-\nsalgia, plantar fasciitis, and pressure ulcer\nThe stress distribution in the implants\nwas balanced in both the locking plate\nand 1/4 tubular plate models. The\nimplants exhibit a certain stress-shielding\neffect, which is beneficial for early fracture\nhealing and early functional exercise with-\nout weight bearing.12 In the present study,\nthe maximum stress in the locking\nplate and 1/4 tubular plate were\nrespectively, and mainly concentrated in\nthe holes of the plates and screws, espe-\ncially on the side of the first metatarsal.\nThus, the stress was slightly larger in the\nlocking plate than in the 1/4 tubular plate,\nand the locking plate could accordingly\nprovide a greater stress-shielding effect. A\ncertain stress-shielding effect may be bene-\nficial to a fracture, but it can become\ndetrimental if the stress-shielding effect is\ntoo strong because it may result in\nimplant breakage and fracture nonunion.13\nTherefore, the patient should avoid weight\nbearing on the foot when an implant is\npresent in the first TMT joint. It is advisable\nto remove the plate if the patient wants to\nwalk or run after the first TMT joint injury\nhas healed.14 During removal of the implant,\nsurgeons should pay close attention to the\nholes of the plates and screws, where the\nstress is more concentrated.\nThe main factor affecting the prognosis of\nTMT joint injury is maintenance of the\ncongruity of the articular surface by\nimplants. Many kinds of implants can be\nused for fixation of the TMT joint.\nHowever, K-wires are considered useless\nfor fixation of the first TMT joint because\nthey cannot provide solid fixation.15 Staples\nare more suitable for fixation of TMT joint\nsubluxation.16 Occasionally, in some cases\nof comminuted TMT joint fracture-disloca-\ntion, the use of cannulated screws will\neventually lead to failure of the fixation\nbecause the guide pin cannot be drilled\nthough the articular surface. Therefore, a\nplate might be the most suitable implant in\nthis situation. In the present study, we\nevaluated both a locking plate and 1/4\ntubular plate. The results showed that both\nof the plates were suitable for fixation of first\nTMT joint fracture-dislocation. The locking\nplate used in this study was the DARCO\nModular Forefoot System UPS 2.7 Plate,\nwhich is mainly used for fusion of the\nforefoot; however, it can also be used for\nfixation of forefoot fractures.17 Compared\nwith the 1/4 tubular plate used in this study,\nit had no obvious advantages in fixing a\nfracture-dislocation over a comminuted\nfracture-dislocation. Furthermore, a\nlocking plate may cost more than a 1/4\ntubular plate in many developing coun-\ntries.18,19 Therefore, fixation of first TMT\njoint fracture-dislocation using a 1/4 tubular\nplate is more suitable than using a locking\nplate with respect to both biomechanical\nand economical factors and can be widely\nused in the clinical setting.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis study was supported by a grant from the\nNatural Science Foundation of Ningbo City (No.\nReferences\n1.
