Age-adjusted\nlinear regression analyses were used to estimate gender- and ethnic-speci\u00aec WC values corresponding to overweight\nand obesity. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were also employed to determine the choices of WC\nvalues corresponding to the established BMI cut-off points.

De\u00aening the anthropometric variables that satisfactorily describe reasons for ethnic\ndifferences in cardiovascular disease is one of the challenges for future research.\nKeywords: abdominal obesity; BMI; NHANES III; ROC; waist circumference\nIntroduction\nThe most widely used anthropometric measure of total\nand overall body adiposity is the body mass index\n(BMI). BMI is a height-adjusted weight that is asso-\nciated with many cardiovascular diseases (CVD)\nincluding stroke, non-insulin dependent (type 2) dia-\nbetes mellitus and hypertension.1 \u00b1 3 High BMI has\nalso been shown to be associated with all-cause\nmortality in different population groups.4,5 However,\nmany studies report that abdominal or central obesity,\nwhich represents an aberrant fat accumulation, is\nequally as important as BMI, and may be a more\npotent adiposity phenotype and a better predictor for\nCVD or mortality in some population groups.6,7\nFirst described as gynoid and android body habitus\nsome 40 years ago,8 the mechanism of abdominal fat\ndistribution in CVD is not clear. Two possible\nmechanisms have been suggested for the mode of\naction of abdominal adiposity. First, through the\nhighly sensitive lipolytic and hypertrophied visceral\nadipose tissues, elevated free fatty acids may induce\ninsulin resistance.9,10 Second, elevated free testoster-\none and reduced sex-hormone-binding globulin may\npromote increased abdominal adiposity and reduce\nfractional hepatic extraction of insulin.11 Thus, the\nconnection of adiposity with CVD may be due to\nenlarged visceral fat depots discharging free fatty\nacids into the portal and systemic circulation.9 \u00b1 11\nAdequate assessment of abdominal adiposity\nrequires imaging techniques, such as computed tomo-\ngraphy and magnetic resonance.12,13 Due to the high\n*Correspondence: IS Okosun, Department of Community\nMedicine, Mercer University School of Medicine, 1550 College\nE-mail: okosun_i@mercer.edu\nwww.nature.com/ijo\ncosts and labor requirement, and possible risk of\nradiation, imaging techniques are often limited to\nlaboratory settings. Hence, anthropometric surrogates\nare commonly employed. Waist circumference (WC)\nhas been endorsed as the best anthropometric surro-\ngate of abdominal adiposity.12,14 WC is an aggregate\nmeasurement of the actual amount of total and abdom-\ninal fat accumulation and is a crucial correlate of\nabnormal metabolic syndromes found among obese\nand overweight subjects.14,15 WC measurement is\nsimple, requires only a \u00afexible tape and, with appro-\npriate training, measurement error is low due to large\ncircumference. Indeed, many are now advocating\nWC as a valid anthropometric variable for health\npromotion and the basis for alerting those at risk of\nWC is highly correlated with visceral adipose tissue\naccumulation.20 \u00b1 22 Visceral adiposity is the compo-\nnent of body composition that is most highly asso-\nciated with many metabolic abnormalities such as\nhypertension, glucose intolerance, hyperinsulinemia,\nhypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and high\nlevels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.1,23 \u00b1 27\nDespite numerous reports stating that the higher\nrisks of CVD in non-whites compared with whites\nmay be explained by their difference in adiposity\nphenotypes, only little information is available on\nthe relationship between overall adiposity and abdom-\ninal adiposity in white, black and hispanic Americans.\nIn this research, we took advantage of the third US\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES III) to examine whether these ethnic\ngroups have the same levels of abdominal fat accu-\nmulation at the established BMI cut-off points for\noverall body overweight and obesity. BMI of 25 \u00b1\nhave been endorsed my many international agencies\nas the levels of adiposity for increased risk of obesity\nMethods\nStudy population\nNHANES III was a multistage probability sample of\nnon-institutionalized civilian US population groups\nand measurement procedures have been extensively\ndescribed elsewhere.29,30 Only subjects identi\u00aeed as\nnon-hispanic white, non-hispanic black and hispanic\nAmericans aged 17 \u00b1 90 y were eligible for this inves-\ntigation. This study was also restricted to individuals\nfor whom anthropometric measurements were avail-\nable, including weight, height, hip, and waist.\nAnthropometric measurements\nWeight was measured in the upright position using a\ndigital scale. Waist measurement was made to the\nnearest 0.1 cm at midpoint between the bottom of the\nrib cage and above the top of the iliac crest. Height\nwas measured in meters to the nearest 0.1 cm using a\nstadiometer against a vertical wall with a rigid head-\nboard using an inelastic tape measure. A description\nof measurement precision between technicians has\nbeen given elsewhere.31 BMI was calculated as the\nmeasured weight in kilograms divided by height in\nmeters squared (kgam2).\nStatistical methods\nStatistical programs available in SPSS32 (version 9.0)\nutilized for these analyses. Means and standard devia-\ntions of age and anthropometric variables were com-\nputed and compared within gender and across ethnic\ngroup. Pearson's correlation analysis was utilized to\nquantify the univariate relationship between BMI and\nWC. The prevalence of abdominal adiposity was age-\nadjusted by direct methods using the 1990 US popula-\ntion census data. Linear regression analyses were\nperformed to determine gender- and ethnic-speci\u00aec\nFurther adjustment for age was made using gender\nand ethnic speci\u00aec median value of age. In the linear\nregression, the full model was speci\u00aeed as:\nhispanic\nblack \u00c2 waist\nhispanic \u00c2 waist\nwhere a is the intercept, and black\u00c2waist and\nhispanic\u00c2waist are interaction terms for black with\nWC, and hispanic with WC, respectively, created\nfrom dummy variables in which the WC values for\nnon-whites were compared with whites. Hence,\nWC values corresponding to each established BMI\ncut-points were calculated as:\nWC value \nblack \u00c0 b3\nhispanic\nblack \u00c2 waist  b6\nhispanic \u00c2 waist\nGender- and ethnic-speci\u00aec receiver operating char-\nacteristic (ROC) curves were also evaluated to deter-\nmine WC values corresponding to BMI cut-off\npoints.34,35 With the ROC technique, comparison of\nsensitivity with the false-positive rate for BMI cut-off\npoint was made over the entire range of WC values.\nWC value corresponding to an established BMI cut-\noff point was determined by interpolation from the\npoint of intersect of the lines of speci\u00aecity and\nsensitivity.34 The point of intersect between lines\nof speci\u00aecity and sensitivity represent the highest\nnumbers of subjects with and without overweight or\nobesity.\nAbdominal adiposity in US adults\nIS Okosun et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nThe areas under each curve (AUCs) were calculated\nand bootstrapping procedures were used to estimate\nthe 95% con\u00aedence intervals and to determine\nwhether ROC curves were similar across ethnic\ngroups.35 The plausible values of AUC range between\nrandom, worse than random, and better than random,\nrespectively, while the value of 1 indicate a perfect\nResults\nThe anthropometric characteristics of the participants\nand 4628 hispanic Americans) were eligible for this\ninvestigation. There were signi\u00aecant ethnic differ-\nences for some variables, with whites tending to be\nolder than their black and hispanic men counterparts.\nWhite men had greater waist girth than black and\nhispanic men (P `0.01). Among women, blacks had\nsigni\u00aecantly higher mean weight, BMI and WC values\nthan whites or hispanic counterparts (P `0.01).\nAge-adjusted distribution of elevated WC by\ngender and ethnicity is presented in Figure 1. Overall,\nthe prevalence of abdominal adiposity, de\u00aened as\nnic American men, respectively. The corresponding\nvalues for white, black and hispanic American women\nrecently been recommended by the National Institute\nof Health (NIH) expert panels for identifying\nincreased relative risk for obesity co-morbidities.19\nAge-adjusted Pearson's correlation analyses were\nperformed to determine the degree of linear associa-\ntion of BMI with WC. BMI, as expected, very highly\ncorrelated with waist girth in men and women\nstrongly correlated with WC in blacks (r  0.94) than\nalso more highly correlated with WC in black women\nhispanic (r  0.88) counterparts. The explained var-\niances obtained from linear regression models for the\nprediction of WC from BMI were similar to the results\nof correlation analyses. The overall explained var-\niances were high (r 2 ! 0.82) and tended to decrease\nwith age in the three ethnic groups (data not shown).\nA similar stronger r 2 value for BMI with WC was also\nobserved in blacks than in whites or hispanics.\nLinear regression-derived age-adjusted WC values\ncorresponding to the established BMI cut-off points\nare shown in Table 2. Overall, with the exception of\nyoung women, white men and white women had\nconsistently higher WC values at a given level of\noverall adiposity than their black and hispanic coun-\nterparts. Also, the estimated WC corresponding to\noverweight and obesity tended to increase with age.\nThe model for men and women explained 87% and\n83% of the variances in WC, respectively.\nTable 2 summarizes the \u00aendings of linear regres-\nsion analyses of WC values corresponding to BMI of\nmiddle-aged adults, and elderly. In the young adult\nmen, WC values corresponding to BMI of 25 kgam2\nTable 1 Descriptive analysis of study participants\nNon-hispanic\nwhite\nNon-hispanic\nblack\nHispanic\nAmerican\nMen\nWomen\nmen and women.\nAbdominal adiposity in US adults\nIS Okosun et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nranged from 85 cm in blacks to 89 cm in whites. In the\nmiddle-aged adult men, the WC values ranged from\n88 cm in blacks to 92 cm in whites, while in the\nelderly the values ranged from 92 cm in blacks to\n106 cm in whites. The corresponding values for obe-\nsity in young adult men ranged from 99 cm in blacks\nin whites middle-aged and from 107 cm in black to\n110 cm in white elderly. Among women, WC values\ncorresponding to overweight ranged from 81 cm in\nblack to 83 cm in hispanic young adults. Among the\nmiddle-aged adult women, the WC ranged from 83 cm\nin blacks to 86 cm in whites, while in the elderly the\nvalues ranged from 87 cm in blacks to 89 cm in\nwhites. The analogous values for obesity in young\nadult women ranged from 93 cm in black to 96 cm in\nwhites, from 95 cm in blacks to 98 cm in middle-aged\nwhites and hispanics, and from 98 cm in black to\nTable 3 presents the \u00aendings of ROC analyses of\nWC for BMI that jointly provided optimal sensitivity\nand speci\u00aecity for overweight and obesity. In the\nyoung adult men, WC values that maximized sensi-\ntivity and speci\u00aecity for overweight ranged from\n84 cm in blacks to 89 cm in whites. In the middle-\naged adult men, the WC values ranged from 91 cm in\nblacks to 95 cm in whites, while in the elderly the\nvalues ranged from 95 cm in blacks to 98 cm in\nwhites. The analogous values for obesity in young\nadult men ranged from 96 cm in blacks to 99 cm in\nmiddle-aged and from 103 cm in both black and\nhispanic to 105 cm in white elderly. Among women,\nWC values of 83 cm corresponded to overweight in\nyoung adults of the three ethnic groups. Among the\nmiddle-aged adult women, the WC ranged from 89 cm\nin blacks and whites to 90 cm in the hispanics, while\nin the elderly the values ranged from 90 cm in blacks\nwere respectively associated with obesity in young\nand middle-aged adult women of the three ethnic\ngroups. In the elderly women, WC optimizing sensi-\ntivity and speci\u00aecity for obesity ranged from 100 cm\nin blacks and whites to 101 cm in the hispanics.\nThe overall performance of the ROC curves for the\nestablished BMI cut-points was quanti\u00aeed by comput-\ning gender- and age-speci\u00aec AUCs (Table 4). Overall,\nWC tended to perform better for obesity compared to\nunderweight in all ethnic groups. In all ethnic groups,\nWC performed better than what was expected by\nrandom chance in classifying subjects to their true\noverall adiposity status (AUC b0.50). Also, WC\ntended to perform better for the established BMI\ncut-off points in young adults compared to middle-\naged adults and the elderly.\nWe combined men and women separately and\ndetermined gender-speci\u00aec WC values for overweight\nand obesity. As shown in Table 5, WC values of 91\nand 86 cm corresponded to overweight in men and\nwomen, respectively, using linear regression models.\nTable 2 Linear regression derived age- and ethnic-speci\u00aec waist circumference values corresponding to BMI cut-off points\nMen Women\nAge group White Black Hispanic White Black Hispanic\nWaist circumference values are in cm with 95% con\u00aedence intervals.\nTable 3 ROC derived age- and ethnic-speci\u00aec waist circumference values corresponding to BMI cut-off points\nMen Women\nAge group White Black Hispanic White Black Hispanic\nWaist circumference values are in cm with 95% con\u00aedence intervals.\nAbdominal adiposity in US adults\nIS Okosun et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nWC values of 103 and 97 cm corresponded to obesity\nin men and women, respectively, using linear regres-\nsion models. The corresponding values using ROC\ntechniques were 92 cm (sensitivity 85%, speci\u00aecity\noverweight, and 101 cm (sensitivity 90%, speci\u00aecity\nobesity in men and women, respectively.\nGender- and ethnic-speci\u00aec ROC curves of WC for\nobesity are shown in Figure 2. The ROC curves\nvisually represent the relationship between sensitivity\n(true positive rate) and 1-speci\u00aecity (false-positive\nrate) for each of the three ethnic groups over the\nentire range of WC. Like the observed curves for\noverweight (\u00aegure not shown), the AUCs associated\nwith obesity in each ethnic group were signi\u00aecantly\nhigher than what was expected by chance alone\n(P `0.01). Overall there were no statistically signi\u00ae-\ncant ethnic differences in the AUCs for males and for\nfemales of the three groups, indicating that WC\nperformed reasonably well in identifying overweight\nand obese subjects in the three groups.\nDiscussion\nAlthough a large body of epidemiological data sug-\ngests BMI to be as an important obesity phenotype in\nCVD, many investigators think aberrant fat localiza-\ntion, as seen in central or abdominal body regions,\nsuggested by some investigators, blacks have higher\nupper-body adiposity, based on subscapular skinfold\nthickness and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) compared to\nwhites,36 hence blacks are more likely to have larger\nvisceral fat deposits.37 Some studies conclude that\nblacks propensity to metabolic aberrations may be a\nresult of more excess visceral adiposity compared\nTable 4 Areas under the ROC curves of waist circumference for BMI strati\u00aeed by age\nMen Women\nAge group White Black Hispanic White Black Hispanic\nTable 5 Gender-speci\u00aec waist circumference values corre-\nsponding to overweight and obesity\nMethods Men Women\nLinear regression\nReceiver operating characteristics (ROC)\nWaist circumference values are in cm with 95% con\u00aedence\ninterval.\nFigure 2 Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves\ncomparing waist girth values corresponding to obesity\n(BMI ! 30 kgam2) in whites, blacks and hispanics.\nAbdominal adiposity in US adults\nIS Okosun et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nwith whites. Others have postulated that the propen-\nsity for CVD among blacks may be due to the stronger\ncorrelation between abdominal adiposity and visceral\nadipose tissue in blacks than in whites.37\nMany studies investigating the association between\nmetabolic abnormalities have used WHR as a surro-\ngate measure of abdominal adiposity because of some\nassertions that WHR show a more potent association\nwith CVD in some populations.38 Indeed, WHR is\nassociated with risk of CVD in several populations,\nindependent of BMI, where WC does not remain\nindependent. WC has been advocated in the guidelines\nfor overweight and obese individuals;19 thus, in this\ngroup WHR would be a reasonable measure. Since\nobese and non obese subjects can have same WHR, it\nmay re\u00afect the fact that WHR can capture relative fat\ndistribution more independently of BMI or total\nobesity. However, in this analysis we chose to use\nonly WC to assess abdominal adiposity because of the\ninherent weakness of WHR as a ratio index,39,40 and\nbecause it is strongly in\u00afuenced by pelvic structure.41\nConsistent with previous \u00aendings, the results of this\ninvestigation showed BMI to be more strongly corre-\nlated with WC in blacks than whites and hispanics.37\nDespite black men having similar mean weight and\nBMI as white men, and black women having signi\u00ae-\ncantly higher mean values of weight and BMI com-\npared with white women, black men and black women\nwere found to have lower WC values at given levels\nof overweight and obesity. hispanic men and women\nwere also found to have signi\u00aecantly lower WC\nvalues than their white counterparts at the given\nin relation to small WC girth in blacks is consistent\nwith studies by Conway et al,37 Albu et al 42 and\nDowling and Pi-Sunyer,43 who also found blacks to\nhave less visceral adipose tissues than whites at\nsimilar BMI values: our result is also consistent with\nstudies by Stevens et al,44 who found the ratio of\nabdomen to midarm circumference was larger in\nwhite women than black women.\nIn a study by Lean et al,18 WC ! 94 cm for men\nand ! 80 cm for women were found to correspond to\nmen and ! 88 cm for women were found to corre-\nspond to a BMI of 30 kgam2 or greater. Although it is\ngenerally known that for a given waist girth, there is\nselective accumulation of visceral tissue with age,\nLean et al 18 did not consider age in the determination\nof WC values corresponding to obesity. In addition,\nLean et al 45 included the criterion of high WHR\nmate WC values corresponding to these BMI cut-off\npoints. Indeed, these WC values were designed for\nhealth promotion to give optimal enrichment to indi-\nviduals in need of weight management because of\noverweightaobesity or because of central fat distribu-\ntion. It is therefore not surprising that the WC values\nfrom our study are different. The studies by Lean and\ncolleagues18 were also restricted to white populations\nfrom The Netherlands and Canada, and generaliza-\nbility of the results is highly controversial.\nThe data presented for this analysis have the\nadvantage of being large and national in scope,\nmaking the results more generalizable to the overall\nUS population. The training program and quality\ncontrol measures instituted in NHANES III give an\nadded credence to the data. The observed differences\nin WC values corresponding to the established BMI\ncut-points in this study between regression and ROC\nmethods were not surprising. With the regression\nmethod, WC is assumed to be a linear function of\nBMI, where as ROC procedures are based on the best\ncombination of sensitivity and speci\u00aecity.\nOur results showed that the regression and ROC\nmodels \u00aetted the data reasonably well, as indicated by\nrespectively. However, the decision on what cut-off\npoints to use must not be based on model performance\nalone. Other additional factors, such as the overall\nimpact on health due to intervention (eg weight\nreduction), potential burden on health services if a\nlow cut-off point is employed, and the bene\u00aet of\nalerting people developing a weight problem, must\nbe considered in determining what WC value to\nrecommend.\nConclusion\nIn summary, the lack of higher values of WC at\nsimilar BMI cut-off points in non-whites compared\nwith whites de\u00aees previously held notions regarding\nthe role of abdominal adiposity in CVD experienced\nby non-whites. Future research should include deter-\nmining whether other anomalous fat distributions\nor patterning are more relevant to ethnic differences\nin CVD beyond those that are provided by tradition-\nally used anthropometic variables such as BMI and\n"
