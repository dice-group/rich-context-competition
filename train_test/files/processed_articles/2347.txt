    "abstract": "Abstract\nRecent studies suggest that obesity may be ``contagious'' between individuals in social networks. Social contagion\n(influence), however, may not be identifiable using traditional statistical approaches because they cannot distinguish\ncontagion from homophily (the propensity for individuals to select friends who are similar to themselves) or from shared\nenvironmental influences. In this paper, we apply the stochastic actor-based model (SABM) framework developed by\nSnijders and colleagues to data on adolescent body mass index (BMI), screen time, and playing active sports. Our primary\nhypothesis was that social influences on adolescent body size and related behaviors are independent of friend selection.\nEmploying the SABM, we simultaneously modeled network dynamics (friendship selection based on homophily and\nstructural characteristics of the network) and social influence. We focused on the 2 largest schools in the National\nLongitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) and held the school environment constant by examining the 2 school\nnetworks separately (N = 624 and 1151). Results show support in both schools for homophily on BMI, but also for social\ninfluence on BMI. There was no evidence of homophily on screen time in either school, while only one of the schools\nshowed homophily on playing active sports. There was, however, evidence of social influence on screen time in one of the\nschools, and playing active sports in both schools. These results suggest that both homophily and social influence are\nimportant in understanding patterns of adolescent obesity. Intervention efforts should take into consideration peers'\ninfluence on one another, rather than treating ``high risk'' adolescents in isolation.\nCitation: Shoham DA, Tong L, Lamberson PJ, Auchincloss AH, Zhang J, et al.

Recent data\nobese (defined as exceeding the historical 95th percentile of age-\nand sex-specific body mass index (BMI)) [3]. By contrast, the\n10.7% [4]. To reverse the alarming rise in childhood and\nadolescent obesity\n`, researchers have tried many individual-level\nprevention strategies, including educating children on healthy\neating habits, promoting increased physical activity\n`, and restricting\nscreen time. Most interventions, however, have shown, at most,\nmodest benefit. For example, a 2011 Cochrane Review by Waters\nand colleagues showed that interventions aimed at reducing\nobesity in 13-to-18 year old adolescents lowered BMI by an\naverage of 0.09 kg/m2 [5]. The failure of these interventions,\nespecially those targeting individuals, has spurred researchers to\nidentify social and economic influences and suggest novel\npopulation-level interventions [6]. Along these lines, recent studies\nsupport an etiologic role for social networks in the production and\nmaintenance of childhood and adult obesity [7,8,9,10].\nSocial relationships and interactions generally influence behav-\niors and health outcomes [11,12]. We may represent the pattern of\nrelationships between ``social entities'' as a social network; the\nentities might be individuals, collectives (such as households),\ninstitutions, or governments [13]. Social networks are increasingly\nregarded as important determinants of health issues as diverse as\nthe spread of human immunodeficiency virus [14] and the\n``contagion'' of several conditions including obesity [7], smoking\nthe importance of social networks in the diffusion of health-related\ninnovations and behaviors [19]. The specific mechanisms by\nwhich networks influence behavior are poorly understood,\nalthough norms [11,20], peer modeling [21], and social capital\n[22] have all been implicated.\nNotable critiques of the social network ``contagion'' hypothesis\nliteratures. The key issues highlighted by these critiques are a trio\nof potential mechanisms that could account for the observed\n``network contagion'': 1) social influence; 2) confounding by shared\nsocial environments of network members; and 3) social selection or\nhomophily (``love of sameness'') on shared predisposition to engage\nin (un)healthy behaviors. These mechanisms are not identifiable\nusing traditional statistical approaches. This trio has been a\nlongstanding problem in epidemiology and other fields, and is best\narticulated by Manski as the ``reflection problem'', because all\nthree mechanisms can mirror one another [28]. The critique is\nmost sharply articulated by Shalizi and Thomas [26]. Using\ngraphical causal models, they show that those aspects of latent\ntraits that lead to either friendship formation or behavior ``must be\nmade observable... In either case the confounding arcs go away,\nand the direct effect [of peer influence] becomes identifiable''\nSeveral prior studies have employed regression-based approach-\nes to adolescent obesity or BMI using data drawn from the\nNational Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health [24,25,29].\nThese studies all claim to control for confounding by holding\nconstant individual background characteristics that influence\nbehavior. Cohen-Cole and Fletcher offer perhaps the best example\nof a regression-based approach [24] as their model adds controls\nfor environmental confounding using school-specific trends; these\ncontrols alone attenuate the association by over 30%. They further\nextend Christakis and Fowler's model by examining the change in\nBMI following declaration of friendship using individual fixed\neffects (FE). The FE model is appealing because it automatically\nadjusts for all time-invariant background characteristics of\nindividuals, whether or not these characteristics are observed.\nThe stochastic actor-based model (SABM) of Snijders and\ncolleagues provides a means of separating the effects of social\ninfluence and friend selection [30,31]. The SABM simultaneously\nmodels the evolution of social network structure and the behavior\nof individuals in the network. In this paper, we apply the stochastic\nactor-based framework to data on adolescent body size and\nobesity-related behavior. Our primary hypothesis was that social\ninfluences on adolescent body size and obesity-related behavior\nare independent of peer selection when stratified by the school\nenvironment. We predicted that peers exert an influence on one\nanother's BMI, screen time, and playing active sports; these\ninfluences are assumed to be localized in the social network and\nwere operationalized as assimilation (i.e., individual becoming\nmore similar to their friends).\nMethods\nThe Loyola University Chicago Institutional Review Board\napproved these analyses. All subject data were de-identified prior\nto receipt of the data by the investigators, and the study was\ndeemed ``exempt''.\nStudy Population\nData were drawn from the first and second waves of the\nNational Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (hereafter, Add\nHealth). Details of the overall study design, including codebooks,\nmay be found elsewhere [32]. Add Health invited all students at 16\nschools to participate in a detailed survey conducted in the\nstudent's home. Only 2 schools enrolled enough students to permit\nschool-stratified analyses and thus only 2 schools are included in\nthe current study, referred to as ``Jefferson High'' by Bearman [33]\nand ``Sunshine High'' by Moody (unpublished data). Jefferson\nHigh, located in the rural Midwest, is the only public high school\nin the area, which is critical because friendships can only be\nidentified if they are within the school. Jefferson High is primarily\ncomprised of non-Hispanic white students. Sunshine High is in an\nurban environment and has substantial racial and ethnic diversity;\nthis makes it an ideal contrast to the more homogeneous\npopulation of Jefferson High.\nplace 1 year later (Wave 2). Because we are interested in\nlongitudinal changes in the social network, we excluded any\nrespondent not followed in Wave 2, which, for the most part,\nincluded those who were 12th graders in Wave 1. This yielded a\nSunshine High for analysis. The remaining schools in the\nsaturation sample (i.e., those not included in this study) only\nincluded from 19 to 133 students with complete BMI information;\nthey were not included because of their low sample sizes which\nwould have precluded disentangling peer influence from social\nselection. To rule out unmeasured confounders at the school level,\nwe stratified all analyses by school.\nObesity-related Measures\nBody size was assessed by BMI (in kg per meters squared); both\nweight and height were self-reported, as Wave 1 lacked objective\nmeasures of these variables. Although self-reported weight was\nfound to be under-reported in Wave 2 of Add Health, the amount\nwas less than 1 pound for males and less than 2 pounds for females\n[34]. Over one year of followup, there was little transition between\nadiposity categories using CDC sex- and age-specific BMI\ncutpoints at the 85th (overweight) and 95th (obese) percentiles\n[35]. Because only 42 respondents (6.7%) from Jefferson High and\n84 (7.4%) from Sunshine High moved up one or more weight\ncategories, we chose to analyze one-unit changes in BMI as the\nbehavioral outcome. As our modeling approach required behav-\niors to be ordered categories, we recoded BMI as an integer.\nSince BMI is a proxy for adiposity rather than a behavior per se,\nwe selected two behaviors for investigation that have been\nimplicated in childhood obesity: screen time and (not) playing\nactive sports [36]. Screen time was assessed as the sum total of\nhours watching television and/or video recordings plus computer\nor video games in the past week. Implausible values (i.e., above 99\nhours per week; n = 4 in Jefferson High and n = 2 in Sunshine)\nwere re-coded as 99 hours. To aid estimation and interpretation,\nscreen time was divided into 10-hour categories ranging from 0\n(under 10 hours of screen time) to 9 (90 or more hours per week).\nPlaying active sports was measured with the question: ``During the\npast week, how many times did you play an active sport, such as\nbaseball, softball, basketball, soccer, swimming, or football?'' The\nactive sports score was coded as 0 (not at all), 1 (1 or 2 times), 2 (3\nor 4 times), or 3 (5 or more times).\nSocial Network Measures\nAt both waves 1 and 2, all respondents were asked to name up\nto 10 friends, up to 5 male and 5 female. Based on these answers,\nan N by N adjacency matrix for each high school was created, where\nN is the number of students in the network. If student i named\nstudent j as a friend, then the i,j entry in the matrix was a one, and\nall other entries were zero [13]. Thus, each row of the matrix\ncorresponds to a particular student i, called an ``ego,'' and each\nego is surrounded by his or her local ``alters'': other actors in the\nnetwork with their own attributes, network properties, and\nbehaviors, indexed by the subscript j, corresponding to the\ncolumns in the adjacency matrix (these and other key terms used\nthroughout the paper are defined in Table 1). At baseline (Wave\n1), further questions assessed the strength of each named friend;\nSocial Networks and BMI, Screen Time, and Sports\nhowever, this information was not used in the present analysis.\nOnly respondents with network (friendship) data were included in\nthe analysis, as only they may serve as both egos and alters.\nStochastic Actor-based Model (SABM) of Peer Selection\nand Social Influence\nSnijders and colleagues have developed an stochastic actor-\nbased model of the co-evolution of social networks and behaviors\n[30,31], implemented in R as the Simulation Investigation for\nEmpirical Network Analysis (R-SIENA). The model uses rate\nfunctions to assign type of change (network or behavior) for each\nindividual (actor). Two discrete choice functions are fitted\nrecursively: one for network choices (i.e., friendship selection and\ndissolution), and one for changes in behavior (in our case, BMI,\nscreen time, or playing active sports). The outcome is a log-linked\nobjective function of the various actors and network attributes,\nwhich can be likened to the utility of a particular action for each\nactor. Actors are more likely to choose actions that yield larger\nobjective function values. But since the model is stochastic, actors\nmay choose lower values as well (albeit with lower probability).\nThe model parameters are estimated using method-of-moments\n[37]. The initial network, behaviors, and attributes are used as the\nstarting point of the model, which is then simulated for a given set\nof parameters, with the results compared to the observed data.\nThe parameters are then adjusted and the model is re-simulated in\nan iterative cycle to minimize the difference between simulation\nand observation for all actors based on target statistics for those\nattributes. Standard errors are calculated using a score function\nmethod as described in the R-SIENA manual [38].\nSpecification of the SABM Model\nAlthough numerous network and behavior statistics can be\nincluded in the model [30,31]. We included only those statistics\nthat theory or prior research suggested would contribute to a\ncritical network or behavior change. Specifically, we defined X to\nbe the friendship adjacency matrix described above.\nFor the network model, the complete objective function for\nnetwork state x for actor i given covariates y and behavior z is\ndefined as:\nf net\ni\nx,y,z\n\u00f0 \u00de~bdeg\nSjxij\nzbrec\nSjxijxji\nzbttip\nSj,hxihxijxjh\nzbs\nSj\nxij\nI si\n~sj\nzbg\nSj\nxij\nI gi\n~gj\nzbr\nSi\nxij\nI ri\n~rj\nzbe\nSi\nxij\nI ei\n~ej\nzba,sim\nSj\nxij\n(sima,ij\na,average)\nzbc,sim\nSjxij\n(simc,ijc,average)\nzbz,ego\nxij\nzi\nzbz,alt\nxij\nzj\nzbnet\nz,sim\nSjxij\n(simz,ijz,average)\nwhere deg indexes degree (number of ties between ego i and alters\nj), rec indexes reciprocity, ttip indexes transitive triplets, s is sex, g is\ngrade, r is black race, e is Hispanic ethnicity, a is age, c is income,\nand z is the behavior variable in question (BMI, screen time per\nweek, or playing active sports score). The variable xij\nis a dummy\nvariable coded 1 if ego i names alter j as a friend, and 0 otherwise;\nxij\nxji\nis coded 1 if i and j are mutual friends (i.e., it is a reciprocated\ntie). Likewise, xih\nxij\nxjh\nis coded 1 if ego i and alter j both name\nanother person h as a friend, and 0 otherwise.\nThe linear combination of all terms results in a value for\nfi\nnet(x,y,z), the objective function for actor i. We may convert this\nvalue into a probability for a particular action, exponentiating it,\nand then dividing by the sum of all possible exponentiated actions.\nBecause the network objective function is complex in its entirety,\nwe describe each of its components below. Each component of the\nmodel carries a parameter estimate (b), interpreted as the weight\nthe actor places on a particular characteristic of his or her network\nties. We divide these into three categories: structural effects,\nhomophily effects, and behavior effects on the network.\nStructural Effects\n1. Outdegree is defined by the formula bdeg\nSj\nxij\n, where\nSj\nxij\nis the total number of named friends, and bdeg\nis\nthe parameter (weight placed on adding, keeping, or\ndropping a new alter), regardless of that alter's\nTable 1. Key terms used in this paper.\nTerm Definition\nActor a respondent in one of the Add Health saturation schools\nSABM stochastic actor-based model\nEgo the actor whose network and behavior choices are being modeled\nAlter an actor who is named as a friend by the ego\nDegree the total number of alters an ego has named\nReciprocated tie tie for which the alter also names the ego as a friend; synonymous with mutual tie\nTransitive triplets triplet whereby one of the ego's alters names a second of the ego's alters as a friend; ``friend of a friend'' who is named by\nthe ego as a friend\nIdentical attribute indicates that both the ego and the alter have the same attribute value; a measure of homophily for discrete attributes (sex,\ngrade, and race-ethnicity)\nSimilar attribute the standardized absolute difference between the ego's and the alter's attribute; a raw (uncentered) value of 1 indicates\nperfect similarity; used as a measure of homophily for continuous attributes and behaviors\nAverage similarity the value of similar behaviors, averaged across all of the ego's alters; average similarity is used as a measure of peer\ninfluence or assimilation\nPeer influence the effect of alters' behavior on ego's behavior\nSocial influences synonym for peer influence\nSocial Networks and BMI, Screen Time, and Sports\ncharacteristics. Because social actors cannot sustain\nan unlimited number of friendship ties, bdeg\nis always\nnegative.\n2. Reciprocity is the effect of the ego naming a friend\nif the alter has named the ego as a friend, and is\ndefined by the formula brec\nSj\nxij\nxji\n. Since xij\nxji\nonly\ntakes the value 1 if both ego i and alter j name each\nother as friends, Sj\nxij\nxji\nis the total sum of mutual ties.\n3. Transitive triplets is defined as the effect of the\nego i naming alter j's friend h (friend of a friend). The\nformula is bttip\nSj,h\nxih\nxij\nxjh\n, where xih\nxij\nxjh\ntakes the value\n1 if actor i names actor h, actor i names actor j, and\nactor i also names actor h. Thus, the sum over j and h\nis the total number of actors to whom i is tied who\nare also friends with each other.\nHomophily Effects for Actor Attributes\n4. Same sex is the effect of the number of ties the ego\nhas with alters of the same sex, defined as\nbs\nSj\nxij\nI{si\n= sj\n}, where I{si\n= sj\n} takes the value 1 if\nboth i and j are the same sex.\nSj\nxij\nI{gi\n= gj\n}), same black race\n(br\nSi\nxij\nI{ri\n= rj\n}), and same Hispanic ethnicity\n(be\nSi\nxij\nI{ei\n= ej\n}) are defined analogously to same sex.\nBecause of its racial and ethnic homogeneity, same\nrace and same Hispanic ethnicity are omitted from\nthe model for Jefferson High.\n8\u00ad9. Age similarity and income similarity quantify\nhow much weight actors place on choosing friends of\nsimilar age and income. They are calculated using\nthe sum of similarity scores between the ego and his\nor her alters for age, ba,sim\nSj\nxij\n(sima,ij\n\u00ad sima,average\n), and\nfor income, bc,sim\nSj\nxij\n(simc,ij\n\u00ad simc,average\n). We defined\nsimilarity for age (a) between ego i and alter j to be\nsima,ij\n\u00ad aj\n|/(arange\n)], where arange\nis the\ndifference between the largest and smallest value of\nage in the network. The measure for each dyad is\ncentered by subtracting the mean similarity, sima,avg\n,\nfrom the similarity measure for that dyad. Income\nsimilarity is calculated by substituting income for age\nin this formula. Since household income was missing\nfor many respondents (17% in Jefferson, and 39% in\nSunshine), we substituted the mean value for the\nschool for these actors.\nBehavior Effects on Network\n10. Behavior ego is interpreted as extra activity or\nsociability for egos with high values of the behavior\n(BMI, screen time, or active sports). It is calculated as\nxi+\nzi,\nthe outdegree weighted by the value of the\nbehavior.\n11. Behavior alter is interpreted as the attraction of the\nego to alters with high values of the behavior. It is\ncalculated as the sum of the behavioral value over all\nof the ego's alters, Sj\nxij\nzj\n. When the parameter\nestimate for the behavior alter effect is negative, this\nindicates a preference to establish or maintain\nfriendships with alters with low values of the\nbehavior.\n12. Behavior similarity is the statistic for homophily\non behavior. It is calculated as the centered sum of\nsimilarity scores between the actor and all of his or\nher alters, Sj\nxij\n(simz,ij\n\u00ad simz,avg\n), using the same\ngeneral formula employed for age and income\nsimilarity. Actors are assumed to prefer alters who\nare most similar to themselves with regard to\nbehavior (BMI, screen time, and active sports).\nBehavior Objective Function\nFor the behavior model, the complete objective function for\nnetwork state x for actor i given covariates y and behavior z is\ndefined as:\nfi\nbeh z,x\n\u00f0 \u00de ~ blin\n(zi\n{ zavg\n) z bquad\nzi\n{ zavg\nz bbeh\n\u00bdSjxij simz,ij simz,avg\n=Sjxij\n\nThere are three parameters for the behavioral model: linear and\nquadratic ``shape'' parameters and the average similarity effect.\n-zavg\n) and quadratic shape\n(zi\n-zavg\n)2 effects are both centered by subtracting the\nmean value of the behavior (zavg\n). The linear shape\nparameter (blin\n) may be likened to the ``tracking'' of a\nbehavior over time. Subjects who are already higher\nthan average on the behavior are likely to increase it,\nwhile subjects who are lower are less likely to do so.\nThe quadratic shape effect allows for non-linearity in\nthis association, whereby extreme values at one time\npoint may lead to even more extreme values at a\nfuture time point. Snijders and colleagues argue that\na positive and significant value for the quadratic\nshape parameter bquad\nindicates addictive behavior\n15. Behavior average similarity is defined as\nSj\nxij\n(simz,ij\n\u00ad simz,avg\n)/Sj\nxij\n. The focus of our analysis\nis on this effect, as it represents behavioral social\ninfluence or assimilation. If the parameter bbeh\nmakes\na meaningful contribution to the behavior objective\nfunction, then it indicates that egos whose behavior\ndiffers from that of their peers assimilate to their\npeers by increasing or decreasing the behavior. With\nBMI, this may indicate a conscious decision to lose\nweight in order to fit in with lean friends, or an\nunconscious choice of unhealthy foods based on\nimitating peer behavior.\nNote that SIENA requires separate models for each investigated\nbehavior. To rule out unmeasured confounders at the school level,\nand since schools define the boundaries of the social networks, we\nstratified all analyses by school. Because there are two schools\n(Jefferson and Sunshine) and three behaviors examined (BMI,\nscreen time, and playing active sports), a total of 6 models were\nrun.\nResults\nDescriptive Statistics\nThe characteristics of students in the two schools are listed in\nTable 2. Respondents in each school were similar on age, percent\nmale, and playing active sports. Average household income was\n$11,500 higher in Jefferson High than Sunshine. Both BMI\nSocial Networks and BMI, Screen Time, and Sports\n(1.7 kg/m2) and screen time (3.5 hours/week) were higher in\nSunshine High than Jefferson and Jefferson High respondents\nreported more friendships (3.5 vs. 1.8 per student) resulting in a\nstudents. There were also a greater number of average recipro-\ncated ties (mutual friendships) and transitive triplets (the friend of\nan alter's friend is also the ego's friend) in Jefferson compared to\nSunshine. The similarity measures are centered by the overall\naverage in the network, and thus are close to zero.\nNetwork Objective Function\nParameters for the network objective function that were\ncommon to all models were robust to the inclusion of different\nbehavioral attributes; that is, network structural parameters\n(degree, reciprocity, transitive triplets, and homophily on sex,\ngrade, black race, Hispanic ethnicity, age, and income) are not\nconfounded by behavioral attributes of actors, and did not change\nappreciably across models. Table 3 shows network structural\ncharacteristics:. all but one of the parameter estimates in this table\nmake meaningful contributions to the objective function for\nadding or deleting a network tie: income similarity in Jefferson\nHigh which was close to zero with a wide confidence interval. The\nestimates may be likened to the weight that each individual places\nupon network and alter attributes in deciding to add or drop a\nfriendship tie or to keep his or her personal network as it is. Out-\ndegree is strongly negative, reflecting the disinclination to form ties\nwith random alters. Reciprocity, however, is strongly positive,\nindicating that an ego is highly inclined to form or keep friendship\nties with alters who have named the ego as a friend. The values for\nsex, grade, black race, Hispanic ethnicity, age, and income\nquantify the weight placed on homophily for these attributes.\nParameters for the network objective function change across\nmodels when we examine different behaviors (Table 4). These\ndifferences arise from each behavior having its own distribution,\nand actors giving the behaviors different weights. The attractiveness\nmeasures represent the weight egos place on alters' behavior;\npositive measures indicate that egos prefer alters who are above\naverage on the behavior, while negative measures indicate a\npreference for those below the mean on those behaviors. Positive\nsociability (called ``activity'' by Snijders et al. [30]) measures indicate\nthat egos are more likely to form ties if they have above-average\nvalues of the behavior. Finally, similarity measures indicate a\npreference for alters who have values that are similar to the ego's\nvalues on the behavioral attribute. In both Jefferson High and\nSunshine High, we found evidence of homophily on BMI, with a\nschools, high BMI students chose friends who were similarly high\nin BMI, while lean students chose lean friends. Ego's BMI also\nmade a small contribution to sociability; all things being equal,\nstudents with high BMI named more friends than those who are\nlow on BMI. Sensitivity analyses, including additional controls for\nscreen time similarity and playing active sports similarity, did not\nmeaningfully change these results.\nJefferson High showed evidence of homophily on active sports.\nRespondents who reported playing active sports more often were\nTable 2.

Higher values\nindicate more network changes.\n3The outdegree parameter is the weight placed on having a friendship tie with\nany member of the social network, irrespective of the alter's characteristics.\n4The reciprocity parameter is the weight an actor places on reciprocating alters'\nfriendship nominations.\n5The transitive triplets parameter is the weight an actor places on naming\nfriends who are also named by the actor's friend.\n6Positive values of ``same'' and ``similarity'' measures are the effects of\nhomophily on these attributes.\nSocial Networks and BMI, Screen Time, and Sports\nmore likely to choose others who also played more often, perhaps\nbecause they chose friends who played the same sports. We note\nthat when all forms of physical activity (active sports, exercising,\nand rollerblading or bike riding) were combined to create a\nsummary score, neither school showed evidence of homophily\n(results not shown). Playing active sports, however, did not appear\nto be a basis for friendship selection in Sunshine High; this may\nhave been due to the lower density of that network. Against our\nprediction, screen time did not appear to affect the actors' choice\nof friends in either school.\nTo illustrate how the network objective function is calculated,\nconsider a respondent from Jefferson High who is male, 17 years\nold, in grade 11, and with a BMI of 25 (we do not include income\nsimilarity or attractiveness of alter's BMI here because the\nparameter estimates make ignorable contributions to the objective\nfunction). The student has 2 friends, one of whom reciprocates,\nand one who does not; the alters are male, both in grade 11, and\nboth with a BMI of 25. The alters are not friends with each other.\nThe network objective function for this student's current network\nis a linear combination of parameters for outdegree (23.56),\nsimilarity (0.54). Similarity scores are calculated as described\nabove, yielding the following formula:\n\u00f0 \u00de\n\u00f0 \u00de\nSuppose this student is contemplating dropping his male friend\nwho has not reciprocated, or adding a third male friend who is\nobese (i.e., has a BMI of 30), but who has named the ego as a\nfriend, thus creating a reciprocated friendship tie. This third male\nstudent is also 17 and in grade 11. We may calculate the predicted\nprobability of dropping, adding, or keeping the same ties for any\nindividual in the network by exponentiating the value of the\nobjective function for a particular scenario, and dividing it by the\nsum of the exponentiated objective values for all possible scenarios.\nIf our network contained only the four individuals described here,\nthe ego could make four possible choices: keep the same network;\ndrop one of the 2 existing ties; or add the tie that is not present.\nThe exponentiated values of these four choices, and the\nprobability of each, would be:\n3.

We found evidence of peer influence (social modeling\nor assimilation) for BMI and playing active sports in both Jefferson\nand Sunshine High, and for screen time in Jefferson High.\nTable 4.

Positive values indicate a preference for alters whose values are similar to the ego's.\nSocial Networks and BMI, Screen Time, and Sports\nEvidence of Peer Influence on BMI\nThe BMI average similarity score for Jefferson High was 14.10\nmatch the average BMI of their friends; if their BMIs are higher\nthan their friends, this will tend to pull their BMI down; if they are\nlower than their friends, it will pull their BMI up. While this\nparameter estimate seems high, it must be viewed in the context of\nThus, at the 25th percentile value, the contribution of average\nsimilarity value for Sunshine High was similar, at 10.57 (95% CI:\nthe behavior objective function for sex, ethnicity, race, age,\nincome, body weight image, trying to lose weight, and trying to\ngain weight, did not meaningfully change these parameter\nestimates (results not shown).\nThe behavior objective function is simpler than the network\nfunction because there are only three choices that an actor can\nmake: stay the same; move up one unit; or move down one unit.\nThe larger the value is of the objective function, the greater the\nprobability of the choice made, and it will depend both on the\nego's BMI and the average similarity with his or her alters. Ego's\ncurrent BMI influences future BMI, as indicated by the ``linear\nshape'' and ``quadratic shape'' parameters. As current BMI values\nincrease, there is a greater tendency to increase BMI between time\nsteps; that is, more emphasis is placed upon increasing BMI than\ndecreasing it. Translating the behavior objective function into\nprobabilities is done in an analogous fashion to the calculation for\nnetwork changes. We exponentiate the value of the objective\nfunction for a particular BMI state, and then divide it by the sum\nof the exponentiated objective function values for all three\nscenarios (move down one unit, stay same, or move up one unit).\nTo illustrate, consider a student in Jefferson High whose BMI is\n23, close to the mean value (22.6). We can assume the student is\nmale; while sex is not a part of the behavior objective function, it is\na determinant of the student's friends. If the actor has no friends,\nthen only the linear and quadratic shape will drive the objective\nfunction values of his 3 choices:\nThe most probable scenario is that the actor will increase his\nBMI by one unit, but the other two scenarios are nearly as likely.\nNow consider a situation where this same ego has 2 friends,\neach with the identical BMI of 30 kg/m2. The centered average\nsimilarity value between this ego and his friends is thus:\nSimi,j\nWere he to move up one unit in BMI, the centered similarity\nmeasure would become larger (0.047); were he to move down one\nunit, similarity would become smaller (20.107). These measures\nthen figure into the objective function, and each ``move'' in BMI\ncan be assigned a probability:\nIt is more likely than not that this subject will increase his BMI.\nThe converse, however, is not true: going down in BMI when\nalters are lower on BMI is much less likely than gaining body mass\nwhen the alters are higher. If the scenario were reversed, with the\nego's BMI beginning at 30 and the alters' at 23, the probability of\ndecreasing BMI is 0.351, while the probability of increasing BMI is\n0.319. Table 6 shows the probability of increasing, decreasing, or\nremaining at the same BMI for various combinations of egos' BMI\nand average similarity with alters' BMI. The table shows that egos\nwho have alters with higher BMI will be more likely to be pulled in\nthe alters' direction, while egos with leaner alters do not necessarily\nhave higher probabilities of moving down.\nTable 5. Network influence on behavior, parameters and (95% confidence intervals).\nJefferson High Sunshine High\nBehavioral change parameters are adjusted for network structural parameters (Table 3 and 4).\nLinear and quadratic shape parameters are the effects of the ego's own behavior (linear) and behavior-squared (quadratic) on his or her future behavior. The ``average\nsimilarity'' parameters represent social influence of the alters' on the ego.\nSocial Networks and BMI, Screen Time, and Sports\nPredicted Behavior on Screen Time and Playing Active\nSports\nSimilar calculations can be made for peer influence in Jefferson\nHigh on screen time (Table 7) and playing an active sport\n(Table 8). Results (Table 7) show that egos with low values of\nscreen time are unlikely to increase their screen time if their alters\nare similar in screen time. Egos who are high on screen time are\nlikely to remain high or increase their screen time if their alters\nspend much time in front of the TV or computer. Because of the\nnegative linear and positive quadratic shape contributions to the\nobjective function, egos in the middle are more likely to be\ninfluenced by extremes of peer behavior: egos with a screen time of\n30\u00ad39 hours per week are most likely to reduce their screen time if\ntheir alters are low on screen time (10\u00ad19 hours/week) (probability\nof decrease = 0.61), whereas egos who are medium-high viewers at\n60\u00ad69 hours/week are most likely to increase time if their average\nA similar pattern is noted for playing active sports (Table 8).\nEgos who played an active sport once or twice in the past week at\nWave 1 had a 75% predicted probability of decreasing their\nplaying sports if their average alter did not play any sports. On the\nother hand, egos who played sports 3\u00ad4 times a week at baseline\nhad a 62% probability of increasing their playing sports if their\naverage alter played 5 or more times.\nDiscussion\nOur model's primary strength is that we explicitly model both\nthe processes of friendship formation and social influence. Our\nresults add to a growing body of evidence demonstrating clustering\nTable 6.

While\nshowing that BMI and behaviors cluster is consistent with a causal\nstory that friends influence one another (or that obesity spreads\nthrough social networks), GEE models offer little support of such a\ncausal claim. The crux of the problem lies in the potential for\nconfounding by shared environments and homophily [26], or the\ntendency of similar individuals to form friendships as in the adage\n``birds of a feather flock together'' [39]. Controls for shared\nenvironments can be introduced using traditional methods, such as\nadjusting for neighborhood characteristics or including controls for\nfixed effects, as done by Cohen-Cole and Fletcher [24].\nHomophily is more difficult to control for, since it may be based\nnot only on the behavior in question (which is observed), but also\non unobserved (latent) tendencies for friendship formation (e.g., a\nshared propensity for the behavior, which may itself be due to\nrace, sex, or other characteristic). Unless the shared propensity\ntoward both the behavior and the friendship is controlled for, we\ncannot progress beyond merely documenting a correlation of\nbehavior between friends.\nWe found that a number of well-known bases for homophily\noperate in the Add Health friendship network, including sex, age,\ngrade, race-ethnicity, and income [39]. Our findings are also\nconsistent with two works by de la Haye [9,40] and one by\nO'Malley [41] that findevidence for homophily on body size using\nSABM, exponential random graph and tie prediction models.\nWhile we found evidence that homophily matters for BMI and for\nplaying active sports, we found no evidence for homophily on\nscreen time. Because the model allows for homophily in friendship\nretention and in dropping ties, results should be robust to the\n``unfriending problem'' described by Noel and Nyhan [42]. After\naccounting for these many sources of homophily (age, race-\nethnicity, income, sex, and grade), we found evidence of social\ninfluence for BMI, screen time, and playing active sports. These\nresults contrast with de la Haye and colleagues' SABM analysis\n[40], which did not find any evidence of peer influence on BMI\nonce homophily and other structural factors were taken into\naccount. These differing results may be due to their study's smaller\nsample size (N = 156), the Australian setting, or a different\nspecification of the influence parameter (alter's BMI, rather than\nsimilarity between ego's and alters' BMI, as in our model).\nOur model further extends prior work by specifically examining\nbehaviors implicated in the epidemic of childhood obesity. The\nmodel is based on observations of respondents from two large high\nschools that are quite different, yet the results show substantively\nsimilar evidence of peer influence on BMI and playing active\nsports. Estimates of social influence in the two schools are not\ndirectly comparable, because these measures depend upon such\nfactors as the average behavioral values and ranges for the school\nand the density of network ties. For example, effects for influence\nmay have been smaller in Sunshine High due to the sparseness of\nits in-school social network, as reflected in the lower average out-\ndegree (1.8, vs. 3.5 in Jefferson High). Differences in the built\nenvironment between the two schools may also have contributed\nto heterogeneity of effects [43]. Because we stratified the analyses\nto respondents within two schools, the school environment cannot\nbe a confounder. Stratification further allowed us to demonstrate\ninternal validity, as qualitatively similar results for peer influence\non BMI and playing active sports were obtained in both schools.\nOur model also addresses a major limitation of regression-based\napproaches. As noted by Salizi and Thomas, peer influence effect\ncan only be identified if the mechanism for friendship formation\ncan be specified, measured, and included in the model [26]. Our\nmodel does provide such specification for friendship selection,\nbased on reciprocity, transitivity, and homophily on several\ncharacteristics, including the behavior in question (BMI, screen\ntime, and playing active sports). Our modeling framework also\ncaptures feedback between selection and influence processes. For\nexample, large weight gain may be stigmatizing and lead to social\nisolation [44], in which case the beneficial effect of having (leaner)\nfriends would be missed. Alternatively, obese adolescents might\nform and maintain friendships only with other obese adolescents; if\nsocial influence is present, then the two processes would be\nTable 8.

Egos may increase by one level,\ndecrease by one level, or stay at the same level.\nSocial Networks and BMI, Screen Time, and Sports\nreinforcing. Regression models, which assume individual observa-\ntions to be independent, cannot handle this type of complexity.\nThere are several limitations to our study. First, we rely on self-\nreported BMI, screen time, and frequency of playing active sports.\nSelf-reported BMI is known to suffer from cross-sectional\nmisclassification bias based on sex, age, and race-ethnicity\n[45,46]. However, because sex and race-ethnicity are constant\nacross waves and age only differs by one year, change in BMI might\nbe underreported but should not otherwise be biased. Field and\ncolleagues found that while obese males and females underreport-\ned weight by the largest margin, weight change showed relatively\nlittle bias (underreported by 1.7 pounds in males, and over-\nreported by 0.3 pounds in females) [34]. Likewise, screen time may\nbe underreported and playing sports over-reported, but these\nbiases should be consistent across waves.\nA second is our use of observational data. There is no feasible\nmechanism for randomly assigning friendships, which would be\nthe most satisfying means of removing homophily as a competing\nexplanation, although some forms of dyadic relationship may be\nassigned. In a ``natural experiment'' of the random assignment of\ncollege freshmen roommates, researchers found that obese women\nnegatively influence weight gain in their roommates, perhaps\nthrough eating behavior [47]. Nevertheless, roommates are not\nnecessarily friends, and the results of this study cannot be directly\ncompared to the current results. Another approach would involve\nthe random assignment of obesity status to one node of a dyad.\nThe only ``natural experiment'' we can identify, however, is a\nstudy by Woodard and colleagues of weight loss following a\nspouse's bariatric surgery [48]. Because of the observational nature\nof our data, we lacked some measures that may have confounded\nthe findings of peer influence. In particular, we did not have a\nmeasure of Tanner stage. Physical maturation is an important\ncontributor to individual BMI trajectories and physical activity\n[49], and it is plausible that more developed adolescents were both\nmore likely to be friends and also more likely to increase BMI.\nA further limitation is that the SABM model is designed for\ndiscrete behaviors, such as smoking and alcohol consumption\n[30,31]. On the behavior side, the SABM requires that increases\nor decreases occur in single unit quanta, and is unable to handle\ncontinuous behavioral outcomes. In addition, SABM was designed\nfor small networks (up to a few hundred actors). In small networks,\neach actor has the opportunity to form ties with all other actors\n[30], an assumption that is unlikely to hold in our analyses.\nRunning analyses on such large networks was computationally\nintensive: each model took several hours on an 8-core machine to\ncomplete. Finally, SIENA can only model one behavior at a time,\nprecluding simultaneous modeling of peer influence on BMI,\nscreen time, and playing active sports. In future studies, we hope to\naddress some of these limitations by extending the SABM\nframework to handle continuous behavior measures in large\nnetworks with greater computational efficiency. For the present\ntime, however, the implementation in R-SIENA is the only means\ncapable of teasing apart network dynamics and social influence.\nIn conclusion, we found support for social influence on obesity-\nrelated measures and behaviors that is independent of homophily\nor confounding by shared school environment. Nevertheless,\nhomophily on BMI and playing sports cannot be ignored. We will\nuse these model results to parameterize an agent-based model of\npeer influence and selection processes. In the absence of direct\nexperimentation (such as the natural experiments described\nearlier), it remains unclear how social networks can be harnessed\nto promote health or prevent obesity. Regardless, evidence on the\nimportance of social networks continues to accumulate. For\nintervention purposes, networks may provide an explanation for\nwhy ``high-risk'' approaches that focus only on obese individuals\nqua individuals are prone to fail [50]. Networks may also offer\ninsight into what Sterman terms ``policy resistance, [which] arises\nwhen we do not understand the full range of feedbacks\nsurrounding... our decisions'' ([51] p.507). Our model shows that\nsocial influence tends to operate more in detrimental directions,\nespecially for BMI; a focus on weight loss is therefore less likely to\nbe effective than a primary prevention strategy against weight\ngain. Effective interventions will be necessary to overcome these\nbarriers, requiring that social networks be considered rather than\nignored.\n"
