    "abstract": "Abstract\nStudies on Emotional Intelligence (EI) have demonstrated the concept's potential in accounting for a broad range of health-\nrelated outcomes. Preliminary evidence associates measures of EI with disordered eating and other related behaviors. This\nstudy proposed a mediation effect of perceived control in the above association. We hypothesized that (a) EI will positively\nassociate with perceived control and (b) perceived control will associate positively with Anorexia and negatively with Bulimia\nsymptomatology. One hundred and thirty young adults residing in Israel filled out measures assessing Anorexia (drive for\nthinness), Bulimia, perceived control, and EI (two measures). The results lent only partial support to the hypotheses: EI showed\na nonlinear association with control, which in turn showed nonlinear association with Anorexia scores, and contrary to our\nhypothesis, positive association with Bulimia scores. A Sobel test supported the mediation models for both eating disorder\nmeasures. The results are discussed and future research is proposed to further examine this hypothesized mechanism.\n",

These conditions pose serious\nphysical health threats as the emotional and psychological\nconsequences of these behaviors undermine the individual's\nwell-being (e.g., Stice & Shaw, 2004). Clinically diagnosed\nEDs are traditionally categorized roughly into three types: (a)\nAnorexia Nervosa (AN), a family of disorders sharing a com-\nponent of excessive control and limitation of food intake, (b)\nBulimia nervosa (BN), a family of disorders typically charac-\nterized by binging and compensatory behaviors (purging,\nlaxative abuse, vigorous physical activity) and (c) EDs not\notherwise specified (NOS; Allen & Dalton, 2011). EDs afflict\nup to 5% of the general population in the U.S. and similar\nproportions of the Israeli population (assessed at 6%-8%),\nwhere the current study is set (Worgaft, 2011).\nThe scientific study of EDs is a relatively new field, gain-\ning momentum in the 1960s, and revealing alarming spread\nand increasing prevalence of the phenomenon (Hudson,\nOften considered a teenager condition, research now pro-\nvides worrying evidence suggesting EDs can be a lifelong\nburden and afflict persons of all ages (Collier & Treasure,\n2004). Moreover, recent surveys show most EDs, especially\nAnorexia and Bulimia (in all of their versions and types), can\nbe seen more as a continuum of behavioral patterns rather\nthan a specific pathological condition (Fairburn & Bohn,\ntoward ED can express itself in a very broad range of man-\nners, from exaggerated worries or thoughts about food and\nfood consumption, all the way to clinically diagnosed and\nlife-threatening EDs. This means that beyond diagnosed\nindividuals, many more suffer patterns and symptoms caus-\ning psychological and physical distress, and are potentially at\nrisk, without being diagnosed or properly attended to.\nStudies have concentrated on identifying correlates and\nrisk factors of EDs. Gender and age are the most prevalent\nfactors associated with disordered eating: EDs are dramati-\ncally more prevalent among women. Puberty and adoles-\ncence are the life periods most often associated with the\nSocial norms promoting thinness and their expression in the\nmedia and youth culture were also frequently associated with\nhigher incidence of EDs or disordered eating (Harrison &\nPersonality traits and other personal characteristics have\nalso been associated with proneness to EDs: Fragile self-\nesteem and distorted self-image, neuroticism, perfectionism,\nand one of its correlates, perceived control, have been often\n1Tel Hai College, Israel\n2University of Haifa, Israel\nCorresponding Author:\nEmail: leehu@telhai.ac.il\nEmotional Intelligence, Perceived\nControl, and Eating Disorders\nLeehu Zysberg1 and Einav Tell2\n Keywords\nemotional intelligence, eating disorders, Anorexia, Bulimia, perceived control, student sample\n2 SAGE Open\nassociated with patterns of disordered eating (Cervera et al.,\nhigh levels of control are associated with Anorexia, leading\nrestrictive eating behaviors as inefficient expression of self-\ncontrol and at times--control of others (e.g., Jarman, Smith,\n& Walsh, 1997). Additional evidence also link low levels of\ncontrol to Bulimia/binge eating patterns: Emotional and\nsocial pressures express themselves in uncontrolled eating\nbehavior, again--in an inadequate attempt to keep emotions\nA relatively new concept relating to emotional function\nintroduced into the study of EDs is that of Emotional\nIntelligence (EI). One prevalent conceptualization of EI\ndescribes it as a group of abilities allowing individuals to\nidentify, process, and integrate emotion in reasoning. It also\nrefers to individual's ability to effectively manage and regu-\nlate their emotional responses (Mayer, Roberts, & Barsade,\nillustrates a link between EI and emotional regulation and\ncoping, but does EI offers added value in accounting for EDs\nbeyond regulation? Only a few studies dealt with the role of\nEI in disordered eating and EDs, revealing the potential con-\ntribution of the concept on the theoretical and practical levels\nRubanov, 2010). These studies however did not provide evi-\ndence to the process by which EI may be related to EDs and\ndisordered eating.\nThe current study sought to further examine the role of EI\nin ED symptomatology by first moving from the discussion\nof EI and \"disordered eating\" or \"emotional eating\" to spe-\ncific ED symptomatology and by proposing a mediation\nmechanism: We propose that perceived sense of control\nmediates the association between EI and ED symptomatol-\nogy. As EI represents among others, the ability to identify\nand regulate one's emotional responses and as emotional\nregulation plays a major role in ED symptomatology we\nhypothesized that (a) EI will be positively associated with\nperceived control and (b) perceived control will show a dif-\nferential association with ED measures, more specifically,\n(b1) perceived control will positively associate with ten-\ndency toward Anorexia, and (b2) perceived control will neg-\natively associate with tendency toward Bulimia.\nWe tested our hypotheses in a sample of Israeli young\nadults in an attempt to not only look at clinically diagnosed\ngroups but also observe behaviors ranging from normative to\nsevere EDs and their associations with our variables of\ninterest.\nMethod\nThis study used a correlational design to examine the poten-\ntial associations between the two EI measures, a measure of\nperceived control and measures of tendency towardAnorexia\nand Bulimia.\nSample\nOne hundred and thirty young adults living in Israel (ages =\nwomen were recruited through online websites and social\nnetworks. Participants were excluded from the study if they\nhad any health condition that influences appetite, or require\nmedication that alters appetite or food consumption. The\nsample size was determined using G-power (Erdfelder, Faul,\nset at .05, considering the number of main variables in the\nmodel.\nMeasures\nTendency for ED was assessed using the Eating Disorder\nInventory II (EDI II; Garner, 1991). This is a self-report\n91-item questionnaire assessing behavioral and cognitive\npatterns associated with EDs. The original measure produces\n11 subscales, but in this study, only the subscales concerning\ndrive for thinness representing Anorexia, and Bulimia were\nincluded in our preliminary analysis. These scales show\nacceptable reliability and construct validity in previous stud-\nies, as well as in studies which translated the measure into\nHebrew (Garner, 1991; Niv, Kaplan, Mitrani, & Shiang,\n1998). In the current study, Cronbach's alpha was .90 for the\nAnorexia scale and .83 for the Bulimia scale. The scale is\nranked on a scale from 1 to 6 to denote increasing agreement\nwith statements.\nPerceived Control was assessed using the Perceived\nControl Scale (Hobfoll & Walfish, 1984), a 7-item question-\nnaire based on the work of Pearlin and Schooler (1978). This\nscale assesses the extent to which people feel they are in con-\ntrol over events in their life. A 7-point Likert-type scale\nallows participants to mark their level of agreement with\neach statement. The scale has established evidence of reli-\nability and validity. In the current study, its Cronbach's alpha\nEI was assessed using two separate measures, represent-\ning two approaches to the concept: a test approach (where\nparticipants are presented with problems they need to answer\ncorrectly) and a self-report approach (where participants\nreport their behaviors and perceptions).\nThe Audio-Visual Test of Emotional Intelligence (AVEI) is\na 27-item computer-based test of EI following the ability\napproach to EI (Zysberg, Levy, & Zisberg, 2011). Participants\nare presented with still and video captures in which they are\nasked to identify the emotion experienced by a target person.\nThe test has shown adequate reliability, and criterion-related\nvalidity in previous studies (e.g., Zysberg, 2013; Zysberg\nThe Schutte Emotional Intelligence Scale (SEIS) is a\n33-item self-report measure of EI, designed within the ability\napproach to EI. It has shown evidence of good reliability and\nis common in current studies on EI (Schutte et al., 2001;\nZysberg and Tell 3\nSchutte et al., 1998; Schutte, Malouf, Thorsteinsson, Bhullar,\n& Rooke, 2007). In the current study, Cronbach's alpha coef-\nDemographic information regarding gender, age, and\nadditional background variables was collected using a short\ndemographic questionnaire designed for this study.\nProcedure\nThe study was approved by the Institutional review board\n(IRB) of the authors' academic institution. Participants were\napproached online in various social media targeting young\nadults. The researchers presented the study as one focusing\non \"eating-related habits and thoughts.\" Online completion\nof the questionnaire packet took about 40 min according to\nsome of the participants' reports. One of the authors was\navailable via email in case questions or issues were raised by\nparticipants. The online administration system allowed only\nparticipants who fully completed the procedure to submit\ntheir data, so there were no missing values in the database;\nhowever, the system did not keep record of participants drop-\nping out during the procedure.\nData Analysis\nThe lack of a substantial body of evidence regarding the\nassociation between EI and our focal variables led us to use\na series of regressions fitting various models (linear and non-\nlinear) to our data and compare the coefficients to identify\nthe models offering most explained variance. We also tested\nfor mediation using Sobel's test (Sobel, 1982) to account for\nthe general model proposed in this study.\nResults\nDescriptive Statistics\nWe first examined the distributions of the main variables in\nour study. Table 1 summarizes central tendency and disper-\nsion indices for the main variables, as well as simple\nPearson's correlations between them.\nThe statistics suggest a proper distribution of the study\nvariables, well within their reported range in the literature.\nThe preliminary associations found between the variables\nonly partially supported our hypotheses: Only one of the\nmeasures of EI associated positively with control. The same\nmeasure also showed a moderate positive association with\nAnorexia score. Control associated positively with Anorexia\nand Bulimia scores.\nHypothesis Testing\nWe used a series of regression and curve estimation analyses.\nTo reduce the effects of capitalization of chance, we used a\nsignificancelevelof.03determinedaccordingtoBonferroni's\nformula (e.g., Abdi, 2007). We first examined the associa-\ntions between the two measures of EI with perceived control,\nwhile controlling for age and gender (both demographics\nassociated with EDs). In a linear regression analysis, both EI\nmeasures showed significant positive association with self-\nremained nonsignificant. We then continued to fit two mod-\nels of regression: linear versus quadratic, using both the\nabove measures of EI as factors and control as the dependent\nvariable. For both EI factors, the quadratic model showed\nbetter fit indices suggesting a \"U\"-shaped association\nbetween EI and perceived control, for AVEI,   = .26; F =\np < .001. This deviated from our original hypothesis, and\nmay suggest the association between EI and control is non-\nlinear. For a graphic representation of the curve-fit results,\nsee Figure 1.\nWe then examined the associations between perceived\ncontrol and Anorexia and Bulimia symptom scores using a\ncurve estimation analyses to compare two models: linear\nversus quadratic. According to our hypothesis, we expected\nthe quadratic association to show better fit to our data. The\nresults of the analyses conducted separately for Anorexia and\nBulimia scores are presented in Figures 2 and 3.\nThe results provide only partial support to our hypothesis:\nThe association between perceived control and Anorexia\nscores fitted our hypothesis but further examination of the\nassociation pattern revealed a nonlinear relationship we did\nnot hypothesize about. Bulimia scores however associated\nTable 1. Descriptive Statistics and Intercorrelations for the Main Study Variables (N = 130).\nMinimum-Maximum M (SD) Anorexia Bulimia Control AVEI SEIS\nNote.

Second, we proposed a\nmediation model in which self-perceived control may\naccount for associations between EI and ED. Control is a\nknown psychological component in EDs etiology (e.g.,\nalso positively associated with EI, a concept revolving\naround effective management and regulation of emo-\ntional reactions (Johnson, Batey, & Holdsworth, 2009;\nSalovey, Hsee, & Mayer, 1993). Results from a sample of\n130 Israeli young adults, demonstrating a range of ED\nsymptomatology (normative to disordered) supported a\nmediating model, though only partially congruent with\nour original model. Perceived control mediated the asso-\nciations between EI and ED scores for Anorexia and\nBulimia.\nContrary to our original hypothesis, which proposed a\npositive linear association between EI and perceived con-\ntrol, we found (despite a significant moderate linear asso-\nciation) that a quadratic model showed better fit to the data.\nIn other words: higher levels of perceived control were\nassociated with either low or high EI. This may reflect a\nmore complex manner in which EI is associated with per-\nception and sense of control. We propose that people with\nlower EI's report of perceived control could be reflecting a\ndifferent essence than that reported by people with higher\nEI (e.g., false sense of control vs. perceived control based\non more accurate self-perception?). Additional research is\nrequired, however, to test such a proposal. Perceived con-\ntrol, in turn, showed a nonlinear association with Anorexia\nscores where moderate levels of control were associated\nwith lower Anorexia, while lower or higher control corre-\nsponded with higher Anorexia scores. For Bulimia we\nfound a positive linear association with perceived control, a\ndeviation from our hypothesis. This finding is also a devia-\ntion from the trend reported in the literature associating\nbulimic behavior with lack of control (e.g., Colles, Dixon,\n& O'brien, 2012). These results may be accounted for by\nthe nature of our sample that included individuals repre-\nsenting the full range of eating behaviors. The proposed\nsimple associations between control and ED symptomatol-\nogy is often based on comparison of clinically diagnosed\nsamples with normative sample, ignoring the potential\nrange of behaviors spreading across the full spectrum of\neating behaviors (e.g., Dalgleish et al., 2001). Our results\nsuggest that the association may be more complex than that\nproposed in the classic literature (e.g., Sim & Ziman, 2006;\nWaller, 1998). Such a suggestion should be treated cau-\ntiously until future studies provide more support or refute\nit. The notion of control and the way it is assessed vis-\u00e0-vis\nthe tendency toward EDs often varies across studies, posing\na methodological hurdle to generalization regarding this\nassociation.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical\nattempt to support an explanatory model of EI's involve-\nment in EDs. Some limitations, however, should be con-\nsidered when interpreting our results: Our sample was\ntaken from a functional, nonclinical population. Though\nwe did find a good range of our outcome measures in the\ndata collected, future studies may look into the nature of\nthese associations in clinically diagnosed and treated sam-\nples. Our results suggest that essential differences may\nexist in the dynamics of personal factors associated with\nbehaviors on the EDs range in clinical and nonclinical\nsamples. Additional studies may wish to adopt a compara-\ntive approach to this question. The use of an Israeli sample\nmay raise future questions regarding culture and other\npopulation-related variables involved in our results. Again,\nfuture studies may look at these variables in various cul-\ntural settings. Last, the use of a correlational design limits\nour ability to discuss causation in our results. Experimental\ndesigns may be used in future research attempts along\nthese lines to strengthen our model's causal and potentially\npredictive nature.\nThe above limitations acknowledged, this study points in\na direction providing promising yet challenging preliminary\nevidence to the associations between EI, perceived control,\nand EDs. Should future research support it, such a model can\nbe of use in our theoretical understanding of the nature of EI\nand its associations with various eating-related behaviors.\nAn additional benefit of this proposed model is the potential\nfor guiding future screening, and intervention with individu-\nals suffering from EDs.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\n6 SAGE Open\nAppendix\nModel Representations of the Mediation Effect\nof Control in the Association Between Emotional\nIntelligence and Tendency Toward Eating Disorder\nReferences\nAbdi, H.
