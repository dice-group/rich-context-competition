Children under 10 y were\nassisted by parents.\nRESULTS: Approximately 84% of Chinese youth actively commute to school for a median of 100\u00ad150 min/week. A total of\n72% engage in in-school moderate/vigorous (MOD/VIG) PA for a median of 90\u00ad110 min/week. Relatively few children (E8%)\nparticipate in any MOD/VIG PA outside of school. A total of 72% engage in study-related activities outside of school for a median\nof 420 min/week. Only 8% of Chinese school children, regardless of gender, watch television Z2 h/day; less than 1% watch\nZ4 h/day. Chores related to housework are not a part of life for Chinese school children; fewer than 20% performed these tasks.\nCONCLUSION: Chinese youth are unique compared to those in other developing countries because they do not perform\nhousehold chores. Instead, they are under pressure to achieve scholastically. Participation in MOD/VIG PA outside of school is\nalmost nonexistent. Current television watching habits are relatively low compared to developed countries and walking/biking is\na common form of commuting.

Likewise, we know little\nabout physical inactivity patterns (eg television watching,\nstudying, or passive games) of youth in developing coun-\ntries.\nChina represents one developing country currently ex-\nperiencing rapid changes in health and nutrition that are\nlinked to political and social reforms initiated more than\n20 y ago.4 Although the prevalence of overweight is\nrelatively low in Chinese youth (4% in Chinese adolescents\npurpose of this paper was to describe PA and inactivity levels\nand patterns in Chinese youth (aged 6\u00ad18 y of age and\n*Correspondence: Dr C Tudor-Locke, Department of Exercise and Well-\nness, Arizona State University East, 7001 E Williams Field Road, Mesa, AZ\nE-mail: Tudor-Locke@asu.edu\nwww.nature.com/ijo\nattending school). The descriptive analysis herein represents\nthe foundation upon which future longitudinal studies of PA\nin this population will be based.\nMethods\nStudy design\nThe China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) is a\nlongitudinal survey (with data currently available from\nto examine how the social and economic transformation of\nChinese society (and national and local implementation of\nhealth, nutrition, and family planning policies and pro-\ngrams) has affected health and nutritional status of its\npopulation. The study sample was drawn from eight\nprovinces (Guangxi, Guizhou, Heilongjiang, Henan, Hubei,\nHunan, Jiangsu, and Shandong) that vary substantially in\ngeography, economic development, public resources, and\nhealth indicators. A multistage, random cluster process was\nused to draw the surveyed sample. Counties in the eight\nprovinces were initially stratified by income (low, middle,\nand high) and a weighted sampling scheme was used to\nrandomly select four counties in each province. The\nprovincial capital and a lower income city within each\nprovince were selected. In addition, the township capital and\nthree villages within the counties were randomly selected.\nFinally, within each city, urban and suburban neighborhoods\nwere randomly selected. Additional details about the\nstudy design and sampling strategies are available at the\nWorld Wide Web site for the China Health and Nutrition\nSurvey (http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/china/home.html)\nor from Popkin et al.4\nSubjects\nAnthropometric data\nHeight and weight were measured directly by trained health\nworkers who followed standard protocols similar to the\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES) protocol developed by the National Center for\nHealth Statistics in the USA. Weight in lightweight clothing\nwas measured to the nearest 0.1 kg and height was measured\nto the nearest 0.1 cm. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated\nas weight in kg/(height in meters)2. All data collection staff\ntook part in interobserver reliability testing as part of\ntraining.5 Complete anthropometric data were obtained\nduring a physician-conducted physical examination from\nPhysical activity and inactivity data\nCHNS PA and inactivity data were collected from youth\nasked survey questions directly. Parents were present for\ninterviews with children younger than 10 y of age7 and often\nassisted the child with answering or answered the questions\ndirectly as a proxy for the child. For youth registered in\nschool, survey questions focused on physical activities inside\nand outside school hours (sports/exercise), commuting mode\nto school (by motorized vehicle, bicycle, or walking), and\ninactive pursuits outside of school hours (watching televi-\nsion/videos, reading/writing/drawing, or playing board/vi-\ndeo games). For all activities identified, respondents were\nqueried about their duration (eg hours and minutes per week\nor per day). Youth were also asked about their contribution\nto family income (through family-run gardening/farming/\nlivestock care or small business/commercial ventures) and\nabout chores including housework (eg cleaning, cooking,\nlaundry) and childcare duties. Youth aged 16\u00ad18 y of age\nwere queried about gainful employment outside family\nbusinesses.\nData treatment and statistical analysis\nBackground and household characteristics of the sample\nincluded the proportions reporting urban vs rural dwelling,\nand household television, motor vehicle, and bicycle/\ntricycle ownership. The proportions classified as overweight\nand as obese were determined using sex- and age- (mid-year)\nappropriate BMI cutpoints established by the National\nCenter for Health Statistics (http://www.cdc.gov/growth-\ncharts).\nReported activities were assigned metabolic equivalent\n(MET) values using the `Compendium of Physical Activ-\nities'.8 Metabolic rate at rest is classified as 1 MET; a 3 MET\nactivity requires three times the energy expenditure at rest.\nAn average MET value was imputed for categories of\nactivities (eg gymnastics, team sports, track and field, and\nother activities). (In actuality, the energy cost of activities\nmay be approximately 10% higher in children. Unfortu-\nnately, a youth-appropriate compendium of physical activ-\nities was not available at the time of these analyses.)\nCategories of sport/exercise were considered moderate to\nvigorous (MOD/VIG; Z3 MET) and categories of sedentary\nactivities were considered light (LIGHT; o3 MET), based on a\n1993 CDC-ACSM consensus panel on PA and public health.9\nActive commuting to school by bicycle (4 MET) or by\nwalking (3 MET) was also considered a moderate-intensity\nactivity. Time spent active commuting to school each week\nwas calculated by multiplying reported time for a round trip\nby 5 days/week. Consultation with our Chinese collaborators\nindicated that the seemingly incongruent examples in the\n`other activities' category (eg board games, martial arts, and\nboxing) all represented light activities performed informally\nby youth; that is, martial arts and boxing are not structured,\nregimented activities as we understand them to be in a\nPhysical activity in Chinese youth\nC Tudor-Locke et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nWestern context. This category was accordingly coded. We\nwere also informed that it is not typical for Chinese children\nunder 12 y to ride a bicycle by themselves; those under 12 y\nreporting commuting to school by bicycle likely rode on\ntheir parent's bicycle and therefore were not given active\ncommuting credit. The age 12 y was also used to stratify\nanalyses by age group (ie o12 and Z12 y of age). This age cut\npoint is defensible since Chinese children also leave primary\nschool and enter middle school at this time.\nDescriptive statistics were calculated after evaluation of\nthe distributions to identify and remove outliers (above the\n99th percentile of distribution) for total reported time in\nMOD/VIG PA (sum of in-school, outside school, and active\ncommuting). Questionnaire-derived PA data are typically\npositively skewed with mean values biased by a large number\nof subjects performing little or no PA or relatively few\nsubjects performing a lot of PA.10 Descriptive statistics herein\nare therefore presented as the proportion reporting any\ndefined PA and the median and interquartile range (IQR) of\ndistribution of time (min/week) for those reporting any of\nthe defined activity. Gender and age group (ie o12 and\nZ12 y of age) differences in proportions were tested using w2\ntests. Differences in time in PA classifications were tested\nusing nonparametric (two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum) tests.\nSedentary activities included sitting watching television/\nvideos (1 MET), sitting reading/writing/drawing (1 MET), and\nsitting games (1.5 MET). Inactivity indices included watch-\ning television Z2 and Z4 h/day. These categories of\ntelevision watching were set to be comparable to a US study\nof television watching and body composition in youth.11\nDescriptive statistics were again presented as the proportion\nreporting any and the median and IQR of distribution of\ntime (min/week) for those reporting any of the defined\nactivity.\nPerformance of chores (gardening/farming/livestock care,\nhousework, childcare) was not queried in a similar manner\nnecessary to comparably construct accumulated duration;\nhowever, the proportion reporting any of these activities was\nexplored. Engagement in gainful employment was only\nasked of those youth aged 16\u00ad18 y of age (Chinese govern-\nment prohibits employment of youth younger than 16 y);\nthe proportion reporting any is reported. All statistical\nanalyses were conducted using SAS Version 8.01. Signifi-\ncance was set at an alpha level of Po0.05.\nResults\nThe analysis data set of Chinese school children contained\npercentile of distribution for total reported time in MOD/\nVIG PA. Complete anthropometric data were available for\nfemales were classified as overweight; 5 and 6% were,\nrespectively, classified as obese. There were no significant\ngender differences in age, BMI, or the proportion classified as\noverweight or obese. Table 1 presents subjects' background\nand household descriptive data.\nTable 2 presents the proportion of Chinese school children\nwho engaged in any MOD/VIG PA and the time (min/week)\nexpended (for those reporting any) for each gender by age\ngroup. Active commuting and MOD/VIG PA during school\ncontributed the most to daily PA for both males and females,\nregardless of age group. There was no difference in the\nproportion reporting any active commuting or reporting\ntime spent active commuting between genders within age\ngroups. Significant age group differences were apparent for\nboth genders, however. This was not explained solely by\ndifferences in commuting by bicycling; older age groups also\nmore frequently reported walking and spending more time\ncommuting to school by walking (data not shown,\nPo0.001). Fewer older school children engaged in MOD/\nVIG PA during school and for shorter accumulated durations\ncompared with the younger age group. Females also engaged\nin shorter durations of MOD/VIG PA during school com-\npared to males. Relatively few Chinese school children\nengaged in any MOD/VIG PA outside of school. There were\nno gender differences in the proportions reporting any time\nin this activity but there were significant differences between\nage groups; there was a slightly larger proportion of older\nmales and females who engaged in MOD/VIG PA outside of\nschool. Despite apparent differences in time in these\nactivities, no gender or age group differences were statisti-\ncally significant.\nTable 3 presents similar descriptive information with\nregard to sedentary activities. Only 8% of Chinese school-\naged youth, regardless of gender, watch television Z2 h/day;\nless than 1% watch Z4 h/day. Significant age group\ndifferences were found for the proportion reporting any\ntime spent, and accumulated weekly time spent, watching\nTV/videos or reading/writing/drawing. Relatively few youth\nengage in sitting games (which include playing video\ngames). Still, Chinese female youth more frequently reported\nengaging in sitting games and for longer accumulated\nweekly time.\nLess than 2% of males and females reported any garden-\ning/farming/livestock care activities and less than 1%\nreported assisting with small business/commercial ventures\nrelated to family income. A total of 11% of males and 20% of\nfemales reported any chores related to housework. Less than\nTable 1 Background and household characteristics of school-aged youth\nsurveyed in the 1997 China Health and Nutrition Survey\n% urban\nvs rural\n% TV\nownership\n% motor vehicle\nownership\n% bicycle/tricycle\nownership\nPhysical activity in Chinese youth\nC Tudor-Locke et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\n1% of Chinese youth reported childcare duties.

Relatively few males and even fewer\nfemales participate in any MOD/VIG PA outside of school.\nCommuting mode to school is likely influenced by a\nnumber of factors including (1) distance to school; (2) cost;\n(3) economic circumstances of the family; (4) availability of\nmotorized transport (either household owned or public\nTable 2 MOD/VIG activities in Chinese youth registered in school\nYouth registered in school\n% reporting >0 min Median (IQR)a (min/week)\nMOD/VIG activity variable Age group (y) Males Females Males Females\naComputed for only those reporting any (>0 min).\nbSignificant difference between age groups within gender.\ncSignificant difference between genders within age group.\nTable 3 Sedentary activities before/after school in Chinese youth registered in school\nYouth registered in school\n% reporting >0 min Median (IQR) (min/week)\nSedentary activity variable Age group (y) Males Females Males Females\naSignificant difference between genders within age group.\nbSignificant difference between age groups within gender.\nPhysical activity in Chinese youth\nC Tudor-Locke et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\ntransit options), and (5) specific to China, whether the youth\nis of an accepted age to ride a bicycle independently.\nCurrently, a relatively low proportion (15\u00ad17%) of house-\nholds in this study owned a motorized vehicle; this is likely\nto change as urbanization continues. In contrast, in the USA\nwhere motorized transportation is ubiquitous, a recent\nreport of school transportation modes in Georgia indicated\nthat fewer than 19% of school-aged children who lived r1\nmile from school walked to school the majority of days of\nthe week and almost 42% were chauffeured to school in a\nprivate vehicle.12 Household ownership of motorized trans-\nportation has been associated with obesity in Chinese adults\n(both men and women) and acquisition of a motorized\nvehicle increased the odds of becoming obese over an 8 y\ntime period in men.13 Active commuting behaviors have also\nbeen associated with reduced cardiovascular risk factors in a\nmunicipal sample of Chinese adults.14\u00ad16\nA great proportion (approximately 72%) of the sample\nsurveyed participated in MOD/VIG PA during school. The\nsurvey did not distinguish between activities performed\nduring structured physical education classes, other organized\nactivities (eg intramural sports during lunch breaks), or\ninformal activities during recess or lunch breaks. In compar-\nison, 21\u00ad22% of American youth participate regularly in\nphysical education class.17,18 Although reported accumu-\nlated time in MOD/VIG PA during school was relatively high,\nit is likely an overestimation produced from recalling\nstructured time periods and not necessarily representative\nof completely active time. In US schools, elementary school\nchildren were engaged in MOD/VIG PA less than 9% of\nphysical education class time.19 These findings and others20\nsuggest that accumulated time in PA during school may\nactually be less than reported by Chinese youth as well.\nHigh levels of television watching have been associated\nwith youth overweight and obesity in cross-sectional\nstudies.11,21\u00ad24 The consistency, strength, and specificity of\nthese associations suggest that television viewing may lead\nto weight gain in at least some youth. At this time, evidence\nfrom longitudinal studies is lacking, however, and we know\nof only one randomized controlled trial to reduce children's\ntelevision viewing habits.25 That study reported significant\ndecreases in indicators of adiposity (eg BMI, triceps skinfold\nthickness, waist girth, and waist-to-hip ratio) thus providing\nadditional evidence of a causal relationship between televi-\nsion viewing habits and obesity.25 Additional prospective\nstudies are warranted to confirm causation. Chinese youth,\nhowever, do not watch television/videos to the extent\nobserved in other countries despite the relatively high levels\n(90\u00ad91%) of household television ownership reported here-\nwatching television Z2 h/day.11,23 In the Philippines (an-\nother developing country where household television own-\ncompared with 8% herein. Between-country differences may\nreflect regional television programming relevance and\nappeal or cultural differences in viewing habits. American-\nstyle satellite television (eg 30+ channels and programming\nthat includes game shows, reality-based shows, primetime\ndramas, and product advertisements) has only recently been\nintroduced on a large scale to China.27 In 1997, almost none\nof the Chinese households surveyed had access to such\ncontemporary television programming. We therefore antici-\npate that overweight and obesity will increase in Chinese\nyouth as television watching behaviors increase in response\nto this new wave of mass-appeal broadcasting and consumer\nreveal important shifts in behavior and important health\noutcomes. Additional data will include type of television\nchannels available to and preferred by youth.\nThe proportion of Chinese youth reporting reading/\nwriting/drawing appears comparable to television/video\nwatching, although older age groups appear to be spending\nmore accumulated weekly time in the former activity.\nUnfortunately, there is little published international data\nabout other forms of inactivity (eg studying or passive\ngames) to compare these findings to. Youth in China are\nunder great pressure to perform well in school, and heavy\nhomework loads are typical.28,29 A university education is\nseen as the only path to a good job and the pressure to\nsucceed scholastically begins early since university entrance\nis restricted.28 Providing a good education is also valued in\nChinese society and parental care of children includes time\ndevoted to assisting with homework.30\nOur estimates of accumulated time in various activities did\nnot include time spent in gainful employment or performing\nchores. Very few youth are employed, however, and chores\nrelated to housework (chores at school were not queried) are\nnot a part of life for Chinese youth (as stated previously,\nfewer than 20% performed these tasks). The Chinese\ngovernment prohibits employment of youth younger than\n16 y of age, and the availability of job opportunities for older\nadolescents is limited and restricted by administrative\nrequirements that discourage workplaces from hiring tem-\nporary or short-term workers. Chinese women take on all\nhousehold responsibilities in part to free children to focus on\nscholastic achievement.28 In contrast, the primary source of\nPA for Filipino youth is chores (eg cleaning, fetching water,\nlaundry), both at school and at home.26 Performance of\ndomestic tasks is also common in other developing coun-\ntries, especially for adolescent females.31,32 For example,\nwhereas Russian boys spend 4\u00ad5 h/week in these activities.32\nThis suggests that China is unique and does not follow\nanticipated patterns of time use in this regard, at least for\nyouth. A caveat to interpretation is that gardening/farming/\nlivestock care was only queried with regard to contribution\nto family income; however, it is possible that more youth are\ninvolved in these types of activities for immediate family\nconsumption. Regardless, such activities are seasonal and are\nnot typically performed by youth. Instead, parents and\nadults in the community actively discourage any work/\nchores or other activities that might interfere with their\nPhysical activity in Chinese youth\nC Tudor-Locke et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nexpected role as students. The surprisingly low proportion of\nChinese youth performing childcare duties is a direct\nreflection of the fact that national birth control policies\nhave limited family size33 and, therefore, childcare opportu-\nnities. In all, we do not consider the determination of\naccumulated time in various activities to be problematic.\nThe strength of this study is that it is based on a large\neight-province nationwide representative survey that has\nbeen administered over several years, subjected to stringent\nquality control strategies, and involves international colla-\nborators. The extensive database uniquely includes measures\nof inactivity as well as PA. The cross-sectional findings\nherein, however, are based on a single year of data collection\nand therefore limit causal inference. Further, parents neces-\nsarily assisted younger children (o10 y of age) with the\nsurvey or provided a proxy report of children's PA habits.\nAlthough proxy reports have been questioned with regard to\nvalidity, proxy reports are practical approaches for large\nstudy populations and permit researchers to avoid recall\nbiases associated with the cognitive limitations of young\nAs Chinese youth transition to adult roles and responsi-\nbilities, time spent in MOD/VIG PA currently pursued during\nschool will be exchanged for increasingly sedentary employ-\nment options.3,4 As modernization and technological ad-\nvancement continue in this developing country, it is likely\nthat commuting patterns will also shift to more passive\nforms (ie increased use of motorized transportation alter-\nnatives). Already public busses have replaced bicycles as the\nprimary means of transportation for urban dwellers.35 These\nchanges portend an increased prevalence of overweight and\nobesity (and obesity-related conditions) in Chinese youth as\nthey transition to adulthood. Against this backdrop of\ndecreasing PA and increasing inactivity, it appears that\nhealth promotion efforts should focus on public transporta-\ntion policies that encourage continued reliance on more\nactive forms of commuting, promote increased participation\nin leisure-time MOD/VIG PA, and attempt to cap time spent\nin inactivity (eg studying, watching television, and playing\npassive games). Unfortunately, it appears that a strong\nfoundation of involvement in leisure time MOD/VIG PA is\nnot currently nurtured in Chinese youth, especially in\nfemales, and that the competing societal pressure to excel\nat school will not be soon relieved. Perhaps most threaten-\ningly, recently introduced mass television programming\nimprovements foreshadow an amplified obesity epidemic.\nIn summary, in-school activities and active commuting\nrepresent the most important forms of MOD/VIG PA of\nChinese youth. In-school activities are susceptible to par-\nental and societal pressures for academic success manifested\nin education policy changes and to the transition to adult\nroles and responsibilities. Active commuting behaviors are\nespecially susceptible to transportation policies that favor\nmore passive forms of commuting with increased moder-\nnization and affluence. Participation in leisure-time MOD/\nVIG PA is currently underutilized by Chinese youth as an\nalternative form of health-related activity. Although televi-\nsion viewing is relatively low, this is expected to change\ndramatically in future years. And although overweight and\nobesity rates are relatively low for the moment, there is\nevidence that they are also increasing over time.36 Doubtless,\nthe social and economic transformation of Chinese society\nwill continue to impact the health and welfare of its\npopulace. The concomitant impact of changes in youth PA\nand inactivity patterns and their impact on obesity trends\nwill continue to be studied longitudinally in China with\nsubsequent administrations of the CHNS.\n"
