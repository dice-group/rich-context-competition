Cooper, MD; Kurt C. Stange, MD, PhD\nContext: Indoor tanning is a risk factor for skin can-\ncer, but the population-based prevalence of this behav-\nior among adolescents is not clearly known.\nObjectives: To describe the prevalence of tanning booth\nuse among white US adolescents and to assess its asso-\nciation with sociodemographic factors, health behav-\niors, and appearance.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants: A nationally rep-\nresentative sample of 6903 non-Hispanic white adoles-\ncents, aged 13 to 19 years, who participated in Wave II\ntional Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health.\nMain Outcome Measure: Frequency of lifetime use\nof indoor artificial tanning facilities.\nResults: With the data weighted to national levels, 36.8%\nofthewhitefemaleadolescentsand11.2%ofthewhitemale\nadolescents have used a tanning booth at least once in their\nlife, while 28.1% and 6.9% of the female and male adoles-\ncents, respectively, reported tanning booth use 3 or more\ntimes.

The design and\nadministration of the study surveys have been described else-\nwhere.16,17 The current analysis is based on Wave II data col-\nception of maternal education that was obtained previously from\nthe parent survey. The Wave II total response rate was 88.2%16\nand the Wave II grand sample weights provided by the AHS si-\nmultaneously adjusted for nonresponse and the different selec-\ntion probabilities of sample members.\nThe AHS data were collected with active parental consent\n(Waves I and II) and under strict guidelines of confidentiality\nto guard against deductive disclosure. Human subject protec-\ntion during both the primary data collection (conducted by the\nUniversity of North Carolina, Chapel Hill) and the secondary\nuse of these data by us was reviewed and approved by our re-\nspective institutional review boards.\nPARTICIPANTS\nParticipants included in this analysis (1) had a Wave II grand\nsample weight, (2) were between 13 and 19 years old, (3) self-\nidentified as non-Hispanic white, and (4) answered all sun-\nrelated outcome questions. The final sample size for analysis\nsis was restricted to white adolescents because they are the pri-\nmary users of the artificial tanning facilities and are at signifi-\ncantly greater risk for both short- and long-term adverse effects\nfrom overexposure to UV radiation.\nOutcome Measure\nThestudyoutcome--lifetimefrequencyofartificialtanninglight\nuse--wasmeasuredby1question:\"Howmanytimesinyourlife\nhave you used a sunlamp or a tanning booth or a tanning parlor\norsalon?\"The6responsecategories(Table1)weredichotomized\nSociodemographics, Skin Type, and Sunbathing\nAge, sex, geographic region of residence, urban location of the\nschool, maternal educational level, and student income or al-\nlowance were recorded for each respondent. The following 2\nquestions assessed skin solar response type: \"After several\nmonths of not being in the sun, when you go out in the sun\nwithout sunscreen or protective clothing for the first time for\nat least an hour, do you get . . . \" a severe sunburn with blis-\nters; a bad sunburn that peels later (combined for burn type\n1/2); a mild sunburn that becomes a tan (burn type 3); or a sun-\ntan without burning (burn type 4). The tan response was mea-\nsured by the question: \"When you go out in the sun every day\nfor 2 weeks, do you get . . . \" very dark and deeply tanned (tan\ntype 4); moderately tanned (tan type 3); mildly tanned (tan type\n2); only freckled, no suntan at all or repeated sunburns (tan\ntype 1). Both questions included an \"Other\" category without\nadditional specification. Intentional sunbathing was mea-\nsured by the question: \"During the summer, how often do you\nsunbathe, or lie in the sun, to get a tan?\" with response cat-\negories of frequently, occasionally, rarely, or never (referent).\nHealth Behaviors\nAny use of tobacco, alcohol, or marijuana since the Wave I in-\nterview (mean [SD] time since Wave I was 10.9 [1.6] months)\nwas combined and categorized as no substance use (referent),\n1 substance used, or 2 or 3 substances used. A nutrition be-\nhavior index was constructed from 3 questions regarding eat-\ning behaviors in the last 7 days: (1) eating breakfast on 5 or\nmore days (yes, 1; no, 0); (2) eating fast food on 2 or more days\n(no, 1; yes, 0); and (3) taking vitamin supplements (yes, 1; no,\n0). Responses were summed and categorized as 0, poor behav-\niors (referent); 1, moderate behaviors; 2 or 3, good behaviors.\nPhysical activity was included as a composite score from 3 ques-\ntions regarding the frequency per week of participating in a va-\nriety of active sports or exercises. Responses were summed over\nthe 3 questions with a range of 0 to 15 or more times per week\nand analyzed as a continuous variable.\nAppearance-Related Variables\nBody mass index was calculated from physical measurements ob-\ntained at the time of the Wave II interview (n=6774) or from self-\nreported height and weight (n=98). Missing cases (n=31) were\nimputed with the Stata18 imputation command using the sample\nBMI, age, and sex. Respondents were then categorized accord-\ning to the gender-specific BMI-for-age Centers for Disease Con-\ntrol and Prevention growth curves.19 Body image was measured\nwith \"How do you think of yourself in terms of weight?\" with 5\nresponse categories ranging from very underweight to very over-\nweight. Teenagers reported a self-assessment of physical matu-\nrity with responses ranging from \"younger than most my age\"\nthrough \"older than most my age.\"\nTable 1.

Responses from\n2 questions about a permanent tattoo (yes, 1; no, 0) and body\npiercing, other than ears (yes, 1; no, 0) were summed and di-\nchotomized as neither (0, referent) and either or both (1).\nPsychosocial Measures\nThe Add Health\u00adPicture Vocabulary Test, used as a measure\nof cognitive ability, is an abridged version of the Peabody Pic-\nture Vocabulary Test-Revised20 and its validation and use in the\nAHS is reported elsewhere.21 Age-standardized scores for this\nsample of teenagers ranged from 77 to 129 (weighted mean [SE],\non a 5-item Likert scale of strongly agree (5) to strongly dis-\nagree (1) regarding \"making decisions without thinking too\nmuch about the consequences.\"\nData were analyzed using the design-based survey commands\nin Stata Statistical Software, Release 6.018 to adjust for the ef-\nfects of the complex survey design used in the AHS and to pro-\nduce unbiased estimates of the SEs. Crude associations be-\ntween tanning booth use and categorical study variables were\nexamined by sex using 2 tests of independence implemented\nwith survey design-based corrections. Age, physical activity level,\nthoughtful decision making, and Add Health\u00adPicture Vocabu-\nlary Test score were examined as continuous variables and com-\npared between tanning booth users and nonusers within gen-\nder with weighted t tests.\nHypothesized risk factors for tanning booth use were or-\nganized within a multivariate framework that examined the re-\nlationship between tanning booth use and (1) sociodemo-\ngraphic factors, (2) skin type and sunbathing practices, (3) health\nbehaviors, (4) appearance-related behaviors, and (5) psycho-\nsocial factors. Study variables significant in the 2 analyses at\nP.05 were included in preliminary logistic regression mod-\nels to assess the independent contribution of candidate vari-\nables within these domains to tanning booth use. A final lo-\ngistic model was determined by a stepwise backward elimination\napproach using significant predictors from all 5 domains, in-\ncluding 2-way interaction terms between BMI and dieting be-\nhavior, sex and nutritional behavior, sex and physical activity,\nand sex and physical maturity. The contribution of each inde-\npendent variable to the model was examined using an ad-\njusted Wald statistic. Nonsignificant variables remained in the\nmodel if they proved to be confounders (ie, if their exclusion\naltered other parameter coefficients by 10%) or improved the\nfit of the model based on the Hosmer-Lemeshow 2 Goodness-\nof-Fit statistic,22 resulting in the most parsimonious model in\nterms of individual variables and overall model fit. Adjusted\nodds ratios and 95% CIs were reported from the multivariate\nanalysis.\nRESULTS\nThe final sample of 6903 respondents represented a\nweighted total of about 12.03 million non-Hispanic white\nadolescents in the United States between the ages of 13 and\n19 years. Male and female adolescents were equally repre-\ntendedsuburbanschools,and22.0%hadacollege-degreed\nmother. Most teenagers classified their unprotected skin\nrespectively). A larger majority of white teenagers re-\nported at least a mild tan or better after a 2-week exposure\n(tan types 2-4, 87.6%), suggesting that most white adoles-\ncents perceive themselves as capable of obtaining a tan.\nOverall, 24.1% of the respondents used a tanning fa-\ncility at least once in their life, representing 2.9 million ado-\nlescents (Table 1). Six and a half percent of the teenagers\nreported indoor tanning only once or twice, while 17.6%\nused tanning booths 3 or more times. Among female ado-\nlescents who have ever used a tanning booth, 76.2% did\ntimes. Thus, multiple tanning sessions appear to be the\nnorm. For this analysis, tanning booth users were defined\nas those who reported indoor tanning 3 or more times.\nAs given in Table 2, more female than male adoles-\ncents have used tanning facilities (28.1% vs 6.9%) and the\nfrequencyoftanningboothuseincreasedwithage.Thepro-\nportion of tanning booth users increased with the increas-\ning ability to tan and with a decreasing tendency to burn.\nThe proportion of indoor tanners was different by region,\nurban locale, student income or allowance, and maternal\neducational level but not by the month of the survey.\nWeighted percentages were obtained for the distri-\nbution of all other study variables between tanning booth\nusers and nonusers by sex (Table 3). Tanning booth us-\ners were more frequent sunbathers and substance users.\nFemale tanning booth users had a higher mean (SE) par-\nticipation in physical activities (5.1 [0.14] times per week)\nand more indoor tanners reported 2 to 3 good nutritional\nbehaviors (40.7%), both compared with female nonusers.\nOverall, nonusers had a higher average score on the Add\nHealth\u00adPicture Vocabulary Test and more female nonus-\ners agreed with a thoughtful decision-making process com-\npared with indoor tanners. Because several variables dem-\nonstrated associations with tanning booth use that differed\nby sex, interaction terms with these variables and sex were\nincluded in the logistic regression analyses.\nFrom the initial domain-specific models, burn type, month\nof interview, and body image were not significantly as-\nsociated with tanning booth use and were not confound-\ners. The interaction of BMI and dieting behavior was also\nnot significant. Frequent sunbathers were 8 times more\nlikely to use a tanning booth than those who never sun-\nHowever, the frequency of sunbathing also redundantly\ncontrolled for other independent variables (for example\nbeing female and skin type) and its presence signifi-\ncantly reduced the fit of the model. Ultimately, sunbath-\ning, interview month, body image, and burn type were\nnot retained in the final model.\nAllvariablesthatdemonstratedsignificanceinthepre-\nliminary models were included in a final model (Table 4).\nBeing female, increasing age, residing in the Midwest or\nSouth, having a personal income or allowance and nonur-\nbanlocaleallincreasedtheoddsoftanningboothuseamong\nwhite teenagers.

In addition, physician health behavior counsel-\ning to adolescents should include the potential risk of\ntanning booth use.29\nAppearance-related motives (eg, looking attrac-\ntive, perceived attractiveness, and self-presentation mo-\ntives) have been identified as strong psychosocial indi-\ncators of intentional sun exposure among adolescents.30,31\nDieting activity and body piercing/tattoos are behaviors\ngenerally intended to enhance attractiveness and were hy-\npothesized to be positively associated with tanning bed\nuse to improve appearance. Trying to lose weight mod-\nerately increased the odds of tanning booth use while an\nactual greater BMI was associated with decreased in-\ndoor tanning. Thus, these dieters include many average-\nweight individuals (generally female adolescents) who\nmay also be tanning to increase attractiveness. Truly over-\nweight adolescents seem less likely to engage in this be-\nhavior, possibly because they may not be comfortable en-\ntering a tanning facility.\nUsingadifferentparadigm,othershavesuggestedthat\nappearance-enhancing behaviors present alternatives from\nwhich persons will choose. Hillhouse et al14 determined\nthat college students with strong positive attitudes to-\nward artificial tanning held strong negative attitudes to-\nward clothing as an alternate behavior to improve attrac-\ntiveness, but found no relationship with exercise, weight\ncontrol, financial status, or intelligence. Our framework\nincluded these (except clothing) and other variables in a\nsample of younger adolescents and found several associa-\ntionswithtanningbeduse,suggestingthatmultiplechoices\nfor appearance enhancement are possible especially at\nyounger ages when adolescents are experimenting with\nways to increase peer acceptance. Appearance-related be-\nhaviorsmayincludebothpositiveandnegativeaspectsand,\nthus, can be associated with both positive and negative be-\nhaviors. Physical activity and good nutrition may en-\nhance appearance as well as overall good health, while\nweight control via smoking may improve appearance with\npoor health consequences. Thus, models of tanning be-\nhaviors should include diverse behaviors as well as psy-\nchosocial and cognitive variables to further elucidate\nthe influential relationships and care must be taken when\ndesigning interventions surrounding appearance motiva-\ntion not to present alternatives that may inadvertently en-\ncourage other risk behaviors.\nWe interpret using an artificial tanning facility once\nor twice to be experimental and not representative of the\nbehavior. Among the youngest teenagers, this may be too\nconservative of an approach, that is, even 1 or 2 visits at\nthis age may identify a highly motivated tanner who will\neventually engage in additional tanning sessions given\ntime. Thus, our observed associations may actually be bi-\nWhat This Study Adds\nA tanned appearance continues to be considered healthy\nand attractive and a measurable segment of the US ado-\nlescent population engages in the use of artificial light\nsources (eg, tanning beds or sunlamps) to achieve a tan.\nEven as commercial facilities promote indoor tanning as\na safe tan, both short- and long-term adverse effects have\nbeen associated with tanning bed use. Development of\ninterventions targeting the use of indoor tanning facili-\nties would benefit from a better understanding of the cor-\nrelates of tanning booth use in a large representative sur-\nvey of adolescents.\nPrior surveys on artificial tanning in the United States\nfocused on areas of lower ambient sunlight, but this analy-\nsis demonstrates that indoor tanning is practiced in areas\nof high sunlight as well, suggesting that advice to avoid\nindoor tanning should not be overlooked in sunnier re-\ngions. Indoor tanning generally involves multiple ses-\nsionsandisstronglyassociatedwithsunbathing;thus,teen-\nagers who maintain year-round tans or repeatedly base tan\nindoors prior to outdoor sunbathing risk exposure to mul-\ntiple sources of UV radiation and the unknown conse-\nquences of that combination. Finally, tanning booth use\namong high school adolescents seems to align with ap-\npearance-related factors and other health-risk behaviors,\nproviding potential intervention pathways and linkages to\nboth novel and tested prevention strategies.\nTable 4.

The period of tan-\nning booth use was specified as \"in your life.\" Thus, we\ndo not know, for example, if the 10 to 20 sessions were\nover a 2-week period or spread out over the previous 2\nyears. While this represents a limitation in defining the\nbehavior pattern more precisely, dichotomizing the fre-\nquencies as a response variable still permits cautious in-\nterpretation that certain independent variables associ-\nate with repeated indoor tanning.\nSeveral limitations to our study are similar to previ-\nous reports. We relied on self-reported data without ad-\nditionalobjectivecorroboration.However,atleastonestudy\nhas provided evidence that adolescents' self-report of sun\nprotective practices was valid.32 The cross-sectional na-\nture of the data does not permit causal inferences to be\ndrawn nor does it allow examining an individual's behav-\nior throughout adolescence. Future study design would\nbenefit from a longitudinal component.\nThe present findings extend previous work that a\nsubstantial minority of adolescents engage in indoor tan-\nning practices and further suggest that this behavior may\nalign with other health-risk and health-promoting behav-\niors practiced by adolescents. Availability of tanning sa-\nlons33 and economic marketing tactics2,34 give teenagers\nwith strong intentions to tan another method to do so. In-\ncreased emphasis on interventions and strategies to pre-\nvent both short- and long-term adverse effects of unpro-\ntected UV exposure from artificial light among adolescents\nis warranted.\nThis work was supported in part by training grant R25-\nMd (Dr Demko).\nThis research uses data from Add Health, a program\nproject designed by J.
