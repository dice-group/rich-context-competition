Localities that have both high-quality educational infrastructure and\na well-functioning criminal justice system can be places where children in low-\nincome families can easily overcome barriers to opportunity. Education is one of\nthe strongest predictors of lifetime wealth, and lack of access to quality education\nis one of the most frequently cited constraints on upward mobility in areas of\npersistent poverty (Autor, Katz, & Kearney, 2008; Bailey & Dynarski, 2011). Areas\nof concentrated poverty are also typically characterized by high rates of crime and\ndisorder, which can have adverse effects on the educational attainment and future\njob prospects of young people growing up in those neighborhoods (Katz & Turner,\nInside school walls, bullying and aggressive behavior can have long-lasting\npsychological effects on victims, and meta-analyses of antibullying and antivio-\nlence programs find that certain policy levers can improve school safety (Ttofi &\nFarrington, 2010; Wilson & Lipsey, 2007). One particular type of antiviolence policy\n1 In addition, public policies that reduce crime can encourage business investment that can revitalize\nblighted areas (Rosenthal & Ross, 2010), although the implication of this development for low-income\nresidents of these communities is less clear (Freedman, 2013).\nC 2016 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management\nPublished by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Children who are arrested\nand incarcerated are less likely to complete high school (Hjalmarsson, 2008), and\ncertain types of criminal records limit a potential student's eligibility for federal\ngrants and loans that reduce the cost of a college degree (Lovenheim & Owens,\n2014). Consistent with this, people who become involved with the criminal justice\nsystem, particularly at a young age, are more likely to continue to be criminally\ninvolved (Aizer & Doyle, 2015), and suffer from persistent negative employment\nThe use of sworn officers within schools has recently been subject to increased\nscrutiny as a cause of what has become known as the \"School-to-Prison Pipeline\"\n(Wald & Losen, 2003). Since SROs are sworn law enforcement officials with arrest\npowers, critics contend that SROs may be more likely to respond to student mis-\nbehavior by making an arrest, which security guards or principals are not able to\ndo (American Civil Liberties Union, 2014a, 2014b). If SROs make arrests in cases\nwhere a principal would otherwise use confidential, in-school, discipline, this low-\nered threshold at which misbehavior becomes criminal behavior can lead to other-\nwise similar students in different schools accumulating different criminal records.\nWhile few juvenile arrests directly result in incarceration, this is a key entry point\ninto the School-to-Prison Pipeline; becoming \"known to police\" may increase the\nseverity of the criminal justice system response to future deviant behavior (e.g.,\nBrunson, 2007; Herbert, 2010,). In addition, analysis of nationally representative\nyouth surveys suggests that simply being stopped by police is associated with re-\nduced use of banks and hospitals as well as lower employment rates (Brayne, 2014).\nFinally, to the extent that schools with SROs are more likely to be located in cities\nand areas with larger minority populations, hiring these officers can exacerbate\nracial disparities in the criminal justice system.3\nWhile there is a large literature on the impacts of crime and criminal justice on\nyouth outcomes that is relevant to the potential costs of benefits of SROs, there is\nmuch less direct evidence on the causal impacts of the program itself. A handful\nof project evaluations have found that SROs have increased perceptions of school\nsafety (Raymond, 2010). A federally funded evaluation of SROs (Finn & McDevitt,\n2005) primarily focused on what SROs do, and noted that \"most programs fail to\ncollect important process and outcome evaluation data\" (Finn & McDevitt, 2005,\np. 4). Recent survey evidence has found that schools with SROs have 12 percent\nhigher official crime rates, particularly for more marginal offences such as weapons\nand drug violations, which went up by almost 30 percent after SROs were hired (Na\n& Gottfredson, 2013). Na and Gottfredson do not measure arrests directly, but they\n2 See Brown (2006) for an overview of the history of school resource officers (SROs), and a more detailed\ndescription of their role in schools.\n3 Na and Gottfredson (2013) estimated that just over 10 percent of elementary schools, 50 percent of\nmiddle schools, and 68 percent of high schools in urban areas had SROs, compared with 5 percent, 25\npercent, and 40 percent of rural elementary, middle, and high schools, respectively.\nPublished on behalf of the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management\nTesting the School-to-Prison Pipeline / 13\nalso find large increases in the probability that less serious crimes were reported to\nthe police.\nOf course, the finding that schools with SROs have higher official crime rates, or\neven that students in SRO schools are more likely to be arrested, is not necessar-\nily evidence that SROs enhance the School-to-Prison Pipeline. Indeed, if SROs are\nviewed as solutions to a school safety or school crime problem, then the observation\nthat there are more crimes or arrests occurring where SROs are hired is simply a cor-\nrelation generated by reverse causality and omitted variable bias (underlying school\nsafety). The size of this bias is likely substantial; failure to address the endogenous\n(and noisy) relationship between police employment and crime prior to the 2000s\nresulted in a number of papers that found either null or positive effects of police on\ncrime rates, and a later literature that carefully addressed these empirical issues has\nconsistently found that the presence of more police officers reduces overall crime\nIn this article, I present the first evidence on the relationship between SROs and\nthe School-to-Prison Pipeline that uses a credible source of quasi-experimental vari-\nation in the presence of law enforcement officers in schools. Specifically, I exploit\nvariation in the timing and size of federal grants distributed by the Department of\nJustice's Community Oriented Policing Services' (COPS) \"Cops in Schools\" (CIS)\nprogram, which allowed law enforcement agencies to staff SRO positions, to iden-\ntify the impact of these SROs on school safety, the rate of officially recorded crimes\nin and out of schools, and with the arrest rates of teenagers and young children for\noffenses that occur in and out of the classroom.\nI first demonstrate that CIS grants were awarded to police agencies and local gov-\nernments that initially had higher crime rates in and out of school, suggesting that\nprevious studies that do not take endogenous determination of SROs and crime into\naccount could produce biased estimates of the impact of those officers in schools. I\nthen show that, conditional on agency fixed effects and demographic control vari-\nables, agencies that did, and did not, receive CIS grants had statistically identical\ntrends in both in- and out-of-school crime as well as arrest rates for crimes occurring\nin school. This is consistent with previous research on COPS hiring grants, which\nfound that grant size was primarily determined by level differences in crime and\nemployment across cities, but was conditionally orthogonal to preexisting trends in\ncrime and police employment (Evans & Owens, 2007).\nI then use three records of police officer employment and school security to ex-\namine the impact of CIS grants on law enforcement. I show that unlike other COPS\ngrants, CIS grants had an immediate, although heterogeneous, impact on overall\nlaw enforcement employment, as reported in the Uniform Crime Reports. Using\na sample of law enforcement agencies in the Law Enforcement Management and\nAdministrative Statistics (LEMAS), I then show that CIS grants were specifically\nused to staff SRO positions, and that one additional CIS officer granted essentially\ndoubled the number of SROs an agency employed within one month of grant re-\nceipt. Finally, I show that schools located in counties where local law enforcement\nagencies received CIS grants were more likely to report having armed security staff,\nas reported in the National Center for Education Statistics School Survey on Crime\nI next use the receipt of CIS grants to estimate the causal reduced-form relation-\nship between these grants and the School-to-Prison Pipeline. I begin by exploring\nthe impact of CIS grants on school safety in the SSOCS. Based on these surveys\nof school administrators, I conclude that CIS grants were associated with reduc-\ntions in school crime rates. At the same time, however, I find small, but imprecisely\nestimated, increases in the likelihood that school administrators report contacting\npolice about the incidents that do still occur.\nPublished on behalf of the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management\n14 / Testing the School-to-Prison Pipeline\nI more rigorously estimate the impact of SROs on crimes known to police and\narrests using the National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) between 1997\nand 2007. The NIBRS allows me not only to differentiate between officially reported\ncrimes based on location, but also to identify the number of arrests made as a result\nof these reported crimes and the age of the person arrested. I find that, conditional\non a rich set of school characteristics, police jurisdictions that received CIS grants\ndid learn about more violent crime taking place in schools, along with more weapons\nand drug violations. However, the agencies also learned about more minor violations\nthat occurred outside of school, particularly drug offenses. Taken at face value, this\nsuggests that hiring SROs may have increased the propensity of citizens to contact\nthe police in general.\nIn addition, I find that law enforcement agencies that were awarded CIS grants\nwere more likely to make arrests for crimes committed in school, and this is driven\nby the arrest of juveniles who are less than 15 years old. I do not find evidence that,\non average, hiring SROs results in more arrests for crimes committed off school\ngrounds, with the exception of arrests for drug charges. Dividing the SSOCS and\nNIBRS sample by the area's nonwhite population fails to yield evidence that CIS\nofficers exacerbated the School-to-Prison Pipeline in minority districts, although\ndata coverage in the NIBRS limits my ability to generalize to schools in large urban\nareas.\nTaken as a whole, these results suggest that there are potentially important neg-\native consequences to posting law enforcement officials in schools, but also some\npotential benefits. A well-intentioned grant program aimed at improving school\nsafety for at-risk children appears to have also resulted in the accumulation of ar-\nrest records for young students. At the same time, there is evidence that people\nwere more likely to contact police about drug crimes occurring outside of schools,\nsuggesting that posting law enforcement officers in schools may help to improve\npolice-community relations more broadly. Finally, perhaps more importantly, and\nin contrast with existing research, I find evidence that hiring SROs increases school\nsafety.\nIn the early 1990s, crime rates in the United States were at historically high levels.\nIn order to better motivate state and local governments to invest in criminal justice\ninfrastructure, in September 1994, Congress enacted the Violent Crime Control and\nlaw enforcement authority on a number of dimensions, including banning the sale\nof assault weapons, expanding the list of federal capital offenses, formalizing the\ncriminality of domestic violence, and prohibiting incarcerated people from applying\nfor Stafford and Pell grants. The VCCA 1994 also authorized over $18 billion in\nnew federal expenditure, almost all of which was to be allocated to state and local\ngovernments that invested in particular types of criminal justice policies. A new\noffice in the Department of Justice, the COPS office, was created by the VCCA 1994\nspecifically for the purpose of distributing roughly $7.5 billion in grants to local\npolicing agencies that subsidized the cost of hiring policing officers, investing in\ntechnology, or developing specialized policing strategies. To date, the COPS office\nhas distributed over $14 billion to local law enforcement agencies.4\n4 See COPS press releases, for example, http://www.cops.usdoj.gov/Default.asp?Item=2743, accessed\nPublished on behalf of the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management\nTesting the School-to-Prison Pipeline / 15\nOne of the specialized policing strategies incentivized by the COPS office was the\nCIS program. CIS grant funds were intended to supplement the salary of an officer\nwho would work in a primary or secondary school as an SRO. The first round of\nCIS funding was awarded in 1999, just as funding for the broader Universal Hiring\nProgram (UHP) was beginning to decline.5 CIS grants were awarded through 2005,\nand in those seven years just over $750 million was granted to local law enforcement\nagencies.6\nCIS grants, which lasted for three years, could only be used to create new SRO\npositions, unlike UHP grants that could be used to hire new officers more gener-\nally. While this restriction in use may have made CIS grants less desirable to law\nenforcement agencies than UHP grants, CIS grants were larger--initially capped\n$75,000 cap for UHP. CIS grants also did not technically require that a new officer\nbe hired by the department, only that a new SRO position be created and the CIS\nfunding be used to pay that SRO's salary--an existing officer could be reassigned\nfrom their regular beat to an SRO position.\nOnce hired, SROs have a number of responsibilities, which vary from school to\nschool. As sworn officers, all SROs have the authority to make arrests and issue\ncitations, sometimes independently of the principal, and serve as a liaison between\nthe school and local criminal justice authorities. If the existence of police inside of\na school lowers the cost to school employees of notifying law enforcement about\nstudent misbehavior, the behavioral threshold at which a school administrator will\nchoose to call the police in order to discipline students will fall, and police will\nbecome involved in school discipline more frequently. The specific idea that SROs\nhave \"criminalized\" behavior that would previously have been informally dealt with\nby school administrators is the School-to-Prison Pipeline.\nAt the same time, an important component of the SRO idea, as laid out in the\nOmnibus Crime Control Act of 1968, is to normalize police officers to students\nwho might not typically interact with law enforcement officials, and to promote\ntrust between young people and the officers who serve them in their commu-\nnity. Consistent with this official goal, SROs frequently serve a number of nondis-\nciplinary functions, including teaching classes, developing emergency response\nplans, and working with students and faculty to develop ideas to improve school\nsafety.\nIf SROs are seen as a positive part of the school community, and develop trusting\nrelationships with students, SROs may be associated with higher arrest rates, but\nnot because misbehavior is being criminalized. If students (and teachers) who are\nexposed to SROs view police officers as friendly, helpful people who are interested\nin protecting rather than persecuting them, students may become more likely to\nnotify SROs (or police in general) when they observe a crime. Schools can be dan-\ngerous places for young people; violent crimes by young people tend to increase\nwhen school is in session (Jacob & Lefgren, 2003), and students between 12 and\n18 years old experience more victimizations in school than out of school (Robers\net al., 2014). At the same time, roughly 63 percent of crimes occurring in schools are\nnot reported to law enforcement by school officials; underreporting is even higher\nfor violent crimes, where 74 percent are unrecorded by police. This difference in\n6 Unlike other COPS programs, school districts were eligible for CIS grants, which would be used to buy\ntime from the local law enforcement agency. Eight colleges, none of which are in the NIBRS sample,\nreceived CIS funding. In robustness tests, I assign CIS officers to an agency based on the total number of\nCIS officers granted to all agencies in a county, which would include CIS grants made to school districts.\nResults, available on request, are essentially the same as those presented here.\nPublished on behalf of the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management\n16 / Testing the School-to-Prison Pipeline\nreporting is due primarily to low reporting of fights where no weapons are involved\nand high reporting of drug offenses (Robers et al., 2014). Overall, in 2012 young\npeople between the ages of 12 and 17 reported roughly 16 percent of their own\nviolent victimizations to police, one-third the rate in the general population.7 To\nthe extent that some fraction of those involved in unreported incidents should have\nbeen referred to the justice system, increasing reporting rates can protect victims\nand lower crime in the long run. Indeed, a handful of small surveys about stu-\ndent perceptions of SROs tend to find that students, particularly non-delinquent\nstudents, generally view SROs favorably, especially relative to police officers they\nCritically for my analysis, positive relationships between SROs and students would\nreduce any stigma cost of reporting, but unlike the School-to-Prison Pipeline, this\nshould increase the reporting of all crime, not just crimes that occur in schools.\nComparing the rates at which police officers learn about crimes occurring in and\nout of schools can therefore be used to differentiate between improved community\nrelationships, which would tend to increase all reporting, and simple relabeling of\nmisbehavior, which would increase reporting in schools only.\nDATA\nThe central component of the data used in this analysis is grant-level data on all\na total of 6,631 SRO positions were funded by the COPS office through over 3,000\nthree-year grants; this is much smaller than the UHP program, which funded over\nUsing the law enforcement identifiers (ORIs) of grant recipients, I merge this in-\nformation with data on police employment records from three sources. The Uniform\nCrime Reports Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted (LEOKA) reports the\nnumber of sworn officers employed as of October 1 in each year between 1997 and\n2007. While there is no information on what the officers do, these data are annual,\nand cover close to the universe of all law enforcement agencies. Specific information\non SRO employment is recorded in the Law Enforcement Management and Admin-\nistrative Statistics (LEMAS). LEMAS data record operating statistics for a random\nand earlier) or September (in 2007). In these five LEMAS waves, I was able to pos-\nitively identify the number of COPS grants awarded to 3,960 agencies who served\nonce.\nUsing the county where the CIS recipient is located, I then linked the COPS\nwhich allows me to examine the impact of CIS grants on the probability that local\nschools hire security guards. Unlike in the LEOKA or LEMAS, CIS grants in this case\nwill generate what is essentially an intent-to-treat effect--I estimate the maximum\nnumber of CIS grants per 10,000 county residents that could have been directed\ntoward a school in the SSOCS by calculating the total number of active CIS grants\nin a given month in a given county, and taking the average monthly value during the\nmonths that school was in session. Roughly one-fourth of the schools in the SSOCS\n7 Bureau of Justice Statistics, \"Number of violent victimizations by reporting to police and age, 2010-\n2012.\" Generated using the NCVS Victimization Analysis Tool at www.bjs.gov.\nPublished on behalf of the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management\nTesting the School-to-Prison Pipeline / 17\nare located in counties that received CIS grants, which were roughly 0.18 officers\nper 10,000 county residents on average. Like the LEMAS, each wave of the SSOCS\nis a nationally representative sample of just over 2,500 of primary and secondary\nschools, and only a small fraction of schools (fewer than 200) are surveyed more\nthan once, meaning the assumptions required to draw causal statements about CIS\ngrants are stronger than those using longitudinal data.\nWith this important limitation in mind, the SSOCS data form my first source\nof data on how SROs affect the school environment and school administrators,\ntypically principals, are asked to report the number of behavioral incidents that\noccurred in the most recent school year. I aggregate these behaviors into four cate-\ngories: violent crimes (rape, sexual battery, robbery, assault, and threats), property\noffenses (theft and vandalism), drug offenses (drugs or alcohol found on students),\nor weapons charges (guns or knives). The SSOCS also asks school administers\nabout incidents that were \"reported to police or other law enforcement.\" The survey\ninstrument does not clarify whether or not notifying the SRO (or other sworn\nofficer who works in the school) about an incident qualifies it as \"reported to law\nenforcement,\" or if \"reported to law enforcement\" means that the administrator\nherself contacted external local law enforcement by, for example, calling 9-1-1.\nHowever, comparing the change in crimes the school administrator considers\nreported to the police relative to the crime rate that she is aware of can provide\nsome complementary evidence about the change in formalization of discipline in\nschools that hire more security guards.\nI more precisely measure crimes reported to police and arrests made using the\nand can be thought of as a more detailed version of the Uniform Crime Reports\n(UCR).8 In large part because of the enhanced data collection requirements of the\nNIBRS, only a small fraction of law enforcement agencies participate. Roughly\n17,000 law enforcement agencies report crime and arrest data to the UCR, but\nparticipated in 1997. NIBRS agencies tend to be small; none of the 15 largest cities\nin the United States are represented in the NIBRS. For each of the 4,084 police\nhow many active COPS grants that agency was handling in each month between 1997\nan NIBRS agency, which is roughly proportional to the overall NIBRS participation\nrate by law enforcement agencies.\nFor all criminal acts associated with each criminal incident recorded in the NI-\nBRS, I identified whether or not the crime took place in a school or college and what\ntype of crime it was (violent, property, a drug offense, or a weapon law violation). I\nthen further divided those crimes by characteristics of the people arrested in asso-\nciation with that criminal incident, if any arrest was made. Arrestees under the age\nof 15 are classified as \"minors,\" and arrestees between 15 and 19 as \"young adults.\"\n8 The NIBRS data are organized in six different files, each corresponding to a different unit of analysis:\nan administrative file, an incident-level file, a property file, an arrest-level file, an offender-level file, and\na victim-level file. Each file contains multiple characteristics of each Part 1 or Part 2 crime associated\nwith a criminal incident. Each year, the University of Michigan's ICPSR staff consolidates each of the\nsix files into one extract, where the unit of observation is a crime incident, and characteristics of up\nto three offenders, three victims, three criminal acts, and three arrestees are recorded. In contrast, the\nUCR records only the number of most serious Part 1 criminal acts that the agency knows about (one per\ncriminal event), and number of people arrested in a way that is generally reliable at the annual level.\n9 I have also included CIS officers awarded to organizations in the particular agency's county. Including\nthese county officers does not change my results, and CIS officers awarded to other county departments\ntypically have no effect on arrests or crimes known to police.\nPublished on behalf of the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management\n18 / Testing the School-to-Prison Pipeline\nI then created a monthly data set that recorded the total number of criminal acts\nthat police knew about, by whether or not the crime took place in school or out of\nschool, along with the total number of individual arrests made by the police, based\non whether or not the underlying crime took place in or out of school, and the age\nof the person arrested.\nI supplement my criminal justice data with two sets of variables that are plausible\ncorrelated both with local crime and with the propensity of the school to hire, or\napply for, a CIS grant. County-level measures of school resources are drawn from\nthe National Center for Education Statistics Common Core of Data, and include the\nschool district revenue per resident between the ages of 5 and 19, the number of\ncounty residents between the ages of 5 and 19 per school, the number of high school\ngraduates per county resident between the ages of 15 and 19, and the number of\nstudents per teacher. These variables are updated in September of each year. In ad-\ndition, annual information on county-level demographic information is drawn from\nCensus Bureau intercensal and small area income and poverty estimates, specifi-\ncally the overall and child poverty rate, the log of real median household income, the\npercentage of county residents who are nonwhite, and the percentage of children\nbetween the ages of 15 and 19 who are nonwhite.\nTables 1 and 2 summarize some basic facts about crime, arrests, and the local\njurisdictions of law enforcement agencies in the data. In terms of crimes, particu-\nlarly crimes in school, agencies that receive CIS grants are worse off than agencies\nthat do not; overall official crime rates are higher for agencies that receive federal\nfunding, although principals are less likely to say that students live in \"high-crime\"\nneighborhoods. Even relative to the general community, CIS agencies seem to serve\nschools that are disproportionately more dangerous than schools where agencies\ndo not receive funding; school crimes make up a larger fraction of overall offenses\nin all crime categories, and school surveys reflect this as well. CIS agencies also\nreceived more UHP and technology grants (Making Officer Redeployment Effec-\ntive, or MORE grants) than non-CIS agencies, consistent with one of the important\nmechanisms determining the timing and size of grants described in Evans and\nOwens (2007): the COPS office was relatively aggressive about distributing money\nto agencies that had demonstrated the ability to successfully spend grant money in\nthe past.\nTurning to school quality, districts associated with CIS agencies also appear to\nbe worse off than non-CIS districts on some dimensions; revenue per potential\nstudent is lower and there are more students per school. At the same time, other\ncommon schooling measures are better in CIS districts. The student-teacher ra-\ntio is slightly lower in CIS districts, and there is the same number of high school\ngraduates per young adult in both places. CIS agencies are also located in coun-\nties that have lower poverty rates, higher median income, and more white resi-\ndents than non-CIS agencies. The SSOCS also does not clearly identify schools\nin CIS counties as systematically different; there are slightly more minority stu-\ndents, English-language learners, and poor test takers in school that receive CIS\ngrants, but otherwise the principals' assessments of the students are similar across\ngroups.\nIn Figure 1, I plot the mean number of monthly offenses, in and out of school,\nreported by agencies that did and did not receive CIS grants. I also indicate the\nearliest date at which an agency could have received a CIS grant (April of 1999).\nEven though total crime in the United States is falling during this time period, there\nis a slow drift upward in crime among all agencies, reflecting growing coverage\nof higher-crime areas in the NIBRS data over time. There is some evidence of a\nsmall increase in officially recorded crime in schools that received CIS officers,\nPublished on behalf of the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management\nTesting the School-to-Prison Pipeline / 19\nAll agencies\nCIS agencies\nNon-CIS agencies\nMean SD Mean SD Mean SD\nAgency measures\nCounty measures\nSchool revenue per population\nHigh school grads per\nPublished on behalf of the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management\n20 / Testing the School-to-Prison Pipeline\nTable 1.

Turning to more minor offenses, CIS agencies appear to make slightly more arrests\nfor drug offenses relative to non-CIS agencies after 1999, for crime committed on and off of school\ngrounds. This somewhat similar pattern may imply that the increase in 15- to 19-year-olds being arrested\nfor drug offenses in school may reflect an increased propensity of people to report these types of offenses\nto police, rather than a lowering of the culpability threshold. Finally, Figures A11 and A12 present the\narrest rates for weapons offenses, in and out of school, by age. While the base rates are low, there is a\nclear increase in the rate at which minors are being arrested for weapons charges among CIS agencies,\nbut only on school grounds. There is also some increase among older children, and for the people of\nall ages. All appendices are available at the end of this article as it appears in JPAM online.

For\npurposes of tractability, I focus on total crime and total arrests, along with violent\ncrimes and arrests for violent crimes from the NIBRS, as well as those on school\ngrounds. Agency-specific trends in these same variables are estimated from a set of\n1,308 agency-specific regressions of each of these variables on 12-month dummies\nand a linear time trend, the form of which follows equation (2):\nOutcomemy\n=  + m\n+ Timemy\n+ my\nFigures 1 and 2, along with Tables 1 and 2, suggest that these average values are\nlikely to be correlated with the number of CIS officers an agency receives, and in\na cross-sectional setting would introduce bias into estimates of the impact of CIS\ngrants on officially recorded crime and arrests. However, in a panel data setting like\nthe current one, these time-invariant characteristics can be differenced out with an\nagency-specific fixed effect. On the other hand, if trends--my estimated values of \nfrom equation (2)--in these observed factors were predictive of COPS generosity,\nthen this would raise concerns that unobserved, time-varying agency characteris-\ntics correlated with officially recorded crimes and arrests also systematically varies\nacross agencies that did and did not receive grants. The estimated coefficients of\nequation (1) are in Appendix Table A1.12 Overall, these levels and trends explain\nonly 6 percent of the variation in CIS awards, and while I am able to easily reject\nthe null hypothesis that average values of demographic, education, and crime vari-\nables cannot jointly predict CIS grants (the F-statistic is 3.34, with a p-value of 0), I\ncannot reject the null hypothesis that trends in these values (or just the crime and\narrest variables) are unrelated to the total amount of SROs granted to an agency\nConsistent with Evans and Owens (2007), who examined different grants made by\nthe same federal agency, local law enforcement agencies that received CIS grants\nwere obviously different from those that did not, but there is no clear evidence of\nsystematic trends in observable school, and demographic, or crime differences in\ncities that did or did not receive these grants. As a result, CIS grants can be used\nto estimate the impact of these particular officers on crime, in a way that will not\nbe subject to the omitted variable and reverse causality bias that would arise from\nsimply comparing schools with and without SROs.\nI therefore use a simple difference-in-difference strategy to estimate the rela-\ntionship between SROs and criminal justice outcomes, where those outcomes are\nmodeled as follows:\nCrimeipscym\n= pym\n+ sy\n+ i\n+ Xcym\n + Ycy\n + Zipscym\n\n+CopsInSchoolsipscym\n + ipscym\n12 All appendices are available at the end of this article as it appears in JPAM online.

The parameter of interest, , represents the marginal impact of receiving\na grant for one additional CIS officer from the COPS office that was active in year y\nand month m. I allow for arbitrary seasonality in crime that is common to agencies\ndummies pym\n, along with annual shocks to crime that are common to all agencies\nin the same state,  sy\n, and a level difference in the crime rate of each agency i\n. I also\nallow for arbitrary variation in ipscym\nwithin a law enforcement agency by clustering\nat the agency level.\nFinally, I include a measure of the number of active COPS grants that agency i\nreceived in year y and month m. I focus on the two largest programs, the COPS\nUHP and Making Officer Redeployment Effective Program. Consistent with Evans\nand Owens (2007), these variables are lagged by one year as the receipt of the grant\ninvolved substantial hiring, training, and investment on the part of the receiving\nagency.\nMy identification of  is therefore based on month-to-month within-agency vari-\nation in crime and arrests that is correlated with the receipt of CIS grants, but is not\ncorrelated with any variation in the demographics of the areas the agency patrols,\nor in changes in school expenditures or standard measures of school quality. My\nfixed effect specification differences out unobserved time-varying features common\nto agencies of similar size (e.g., changes in \"best practices\" recommendations from\nnational advisory agencies) or in the same state (e.g., changes in the age of majority).\nOf course, I cannot rule out the presence of other unobserved time-variant shocks,\nbut since graphical and regression analysis of pretreatment trends failed to uncover\nsystematic variation across agencies that did and did not receive CIS grants, any\nsuch unobserved factors must have been introduced after 1999, when the first CIS\ngrant was awarded.\nRESULTS\nCIS Grants and Police Employment\nBefore examining the impact of CIS grants on crime, I am able to shed some light on\nthe impact of CIS grants on police employment by presenting estimates of equation\n(3), where the outcome variable is officer employment. I measure officer employ-\nment in four ways. First, using the sample of law enforcement agencies reporting\nto the NIBRS, I estimate the impact of receiving a grant on the total number of\nsworn police officers, as measured in the UCR. The UCR reports the total number\nof sworn officers employed by the police agency as of October 7 of each year, which\nincludes all employees with arrest powers, from beat officer to chief. While total\nofficer employment is a noisy measure of the number of SROs hired, I am able\nto observe this value for each agency in every year in my sample, allowing me to\nestimate the impact of CIS grants on employment conditional on a relatively rich\nset of observables and a full set of time and agency fixed effects.\nMy next source of information on police officer employment is the LEMAS. The\noverlap between the LEMAS and NIBRS is not very large; all police agencies with\nmore than 100 sworn officers are surveyed in every LEMAS round, and only a\nrepresentative sample of smaller agencies, which are more likely to be represented\nin the NIBRS, are included in each LEMAS survey. While the LEMAS measures\nthe outcome variable of interest with precision, the repeated cross-sectional nature\nPublished on behalf of the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management\n26 / Testing the School-to-Prison Pipeline\nof the data limits my ability to use a full set of fixed effects. The SSOCS data\non placement of SROs are even more limited; identification of the impact of CIS\nofficers on SRO school staffing in this sample relies on law enforcement agencies\nthat receive CIS grants and then decide to place an SRO in a school that happens to\nbe selected in the nationally representative SSOCS sample.\nThese estimates are presented in Table 3. Each additional CIS officer granted was\nassociated with 1.5 (se = 0. 86) additional officers being hired, a large effect that is\nstatistically significant at the 10 percent level.13 In contrast, agency response to UHP\ngrants was a smaller, but much more precisely estimated 1.11 officers per award\n(se = 0.412). Agencies that received grants for technology and support staff also\nincreased slightly in size, with roughly 0.13 additional officers (se = 0.051) being\nhired for each million dollars awarded through MORE (the average MORE grant\nwas roughly $65,000).14 The large, but somewhat imprecisely estimated, relationship\nbetween CIS grants and total officer employment is consistent with the institutional\ndifferences across COPS grant programs. UHP grants were explicitly to hire new\nofficers. CIS grants, on the other hand, were intended to support the salary of an\nofficer who was stationed in a local school. Complying with a CIS grant does not\nnecessarily require hiring more police officers, but the shift in officer deployment\ncould lead to agencies petitioning their local government to increase their overall\nofficer complement.\nIn the next columns of Table 3, I present estimates of the impact of CIS grants on\nSRO employment in the LEMAS, both in terms of the number of SROs per 10,000\nresidents and the fraction of officers in the police department that are stationed\nin schools. When I do not include agency fixed effects, receiving one additional\nCIS officer almost doubles the number of SROs (0. 624 additional SROs per CIS\nofficer granted, se = 0.068) an agency employs within one month. When I limit my\nidentification to the 363 agencies (about 10 percent of the total sample) that I observe\nboth with and without a grant, one additional CIS officer is associated with 0.385\n(se = 0.118) additional SROs, a 58 percent increase, within one month. Roughly 4\npercent of sworn officers in LEMAS are SROs, and on average, a CIS officer will\nincrease that fraction by 2 to 3 percentage points, which is also consistent with\nagencies hiring new officers to fill these positions (or replacing experienced officers\nwho become SROs), rather than simply reshuffling existing employees. There is\nessentially no relationship between other COPS grants and SRO employment.\n13 Finn and McDevitt (2005) report that roughly one year passes between the receipt of a CIS grant\nand the employment of a new SRO officer, but they do not appear to formally test this assertion. This\none-year lag in officer deployment does appear to be the case for UHP grants, the general hiring grants.\nHowever, in the NIBRS and LEMAS data, a strong one-year lagged response is not obviously a defining\ncharacteristic of agency responses to CIS grants. Lagging CIS grants by one year produces point estimates\nof the impact of CIS grants on police hiring that are roughly one half the size (0.61 police officers per\nlagged CIS officer), but also more precise (se = 0.148). Including both lagged and current CIS grants in\none equation suggests that the largest increase in the police force occurs when the grant is received, as\nthe coefficient on current grants is 1.5, and the coefficient on lagged grants is 0.096. When I look at SRO\nemployment in the LEMAS data, I cannot reject the null hypothesis that current and lagged CIS grants\nhave the same impact on SRO hiring.\n14 In results available on request, I reestimate the relationship between grants and officer employment for\nlaw enforcement agencies of increasingly larger size. Law enforcement agencies that served populations\nof less than 50,000 people tended to hire more police officers after receiving CIS grants, but in bigger\ncities appear to have been more likely to redeploy existing officers; in fact, police departments who served\nare consistently associated with expansions in the size of the police force, although the estimates become\nless precise as the sample size decreases. Compliance with UHP guidelines would also tend to depress\nthe relationship between UHP grants and employment. Officers hired under UHP are supposed to be\nretained for at least three years after the grant expires, and the majority of within-department variation\nin UHP officers granted in this time period is the expiration, rather than awarding, of UHP grants.\nPublished on behalf of the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management\nTesting the School-to-Prison Pipeline / 27\nSworn officers per\nSROs per sworn officer\nAny school security\nofficers\nYear fixed effects x x x x x x\nAgency/school fixed effects x x x\nState by year fixed effects x\nPop. size group fixed effects x\nNotes: Additional county-level controls in columns 1, and 3 through 7 include school district revenue per resident under the age of 20 ($2,010), residents under\n20 per public and charter school, high school graduates per resident under 20, school district teacher to student ratio, poverty rate, children poverty rate, median\nincome ($2010), percentage nonwhite, and percentage of residents under 20 who are nonwhite.

I\npool all three waves of data, and in lieu of school fixed effects (only 7 percent of\nschools are surveyed more than once), use school-level, as opposed to county- or\nagency-level, control variables and cluster my observations at the county level in\nthese regressions.15 The typical CIS grant to agencies in the county where a sur-\nveyed school is located (roughly 0.18 officers per 10,000 residents) is associated\nwith 0.7 percentage point increase (se = 0.2) in the probability that a school admin-\nistrator in that county reports having paid security or law enforcement, roughly 1\npercent relative to the sample mean. This relatively small effect is not surprising,\nas the practical link between county-level CIS grant receipt and security staff in\nany given school is probabilistic at best. However, there is essentially no relation-\nship between UHP grants and school security, which does provide some evidence\nthat CIS grants are influencing school staffing decisions, rather than simply be-\ning correlated with trends in underlying crime, police staffing, or local government\nCIS Grants, School Safety, and Reported Crime\nAfter showing that CIS grants are associated with an increase in SRO employment\nat the police agency level, and also an increase in the presence of security in local\nschools, I now turn to the reduced form impacts of these grants on the school envi-\nronment. If SROs promote trust between officers and young people and encourage\nthem to report crimes that previously would have gone unreported and unpunished,\nwe would expect CIS grants to be associated with more officially reported crimes in\nand out of school, and also potentially more arrests associated with those crimes.\nAlternately, if SROs simply relabel misbehavior at school as crime, we would expect\nto see an increase in officially recorded crimes and arrests in school, but not outside\nschool. The relabeling of disruptive behavior as crime warranting an arrest should\nalso only affect young people, whereas improved community relationships could\nplausibly lead to more arrests of people of all ages. Of course, both of these mech-\nanisms implicitly assume that the presence of SROs does not alter the behavior of\nstudents--to the extent that SROs actually deter criminal behavior, we may see a\nreduction in actual crimes.\nSurvey Data on School Safety\nMy estimates of the impact of CIS officers on different dimensions of crime in\nschools are presented in Table 4. I begin with survey data on the number of violent\nor property incidents, along with the number of times intoxicants (drugs or alcohol)\nor weapons were found on students. As in the previous table, I define my CIS variable\nas the average number of officers subsidized by CIS in the county where the school\nwas located, during the months that school was in session. In contrast with existing\nresearch, I find evidence that CIS officers increase school safety; administrators in\ncounties with more CIS officers are less likely to report all types of incidents, and\n15 Adding random school effects, not surprisingly, generates essentially identical estimates. The SSOCS\nalso asks survey respondents whether or not security is provided by sworn law enforcement (roughly\n45 percent say yes). There is a positive, but highly imprecise, relationship between CIS grants and an\naffirmative response to this question.\n16 No MORE grants were awarded during the time when the SSOCS survey was conducted, so I do not\ninclude these in the model.\nPublished on behalf of the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management\nTesting the School-to-Prison Pipeline / 29\nTable 4.

Standard errors in parenthesis\nallow for arbitrary correlation in dependent variable within agency (2,310 clusters).\nthe reductions in violent, property, and weapons offenses would occur less than 10\npercent of the time under the null hypothesis of no impact.17 In terms of magnitudes,\n17 This pattern of point estimates is decidedly different from Na and Gottfredson (2013). Two differences\nare important to point out: Na and Gottfredson focused on the subset of schools surveyed more than\nonce, and estimate the effect of SROs and police officers only. I pool all schools across waves (save for\na small number with missing data) and am only able to identify a first stage in a framework where I\nPublished on behalf of the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management\n30 / Testing the School-to-Prison Pipeline\nI find that the average grant is associated with a 1.1 percent to 1.9 percent reduction\nin disruptive criminal incidents in school.\nAs shown in the second panel of Table 4, CIS grants are also associated with\nfewer crimes being reported to law enforcement, although the magnitude of the\nreductions is smaller in absolute value and is less precisely estimated, than the\nestimated reduction in actual behaviors.\nIn order to calculate whether or not this reduction in reported crime con-\nstitutes a change in the probability that a given crime is reported, I construct\nan implied change in reporting rate using a back-of-the-envelope calculation,\n[(1 + (Report CIS)\n)/(1 + (Crime CIS)\n)] \u00ad 1, where (Crime CIS)\nis my estimate of the per-\ncentage change in total crime associated with an average CIS grant, and (Reported CIS)\nis the similar change in reported crime.18 This calculation suggests that CIS grants\nare associated with small increases, a fraction of a percentage point, in the rate at\nwhich law enforcement is contacted about most school problems that do occur. The\nexception is disruptions involving drugs or alcohol, where that is one-fourth of a\npercentage point reduction in the probability that an administrator alerts the police.\nThese changes are also imprecisely estimated, and 95 percent confidence intervals\nfor each point estimate range from roughly \u00ad1.5 to 2 percentage points.\nOfficial Police Records of Crime\nSchool survey data suggest one real benefit of SROs is an increase in school safety.\nHowever, this increase in safety is not free; it is accompanied by a small increase\nin the probability that students who continue to engage in disruptive and harmful\nbehavior will come into contact with the formal criminal justice system, rather than\nthe principal's office. Whether or not police learn about more offenses when schools\nhave SROs can be directly tested with the NIBRS data.\nIn the third panel of Table 4, we observe that CIS grants are associated with\nstatistically significant increases in the number of officially recorded violent, drug,\nand weapons crimes taking place in schools, with effects sizes ranging from 12\nand 25 percent per CIS officer, or 2.1 percent and 4.3 percent increase in crimes\nassociated with a 10 percent increase in SROs. When compared to the school survey\nresults, this tells us that, even if school safety is increasing, the response to incidents\nthat do occur is such that, on net, police observe more offenses than before SROs\nwere put in place. This is particularly striking for violent and weapons offenses,\nallow for arbitrary correlation in outcomes for all schools within the same county, but not if I allow for\ntime invariant differences in each school. I also am only able to identify a statistically significant first\nstage in whether or not a school has any security staff, rather than in police officers or SROs specifically.\nFocusing on exogenous variation in the presence of security, rather than the addition of law enforcement\nin schools, yields opposite conclusions about the impact of these officers on safety, with most crimes\nweakly falling rather than weakly increasing. In Appendix Table A2, I compare OLS estimates of the\nrelationship between security staff and crime with 2SLS estimates generated by variation in CIS grants\nacross schools and over time. While the 2SLS estimates are generally too imprecise to draw strong\nconclusions, focusing on credibly exogenous variation reverses the direction of the estimated impact of\nschool security officers for every type of crime.

Both percentages are evaluated at the mean crime rate\nand the mean positive value of CIS officers granted, 0.185. Standard errors are estimated with the delta\nmethod. Estimating the change in reporting rate directly via regression is complicated by the large\nnumber of missing observations due to no reported crimes. This back-of-the-envelope calculation based\non mean estimates avoids this problem, and generates results that are similar in sign to a regression\napproach.\nPublished on behalf of the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management\nTesting the School-to-Prison Pipeline / 31\nwhere one additional CIS officer is associated with 0.333 (se = 0.192) fewer violent\nincidents and 0.016 (se = 0.008) fewer weapons violations as reported by principals,\nviolations known to police. The magnitude of both reductions would be observed\nless than 10 percent of the time under the null hypothesis of no relationship between\nCIS officers and this outcome, and the increases in offenses known to police would\nboth be observed less than 5 percent of the time under the same null hypothesis.\nIn the fourth panel of Table 4, I examine whether or not this change in the\nformal response to crime occurs off school grounds as well. While the point esti-\nmates on crimes taking place outside school suggest that hiring SROs might in-\ncrease police awareness of all crimes, only the 10 percent increase (in the reduced\nform) in awareness of drug crimes is statistically significant at conventional levels\n(p = 0.09).19 It is noteworthy that this is consistent with SROs learning about the\nexistence of local drug markets from students who are caught with drugs in school;\na student committing a violent offense, or bringing a weapon to school, does not\nnecessarily have information about off-campus crimes.\nSetting precision aside, in percentage terms I estimate a 12 percent increase in\npolice knowledge of property offenses both on and off school grounds. This equiva-\nlence in effect size is consistent with, in some jurisdictions at least, SROs learning\nabout more property crimes because school-aged children are more likely to talk to\nthe police generally. However, I do not find evidence that this is a general effect; for\nviolent and drug offenses, the increase in awareness of crimes on school grounds\nis about a third larger than the increased awareness of crimes in the community\n(11 percent versus 14 percent), and the increased awareness of weapons offenses\non campus is almost five times larger than the increased awareness of guns in the\nneighborhood. Unlike the more general UHP hiring grants distributed by the COPS\noffice, which were associated with both lower crime and lower arrest rates (Evans\n& Owens, 2007; Owens, 2013), the increases in school safety associated with SROs\nmay have come at a much larger cost.\nCIS Grants and Arrests\nIn Table 5, I examine how police agencies that receive CIS grants make arrests for\nviolent crimes, based on where the crime occurred and how old the person arrested\nwas. Since not all arrests of people under the age of 18 result in formal processing,\nI also examine the impact of CIS grants on the rate at which people are actually\nbooked, rather than informally handled (e.g., by calling the juvenile's parents), both\nof which are recorded in the data.\nNot only do police learn of more crimes in schools, they also make more arrests\nfor these offenses. Each additional CIS officer is associated with 0.025 (se = 0.014)\nadditional arrests being made, or roughly one additional charge every four and a\nhalf school years. A 21 percent increase (se = 0.098) in the arrests of minors, children\nunder the age of 15, is driving this--agencies that receive a grant for one CIS officer\nper 10,000 residents arrest one additional person under the age of 15 every year, and\nthree additional children every two school years. The marginal minor arrested also\nappears to be formally booked, rather than simply referred to their parents. I do\nnot observe any consistent change in arrest rates for violent crime that takes place\n19 The relationship between crime and county demographics are generally consistent with a priori as-\nsumptions; counties with less school revenue per young person have higher crime rates, as do places with\nmore children in poverty, more nonwhite children, and lower median income. Consistent with Owens\n(2013), there are more officially recorded Part 2 offenses (drug and weapons charges) when an agency\nreceives UHP grants. I do not report these results for sake of space.\nPublished on behalf of the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management\n32 / Testing the School-to-Prison Pipeline\nIn school Out of school\nTotal arrests\nViolent Property Drugs Weapons Violent Property Drugs Weapons\nYoung adults (15 to 19 years old)--total arrests\nYoung adults (15 to 19 years old)--arrested and booked\nMinors (7 to 14 years old)--total arrests\nMinors (7 to 14 years old)--arrested and booked\nNotes: All regressions contain 218,244 observations, and include agency fixed effects, month by popu-\nlation size group fixed effects, and state by year fixed effects.

Standard errors\nin parenthesis allow for arbitrary correlation in dependent variable within agency (2,310 clusters).\noutside schools, although in percentage terms, the imprecise point estimates are\nactually larger; this suggests that, relative to arrests in schools, there is potentially a\nfair amount of heterogeneity in how police officers interact with youth more broadly\nafter SROs are hired.\nI also find that while police do not appear to learn of any additional property\ncrimes when they receive CIS grants, they do make more arrests for property of-\nfenses, particularly those that occur on school grounds, roughly 0.02 additional\ncharges (se = 0.01) per CIS officer granted (or about 0.04 per SRO). CIS grants\ndo not appear to help police departments make arrests for off-campus property\ncrimes. Again, however, the increase in arrests is due to an increase in the number\nof children under 15. Each additional CIS officer is associated with 0.07 arrests (se\nformal bookings (se = 0.028).

These grants also appear to allow officers to make more arrests\nfor drug crimes, although in percentage terms the increase in arrests for on-campus\ndrug crimes is always larger. The people being arrested for drug crimes appear to\nbe older than those arrested for violent or property crimes; there are statistically\nsignificant increases in the arrest rates for 15- to 19-year-olds on and off school\nMinors under the age of 15 are more likely to be arrested for drug crimes in school\nwhen agencies receive CIS grants, but there is no clear increase in formal bookings\nor off-campus arrests for drugs among this age group. To the extent that 14-year-\nolds are less likely to sell drugs than young adults, and that students may buy their\ndrugs from slightly older peers, this pattern of arrests is additional evidence that\nSROs learn about ancillary drug crimes in the community from interacting with,\nand sometimes arresting, students in the schools they patrol.\nLaw enforcement officials both learn of, and make more arrests for, weapons\nviolations in schools when they receive CIS grants. However, unlike other crimes,\nthe age of those arrested suggests that adults, rather than children, are more likely\nto be arrested for having a weapon on school grounds. I observe that each addi-\ntional CIS officer granted is associated with a moderately significant 0.007 increase\n(se = 0.004) in the number of arrests for weapons violations on school grounds a\nmonth. However, I do not observe a statistically significant increase in the in-school\narrest rates for weapons violations by young adults or minors.\nTaken as a whole, the data imply that law enforcement agencies that place offi-\ncers in schools learned about more criminal offenses on school grounds. They also\nmade more arrests, and in particular arrests of young people for crimes on campus,\nincluding many students less than 15 years old. The observed arrest patterns suggest\nthat, even when endogenous hiring of SROs is addressed, adding police officers to\nschools results in more children being arrested and does not obviously increase the\nlikelihood that young people contact officers about crime in their community, on\naverage. The exception to this is drug charges, where police do appear to be able to\nidentify and arrest more young adults for off-campus drug crimes.\nSchool Safety, Crime, and Arrests by County Demographics\nreport crimes to the police than white crime victims. However, black and Hispanic\nvictims who did not report a crime were more likely to cite mistrust of the police as\na reason (Langton et al., 2012). This is consistent with surveys of social attitudes,\nwhich typically find that minorities are less likely to place a great deal of trust in the\npolice as an institution.20 A highly relevant policy question, therefore, is whether\nor not there is systematic variation in the relationship among SROs, school safety,\nand officially recorded crimes in areas with more nonwhite people. Heterogeneity\nin the impact of SROs on police-community relations may also explain the large,\nbut imprecise, impact of CIS officers on off-campus policing.\nThe SSOCS and NIBRS data provide suggestive, but ultimately inconclusive, ev-\nidence that CIS officers may actually improve police-community relationships in\n20 For example, see the National Institute of Justice introduction to Race, Trust and Police Legitimacy,\nhttp://www.nij.gov/topics/law-enforcement/legitimacy/Pages/welcome.aspx.\nPublished on behalf of the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management\n34 / Testing the School-to-Prison Pipeline\nplaces with larger black and Hispanic populations. Estimating equation (3) in sub-\nsamples of SSOCS and NIBRS data (based on the average percentage of young adults\nwho are nonwhite) yields effects of CIS officers on crimes, as well as arrests, out-\nside of school that are qualitatively larger in places with more minorities. However,\nthe estimates are statistically indistinguishable from one another. The relationship\nbetween CIS officers and officially recorded crimes in school, as well as reports of\ncrimes by principals, is more constant across jurisdictions, although there may be\nless of a deterrent effect of CIS officers in schools with more minority students.\nAppendix Figures A13 through A15 present the standardized effect sizes, along with\n95 percent confidence intervals, for jurisdictions with increasingly larger black and\nHispanic populations.21 While these figures are consistent with the School-to-Prison\nPipeline being weaker in areas with larger minority populations, additional data on\nthe activities of SROs in urban and minority school districts will be necessary to\ndraw firmer conclusions.\nCONCLUSION\nadults, led to an expansion in the scope of law enforcement, with sworn police\nofficers replacing security guards in private buildings and in schools. The placement\nof police officers in schools, a practice that has been used in some school districts\nsince the 1960s, was promoted by the federal government as a way to both increase\nschool safety and also increase the chance that young adults, who rarely report\ncrime to police officers, saw police in general as trustworthy and helpful. Today, as\ncrime rates have fallen, and the racially disparate impact of anticrime laws passed\nin the 1990s has become better known, there has been a growing concern that\nSROs simply create a School-to-Prison Pipeline, where young people are arrested\nfor behavior that previously would simply result in school discipline.\nTo date, evidence on the impact of SROs on crime and arrests has been limited\nto correlational studies that fail to address any bias generated by the simultaneous\ndetermination of school problems and SRO employment. Using credibly exogenous\nvariation in SROs generated by DOJ hiring grants, I find that adding officers to\nschools appears to increase both school safety and police involvement in violent,\ndrug, and weapons violations on school grounds, with some additional awareness\nof drug crimes and serious violent offenses happening in the community at large. I\nobserve an increase in arrests that take place in schools when SROs are added. Even\nthough people under 15 make up only a small fraction of those arrested, increases\nin arrest rates for children under the age of 15 are the most precisely estimated,\nadditional charges per 10,000 minors being filed for in-school crimes in each school\nyear. In addition, I find that arrests are for violent crimes that could be reasonably\ncharacterized as scuffling, rather than acts of life-threatening violence.\nIntroducing police officers into schools does appear to change the dynamics of\nthe school environment, and does lead to an increase in the arrest rates of young\nchildren, particularly for minor offenses that happen to occur on school grounds.\nAt the same time, there is some evidence to suggest that these officers can have a\npositive effect on the ability of local police to do their jobs outside of the school day,\nparticularly when it comes to disrupting drug markets or making arrests for serious\n21 Estimating the change in reporting rate directly via regression is complicated by the large number of\nmissing observations due to no reported crimes.

In addition, the largest increases in crime reporting off campus\noccur in communities with fewer white people. The nature of available data on SRO\nemployment and police activity limits my ability to draw strong conclusions about\nthe underlying mechanisms of these observed changes, or extrapolate to larger,\nmore urban jurisdictions with larger minority populations. Future research that\nmore precisely quantifies the effect that CIS grants have on the employment of\nSROs, along with the increased availability of location-specific crime data, will help\nclarify these issues.\nDecisions about whether or not the benefit of school safety and improved police\nrelations outweigh the cost of criminal justice involvement of minors should be\nleft to policymakers in individual jurisdictions based on the specific needs of their\nlocality; summary estimates of the social cost of crimes are predicated on adult\nvictims, focusing on days of lost work and jury awards, and quantification of the\nimpacts of disrupted educational attainment and future criminal involvement for\nthose arrested are, to the best of my knowledge, currently not available. However,\nthe simple conclusion that SROs are always good or bad for school children is not\nsupported by the data.\nEMILY G.
