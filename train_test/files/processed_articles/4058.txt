Appraisal of events vis-\u00e0-vis concerns gives rise to a determinate motive\nto establish a specific state of the world; the pragmatic idea of the action's effects incurs the valuation of action options and a\nchange in action readiness in the form of incipient ideomotor capture of the selected action. Forward modeling of the sensory\nconsequences of the selected action option allows for the evaluation and fine-tuning of anticipated action effects, which renders\nthe emotional action impulsive yet purposive.

Although the motive (to do away with the itch) is not\nnecessarily a consciously set goal, the action (scratching) is pur-\nposive: it implements the aim of the motive that called it forth,\nnamely getting rid of the itch. One may or may not become\naware of the itch, or of the motive to get rid of it, or of the act of\nscratching. The action may be preceded by a consciousness of\nthe purpose to be attained, or may ensue without any premedita-\ntion. Hence, our view on emotion in action necessitates neither\na distinct mandate of the will, nor the presupposition of aware-\nness of the motive for action. An action may be emotional even\nif we are unable to render (or even understand) the words to\ndescribe the motive.\nAn emotional act, in contrast to a predetermined act, is deter-\nmined by its ultimate or proximate end. The motive of the action\nis its desired end state (Grafton & Hamilton, 2007; Sebanz,\nBekkering, & Knoblich, 2006). Emotional actions serve the pur-\npose of rendering one's relation to the state of the world more\npleasant or less unpleasant. Emotional actions are produced by\nmotives to alter the current state of the world so as to approxi-\nmate a more optimal state. These motives give rise to states of\naction readiness. As elaborated in Frijda's work, changes in\naction readiness form the key to what we call \"emotions,\" since\naction readiness covers the variations in self\u00adobject relation-\nare propelled by how a perceived (or recalled or imagined)\nobject or event is appraised by the individual. Appraisal of\nevents in the world imparts purpose by giving rise to a state of\naction readiness to change one's relation to its object. Emotional\naction deals with the present situation by correlating it with rel-\nevant concerns, and valuating the courses of action that will be\nmost likely to lead to its desired end. Predetermined actions are,\none might argue, ultimately also geared towards desirable states\nEmotion in Action: A Predictive Processing\nPerspective and Theoretical Synthesis\nK.

The difference is that such\nactions result from innate, hard-wired, or overlearned stimulus\u00ad\nresponse associations, without the intervening appraisal, motive,\nand readiness for action that characterizes emotional acts.\nBeyond being purposive, emotional actions comprise an\nimpetus for action--an inclination to do something--with a cer-\ntain strength or urgency. These dynamic and energetic aspects\nof emotional action have been caught under the designation of\ncontrol precedence of ongoing actions and strivings (Frijda,\nover time until a particular end state has been reached, and\nresumption of actions in spite of interruptions and obstacles.\nImportantly, emotional action entails some anticipatory\nimage of the effects of the action (Eder & Hommel, 2013; Eder\nIn order to predict action effects, interactive behavior is guided\nby pragmatic processes that embed sensorimotor coordination in\nprior knowledge and experiences (Gibson, 1979).

Forward models deliver predictions that help\ninterpret the sensory effects of one's actions, or those of others\n(Blakemore, Wolpert, & Frith, 2002; Desmurget & Grafton,\nPresent Aims\nIn what follows, we will study the mechanisms through which\nemotional action arises. We will see how principles of predic-\ntive processing map on the notions of incipient ideomotor cap-\nture and readiness for action, how motives are selected through\nappraisal, how action options are selected through valuation,\nand how the discrepancy between actual and desired action\neffects is mitigated through forward modeling. The notions of\npragmatic idea and incipient ideomotor capture will be found to\nconstitute cornerstones for emotion in action. These proposals\nare consistent with, on the one hand, Frijda's recent views on\nemotion vis-\u00e0-vis impulsive action (Frijda et al., 2014), and, on\nthe other hand, the principles and mechanisms of perception\u00ad\naction coordination laid out in a recent integrative theoretical\nframework (impetus, motivation, and prediction in perception\u00ad\naction coordination theory, or IMPPACT; Ridderinkhof, 2014).\nThe core mechanism for emotional action, as derived from these\npositions, is summarized in Figure 1, and will be detailed in\nwhat follows.\nWhile the IMPPACT framework may be relatively new,\nmany of the ideas in the model and the views on the mecha-\nnisms through which emotional action arises borrow heavily\nfrom views that have been voiced in the (often very old) litera-\nture. While some of these views have been central to theoretical\nviews on emotion, others are newly introduced into this context.\nA particularly novel contribution of this article will be to evalu-\nate the implications of introducing the forward model compo-\nnent, central to IMPPACT, for understanding emotional action.\nThus, this article aims at a synthesis that integrates previous\nwork and extends it with the notion of forward modeling. For\nsomewhat similar theoretical work and empirical support, we\nrefer the reader to recent work by Eder and colleagues (Eder &\nIngredients of Emotion in Action\nAppraisal\nEmotions are aroused by events: events as directly perceived, or\nas recollected, or even as imagined. Motives for emotional\naction are elicited by events as appraised. Appraisal refers to\nthe information that confers personal meaning to brute per-\nceived events, which is drawn from environmental stimuli plus\nAppraisal results from interactions between event properties on\nthe one hand and the individual's sensitivities to these properties\non the other. Appraisal identifies what relationship should be\nestablished or modified, and thus gives rise to a determinate\nmotive for action: whether or not something needs to be done\nabout it, and how urgently. Appraisal processes proceed largely\nautomatically, associatively, nonconsciously, and in a fraction\nTo illustrate: Incoming input (say, very loud heavy metal\nmusic) activates not only the features that represent the stimulus\nitself, but also (through rapidly spreading activation) all kinds\nof features that have, mostly through previous experience,\nbecome associated to the stimulus (such as concerns: a dislike\nfor loud sound, and a dislike for heavy metal, hypothetically\nspeaking). If a stimulus represents an \"actual state of the world\"\n(say, being exposed to loud heavy metal) then a course com-\nparison to associated concerns (dislike for loud music, dislike\nfor heavy metal) would, through simple and rapid computa-\ntions, lead to the activation of the features of a \"desired state of\nthe world\" (no loud music, no heavy metal).\nThe central appraisal is whether an event is assessed as pro-\nmoting or obstructing one's concerns (Ellsworth & Scherer,\npreferences, interests; to whatever affects the presence, availa-\nbility, or intactness of everything the individual cares about (cf.\nFrankfurt, 1988). Concerns can pertain to what the individual\nmay derive from the event (e.g., likely satisfaction or dissatis-\nfaction), or to opportunities for action (the action affordances\nprovided by the environment, given our expertise; Gibson,\n1979). Crucially, in the absence of concern pertinence, there is\nno motive, and no readiness to act; in short, no emotion (Frijda\nPragmatic Idea\nThe possibility of emotional acts, in which the response is deter-\nmined by the effect it will exert, arises with the power of antici-\npation, so that actions are directed by the relation between act\nand consequence (Ridderinkhof, 2014). The emotional act is\nRidderinkhof Emotion in Action 321\ndetermined by reference to a desired end; hence, we must be\nable to form some pragmatic idea which is capable of prompting\npurposive action (consciously or not).\nThe pivot upon which emotional action turns is the forma-\ntion of a pragmatic idea of the desired action effect. A pragmatic\nidea consists of images of kinesthetic sensation associated with\nthe action and its anticipated effects on the world and on our\nown body (Hobhouse, 1915). An environmental object or event\nmay be perceived as presenting a specific action affordance,\nsoliciting activation of the corresponding motor program, with-\nout an agent's deliberate intention to act (Gr\u00e8zes & Decety,\n2002). The perceived affordance thus instigates an intention-in-\nPacherie, 2006). Indeed, pragmatic ideas of movement may\nactivate the descending motor pathways at subthreshold level\n(e.g., Tanaka, Balleine, & O'Doherty, 2008), and are in fact rou-\ntinely followed by discharges of their target muscles (Jacobsen,\nthe consequences of actions, not only in terms of sensory effects\nbut also in terms of outcomes that one can learn to pursue or\navoid. The results experienced after yielding to an impulse will\nassociate the impulse, in memory, with a foresight of those\nresults. \"An impulse acted out may be said to be acted out, in\nIncipient Ideomotor Capture\nWilliam James famously wrote \"We think the act, and it is done\"\nwere among the first to enunciate the notion that actions are\ninitiated by the anticipation of the desired sensory effects of the\nprojected action (for an historical analysis see Ridderinkhof,\n2014). Herbart proposed that when an action is executed, asso-\nciations are formed between the action and its sensory effects;\nthese associations can be used subsequently to initiate those\nactions that produce the desired action effects. M\u00fcller (1838)\nobserved that \"The idea of a particular motion determines a cur-\nrent of nervous action towards the necessary muscles, and gives\nFigure 1. Schematic architecture for ideomotor action according to the IMPPACT model. Stimuli and ideas (denoted by letters A, B, etc.) activate the\ncorresponding motor controllers (denoted by numbers 1, 2, etc.) via a series of ideomotor processes. Appraisal of the stimuli and ideas yields motives\nin the form of desired action effects (denoted by letters A'', B'', etc.). Action options (denoted by numbers 1'', 2'', etc.) are valued in terms of optimal\nopportunity for bringing about the desired action ends. The elected course of action captures the motor system incipiently before being executed in\nfull. Action effects (as perceived through exteroceptive senses) are fed into a comparator (symbolized by the purple-colored hexagon) to be compared\nagainst the desired action effects, giving rise (in case of discrepancy) to a prediction error (PE) which is used to revaluate and adjust the chose action\noption. (Adapted from Ridderinkhof, 2014.)\nrise to the motion independently of the will\" (p. 944). Some\nindividuals, when walking closely to the rim of a precipice,\nexperience the compulsion to jump off, as phrased by Bacon\n(1826): \"[F]or, imagining a fall, it putteth his spirit into the very\naction of a fall\" (p. 957). This conception was articulated more\ngenerally by Lotze (1852): \"As soon as an idea of an accessible\ngoal surfaces into memory, the unfolding action appears as\ndirected to that goal, seeking to approach it\" (p. 298). Carpenter\n(1853) labeled the notion that thinking of the effects of an action\ntends to set the action in motion as ideomotor (to distinguish it\nfrom sensorimotor action).\nThe pragmatic idea of a desired action effect can serve to\nretrieve the action that gives rise to the sensory effects associ-\nated with the appropriate action effect (Herwig, Prinz, &\nWaszak, 2007). The ideomotor principle thus holds that any\nactivation of the pragmatic idea of an action's effect may\nawaken the corresponding action. As James (1890) observed,\n\"The idea of the movement's sensory effects will have become\nan immediate antecedent condition to the production of the\nmovement itself\" (p. 586). However, such ideomotor action is\nonly incipient: \"The drive does not attain its goal just by itself,\nlike some physical power; it hardly exceeds beyond an aspira-\n297). The nascent ideomotor tendency may be left quiescent\nunless its motive power is sufficiently strong to solicit and cap-\nture the action in a maximum degree; the motive becomes motor\nonly when the nascent excitation becomes an unchecked\nChanges in Action Readiness\nIncipient ideomotor capture may thus remain limited to mere\npotentiations of the neural dispositions underlying the actions\nconcerned, without motor engagement (Frijda et al., 2014; van\nLoon, van den Wildenberg, van Stegeren, Hajcak, &\nRidderinkhof, 2010). Such states of action readiness are best\ndescribed as states of readiness to establish, maintain, or modify\nsome self\u00adobject relationship; in other words, to prepare for\neffecting some action that reduces the discrepancy between our\ncurrent state and the desired state (Deonna & Teroni, 2012).\nChanges in action readiness are central to emotions (Frijda,\nThe term action readiness is borrowed from Dewey's theory\nof emotions (1895): \"When we say that John Smith is very\nresentful at the treatment he has received . . . we mean he is in a\ncertain practical attitude, has assumed a readiness to act in cer-\ntain ways\" (p. 17). Bull (1945) luminously extended the James\u00ad\nLange theory of the emotions (in which we do not cry because\nwe feel sorry, but feel sorry because we cry) by claiming that the\nsorry feeling results from readiness to cry, rather than from\nactually crying.\nWe feel angry as a result of readiness to strike, and feel afraid as a result\nof readiness to run away, and not because of actually hitting out or\nrunning . . . In other words, feeling, or affect, arises from preparatory\nattitudes, maintained as readiness or a wish, and held in leash pending\nthe lifting of whatever form of interfering mechanism is holding up the\nA state of action readiness may be felt by the agent as a non-\novert inclination, or experienced as a mental image of action\nValuation of Action Options\nGiven a specific motive for action, a person can avail herself of\na number of different alternative courses of action to accom-\nplish a modification in a particular self\u00adworld relationship,\nsuch as the riddance of an itch (Frijda, 1986). To offer a typical\nFrijdian example: When charmed by someone, one may utter\nendeared words, offer a rose, or try and steal a kiss in an attempt\nto draw or keep the charming person nearby; when running\naway in fear, one seeks to increase the distance to the danger\nsource, but one may also hide behind a protective barrier, or\nthrow an obstacle in front of the approaching threat (Frijda,\n2007). Action options are then evaluated in terms of their apt-\nness for bringing about these desired action effects. The vari-\nous action alternatives differ in their value with respect to both\ntheir cost (in terms of energy expenditure or financial endow-\nment) and their benefit (in bringing the actual state closer to the\ndesired state).\nAdequacy and efficacy of action alternatives scale with the\navailability of relevant skills or expertise (Rietveld, 2012). To\nthe skilled badminton opponent, appraisal of even a well-con-\ncealed crossed drop-shot may generate a relevant affordance for\nadequate nonreflective reaction which--without premeditation\nor further deliberation--renders a specific motive state, a readi-\nness to act, an adequate action impulse. By contrast, a lack of\nrelevant affordances may leave the novice stand \"frozen\"--that\nis, without an intent, without a concrete motive for action, with-\nout any action impulse (Frijda et al., 2014).\nThe ideomotor principle does not in itself entail a mecha-\nnism through which the motivational value of the outcome\ninfluences the selection of the best-suited action. Benefits need\nto be weighed against expenditure in a cost\u00adbenefit analysis (for\nreview see Schouppe, Demanet, Boehler, Ridderinkhof, &\nNotebaert, 2014). Computational approaches accomplish this\nintegration by modifying weights of alternative choices in pro-\nportion to reward prediction errors--that is, discrepancies\nbetween expected and actual outcomes. At the neurobiological\nlevel, such prediction errors are encoded by midbrain dopamine\nsignals (for review see Frank, Cohen, & Sanfey, 2009).\nValuation of action options is driven further by a comparison\nbetween desired and anticipated action effects. If this compari-\nson results in discrepancy, then the ensuing prediction error\n(PE) will serve to update the incentive value of the action option,\nresulting in value learning as an integrated part of repeated\naction emulation (for review see Ridderinkhof, 2014).\nForward Modeling of Action Effects\nWhen there is the idea of a desired end, the motive provides the\nimpetus to act. We direct effort to what we desire. Desire impreg-\nnates the emotional action with the sense of tension, and of effort\nto relief the tension by reducing the discrepancy between the\ncurrent state and the desired end (Lewin, 1926). When there is\nRidderinkhof Emotion in Action 323\nforesight of the ultimate end, the tension is relieved through pur-\nposive effort. The pragmatic idea of the required effort and of the\nmuscular exertion requisite to perform a certain movement is\nderived from the anticipatory image of the action's effects. But\nwhere does the anticipation, the foresight of the action effect\ncome from?\nEmotional action entails a further critical component: pre-\ndictive processing through forward modeling. The brain con-\ntinually generates and tests predictions to reduce uncertainty\nWithin this conjecture, predictive processing provides a neuro-\nbiological and computational framework for understanding\nemotional action, with forward modeling as a rapid means for\nverifying whether the projected action meets the desired end\n(see Figure 2). Forward models predict the sensory effects of the\nselected action program. The comparison of this prediction to\nthe desired state yields a PE that can be used to optimize the\nselection of those actions that are adequate for effecting the\ndesired state (Frith, Blakemore, & Wolpert, 2000), allowing for\nemotional action: that motor program is selected that is most\nlikely to attain the desired action effect (Ridderinkhof, 2014).\nWithout a forward model the organism can only act and learn on\nthe basis of actual behavior; the forward model provides an\nopportunity for the rapid simulation of action, which provides a\nplatform for action decision and learning without the risks and\nperils of the effects and consequences of overt action in the real\nworld.\nForward modeling and its computational bases have been\ndeveloped extensively in the literature on motor control (e.g.,\nWolpert & Flanagan, 2001) and have recently been elaborated\nin the literature on predictive processing (e.g., Friston, 2012).\nThey are introduced here in the emotion literature, providing a\nsolid footing for the selection of actions to meet emotional\nmotives, and hence indeed rendering such actions emotional in\nFigure 2. Schematic architecture for ideomotor action, supplemented with a forward model (turning action selection into an action\u00adeffect prediction-\nand-valuation cycle), according to the IMPPACT model. The forward model calculates the predicted action effects (denoted by letters A''', B''', etc.,\nfor exteroceptive action effects, and numbers 1''', 2''', etc., for interoceptive and proprioceptive action effects), which are fed into a comparator\n(symbolized by the purple-colored hexagon). Predicted action effects are compared to actual action effects, giving rise (in case of discrepancy) to a\nprediction error (PE) which is fed back into the forward model so as to optimize its predictions. Predicted action effects are compared to desired action\neffects, in which case a PE is used to revaluate and adjust the chose action option, which is then fed into the forward model in its turn; the cycle\ncontinues until PE is minimized and the appropriate action can be executed. (Adapted from Ridderinkhof, 2014.)\na meaningful way. The notion that emotion in action entails for-\nward modeling of action effects in order to attain motives (as\nspecified in terms of desired action effects) implies that emo-\ntional action may be considered as ideomotor action. Such a\nframing may help generate novel hypotheses, that allow for\nempirical tests (for a seminal example see Eder et al., 2015).\nMultiple Emotions\nThe events we encounter often touch upon a multiplicity of con-\ncerns and elicit multiple appraisals, and hence multiple states of\naction readiness simultaneously. The emotional action impulse\nincited by one motive may be antagonized and checked by com-\npeting motives simultaneously present, given that the competi-\ntors are of sufficient strength (Franck, 1878; Michotte & Pr\u00fcm,\n1910). The suggestion of a cool beer may awaken desire, while\nsimultaneously this suggestion may activate the memory of last\nnight's serious hangover and hence elicit aversion. Mixed emo-\ntions can be observed in nostalgia, consisting of pain moderated\nby the happiness that was, together with pleasure moderated by\nthe regret that it had gone (Bellelli & Saldarelli, 1990).\nMultiple emotions require coordination in the form of emo-\ntion regulation (Frijda et al., 2014). Some impulses are best held\nin check until more appropriate times: when holding a cup of\nhot coffee, an itch may well trigger a scratching impulse, but\none would do better to put the cup on a nearby table before giv-\ning in to the urge. As a final example borrowed from Nico\nFrijda, one may consider it worth to suffer prolonged torture for\nnot betraying a comrade, and even to commit suicide to prevent\nbetraying.\nConclusions\nIn sum, emotional actions are instigated by events that, by pro-\ncesses of appraisal that assess the event's relevance to the indi-\nvidual's concerns, elicit some motive to establish or modify a\nspecific state of the world. The ensuing state of action readiness\ndrives and instigates emotional action that helps attain that state,\nor rather, helps reduce the discrepancy between the desired and\ncurrent state. The prediction of the sensory consequences of the\nselected action option allows for the evaluation and fine-tuning\nof anticipated action effects vis-\u00e0-vis what the action should\naccomplish, which renders the emotional action impulsive yet\npurposive. Through efference copies or forward modeling, the\npragmatic anticipation leads to a state of action readiness. As a\nresult, the action is by definition emotional.\nThis article introduces the mechanism of forward modeling\ninto the emotion literature, as part of a theoretical synthesis of\noften old concepts, integrated in IMPPACT (Ridderinkhof,\n2014). We do not claim substantial differences between the key\ncomponents introduced here, and how these component pro-\ncesses or constructs (and their underlying mechanisms) are\ndealt with in the relevant literatures. Rephrasing questions about\nemotional behavior in terms of underlying constructs and mech-\nanisms of information processing may not in itself add much\nexplanation. Our aim here was to evaluate whether, from an\naction control perspective, a meaningful integration and synthe-\nsis with emotion theory is feasible, at least at the level of the\nconceptual components. It is our hope that the present theoreti-\ncal synthesis, and in particular its inclusion of forward mode-\nling, may engender a deeper understanding of emotion in action\n(or at least a framework from which novel and testable predic-\ntions can be derived).\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nNotes\n1 The theoretical synthesis presented here was heavily inspired by the\nwork of Nico Frijda. Our interactions over the past few years have\nresulted in joint theoretical work on impulsive action (Frijda et al.,\n2014), a topic where Frijda's views on emotions met Rietveld's philo-\nsophical work on action affordance and the present author's work on\nthe cognitive neuroscience of action control. Only weeks before writ-\ning the present article, Nico Frijda passed away at the age of 87. The\nfield as a whole, and this recent pupil in particular, are deeply indebted\nto his influential contributions; Nico will be dearly missed by all. The\npresent article, and any discussion it may stir, form a humble tribute to\nNico Frijda, an original thinker and great inspirator.\n2 Emotions often manifest social significance, but do not necessar-\nily qualify as such. Frijda recounted the example of hitting his head\nagainst a kitchen cupboard door, and then hitting and scolding at the\ncupboard in anger, which relieved the annoyance and frustration of\nimpotence without serving any evident social purpose.\nReferences\nBacon, F.
