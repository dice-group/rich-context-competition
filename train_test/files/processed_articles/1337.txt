These studies, however, have included referred patients and large\nnumbers of patients with previously treated hyperthyroidism. The aim of this\nstudy was to assess whether subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with abnor-\nmal lipid levels in a population-based sample.\nMETHODS Data from adults older than 40 years who did not previously have a\ndiagnosis of hypothyroidism or who were taking thyroid replacement medica-\ntion were analyzed from the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey\n(NHANES) III. Subclinical hypothyroidism was defined as a TSH value of 6.7 to\n14.9 mU/L and normal thyroxine (n = 215). Euthyroid control adults included par-\nOutcomes examined were serum cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol,\nhigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels in those who had sub-\nclinical hypothyroidism and in euthyroid controls.\nRESULTS Persons meeting the criteria for subclinical hypothyroidism had higher\nbut there were no significant differences in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or high-\ndensity lipoprotein (HDL) levels. When adjusted for age, race, sex, and the use\nof lipid-lowering drugs, however, subclinical hypothyroidism was not related to\nelevations in cholesterol levels (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.06, 95% confidence\nCONCLUSIONS Subclinical hypothyroidism does not appear to be associated with\nabnormalities in serum cholesterol or triglyceride levels when adjusted for con-\nfounding variables in this population-based study.\nINTRODUCTION\nSubclinical hypothyroidism, also called mild hypothyroidism, is a term\nused for a condition in which there are small elevations in thyroid-stimu-\nlating hormone, yet normal circulating levels of thyroid hormones. This\ncondition is more common in the elderly and is found twice as often in women\nas in men.1,2 While it is uncommon in younger persons, by the age of 65 years,\nthe overall prevalence of the disorder is about 17% in women and 7% in men.3\nDespite recognition of this condition and the observation that a small\npercentage of these patients advance to overt hypothyroidism each year, con-\ntroversy continues over whether elderly individuals should be screened for\nsubclinical hypothyroidism.4-6 Whereas the American Thyroid Association7 has\nendorsed screening for this disorder, others, such as the US Preventive Services\nWilliam J. Hueston, MD\nWilliam S. Pearson, MHA\nDepartment of Family Medicine, Medical\nUniversity of South Carolina, Charleston, SC\nConflicts of interest: none reported\nWilliam J. Hueston, MD\nDepartment of Family Medicine\nhuestowj@musc.edu\nTask Force,8 have advised against routine screening. In\naddition, although the American College of Physicians\nrecognizes that screening women older than 50 years for\nhypothyroidism may have some value, they specifically\nnote that the benefit of treating patients with subclinical\nhypothyroidism has not been evaluated.9\nThe decision about whether to screen patients for this\ndisorder is clouded by inconsistent evidence of any benefit\nfrom early treatment. A few trials have found that persons\nwith subclinical hypothyroidism who are given L-thyrox-\nine experience some improvements in their energy level\nand feelings of well-being.10-12 These studies, however,\nhave had few participants, enrolled patients with preexist-\ning thyroid disease resulting from thyroid ablation, and\nincluded patients referred to specialists rather than the\ngeneral population. It is not clear that these results can be\ngeneralized to individuals who would be identified solely\nthrough mass-screening efforts.\nAnother finding that has been used to argue for\nscreening and treatment of subclinical hypothyroid-\nism is the observation that thyroid replacement in\npatients with subclinical hypothyroidism can reduce\nabnormalities in cholesterol.3,4,13 Lipid abnormalities\nare reported to be more common in patients with overt\nhypothyroidism and are thought to contribute to the\ndisproportionate increase in cardiovascular risk in these\npersons.14 Some studies of patients with subclinical\nhypothyroidism also have shown that patients have\nelevations in their cholesterol levels.15-17 There are few\npopulation-based studies that have compared lipid\nlevels in patients who have subclinical hypothyroidism\nwith lipid levels in euthyroid persons. The purpose of\nthis study was to determine whether lipid abnormalities\nare more common in patients with subclinical hypothy-\nroidism when compared lipid levels in euthyroid indi-\nviduals using data from the Third National Health and\nNutritional Examination Survey (NHANES III).\nMETHODS\nstudy of a nationally representative sample of nonin-\nstitutionalized US residents, was used for this study.\nThe NHANES III is a federally sponsored survey that\nincludes a detailed health interview, physical exami-\nnation, and laboratory testing. To assure a sufficient\nnumber of minority participants for meaningful analy-\nses, the NHANES III oversamples minority groups.\nWhen the data are adjusted for this oversampling using\nweighting factors, the results are designed to represent\na population estimate for the entire US population.\nFrom the NHANES III data set, the adult question-\nnaire, physical examination, and laboratory sections\nwere merged using the unique sequence number for\neach respondent. The total number of respondents\nwith reported thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and\nthyroxine (T4\nhypothyroidism is uncommon in younger persons, and\nthe treatment of cholesterol abnormalities is less well\ndefined in younger age-groups, we focused our analysis\non persons 40 years of age and older. This approach\nproduced a sample size of 8,586 (Figure 1). From this\ngroup, we attempted to exclude all respondents with\nknown hypothyroidism by excluding respondents who\nwere taking any medication that was prescribed for\na diagnosis of primary or secondary hypothyroidism\nWe defined the subclinical hypothyroidism group as\nvalue greater than 4.5 \u00b5g/dL. The euthyroid control\ngroup was classified as those with normal TSH values\nOutcome measures were total cholesterol, high-den-\nsity lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL),\nand triglyceride levels. We looked at these measures as\ncontinuous variables and stratified each into bivariate\ncategories representing high and low values. Respondents\nwere considered to have a high total cholesterol level if\nthe serum value was greater than 200 mg/dL. Low HDL\nwas defined as less than 35 mg/dL. Elevation of LDL was\ndefined as greater than 130 mg/dL, while an elevation in\ntriglycerides was defined as a value higher than 250 mg/dL.\nThese values were selected based on the recommendations\nFigure 1.

SUDAAN allows for\npopulation estimates to be calculated despite the\ncomplex sampling design of the NHANES. For\nthese 2 groups, we computed descriptive statistics\nand made bivariate comparisons using chi-square\nanalysis and Student's t test. Logistic regression\nmodels were used to control for age, sex, and race.\nRESULTS\nOf the 8,228 respondents included in the study,\n215 (2.6%) were found to fit the criteria for sub-\nclinical hypothyroidism. The characteristics of\nthe persons with subclinical hypothyroidism and\neuthyroid control group are displayed in Table 1.\nWe found that subclinical hypothyroidism was\nmore common in women and in non-Hispanic\nwhites and with increased age.\nWhen we looked at serum lipid values for\nthe entire group, we found that persons with\nsubclinical hypothyroidism were more likely to\nhave elevations in their average cholesterol and\ntriglyceride levels (Table 2). When we dichoto-\nmized these variables into high or low based on\nnational guidelines, we found that persons with\nsubclinical hypothyroidism were more likely to\nhave elevated total cholesterol levels. No statis-\ntically significant differences between persons\nwith subclinical hypothyroidism and euthyroid\ncontrols were found in the percentage of respon-\ndents with abnormal HDL levels, LDL levels, or\nin triglyceride levels (Table 3).\nBecause treatment of elevated cholesterol lev-\nels with medications is common, we considered\nthe possibility that preexisting elevations in lipid\nlevels in the subclinical hypothyroid respondents\nmight have been reduced as a result of use of\nlipid-lowering drugs. To explore this possibil-\nity, we looked at whether respondents in each\ngroup were taking cholesterol-lowering agents.\nWe found that a greater percentage of respon-\ndents in the euthyroid control group (77.3%)\nwere taking cholesterol-lowering agents than\nwere respondents in the subclinical hypothyroid\nwas unlikely that the use of cholesterol-lower-\ning therapy reduced the baseline lipid levels in\nTable 1.

If anything, it was more likely\nthat the euthyroid control group had higher baseline\ncholesterol and LDL values.\nTo examine whether other possible covariates could\nmask differences between the groups, we performed a\nlogistic regression analysis using subclinical hypothy-\nroidism and adjusting for any effects of sex, age, race,\nand the use of cholesterol-lowering medications on the\nrisk of having an elevated total or LDL cholesterol lev-\nels. The analysis showed no effect of subclinical hypo-\nthyroidism on the frequency of abnormalities in total\ncholesterol, LDL, HDL, or triglycerides (Table 4).\nThe logistic regression analysis simply explored\nnormal or abnormal lipid levels. Although there are\nrecommended cutoffs for lipid abnormalities, the cardio-\nvascular risk related to cholesterol abnormalities is linear\nin nature. To examine whether subclinical hypothyroid-\nism is related to cholesterol values throughout the range\nof cholesterol, we performed a second analysis using\nlinear regression and the same covariates noted above.\nAgain, there was no statistically significant relationship\nbetween subclinical hypothyroidism and total choles-\nor triglyceride level (P = .29).\nDISCUSSION\nIn this population-based sample, compared with\nrespondents who had normal TSH levels, respondents\nwith mild elevations in their serum TSH and normal T4\nlevels were more likely to have elevations in cholesterol\nlevels. After adjusting for demographic and other clini-\ncal variables, however, no significant relationship was\nfound between cholesterol, HDL, or LDL levels and\nsubclinical hypothyroidism. The only relationship that\nwas significant after adjusting for potential confounding\nvariables was an increase in the number of persons with\nhigh triglyceride levels and lower HDL levels in the\nsubclinical hypothyroid group.\nHypercholesterolemia was common in both the\nsubclinical hypothyroid group and the euthyroid con-\ntrol group. Nearly two thirds of this sample were tak-\ning cholesterol-lowering agents, which might account\nfor the fairly good lipid levels observed in these\nrespondents. The frequent use of cholesterol-lowering\nagents is common in this age-group, however. Another\npopulation-based study reported that in persons older\nthan 65 years, 63% of participants were found to have\na cholesterol level higher than 200 mg/dL.19 Previous\nreports showing hypercholesterolemia to be com-\nmon in persons with subclinical hypothyroidism may\nsimply reflect that hypercholesterolemia is a common\ncondition. This possibility is underscored by a recent\nreport showing that while LDL levels were higher in\novert hypothyroidism, there were no differences found\nbetween subclinical hypothyroid respondents and\nmatched euthyroid controls.15\nOur examination of thyroid function in NHANES\nIII participants is similar to that of Hollowell et al,20 but\nthere are several important differences. In their study,\nHollowell and colleagues found that 4.3% of all per-\nsons had subclinical hypothyroidism. These research-\ners, however, did not exclude patients who had known\nhypothyroidism and were taking thyroid replacement\nmedications, which constituted about 13% of their\nsubclinical hypothyroidism group. Also, the cutoff\nvalue for a high TSH level in the Hollowell et al study\nwas set at 4.5 mU/L, a value lower than the value used\nin our study. Although the inclusion of patients with\na TSH level between 4.5 and 6.7 mU/L increases the\nprevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism, these patients\nare least likely to have any clinical symptoms of hypo-\nthyroidism and have a lower risk of future progression\ncompared with those who have higher TSH levels. Fur-\nthermore, there is no a priori reason why patients with\nTSH levels between 4.5 and 6.7 mU/L would have lipid\nlevels that differ from those of patients with higher TSH\nlevels, so the exclusion of these individuals should not\nalter our overall conclusions.\nThese findings have implications for recommenda-\ntions on screening for subclinical hypothyroidism.\nAlthough one study has examined the cost utility of\nscreening for subclinical hypothyroidism and found\nscreening to be cost-effective, that study included the\nidentification and treatment of lipid abnormalities as\na benefit of screening.21 From these results, it would\nappear that screening for subclinical hypothyroidism\nsimply to identify lipid abnormalities would be no more\nuseful than screening for hyperlipidemia in general.\nNor is there any evidence that treatment of hyperlipid-\nemia in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism would\nbe any different from treatment of hyperlipidemia in\neuthyroid patients. Consequently, analyses of the cost-\neffectiveness of subclinical hypothyroidism screening\nTable 4.

In particular,\nthe ability to determine whether treatment of previ-\nously elevated cholesterol levels is limited by the lack\nof information about current treatment regimens and\nhow long the problem had been known to the patient.\nThus, patients who had known about their cholesterol\nabnormalities for a few days were grouped in the same\ncategory as those who had been under treatment for\nseveral years. Although the effectiveness of therapy\nmay be underestimated in this population, it is unlikely\nthat the distribution in the time that patients knew\nabout their hyperlipidemic condition or treatments\nwould vary between the 2 groups.\nSecond, our assumption that the subclinical hypothy-\nroid group is homogeneous might ignore the possibility\nthat a subgroup of these persons might be at greater\nrisk for hyperlipidemia. For example, patients with TSH\nvalues between 10 and 15 mU/L have been found to be\nat greater risk of advancing to overt hypothyroidism dur-\ning the next few years. It is possible that this group or\nanother subset also could be at higher risk for hypercho-\nlesterolemia or other sequelae related to overt hypothy-\nroidism before the thyroid completely fails.\nIn addition, because of the cross-sectional nature\nof this analysis, it is difficult to ascribe causality to any\nassociations we have found. Because we do not know\nwhether thyroid test abnormalities preceded elevations\nin triglyceride levels, it cannot be definitely stated that\none leads to the other. Further evaluation of this rela-\ntionship with longitudinal data would be necessary to\nsupport a causal link.\nLast, it is important to emphasize that this analysis\nfocused solely on the benefits of finding subclinical\nhypothyroidism for the purposes of treating hyper-\nlipidemias. Other beneficial effects of treatment, such\nas improvements in well-being, might be of sufficient\nvalue to patients to warrant screening.21 Further evalu-\nation of patients from population-based screening\nprograms who are found to have subclinical hypothy-\nroidism rather than those referred for specialty manage-\nment would be useful in determining the magnitude of\nthese benefits in the general population.\nTo read or post commentaries in response to this article, see it\nonline at http://www.annfammed.org/cgi/content/full/2/4/351.\n",
