Laboratory determinations were centralized. The albumin to creatinine ratio in urine and\nestimated GFR from calibrated creatinine (SCr) were determined. A comparison with 2001 through 2006 NHANES surveys was\nperformed.\nResults: Prevalence of CKD was 13.2% in northeastern (NE) Italy (age and gender standardized to the U.S. 2007 Caucasian\npopulation). Prevalence of CKD in U.S. Caucasians is higher (20.3%), the major difference being in CKD 3. Risk factors for\nCKD are more prevalent in the United States than in Italy. With use of CKD 3a and 3b stages, CKD prevalence decreased in\nConclusions: The prevalence of CKD is high in NE Italy, but lower than that in the United States. A large part of the\ndifference in CKD prevalence in NE Italy versus that in the United States is due to the different prevalence of CKD 3. The\nhigher prevalence of a number of renal risk factors in persons from the United States explains in part the different dimensions\nof the CKD problem in the two populations.\nAccording to a number of reports from different parts\nof the world, the burden of chronic kidney disease\n(CKD) is dramatically increasing (1). However,\nmany of such studies are not comparable because of different\ncriteria for defining CKD. In fact, screening has often been\nlimited to measuring only estimated GFR (eGFR), not includ-\ning the determination of albuminuria, which would offer\nidentification of CKD stages 1 and 2. Furthermore, the issue\nof the serum creatinine assay and calibration has not been\nadequately addressed by some, thus biasing comparison be-\ntween different populations. Consequently, there are a few\nlarge, sufficiently powered epidemiologic studies using sim-\nilar methodologies and these do not cover significant geo-\ngraphical areas. The NHANES surveys (2) have constituted\nthe template for CKD prevalence studies. Thus, all of the\nmost significant CKD epidemiology surveys compare with\nthem. In northern Europe, the Prevend (3) and the HUNT II\nstudy (4) investigated CKD prevalence. No other sufficiently\npowered study has been performed in Europe and in partic-\nular in the southern Mediterranean area which is known to\ndiffer consistently from northern Europe regarding nutri-\ntional habits and prevalence of pathologic conditions that\nincrease the risk of developing CKD.\nBecause of the perception of a large and increasing burden\nof CKD in different parts of the world, the term \"CKD\nepidemics\" has been coined. However, much of the contri-\nbution to such a burden is due to CKD stage 3. The definition\nwhich has been questioned as being a reliable marker of\nPublished online ahead of print.

Different CKD 3 definitions have thus been\nproposed to better estimate the epidemiologic relevance of\nthe CKD (5).\nTo assess the prevalence of CKD in Italy, in 2006, in NE Italy,\nwe launched the \"INCIPE\" study (Initiative on Nephropathy,\nof relevance to public health, which is Chronic, possibly in its\nInitial stages, and carries a Potential risk of major clinical End-\npoints).\nMaterials and Methods\nRecruitment of INCIPE Patients\nThe ethics committees of the involved institutions approved the\nstudy protocol. For the INCIPE study 6200 patients, all Caucasians,\nof patients of 62 randomly selected general practitioners (GPs) based in\nfour geographical areas in the Veneto region, NE Italy. In Italy all\ncitizens receive free health insurance from the National Health System.\nTo this aim all are included in the list of patients of GPs of their own\nchoice. Thus, drawing participants from the GPs' lists is likely to draw\nthem directly from the community. Enrollment and clinical examina-\ntion were performed locally in four units, by trained medical doctors.\nPregnant women were not enrolled. After written informed consent\nwas obtained, each participant completed a self-administered question-\nnaire (e.g., family and personal medical history, pharmacologic treat-\nments, and smoking habits). Patients were asked to refrain from smok-\ning beginning from the night before. BP, waist circumference, body\nweight, and height were measured as in the NHANES study.\nFreshly voided morning urine was collected. In menstruating women\nthe sample was btained a few days later. Standard urine examination\nby a plastic strip (Aution Sticks 10 EA; Arkray, Menarini Diagnostics,\nFirenze, Italy) was immediately performed.\nLaboratory\nBlood and urine samples were frozen at 80\u00b0C by 5 hours after\ncollection. All determinations were centralized (Verona General Hos-\npital, Central Laboratory).\nWith reference to the urine albumin assay we chose to prescreen the\nsamples with a strip test (Clinitek Microalbumin; Siemens Medical\nSolutions Diagnostics, Mishawaka, IN) and to confirm the positive\nresults (3.4 mg/mmol creatinine) measuring albumin immunochemi-\ncally by a specific antibody and a nephelometer (Immage 800; Beckman\nCoulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA), and creatinine on RxL Dimension (Dade-\nBehring, Inc., Newark, DE) using an alkaline picrate method as de-\nscribed (6).\nSerum creatinine (SCr) was measured using a kinetic rate Jaffe\nmethod. For GFR estimation, SCr measurements were recalibrated to\nstandardized creatinine measurements obtained at The Cleveland\nClinic Research Laboratory as described (7).\nOnly data from Caucasians (non-Hispanic whites) aged 40 years or\nCKD Classification\nThe GFR was estimated with the CKD Epidemiology Collaboration\n(EPI) equation using calibrated creatinine (9). Albuminuria was defined\nas an albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) 3.4 mg/mmol creatinine (6),\nmg/mmol (299 mg/g), and macroalbuminuria as an ACR 34 mg/\nDefinition of the five CKD stages was according to the KDOQI\nclassification (10). Stage 3 was also substratified into two classes: 3a,\nWe have measured SCr and ACR at one time point only. Correct\nclassification of CKD requires confirmation of abnormalities over at\nleast a 3-month period. For the analysis of the NHANES data we used\nthe same criteria.\nDefinition of Clinical Phenotypes\nParticipants were classified as hypertensive when they reported hav-\ning received a diagnosis of hypertension and as diabetics when they\nreported having received a diagnosis of diabetes or when found to have\nfasting plasma glucose 126 mg/dl. Hypercolesterolemic individuals\nwere those with blood cholesterol levels 240 mg/dl. For metabolic\nsyndrome definition we used the American Heart Association/Na-\ntional Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Scientific Statements (11). Peo-\nple who smoke (current and past) were those who had smoked 100\ncigarettes in their entire life. Previous cardiovascular (CV) events in-\ncluded self-reported diagnosis performed by a physician of coronary\nheart disease, angina, heart attack, transitory ischemic attack, or stroke.\nStatistical Analyses\nThe sample size was calculated by considering the estimated preva-\nlence of asymptomatic renal dysfunction. Because there were no avail-\nable data from the Italian population, we considered the prevalence of\npatients with a creatinine clearance 50 ml/min, which was 13% in a\nsample representative of the U.S. general population (12). A sample of\n4345 patients is necessary to obtain an estimate precision of 1% with a\nconfidence level of 1    95% (nQuery Advisor 6.01). Assuming that\n30% of patients were not willing to participate in the study, we singled\nAnalyses of NHANES databases were performed by pooling data from\nthree survey periods as previously outlined and incorporating the\nsampling weights to obtain unbiased estimates from the complex\nNHANES sampling design.\nThe standard error of the mean (SEM) for all estimates was obtained\nusing the Taylor series (linearization) method following NHANES-\nrecommended procedures and weights.\nA multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate\nthe simultaneous effects of population (NHANES versus INCIPE), gen-\nder, age, smoking, body mass index, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases,\nhypertension, and kidney disease history on CKD 3 to 5 and albumin-\nuria. To investigate the effect of diabetes, hypertension, and gender on\nCKD (all stages) in each study, we used separate logistic regression\nmodels, considering diabetes and hypertension adjusted for age and/or\ngender. The results were expressed as odds ratios (OR) with their 95%\nconfidence interval (95% CI).\nThe appropriate statistical methodology was used for complex sur-\nvey analysis as recommended by the CDC in the continuous NHANES\nIn hypothesis testing, the level of significance was P  0.05. All the\nanalyses were performed with SAS 9.1.3 for Windows (SAS Institute\nInc., Cary, NC).\nResults\nsubjects were enrolled. Because we limited our analysis to\npeople with a complete data set, this report is based on 3629\nsubjects, a number lower than the calculated sample size. How-\never, as the observed prevalence of CKD was much lower in the\nINCIPE population than in the U.S. population (see below), the\nchance of incorrect inference is marginal, even given the\nslightly reduced sample size.\nParticipants in INCIPE had a mean age of 59.8 years, and\nthe table also shows corresponding data in the NHANES sur-\nvey). The clinical characterization of INCIPE and NHANES\npopulations is shown in Supplemental Table 2. The prevalence\nof high SCr in the INCIPE population was about one third\ncompared with that in the NHANES population (1.2 versus\nTable 1 shows the prevalence of CKD in the INCIPE study as\nbased on the KDOQI classification. Statistics for the CKD 5 class is\nnot shown in the INCIPE tables because only two patients were\nrecognized in this class. The overall prevalence of CKD was 12.7%.\nAfter age and gender standardization of the INCIPE data to the\nlence of CKD in the United States is much higher (20.3%) (Table 2),\nthe largest difference being in CKD 3 (Figure 1).\nIn both studies the eGFR was negatively associated with\nolder age: in the older than 70 years group compared with the\nin the United States, respectively. Between these age classes, in\nthe oldest (70 years) the condition of GFR 90 was promi-\nnently less prevalent (12 and 23 times lower in NE Italy and in\nthe United States, respectively). Actually, the GFR was gradu-\nally decreasing with age, by an average of 8.5 and 8.8 ml/min\nper decade in the Caucasians from Italy and the United States,\nrespectively.\nPrevalence of a number of CKD risk conditions is consis-\ntently higher in the United States than in NE Italy in each age\nclass (Figure 2, Supplemental Table 2).\nAfter adjustment for age and gender, in the INCIPE popula-\nhigher odds of CKD (all stages) compared with normotensive\npatients. Similarly, individuals with diabetes had 2.66 (95% CI\n2.03, 3.49) higher odds for CKD than individuals without dia-\nbetes. Very similar data were obtained in the NHANES Cau-\nrespectively). Women (adjusted for age) were not revealed to\nIn both populations only a minority of CKD 3 patients had\nmicro-/macroalbumin excretion rate (AER); in particular, in\nmicro-/macro-AER (Table 3a and Table 3b, Supplemental Table\n3). The prevalence of albuminuria was noticeably different\nbetween genders in the CKD 3 stage in both populations (Sup-\nplemental Table 3). Consequently, the prevalence of those CKD\n3 patients with micro-/macro-AER was higher in men than in\n18.1%, respectively, in the United States).\nWhen CKD 3a and 3b stages are used instead of a CKD stage\n3, the total prevalence of patients with CKD (all stages) changes\n12.8% in the NHANES (Table 3) population, the differences\nbeing homogeneously distributed among different age classes.\nThe risk of having CKD 3 to 5 is 2.7 times higher in the\nNHANES population than in the INCIPE population after ad-\njustment for differences in age, gender, diabetes, CV history,\nhypertension, renal history, smoking, and obesity (Table 4).\nThe difference between the two populations remains sub-\nstantially of the same extension if we analyze the risk of having\nCKD 3b to 5. A major role in the two models is due to renal\nhistory (Table 4).\nRegarding the risk of having albuminuria, it also is higher in\nthe NHANES population, 45%, with diabetes having a major\nTable 1. INCIPE: Prevalence of CKD by demographic and clinical characteristics\neffect (Table 4). Although women have a higher risk than men\nof having CKD 3 to 5, they are at reduced risk of albuminuria.\nDiscussion\nThe INCIPE study is the first sufficiently large study ex-\nploring the prevalence of CKD in Italy and in southern\nEurope. Only in a tiny minority of European countries do\ndata exist on the epidemiology of CKD. It is perhaps because\nof this lack of information that just a few European countries\nhave started surveillance programs on the CKD epidemic\nand even less put in place specific plans to halt it. We feel our\nsurvey, by providing relevant information on CKD in one of\nthe most populous European countries, is an important ad-\ndition to the knowledge base on this still overlooked prob-\nlem and could fuel the interest of health agencies in imple-\nmenting preventive programs.\nMajor findings of the study are as follow: (1) abnormal\nserum creatinine values are less frequent in persons from\nItaly than in persons from the United States; (2) the preva-\nlence of CKD is higher in the United States than in NE Italy;\n(3) persons from NE Italy have lower prevalence of certain\nrenal risk factors than persons from the United States; (4) in\nboth populations CKD stage 3 represents most of the CKD.\nPrevalence of CKD in the INCIPE and NHANES\nPopulations\nThe prevalence of CKD in Caucasians 40 years old is much\nhigher in the United States (20.3%) than in NE Italy (13.2%) and\nthis is confirmed also by the 3 times higher prevalence of\nabnormal SCr values in the U.S. population. The two popula-\ntions differ regarding a number of renal risk factors. Actually,\nthe prevalence of diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome\n(Figure 2) is higher in persons from the United States. This may\nFigure 1. Prevalence of CKD according to age classes, in men and women, in INCIPE and NHANES populations.\nTable 2. NHANES: Prevalence of CKD by demographics and clinical characteristics\nPrevious kidney\ndisease\nNone of the\nprevious\nMetabolic\nsyndrome\nexplain why CKD appears to be more prevalent in the United\nStates than in NE Italy.\nAnother explanation could be that the CKD EPI equation for the\ndetermination of the eGFR performs differently in persons from\nItaly. This has been shown in other nationalities in reference to the\nModification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation (15).\nHowever, in a study carried out by us, the MDRD formula per-\nformed quite well in persons from Italy in whom GFR was mea-\nsured with the iohexol clearance method (unpublished). Further-\nmore, the higher prevalence of micro- and macroalbuminuria in\nthe NHANES population (Supplementary Table 3) supports the\nidea that CKD is really more prevalent in persons from the United\nStates.\nBecause our prevalence data are based on a single measure-\nment, we may have overestimated the true prevalence of CKD. If\nwe consider that 50% of microalbuminuric patients with GFR 90\nof the macroalbuminuric individuals have persistent albuminuria\nTable 3a. INCIPE: Proportion of people with CKD stage 3 split into substages\nNormoalbuminuria\nAlbuminuria\nFigure 2. Prevalence of hypertension, metabolic syndrome, obesity, and diabetes according to age classes in INCIPE and NHANES\npopulations.\n(16), the total prevalence of CKD changes only modestly, from 12.7\nPrevalence of CKD 3 According to Different Definitions\nThe possibility exists that we are overestimating the preva-\nlence of CKD because of the criteria used for CKD categoriza-\ntion (17). Definition of CKD 3 is particularly questioned (17).\nThis stage is the most prevalent among all stages in both\npopulations with a dramatic increase in the more advanced age\nclasses (Figure 1).\nIt is not known which renal diseases explain the condition,\nalthough part of these patients could simply have an aging kid-\nney. Actually, among patients with CKD 3, most are 60 years old\n(91.4% in NE Italy and 87.3% in the United States) and the majority\nand 5.1%) have macroalbuminuria.\nCKD 3 is also more prevalent in women. However, the propor-\ntion of them not disclosing abnormal AER is larger than that in\nmen (Supplemental Table 3). Thus, very few have evidence of\nkidney damage. Actually, there is an opposite effect of the female\ngender on the risk of having albuminuria (decreased) than of\nhaving CKD 3 to 5 (Table 4), which may suggest an over-repre-\nsentation of CKD stage 3 because of the underestimation of GFR in\nwomen by the CKD EPI formula.\nWith subclassification of CKD 3 into CKD 3a and CKD 3b, the\nprevalence of CKD (all stages) changes from 12.7 to 8.5% in NE\nItaly and from 20.3 to 12.8% in the United States. The rationale for\nsuch subclassification of the CKD stage 3 is that in these patients\nit is the presence of abnormal albuminuria that plays a crucial role\nin the determination of the CV and renal risk. In prospective\nstudies in the general population, Foster et al. (18) have shown that\nrisk of a CV event in CKD 3 without albuminuria is not increased\nTable 4. Multivariate logistic regression of albuminuria and CKD 3-4-5 (by different definitions of CKD 3),\ncomparing NHANES and INCIPE\nAER\nTable 3b. NHANES: Proportion of people with CKD stage 3 split into substages\nNormoalbuminuria\nAlbuminuria\nwith respect to patients without CKD, whereas Hallan et al. (19)\nhave observed that both conditions increase the risk, but in the\npresence of abnormal albuminuria the CV risk increases dramat-\nically. Furthermore, it has also been shown that most of the pa-\ntients with CKD 3 have fairly stable renal function and that it is the\nconcurrence of abnormal albuminuria that imparts the risk of\nprogressive renal disease (20).\nRisk Factors for CKD and Albuminuria in Both Populations\nIn the two populations the effect of hypertension (OR 2.09\nversus 1.85 in INCIPE and NHANES, respectively) and diabetes\nalmost the same. However, as observed, the different preva-\nlence of diabetes and hypertension, more frequent in the United\nStates, concurs in explaining the higher CKD prevalence in the\nNHANES population. The finding that even after adjustment\nfor a number of variables the risk of having CKD 3 to 5 and\nalbuminuria is definitely higher in the NHANES population\n(Table 4) than in the INCIPE population suggests a significant\nrole by other indeterminate factors.\nLimitations of the Study\nThe study has a number of limitations. Some have been\ndiscussed before. The participation of 60% was lower than\nexpected; however, for an epidemiologic, voluntary study it is\ncertainly good. In fact, whereas in the NHANES (2) and the\nHUNT II (4) surveys the participation rate among those ap-\nproached was 70%, in the Nijmegen Biomedical Study it was\nonly 29% (21). The reduced participation is probably the cause\nof the distortion of the sample in terms of age and gender from\nthe randomized population, that is, a reduced representation of\nthe 4th decade of age, particularly in men, and of the 80 years\nin women. However, differences are 6% of the crude frequen-\ncies in each age and gender class, thus suggesting that such a\nresponse bias is probably very modest.\nThe study enrolled only patients older than 40 years and thus\nits data cannot be generalized to the whole population. How-\never, the causal relationship of CKD with disorders such as\nhypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obesity--which\ntypically occur after the 4th decade of age--makes this section\nof the population the most affected by CKD.\nWe have used the same cutoff for the definition of microalbu-\nminuria in both genders, although most likely a higher one\nshould be used in women (22). Because of the two-steps strat-\negy used for the determination of albuminuria (a prescreening\nof samples with a strip test and confirmation of positive results\nmeasuring albumin immunochemically), because the cutoff for\nstrip-positive results--3.4 mg/mmol creatinine--is indepen-\ndent of gender, we cannot analyze our data by considering\ngender-specific ranges for albuminuria. However, others used\nthe same cutoff for both genders (4,16). Furthermore, the com-\nparison between the two populations was not affected because\nwe used the same criteria in both. The opposite effect of gender\non the risk of CKD 3 to 5 and on abnormal albuminuria cannot\nbe influenced by such a definition because the use of a higher\ncutoff for albuminuria in women would have magnified such a\ndivergence.\nConclusions\nThe prevalence of CKD is higher in the United States than in\nNE Italy probably because of the higher prevalence of a number\nof renal risk factors in persons from the United States. In both\npopulations the implementation of the definition of the CKD 3\nstage with albuminuria impressively decreases the prevalence\nof CKD because a large number of patients with GFR 60\nml/min do not have abnormal albuminuria.\n"
