It is the specificity of institutional\nspace that determines national differences in the levels of\ncivic engagement and in the membership in voluntary or\ncharitable organizations in particular. The above differences\nnot only consist in the extent of involvement of a certain\ncountry's population in voluntary associations but also strat-\nify the factors of this involvement. Defining such factors in\nthe context of cross-cultural peculiarities remains rather\ncrucial.\nAmong a great number of theoretical approaches, which\nexplain the factors of membership, there are several ones\nsingled out in the present-day empirical investigations. The\nadherents of socioeconomic approach think that the eco-\nnomic status is a stimulus of participation in a voluntary orga-\nnization. The above status is traditionally defined as a\nderivative of income, employment, educational background,\nand so on. Sociological surveys have certified a considerable\neffect of such factors as education (a higher level of member-\nship is recorded among more educated people), employment\n(a higher level of membership is recorded among the employed\nthan unemployed), and extent of employment (fully\nemployed people are more disposed to membership than par-\ntially employed ones; Curtis, Grabb, & Baer, 1992; Moyser\nbetween gross domestic product (GDP) of a certain country\nand level of participation in voluntary and human rights pro-\ntection organizations (Lane, 2006). High socioeconomic sta-\ntus ensures free time habits and competence for effective\ninvolvement in voluntary organizations. However, the effect\nof this factor among other factors in each country calls into\nquestion its universality and permanency.\nThe theory of social capital asserts that activities in volun-\ntary organizations are determined by accumulated social\nresource, that is, by staying in informal networks and by trust in\npeople and social institutions. Membership density in associa-\ntions is connected first of all with the degree of interindividual\n1Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine,\nKyiv, Ukraine\nCorresponding Author:\nOleksandr Reznik, Doctor of Sociology, Principal Research Fellow,\nDepartment of Social Psychology, Institute of Sociology of the National\nUkraine.\nEmail: oleksanderreznik@gmail.com\nDeterminants of Involvement in Work for\nVoluntary or Charitable Organizations in\nEuropean Countries\nOleksandr Reznik1\n Keywords\nvoluntary or charitable organizations, socioeconomic status, social capital, civic engagement, political participation, civic\npractices\n2 SAGE Open\ntrust between citizens and with their perception of the extent\nof reciprocity and favor (Putnam, Leonardi, & Raffaella,\n1993). Time of residence in a certain territory, regular con-\ntacts with friends, relatives, neighbors favor taking roots by\nan individual in social structure (Fahmy, 2006; Tam Cho &\nRudolph, 2008) . It is the disposition to social interaction at\nthe place of residence that makes an individual able to reach\nmutual understanding with like-minded persons. The ability\nto interact in the process of joining a voluntary organization\ndetermines cooperative habits that favor the formation of\nhorizontal networks of civil society. However, it is a paradox\nthat empirical investigations in some countries often reveal a\nweak correlation between the model of social capital (espe-\ncially when it concerns a factor of trust) and membership in\nvoluntary associations (Howard & Gilbert, 2008; Li, Pickles,\n& Selle, 2002). It is evident that the effect of social capital\nalso manifests itself under certain circumstances.\nThese circumstances indicate expediency of cross-\ncultural comparisons. Different regional traditions of social\ninteraction even in the same country, which have been dem-\nonstrated by R. Putnam, point to the existence of culturologi-\ncal factors. Under these conditions, the value differences,\nalong with religious, institutional, and structural ones, are\nfixed empirically in international investigations (Curtis,\nBaer, & Grabb, 2001; Schofer & Fourcade-Gourinchas,\nInstead, the experience of political participation, which\nfavors mastering habits of social interaction in organizational\nwork, remains a stable factor of membership in voluntary\nMcAdam, MacIndoe, & Weffer-Elizondo, 2005; Sobieraj &\ngral conception of combining individual and collective forms\nof civic engagement was embodied in Civic Voluntarism\nModel, which had been formulated by S. Verba with col-\nleagues, where resources, motivation, and mobilization\nbecame the factors (Verba, Schlozman, & Brady, 1995).\nThese three factors reinforce each other and give their own-\ners cumulative political advantages.\nAllowing for the existence of relationship between indi-\nvidual and collective forms of civic engagement, the author\nproposes to consider membership in voluntary associations\nas civic practices. The conception of civic practices repre-\nsents the whole complex of reproduced, permanent, and sus-\ntainable actions. They are realizations of aspirations of the\nactive part of transitional society to make sociopolitical\ntransformations (Reznik, 2011). Citizens inform government\nabout their interests just owing to such behavior. In this\nrespect, civic practices are systematic, reproducible, and per-\nmanent actions of different social subjects (individuals and\ngroups) in public sphere, which are a form of realization of\ntheir own interests and provide existence, reproduction, and\ntransformation of social and political institutions. In the\nprocess of institutionalization of public sphere (Habermas,\ninformation and viewpoints, its subjects acquire the habit of\nforming and announcing their opinions, thus producing the\ncivic practices. Therewith, different traditions of social\norder stipulate differences in determination of civic prac-\ntices. Under conditions of high level of social differentiation\nin a society, the socioeconomic factor comes to the fore-\nground, because education, money, time expenditures, and\nso on, prove to be indispensable. However, the socioeco-\nnomic factor is not so decisive in the countries of total pros-\nperity. There appear other factors of particular importance,\nsuch as social capital, religious practices, and experience of\ncivic engagement. At the same time, if in stable democratic\nsocieties the involvement in voluntary associations may be\ndetermined by nonpolitical factors, in transitional society\nthe civic engagement of organizational character is mainly\ncombined with political participation. Thus, differences in\ndemocratic traditions and socioeconomic development of\ndifferent countries leave a mark on the sequence of factors\nof the first type.\nThe author in his analysis proposes to compare the extent\nof influence of determinants of involvement in voluntary\nassociations, which are described in the above approaches,\namong different European countries. Thus, the article aims to\nfind out the configuration of effect of the factors of involve-\nment in work for voluntary associations in the context of dif-\nferences of political and socioeconomic development of\nvarious European countries.\nTherefore, the two main hypotheses are as follows:\nHypothesis 1: The involvement in work for voluntary\norganizations is mainly determined by individual civic\nengagement of behavioral nature, because both individual\nand group forms of the civic engagement belong to civic\npractices as a common phenomenon.\nHypothesis 2: Configuration of the effect of other factors\nof involvement in voluntary organizations depends on\npolitical, cultural, and economic development of the\nsociety.\nData and Method\nIn terms of methodology, the study of civic practices requires\ncomparative or monitoring researches, because one can fix\nsustainability and reproducibility of practical actions only if\nthe effect of long-term behavioral tendencies of certain\ngroups that fall regularly within the sample is being observed.\nAnother method to differ civic practices from occasional\nphenomena is the analysis of their factors. Besides, estab-\nlishing factors' hierarchy and its comparison in dynamics\nalso allows one to ascertain the character of reproducibility\nand stability of the stimuli of civic practices. In this case,\ncross-cultural comparison is an auxiliary tool for revealing\nspecificity of membership in voluntary associations.\nThe empirical base is formed by the array of the third and\nsixth rounds of international comparative project European\nsurvey of population in European countries by the most\nessential sociological indices is conducted every 2 years in\nall countries following a single program and a sample that\nrepresents adult population of European countries. In 2003,\nthey organized an international consortium in Europe with\nthe aim to conduct a new monitoring project called European\nSocial Survey (www.europeansocialsurvey.org). Its first poll\nwas carried out in 2002, and it plans to conduct regular polls\nevery second year in the future. In the next rounds of research,\nthe project was joined not only by other EU countries but\nalso by Albania, Kosovo, Iceland, Israel, Norway, Russia,\nSwitzerland, Turkey, and Ukraine.\nThe ESS is one of the best as to methodological substan-\ntiation among the present-day international comparative proj-\nects based on the highest methodological standards of modern\nempirical sociological studies. This makes it possible to expect\na high quality of data collected by all national research groups\nand guarantees the highest possibility for real, comparative\nanalysis of these data. In each national study, a sampled popu-\nlation is people of the age of 15 and older. Each research team\nhad to ensure an effective sample size--no less than 1,500\nrespondents for countries with a population more than two\nmillion, and 800 respondents for countries with a population\nless than two million. In each country, taking into account their\nspecific sample design, they evaluated a design effect as a\nbasis for defining sample size: The sample should ensure the\nsame representation as a simple random sample of 1,500 (or\n800 if the country's population is not sufficiently large). Then,\nusing the preliminary estimation of the response rate (the pro-\nportion of respondents in a planned sample, which could be\nactually found and which would agree for an interview), they\ndefined the necessary sample size and constructed the sample\ndesign (Golovakha, Gorbachyk, & Panina, 2006).\nThe ESS questionnaire consists of the core (stable moni-\ntoring part) being repeated in all rounds of the survey and\ntwo to three blocks of questions (each block contains approx-\nimately 50 questions) related to a certain aspect included into\nonly one wave. The core of the questionnaire includes indi-\ncators of trust in the major institutions, interest in politics and\npolitical activity, social and political orientations, attitude to\nthe main social and moral values, social capital and social\nexclusion, well-being, and security. In addition, the monitor-\ning part includes basic social and demographic information,\nsuch as number of family members, educational background,\nemployment and job, nationality, ethnic and religious affilia-\ntion, living conditions of family, and so on.\nThe data were weighed following a standard procedure\n(design weights) for percentages in cross-tabulations.\nProcessing and statistical analysis of the data have been per-\nformed using the program package SPSS.\nThe method of multiple linear regressions was used for\nrevealing the factors of involvement in work for voluntary or\ncharitable organizations in European countries. This method\npermits one to study more accurately the influence of various\nfactors on the dependent variable with an ordinal scale. The\nmethod of stepwise entering of the model's factors is used to\nconstruct the multiple linear regressions. But in this case,\nconstruction of certain tables of regression equations for a\ngreater number of countries could create difficulties for com-\nparative analysis and increase considerably the paper vol-\nume. Thus, the method of automatic entering of the model's\nfactors was used for the sake of convenience and obvious-\nness, because a less number of coefficients permit us to\narrange them more densely in one table. For statistical accu-\nracy of the results' interpretation, the author supposes that\nthe factor in which the significance of the equation coeffi-\ncient is maximal (p  .001) should be considered influential.\nThe ordinal variable applied in ESS-3 and ESS-6 was\nused as the dependent one: \"In the past 12 months, how often\ndid you get involved in work for voluntary or charitable\norganizations?\"; it was measured by a 6-point scale with pos-\nsible variants of the answer \"1 = At least once a week; 2 = At\nleast once a month; 3 = At least once every 3 months; 4 = At\nleast once every 6 months; 5 = Less often; 6 = Never.\"\nAs independent variables used in ESS-3 array (see\nAppendix A in more detail), the following factors have been\ndistinguished: (a) socioeconomic status (education, paid\nwork, satisfaction with household's income), (b) social capi-\ntal (trust in others; meeting socially with friends, relatives, or\nwork colleagues; the number of people with whom one can\ndiscuss intimate and personal matters), (c) civic engagement\n(participation in social activities, help others not counting\nfamily/work/voluntary organizations, help or attending\nactivities organized in the local area), (d) religious practices,\n(e) index of political participation, and (f) control variable--\nthe respondent's age.\nAs independent variables used in ESS-6 array (see\nAppendix B in more detail), the following factors have been\ndistinguished: (a) socioeconomic status (education, paid\nwork, satisfaction with household's income), (b) social capi-\ntal (trust in others; meeting socially with friends, relatives, or\nwork colleagues; the number of people with whom one can\ndiscuss intimate and personal matters), (c) civic engagement\n(participation in social activities), (d) religious practices, (e)\nindex of political participation, and (f) control variable--the\nrespondent's age.\nResults\nFrequency distribution of the involvement in work for volun-\ntary or charitable organizations in each European country\nevidences for availability of differences according to the\nlevel of social development (see Table 1). The highest fre-\nquency is mainly present in West and North European coun-\ntries: Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, France,\nGreat Britain, the Netherlands, Norway, and Finland.

The lowest\nfrequency was observed in postsocialist countries (Albania,\nBulgaria, Czech Republic, Lithuania, Estonia, Poland,\nRussia, Slovakia, Ukraine, and Kosovo); Portugal and\nCyprus have joined these countries.\nSuch arrangement of countries is also observed when tak-\ning into account only those which took part at least once in\nthe work for voluntary or charitable organizations. The\nresults of ESS-3 show that about a half or more of population\nhave an experience of at least once-only involvement in the\nhorizontal networks of civil society in Norway, Austria,\nSwitzerland, the Netherlands, Finland, and Ireland. In post-\nsocialist countries (except for Slovenia, Romania, and\nLatvia) and Portugal, a share of one and more involvements\nvaries within about 24% and below. The results of ESS-6\nrepresent in total previous arrangements: A share of those\nwho were involved at least once in the work for voluntary or\ncharitable organizations equals about a half and above of the\npopulation of such countries as Norway, Germany,\nSwitzerland, the Netherlands, Iceland, Finland, Spain, and\nIreland. Instead, a share of about 30% and below was also\nreproduced in postsocialist countries. If the dynamics is\ntaken into consideration, population of Spain, Slovakia,\nSweden, and Russian Federation has demonstrated an\nincreasing involvement in the work for voluntary or charita-\nble organizations.\nThe setting of equations of multiple linear regressions in\nEuropean countries according to results of ESS-3 has\nrevealed differences in the influence of all factors (determi-\nnation coefficient adjusted R2) on the dependent ordinal vari-\nable of involvement in the work for voluntary or charitable\norganizations (see Tables 3 and 4). Rather satisfactory values\n(about .4 and above) are those of adjusted R2 indices in\nAustria, Portugal, Hungary, and Ukraine. This figure was the\nhighest in Ukraine--.529, that is, share of influence of all\nTable 1.

The factor \"help or attend-\ning activities in the local area\" is the biggest among all pre-\ndictors, which presented equations in most European\ncountries. Only in Belgium, Finland, and Sweden, the factor\nof political participation proved the most influential one. The\ninfluence of the above factors appeared to be mainly similar\nfor Austria and France. Instead, the factor \"help others not\ncounting family/work/voluntary organizations\" was the most\ninfluential for the Netherlands and Spain.\nParticipation in social activities and religious practices\nhas become less distributed factors of involvement in volun-\ntary organizations. The low level or absence of the effect of\nparticipation in social activities on the involvement in volun-\ntary organizations was mainly fixed (not allowing for such\ncases in Spain, Ireland, and Portugal) in postsocialist coun-\ntries (Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Poland, Russia,\nSlovenia, and Ukraine). Such a tendency is also traced in\nrespect of religious practices, when attending religious ser-\nvices has a weak effect or even no effect on the involvement\nin voluntary organizations in Bulgaria, Cyprus, Estonia,\nHungary, Latvia, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Slovakia, and\nUkraine.\nAmong the factors included in the regression model, such\nindependent variables as paid work, satisfaction with income\n(except for Belgium), and trust in people have no statistically\nsignificant effect on the involvement in work for voluntary or\ncharitable organizations.

Educational background turned out to\nbe influential in Cyprus, Spain, Poland, Portugal, and\nSlovenia.\nThe absence of some indices of civic engagement in the\ndata array of ESS-6 (help others not counting family/work/\nvoluntary organizations, help or attending activities in the\nlocal area and political participation) has decreased essen-\ntially the adjusted R2 index (see Tables 5 and 6), especially\nfor Switzerland, Bulgaria, and Ukraine. As a result, effect of\npolitical participation was prevalent. Participation in social\nactivities and religious practices proved something less but\nalso rather prevailing factors. The low level or the absence of\nthe effect of participation in social activities on the involve-\nment in voluntary organizations was fixed in Bulgtaaria,\nSwitzerland, Czech Republic, Iceland, Poland, Russian\nFederation, and Ukraine. Attending religious services has a\nweak effect or even no effect on the involvement in volun-\ntary organizations in Bulgaria, Switzerland, Estonia, and\nPoland.\nBesides, indices of social capital proved insignificant in\nmost countries. The factor of trust in others has manifested\nitself only for Great Britain, Italy, Lithuania, and Slovakia.\nThe factor \"meeting socially with friends, relatives, or work\ncolleagues\" was significant only for Czech Republic and\nIsrael.\nThe low level or the absence of the effect of participation\nin social activities on the involvement in voluntary organiza-\ntions has been mainly fixed (except for Switzerland and\nIceland) in postsocialist countries (Bulgaria, Czech Republic,\nHungary, Estonia, Iceland, Poland, Russian Federation, and\nUkraine). In contrast to the previous case (ESS-3), results of\nESS-6 show that attending religious services has an influ-\nence on the involvement in work for voluntary organizations\nin most European countries (the absence of this effect was\nfixed in Bulgaria and Switzerland). At the same time, effect\nof the index of discussion of intimate and personal problems\non the involvement in voluntary organizations was fixed in\nSlovenia and Slovakia.\nMoreover, the socioeconomic index (availability of paid\nwork) proved insignificant. In the same way, the index of\nsatisfaction with the household's income has not manifested\nany effect on the involvement in work for voluntary organi-\nzations in most countries (effect of this factor has been fixed\nonly in Belgium and Russian Federation). The factor of edu-\ncational background was significant in Lithuania, Poland,\nand Slovakia. The control variable of age has displayed its\neffect on the membership in voluntary organizations in\nAlbania, Belgium, Estonia, Spain, Norway, and Slovakia.\nConclusion\nThe major advantage of international comparative investiga-\ntions consists in preventing the reproduction of casual social\nphenomena, which are usually caused by a special situation\nin a certain society. The comparison of the factors' effect on\na certain phenomenon permits one to fix permanent stimuli,\nwhich are present at least in similar geographical environ-\nment and pretend to embrace general identity that has been\nformed under similar conditions of political and economic\ndevelopment. Due to comparative investigations, the most\nprevailing (among European countries) determinants of\ninvolvement in the work for voluntary organizations could\nbe revealed.\nIn general, we can state that Hypothesis 1 has been con-\nfirmed. The verification of effect of the sets of predictors\nwhich represent the above theoretical approaches has\nrevealed in general the advantage of such factors as civic\nengagement and political participation. The dynamics of\nreproduction and sequence of the effect of these predictors,\nas well as essential decrease of adjusted R2 indices when\nsome of them are absent confirm that membership in volun-\ntary organizations belongs to the phenomenon of civic prac-\ntices. The behavioral potential is common for these factors.\nCombining of civic engagement and political participation\nprovides active social subjects (both individual and group\nones) with resources and skills necessary for searching suc-\ncessful examples of civil behavior capable of becoming deci-\nsive in the functioning of civil society. Civic practices are\nstructured by forms of involvement, which in turn determine\nthe expediency of individual or collective method of defend-\ning interests. The analysis has proved that involvement in\nsocial activities and civic engagement in European countries\ncreates the basis for informal networks of social interaction;\nowing to this interaction, subjects acquire skills to form and\npromulgate their views, to exchange information and pro-\nduce in this way civic practices. Thus, civic practices become\na social resource for obtaining desirable social positions and\nbenefits, increasing chances in stratificational rivalry, and\ndirecting the process of political institutionalization of\nsociety.\nHowever, the author's supposition that the effect of other\nfactors related to the involvement in voluntary organizations\ndepends on political traditions and socioeconomic develop-\nment of the society has not obtained precise confirmation as\na result of analysis of two comparative studies. It may only\nbe asserted that the low level or absence of effect of the fac-\ntor of participation in social activities on the involvement in\nvoluntary organizations was mainly present in postsocialist\ncountries. Thus, nonpolitical behavioral factors of involve-\nment in voluntary organizations are more inherent in coun-\ntries with stable democracy and developed economy. The\nresults of regressions on the basis of ESS-3 concerning the\neffect of religious practices have inclined to the conclusion\nthat the absence of the effect of attending religious services\nwas mainly fixed in postsocialist countries. However, the\nresults of regressions on the basis of ESS-6 have demon-\nstrated that such a tendency was reproduced only in several\ncountries. The analysis has also shown that socioeconomic\nfactors and components of social capital as a whole do not\nTable 5.

Their inconsiderable influ-\nence was registered only in some countries.\nThe author's decision to use the method of automatic\nentering of the model's factors for building multiple linear\nregressions caused certain restrictions. For example, the\noptimal determination models have not been revealed.\nHowever, the use of stepwise procedures would make it pos-\nsible to remove the less significant predictors and to clarify\nthe hierarchy of influence of the rest independent variables.\nFor more detailed analysis of the determinants of involve-\nment in work for voluntary associations, it would be advis-\nable to focus on a limited number of countries. It would\nallow using more flexible procedures (forward, backward,\nstepwise) and building separate tables for each country.\nAppendix A\nDependent Variable Used in the Third Round of\nEuropean Social Survey (ESS-3) Data\nInvolvement in work for voluntary or charitable organiza-\ntions: Measured as based on Question E1. \"In the past\n12 months, how often did you get involved in work for\nvoluntary or charitable organizations?\" measured by a\n6-point scale with possible variants of answer \"1 = At\nleast once a week; 2 = At least once a month; 3 = At\nleast once every 3 months; 4 = At least once every 6\nmonths; 5 = Less often; 6 = Never.\"\nIndependent Variables Used in the ESS-3 Data\nAge: Measured as the number of full years of life.\nEducation: Country-specific question and codes for cod-\ning into ESS Coding Frame F6. \"What is the highest\nlevel of education you have achieved?\" by a 7-point\nscale, \"0 = Not completed primary education; 1 =\nPrimary or first stage of basic; 2 = Lower secondary or\nsecond stage of basic; 3 = Upper secondary; 4 = Post\nsecondary, nontertiary; 5 = First stage of tertiary; 6 =\nSecond stage of tertiary.\"\nAs to Cyprus in the array ESS-3, national coding by a\n7-point scale was used for measuring the education\nlevel \"0 = Not completed primary education; 1 =\nPrimary or first stage of basic; 2 = Lower secondary or\nsecond stage of basic; 3 = Upper secondary; 4 =\nDiploma (Tertiary not university); 5 = Bachelor/\nMaster/PhD; 6 = Other.\"\nPaid work: Fictitious dichotomous variable, which adopts\nthe value 1 for those who have indicated in the answer\nto Question F8c: \"And which of these descriptions best\ndescribes your situation (in the last 7 days)?\" the posi-\ntion \"paid work (or away temporarily) (employee, self-\nemployed, working for your family business),\" and the\nvalue 0 for those who have not indicated this position.\nSatisfaction with household's income: Measured as based\non Question F33, \"Which of the descriptions on this\ncard comes closest to how you feel about your house-\nhold's income nowadays?\" with possible variants of\nanswer \"1 = Living comfortably with present income;\n2 = Coping with present income; 3 = Finding it diffi-\ncult with present income; 4 = Finding it very difficult\nwith present income.\"\nTrust in others: Measured as based on Question A8.\n\"Generally speaking, would you say that most people\ncan be trusted, or that you can be too careful in dealing\nwith people?
