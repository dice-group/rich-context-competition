    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis study proposes a model of interwoven careers. This topic stems from interviews that showed that although future deck\nofficers expect their future career at sea to last from 10 to 15 years and that the rest will be spent on shore, the maritime\ntransport industry's only goal is to attract and retain them as seagoing officers. This ambivalent situation leads us to develop\na model of interwoven careers that is new. It takes into account both the individual and the organization. This is neither a\ntraditional career model nor a boundaryless model. We used Morin's complexity theory to understand boundaries, which\nmove \"within\" organizations when, for instance, maritime industries offer deck officers to work on shore and sometimes at\nsea, and \"across\" organizations when they develop partnerships to help their employees attain their goals as well as retaining\nthem in their organization.\n",

These skill shortages lead employers to want to retain\nthe employees that they need. Retention management uses\nHR strategies that are effective to reduce voluntary turnover\nof employees, which organizations find undesirable (De Vos\nThe issue of retention is the opposite of the intention to\nleave. Mobley, Horner, and Hollingsworth (1978) show an\nincrease in dissatisfied employees at work wanting to leave\ntheir job. There are many studies on the relationship between\ncausal variables and the intention to leave (or turnover):\nstudies focusing on remuneration (Dale-Olsen, 2006;\ntraining (Davies, Taylor, & Savery, 2001), the selection pro-\n(Min, 2007), work life balance (D'Annunzio-Green,\nMaxwell, Watson, & Deery, 2008), the relationship between\nworkers and their superiors, and commitment to supervisors\n2009). Other researchers tackle factors that may predict turn-\nover. Griffeth etal. (2000) point out in their meta-analysis\nthat the best predictors of turnover are job satisfaction, orga-\nnizational commitment, job search, the comparison of\nalternatives (compared with the baseline), withdrawal, and\nintention to leave.\nWhen employees leave their organization, this has an\neffect both on individual careers and on the organization. In\na labor market marked by skill shortages, there are individu-\nals who have no organizational boundaries and there are\norganizations which want to retain employees inside their\nboundaries. The maritime transport industry is currently\nexperiencing some skill shortages especially among deck\nofficers despite their efforts to retain them. Our research\nquestion stems from interviews showing that future deck\nofficers expect their career at sea to last from 10 to 15 years.\nWe therefore wish to know the possible consequences of this\non the maritime transport industry and propose a model of\ninterwoven careers, that is, mixing careers within and across\norganizational boundaries. In this article, we start by review-\ning career literature, the maritime context, and some com-\nplexity theories. We continue with our methodological and\nepistemological choices, and finish with our results and a\ndiscussion.\n1Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Rimouski, Canada\nCorresponding Author:\nMarie-No\u00eblle Albert, Professor, Sciences de gestion, Universit\u00e9 du\nRimouski, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada.\nEmail: marie-noelle_albert@uqar.ca\nFrom a Seafarer's Career Management to\nthe Management of Interwoven Sea- and\nShore-Based Careers\nMarie-No\u00eblle Albert1, Nadia Lazzari Dodeler1, and Emmanuel Guy1\n Keywords\nboundaries, career, complexity, maritime transport industry\n2 SAGE Open\nCareers\nAlthough traditional careers within an organization, often\nfocusing on the same job, are characterized by hierarchical\nadvancement without taking into account individuals' envi-\nronment, new forms of careers focus on individuals'mobility\nwithin a professional field or the labor market (DeFillippi &\nies have often referred to the concept of the Protean career.\nD. T. Hall describes it as the opposite of a traditional career,\nin which the person is in charge (whereas, traditionally, it is\nthe organization), the degree of mobility is high, and the core\nvalues are freedom and growth rather than advancement.\nDeFillippi and Arthur (1994) are among the first authors to\nspeak of \"boundaryless careers\" based on the individual and\nnot on the organization. This kind of career would replace\nthe traditional one (e.g., Arthur, 2008; Arthur, Inkson, &\nmanage careers both at the individual and at the organiza-\ntional levels. To Gunz, Bergmann Lichten, and Long (2002),\nboundaries could enclose several kinds of social systems,\nsuch as organizational, regional, or industry. Dries, Van\nAcker, and Verbruggen (2012) explain that contemporary\ncareer literature makes three general assumptions: First, the\nbest people are in boundaryless careers; second, these kinds\nof careers are usually more satisfying; and, third, the empha-\nsis is placed on career self-management rather than organiza-\ntional career management (Forrier, Sels, & Stynen, 2009).\nEmployees have the ability to manage their careers as \"free\nagents\" (Tulgan, 2001). In recent years, this concept has\nbeen more criticized and more nuanced: Organizational\ncareers are not completely extinct, and boundaryless careers\nare not necessarily better for people (Dries & Verbruggen,\nincrease insecurity and anxiety among employees. These\nauthors do not find proof that boundaryless careers exist.\nTheir sample included managers who were bound by many\nfactors, such as location, spouse's occupation, family obliga-\ntions, and so forth.\nSuper's (1957) model shows that individuals go through\nfour stages of career development during their professional\nlives: exploration, establishment, maintenance, and disen-\ngagement. Recently, research has shown that the mainte-\nnance phase can be shortened, that exploration and\nestablishment can happen several times, and that there can be\nmultiple occurrences of disengagement instead of just one at\nthe end of a career. Other researchers have shown that the\npriorities of individual careers change. The theory of career\nself-concept (talents, skills, values, motivation, and needs)\ndeveloped by individuals throughout their professional expe-\nriences can be articulated around eight anchors among which\nonly one would be dominant. The \"technical\" anchor refers\nto individuals who are mainly interested in the technical side\nof their work; the \"managerial\" anchor refers to individuals\nwho prefer skills related to management; the \"autonomy/\nindependence\" anchor refers to individuals who wish to\nbecome their own boss and work at their own pace; the\n\"security/stability\" anchor refers to persons seeking a career\nthat gives them stability and a long-term employment; the\n\"creativity/stability\" anchor refers to those who have entre-\npreneurial attitudes and want to work in an environment that\nallows them to be creative; the \"dedication to a cause\" anchor\nis found in individuals who wish to help others; the \"pure\nchallenge\" anchor refers to people who like challenges and\nwant to solve problems considered intractable; and finally,\nthe \"quality of life\" anchor refers to individuals looking for\nsatisfaction and harmony between work and family life.\nHowever, the theory of career anchors is challenged by\nmore recent studies, including those of L\u00e9vy-Leboyer,\nLouche, and Rolland (2006); Martineau, Wils, and Tremblay\nchange their anchors during their work life and that many\nanchors can coexist in the same individual. Indeed, as noted\nby Feldman and Bolino (1996), this multiplicity of anchors is\ndue to the fact that some anchors respond to career choices,\nwhile other anchors characterize the individual's needs and\nvalues at a given moment of a career. According to Super\nsional and personal life also seems to be an important ele-\nment for individuals in the maintenance phase; for other\nindividuals, it is a priority (Ng & Feldman, 2007).\nFinally, it is important to note that historically the theory\nof careers is constructed from models based on male partici-\npants (Sullivan, Mainiero, Perrew\u00e9, & Ganster, 2007). Thus,\nwhether we are talking about traditional or new, these career\nmodels do not seem to fit with the complexity of women's\ncareers. Moreover, studies are increasingly focusing on chal-\nlenges faced by men to reconcile work and family. All these\ntheories reveal turning points in careers often related to fam-\nily responsibilities. It therefore seems desirable that organi-\nzations implement a human resources management (HRM)\nthat focuses on each individual for the purpose of job reten-\ntion. There is tension between individuals who aspire to\ncareers without organizational boundaries and organizational\ngoals which seek to retain employees, as explained in the\nfollowing section.\nThe Maritime Context\nWhen maritime studies turned to career issues, they histori-\ncally tended to frame the problem in terms of the supply and\ndemand of manpower. For example, McConville (1979) pon-\nders on the threats posed by the decline of British seafarers in\nthe wake of the raise of open registry flags. Most influential\nin this trend are certainly the surveys led by the Baltic and\nInternational Maritime Council (BIMCO) and the\nInternational Shipping Federation (ISF). This exercise is\nmade of a series of national surveys supported by both\nAlbert et al. 3\nemployers and unions, first conducted in 1990 and updated\nevery 5 years, evaluated the number of ratings and officers\navailable to man the world fleet, as well as their nationality\nand their age profiles. The surveys gave rise to a number of\ncritics among researchers (Obando-Rojas, 1999) but were\nnonetheless instrumental in documenting upcoming skill\nshortage, in particular for officers. They contributed to estab-\nlishing the feared shortage as a central issue for many ship-\nping advocacy groups worldwide (Fei & Lu, 2015; Leggate,\n& Norsofiana, 2013). In the French\u00adCanadian context, the\nmanpower shortage paradigm is one of the dominant ratio-\nnales of the Comit\u00e9 sectoriel de main-d'oeuvre de l'industrie\nmaritime, which recently commissioned a new study to eval-\nuate the future balance between supply and demand for job\npositions in the St. Lawrence maritime industry (Zins\nBeauchesne et associ\u00e9s, 2013). This focus on the number of\navailable certified seafarers not only frames the debate in\nresearch circles but also orients policy responses toward\nrecruitment. Public awareness campaigns--aimed at young\npeople completing their high school studies, and sending the\nmessage that seafaring offers great career opportunities with\nhigh salaries and technology-filled tasks--appear as the\nmost frequent response to avoid the apprehended skill short-\nage in Canada and in Europe (Langevin, Beaudry, Guy, &\nFrenette, 2009). The immediate goal is to increase the num-\nber of cadets in training. In contrast, recent non-specific\nindustry contributions to HRM frequently adopt a more qual-\nitative approach focusing on personal motivation and satis-\nfaction at work. The argument is that in a competitive context\nin which skilled workers are rare, employers should pay\ngreater attention to the retention of current employees. A few\nrecent contributions take this perspective with respect to the\nmaritime industry. Cahoon, Caesar, and Fei (2014) and\nCaesar, Cahoon, and Fei (2015) expose how proactive HRM\ncan develop and maintain a sustainable seafarer workforce.\nDe Silva, Stanton, and Stanton (2011) show the importance\nof long-term career prospects, smooth and fair recruitment\nprocess, employee-friendly organizational culture, and a bet-\nter relationship with maritime authorities for seafarer reten-\ntion. Moving from seagoing to shore-based employment is\nrecognized as an important phase in this perspective. Haka,\nBorch, Jensen, and Leppin (2011) explore difficulties\ninvolved in this transition and where they originate. In the\nrecent past, seagoing careers stopped when children (often at\nthe second one) were born or when a shore-based job oppor-\ntunity appeared (Honor\u00e9, 2010). Thomas, Sampson, and\nZhao (2003) show the impact of work conditions on seafar-\ners' families and explore how companies could minimize the\nimpact of a seafaring lifestyle.\nShip officers also seem to be drawn to boundaryless\ncareers. Indeed, the careers of ship officers begin by training\nat sea, allowing sailors to access all careers in the maritime\nindustry, as well as structuring individual careers in two\nstages, that is, one at sea and one on land. As we will\ndemonstrate with the empirical material presented in this\narticle, deck cadets who we interviewed envisioned working\nat sea only for a few years (for different reasons). Some com-\nplexity theories helped us better understand the tension\nbetween the expectations of cadets and those of the\nindustry.\nSome Complexity Theories\nEtymologically, the word complexity comes from the French\nword complexit\u00e9, which comes from the Latin complexus\nwhich mean interwoven (Edmonds & Gershenson, 2013).\nAlhadeff-Jones (2008) describes three generations of com-\nplexity theories. In the first generation, we can find some\ninformation and communication theories, or cybernetics, that\nemerge from the Second World War. In the second genera-\ntion, there are studies developed during the 1960s such as\nSimon (1962). Two kinds of paths are distinguished for the\nthird generation (1980s). The first path is often encountered\nin the English-speaking field of non-linear dynamics, evolu-\ntionary biology, and artificial sciences. The second path is\nlinked to French thinkers such as Le Moigne or Morin. For\nthe purpose of this study, we have aligned our concept of\ncomplexity with the latter group.\nMorin (2007) proposes a difference between two kinds of\ncomplexity. He calls the first one \"restricted complexity\"\nbecause it is limited to systems that are empirically complex\nsince they come in a variety of processes with multiple rela-\ntionships, which are interdependent and associated retroac-\ntively. In fact, complexity is never questioned nor thought of\nfrom an epistemological perspective. In the restricted com-\nplexity, scientists want to \"decomplexify\" to find universal\nprinciple. On the contrary, generalized complexity \"relates to\nour knowledge as human beings, individuals, persons and\ncitizens\" (Morin, 2007, p. 21). We based our choice of epis-\ntemological paradigm on the generalized complexity.\nComplexity is not merely composed of indicators of tension\nor conflicts occurring within organizations. If this was the\ncase, it would only be difficulties--albeit complex ones--\nneeding to be clarified for good decision making to occur.\nThey can neither seem to be reduced to a simple source of\nuncertainty that should be factored in by good practices of\norganizational risk management, nor should they be seen as\nsolvable by improved communication practices. In other\nwords, as a conceptual framework, we refute considering\ncomplexity as a negative problematic dimension. Rather, we\npropose to view it as fundamental characteristics of manage-\nrial situations. At individual, organizational, and institutional\nlevels, complexities exist and are ever present. Therefore, the\nchallenge faced by researchers appears to be integrating in\ntheir thinking the ambivalent nature of their object of study\nas opposed to study factors causing complexity, to explore\nways around it. Hence, this simple theoretical posture has\nimportant methodological implications that we will discuss\nin the next section.\n4 SAGE Open\nEpistemology and Method\nThe paradigm of pragmatic constructivism is based on radi-\ncal constructivism as conceptualized by von Glasersfeld\n(2001), Le Moigne, as well as Dewey and Piaget (Avenier,\n2010). In this epistemological paradigm, knowledge neither\nclaims to reflect an ontological reality (for nobody could\nrationally prove its existence) nor does it reveal its character-\nistics when this reality exists. The pragmatic constructivism\nis not so extreme that it rejects the notion of essence entirely\n(Grint, 1998). In this paradigm, while knowledge is being\nconstructed, there is no disjunction between the inquirer and\nthe phenomenon being inquired into (Avenier, 2010). They\nsimply cannot be separated because what results from the\nobserver's viewpoint (an explicit or implicit theoretical\nhypothesis) is that which influences observations. Pragmatic\nconstructivism considers that Truth is meaningless because\nof the way knowledge is built from human representations to\ngive meaning to situations in which people are involved.\nTherefore, producing knowledge does not mean having a\ntrue representation of reality but rather possessing ways and\nmeans to understand life.\nReflexive work is what researchers do when they behave\nas reflexive practitioners of scientific research. It consists of\ntracking what seems self-evident and digging into both the\nimplicit assumptions and the deep meaning of the notions\nthat are used or newly introduced. The researcher often uses\na large body of academic literature to understand local\nknowledge, not to seem scientific but to stand back and\nunderstand it differently (Albert & Couture, 2015).\nThis methodological process is schematized in Figure 1.\nIt starts with the definition of the research topic. With their\npractical experiences and their theoretical knowledge,\nresearchers can build an initial model (pre-model). Some\nexperiential testimonio (Albert & Couture, 2014) from prac-\ntitioners have been iteratively investigated, reformulated,\nand interpreted in literature. This process makes it possible\nfor researchers to highlight theoretical gaps. In interpreting\nlocal knowledge, researchers can build generic knowledge\nthat can be communicated to the scientific community and\nto practitioners. This knowledge can be appropriated by\npractitioners and contextualized again to become guidelines\nfor action. Some feedback on this possible activation may\nhelp to improve this knowledge. This research therefore rep-\nresents an abductive process, that is to say, a constant back\nand forth motion between empirical information and the\ntheories and concepts used to understand this process.\nIn this article, we present the first loop in this process.\nWe investigated some testimonies and interpreted them with\nFigure 1. Methodological process.\nAlbert et al. 5\nliterature. We produced some generic knowledge and com-\nmunicate them. This knowledge allows us to pursue our\ninvestigation and start a second loop. For the exploratory\nstep of the research, we interviewed five deck cadets and\nthree professors from a maritime institute in the hopes of\nunderstanding how to manage the careers of future deck\nofficers. Participants had completed about two thirds of\ntheir sea time and courses. Teachers were deck officers who\ngo back at sea every year. Interviews were conducted with a\nguide (Patton, 2002). Some issues to be explored have been\nlisted (how deck cadets expect to live their future career at\nsea, if they anticipate a boundaryless or a more traditional\ncareer, how teachers choose to stop their seagoing career,\nand how they expect their future career at sea or ashore).\nThey are similar to the informal conversational interview\n(Patton, 2002) on career choices of the participant and their\ncareer aspirations. This kind of interview resembles more\nlike a chat, during which the participants may sometimes\nforget that they are being interviewed. Most of the questions\nasked flow from the immediate context.\nThis kind of instrument provides more complex informa-\ntion than standardized open-ended interview, which is more\nconsistent with our paradigm choice. We are aware that it is\nimpossible to make generalizations as our sample was small.\nThis was a first loop in our process. However, this is not a\nvalidity criterion in the paradigm of pragmatic constructiv-\nism. The epistemic work related to each interview is more\nimportant than the number of participants. The objective is\nnot to validate and generalize a model, but to build knowl-\nedge that can make sense and be reinterpreted by others. We\npresented the results of this study to practitioners who were\ninterested. In pragmatic constructivism, this pragmatic inter-\nest is a quality criterion.\nResults and Discussion\nWe interviewed cadets who had completed about two thirds\nof their sea time and courses, and who wished to continue in\nthis career. We know that many cadets do not continue in the\n2010); they usually graduate knowing they will not work at\nsea.\nIn the words of an experienced teacher:\nAnd I think that those who don't see themselves in the process,\nquickly, from the moment they come on board as officer cadet,\nwill know if they like it or not.\nParticipants said they enjoyed life at sea but were not sure\nthey wished to continue as deck officers until their\nretirement.\nA cadet who expected to work about 15 years at sea:\nWell, I'm finishing my course next year, and I really intend to\nsail. Mainly locally, I think. I think I would like to do one or two\nforeign going trips. But I prefer the Gulf, the river, maybe the\nlakes too. I really liked my experience on lakes, too, the seaway.\nI prefer coastal navigation, maneuvering, berthing, loading/\nunloading. I find it . . . but the foreign going trip, we have to\nadmit it, it's the foreign going certificate that we'll get. I'd still\nhope to use it one day. But, actually, to make a living\nprofessionally, I imagine myself more onshore, near the coast.\n. . . At least, it's sailing to get my master certificates because it\nopens doors onshore too. It's a certificate that allows you to\nwork on smaller boats, yes, but always as a master. For me, the\nobjective is to aim higher so that I have more options. At least 15\nyears, I hope. 15 years, maybe less, let's say more or less 5%.\nA cadet who wanted to continue, but just part-time:\nUp to now, I'm really happy with my internships and experience.\nWell, obviously, when I get there, I'll be 39 years old. So if I\nuntil I'm 65 years old. So, I'll probably slow down when I reach\nwork. A captain gets a lot more. Since I've been back at school\n. . . we've been able to live on $30,000 per year, my girlfriend,\nmy daughter and me. So, that's it, do I work to make money or\ndo I work to save money to do more on my time off? In my case,\nI choose the second. So, instead of working 6 months making\nA cadet who wanted more opportunities:\nDo this [for my entire career]? Maybe not. Well, of course, over\nthe years, you go up the ladder and get better jobs. You become\nchief officer, captain, and from there you can choose what you\nwant to do because the doors are open to you.\nA young woman cadet who wished to work only about 10\nto 15 years at sea but was open to going back to sea after:\nMaybe 15 years, about. Until, well, right now I'm 21 years old.\n. . . work in admin, most likely. In a company office. . . . the only\nreason to stop, right now, would be to have a family, to have\nchildren. So, I think, 30 or 35 is pretty much the limit. So, that's\nmainly why. Maybe after having my kids, when we're older, I\ncould certainly get back on board.\nAccording to Sullivan etal. (2007), it is important to offer\nother career models to women who want to reconcile work\nand family. Such new models may be interesting for an\nincreasing number of men who also want to find a balance\nbetween their work and family life. This is consistent with\nthe findings of Williams and Savickas (1990). For this rea-\nson, it is important to create new career models.\nAll of the cadets interviewed had established that they\nliked life at sea and expressed commitment to start a seafar-\ning career. All voiced the wish to obtain their master mariner\ncertification. However, all had already planned to stop work-\ning at sea in 10 to 15 years. As such, it appeared difficult to\nseparate sea and shore-based careers. In a study on French\n6 SAGE Open\nmaritime industries, Honor\u00e9 (2010) shows that a seafarer's\ncareer is usually a sequence of periods of activity at sea and\nashore. He proposes to develop a model that creates career\npaths for alternating periods, in the more or less long term,\nspent at sea and spent ashore. Thus, it would be important for\nthe maritime industry to manage these two kinds of interwo-\nven careers. This is close to Morin's (2001) dialogical prin-\nciple that combines two notions or principles, whether\nantinomic or antagonistic, and therefore according to the\nAristotelian logic, while they should exclude one another, in\npractice, they appear complementary, indissociable, and\nindispensable to understand a particular phenomenon.\nTeachers could work both at shore and at sea.\nAn experienced teacher:\nIt's something [boarding once in a while] that I think is\ninteresting because it allows me to keep a direct contact with the\nindustry. It also allows me to keep my name in the network,\nwhich is a good thing, and allows me to stay up to date in the\nfield regarding the various rules and regulations, and how one\nexperiences being a seafarer.\nA new teacher:\nI'll go back to sail during the summer because I still love sailing.\nHowever, it could be difficult to go back to sea after a few\nyears spent ashore. For Barnett, Gatfield, Overgaard, Pekcan,\nand Graveson (2006), it is hard for a seafarer who has been\nashore for more than 5 to7 years to adapt well to modern sea\nlife. Even if there is a lack of officers and an interest in for-\nmer officers, it may be tough for them to return to sea.\nHowever, this is contrary to a teacher's experience:\nIt depends on the person. Some will stop. I knew a captain who\nstopped for 4 to 5 years. He was completely out of the business,\nstudied in accounting, was working in a small accounting office,\nwhen he noticed that his spouse had more free time that he'd\nthought. So, he decided to go back to the sea. But there are other\npeople who retire or come ashore after a certain amount of time\nbecause they have to. The maritime industry being such a small\nworld, word of mouth is all you need to find yourself on a boat.\nYou ask, \"Who needs a captain? Do you know a captain?\" \"Yes,\ncaptain so and so, he hasn't worked in x number of years, but I\ndon't know if he still feels like it.\" So, 3 or 4 phone calls later,\npeople start coming out of the woodwork! There can be a culture\nshock for those who haven't sailed in a long time because they\nhaven't kept their certificates up to date. They need to write their\nexams again. They start studying again, and learn the changes that\nwere made. There is less culture shock for Canadian vessels than\nforeign vessels. Someone who has always sailed in Canada and\ngoes to another country will find it harder. Someone who has sailed\nfor other countries or here all there life will find it hard too if they\nend up here. It's not the same reality, not the same mentality either.\nThis verbatim implies more than a bridge from seagoing\nto shore-based employment; it means recognizing that the\ntwo may be closely knit. Employers have to anticipate the\nsecond part of their seagoing staff's career to be more pro-\nductive. For some crewing managers this may seem counter-\nproductive. It may be judged \"dangerous\" to suggest to\nseafarers to work ashore. However, interviews clearly show\nthat cadets started their career already with this in mind.\nThere is a need to take into account this reality and to man-\nmetaphor to show the importance of looking ahead in busi-\nness. Firms are like ships in storms. Ships need radars and\nfirms need to look ahead. According to Lesca (2008), look-\ning ahead or anticipating means detecting warning signs of a\npossible change in the environment, to act as soon as possi-\nble before the change is complete. To do this, firms must be\nactive and not just wait for information to come to them.\nWithout anticipation, a firm is like a ship caught in a storm\nwithout radar, it would probably be inefficient. Lesca (2008)\ndistinguishes anticipation from forecast. With forecast, we\nexpect a unique solution and certitude, and we are angry if\nwhat was predicted does not happen. By anticipating, we can\nprepare several plans and choose the most appropriate when\nthe time comes. We are ready to act efficiently and not just\nreact to the environment. Anticipation is really important in\na complex environment. Human beings are complex. They\nare non-trivial machines, not only because the outside\nobserver cannot predict all human behavior with certainty\nbut also because humans carry in themselves a principle of\nuncertainty that is their freedom. They are non-trivial\nmachines because they have the possibility of deviating from\nthe norm, they have a potential for catalysis, they can dis-\ncover, and they can make decisions. Each invention and cre-\nation reveals the non-trivial nature of the human mind\nViljoen and M\u00fcller (2012) explore their understanding of\nrelationships between seafarers and their families. These\nauthors show how such relationships are complex and con-\ntradictory. Seafarers have to manage different purposes that\nseem to be opposed. So, their Self has integrated these con-\ntradictions, and the seafarer may or may not choose to priori-\ntize them.\nAn experienced teacher:\nThe other phenomenon is that those who sail for a long time will\nfind that the people around them change a lot. We have students\nwho keep their girlfriends all along. She may or may not\nunderstand that as a cadet you do go to sea, but once it's done\nhe'll be home more often, or whatever. Except that when young\nofficers start to sail, they try to get to sea as quickly as possible,\nand when the people around them are faced with this reality--\nthat what they lived during training is what their career will be\nlike--some couples find it hard and break up. Some survive it,\nbut some don't. So, then, this creates a change, and I think that\nit's a determining factor, it's the willingness to prioritize either\nfamily life, life onshore, or life at sea.\nEmployers cannot act on seafarers'families or friends, but\nthey can obtain information about them and learn about their\nfeelings to better anticipate. In this way, they can discover\nAlbert et al. 7\nthe different career anchors for each seafarer. Indeed, deck\nofficers (as other workers) can change their anchors through-\nout their working lives, and several anchors can coexist\nEach officer is a person. A person is both unique and\nmulti-faceted, different from others. Hence, a person cannot\nbe understood by observing only one facet, and though\ngrasping all of them may seem difficult, researchers and spe-\ncialists must keep in mind a person's multi-faceted composi-\ntion (Mel\u00e9, 2012). Each individual lives his experiences as a\nsingular subject (Morin, 2001). For instance, among the\ncadets interviewed, some liked routine work, whereas others\navoided it. A unique optimal solution is therefore unlikely.\nCompanies have to build several models to answer the needs\nof their seagoing workforce. Without HRM centered on per-\nsons--who they are and their aspirations--companies\nexpose themselves to increased hidden costs associated with\npoor retention and the loss of precious operational expertise.\nAlthough management often only looks into the costs related\nto their division, there are numerous other hidden costs\n(Garman, Corbett, Grady, & Benesh, 2005). It may be less\ncostly for the organization to consider all of the skills avail-\nable in an organization as well as the individual's aspirations,\neven if they are not measurable. Happy people are less\nstressed. Thus, the American Institute of Stress estimates that\nwork-related stress costs American companies over US$300\nbillion per year (Bishara & Schipani, 2009). Thinking HRM\ndifferently in the maritime industry may help companies\navoid a certain amount of recruiting and all costs related to\ntraining, absenteeism, and presenteeism (Cascio & Boudreau,\n[C]areer options need to be explained at an early stage because\nGenerationYmay make their career choices on those that provide\nthe most opportunities. Perhaps at best, the shipping company\nshould be intending on retaining the seafarer in the organization\nwhether this is at sea or onshore. The second option is attempting\nto retain the seafarer within the shipping industry to ensure the\nindustry retains valuable and experienced staff. (p. 8)\nFor these reasons, it is time for the maritime industry to\npropose new career models to attract young people and retain\nthem in the industry as a whole and not only at sea. This\ninvolves getting to know people, their lives, their aspirations,\ntheir career anchors, and so on, to offer adequate training and\nmanage with complexity cannot be managed, but it is possi-\nble to manage with ambivalence because a person is both\nrational and non-rational (Morin, 2001). If we want to put\nthings in small boxes to put them in order, we cannot manage\nwith ambivalence. The maritime industry should therefore\nmanage persons by taking into account the importance of\nmanaging with ambivalence. It should be important to con-\nceive of deck officer careers not as disjunctive but preferably\nas the management of interwoven sea and shore-based\ncareers. This could be in the same organization or in a\nmaritime industry network. Araujo, Dubois, and Gadde\n(2003) conclude with the notion of indirect capabilities of\nfocusing interfirm networks to move conventional boundaries\nin organizations. Indirect capabilities are required to access\ncomplementary and dissimilar capabilities detained by third\nparties (Loasby, 1998). Trust among organizations plays an\nimportant role in multi-partner alliances and poses difficulties\nto its implementation (Thorgren, Wincent, & Eriksson, 2011).\nThis construction of collective actions between organizations\nshould be viewed in a dynamic way through the concept of\n\"interaction\" and not just the static concept of \"sharing.\" This\ndialogical mediation allows inter-organizational cooperation\n(Lorino & Mourey, 2013). So, cooperation between organiza-\ntions should be seen as an alternative coordination mecha-\nnism to market and hierarchies (Araujo et\nOrganization boundaries should change with cooperation\nmechanisms. Future deck officers expect boundaryless\ncareers. Recruitment and retention policies for at sea work\nonly are neither sufficient nor efficient. We need to move\nbeyond traditional boundary career management. New mod-\nels must be invented by maritime management to remain\naligned with seafarers' expectations and actions. This new\nboundaryless career model must not be organized by individ-\nuals or disempowered organizations; it should be managed by\nboth organizations (and organization networks) and people.\nConclusion\nIn this article, we presented the results of our interviews and\nsuggestions regarding how to manage the seagoing and\nshore-based employment of officers as interwoven careers.\nOur discussion enabled us to propose the development of\nnew career models for future deck officers. These models\nneed some changes. Employers should anticipate employees'\nwish to change career paths. To do this, they must learn about\ntheir deck officers'lives, aspirations, projects, and so on, and\naccept a type of management that includes ambivalence. If\nemployers do this, they may limit some hidden costs and\nbecome more efficient. The interwoven career model that we\npropose is new. It takes into account both the individual and\nthe organization. This is neither a traditional career nor a\nboundaryless career model. Employees could change within\nand across organizations. Ambivalent situations experienced\nby maritime industries are often unacknowledged and hidden\nbecause they are disturbing. Ambivalence cannot be deemed\nusual. These complex realities lead us to propose a complex\nsolution where all factors are linked and interwoven even if\nthis leads to a paradigm revolution. Indeed, this complex\nsolution requires accepting to find solutions in non-\ntraditional ways. For this solution to work, one agrees to\nbeing open to moving boundaries both within organizations\n(when, for instance, maritime industries propose that deck\nofficers be on shore and sometimes at sea) and across organi-\nzations (when they develop partnerships to retain their\nemployees as well as help the latter attain their goals).\n8 SAGE Open\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAguilar, F.
