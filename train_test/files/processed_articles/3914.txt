Several theoretical approaches, not all of them mutually exclusive,\nshow considerable potential in this regard (e.g., Lukaszewski and Roney, 2011; Nettle,\n2006). In this paper, I test hypotheses derived from the Life History Strategy (LHS)\napproach to understanding personality variation (Belsky, Steinberg, and Draper, 1991;\nLife History Theory draws attention to the trade-offs that organisms face in\nallocating limited energy among the competing demands of growth, reproduction\n(including mating and parenting), and bodily maintenance/repair (MacArthur and Wilson,\n1967; Pianka, 1970). A \"slow\" LHS prioritizes (1) somatic effort over reproductive effort,\n(2) parental and kin investment over mating effort, (3) offspring quality over offspring\nquantity, and (4) future reproduction over current reproduction, whereas a \"fast\" LHS sets\nHEXACO and life history strategy\nthe opposite priorities. Natural selection is expected to shape suites of co-adapted traits that\nenable individuals to consistently pursue an LHS at a particular point on the fast-slow\nFrom these principles, proponents of LHS-based personality theory have formulated\nthe following arguments. First, a slow LHS will be associated with longer-term planning\n(less future discounting--e.g., Wilson and Daly, 1997) than a fast LHS (Figueredo et al.,\n2006). Because humans are \"ultrasocial\" and dependent on culturally transmitted\nknowledge (Hill, Barton, and Hurtado, 2009), and because the reproductive payoffs to\ncooperative social relationships are often delayed over multi-year periods (e.g., Gurven,\nAllen-Arave, Hill, and Hurtado, 2000), a slow LHS in H. sapiens is expected to be\nassociated with personality traits that prioritize sociality, altruism (both kin-selected and\nreciprocal), and adherence to social norms (Rushton, 1985). Individuals pursuing a slow\nLHS are expected to form stable, long-term mating relationships. Higher investment in\nsomatic effort should lead to improved psychological health, including greater positive\nemotionality, less negative emotionality, and greater capacity for, and enjoyment of,\nintellectual effort. In contrast, a fast LHS will be associated with a focus on short-term\ngains (including short-term mating strategies), an antagonistic social orientation, and poorer\nphysical and psychological health.\nWith respect to the Five-Factor Model (FFM: Digman, 1990; McCrae and John,\n1992), this argument has generated the predictions that a slower LHS will be associated\nwith higher levels of Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Emotional Stability\n(the inverse of Neuroticism) and Openness to Experience. Some data support these\npredictions (Dunkel and Decker, 2010; Figueredo, V\u00e1squez, Brumbach, and Schneider,\nThough the FFM remains the most frequently used structural model of human\npersonality, it has been challenged in recent years by the six-factor HEXACO model\nmodel's dimensions (Extraversion, Conscientiousness and Openness to Experience) are\nbroadly similar to their FFM counterparts. HEXACO Emotionality and Agreeableness\nrepresent alternative rotations of FFM Neuroticism and Agreeableness. Two of HEXACO\nEmotionality's facets--Fear and Anxiety--also characterize FFM Neuroticism, but another\nEmotionality facet--Sentimentality--is associated with FFM Agreeableness. HEXACO\nEmotionality lacks the Angry Hostility facet included in FFM Neuroticism (see Costa and\nMcCrae, 1995)--instead, anger-related traits (temperamentalness and irritability)\ncharacterize the low pole of HEXACO Agreeableness, whereas its high pole includes\nForgiveness and Gentleness. Finally, Honesty-Humility includes the facets (the first two\nsubsumed under FFM Agreeableness) of Sincerity, Modesty, Fairness, and Greed\nAvoidance.\nThe distinctiveness of Honesty-Humility appears to be responsible for the HEXACO\nmodel's superiority to the FFM in predicting various forms of antagonistic and exploitative\nattitudes and behaviors (e.g., Lee and Ashton, 2005; Lee et al., 2013). Although less work\nhas explored the unique predictive power of Emotionality, it enables HEXACO to\noutperform the FFM in predicting phobic tendencies (Ashton, Lee, Visser, and Pozzebon,\nhas been interpreted in terms of evolved trade-offs, i.e., taking the view that along each\nHEXACO and life history strategy\ndimension, different trait levels entail different fitness costs and benefits (Ashton and Lee,\n2007; Ashton et al., 2014). HEXACO Extraversion, Conscientiousness, and Openness are\nregarded as endeavor-related traits, reflecting variable investment of time and effort in\nsocial, task-related, and idea-related activities, respectively. Honesty-Humility,\nAgreeableness, and Emotionality are thought to govern the conduct of cooperative\nrelationships, but in different ways. Honesty-Humility and Agreeableness are related to the\nmanagement of relationships of reciprocal altruism. People higher in Honesty-Humility are\nmore willing to forego opportunities to exploit others, whereas people higher in\nAgreeableness are more willing to tolerate occasional exploitation by others in\nrelationships that are mutually beneficial overall. The theoretically generated double\ndissociation between Honesty-Humility and Agreeableness has been supported by an\nexperimental study using economic games that tap variation in fairness and forgiveness\n(Hilbig, Zettler, Leist, and Heydasch, 2013).\nVariation in emotionality is proposed to govern both the receipt and the provision of\nkin altruism (Ashton and Lee, 2007; Ashton et al., 2014). In this view, Emotionality's\nSentimentality and Emotional Dependence facets tap variation in empathic concern and\ncapacity for emotional attachment, while its Fear and Anxiety facets tap variation in risk-\naversion as a means of safeguarding personal survival and, hence, the continued ability to\ninvest in close kin, particularly offspring. However, no published findings have linked\nvariation in emotionality to variation in the strength of kin ties. Testing this proposed link\nis one of the goals of the present study.\nThe HEXACO model's Emotionality-Agreeableness rotation is arguably more\nstrongly theoretically grounded than the FFM's Neuroticism-Agreeableness rotation, even\nthough they are equally valid psychometrically. FFM Neuroticism is glossed as heightened\nsusceptibility to negative emotions (Digman, 1990; McCrae and John, 1992). Although the\nnegative emotions may share a common phylogenetic ancestor in the basic emotion\napprehension (Nesse, 2004), in modern humans the negative emotions serve as adaptive\nresponses to a diverse set of challenges that have quite different antecedents, correlates, and\nconsequences. For example, displays of anger influence others to increase their relative\nregard for one's welfare, and anger-proneness is positively associated with traits (physical\nformidability and attractiveness) that enhance individuals' abilities to confer benefits and\nimpose costs on others (Sell, Tooby, and Cosmides, 2009). Anxiety serves the very\ndifferent function of motivating vigilance and avoidance in dangerous situations (Marks\nand Nesse, 1994), and HEXACO Emotionality is negatively associated with formidability\nand (self-perceived) attractiveness (Lukaszewski, 2013).\nTo summarize my argument to this point, (1) Life History Theory, a branch of\nevolutionary theory, has successfully predicted variation in FFM traits (Dunkel and Decker,\nbe a valid alternative to the FFM in predicting a wide variety of external criterion variables\n(Ashton et al., 2014); (3) the HEXACO dimensions have been plausibly interpreted in\nadaptive evolutionary terms, yet (4) no research has linked variation in the HEXACO\ndimensions to variation in LHS. If Life History Theory provides a uniquely powerful\norganizing principle for understanding human individual differences (Figueredo, Cabeza de\nBaca, and Woodley, 2013; Rushton and Irwing, 2011), then variation in LHS should\npredict variation in the HEXACO dimensions.\nHEXACO and life history strategy\nFor reasons described above, HEXACO Honesty-Humility, Extraversion,\nAgreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Openness should all be associated with a slower\nLHS. However, the expected relationship of Emotionality to LHS is less clear. Viewing its\nFear and Anxiety facets as indicative of low-level psychological functioning resulting from\nlow investment in somatic effort (Figueredo et al., 2007) leads to the prediction that,\nsimilarly to FFM Neuroticism, higher levels of Emotionality will be associated with a\nfaster LHS. However, if variation in Emotionality underpins variation in the propensity to\n(1) provide parental investment and (2) provide and receive kin altruism (Ashton and Lee,\n2001, 2007), then higher levels of Emotionality will be associated with a slower LHS,\nbecause high levels of kin altruism and parental investment are components of a slow LHS\nOverview of the present research\nHere I present the results of two studies, each using the same HEXACO instrument\nbut different measures of LHS. In both studies, I first examine correlations between LHS\nmeasures and the HEXACO dimensions. Second, I examine the relationships between the\nHEXACO factors and variation in the strength of kin ties, controlling for overall LHS. In\nStudy 1 (only), I also examine the relationships between the HEXACO factors and\nvariation in the strength of friendship ties, controlling for overall LHS. If Emotionality is\ndistinctly related to kin altruism, as argued by Ashton and Lee (2001, 2007), then (1) it will\nbe the HEXACO dimension most strongly related to LHS-residualized kin involvement and\n(2) it will be unrelated to LHS-residualized friendship involvement.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants and procedures\nI conducted a power analysis to estimate adequate sample size. Gladden et al.\n(2009) found correlations of .25\u00ad.55 between the FFM dimensions and an extracted factor\nrepresenting LHS based on the same instrument used in the present study. With a power\nlevel of .80 and an alpha of .05, a sample of 124 would be adequate to detect a correlation\nof .25. I conservatively chose a larger target sample size of 300, offering 335 opportunities\nfor participation to accommodate attrition.\nParticipants consisted of 335 anonymous U.S. residents recruited from Amazon's\nMechanical Turk (AMT) (see Buhrmester, Kwang, and Gosling, 2011). Each participant\nreceived $1.50 as compensation. The survey itself was administered through\nSurveyMonkey. To minimize bogus responses, I embedded two items with factually correct\nanswers within the instruments. Nineteen respondents gave incorrect answers to one or\nboth of these questions, and two other respondents declined to answer substantial numbers\nof items (8 and 13, respectively) within a single scale of one of the instruments. The\nHEXACO and life history strategy\nMeasures\nThe Arizona Life History Battery (ALHB: Figueredo, 2007) is a 199-item self-\nreport instrument consisting of eight scales drawn from various original sources (Barrera,\nthe scales measure distinct aspects of LHS. The 20-item Insight, Planning, and Control\n(IPC) scale (with a 7-point Likert response scale ranging from \"disagree strongly\" to \"agree\nstrongly\") includes items such as \"I am good at figuring out how things will turn out.\" The\n26-item Parent Relationship Quality scale (13 items for each biological parent) poses\nquestions such as \"How much time and attention did they give you when you needed it?\"\nand provides a 4-point response scale ranging from \"not at all\" to \"a lot.\" The Family\nContact/Support and Friends Contact/Support scales (15 items each, with the same 4-point\nresponse scale as the Parent Relationship Quality scale) include items such as \"During the\npast 12 months, about how many times have they come to your house?\" The 50-item\nGeneral Altruism scale (with a 7-point Likert response scale from \"disagree strongly\" to\n\"agree strongly\") includes subscales measuring altruism toward own children (example: \"I\nalways drop my plans when my children seem troubled\"), other genetic kin (example: \"I\nspend a great deal of time per month giving informal emotional support to my blood\nrelatives\"), friends (example: \"I would take a friend into my home if they could not afford\nto live alone\"), and the community (example: \"I frequently volunteer time or money to\nsocial causes that I support\"). The 17-item Religiosity scale (with a 7-point Likert response\nscale from \"disagree strongly\" to \"agree strongly\") includes items such as \"I frequently\nattend religious services.\" The 36-item Secure Attachment to Romantic Partners\n(Experiences in Close Relationships: ECR; Brennan et al., 1998) scale includes three\nsubscales, which respectively measure Secure, Anxious, and Avoidant Attachment (the\nlatter two subscales being reverse scored). Exemplary items from the three respective\nsubscales are \"I am very comfortable being close to romantic partners,\" \"I worry a lot about\nmy relationships,\" and \"I prefer not to show a partner how I feel deep down.\" Responses\nare given on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from \"strongly disagree\" to \"strongly agree.\"\nThe eighth ALHB scale, the Mini-K, contains 20 items tapping general features of all seven\nLHS facets.\nThe eight indicators converge on a single multivariate latent construct, the K-Factor\n(Gladden et al., 2009; Wenner, Bianchi, Figueredo, Rushton, and Jacobs, 2013), which can\nbe estimated as the mean of the z-scores of the seven scales excluding the Mini-K\n(Figueredo, 2007). Because 51.6% of the participants completed none of the eight items of\nthe Altruism toward Children subscale, and because there was very little variation among\nthose who did complete them, I deleted this subscale from analyses.\nThe HEXACO-60 (Ashton and Lee, 2009), a shorter version of the HEXACO\nPersonality Inventory--Revised (Ashton and Lee, 2008), comprises 10 items measuring\neach of the six HEXACO dimensions. Each facet of each dimension is covered by 2\u00ad3\nitems. The 5-point scale ranges from \"strongly disagree\" to \"strongly agree.\" The\nHEXACO-60 dimensions have been found to show adequate (1) scale reliability, (2)\ncorrelations of self-report with observer-report scores, and (3) theoretically expected\ncorrelations with FFM dimensions (Ashton and Lee, 2009).\nFor the Emotionality factor, which is of particular interest in the present study,\nexemplary items measuring each of its four facets are \"I would feel afraid if I had to travel\nin bad weather conditions\" (Fear), \"I sometimes can't help worrying about little things\"\nHEXACO and life history strategy\n(Anxiety), \"when I suffer from a painful experience, I need someone to make me feel\ncomfortable\" (Dependence) and \"I feel like crying when I see other people crying\"\n(Sentimentality).\nStatistical analyses\nresponses), I substituted the mean value for that item. Item responses were converted to z-\nscores before calculating scale scores and running correlations and regression analysis.\nALHB scales scores and HEXACO facet scores were calculated as the mean score across\nall items comprising that scale or facet. HEXACO factor scores were calculated as the\nmean score among that factor's four facets. Sex differences between correlation\ncoefficients were tested using Fisher's r-to-z transformation. Except where noted, no\nsignificant sex differences were found. All analyses were carried out using Stata 13.1. All\ntests of significance are two-tailed.\nResults\nDescriptive analyses\nThe ALHB scales were all positively correlated with each other (mean r = .26,\nrange = .09\u00ad.53). Family Contact/Support was significantly (p < .01) positively correlated\nwith every other ALHB scale except for ECR, r(314) = .08, p > .05. Table 1 shows\nCronbach's alphas (from unstandardized responses) and correlations between the ALHB\nscales and the HEXACO factors. HEXACO Extraversion (rs = .20 to .55), Agreeableness\n(rs = .17 to .40) and Conscientiousness (rs = .06 to .49) were positively correlated with\nmost or all of the ALHB scales, and were strongly positively correlated with the Mini-K\nand the overall K-Factor. Honesty-Humility was less strongly positively related to the\nALHB scales, while Openness was uncorrelated with the K-Factor and inconsistently\nrelated to the more specific scales. Emotionality was positively correlated with the Mini-K,\nFamily Contact/Support, General Altruism, and Religiosity, and was negatively correlated\nwith the ECR. Disaggregating the ECR into its three subscales revealed that Emotionality\nwas strongly positively correlated with Secure Attachment, r(314) = .21, p < .001, and\nmarginally negatively correlated with Avoidant Attachment, r(314) = .10, p = -.073\nwas strongly positively correlated with Anxious Attachment, r(314) = .40, p < .001. Table\n2 shows the correlations between the four Emotionality facets and the ALHB scales.\nDependence and Sentimentality were generally positively related to the ALHB scales,\nAnxiety was generally negatively related to them, and Fear was generally unrelated to\nthem.\nThe correlation between the mean of the ALHB scale scores and the mean of the\nExtraversion, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness scores was substantial, r(314) = .66,\np < .001, but not high enough to suggest that the ALHB adds nothing to the measurement\nof LHS beyond these personality dimensions.\nHEXACO and life history strategy\nTable 1.

Sex differences: Dependence and Contact and support from friends,\nHEXACO and life history strategy\nKin involvement independent of LHS variation\nTo examine whether HEXACO Emotionality uniquely predicts variation in the\nprovision and receipt of kin altruism, I first constructed a Synthetic Kin Involvement scale\nfrom relevant ALHB items. This scale included the 15 items of the Family Contact/Support\nScale and the 7 items of the Altruism toward Kin subscale. Cronbach's  for this 22-item\nscale was .93. I then regressed this Kin Involvement Scale on the remainder of the ALHB,\nspecifically on the mean of the Parent Relationship Quality, IPC, Friends Contact/Support,\nECR, Religiosity, and General Altruism (minus its seven Altruism toward Kin items)\ninvolvement with kin independent of variation in the remainder of the ALHB scales--i.e.,\nindependent of variation in LHS. A multiple regression analysis using the six HEXACO\ndimensions as independent variables revealed that both Emotionality and Agreeableness\npositively predicted LHS-residualized kin involvement (see Table 4 under the \"Study 1\"\ncolumn). Women scored higher on Emotionality than men (M \u00b1 SDwomen = .20 \u00b1 .58, M \u00b1\nmultivariate model did not qualitatively change the relationships between the HEXACO\ndimensions and LHS-residualized kin involvement. Furthermore, all four Emotionality\nfacets were significantly positively correlated with LHS-residualized kin involvement\nTable 3. Multiple regression analysis of relationships between HEXACO factors\n(independent variables) and LH-residualized kin involvement (dependent variable)\nIndependent variable\n(HEXACO factor) \u00b1SE p \u00b1SE p\nVariation in Emotionality might be related to a propensity for close social\nrelationships generally, rather than kin relationships specifically. To examine this\npossibility, I constructed an LH-residualized friendship involvement score using analytical\nmethods parallel to those used to construct the LHS-residualized kin involvement score\ndescribed above. First, I constructed a Friendship Involvement scale consisting of the 5\nFriends Contact items, the 10 Friends Support items, and the 14 Altruism toward Friends\nitems. This 29-item synthetic scale had a Cronbach's  of .94. I then regressed this scale on\nthe remainder of the ALHB, specifically on the mean of the Parent Relationship Quality,\nIPC, Kin Contact/Support, ECR, Religiosity, and General Altruism (minus its 14 Altruism\nHEXACO and life history strategy\nrepresent the degree of involvement with friends independent of variation in the remainder\nof the ALHB scales. A multiple regression analysis using the six HEXACO dimensions as\ninvolvement, whereas Emotionality was unrelated to LH-residualized friendship\nDiscussion\nThese results indicate that variation in LHS, as measured by the ALHB, only\naccounts for variation in some of the HEXACO dimensions. People pursuing a slower LHS\nwere more Extraverted, Agreeable, and Conscientious, and somewhat more Honest and\nHumble, than those pursuing a faster LHS. However, neither Emotionality nor Openness\nwas significantly associated with the K-factor extracted from the ALHB., These results\ncontrast with research showing that all five FFM factors vary with LHS (Dunkel and\nThe strongest positive relationship of Emotionality to an ALHB scale was with\nFamily Contact and Support, whereas its strongest negative relationship was with\nExperiences in Close Relationships. The latter finding appeared to be largely driven by the\nstrong positive correlation between Emotionality and Anxious Attachment. This is\nunsurprising in view of (1) widely demonstrated associations between FFM Neuroticism\nand Anxious Attachment (Noftle and Shaver, 2006) and (2) the content of Emotionality's\nDependence facet. These findings raise the possibility of a trade-off between the capacity to\nmaintain emotionally close kin ties (enhanced by higher Emotionality) and the capacity to\nmaintain secure attachments with romantic partners (diminished by higher Emotionality).\nFinally, a synthetic Kin Involvement scale, incorporating appropriate items from the\nFamily Contact/Support and Altruism scales, was positively related to Emotionality and to\nAgreeableness, but to no other HEXACO factors, after partialling out the effects of the\nremaining ALHB scales. Scores on all four Emotionality facets were positively correlated\nwith LHS-residualized kin involvement. In contrast, LHS-residualized friendship\ninvolvement was unrelated to Emotionality.\nA limitation of this study is that the ALHB is only one of several validated\nmeasures of LHS (Dunkel and Decker, 2010). Although the ALHB shows high internal\nreliability and external validity (reviewed by Figueredo et al., 2013), some questions may\nbe raised about the face validity of two of its scales. First, the romantic attachment style\nvariation measured by the ECR scale is related to, but is not isomorphic with, the mating\neffort vs. parenting effort trade-off as conceptualized by Life History Theory. Second, only\na minority of the 20 items in the Insight, Planning, and Control scale pertain directly to\nvariation in future discounting, another key element in the suite of LHS-relevant\npsychological traits. Another weakness of the ALHB is its lack of reverse-keyed items in\nall scales except the ECR, raising the possibility of acquiescent response bias (Ray, 1983).\nTo address these concerns, I conducted a second study using instruments that directly\nmeasure interest in short-term mating (Jackson and Kirkpatrick, 2007) and future time\nperspective (Zimbardo and Boyd, 1999), and that contain reverse-keyed items.\nHEXACO and life history strategy\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants and procedures\nParticipants consisted of 356 anonymous USA residents recruited from AMT. Each\nparticipant received $1.40 as compensation. I used SurveyMonkey's IP address blocking\nfeature, along with a warning in the description of the AMT task, to prevent Study 1\nparticipants from participating in Study 2. Seven participants failed to complete the survey,\nand 22 gave incorrect answers to one or both of the embedded liar-detector items. The\nMeasures\nAs in Study 1, participants were presented with the HEXACO-60 (Ashton and Lee,\n2009). They also completed the Synthetic Kin Involvement Scale from the ALHB\n(Figueredo, 2007), which is described in the Results section of Study 1.\nThe remaining three instruments have been shown by Dunkel and Decker (2010) to\nadequately measure particular aspects of LHS variation. The Short-Term Mating\nOrientation Scale (STMO: Jackson and Kirkpatrick, 2007) consists of 10 items (with\naccompanying 7-point Likert response scale from \"strongly disagree\" to \"strongly agree\")\nthat measure interest in short-term mating. Items include \"I could easily imagine myself\nenjoying one night of sex with someone I would never see again.\" Scores on this scale are\nreversed to enable calculation of a mean z-score across the three LHS instruments.\nThe Future Time Perspective (FTP) subscale of the Zimbardo Time Perspective\nInventory (ZTPI: Zimbardo and Boyd, 1999) contains 13 items measuring the degree to\nwhich future goals direct current behavior. For each item, respondents are asked \"How\ncharacteristic or true is this of you?\" and are provided with a 5-point Likert response scale\nanchored by \"very uncharacteristic\" and \"very characteristic.\" Items include \"It upsets me\nto be late for appointments.\"\nThe Expected Lifespan item (Dunkel and Decker, 2010) is a single question: \"If you\nhad to guess, at what age do you think you will die?\" Answers were recorded in years.\nStatistical analyses\nStatistical procedures in Study 2 were identical to those in Study 1.\nResults\nDescriptive analyses\nFTP and (reversed) STMO were significantly positively correlated, r(327) = .19, p\n< .001, and FTP and estimated age at death were significantly positively correlated, r(327)\n= .17, p < .01) but (reversed) STMO and estimated age at death were uncorrelated, r(327) =\n.09, p > .05. Table 5 shows Cronbach's alphas (from unstandardized responses) and\ncorrelations between the three LHS measures and the HEXACO factors, as well as\ncorrelations between the HEXACO Emotionality facets and the three LHS measures.\nHEXACO Agreeableness and Conscientiousness were correlated as predicted with all three\nHEXACO and life history strategy\nLHS measures, Extraversion was positively correlated with FTP and Estimated Age at\nDeath, Honesty-Humility was correlated as predicted with STMO and FTP, and\nEmotionality was positively correlated with (reversed) STMO.

Among the Emotionality facets, only Fear\nand Sentimentality were associated with more than one of the three LHS indicators: Both\nwere positively correlated with FTP and (reversed) STMO.\nTable 4.

The relations of the HEXACO\ndimensions to the LHS indicators were broadly similar to the results of Study 1.\nExtraversion, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness were strongly positively associated\nwith a slower LHS. So was Honesty-Humility, unlike in Study 1. Emotionality was weakly\nbut significantly associated with a slower LHS, whereas Openness was unrelated to LHS.\nCompared to Study 1, Extraversion was much less strongly associated, and\nConscientiousness somewhat more strongly associated, with LHS. This is unsurprising\nconsidering the different areas of emphasis in the LHS measures used in the two studies.\nThe ALHB is tilted toward Extraversion-related content: the Friends Contact and Support,\nFamily Contact and Support, and Altruism scales partly tap variation in the enjoyment of\nsocial situations, and the IPC scale partly taps a propensity toward positive affect. Gladden\net al. (2009) found that FFM Extraversion was the personality dimension most strongly\ncorrelated with the ALHB-derived K-factor. In contrast, among the Study 2 LHS\ninstruments, the FTP is saturated with Conscientiousness-related content, whereas,\nconsistent with the findings of Bourdage, Lee, Ashton, and Perry (2007), there was no\ncorrelation between the STMO and Extraversion. Interestingly, Conscientiousness is the\nFFM personality trait most closely linked to actual longevity (Friedman, Kern, Hampson,\nand Duckworth, 2014), a variable with strong face validity as an LHS indicator.\nAs in Study 1, Emotionality predicted variation in LHS-residualized kin\ninvolvement. However, in contrast to Study 1, Extraversion also predicted variation in\nLHS-residualized kin involvement, whereas Agreeableness did not. This difference may\nalso be partly attributable to the different emphases in the LHS measures used in the two\nstudies. People who enjoy social activity generally are also, all else being equal, more\nlikely to enjoy socializing with kin. Unlike in Study 1, which used an LHS instrument that\nabsorbed most of the variance in Extraversion, the Study 2 LHS factor excluded a\nconsiderable portion of Extraversion variance, leaving it available to be associated with the\nLHS-residualized kin involvement measure.\nHEXACO and life history strategy\nGeneral Discussion\nThis research has addressed two questions. First, how are the HEXACO personality\ndimensions related to variation in Life History Strategy? Second, does HEXACO\nEmotionality predict closeness of kin ties, as predicted by Ashton and colleagues (Ashton\nTwo studies, using different measures of LHS, produced roughly similar results.\nPeople pursuing a slower LHS were found to be consistently more extraverted, agreeable,\nconscientious, and honest and humble than people pursuing a faster LHS. Openness was\nconsistently unrelated to LHS. Emotionality was unrelated to LHS as measured by the\nALHB, and weakly positively related to LHS as measured by the STMO, FTP, and\nEstimated Age at Death (though the two correlation coefficients do not differ significantly).\nThe relationships among LHS, extraversion, and mating orientation are somewhat\nunclear in the existing literature. Variation in extraversion is partly explained by variation\nin physical attractiveness and physical formidability (Lukaszewksi and Roney, 2011),\nwhich in turn reflect better phenotypic condition (see also Gangestad and Simpson, 2000).\nThese associations seem consistent with the view (Figueredo et al., 2007) that extraversion\nforms part of a slow LHS. However, the picture is complicated by theory and data showing\nthat extraversion (Nettle, 2005; but see Bourdage et al., 2007, and the present study) and\nmale physical strength and attractiveness (Lukaszewski, Larson, Gildersleeve, Roney, and\nHaselton, 2014) are associated with uncommitted mating orientation, which is thought to\nform part of a fast LHS. A possible solution to this conundrum is Lukaszeski et al.'s (2014)\nfinding that committed mating orientation, which is unrelated (or weakly inversely related\n\u00ad Jackson and Kirkpatrick, 2007) to uncommitted mating orientation, is not predicted by\nphysical strength or attractiveness. Lukaszeski et al. (2014) speculate that variation in\ncommitted mating orientation, but not variation in uncommitted mating orientation, is\ndriven by variation in LHS. In other words, it is likely that people following a slow LHS\ntypically maintain long-term mating relationships, but (particularly if they are attractive\nand, if male, formidable) may also pursue opportunities for short-term mating relationships.\nA limitation of the present study is that it did not include the Long-Term Mating\nOrientation scale of Jackson and Kirkpatrick's (2007) multi-dimensional instrument.\nThe slight differences between FFM Openness as measured by the NEO-PI (Costa\nand McCrae, 1995) and HEXACO Openness as measured by the HEXACO-60 (Ashton\nand Lee, 2009) (e.g., HEXACO Openness lacks a Feelings facet) seem inadequate to\naccount for the difference between the results of this study and the results of other studies\nFFM Openness is associated with a slower LHS. However, both theoretical and empirical\nconsiderations should lead to renewed debate about the relationship between openness and\nLHS. For example, in societies that enforce restrictions on consensual non-marital sex, and\non purportedly related practices such as recreational drug use, openness to unconventional\nideas about these topics may be linked to a faster LHS (Kurzban, Dukes, and Weeden,\n2010). People who are more scientifically and artistically creative tend to be more arrogant,\npretentious and disagreeable than less creative people (Feist, 1998). Future research should\nseek to separate the relationships of the various openness facets to LHS, and to examine\nwhether any of them are curvilinearly related to LHS, such that people of intermediate\nopenness pursue the slowest LHS.\nHEXACO and life history strategy\nEmotionality was not consistently related to LHS. One interpretation of this finding\nis that it exposes a weakness of the HEXACO model rather than a weakness of LHS-based\npersonality theory. In this view, Emotionality unjustifiably combines facets reflecting low-\nlevel psychological functioning (Anxiety and Fear) and hence a fast LHS (Figueredo et al.,\n2007) with facets reflecting the capacity for close, mutually supportive social relationships\n(Dependence and Sentimentality), consistent with a slow LHS (Ashton and Lee, 2007;\nAshton et al., 2014). This interpretation generates the prediction that both Anxiety and Fear\nwill be associated with a faster LHS. But in fact, in Study 1, the Fear facet was uncorrelated\nwith the K-factor, whereas in Study 2, the Fear facet was significantly positively correlated\nwith FTP and strongly significantly positively correlated with (reversed) STMO.\nMoreover, other research has demonstrated Emotionality's psychometric and theoretical\ncoherence (Ashton and Lee, 2007) and its superior utility to FFM scales in predicting\nrelevant external criterion variables (Ashton et al., 2008; McKay and Tokar, 2012).\nAn alternative interpretation, tentatively supported by the findings reported here, is\nthat HEXACO Emotionality forms one part of an evolutionarily important dimension of\npersonality variation that is orthogonal to LHS. Some of the variation in the strength of kin\nsocial relationships reflects LHS variation, as shown here by ALHB Family\nContact/Support's strong inter-correlations with all but one (the ECR) of the other ALHB\nscales (see also Figueredo et al., 2007; Gladden et al., 2009). In the present study, Family\nContact/Support was strongly positively correlated with Extraversion and Agreeableness.\nPeople who enjoy social activity and who are more willing to tolerate occasional\nexploitation are likelier to maintain closer kin ties, compared to more introverted and\nunforgiving people, but these propensities are not specific to kin--they apply to unrelated\nsocial partners as well. But another portion of the variation in the strength of kin social\nrelationships is attributable to variation in Emotionality, as predicted by Ashton and Lee\n(2001, 2007). Isolating this portion of the variation in kin involvement, by holding LHS\nconstant, reveals that it is positively correlated with three of the four Emotionality facets\n(Study 2) or all four (Study 1). Furthermore, across the two studies, Emotionality was the\nonly HEXACO dimension consistently related to LHS-residualized kin involvement.\nResearch has revealed a large body of diverse findings supporting the utility of Life\nHistory Theory for explaining the covariation of human personality, social and health-\nrelated traits (Figueredo et al., 2013). However, it is becoming apparent that some\nevolutionarily significant personality variation is orthogonal to LHS-linked variation\n(Gladden et al., 2009; Wenner et al., 2013). The results of the present study should be\ninterpreted in this framework.\nThis study has several limitations. Neither of the LHS instruments measured\nprimary Life History variables (e.g., birth spacing, age at first reproduction). Only self-\nreport data were collected. Self-report and observer report (i.e., by a person who knows the\ntarget well) have complementary strengths and biases (Ashton and Lee, 2010). Using the\nshorter HEXACO-60 (Ashton and Lee, 2009) reduces confidence in the facet scores, each\nof which is based on only 2\u00ad3 items. Participants consisted exclusively of U.S. residents.\nHuman personality structure varies across the literate populations that have been studied\nusing the lexical method (Ashton and Lee, 2001). A recent study (Gurven, von Rueden,\nMassenkoff, and Kaplan, 2013) indicates that even greater variation emerges when non-\nliterate small-scale societies are also considered. However, poor self- and other-report\nHEXACO and life history strategy\nagreement in a similar study (Bailey et al., 2013) suggests caution regarding the use of self-\nreport rating scales in populations unfamiliar with them.\nharm avoidance with kin altruism is plausible in state-level societies, it may be less\napplicable to non-state societies in which a key form of kin altruism is the willingness to\nengage in high-risk violent confrontations on behalf of relatives (e.g., Chagnon and Bugos,\n1979). A helpful refinement of the evolutionary significance of high emotionality is that,\nrather than facilitating kin altruism generally, it motivates people to limit potential harm to\nthemselves and their close kin. Which particular forms of kin altruism occur will also\ndepend on the actor's other personality traits as well as the situation.\nA final, general concern is that social desirability bias may distort ALHB responses\n(Figueredo et al., 2005) and possibly other LHS measures, because the traits associated\nwith a slow LHS are valued in contemporary Western societies. As a complementary\nmethod to self-report instruments, researchers may wish to measure core LHS traits using\nchoice tasks with real monetary stakes, e.g., future discounting tasks (Wilson and Daly,\n2004), economic games that tap altruism or trust (Camerer, 2003), and gambling games\n(e.g., Suhr and Tsanadis, 2007). For measuring traits related to the mating/parenting trade-\noff, techniques such as eye-tracking tasks (e.g., C\u00e1rdenas, Harris and Becker, 2013) can\ncircumvent social desirability bias. Another promising approach is to measure naturally\noccurring LHS-related behavior patterns using methods such as intermittent audio sampling\nof daily life (Mehl and Pennebaker, 2003).\n"
