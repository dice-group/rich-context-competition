    "abstract": "Abstract\nParental aggression, that is, offspring protection aggression, can be viewed as a type of parental investment. Most mammalian\nmales do not exhibit parental investment and therefore exhibit little, if any, parental aggression. Men demonstrate parental\ninvestment, and are typically more physically aggressive than women, but parental physical aggression in humans has been largely\nunexplored. The current study examined potential sex differences in estimates of parental physical aggression involving hypo-\nthetical situations, while controlling for general physical aggression. A self-report measure was administered to 217 students from\na western U.S. university (55 male nonparents, 50 female nonparents, 54 fathers, and 58 mothers). Male nonparents reported\nhigher parental physical aggression than female nonparents, but there was no difference between mothers and fathers. The results\nare interpreted in light of ancestral effects of sexual selection and proximal effects of sex differences in testosterone, risk taking,\nand fear aversion.\n",

Steiner1\n Keywords\naggression, maternal aggression, paternal aggression, parental investment, sex difference\nThe literature on human parental aggression often refers to\naggression by a parent that harms offspring (e.g., Voisin, Hot-\nton, & Schneider, 2014). Conversely, the literature on nonhu-\nman parental aggression often refers to aggression by a parent\nthat protects offspring, (e.g., Trainor, Finy, & Nelson, 2008).\nThe present study examined the latter form of aggression, that\nis, offspring protection aggression, but with respect to humans.\nThe present study also used a common definition of aggression:\nthe intention to cause harm to another individual (Archer,\n2009). Parental aggression can be directed toward another\nhuman, that is, a spouse, stranger, adolescent, and so on, or a\nnonhuman animal such as a dog that is threatening the parent's\nchild. Thus, theoretically humans can display parental aggres-\nsion toward conspecifics and nonconspecifics, as is observed\nParental aggression in humans is relatively unexplored. As\nsuch, a brief background on parental aggression among nonhu-\nman animals is provided and then several human sex differ-\nences are discussed as they may pertain to human parental\naggression. Parental aggression is perhaps best understood as\na form of parental investment. The latter is defined as `` . . . any\ninvestment in an individual offspring that increases the off-\nspring's chance of surviving (and hence reproductive success)\nat the cost of the parent's ability to invest in other offspring''\nany biological or behavioral expenditure by a parent that pro-\nmotes the welfare of a child and ultimately that child's own\nreproductive success. Examples of parental investment include\neverything from gestation to ensuring that one's child wears a\nseatbelt in a car to parental aggression. Parental aggression can\nbe carried out by males (paternal aggression) or females\n(maternal aggression).\nA few examples that portray the range of species that engage\nin maternal aggression include the red swamp crayfish (Pro-\ncambarus clarkii; Figler, Twum, Finkelstein, & Peeke, 1995),\n1 Department of Psychology, National University, La Jolla, CA, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nEric T.

This range demon-\nstrates that maternal aggression is a well-preserved phenom-\nenon across numerous taxa. Furthermore, the preservation of\nmaternal aggression as an adaption in various species serves to\nhinder infanticide and predation, which are two principle\nthreats to offspring (Archer, 1988). In some species, such as\nthe chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), infanticide has been led by\nmales (e.g., Watts & Mitani, 2000) as well as females (e.g.,\nTownsend, Slocombe, Thompson, & Zuberbu\ndetailed discussions on the biology and behavior of maternal\naggression, the reader is guided to more comprehensive sources\nHere it is added that humans are among the species that engage\nin maternal aggression, and this topic is receiving increased\nattention in the literature (e.g., Hahn-Holbrook, Holt-Lunstad,\nIf parental aggression is viewed as a form of parental invest-\nment, and given that males in over 95% of mammalian species\nprovide little or no parental investment (Clutton-Brock, 1989,\nClutton-Brock & Scott, 1991), then it may not be surprising\nthat paternal aggression is less common than maternal aggres-\nsion. But though the former is less common, it is still a widely\nobserved phenomenon in the animal kingdom. Specific exam-\nples include a species of fish such as the smallmouth bass\n(Micropterus dolomieu; Hanson, O'Connor, Van Der Kraak,\n& Cooke, 2009), the dwarf hamster (Phodopus campbelli;\nReburn & Wynne-Edwards, 1999), the Canada goose (Branta\ncanadensis; Sedinger & Raveling, 1990), and the wild baboon\n(Papio cynocephalus; Nguyen, Van Horn, Alberts, & Altmann,\n2009). Interestingly, our closest ancestors, chimpanzees and\nbonobos (Pan paniscus), do not demonstrate paternal invest-\nment (Geary, 2000), and therefore presumably no paternal\naggression. Humans are among the exceptions in mammals\nwith a significant and geographically widespread history of\nSex differences within a species, such as parental invest-\nment, are often explained by sexual selection: the process by\nwhich sex-specific heritable traits get passed on to future gen-\nerations, mostly by intrasexual competition and intersexual\nchoice (Darwin, 1871). Sex differences are explained in a\nrelated manner by the idea that the reproductive success of\nmales is often limited by access to mates whereas reproductive\nsuccess of females is often limited by access to resources such\nas food (Bateman, 1948), and these sex-different challenges\nlead to sex-different adaptations. One explanation for what\ndrives sexual selection is the difference in minimum parental\ninvestment between males and females (Trivers, 1972). That is,\nthe sex (usually the female) that is obligated to higher mini-\nmum parental investment increased reproductive success by\nbeing selective in choosing a mate, that is, demonstrating\nintersexual choice, and this in turn drove intrasexual competi-\ntion in the other sex (usually the male; Trivers, 1972). In terms\nof parental aggression, the higher minimum parental invest-\nment by women, for example, in gestation and lactation, moti-\nvates behavior to protect that investment, and an example of\nsuch a behavior is maternal aggression. Considerable data have\nsupported the theory of sexual selection (Andersson, 1994;\nGeary, 2010) and that sex differences are often linked with one\nanother, for example, the sex difference in testosterone is\nlinked with the sex difference in aggression (Archer, 2006).\nTherefore, understanding potential sex differences in parental\naggression may be aided by examining sex differences in other\nforms of aggression.\nAmong nonhuman animals, parental aggression tends to be\nphysical and direct, and therefore likely has relevance to\nhumans. Physical aggression and direct aggression are not\nmutually exclusive constructs, but they are also not the same.\nFor instance, punching someone is direct, physical aggression.\nCovertly pouring hot sauce on food believed to be eaten by\nsomeone who is allergic to hot sauce is an example of indirect,\nphysical aggression. A meta-analysis of gender differences in\naggression in real-world settings revealed that men are on aver-\nage more physically aggressive than women (Archer, 2004).\nAlso, meta-analyses showed that men are more physically\naggressive than women in various lab settings (Bettencourt &\nmen engage in more direct aggression than women (Campbell,\n2006), and a meta-analysis of childhood and adolescent aggres-\nsion reveals that this gender difference exists long before adult-\nhood (Card, Stucky, Sawalani, & Little, 2008).\nAt a proximate level, many sex differences can be linked to\ntestosterone. Men's higher testosterone has been linked with\nphysical aggression (e.g., Archer, 2006), risk taking (e.g.,\nMehta, Welker, Zilioli, & Carr\u00b4\nresponse (e.g., Hermans, Putman, Baas, Koppeschaar, & van\nHonk, 2006). Men are more physically aggressive as noted\nearlier and also engage in more risky behavior (Byrnes, Miller,\n& Schafer, 1999), and there is evidence that men's lower fear\naversion largely accounts for the sex difference in direct\naggression (Campbell, 2006). Moreover, a parent's intent to\ncause harm to someone who is threatening the parent's child\ninvolves some measure of risk taking and, possibly, temporar-\nily lowered fear aversion.\nTo be sure, parental protection often comes in nonphysical\nand nonaggressive forms. As examples, a parent can supervise\nhis or her child swimming, monitor the child's access to busy\nstreets, restrict the child's use of dangerous objects or toys that\ncould be swallowed, and so on. Indeed, the National Center for\nHealth Statistics (2015) reported that the top three causes of\ndeath among children 1\u00ad4 years of age in the United States in\nthreats to children may very well elicit a physically aggressive\nprotective response by a parent. One example is if a parent\nwitnesses the kidnapping of his or her child by the other parent.\n2 Evolutionary Psychology\nworldwide.\nTo reiterate, maternal/paternal aggression is a type of\nmaternal/paternal investment. Humans demonstrate both\nmaternal and paternal investment. Women demonstrate\nhigher parental investment both at the minimum biological\nlevel (e.g., gestation and lactation) and in terms of perform-\nhigher levels of testosterone, risky behavior, and general\nphysical aggression. In addition, men's higher physical\naggression can be used for a variety of survival or repro-\nductive ends (Buss, 2009), such as offspring protection.\nThat said, little is known about potential sex differences\nin parental physical aggression and whether precursors to\nsuch sex differences exist among nonparents. The current\nstudy tested two hypotheses: (1) Male nonparents who are\nasked to imagine having a child, and that child being threat-\nened, will report higher parental physical aggression than\nfemale nonparents. (2) Fathers who are asked to imagine\nthat their child is being threatened will report higher par-\nental physical aggression than mothers.\nMethod\nParticipants\nviduals who participated in the study. Ages ranged from 18 to\nHispanic/Hispanic American, 26 (12%) were Black/African\nmixed ethnicity, 7 (3%) were undisclosed, 2 (1%) were Native\nAmerican, and 2 (1%) were Pacific Islander. Highest level of\neducation completed was as follows: 84 high school, 59 some\ncollege, 61 associate's or undergraduate degree, 10 graduate\ndegree, and 3 undisclosed.\nMeasures\nThe study included a survey with five demographic items for\nage, gender, ethnicity, highest level of education completed,\nand parental status. The latter item provided participants with\nthe option to select one or more of the following: childless,\nbiological parent, stepparent, and other.\nThe remaining items measured aggression using a Likert-\ntype scale. The first 9 items were obtained from a validated\nmeasure of (general) physical aggression (Buss & Perry, 1992).\nThe authors reported a Cronbach's a (internal consistency) of\n.85 for these 9 items. Item 7 was reversed scored. The remain-\ning 3 items were developed to measure estimates of parental\nphysical aggression involving hypothetical situations of an\nincreasing level of threat to a parent's child from verbal to\nphysical to potentially lethal. The 12 aggression items are\nlocated in the Appendix.\nProcedure\nAll procedures were approved by the institutional review board\nwhere this study was conducted, and informed consent was\nobtained before data collection commenced. Participants were\nrecruited from various undergraduate psychology classes from\na university located in the western United States.\nThe few participants who were neither childless nor biolo-\ngical parents (i.e., parents of stepchildren, adopted children,\nfoster children, etc.) were excluded from analyses to be able\nmake a clear a distinction between ``nonparent'' and ``parent.''\nFor instance, if a childless man who recently entered a new\nrelationship and considered himself to be a stepparent to his\npartner's child, this individual may have reduced group differ-\nences in the current study had he been included.\nStatistical Analysis\nAn independent-samples t-test was conducted to determine if\nparents reported higher parental physical aggression scores\nthan did nonparents. Higher scores among parents were\nexpected, given that they responded to hypothetical scenarios\ninvolving their actual children whereas nonparents responded\nto the same scenarios involving hypothetical children.\nSubsequent analyses for nonparents and parents were kept\nseparate because instructions for the parental physical aggres-\nsion items were slightly different for these two groups. That\nis, nonparents were asked to imagine having a child, and that\nchild being threatened, whereas parents were asked to imag-\nine their actual child being threatened. This point is worth\nelaboration. For a fair comparison between a nonparent and a\nparent, both would have to be asked the same questions, that\nis, both asked to imagine a hypothetical child of theirs being\nthreatened. And in such a scenario, parents would have to be\nadditionally asked to not picture their actual child being\nthreatened. Hence, two 1-way analyses of covariance\n(ANCOVAs) were used to examine differences in parental\nphysical aggression while controlling for general physical\naggression between male nonparents (n \u00bc 55) and female\nnonparents (n \u00bc 50), and between fathers (n \u00bc 54) and\nResults\nAnalysis of internal consistency for Items 1\u00ad9 (general physi-\ncal aggression) revealed a Cronbach's a of .82. For Items 10\u00ad\n12 (parental physical aggression), Cronbach's a was .69, and\nwas maximized by not removing any of the 3 items. Values\nover .70 are generally considered satisfactory (Nunnally,\nThe data for general physical aggression and parental phys-\nical aggression were not normally distributed as shown by\nKolmogorov-Smirnov statistics, ps < .05. ANCOVAs were still\nused because they are robust to violation of this assumption and\nbecause of the relatively large sample in the study.\nFurthermore, skewness and kurtosis values for both types of\naggression were between \u00c01 and \u00fe1.\nThere was a significant difference in general physical\n6.39).

This result is consis-\ntent with the broader finding that men's higher aggression is an\nadaptation best explained by sexual selection (Archer, 2009).\nFurthermore, it is an adaptation that can be utilized in different\nways to overcome different survival/reproductive challenges\n(Buss, 2009), for example, protecting offspring by way of par-\nental physical aggression. One can speculate whether the latter\nwas adaptive in its own right, that is, whether paternal physical\naggression provided an increase in the survival of offspring to\nthe extent that a heritable trait for paternal physical aggression\nwas ``selected'' by sexual selection pressures. Although\nhumans have a long history of paternal investment (Gray &\nAnderson, 2010), it is unclear how much of a role paternal\nphysical aggression played in that investment.\nObviously, women also have an ancestral past of parental\ninvestment, so why were female nonparents' scores not equally\nhigh as male nonparents' scores? Several reasons could\naccount for this and the reader is reminded that parental invest-\nment comes in many forms. Offspring protection is simply one\nform. Females have many ways to engage in parental invest-\nment and many ways to engage in offspring protection that do\nnot include parental physical aggression. From a proximate\nperspective, men's higher testosterone, lower fear aversion,\nand greater risk taking are offered as reasons for the sex dif-\nference observed in this study.\nA meta-analysis of risk-taking behavior reveals that men are\nmore likely to engage in a variety of risky behaviors including\ngambling, dangerous driving, unprotected sex, and so on\n(Byrnes et al., 1999). Another line of evidence to support the\nidea that men demonstrate a greater willingness to engage in\nrisky behavior can be obtained from data from the Carnegie\nHero Fund, which ``awards the Carnegie Medal to individuals\nin the United States and Canada who risk their lives to an\nextraordinary degree saving or attempting to save the lives of\nothers.'' An analysis reveals that over 90% of the 7,000\u00fe reci-\npients over the last several decades have been men (Kenrick,\nNeuberg, & Cialdini, 2010). But perhaps the most salient\nexample of men's greater willingness to engage in risky beha-\nvior with the most direct link to physical aggression is that men\nare far more likely to commit homicide. Statistics from the\nDepartment of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation Crime\nReports reveal that over 85% of homicides in the United States\nin the last 50 years were committed by men (Kenrick et al.,\nThe second hypothesis, that fathers would report higher\nestimates of parental physical aggression than mothers, was\nnot supported by the results. The results revealed no signif-\nicant difference between the two groups. In addition, the\nscores were relatively high for both mothers and fathers (as\nthey were for male nonparents). This outcome is interpreted\nin light of women's higher minimum parental investment,\nwhich drives sexual selection (Trivers, 1972) and the motiva-\ntion to protect that investment. Also, adaptations related to\nhigher minimum parental investment may not get activated\nuntil the actual onset of parenthood. Mothers' high parental\nphysical aggression scores are consistent with the majority of\nfemale mammals that demonstrate maternal aggression.\nMoreover, when faced with a situation in which the well-\nbeing of a mother's child is threatened, fear aversion may\nbe reduced or overridden by the desire to protect one's child.\nTo reiterate from earlier, most of the sex difference in direct\naggression can be explained by women's higher fear aversion\n(Campbell, 2006). One final thought regarding the lack of a\ndifference between mothers' and fathers' scores concerns a\nstudy that reported fathers' help with child care had little\neffect on child survival rates in a variety of human popula-\ntions (Sear & Mace, 2008). If paternal investment in its var-\nious forms from child care to parental aggression is less\ncritical for offspring survival, then one might indeed expect\na high level of maternal physical aggression.\nRegarding parents and nonparents, it may be of interest to\nspeculate on the difference between these two groups. Parental\nphysical aggression scores were relatively equally high\nbetween fathers and male nonparents. However, mothers\nreported higher scores than female nonparents. Similarly,\nwhen asked ``How much would you physically harm an adult\nwho is kidnapping your child?'' the maximum score of 7 was\nreported by 76% of mothers versus 58% of female nonparents,\nand 70% of fathers versus 67% of male nonparents. Taken\ntogether, the sex difference in estimates of parental physical\naggression may disappear with the experience of parenthood.\nAn example of such an experience is lactation; one study\nreported that breast-feeding mothers demonstrated higher\naggression than formula-feeding mothers and childless\nThe results raise questions. One question is how the sex of a\nchild could influence the results of this study. Both mothers and\nfathers interact differently with sons versus daughters before 2\nor even 1 year of age (e.g., Jacklin, DiPietro, & Maccoby, 1984;\nSnow, Jacklin, & Maccoby, 1983). However, differences in\nhow sons are treated versus daughters with nurturing behaviors\nsuch as play may not have a correlation with protective beha-\nviors such as parental physical aggression. Another question is\nhow the age of a child could influence the results of this study.\nIf maternal aggression among nonhuman animals eventually\ndecreases as offspring grow and gain independence, it may\nbe the case that younger children may elicit higher parental\nphysical aggression than older children.\nThe study had limitations. First, the self-report measures\nmay not accurately reflect what participants would do in a\nreal-world setting. For example, as stated earlier, many parti-\ncipants selected the maximum score for the last item in the\nsurvey, that is, reporting that they would use enough physical\nharm to kill an adult who was kidnapping their child. This may\nreflect a ceiling effect or it may represent the maximum amount\nof aggression that could be expressed. That is, arguably, there is\nlittle aggression that could be expressed beyond killing some-\none. Alternatively, it is possible that these scores may exagge-\nrate actual parental physical aggression. Second, this study's\nassessment of parental physical aggression was limited to 3\nitems. More items would produce more information about a\nwider range of threats to a parent's child, and more information\nabout participants' potential nonphysical aggression responses.\nIdentifying the sex of the target (the one who is threatening a\nchild) could also provide useful information, given that both\nsexes are more aggressive toward men (Davidovic, Bell,\nFuture studies could address these limitations and examine\nthe role of testosterone in parental physical aggression. Testos-\nterone has positive correlations with aggression (Archer, 2006)\nand negative correlations with parenting contexts (Gray &\nAnderson, 2010). Also, fathers tend to have lower baseline\ntestosterone than male nonfathers (e.g., Gray, Yang, & Pope,\n2006). Little research has been done to compare baseline testos-\nterone levels between mothers and female nonparents, but a cou-\nple of studies suggest the pattern is the same as for males, that is,\nmothers have lower testosterone than female nonparents (e.g.,\nIn closing, parental investment comes in various forms from\nchanging a diaper to helping a child with homework to off-\nspring protection. The latter also comes in various forms from\nmonitoring a child's meals for allergens to insisting a child\nwear a helmet for bicycling to parental physical aggression.\nThe latter yet again comes in various forms. Understanding\nthis hierarchical relationship among parental physical aggres-\nsion, offspring protection, and parental investment, as well as\nunderstanding the associated sex differences can help refine\nour understanding of the broader literature on aggression.\nNumerous studies have demonstrated men's higher physical\naggression. Few contexts may be able to demonstrate higher\nor even equal levels of physical aggression in women compared\nto men, and maternal aggression may be one such context.\nAppendix\nPlease rate the following items on a scale of 1 (extremely\nuncharacteristic of me) to 5 (extremely characteristic of me).\n1.
