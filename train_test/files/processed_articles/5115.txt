The spatial dimension of residential density in the city generates three unique\nresidential patterns which are low residential density (LRD), medium residential density (MRD), and high residential density\n(HRD) areas. Descriptive and multivariate inferential statistics were used to render explanations for the spatial variations\nin the residential quality variables in the study area. Findings indicated that a clear difference exists in the residential quality\nwithin the three residential density areas of Lagos. High correlations exist among the residential quality indicators and\nhousing type. The principal component analysis shows that residential polarizations that occur in the LRD, MRD, and HRD\nare based on the location, dwelling facility, interior and exterior quality, neighborhood integrity, social bond, barrier to entry,\nand security. The practical implications of residential polarizations along the residential density areas are explicitly expressed.\n",

Urban polarization is a common\nresearch problem to all social scientists although geogra-\nphers are keener about spatial polarization of human activi-\nties including housing than other social scientists. While the\nsociologists attempt to view residential differentiation as\nresulting from the tendency for racial segregation (Krivo,\n1986), the economists tend to look at residential differentia-\ntion as an outcome of choice behaviors resulting from the\nSociological and economic explanations of residential dif-\nferentiation are fraught with serious problems (Harvey,\n1975). First, sociological explanation does not provide\ninsight beyond emphasizing the rather simplistic notion that\npeople of the same racial provenance live closely together,\nand second, the neo-classical economic theory of utility\nmaximization which emphasizes differentiation based on\nconsumer behavior does not explain the spatial pattern of\nhuman activities sufficiently.\nHowever, the geographic view of residential polarization\nassumes that the spatial aspect of housing quality imposes on\nthe cityscape a peculiar pattern which influences choices\nuses, housing perhaps gives the city its most glaring image\nand form and this is partly because housing constitutes the\nlargest land use and partly because housing is a complex\nphysical stock. In developing economies, urban housing\nmarkets are often characterized by both quantity and quality\nvariations which make home decision making quite prob-\n2000). Generally, in terms of quantity, price, and quality, the\nhousing market is never a monolithic structure, but a set of\nsubmarkets that display complex spatial variation (Abumere,\nand basis of residential polarization in Nigerian cities within\nthe contemporary spatio\u00adsocial realities have however\nremained insufficiently explained.\nThe focus on Lagos residential condition is exciting for a\nnumber of reasons. First, Lagos is a rapidly growing\n1Lagos State University, Nigeria\n2Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Nigeria\nCorresponding Author:\nIbrahim Rotimi Aliu, Department of Geography and planning, Lagos State\nUniversity, Ojo, PMB 1087, Apapa, Lagos, Nigeria.\nEmail: ibrolordtimi@yahoo.co.uk\nUnderstanding Residential Polarization in\na Globalizing City: A Study of Lagos\nIbrahim Rotimi Aliu1 and Olayinka A.

The city has existed\nprecariously and resiliently from the colonial era assuming a\ncosmopolitan look in the process of growth and evolution.\nSecond, it occupies a privileged position on the National\nCity hierarchy as the first seat of colonial power, the first\ncapital city of Nigeria, and obviously the most industrialized\nregion in the whole West African sub-region. Third, Lagos\npossesses the most developed housing market in Nigeria (see\nAluko, 2000). There are three discernible spatial patterns of\nhousing structures in Lagos: the high-density-low-quality\nresidential, the medium-density-medium-quality residential,\nand the low-density-high-quality residential areas (Aluko,\nregions with peculiar residential quality, price, and socioeco-\nnomic characteristics.\nThe objectives of this study are to\n1. describe and summarize the polarization of residen-\ntial quality indicators in the study area,\n2. analyze the correlations between the residential qual-\nity variables,\n3. explore the residential quality components within the\nresidential density areas of the city, and\n4. offer practical implications of the polarization of res-\nidential quality in the megacity of Lagos.\nThis article contributes to literature on housing polariza-\ntion in three ways: (1) It gives a fresh empirical explanation\non the residential polarization that exists in Lagos megacity,\n(2) it confirms the assumption that variation in residential\nquality reflects a medley of home attributes, and (3) it\nreinforces the theory that these attributes can be collapsed\ninto a few quality variables.\nTheoretical Premises\nThere are divergent opinions among scholars on what actu-\nally generates residential polarization within a given locality\nor political entity. While some ascribe residential polariza-\ntion to the external and internal designs of dwellings, others\ncanvass the environmental quality proposition such as public\nfacilities available within the neighborhood (Ajala &\nresidential quality differentials that account for urban social\npolarization although, social, economic, and cultural differ-\nences play obvious role. Urban scholars often conceive resi-\ndential quality as minimum livable conditions of a residential\ndwelling in terms of structural design, dimension of space,\nand environmental suitability (Mabogunje, Hardoy, & Misra,\nsizes structural solidity and durability, basic services provi-\nsion, unfettered accessibility, security of tenure, security,\nchoice, and reduction of crowdedness (Agbola, 2005).\nPutting the concept of residential quality in proper perspec-\ntive, Aliu (2012), in a recent study, defines residential quality\nas the structural as well as the neighborhood attributes of\ndwellings in a specific location.\nTheoretically, as indicated in Figure 1, housing possesses\nthree physical quality dimensions: location, structural, and\nneighborhood quality. The structural quality reflects the\nintrinsic values of houses, the location quality reflects the\npositional attributes of dwelling, and the neighborhood\nSTRUCTURAL\nRESIDENTIAL\nPOLARIZATION\nLOCATION\nNEIGHBOR\nHOOD\nFigure 1. A model of residential polarization.\nAliu and Ajala 3\nquality reflects the extrinsic values of the neighborhood\nwhere houses are located (Ajala & Adelodun, 2007; Aluko,\n2004). At the theoretical level, residential quality can be\nmeasured in terms of accessibility, drainage, serenity, secu-\nrity, parking, environmental sanitation (neighborhood qual-\nity); proximity to work, children's schools, shopping centers,\nplaces of worship, friends, and relations (location quality);\nand house type, number of rooms, room space, toilets, baths,\nwater sources, patio, kitchen, lot size, and aesthetics (struc-\ntural quality). However, residential quality is very controver-\nsial and has been shown to be unique to different races\n(Mabogunje et al., 1978). There is no universal residential\nstandard that is acceptable to all societies of the world.\nGeographical and ethnographic peculiarities define more\noften the type of housing quality and standard that prevail\nwithin a particular socio\u00adcultural setting (Dewilde &\nThe intra-city or spatial differentiation in housing quality\nhas two theoretical premises. The first is the ecological\nmodel of residential polarization. The proponents of this\ntheory canvass the argument that the cityscape would natu-\nrally be characterized by land uses especially residential land\nuses which would be antagonistic to one another and there-\nfore display variegated patterns as each land use tends to\nserve a particular interest of the urban dwellers. The ecologi-\ncal model of residential polarization draws tremendously\nfrom the works of classical ecological scholars notably\nThe second theoretical premise on which intra-city residen-\ntial differentiation is based is the neo-classical economic\nrationalization model. The neo-classical economists have\ncontinued to remonstrate about the operation of the housing\nmarket which subsists on the invisible price mechanism. To\nthe neo-classical school of thought, the housing market con-\ndition, which is invariably imperfect, determines the nature\nof housing that permeates a given location and also the\nsocioeconomic condition of a place will go a long way to\ndefine the existing quantity and quality of housing therein\nquality of dwellings provided, in a place or region, depends\non the socioeconomic status of the builders. In poor societies\nwhere people struggle to have property, the structural and\nneighborhood facilities of houses are hugely compromised,\nand because most renters make do with what is available,\nthese forms of housing are taken by the city dwellers that are\nless economically privileged (Aliu & Adebayo, 2010).\nHowever, theoretically this study leans toward the ecological\nmodel for its adequate depiction of spatial polarizations in\nurban land uses especially housing.\nFrom theoretical evaluation of spatial polarization of\nhousing, we can therefore hypothesize that there is gener-\nally a significant variation in the housing quality within\nthe city region. Given the socioeconomic and cultural rea-\nsons, housing often displays not only inter-market varia-\ntions but intra-market differentiation in quality. As there\nare differences in housing quality from one city to the\nother or one country to the other, there are also differences\nin quality from one neighborhood to the other. Residential\nquality therefore can be perceived along varying geo-\ngraphical scales: global, regional, and local. In this study,\nthe differences in residential quality in three density areas\nof Lagos city is considered.\nStudy Area\nGeographically, Lagos state is located between longitudes\nLocated in the South Western region of Nigeria, Lagos State\nis bounded in the east and in the north by Ogun State, in the\nsouth by the Atlantic Ocean, and on the western flank by\nRepublic of Benin (see Figure 2). It occupies a total land area\nland area of Lagos, it invariably remains the smallest state in\nNigeria. Lagos State is characterized by tropical high cli-\nmate, with high temperature, high humidity, and heavy rain-\nfall, two rainfall peak regimes in June and October. The\nmicroclimate is also influenced by the proximity to the\nocean. The rainy season in Lagos generally starts in April\nextending to October with a short cool but dry spell inAugust\n(August Break).\nLagos is the most urbanized and industrialized region in\nabout 10 million people, out of which about 8 million (80%)\nlive in the metropolis (National Population Commission\nCensus, 2006). Lagos is now a globalizing megacity, with\nprojected to be about 15 million (United Nations Habitat,\n(LGAs) among which 17 are within the megacity region.\nTwelve LGAs namely Ajeromi-Ifelodun, Agege, Lagos\nIsland, Oshodi-Isolo, and Mushin (high residential density\n[HRD]); Amuwo-Odofin, Lagos Mainland, Somolu, and\nSurulere (medium residential density [MRD]); Ikeja, Apapa,\nand Eti-Osa (low residential density [LRD]) form the study\narea for this research (see Figure. 2).

A multi-stage systematic random field survey was\nconducted in 56 wards of 12 LGAs of Lagos to acquire the\nprimary data needed for the study. As many as 1,485 copies\nof structured questionnaires were administered on household\n4 SAGE Open\nheads within the study area. The study area was divided into\nthree residential density areas, namely, the LRD, the MRD,\nand the HRD areas, and questionnaires were distributed in\nthe residential areas in the ratio 1:2:3, respectively. To ensure\nrepresentativeness, the questionnaire distribution followed\nthe population densities of the residential areas; hence, the\nhighest questionnaires were administered in the HRD which\nconstitutes the most densely populated area and the lowest in\nthe LRD which is the least populated area. This means that\none sixth of the questionnaires making 270 were distributed\nin the LRD, one third making 486 in the MRD, and one half\nmaking 729 in the HRD. The questionnaires were collated,\ncoded, and analyzed using different descriptive and inferen-\ntial techniques in the Statistical Package for Social Scientists\nMeasures of Variables\nResidential quality variables are expansive and best mea-\nsured by considering the exterior, environmental, and struc-\ntural variables of dwellings (Ajala & Adelodun, 2007; Aliu,\ntial quality data in this study were measured by 20 neighbor-\nhood and structural quality variables, and these are presented\nin Table 1. These are the attributes of dwellings that are asso-\nciated with the dwellings occupied by Lagos residents at the\nmoment. The variables were drawn from both empirical lit-\nerature and standard residential surveys on housing studies\nin Lagos in recent time (see Aliu, 2012; Aliu & Adebayo,\nAnalytical Techniques\nThree analytical techniques are used to analyze the collected\ndata in this study. The first analytical technique involves the\nuse of descriptive statistics such as mean, cross tabulation,\nand percentage frequency distribution. These are univariate\nanalytical methods that were used to describe and summarize\nresidential quality data. The second analytical technique is\nthe correlation statistics used to establish association between\npairs of residential quality variables. The third technique is\nthe principal component analysis (PCA). The PCA technique\nis a multivariate statistical technique that has as its objectives\nto take p variables s (standardized original variables) and to\nfind linear combination of these to produce indices Zs that\nare orthogonal (Robinson, 1998). PCA is a data-reduction\ntechnique which is used in this study to reduce many vari-\nables on location, neighborhood, and structural characteris-\ntics of dwellings in the study area to a few important\ncomponents and thus explain level of contribution to total\nvariation observed in the residential quality data. According\nto literature, PCA can be used in this way to explore the\nlatent components that underline patterns exhibited in a par-\nticular region or delineated area (Hardy & Bryan, 2006;\nhave found the usefulness of PCA as an exploratory frame-\nIn this study, the PCA is also used to explore the residential\ncomponents that account for differentiation in residential\nquality in three residential density areas of Lagos megacity\nregion. The PCA furnishes us with the information\nFigure 2. The study area--Lagos megacity region.\nAliu and Ajala 5\nTable 1.

The PCA follows sequentially in aggregating the com-\nponent loadings through a set of constructs as represented in\nEquation (1):\nZ = + +...+\n     \nwhere Z is the loading score as a component variable\nwhich according to Keiser criterion should not be less than 1,\n1p represents the variance loading on component variable,\nand p represents the original variables. But 1p represents\nthe weight of var (Z) = Z1, Z1 = 11 is maximized and\nthis is subject to the constraint given in Equation 2:\n  \n+ +...+ = (2)\nFor PCA, the variances are the Eigenvalues of the covari-\nance matrix and their extracted proportions vary in accor-\ndance with the sequence as described in Equation (3):\n( ) > ( ) > ( ) ... ( ) (3)\nFrom Equation (3), it is expected that the first component\nwould make higher contribution to the total variance than the\nsecond, and the second would make higher contribution than\nthe third, and so on and so forth. Three parameters are sig-\nnificant in the application of PCA results for pattern descrip-\ntion. These are the latent variable variance (component), the\ntotal variance, and the corresponding variance loadings of\noriginal variables on the components (Robinson, 1998). The\nKeiser, Meyer, and Okin (KMO) parameter available in the\nSPSS 17 package provides a test of the adequacy of data\nused, and the higher the KMO the more reliable the data. The\nPCA statistical tool is useful in sieving the variables of\nredundancy and therefore emphasizing the more relevant\nvariables (Hardy & Bryan, 2006). The PCA method is used\nto extract the relevant residential quality variables that are\ncrucial to the explanation of residential polarization in the\nstudy area. However, methodologically Varimax method\nwhich allows orthogonal rotation was used to produce uncor-\nrelated component loadings and outputs that are more com-\nprehensible for the explanation required in the study (Aliu &\nResults and Discussion\nDescriptive Analysis of Residential Polarization in\nLagos\nResidential quality features are broadly explained in two\nways, namely, neighborhood and structural features.

As indicated in Table 2, houses that are located in\nthe city core areas are barely 34.3% compared with 65.7% that\nare located in the outer-city core areas. Majority of the houses\nare in neighborhoods closer to places of work, hospital, chil-\ndren schools, religious centers (churches and mosques), and\nlocal markets or shopping centers. These spatial patterns\nreflect the tendency among the residents in the study area to\nminimize the cost of transportation to the activity places (Aliu,\nstudy as having unhindered opportunity to public transport by\nthe residents. There are two categories of accessibility namely\nlimited accessibility and reasonable accessibility. Findings as\nshown in Table 2 indicate that majority of the dwellings in\nLagos, which is 82.9%, are situated in areas that are reason-\nably accessible to public transport. Large proportions are also\nin mixed layout, good environmental quality, and formal secu-\nrity neighborhoods.\nThe structural features of dwellings in Lagos are described\nby six variables. The first is the housing type of dwelling\nunits in the study area. As presented in Table 3, analysis indi-\ncates that majority (66.1%) of the dwellings are multi-family\nunit localized as \"face-me-I-face-you,\"1 while 31.2% are\nflats, and 2.7% are duplex. The preponderance of face-me-I-\nface-you housing units in Lagos has been well explained in\nAliu and Ajala 7\nond is the number of rooms in each dwelling unit. Number of\nrooms is categorized into two that is 1 to 2 rooms and\n3 rooms and more. According to information in Table 3,\nmajority of the houses representing 55% contain 1 to 2\nrooms. The third structural quality observed in the study area\nis the room space in the dwelling units, and findings indicate\nthat 56.9% consist of large living rooms (see Table 3). The\nfourth attribute of the dwelling units studied is the number of\ntoilets and baths provided within each dwelling in the study\narea. Analysis indicates that 58.4% of the dwellings have 1\nbath and 1 toilet facility, and the rest (41.6%) of them possess\n2 to 3 toilet and bath facilities. The fifth structural quality\nvariable of the dwelling units examined is the nature of the\nKitchen provided and results show that 78.2% of the units\nactually have untiled kitchen, compared with 21.8% of the\nunits that do have tiled kitchen. The sixth attribute is the inte-\nrior design of the dwelling and results presented in Table 3\nalso indicate that about 96% of the dwellings can be said to\nbe of poor quality given their interior conditions. These\nresults confirm recent observations on dwelling conditions\nby previous studies in Nigerian cities (Ajala & Adelodun,\nOther residential quality variables (which are not strictly\nspeaking structural attributes of dwellings, but rather socio-\neconomic quality attributes) include water supply, tenure\ntype, and annual rents. On the account of the type of water\navailable in the dwelling units, analysis shows that 59.3% of\nthe dwellings in Lagos have pipe-borne/borehole water as\nagainst 40.7% dwellings with well/water vendor. The issue\nof tenure often reflects in the macro-economic performance\nof the country and it is a measure of urban economic perfor-\nsplit into two that is owner-occupier and renter.

And last, the dwelling unit costs or rents are con-\nsidered for analysis. Results indicate that dwelling units with\nThe spatial patterns of these residential quality variables\nindicate significant intergroup independence with chi-square\n(2) values all significant at 99.9% alpha levels.\nBivariate Analysis of Residential Polarization in\nLagos\nThe normal practice when using PCA as an exploratory\nframework is to begin with the correlation of the variables of\ninterest as this provides the initial insights into the nature and\nextent of associations among the variables (Aliu & Adebayo,\nthere are 20 residential variables of interest. Bivariate zero-\norder correlation analysis shows that these variables corre-\nlate to a lesser degree with one another. According to\ninformation in Table 4, the highest correlations exist between\nmultiunit house type and 1 to 2 room units (r = 0.864) as also\nThe lowest correlations exist between dwellings with formal\nsecurity and neighborhood with poor exterior quality\n(r = 0.003) and between 0 to 4 km proximity to relations and\nneighborhood with poor exterior quality (r = 0.001).\nAmong the structural quality variables house type, num-\nber of rooms, toilets, and baths, kitchen, and price have high\nand significant correlations with a number of other variables.\nFor instance, house type is highly and significantly corre-\nlated with number of room (r = 0.864), toilet and bath\nmeans that housing types are associated with rooms, number\nof toilets and baths, nature of kitchen, and home rentals level.\nNumber of rooms is also significantly correlated with toilets\n(r = 0.712). The association between price and number of\nrooms is understandable as room number is a function of cost\nper room. Toilet and bath correlates with kitchen (r = 0.587)\nand price (r = 0.707) and kitchen correlates highly with price\n(r = 0.545). However, three variables stand out very distinc-\ntively among the neighborhood variables in their unique low\nand negative correlations with other variables and these are\nmetropolitan area, social relations, and security (see Table 4\nThe implication is that variables with strong correlations\nwith one another are expected to load similarly on the same\nPCA latent components (see Aliu, 2012; Aliu & Adebayo,\n2012). Hence, from the results of the correlations in Table 4,\none might begin to see that variables such as price/rent, num-\nber of rooms, toilet and bath, and kitchen would load on the\nsame component, just as variables that have extremely low\ncoefficients load separately on different components.\nMultivariate Analysis of Residential Polarization in\nLagos Megacity\nAlthough dwellings often display varying number of quality\nindicators, only few of these indicators actually influence the\nspatial organization of the housing market (Aliu, 2012; Aliu\nQuigley, 1985). To determine these few residential quality\nvariables, we use PCA. As indicated in Tables 5 through 8,\nfour PCA results are generated for explaining the essential\ncomponents that summarily describe residential quality\nstructure in Lagos. Eight latent variables were extracted from\nthe rotated PCA of 20 original variables used to represent the\nneighborhood and structural quality of dwelling units of\nLagos residents. The PCA components of variables with a\nminimum loading of 0.40 and at least two distinct variables\nwere used to facilitate easy explanation. The eight latent\ncomponent variables extracted in this study accounted for\n77.7% of the variance in the data set in all residential density\nrespectively. The KMO tests of data adequacy are respec-\nhigh. However, based on theoretical assumption of the Kaiser\ncriterion, only five of these eight components are important\nto the explanation of the total variance of 64.1% of residen-\ntial attributes that shape housing polarization in Lagos . The\nremaining components have less than 1.0 Eigenvalue and\njust one significantly high loading variable on each of them.\nMore components have been extracted in some cases. For\ninstance, Opoku and Abdul-Muhmin (2010) extracted nine\ncomponents, while Kain and Quigley (1970) extracted five\ncomponents.\nA look at Table 5 indicates that five dwelling unit quality\nvariables, namely, number of rooms, house type, number of\ntoilets and baths, kitchen, and price/rent strongly load on\nComponent I with Eigenvalue of 6.1 and Variance of 30.7%.\nThis component is therefore named \"Dwelling Facility-\nQuality I,\" as it contains dwelling variables that are of\nimmense usefulness within the residential unit structure. The\nsecond component contains six variables, namely, proximity\nto hospital, school, market, worship, work, and space with\nloadings well over 0.40 each. This component is appropri-\nately named \"Location Proximity-Quality II.\" The third\ncomponent has high loadings on three variables: layout,\nexterior quality, and accessibility. This component is there-\nfore named \"Neighborhood Exterior-Quality III.\" The fourth\ncomponent contains high loadings on two structural quality\nvariables of water and interior quality and it is therefore\ncalled \"Dwelling Interior-Quality IV.\" Metropolitan charac-\nteristic variable represented by outer city loads singly and\nTable 4.

The sixth,\nseven, and eight components also contain quite a number of\nvariables with low and negative loadings except relations\nwhich loads very strongly on the sixth (Social Bond V), ten-\nure on the seventh (Barrier to Entry VI), and security on the\neight component (Security/Safety Quality VIII). However,\nspatial variations exist in the structure of the components\nacross residential density areas. As indicated in Table 6, for\ninstance in the LRD, the first component \"Dwelling Facility-\nQuality I\" accounts for nearly 24% of the total variance in\nthe set, the second \"Neighborhood Exterior-Quality II\"\naccount for 12.7%, followed by \"Location Proximity-Quality\n\"Dwelling Interior-Quality VI\" 5.2%, \"Barrier-to-entry VII\"\n5%, \"Security/Safety-Quality VIII\" 4.6%. Six components\nbased on Kaiser Criterion are important in this LRD and they\naccount for 61.8% of the total variance. Incidentally, a com-\nponent \"Social-Bond\" has no distinct presence in this region\nas it merges with component VII. As there is slight\nrearrangement in the components so in the variables that\naccount for them. Component I contains in addition to the\nprevious variables interior quality, while hospital and wor-\nship load on Component IV.\nThe situation in the MRD presents a different revelation\nas the arrangement of the components is different from those\ndiscovered in LRD. Extracting the same eight components as\nin LRD, results of PCA components in MRD are more inter-\nesting. The first component to be extracted in the MRD is\n\"Dwelling Facility-Quality I,\" followed by \"Location\nProximity-Quality II,\" \"Neighborhood Exterior-Quality III,\"\n\"Neighborhood Integrity-Safety IV,\" \"Social-Bond V,\"\n\"Dwelling Interior-Quality VI & VII,\" and \"Barrier-to-entry\nVIII.\" The components, respectively, account for 30.5%,\nvariance in the data set (see Table 7).\nAlthough the same numbers of components were extracted\nin the LRD and MRD, the arrangement and loading values\ndiffer significantly. The MRD loadings perhaps display the\nmost inconsistent orientation, as many variables load in mul-\ntiples on different components--for instance, work, accessi-\nbility, space, security, interior quality, and kitchen. Like the\nARD components, the pattern displayed in MRD is a bit anti-\nthetical to the normal trend. The explanation for this unusual\nTable 5.

PCA = principal component analysis; ARD = all residential density; KMO = Keiser, Meyer, and Okin.\nvariation from expectation may be that the MRD, in terms of\nsocioeconomic attributes, falls between the low economic\nstatus of residents in HRD and high economic status of resi-\ndents in LRD (Aliu, 2012). Only five components that\naccount for 66.7% of the variance are important in explain-\ning residential quality variables in the MRD of the study\narea. The PCA results in HRD as shown in Table 8 present a\ndifferent pattern from two previously discussed areas. Eight\ncomponents account for 77.8% of the total variation in resi-\ndential quality data used in the study. The first component\n\"Location Proximity-Quality I\" accounts for 27.6%,\n\"Dwelling Facility-Quality II\" 15.4%, \"Dwelling Interior-\nQuality III\" 7.6%, \"Neighborhood Exterior-Quality IV\"\n7.1%, \"Neighborhood-Integrity V\" 5.9%, \"Security/Safety-\nQuality VI\" 5.1%, \"Social-Bond VII\" 4.8%, and \"Barrier-to-\nentry VIII\" 4.2% of the variance observed in the set.\nAccording to information in Table 8, six variables loaded\nheavily and positively on the first component and four on the\nsecond component. Out of the four variables that loaded on\nthe second component, number of rooms, number of toilets\nand baths, and house type are the most substantial residential\nquality variables. All the variables except accessibility con-\nsistently load on the expected components. The accessibility\nvariable loads on two components (V and VI) and this\nconfirms its inconsistency in housing quality provision.\nIncidentally, only six components that account for 68.8% of\nthe variance are important in explaining the residential qual-\nity variations in the HRD part of the study area. Although\nprevious studies do not differentiate clearly among the den-\nsity areas they however, found that variation exist among the\nresidential variables as they load on the components (Aliu &\nConclusions and Practical Implications\nThis article explores the nature and pattern of residential\npolarization in a foremost African megacity, Lagos. The key\nfindings from this study have indicated a marked differentia-\ntion in the residential quality components in the three resi-\ndential density areas of Lagos as proposed in the theoretical\nsection of this article. Using the exploratory PCA approach,\nthe 20 residential quality variables responsible for this\npolarization were explained by few components which\nare dwelling-facility, location-proximity, interior, exterior,\nneighborhood-integrity, social-bond, barrier to entry, and\nsecurity components. However, these components are nei-\nther consistently extracted nor equally valued within the\nthree residential density areas. For instance, in the LRD,\nTable 6.

PCA Rotated Component Loadings for HRD (N = 729).\nResidential quality variable\nComponent\nCommunality\nNote. PCA = principal component analysis; HRD = high residential density; KMO = Keiser, Meyer, and Okin.\nDwelling Facility-Quality, Neighborhood Exterior-Quality,\nand Location Proximity-Quality components are the first\nthree components. But in the MRD, the Dwelling Facility,\nLocation Proximity, and Neighborhood Exterior-Quality\ncomponents are the first three. Also, in the HRD, Location\nProximity, Dwelling Facility, and Dwelling Interior-Water\nQuality components are the first three residential compo-\nnents extracted. The compositional disparity occurs due to\nthe dwelling peculiarities of residential density areas. These\nindicate that residential polarizations do not just happen;\nthey are produced and patterned by a combination of features\nAlthough, the results do not perfectly confirm the eco-\nlogical model in the modes of explanation rendered by\nBurgess or Hoyt, yet they offer explanation on the peculiar\nhousing patterns and the ways home quality bears implicit\nrelationship with home prices/rents in African cities. The\nvariations in the components indicate a decreasing promi-\nnence of some variables for instance, social relation, barrier\nto entry, and security and an increasing importance of dwell-\ning facilities, location, and neighborhood quality in the spa-\ntial polarization of the city built environment. These\nvariations can be further expatiated in the light of historical\nand political development of cities in developing countries\nwhere due to colonial and traditional factors, dwellings in the\ncore city areas reflect lower qualities compared with those in\nthe Government Residential Areas or the LRD (Abiodun,\n1978). In the case of Lagos, the HRD and parts of MRD are\ncharacterized by unplanned, informal, and traditional multi-\nunit apartments, unlike the LRD areas that are characterized\nby planned, formal, and modern residential structures.\nTheoretically, these results interrogate the fluidity of housing\nquality variables that urban scholars use to describe housing\npolarization and home values in developing economies.\nBesides the theoretical implications, findings from this\nstudy also have a number of practical implications for prop-\nerty management, urban designs, and sustainability of the\ncity. The Dwelling Facility, Neighborhood, and Location\nProximity-Quality components remain the most important\ncomponents that account for differentiation in residential\ndwellings in Lagos megacity. In all, the four rotated matrices,\nprice/rent is consistently high and positively loaded on\nDwelling Facility-Quality component. It shows that the most\nimportant price determining quality variables are the dwell-\nKain & Quigley, 1970). The correlations that dwelling qual-\nity variables bear with prices are understandable as quality\nhomes have a lot to do with costs expended on the structural\nand neighborhood attributes of dwellings. These findings are\nimportant for developers and surveyors who need to under-\nstand the spatio\u00adstructural dynamics of home quality and\nresidential valuation. However, good valuation of property\nrequires constant management of structural and neighbor-\nhood facilities. No matter how well designed and constructed\nresidential dwellings are at the time of construction, after a\nwhile, deterioration will set in except in cases where atten-\ntion is given to the structural and environmental manage-\nment of the building. A proper building management and\nmaintenance culture does not only elongate the physical life\nof individual buildings, but also enhances the future value of\nthe property as an economic entity (Arimah, 1992; Kain &\nThe findings from this study are of immense importance\nto urban designers. Basically the dwellings that permeate the\nthree residential density areas are relatively different as\ndwellings in the HRD and MRD display lower quality level\nthan those in the LRD. This apparent residential polarization\nshows that intervention policies on residential improvement\nor rehabilitation should avoid blanket application of the same\nmeasures on the whole city. Instead, corrective measures\nshould be made in accordance with the peculiarities of the\nresidential density areas. The discernible polarization of\ndwelling quality in Lagos can be addressed through urban\ndesign methods such as gentrification. In the core city (HRD)\nareas of Lagos, majority of the residential dwellings were\nbuilt many years ago with little attention to the structural and\nTowry-Coker, 2012). This has been attributed partly to the\npoor financial capacity of the owners and partly to the low\neconomic power of the potential renters. Most of these old\ndwellings are presently in decrepit conditions and need reha-\nbilitation. However, the nature of tenure, where the owners\nare the grandchildren of the first owner may stand in the way\nof their improvement. For reasons bordering on tradition and\nculture, in the core areas of Lagos, majority of the buildings\nare jointly owned by second to fourth generation of the origi-\nnal owners. The children hardly agree to either sell or engage\nproperty developers to construct befitting modern structures\nto replace the blighted ones. Gentrification in highly polar-\nized urban environment like Lagos will impact the property\nand environmental conditions in two important ways. One,\ngentrification will provide further vacancies for better resi-\ndential units through filtering; and two, it will engender envi-\nronmental sustainability of the city. In contemporary urban\nplanning thinking, residential dwellings are crucial compo-\nnents of urban design and sustainable city growth (Echenique,\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNote\n1. Face-me-I-face-you is a localized term often used to describe\nthe traditional housing unit commonly found in Nigerian cities\nand hinterlands. It is commonly designed to suit many house-\nholds living within a single residential structure. By design,\nthis kind of dwelling contains multiple living rooms sometimes\nwith no resting room (parlor). The rooms are laid facing each\nother in opposite direction and could be 4 to 6 on each side,\nwith a narrow passage dividing the two sides. Rooms face one\nanother directly in such a way that one household can not do\nwithout contacting others, hence the name face-me-I-face-you.\nsions (Aliu & Adebayo, 2012). In densely populated cities like\nLagos, the multiunit dwellings are space-efficient designs that\ncould harbor large household sizes with up to 6 or more per-\nsons per unit. They are characterized by one common kitchen,\na bath, and at both sides of the building two exit doors. Face-\nme-I-face-you dwellings do not have in most cases perimeter\nfences or gates.\nReferences\nAbiodun, O. J. (1976). Housing problems in Nigerian cities. Town\nAbumere, I. S. (1994).
