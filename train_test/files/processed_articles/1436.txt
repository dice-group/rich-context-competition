    "abstract": "Abstract--The purpose of the present study was to examine patterns of systolic and diastolic hypertension by age in the\nnationally representative National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III and to determine when\ntreatment and control efforts should be recommended. Percentage distribution of 3 blood pressure subtypes (isolated\nsystolic hypertension, combined systolic/diastolic hypertension, and isolated diastolic hypertension) was categorized for\nuncontrolled hypertension (untreated and inadequately treated) in 2 age groups (ages 50 and 50 years). Overall,\nisolated systolic hypertension was the most frequent subtype of uncontrolled hypertension (65%). Most subjects with\nhypertension (74%) were 50 years of age, and of this untreated older group, nearly all (94%) were accurately staged\nby systolic blood pressure alone, in contrast to subjects in the untreated younger group, who were best staged by diastolic\nblood pressure. Furthermore, most subjects (80%) in the older untreated and the inadequately treated groups had isolated\nsystolic hypertension and required a greater reduction in systolic blood pressure than in the younger groups (-13.3 and\nof 140 mm Hg. Contrary to previous perceptions, isolated systolic hypertension was the majority subtype of\nuncontrolled hypertension in subjects of ages 50 to 59 years, comprised 87% frequency for subjects in the sixth decade\nof life, and required greater reduction in systolic blood pressure in these subjects to reach treatment goal compared with\nsubjects in the younger group.

Franklin, Milagros J. Jacobs, Nathan D. Wong, Gilbert J. L'Italien, Pablo Lapuerta\n Key Words: hypertension, essential  blood pressure  clinical trials  hypertension, systolic, isolated\nMultiple clinical and observational studies in the elderly\nhave demonstrated that elevated systolic blood pres-\nsure (SBP) is a more potent predictor of adverse cardiovas-\ncular outcomes than is elevated diastolic blood pressure\n(DBP)1\u00ad5 and that treating isolated systolic hypertension\n(ISH) in the elderly reduces risk of cardiovascular disease\nevents.6,7 Despite the strength of these observational and\nintervention studies, only about one quarter of hypertensive\nindividuals are being treated to goal.8 Recently, the Coordi-\nnating Committee of the National High Blood Pressure\nEducation Program (NHBPEP), recognizing the magnitude of\nthis public health problem, stated that SBP in general and ISH\nin particular should become the major criteria for the diag-\nnosis, staging, and therapeutic management of hypertension\nin the middle-aged and elderly.9\nISH is strongly age dependent. Both the Framingham Heart\nStudy and the nationally representative National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III (conducted in\nincreasing SBP occurs throughout adult life in untreated\nindividuals.10,11 In contrast, DBP was shown to increase in\nadults until age 50 years and decline from the sixth decade\nforward.10,11 This age-related pattern of increasing rates of\nISH for ages 50 years was not only observed in the\nFramingham Heart Study10 and in NHANES III partici-\npants,11 but also in a meta-analysis of 10 studies that reported\nthe prevalence of ISH.12 In total, these studies suggest that\nage 50 years is a useful cutpoint to dichotomize arbitrarily\nhypertensive individuals into 2 groups for the purpose of\nclassifying hypertension by subtype.\nThe present study focused on the new NHBPEP advisory\nguidelines with the expressed purpose of further characteriz-\ning subtypes of systolic and diastolic hypertension. By use of\nthe NHANES III national data set, specific attention was\ndirected toward identifying frequency of ISH and other\nsubtypes of hypertension by age1 and examining hypertension\nawareness, staging, and treatment target goals across the\nentire adult age spectrum.2 We also examined the hypothesis\nFrom the Heart Disease Prevention Program, University of California, Irvine (S.S.F., M.J.J., N.D.W.), and Bristol-Myers Squibb, Pharmaceutical\nResearch Institute, Princeton, NJ (G.J.L., P.L.).\nCorrespondence and reprint requests to Dr Stanley S.

Methods of BP\nmeasurement have been described previously.8,11\nDefinitions of Variables\nHypertension was defined as mean SBP 140 mm Hg, mean DBP\n90 mm Hg, or current treatment for hypertension with prescription\nmedication. Awareness of hypertension was determined by inter-\nviews only with untreated hypertensive participants. Treatment of\nhypertension was defined as use of a prescription medication to\nmanage high BP at the time of interview. Treatment success was\ndefined as pharmacological treatment of hypertension associated\nwith SBP 140 and DBP 90 mm Hg, in accordance with the Sixth\nReport of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection,\nEvaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC-VI).13\nInadequate treatment was defined as pharmacological treatment of\nhypertension with SBP 140 mm Hg and/or DBP 90 mm Hg.\nControl rates for all participants being treated with antihypertensive\nmedications were calculated separately for SBP, DBP, and individual\nhypertensive subtypes.\nStudy Design\nNHANES III data were compared by age (50 or 50 years),\nantihypertensive treatment status (uncontrolled hypertension, di-\nvided into untreated and inadequately treated groups), and hyperten-\nsive subtype (isolated diastolic hypertension [IDH], SBP 140 and\nDBP 90 mm Hg; combined systolic/diastolic hypertension [SDH],\n90 mm Hg). Distribution of each hypertensive subtype by age was\ndetermined and graphed separately for untreated and inadequately\ntreated individuals.\nIn addition, untreated subjects 50 and 50 years of age were\ncompared on the basis of BP staging by SBP and DBP. According to\nJNC-VI guidelines,13,14 congruent SBP and DBP stages were defined\nas follows: optimal and normal (SBP 130 mm Hg and DBP\nDBP 100 mm Hg). Because so few subjects had stage 3 hyperten-\nsion, these subjects were collapsed into the stage 2 category. When\na disparity was seen between SBP and DBP stages, participants were\nclassified into the higher stage (upstaged), in accordance with the\nJNC-VI guidelines. In the current analysis, participants with high-\nnormal BP or hypertension were classified on the basis of JNC-VI\nguidelines as having congruent levels of SBP and DBP, upstaged on\nthe basis of SBP alone, or upstaged on the basis of DBP alone.14 BP\nreductions needed to reach target goals were determined for the 3\nhypertensive subtypes in both the untreated and inadequately treated\ngroups, dichotomized at 50 years of age.\nStatistical Analysis\nNHANES III data were extrapolated to assess the burden of\nhypertension awareness, treatment, and control among the entire\nadult civilian, noninstitutionalized population of the United States.\nThese estimates were weighted and adjusted to reduce bias from\nnonresponses during the interview. Because the design of NHANES\nIII was a multistage probability sample, conventional statistical\nanalyses with underlying distributional assumptions were inappro-\npriate for variance estimation and statistical testing. SUDAAN\nsoftware (Research Triangle Institute) PROC DESCRIPT was used\nto compute Taylor series standard errors, t test was used for\ncontrasted means, and 2 and the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test\nwere used for survey data.15 Statistical tests were used to compare\nage grouping and treatment categories.15 All analyses were per-\nformed with SAS statistical software (SAS Corp).16\nResults\nDemographic Characteristics\nOn the basis of the extrapolated NHANES III data, 42.7\nmillion adult Americans were identified as hypertensive,\nwhich represented 24% of the adjusted adult US population.\nA total of 23.6% of the hypertensive population was treated to\ntarget BP goal; the remaining untreated (47.8%) and inade-\nquately treated hypertensive individuals (28.6%) together\nthan twice as many individuals (66%) had BP higher than the\nSBP goal of 140 mm Hg than did higher than the DBP goal\nprised three fourths of all hypertensive subjects. The older\ngroup was predominantly female (58%), whereas the younger\ngroup was predominantly male (62.5%). The predominant\nhypertensive subtype was ISH (79.8%) in the older group\nthe younger group (98% stage 1 and 2% stage 2 or higher).\nAwareness of Hypertension\nAmong untreated hypertensives in the US, 42% of individuals\nwith DBP 90 mm Hg were aware of their condition but only\nstatus. Similarly, in the age 50 years group, 39% of\nindividuals were aware of their hypertension, whereas only\n31% of those age 50 years knew of their diagnosis.\nHypertension awareness was greatest among subjects with\nadjustment for age and gender. Awareness rates differed\nsignificantly between SDH and IDH (P0.0008) and SDH\n(P0.69), after adjustment for age and gender.\nFrequency Distribution of Hypertension Subtypes\nby Age\nThe proportion of subjects with ISH was progressively higher\nand the proportion of subjects with IDH progressively lower\nwith increments in age in the untreated (Figure 1) and\ninadequately treated groups (Figure 2). ISH was the most\ncommon hypertension subtype in participants of age 50\nyears, among both untreated (79.7%) and inadequately\ntreated (80.1%) individuals. Conversely, for the younger\nhypertensive group, IDH was most common among untreated\n(46.9%) and SDH was most common among inadequately\ntreated individuals (45.1%). In both the untreated and inade-\nquately treated groups, ISH became the primary hypertensive\nsubtype for subjects in their fifth decade (54%) of life and the\noverwhelming dominant hypertensive subtype by the sixth\ndecade (87%) of life. Participants 50 years of age com-\nhttp://hyper.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nprised 67% of all untreated and 86% of all inadequately\ntreated individuals with hypertension.\nJNC-VI Staging by SBP and DBP\nThe magnitude of disparity between SBP and DBP in\nclassifying untreated individuals by JNC-VI staging criteria,\nafter participants with congruent normal SBP and DBP were\neliminated from study, was compared for the 2 age groups.\nFigure 3 shows percentages of untreated participants with\nhigh normal BP or hypertension who were classified into\neach JNC-VI SBP and DBP category for the group of age\n50 years. Among untreated participants 50 years of age\nwith high-normal BP or hypertension, SBP alone correctly\nclassified JNC-VI stage in 94% of subjects (84.8% up-\nstaged on the basis of SBP alone and 9.0% with congruent\nSBP and DBP), whereas DBP alone correctly classified only\nwith congruent SBP and DBP). In contrast to the older age\ngroup, 45.8% of untreated younger NHANES III participants\nwere upstaged by DBP alone, 35.1% were upstaged on the\nbasis of SBP alone, and 19.1% had congruent stages of SBP\nand DBP (Figure 4).\nComparison of BP Reduction Needed to Reach\nTreatment Goals\nIn the inadequately treated group age 50 years, 82% had\nSBP in excess of the target goal versus 17% with DBP in\nexcess of the target goal; in contrast, 50% of the younger\ngroup had BPs that exceeded both SBP and DBP target goals.\nComparisons of BP reductions needed to reach treatment\ngoals in the untreated individuals and those categorized as\ninadequately treated are shown for hypertension subtypes by\nage categories in the Table. A significantly greater reduction\nin SBP was required to reach treatment goal in the ISH\nsubtype for the older versus the younger age group among\nuntreated people with hypertension (-13.3 versus\nFigure 1.

In contrast, the small group of\nindividuals with hypertension who are 50 years of age\npredominantly have diastolic hypertension that consists\nlargely of IDH and SDH. More than 4 times as many\ninadequately treated individuals of age 50 years had SBP\n(82%) versus DBP (17%) that was higher than target goals,\nwhereas an equal number (50%) had both SBP and DBP\nhigher than target goals in the younger group. Furthermore,\nindividuals of age 50 years with ISH who were either\nuntreated or inadequately treated required more than a 2-fold\ngreater reduction in SBP to attain JNC-VI treatment goals\nversus their younger counterparts.\nstandably found a lower frequency of ISH of 5% to 22%.\nMore recently, the community-based Framingham Heart\nStudy, which defined ISH as SBP 140 mm Hg and DBP\n90 mm Hg, reported a higher frequency of ISH in untreated\nIn contrast, the present NHANES III study, which examined\ncombined untreated and inadequately treated individuals,\nobserved a considerably larger ISH frequency of 54% in the\ngroup of age 60 years.\nFrequency of ISH, also defined with a cutoff of 140/\nresults are consistent with those presented in the present\nanalysis. A key difference is that the present analysis focused\non the uncontrolled hypertensive population rather than on all\nindividuals with hypertension. The intent was to examine\nmore closely how SBP and DBP play different roles in\ndefining the problem of uncontrolled hypertension.\nIn addition to age-related differences in subtype analysis,\nthe 2 hypertensive age groupings were strikingly dissimilar\nwith respect to JNC-VI staging and eligibility for therapy in\nuntreated individuals. This dissimilarity was evidenced by the\npronounced difference with respect to upstaging, which was\nalmost entirely related to SBP in people 50 years of age,\nwhereas the reverse was observed in individuals 50 years of\nage, among whom upstaging was mostly related to DBP. But\nbecause most of the individuals with hypertension in the\nNHANES III population were 50 years of age (74%) with\na predominance of ISH (80%), SBP was by far the most\nMean Levels of DBP and SBP With Reductions Required To Reach Targeted Goal in Untreated\nand Inadequately Treated Subjects\nHypertension Subtype/Blood Pressure\nComponent\nUntreated Individuals,\nt Test Category Differences by\nInadequate Treatment,\nt Test Category Differences by\nIDH, mm Hg (meanSE)\nSDH, mm Hg\nISH, mm Hg\n*Standard error of the mean.\n\u00b6Reduction in DBP to reach JNC-VI minimum treatment goal, 90 mm Hg.\nReduction in SBP to reach JNC-VI minimum treatment goal, 140 mm Hg.\nhttp://hyper.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nimportant overall determinant of JNC-VI upstaging and,\nhence, eligibility for therapy. These results in the NHANES\nIII age group of 50 years reinforce the findings of SBP\nupstaging in the middle-aged and older community-based\nFramingham Heart Study14 and introduce the new concept of\nDBP upstaging in the younger age group.\nPoor levels of awareness, treatment, and control of hyper-\ntension were a problem in all age groups. Although hyper-\ntension was less likely to be treated in younger than older\npeople, the absolute number of untreated individuals was\nmore than twice as high in older individuals. Furthermore,\nawareness of ISH was significantly lower than awareness of\nSDH, after correcting for the confounding effects of age and\ngender.\nClinical Implications\nMany factors may contribute to the inadequate treatment of\nhypertension, as recent reviews have emphasized.19,20 Both\nphysician bias toward focusing primarily on a DBP treatment\ngoal21,22 and physician fear of excessive lowering of DBP,23\nhave contributed to poor SBP control. Furthermore, as noted\nin the present study, among patients with hypertension, a\ngreater number of older persons have high levels of SBP\ncompared with younger patients. Most older patients with\nISH may be resistant to therapy as a result of increased left\nventricular hypertrophy,24 vascular hypertrophy and remod-\neling,25 high levels of sympathetic tone,26 and nonmodulation\nof the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system27.\nMillions of people with untreated or inadequately treated\nhypertension would benefit from full implementation of\nJNC-VI guidelines, which recommend initiating lifestyle and\npharmacological intervention, controlling both SBP and\nDBP, and simultaneously treating other major cardiovascular\nrisk factors. The potential value of dietary management\nshould not be underestimated, as recent investigations have\ndemonstrated.28 However, a significant percentage of un-\ntreated and inadequately treated older individuals with high\nand resistant ISH or SDH require a more innovative strategy\nthat includes a multiple drug regimen for adequate control of\nBP.13,29 An alternative or supplemental strategy that holds\nsome promise is the development of more potent antihyper-\ntensive agents that have minimal side effects and are specif-\nically targeted to reduce SBP.30\nStrengths and Limitations\nThe present study, which uses a national population database,\nreinforces and expands the conclusions of the new NHBPEP\nguidelines by demonstrating that individuals with hyperten-\nsion generally fall into 1 of 2 distinct categories: (1) a smaller,\nyounger population presenting primarily with diastolic hyper-\ntension and requiring a small reduction in both SBP and DBP\nto reach treatment goal and (2) a much larger, middle-aged\nand older population presenting primarily with ISH as the\nmajor cause of uncontrolled hypertension and requiring a\nlarge reduction in SBP to reach treatment goal. Because of the\ncross-sectional nature of NHANES III, the effect of treatment\non hypertensive subtypes and control rates cannot be deter-\nmined. However, it is probable that a significant percentage\nof individuals with inadequately treated ISH may have had\nSDH before beginning therapy but did not reach SBP goal\nbecause of a treatment bias or because they had a more\ndifficult to treat form of hypertension. Exploring these trends\nwill be an important subject for future clinical research.\nIn conclusion, the present study demonstrates that ISH is\nthe overwhelmingly dominant subtype of hypertension in the\nmiddle-aged and elderly population, that ISH requires a large\nreduction in SBP to reach treatment goal and, that ISH is the\npredominant subtype among persons with untreated and\ninadequately treated hypertension. Successful treatment of\nsystolic hypertension in general, and ISH in particular,\nrepresents an important public health challenge that will\nrequire more aggressive efforts at management.\nReferences\n1.
