Despite a shift towards higher poultry consumption, red meat\nstill represents the largest proportion of meat consumed in the USA (58 %). Twenty-\ntwo per cent of the meat consumed in the USA is processed. According to the\nmeat reported varied by education, race, age and gender.\nConclusions: Given the plausible epidemiological evidence for red and processed\nmeat intake in cancer and chronic disease risk, understanding the trends and deter-\nminants of meat consumption in the USA, where meat is consumed at more than three\ntimes the global average, should be particularly pertinent to researchers and other\npublic health professionals aiming to reduce the global burden of chronic disease.\n",

In the\nUSA and other developed countries, meat comprises a sig-\nnificant portion of the normal diet, contributing more than\n15% to daily energy intake, 40% to daily protein intake\nand 20% to daily fat intake(1\u00ad3). The demand for meat\nin developing countries continues to grow as the produc-\ntion and consumption of meat increases with available\nincome(4,5). A shift towards a dietary pattern characterized\nby high meat consumption also appears to supplant the\nconsumption of cereals and other foods of plant origin(1,6,7).\nEarly ecological comparisons provided the first indication\nthat high meat consumption correlated with higher rates of\nchronic disease(8,9), including CVD and cancer, the current\nleading causes of morbidity and mortality in the USA and\nother Westernised countries(10). Health risks associated with\nmeat consumption vary based on the animal the meat is\nderived from, as well as rearing, processing and preparation\nmethods(11). Meat can be further classified by the quantity\nof red v. white muscle fibres; thus, beef, pork and lamb\nproducts are generally defined as red meat and poultry\nproducts as white meat. Preparation methods such as\nsmoking, curing, salting and/or addition of preservatives\nfurther differentiate processed and fresh meat(11). The\ncomponents of meat linked to chronic disease risk include\nfat content, particularly saturated fat in red meat, and\ndietary cholesterol(12,13). Meat can also be a source of\nseveral known mutagens, including N-nitroso compounds\n(NOC) in processed meats, and heterocyclic amines\n(HCA) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) formed\nduring high-temperature cooking and grilling(14).\nIntake of fat and meat (primarily from red meat) has\nbeen of public health concern since the late 1950s when\nthe American Heart Association first recommended that\ndietary cholesterol, saturated fat and total fat be reduced\nfor the prevention of CVD(13,15); and to date, numerous\nepidemiological studies have investigated meat intake\nand cancer risk(16\u00ad19). According to the World Cancer\nResearch Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research\nreport in 2007, the evidence linking red and processed\nmeats to colorectal cancer was deemed `convincing' and\n`limited or suggestive' for other cancer sites(20).\nBased on the evidence to date, current dietary recom-\nmendations for the prevention of diet-related chronic\ndiseases(20\u00ad23) suggest to limit intake of red and processed\n*Corresponding author: Email Carrie.Daniel@nih.hhs.gov\nr The Authors 2010.

The present\nstudy describes the trends, distribution and potential\ndeterminants of meat consumption within the USA and\nother parts of the developed world over the past several\ndecades. Further discussion addresses recent epidemio-\nlogical evidence for meat intake and chronic disease risk,\nand impending public health concerns.\nMethods\nWe used publicly accessible per capita food availability\ndata provided by the FAO(24) and the US Department of\nAgriculture (USDA)(25) to compare temporal trends in\nmeat consumption in the USA and other developed\ncountries (defined by the FAO as Japan in Asia, Canada\nand the USA in North America, Australia and New Zealand\nin Oceania, and all of Europe). FAO and USDA databases\nprovide historical and chronological population-based\nproduction and disappearance data (referred to as food\navailability or consumption). We compared temporal\ntrends in the US meat disappearance data to dietary intake\ndata collected at the individual level from the National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES)(26).\nFAO\nFAOSTAT(24) is the world's largest online agricultural\ndatabase (available at http://faostat.fao.org/) with data\nfrom 190 FAO member countries. FAO compiles supply\nand disappearance data submitted by member countries\nin response to standard questionnaires, supplemented\nwith reviews of national sources and staff estimates or\nimputations to cover critical gaps(5). The FAO classifies\ntotal meat (excluding fish) as the sum of beef, poultry,\npork, sheep, goat and other game. Per capita meat con-\nsumption (g/d), defined as the total amount of the com-\nmodity available for human consumption (i.e. after exports,\nand other waste from farm to household), was available\nresulting in changes in the historical data. The methodology\nfor the estimation of food balance sheets was also revised\nin FAOSTAT, including new aggregation techniques for\nthe conversion of transformed commodities (processed\nand semi-processed) into primary equivalents (i.e. fresh\nmeat, excluding offal and fat)(24).\nUS Department of Agriculture\nTo look at US meat consumption and trends in more\ndetail, we referenced food availability data (also known\nas US Food Supply Data or Disappearance Data) from the\nUSDA Economic Research Service (ERS) and accessible at\nhttp://www.ers.usda.gov/Data/Foodconsumption(25). The\nERS food data system reflects food availability per capita\nlevel and serves as a popular proxy for actual consump-\ntion. These data represent the boneless, trimmed (edible)\nweight of fresh meat. Loss-adjusted data (removal of\nnon-edible food parts and food lost through spoilage,\nplate waste and other losses in the home and marketing\nsystem) were only available beginning from 1970. Red\nmeat commodities included beef, veal, pork, lamb and\nmutton. Poultry commodities included turkey and\nchicken. Fish and shellfish included fresh and frozen,\ncanned and cured products. Figures were calculated on\nthe basis of raw and edible meats, which exclude edible\noffal, bones and viscera for red meat and fishery products,\nbut included skin, neck and giblets for poultry(25). The\nUSDA per capita data, provided in lb/year, were con-\ncomparison with other data sources.\nNational Health and Nutrition\nExamination Surveys\npeople). NHANES is a cross-sectional national survey\nconducted by the National Center for Health Statistics of\nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The\ndietary portion was designed to provide nationally\nrepresentative estimates of food intake in adults and\nchildren (civilian, non-institutionalized population), and\nto track changes in health and nutritional status over time.\nA single 24 h dietary recall from all respondents aged\n2 years and older with reliable dietary data was included\nand appropriate weighting factors were applied to adjust\nfor differential probabilities of selection and non-response.\nAdditional information on the survey designs, data collec-\ntion protocols, weighting procedures and response rates\nis given elsewhere(26).\nTo estimate meat intake we merged the NHANES data\nwith the appropriate MyPyramid Equivalents Database\n(MPED). A new version of the MPED is developed for\neach NHANES data release; thus, MPED 1?0(27) was\nUSDA Survey Foods translates the amounts of foods\neaten in USDA's What We Eat in America survey, the\ndietary intake component of NHANES, into the number of\nequivalents for the thirty-two MyPyramid major food\ngroups and subgroups(28).

Allowable fat in the\nmeat group includes that present in lean cuts of meat\ntrimmed of all fat and poultry without skin. Cooked lean\nmeat ounce equivalents (servings) were defined as no\nwith the remainder classified as discretionary fat(28). MPED\nestimates were converted to g/d (28 g/oz).

The poultry\ngroup consisted mainly of chicken and turkey. Total fish\nwas the sum of fish both high and low in n-3 fatty acids\nplus shellfish. To generate a total red meat variable, we\nincluded red meat (beef, pork, veal, lamb, game), as well as\nthe appropriate components of processed meat and organ\nmeats, based on the recipe files for each of the food items\nin these food categories. Similarly, a total white meat vari-\nable was generated from poultry and processed or organ\ncomponents from each of these groups. Total meat was the\nsum of fresh (not processed) red and white meat, plus\ncured meat, such as bacon and ham, as well as organ meats\nand fish. Soya products were excluded. Processed meat,\nby MPED definition(28), included frankfurters, sausage and\nluncheon meats (made from meat or poultry), but did not\ninclude cured meats, such as ham or bacon.\nWe used SUDAAN (Research Triangle Institute (RTI)\nInternational, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA) to gen-\nerate weighted means (sampling weights provided by\nNHANES)(26) and standard errors for each meat item (red\nmeat, poultry, fish and processed meat; g/d). We addi-\ntionally examined meat intake stratified by gender, age\ngroup, ethnicity and education level. Using a Bonferroni\ncorrection to adjust for multiple comparisons, a two-sided\nP , 0?0005 was considered statistically significant for any\nsingle pair-wise comparison.\nResults\nTemporal trends in meat consumption in\ndeveloped countries\nAccording to the international FAO data, total meat con-\nsumption (excluding fish) in the USA, European Union (EU)\nand the developed world as a whole has increased relatively\nas 1961, total meat consumption in the USA was nearly\ndouble that of the EU and the developed world as a whole.\nto increase in all regions: nearly doubling in the EU and\nincreasing approximately 1?5-fold in the USA. Overall, meat\nconsumption appears to be on the rise in the developed\nworld as whole, but remains considerably lower than in\nthe USA.\nLooking in more detail at meat consumption in the\nUSA, USDA data indicate that total meat consumption has\nincreased notably over the past century, nearly doubling\nsumption occurred in the 1930s and the highest meat\nconsumption was reached during the most recent decade.\nFurther examination attributes much of the increase to\na rise in poultry consumption beginning in the 1950s\nthrough recent decades to make up a high proportion\nof the total meat consumed in the USA. Red meat\nconsumption appears to have decreased over the past\nfew decades beginning in the 1980s, but still remains\nthe highest contributor to the total meat consumed. In\ncontrast, fish consumption has remained low and stable\nover the past century.\nThe same data adjusted for loss, but only available from\n1970, are comparable to the trends shown in Fig. 2 with\na marked increase in poultry consumption, a slight\ndecrease in red meat consumption and an overall trend\nfor increasing meat consumption. For the period 1970\u00ad\nto 85 g/d, while per capita poultry consumption more\nthan doubled from 25 to 55 g/d (loss-adjusted data not\nshown).

Processed meat intake constituted 22 % of the\ntotal meat consumed from either red meat or poultry\ncategories. Women consumed a slightly higher propor-\ntion of poultry than men (34 % and 30 %, respectively), a\nlower proportion of red meat (55 % and 60 %, respec-\ntively) and nearly equal proportions of processed meat\n(data not shown).\nTable 1 describes US meat intake from NHANES\nlevel. In this nationally representative sample, total meat\nintake averaged 128 g/d (sum of red meat, poultry and\nfish).

Despite\na shift towards increased poultry consumption, red meat\nstill represents the largest proportion of meat consumed\nin the USA and nearly a quarter of the meat consumed is\nprocessed. Meat selection and consumption behaviours\nappeared to vary by education, race, age and gender.\nDespite the near record-high per capita consumption of\ntotal meat in recent years, the proportion of fat, particularly\nsaturated fat, in the US food supply from meat, poultry and\nfish has slowly declined(3). Public health and consumer\nconcerns regarding fat and cholesterol in the late 1980s\nled to greater demand for lean meat and poultry, increased\ntrimming of visible fat on meat at the retail level and con-\nsumer substitution of poultry for red meat(3,29). Reports on\nfat consumption trends in the USA have shown a marked\nreduction in the proportion of fat from foods identified as\nmajor sources of saturated fat, including red meat (pork and\nbeef) over the past several decades(30,31).\nPrevious reports have shown that the consumer's\nknowledge and awareness of diet and health may affect\nthe proportion of red v. white meat consumed both at\nhome and away from home(32). Chronological USDA data\nsuggest that although poultry consumption has increased,\nred meat consumption has decreased comparably little,\nleaving total meat consumption on the rise. Both loss-\nadjusted USDA data and intake values in NHANES suggest\nthat current total meat intake for adults in the USA ranges\ncoming from red meat. The affordability of meat in the\nUSA, combined with rising consumer incomes, may\nexplain this trend. While vertical integration in US poultry\nproduction resulted in a large, low-cost supply of poultry,\nthe USA remains the world's largest beef producer and\nexporter, as well as a leading beef importer(3,33). During\nleading source of energy in US adults; and the primary\nsource of both protein and total fat(34). Meat consump-\ntion, production and trade flows are also subject to\ntemporary fluctuations due to food safety issues.

Although at a\nnational level the demand for meat would be expected\nto increase with economic growth, individual intake has\nTable 1 Meat intake in the USA according to demographic factors, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2003\u00ad2004\nMeat intake (g/d)*\nRed meat Poultry Fish Total meat Processed\nFactors n Mean SE Mean SE Mean SE Mean SE Mean SE\nGender\nAge (years)\nRace\nEducation\n*Cooked lean meat ounce-equivalents (MPED 2?0) converted to grams.\nMeat consumption in the USA 579\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

Lower meat intake,\nparticularly red and processed meat, with increasing adult\nage and education may reflect heightened awareness\nof health and/or adoption of dietary practices for the\nprevention or management of chronic disease.\nPossible health implications of meat consumption\nMeat in the diet provides an important source of protein\nand micronutrients, such as iron, zinc and vitamin B(38).\nHowever, energy-dense diets, purported to be high in\nmeat, fats and sugars, and further compounded by seden-\ntary lifestyle, have been implicated in the growing epi-\ndemics of obesity and diet-related chronic diseases(20,39).\nEvidence suggests that vegetarians may be at lower risk\nfor CVD, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity and some\ncancers(40\u00ad44). However, low-fat/high-carbohydrate diets\nhave not been wholly positive or successful in reducing the\nburden of chronic disease within the general popula-\ntion(45\u00ad47); and lean meat and fish continue to be part of the\nrecommendations for a balanced, healthy diet(13,48).\nInflammation and oxidative stress have also been\nlinked to the intake of meat and disease risk. Red meat,\npossibly due to its fat and iron content, may increase\ninflammation and oxidative stress, but less is known\nregarding lean and white meats(41,49). Conversely, the\nintake of fish has been shown to decrease markers of\ninflammation and oxidative stress(50,51). Meat cooking\n(high temperature, charring) and processing techniques,\nsuch as smoking, curing, salting or the addition of che-\nmical preservatives, lead to the formation of carcinogenic\nto NOC occurs from both endogenous formation, which is\ndirectly related to red meat intake(54), as well as exogenous\nexposure from nitrite-preserved meats(55). Nitrate, which\ncan be reduced to nitrite and contribute to NOC forma-\ntion, is also present in non-meat sources, such as vege-\ntables and fruits(56); however, red meat is a key source of\nreadily available haem iron, which may further increase\nendogenous NOC formation(57). HCA and PAH, which are\nformed during high-temperature cooking of meat(58),\ndose-dependently generate DNA adducts(59).\nThe most robust human evidence is for red and pro-\ndate, there appears to be little or no association for meat\nintake and breast cancer(65\u00ad69), while findings for other\nmajor cancers such as prostate, lung, kidney and pancreatic\ncancer are less conclusive(70\u00ad73). In a comprehensive\nmen and women, a significant increased risk of incident\ncancers of the colorectum, oesophagus, lung and liver was\nassociated with red meat and increased risk of colorectal\nand lung cancer was associated with higher intake of pro-\ncessed meat(17); red and processed meat intake was also\nassociated with all-cause, CVD and cancer mortality, while\nhigher intake of white meat was associated with lower risk\nof death(74). The relationship between meat intake and\ncancer risk is not wholly consistent and the complex\nmechanisms involved continue to warrant further investi-\ngation. Current epidemiological research suggests that\nmoderate meat intake may not increase risk(75) and that\nendogenous and exogenous mutagens formed during meat\nStrengths and limitations\nResults presented herein should be viewed with caution\nand the limitations of food supply/disappearance and\ncross-sectional data clearly acknowledged. There are a\nnumber of disadvantages to using food availability data,\neven though it is important for international comparisons\nas well as for looking at the overall, historic trends. Meat\nconsumption data presented here are primarily based on\nannual food availability per capita at the national level\nand serve as popular proxies for actual consumption. The\nFAO derives their values from data submitted by member\ncountries and are therefore limited by the completeness\nand accuracy of reporting at the national level.\nIt is important to recognise that while each data source\nappears to tell a similar story of US meat consumption\ntrends, USDA food availability and NHANES individual\nintake data serve different objectives(30). The US food\navailability and consumption data measure the flow of raw\nand semi-processed agricultural commodities throughout\nthe US marketing system at an aggregate level(78). For both\nFAO and USDA food consumption data, human food intake\nis not directly measured and losses from trimming, cooking,\nwaste and spoilage are not fully estimable despite use of\nconversion factors that attempt to adjust for probable los-\nses; this appeared to result in as much as a 100g difference\nbetween current adjusted (150 g/d) and unadjusted USDA\nvalues (250 g/d). Individual-level intake data, such as those\ncollected in NHANES from individual sample respondents,\nmeasure only edible and reportedly consumed foods from\na designated period or point in time. In a large sample,\nsuch as NHANES, a single 24h dietary recall should provide\na valid estimate of total meat intake at a population level\nand should also be adequate to capture relative con-\nsumption of different types of meat(79,80). The NHANES\npopulation itself presents a number of advantages for\nstudying current US meat intake. The NHANES sampling\naims to capture the diversity, as well as regional variation in\nthe US population. Younger age groups and minority popu-\nlations sampled in NHANES are often under-represented\nin most large epidemiological and US prospective studies.\nIn addition, most prospective cohorts in the USA and\nbaseline level of intake, which USDA and NHANES data\nsuggest may be considerably lower than the current US\nintake. Thus, comparably modest associations with meat in\ncohort populations may or may not translate to the broader\nUS population, which national estimates suggest may be at\ndifferential, if not greater, risk in the near future.\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

Unfortunately, the lag in the development\nand linkage of the MPED, the USDA's food group data-\nbase, limits our ability to present NHANES meat intake\nsource in our analysis that shed light on processed meat\nintake and although it appears to make up a high pro-\nportion of the total meat currently consumed, we are\nunable to track long-term changes in its availability and\nconsumption. USDA and FAO tracking methods, by nature,\ndo not allow for historical trend data on meat that has\nundergone processing, which may be derived from both\nfresh red meat and poultry. Due to emerging epidemio-\nlogical evidence on the risks of various cancers associated\nwith high processed meat intake, recommendations to\nreduce consumption of processed meat are relatively\nnew compared to those for red meat. In addition, there is\nno generally agreed upon definition of processed meat,\nmaking it difficult to define and target in both public\nhealth research and practice.\nConclusion\nUnderstanding the trends and determinants of meat\nconsumption in the USA, where meat is consumed at\nmore than three times the global average(5), should be\nparticularly pertinent to researchers and other public\nhealth professionals aiming to reduce the global burden\nof chronic disease. While saturated fat intake appears to\nbe declining(3,29\u00ad31), other components of red and pro-\ncessed meat continue to pose a health risk, particularly\nrecommendations for meat should perhaps begin to\nincrease awareness regarding potentially harmful cooking\nand processing methods(14,53). Studying food consump-\ntion and selection behaviours sheds light on the barriers\nwe continue to face with the food industry and con-\nsumers, as well as international foresight into future\nepidemics and their causes. As the main determinant of\nper capita meat consumption across the world appears to\nbe wealth, examining trends in the USA and the rest of the\ndeveloped world may forecast the global public health\nand environmental burdens we should expect to face in\nthe highly populated developing world(4). The growing\npreference in the USA for poultry, but not fish, as a\nreplacement for red meat suggests the need for more\nepidemiological investigations of white meat and its\nrelationship with long-term health and disease outcomes.\n"
