Findings suggest that, rather than replicating the behavior\nof their parents and experiencing the same financial struggles, the youths interviewed were motivated by a desire to avoid\nthese challenges. However, youths in this study also noted that they experienced social and economic barriers that their\nhigher income peers did not. Policy, practice, and research implications of these findings are discussed.\n",

In the past\n15 years, financial education and Individual Development\nAccount (IDA) programs have been implemented to teach\nadults and youth about savings and investments and to link\nthem with the mainstream financial sector (Shobe & Sturm,\n2007). However, the majority of research in the area of IDA\nprogramming has been conducted with adults.\nLimited available research on youth suggests that high\nschool financial education is associated with improved\nfinancial decision making (Bernheim, Garrett, & Maki,\n2001), whereas other data indicate that financial behavior\nand decision making are more directly influenced by one's\nfamily of origin than by one's formal financial education\n(Shim, Barber, Card, Xiao, & Serido, 2010). Youth savings\nrates, for example, are often closely related to their parents'\nsavings behaviors (Chiteji & Stafford, 1999). Because the\navailable literature is largely focused on outcomes, it is dif-\nficult to understand the reasons for these competing find-\nings. This study seeks to fill this gap by exploring the\nperspectives of youth themselves and the important\nrelationships between financial education, family environ-\nment, and financial behavior.\nLiterature Review\nFinancial Literacy and Financial Education\nAlthough limited, current findings suggest that youth finan-\ncial education can have positive effects on long- and short-\nterm measures (Masa et al., 2010). For example, a recent\nqualitative study exploring the perception of participants\nin a child savings program (Elliott, Sherraden, Johnson,\n& Guo, 2009) indicated that children who saved in the\nprogram perceived \"that savings is a way to help pay for\ncollege\" (p. 1). In the short term, Masa et al. (2010) con-\nducted a review of current literature on the associations\nbetween youth savings and well-being and found significant\nrelationships between youth savings and increased\n(a) savings, income, and the development of other assets;\n(b) self-esteem and social group participation; (c) reproduc-\ntive and sexual health knowledge; (d) safe-sex behavior;\nand (e) educational achievement.\n1Juniata College, Huntingdon, PA, USA\n2University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nLeah Hamilton, Department of Sociology,Anthropology, and Social Work,\nEmail: Hamilton@juniata.edu\n\"It's All About Security to Me\":The Role of\nEnvironment inYouth Financial Literacy and\nSavings Behaviors\nLeah Hamilton1, Marcia Shobe2, Yvette Murphy-Erby2, and Kameri Christy2\n Keywords\nyouth, savings, financial literacy, financial behavior, ecological systems\n2 SAGE Open\nGiven these potential benefits, efforts to increase youth\nsavings and financial literacy are well placed. Nonetheless,\nresearch on the effects of financial education curricula for\nyouth is inconsistent (see McCormick, 2009). Positive\nresults include those of Bernheim et al. (2001), whose study\nbased on survey data collected by telephone from 2,000\nyoung adults found a positive relationship between financial\neducation training for youth during state-mandated compul-\nhood. In an effort to expand upon this research, Cole and\nShastry (2008) used a representative national sample from\nthe 2000 Public Use Census Data to examine the relationship\nbetween financial education and later financial market par-\nticipation. Their findings suggested that youth financial edu-\ncation programs were not associated with financial market\ndecisions for either attendees or their children; rather, the\nfindings suggest that these programs are both costly and\nineffective. Instead, they found that increased financial mar-\nket participation was related to increased educational\nachievement and cognitive ability (e.g., higher test scores).\nIn terms of financial knowledge retention, two different\nstudies surveyed high school seniors and full-time college\nundergraduates who had participated in a high school money\nmanagement or personal finance course; neither study found\nparticipants to have more financial knowledge than those\nwho did not participate in a course (Mandell, 2009; Mandell\nrecent nonrandomized study on the use of a Googolplex@\nschool middle school pilot financial education project that\nstudents in lower grades gain financial knowledge from fun,\ninteractive financial literacy education.\nFamily of Origin\nDisparate outcome data may be attributable to the lack of\nnational standards, the absence of a set curriculum for finan-\ncial education (McCormick, 2009), or environmental factors\noutside the classroom. Recent scholarship suggests that par-\nent attitudes, behaviors, and role modeling play a much\nlarger role than financial education curricula in shaping their\nchildren's financial knowledge and behaviors. For example,\nusing a survey with 2,098 college students, researchers\nfound that those who received financial education in high\nschool had higher levels of financial knowledge, but the\nmost important predictor of student financial behavior was\nparent financial behavior (Shim et al., 2010). In addition,\nresearchers using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics\n(PSID) found that bank account and stock ownership for a\nparental account ownership (Chiteji & Stafford, 1999).\nFurthermore, Chiteji and Stafford (2000) also found that\nchildren's exposure to family asset development helps explain\nfuture financial knowledge and asset development for later\ngenerations. The authors used the term parental learning\neffect to describe the fundamental knowledge children\nacquire from their parents regarding wealth accumulation.\nIn a qualitative study that explored past and current savings\nexperiences of a small sample (N = 10) of adult African\nAmerican women, findings suggested that, for the majority\nof women, parental role modeling and education regarding\nsavings played an integral role in their decision to save and\nthe manner in which they saved as a child, youth, and adult\nStill, minimal research has been conducted on the role of\nlow-income parents in shaping financial knowledge and\ndecision making for their children (Chiteji & Stafford, 1999).\nFurthermore, researchers have not fully examined the ways\nin which youth learn about and replicate their families'\nbehaviors related to financial decision making and savings.\nAs stated by Shim et al. (2010), \"although we do know that\nparents are the primary socialization agents in the process by\nwhich children learn how to function in the marketplace as\nconsumers and money managers, we have not clearly defined\nthe specific roles that parents play\" (p. 1458).\nCurrent Study\nFrom an ecological systems perspective (Germain &\nbehaviors of youth and young adults are best understood\nwithin the context of their environments. Bronfenbrenner\n(1979) depicted human growth and development as an\ninteractional and nested process between multiple levels of\nenvironment, including the self and one's immediate envi-\nronment (microsystem), larger organizations such as schools\n(mesosystem), and broader cultural, political, and economic\nforces (macrosystem). In this view, human thought pro-\ncesses and behavior are best described as a product of these\ninteractions.\nFinancial education, then, though an amiable goal, may\nfall short of expectations if youth are not seen as part of an\ninterconnected whole. For this reason, we plan to extend\nCharles and Hurst's (2003) suggestion to examine the role\nof parent financial behavior in shaping youth financial\nknowledge, skills, and behaviors to also include the effects\non youth savings.\nThe aim of this descriptive, qualitative research project is\nto better understand the role of environment in youth finan-\ncial decision making and determine whether this may explain\npreviously mixed results on the efficacy of financial educa-\ntion. To this end, this study seeks to capture the perspectives\nand experiences of the 14 youths who participated in an IDA\nsavings program and to present the key themes and sub-\nthemes that reflect their perspectives and experiences, rela-\ntive to (a) financial decision making in the family of origin;\n(b) savings successes, challenges, and expectations in the\nfamily of origin; and (c) their perceptions of the IDA experi-\nences. We also plan to examine past and current savings\nbehaviors and future savings aspirations of the youths in this\nstudy. This study will remain descriptive in nature as we seek\nHamilton et al. 3\na deeper understanding of the personal experiences of par-\nDue to the limited availability of research in this area, it\nwas necessary to engage in a small scale, exploratory study.\nPrevious qualitative research has found this model useful.\nFor example, Shobe and Christy-McMullin (2007) used a\nsmall sample of 10 participants to explore the influence of\nparental role modeling and education in savings behavior\namong African American women.\nMethod\nBackground and Protocol\nStudents were recruited from the \"Cash for College\" IDA\nsavings program, which is sponsored by a large economic\ndevelopment nonprofit agency in northwest Arkansas. Cash\nfor College offers an 8-hr financial literacy course to high\nschool students and 4:1 matched dedicated Individual\nDevelopment Savings Accounts (IDAs). Students are\nrequired to deposit at least US$250 into their IDA accounts\nover the course of 1 year, at which point the program con-\ntributes an additional US$1,000. Funds from this program\ncan only be withdrawn for higher education expenses,\nincluding tuition, fees, books, and supplies. The program is\nopen to students whose families have annual earned incomes\nwithin 200% of the federal poverty guidelines.\nPrior to the interviews, a research proposal was submitted\nto the University of Arkansas Institutional Review Board for\napproval. Students and their parents were provided with a\nletter explaining the purpose of the study (including potential\nrisks and benefits and the voluntary nature of the study) and\nan informed consent form. Students aged 18 and above were\nallowed to sign consent forms themselves; however, minor\nstudents required written parental consent.\nIn each interview, the researchers explained that some\nquestions were of a sensitive and personal nature. Each par-\nticipant was given the option to skip any question he or she\nwished. All participants were given US$25 following the\ninterview. This amount was chosen so as to show gratitude\nfor the participants' time without being coercive (Berg,\n2008). Participant names were replaced with a code number\nand no identifying information was associated with tran-\nscripts or interview notes.\nThe audio-recorded interviews lasted between 30 min\nand 1.5 hr and were later transcribed. The interview guide\nincluded open-ended questions grouped in four main areas.\nThe first area included questions to capture demographics\nrelative to the child such as his or her race/ethnicity, age,\ngender, housing composition, primary caregiver, employ-\nment status, and whether they have a savings or checking\naccount other than the IDA and the child's account of demo-\ngraphics relative to his or her family (parent's employment\nstatus, family's income and type of employment held by\nparents). The second group of questions explored the child's\nperspectives of his or her family's economic situation and\nfinancial behaviors. For example, who makes financial\ndecision in the family, how does the family manage fiscally,\nthe saving and financial patters and behaviors the child per-\nceives within his or her family (e.g., spending and savings\npatterns, what does the family save for, what does the family\nspend on, how does the family make decisions about sav-\nings and spending; what rules do the parents voice and what\nrules do they enforce relative to savings and spending); the\nchild's reflections of economically challenging times and\nhow the child perceived the family functioned during such\ntimes; the child's account of the parent's history of home\nownership and savings, child's account of family's social\nsupport network and resources, and child's account of mes-\nsages his or her parents give about savings and education;\nthe child's account of whether money matters are discussed\nopenly in his or her immediate family. The third group of\nquestions explored the child's perspective on his or her\nfinancial behaviors and patterns prior to joining the IDA\nprogram and since joining the idea program. For example,\nhow he or she acquired money before and post IDA, what\ndoes he or she do with the money earned, where do they\nkeep their money (e.g., bank, piggy bank, give it to parents\nto keep); the child's thoughts and feelings about money and\nsavings; future orientation relative to savings and spending\n(goals regarding home ownership, business ownership,\nasset purchases etc.); strategies they have used to work\ntoward financial goals, challenges they have encountered in\ntrying to save or achieve a financial goal, success stories\nrelative to savings and finances; and savings goals. The last\ngroup of questions explored the child's thoughts, experi-\nence, and feelings related to the IDA program. For example,\nhow they learned about the program, what interested them\nin the program, accounts of success and challenges relative\nto experiences in the program, accounts of how the program\nworks, suggestion for program improvements, accounts of\nother aspects of the program and what if anything they\ngained from the other aspects (e.g., financial literacy), per-\nceptions of why IDAs were created, and the child's percep-\ntion of the effects IDA participation could have for other\nchildren and families.\nStudy Participants\nFourteen students, ranging in age from 17 to 19 (with a mean\nage of 17 years 11 months), were interviewed regarding their\nsavings experiences, strategies, and perspectives (see Table\n1 for demographic details). Utilizing a purposive sampling\nstrategy (Berg, 2008), we derived our sample from youths\nparticipating in an IDA program in northwest Arkansas. All\nyouths who participated in the IDA program between\nFebruary and July 2010 were asked to participate in this\nstudy. Study participants included 4 males (29%) and 10\nfemales. Eight of the sample (57%) self-reported their race\nas non-Hispanic Caucasian, 4 (21%) as Asian American, 1\n4 SAGE Open\n(7%) as Latino, and 2 (14%) as biracial (in both cases,\nCaucasian and Native American).\nParticipants were also asked about family housing and\nhousehold composition. Two of the students (14%) lived\nwith their families in rental housing; the remaining 86%\nlived in owner-occupied housing. The average household\nsize for participants was four members (with a range of 2-9\nmembers), with an average of 1.5 minors living in the home\n(with a range of 0-6 children). When asked about the family\nmember who serves as their primary caregiver, five students\n(36%) reported their mother, four reported their father (28%),\none student (7%) reported both parents, one student (7%)\nreported her grandparents, and three students (21%) reported\nanother type of caregiver. Four students (29%) reported that\ntheir household was currently receiving some type of gov-\nernment support (e.g., food stamps, disability insurance,\nWomen, Infants and Children [WIC], Temporary Assistance\nto Needy Families [TANF]).\nFinally, students were asked about their personal employ-\nment and financial behavior. Two youths (14%) worked full-\ntime, nine (64%) worked part-time, and the remaining three\ndid not work. These findings may be somewhat skewed as\nsome students were interviewed during the school year, but\nseveral others were interviewed during the summer, when\nemployment practices might change. Five of the students\n(36%) had personal checking accounts, and only four (28%)\nhad a savings account outside of their IDA account.\nData Analysis\nThe data analysis involved two main phases. The first phase\nused the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS)\nsoftware to descriptively analyze the demographic informa-\ntion. Because we were interested in exploring the students'\nperceptions of their family background relative to their moti-\nvations for IDA participation, we selected thematic analysis\nfor the second and central phase of analysis. Thematic\nanalysis is common in qualitative methods as it focuses on\ncapturing the depth of central themes and allows the data to\nbe organized around such themes (Marks & Yardley, 2004).\nAll transcripts were reviewed by two members of the\nresearch team, who independently reviewed each transcript\nin search of data responses related to family background and\nmotivation for IDA participation to generate a first round of\nsubthemes relative to the two primary themes. Using a con-\nstant comparative method (Merriam, 1998), the two mem-\nbers met on several occasions to discuss and compare their\nindividual findings and to ensure research consistency.\nAnalysis of each narrative involved a sentence-by-sentence\nreview, seeking and identifying open codes (Ryan & Bernard,\n2000). During the earlier round of analysis, open coding\nidentified potential themes and short segments of text were\ncolor-coded according to their connection to the two prede-\ntermined themes (Ryan & Bernard, 2000). On the right-hand\nside of the transcript, codes or categories were written.\nDuring the later stages of analysis, axial coding was com-\npleted. This phase of the analysis involved identifying rela-\ntionships among codes and collapsing these codes into core\ncategories. Finally, selective coding occurred, in which\nbroader, more inclusive categories were formulated as sub-\nthemes of the broader themes.\nTrustworthiness\nSeveral measures have been taken in an effort to improve\nthe trustworthiness of our findings (Lincoln & Guba, 1985).\nFor instance, each participant was informed of confidential-\nity to facilitate his or her comfort in responding and to\nimprove credibility. Confidentiality was reiterated before\nyouths were asked their opinions of the program.\nFurthermore, findings were triangulated theoretically by\ncomparing our results with previous research. To expand\ntransferability and dependability, we have attempted to\ndescribe our processes in detail. Finally, two authors coded\nthe interviews separately and then compared themes in an\neffort to decrease bias and create greater confirmability\nFindings\nThis study sought to capture the key themes that emerged\nfrom the participants' accounts of financial decision making\nin their family of origin, the challenges and successes rela-\ntive to savings and the participants' experiences within the\nTable 1. Demographic Data\n% n\nGender\nRace\nPrimary caregiver\nEmployment\nFamily housing\nGovernment assistance\nHamilton et al. 5\nIDA program. The following section presents the primary\nthemes and subthemes that were revealed.\nFinancial Decision Making in the Family of Origin\nMoney is a stressful subject. Most of the youths in this study\nexpressed that money was \"stressful\" for their families and\nwas often \"difficult to come by\" or \"pretty tight.\" Families\noften had to prioritize expenses, putting mortgage/rent, utili-\nties, and auto insurance ahead of savings for the future. Many\nstudents reported that even covering basic expenses could be\ndifficult. One said, \"I can't go certain places because we\ndon't have enough gas money, and we can't buy certain\nthings like food because we don't have enough and we have\nto pay for bills.\" Speaking about her mother, another stated,\n\"If she gets behind on anything . . . [it's] probably the rent,\nbecause she wants to keep the electricity running. She can\nusually talk to the landlord.\"\nSomething unexpected is always coming up. With such tight\nbudgets, many of the youths reported that unexpected\nexpenses, such as a car repair or a life event (divorce, death\nin the family), often created a financial emergency for the\nfamily. For example, one participant said, \"When my parents\ngot divorced . . . we were low on food and clothes and we had\nto stay at my uncle's house for a while.\" Another reported,\n\"We used to have an auto care business too and because of\nthe economy . . . [it] went down, plus my brother got cancer.\"\nOther students reported that illness, death, and increases in\ngas prices had caused significant financial crises for their\nfamilies. To deal with financial emergencies, families used\nvarious coping strategies. Some families would \"go in the\nhole,\" \"tighten the budget,\" or get a \"second job.\" Several of\nthe participants reported that their families borrowed money\nfrom extended family to cover lean times.\nSavings Success, Challenges, and Expectations\nin the Family of Origin\nNo models for savings but lots of encouragement to save.\nMost of the youths reported that their families had no sav-\nings of their own, and only two families had established\nretirement accounts. Furthermore, very few students could\nthink of a time when their families spoke of saving for the\nfuture or for a specific goal. All of the youths, however,\nreported that their parents encourage them to save.\nEducation matters. Most families placed a high priority on\nhigher education, with the hope that it would culminate in\nemployment. One student, expressing a common response,\nstated, \"My mom really wants me to go to college. . . . She wants\nme to have a good job.\"Among all the youths in this study, pay-\ning for college was a financial concern for the family.\nPerception of the IDA Experience\nFinancial education. As discussed, students in this IDA pro-\ngram are also required to attend a series of financial literacy\ncourses. Prior to beginning the program, most of the youths\nhad never had any sort of financial education. Most reported\nenjoying the courses, but were primarily motivated to enter\nthe program by the availability of matching funds. One stu-\ndent said, \"I think it's very beneficial because I learned a lot\nabout things I didn't know.\" Several students reported that\nthe classes encouraged them to continue saving. When asked\nabout the overall benefit of the program, one student said,\n\"It's a good way to motivate savings.\" A few of the youths,\nhowever, wished for more hands-on learning methods.\nSaving. Most of the youths in this study had begun saving\nbefore beginning the program and intended to continue sav-\ning after meeting their US$250 goal. One reported, \"I'm\ngoing to have my own savings account.\"Another said, \"I just\nheard about monetary bonds and savings bonds. I'll look at\nthem.\" Some of the students wanted to continue saving for\ncollege, and others hoped to purchase a car with their future\nsavings. When asked, all of the students saw themselves as\nfuture homeowners.\nStill, many of the students experienced their own barriers\nto savings. Several contributed to the family in times of\nfinancial strain. A student with several younger brothers and\nsisters stated, \"For the past few months I've been helping\nout, so I haven't really had money, just to feed everyone and\nmyself. . . . But I've been trying my hardest to get a lot of\nhours . . . and try to put money away.\" Another said, \"We\nkind of all help a little bit. My sister works and helps.\"\nThe majority of students interviewed were employed and\npaying for many of their personal expenses such as car insur-\nance, food, clothing, and cell phone bills. Most reported that\nthey avoided \"unnecessary\" spending. One noted that she\ntried \"to focus on what I need and not what I want.\" Another\nstated, \"When I cash my check, I automatically save and that\nway I don't waste any because I don't have it.\" When asked\nabout their reasons for saving money, most of the youths saw\nit as security from the type of financial instability experi-\nenced in their families. One said, \"It feels really good to\nsave. It makes me feel like I have . . . peace of mind.\"Another\nsaw her savings as \"something I can use in emergency cir-\ncumstances so I'm not completely lost. I like foundation.\"\nFinally, a third student explained that saving \"means I sleep,\nreally. I become incredibly sick and stressed when I don't\nfeel secure. It's all about security to me and not worrying.\"\nDiscussion and Implications\nFamily Economic Situation\nFamily financial status. In discussing their families' finan-\ncial situations, the majority of the youths in our study noted\nthat their families were currently experiencing a great deal\nof financial difficulty. Several even commented that their\nfamilies found it difficult to meet basic expenses for\nfood, clothing, and shelter and, as a result, had to prioritize\nwhich expenses (e.g., electricity vs. rent) were more impor-\ntant. When youths provided reasons for their economic\n6 SAGE Open\ndifficulties, it became clear that an economic crisis or two\nplayed an integral role, at times, in impacting their current\nfinancial difficulties. For example, youths mentioned the\neconomic recession, resulting unemployment, gas prices,\ncar repairs, illness, divorce, and death of a loved one as\nunexpected economic crises they had experienced.\nFamily savings for future assets. Given that none of the\nheads of household in this study had money in savings, they\nengaged in several short- and long-term strategies to help\nmake ends meet. Some of the strategies they used, including\nborrowing money and going into debt, tend to create longer\nterm financial burdens; other approaches, such as taking a\nsecond job and tightening their budget, offer fewer long-\nterm difficulties.\nTurning to long-term goals, not surprisingly, youths noted\nthat their parents and caregivers would like them to go to\ncollege. However, because their families did not have sav-\nings for this purpose, other than the IDA, many saw postsec-\nondary education as a great financial concern.\nThese findings suggest that opportunities are needed for\nlow-income individuals and families to set aside funds to\naddress financial crises. Although the youths in our study\nwere participating in an IDA dedicated savings program,\ntheir parents were not. It may, therefore, be beneficial for\nparents as well as youths to participate in an asset develop-\nment program so that families can survive economic crises\nwithout getting into further debt.\nYouth Economic Situation\nFinancial literacy. The overall sentiment from participants\nwas that they enjoyed taking the financial literacy courses;\nseveral noted that this was the first time in their lives that\nthey had had access to this important information. In addi-\ntion to the attainment of financial literacy knowledge, the\nyouths also noted the intangible benefits of the economic lit-\neracy classes, including the support and encouragement they\nreceived from the instructor and each other. When asked for\nsuggestions regarding how the classes could be improved,\nseveral youths suggested adding \"hands-on\" economic liter-\nacy learning opportunities. This feedback is in keeping with\nfindings from Johnson and Sherraden (2007), who suggested\nthat, though financial education is important for young chil-\ndren and youth, \"financial capability\"--or the ability to\nreceive financial education and to participate in economic\nlife through actions and behaviors--is ideal. The authors\nsuggested that providing hands-on banking experiences for\nyouth helps them link knowledge to behaviors.\nSavings behaviors. When asked about their previous expe-\nriences with saving, the majority of participants reported that\nthey had engaged in savings behaviors prior to joining the\nIDA program. Thus, it may be that youth with savings expe-\nriences are more motivated to join an IDA program than\nother youth.\nHowever, because the youth did not all have prior savings\nexperience, it is important to interpret these findings with\ncare. IDA research has demonstrated that low- and moder-\nate-income individuals can and do save when opportunities\nare provided. Therefore, though it would be easy to conclude\nfrom this research that certain individuals have a proclivity to\nsave, this would be an erroneous assumption. What we need\nto examine in further research studies is the underlying moti-\nvating factor for savings in some individuals versus others.\nAs Sherraden (1991) pointed out, even some middle- and\nupper-income individuals choose not to engage in dedicated\nretirement savings plans, even if it is in their long-term\nfinancial best interests to do so.\nMeaning of savings. Interestingly, the emotional benefits of\nsavings appear to have a larger impact on youth than the sav-\nings themselves. In terms of what saving means to them,\nyouths noted that they wanted to avoid following in their\nparents'footsteps. Instead, they were willing to avoid unnec-\nessary spending and learn more about different forms of\nasset development (e.g., savings, home ownership, invest-\nments) so that they could achieve financial security and have\npeace of mind. These findings fit with previous research that\nsuggests that it is not the amount of the asset that has the\nhighest benefit for individuals and their families but the\nownership of the asset itself (Sherraden, 1991).\nBarriers to saving. Despite their participation in the pro-\ngram, the youths were not immune to experiencing barriers\nto saving. Given that they all resided in low-income house-\nholds, many youths reported that they often had to give their\nearnings and potential savings to help offset household costs\nrelated to food, rent, and clothing. Some youths also had\ntheir own personal expenses, including car payments and\ncell phone bills, which reduced potential savings.\nThese financial barriers to savings cannot be taken lightly,\nas youth know that if they do not contribute to the household\nexpenses, their basic needs will go unmet. Thus, the sugges-\ntion that IDAs need to be offered to both youth and adults in\nthe household is an important one. In this way, families can\nmeet their basic needs and, perhaps, save for future eco-\nnomic crises.\nClearly, the financial behavior of youth is critically inter-\ntwined with the family environment. Any well-meaning\nefforts at financial education will be thwarted if youth have\nbarriers to savings that their higher income peers do not,\nsuch as contributing to the household income and paying for\ntheir own necessities such as clothing and car insurance.\nFuture policy and programming will need to consider the\nholistic needs of low-income families, providing financial\nsupport and education for both parents and youth. Future\nresearch should investigate the effect of such multigenera-\ntional programming.\nLimitations\nWhile these results are compelling, it is important to mention\nthat they are limited by our method of sampling. Because\nwe surveyed youth who were voluntarily participating in\na savings and financial education program, a significant\nHamilton et al. 7\nself-selection effect was created (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). As\na result, saving might be more important to these students\nthan to their peers who chose not to participate in the pro-\ngram. The goal of this qualitative research is not, however, to\ncreate generalizability. We have instead attempted to create\nan in-depth description of this particular phenomenon to\nmaximize potential transferability for future research.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nBerg, B.
