The vast\nmajority of international relations studies and defense analyses assume\nthat military power is a direct product of material resources, often\nmeasured in terms of the size of a state's defense budget, military forces,\nor gross domestic product (GDP). A growing body of research,\nhowever, claims that certain non-material factors significantly affect\nThe Journal of Strategic Studies\nthe ability of states to translate their resources into fighting power. In\nparticular, recent studies suggest that democratic political institutions,\nWestern culture, high levels of human capital, and amicable civil-\nmilitary relations significantly enhance the creation of military power.\nIf this is true, then military power is not solely or even primarily\ndetermined by material resources, and the large number of theoretical\nand empirical works based on this assumption are flawed.\nNeither of these two views is entirely correct. Purely materialist\nconceptions of military power are unsound because they ignore military\neffectiveness. Some states consistently excel at turning hard assets into\nmilitary power, others display endemic weaknesses, and still others\nexhibit variations in their warfighting capabilities over time. In short, a\nstate's level of military power depends not only upon the size of its\nresource endowments, but how well it uses those resources for military\npurposes. The materialist view only takes the former into account and,\nas a result, fundamentally misrepresents military capability.\nYet, the alternative view \u00ad that military capability is, to a significant\nextent, a product of political and social factors \u00ad also suffers from a\nmajor shortcoming. In particular, every study in this body of scholar-\nship overlooks the most crucial ingredient of military power: economic\ndevelopment. This omission is especially troubling because Western\ndemocracies with high levels of human capital and low levels of civil-\nmilitary frictions also rank among the most economically developed\nstates in the world. It is entirely plausible, therefore, that the\ncorrelations found between these political and social factors and\nmilitary effectiveness are spurious.\nThe major empirical finding of this article suggests that this is indeed\nstates with higher levels of economic development consistently\noutfought less developed opponents. This is not surprising. What is\nsurprising is that many of the political and social factors posited to\naffect military capability either seem to be irrelevant or have the\nopposite effect of that found in previous studies: when economic\ndevelopment is taken into account, culture and human capital become\ninsignificant and democracy actually degrades warfighting capability.\nIn short, the conventional military dominance of Western democracies\nstems primarily from superior levels of economic development, not\nsocietal pathologies or political institutions.\nThis finding qualifies both of the major views of military power. For\nthe traditional materialist view, this article suggests that a country's\ndegree of development \u00ad not just the size of its economy, defense\nbudget, or military \u00ad is an important ingredient for military success. In\nother words, military power is a function of both quantity and quality;\nstates of comparable size may still differ in their level of military power\nbecause economically developed states field more effective forces. For\nthe alternative view, these findings suggest that military power is rooted\nin a state's economy rather than its political institutions, culture, or\neducation system. While economic development may not be the only\ndeterminant of military effectiveness, it seems to be the primary\ndeterminant. Therefore, a conception of military power that accounts\nfor both the quantity of a state's resources and its level of economic\ndevelopment provides a sound basis for defense planning and\ninternational relations scholarship.\nFor the study of international relations, few topics could be more\nfundamental. Military power is widely considered to be the most\nimportant variable in international relations because it functions as a\ndecisive arbiter of disputes when it is used, and shapes relationships\namong states even when it is not. Empirical studies have found that\nmilitary power influences patterns of international cooperation, trade\npolicy, economic development, identity construction, and, of course,\nwar causation and termination. Moreover, much of international\nrelations theory essentially boils down to a debate about the extent to\nwhich military power affects state behavior. Yet few academics have\nattempted to develop a sound conception of military power or to\nrigorously explore its determinants. Without such an analysis, the study\nof international relations lacks a foundation upon which to base\nbroader theoretical and empirical claims. This article seeks to provide\nsuch a foundation.\nUnderstanding what makes some countries more militarily powerful\nthan others is also important for prudent policymaking. Take, for\nexample, the security implications of China's rapid economic develop-\nment. If economic development is the key ingredient for an effective\nmilitary, then the growth of China's economy is synonymous with the\nexpansion of its military potential. But if China's authoritarian political\ninstitutions or non-Western culture systematically undermine its ability\nto turn resources into military power, then the security threat posed by\nits economic rise may be less menacing than many people assume. Since\nvital decisions regarding grand strategy, alliance commitments, threat\nassessment, military doctrine, budget allocation, and the use of force\nare based on such determinations, the study of military power deserves\nthe most incisive and rigorous research that modern scholarship can\nprovide.\nMost importantly, accurate military assessments help prevent foolish\nwars. Wars are fought over a variety of issues, but most share a\nfundamental cause: false optimism.1 Disputes escalate to wars when\nboth sides believe they can use force to accomplish political objectives\n1Geoffrey Blainey, The Causes of War, 3rd ed. (New York: Free Press 1988), Ch.3.\nEconomic Development and Military Effectiveness 45\nat acceptable costs, or in other words, when both sides think they can\nwin. Of course, few wars in history have been win-win affairs, meaning\nthat at least one side in just about every war \u00ad and very often both\nsides \u00ad underestimated the strength of the enemy and ended up paying\nan excessive price in blood and treasure as a result. In short, erroneous\nestimates of military power cause wars, therefore accurately con-\nceptualizing and measuring military power increases the likelihood of\npeace.\nThis paper proceeds in four sections. The first section reviews the\nliterature on the determinants of military power. The second section\noutlines a theory relating economic development to military effective-\nness and derives several testable hypotheses. The third section tests\nthese hypotheses and finds that economic development best explains\nmilitary outcomes. The fourth section discusses the implications of\nthese findings.\nThe Study of Military Power\nThe existing literature offers two main answers to the central question\nof this article: why are some states more militarily powerful than\nothers? The first and most prevalent hypothesis is that military power is\na direct function of material resources. Many of the classic realist texts,\nfor example, consider the relative quantity of material resources \u00ad\ntroops, defense expenditures, GDP, population, industrial base \u00ad to be\nthe main determinant of state behavior.2 Liberals and constructivists\noften conceptualize military power in material terms when refuting its\ncausal significance.3 And the most widely used measure of military\ncapability in quantitative studies \u00ad the Composite Indicator of National\nCapability \u00ad is an index of six material variables: military expenditure,\nmilitary personnel, energy consumption, iron and steel production,\nurban population, and total population.4 Quite simply, a large chunk\nMorgenthau, Politics among Nations: The Struggle for Power and Peace, 4th ed.\n(New York: Random House 1979); John J.

Singer, `Reconstructing the Correlates of War Dataset on Material\nof international relations scholarship rests on the assumption that\nmaterial indicators provide accurate proxies for military power.\nMaterialist conceptions of military power also dominate policy\nanalyses and military operations research in the US Department of\nDefense and in many other Western governments.5 Mathematical\nmodels and computer simulations of combat draw heavily on\ntechnological and numerical indicators of military power, while placing\nmuch less emphasis on intangible factors, such as leadership and force\nemployment, and ignoring political and social variables altogether.6\nMilitary units are assessed by means of head-to-head numerical force\ncomparisons, and the most common rule of thumb in defense analyses\nis that successful attack requires at least a 3:1 local superiority of troops\nor a 1.5:1 theater-wide advantage.7 While a plethora of sophisticated\nindicators \u00ad such as force densities, attrition coefficients, and `firepower\nscores' \u00ad have been employed, the vast majority are essentially measures\nof material assets, either in terms of manpower or firepower.\nOther studies, however, have shown persuasively that these material\nindicators fail to predict or explain actual combat outcomes. In\nnumerous wars and individual battles, sides with fewer resources have\noutfought and defeated materially preponderant enemies. Prior to the\n1991 Gulf War, military analysts employed the best available net\nassessment methods to predict casualty ratios, but the best over-\nestimated American losses by a factor of three; the next best was off by\na factor of six; and the majority were off by more than an order of\nmagnitude.8 These types of failures motivate an alternative conception\n5Edmund Dubois, Wayne Hughes and Lawrence Lowe, A Concise Theory of Combat\n(Monterey, CA: US Naval Postgraduate School 1998), Ch.1.\n6Risa A.

Dupuy stressed the role of less\ntangible factors, such as morale, leadership, and training, in his\ninfluential models and writings on military power.10 And political\nscience studies find that strategy, doctrine, and tactical force employ-\nment have decisive effects on combat outcomes.11\nThe key point made by all of these studies is that the manner in which\nmilitary force is employed mediates the relationship between material\nstrength and military power. Simplistic `bean counts' of weapons and\ntroops are poor measures of modern military capability. More\nfundamental to such assessments are the quality of equipment, the\nskill of the soldiers, and the degree and efficiency of organization. A\nstate's military power, therefore, is a function of two things: its stock of\nmaterial resources and how well it can translate those resources into\nforce, a capability often referred to as `military effectiveness'. Military\neffectiveness thus provides the crucial link between materiel and\nmilitary power, between what a state's resources suggest it could do\nand what it actually can do in war.\nThis point about effectiveness is not inherently incompatible with the\ntraditional materialist view. For example, when realists refer to states\nas billiard balls or `like-units', they imply that different countries tend\nto generate the same amount of military power from a given level of\nresources. Over time, according to this logic, the pressures exerted by\nthe anarchical international system demonstrate what forms of\n9Stephen Biddle, Military Power: Explaining Victory and Defeat in Modern Battle\n10See, for example, Col.

Thus, traditional concep-\ntions of military power do not necessarily ignore effectiveness, they just\ndo not assign it a causal role independent from material resources.\nRecent studies, however, suggest that a host of political and social\nfactors may systematically degrade or enhance a state's military\neffectiveness, thereby causing some wealthy states to squander their\nresources, while allowing some poor states to generate inordinate\namounts of force.13 Material factors may represent a state's potential\nlevel of military power, but non-material factors significantly affect its\nactual level of military power. It follows from this view that the largest\nor wealthiest states, or even the states with the highest defense budgets,\ndo not necessarily possess the most military might.\nTo date, this research has focused on four variables \u00ad regime-type,\nculture, civil-military relations, and human capital \u00ad though other\nfactors such as ethnic divisions and international relationships have\nalso received attention. Concerning regime-type, Dan Reiter and Allan\nC. Stam find that democracies win more battles than non-democracies\nand explain these results by producing statistical evidence linking\ndemocratic political institutions to superior leadership and initiative on\nOther scholars claim that culture shapes military performance, either\nbecause armies reflect the norms and structures of their societies, or\nbecause efforts taken to divorce militaries from their societies have\nconsequences for the amount of usable military power available to the\nstate. For example, Ruth Benedict linked the ferocious, suicidal\ndefenses of Japan during World War II to Japanese concepts of\nhonor and shame.15 More recently, Kenneth Pollack argued that Arab\ncultural pathologies explain Arab militaries' poor tactical initiative,\nweak combined arms practices, intelligence failures, inability to\nperform tactical maneuvers, and systematic displays of individual\nbravery.16 This finding is partially supported by Stephen Biddle and\nStephen Long's quantitative analysis, in which the authors find that\n13For a summary, see, Brooks, `The Impact of Culture, Society, Institutions, and\nInternational Forces on Military Effectiveness'.\n14Dan Reiter and Allan C. Stam, Democracies at War (Princeton UP 2002), Ch.3.\n15Ruth Benedict, The Chrysanthenum and the Sword: Patterns of Japanese Culture\n16Kenneth M. Pollack, `The Influence of Arab Culture on Arab Military Effectiveness',\nEconomic Development and Military Effectiveness 49\nstates with Muslim and Buddhist cultures perform poorly in battles\nagainst Western adversaries.17\nSeveral studies suggest that the nature of a state's civil-military\nrelations has decisive impacts on the amount of military power it can\nproduce. In countries in which civil-military relations are rancorous\nand combative, civilian leaders may adopt self-defensive measures that\npurposefully undermine the military's unity and proficiency. Such\ninterventions include purges of the officer corps and promotion of\nofficers on the basis of loyalty rather than merit, suppression of\ncommunications, isolation from foreign sources of expertise or\ntraining, and encouragement of divisions within and among different\nservices. These policies may help insulate the regime from military\ncoups, but they systematically reduce the will and capacity of soldiers\nto pursue apolitical military proficiency.18\nThe final non-material determinant of military effectiveness to\nreceive scholarly attention is human capital. Stephen Biddle and\nStephen Long hypothesize that better-educated soldiers may be more\nreceptive to training, more adept at operating and maintaining\nsophisticated machinery, and more capable of executing tactical\nmaneuvers on the battlefield. In support of this hypothesis, the authors\nfind that developed states with high levels of primary and secondary\neducation outperform less educated enemies on the battlefield.\nTaken together, these studies suggest that Western democratic states\nwith low levels of civil-military friction, and high levels of human\ncapital, should be soldier-for-soldier, dollar-for-dollar more militarily\npowerful than states that lack these characteristics. The potential\nimplications of these findings are immense, not only for the study of\nmilitary power, but for the entire field of international relations: if\npolitical and social factors decisively shape the creation of military\npower, then the large number of academic theories and policy\nassessments based on materialist conceptions of military power may\nbe seriously flawed. According to Stephen Biddle, `an enormous\nscholarly edifice thus rests on very shaky foundations' because `the\nstandard measures of military capability at the heart of all this are\nactually no better than coin flips at predicting real military outcomes'.19\n17Stephen Biddle and Stephen Long, `Democracy and Military Effectiveness: A Deeper\n18Stephen Biddle and Robert Zirkle, `Technology, Civil-Military Relations, and\nWarfare in the Developing World,' Journal of Strategic Studies 19/2 (June 1996),\n171\u00ad212; Risa A. Brooks, Political-Military Relations and the Stability of Arab\nRegimes (London: International Institute for Strategic Studies 1998).\nThese recent studies have made major contributions by highlighting\nthe importance of military effectiveness and by providing several\npotential explanations of why some states, at some times, fight better\nthan others. The literature, however, still suffers from three short-\ncomings.\nFirst, there is no comprehensive theory that can explain and\npredict the military effectiveness, and therefore the military power,\nof particular states. A review of the literature suggests that Western\ndemocracies with educated populations and low levels of internal\nconflict should fight particularly well, but few countries possess all of\nthese attributes or lack them entirely. Instead most states, including\nmany of the major powers today (e.g. Russia, Japan, China, India,\nBrazil) fall somewhere in-between these two extremes, possessing\nsome but not all of the ostensible ingredients for military success. In\norder to develop our understanding of military power, therefore, we\nneed to know not only which factors matter, but how much each\none matters in relation to others. In general, the existing literature\nhas succeeded in the first of these tasks, but has come up short with\nrespect to the latter: only one of the studies discussed above (Biddle\nand Long 2004) tests multiple factors together across a large number\nof cases.\nSecond, the relationship between materiel and military power has not\nbeen properly tested. Some scholars have attempted to discredit\nmaterialist conceptions of military power by examining war and\nbattlefield outcomes. The battlefield analyses to date, however, have\nbeen biased against material hypotheses, and war outcomes cannot be\nused to assess military power in the first place.\nConcerning war outcomes, several scholars have pointed out that the\nmaterially weaker side has won about half of all wars in the modern\nera.20 This fact, however, only highlights that wars are political events\nnot solely determined by military power, not that military power has a\nnon-material basis. When wars break out, the belligerents tend to be\nclosely matched in some combination of capability and resolve because\nfactors that systematically increase the likelihood of victory for one side\nmake war less likely in the first place.21 In other words, there is a\nnatural overrepresentation of wars in which one side's material\nsuperiority is mitigated by the other side's superiority in resolve. Thus\nwe should not be surprised when material factors `perform no better\n20Biddle, Military Power, 21\u00ad4; Arreguin-Toft, How the Weak Win Wars, Ch.1; Steven\nRosen, `War Power and the Willingness to Suffer', in Bruce Russett (ed.), Peace, War,\n21Blainey, The Causes of War, Ch.3.\nEconomic Development and Military Effectiveness 51\nthan a coin toss' at predicting war outcomes because the political\noutcomes of most wars are, in fact, coin tosses.\nWith respect to battle outcomes, Stephen Biddle finds that several\nmaterial indicators do not predict casualty ratios.22 These results,\nhowever, do not constitute fair tests of the relationship between\nmateriel and military power, because casualty ratios measure the\nquality of a state's military units while the material indicators tested\nmeasure its quantity of resources. There is little reason to expect\nnumerical superiority to correlate with soldier-for-soldier quality. In\nfact, it is more common for states with large armies and populations to\nsubstitute sheer mass for military effectiveness. For example, in both\nWorld Wars many Russian soldiers were sent into battle without rifles\nbecause Russia had an abundance of manpower but a scarcity of\ncapital.23 This imbalance did not mean that Russia was militarily weak,\njust that victory required tremendous human sacrifice. As the old\nFinnish saying goes: `Each Finnish soldier is worth ten Russian soldiers,\nbut what happens when the eleventh Russian shows up?'24 To conduct\na fair test of the relationship between material factors and military\neffectiveness, therefore, it is necessary to weight a state's absolute level\nof resources by the population over which those resources are\ndistributed. This can be accomplished by using indicators such as\nper-capita GDP or military spending per soldier. Unfortunately, no\nexisting study of battlefield effectiveness has done so.\nThird, and most importantly, the current body of research\noverlooks a critical determinant of effectiveness: economic develop-\nment. Politically stable, Western democracies with high levels of\nhuman capital also tend to be economically prosperous. It is\ndistinctly possible, therefore, that the correlations found between\nthese political and social variables and military effectiveness reflect a\nmore general connection between economic development and\nmilitary power. Yet none of the studies described above considers\nthis possibility or controls for economic development. A few studies\nexamine the link between development and mobilization capacity\nand find that (at least in the World Wars) economically developed\nstates successfully produce and deliver more resources to the\n22Biddle also uses territorial gain as a dependent variable, but the results are mixed. In\nparticular, he finds that the defender's force-to-space ratio has a significant effect on the\nattacker's ability to gain territory. As he points out, this result is consistent with\nmaterialist conceptions of military power. See, Biddle, Military Power, 170\u00ad3.\n23Jonathan R. Adelman, Revolution, Armies, and War: A Political History (Boulder,\n24Thanks to Richard Betts for passing on this phrase.\nbattlefield than poorer states.25 But this insight only links develop-\nment to quantities of military resources; it does not explain\nvariations in the quality of those resources.\nWe now come to the central argument of this study: military\neffectiveness is primarily a product of economic development. In\nparticular, economically developed states tend to possess more\nsophisticated and reliable equipment and more skilled military\npersonnel than less developed states. These two qualitative advantages,\nof equipment and skill, translate directly into military superiority. The\nnext section expands on this argument while the subsequent section\ntests it empirically.\nEconomic Development and Military Effectiveness\nThe essence of economic development is efficiency of production. The\nhigher a state's level of economic development, by definition, the more\nefficiently its workers produce goods and services. There may be a\nnatural tendency to view civilian and military realms as separate\nentities, but militaries are actually embedded within economic systems.\nThus, countries that excel in producing civilian goods and services also\ntend to excel in producing military force.26 In particular, economic\ndevelopment improves a state's ability to produce high-quality military\nequipment and skillful military personnel.\nThis theory goes beyond the traditional materialist view, which only\nlinks military effectiveness to defense spending and implies that poor,\ntechnologically backward states can still piece together powerful\nmilitaries by stealing or purchasing arms from abroad and channeling\ninvestment into defense at home. As the subsequent discussion and\nempirical tests make clear, however, the relationship between economic\ndevelopment and military effectiveness extends far beyond sums of\nmoney.\n25Stephen Broadberry and Mark Harrison (eds.), The Economics of World War I\n(Cambridge: CUP 2005); Mark Harrison (ed.), The Economics of World War II\n(Cambridge: CUP 1998); Klaus Knorr, Military Power and Potential (Lexington, MA:\nHeath Lexington Books 1970); Klaus Knorr, The War Potential of Nations (Princeton\n26Obviously economically developed countries may, for various reasons, decide not to\ninvest in military power. The point here is that given a fixed quantity of resources\ndevoted to defense, economically developed states will produce more effective forces\nand therefore be more militarily powerful than less developed states. In other words,\nthis paper is not about whether states have an interest in military power, but rather\nwhether they have the capacity to produce and employ it.\nEconomic Development and Military Effectiveness 53\nEquipment\nInnovations occur sporadically in all societies, but only economically\ndeveloped states are capable of sustained technological progress. The\ninstitutional foundation of economic growth \u00ad secure and enforceable\nproperty rights \u00ad encourages the creation and application of new\ninnovations, while high levels of commerce and mobility facilitate their\ndissemination. Developed economies also posses the financial capital to\nfund technological innovation, and the production capacity to\nmanufacture equipment in large quantities. As industries within an\neconomy become more advanced, they increasingly benefit from\neconomies of scale that diminish the unit costs of production and,\ntherefore, increase the likelihood that new innovations, including\nmilitary innovations, will be developed and adopted.\nThis capacity for sustained technological progress translates into\ntechnological supremacy in battle, as evidenced most clearly by the\nhistory of colonialism. Consider that in 1850, Great Britain's GDP was\nonly half that of India's, yet Britain's fourfold advantage in economic\ndevelopment (as measured by per capita income) translated into vastly\nsuperior weapons and organization, which in turn facilitated\npolitical domination.27 Throughout this period technological asymme-\ntries resulted in extremely one-sided military outcomes. For example, in\n1898 during the Battle of Omdurman, a British-led army used Maxim\nguns and Lee-Enfield rifles to cut down 11,000 Dervishes for the loss of\nEven when two sides possess similar types of equipment, those\npossessed by economically developed states tend to be of higher\nquality. For example, the original designs for the American M1 tank\nand the Soviet T-72 entered production within ten years of each other.\nThe M1, however, was produced by the most vibrant economy on earth\nwhile the T-72 emerged from a stagnant, technologically backwards\nsociety. The resulting `tank gap' was never exploited during the Cold\nWar, but it was made manifest during the 1991 Gulf War.29 While\nUS tank rounds had no problem penetrating Iraqi T-72s from distances\n27Figures calculated from data in, Angus Maddison, `Historical Statistics, World\nrug.nl/*Maddison/4.\n28For a summary, see, Michael Clodfelter, Warfare and Armed Conflicts: A Statistical\n29On the superiority of US tanks over Soviet tanks, see Malcolm Chalmers and Lutz\nUnterseher, `Is There a Tank Gap? Comparing NATO and Warsaw Pact Tank Fleets',\nup to 3,700 meters, Iraqi T-72 rounds \u00ad some of which were fired from\nwithin 500 meters \u00ad often failed to damage American tanks or even\nslow them down.30 Soviet fighter aircraft similarly lagged far behind\nthose of the United States. When a Soviet pilot, seeking asylum, flew his\nMiG-25 to Japan in 1976, inspectors on the ground found it was devoid\nof any next-generation technologies and described it as basically a\n`rocket with a window'.31\nThese technological deficiencies did not stem from a lack of funding \u00ad\nentire gross national product to military research and development32 \u00ad\nbut rather from economic underdevelopment.\nIn considering technological superiority, moreover, it is important\nnot to fixate solely on weapons platforms. Advantages in communica-\ntions, intelligence, medical care, and logistics can have decisive impacts\non military outcomes. For example, American victory in the Pacific\ncampaigns of World War II was due in no small part to the ability of US\nsoldiers to stay healthy while Japanese forces were decimated by\ndisease. Moreover, the historically low loss rate in the 1991 Gulf War\ncan be partially explained by the decisive American advantage in\nintelligence systems, including its constellation of global positioning\nsystem (GPS)-based navigation systems, Joint Surveillance and Target\nAttack Radar System (JSTARS) aerial surveillance radar, satellites, and\nspy-planes.\nWhile states can purchase advanced technologies from others, only\ndeveloped economies possess the technological industry and skilled\nworkforce necessary to modernize them. For example, in the mid-\n1930s, Fascist Italy was spending more on defense than Britain, France,\nor the United States, yet this massive military investment lacked a solid\neconomic foundation. In 1938, Italy possessed only 2.8 per cent of the\nworld manufacturing production, produced only 2.1 per cent of its\nsteel, and had a per capita income equal to that achieved by Britain in\nthe middle of the nineteenth century.33 Without a vibrant technology\nsector or a robust industrial infrastructure, Italy was incapable of\nkeeping pace with vital military developments and entered World War\n30Enzio Bonsignore, `Gulf Experience Raises Tank Survivability Issues,' Military\n31Robert L. Paarlberg, `Knowledge as Power: Science, Military Dominance, and US\n33Paul Kennedy, The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers: Economic Change and\nMaddison, `Historical Statistics, World Population, GDP and Per Capita GDP, 1\u00ad\nEconomic Development and Military Effectiveness 55\nII with obsolete equipment: Italian biplanes flew at half the speed of\nAllied aircraft while Italian tanks, weighing a mere 3.5 tons and armed\nwith two machine guns, were no match for Allied tanks that weighed\n20 tons and had much heavier weaponry.34 Shackled to such outdated\ntechnology, it is little wonder that the Italian Army was routed in the\nNorth Africa campaign.\nEven if underdeveloped states obtain the `teeth' of a technologically\nsophisticated military, they may not possess the `tail' needed to\nsupport it.35 Poor countries may, for example, purchase modern tanks\nand aircraft but lack the spare parts or the technicians to keep them\nrunning. These two deficiencies, of supplies and trained personnel,\noften go hand-in-hand and reinforce each other, creating a problem one\nscholar termed `the logistic snowball': a state with meager supplies\nneeds to use what it has efficiently, but it is poor in the first place\nprecisely because it is incapable of operating efficiently. Thus,\naccomplishing a given task requires more personnel, who in turn\nrequire more resources and personnel to transport, house, feed, and\nmanage them, and so on.36\nFinally, militaries often rely directly on civilian equipment, supplies,\nand techniques. For example, in 1973 Israeli milk trucks carried\nammunition across the Suez Canal, and El Al's passenger planes\ndelivered high-priority spare parts and ammunition.37 Today, the\nAmerican military depends on private companies to provide logistical\nservices and to produce information technologies, such as fiber optic-\nlaced clothing, head-mounted computer displays, global satellite\nphones, impromptu wireless networks, and rugged laptop computers.\nTwo of the most important modern weapons systems, stealth and\nmultispectral technologies, depend on innovative manufacturing and\ndesign technologies that reside in the commercial sector, and three-\nquarters of the computing power in the Aegis cruiser depends on\ncommercial equipment.38 In these respects, a solid economic infra-\nstructure enhances military effectiveness during wars, as well as in the\nperiods that precede them.\nIn earlier eras, copying and imitation through espionage were viable\noptions for laggard states seeking to catch up with technological\n34Kennedy, Rise and Fall of the Great Powers, 295.\n35Eliot A.

In the early 1900s, it only took three years for Germany to\ncopy and produce its own version of the British super battleship HMS\nDreadnought. The first US detonation of a nuclear weapon in 1945 was\nfollowed by a Soviet detonation only four years later. Today, however,\nmilitary technologies are much more difficult to copy because they are\nnot stand-alone pieces of hardware. Military power used to consist\nprimarily of weapons platforms and troops; today it is comprised of\nsystems, which link weapons and troops to sensors, satellites, and\ncommand centers. Countries may be able to purchase certain aspects of\nthese systems from abroad, but only developed states will have the\nsupporting infrastructure necessary to assimilate state-of-the-art\nmilitary technologies and integrate them into a cohesive, lethal whole.\nSkill\nMilitary effectiveness also requires skill. As Stephen Biddle has pointed\nout, the extreme lethality of modern weapons makes exposed mass\nmovement on the battlefield suicidal. To survive in such an environ-\nment, military units must master demanding tactical schemes that allow\nthem to accomplish military missions while simultaneously minimizing\ntheir exposure to enemy firepower.39 Skill is also crucial at the\noperational level. Officers must be able to synthesize a host of factors \u00ad\nthe mission, the strength and objectives of the enemy, terrain, weather,\netc. \u00ad and make decisions regarding strategy, doctrine, and tactics that\nmaximize the power of their forces. Moreover, leaders must continually\nassess military units and improve operational plans and training\nprograms accordingly. For example, after defeating Poland in World\nWar II, the German military leadership critically examined its own\nforces and instituted organizational changes. This process produced a\nmuch more effective fighting force and facilitated the subsequent\nIn addition, military effectiveness hinges upon the quality of\nadministrative decisions regarding military organization and structure.\nSuccessfully coordinating, supplying, and transporting forces in\ntheaters of combat requires not just trained soldiers but also talented\nmanagers and brainy analysts to determine and implement the most\neffective distribution of manpower, equipment, and expenditures. In\nthis regard, scientific techniques, such as operations research and\nsystems analysis, provide a foundation of rigorously derived knowledge\nupon which sound operational decisions can be made.\n40Williamson Murray, `German Response to Victory in Poland: A Case Study in\nEconomic Development and Military Effectiveness 57\nSkill, however, is an extremely perishable commodity. Each\nsuccessive class of soldiers must receive rigorous training, and existing\nunits must drill continually to prevent atrophy. Basic training for a\ntypical soldier may only take a few months, but training officers to lead\nthem takes years and requires a system of military academies to\ndisseminate military know-how and breed trust within the ranks.41\nFurthermore, an effective military administration requires a robust\ninfrastructure of government, academic, and private research institu-\ntions, as well as a constant supply of human capital to staff them. The\nkey point is that militaries need sustained investment to remain\neffective because it is extremely difficult to develop or rebuild skills\nonce lost.\nSupporting a large military establishment for a long period of time,\nhowever, may reduce the rate of economic growth and therefore the\nwealth needed for future military power. States throughout history\nhave faced the dilemma of balancing the short-term security afforded\nby large defense budgets against the longer-term security of rising\nwealth. But this predicament is far less acute for economically\ndeveloped states that can produce effective militaries while devoting a\nrelatively small percentage of their economic resources to defense.\nIn addition, superior economic efficiency lowers the unit costs of\nweapons and supplies, thereby providing soldiers more opportunities\nto train with them, and more opportunities for administrators to test\nnew weapons and determine their feasibility for full deployment.42\nBy contrast, underdeveloped states may not be able to afford wasting\nammunition and supplies on training and testing, or be able to pay\nand retain skilled soldiers in peacetime. For example, the Soviet\nMiG-21 fighter aircraft received overhauls at triple the rate of many\nWestern aircraft, and Soviet T-62 tank engines reportedly wore out\ncompletely after 500 hours or less of use. As a result, the Soviet\nmilitary was forced to keep its weapons `packed away like a family's\nbest china', using them only for special exercises once or twice a\nEconomically developed states are also more likely to have skilled\nmilitary administrations.

Some studies have noted that\ninternal political discord significantly reduces military effectiveness by\neroding trust among soldiers from different societal groups or by\ncausing regimes to purposefully undermine the military's unity and\nproficiency. Prosperous states, however, are far less likely to be afflicted\nby such schisms. It is an empirical fact that economically developed\nstates experience fewer coups than less developed states. In fact, no\ndemocracy has ever fallen in a country with a per capita income above\n$6,055.46 Moreover, at least four studies have found that higher per\ncapita incomes significantly reduce the likelihood of civil wars.47 As\nthe World Bank concluded in 2003 after four years of research on the\ntopic: `the key root cause of (internal) conflict is the failure of economic\ndevelopment'. In short, economically developed states are far more\nlikely to have political environments conducive to the development of\nmilitary proficiency.\n44Edward L.

One might even\nargue that development is an outcome of democracy, civil-military\nrelations, human capital, or culture. If this were true, then we would\nfind an association between economic development and military\neffectiveness, not because economic development is the primary\ndeterminant of effectiveness, but because development serves either as\na proxy for these political and social factors or as an intervening\nvariable between them and military effectiveness.\nThe latter possibility, however, is somewhat beside the point\nbecause existing studies of military effectiveness claim that political\nand social factors directly shape the creation of military power, not\nthat they do so indirectly through their effects on economic\ndevelopment. Thus, even if economic development were largely an\noutcome of culture, regime-type, human capital, or civil-military\nrelations, that does not refute the claim that development directly\nshapes military effectiveness.\nMore importantly, it is doubtful that economic development is a\nproduct primarily of one or some combination of these four factors. For\ninstance, there is no hard evidence that amiable civil-military relations\nare a precondition for economic development. By contrast, it has been\nfound that economic downturns precipitate civil-military antagonisms\nbecause, among other reasons, they often result in significant cuts in\ndefense spending.48 As noted above, the best predictor of regime\nsurvival and internal order is high per capita incomes. To the extent\nthat wealth insulates regimes from internal threats and allows them to\nfocus on external enemies, it seems plausible that civil-military comity\nactually constitutes one of the causal mechanisms through which\neconomic development enhances military power.\nSimilarly, there is no consensus that democracy promotes economic\ngrowth. While democratic institutions may help secure property rights\nby constraining rulers, they may also unleash popular demands for\nconsumption or empower interest groups to force through inefficient\nredistributions of resources.49 This theoretical uncertainty is reflected in\nthe empirical record. In a review of existing studies on the issue, eight\nconclude that democracy facilitates economic growth, eight argue that\n48Brooks, Political-Military Relations and the Stability of Arab Regimes, 23\u00ad9.\n49On savings and investment, see Walter Galenson, `Introduction', in Walter Galenson\n(ed.), Labor and Economic Development (New York: Wiley 1959). On interest groups,\nsee Mancur Olson, The Rise and Decline of Nations: Economic Growth, Stagflation,\nand Social Rigidities (New Haven, CT: Yale UP 1982).\ndictatorship increases growth, and five studies find that regime-type\nmakes no difference.50 A subsequent study by Robert Barro also failed\nto find clear empirical support either way.51 Finally, the reverse\nargument, that economic development causes democratization, has\nbeen around for decades (modernization theory) and recently received\nstatistical support.52\nDebates over the relationship between culture and economic growth\nare similarly unresolved. At least since Max Weber's The Protestant\nEthic and the Spirit of Capitalism in 1920, groups of scholars\nhave argued that culture drives economic performance.53 According\nto this view, certain societies have systems of attitudes, values, and\nknowledge that facilitate economic growth. Others, however, respond\nthat attributing economic and political outcomes to culture mistakes\ncause for effect. These scholars maintain that coherent configurations\nof attitudes across broad groups of citizens rarely exist, and when they\ndo, they do not persist for long periods of time. Moreover, some of the\nfindings linking culture to political and economic performance were\nrevealed to be results of statistical errors or omitted variable bias.54\nFinally, the fact that many of today's fastest growing economies include\na diverse array of cultures casts doubt on the argument that economic\ndevelopment is culturally determined.\nHigher levels of human capital almost certainly facilitate economic\ngrowth, but only certain types are essential. While trained scientists are\nobviously required for indigenous technological innovation, economic\ngrowth does not necessarily require that the population at large be\n50Adam Przeworski and Fernando Limongi, `Political Regimes and Economic Growth',\n51Robert J.

As a recent study has\nshown, the initial level of income is a strong predictor of subsequent\ngrowth in education, likely because more developed countries can\nafford more robust systems of education.58\nIn sum, economic development is related to, but distinct from,\nhuman capital, civil-military relations, democracy, and culture. It\nfollows that studies of military effectiveness can and should test these\nfactors together. Not only is economic development a potentially\ncrucial determinant of effectiveness, but previous findings, concerning\nthe effects of democracy, culture, human capital, and civil-military\nrelations, cannot be verified until alternative explanations, such as\neconomic development, have been controlled for. At this point, we can\nderive several testable hypotheses:\nHypothesis 1. States with higher levels of economic development\nshould perform more effectively on the battlefield than less\ndeveloped states.\nConfirmation of this hypothesis does not imply that economic\ndevelopment is all that matters, it merely suggests that economic\ndevelopment is one of several important determinants of military\neffectiveness.\nA stronger claim would be that economic development is the primary\ndeterminant of military effectiveness. According to this view, correla-\ntions found by previous studies between political and social variables\nand military effectiveness are spurious. Western democracies with high\nlevels of human capital and low levels of civil-military friction fight\nbetter simply because they tend to be more economically developed\nthan states that lack these characteristics.\n55Joel Mokyr, `Long-Term Economic Growth and the History of Technology', in\nPhillippe Aghion and Steven N.

World Bank Economic Review\nHypothesis 2. After controlling for economic development,\nregime-type, culture, human capital, and civil-military relations\nshould not associate strongly with performance on the battlefield.\nFinally, some earlier studies used the level of defense spending per\nsoldier as a proxy for the quality of military forces.59 This association\nof defense spending with military effectiveness is consistent with the\ntraditional view that military capability is a function of material\nresources. The preceding discussion, however, suggests that the benefits\nof superior economic development go beyond merely having more\nmoney to invest in the military. In particular, economically developed\nstates are more likely to have robust technological infrastructures,\nlarge-scale production capacities, skillful personnel, and stable political\nenvironments, which may enhance effectiveness independent of the\nlevel of defense spending.\nHypothesis 3. States with higher levels of economic development\nshould perform more effectively on the battlefield than less\ndeveloped states, even after controlling for the level of military\nspending.\nEmpirical Analysis\nThe empirical analyses below test these three hypotheses by drawing\nupon the same data used in previous studies claiming that regime type,\nculture, human capital, and civil-military relations have significant\neffects on military performance.60 The goal is to provide a meaningful\ncontribution to our understanding of military effectiveness while\nmaking the smallest possible changes to the research designs of the\nlatest studies. This technique helps prevent bias in favor of my\nhypotheses and enables the reader to trace specific changes in\nsubstantive conclusions to particular methodological alterations.61\nTherefore, except for robustness checks and to create variables for\neconomic development, defense spending, and regime consolidation\nvariables, all of the data used in this study comes from Biddle and Long\n(2004), which is the latest quantitative study on the determinants of\nmilitary effectiveness.\n59See, for example, Stam, Win, Lose, or Draw.\n60Reiter and Stam, Democracies at War, Ch. 3; Biddle and Long, `Democracy and\nMilitary Effectiveness'.\nEconomic Development and Military Effectiveness 63\nThe Biddle and Long data is a modified version of the CBD90\ndataset, which was compiled for the US Army by the Historical\nEvaluation and Research Organization, now called the Dupuy Institute.\nBiddle and Long's modified version covers 381 battles fought since\n1900. Each observation represents a battle, with attacker and defender\nattributes as variables. The original data set contained significant\nerrors.62 But Biddle and Long improved the quality of the data by\nremoving double counts of battles and fixing historical inaccuracies.63\nDependent Variable\nLoss-exchange ratio (LER): the LER is simply the attacker's casualties\ndivided by defender's casualties and has been used as a measure of\nThis measure can be calculated for individual battles or entire wars.\nLERs have several benefits. First, it provides an objectively measurable,\ncontinuous variable that is not dependent on subjective, post-hoc\ncodings like `win/lose/draw'. Second, LERs permit the magnitude of the\nvictory or defeat to be recorded and thus retain more of the actual\nvariance in the data. Third, LERs naturally control for the scale of\ncombat action, which is important because many military outcome\nmeasures vary with the size of the units involved. Fourth, LERs have\nbeen found to coincide significantly with more qualitative assessments\nof effectiveness64 \u00ad the militaries considered by historians to have been\nthe most formidable have also tended to achieve the most favorable\nLERs in battle. It should be noted that smaller LERs coincide with\ngreater military effectiveness for the attacker. Thus, in the empirical\nanalyses that follow, negative coefficients represent positive effects on\nmilitary effectiveness.\nIndependent Variables\nDemocracy: The attacker's fraction of the total democracy score for\ncombatants, measured by the respective Polity III `DEMOC' variable\nvalues in the year prior to the outbreak of war. The higher the value,\nthe more democratic was the attacker relative to the defender and vice\nversa.\n62Michael C.

The first,\n`civmil favoring attacker', takes a value of 1 if the defender had at least\none more coup d'e\n\u00b4tat in the five years prior to the war than the attacker\nas reported in the Banks data. The second, `civmil favoring defender',\ntakes a value of 1 if the attacker had at least one more coup d'e\n\u00b4tat in the\nfive years prior to the war than the defender.\nCulture: A series of dummy variables representing combatant states'\nprimary religious affiliations as rough cultural indicators are employed.\n`PC' denotes a state in which the most common religious affiliation is\nProtestant or Catholic; `BU' Buddhist, Confucian, Shintoist, or a\ncombination thereof; `MU' Muslim; `JE' Jewish; and `OR' Orthodox\n(Eastern Orthodox, Russian Orthodox, etc.). Each dummy represents a\npair of states \u00ad the first two letters identify the attacker's religion, the\nsecond give the defender's.66\nEconomic development: The attacker's fraction of the sum of attacker\nand defender states' per-capita incomes in the year prior to the battle.\nThe higher the value, the greater the attacker's relative per-capita GDP.\nData is taken from the Maddison dataset.67\nMilitary spending per soldier: The attacker's fraction of the sum of the\ntwo sides' military spending per soldier in the year prior to the battle.\nData is obtained from the Correlates of War National Material\nCapabilities dataset.68\nControl Variables\nTroops: the attacker's fraction of the two sides' total troop strength.\n(Ann Arbor, MI: Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research\n(producer and distributor).\n66Data were compiled by Biddle and Long using, CIA, The World Factbook 2001\n(Washington DC: Government Printing Office).\n67Maddison, `Historical Statistics,World Population, GDP and Per Capita GDP, 1\u00ad\n68Singer, `Reconstructing the Correlates of War Dataset on Material Capabilities of\nEconomic Development and Military Effectiveness 65\nTank prevalence: the total number of tanks engaged (on both sides)\ndivided by the total number of troops (on both sides).\nGround-attack aircraft prevalence: The total number of ground-attack\naircraft sorties (on both sides) divided by total troops (on both sides).\nArtillery prevalence: The total number of artillery tubes engaged (on\nboth sides) divided by the total troops engaged (on both sides).\nHypothesis 1: Economic Development Increases Military Effectiveness\nFigure 1 shows that as the attacker's per-capita GDP increases relative\nto the defender's, the number of defenders killed per attacker killed also\nincreases. Bivariate regressions show that these relationships are\nsignificant at the 1 per cent level. In short, economically developed\nstates significantly outperform less developed states in battle.\nTo validate this finding, I employed four robustness checks. First, all\ncases were dropped in which the economic development variable was\nmore than one standard deviation above or below its mean average.\nDropping these extreme cases, however, does not alter the initial\nresults. Thus, even relatively small differences in economic develop-\nment produce disparities in military effectiveness.\nSecond, to control for momentum or spillover effects between\nbattles, a smaller sample was created, containing only one battle per\ndyad per month. This helps ensure that each observation is independent\nof others. Once again, however, this modification does not alter the\nresults.\nThird, two alternative measures were used for economic develop-\nment: energy consumption per capita and iron and steel production per\ncapita.69 As shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3, these alternative measures\ndo not change the basic pattern: economic development increases\neffectiveness.\nFinally, the relationship between development and effectiveness is\ntested using the Correlates of War Inter-State War dataset. This\nalternative source of data introduces a more diverse array of cases and a\ndifferent unit of analysis \u00ad wars as opposed to battles \u00ad thereby ensuring\nthat the previous findings were not the result of idiosyncracies of the\nCDB90 dataset. Calculating loss-exchange ratios in coalition wars,\nhowever, is problematic since it is not clear which country inflicted\nparticular sets of casualties. Therefore, I exclude all coalition wars and\nconsider only the bilateral wars for which per capita income data was\navailable. While this exclusion reduces the number of cases, it should\nnot bias the results. Moreover, some of the major coalition wars (e.g.\nboth World Wars and the four Arab\u00adIsraeli wars) are overrepresented\nFigure 2. Energy consumption per capita as a predictor of loss-exchange ratios in\n69Data for these variables was obtained from the National Material Capabilities\ndataset, version 3.02. For a description of the dataset see, Singer, `Reconstructing the\nEconomic Development and Military Effectiveness 67\nin the CDB90 dataset. Thus, dropping them helps check against the\npossibility that the previous results were unique to these wars. Figure 4\nshows that the relationship between economic development and\nmilitary effectiveness remains quite distinct, even when a different\ndataset is used.\nFigure 3. Iron and steel production per capita as a predictor of loss-exchange ratios in\nIn sum, there is considerable support for the first hypothesis. The\npositive relationship between economic development and military\neffectiveness holds across two different datasets, three different\noperationalizations of economic development, after extreme values of\nthe independent variable have been dropped from the analysis, and\nafter controlling for temporal dependence.\nHypothesis 2: Economic Development is the Primary Determinant of\nEffectiveness\nTable 1 presents multivariate results suggesting that the primary\ndeterminant of military effectiveness is economic development, and\nthat many of the political and social factors posited to affect military\ncapability either seem to be irrelevant or have the opposite effect of that\nfound in previous studies. Two regressions are presented. Model 1\nreplicates the findings of Biddle and Long (2004), which shows that\nhuman capital, culture, democracy, and civil-military relations sig-\nnificantly affect loss-exchange ratios.\nTable 1. Determinants of Military Effectiveness (Dependent variable: log(LER))\nNote: Entries are OLS regression coefficients with standard errors in parentheses. All results\nemploy robust standard errors.\nEconomic Development and Military Effectiveness 69\nModel 2 simply adds a variable for economic development (per capita\nincome). The first thing to notice is that the economic development\nvariable is highly significant (at the 1 per cent level), suggesting that the\npositive relationship between development and effectiveness holds even\nwhen controlling for materiel (number of troops, aircraft, artillery,\ntanks) and a host of political and social factors.\nSecond, human capital becomes insignificant once per-capita GDP is\nadded to the regression. This suggests that primary and secondary\neducation exerts no meaningful, independent influence on military\neffectiveness once development is taken into account. It is unlikely that\nthis result is caused by multicollinearity because the correlation\nbetween per-capita GDP and human capital is only .38.\nSimilarly, the variables suggesting that Western culture improves\nmilitary effectiveness (Protestant/Catholic vs. Buddhist (PCBU) and\nJewish vs. Muslim (JEMU)) also become insignificant once economic\ndevelopment is taken into account. In particular, the fact that the\nJEMU variable loses its significance suggests that the military\ndominance of Israel over its Arab enemies, attributed by some scholars\nto Arab cultural deficiencies, is more likely a consequence of Israel's\nsuperior level of economic development. Strangely, the Orthodox vs.\nMuslim (ORMU) variable becomes significant once economic devel-\nopment is accounted for. This might suggest that Eastern or Russian\nOrthodox cultures have some military advantage over Muslim cultures.\nIt should be kept in mind, however, that this result is tentative, because\nit is based on a limited number of observations, namely a handful of\nbattles against the Ottoman Empire in World War I. It should be noted\nthat a recent case study on the subject concludes that economic\nunderdevelopment, `more than anything else . . . holds the key to\nunderstanding the capacity and performance of the Ottoman military\nduring World War I'.70 Moreover, if Orthodox culture systematically\nenhances effectiveness, or if Muslim culture systematically undermines\nit, then we might expect some of the other dummy variables that\ninclude them (e.g. JEMU or PCOR) to be significant. In sum, Biddle and\nLong's findings about culture do not hold once economic development\nis taken into account, and the only finding that supports cultural\nexplanations of military effectiveness is sketchy.\nThird, Model 2 corroborates Biddle and Long's finding that\ndemocracy has a highly significant negative effect on military\neffectiveness. This contradicts Reiter and Stam's studies and suggests\nthat their finding of a positive relationship between democracy and\n70Sevket Pamuk, `The Ottoman Economy in World War I,' in Stephen Broadberry and\nMark Harrison (eds.), The Economics of World War I (Cambridge: CUP 2005), 112\u00ad\nbattlefield effectiveness is actually attributable to other factors that\ncorrelate positively with democracy. Thus, it seems that democracies\nperform better on the battlefield in spite of their democratic political\ninstitutions, not because of them.\nThe correlation between democracy and per capita GDP is quite high\n(.68) but the reversal of the sign on democracy occurred when human\ncapital was added to the regression in Biddle and Long's original\nmodel, and the correlation between those two variables is only .35.\nMore importantly, if there were a multicollinearity problem between\nper capita GDP and democracy, one of those two variables would\nbecome insignificant because its effect would be absorbed by the other\nvariable. Finally, an examination of the variance inflation factors does\nnot indicate a potential multicollinearity problem.71\nFourth, both civil-military relations variables are significant,\nindicating that coups hurt military effectiveness. This result suggests\nthat political stability is an important determinant of effectiveness, but\nthe incidence of coups does not necessarily reflect the state of civil-\nmilitary relations within a country. In fact, it is often the absence of a\ncoup that indicates that leaders have solidified their own authority by\npurposefully undermining the military's power and organization. Arab\nstates, for example, rarely experience coups despite having extremely\nhostile civil-military relations.72 In short, political stability and\namicable civil-military relations do not necessarily go hand-in-hand,\nso the Biddle and Long civil-military relations variable cannot be used\nto confirm or deny the civil-military relations hypothesis. This will have\nto be a subject for future research.\nIt is possible, however, to test further the possibility that political\nstability independently affects military performance. To do so, I\nconducted additional tests (not shown) using an alternative operatio-\nnalization of political stability: the level of regime consolidation.\nLiterature on political change and civil wars has shown that highly\nautocratic and highly democratic states are less prone to internal\nconflict and violent regime changes than `intermediate' regimes in\nwhich neither democracy nor autocracy has been fully consolidated.73\n71The highest variance inflation factor (VIF) value is 8.98 (for the per capita income\nvariable), but only values greater than 10 suggest a multicollinearity problem. On this\npoint, see, John Neter, William Wasserman, and Michael H. Kutner, Applied Linear\nRegression Models: Regression, Analysis of Variance, and Experimental Designs, 3rd\n72Brooks, Political-Military Relations and the Stability of Arab Regimes.\n73See, for example, Havard Hegre, Tanja Ellingsen, Scott Gates and Nils Petter\nGleditsch, `Toward a Democratic Civil Peace? Democracy, Political Change, and Civil\nEconomic Development and Military Effectiveness 71\nThis paper follows these studies in using Polity data as a proxy for\npolitical consolidation. The Polity IV data classifies political regimes\nusing a 21-point scale ranging from -10 (most autocratic) to \u00fe10 (most\ndemocratic). For each battle the absolute value of each side's Polity\nscore (for the year before the battle) is taken and a variable is created\nfor the attacker's fraction of the total Polity score of both sides. In a\nsimple bivariate regression (not shown here), more politically\nconsolidated sides achieve more favorable loss-exchange ratios,\nsuggesting that political stability increases effectiveness. This positive\neffect, however, disappears once economic development is added to the\nregression. It is unlikely that this change is the result of multi-\ncollinearity because the correlation between per capita income and\nregime consolidation is only .44.\nIn sum, there is mixed support for the second hypothesis.74 Economic\ndevelopment significantly improves military effectiveness even when a\nhost of other factors are taken into account. The results also suggest,\nhowever, that the incidence of coups has a significant effect on\nsubsequent performance in battles, and democratic political institutions\ndegrade effectiveness. Economic development, therefore, is not all that\nmatters, but it is certainly one of the essential determinants of military\neffectiveness.\nHypothesis 3: Economic Development Matters Independent of Defense\nSpending\nTable 2 presents multivariate results suggesting that economic\ndevelopment positively affects military capability even when levels of\ndefense spending are taken into account. Model 1 shows that economic\ndevelopment and defense spending both significantly enhance military\neffectiveness. In other words, a state with a high level of defense\nspending but a low level of economic development will not be as\nmilitarily effective as a state with the same level of military spending\n74The same robustness checks were employed as for hypothesis 1 (except for using the\nCorrelates of War data). Dropping extreme cases and controlling for momentum did\nnot alter the results. The alternate codings for economic development (iron/steel\nproduction and energy consumption) are significant in regressions without the culture\ndummy variables. Once the culture dummies are added, however, both of these proxies\nfor economic development become insignificant while the PCBU and JEMU culture\nvariables are statistically significant. There was also an attempt to control for pairwise\nfixed effects by adding dummy variables for every dyad in the dataset. However, this\nincreased the number of independent variables to 64. Since there are only a few\nhundred observations in the data set, there were simply not enough degrees of freedom\nto produce any significant results.\nbut a higher level of economic development. This conclusion is further\nsubstantiated by Model 2, which adds the full set of independent\nvariables. Economic development retains a highly significant positive\neffect on military performance, but defense spending becomes\ninsignificant once other factors are taken into account. While past\nstudies have used defense spending per soldier as a proxy for the quality\nof military forces, these results suggest that the level of economic\ndevelopment is a much more accurate predictor.\nConclusion\nThe most influential ideas about military power heretofore have\ncentered either on material assets or political and social pathologies.\nThe first view, however, ignores military effectiveness, while the second\nview mischaracterizes its determinants. Military effectiveness is a\ncrucial component of military power, but it is primarily a function of\nTable 2. Military Spending per Soldier and Military Effectiveness (Dependent variable:\nlog(LER))\nPC-MU dropped\nOR-MU dropped\nNote: Entries are OLS regression coefficients with standard errors in parentheses. All results\nemploy robust standard errors.\nEconomic Development and Military Effectiveness 73\neconomic development, not of political and social factors. In particular,\neconomically developed states are more capable of generating highly\nskilled military units and producing, maintaining, and modernizing\nsophisticated military equipment. Part of this advantage stems from a\ngreater surplus of wealth, which allows developed states to sustain\nlarge military investments without undermining long-term economic\ngrowth. But economically developed states also derive military benefits\nfrom their technological infrastructures, efficient production capacities,\nadvanced data analysis networks, stocks of managerial expertise, and\nstable political environments. In short, military effectiveness cannot be\nbought; it must be developed.\nThis positive relationship between development and effectiveness\nholds across hundreds of battles, dozens of wars, and several different\noperationalizations of development itself. Moreover, the connection\nbetween economic development and fighting power remains robust\neven when a host of other characteristics are taken into account. By\ncontrast, many political and social factors seem to have, at best,\nmarginal or idiosyncratic effects, suggesting that some of the\ncorrelations found between these variables and military effectiveness\nmay not be causal. Instead, certain political and social pathologies may\nbe produced by, or correlate with, economic development. While some\nof these factors may influence the process of economic growth and\nthereby indirectly shape effectiveness, the results presented here suggest\nthat few directly affect military capability. Thus, the conventional\nmilitary dominance of Western democracies is really just the conven-\ntional military dominance of the most economically developed states.\nFor those interested in developing a sound and quantifiable\nconception of military power, this conclusion simplifies things: a state's\nabsolute level of material resources measures the quantity of its military\nassets, while its level of economic development provides a solid proxy\nfor the quality of those assets. Combining these two components \u00ad\nresources and effectiveness \u00ad produces an accurate indicator of military\npower upon which broader theoretical and empirical claims can be\ntested.\nThe measures used in most academic studies and defense analyses, by\ncontrast, mistakenly conflate size with power and thereby overstate the\ncapabilities of large but underdeveloped states. China, for example,\ncurrently possesses the world's largest military and will have the biggest\neconomy within the next 30 to 40 years. But these achievements reflect\ndemographic rather than military preponderance. In fact, size increas-\ningly counts for little as advances in firepower, targeting, and\ncommunications make it possible for compact but sophisticated\nmilitaries to inflict unprecedented levels of destruction upon massed\nforces. Taiwan, Australia, and Singapore, to take three examples, can\ndo far more against potential adversaries than they could 30 years ago.\nMeanwhile, China and India \u00ad the two most populous countries on\nearth \u00ad have eschewed their comparative advantage in mass\nand reoriented their militaries to fight, what former Chinese President\nJiang Zemin called, `local wars under modern high technology\nconditions'.75 In short, the balance between quantity and quality has\nshifted decisively in favor of the latter.\nCountries like China, India, and Brazil are often considered to be\nsimultaneously great powers and developing countries, but the\nempirical record suggests this is oxymoronic, at least in a military\nsense. Poor states simply cannot offset the military deficiencies inherent\nin economic backwardness. The main issue for military assessments,\ntherefore, is not whether other countries raise their defense budgets or\nincrease their access to advanced technologies from abroad \u00ad though\nthese factors remain important \u00ad but whether they develop the\neconomic capacity to produce, maintain, and coordinate complex\nmilitary systems. Despite much talk in recent years of `peer\ncompetitors' and `power transitions', the United States is in a class by\nitself in these respects.\nThis conclusion, however, should not be cause for excessive\noptimism. Other countries can `pose problems without catching up',\nmeaning they do not necessarily need to surpass the United States in\nan absolute sense to radically alter the status quo regarding a specific\nissue or within a particular region.76 Since slight changes in\ncapabilities can have large geopolitical effects, it is absolutely essential\nto understand how military effectiveness ebbs and flows over time.\nMuch of the existing literature on this subject assumes that a\ncountry's military effectiveness is rooted in its culture and institutions.\nThis article, by contrast, suggests that the cultural and institutional\nbarriers to effectiveness dissipate as states become more economically\ndeveloped. Thus, the current surge in global prosperity, though\nmiraculous and wonderful in many ways, will also bring about\nconsiderable military modernization. The American lead in conven-\ntional military capabilities is larger than typically assumed, but it may\nrecede at a faster rate.\nManaging the geopolitical consequences of economic development\nhas always been a fundamental task of statecraft, but the unprece-\ndented pace and scope of growth today makes this both more difficult\nand more important than ever before. Many factors will determine\n75Jiang Zemin, Lun guofang yu jundui jianshe [On National Defense and Army\n76Thomas J. Christensen, `Posing Problems without Catching Up: China's Rise and\nEconomic Development and Military Effectiveness 75\nwhether such change occurs without violence, but one crucial\ningredient is clarity about the distribution of military power. As\nhistorian Geoffrey Blainey concluded: `Wars usually begin when two\nnations disagree on their relative strength.' Thus an explicit military\npecking order promotes peace. The most important point to be made,\ntherefore, is that the determinants of military power need to receive the\nsame kind of sustained and rigorous study that has been given to its\neffects. Military power plays a pivotal role in shaping numerous aspects\nof international relations, yet few analysts have taken the time to\ndevelop a sound conception of this crucial variable or to understand\nhow it is created. Since so many policy decisions and academic theories\nrely on assessments of military capability, it is absolutely imperative\nthat we get those assessments right.\n"
