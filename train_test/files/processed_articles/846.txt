Hip fracture in older adults is a significant medical, social, and economic concern to society. Little is\nknown regarding diabetes as a risk factor for hip fracture in the Mexican American population. The objective of this\nstudy was to examine diabetes and other potential risk factors for hip fracture in a sample of community-dwelling, older,\nMexican American adults.\nMethods. The study was a prospective cohort design involving the Hispanic Established Population for the Epidemi-\nologic Study of the Elderly, a longitudinal study involving a weighted probability sample of Mexican American adults\n(65 years) living in the southwestern United States. Included in the study were 3050 older Mexican American subjects\nwho were originally interviewed and tested at baseline and then followed with reassessment at 2, 5, and 7 years. Inci-\ndence of hip fracture was examined for subjects over 7-year follow-up.\nResults. At baseline, 690 subjects were identified with diabetes. One hundred and thirty-four subjects experienced a\nfirst-time hip fracture during follow-up. Cox proportional hazard regression revealed an increased hazard ratio for hip\nfracture in subjects with diabetes compared to those without diabetes (hazard ratio  1.57, 95% confidence interval\n]  1.03, 2.39, p  .04) when adjusted for age, body mass index, smoking, and previous stroke. The hazard ratio\nfor Mexican Americans taking insulin was 2.84 (CI95\nConclusions. We found diabetes was associated with increased risk for a hip fracture in older Mexican Americans,\nparticularly subjects taking insulin. Diabetes has not previously been considered a risk factor for hip fracture in older\nadults. The high incidence of type 2 diabetes in the Mexican American population highlights the need for increased re-\nsearch on risk factors in this ethnic group.\nIP fracture is among the most common reasons for\nhospitalization and disability among older Americans\nence a hip fracture each year (4). The incidence of hip frac-\ntures world-wide is projected to increase by 250% in the\nnext 25 years (5). In addition to pain, disability, and mortal-\nity (6), hip fracture is significantly related to hospital costs\nMedicare payments for patients with hip fracture from 1994\nthrough 1998. The cost of inpatient hospital care for persons\nwith hip fracture in the United States is more than $6 billon\npopulation ages (10).\nRisk factors for hip fracture include those related to falls\nand decreased bone density. Previous research has identified\nage, female gender, history of stroke, limitations in activities\nof daily living, decreased mobility, smoking, and impaired vi-\nsual function as risk factors (1,3,6,7). Other variables associ-\nated with a lower risk of hip fracture include later age at\nmenopause for women, use of thaizide, increased body mass\nindex, and greater than average height and muscle strength\n(1,3\u00ad7). Some regional and ethnic variations have been re-\nported, with higher rates of hip fracture in the southeastern\nUnited States and for non-Hispanic white women (11).\nThe prognosis for older adults who experience a hip frac-\nture is not positive (3). Twenty percent die in the year fol-\nlowing hip fracture, and 25% of those who survive require a\nhigher level of long-term care (3). Those persons who do re-\nturn to the community after a hip fracture have greater diffi-\nculty with activities of daily living, and only 60% will re-\ncover their prefracture walking ability by 6 months (6\u00ad9).\nConsequently, there is a need to improve health and func-\ntional outcomes for this population. An important step in\nunderstanding and improving functional outcomes is being\nable to identify and adjust for baseline characteristics that\ninfluence morbidity and functional loss. This is particularly\ntrue for minority and disadvantaged populations, where lit-\ntle research on outcomes has been conducted. In particular,\nwe were interested in outcomes related to hip fracture in\nMexican American older adults. Our interest in studying\nthis population was based on the following factors: (i) the\nincidence of type 2 diabetes in this population is known to\nbe high (12,13); (ii) recent studies in non-Hispanic whites\nhave suggested that diabetes might be a risk factor for hip\nfracture in some older adults (13); and (iii) we had access to\na large population-based sample of Mexican American\nolder adults that included comprehensive longitudinal data\non health status and outcome (12).\nH\nDiabetes mellitus has not been considered a significant\nrisk factor for hip fracture in older adults (13). Researchers\nhave reported inconsistent findings regarding bone density\nin persons with type 2 (adult onset) diabetes in comparison\nto control subjects (14), and few studies have examined the\npossible relation between diabetes and clinical outcomes of\ndecreased bone density (15,16). Two recent large-sample\ncohort studies reported diabetes as a risk factor for fractures,\nincluding hip facture, in older women (13,17). These studies\nwere limited to non-Hispanic white women, and the base-\nline response rate to the survey questionnaire in one of the\nstudies was low (42%).\nThe prevalence of diabetes mellitus in the Hispanic popu-\nlation is high (12), and information regarding risk factors\nfor hip fracture in the Hispanic population is limited. Espino\nand colleagues (18) examined the prevalence, incidence,\nand risk factors for hip fracture in community-dwelling,\nMexican American older adults. They reported rates of 9.1\nfractures per 1000 person-years for Mexican American\ncan men. The hip fracture rates for the general population\nfactors identified by Espino and colleagues (18) included\nage, female gender, living alone, previous stroke, and limi-\ntations in activities of daily living. Diabetes was not exam-\nined as an independent risk factor in this investigation.\nGiven the prevalence of diabetes in the Hispanic popula-\ntion and the lack of previous research examining hip frac-\nture in this ethnic group, we conducted a study examining\nwhether diabetes was a risk factor for hip fracture in a large\narea probability sample of Mexican American older adults.\nSpecifically, we examined whether diabetes was a risk fac-\ntor for hip fracture after controlling for age, gender, body\nmass index (BMI), ever smoked, previous stroke, lower ex-\ntremity functional ability, and distance vision.\nMETHODS\nSample\nData are from the Hispanic Established Population for the\nEpidemiologic Study of the Elderly (H-EPESE) (20). The\nH-EPESE is an ongoing National Institute on Aging funded\ncommunity-based study of 3050 older Mexican Americans.\nMexican American subjects aged 65 and older were selected\nby area probability sampling techniques that involved selec-\ntion of counties, census tracts, and households. A full descrip-\ntion of the rationale, methods, and subject characteristics can\nbe found elsewhere (12,20). The sample was designed to be\nAmericans living in five southwestern states--Texas, Cali-\nfornia, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico. The present\nbetes and 2194 people who did not have diabetes--see de-\ntailed description below). Follow-up interviews were con-\nafter baseline assessment. All interviews were done in the\nsubject's home and were conducted in either Spanish or En-\nglish. A description of the interview protocol is available in\nprevious publications (12,20) and from the authors.\nDiabetes\nHistory of diabetes was assessed at the baseline inter-\nview. Subjects were asked if they ever had a physician diag-\nnosis of diabetes. A total of 690 (23%) subjects reported a\ndefinite diagnosis of diabetes, 155 (5%) reported a border-\ntory of diabetes. Subjects with a borderline diagnosis of dia-\nbetes were not included in the analysis. Subjects who\nreported using any medication during the baseline inter-\nview, including insulin, were requested to show the medi-\ncation to the interviewer as a verification check. For the\n(87%) were taking medication for their diabetes, including\nHip Fracture\nHip fracture was assessed over a 7-year follow-up period.\nSubjects were asked if they had a physician diagnosis of hip\nfracture since the last interview. At the 2-, 5-, and 7-year fol-\nfractures were reported, respectively.\nCovariates\nBaseline sociodemographics included age and gender. In-\ndicators of baseline health status were smoking history\n(ever smoked or nonsmoker), BMI (computed as weight in\nkilograms divided by the square of height in meters), history\nof stroke (yes or no), a summary performance measure of\nlower body function, and a test of distant visual acuity. The\nsummary performance measure is comprised of three lower-\nbody activities, a timed 4-meter walk, rising from a chair\nfive times, and a hierarchical standing balance task (21,22).\nUsing previously established criteria (23), performance on\neach lower body activity was classified on a scale ranging\nfrom 0 to 4. When summed, the overall performance mea-\nsure is scored from 0 to 12, where higher scores represent\nbetter lower-body functioning (23). A modified Snellen test\nusing directional Es assessed distant visual acuity (24). Four\nvisual categories were created and included subjects\nwho were functionally blind (20/200), severely impaired\nStatistical Analyses\nWe examined demographic variables for all patients us-\ning descriptive and univariate statistics for continuous vari-\nables and contingency tables (chi-square) for categorical\nvariables. Chi-square analyses were used to test for differ-\nences between patients with diabetes (n  690) and patients\nwithout diabetes (n  2194) at the baseline assessment in-\nterview, and hip fracture (n  134) versus no hip fracture\n(n  1443) at the follow-up assessment interviews. Cox\nproportional hazard models (25) in SAS (SAS Institute, Cary,\nNC) were used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) of hip\nfracture over 7 years by diabetes status at baseline inter-\nview, adjusting for relevant risk factors. We computed two\nCox proportional hazard models. Model 1 examined the re-\nlationship between diabetes (definite diabetes vs absent) at\nbaseline and new-onset hip fracture (present vs absent) at\nthe three follow-up assessment interviews, adjusting for\nage, gender, smoking status, BMI, and history of stroke.\nModel 2 examined the relationship between diabetes (defi-\nnite diabetes vs absent) at baseline and new-onset hip frac-\nture at the three follow-up assessment interviews, adjusting\nfor the covariates described above, and a summary perfor-\nmance measure of lower body function and a test for distant\nvision. The two Cox proportional hazard models were rean-\nalyzed using patients with diabetes who take insulin (defi-\nnite diabetes and insulin-dependent vs absent) as a predictor\nvariable. Gender  diabetes and gender  insulin diabetes\ninteraction terms were created and were included in both\nmodels.\nA modified version of the Bonferroni correction was used\nto protect against type 1 errors in those cases where multiple\nunivariate hypotheses were evaluated (26). In cases where\nunivariate comparisons were made between unequal sam-\nples, a t test based on Levene's test that does not assume\nequal variances was calculated (27).\nRESULTS\nThe mean age of the sample at baseline was 71.8 years\nported a definite diagnosis of diabetes at baseline, and 185\n(27%) of these were taking insulin.

Persons with diabetes at\nDuring the 7-year follow-up period, a total of 134 (5%)\nsubjects reported a first-time hip fracture.

The interaction term (gender \ndiabetes) was not statistically significant in any of the mod-\nels. Table 3 includes the proportional hazard results ad-\njusted for age, gender, BMI, ever smoked, and previous\nstroke (Model 1), lower extremity functional ability, and\ndistance vision (Model 2). Table 4 includes results for the\nsame two Cox proportional hazard models except that the\nmodels include persons taking insulin rather that those only\nreporting a diagnosis of diabetes.

The hazard ra-\ntios remained statistically significant when potential explan-\natory variables such as lower extremity functional ability\nand distance vision were added to the models.\nAs with any longitudinal study, there were missing values\nfor some variables. For Table 3, 18 subjects who had a hip frac-\nture had missing data in Model 1, and an additional six subjects\nhad missing data in Model 2. In Table 4, 37 subjects who had a\nhip fracture had missing data in Model 1, and an additional six\nsubjects who had a hip fracture had missing data in Model 2.\nFor all variables except BMI, the proportion of missing data\nwas evenly distributed across the diabetic and nondiabetic\ngroups. Of the subjects with diabetes, 12.9% were missing\nBMI data, and 8.2% of the subjects without diabetes were\nTable 1.

Subjects with missing BMI values were older (p  .001)\nand were more likely to be diabetic (p  .001).\nDISCUSSION\nInformation on incidence and prevalence of hip fracture\nhas been obtained primarily from the non-Hispanic white\npopulation (28) and indicates the lifetime risk of hip frac-\nture is about 18% in women and 6% in men (4). Hip frac-\ntures increase substantially with age: By 90 years, one-third\nof women and one-sixth of men will experience a hip frac-\nDiabetes has not been considered a risk factor for hip\nfracture in older adults until recently (13). Adult-onset dia-\nbetes is generally associated with being overweight, and the\nprotective effect of obesity against osteoporosis is presumed\nto reduce the risk of hip fracture (5,8). Multiple studies have\ndemonstrated the relationship between low bone mass and\nincreased fracture risk, mainly in the non-Hispanic white\npopulation (1\u00ad3). Previous research, again in the non-His-\npanic white population, has reported relatively normal bone\nWe found increased risk of hip fracture in older Mexican\nAmericans with self-reported diabetes when compared to\nhip fracture rates in Mexican American subjects without di-\nabetes.

These factors included age,\ngender, BMI, previous history of smoking, and previous\nstroke. The relationship remained statistically significant\nwhen possible explanatory variables were added to the\nmodels including summary lower extremity function and\ndistance vision scores.\nWhy did the older Mexican Americans with diabetes have\nmore hip fractures than subjects without diabetes? Many fac-\ntors associated with diabetes could lead to an increase in falls\nand associated fractures. These include visual impairment\nrelated to diabetic retinopathy, diminished proprioception in\nthe lower extremities, poor balance, and unsteady gait\ncaused by diabetic neuropathy and/or peripheral vascular\ndisease. Any combination of these factors might increase the\nrisk of falls in older adults and subsequent hip fracture (31).\nType 1 diabetes has been associated with low bone den-\nsity; however, most studies of type 2 diabetes have reported\nnormal bone mass (14,15). The importance of bone quality,\nhowever, is relatively unexamined in type 2 diabetes. The\nvascular changes associated with diabetes could, theoreti-\ncally, have a negative impact on bone remodeling and,\ntherefore, on bone quality. The combination of poor bone\nquality and frequent falls might increase the risk of fracture,\nindependent of bone mass (32).\nFalling is a risk factor for hip fracture, and poor depth\nperception has been reported as an independent risk factor\nfor lower extremity fractures (33). There is a logical link be-\ntween diabetic retinopathy, poor depth perception, falls, and\nfractures in persons with diabetes. Finally, failure to ade-\nquately manage glucose and medication levels in older per-\nsons taking insulin may also result in an increased risk of\nfalls and subsequent fracture. These are not all the potential\nmediating mechanisms that link diabetes to increased risks\nof falls and hip fracture in Mexican American older adults,\nbut they are areas where additional research is needed.\nWe consider these findings preliminary, but believe they\nstrongly suggest the need for additional research on diabetes\nas a risk factor for hip fracture, with a particular need for in-\ncreased research on risk factors in the Hispanic population.\nThe importance of our findings is based on the following\nstrengths of the current investigation. We collected longitu-\ndinal information from a large, well-defined sample repre-\nsouthwestern United States (12,20). The reliability and con-\nsistency of the data collection procedures in the H-EPESE\ninvestigation are well-established (12,18). Our sample in-\ncluded both men and women, whereas most previous stud-\nies on risk factors for hip fracture have focused on non-His-\npanic white women. The H-EPESE sample represents a\npopulation (Mexican American) that is known to have a\nhigh rate of diabetes and related complications (12,18), but\nhas not been comprehensively studied. Relatively little is\nknown regarding health disparities and risk factors associ-\nated with hip fracture in this population (18).\nThe limitations of the investigation include the fact that\nseveral key variables including hip fracture and diabetes\nwere obtained by self-report. Previous researchers have re-\nported good validity for diabetes self-reports confirmed by\nphysician diagnosis (34,35). Individuals in this community-\ndwelling sample should have good recall of a major health\nevent associated with hospitalization, such as a hip fracture.\nReceiving a diagnosis of diabetes, however, is a less dra-\nmatic health event. As noted previously, if a subject re-\nported using insulin or other medications, the interviewer\nrequested the subject present those medications. Thus, there\nwas some interviewer verification of the diabetes diagnosis\nfor persons taking insulin or other diabetic medications. A\nlarge number of the subjects with diabetes at baseline (87%)\nreported taking some type of diabetic medication. Those\nparticipants identified as not having diabetes probably in-\ncluded some individuals with undiagnosed diabetes. This\nmisclassification would tend to weaken any association be-\ntween diabetes and fracture.\nInsulin use can be considered as a marker for disease se-\nverity in subjects with diabetes. Duration of diabetes is also\na potential marker for disease severity and a risk factor for\nhip fracture in this population. We did not have consistent\ninformation on duration of diabetes for the subjects in the\nH-EPESE sample, nor did we have any measure of glyce-\nmic control for the participating subjects.\nThis study highlights the need for a more aggressive fo-\ncus on identifying and addressing risk factors for hip frac-\nture in the Hispanic population. Our findings suggest that\ndiabetes may potentially be a more significant risk factor in\nolder Mexican Americans than in other ethnic or racial\ngroups. Research is needed concerning how diabetes and its\ncomplications contribute to increased risk of hip fracture in\nall populations, but specifically in Mexican Americans. The\nresults of this research must then be incorporated into diabe-\ntes education and prevention programs, particularly those\naimed at the Mexican American population.\n"
