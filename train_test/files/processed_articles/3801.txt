This study examined that \"aesthetics\" also have a significant impact to determine the extent\nof success of urban plazas and urban open spaces in combination with other quantitative factors, such as centrality of\nlocation, provision of services, and amenities. In addition, this research sought to focus on the relationship between visual\ncharacteristics and aesthetic response to urban plazas. Photo elicitation and focus interviews were conducted to identify\nkey visual characteristics as well as to examine aesthetic responses to those characteristics. Eight plazas and designed urban\nopen spaces in Dhaka, Bangladesh, featured in the main study, and research methods included a structured questionnaire\nto collect data and used semantic differential rating scales as a measuring instrument. Outcomes from this research indicate\nthat a positive aesthetic response was linked to specific visual characteristics of urban plazas, suggesting that this information\ncould be used to more effectively refurbish existing and design new urban plazas as public spaces.\n",

Parks, plazas, squares, and other urban open\nspaces provide a vital connection with nature and can posi-\ntively affect quality of life (Marcus & Francis, 1998). In\nurban environments, public spaces such as plazas can serve\nas successful social spaces and can function as a focus for\ndifferent activities. The physical characteristics of plazas,\nwhich can vary enormously, generally include an urban\nspace confined in terms of space and size, centrally located,\nand laid out in such a way as to allow for a multiplicity of\nuses (Woolley, 2003). Generally, in the academic and design\nterm, plaza means a designed urban open space, and the\nexclusion of cars makes them ideal as places for a range of\nactivities such as strolling, relaxing, sitting, and socializing\n(Marcus & Francis, 1998). In terms of the design of urban\nplazas, an increasing number of scholarly works focus on\ntheir physical characteristics and visual qualities, and how\nthese may influence human response and behavior. These\ncharacteristics and qualities include architectural elements,\nlandscape design, and morphology, plus features relating to\nsecurity, management, and other ambient characteristics of\nthe environment (Loukaitou-Sideris & Banerjee, 1993;\nWhile the literature identifies the visual and aesthetic\ndimensions of an urban plaza as characteristics that enhance\nqualities of public space, a gap exists concerning the precise\nnature of the aesthetic characteristics of the architectural ele-\nments that enhance the interface between the environment\nand human responses. This article explores the architectural\nand visual characteristics of urban plazas as public spaces\nspecifically in relation to aesthetic responses. Outcomes\nfrom this study can be used to further explore the aesthetic\nattributes of urban plazas and designed urban open spaces.\nThe interface between urban plazas, human response, and\nbehavior is clearly multidimensional; that is, a range of\nvisual, morphological, and aesthetic qualities are essential to\ncreating a successful public space. The traditional definition\nof aesthetics often refers to perceptions of beauty in the arts\nand implies intense feelings that are sublime (Lang, 2005,\nthe urban environment as one of the essential criteria for the\nenvironmental evaluation of urban space.

As all visual quali-\nties are not \"aesthetic,\" in this article, the definition of aes-\nthetic refers solely to visual qualities that can create an\nappreciation of an urban environment (Carmona, Heath, Oc,\nThe design of urban plazas can positively or negatively\naffect the use of public spaces, and therefore, designers have\na special responsibility to understand and design in such a\nway as to serve the public good (Carr, Francis, Rivlin,\n& Stone, 1992). Over the last few decades, environment\u00ad\nbehavior studies have provided an effective way of examin-\ning the interrelationship between visual characteristics of the\nbuilt environment and human responses. Many studies have\nfocused on neighborhoods and public streets (Gehl, 2006;\nMehta, 2009). While other research has examined residential\nstreets and community spaces (Sullivan, Kuo, & Depooter,\n2004), some studies have concentrated on the physical attri-\nbutes of the environment by combining behavior mapping\nand geographic information system (GIS) techniques\ncerned about visual preference, permeability, functional\naspects, and impressions of enclosed spaces and urbanscapes\n2005c). However, it is likely that positive aesthetic response\nin relation to urban plazas depends to a certain extent on the\nvisual attributes of architectural characteristics and features,\nand a logical assumption is that successful urban plazas may\nalso be those that generate positive aesthetic responses. Thus,\nit is imperative to explore the relationship between the envi-\nronmental and aesthetic qualities of urban plazas to improve\ntheir efficiency given that plazas serve as a form of urban\nrelief for urban dwellers.\nResearch Framework and Void in\nLiterature to Aesthetic Response\nOver the last few decades, using an empirical approach to\naddress environment\u00adbehavior studies of urban open spaces\nhas become common. It is considered that there is a strong\nrelationship between the built environment and the aesthetic\ndimension of urban space. The Austrian architect and city\nplanning theoretician Camillo Sitte (1965) recommended\ntwo primary elements, nodes and paths, in addition to artistic\nelements, that is, fountains and monuments, as the most\nimportant features for planning and designing of urban\nognition of essential characteristics of urban forms and iden-\ntified paths, edges, nodes, districts, and landmarks as the\nvital components defining the quality of the city image. In\naddition to identity, structure, and meaning to evaluate the\ncityscape, Nasar (1998) argued that the evaluative image\nalso represents some psychological constructs that involve\nsubjective assessments of feelings about the environment.\nAffective appraisal is one aspect of how someone interprets\nan environment in terms of psychological arousal. Russell\n(2003) focused on the emotional appraisal of the physical\nenvironment and found different dimensions as the psycho-\nlogical construction of emotion. Kaplan and Kaplan (1982)\nsuggested an environmental preference framework to evalu-\nate the physical environment, and found \"coherence\" and\n\"complexity\" as an immediate appreciation of the environ-\nment, and \"legibility\" and \"mystery\" as a longer term\nevaluation.\nThis research sought to examine the interface between the\nvisual characteristics of urban plazas and the aesthetic\nresponse. As a framework, this research has adopted Nasar's\n(1994) probabilistic model of aesthetic response to the built\nenvironment. Nasar considers that overall aesthetic response\nis a combination of perception, cognition, affect, and affec-\ntive appraisal (Figure 1). Furthermore, Nasar's model\nacknowledges that affect, cognitive judgments, and affective\nappraisals of building attributes are highly interrelated and\ncomplex, and hence, his model is probabilistic rather than\npredictive due to the influence of individual characteristics,\npersonality, affective state, and cultural experience of indi-\nvidual observers. By adopting the framework of this model,\nkey visual characteristics of urban plazas for positive aes-\nthetic response has been developed as a future design model.\nWe observed from the previous studies that some affec-\ntive variables as well as cognitive judgments are included to\nmeasure the aesthetic response (Abu-Obeid, Hassan, & Ali,\ntual, cognitive variables can measure the visual properties of\na physical environment, and arousal, evaluation, and prefer-\nence have been used to measure affective variables. Nasar\n(1998) also argues that the evaluative process, which may\ninvolve two kinds of variables, results from a complex pro-\ncess between observers, the cityscape (environment), and an\ninteraction between the two. As such, the evaluation process\ninvolves psychological constructs that also reflect subjective\nassessments of feelings about the environment (Nasar, 1998).\nBuilding\nAttributes\n.\n.\n.\n.\nXn\nObserver\n(Personality, affective state, intentions, cultural experience)\nPerception\n(of building attributes)\nCognition\n(Judgement of building\nattributes)\nAffect\n(Emotional\nreactions) Affective Appraisals\n(Connotative meanings)\nAesthetic Response\n(Pleasant-unpleasant, like-dislike,\nbeautiful-ugly, desirable-undesirable)\nFigure 1.

Although there are various\noperational measures and factors of aesthetic response, few\nattempts have been made to measure aesthetic responses in a\nmixed-method approach toward the built environment or to\nthe overall evaluation of environmental aesthetics. Therefore,\nthis study chose to focus on specific physical features, visual\nand architectural characteristics of urban plazas, by using\nboth qualitative and quantitative data analysis to concentrate\non the interface between the visual attributes of the built\nenvironment of urban plazas, aesthetic response. Model of\naesthetic response provides ways to represents and investi-\ngates the aesthetics of built environment that can also act as\na reference framework for future research works.\nResearch Design and Method\nThis research involved two phases, mixed-methods approach\nwith the first phase being a preliminary study that identified\nas well as explored preferences in terms of the visual charac-\nteristics of urban plazas using photo elicitation. The main\nstudy or second phase used field survey and sought to iden-\ntify levels of association between aesthetic response and the\nvisual characteristics of urban plazas. This article concen-\ntrates on the main study by using key findings of the prelimi-\nnary study, through which interrelationships between visual\ncharacteristics and urban plazas have been explored. Only a\nvery brief description of the first phase is included in the next\nsection.\nFirst Phase: Preliminary Study\nThe main objective of the preliminary study was to identify\npreferences for specific visual and architectural character-\nistics of a range of famous urban plazas, squares, and\npedestrian malls from different urban spaces around the\nworld. Using an iterative mixed-methods approach, the\nstudy involved focus interviews (using semistructured\nquestionnaires) as well as Q-sorting tasks in conjunction\nwith multiple digital images of twenty-four plazas, squares,\nand pedestrian malls. The Q-sort technique is a categoriza-\ntion or sorting technique, which directs participants to\ngroup visual stimuli into categories as defined by the\nresearcher (Amin, 2000). To transmit architectural values,\nelicitation through photographs is a common device in\ndifferent research domains, and photographs or slides have\nbeen used extensively as a substitute for the physical envi-\n& Nasar, 1997). Previous studies that explored the use of\nphotographic images and other elicitation media have gen-\nerally concluded that the correlation between responses to\nstatic color photographs, dynamic virtual reality model, and\nresponses to the physical environment is comparatively\nvery high (Stamps, 2010). Therefore, an appropriately\nframed picture should be able to tell more than a thousand\nA group of EBS (environment, behavior, and society)\nexperts, from the University of Sydney, finalized 24 photo-\ngraphs to use as visual stimuli from a series of 42 urban pla-\nzas from different parts of the world. The selection of 24\nplazas was based on two criteria. First, participants were\nasked to sort the images into three representative types of\nurban open spaces: urban plazas, urban squares, and pedes-\ntrian malls. Second, the slides had to represent the diversity\nof types of scenes according to the visual qualities.\nIn the first phase, to understand the users' subjective\nexperience according to their \"likeability\" of color images,\nfocus interviews and Q-sorting techniques were applied\namong conveniently selected 50 respondents. From a total of\n240 evaluations, participants identified the following most\n\"liked\" visual features of urban plazas, squares, and pedes-\ntrian malls that were considered to influence aesthetic\nresponse. Different research literatures also mention the\nimportance of these five physical features and corroborate\nthe following outcomes:\na. a good sense of enclosure (Collins, Collins, & Sitte,\nb. the height of the surrounding enclosure (in respect to\nc. a good coverage of vegetation, greenery, and natural-\nness (Galindo & Rodr\u00edguez, 2000; Herzog, Maguire,\nd. the inclusion of water features and fountains\ne. presence of monuments or sculptures (Lynch, 2007;\nHowever, this research only included the tangible visual\ncharacteristics that influence visual qualities of architectural\nelements and did not include intangible mediating factors\nthat might influence cognitive emotional appraisal, such as\norder, coherence, complexity, or legibility (Kaplan & Kaplan,\nSecond Phase: Main Study\nThe objective of the main study was to identify levels of\nassociation between aesthetic response and the visual char-\nacteristics of urban plazas as identified in the preliminary\n4 SAGE Open\nstudy. A semantic differential rating scale was used to mea-\nsure responses with four bipolar rating scale items: pleasant\u00ad\nunpleasant, beautiful\u00adugly, like\u00addislike, and\ndesirable\u00adundesirable. To corroborate the findings of the\nfirst phase, the field survey was conducted at eight urban pla-\nzas in Dhaka, Bangladesh: Dhanmondi 8, Dhanmondi 32,\nSangshad Bhavan, Zia Uddan, Rayer Bazaar, Ramna, Shahid\nMinar, and the Teacher Student Centre (TSC) at Dhaka\nUniversity (see Figure 2). Prior to the main study, a pilot\nstudy evaluated the survey methods, the appropriateness of\ninterview techniques, and questionnaire details, such as the\nnumber and wording of questions as well as the effectiveness\nof the use of probes, and the sequence of questions.\nAs there are few designed urban spaces in Dhaka city, this\nresearch sought to include all urban open spaces of Dhaka\ncity. However, based on short interviews with 15 architects\nand 15 nonarchitects, twelve urban plazas were selected. Out\nof these twelve spaces, a final eight urban plazas (Figure 2)\nwere selected for field survey. The remaining four plazas\nwere excluded due to privatization of ownership, restricted\naccessibility, overlapping visual characteristics, or lack of\nvibrancy and less use by the people. Data collection sessions,\nwhich occurred between September and November 2009,\nwere conducted during the day on these eight urban plazas\nand took between 15 to 20 min each. Stratified convenience\nsampling was used, and participants included people who\nactively used the plazas at the time of the survey. The partici-\npant group for each plaza was 35 resulting in a total sample\nFigure 2. Plan and image of the eight urban plazas in Dhaka, Bangladesh (fieldwork sites).\nTable 1.

Each participant group was stratified to ensure a\nbalance of age groups and gender. The visual characteristics\nof each plaza were further identified using a space inventory\nsurvey, based on the five most liked visual features of urban\nplazas as per the preliminary study. Nominal group consen-\nsus was used to provide different levels within each of the\nfive categories, and a total of 25 Sydney-based Bangladeshi\narchitects participated. Selection of the participant group was\nbased on the relevance of their educational background,\nexperience, and cultural familiarity, and each participant was\nprovided with a set of visual stimuli and a 5-point Likert-\ntype scale questionnaire for each plaza (Table 1).\nTherefore, for each variable, the visual characteristics\nthat are measured by the Likert-type scale are divided into\nfive levels, and the middle level always represents a \"mod-\nerate amount.\" Here, Likert-type scale 1 represents com-\npletely enclosed for \"surrounding enclosure,\" extremely\nlow for \"height of the surrounding enclosure,\" none at all\nfor \"vegetation,\" \"water features,\" and \"monuments/sculp-\ntures.\" For example, if an urban space is fully enclosed by\nany visual barrier, then the Likert-type scale measure is 1.\nHowever, Likert-type scale 5 represents completely open\nfor \"surrounding enclosure,\" extremely high for \"height of\nthe surrounding enclosure,\" great amount for \"vegetation,\"\n\"water features,\" and \"monuments/sculptures.\" For exam-\nple, if an urban space is without any visual barrier (com-\npletely open), then the Likert-type scale measure is 5. It is\nacknowledged, however, that the dimensions given in\nterms of low, moderate, and high are subjective and rela-\ntive, and this is often how the author refers to the propor-\ntion of these physical characteristics according to the\nprevious literature. The 5-point Likert-type scale is one\nexample of those used to measure the physical features\n(see Table 1). The results of the space inventory observa-\ntions are detailed in Table 2.\nData Analysis and Results\nDetermining the Variables and Internal Reliability\nof the Measurement Instruments\nFactor Analysis. An exploratory data reduction technique fac-\ntor analysis was used that summarizes data and allows for the\ndetermination of key components to establish whether it was\nstatistically appropriate to link the variables used in this\nstudy to the construct \"aesthetic response\" (Pallant, 2007).\nThe number of factors or components extracted from factor\nanalysis may vary depending on the loading of the compo-\nnent, and the results may be considered as \"clean\" when the\nvariables are strongly related (Pallant, 2007; Tabachnick &\nFidell, 2007). Table 3 illustrates the components of aesthetic\nresponse from factor analysis.\nCorrelation Coefficients.To identify the levels of association\nbetween the variables, Pearson product\u00admoment correlation\nanalysis was applied, and the strength of correlation between\nthe variables is quite strong. According to Pallant (2007),\ncorrelation coefficients from .10 to .30 indicate a weak cor-\nrelation, coefficients from .30 to .50 indicate a medium cor-\nrelation, and coefficients from .50 to 1.0 indicate a strong\ncorrelation. Strong correlation occurs among the four vari-\nables linked to aesthetic response (pleasant\u00adunpleasant,\nlike\u00addislike, beautiful\u00adugly, and desirable\u00adundesirable).\nStrong correlations (with coefficients ranging from .65 to\n6 SAGE Open\n.81, in Table 4) statistically justify linking these four vari-\nables to the construct aesthetic response.\nCronbach's Alpha.Reliability usually refers to repeated or\nreplicated similar and consistent research findings over a\nnumber of occasions (Groat & Wang, 2002; Kinnear & Gray,\n2009). Internal reliability measures the internal consistency\nof the test or measurement instrument, and this was mea-\nsured using Cronbach's alpha to ensure that the scale mea-\nsured the same characteristics, that is, the variance of\nparticipant's scores on each rating scale item (Kinnear &\nscore of .7 or above indicates good reliability of the instru-\nment (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2007). In this research, with the\nfour items of aesthetic response, Cronbach's alpha is .916\n(Table 5), which is well above the .7 recommended.\nThe Relationship Between Visual Characteristics\nand Aesthetic Response\nAnalysis of variance (ANOVA) compares the mean scores\nbetween different groups with the variability within each of\nthe groups (Pallant, 2007). One-way between-groups\nANOVA was conducted to explore levels of association\nbetween the five visual characteristics (from the first phase)\nand the aesthetic response. An F ratio represents the variance\nbetween and within the groups, which are calculated by\ndividing the variance between the groups and within the\ngroups. A large F ratio indicates more variability between the\ngroups than within each group, and an F ratio close to 1 indi-\ncates no difference between the groups (Hinton, 2004;\nPallant, 2007). The results of the one-way ANOVA for the\nindependent variables on four dependent variables of aes-\nthetic response are detailed in Table 6. The F(3, 276) ratio is\ngreater than 1 indicating significant differences at the p < .05\nlevel in aesthetic response in relation to the identified visual\ncharacteristics. These results indicate that the variable like\u00ad\ndislike appears to be representative of overall aesthetic\nresponse.\nAesthetic Response and Surrounding Enclosure. Different levels\nof enclosure appear to be associated with variations in pref-\nerence based on the variable like\u00addislike. Variations were\nstrongest for partially enclosed (Likert-type scale 2) and par-\ntially open (Likert-type scale 4), as opposed to moderately\nenclosed (Likert-type scale 3) and completely open (Likert-\ntype scale 5). Figure 3 illustrates response to surrounding\nenclosure using the variable like\u00addislike, which, as discussed\nabove, appears representative of overall aesthetic response\nwithin the context of this study.\nAesthetic Response and the Height of Surrounding Enclo-\nsure. Responses were mixed with respect to the height of the\nsurrounding enclosure, and it is difficult to establish a pattern\nor trend in responses. Figure 4 illustrates responses in relation\nto the variable like\u00addislike; however, changes in height of the\nsurrounding enclosures appear to be much more strongly\nassociated with variation in the variables pleasant\u00adunpleas-\nant, like\u00addislike, and desirable\u00adundesirable at the p < .001\nTable 5.

Preferences for surrounding enclosure.\nsignificance level. However, overall, it appears that a low\nsurrounding enclosure (Likert-type scale 2) appears to be\nmore strongly preferred over extremely low- (Likert-type\nscale 1) or moderate-height enclosures (Likert-type scale 3).\nAesthetic Response andWater Features. Responses of a \"mod-\nerate amount\" (Likert-type scale 3) of water features are sig-\nnificantly different from other levels of water features.\nVariation in the number of water features appears to be more\nhighly associated with variation in \"beautiful\u00adugly\" than to\nother preferences. The F(3, 206) ratios detailed in Table 6 are\ngreater than 1, indicating significant differences at the p <\n.05 level to the availability of water features. For the variable\nlike\u00addislike, a moderate amount (Likert-type scale 3) of\nwater features is clearly preferred over other levels of water\nfeatures, as illustrated in Figure 5.\nAesthetic Response and Vegetation.A nonsignificant differ-\nence in aesthetic response occurred for different levels of\nvegetation, and the effect size calculated by using eta squared\nfor all the variables was considered a small effect. The F(3,\n276) ratios detailed in Table 6 are very close to 1, indicating\nnonsignificant differences for aesthetic response at different\nlevels of vegetation. However, from Figure 6, it is noticeable\nthat the mean score for \"quite a lot\" (Likert-type scale 4) of\nvegetation is desirable and significantly different for differ-\nent types of responses. In summary, vegetation rated higher\nthan a \"moderate amount\" (Likert-type scale 4) is associated\nwith variation in aesthetic response, and \"quite a lot\" (Likert-\ntype scale 4) of vegetation appears to be the most preferred\nlevel of vegetation.\nAesthetic Response and Monuments/Sculptures.The presence\nor absence of monuments and sculptures appear to be more\nstrongly associated with variations: pleasant\u00adunpleasant,\nlike\u00addislike, and beautiful\u00adugly, and the mean scores for\n\"great amount/size\" (Likert-type scale 5) are significantly\ndifferent from other levels of monuments/sculptures. Figure\n7 illustrates the scores for like\u00addislike with respect to monu-\nments/sculptures.\nAesthetic Response and Eight Urban Open Spaces. This study\nindicates that changes in the visual characteristics of urban\nopen spaces appear to be associated with variation in aes-\nthetic response. In relation to the variables pleasant\u00ad\nunpleasant, like\u00addislike, and beautiful\u00adugly, Dhanmondi 32\nand TSC differed significantly from Dhanmondi 8,\nFigure 5. Preferences and water features.\nFigure 4. Preferences and the height of surrounding enclosure.\nFigure 6. Preferences for vegetation.\n8 SAGE Open\nSangshad Bhavan, Ramna, and Shahid Minar. In respect to\nthe variable desirable\u00adundesirable, Sangshad Bhavan dif-\nfered significantly from Dhanmondi 32, Ramna, and Shahid\nMinar, while the mean scores for Dhanmondi 32, Sangshad\nBhavan, Zia Uddan, and Ramna were significantly higher in\nterms of overall aesthetic response (Figure 8). From Table 2,\nit is evident that Urban Plazas 2, 3, 4, and 6 possess similar\nkinds of visual characteristics according to the respondents.\nAlthough the contextual settings of the eight study areas are\ndifferent for the observed five visual features, these four\nspaces share similar kinds of architectural settings and visual\ncharacteristics. This could be the reason why some spaces\nscored higher than others. From the ANOVA, the aesthetic\nresponse for each of the five variables also highlighted the\nmost preferred types of visual characteristics (Figure 3-7) for\nthe aesthetically preferred urban plazas, such as Dhanmondi\n32, Sangshad Bhavan, Zia Uddan, and Ramna. Figure 8 illus-\ntrates the variable beautiful-ugly and preferences across\neight urban plazas.\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nIn conclusion, aesthetic response varied with respect to the\neight featured plazas of Dhaka. While these variations may\nbe due to factors other than those identified herein, the above\nresults indicate that various visual features were rated more\nhighly than others (as per the variables like\u00addislike, beauti-\nful\u00adugly, pleasant\u00adunpleasant, and desirable\u00adundesirable).\nThese visual features include openness and the height of the\nsurrounding enclosure, in addition to the occurrence of water\nfeatures, vegetation, and monuments/sculptures. Therefore, a\npartially open, low-height enclosure, with a moderate amount\nof water features, moderate to great amount of monuments\nand sculptures, and plentiful vegetation, is very strongly\nassociated with the construct aesthetic response. For aesthet-\nically appealing, user-sensitive design solutions for urban\nplazas, designers need to consider the above design features\nto generate positive aesthetic response. Based on the above\nanalysis, the following conceptual model is proposed (Figure\n9). The model highlights the key visual characteristics of\nurban plazas found to be highly related to positive aesthetic\nresponse within the context of this study.\nIt is fully acknowledged that the measure of complex per-\nceptual subjective experience, aesthetic response, was lim-\nited to four variables. This research is not concerned about\nhow people perceive and evaluate different visual character-\nistics; rather, the pattern of response is limited to a range of\nvariables. However, this opens up possibilities for future\nresearch to consider various moderating factors of the envi-\nronment and different respondents (Ferdous, 2011).\nMoreover, to test, validate, and generalize the findings, this\nstudy could be used to create even more and diversified\nopportunities for future research. By repeating the steps and\napproaches of the research method, this research design\ncould be applied to different towns, cities, and other types of\nurban open spaces within different sociocultural contexts.\nHence, future research could include other influential rele-\nvant constructs not examined in this study.\nThis study was conducted in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and it is\nyet unknown whether the findings will be replicated in other\nsettings and situations. Future studies may indicate whether\nsimilar findings occur with respect to urban plazas in other\nregions and cities. In addition, opportunities for further\nresearch include examining the levels and weightings to\nwhich each of these key visual characteristics contributes to\naesthetic response. This research model could be used as a\ndesign protocol for making future decisions on policy as well\nas being used as a basic model for further academic research\nor urban design process (Karimi, 2012). By integration of\nusers' subjective response with the objective measures ana-\nlyzed through SPSS, urban designers, architects, urban and\ncommunity planners, social scientists, urban space manag-\ners, and other related authorities can make future urban pla-\nzas more successful, useful, and aesthetically attractive and\nFigure 7.

By modifying the contextual settings and adopt-\ning the measures and directions indicated in this research, it\nis possible for urban plazas to be designed in a more informed\nmanner so that they routinely become highly successful and\nattractive breathing spaces.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received financial support from Endeavor\nPostgraduate Award (EPA), an Australian Government Funding for\nthe research.\nReferences\nAbu-Obeid, N., Hassan, R.
