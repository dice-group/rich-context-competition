For\ndisplaced injuries, treatment options include\nclosed reduction with or without fixation,6\u00ad11\nopen reduction using various methods of\ntypes of screws,15\u00ad18 extra-articular plate fixa-\nprimary arthrodesis.23,24 Improper treat-\nment of a foot injury can easily lead to foot\nmalunion, which is characterized by pain,\ndeformity, and dysfunction of the foot.25\nTypically, most patients require surgery to cor-\nrect the deformity and the choice of surgical\napproach depends on the type of malunion.26\nExternal fixation to treat midfoot mal-\nunion has been reviewed,27 and a thorough\nanatomical classification scheme has been\nreported based on the segmental patterns of\ninjury and the forces involved.9 With the\nexception of these two published articles, to\nour knowledge, little information is avail-\nable on the treatment of midfoot malunion.\nTherefore, the aim of this retrospective\nreview was to assess a classification system\nfor midfoot injury, which was based on the\ncharacteristics of the foot malunion and\nevaluate our suggested treatment strategies.\nPatients and Methods\nPatient population and study design\nThis was a retrospective review of data\nobtained from patients who had been trea-\nted in the Department of Orthopaedics,\nTongji Hospital, Tongji University School\nof Medicine, Shanghai, China between June\nfoot malunion. The inclusion criteria were a\nmidfoot fracture or dislocation for more\nthan 6 months and an X-ray showing foot\nresidual deformity or joint degeneration.\nThe exclusion criteria were: (i) neurological\nand/or vascular complications; (ii) diabetes\nmellitus; (iii) foot neoplasms; (iv) Charcot\narthropathy. The type of injury, treatment\nand time from initial injury to reconstructive\nsurgery were recorded by one of the inves-\ntigators (C.G.L.). Each foot deformity (mal-\nunion) was categorized retrospectively by\nC.G.L. into one of three types based on the\nfoot arch: Type I, the foot arch was normal;\nType II, pes cavus deformity; Type III,\nflatfoot deformity (Figure 1). Subsequently,\nbased on the forefoot deformity, each type\nwas categorized into one of three subtypes:\nType a, forefoot abduction; Type b, forefoot\nadduction; Type c, normal forefoot.\nPrior to the operation, patients had (i)\nassessed their level of pain using a visual\nanalogue scale (VAS)28 that ranged from 0 (no\npain) to 10 (severe pain); and (ii) assessed their\nfunction using the American Orthopaedic\nFoot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) midfoot\nPreoperative weight bearing and non-\nweight bearing X-ray and computed tomog-\nraphy (CT) scans were measured and the\nColeman block test30 or antiColeman block\ntest31 performed to determine if the calcaneus\nhad a structural or functional varus deformity.\nThis study was approved by the Ethics\nCommittee of Tongji Hospital and complied\nwith the Declaration of Helsinki. All\npatients provided written informed consent.\nSurgical techniques\nContinuous spinal or epidural anaesthesia had\nbeen induced with the patient in a supine or\nlateral position. According to the types of\nmalunion, a fascio-cutaneous flap, osteotomy,\njoint arthrodesis or realignment had been\nchosen to correct the deformity. A pneumatic\ntourniquet was used during surgery and one or\nmore longitudinal incisions were made as\nrequired. A single dorsal incision in the inter-\nspace between the first and second metatarsal\nwas made for the fusion of the first and second\ntarso-metatarsal joints.\nFor simple Lisfranc joint fractures and\ndislocations (i.e. the first to fifth tarso-\nmetatarsal joint fracture or dislocation)\nthe affected joint was reduced and the first\nFigure 1. Categorization of midfoot malunion. Each foot deformity was categorized into one of three types\nbased on the foot arch and then these were further categorized into one of three subtypes based on the forefoot\ndeformity. The types were: Type I, the foot arch was normal; Type II, pes cavus deformity; Type III, flatfoot\ndeformity. The subtypes were: Type a, forefoot abduction; Type b, forefoot adduction; Type c, normal forefoot.\ntarso-metatarsal joint was fused. The second\nand third tarso-metatarsal joints were fused\nor fixed according to the dislocation and\narticular cartilage damage, and in cases\nwhere the fourth and fifth tarso-metatarsal\njoints were dislocated, open reduction was\nperformed under direct vision and fixation\nwas performed with a 2 mm Kirschner wire.\nIn cases where there was significant degen-\neration of the lateral column and persistent\npain, fusion of the fourth or fifth tarso-\nmetatarsal joint was required.\nFor severe Lisfranc joint complex injuries,\nin patients with mild abduction deformity,\nand when the therapeutic effects of talo-first\nmetatarsal angle reduction were not satisfac-\ntory, the affected joints were fused after\nmedial osteotomy. In patients with severe\nabduction deformity, medial and lateral inci-\nsions were made followed by medial wedge\nosteotomy and lateral column lengthening.\nThe bone from the medial osteotomy could\nhave been used to prolong the lateral column\nand, if required, autologous iliac bone could\nhave been used. The principles of midfoot\njoint fusion were to ensure joint stability and\nretention of the talonavicular and calcaneo-\ncuboid joint function as much as possible.\nIf severe degeneration, preoperative impair-\nment of activities and/or persistent pain were\npresent, the talonavicular and calcaneocu-\nboid joints could be fused simultaneously.\nOther tarsal joint instability was also treated\nwith arthrodesis.\nFor patients with poor soft tissues and\nmassive scars at the dorsal foot, fascio-\ncutaneous flap grafting was performed fol-\nlowed by fracture/dislocation reduction by\nsimple fixtures. In the event that the foot\nstructure and morphology recovered poorly,\nosteotomy and rigid fixation were undertaken.\nFollowing all surgery, patients were\nimmobilized in a neutral position by a plaster\ncast for 2 weeks. Patients were encouraged to\ndo partial weight bearing activities using a\npostoperative brace for 6 weeks. Full weight\nbearing was delayed for 10 to 14 weeks after\nfracture healing was confirmed by radio-\nlogical examinations.\nPatients had been assessed preoperation\nAnteroposterior, lateral and oblique X\u00adrays\nhad been taken to assess the integration of\njoint morphology and healing. At 12 and\n24 months, patients had been assessed using\nthe VAS to assess weight bearing and walk-\ning pain and the AOFAS midfoot score to\nassess functional outcome. At 24 months,\npatients were categorized into different\ngroups according to their AOFAS midfoot\nscale score for functional outcome (i.e. 90\u00ad\npoor).29 Patient satisfaction with surgery was\nassessed as the patient being able to return\nback to work and the treatment having no\nimpact on their daily activities.\nStatistical analyses\nAll statistical analyses were performed\nusing the SPSS\u00d5 statistical package, version\n17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for\nWindows\u00d5. Paired t-tests were used to com-\npare data and a P-value < 0.05 was\nconsidered to be statistically significant\nwith a 2-tailed test. No allowance was\nmade for multiple testing.\nResults\nTwenty-four patients (21 men and three\nwomen) with posttraumatic midfoot malu-\nyears. The cause of injury was direct violence\nin 15 cases and indirect violence in nine cases.\nAccording to the site of injury, there were six\nLisfranc joint injuries, nine Lisfranc joint\ncomplex injuries combined with cuboid com-\npression fractures and nine Lisfranc joint\ncomplex injuries combined with navicular\nfractures. In eight patients, large area scars\nformed due to severe soft tissue injury.\nWith the exception of two patients who were\nmisdiagnosed and not initially treated, the\nremaining 22 patients had been treated (i.e.\nthree with closed reduction and cast immo-\nbilization; four with closed reduction and\npercutaneous Kirschner wire fixation; seven\nwith open reduction and internal fixation\nwith Kirschner wire; eight with open reduc-\ntion and rigid fixation).

At 24 months, two (8.3%) patients\nhad occasional mild pain and eight had no\npain. None of the patients had a recurrent\nmalunion. Twenty (83.3%) patients were\nsatisfied with the outcome and returned to\ntheir previous work and activities, two\n(8.3%) patients had changed their occupa-\ntion and worked part-time and two (8.3%)\nhad not resumed work.\nTwenty-one patients had a stable midfoot\nboth subjectively and clinically. Two further\npatients had superficial infection at the\ndorsal foot incision. The remaining patient\npresented with poor soft tissue and a mas-\nsive scar on the dorsal foot and 6 weeks after\nthe operation, the X-ray showed malalign-\nment. Rigid fixation was removed and arth-\nrodesis was conducted.\nOut of the 24 patients, two patients had a\nslight limp when walking. One patient pre-\nsented foot pain when walking 3 years after\nfusion of medial and middle column.\nDiscussion\nThe nonoperative treatment of midfoot\nfractures may result in malunion, which\nmay in turn lead to long-term disability for\nsome patients.32 The goals of any midfoot\nreconstruction, which is generally\naccomplished with arthrodesis and realign-\nment, are to create a painless, functional,\nplantigrade foot with a good appearance.\nTherefore, not only is correction of the\nmidfoot deformity important but also any\ncoexisting forefoot and hindfoot deformities\nneed to be rectified. Indeed, a hindfoot\ndeformity is critical because if the heel is\nleft in valgus, it can cause increased prona-\ntion and abduction of the midfoot and so\nfurther deformity may develop. Moreover, if\nthe hindfoot is left in equinus, it can cause\npressure on the midfoot and deformity\nassociated with medial column instability\nDue to the heterogeneity of midfoot\ndeformity, it is difficult to formulate a\nroutine protocol for treatment. However,\nthe main principles are to correct foot\nabduction and adduction, any rotation\ndeformity and any arch anomaly in order\nto achieve realignment. In addition, foot\nstability must be maintained by restoring\nfoot length through bilateral osteotomy or\nopen osteotomy techniques. Open midfoot\ninjuries often cause large scars on the dorsal\nfoot. On occasions where there is a lack of\naccurate reduction and rigid fixation at the\nfirst surgical stage, scar contracture can\naggravate the deformity. In this present\nstudy, there were eight patients with a\nlarge area of foot scar formation. We are\nTable 2.

Subsequently, according to\nthe types of malunion observed, the appro-\npriate procedure (i.e. fascio-cutaneous flap,\nosteotomy, joint arthrodesis or realignment)\nwas selected to correct the deformity. For\nexample, for patients with Type I (i.e.\nnormal arch), only forefoot adduction or\nabduction deformity was corrected. For\nType Ia, according to the degree of abduc-\ntion, the foot length determined the osteot-\nomy method. If the abduction angle\nwas < 25, closed or open wedge osteotomy\nbased on foot length and soft tissue con-\ntracture was considered; if the abduction\nangle was ! 25, bilateral osteotomy was\nrequired and the medial closing wedge oste-\notomy and lateral cuboid open wedge oste-\notomy were chosen. Type Ib was treated\nwith medial open wedge osteotomy or lat-\neral closing osteotomy according to the\nseverity of the deformity and soft tissue\ncontracture. Type Ic was mainly foot\ninstability or osteoarthritis and in situ\nfusion was used for this. For patients with\nType II cavus arch anomalies, foot dorsal\nclosing wedge osteotomy was required and\nattention to retain sufficient foot length was\ntaken. For patients with Type III flatfoot\ndeformities, the joint had to be stabilized\nand plantar side closed osteotomy con-\nducted to correct the collapsed arch. Of the\n24 patients with midfoot malunion in this\npresent study, two were Type Ia, four were\nType Ic, nine were Type IIa, two were Type\nIIb, four were Type IIIa and three were Type\nIIIc. In this present study, VAS and AOFAS\nmidfoot scores significantly improved over\nthe 24-month study period and at the end of\nthe study 87.5% patients rated their func-\ntional outcome as excellent or good. In\naddition, radiographs showed that the foot\nmorphology for all patients was much closer\nto anatomical status than it had been\npreoperatively.\nThe study had several limitations. First, the\nsample size was small and so there were few\npatients with each type of midfoot malunion.\nTherefore, further studies with more patients\nare required to confirm the classification\nsystem and the therapeutic effects of the\nsuggested surgical therapies. Secondly, because\nof the relatively long follow-up period of this\nstudy, different types of implants were used in\nthe patients. Patients who were enrolled early\nin this study had their joints fixed with screws,\nwhereas those who enrolled later had their\njoints fixed with plates and screws. Future\nstudies should specify the type of internal\nfixation for the different types of foot\ndeformity.\nIn conclusion, this study confirms that the\nsurgical management of midfoot malunion\nprovides effective and good results by stabiliz-\ning injured joints, improving alignment and\nrestoring the foot arch. Classification of the\nmidfoot malunion introduced in this study\nmay be helpful in the decision making process\nfor surgical intervention. The morphology of\nthe malunited midfoot can be restored by\nsalvaging the tarso-metatarsal joint. In add-\nition, we recommend restoring the foot arch\nby reconstructive osteotomy and primarily\nfusing or fixing the midfoot malunion.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis study was supported by the National\nNatural Science Foundation of China (no.\nhad no role in study design, data collection and\nanalysis, decision to publish, or preparation of\nthe manuscript.\nReferences\n1.
