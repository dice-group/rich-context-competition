Although obesity is the state of having excess\nbody fat, it is typically clinically defined by BMI; one assump-\ntion being that the relationship between BMI and body fatness\n(%BF) is consistent across age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Recently,\nhowever, there have been several reports (1,3\u00ad5) suggesting\nthat the BMI\u00ad%BF relationship is not uniform across race/\nethnic groups, e.g., Asians compared to Northern Europeans\n(1,3,4) or between ethnic groups in the United States (6\u00ad8).\nThese findings question the applicability of the International\nObesity Task Force (IOTF) optimal BMI cut-points devel-\noped for use internationally (9). These BMI cut-points were\nintroduced in 2000 to provide optimal thresholds for thinness\namong children and adolescents. The IOTF cut-points were\ncalibrated to be equivalent to BMI at age 18 years and were\nobtained by averaging data from six ethnically and racially\ndiverse countries: United States, Great Britain, Brazil, Hong\nKong, Netherlands, and Singapore (9).\nUsing data from a multi-ethnic sample of US adolescents\nincluding non-Hispanic white (NHW), non-Hispanic black\n(NHB), and Mexican-American (MA) adolescents from the\ncontinuous National Health and Nutrition Examination\nship between BMI and %BF using fractional polynomial\nMethods and Procedures\nWe investigated the relationship between BMI and %BF in adolescents\nderived from an initial data set of 7,497 individuals in that age range;\nmissing %BF data and another 480 whose self-identified race/ethnicity\nwas other than NHW, NHB, or MA.\nWeight (kg) and height (m) were measured according to standard\nprotocols (11) and used to calculate BMI.

Durazo-Arvizu1\nBMI is the preferred measure of adiposity in adolescents. Recent evidence suggests that in adults the relationship\nbetween BMI and adiposity can vary by age and race/ethnicity. We investigated the relationship between BMI and\npercent body fat (%BF) in a large multi-ethnic, nationally representative sample of US adolescents (National Health\nand Nutrition Examination Survey, NHANES, 1999\u00ad2004). BMI was calculated; %BF was derived from dual-energy\nX-ray absorptiometry data and compared to BMI among adolescents from three groups: non-Hispanic white (NHW),\nnon-Hispanic black (NHB), and Mexican-American (MA). Fractional polynomials were used to model a new equation to\nestimate %BF from a given BMI. MA boys weighed significantly less than either NHW or NHB boys, while only NHB\ngirls weighed significantly more than the other girls. Among the boys there were no differences in mean BMI, whereas\n%BF differed significantly between all three groups. For the girls, both BMI and %BF differed significantly the groups\nwith MA girls having the highest %BF. The significant correlates for modeling %BF from BMI included gender, age,\nrace/ethnicity, weight, BMI\n,\n, and\n;\nthe final model explained 79% of the variance in %BF. NHB adolescents\nhad significantly lower %BF for BMI and MA had higher than NHW. Our results indicate that BMI may not be an\nequivalent measure of %BF in a multi-ethnic population of US adolescents.\nshort communications\n \ne.g., we defined a dummy variable for sex to test for differences between\nsex and BMI, and two dummy variables for race/ethnicity to test for inter-\nactions between race/ethnicity and BMI.

The FP2\nmodel explained the most variance in %BF (R2 = 0.794), mar-\nginally more than the FP1 model (R2 = 0.786). We selected to\nuse the FP1 model because of an apparent over-fitting of the\ndata using the FP2 model. Thus the final model included body\nweight, and explained 79% of the variance in %BF. Excluding\nbody weight slightly reduced the R2 to 0.777. In the FP1 model,\nNHB adolescents had significantly lower %BF for BMI, MA\nhad higher than NHW.\nTable 1 Fractional polynomial regression of percent body fat (%BF) by BMI among non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and\nIndependent\nWith weight (kg) in model Without weight in model\nBMI\nand\nand\nGirl Ref Ref Ref Ref\nWhite Ref Ref Ref Ref\nBMI\nBMI\nCI, confidence interval; FP1, first order fractional polynomial regression; FP2, second order fractional polynomial regression.\nshort communications\n \nDiscussion\nOur primary goal was to investigate whether %BF was equiva-\nlent at comparable BMI's across three race/ethnic groups of ado-\nlescents in the United States. We used the IOTF cut-points for\nBMI to identify which adolescents would be categorized normal\nweight, overweight, or obese at age 18 years, based on their cur-\nrent BMI and age. We found significant differences for %BF at\nthe same BMIs across race/ethnic groups, indicating that BMI is\nnot an equivalent measure of adiposity in multi-ethnic adoles-\ncents groups. MA adolescents had, on average, higher %BF for a\ngiven BMI compared to NHW and NHB had lower %BF.\nInstead of using a multiple linear regression or quadratic\nmodel to identify the significant independent correlates for\n%BF from BMI as has been used in most other previous stud-\nies (5), we used a FP1 model to estimate %BF from BMI as\nsuggested by Royston and Sauerbrei (10). This type of equation\nallows for modeling the nonlinearity of the data. The model\nwhich explained the greatest variance (79%) in %BF included:\nBMI, sex, age, weight, race/ethnicity.\nFlegalet al.(14)exploredtheBMI-adiposityrelationshipusing\nIn parallel with the current study, NHB children consistently\nhad lower levels of body fat within the same BMI categories than\neither NHW or MA children. In contrast to the findings among\nadolescents alone, there were no differences in %BF for BMI\nbetweenNHWandMA.Therewerenosignificantrace/ethnicity\ndifferences observed in the prevalence of high %BF in the Flegal\nstudy when the categories of high BMI-for-age (95th percen-\ntile) and intermediate BMI-for-age (85th <95th percentile) were\nused. In the normal BMI-for-age category (<85th percentile),\nhowever, NHB children had significantly lower prevalence of\nhigh %BF compared to NHW and MA children.\nWith much smaller samples, Ellis et al. conducted a series of\nstudies (15,16) comparing %BF levels in NHW, NHB, and MA\nboys and girls, 3\u00ad18 years, using dual-energy X-ray absorpti-\nometry to quantify %BF. In line with the current study, Ellis\nreported that MA boys had significantly higher %BF levels\nthan NHW boys and, generally, NHB boys had lower %BF\nthan NHW boys, after adjusting for body size (16) and that\nMA girls also had higher levels of %BF compared to NHW\ngirls after adjusting for body size (15). Based on these stud-\nies, it was recommended that estimations of %BF should be\nrace/ethnic-specific. Together with the results from the current\nstudy, it may be necessary to investigate whether or not BMI\ncut-points should be different for each race/ethnic group to\ncapture differential risk of obesity-related consequences. The\nimplications for this, particularly when it comes to identifying\nthose most at risk may have serious consequences.\nIn conclusion, we present data which indicate that in a nation-\nally representative sample of adolescents, BMI does not repre-\nsent the same degree of adiposity across race/ethnic groups.\nDisclosure\nThe authors declared no conflict of interest.\nREFERENCES\n1.
