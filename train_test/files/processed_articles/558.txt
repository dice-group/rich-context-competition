Kosofsky, MD, PhD\nImportance: Animal studies have suggested that pre-\nnatal cocaine exposure (PCE) deleteriously influences the\ndeveloping nervous system, in part attributable to its site\nof action in blocking the function of monoamine reup-\ntake transporters, increasing synaptic levels of seroto-\nnin and dopamine.\nObjective: To examine the brain morphologic features\nand associated impulsive behaviors in adolescents fol-\nlowing prenatal exposure to cocaine and/or tobacco.\nDesign: Magnetic resonance imaging data and behav-\nioral measures were collected from adolescents fol-\nlowed up longitudinally in the Maternal Lifestyle Study.\nSetting: A hospital-based research center.\nParticipants: A total of 40 adolescent participants aged\nwith PCE; a subset of each group additionally had to-\nbacco exposure. Participants were selected and matched\nbased on head circumference at birth, gestational age, ma-\nternal alcohol use, age, sex, race/ethnicity, IQ, family pov-\nerty, and socioeconomic status.\nMain Outcome Measures: Subcortical volumetric mea-\nsures of the thalamus, caudate, putamen, pallidum, hip-\npocampus, amygdala, and nucleus accumbens; cortical\nthickness measures of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex\nand ventral medial prefrontal cortex; and impulsivity as-\nsessed by Conners' Continuous Performance Test and the\nSensation Seeking Scale for Children.\nResults: After controlling for covariates, cortical thick-\nness of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was sig-\nnificantly thinner in adolescents following PCE (P=.03),\nwhereas the pallidum volume was smaller in adolescents\nfollowing prenatal tobacco exposure (P=.03). Impulsiv-\nity was correlated with thalamic volume following either\nPCE (P=.05) or prenatal tobacco exposure (P=.04).\nConclusions and Relevance: Prenatal cocaine or to-\nbacco exposure can differentially affect structural brain\nmaturation during adolescence and underlie enhanced\nsusceptibility to impulsivity.

All rights reserved.\nOne confounding factor in the study of PCE is that\nmost PCE offspring are subject to gestational exposure\nto other substances of abuse, most notably tobacco.6 Stud-\nies have demonstrated that prenatal tobacco exposure\n(PTE) might independently contribute to abnormalities\nin brain structures and impairments in brain growth.7,8\nNicotine, the psychoactive ingredient in tobacco, binds\nto nicotinic receptors in the brain, which, like cocaine,\nenhances synaptic levels of dopamine. However, the site\nand mechanism of action of these addictive drugs are dis-\ntinct. Thinner cortex has been reported in the orbitofron-\ntal and middle frontal cortical areas in adolescents follow-\ning PTE.9 In a cohort of children exposed to cocaine and\ntobacco, an association was observed between PTE vs PCE\ncontributing to reduced cortical gray matter volume, un-\nderlying the importance of distinguishing the indepen-\ndent and, in many cases, combined PCE/PTE effects.3\nPrenatal cocaine exposure/PTE has been found to be\nassociated with a wide spectrum of behavioral problems\ncharacterized by deficits in impulsivity, inhibitory con-\ntrol, and self-regulation. Dennis et al10 reported that co-\ncaine-exposed boys, who were studied at an average age\nof 4.5 years, were more likely to express frustration and\nhad more difficulty in controlling their frustration in a\nproblem-solving task. In one study of 6-year-old chil-\ndren, those with PCE experienced increased symptoms\nof oppositional defiant disorder and attention-deficit/\nhyperactivity disorder, consistent with the report of more\nbehavioral problems from caregivers.11 Results from the\nMLS indicate that PCE increases the prevalence of ex-\nternalizing behavioral problems from age 7 years through\nperiadolescence, and affected children are more likely to\nrequire special education services at ages 7 and 11 years.12\nHowever, there has been little information regarding\nthe long-term effects of prenatal drug exposure on brain/\nbehavior changes during adolescence. A major concern\nstems from whether an enduring effect of prenatal drug\nexposure would compromise adolescent brain develop-\nment, as the latter represents an additional critical period\nof neural plasticity, particularly for the frontal lobe devel-\nopment.13 Mostsubcorticalandmanycorticalregionsreach\ntheir peak growth periods during the first decade, and they\nexperience volumetric reductions and decreases in corti-\ncal thickness during adolescence, leading to an inverted\nU-shaped curve characterizing progressive followed by re-\ngressivebraingrowth.14,15 However,structuralmaturation\nof the frontal lobe peaks during the second decade, and it\nis thought to underlie the maturation of associated behav-\niors subserved by that region.16,17 Specifically, the transi-\ntionthroughadolescenceencompassesmultipleadaptations\ninbehavioraldomains.Increasedsocialactivitywithpeers\nand risk taking are evident in a variety of species.18-20 Most\nimportantly,withstructuralremodelingoffrontallobecir-\ncuitry during adolescence, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is\nplaying an increasingly prominent role in executing top-\ndownregulationofgoal-directedbehaviors.Giventhepu-\ntative role of PFC\u00adbasal ganglia systems in mediating be-\nhavioral regulation, synchronization between subcortical\nbasalgangliaregionsandthePFCarepresumedtosubstan-\ntially influence the evolution of adolescent behaviors.21\nBased on the fact that the highest concentration of\ndopamine in the cortex is in the frontal lobe and sub-\ncortically in the basal ganglia, we would expect struc-\ntural deficits in PCE adolescents to be observed in the\nPFC\u00adbasal ganglia system. Our hypothesis was that PCE\nwould be related to smaller volumes of subcortical re-\ngions and a thinner prefrontal cortex. We hypothesized\nthat PTE would impair brain growth of a similar, al-\nthough nonidentical, set of brain structures and cir-\ncuits. We also hypothesized that structural deficits in PCE\nand PTE adolescents would be related to more impul-\nsivity based on behavioral measures of poor inhibitory\ncontrol.\nMETHODS\nSUBJECTS\nAdolescents (aged 13-15 years) were recruited from the Provi-\ndence site of the MLS, which is an ongoing longitudinal study\nof children with PCE; recruitment criteria have been de-\nscribed elsewhere.22 Prenatal cocaine exposure was deter-\nmined by self-report of cocaine use during pregnancy and/or a\npositive meconium assay result for cocaine metabolites. Twenty\nparticipants with PCE and 20 with no PCE (NPCE) were se-\nlected and matched based on head circumference at birth, ges-\ntational age, maternal alcohol use, age, sex, race/ethnicity, IQ,\nfamily poverty, and socioeconomic status. Additional exclu-\nsion criteria included (1) intrauterine exposure to opiates or\nmarijuana, (2) gestational age less than 33 weeks, (3) IQ scores\nless than 70 at 10 years of age, and (4) females with a positive\npregnancy test result. Institutional review board\u00adapproved con-\nsent forms were obtained in the study.\nStructural MRI data were acquired using the volumetric mag-\nnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) T1-\nweighted sequence run on a 3-T Siemens TIM Trio scanner (Sie-\nmens Medical Solutions). The parameters for the MPRAGE pulse\nsequence were repetition time of 2250 milliseconds, echo time\nof 2.98 milliseconds, inversion time of 900 milliseconds, flip\nTo reconstruct brain morphologic features, the 3-dimen-\nsional MPRAGE data were processed via the Freesurfer soft-\nware package version 4.0.5 (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard\n.edu) using an automated pipeline custom developed for an\nXNAT-based DICOM server hosted at Weill Cornell Medical\nCollege of Cornell University (https://ped-birn.med.cornell\n.edu/xnat/). Details of the Freesurfer image analysis algo-\nrithms have been described in prior publications.23,24 In brief,\nafter implementation of motion correction, white matter vox-\nels were first identified to establish the gray-white matter in-\nterface as the starting point for cortical segmentation. Subse-\nquently, a deformable surface algorithm was applied to construct\nthe pial surface with submillimeter precision.24 Segmentation\nrequired the use of a set of priors in the form of an atlas, which\nguided the identification of specific brain structures based on\nlocation, tissue type, and local spatial configuration.25 The out-\nput was visually reviewed and topologic inaccuracies were manu-\nally corrected. Each reconstructed brain was registered to a com-\nmon spherical representation coordinate system to align sulcal\nand gyral characteristics across subjects.26 Parcellation of spe-\ncific cortical areas was based on the scheme developed by Desi-\nkan et al23 and allowed for calculations of the mean thickness.\nFor each point on the gray-white matter boundary, the short-\n\u00a92013 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.\nest distance to the pial surface was calculated. In the same way,\nthe shortest distance from every point on the pial surface to\nthe gray-white matter boundary was also measured. Cortical\nthickness estimates were defined as the average of these 2 dis-\ntances.24 Freesurfer's segmentation and parcellation approach\nhas been shown to be robust to intensity overlap between dif-\nferent cortical structures and comparable with manual label-\ning in accuracy.23,27,28 We have extended that comparison by\ndemonstrating the enhanced validity of using a set of manu-\nally edited pediatric priors for developmental studies.29\nConners' Continuous Performance Test II is a computerized\ntask administered at the 13-year visit and used to evaluate im-\npulsivity. The stimuli of bold-faced letters were presented uni-\nformly for 250 milliseconds on a computer screen, while in-\nterstimulus interval varied at 1, 2, and 4 seconds at random\nintervals. Participants were required to respond to the appear-\nance of any letter other than the target letter X by clicking a\nmouse button or pushing the space bar and to withdraw the\nresponse when an X was displayed. The commission error,\ndefined as \"a ratio of the subject's incorrect response to non-\ntargets as to the actual number of non-targets presented mi-\nnus the number of anticipatory responses towards non-\ntargets,\"30 was the raw score measure of impulsivity, which was\nthen transformed to a T score based on a nonclinical norm.31\nThe Sensation Seeking Scale for Children collected at the\n10-year visit is a 28-item self-report scale measuring motiva-\ntion for irregularity and adventure.32,33 Each question de-\nscribed a real-life situation and participants had to choose a sen-\nsation-seeking\u00adoriented response or not. A higher summary\nscore suggested stronger inclination for impulsivity.34\nStata version 10.0 (StataCorp) was used for statistical analy-\nsis. Independent t test, 2 test, or Fisher exact test was used, as\nappropriate, to examine group differences of demographic char-\nacteristics. Morphometric data derived from Freesurfer analy-\nses for which most values were more than 2 standard devia-\ntions from the mean were considered outliers and such data\nwere eliminated from further analyses. For subcortical mor-\nphometric analyses, volumes were highly correlated between\nthe 2 hemispheres. Therefore, the average of each subcortical\nstructure was calculated and used for subsequent analyses, in-\ncluding the thalamus, caudate, putamen, pallidum, hippocam-\npus, amygdala, and nucleus accumbens. Subcortical volumes\nof PCE subjects were compared with those of NPCE subjects\nafter controlling for intracranial volume (ICV) and PTE. In ad-\ndition, to examine PTE effects, a similar analysis was con-\nducted between PTE and non-PTE (NPTE), while controlling\nfor the ICV and PCE. Based on a priori hypothesis, cortical thick-\nness measures from the set of regions comprising the frontal\nlobe, including the dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC, rostral middle\nfrontal cortex) and ventral medial PFC (VMPFC, medial orbi-\ntofrontal cortex), known to be typically involved in behav-\nioral regulation,35 were extracted from the full data set. To test\nthe unique effect of PCE on cortical thickness, analysis of co-\nvariance was applied to detect regional thickness differences\nof DLPFC and VMPFC between PCE and NPCE after adjust-\ning for average cortical thickness and PTE. To examine PTE\neffects, a similar analysis was conducted between PTE and NPTE\nwhile controlling for average cortical thickness and PCE. In ad-\ndition, linear regression (Pearson r) was used to evaluate the\nassociation between specific brain morphologic measures and\nbehavioral performance on both Conners' Continuous Perfor-\nmance Test and the Sensation Seeking Scale for Children.\nRESULTS\nAmong the 20 PCE subjects, 15 also had PTE; there were\n8 with PTE among the 20 NPCE subjects. Demographic\ninformation for both the PCE and PTE cohorts (Table 1)\nshowed that the exposed and corresponding compari-\nson subjects were comparable with respect to all demo-\ngraphic variables analyzed.\nOne subject with both PCE and PTE was identified as\nan outlier, based on having multiple brain structures with\nTable 1.

After adjustment for both ICV and\nPTE (Table 2), pallidum approached statistical signifi-\ncance, with PCE subjects showing relatively larger vol-\numes (P = .06). After controlling for ICV and PCE, PTE\nsubjects exhibited significantly smaller pallidum (P = .03).\nThe cortical thickness estimate for the right DLPFC was\nsignificantly reduced in PCE compared with NPCE sub-\nP = .03), an effect that was not evident in the left hemi-\nsphere (Figure 1). Both DLPFC and VMPFC did not\ndemonstrate a significant effect of PTE on cortical thick-\nness (DLPFC: right hemisphere, P = .80, left hemi-\nsphere, P = .66; VMPFC: right hemisphere, P = .14, left\nhemisphere, P = .40).\nOn the Sensation Seeking Scale for Children, more im-\npulsivity was related to a larger thalamus in exposed sub-\njects in both the PCE (PCE: r = 0.47, P = .05; NPCE:\nspectively). Correlations between Conners' Continuous\nPerformance Test commission errors and caudate vol-\nume were of borderline significance in the PCE group\nCOMMENT\nWe found thinning of the right DLPFC in adolescents\nwith PCE and a decrease in the volume of pallidum in\nchildren with PTE. In addition, in both PCE and PTE, a\nlarger thalamus was related to behavioral impulsivity.\nSurprisingly, our finding of a lack of overall volumet-\nric differences in subcortical regions in 13-year-old to 15-\nyear-old PCE adolescents is not consistent with prior re-\nports of smaller caudate, putamen, and thalamus in studies\nof 8-year-old to 10-year-old PCE children.4,5 These dif-\nferences could be attributable to differences in imaging\nparameters and, in some reports, a consequence of not\ncontrolling for prenatal exposures to other substances.\nHowever, the discrepancy between preadolescence and\nadolescence could result from a supranormal adoles-\ncent brain growth spurt and delayed pruning of redun-\nTable 2.

Our results support the concept\nthat prenatal drug exposure changes brain development\ntrajectories in a structure-specific pattern that plays out\ndifferentially during the second decade, a hypothesis\nthat requires confirmation via future studies with itera-\ntive image acquisitions.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study of cortical\nthinning in cocaine-exposed offspring. This result re-\nmained significant after further adjustment for age or sex.\nOur result is consistent with neuroimaging data docu-\nmenting sustained changes in the brain, including the\nDLPFC, in adults following chronic cocaine abuse. Ana-\ntomically, evidence has shown reduced cortical volume\nand gray matter density in the DLPFC of cocaine-\ndependent subjects.36,37 In addition, reduced cerebral glu-\ncose metabolism, N-acetylaspartate level, and cerebral hy-\npoperfusion have been noted in the brains of adult cocaine\naddicts.38-40 As for the right DLPFC, positron-emission\ntomography studies have shown that active cocaine us-\ners have reduced activation of this area in both the Stroop\nand the Iowa Gambling tasks.41,42 Of note, one func-\ntional MRI study of an overlapping subset of the MLS sub-\njects, albeit 3 years younger, illustrated elevated brain ac-\ntivation in the right frontal cortex in the PCE group when\nexecuting a go/no go task.43 Taken together, the combi-\nnation of structural and functional imaging data pointed\nto the DLPFC as one cortical region selectively vulner-\nable to the effects of repeated cocaine exposure. How-\never, in adult drug addicts, it is not known whether this\nis a preexisting cortical alteration in the DLPFC or whether\nchanges are the consequences of cocaine addiction. There-\nfore, we cannot identify whether the thinner right DLPFC\nevident in the PCE group is a biomarker for adolescents\nat greater risk for drug experimentation or addiction.\nThe finding of smaller pallidum in PTE adolescents\nmatches decreased striatal volume from previous to-\nbacco studies.3,44 While both drugs have numerous sites\nand mechanisms of action, PTE effects have been pre-\nsumed to originate from diversified compositions of nico-\ntinic cholinergic receptor systems in the regionally hetero-\ngeneous distribution pattern.45 In addition, multiple\nneurotransmitter systems, including noradrenergic,\ngamma-aminobutyric acidergic, and serotonergic signal-\ning, are likely involved in PTE effects as well.46 There-\nfore, the nicotine-mediated dopamine release in the\nstriatum, individually or in concert with other neurotrans-\nmitter systems, might mediate PTE effects on subcorti-\ncal structures. We did not find PTE-related thickness\nchanges in the frontal cortical areas we studied. Toro and\ncolleagues9 reported thinner lateral orbitofrontal and cau-\ndal middle frontal cortex in female adolescents with PTE.\nToro and colleagues' study had a much larger sample size\nthan ours but no information regarding cocaine history\nwas specified or controlled for.\nThe association between adolescent impulsivity and\nalterations in brain structures has rarely been exam-\nined. We found positive correlations of volumetric mea-\nsures and impulsivity in the thalamus for both the PCE\nand PTE groups. Closely interconnected with the PFC\nand basal ganglia, the thalamus is the relay center in\nintegrating and gating sensory information, guiding at-\ntentional control, and coordinating behavioral re-\nsponses.47,48 Prior evidence has shown decreased resting-\nstate cerebral blood flow in the thalamus of adolescents\nwith PCE.49 The association between thalamic volume\nand impulsivity can suggest one liability for compro-\nmised top-down control over impulsivity. Future stud-\nies are needed to examine the relationship between im-\npulsivity and specific thalamic subnuclei. On the other\nhand, no significant correlation was observed between\ncortical thickness and behavioral impulsivity. Because par-\nticipants were in early adolescence, it was uncertain to\nwhat extent the maturation of cortical circuitry had been\ncompleted, creating the possibility that a more robust as-\nsociation might surface during late adolescence when the\nPFC is taking on a leading role of executive function.\nThalamic Volume, mm3\nSSSC Score\nFigure 2.

All rights reserved.\nOne strength of our design was dissecting the impact\nof prenatal drug exposure from other confounding vari-\nables by matching exposed and comparison subjects on\npotential confounding variables in advance. Still, our re-\nsults should be interpreted with caution. First, our con-\nclusions are based on a modest sample size of affected\nadolescents. Replications in future studies with larger\nsample sizes are warranted. Second, the MR-based brain\nimaging methods we used solely assessed brain volume,\nand they were not reflective of the cellular makeup of the\nbrain structures we studied. Third, dichotomized indi-\nces of prenatal drug exposure preclude any dose-\nresponse analyses in brain morphometry. Fourth, our find-\nings become less pronounced after accounting for multiple\ncomparisons, especially in subcortical regions. It raises\nanother viable possibility that brain morphometry was\nindeed comparable between exposed and unexposed ado-\nlescents. Deficits observed at early stages presumably di-\nminished along with brain development. There may still\nbe subtle deficits, but at a functional level, in the ab-\nsence of overt morphometric deficits. While most PCE/\nPTE studies have focused on brain or behavioral altera-\ntions in infants and preschoolers, the potential enduring\neffects on adolescence should be addressed in future stud-\nies in light of our current findings.\nAuthor Affiliations: Brown Center for the Study of Chil-\ndren at Risk, Women & Infants Hospital, Providence,\nRhode Island (Drs Liu, Lester, and Sheinkopf); Depart-\nments of Neurology and Neuroscience and Pediatrics (Ms\nNeyzi and Drs Kekatpure and Kosofsky), and Physiol-\nogy and Biophysics (Ms Neyzi and Dr Gracia), and HRH\nPrince Alwaleed Bin Talal Bin Abdulaziz Alsaud Insti-\ntute for Computational Biomedicine (Dr Gracia), Weill\nCornell Medical College, New York, New York.\nCorrespondence: Barry E.
