A\nprogressive decrease in the death rate from Hodgkin dis-\nease was observed over this period. The decrease in death\nrate was greatest among white patients. Patients who\nwere 55 years or older had the highest death rate. Analy-\nsis by geographic region showed decreases in each of the\nregions, with no significant difference among groups of\nstates with high and low incidences of acquired immune\ndeficiency syndrome. However, the decrease in the South\nwas approximately 35% greater than that in the North-\neast. In 1988the most significant difference in death rates\nbetween male and female patients was in the 35-54-year\nage group, whereas a significant difference in death rates\nbetween white and black patients was seen only in pa-\ntients who were 55 years of age or older. In summary,\nalthough there has been a significant reduction in deaths\nthe decreases observed have varied between sexes and\namong age groups, racial groups, and geographic regions.\nKey words: Hodgkin disease, mortality, epidemiology,\nlymphoma.\nFrom the *Division of Immunologic, Oncologic, and Hemato-\nlogic Diseases, National Center for Infectious Diseases, and the \u00a7Di-\nvision of Injury Control, National Center for Environmental Health\nand Injury Control, Centers for Disease Control, Public Health Ser-\nvice, United States Department of Health and Human Services, At-\nlanta, Georgia.\nt Current address: Division of HIV/AIDS, National Center for\nInfectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control, 1600 Clifton Road,\n$ Current address: Division of Viral and Rickettsia1 Diseases,\nNational Center for Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control,\nAddress for reprints: W.

In\nview of the increase in survival of those with Hodgkin\ndisease, we examined the epidemiologiccharacteristics\nassociated with the decreased death rate.\nwere proportionally the same between male and female\npatients. Although the death rate for black patients did\nnot decrease as much as that for white patients, the\ndecrease observed for black patients was surprising be-\ncause their prognosis generally has been poorer than\nthat for white patients.','' The poor prognosis among\nblack patients has been attributed to a high incidenceof\nthe pathologic subtypes generally associated with de-\ncreased survival. The decrease in death rate for black\npatients, despitethe prevalence of an unfavorable histo-\nlogicsubtype, could result from the following: (1)better\naccess to health care, (2) earlier misdiagnosis, (3) re-\nporting discrepancies, (4) inadequate studies concern-\ning Hodgkin disease in the black population, and (5) a\ndecrease in the incidence of Hodgkin disease in black\npatients. Themost likelyexplanation is that earlierstud-\nies reporting that black patients had a worse prognosis\nthan white patients were incomplete. The data have\nbeen reexamined recentlyand, when adjusted for histo-\nlogic subtype, no significant difference in death was\nfound between white and black patient^.'^ By compari-\nson, members of other minorities had only a modest\ndeclinein mortality rate. Plausible explanations for this\ninclude lack of access to health care and reporting dis-\ncrepancies.\nThe overall decrease in death rates for Hodgkin\ndisease was comparable to previously reported de-\ncrease~.','~\nThe declining incidence and mortality rate\nfor childhood Hodgkin disease have been recognized\nfor a long time.',2,'' It have been suggested by Szekely\nand Lee'5 and others' that this decline reflected im-\nprovements in economic conditions and the wide-\nspread use of antibiotics. In underdeveloped countries\nwith poor economic conditions and inadequate health\nTable 3.

This decline\ncould be attributed to a decreasing incidence of Hodg-\nkin disease in this age g r o ~ p ' ~ , ' ~\nand to improved diag-\nnosis. Several studies have reported that classification\nand diagnostic errors were more prevalent in the older\nage group, with Hodgkin disease often overdiag-\nnosed.14,17Consequently, as diagnostic accuracy im-\nproved, a correspondingdecreasein incidenceand mor-\ntality rate would be expected. This decrease also could\nresult from more aggressive treatment of the older pa-\ntient. The more modest decrease in mortality rate seen\nin the 15-34-year age group may be a consequence of\nan increased incidence of Hodgkin disease, which has\nbeen reported previously forthisparticular patient pop-\nulation.l7\nGeographic differences in mortality rate for Hodg-\nkin diseasehave been reported previ~usly.~,~\nOur study\nnot only confirmed these earlier findings,but also dem-\nonstrated geographicvariations in the decreasesin mor-\ntality rates. Although decreases in deaths were seen in\nall geographic regions, there was an approximately\n35% greater decrease in the South compared with the\nNortheast. The magnitude of this difference was sur-\nprising because, as strategiesfor the treatment of Hodg-\nkin disease evolved, one would expect the decreases in\nmortality rate to be more uniform in the various geo-\ngraphicregions. Aside from reporting differences,\" one\nexplanation for the geographic variations may be the\navailability of tertiary care. Davis et al.I9 recently re-\nported that the survival rate for Hodgkin disease was\nsignificantly lower in community-based hospitals with\napproved cancer care programs as compared with com-\nprehensive cancer centers.\nAnalysis of deaths in 1988 confirmed previous re-\nports concerning age, sex, geographic, and racial differ-\nencesin patients with Hodgkin disease.' Additionally, a\nsignificant difference was observed in the death rate\nbetween male and female patients in the 35-54-year\nage group, as was a significantdifference in death rates\nin the patients who were 55 years and older. However,\nthese findings may reflect differences in incidence and\nresponse to treatment.\nSince the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, there\nhave been numerous reports regarding cause of Hodg-\nkin disease in people with AIDS or at risk for AIDS.20-27\nIn the 1988 data for multiple causes of death, 2% of\npatients with Hodgkin disease as a cause of death also\nwere listed as having HIV infection. When examinedby\nage group and geographic region, the numbers of\ndeaths were too small for analysis; nevertheless, they\nmay be suggestive of future trends. The lack of evi-\ndence of cross-reacting antibodies to prototype strains\nof human T-lymphotropic virus type 1, human T-lym-\nphotropic virus type 11, or HIV-I in plasma specimens\ndrawn from patients with Hodgkin disease before the\nAIDS epidemic suggests that classic Hodgkin disease\ndoes not result from an infection with a known human\nretrovirus or a closely related agent.28However, pa-\ntients with both Hodgkin disease and an HIV infection\ngenerally have a poorer prognosis than those with HIV\nwhich may reflect sequelae of the\ncombined functional immunologic defects resulting\nfrom Hodgkin d i ~ e a s e * ~ , ~ ~\nand HIV infection.\nDespite the increasingincidence of HIV infectionin\nassociation with Hodgkin disease, the lack of increases\nin Hodgkin disease in geographic areas with a high in-\ncidence of HIV suggests that the association of HIV in-\nfection with Hodgkin disease reflects the overall in-\ncrease of HIV infection in the population and not a\ncausal relationship.28\nReferences\n1.
