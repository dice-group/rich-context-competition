Feather\nSchool of Psychology, The Flinders University of South Australia, Adelaide.\nThis article reports on a confirmatory analytic study of the Bachman revision (1970) of Rosenberg's Self-Esteem\nScale (1965) that was used in the Australian Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ALSA). Participants comprised 1,087\nelderly people aged between 70 and 103 years (mean 77 years). Five competing factor models were tested with\nLISREL8. The best-fitting model was a nested one, with a General Self-esteem second-order factor and two first-\norder factors, Positive Self-regard and Usefulness/Competence. This model was validated with data from a later\nwave of ALSA. Usefulness and competence have received little attention in the gerontological literature to date. Pre-\nliminary results indicate that usefulness/competence may be an important predictor of well-being. Further work is\nrequired on the relationships among usefulness, competence, self-esteem, and well-being in elderly people.\nSELF-ESTEEM has a well-recognized relationship to\npsychological well-being (Blascovich & Tomaka,\n1991). Self-esteem can be conceptualized as self-regard, an\nevaluation of one's worthiness (Rosenberg, Schooler,\nSchoenbach, & Rosenberg, 1995). A number of scales have\nbeen designed to measure self-esteem (Blascovich &\nTomaka, 1991), but there has been little research into the\npsychometric properties of these scales, particularly using\ndata from elderly people. The aim of this research was to\nassess the psychometric properties and.factor structure of a\nself-esteem scale suitable for the study of elderly adults,\nthe Bachman revision (Bachman, 1970) of Rosenberg's\nSelf-Esteem Scale (RSE; Rosenberg, 1965).\nRosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale (Rosenberg, 1965) is the\nmost widely used measure of self-esteem (Blascovich &\nTomaka, 1991). It was designed for research into adoles-\ncent self-esteem (Rosenberg, 1965). However, it has been\nused in well-being research on all age groups, and is con-\nsidered to be an appropriate measure of self-esteem in the\nelderly (Breytspraak & George, 1979). Recent studies that\nhave used it with older adults include those of Duffy and\nRosenberg (1965) designed the Self-Esteem Scale as a\nunidimensional measure of global self-esteem. Other re-\nsearchers, building on his work, subsequently designed\nscales to measure different dimensions of self-esteem and\nin some cases domain-specific self-esteem (Blascovich &\nTomaka, 1991). A number of principal components factor\nanalyses performed in the 1970s supported Rosenberg's\nview that the RSE was unidimensional. However, some\ninvestigators identified two highly correlated factors, posi-\ntive and negative self-esteem (reviews in Blascovich &\nsuch as research into the psychological impact of unem-\nployment, positive self-esteem and negative self-esteem\nhave been used as separate variables (Feather & Bond,\nZeller (1979) claimed that the putative two-factor structure\nwas likely to be a statistical artifact due to response set,\nsince some items are positively worded while others are\nnegatively worded. They concluded that, instead of positive\nand negative self-esteem, the two factors indicated by prin-\ncipal components analysis represented a global self-esteem\nfactor and systematic error variance due to the valence of\nthe item wording. The negatively worded items in the Self-\nEsteem Scale seem to describe the opposite poles, on the\nsame continuum, to the positively worded ones rather than\na conceptually different dimension. For instance, a posi-\ntively worded item (\"I take a positive attitude towards my-\nself) is at the opposite pole to a negatively worded item\n(\"At times I think I am no good at all\"), both items refer-\nring to evaluation of worthiness. This could explain the\nhigh correlation between the two putative factors.\nIn the last few years there have been major developments\nin factor analysis. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), in\nwhich a theoretically derived factor structure is tested for\nits fit to the data, is now commonly used. Shahani, Dip-\nboye, and Phillips (1990) used confirmatory factor analysis\non the original RSE and reported that a structure with two\nfirst-order factors, self-derogation and self-enhancement\n(their terms for negative and positive self-esteem), was su-\nperior to a unidimensional one. Recently, Rosenberg\nseemed to have departed from his earlier unidimensional\nviews concerning his scale and to have accepted the two-\nfactor model ascribed to by Shahani et al. (Rosenberg et al.,\n1995). A recent CFA study of the RSE was conducted by\nMarsh (1996), who used a modified seven-item version. He\nargued that his results supported the reasoning of Carmines\nand Zeller (1979), that the second putative factor was a sta-\ntistical artifact due to response set. Therefore, the evidence\nis equivocal and the structure of the Self-Esteem Scale has\nremained unclear.\nThe present study does not examine the original Self-\nEsteem Scale (Rosenberg, 1965) but the Bachman revision,\na scale that arose from a large set of personality items used\nin the Youth in Transition project (Bachman, 1970). The\nitems of the revised scale are shown in Table 1. To date, the\nBachman revision has not been subjected to confirmatory\nfactor analysis. The revision is similar to Rosenberg's Self-\nEsteem Scale, both consisting of 10 items. However, the re-\nvision is an abbreviated composite of two measures, the\nSelf-Esteem Scale and a 10-item attitude scale devised by\nCobb, Brooks, Kasl, and Connelly (1966, in Bachman &\nO'Malley, 1977) for a study of adult workers who had\nchanged jobs. In the process of reducing the composite\nscale to 10 items, four items from the Self-Esteem Scale\nand six from the scale of Cobb et al. were eliminated. The\nCobb et al. items that were retained (items 7, 8, 9, and 10 in\nTable 1) were said to be \"similar in content\" to the Self-\nEsteem Scale items that were replaced (Bachman & O'Mal-\nscale as a unidimensional measure of global self-esteem.\nThis view has been accepted in subsequent research that\nhas used the revision (Bachman & O'Malley, 1986; Bynner,\nO'Malley, & Bachman, 1981; Rosenberg & Rosenberg,\n1978). However, the wording of the four replacement scale\nitems emphasizes usefulness and competence, while the\nfour that were replaced (scale of Rosenberg, 1965) describe\npositive self-regard. Hence, there is reason to suppose the\nfactor structure of the Bachman revision is different from\nthat of the original RSE.\nThe Bachman revision, (called RSE-B subsequently for\nthe sake of brevity) has been used extensively in research\nreliability of 0.75 (Cronbach's a) and good construct valid-\nIt was noted above that the four replacement items con-\ntain references to usefulness and competence. Specifically,\nitems 8 and 9 in the RSE-B (see Table 1) contain words re-\nof Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale\nItem\n1. I feel that I'm a person of worth, at least on an equal plane with others.\n2. I feel that I have a number of good qualities.\n3. I am able to do things as well as most other people.\n4. I feel that I do not have much to be proud of.\n5. I take a positive attitude towards myself.\n6. I think I am no good at all.\n*7. I am a useful person to have around.\n*8. I feel I can't do anything right.\n*9. When I do a job, I do it well.\n*10. I feel that my life is not very useful.\nNote: Scale items marked * were added by Bachman (1970).\nlated to competence, whereas items 7 and 10 explicitly\nrefer to usefulness. Of the six items retained from the RSE,\nitem 3 seems to refer to competence and item 4 to achieve-\nment, a concept related to usefulness and competence. The\nreferences to usefulness could make the revised scale espe-\ncially applicable to the assessment of self-esteem in the el-\nderly, since to feel useful is thought to be important to the\npsychological well-being of this group (Butler, 1985; Ryff,\n6) refer to positive self-regard, the essence of self-esteem\n(Rosenberg et al., 1995). We therefore argue that the RSE-\nB may contain a usefulness/competence factor as well as a\nself-esteem factor.\nTo summarize the argument so far, two possible factor an-\nalytic models for the RSE-B could be derived from the pub-\nlished literature to date, which has assumed that the RSE-B\nrepresents the same construct as the RSE. The first possible\nmodel comprises a unidimensional structure, measuring\nonly self-esteem (Bachman & O'Malley, 1986; Bynner et\nmodel comprises two first-order factors, self-derogation and\nself-enhancement (following Shahani et al., 1990). A third\nmodel, derived from the history of the scale, in which an at-\ntitude scale designed for adult workers was imported into\nthe existing self-esteem scale, and from an inspection of the\nwording of the items, comprises two first-order factors, posi-\ntive self-regard and usefulness/competence.\nWhen performing confirmatory factor analysis, it is con-\nsidered good practice to develop a number of competing\nmodels and see which best fits the data (Hertzog, 1990;\nwas used in this research. The first two competing hypothe-\nses were as follows.\nHypothesis I. The RSE-B is unidimensional and measures a\nfactor called global self-esteem. The factor structure to test\nthis hypothesis was labeled model 1. All 10 items were spec-\nified to load onto the global self-esteem factor.\nHypothesis 2. The RSE-B has a two-factor structure, the fac-\ntors being self-enhancement and self-derogation. The factor\nstructure to test this hypothesis was labeled model 2. Items\nenhancement factor, and items 4, 6, 8,* and 10* on the self-\nderogation factor (* refers to items added by Bachman,\nModel 3 was derived from the history of the scale and\nfrom inspection of the wording of the scale items. The next\ncompeting hypothesis was:\nHypothesis 3. The RSE-B has a two-factor structure, the fac-\ntors being positive self-regard and usefulness/competence.\nThe first factor was labeled positive self-regard rather than\nself-esteem to distinguish it from the general self-esteem\nfactor of models 4 and 5 (see below), but positive self-regard\nis conceptualized in this article as equivalent to self-esteem.\nItems 1, 2, 5, and 6 were specified to load on the positive\nusefulness/competence factor.\nWe also tested two models, each of which included a sec-\nond-order factor. Second-order factors have been identified\nin addition to first-order factors in confirmatory factor anal-\nyses of a number of personality scales in recent years. The\nsecond-order factor is usually considered to be superordi-\nnate to the first-order factors--in other words, to represent\na construct common to the first-order factors. For this rea-\nson, models with second-order factors are often described\nas hierarchical. For instance, Liang and Bollen (1983)\nfound that Lawton's (1975) Philadelphia Geriatric Center\nMorale Scale had a second-order \"subjective well-being\"\nfactor, and McCallum, Mackinnon, Simons, and Simons\n(1995) found a scale factor \"depression\" in Radloff's\n(1977) Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression\nScale. However, a second-order factor could also be non-\nsuperordinate but simply the factor common to all the items\nof the scale. It is reasonable to state that any particular scale\nis designed primarily to measure one major construct, and\nso all the items of the scale should be related to this con-\nstruct. If this were not the case, researchers would use two\nor more different scales rather than one. Therefore, it may\nbe the case that scales with at least two first-order factors\ncontain a general factor shared by all the items in addition\nto more specific factors each related only to some items.\nThe last two models tested were similar to models 2 and\n3, with the addition of the second-order factor. The hy-\npotheses therefore were:\nHypothesis 4. The RSE-B has a nested structure, with two\nfirst-order factors (self-derogation and self-enhancement)\nand one second-order factor (general self-esteem). The use\nof the term nested rather than hierarchical will be explained\nlater. The factor structure to test Hypothesis 4 was labeled\nmodel 4. It differed from model 2 in that all 10 items were\nspecified to load on the general self-esteem factor in addition\nto their loading on the specificfirst-orderfactors.\nHypothesis 5. The RSE-B has a nested structure, with two\nfirst-order factors (positive self-regard and usefulness/com-\npetence) and one second-order factor (general self-esteem).\nThe factor structure to test Hypothesis 5 was labeled model\n5. It differed from model 3 in that all items were also speci-\nfied to load onto the general self-esteem factor.\nThese models are structurally similar to one tested by\nGustaffson and Balke (1993), who suggested the term\nnested because the statistical procedure to test a nested\nmodel involves the extraction of the first-order factors from\nthe residuals produced by extracting the second-order factor\nfrom the covariance matrix. However, whereas the first-\norder factors of Gustaffson and Balke's study were speci-\nfied to be orthogonal, in the present study they were mod-\neled as correlated. This is because we theorized that the\nfirst-order factors would be related, possibly in a causal\nsense, to each other, with usefulness/competence influenc-\ning positive self-regard. A recent article by Mutran, Reitzes,\nBratton, and Fernandez (1997) concluded that competence\nhas a strong influence on self-esteem, which provides sup-\nport for such a causal relationship among the factors in the\nRSE-B. In spite of the difference between our model speci-\nfication and that of Gustaffson and Balke (1993), we feel\nthat the term nested is appropriate for our models because\nthe analytical procedure used is basically the same.\nIn similar analyses previously reported, the term hierar-\nchical has sometimes been used (e.g., Liang & Bollen,\nture the first-order factors are correlated with the second-\norder factor and the individual items do not load directly\nonto the second-order factor. A hierarchical structure was\nrejected in this case for two reasons. First, the second-order\nfactor, general self-esteem, could not be superordinate to\npositive self-regard because these two constructs are con-\nceptually equivalent. Second, we thought that general self-\nesteem was common to all the scale items, and therefore\neach item was specified to load onto the second-order factor\nas well as one of the first-order factors.\nIn summary, five competing models were constructed for\nthe Bachman revision (1970) of the Self-Esteem Scale\n(Rosenberg, 1965). Two of the models contained a factor,\nusefulness/competence, that had not previously been asso-\nciated with this scale. The first three models contained\nsingle-order factors and the final two were nested models\nthat also contained a second-order factor. The data were de-\nrived from a longitudinal study of ageing, and the models\nwere validated with data collected 2 years after the first\nwave of the survey. It was expected that model 5 would\nprovide the best fit to the data.\nMETHOD\nParticipants and Procedure\nData for this study were provided by 1,087 elderly peo-\nsubsample of the Australian Longitudinal Study of Ageing\n(ALSA; Centre for Ageing Studies, 1992). The ALSA is a\nmultidimensional, multidisciplinary research project that\naims to increase understanding of how social, biomedical,\nbehavioral, economic, and environmental factors are related\nto age-related changes in the health and well-being of el-\nhensive baseline interviews, covering a broad range of de-\nmographic, health, social, and psychological issues, were\nconducted with 2,087 elderly adults living in the Adelaide\nmetropolitan area. The ALSA also included a series of self-\ncomplete questionnaires, filled in by the participants after\nthe interviews, which included the self-esteem scale. Longi-\ntudinal follow-up occurred 2 years later. Details of the\nALSA have been published elsewhere (Centre for Ageing\nThe target sample for the ALSA (N = 3,623) was ran-\ndomly generated from the South Australian Electoral Roll\nand was stratified by sex and 5-year age cohorts from 70 up\nto the age of 85 years and over. Older males were oversam-\npled, as were the oldest groups, in an attempt to obtain rea-\nsonable numbers of each of these in subsequent waves of\nthe study. It could be argued that the stratified nature of the\nsampling plan should have been taken into account so as to\nminimize biases in subsequent analyses. However, it has\nbeen found by Mawby et al. (1996), who used the same\nsample of 1,799 people, that there were no significant dif-\nferences in income, ADLS, IADLS, hospitalizations or self-\nrated health between analyses using raw data and those\nweighted to adjust for stratification. To test for possible bi-\nases in self-esteem scores, both weighted and unweighted\ndata were used to analyze the differences in the mean\nscores for the four age groups and for men and women (see\nResults). The values of mean scores for each cell were vir-\ntually identical. However, the very small differences be-\ntween age groups became significant because of the very\nlarge number of cases estimated through the weighting pro-\ncedure. Therefore, unweighted data were used for the factor\nanalyses and subsequent analyses.\nOf the 3,263 people approached for the first wave of the\nALSA, 558 were ineligible for reasons such as death, incor-\nrect age or address, being outside the geographic region,\nand language difficulties. Of the 2,705 in the eligible sam-\n(28.8%) refused outright, the 2-hour length of the interview\nand the long-term involvement sought by the ALSA design-\ners being the major deterrents to participation. The other\nmajor reason for nonparticipation was illness of self or\nspouse (16.2%). Spouses older than 65 and other household\nresidents over the age of 70 were also invited to participate,\nresulting in another 610 participants and hence a total\nALSA sample of 2,087. This number included people liv-\ning in institutional care as well as in the community. How-\never, we were interested only in community-dwelling peo-\nsampling frame and response statistics have been published\nby the Centre for Ageing Studies (1992). Of the first-wave\nor could not be contacted at the 2-year follow-up, leaving\n1,804 people. One hundred twenty-five refused to partici-\npate again, resulting in a retention rate of 93% (N= 1,679).\nThe self-esteem data used in this report were obtained\nfrom the optional self-complete questionnaire. Consequently,\nfewer people answered items from this questionnaire (N =\npared to those who took part in the interview (N = 1,799 and\nattempting the self-complete questionnaires) who fully com-\npleted all the self-esteem items at the baseline survey of the\nALSA and 875 at the follow-up (91%), and they comprised\nthe subsamples for the analyses reported here.\nDescriptive statistics from the baseline data collection on\ndemographic data and health and function for the full sam-\nple, for the sample that completed the full self-esteem\nscale, and for those who completed only some optional\nquestionnaire items are shown in Table 2. In addition to the\nvariables shown, there were no differences in the propor-\ntions of male respondents, the percentages being 54.2%,\nTable 2 shows there were few differences between the\ngroups. The full self-esteem group was younger, had higher\nincome, more education, fewer ADLs and IADLs, better\nself-rated health, less depression, and better cognitive func-\ntion than the other two groups. The differences between the\nfull sample and full self-esteem samples were less than\nthose between the full self-esteem and partial optional\nquestionnaire samples. However, the differences in every\ncase were small.\nMaterials\nThe Bachman revision (1970) of the Self-Esteem Scale\nTable 2.

ADLs and IADLs are measures of everyday\nfunction: ADLs = number of Activities of Daily Living problems, IADLs\n= number of Instrumental Activities of Daily Living problems (Duke Uni-\nversity, 1978).

Depression was measured by\nthe Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale\nPhiladelphia Geriatric Center Morale Scale (Lawton, 1975),\nand perceived control by items from the Expectancy of\nControl subscale of the Desired Control Measure (Reid &\nZeigler, 1981). Further details of the adapted scales used in\nthe ALSA can be found in Luszcz (1996). It was found dur-\ning data analysis that depression and morale had skewed\ndistributions, so transformed scores were used in subse-\nquent analyses. For depression, the scores underwent a log-\narithmic transformation, and for morale reflected and\nsquare rooted scores were used. Finally, two subscales of\nthe Adelaide Activities Profile (Clark & Bond, 1995),\nnamely, the Domestic Chores and Home Maintenance sub-\nscales, were used to measure functional ability to partici-\npate in everyday activities.\nThe participants completed the interview and other scales\nin their own homes. The initial data preparation was per-\nformed with SPSS-X (SPSS/Norusis, 1993) and the confir-\nmatory factor analysis using LISREL for Windows (Joreskog\nAnalysis\nPRELIS2, the preprocessor for LISREL8 (Joreskog &\nSorbom, 1993), was used to generate the matrices for sub-\nsequent analysis by LISREL8. All RSE-B items were de-\nclared to be ordinal, because there were only a small num-\nber of response categories and the intervals between\nadjacent categories could not be assumed to be equal. Ac-\ncordingly, the correlation matrix generated consisted of\npolychoric correlations (Joreskog & Sorbom, 1993). The\nevaluation of goodness of fit was performed by LISREL8\nwith the generally weighted least-squares method, using the\nasymptotic covariance matrix.\nRESULTS\nThe mean total self-esteem score was 4.14 (SD .55). In-\n(item 6), with standard deviations between 0.73 (item 2)\nand 1.20 (item 4). There were statistically significant differ-\n.01. Post-hoc Scheffe analyses showed that people aged 85\nyears or more had a lower mean self-esteem score (4.01,\nage groups (M 4.16, SD .56), but the differences were very\nsmall. There were no significant differences in the mean\nscores of men compared to women. As mentioned earlier,\nanalyses using weighted data produced results virtually\nidentical to those using unweighted data (the equivalent\n4.18) so unweighted data have been used for all subsequent\nanalyses.\nThe polychoric correlation matrix is shown in Table 3.\nConfirmatory Factor Analyses\nIn CFA, the assessment of the fit of a model is based on\nthe relative importance attached to the various indices pro-\nduced by the program used, a debate that is at present unre-\nsolved (for some points of view, see Bentler, 1990; Bollen,\nconsider that the best indicators are the root-mean-square\nerror of approximation (RMSEA), which should be below\n.05 and as low as possible, and the probability that the\nRMSEA is less than .05, this probability being as close as\nTable 3. Polychoric Correlation Matrix of RSE-B\nItem Item Item Item Item Item Item Item Item\nRMSEA and a higher p value indicate that one model is su-\nperior to another. One model is also considered better than\nanother if its x2 value is lower, the probability of this x2\nvalue is higher, the x2 df ratio is lower, the root-mean-\nsquare residuals index (RMR) is lower, and the goodness-\nof-fit indices are higher, preferably close to 1.00 (Joreskog\n& Sorbom, 1993), than the values of the other model. How-\never, the final determination of best fit should be theoreti-\ncally based as well as statistically driven (Bollen, 1990;\nIn the analyses reported here, no modifications were per-\nformed on the models in the interests of achieving a better\nfit. This decision was taken because it was thought more\nimportant to maintain theoretical consistency than to use\nthe results of model testing to adjust the models in order to\nimprove the fit, the latter being a statistically driven rather\nthan theoretically driven approach. The results of the con-\nfirmatory factor analyses are summarized in Table 4.\nTable 4 shows that the only models that are well fitting\naccording to the RMSEA criteria (RMSEA < .05, and p of\nRMSEA > .05) are models 4 and 5. Model 2 (the first two-\nfactor model) is superior to model 1 (the unidimensional\nmodel) in every respect except PGFI (parsimony goodness\nof fit), where the results are the same. Model 2 is also supe-\nrior to model 3 (the competing two-factor model). Model 4\n(the first nested model) is superior to model 2 in every re-\nspect except PGFI, and the fit is excellent according to all\nthe criteria.

However, some of the factor loadings for model 4\nwere not meaningful, whereas all loadings for model 5\nwere meaningful (see Table 5). The determination of the\nfit of a model should, in addition to the other criteria,\nbe based on the meaningfulness of the factor loadings\nTable 4.

On balance, model 5 was\nthought to be the best-fitting model. In most cases the first-\norder loadings were high, and in all cases they were sig-\nnificant. The sum of the first-order factor variances ex-\nceeded the variance of the second-order factor. In other\nwords, the contribution of the first-order factors to the fac-\ntor structure was greater than that of the second-order fac-\ntor. This means that the first-order factors are clearly iden-\ntified by the analysis, given that the second-order factor\nhas already been extracted. The phi coefficient (the corre-\nlation between the first-order factors) for model 5 was .84\nCross-Validation\nThe factor structures of models 4 and 5, the models that\nprovided the best fits to the baseline ALSA data, were vali-\ndated with the follow-up data obtained 2 years later. The re-\nsults of cross-validation are shown in Table 4. Model 5 was\nsuperior on all the criteria except RMR, where model 4 was\nmarginally superior. A number of the factor loadings for\nmodel 4 were again unstable, whereas all the loadings for\nmodel 5 were meaningful (see Table 5). It was concluded\nfrom the analyses of both data sets that model 5 provided\nthe best fit to the data.\nTable 5.

Sub-\nscale scores were divided by their number of items, to give\na possible range from 1 to 5. This was done to enable com-\nparisons to be made with the full scale scores. The reliabil-\nity of the positive self-regard subscale was 0.67, and that of\nthe usefulness/competence subscale was 0.69 (Cronbach's\na), values that are quite adequate for scales with only a few\nitems (Nunnally, 1978). The subscale score for positive\nboth cases (range 1-5).\nAs a final test of the construct validity of the first-order\nfactors, the subscales were correlated with three variables\nthat have been associated with self-esteem, namely depres-\nsion, morale, and personal control (Andrews & Robinson,\n1991), and also with functional ability. The resulting corre-\nlations of the full self-esteem scale with these variables\nwere all significant, p < .001 (see Table 6).\nIf two factors are truly distinct, it would be expected that\nthey would be differentially related to relevant variables\n(Carmines & Zeller, 1979). Following the procedure used\nby Carmines and Zeller in their factor analysis of the Self-\nEsteem Scale (Rosenberg, 1965), correlations were com-\nputed between each subscale and the variables mentioned\nabove. These correlations are also shown in Table 6. Analy-\nses of the differences between the correlations, using the\nmethod for determining the significance of the difference\nbetween dependent correlations described by Cohen and\nCohen (1983), showed there were no differences on depres-\nsion and control for the first-wave subsample or on domes-\ntic chores for the third-wave subsample, but there were dif-\nferences between all the other correlations. Because some\nof the correlations were noticeably larger in the third-wave\nTable 6.

However, the Bachman revision\n(1970) is a different scale, with four items not in the original\nscale, all construed as referring to self-perceived usefulness\nor competence. In this study, the unidimensional model\n(model 1) was the worst fitting of all five models tested.\nThe model based on the division of the scale into self-\nderogation and self-enhancement (model 2) provided a bet-\nter fit to the data than the unidimensional model, but not as\ngood as later models. If one model demonstrates a better fit\nthan another, the superior model is the only one that can be\naccepted as valid. We therefore agree with Carmines and\nself-enhancement are not separate factors.\nThe fit of the third model, with two first-order factors,\npositive self-regard and usefulness/competence, was about\nthe same as model 1 but not as good as either model 2, 4, or\n5, and was therefore rejected. The fourth model tested, a\nnested model with a second-order general self-esteem factor\nin addition to the first-order factors self-derogation and self-\nenhancement, provided a better fit than the previous three\nmodels, but not as good as model 5, so it too was rejected.\nFurthermore, model 4 was also unacceptable because the\nfactor loadings were not meaningful. Cross-validation veri-\nfied that model 5 was superior to model 4.\nModel 5 was a nested model, with positive self-regard\nand usefulness/competence as first-order factors and a sec-\nond-order factor, general self-esteem. The finding that a\nnested model with a second-order factor provides the best\nfit is consistent with previous studies of other scales in\nwhich a general factor has been found (e.g., Liang &\nRSE-B contains a factor common to all items as well as\ntheir specific first-order factors. It could generally be ar-\ngued that all scales that are not unidimensional should con-\ntain such a common core, and therefore a nested model is\nthe most appropriate one to test with CFA.\nThe people in this study had high scores on both the pos-\nitive self-regard and usefulness/competence subscales. It\nseems that perceived usefulness is not necessarily a func-\ntion of economic productivity, since the people in this study\nhad been retired for an average of 12 years. It may be mis-\nguided to link usefulness with economic productivity when\ndiscussing elderly people. On the other hand, the respon-\ndents may have adjusted psychologically to any negative ef-\nfects of retirement (see Lazarus & DeLongis, 1983, for a\ndiscussion of adjustment mechanisms in the elderly). These\nhigh scores, however, may not accurately reflect the wider\npopulation of elderly Adelaide people, given that the re-\nsponse rate was not as high as would have been wished.\nNevertheless, outright refusals comprised just over a quar-\nter of those people initially approached, and this was likely\nto have been due to the long-term time commitment re-\nquested and the length of the interview and other aspects of\nthe questionnaire. Therefore, we concluded that the data are\na reasonable reflection of the population from which the\nsample was drawn.\nThe usefulness/competence factor has not previously\nbeen identified in studies of self-esteem. However, the con-\ncepts of usefulness, competence, achievement, and produc-\ntive activity have lately received increasing attention in the\ngerontological literature. For example, Stevens (1993)\nfound that involvement with others was significantly related\nto feeling useful. Mclntosh and Danigelis (1995) found an\nassociation between informal volunteering (such as per-\nforming chores for friends) and well-being in adults over\nfound a strong association between competence, measured\nby a single item of self-assessment, and self-esteem. Re-\nsearch on younger adults has also shown a relationship of\nsense of structure and purpose in the use of time (Bond &\nlated to usefulness. The relationships among usefulness,\ncompetence, purpose, and self-esteem in older people de-\nserves further exploration. The possible utility of the use-\nfulness/competence subscale for future research is indicated\nby its reliability, which is quite high for a scale with so few\nitems. The scale could be further developed by the addition\nof other relevant items reflecting different aspects of useful-\nness, competence, and achievement.\nAs a further test of the robustness of the factor structure,\nthe differences in the correlations of the factors with other\nvariables relevant to self-esteem were tested for signifi-\ncance. These variables were depression, morale, personal\ncontrol, and functional ability. Functional ability was as-\nsessed by two subscales, measuring the extent to which\npeople carried out normal domestic chores and home main-\ntenance. The findings indicated that the factors were con-\nceptually distinct. Usefulness/competence had a stronger\nrelationship to the indicator variables than did positive self-\nregard. The possible causal pathways here also deserve fur-\nther investigation. Usefulness/competence may be a good\npredictor of both well-being and personal control. More\nwork could also be done on the association between useful-\nness/competence and functional ability. There could be a\ncausal pathway from functional ability to well-being via\nusefulness/competence and/or positive self-regard.\nOne puzzling finding was that some of the correlations re-\nferred to in the previous paragraph were substantially higher\nin the third-wave subsample than in the first wave. One pos-\nsible explanation was that the subsamples were not the same,\nsince the first wave contained over 200 people who were not\nin the third wave. However, even when the correlations were\nrecalculated for only those first wave respondents who were\nalso in the third wave, the results were virtually identical to\nthose using the full subsample. Two details should be noted.\nThe trends are the same for both waves, and the relationships\nwith functional activity are more stable than those with well-\nbeing and control. Perhaps the strengthened correlations had\nsomething to do with the respondents being 2 years older and\nmore familiar with the inventories. It is not clear why the fac-\ntors appear to become more differentiated. Overall, the vali-\ndation analyses strengthen support for the conceptual dis-\ntinctness of the two factors.\nIn summary, this study has demonstrated that the Bach-\nman revision (1970) of the Self-Esteem Scale (Rosenberg,\n1965) has a nested structure, with a second-order scale fac-\ntor in addition to two first-order factors, usefulness/compe-\ntence and positive self-regard. The newly identified useful-\nness/competence subscale, a six-item scale with adequate\nreliability, could be further developed and gainfully em-\nployed in future research on elderly people. Little work has\nbeen done so far into the importance of feeling useful and\ncompetent to the well-being of elderly people. This study\nsupports the view that feeling useful and competent may be\nrelated in important ways to the self-esteem of older adults\n1989). Preliminary results also indicate that usefulness/\ncompetence may be an important predictor of well-being.\nFurther research is required to clarify the relationships\namong usefulness, competence, and self-esteem in elderly\npeople and the ways in which they affect well-being.\n"
