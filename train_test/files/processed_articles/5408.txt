A key motivating\nfactor for development of tenecteplase was to\nproduce a molecular variant of rt-PA that would\nreduce the risk of symptomatic intracranial hem-\norrhage (ICH) while retaining clinical efficacy. The\nphase II component employed an adaptive sequen-\ntial dose selection procedure to choose a preferred\ndose of tenecteplase, using an early (24 h) assess-\nment of major neurological improvement (MNI)\nbalanced against occurrence of symptomatic ICH.\nOnce a preferred tenecteplase dose was estab-\nlished, it was moved forward in the phase III\ncomponent to compare with standard-dose rt-PA.\nDecision rules comparing the selected tenecte-\nplase dose and rt-PA on safety and efficacy\noutcomes were devised to yield a clear recom-\nmendation to either stop the trial for futility at\nthe end of phase II, or continue into phase III.\nThe trial was prematurely terminated for slow\nenrollment after 112 patients had been random-\nAt that point, the proposal to include patients\nenrolled in the phase II portion of the trial in the\nphase III analysis had not received regulatory\napproval because of concerns regarding control of\nthe type I error rate.\nAlthough the trial results were insufficient to\nestablish promise or futility [1], its novel adaptive\ndesign, with substantial provision for the control of\ntype I error, is nevertheless of interest, given\ncurrent discussion of draft FDA guidelines on\nadaptive designs [2]. This article has two goals.\nThe first is to review the key design features of the\ntrial, and the design and results of its comprehen-\nsive type I error rate simulation studies. The second\nis to discuss issues raised during the regulatory\nreview of the design, which focused on the type I\nerror simulations, and their implications for gain-\ning approval for use of this type of adaptive design\nin the future.\nThe TNK-S2B Design\nThe TNK-S2B trial incorporated three main design\nfeatures: (1) a sequential selection procedure for\nchoosing one tenecteplase dose from among three\nthe sequential elimination of inferior dose arms,\npotentially leading to a dose selection decision at\nan early stage of phase II; (2) at the end of phase\nII, a preliminary comparison of the clinical efficacy\nand safety endpoints from patients treated with the\nselected dose of tenecteplase to those from\npatients treated with rt-PA, to determine promise\nor futility for continuing into phase III; and (3)\nif the results were promising, continuation of\nthe study, with additional clinical sites, to com-\npare the selected dose of tenecteplase with\nrt-PA in phase III, treating the decisions at the\nend of phase II as the first interim analysis of\nphase III. We provide details about each of these\nfeatures.\nSequential selection procedure for the best\ndose of tenecteplase\nThe selection procedure was a truncated Levin-\nRobbins sequential elimination procedure [3,4]\nbased on a rapid-response, ordered trichotomous\noutcome determined within 24 h of randomiza-\ntion. The best category was MNI, defined as a !8-\npoint improvement from baseline on the NIH\nStroke Scale [5] or a score of 0 at 24 h after stroke\nonset. The worst category was symptomatic ICH\nwithin 24 h of stroke onset. The intermediate\ncategory was neither MNI nor ICH (NEI). Patients\nwere randomized in permuted blocks of size 4\nmatched by clinical site (quadruplets) to rt-PA or\none of the three doses of tenecteplase. Although\npatients were also randomized concurrently to\nrt-PA to preserve the blinding and to eliminate\nother possible temporal biases, only the tenecte-\nplase arms were involved in the selection proce-\ndure. Once a rapid response was obtained from\neach of the three patients assigned to the tenecte-\nplase doses in a matched quadruplet, their data\nwere entered into an ongoing sequential cumulative\nsum scoring system. This added the value 2 to the\ncumulative sum for any dose arm for a rapid-\nresponse outcome of MNI, the value 1 for a rapid-\nresponse outcome of NEI, and the value 0 for a\nrapid-response outcome of ICH. The first time the\ncumulative sum for any arm(s) with the largest sum\nwas (were) 6 points ahead of the cumulative sum for\nany arm(s) with the smallest sum, the arm(s) with\nthe smallest sum was (were) to be eliminated from\nthe study, meaning that those arms were no longer\nto be considered candidates for selection and\npatients were no longer to be randomized to\nthose arms. If one dose arm was eliminated at this\ntime, patients were to be randomized to the\nremaining arms (and to rt-PA), and the procedure\nwas to proceed with their corresponding cumula-\ntive sums continued at their current tallies, until a\nsecond and final arm was eliminated. Once the\nsecond arm had been eliminated, the procedure\nTNK-S2B trial of tenecteplase versus alteplase 399\nwas to terminate and the remaining arm was to be\nselected as the preferred dose of tenecteplase. If\ninitially two arms were eliminated simultaneously,\nthe procedure was to terminate then and select the\nremaining arm as the preferred dose of tenecte-\nplase. If dose selection occurred after complete\nobservation of the rapid responses from fewer than\n100 tenecteplase-matched sets, randomization con-\ntinued to either the selected dose of tenecteplase or\nrt-PA until a total of 100 patients on each treatment\nhad been randomized, at which time the clinical\nassessment for promise or futility was to be con-\nducted. If the dose selection occurred after com-\nplete observation of the rapid responses from\nrandomization was to stop and the clinical assess-\nment for promise or futility was to take place then.\nIf no dose selection had yet occurred after complete\nobservation of the rapid responses from 150\ntenecteplase-matched sets, the procedure was to\nbe truncated, i.e., randomization would stop, and\nthe dose selection was to be completed in conjunc-\ntion with the clinical assessment for promise or\nfutility as described below. The selection criterion\nof a lead of 6 was chosen to achieve a probability of\ncorrect selection of !0.8 under the design alternative\nresponse outcome of MNI for the three tenecteplase\ndoses, assuming a common probability of ICH of\n0.06 for each dose. A phase I pilot study of\ntenecteplase [6] had shown substantially larger\ndifferences in the proportion of subjects with MNI\nbetween tenecteplase doses: 36% of subjects given\n0.1 mg/kg had MNI compared with 16% of subjects\ngiven 0.4 mg/kg. The literature also showed that\nICH rates of approximately 6% are typical with\nrt-PA administration [7]. The truncation point was\nselected small enough to achieve a feasible\nmaximum recruitment, yet sufficiently large to\npreserve the probability of correct selection.\nThe operating characteristics of the selection\nprocedure were estimated by simulation based on\npresented in Table 1. P[cs] refers to the probability\nof correct selection, i.e. reaching a final elimination\nby the stated criterion with a correct selection of\nthe best dose at or before the 150th matched set.\nThe value for P[cs] does not include any correct\nselections that might also occur at truncation time\nby clinical decision criteria should a final winner not\nbe declared by 150 matched sets. E[min(N(1),m)]\nrefers to the expected time of first elimination or\n150 triplets, whichever occurs first. This gives the\naverage number of matched triplets until the earlier\nof the first dose elimination or the end of the phase\nII trial; multiplying by 3 gives the number of\npatients randomized to this point in the procedure.\nE[min(N,m)] refers to the expected time of final\nelimination or 150 matched sets, whichever occurs\nfirst. This gives the average number of matched sets\nuntil a dose is selected or 150 matched sets have\nbeen randomized, whichever occurs first. One\ncannot multiply this number by 3 to get the total\nnumber of patients in the selection phase because\nof the possibility of early elimination of a dose. We\ntherefore provide another operating characteristic,\nE[T], the expected total number of patients ran-\ndomized in the selection phase. Also, provided are\nthe median and modal numbers of matched sets\n(approximate to the nearest integer). Finally,\nP[no winner] refers to the probability that trunca-\ntion time will arrive without achievement of\nthe stated criterion for a final dose selection.\nIn symbols, P[no winner] \u00bc P[N > 150]. In all\ncases, the probability of selecting an incorrect\ndose is given by 1 \u00c0 P[cs] \u00c0 P[no winner]. Table 1\nTable 1 Operating characteristics of the selection procedure based on 100,000 simulations for each scheme under the least favorable\nconfiguration\nScheme (%MNI \u00ad %ICH for three doses)\naWhen the doses have equal probability of MNI and symptomatic ICH (as in the scheme presented in the last column), selection of any\nof the three doses is `correct' with respect to the probability of MNI net of symptomatic ICH. In this case, the first row gives the\nprobability of selecting the first listed doses. Exactly the same figure applies to the other two doses.\nshows the operating characteristics of different\nschemes in which one dose is superior and the\ntwo inferior doses are equal in probabilities of MNI\nand symptomatic ICH; this is often called a `least\nfavorable configuration.' The `best' dose in Table 1\nappears in the first row of each scheme. See\nAppendix (supplementary material) for the operat-\ning characteristics under five other schemes of\ninterest.\nPreliminary comparisons of the clinical efficacy\nand safety endpoints\nThe preliminary assessment for promise or futility\nat the end of phase II was based on the modified\nRankin scale [8] observed 3 months after random-\nization, trichotomized into three ordered catego-\nries. The best category was Rankin score 0 or 1 (good\noutcome); the worst category was Rankin score 4, 5,\nor 6 (poor outcome, including death); and the\nintermediate category was Rankin score 2 or 3\n(neither, i.e., neither poor nor good outcome). There\nwere three sets of clinical decision rules for declar-\ning promise or futility, depending on the relative\nsafety profile of (the selected dose of) tenecteplase\ncompared to rt-PA.\nScenario 1: Tenecteplase showed a lower symptom-\natic ICH rate than rt-PA, defined as tenecteplase having\nat least 2 fewer symptomatic ICHs than rt-PA on the\nrapid-response outcome. In this situation, declare\ntenecteplase promising if the observed proportion\nof patients with poor outcome is less than or equal\nto that of rt-PA. If the proportion with poor\noutcome on tenecteplase is greater than on rt-PA,\ndeclare further study unpromising. In addition, and\nconsistent with the interim monitoring plan for\nsafety and efficacy, declare further study unprom-\nising if the proportion of good outcomes for\ntenecteplase is significantly less than for rt-PA at\nScenario 2: The rate of symptomatic ICH within 24 h\nfor tenecteplase was effectively the same as for rt-PA,\ndefined as tenecteplase having the same number of ICHs\nas rt-PA or differing at most by plus or minus one ICH.\nIn this situation, declare tenecteplase promising if\nthe proportion of patients on tenecteplase with\npoor Rankin outcome is at least 8 percentage points\nlower than on rt-PA (i.e., an arithmetic difference of\n0.08). If not, declare further study unpromising. As\nin Scenario 1, also declare further study unpromis-\ning if the proportion of good outcomes for\ntenecteplase is significantly less than for rt-PA at\nScenario 3: Tenecteplase showed a higher symptom-\natic ICH rate than rt-PA, defined as tenecteplase having\ntwo or more ICHs than rt-PA. In this situation,\ndeclare further study unpromising.\nThese rules for declaring promise or futility were\nclinical decision rules and were not based on\nstatistical significance criteria (except where the\ninterim monitoring plan would suggest that the\nDSMB consider early stopping of the study). While\nsomewhat arbitrary, they reflected the clear wishes\nof the clinical investigator, and provided unambig-\nuous grounds for the required clinical decision\nmaking at the end of phase II. They can also be\nviewed as another statistical selection procedure: at\nthis point in the trial, we would need to select\nbetween two alternative courses \u00ad `to go' or `not to\ngo' on to phase III \u00ad with a procedure that would\nprovide a high probability of correct selection in\nthe event there was a truly superior choice.\nIt is possible that the selection procedure might\nobserve 150 matched sets without arriving at a\nselection decision. In that case, the following\nclinical criteria would be used to select a dose\nfrom the remaining two or three competing arms\nand determine promise or futility.\nCriterion 1: Select the dose that allows continu-\nation into phase III based on the futility criteria\nspecified above. If no dose would allow continua-\ntion of the study based on the futility criteria,\nfurther study with any of the three doses would be\ndeclared unpromising.\nCriterion 2: If under Criterion 1 more than one\ndose would allow continuation of the trial, select\nthe tenecteplase dose with the lowest ICH rate.\nCriterion 3: If under Criterion 2 more than\none dose would allow continuation of the trial,\nselect the dose with the lowest proportion of poor\noutcomes.\nCriterion 4: If under Criterion 3 more than one\ndose would allow continuation of the trial, select\nthe dose with the highest proportion of good outcomes.\nSee Appendix for further discussion.\nContinuation of the study in phase III\nIf the selected dose of tenecteplase showed promise,\na total of at most 1908 patients were to be\nrandomized in phase III to the selected dose of\ntenecteplase or rt-PA (954 per group, including the\npatients studied in these two arms during phase II).\nThe primary endpoint for phase III was the\ntrichotomized Rankin score. Two co-primary null\nhypotheses were to be tested in phase III: (1) The\nproportion of poor outcomes with tenecteplase at\nthe selected dose did not differ from the proportion\nof poor outcomes with rt-PA. (2) The proportion of\ngood outcomes with tenecteplase at the selected\ndose did not differ from the proportion of good\noutcomes with rt-PA. Each hypothesis was to be\ntested using the Mantel\u00adHaenszel score test, strat-\nified by site, with 1/2-continuity correction.\nTNK-S2B trial of tenecteplase versus alteplase 401\nThe two hypotheses were to be tested at the overall\ntwo-tailed  \u00bc 0.05 level using the Holm step-down\nprocedure [9], which controls the probability of\nmaking one or two type I errors at no more than\ngroup) would provide 90% power to detect a !8%\nreduction in poor outcome without a reduction in\ngood outcome, or 89% power to detect an 8%\nincrease in good outcome without an increase in\npoor outcome.\nWe formulated the two co-primary hypotheses\nto allow for a treatment effect at either end of\nthe Rankin scale. This also facilitated identifying\nthe `win/lose' situations for tenecteplase, as\nrequired by regulatory reviewers. For example, if\ntenecteplase were no better than a placebo, it would\nreduce the proportion of poor outcomes due to\nICH, although it would also have poor efficacy\ncompared to rt-PA. This would not be a `win'\nsituation.\nThe phase III trial was to incorporate four formal\ninterim analyses and one final analysis. The first\ninterim analysis was to take place at the end of\npatients in the two phase III arms (between 100 and\n150 patients per arm, and not counting the other\narms used in the selection stage). The second, third,\nand fourth interim analyses were to take place after\nand 1,500 patients, respectively. The terminal\nanalysis was to take place after a total of 1908\npatient observations were complete, assuming no\nearly termination.\nFigure 1 contains a graphical representation\nof the win-lose-type situations for tenecteplase in\nthe interim analyses and the terminal analysis,\nusing barycentric coordinates. Any point in\nthe triangle represents a triplet consisting of the\nprobabilities of poor, neither, and good outcome;\nthe perpendicular distance of the point from any\none of the three sides represents the probability\nof the outcome denoted by the vertex opposite\nthat side.\nAt each interim analysis, formal tests of the two\nprimary hypotheses were to be conducted, each at\nthe two-tailed  \u00bc 0.001 level. Assuming both null\nhypotheses to be true, rejection of either at any\ninterim analysis would constitute at least one type I\nerror. At the terminal analysis, assuming no earlier\nstopping, each primary hypothesis was to be tested\ncorrection.\nType I error control in seamless phase II/III trials\nposes unresolved issues, particularly when, as here,\nphase II involves a selection procedure rather than\na hypothesis test. Two are particularly important in\nthe current case.\nMultiple testing\nNo correction for multiple testing is needed\nbecause the phase III component of the trial does\nnot compare each competing dose of tenecteplase\nwith rt-PA; it performs only one hypothesis test of\nthe selected dose of tenecteplase versus rt-PA (for\neach of the two co-primary endpoints). The inferior\ntenecteplase doses are eliminated in phase II by a\nselection procedure, not a hypothesis test against\nrt-PA; moreover, the selection procedure uses an\noutcome different from (although correlated with)\nthat in phase III. Thus, although the hypothesis\ntested in phase III is determined by the selection\nprocedure, there is only one hypothesis test for\neach co-primary endpoint. Since no more than a\nsingle type I error can be committed, the need for\nadjustment for multiple testing does not arise.\nSelection bias\nThe selection procedure does slightly inflate the\ntype I error rate. However, we show in a fixed\nsample size simulation study (see below, and the\nAppendix) that without stopping for futility or\nefficacy in interim monitoring, this inflation is\nmore than compensated for by the 1/2-continuity\ncorrection's reduction in the type I error rate. We\nalso show below, in a group sequential study, that\nthe clinical criteria for futility stopping even with\ninterim monitoring reduce the type I error rate\nfurther below nominal levels. Given this, no cor-\nrection for selection bias resulting from the selec-\ntion procedure is necessary.\nDesign of the type I error rate\nsimulation studies\nGiven the complex design of TNK-S2B, simulation\nstudies were required to demonstrate that the\nstatistical analysis plan specified above does in\nfact control the type I error rate for the phase III\ntrial at or below nominal levels. We conducted two\nsuch studies. One, the Group Sequential (GS) study,\nis presented here. A second, the Fixed Sample Size\n(FSS) study, is included as an Appendix. As argued\nabove, there was only one hypothesis test contem-\nplated from the beginning of phase II to the end of\nphase III, that of the selected tenecteplase dose\nversus rt-PA, and hence the type I error rate we refer\nto here is indeed an unconditional, experiment-\nwise error rate and not conditioned on the identity\nof the dose selected.\nThe FSS study considers a simplified version of\nthe TNK-S2B trial design in which dose selection is\nNeither Neither\nPoor Good\nW\nL\nNW\nC\n= possible rt-PA\noutcome proportions\n(poor, neither, good)\nZones\nW = winner for TNK\nNW = not a winner\nNS = not significant\nL = loser for TNK\nScenario II\nDiff in # ICHs equals\nPoor Good\nW\nL\nNW\nC\n= possible rt-PA\noutcome proportions\n(poor, neither, good)\nZones\nW = winner for TNK\nNW = not a winner\nNS = not significant\nL = loser for TNK\nScenario I\n# ICHs for rt-Pa \u00ad TNK > 1\nNeither Neither\nPoor Good\nW\nL\nNW\nC\n= possible rt-PA\noutcome proportions\n(poor, neither, good)\nZones\nW = winner for TNK\nNW = not a winner\nNS = not significant\nL = loser for TNK\nPoor Good\nC\nW\nL\nNW\n= possible rt-PA\noutcome proportions\n(poor, neither, good)\nZones\nW = winner for TNK\nNW = not a winner\nNS = not significant\nL = loser for TNK\nNeither\nPoor Good\nW\nL\nNW\nC\nNW\n= possible rt-PA\noutcome proportions\n(poor, neither, good)\nZones\nW = winner for TNK\nNW = not a winner\nNS = not significant\nL = loser for TNK\nNW\nNS\n= possible rt-PA\noutcome proportions\n(poor, neither, good)\nZones\nW = winner for TNK\nNW = not a winner\nNS = not significant\nL = loser for TNK\nNeither\nPoor Good\nW\nL\nNW\nFigure 1 Graphical representation of the win-lose-type situations for tenecteplase in the interim analyses as well as the terminal\nanalysis, using barycentric coordinates\nTNK-S2B trial of tenecteplase versus alteplase 403\npossible; there is no examination of clinical out-\ncome data for promise or futility; and the trial\nproceeds to a single final analysis with a total of\nand 954 in the rt-PA arm, with no stopping for\nfutility or for strong showing of interim efficacy. Its\npurpose is to highlight the simultaneous effects of\nthe dose selection from stage 1 and the 1/2-\ncontinuity correction, which would otherwise be\ndominated by the larger effect of the examination\nfor promise or futility and the effect of interim\nmonitoring. See Appendix for details.\nThe GS simulation study\nThe purpose of the GS study is to simulate the full\nTNK-S2B trial, including the dose selection, exam-\nination for promise or futility, and phase III interim\nmonitoring features, to estimate their combined\nimpact on the type I error rates. All replications of\nthe GS study are used in the estimation of the error\nrates. Note that according to the design, if the\nactual trial stopped at the end of phase II for futility\nbecause a selected dose lacked promise, or if there\nwas a failure to select a tenecteplase dose because all\ncompeting doses lacked promise at truncation time,\nthere would be no phase III trial and hence no\ndeclaration of significance and no type I errors\nunder the null hypothesis (unless a dose had a\nsignificantly different probability of poor or good\noutcome compared to rt-PA at the 0.001 level).\nThus, in the GS study, if a particular simulation\nunder a given null hypothesis scheme stops for\nfutility because a selected dose lacks promise\n(without attaining statistical significance at the\ntwo-tailed 0.001 level for either endpoint), we\ncount the simulation as contributing no type I\nerror. If the simulation results in a failure to select a\ntenecteplase dose because all competing doses lack\npromise at truncation time, we choose one dose at\nrandom to test for statistical significance at the two-\ntailed 0.001 level for both poor and good outcomes,\nafter which the simulated trial stops. On the other\nhand, if at any interim analysis the two-tailed 0.001\nsignificance level is attained for either poor or good\nclinical outcome, or at the terminal analysis the\ntwo-tailed 0.025 significance level is attained for\neither poor or good clinical outcome, we count the\nsimulation as contributing at least one type I error.\nunder each of 1000 different null hypothesis\nschemes described below. Note that the Mantel\u00ad\nHaenszel score test would have type I error rates\nalmost identical to that of a simple comparison of\npooled proportions, because in this trial the site-\nstratified randomization procedure rendered the\nstratification factor orthogonal to the treatment\nassignment under the null hypothesis. Therefore,\nfor feasibility of the present type I error rate studies,\nwe used only the pooled z-score test for the equality\nof two proportions with 1/2-continuity correction\nfor each primary hypothesis.\nSpecification of distribution schemes\nThe simulation of both rapid-response outcomes\nand 3-month Rankin outcomes requires specifica-\ntion of the joint distribution of two trichotomous\nrandom variables, i.e., a 3 \u00c2 3 table of joint prob-\nabilities, for each treatment arm. We call such a set\ndifferent distribution schemes were used in the\nsimulation studies. Generation of these distribution\nschemes is described in detail in the Appendix. In\nthe simulation studies, our goal was to produce a\nset of distributions that would cover a portion of\nthe parameter space that was of direct clinical\ninterest to the TNK-S2B trial, and that the portion\ncovered was sufficiently broad as to represent type I\nerror rates accurately over the entire theoretical\nparameter space. Let the three-category rapid\nresponse be denoted by X, taking values of 0 for\nICH, 1 for neither MNI nor ICH, and 2 for MNI. Let\nthe trichotomized 3-month Rankin scale for the\nclinical outcome be denoted by Y, taking values of\n0 for poor outcome, 1 for neither poor nor good\noutcome, and 2 for good outcome. Let the doses of\ntenecteplase be labeled A, B, and C, corresponding\ndose D refer to rt-PA. Let T denote any of these four\ntreatment arms. It is most convenient to determine\nthe joint distribution of (X, Y) by first specifying\nP[X|T], and then specifying P[Y|X, T]. Once these\nthree-component vectors of probabilities are deter-\nmined, random realizations of the pair (X, Y) can be\nproduced by generating a trinomial response X\nfollowing P[X|T], and then by generating another\ntrinomial response Y following P[Y|X, T]. In the\nsimulation studies, 10 different marginal condi-\ntional distributions for X given T were selected at\nrandom in a manner described in the Appendix; see\nFigure 2(a) for visualizing these distributions. For\neach one of these, 10 different marginal distribu-\ntions for Y given T (identical for each T under the\nnull hypotheses) were generated randomly\npairs of marginal distributions for X and Y, 10\ndifferent conditional distributions for Y given X\nand T were generated randomly, subject to the\nmarginalization constraint that the weighted average\nof P[Y|X, T] using weights P[X|T] agree with the\ngiven distribution P[Y|T], together with a clinical\nmonotonicity constraint that P[Y \u00bc poor|X, T] is the\ngreatest when X \u00bc ICH and least when X \u00bc MNI,\nand similarly, P[Y \u00bc good|X, T] is the least when\nX \u00bc ICH and the greatest when X \u00bc MNI. Thus,\nwere employed for the simulations. Figure 2(c)\ncontains a graphical representation of the complete\nlist of distributions, using barycentric coordinates,\ndisplaying a uniform distribution of T over the\nlower portion of the triangle. Figure 2(d) shows a\nvisual effect of the clinical monotonicity con-\nstraint. As stated above, we simulated 40,000 trial\nreplications for each distribution scheme. Each\nreplication generated random samples of up to\n150 pairs of outcomes (X, Y) for each member of a\nquadruplet or matched set for the selection stage,\nFigure 2 Graphical representation of the different distribution schemes in terms of barycentric coordinates: (a) 10 marginal\nconditional distributions of X|T, for T \u00bc A, B, C, D, along with the region of clinical interest; (b) 10 marginal conditional\ndistributions of Y|T (same for all T under the null hypothesis), along with the region of clinical interest; (c) 1,000 distributions of Y|X,\nT for each of 12 (X, T) combinations, where different colors represent different values of T; (d) 1,000 distributions of Y|X, T for each\nof 12 (X, T) combinations, where different colors represent different values of X, and which is consistent with the clinical\nmonotonicity constraint\nTNK-S2B trial of tenecteplase versus alteplase 405\nand additional (X, Y) pairs to make up the total\nsample size of 1908 clinical outcomes for the phase\nIII trial.\nResults\nIn the GS study, the type I errors were all well below\ntheir nominal levels, by about one-third. Table 2\nshows that the average two-tailed type I error rate\n(averaged across all 1,000 distribution schemes) was\napproximately 0.009 for both poor and good out-\ncomes. Among the 2,000 hypothesis tests con-\nducted among the 1,000 distribution schemes, the\nmaximum estimated type I error was approximately\naverage of the overall type I error rate for the two\nprimary outcomes (i.e., the probability of at least\none type I error) was approximately 0.018, with\nmaximum value approximately 0.038. The type I\nerror rate is evidently under good control.\nThese results show that the inflation in the type I\nerror rates caused by the dose selection and\nrepeated looks at the data in interim analyses is\nmore than offset by the reduction in the type I error\nrate caused by implementing the clinical stopping\nrules for futility at the first interim analysis. In the\nGS study, selection in the phase II component\nsomewhat elevates the probability of declaring the\nselected dose of tenecteplase significantly better\nthan rt-PA with respect to poor outcome, while it\nsimultaneously decreases somewhat the probability\nof declaring the selected dose of tenecteplase\nsignificantly worse than rt-PA. The average type I\nerror rate in the former tail was 0.0069 while that in\nthe latter tail was 0.0022. Analogous results were\nobtained for good outcome. The average type I\nerror rate for declaring the selected dose of\ntenecteplase significantly better than rt-PA with\naverage type I error rate for declaring the selected\ndose of tenecteplase significantly worse than rt-PA\nof type I error counterbalance each other, such that\nthe sum of the error rates in the two tails are within\nnominal levels. It is entirely acceptable for a two-\ntailed test to employ an asymmetrical allocation of\ntotal type I error in the two tails, so long as the total\ntype I error rate is within nominal levels [10].\nSimilar results were obtained in the FSS study, and\nare described in detail in the Appendix.\nDiscussion\nThe TNK-S2B trial employed an innovative, ran-\ndomized, seamless phase IIB/III design to test\ntenecteplase versus standard-dose rt-PA in the treat-\nment of patients with acute ischemic stroke within\n3 h of onset. For the phase II part of the trial, we\nchose an adaptive sequential dose selection proce-\ndure that employed a rapid assessment of MNI at 24\nh balanced against occurrence of symptomatic ICH\nto choose among three different doses of\ntenecteplase.\nRegulatory reviewers questioned three aspects of\nthe control of the type I error rate. The first\nconcerned whether or not multiple comparisons\ntechniques were required given that the trial began\nwith three doses of tenecteplase, and whether or\nnot an adjustment for selection effects was needed.\nWe have addressed those concerns above.\nReviewers were further concerned that the type I\nerror rate would not be controlled under schemes\nwhich would not occur under the protocol, e.g., if\nthe trial were continued into phase III absent\nclinical criteria for promising efficacy. We under-\nstand the concern, in that noncompliance with\nprespecified protocols is a major problem when it\noccurs, as it often has. However, this would have\nbeen in violation of the clearly specified trial\nprotocol, which stated the futility stopping require-\nments as rules rather than guidelines. It has been\naccepted in the ongoing dialog between researchers\nand regulators that adaptive designs must be\nprespecified rather than ad hoc. This presupposes\nand requires respect for the prespecified protocol,\nunder which the type I error rate is computed.\nTable 2 Descriptive statistics of the distribution of type I errors in the GS study across 1,000 schemes\nMean Median Maximum Minimum Lower quartile Upper quartile Range Std Dev.\nAnalysis variable: type I error for poor outcome\nAnalysis variable: type I error for good outcome\nAnalysis variable: type I error for either poor or good outcome (overall error)\nUltimately, one cannot assure type I error control\nunder arbitrary protocol violations. This applies\nwith equal force to traditional as well as adaptive\ntrial designs.\nFinally, a reviewer was doubtful whether any\namount of simulations could demonstrate adequate\ncontrol of the type I error rate. However, simula-\ntions are recognized under the FDA draft guidance\ndocument [2], and given the coverage of the\nparameter space in ours, it seemed to us unreason-\nable to sustain such doubt. Clarification is needed\nwhether control of the error rate must be demon-\nstrated by theorems or can be demonstrated by\nsimulation. In addition, a sensitive reviewer of this\narticle suggested that the regulatory agency's con-\ncern might be allayed by a commitment from the\ntrial investigators to submit interim analysis results\nto it as these analyses occur. This proposal merits\nconsideration.\nIn summary, the TNK-S2B trial design, while\ncomplex, was innovative and efficient. Its statistical\nanalysis plan had great integrity. Under the proto-\ncol, it would have controlled the unconditional\ntype I error rate below the nominal 0.05 level for\nthe two primary hypothesis tests in phase III, and\nexperiment-wise. The trial provides several lessons\nfor adaptive designs. (a) Time must be allowed for\niterative communications with regulatory reviewers\nfrom the first stages of the design and planning\nprocess, as the recent FDA draft guidance document\nstresses [2]. (b) Type I error control must be clearly\ndemonstrated. (c) Greater clarity is needed on\nwhether this includes demonstration that type I\nerror control will be maintained if the protocol is\nviolated, and on whether or not simulations are an\nacceptable form of demonstration. (d) Regulatory\nagency concerns that the protocol for futility\nstopping may not be followed may be allayed by a\ncommitment to submit all interim analysis results\nto the regulatory agency as these analyses occur.\nFuture trials with similar potential to TNK-S2B will\nhave a greater probability of success if these issues\ncan be successfully addressed.\nFunding\nThis research was supported by grants (R01-\nInstitute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke \u00ad\nNational Institutes of Health.
