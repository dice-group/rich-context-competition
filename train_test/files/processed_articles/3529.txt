In this con-\ntext, identifying pathways for gp120 internalization\nwould aid in development of novel therapeutic strategies\neither by preventing gp120 entry into sensory neurons or\nblocking downstream signaling pathways.\nMajor pathways that are candidates for gp120 intern-\nalization include the common endosomal pathway, which\nutilizes clathrin-mediated endocytosis; fluid phase pino-\ncytosis in which endosomes are nonspecifically taken up\nby the cell along with extracellular fluid; and lipid raft\ninternalization. Lipid rafts are cholesterol-enriched, dis-\ncrete microdomains within the plasma membrane that\nact as signal transduction platforms and mediate cla-\nthrin-independent internalization. Several viruses utilize\nlipid rafts to mediate entry into cells (Chazal and\nters with its coreceptors in lipid rafts to allow virus intern-\nNeurons of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) are\nremarkably polarized, with axons reaching up to a meter\nor more in length in some cases. This unique cellular\narchitecture renders these cells highly dependent on\nmicrotubule motor-dependent fast axonal transport\nmechanisms for trafficking of proteins and cellular com-\nponents within axons (Morfini et al., 2009). Certain\nviruses, including herpes simplex virus and adenoviruses,\nhave the capability to hijack specific components of the\nhost's fast axonal transport machinery (i.e., molecular\nmotors and vesicle-associated proteins), allowing their\nintracellular movement (Berth et al., 2009). Transport\nof gp120 itself has been reported in the CNS but not in\nThe aims of this study were to determine whether\ngp120 is subject to internalization by PNS sensory neu-\nrons, to identify specific uptake pathways involved, and\nto evaluate whether gp120 is transported along axons.\nOur findings indicate that gp120 is mainly internalized\nthrough lipid rafts, with a minor fraction internalized\nthrough fluid phase pinocytosis. Additionally, gp120\nwas retrogradely transported from axons to the cell\nbodies in a time frame indicating fast axonal transport.\nThe demonstration of intracellular internalization for\ngp120 in DRG neurons raises the possibility of intracel-\nlular neurotoxic effects of gp120.\nMaterials and Methods\nCell Culture\nF11 cells (a generous gift from Dr. Richard Miller) were\ngrown in high glucose DMEM media (Invitrogen), sup-\nplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% glu-\nSix-channel m-slides from Ibidi (#80606) were coated\nwith 0.1 mg/ml poly-L-lysine (Sigma) and then rinsed 4\ntimes (30 min each) with autoclaved, deionized water.\nThen, 300 cells were added to each channel and main-\n.

Mounting media with DAPI\n(Vectashield) was dropped into wells.\nFluorescence Imaging and Quantitation\nCells were imaged using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta laser\nscanning confocal microscope with a 100\u00c2 objective.\nOne-micrometer-thick z-stacks were obtained, and at\nleast 10 cells per experimental condition were analyzed\nfor each time point. Z-stacks excluded the slices in\nwhich the upper and lower boundaries of the cells were\nin focus, to ensure that the z-stacks were only composed\nof intracellular slices. For the CXCR4 image, a 40\u00c2\nobjective was used to show multiple cells.\nImages were deconvolved and analyzed in three\ndimensions using Volocity software (Perkin Elmer).\nThree-dimensional reconstructions and movies were cre-\nated in Volocity (Supplemental Figures 1 to 3). For\ninternalization assays, the average fluorescence units\nwere calculated for each region of interest (ROI) obtained\nfrom each cell traced. For colocalization analysis, the\nPearson's correlation coefficient, which calculates the cor-\nrelation between intensities of different channels, was\nobtained for each cell. To provide quantitative colocali-\nzation of immunofluorescent signals, colocalization coef-\nficients M1 and M2 were obtained for the green and red\nchannels respectively which calculate the fraction of each\nchannel that overlapped with the other channel (Manders\nStudent's t test and Spearman's correlation were used for\nstatistical analysis. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was\nutilized to compare amounts of gp120 internalization\nbetween treatments of gp120 alone, heat inactivated\ngp120, and AMD pretreatments. Student's t test was\nused to examine decreases in gp120 internalization after\nCD treatment for 30 min, 1 hr, and 2 hr time points.\nQuantitative data were expressed as mean \u00c6 SEM, and\nsignificance was determined at p < .05.\nMicrofluidic Devices\nCustom microfluidic chambers were produced to com-\npartmentalize axonal terminal and somatodendritic com-\npartments (ATC and SDC, respectively) of cultured\nneurons. Nanofabricated microchannels separating\nthese compartments are small enough (length of 900 mm\nand a width of 8 mm) that only axons can grow through.\nFluidic isolation of a compartment is maintained by\nvolume differences of 200 ml, as well as through a perpen-\ndicular central channel 23 mm long and 50 mm wide, so\nthat the pressure gradient overcomes diffusion.\nMicrofluidic chambers were fabricated using photolithog-\nraphy and replica molding techniques. Briefly, patterned\nlayers of PDMS were exposed to plasma generated by a\nlaboratory corona treater (BD-20AC; Electro-Technic\nProducts, Inc., Chicago, IL), as were glass coverslips.\nThe plasma-treated surfaces were then immediately\nplaced in conformal contact, and incubation of the\nBerth et al. 3\nwhole setup at 80C overnight resulted in irreversible\nbonding. ATC and SDC were loaded with 70% etha-\nnol for 30 min, rinsed with autoclaved water 4 times,\nand if needed, treated with 0.1% tritonX-100 in PBS to\nremove bubbles from the microchannels. After this,\ndevices were washed with autoclaved water 3 times for\n5 min each.\nMicrofluidic devices were incubated overnight with\n0.5 mg/ml poly-L-lysine (Sigma) in 0.1 M borate buffer\npH 8.5 and then washed with autoclaved water 4 times\nfor 30 min each. Devices were incubated overnight\nwith 10 mg/ml laminin (Invitrogen) in Neurobasal\nmedia (Invitrogen) at 37C prior to plating the DRG\nneurons.\nPrimary DRG Neuron Cell Culture\nAll experiments involving animals were conducted\naccording to protocols approved by the Institutional\nAnimal Care and Use Committee at University of\nIllinois at Chicago. E15 DRG neurons were dissected\nfrom embryos obtained from timed pregnant Sprague-\nDawley rats, as described in Hall et al. (2006), and\nplaced into ice-cold 1\u00c2 Hank's balanced salt solution.\nTrypsin was added to 0.25%, and the cells were incubated\nat 37C. Trypsin was inactivated by adding 10% FBS,\nand cells were collected by centrifugation (600 \u00c2 g for 6\nmin). Cells were resuspended in serum-free Neurobasal\nmedia (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2% B27\n(Invitrogen), 1% Glutamax (Invitrogen), 0.5% penicil-\nlin/streptomycin (10,000 U/ml each, Invitrogen), and\n2.5 S nerve growth factor (NGF; 20 ng/ml, Invitrogen).\nCells (90,000) were added to the SDC of the prepared\nmicrofluidic devices (30,000 cells per SDC compartment),\nand microfluidic flow was from SDC to ATC. Within the\nATC, 2.5 S NGF was added at 50 ng/ml concentration, to\nmaintain an NGF gradient that attracts DRG axons into\nthe ATCs. Half of the cell media was replaced with fresh\nmedia every other day. 5-Fluoro-20-dexyuridine (FudR;\n10 mm) was added to the cell media every other time the\nmedia was replaced to eliminate nonneuronal cells.\nResults\nThe neurotoxicity of gp120 was commonly thought to\nresult from binding to its coreceptor CXCR4 at the\nplasma membrane and abnormal activation of signaling\nby some neurons of the CNS was recently demonstrated\ninternalization and gp120 uptake by sensory neurons, the\nmain neuronal type affected in DSP, has not been estab-\nlished. Examining gp120 internalization by sensory\nneurons could illuminate mechanisms for sensory\nneuron-specific responses to gp120, providing novel\ninsights into DSP pathogenesis. To address this issue,\nwe evaluated gp120 internalization in F11 cells differen-\ntiated with dibutryl-cAMP, which are rat DRG neurons\nhybridized with mouse neuroblastoma cells (Ghil et al.,\ntheir similarity to DRG neurons.

Z-stack\nimages obtained by confocal microscopy demonstrated\naccumulation of gp120 within cells after 2 hr of incuba-\ntion (Figure 1(a) to (c), Supplemental Figures 1 to 3). A\ntime-course study (Figure 2(a) to (e)) further indicated\nthat internalization of gp120 by F11 cells was detectable\nas early as 15 min (Figure 2(b)) and continued to increase\nfor more than 2 hr (Figure 2(e)). The gp120 was first seen\nto be localized along neuritic processes (not shown) and\nat cell bodies, with accumulation in the perinuclear region\nof the cell bodies at later time points, raising the possi-\nbility that this protein may undergo retrograde axonal\ntransport (see later). A Student's two-tailed t test revealed\nthat the amount of gp120-derived average fluorescence\nwas significantly increased after 15 min of treatment\n(p < .0001) and continued to increase for the duration\nof the treatment (Figure 2(f)). A Spearman's correlation\nanalysis confirmed that gp120 internalization increased\nGp120 Internalization Is Specific and Partially\nDependent on Binding to CXCR4\nTo evaluate whether gp120 internalization was specific to\nits biological activity, fluorescein-gp120 was heat inacti-\nvated by boiling for 1 hr before addition to F11 cells.\nInternalization of gp120 (Figure 3(a)) over the course of\n2 hr was completely abrogated by heat inactivation of\ngp120 (Figure 3(b)), demonstrating that internalization\nof gp120 by F11 cells required native protein conform-\nation. Because T-tropic gp120 binds to its coreceptor\net al., 2001), the necessity of this binding for internaliza-\ntion was evaluated. Immunocytochemistry experiments\n(Figure 3(d)) and immunoblots (Figure 3(e)) confirmed\nthe presence of CXCR4 in F11 cells. F11 cells were\npretreated for an hour with 2 mM AMD, a small molecule\ninhibitor of gp120 binding to CXCR4 (De Clercq et al.,\nexperiment was performed cotreating cells with\n60 (d), and 120 min (e).

Significantly, treatment of\nF11 cells with AMD markedly reduced the amount\nof internalized gp120 (Figure 3(c)) compared with\nuntreated cells (Figure 3(a)), but not to the same extent\nas heat-inactivated fluorescein-gp120 Figure 3(b)). This\nconcentration of AMD was sufficient to abolish signaling\nthrough the CXCR4 receptor (data not shown).\nA one-way ANOVA was performed to determine dif-\nferences in the amounts of gp120 internalized between the\nthe AMD treated group (Figure 3(e) and (f)). The groups\nwere found to be significantly different (p < .0001).\nFurther, all experimental groups were significantly\ndifferent from each other (p < .0001 for each comparison)\nusing a Tukey\u00adKramer test. These data indicate that\ngp120 binding to CXCR4 is necessary for some, but\nMechanisms of gp120 Internalization\nThe highly punctate intracellular staining of fluorescein-\nconjugated gp120 (Figure 1) suggested internalization\nthrough an endocytic mechanism. To evaluate this possi-\nbility, F11 cells were treated with fluorescein-conjugated\ngp120 for a time course more than 4 hr and then stained\nwith antibodies recognizing markers of the early (EEA1)\nFigure 3. Gp120 internalization is abolished by heat inactivation and reduced by AMD3100. F11 cells were treated with (a) fluorescein-\nbefore the addition of fluorescein-gp120. Heat inactivation prevented internalization of fluorescein-gp120 by F11 cells, demonstrating that\ninternalization is specific to the native protein conformation of gp120. Also, AMD3100 treatment reduced gp120 internalization,\ndemonstrating that internalization of gp120 is partially dependent on binding to CXCR4, a normal biological activity. However, the partial\nreduction of internalization indicates that gp120 can also be internalized through a mechanism independent of CXCR4. The morphology of\ncells was revealed using an anti-tubulin antibody (red). (d) F11 cells immunostained with a CXCR4 antibody demonstrate the presence of\nCXCR4 on the surface of the cells.

Significantly, gp120 failed to colocalize with either\nEEA1 (Figure 4) or LAMP2 (Figure 5) throughout the\nentire time course of the experiments, ruling out intern-\nalization through the common endolysosomal pathway.\nNext, fluid phase pinocytosis was assessed as a\nmechanism for gp120 internalization. To this end, differ-\nentiated F11 cells were simultaneously treated with fluor-\nescein-gp120 and rhodamine-conjugated dextran (MW\n10,000), a well-known marker of fluid phase pinocytosis\nand dextran was observed (Figure 6), suggesting that at\nleast a fraction of extracellular gp120 is internalized into\nF11 cells through fluid phase pinocytosis.\nBecause gp120 did not enter the cell through the\ncommon endolysosomal pathway and fluid phase\npinocytosis only accounted for a minor fraction of total\nbe internalized through lipid raft-mediated endocytosis,\nanother non-clathrin-mediated process (Lajoie and Nabi,\nlipid rafts (Popik et al., 2002), and this clustering is crit-\nical for HIV infection (Kamiyama et al., 2009).\nConsistent with this possibility, significant colocalization\nwas observed between internalized fluorescein-gp120 and\ncholera toxin B (Figure 7). To further evaluate the role of\nlipid rafts for gp120 internalization, differentiated F11\ncells were treated with 5 mM CD for 20 min to deplete\ncholesterol and inhibit lipid raft internalization. Next\nalization quantified. Comparing untreated cells (Figure\n8(a)) with F11 cells pretreated with CD (Figure 8(b))\nindicated that CD pretreatment significantly decreased\nmin time points (Figure 8(b) to (d)), and the differences\nwere significant at p < .05 using a Student's two-tailed\nFigure 4.

The Pearson's correlation coefficient (d), colocalization coefficient M1 (green channel; e) and colocalization\ncoefficient M2 (red channel; f) all show very low values, consistent with lack of co-localization for fluorescein-gp120 and EEA1. This\nindicates that gp120 is not significantly internalized through the common endosomal pathway.\nBerth et al. 7\nt test (*), a finding consistent with results from colocali-\nzation experiments in Figure 7. In concurrent experi-\nments, treatment of F11 cells with CD did not decrease\nthe amount of internalized transferrin (Figure 8(e)),\ndemonstrating that the inhibitory effect of CD on\ngp120 internalization was specific to lipid raft-mediated,\nbut not clathrin-mediated, endocytosis. Taken together,\nthese experiments indicated that lipid raft-mediated endo-\ncytosis represents a major pathway for gp120 internaliza-\ntion by sensory neurons.\nRecombinant gp120 Is Transported Retrogradely,\nbut Not Anterogradely, Along DRG Axons\nA number of viruses and viral proteins have the capabil-\nity to highjack various components of the host's axonal\ntransport machinery and be transported to different\nintracellular compartments (Berth et al., 2009). Having\nestablished internalization of gp120 by F11 cells, we\nexamined internalization and axonal transport of gp120\nin cultured DRG neurons using compartmentalized\nmicrofluidic devices, which allow for isolation of SDC\nand ATC. All axons have the same polarity and are in\nregister, so directionality of transport can be evaluated in\nthe axons. The diameter of nanofabricated microgrooves\nthat separate the SDC and ATC prevents dendrites or cell\nbodies from growing into the ATC. Primary DRG neu-\nrons bearing differentiated axons are more suited for\nthese devices than F11 cells, so rat primary DRG neurons\nwere utilized for these experiments to directly evaluate\naxonal trafficking.\nPrimary DRG neurons were grown in the SDC com-\npartment with a larger volume of media in the SDC to\nisolate the cell bodies and dendrites fluidically from the\nATC. After this, 70 nM fluorescein-gp120 was added to\nthe ATC of mature DRG neurons for 4 hr (Figure 9(a),\ndiagram on left). Neurons were then fixed and stained\nwith the DM1A antibody. Gp120 in the ATC, microflui-\ndic channels, and SDC was evaluated by fluorescence\nmicroscopy. As shown in Figure 9(a), fluorescein-gp120\nwas found at the ATC, along axons in the microfluidic\nchannels, and within cell bodies in the SDC, thus demon-\nstrating that gp120 had been internalized and retro-\ngradely transported along axons into neuronal cell\nbodies. Further, the time course of the experiment indi-\ncates that gp120 was transported by fast, and not slow,\naxonal transport, a microtubule motor-dependent pro-\ncess (Morfini et al., 2012). Next, anterograde transport\nFigure 5. Gp120 does not colocalize with LAMP2.

A representative image of a F11 cell\ntreated for 2 hr is shown in (a) to (c). Note the lack of colocalization in (c) between green and red channels.

However, the prevalence of DSP continues una-\nbated (Ghosh et al., 2012), making this an important\ndisease complication that still requires treatment.\nBecause HIV does not productively infect neurons\n(An,Groves, Giometto, Beckett, & Scaravilli, 1999), the\nmechanism for HIV-induced peripheral nerve damage is\nbelieved to involve indirect mechanisms. These include\nneurotoxicity by secretion of inflammatory factors, cyto-\nkines, and shed viral proteins such as gp120 (Kaul et al.,\n2005). The persistence of DSP despite tight viral control\nby combination antiretroviral therapy may be due to\nlatently infected cells that produce and release viral pro-\nteins (Nath, 2002) or low levels of HIV replication lead-\ning to gp120 shedding from HIV particles or from\nbinds to its coreceptor CXCR4 at the plasma membrane\nof DRG neurons leading to activation of downstream\nsignaling cascades (Apostolski et al., 1993). One proposal\nis that aberrant activation of this pathway might produce\nthe pain hypersensitivity (Oh et al., 2001; Bhangoo et al.,\n2009), axonal degeneration, and apoptosis (Melli et al.,\n2006) characteristic of DSP. However, recent experiments\ndemonstrating gp120 internalization by certain CNS\nFigure 6. Gp120 partially colocalizes with dextran.

A representative image of a F11 cell treated for 2\nhr is shown in (a) to (c). Note the partial colocalization in (c) between green and red channels. Arrows in (c) point to colocalized puncta.\nZ-stacks were taken of at least 10 cells per time point on a laser scanning confocal microscope, and images were deconvolved and analyzed\nfor colocalization in Volocity. The Pearson's correlation coefficient (d), colocalization coefficient M1 (green channel; e), and colocalization\ncoefficient M2 (red channel; f) all show values indicative of partial colocalization between gp120 and dextran. Because dextran is a marker\nof fluid phase pinocytosis, this demonstrates that a component of gp120 is internalized through fluid phase pinocytosis.\nBerth et al. 9\nneurons raised the possibility that intracellular gp120\nmight contribute to DSP pathogenesis (Bachis et al.,\nin DSP are capable of internalizing gp120 and how inter-\nnalized gp120 might contribute to neurotoxicity was\nunclear.\nHere we demonstrate that both F11 cells and primary\nDRG rat neurons internalized gp120 in a time-dependent\nmanner. Quantitative imaging showed accumulation of\ngp120 in the perinuclear region over time that began\nto level off after 2 hr of incubation with recombinant\ngp120 in the culture media. The highly punctate nature\nof intracellular gp120-derived fluorescence was consist-\nent with that reported for other cell types (Cefai et al.,\nAdditionally, heat inactivation and AMD pretreatment\nexperiments demonstrated that gp120 internalization\nwas specific to its biological activity and dependent\nupon native protein conformation.\nPharmacological experiments with the inhibitor AMD\nindicated that gp120 internalization was partially\ndependent on binding to its coreceptor CXCR4 but did\nnot reveal the pathway for internalization. Extracellular\ngp120 was previously reported to cause neurotoxicity\nthrough aberrant activation of CXCR4-linked signaling\nour results show that gp120 can be internalized, raising\nthe possibility that intra-neuronal gp120 contributes to\nsensory neuron toxicity. Binding of gp120 to CXCR4\nmight represent an initial step for gp120 internalization.\nColocalization studies with markers of different endo-\nsomal pathways helped define pathways for gp120 intern-\nalization. Lack of colocalization with EEA1 and LAMP2\ndemonstrated that gp120 is not significantly internalized\nthrough the common endolysosomal pathway. Rather,\ncolocalization analysis of gp120 with cholera toxin B\nand with dextran indicated that the bulk of extracellular\ngp120 was internalized through lipid rafts, with a minor\nfraction being internalized through fluid phase pinocyt-\nosis. Accordingly, disrupting lipid rafts through CD\ntreatment greatly decreased the amount of internalized\ngp120. This observation was consistent with previous\nFigure 7. Gp120 substantially colocalizes with cholera toxin B. F11 cells were cotreated with fluorescein-gp120 (green) and Alexa Fluor\n594-cholera toxin B (CTxB, red), and a time course of internalization was performed. The scale bar denotes 10 mm. A representative image\nof a F11 cell treated for 2 hr is shown in (a) to (c). Note the colocalization in (c) between green and red channels. Arrows in (c) point to\ncolocalized puncta. Z-stacks were taken of at least 10 cells per time point on a laser scanning confocal microscope, and images were\ndeconvolved and analyzed for colocalization in Volocity. The Pearson's correlation coefficient (d), colocalization coefficient M1 (green\nchannel; e), and colocalization coefficient M2 (red channel; f) all show values indicative of colocalization between gp120 and cholera toxin B,\nespecially by 2 hr treatment. Because cholera toxin B is a marker of internalization through lipid rafts, this indicates that gp120 is also\ninternalized through lipid rafts.\nreports showing that clustering of gp120 with its corecep-\ntors within lipid rafts is crucial for HIV infection (Manes\nMoreover, gp120 was reported to induce CXCR4\nmovement into lipid rafts for HIV entry (Kamiyama\net al., 2009). Based on these results, the major pathway\nfor internalization of gp120 appears to require binding to\nCXCR4 in association with lipid rafts. Gp120 has been\nFigure 8. Cyclodextrin treatment reduces internalization of gp120. F11 cells were pretreated with 5 mM b-methyl-cyclodextrin (CD) for\n20 min to disrupt lipid rafts, and then a time course of internalization of fluorescein-gp120 was performed. Scale bar: 10 mm. Representative\nimages of cells treated with fluorescein-gp120 for 2 hr without CD (a) or with CD pretreatment are shown (b). The morphology of cells\nwas revealed using an anti-tubulin antibody (red). Note the reduced amount of internalized gp120 in CD-treated cells (b), compared with\nuntreated ones (a). Average gp120-derived fluorescence was calculated for 10 or more cells. As shown in (c), pretreatment with 5 mM\ncyclodextrin for 20 min reduced the amount of internalized gp120 (gray line), compared with control cells (black line). Each measurement\nis plotted in (c), with gray and black dots corresponding to pretreatment with CD or no pretreatment, respectively. (d) Box plots\ndemonstrate that internalization of gp120 was significantly reduced at the 30, 60, and 120 min time points, consistent with internalization of\ngp120 through lipid rafts. *p <.05. (e) Pretreatment of differentiated F11 cells with 5 mM cyclodextrin for 20 min did not significantly affect\ninternalization of transferrin through the clathrin-mediated pathway (e).\nreported to cointernalize with CXCR4 in T-cells (Misse\net al., 1999), but internalized CXCR4 reportedly localizes\nto recycling endosomes in T-cells (Zhang et al., 2004). We\ndo not see colocalization of internalized gp120 with endo-\nsomal markers, raising the possibility that sensory neu-\nrons and hematopoetic cells utilize different pathways to\ninternalize CXCR4.\nThe bulk of gp120 was internalized through lipid\nrafts in neurons and neuron-like cells, but a small frac-\ntion was internalized through fluid phase pinocytosis.\nOne possibility is that the fraction of gp120 taken up\nby fluid phase pinocytosis was due to the nonselectivity\nof the process (Lim and Gleeson, 2011); in fact, fluid\nphase pinocytosis is increased if the concentration of a\nfluorescent ligand is high enough to saturate a receptor-\nmediated process (Swanson, 1989). However, these two\nmechanisms have been found concurrently in the intern-\nalization of HIV in brain microvascular endothelial cells\n(Liu et al., 2002), demonstrating that both lipid raft\ninternalization and fluid phase pinocytosis might\nmediate soluble (shed) gp120 or HIV virion internaliza-\ntion in multiple cell types. Additional experiments are\nneeded to understand whether one or both routes of\ngp120 internalization contribute to pathogenesis.\nHowever, our data suggest that inhibition of lipid raft\ninternalization (through cholesterol-lowering drugs such\nas statins) or fluid phase pinocytosis (through sodium\nproton exchange inhibitors like dimethyl amiloride)\nmight have beneficial effects to halt or prevent DSP\nprogression.\nWhat is the fate of internalized gp120 in DRG neu-\nrons? If internalization occurs within axons, then gp120\nwould not be immediately degraded, as degradation of\nendocytosed protein by lysosomes occurs in the perinuc-\nlear region of the neuron (Parton et al., 1992; Tai and\nthe retrograde direction from isolated DRG axons to\ntheir fluidically isolated cell bodies. Retrograde axonal\ntransport of gp120 is consistent with time course studies\nin F11 cells, as gp120-derived fluorescence first appeared\nFigure 9. Internalized gp120 undergoes retrograde but not anterograde transport along DRG axons. Primary DRG neurons were grown\nin compartmentalized microfluidic devices. To examine retrograde transport of gp120, DRG neurons were seeded in the larger com-\npartment to isolate cell bodies fluidically (schematic on a). The ATC was treated with 70 nM gp120 for 4 hr, and then the cells were fixed\nand stained with an anti-tubulin antibody (in red). Scale bar: 15 mm. Representative images of DRG neurons show that, after 4 hr of\ntreatment, gp120 is present within axons in the microfluidic channels and in cell bodies within the SDC, demonstrating that gp120 has been\ntransported from the ATC to the SDC. Conversely, DRG neurons were seeded in the smaller compartment to isolate their axons\nfluidically (schematic on b). The SDC was treated with 70 nM gp120 for 4 hr, and then the cells were fixed and stained as in (a).\nRepresentative images of DRG neurons show that fluorescein-gp120 was not detected in the microfluidic channels or in the ATC,\nindicating that gp120 is not transported in the anterograde direction from the SDC to the ATC.\nwithin neurites, gradually accumulating at the perinuclear\nregion at later time points. Although prelysosomal endo-\nsomes are among the organelles moving with retrograde\naxonal transport, colocalization studies with the lyso-\nsomal marker LAMP2 rule out a lysosomal destination\nfor gp120, suggesting a different organelle such as a sig-\nnaling endosome (Howe and Mobley, 2004) or another\nless well-characterized membrane-bounded organelle.\nExperiments with microfluidic devices indicated that\ngp120 was not transported in the anterograde direction\nfrom the cell body to axons, consistent with prior work\nwhich reported that selective retrograde transport of\nviruses and viral proteins (Leopold and Pfister, 2006;\nBerth et al., 2009). Identification of functional roles for\nthe gp120 target organelle is critical.\nThe present work establishes internalization of gp120\nby sensory neurons and characterizes candidate path-\nways for internalization and intracellular location of\ngp120. To date, the majority of research examining\ndirect gp120 neurotoxicity in DSP has focused on its\nbinding to CXCR4 and subsequent activation of signal-\ning cascades (Kamerman et al., 2012). Significantly,\ngp120 follows a pathway by which HIV can enter\ncells and escape into the cytoplasm to infect cells. As\na result, intracellular actions of gp120 that might\nunderlie the toxic effect of gp120 on DRG neurons\nremain to be characterized. Intracellular actions of\ngp120 may play a role in the development of dying\nback neurodegeneration. For example, intracellular\ngp120 may affect signaling pathways involved in fast\naxonal transport regulation, which are critical for main-\ntenance of axonal connectivity and neuronal survival\nintracellular effects of this protein within axons may\nprovide important information on the molecular basis\nfor DSP in long-term HIV patients and could lead to\nthe development of novel therapeutic treatments for\nHIV-related DSP.\nSummary\nThe neurotoxic HIV glycoprotein gp120 was found to be\ninternalized through lipid rafts and fluid phase pinocyt-\nosis and retrogradely transported along axons, providing\nevidence for intracellular interactions by gp120 in the\nperipheral nervous system.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The\nproject described was supported by the National Center for\nAdvancing Translational Sciences, National Institutes of Health,\nand grants from the National Institutes of Health (National Institute\nto STB.; and a pilot grant from the Chicago DCFAR\nSciences, and the Chicago Biomedical Consortium to STB.\nAuthor Contributions\nS.
