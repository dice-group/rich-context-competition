Females\nhave two X chromosomes, of which either the maternal or the paternal\nX is inactivated in early embryonic life, at about the time of\nimplantation.1 Females are therefore mosaics for two cell populations,\none with the maternal and one with the paternal X as the active\nX chromosome. Early in life the two cell populations are normally\ndistributed around a 50:50 ratio.2,3 In some females, one of the two\ncell populations is more abundant than the other and the value of the\nlarger proportion is called the degree of skewing (DS), with DSZ50.\nDS\u00bc50 is therefore a complete random X inactivation and DS\u00bc100 is\na completely skewed X inactivation. X inactivation is believed to occur\nrandomly for each cell and to be permanent for all descendants of the\ncell. For women younger than 55\u00ad60 years of age, DS does not increase\nsignificantly with age in populations2,3 or within the same individual.4\nHowever, DS increases considerably with age in cross-sectional studies\nof populations older than 55\u00ad60 years and this age association\ncontinues to increase in populations at the most advanced ages.2,3,5\nMost X-inactivation studies have been performed on peripheral blood\ncells, but a higher frequency of skewed X inactivation in elderly\nwomen has also been found in buccal swab cells.6,7\nMost X-inactivation studies use an indirect assay targeted to a\nmethylation site and polymorphic sequence named the HUMARA\nassay. The representativeness of this indirect method for studying\nX inactivation has been questioned. Recently, however, skewing of\nX inactivation in aging women was confirmed by two transcriptional-\nbased assays.8\nThere are two main hypotheses as to why DS increases with age in\ncross-sectional studies. One is that DS increases with age within the\nsame individual and the other is that DS is associated with life\nexpectancy in women. Only weak evidence has been published for\nthe first hypothesis, while the latter hypothesis has not been studied\npreviously. In this study, we aim to test the survival hypothesis by\ninvestigating whether DS is associated with mortality. We therefore\ninvestigate the relationship between DS and mortality registered in a\nnationwide database register. In addition, the study was replicated by\nthe analysis of a subset of the sample using the statistically powerful\ntwin intra-pair analysis, which also controls for genetic and familial\nenvironmental factors.\nStudy population\nThe subjects were female participants of three population-based nationwide\nsurveys conducted at the University of Southern Denmark: The Longitudinal\nStudy of Aging Danish Twins (LSADT), The Danish 1905 Cohort Study and the\nDanish Centenarian Study.\nLSADT is a longitudinal study of Danish twins aged 70 years and older. The\nsurvey, in which full blood samples were taken, and included 78 monozygotic\n(MZ) and 92 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs.\nThe Danish 1905 Cohort Study is a prospective investigation of an entire\nbirth cohort.

Each survey of the LSADTand\nthe 1905 Cohort Study comprises multidimensional face-to-face interviews\nfocusing on health and lifestyle issues, as well as objective assessments of\ncognitive and physical abilities.9\u00ad11\nThe Danish Centenarian Study is a nationwide epidemiological survey of all\npersons living in Denmark who celebrated their 100th birthday during a\nwere still alive and were revisited. These were included in this study. All three\nstudies were approved by the Danish Scientific\u00adEthical Committees.\nX-chromosome inactivation\nDNA was extracted from peripheral blood using standard procedures.\nThe X-chromosome inactivation pattern has been determined previously by\na PCR analysis of a polymorphic CAG repeat and a methylation-sensitive site in\nthe androgen receptor gene.3,5,12 The DS was defined as a number between\nextremely skewed pattern, where most or all cells had either the maternal or the\npaternal X as the active X chromosome. The most common thresholds of X\ninactivation are a DS above 75, 80 or 90. However, using a predefined grouping\nof a quantitative measure forces the outcome a priori to be similar in the\ngroups, despite what the data supports. Hence, we grouped DS into quartiles,\nwhich is a more flexible way to analyze the association between X inactivation\nand mortality having no previous assumption of the association.\nSurvival\nEach participant was followed from the baseline interview date until\n31 December 2009, in the Danish Civil Registration system, which registers\ndate of death.13 Hence, there was no loss to follow-up as none of the\nparticipants emigrated.\nStatistical analyses\nCox's proportional hazards models were performed to study the association\nbetween DS and mortality. A linear model was applied with DS as a continuous\nvariable, and in order to take into account potential nonlinearity, DS was\ndivided into quartiles. Since the mortality was similar in the second, third and\nfourth quartile, we also analyzed the association between mortality and DS\ndivided into the first quartile and the others. Those in the first lower quartile\n(50rDSr63) are referred to as low DS and those in the upper three quartiles\n(DS464) as skewed X inactivation. In all models, age was the underlying\ntimescale and risk was assessed from the age at blood sampling to age at death\nor end of follow-up at the end of 2009, whatever came first, thereby adjusting\nfor age.14 Alternative models also adjusted for physical and cognitive function-\ning measures, which are strong predictors of survival among elderly and the\nAs the data partly pertain to twin pairs, and because observation within twin\npairs might be correlated, the Cox's proportional hazards models were\nperformed using the robust estimator of variance, assuming independence\nbetween pairs.16 The proportional hazard assumption underlying the Cox\nmodels was tested using the Schoenfeld residual test and fulfilled the require-\nments for the Cox model.\nIntra-pair analyses were performed by calculating the proportion of times\nthe co-twin who had the lowest DS died first. This proportion was compared to\nthe null hypothesis of equality (50/50) by using the standard binomial test. We\nanalyzed trends with a conditional logistic regression to study the association\nbetween increasing intra-pair DS and survival, and tested for interaction terms\nbetween twin pairs age, zygosity and intra-pair DS. Statistical analyses were\ncarried out using Stata 10.1 (STATA Corp., College Station, TX, USA).\nRESULTS\nThe LSADT twins, the 1905 Cohort members and the centenarians\ncomprised together 500 female participants. After the follow-up\nAfter 6 years of follow-up, all 21 centenarians were deceased. In total,\n72% of the 500 participants died during follow-up (Table 1).\nThe hazard ratio of DS estimated as a linear effect showed\ntendencies to lower hazard ratio by approximately 4% per 10 DS\nwomen with low DS (1 quartile) had a higher hazard compared to\nwomen in the other quartiles, which indicate that the association is\nproperly not linear in the entire DS range. Women with low DS had a\nsignificantly higher hazard compared with the majority of women in\nthe three top quartiles who had a more skewed X inactivation (hazard\nhigher mortality risk during the 13-year follow-up period. The hazard\nratios were similar and the analysis of low DS versus a more skewed\nX inactivation was still statistically significant after adjustment for\ncognitive and physical abilities.\nOf the 170 twin pairs, where both co-twins participated, 10 pairs\nwere discarded from further analysis because their DS was identical.\nFor 127 of the remaining 160 pairs, one or both of the twins had died,\nand of these 59 were MZ and 68 were DZ twin pairs. Figure 1 shows\nthat for DZ twins with a difference in DS of more than 13 (top 50%),\nthe twin with the lowest DS died first in 71% of the pairs (proportion:\nintra-pair difference of DS was associated with increased mortality risk\n(P\u00bc0.019). When all 68 DZ twin pairs were included, the twin with\nthe lowest DS died first in 60% of the pairs (proportion: 0.60; 95% CI:\n0.48\u00ad0.72). For MZ twins, there was no evidence that it was more\nTable 1 Descriptive characteristics of age, mortality and X inactivation\nAge\nX inactivation\naIndividuals for whom more than 95% or more of the blood cells had either the maternal or the paternal X as the active X-chromosome.\nbIndividuals for whom more than 80% or more of the blood cells had either the maternal or the paternal X as the active X-chromosome.\nSkewed X inactivation and survival\nJ Mengel-From et al\nEuropean Journal of Human Genetics\ncommon that the twin with the lowest DS died first (proportion: 0.56;\nsignificant interaction between zygosity and DS (P\u00bc0.038), suggesting\nthat genetic factors could be the basis for the DS\u00admortality association\nDISCUSSION\nThe life expectancy for both women and men has increased in\ndeveloped countries over the past two centuries. Twin studies have\nshown that genetic factors account for approximately 25% of the\nvariance in human lifespan. The genetic influences on lifespan are\nminimal before the age of 60 years, but increase thereafter and appear\nto be biggest at the most advanced ages.18,19 Presently, the e4 allele of\nthe APOE gene is the only known common variant with a substantial\neffect on survival at advanced age,20 whereas others, such as the\nFOXO3A gene, have a modest effect.21 Telomere length is also\nassociated with both age-related changes and mortality, but is not a\nstrong predictor for the remaining lifespan.22 These genetic and\nepigenetic factors are mostly identical for women and men.22,23\nUniquely for women, life expectancies could be as a result of the\nmosaicism caused by X inactivation, as they have a choice between two\ncipants in the three cohorts showed that mortality was higher for\nfemales with a low DS (50rDSr63) compared to females with a\nmore skewed pattern (DS463). As our analyses were carried out\nwithout an a priori hypothesis of association with mortality, and our\nanalysis did not include correction for multiple testing, it cannot be\nruled out that our finding is caused by a Type 1 error. However, the\nevidence was strengthened by the association between mortality and\nlower DS in an intra-pair analysis using the most discordant DZ twin\npairs, although the association was not found in MZ twin pairs.\nPrevious twin studies have shown that DS intra-class correlation is\nsignificantly higher for MZ twins than for DZ twins, indicating a\ngenetic effect on DS, and X-inactivation pattern has a heritability of\n0.63 in young and 0.58 in elderly twins.3 This heritability indicates that\nthe age-related skewing of X inactivation could be determined by a\nselection for or against cells with a particular X chromosome as the\nactive X chromosome.\nThere are many clinical examples of selective advantages in X-linked\ndisorders. In the X-linked adrenal leukodystrophy, there is a selective\nadvantage of the cell carrying the mutated gene on the active\nX chromosome.25 In most cases, the cell carrying the wild-type gene\non the active X has a selective advantage, leading to a totally skewed\nX inactivation in the carrier, for example, as reported for Wiskott\u00ad\nAldrich syndrome.26 However, in these examples selection probably\nstarts very early in life. A different situation is found in some X-linked\nanemias, where the age-related skewing leads to the manifestation of\nthe disease in elderly female carriers.27\u00ad29\nThese selection processes in X-linked disorders do not explain why\nthe frequency of the age-related skewed X inactivation has been shown\nto be higher in females 455\u00ad60 years of age in several cross-sectional\nstudies.2,3,5 Likewise, these processes do not explain why females with\nlow DS have higher mortality compared to those with a more skewed\npattern. It is possible that one or more genes affect both the DS and\nlongevity, for example, because association between DS and mortality\nwas marked in intra-pair analyses of DZ twin compared to MZ twins.\nIn our earlier cross-sectional study, only 7% of women 19\u00ad65 years of\nIntra-pair Difference\nIntra-pair Difference\nDZ twins MZ twins\nFigure 1 Proportion of twin pairs aged 73\u00ad94 years, where the twin with the lowest DS died first during a 13-year follow-up period. The figure shows the\nproportion of twin pairs, where the twin with the lowest DS died first according to the magnitude of the intra-pair difference. The proportions are also\ndisplayed as fractions within the parenthesis. Each line indicates the 95% CI of the proportions. Above each line is the P-value from the binomial test,\nwhich tests if the proportion equals to 0.5.\nTable 2 Mortality (HR) and degree of skewing of X inactivation in all 500 female participants, all above 73 years of age\nDegree of skewing Min.\u00adMax. value No. ind.

However, we cannot\nexclude that our study does not have the power to detect such an\nassociation. The age-related increase is likely to be caused mainly by\nindividual increases in DS with age. However, the reduced number of\nelderly with low DS (lowest quartile) could at least partly be due to\npopulation selection by mortality. Few studies of longitudinal mea-\nsurements of X inactivation in the same females over time have been\nreported. X-inactivation pattern analyzed in peripheral granulocytes,\nmonocytes and T cells in 35 blood donors aged 20\u00ad75 years was not\nsignificantly different in repeated measures of samples drawn\n18 months later.30 The authors concluded that no fluctuation of\nX-inactivation pattern occurred in these blood cells in this time\nperiod. Similarly, no differences were found between most of the\nsamples taken about two decades apart from 178 females aged 5\u00ad75\nyears. Only in the few samples where the age at the time of the second\nsampling was more than 60 years, a tendency to a more skewed\nX inactivation in the second sample was found.4 Thus, there is little\nevidence that skewing of X inactivation in individuals with age is a\ncommon phenomenon, at least before the age of 60 years. Individual\nchanges of skewing of X inactivation over time at more advanced ages\nthus remains to be confirmed in longitudinal studies.\nOur results should be replicated; however, we propose that age-\nrelated skewed X inactivation may be partly due to population\nselection with lower mortality among those with higher DS. Since\nthis selection scenario is unique for women, it would be most relevant\nto study skewed X inactivation and its relation to common age-related\ndiseases. Little is known about X inactivation and common diseases,\nexcept for breast cancer, which has been widely studied, but with\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\n"
