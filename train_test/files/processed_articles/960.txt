Nattinger4\n \nUniversity of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston.\n4Department of Internal Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee.\nBackground. Breast cancer care, such as utilization of screening procedures and types of treatment received, varies\nsubstantially by geographic region of the United States. However, little is known about variations in survival with breast\ncancer.\nMethods. We examined breast cancer incidence, survival, and mortality in the 66 health service areas covered by the\nSurveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program for women aged 65 and older at diagnosis. Incidence and\nsurvival data were derived from SEER, while breast cancer mortality data were from Vital Statistics data.\nResults. There was considerable variation in breast cancer survival among the 66 health service areas (2  202.7,\np  .0001). There was also significant variation in incidence and mortality from breast cancer. In a partial correlation\nweighted for the size of the health service area, both incidence (r  .812) and percent 5-year survival (r  .587) cor-\nrelate with mortality. In a Poisson regression analysis, the combination of variation in incidence and variation in survival\nexplains 90.9% of the variation in mortality.\nConclusions. There is considerable geographic variation in survival from breast cancer among older women, and\nthis contributes to variation in breast cancer mortality. Geographic variations in breast cancer mortality should diminish\nas the quality of breast cancer care becomes more standardized.\nARIATIONS in the rate of diseases across different\npopulations and geographic areas provide powerful\nclues in studies of disease etiology. For example, Doll and\nPeto relied primarily on such information to conclude that\nthe great majority of cancers were environmentally deter-\nmined, for example, tobacco, diet, pollutants, and others (1).\nMuch of the information on geographic variation in cancer\nrates comes from Vital Statistics mortality data, which are\nused as a proxy indicator of disease incidence. However,\nmortality rate from any disease is a function of both the in-\ncidence rate and the survival rate of persons with the dis-\nease. Diseases with high mortality and short survival exhibit\na very close relationship between incidence rate and mortal-\nity rate (2\u00ad4). In contrast, in diseases with a substantial\nchance for cure, factors that affect survival, such as early di-\nagnosis and treatment, should have an important effect on\nmortality rates.\nThere are well-described, stable geographic variations in\nmortality rates from breast cancer in the United States.\nThese exist at a regional level (e.g., Northwest vs South)\nand also at the level of small areas (e.g., census tracts within\na state) (5\u00ad10). The geographic differences have stimulated\nconsiderable research about their cause, such as regional\ndifferences in diet or differences in proximity to high-volt-\nage electric lines. One factor common to these investiga-\ntions is the assumption that variation in mortality from\nbreast cancer reflects variation in incidence of breast cancer.\nWe have previously argued that regional variations in breast\ncancer mortality may reflect differences in survival as well\nas differences in incidence (6). In this report, we test that\nhypothesis by examining the variations in incidence, sur-\nvival, and mortality from breast cancer among different\nhealth service areas (HSAs). HSAs are aggregations of\ncounties based on a cluster analysis of where Medicare pa-\ntients obtained routine hospital care in 1988 (11). They are a\ngood tool to examine variations in medical practice and out-\ncomes across small areas (12). We assess the relation of any\nvariation in incidence and survival to the variation in breast\ncancer mortality. We use data from the Surveillance, Epide-\nmiology, and End Results (SEER) program to assess inci-\ndence and survival, and Vital Statistics data to determine\nbreast cancer mortality rates.\nMETHODS\nSubjects\nEligible women for our study include those who were age\nareas. Our specific cohort of breast cancer subjects consists\nof women identified with incident breast cancer in 1985\u00ad\nV\nSources of Data\nSEER tumor registry.--The National Cancer Institute's\nSEER program supports population-based tumor registries\nin selected geographic areas. In 1985, these areas included\nthe metropolitan areas of San Francisco/Oakland, Detroit,\nAtlanta, and Seattle, and the states of Connecticut, Iowa,\nNew Mexico, Utah, and Hawaii (13). These areas cover ap-\nproximately 14% of the U.S. population. SEER's own qual-\nity assurance checks report a high degree of completeness of\ndetermining incident cancers. SEER incidence rates are\nused to project to the total U.S. population to estimate the\nnational incidence rates for various cancers.\nThe SEER Public Use File is the source of data for esti-\nmating incidence and survival rates. For all incident breast\ncancer cases, the file includes month and year of diagnosis,\ncounty of residence, and period of follow-up. If the subject\nhas died, the file also contains the date of death and cause of\ndeath as coded on the state death certificate with ICD-9\ncodes.\nNational Center for Health Statistics mortality data\nfiles.--Mortality data from the National Center for Health\nmortality rates at the county level. Each record in these files\nrepresents one death and includes data elements on the de-\ncedent's age, gender, county of residence, and underlying\ncause of death. The source of these data is information re-\ncorded on death certificates filed for deaths in each of the 50\nstates. In our analyses of the mortality data, the death is al-\nlocated to the county of the decedent's residence, not where\ndeath occurred.\nHealth Service Area\nOur study uses the HSA definitions that are used in the\nAtlas of United States Mortality to illustrate geographic dif-\nferences in death rates for selected causes of death (12).\nThese HSAs are based on those identified by the National\nCenter for Health Statistics to define one or more counties\nthat are \"relatively self-contained with respect to the provi-\nsion of routine hospital care\" (11). HSAs were formed by\napplying a clustering algorithm on travel patterns of patients\nfor their hospital care. The objective was to form areas\nwhere residents in these areas were more likely to use rou-\ntine hospital services in the area than outside it. The SEER\nPublic Use File contains population, incidence, and survival\ninformation at the county level. These counties were aggre-\ngated into HSAs using a file that maps U.S. counties by\nFederal Information Processing Standards codes (a two-\ndigit state number followed by a three-digit county number)\nto its corresponding HSA. This file is included in the Atlas\nof United States Mortality CD-ROM.\nFigure 1.

The 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles are shown by\nhorizontal lines. Incidence was calculated from SEER data; mortality was calculated from Vital Statistics data; and survival was calculated as\npercent breast cancer-specific 5-year survival generated by Kaplan-Meier survival curves from SEER data. For incidence and survival, we used\nThe SEER areas analyzed in this study contained 72 of\nthe 805 HSAs. Smaller HSAs were aggregated within SEER\narea to yield clusters with a minimum of five expected\n(Iowa).\nIncidence, Mortality, and Survival Rates\nIncidence rates by HSA were calculated for each age\ngroup using the number of incident cases and population es-\ntimates provided by the SEER program. Likewise, age-spe-\ncific breast cancer mortality rates were generated from esti-\nmates of the number of breast cancer deaths using the\nmortality data files and the SEER population estimates. In-\nformation on the date of death, underlying cause of death,\nand period of follow-up in the SEER database allows us to\ngenerate 5-year Kaplan-Meier survival rates for each HSA.\nEvents were comprised of breast cancer-specific deaths\n(ICD-9 174xx). Deaths from all other causes were censored.\nThese 5-year survival rates were generated for each year\nanalysis.\nAnalysis\nBreast cancer survival among the HSAs was initially ex-\namined with Kaplan-Meier survival curves, and their homo-\ngeneity was assessed with the log rank test. Geographic\nvariations in incidence and mortality were modeled using\nPoisson regression with HSA as an independent variable.\nThe relationships between incidence and mortality and be-\ntween survival and mortality were examined with bubble\nplots, Pearson correlation coefficients, partial correlation\ncoefficients, and Poisson regression models. The correlation\nestimates were based on weighted least squares because the\nHSAs (the unit of observation) differ greatly in size. Treat-\ning each HSA with equal weight resulted in correlation co-\nefficients being driven by HSAs with a small number of\nbreast cancer cases. The statistical tests of significance and\nassociated p values were derived from Poisson regression\nbecause the assumptions are more suitable for estimating vi-\ntal rates. All computations and data management were done\nusing the SAS version 6.12 statistical application (SAS In-\nstitute, Cary, NC) (14).\nRESULTS\nFigure 1 shows the distribution of incidence, mortality,\nand percent 5-year survival from breast cancer among the\n66 HSAs in the nine SEER areas. There is considerable\nvariation in all three measurements. There are a number of\nways to demonstrate that this variation is not simply ran-\ndom. For example, when the incidence and mortality rates\nwere modeled using Poisson regression, HSA was a signifi-\ncant predictor (p  .0001) for both models. Kaplan-Meier\nsurvival curves indicated significantly different survival\nFigure 2 shows the relationship between incidence of\nbreast cancer and breast cancer mortality for each of the 66\nHSAs.

As\nexpected, there is a clear correlation between incidence and\nmortality, with a weighted correlation coefficient r  .733\nFigure 3 shows the relationship between breast cancer\nsurvival and breast cancer mortality for each of the 66\nFigure 2.

The R2\n(generalized coefficient of determination) (15) for the model\nincluding both incidence and survival is .909, indicating\nthat the combination of incidence and survival from breast\ncancer explains approximately 91% of the total variation in\nbreast cancer mortality among the 66 HSAs. These associa-\ntions are all statistically significant.\nDISCUSSION\nThe results of this study can be summarized as follows.\nThere is considerable variation among the 66 health service\nareas within SEER tumor registries in breast cancer mortal-\nity rates, as assessed by Vital Statistics data, and in incidence\nFigure 3. Bubble plot of breast cancer mortality (from Vital Statistics data) versus breast cancer survival (from the Surveillance, Epidemiol-\nogy, and End Results [SEER] data) for each of the 66 health service areas (HSAs) within the areas covered by SEER. The correlation (by\nweighted least squares) of survival to mortality was .335. Larger HSAs had more influence on this correlation than did smaller ones.\nTable 1. Simple and Partial Correlations of Breast Cancer\nIncidence and Breast Cancer Survival to Breast Cancer Mortality\nAge Group Variable Simple Correlation Partial Correlation\nNote: HSA  health service area.\n*The simple and partial correlation coefficients are derived from weighted\nleast squares regression. A positive simple correlation coefficient between inci-\ndence and mortality indicates that as the incidence increases, so does the mortal-\nity, with more populous HSAs having greater influence on the coefficient of cor-\nrelation than smaller ones. Conversely, the negative coefficient values between\nsurvival and mortality indicate an increase in survival corresponded with a de-\ncrease in mortality. The weighted partial correlation coefficients have a similar\ninterpretation, except that the relationship with mortality adjusts for the effects\nof the other variable (either incidence or survival). Here again, the larger HSAs\nhave a greater impact on the simple and partial correlation coefficients.\nTable 2.

In a partial correlation, both variation in 5-year breast\ncancer-specific survival as well as variation in breast cancer\nincidence are highly correlated with breast cancer mortality\namong the 66 health service areas. Together, variation in in-\ncidence and survival explained 90% of the variation in\nbreast cancer mortality.\nWhy might there be variation in survival after a diagnosis\nof breast cancer among different HSAs? Survival is affected\nby tumor biology, stage at diagnosis, and choice of treat-\nment. Tumor characteristics, such as histologic grade, vary\nsomewhat among different races. Thus, differences in sur-\nvival among HSAs could be explained in part by the relative\nracial composition of the HSAs. Use of screening mammog-\nraphy, a major determinant of early diagnosis, has been\nshown to vary by region (8,16). In addition, several investi-\ngators have shown large geographic variations in the quality\nof treatment received for breast cancer, particularly among\nolder women (17\u00ad21). Substantial proportions of older\nwomen with breast cancer are receiving breast-conserving\nsurgery without axillary dissection or adjuvant irradiation\n(17\u00ad27). Such treatment is associated with a two-fold higher\nmortality rate in population-based studies, and it is not rec-\nommended by any authority or expert panel (23,25).\nPerhaps the best-known example of differences in sur-\nvival rates driving differences in mortality rates in breast\ncancer is in black-white differences; age-adjusted mortality\nrates from breast cancer are approximately 20% higher\namong African American women compared with non-His-\npanic whites, while the incidence rates for blacks are ap-\nproximately 12% lower (2,28). Had only the mortality rates\nbeen examined, it might have been erroneously concluded\nthat breast cancer incidence is greater in black than in white\nwomen, but in reality the higher mortality rates are entirely\nsecondary to the poorer survival experience of African\nAmerican women with breast cancer (29).\nThere are a number of limitations to this study. First, the\nanalyses were all ecological, at the level of the HSA and not\nat the level of the individual. Second, the associations\namong breast cancer incidence or survival on the one hand\nand breast cancer mortality on the other do not prove a\ncausal relationship. Third, the findings were obtained in\ndata from women aged 65 and older and may not reflect the\npattern found in younger women.\nMost studies of geographic differences in breast cancer\nmortality have assumed that such differences reflect differ-\nences in the incidence of breast cancer in different areas\n(5,7,9,10). These findings have in turn stimulated consider-\nable research into the possible causes of such differences in\nbreast cancer incidence (9,30\u00ad32). Our results confirm that\nmortality differences do indeed reflect differences in inci-\ndence, but they also show that an additional contributor to\ndifferences in mortality from breast cancer are geographic\ndifferences in survival. If the large geographic differences\nin breast cancer mortality are considered entirely secondary\nto differences in incidence of breast cancer, then there are\nno obvious steps to reduce those differences; that is, there\nare no generally accepted measures to reduce breast cancer\nincidence. On the other hand, the recognition that survival\nplays a role in geographic differences in breast cancer mor-\ntality would suggest that cancer control efforts directed to\nstandardize the quality of breast cancer care would also di-\nminish the geographic variations in breast cancer mortality.\n"
