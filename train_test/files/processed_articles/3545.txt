    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis study offers an in-depth examination of the experiences of early childhood educators, focusing on their work with\nEthiopian immigrant children and their families. We aim to describe and analyze the teachers' insider views vis-\u00e0-vis the\nchallenges faced by these children and their parents in the Israeli preschool system. Using narrative methodology, the\nanalysis of findings is based upon 20 stories written by 10 early childhood educators. It reveals that for these teachers,\nthe chief struggle is their relationship with the parents of their Ethiopian pupils, one characterized by difficulties, frustrations,\nand burdens. The engagement with parents of Ethiopian children exhibited a range of possibilities: from the expression of\npatronizing, hierarchical viewpoints, to a search for ad hoc ways of coping with a persistent cultural gap, to the attainment\nof genuine, successful partnerships. Lack of sufficient knowledge and understanding of the unique cultural attributes of\nthe Ethiopian community appears to be the basis for the teachers' view of the parents as lacking faith in them and in the\neducational system as a whole. In addition, suggestions are made about implications for educational practice and for policies\nthat might assist teachers in ameliorating these challenges via the development of, and professional training in, skills which\nhelp coping with the problems and dilemmas unique to the multicultural classroom.\n",

They work in autonomous profes-\nsional units, each consisting of the teacher, a semi-professional\nassistant, and up to 35 children per class. Like other teachers,\nthey have been found to suffer from overwork, but particularly\nkindergarten teachers in Israel are the unmet needs of support,\nsharing, and professional recognition. This situation has cre-\nated the simultaneous experience of loneliness on one hand,\nand satisfaction with their autonomy and status within their\nown professional world on the other (Firstater, 2012). In this\nstudy, we explore the question of what can be learned from the\nteachers' experiences of working with Ethiopian children in\nkindergarten.\nKindergarten teachers' perceptions, experiences, and pro-\nfessional knowledge have implications for their work with chil-\ndren of Ethiopian origin. Analyzing the kindergarten teachers'\nstories enabled an examination of how they perceived the\nbeliefs and social norms of Ethiopian society, how the teachers\nrelated to the immigrants' values, and how they coped with\neducating immigrant children from a different culture.\nTeachers' Attitudes Toward Families and Children\nFrom a Minority Culture\nSuccessful multicultural education is linked to teachers' atti-\ntudes and self-awareness, as well as to their willingness to\n1Gordon College of Education, Haifa, Israel\n2Oranim Academic College of Education, Kiryat Tivon, Israel\nCorresponding Author:\nEsther Firstater, Gordon College of Education, 73 Tchernichovsky St.,\nEmail: estyf@gordon.ac.il\nThe Experiences of Israeli Early Childhood\nEducators Working With Children of\nEthiopian Background\nEsther Firstater1, Laura I.

These problems may prevent\nthe children from receiving effective developmental support\nthat does not pressure them to disregarding their cultural iden-\ntities and does not diminish their pride in their cultures of ori-\nNotwithstanding the empathy educators express toward such\nchildren in conjunction with listing all the challenges involved,\nthe teachers are also often critical toward the children's cul-\ntural worlds, perceiving these cultures as factors that hinder\nthe students' achievement levels and affect their attitudes to\nlearning. Joshi, Eberly, and Konzal (2005) have examined\nteachers' levels of understanding of the cultures of their stu-\ndents' families and the implications of this understanding for\nthe teachers' attitudes toward the parents. Although on the\nconceptual level the teachers appreciate the importance of the\nculture and its influences on the children, these educators are\nnot adequately equipped to translate this understanding into\npractice, instead emphasizing only external aspects of the cul-\nture such as food, clothing, celebrations, and stories.\nThe rapid increase in immigration rates of people with\ndifferent ethnic origins in the Western world and the subse-\nquent demand that teachers develop culturally sensitive\nlearning programs are usually not supported with appropriate\ntraining to provide mainstream education for children from\nvaried backgrounds (Santoro, 2009). In Israeli culture, it is\ndifficult to implement the multicultural approach, to change\nteaching methods and educational programs, and to recog-\nnize and integrate the children's cultural backgrounds (Geldi,\n2009). To this end, training is required for culturally respon-\nsive teaching (Han & Thomas, 2010), including increasing\nawareness and sensitivity to intercultural differences as well\nas multicultural knowledge about the values, worldviews,\nand norms of both the teachers and children. Also necessary\nis the development of relevant proficiencies, such as the abil-\nity to establish a \"skilled dialogue\" in the relationship\nbetween children and their families from different cultural\nbackgrounds (Barrera & Corso, 2002). Increasing parents'\ntrust and sense of belonging can lead to the development of\nan environment that respects cultural differences and invites\nall students to accept and explore new, unfamiliar cultures\n(Purnell, Ali, Begum, & Carter, 2007); other positive results\ninclude the creation of communication channels that will\nEarly childhood is an especially suitable stage at which to\nbegin educating toward multiculturalism. At this young age,\nthrough appropriate mediation, racist attitudes can be\nchanged and prejudices reduced (Ogletree & Larke, 2010).\nThis goal can be achieved by designing a learning environ-\nment that reflects the values of its students, adapting learning\nprograms, and giving children the opportunity to present and\ndescribe their society's customs with pride (Chavkin, 2005).\nEducators Working With Families From Diverse\nCultures\nWorking with preschool-age children in general--and from\ndiffering cultural backgrounds in particular--demands the\ndevelopment of a relationship with the pupil's family.\nAccording to Berm\u00fadez and M\u00e1rquez (1996), the primary\ncommunication barriers between teachers and parents from\ndifferent cultural backgrounds are related to differences in\nlanguage, education, and child-rearing methods. These barri-\ners are also related to the parents' troubled relationships with\nthe educational system, relationships characterized by unfa-\nmiliarity, bad experiences, and lack of understanding, lead-\ning to a lack of trust. These problems are exacerbated by\nteachers' prejudices, lack of sensitivity, and sometimes even\nblame directed toward the families for their supposed lack of\nvalues and for not educating their children in accord with\nwhat the teachers believe to be an appropriate manner\nWhen the families of immigrant children are disconnected\nfrom the kindergarten, the children become a vulnerable\ngroup that does not receive a good educational foundation\nprior to starting school, resulting in significant gaps from the\nstart of these students' school careers (Pelletier & Corter,\n2005). The best way of involving parents from different cul-\ntural backgrounds is to maintain open communication chan-\nnels, to hold discussions in which parents and teachers can\nbecome acquainted with each other's cultures, as well as to\norganize activities in the classroom that respect multicultur-\nalism and the principle of inclusion (Joshi et al., 2005).\nChildren from minority cultures have a much better\nchance of academic success when the school builds partner-\nships with their families and learns about their values and\ncustoms. This openness serves to create a safe learning envi-\nronment for minority groups and increases their sense of\nbelonging, which is crucial to success in the classroom\nWegmann & Bowen, 2010). Furthermore, Berm\u00fadez and\nM\u00e1rquez (1996) have demonstrated that immigrant families\nwho are involved in their children's education are more suc-\ncessful in helping them progress.\nThe Integration of Ethiopian Immigrants Into the\nIsraeli Educational System\nMost Ethiopian Jews arrived in Israel in two large waves in the\nup to the present day. By 2009, the Ethiopian population in\nFirstater et al. 3\n2009). Their absorption was made more difficult because of\ntheir skin color, doubts about the authenticity of their\nJewishness, their low educational levels, broad cultural differ-\nences, their concentration in distressed neighborhoods, and the\nlimited opportunities available to them in employment. In\naddition, Ethiopian immigrants were stigmatized as a \"differ-\nent\" and \"problematic\" community (Leibel, 2009; Shabtay,\n2001). These difficulties resulted in psychological stress, a\nsense of disappointment and affront, crises within the family,\nand a sense of foreignness because of their skin color, which\nhindered their acceptance as equals in Israeli society (Walsh &\nThe Ethiopian immigrants--who experienced a sudden\ntransition from a rural, agricultural culture to a Western,\nindustrialized society--were required to cope with a multi-\nplicity of changes. Their consciousness of difference from\nthe rest of Israeli society was expressed in oppositional atti-\ntudes toward figures of authority, the withholding of nega-\ntive emotions, and avoidance of asking questions, making\nrequests, or taking initiative. Helplessness, confusion, mis-\nunderstanding, the sense of a lack of control, and weakening\nof mutual familial support were other expressions of the\nchallenges of cross-cultural adaptation (BenEzer, 1992).\nThese cultural changes and immigration difficulties\naffected the children's absorption into the Israeli educa-\ntional system. Typical of this process was their separation\nfrom other students as a result of their high concentration\nin distressed neighborhoods with weak educational institu-\ntions. Ethiopian immigrant children therefore encountered\nnative Israeli students mainly from disadvantaged seg-\nments of society. Also endemic in the educational system\nwas the indiscriminate referral of Ethiopian children to\nresidential facilities, conveying the message of a lack of\ntrust in the parents' ability to educate them, as well as the\noverreferral of these students to the special education sys-\ntem (Mulat & Arcavi, 2009). Consequently, Ethiopian chil-\ndren, who were already suffering from barriers and\nstereotypes because of their skin color, were found to\nunderachieve at school and in higher education and to have\na high rate of drop-out, dissociation, and delinquency\nGeiger (2012) found that, according to the children's\naccounts, teachers had negative attitudes toward them. In a\nstudy in Israel in which 232 sixth-grade students were inter-\nviewed about teachers' verbal violence, it was found that\nteachers tended to target immigrants from Ethiopia in verbal\nattacks, separate them from their classmates during games\nand parties, hint at their low levels of culture and education,\nand make insulting remarks about the parents' lack of educa-\ntion and inability to help their children.\nIn kindergartens in Israel, difficulties in relations with\nEthiopian students have been found to be based upon the\nabsence of an atmosphere of mutual respect as well as an\ninadequate understanding of Ethiopian cultural norms (Tzur\n& Eshel, 2003). One of the repercussions of these inadequa-\ncies has been the very slow development of trust in the edu-\ncational system among the parents of Ethiopian students\nCertain steps have already been taken in Israeli society to\ncope with these phenomena. They include the increased par-\nticipation of young, educated members of the Ethiopian\ncommunity in social and educational programs, the creation\nof intercultural bridging and initiatives for promoting inclu-\nsion in the educational system, and strengthening the involve-\nment and authority of Ethiopian parents (Sever, 2004).\nNevertheless, the issue of education in a multicultural soci-\nety poses a challenge of the highest degree at all levels of the\neducational system, starting in preschool education and con-\ntinuing through teacher training educational programs. The\nattitudes and approaches of educators toward this population\nare of vital significance to the future of these children.\nMethod\nThe aim of the present article is to provide an insider's view\nof the ways in which kindergarten teachers in Israel perceive\ntheir work with pupils of Ethiopian origin and their families.\nThenarrativemethodguidesourmethodology(Polkinghorne,\n1995), giving us the opportunity to learn about lived experi-\nence through the practical and personal knowledge recounted\nin teachers' written accounts (Bruner, 1987; Clandinin &\nSample\nParticipants in the present study were selected by purposive\nstories told by 10 participating kindergarten teachers, who\nhad professional experience working with Ethiopian chil-\ndren and their families. The choice of sample in qualitative\nresearch is based on conceptual and theoretical decisions\nguided by research aims. Purposive sampling allows access\nto a multiplicity of perspectives. In the case at hand, the\nselection criteria were kindergarten teachers who worked in\nthe North of Israel in low-income neighborhoods, where the\nhighest percentage of the Ethiopian community resides. The\nparticipants were between 30 and 55 years of age, and their\nwork experience as kindergarten teachers ranged from 5 to\nThese kindergarten teachers were prompted to write\ndown two separate stories about significant experiences\nthey had while teaching Ethiopian children. The stories\nwere to be written in an open manner, with the component\nparts of beginning, middle, and end (Lieblich et al., 1998).\nThe research aims were described in full to the participants\nwho wrote their stories by hand in their places of work.\nPseudonyms have been used to protect the promised ano-\nnymity of the participants.\n4 SAGE Open\nAnalysis\nData analysis included open coding to enable the identifica-\ntion of units of meaning. A cross-case analysis followed in\nwhich segments from each interview were condensed until\nThis process was completed by all three of the authors of this\nstudy separately, and then compared to ensure interceder\nreliability. The themes, which emerged from the analysis, are\ndifferentiated from the prompt to write about significant\nexperiences with Ethiopian children. For example, the theme\n\"Patronizing stances toward parents: `They smile and say\nyes, yes, and then continue in their own way',\" is based on\nseveral different accounts of the multiple ways that teachers\nshowed patronizing stances toward Ethiopian children and\ntheir families. Our cross-case analysis revealed that all those\ndifferent perspectives fall under a unified spectrum. This\nspectrum is the content of first theme. Three primary themes\nemerged from the data and serve as the backbone of our\nanalysis.\nTrustworthiness\nIn the present article, credibility is established through the\nsystematic presentation of written stories and their analyses,\na format that allows the reader to evaluate the ways in which\nreality was constructed and themes were derived (Maxwell,\n2005). In qualitative research, the emphasis shifts from\nvalidity to validation. Rather than presenting a finished prod-\nuct, researchers describe the process by which they arrived at\nthe specific constructions underlying the study, and thus\nallow readers to make their own judgments and to validate or\nreject the interpretations suggested (Angen, 2000; Patton,\n2002). For example, the theme \"They don't play by our\nrules\" is presented in the following manner: First, contextual\ninformation regarding the particular research participant is\noffered, followed by a segment of the narrative itself.\nAfterward, the analysis of the story component is presented,\nincluding the context, the structure, and its relationship to the\nunified theme as well as to the subsequent written account.\nThis detailed process is accessible to the reader in the presen-\ntation of findings, and as such serves as a validation tool for\nthe researcher's systematic work. The focus of such research\nis on in-depth, subjective analysis of experiences rather than\non generalizations. That being said, such an analysis also\nprovides a solid foundation for building a heuristic model on\nwhich studies aimed at rigorous generalizations can be based\nData Presentation and Analysis\nEmergent Themes\nThe primary theme that arose from the analysis of the data\nwas the importance of the teachers' interactions with the\nEthiopian pupils' parents. All of the written narratives\ncentered solely on the teachers' perceptions, relationships,\nand experiences with the children's parents, rather than on\ndaily interactions with the pupils themselves. Teachers' per-\nceptions of Ethiopian immigrant parents ranged from a lack\nof sensitivity toward these parents, to a desire to diminish\ncultural variation, to acceptance and understanding of such\ndifferences. This continuum included three primary types:\n(a) a patronizing stance toward parents, (b) a missionary\napproach that paternalistically aimed at assimilating immi-\ngrants, and (c) an open attitude toward learning from cross-\ncultural encounters and toward establishing mutual\npartnerships with parents. The written narratives selected\nand analyzed are representative illustrations of these types.\n1. Patronizing stances toward parents: \"They smile and\nsay yes, yes, and then continue in their own way.\"\nApatronizing stance proved to be a primary mode of relating to\nEthiopian parents. Teachers who adopted this stance tended to\nexhibit negative judgments and to criticize the perceived physi-\ncal neglect of these parents, for example, claiming that the chil-\ndren lacked personal hygiene, wore inappropriate clothing for\nsize and weather conditions, consumed an unhealthy diet, and\nfailed to adhere to kindergarten timetables--tardiness being\nespecially problematic. The teachers' belief that they were in a\nbetter position of knowing and understanding the best interests\nof the child was often accompanied by frustration caused by the\nparents' failure to accept the teacher's point of view and her\nefforts to control the situation and improve the students'\nsituation.\nRivka describes her frustration when an Ethiopian father\nrefused to allow his son to be referred to a special education\ncenter for remedial reinforcement. In the case at hand, the\nmother of the boy was at the time institutionalized in a men-\ntal health facility, and the boy was one of six children whom\nthe father solely cared for in the mother's absence. She\nwrites,\nLast year, I had an Ethiopian child whose mother was in a\nnuthouse [mental institution]. The children were cared for by the\nfather, and there was great neglect . . . The siblings would bring\nthe boy to the kindergarten, and sometimes no one bothered to\npick him up. The boy was bright, and it is clear that he had\npotential, if there would have been any type of investment from\nthe home and good and positive relations towards him. I\napproached the father and told him that his son needs professional\nhelp. The father refused and said that I should not make his son\ninto a \"crazy\" because he is not! . . . The boy continued to walk\nthe streets in the afternoons, had behavioral problems, and\nvented his aggression on other children. I pitied him so, but\ndespite everything that I tried to do to persuade the father,\nnothing helped. I heard that now it still goes on, and the boy\nreceives no help.\nRivka's patronizing position is reflected in her conviction\nand assumption that the core of the hardship of the Ethiopian\nchild is rooted solely in what she defines as a neglectful and\nFirstater et al. 5\nnegative home. She is the one who knows what is best for the\nchild and is slighted that her efforts for intervention are not\nrealized. Ironically, while she declares her sense of pity and\nconcern for the boy, it is she whose professional integrity is\nchallenged, and thus she becomes the center of the tale.\nWhile she believes strongly in her own professional fore-\nsight and even backs this up by offering proof of what hap-\npens subsequently, her particular solution for the child is\nexternalized as she recommends outside intervention, rather\nthan attempting to remedy the situation within her own kin-\ndergarten. She reveals little, if any sensitivity, to the fact that\nthis external, professional recommendation has particularly\nnegative connotations in the unique family situation of the\nfather, nor does she express sympathy for the emotional and\nlogistical struggles of a father parenting six children on his\nown. The teacher knows best; her advice is ignored; and the\nprophecy is not prevented. Not only is a child \"lost,\" but\nwhen the \"right\" help is not accepted, Rivka bears the emo-\ntional costs of professional disrespect.\nSimilarly, Hannah conveys her sense of insult that the\nnorms of her classroom management in the kindergarten are\nnot respected by an Ethiopian mother. The mother works\nnights and consistently brings her daughter late, insisting\nupon entering the kindergarten to see what is going on:\nWhen a mother brought her child late [to kindergarten], I went\nout to the gate and asked her to say goodbye to her daughter\noutside, like every other parent who comes late. She liked to\ncome into the kindergarten and see what we were doing. No\nmatter how much I tried to explain to her, I didn't succeed,\nand the mother insisted that she must go inside, and I didn't\nagree. The mother told the girl that they were leaving and\nwould never come back to the kindergarten. She took a step\nback, stopped, and said, \"If we were Israelis, you wouldn't\nspeak to me that way; it's only because we are Ethiopian.\" I\nwas insulted and hurt.\nHannah's working style expresses a strong need for order\nand control; the norms and codes of the kindergarten offer an\nimportant and needed structure for daily routines. Hannah\ntherefore takes matters into her own hands and physically\nstops the mother at the gate. Setting boundaries, in her eyes,\ntakes precedence over efforts toward interpersonal commu-\nnication. The desire of the mother to enter the kindergarten is\nseen only as a disruption of codes and order, and the possibil-\nity that positive outcomes could come from such an interac-\ntion is not considered. The communication style used by\nHannah leaves the mother feeling marginalized both physi-\ncally and emotionally, and this in turn evokes the sense that\nher foreignness is at the root of the insult she experiences.\nThe teacher's patronizing stance is revealed in bottom-down\ncommunication, both verbal and physical, clearly stating that\nit is the teacher who defines the sole accepted order and way\nof being in the kindergarten. Uncharacteristically for this\nimmigrant group, the mother outwardly articulates her expe-\nrience of discrimination. Despite the fact that the mother\ndirectly communicates her feelings of insult, as in Rivka's\nnarrative, it is the teachers' experience of insult and hurt that\nis placed at the center of the narrative.\nAs we have shown, these kindergarten teachers are\nambivalent as to how to relate to Ethiopian children and their\nfamilies. The teachers' narratives alternate between the wish\nto include Ethiopian immigrants and the need to assert their\nprofessional authority. The emotional response to what they\nperceive as a lack of cooperation is a painful sense of rejec-\ntion. It appears that they are willing to accept Ethiopian fami-\nlies, provided that the parents unquestioningly accept their\nauthority. As one of the teachers wrote, \"They smile and say\nyes, yes. And then continue in their own way.\"\n2. The missionary approach: \"Even though I present it\nas a free gift that will truly help the child.\"\nThe teachers in our study expressed a strong and genuine\ndesire to assist Ethiopian children and their families to accli-\nmate and become integrated into Israeli society and culture.\nHowever, by analyzing the written narratives of the partici-\npating teachers, it becomes apparent that they sometimes\nadopt an assimilationist approach toward this aim. While\ntheir aim is to help, they define help as teaching and educat-\ning the immigrants to conform to the norms of the majority.\nThis entails celebrating holidays and birthdays in the \"cus-\ntomary\" way, adhering to a particular diet, and accepting\nIsraeli parenting norms. Although the teachers display a\nstrong altruistic desire to help, this help is coupled with a\nvery clear message that there is one correct way to be Israeli.\nClara relates to her efforts to educate and socialize the\nkindergarten parents on dietary matters, explaining her frus-\ntration when the Ethiopian parents do not follow suit. She\nwrites,\nI see improvements with most of the kindergarten parents as a\nresult of my advice and guidance. It is only the Ethiopians who\ncontinue to send their children food without paying attention to\nmy guidelines to provide variety. They send sweet things, and\nsweet drinks; this is despite the fact that I prohibit it.\nClara is the one in control and believes that her authority is\nfor the ultimate benefit of all. She feels slighted that despite\nher pure and good intentions to create what she sees as posi-\ntive health changes for the children, her advice is ignored,\nand she emphasizes that it is solely the Ethiopian parents\nwho refuse to follow her important instructions. By seeing\nthem as under her control, she infantilizes them, failing to\nfully recognize the parents' own agency.\nShoshana is an experienced kindergarten teacher. She\nexplains in her written narrative the ways in which she is\nchallenged by the refusal of a parent to follow her profes-\nsional advice, in this case the referral of an Ethiopian child to\nan inclusive education committee for him to receive addi-\ntional remedial teaching with a specialist.\n6 SAGE Open\nI've been working with this population for 10 years already, and\nit is still hard for me to accept the reactions. Where does this\nresistance to receiving help come from? Even though I present it\nas a free gift that will truly help the child's progress. After that\nincident, I felt frustrated and unprofessional since I wasn't able\nto convince the parent when I saw how badly the boy needed\nhelp. When I asked that the parents come to the Inclusive\nEducation Committee, so that the boy could receive professional\nhelp, they refused to cooperate. Even at the expense that he\nwould not receive the help that he needs.\nShoshanna bears the burden of her inability to actualize her\ndesire to help an Ethiopian child. However, she does not\nplace the locus of blame on herself, but rather on the parents,\nbecause of their refusal to accept assistance. Throughout her\n10 years of experience with this population, she has consis-\ntently found herself left on the sidelines, marginalized in her\nefforts to enact what she perceives as a kind, well-intentioned\nattempt to help. This is experienced as emotional hardship,\nand she and the parents remain distinct and oppositional enti-\nties. An ever-present lack of mutual trust has not dissipated\ndespite long years of genuine effort and good intentions.\nThe missionary stance highlights the cultural gap between\nthe teachers and the parents. We see from this pattern that in\nadapting an assimilationist approach to the integration of\nthese children, the teachers themselves wind up feeling bur-\ndened with frustration as well as a sense of hardship which\nthey are left to cope with on their own. The lack of mutual\ntrust between teachers and parents is characteristic of the\nmissionary approach.\n3. Learning from cross-cultural encounters: \"It was like\nrain on a summer's day.\"\nA third approach which emerged from the data reflects an\nattitude of cultural sensitivity. Through experience-based\npractice, accompanied by emotional connections to the par-\nents, teachers learn to find solutions to challenges as they\narise. Rina writes of the preparations for the Chanukah cele-\nbration in the kindergarten, an occasion which she decides to\nuse as an opportunity for multicultural inclusion. Her idea is\nthat the Chanukah prayer should be recited by the parents,\nnot only in Hebrew, as is customary, but also in the other two\nspoken languages of the parents:\nThe incident happened at Chanukah. It was my first year in the\nkindergarten, and I wanted to bring people together, to join\nhearts, and bring things together through something that unites\nall Israelis. At the Chanukah party, I decided that the blessing for\nlighting the Chanukah candles would be said in three languages:\nHebrew, Russian, andAmharic (the Ethiopians'native language).\nI asked the Ethiopian parents [at the Chanukah party] to\nparticipate, and nearly everyone refused. I was shocked and I\ncouldn't understand it, since it was such a nice gesture on my\npart. But I didn't give up and I called an \"educational bridger\" of\nAmharic, and she explained to me that most of the Ethiopian\nparents do not know how to read or write. I was even more\nsurprised, and I didn't know what to do, and the educational\nbridger said that she would help me and would write the blessing\nin Amharic and would also find out which of the parents do\nknow how to read. In the end of the day, we found a father who\nsaid the blessing in Amharic. In that moment, I looked at the\nEthiopian parents and saw pride and happiness on their faces;\ntheir faces glowed with joy. Even though afterwards no one told\nme how important it was to them to hear their language and to\nrelate to their culture. In those moments, I felt great happiness\novercome me and felt that I had done something holy and very\nimportant.\nRina, like the other teachers presented previously, also feels\ndisappointed and frustrated when perceived good intentions\ncannot be actualized. However, unlike the two previous types\ndiscussed above, she does not remain paralyzed by bad feel-\nings. She takes action, utilizing the resources available to her\nby turning to the appropriate person for advice, and thus cre-\nates an opportunity to resolve the misunderstanding.\nThe integrationist approach fosters a process of cultural\nunderstanding and cooperation which mutually benefits both\nthe parents and the teachers themselves. While the teacher\nbegins her account with feelings of frustration and shock, she\nprides herself on overcoming challenges and making a con-\ntribution to the community. Such a contribution is so fulfill-\ning to her that she is able to cope without the explicit gratitude\nof the parents and enjoys a sense of pride.\nTeachers who embrace such an approach not only learn to\ncope with challenges as they arise, but grow professionally\nfrom these experiences. Esther describes such an encounter:\nI write messages to the parents via the children, to provide\nchallenges for the children. I noticed that whenever I gave such\na note to a particular Ethiopian boy, who was very bright, that he\nwould throw the note on the floor or in the trash bin on his way\nout of the classroom. I was shocked the first time it happened. I\ncouldn't understand why he would do such a thing, and since he\navoided my question, I came to the conclusion that the boy has\na behavioral problem. I called the educational bridger who\nspeaks Amharic, to speak to his parents and clarify the issue.\nOne day, during a conversation with the boy, I asked him again\nabout the note. I was amazed by his answer; it was like rain on a\nsummer day for me; I did not expect such a reaction from the\nchild. When he spoke he had anger in his voice: \"They don't\nread anyway!\" I saw the frustration and disappointment on his\nface, and since then, whenever I send a note home, I read it\naloud. I tell the children that they are grown up and that they also\nneed to know what is written in the message. I succeeded in that\nthe boy no longer throws the notes away, and he has become\nresponsible in telling his parents the message. (uses Hebrew\nproverb: \"I have learned more than all my teachers before me.\")\nThe teacher combines empathy and creativity to generate an\napproach which reflects her educational awareness and sen-\nsitivity toward cultural differences, and which allows her to\nfulfill her desire to include Ethiopian children and their par-\nents in the educational process.\nFirstater et al. 7\nTeachers thus have the ability to connect to their own\nemotions and use them as tools to learn and grow, creating a\nnorm of cultural sensitivity in the classroom. When this pro-\ncess occurs, it is empowering; problems can be overcome,\nand the benefits are manifold.\nThe kindergarten teachers who participated in our study\nprovided an insider perspective on the challenges and\nrewards of working with Ethiopian children, while focusing\non the difficulties in relating to their families. Despite differ-\nent attitudes ranging from patronizing to missionary, and\nfinally an openness to discovering methods of cultural inte-\ngration, the educators were all united by their impassioned\nreactions and emotional involvement.\nDiscussion\nIn our era of ever increasing globalization, educators are\ncoping with the needs, challenges, and benefits of immigrant\nstudents from diverse cultural backgrounds (Su\u00e1rez-Orozco\n& Qin-Hilliard, 2004). The educator\u00adparent relationship is\none of the keys to successful integration of both the pupils\nand their family units within the educational setting.\nThe goal of the study at hand was to describe and analyze\nthe accounts of the kindergarten teachers who participated in\nour study, depicting their challenges in working with\nEthiopian children. It should be noted that the majority of the\nstories dealt with the characteristically frustrating nature of\nthe teachers' relationships with the children's parents.\nThe narratives that were described and analyzed focus\nprimarily on common day-to-day issues of the kindergarten,\nsuch as referral for remedial intervention and coping with\ntardiness. However, the kindergarten teachers often associate\nthese issues with the specific Ethiopian cultural origin of the\nfamilies. It may be that to some extent, the cognitive force of\nprejudice plays a role in the tendency to assign negative sig-\nnificance to anything that appears to deviate from the\nexpected norm. In this particular case, not only are the chil-\ndren from an immigrant background, but they also represent\nthe only Jewish sub-community that is racially and culturally\nAfrican. However, it should be noted that educator\u00adfamily\nrelationships in general are often fraught with conflict\n(Lahman & Park, 2004), and the challenges described by\nIsraeli kindergarten teachers are perhaps not unique to or\nspecifically related to Ethiopian culture.\nThe quantity and intensity of emotion expressed in\nresponse to coping with immigrant-parental challenges is\none of the main findings of the study. This element appears\nto connect the diverse patterns of behavior and expressions\nof the kindergarten teachers: Their strong emotional reac-\ntions ranged from feeling a need to distance themselves from\nthe pupils, personal insult, anger, frustration, embarrassment,\nhelplessness, and guilt to feelings of professional satisfac-\ntion, pride, and intense empathy. The intensity of the teach-\ners' feelings may be proportional to the severity of the\nproblems as they perceive them. Moreover, the intensity of\nsuch emotion offers the teachers an opportunity to confront\nthe experience of coping with otherness and the potential\nthreat of the other (Zembylas, 2010). It may be that the\n\"other\" symbolizes the need for uncomfortable, uneasy\nchange and for reevaluating the way that one has become\naccustomed to being in the world.\nFoucault (1994) uses the term \"ethics of discomfort\" to\nexplain the potential empowerment that a state of emo-\ntional discomfort can ultimately induce. The ethics of dis-\ncomfort can and should be used as a tool among educators\nto enable them to view negative feelings toward immi-\ngrant children, such as the Ethiopian children and their\nfamilies, not as a destructive, malevolent force, but rather\nas problematic emotions to be approached and faced with-\nout self-judgment.\nThe ethics of discomfort thus offers an opportunity for\nteachers to explore their assumptions about themselves to\nposition themselves as witnesses to social injustice and not\nmerely as observers and to be able to see their situation from\ndifferent perspectives (Zembylas, 2010).\nFurthermore, we find in our study that it is often the\nintense emotional involvement of the teachers which empow-\ners them to undergo a process of positive change. Once our\nparticipants are able to connect to their own emotional expe-\nriences and feel empathy, they succeed in developing suc-\ncessful and creative solutions that bridge cultural gaps and\ngive them a sense of great pride and satisfaction.\nRecommendations for Teacher Education and\nDevelopment\nBased on the findings of our study, teacher education should\nbe at the forefront of our efforts to improve the integration of\nimmigrant children and their families within educational and\ncultural frameworks. It is early childhood educators who\nmost often serve as the initial, formal face of the receiving\nsociety, and thus teachers have a particularly strong influ-\nence on the formation of the attitudes of the child and his\nfamily toward schooling, learning, and society.\nTeachers' emotions should be emphasized as the fulcrum\nfor changing attitudes, relations, and behaviors toward immi-\ngrant children. Such an approach should take priority over\nknowledge-based cultural diversity programs because it is\nempathy development which will serve as a chief force to\nconnect families to the educational setting and to prevent\nmarginalization. Thus, teachers should be exposed to the\nconcept of the ethics of discomfort as a means of initiating\nreflection and personal transformation.\nFurthermore, it is critical to enrich the understanding of\nearly childhood educators with regard to the processes of dis-\ncrimination and prejudice. Most significantly, it is important to\nmake them aware that such feelings are part of human nature\nand should be evaluated holistically for both their potential\ndangers and their potential benefits in triggering positive\nchange. This positive potential can be achieved not by\n8 SAGE Open\nsuppressing any such negative emotion, but rather by being in\ncontinual inner dialogue with these uncomfortable feelings.\nThe application of the aforementioned suggestions will\nprovide teachers with the tools necessary to improve the rela-\ntionship between the teachers and the parents of Ethiopian\nstudents, establishing a new foundation upon which to ame-\nliorate the learning experience of the children from the very\nbeginning of their education in the Israeli school system.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAngen, M.
