    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis study attempts to assess and compare the residential and non-residential schoolchildren in information-processing\nskills and creative thinking abilities. A sample of 80 children from Classes 5 and 7 were selected from two types of schools,\nresidential/ashram (02) and non-residential/formal schools (02) in Bolpur subdivision of West Bengal in India where the\nmedium of instruction is Bengali language/mother-tongue. All the children were individually administered the PASS (Planning,\nAttention, Simultaneous, Successive), Stroop, Matching Familiar Figure Test (MFFT-20), and creative thinking tasks. The\nresidential school children were found to perform better both in information processing and creative thinking tasks. The\ndevelopmental trend could not be clearly observed due to small sample size, but with increasing age, children were using\nbetter processing strategies. Due to ashram environment, creative pedagogy, and various co-curricular activities, the\nresidential school children were found to be more creative than their formal school counterparts. Moreover, some significant\npositive correlations were found among information processing skills and creative thinking dimensions.\n",

Their famous stage\ntheory model identified three types of memory based on its\nprocessing stages that is, sensory memory, short-term/work-\ning memory, and long-term memory. The \"Levels of\nProcessing\" theory developed by Craik and Lockhart (1972)\ndisagreed with the three-stage serial processing model of\nAtkinson and Shiffrin and stated that any information from\nthe environment is being processed at multiple levels simul-\ntaneously depending on its characteristics, attention, and\nmeaningfulness. New information need not have to go\nthrough a specific order of processing nor any prescribed\nchannel. However, the more deeply the information is being\nprocessed/learned, the more it would be retained in our\nmemory system (Kearsley, 2001). Similarly, the more con-\nnections, elaborations being made to any single idea, stimuli,\nor concept, the more likely it would be remembered better\n(Huitt, 2003). The advocates of \"Dual-Coding Theory\"\n(Clark & Paivio, 1991) suggested for two processing modes\nsuch as verbal and non-verbal processings; for example,\nmental images and verbal entities, chunks or prepositions are\nbeing processed by different systems. Furthermore, there are\nthree separate types of processing and interaction between\nthese two systems such as representational, referential, and\nassociative processing. The \"Schema theory of Information\nProcessing and Memory\" developed by Rumelhart (1980)\nproposes that information is stored in multiple locations\nthroughout the brain in the form of networks of connections;\nthus, units of memory are connections rather than any con-\ncrete representation of previous information. The develop-\nmental perspective of information processing as proposed by\nFlavell, Miller, and Miller (2002) emphasizes that increased\n1Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, India\nCorresponding Author:\nAtasi Mohanty, Assistant Professor, Centre for Educational Technology,\nIndian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, Kharagpur, West Bengal\nEmail: atasim@cet.iitkgp.ernet.in\nInformation Processing and Creative\nThinking Abilities of Residential and\nNon-Residential School Children:\nA Pilot Study\nAtasi Mohanty1\n Keywords\ninformation processing, creative thinking, residential, non-residential, schoolchildren\n2 SAGE Open\nprocessing capacity, speed, and efficiency takes place as a\nresult of biological maturation, knowledge development,\nmodifications of connections in neural networks, repeated\nself-organization, and meta-cognition. As the child becomes\nmore competent in structuring and organizing information\nand uses his experience more often, he will be using the\nmetacognitive strategies more spontaneously and frequently\nIntelligence\" based on information-processing approach\nsuggests that intelligence is comprised of three kinds of\ninformation processing components: meta-components, per-\nformance components, and knowledge acquisition compo-\nnents; all these work together to facilitate learning and\ncognitive development. Developmental changes take place\nas a result of feedback, self-monitoring, social interaction,\nand automization. Later on, Sternberg has also added the\nconcepts of practical intelligence and creative intelligence in\nhis theory. Kogan (1983) in his model refers to information\nprocessing as individuals' variations in modes of perceiving,\nremembering, thinking, and so on, or as different ways of\napprehending, storing, transforming, and utilizing informa-\ntion. Das, Naglieri, and Kirby (1994) in their \"PASS Theory\"\n(Planning, Attention, Simultaneous, Successive) have ana-\nlyzed information processing as an act of cognitive pro-\ncesses, which indicate how the individual approaches a task\nor problem, the strategies, and plans he uses to reach a solu-\ntion. Much closer to their definition, Halpern (1996) articu-\nlated this concept as critical thinking and defined this as \"the\nuse of cognitive skills or strategies that increase the probabil-\nity of a desirable outcome\" (p. 5). Burden and Byrd (1994)\nclassified critical thinking as a higher-order cognitive activ-\nity that requires a set of cognitive skills such as reasoning,\nintellectual curiosity, sense of responsibility, perseverance,\nreflective thinking, and so on.\nThus, the above discussion on some of the core informa-\ntion processing research revealed that the human cognition/\nthinking is to be understood through an account of the repre-\nsentation of the information and of processes that manipulate\nthis information. So far as the hierarchies of cognitive pro-\ncesses and multi-dimensional functioning of human cogni-\ntion/intellect, Bloom, Englehart, Furst, Hill, and Krathwohl's\n\"Analysis of Intelligence,\" and Anderson and Krathwohl's\n(2000) \"Revised Bloom Taxonomy\" are considered to be\npath-breaking works in integrating all, from simple to higher-\norder thinking processes, for successful problem solving in\nthe field of education. Bloom etal. had proposed a six-level-\nbased \"Taxonomy of Educational objectives\" based on the\nlearning hierarchy, that is, knowledge, comprehension, appli-\ncation, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. Later on, other\nresearchers have modified and revised the model as knowl-\nedge, comprehension, application, analysis, evaluation, and\ncreativity, after proposing that evaluation is less difficult than\nsynthesis and both incorporate different types of processing\nwas a consensus among researchers that even though both\nsynthesis and evaluation are based on the ability to analyze,\ncompare, contrast the parts of the whole, and understand\ntheir interrelationships, the type of thinking/cognitive pro-\ncessing involved in synthesis is often called \"Creative think-\ning,\" and in evaluation, it is called \"Critical thinking.\"\nThus, creative thinking/creativity is considered to be the\nhighest level of cognitive process, which automatically\nincludes all other lower cognitive processes while enacting a\n\"divergent thinking\" is much closer to creativity, which\nincludes four basic components such as fluency, flexibility,\noriginality, and elaboration. Torrance (1965) defined creativ-\nity as the process of forming different ideas or hypothesis,\ntesting these hypotheses, evaluating its effectiveness, and\ncommunicating the outcomes and its utilities. Later on,\nTorrance, Orlow, and Safter (1990) identified a set of cre-\native attributes/thinking abilities such as fluency, flexibility,\noriginality, elaboration, abstractness of the title, resistance to\nclosure, emotional expressiveness, articulateness action,\nexpressiveness, synthesis, internal as well as unusual visual-\nization, braking the boundaries, humor, fantasy, richness,\ncolorfulness of imagery, and so on, for being truly creative or\nengaged in creative act. Gardner (1985) has interpreted cre-\nativity as a complex construct and most likely/commonly is\nbeing expressed through a broad range of intelligence,\nincluding linguistic, musical, mathematical, spatial, kines-\nthetic, interpersonal, and intrapersonal. Wright (1987)\nreported about some home environment factors such as\nrespect for the child, the stimulation of independence, and\nenriched learning environment encourage creativity among\nchildren. Weisberg (1999) proposed that creativity involves\nessentially ordinary cognitive processes yielding extraordi-\nnary products. He attempted to show that the insights depend\non subjects using conventional cognitive processes (such as\nanalogical transfer) applied to knowledge already stored in\nmemory. Longley, Zytkow, Simon, and Bradshow (1987)\nmade a similar claim about the ordinary nature of creative\nthinking. Cultural background was also found to have an\nimpact on creativity (Baker, Rudd, & Domeroy, 2000;\npointed out that besides personal attributes, some key educa-\ntional factors play key role in the development of creativity\namong students, that is, teacher's teaching style (exercise,\ntactical strategic training; Jausovoc, 1988), students' learn-\ning styles (Isaacs, 1987), critical thinking, knowledge moti-\nvation, and creative response style being transacted in the\neducational setting. Most importantly, students' intrinsic\nmotivation and motivation to excel in every field/work often\nlead to creative excellence (Sternberg & Luppart, 1991;\nHowever, the literature review on creativity research has\nprimarily categorized these into four parts, that is, four p's/\nfactors such as person, process, product, and press/place.\nEmpirical research have been done on each of these aspects,\nthus accumulating huge amount of work. The first category\nof \"person\" relates to the cognitive abilities, biological traits,\nand psycho-physical traits of creative people. The second\ncategory, \"process,\" refers to mental processes or stages of\ncreative thinking that backs up creative work. The third one,\n\"product,\" means creative output/product, which can be\nmeasured/evaluated through its novelty, originality, authen-\nticity, fluency, elaboration, effectiveness, and utility. The\nfourth category is \"press,\" which refers to the enriched envi-\nronment context, which boosts the creative thinking and\nactions among individuals (Beghetto, Kozbelt, & Runco,\nativity has been extensively and successfully researched at\nhigher level in case of talented adults and less explicitly in\ncase of children or common man. Thus, children can be\ngiven a secondary role at the periphery of creative expression\nknown as \"low range creativity\" or \"creative spontaneity\"\n(Feldman in Sawyer et\nacknowledged that there are different types of creative contri-\nbution. For example, Gardner (1994) has described different\ntypes of creative contributions individuals can make, such as\n(a) solving a well-defined problem, (b) devising and encom-\npassing theory, (c) creating a \"frozen work,\" (d) performing a\nritualized work, and (e) rendering a \"high-stake\" perfor-\nmance. Similarly, according to Taylor (1959), there were five\ntypologies for creativity, that is, expressive, productive,\ninventive, innovative, and emergentive. Expressive type is\nthe spontaneous creativity often seen among children through\ntheir play and drawings. Productive creativity is being dem-\nonstrated by scientists and artists. Inventive creativity may be\ndescribed as problem solving or updating the existing tech-\nnology. Innovative creativity manifests in reinventing an\nexisting system/organism/object through the utilization of\nconceptual skills. Emergentive creativity is the creation of\nentirely new paradigm/opening/discovery/hybrid product,\nand so on. Thus, from the above discussion, we can appar-\nently conclude that creativity would express itself in different\nforms depending on the right combination of particular set of\nabilities, skills, personality traits, and environment.\nMoreover, creativity being a cognitive act involves cer-\ntain processes to reach at the output/product. It is also evi-\ndent from the above literature that very few attempts have\nbeen made to relate these two significant cognitive compo-\nnents, that is, intelligence/information processing and cre-\nativity, and what sort of relationship they share with each\nother. The review of research findings on these two concepts\nreveals that the pattern of relationship between these two is\npositive but not linear in nature. That is, to be creative, a\nperson must possess certain minimum (optimum) level of\nintelligence (such as grasping power, analytical skills, or\nability for integrating various components etc.), but highly\nintelligent persons may not be equally creative. As we know,\ncreativity being a cognitive act also involves different ways\nof thinking, that is, flexibility, originality, openness, fluency,\nelaboration, and so on, through which new solutions to\nvarious problems are arrived at. But here, the question is how\nthe creative people process the information when they are\nengaged in a creative act. Do they process these in a different\nway or like any other normal/average individual? Is there\nany specialty about creative thinking or is it just as other cog-\nnitive processes such as memory, reasoning, problem solv-\ning, and so on. Out of various information processing models\nthat have emerged out of cognitive-processing approach to\nassess intelligence, the author found that only in Sternberg's\n(1999) model of \"Successful Intelligence\" the component of\ncreative intelligence has been incorporated. He and his asso-\nciates found that the best predictor of creative aspects of\nthinking seemed to be the efficiency with which an individ-\nual is able to transition between conventional and unconven-\ntional ways of thinking. The other information processing\nmodels such as Das et\nCammock's (1978) \"Reflection\u00adImpulsivity\" model, and\nGardner's (1993) `Multiple intelligences\" model describe\ndifferent modes of information processing such as different\nways of apprehending, storing, transforming, and utilizing\nthe information. At this point of discussion, it strikes to the\npresent researcher whether the creative individuals process\nthe information in a similar fashion as normal ones or in a\ndifferent mode. What is their specialty if it exists? This insti-\ngated the present author to take up this study.\nMoreover, there is a growing realization among the intel-\nlectual mass that creativity is no more a privilege for a hand-\nful of people/the chosen few, but it is the basic human\nendowment present among all, in different measures. Creative\npotentiality is often not recognized systematically and nur-\ntured properly. The failure generally begins in the school at an\nearly stage and continues throughout life. In this context,\nPiaget's and Vygotsky's theories have great relevance in\nunderstanding the children's (developmental) psychology,\nthat is, the process of learning to think and thinking to learn.\nand his theory encourages hands-on learning. Piaget believed\nthat through assimilation and accommodation processes, the\nindividuals try to adapt themselves in the new environment\nand maintain equilibrium/cognitive harmony. Whereas,\nhis or her knowledge by interacting with others in the soci-\nety. Thus, social interaction plays an important role in stu-\ndent learning, and his theory advocates for gradual changes\nin learning and development through increasing social con-\ntacts, language, and social interactions. His philosophy was\nwhat is learnt must be taught by the teachers, who should\nexplain, model and use guided practices in the classroom.\nAllowing the students to think aloud and work through their\nassigned tasks are effective instruction strategies at elementary\nimportant aim of education is not to train individuals who\n4 SAGE Open\nrepeat the previous generations, but to train inventors who\nare creative and possess the skill of producing new things\n(Anwar, Shamim-Ur-Rasool, & Haq, 2012). Edward and\nDavid (1982) have emphasized that both creative and critical\nthinking should be involved in the teaching\u00adlearning process\nand curricula, through the context, activities, and assessment\nin school subjects, especially math and science. Thus, it is\nbeing felt by the educationists that the creative ability should\nbe detected very early in life, so that it can be nurtured prop-\nerly to reach the culminating point. The National Policy on\nResearch and Training (NCERT; 1986, India), National\nCurriculum Framework (NCF; 2005), and several other com-\nmissions have all along advocated for the need to develop\nboth the creative and critical thinking among the schoolchil-\ndren through inducing spontaneity, curiosity, original think-\ning, independent analysis, courage to ask questions, scientific\ntemper, and so on. The child-centered approach as articulated\nby NPE (India) also emphasizes the development of creative\nthinking and problem-solving abilities to make the teaching\u00ad\nlearning process more successful and innovative in nature. It\nwould also enhance the skill of \"learning to learn\" among the\nchildren, and for this, it is very urgent to know how they pro-\ncess the information collected from the environment. Even\nthough numerous studies have been conducted on various\ndimensions of creative ability and cognitive-processing skills,\nrare attempts have been made to relate these two components\nin an educational set up, especially at the elementary educa-\ntion level. Nowadays, creativity is increasingly gaining\nimportance across the fields, from school education to profes-\nsional world and corporate sectors as well. Even though\nresearchers have found that creative thinking can contribute\nsignificantly to the acquisition of information and educational\nfindings on the relationship between creativity and intelli-\ngence/academic achievement are still inconclusive. This has\nprompted the researcher to explore the answers to these fol-\nlowing questions.\nResearch Questions\nResearch Question 1: Is there any difference among resi-\ndential/ashram and non-residential/formal schoolchildren\nin information processing and creative thinking skills?\nResearch Question 2: Would there be any developmental\ntrend among the schoolchildren?\nResearch Question 3: What would be the pattern of rela-\ntionship between information processing and creative\nthinking abilities?\nMethod\nSample\nA sample of 80 school-going children (sharing the similar\ndemographic characteristics), 40 each from Classes 5 and 7\nhave been selected from two types of schools, that is, residen-\ntial/ashram schools and non-residential/formal schools. The\ntwo schools, Pathabhavan and Siksha\u00adSatra of Visva\u00adBharati\nUniversity at Santiniketan in West Bengal, India were the two\nashram schools and the other two schools called Srinanda\nHigh School and Vivekanda Vidyapith under the West Bengal\nboard (WB) of secondary education were taken as the non-\nresidential/formal schools. All these schools were Bengali/\nmother-tongue medium schools located in the Bolpur subdi-\nvision of Birbhum district in West Bengal, India. The samples\nwere drawn from Classes 5 and 7 of these four schools\nthrough stratified-random (sampling) technique.\nTools/Tasks Used\nThe following tools such as Das, Naglieri, and Kirby's PASS\nprocessing tasks, Matching Familiar Figure Test (MFFT-20)\ntask, Stroop task, and Baquer Mehdi's creative thinking tasks\nwere used in this study.\na. Planned connection task: In this planning task, each\nsubject is required to connect all the numbers in the\nworksheet as quickly as possible. There are two condi-\ntions where in Condition 1, the subject has to connect\n1 to 2, 2 to 3, numbers only, and in Condition 2, he or\nshe has to connect both numbers and letters such as 1\nto A, A to 2, 2 to B, and B to 3 likewise.\nb. Visual search: This is also a planning task, where the\nsubject's task is to point out the object, number, or letter\nin the response-field background that matches the tar-\nget located in the centre box. Each item consists of two\nsearches presented in a single page. For each subtask\n(item page), the subject's score is the time taken by him\nor her. The items are of high and low density and auto\nand control search in nature. In auto-search items, the\ntarget figures are different from that of background fig-\nures, whereas in control search, both are of same class.\nc. Selective attention: This is an attention task of PASS\nmodel. There are two types of cards in this task, one\nfor name matching, and the other for picture matching.\nThe score would be given according to the subjects'\naccuracy in matching the picture and the name.\nd. Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices (RCPM):\nThis is a non-verbal reasoning task consisting of 36\nmatrices or designs, each having a part removed from\nit. The subject's task is to decide the missing part, and\ninsert it from six possible alternatives given there. As\nthe child is required to simultaneously evaluate and\nsearch all the alternatives to find out the correct one,\nDas etal. (1994) have used this test in their model\n(PASS) as a good measure of simultaneous process-\ning. The scores would be given to the correct respons-\nes made by the subjects.\ne. Figure copying: This has also been used as a measure of\nsimultaneous processing. The task requires the subject\nto copy 15 geometrical figures that are visible to him or\nher. Each drawing is scored as 0, 1, or 2 according to the\ndegree of accuracy of reproduction of figures.\nf. Digit Span: The test is similar to Wechsler Intelligence\nScale for Children\u00adRevised (WISC-R; Wechsler,\n1974) \"Digit Span Forward\" subtest that has been\nused here as a successive processing task. The subject\nis required to recall a series of digits, keeping the or-\nder/sequence of these digits intact. Each correct score\nwould be counted for the recall of correct digit with its\nrespective order/position of presentation.\ng. Serial recall: This is another successive processing\ntask used by Das etal. in the PASS model. Here, the\nsubject's task is to recall a series of words, with their\nrespective position/order intact.\nh. Matching Familiar Figure Test (MFFT-20 by Cairns\n& Cammock, 1978): This test measures the informa-\ntion processing style of the subjects such as reflective\nor impulsive processing style. The subject has to find\nout the exact figure (replica) of the target figure (given\non the top) out of six alternatives. The experimenter\nrecords latency to the first response, total number of\nerrors for each item, and the order in which these are\nmade. The subject could get maximum five chances to\nselect the correct answer. Number of errors and time\ntaken would be recorded by the experimenter.\ni. Stroop Colour\u00adWord Interference Task: This task has\nbeen used to measure the amount of cognitive interfer-\nence. The time taken by the subject to complete each\ntask and the number of errors committed by him or her\nwere recorded.\nj. Baquer Mehdi's (1973) Creative Thinking Test: In this\ntask, there are some incomplete figures, lines, and\nshapes, which one has to take as the base and then\ndraw a novel and interesting picture out of his imagi-\nnation and give an appropriate title to explain it.\nDesign\nThis is a quasi-experimental design having two independent\nvariables, such as types of school and grade/class, and again\nhaving two levels such as (a) ashram/residential and formal/\nnon-residential schools and (b) Classes 5 and 7. Thus, it is a\n2 \u00d7 2 factorial design study. In the present study, 10 assess-\nment tools/tasks were used, and in total, there were 31 depen-\ndent measures.\nProcedure\nAll the tools and tasks were individually administered on all\nthe subjects (N = 80) in the sample. The collected data were\nfurther analyzed through various statistical tests.\nData Analyses and Interpretation\nThe collected data were analyzed using descriptive statistical\ntechniques such as mean (X), standard deviation (), t tests,\nand Pearson Product Moment correlation (r). In the follow-\ning section, both the quantitative and qualitative interpreta-\ntions are given (see Tables 1 and 2).\nAs the findings reveal, the ashram school children per-\nformed better in various dimensions of creative thinking test,\nthat is, originality, elaboration, and flexibility. Ashram\nschoolchildren also outperformed their non-residential coun-\nterparts in almost all the information processing tasks. The\ndevelopmental trend could not be clearly observed in case of\ncreative ability, due to small sample size, but it appears that\nchildren are using better processing strategies with increas-\ning age. Due to small sample constraint, the t test could not\nbe done individually in case of all 31 dependent variables.\nThe total scores and grand means were taken to compare the\nashram and non-ashram schoolchildren on broad measures,\nthat is, total information processing and creative measures\n(see Tables 3 and 4).\nTable 3 shows the correlations among all the information\nprocessing and creative thinking measures (31) as found in\ncase of Grade 5 children. Besides the interrelationships within\nthe same group of measures such as information processing\nor creative thinking measures, some other significant positive\ncorrelations have been observed such as between selective\nattention and creativity\u00adelaboration measures (r = .313*),\nsimultaneous processing (RCPM) and creativity\u00adoriginality\ning (RCPM) and creativity\u00adflexibility measures (r = .323*).\nTable 4 presents the correlation (r) values as found in case of all\nthe Grade 8 children. Here, also besides the inter-correlations\namong various information processing measures and creative\nthinking measures separately, some of the significant positive\ncorrelations are observed between arousal/attention measure\nsimultaneous processing (RCPM) and creativity\u00adoriginality\nprocessing (RCPM) and creative-elaboration (r = .350* and\n.348*); simultaneous processing (RCPM) and creativity\u00ad\nprocessing (figure copying) and creativity\u00adoriginality mea-\n(Digit Span) with creativity\u00adelaboration measure (r = .317*);\nand successive processing (Serial recall) with creativity\u00ad\noriginality (r = .350*) measure; Another significant factor\nobserved here was that the planning measures were nega-\ntively correlated to creative ability measures. Thus, with\nregard to the relationship between information processing\nskills and creative abilities, the major findings are\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 a. The arousal/attention dimension of information\nprocessing is found to be significantly and positively\nrelated to originality and elaboration dimensions of\ncreative thinking,\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 b. The simultaneous processing ability is significantly\nand positively correlated to three dimensions such as\noriginality, elaboration, and flexibility of creative\nthinking, and\n6 SAGE Open\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 c. The successive processing ability, also is found to\nbe significantly and positively correlated to both the\noriginality and elaboration dimensions of creative\nability.\nHowever, one more significant result is that the planning\nskills are negatively related to all the three, that is, original-\nity, elaboration, and flexibility dimensions of creative ability\nDiscussion\nAs the findings show (both Tables 1 and 2), the ashram/resi-\ndential schoolchildren performed significantly better than\nthe formal/non-residential schoolchildren in all the informa-\ntion processing and creative thinking tasks. Due to small\nsample size in this pilot study, the researcher couldnot make\na comparison among various subgroups. Hence, the t test\nwas done to compare the main groups such as school types\nand class, where in each case, the N = 40. Even though there\nare 31 dependent variables in Table 1, the total scores and\ngrand means were taken for t test to compare the ashram\nand formal schoolchildren on total information processing\nand creative measures. However, from Table 1, it is very\nmuch evident that the ashram schoolchildren's (both Classes\n5 and 7) mean scores are higher in all the dimensions of infor-\nmation processing, that is, selective attention, simultaneous\nprocessing, successive processing, planning skills, as well as\nboth the verbal and non-verbal dimensions of creative think-\ning, that is originality, elaboration, and flexibility. This implies\nTable 1. Showing the Mean and Standard Deviation Values of Ashram and Non-Ashram Schoolchildren.\nSl. no. Variables\nNon-ashram school\nNon-ashram school\nAshram school\nAshram school\nNote. RCPM = Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices; MFFT = Matching Familiar Figure Test.\nthat the ashram schoolchildren are fully utilizing their infor-\nmation processing skills and creative thinking abilities. The\nresearcher also observed that even though both the Visva\u00ad\nBharati (VB) ashram schools and WB formal schools had\nadopted the CCE (Continuous and Comprehensive-\nEvaluation) patterns, the Tagore philosophy-based\nVB-ashram school environments were more enriched, stimu-\nlating, natural, and stress-free in comparison to formal\nschools located in a more crowded semi-urban area (in\nBolpur town). The teachers in both types of schools were\nwell trained and following the guidelines of CCE pattern.\nHowever, the infrastructure and curricula followed in\nVB-ashram schools were more enriched and innovative,\nwhich encouraged both the ashram schoolchildren and teach-\ners to engage themselves in various solo and group activities,\nwhich were often missing in WB formal schools. Moreover,\nthe VB-ashram schoolteachers were more motivated to\nengage the children in various curricular and extra-curricular\nactivities than their formal school counterparts, as they were\ntaking pride in being a part of VB-ashram culture. Most of\nthe teachers had themselves been the students of VB schools.\nThe researcher wants to point out here that the VB-ashram/\nresidential school environments (2 schools) are completely\ndifferent from any other residential school with respect to\nacademic, socio-cultural, philosophical, as well as physical\natmosphere. VB (residential) schools and ashram environ-\nment provide enough opportunity for freedom of thought,\nimagination, and creative expression. Probably, this has\nencouraged the spirit of creative thinking and problem-solv-\ning ability of ashram schoolchildren. Moreover, this finding\ncould be asserted from the fact that the ashram schools (VB)\nhave got an unique curriculum and method of teaching that\nincorporate various extra-curricular activities such as draw-\ning, painting, dance, music, one-act-play, recitation, poetic\nsessions, discussion on current social problems, horticulture,\nplantation, pottery making, weaving, cloth printing, making\ntoys, artistic pieces from papers and leaves, and so on. The\nchildren learn from naturalistic observation and by doing\nthemselves. The teachers emphasize on self-learning and for-\nmative and qualitative evaluation. The children attend\nweekly programs such as \"Kabi Sabha,\" \"Sahitya Charcha,\"\n\"Darshan Class,\" and so on, and their knowledge, skills, and\ncreative thoughts are being evaluated instantly when they are\nactually performing it. The whole school environment (cam-\npus,curriculum,andculture)hasbeenattunedtoRabindranath\nTagore's philosophy of naturalistic education. Thus, it is\nobserved that this \"ashramic\" education nourishes some\nbasic skills and competencies among its children that develop\nthe sensitivity in perceiving a problem, analyzing and defin-\ning it in details, eagerness to look for more information,\nsearching for alternative solutions and unusual ideas, seeking\nnew relationships among various components, using a reflec-\ntive strategy for self-evaluation before taking the final deci-\nsion, willingness to accept conflicting ideas, intuitive\nthinking, and so on. Possibly, these could be the reasons why\nashram schoolchildren invariably performed better in all the\ndependent measures (i.e., information-processing skills and\ncreative thinking abilities).\nAs far as the second research question is concerned, it is\nfound that even though some developmental trend had been\nfound in case of information-processing skills and creative\nabilities of ashram schoolchildren only, it could not be firmly\nestablished, due to small sample size. In this regard, few\nempirical studies showed that both extrinsic and intrinsic\nmotivation can co-exist in the classroom situations (Corpus\n& Wormington, 2011), which can drive forward the process\nof creativity (Amabile & Hennessey, 2009). Often, cultural\ndifferences might influence creativity (Erez & Nouri, 2010).\nA recent study has also supported the view that learning\nenvironment positively affect the thinking style of children\nand encourage them to generate more creative ideas and\nactivities (Alghafri & Ismail, 2014). In the present study, it is\nobserved that the formal schoolchildren were not exposed to\nany such stimulating/creative environment or such tasks.\nHowever, the present researcher feels that effective curricula\nand pedagogy, enriched and collaborative environment, flex-\nible, and open-ended learning can boost the thinking skills\namong children.\nWith regard to the third research question, the relationship\nbetween information processing and creative thinking abili-\nties, it is found that (see Tables 3 and 4, Figure 1) attention\nand successive processing skills correlate significantly and\nTable 2.

Thus, it implies that the effective use of atten-\ntion, successive, and simultaneous processing strategies help\nthe children in perceiving, analyzing, and synthesizing the\ninformation in a more creative manner that boost their original\nideas, innovative thoughts, and could bring better flexibility,\nvariety, elaboration, and clarity in creative thinking process.\nSo far as the relationship of creativity with other cognitive\nprocesses is concerned, a recent study by Anwar etal. (2012)\nrevealed that at school level, high achievers are not signifi-\ncantly different from low achievers in terms of creative\nthinking abilities. In this study, the creative abilities of sec-\nondary schoolchildren did not correlate with their achieve-\nment scores. Hence, the relationship between creativity and\nacademic intelligence has again become debatable. However,\nthese researchers found the gender and urban locations to be\nthe significant influencing factors in children's creative think-\ning abilities. Another study has also confirmed that school\ncontexts and classroom environment influence the creative\nabilities of children, and for understanding the pattern of rela-\ntionship between children's motivation and creative abilities,\nwe need to study different types of schools and its learning\nenvironment (Amin & Regander, 2011). From these findings,\nwe can assume that creative thinking is a significant compo-\nnent of (human) higher-order thinking process, and in case of\nchildren, it remains in a very primitive, fluid form; it requires\na combination of other ingredients such as right environment,\nskills, personality attributes, as well as nourishment/training\nfor getting manifested into a more crystallized form of cre-\native product/outcome. Hence, for drawing a conclusion,\nmore number of empirical research studies are required in\ncreativity training and applications field. The classroom\ninstructions designed to promote creative thinking can also\nincrease the probability of academic success among the low\nachievers. The current-age researchers have also advocated\nfor teaching the thinking skills to primary-level schoolchil-\ndren and that strategic teaching, critical, and creative thinking\nshould be well integrated in the school curriculum (Alghafri\n& Ismail, 2014). Here, Sternberg's theory of successful intel-\nligence can be taken as a reference point where it has been\nelaborately discussed how intelligence can be successfully\nutilized for creativity and every individual should strive to\nacquire/develop the creative intelligence.\nConclusion and Future Work\nThus, from this pilot study (with a small sample size), the\nresearcher could assume that the information-processing\nskills such as attention, successive and simultaneous pro-\ncessing are the pre-requisites for conceptualizing the original\nidea, elaborating it, using it more flexibly for different pur-\nposes, and working on the different dimensions of creative\nthinking, which resemble divergent thinking. However,\nwhen the individual would actually proceed toward creative\nact or manifestation of this creative thoughts/potentials, he\nhas to converge his ideas into one selected topic/plan/blue\nprint; thus, ultimately, both intelligence and creativity or\ndivergent and convergent thinking merge into one point, ven-\nturing toward creative product/innovative practices/creative\nintelligence, the ultimate goal of smart learning and higher\ncognition. Moreover, educational experts have also recom-\nmended for a holistic approach called \"manifold thinking,\"\nbased on the proper integration of creative, critical, reflec-\ntive, and caring thinking (Valtanen, Berki, Kampylis, &\nThedorakopoulou, 2008). The school education should be a\nplatform of know-what, know-how, and know-why to foster\nstudents' creative thinking in a constructive environment\n(with multi sensory and collaborative learning experiences).\nSo far as the validity of this research findings are con-\ncerned, the researcher wants to clarify its limitations due to\nwhich it cannot be generalized. It was just a small attempt to\nsatisfy the intellectual curiosity. Even though the topic is very\ninteresting, there is a dearth of empirical studies in this direction.\nFigure 1. Relationship between information processing and creative thinking.\nNote. PASS = Planning, Attention, Simultaneous, Successive.\nThe findings of the present study could not be generalized\nbecause of small sample size, and one single state (West\nBengal) from which the sample has been drawn. To get a bet-\nter picture of the pattern of relationship among various infor-\nmation processing and creative thinking abilities, more\nnumber of empirical works are needed. Similarly, more num-\nber of ashram/residential schools should be studied to find out\nthe right inputs for creative learning environments. Even\nthough our curricula advocates for encouraging critical and\ncreative thinking among children, in reality, whether our for-\nmal schools do seriously care about this or not, should also be\ninvestigated. However, till today, VB-ashram school has been\nthe ideal learning environment for creative thinking, but how\nthe other residential, that is, the mushrooming international\nschools are different from these should also be studied.\nImplications\nFrom the above discussion, it can be suggested that to stimu-\nlate the creative thinking and enhance the information-\nprocessing skills among our children, we need to introduce\ncertain reforms in our school education system, such as (a)\ncurriculum to be based on problem-solving approach, (b)\nemphasis to be given on using effective processing strategies\nduring learning, (c) to encourage self-learning and problem-\nbased learning, (d) creating avenues for innovative ideas and\noriginal contributions, (e) flexibility and openness in teach-\ning\u00adlearning process and pedagogy, (f) adopting brainstorm-\ning technique in the instructional process to encourage\ncreative thoughts, and (g) encouraging the use of metacogni-\ntive strategies for self-evaluation and knowledge construc-\ntion. Prominent researchers and educationists have already\nrecommended for creativity-fostering strategies at primary\neducation level, which are equally oriented toward condu-\ncive environment (CE), creative process (CP), and creative\nstudent (CS; Kampylis, Saariluoma, & Berki, 2011).\nAt the end of this discussion, researcher wants to con-\nclude that the educator must design the instruction, prepare\nspecific curriculum, and create a stimulating and flexible\nlearning environment, where children's thinking styles will\nbe promoted through better communication, interaction, col-\nlaboration, and hands-on activities, which would foster all\nkinds of cognitive-processing abilities.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAlghafri, A.
