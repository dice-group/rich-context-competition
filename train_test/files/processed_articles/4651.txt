Data collected from 39 teams find that team cognitive trust as\ntwo process variables involves a transformational leadership process in which cognitive trust in the team leader and cognitive\ntrust among team members mediate the impact of this leadership style on collective efficacy. Unlike previous studies, our\nresults show that leveraging cognitive trust in the team leader is necessary but not sufficient for better proximal collective\nefficacy, which in turn facilitates distal team performance. Although cognitive trust among team members was more closely\nrelated to proximal collective efficacy than cognitive trust in the team leader was, the factors that foster the development\nof cognitive trust among team members remain scantly explored in the transformational leadership literature and deserve\nmore attention in future research.\n",

Given the reports from management and\nscholars emphasizing the importance of teams for organiza-\ntional success (Cohen & Bailey, 1997), understanding the\nantecedents of team performance is critical for academic and\npractitioner communities.\nThe team leader plays a central role in determining group\nperformance. For example, the research commissioned by\nProject Management Institute (PMI) reported that the project\nleadership style is a key success factor to project team per-\nformance (Turner & M\u00fcller, 2005). Several taxonomies for\nclassifying leaders by style have been proposed in the litera-\nture. Among these, the transformational leadership style has\nbeen one of the most cited theories of leadership (Judge &\nBono, 2000). Transformational leadership is defined as the\none that creates valuable and positive changes in its follow-\ners. Dvir, Eden, Avolio, and Shamir (2002) showed that\ntransformational leadership is highly effective in terms of\nsubordinates' development and performance. Although\nresearch on transformational leadership has consistently\nnoted that there is an underlying process through which\ntransformational leaders exhibit their influences on their fol-\nlowers' development and ultimately facilitate team perfor-\nmance (e.g., Dvir et al., 2002; Walumbwa, Wang, Lawler, &\nlittle research has explored this topic especially in project\nteam settings.\nAmong the process variables associated with the transfor-\nmational leadership process, trust has been acknowledged as\none important factor that can mediate the effect of the trans-\nformational leadership on group outcomes (Braun, Peus,\nNewman, Miao, & Hooke, 2013). Another group process\nvariable that may emerge in the transformational leadership\nprocess is collective efficacy (Zhang, Tsui, & Wang, 2011).\nPrior studies have found the effects of transformational lead-\nership on collective efficacy (e.g., Arnold, Barling, &\nteam performance (e.g., Jung & Avolio, 2000; Walumbwa\net al., 2004). However, the relationship between these factors\n1National Central University, Jhongli, Taiwan\n2Ming Chi University of Technology, New Taipei City, Taiwan\nCorresponding Author:\nHuey-Wen Chou, National Central University, 300 Jhongda road, Jhongli\nTransformational Leadership and Team\nPerformance: The Mediating Roles of\nCognitive Trust and Collective Efficacy\nHuey-Wen Chou1, Yu-Hsun Lin2, Hsiu-Hua Chang1\nand Wen-Wei Chuang1\n Keywords\ntransformational leadership style, cognitive trust, collective efficacy, team performance\n2 SAGE Open\nhas not been fully scrutinized, especially in a project team\ncontext. The present study therefore proposes a research\nframework with the aim of investigating the tangled relation-\nships between transformational leadership, collective effi-\ncacy, team cognitive trust, and team performance in project\nteam settings.\nTeam Performance in a\nTransformational Leadership Process\nTeam performance refers to the extent to which a team\nmeets established objectives for quality, cost, and time\n(Hoegl & Gemuenden, 2001). The conceptualization of\nteam performance as a multidimensional construct is\nacknowledged in the literature (Burke, Sims, Lazzara, &\nidentified three dimensions of team performance: quantity,\nquality, and satisfaction. They found that transformational\nleadership affects team performance through value congru-\nence and trust. Burke et al. (2007) suggested that team per-\nformance is the distal outcome variable of trust in leadership.\nUnder transformational leadership, team's cognitive trust\nand collective efficacy may evolve during the team devel-\nopment and serve as process variables that explain the dis-\ntal team performance.\nCognitive trust refers to individual beliefs about\npeer reliability and dependability (McAllister, 1995).\nKanawattanachai and Yoo (2007) indicated that cognitive\ntrust grounded in the beliefs regarding others' ability and\nreliability to accomplish a task (Kanawattanachai & Yoo,\nwith effective transformational leadership style was bene-\nficial to gain subordinates' trust. In teamwork settings,\nteam members collaborate and rely on other members'\ncompetency and professionalism to complete the assigned\ntask. Members of a team without building cognitive trust\namong team members are not willing to put more efforts to\ncoordinate their actions for performing the given task.\nAkg\u00fcn, Keskin, Byrne, and Imamoglu (2007) demon-\nstrated a strong beneficial effect of interpersonal trust on\nsoftware project teams' collective efficacy.\nCollective efficacy is defined as \"a group's shared belief\nin its conjoint capabilities to organize and execute courses of\naction required to produce given levels of attainment\"\ncollective efficacy was related to the performance of a work\ngroup in the transformational leadership process. Walumbwa\net al. (2004) demonstrated that collective efficacy emerges\nfrom the team development and mediates the impact of trans-\nformational leadership on work outcomes.\nCollective efficacy involves individuals' perceptions\nregarding the group's performance capability (Kozub &\nMcDonnell, 2000). When individuals hold strong collective\nefficacy, they are likely to devote more effort to achieving\ngoals (Bandura, 1986). Studies have indicated that collective\nefficacy has a positive impact on team performance (Gully,\nBeaubien, Incalcaterra, & Joshi, 2002) and that it relates to\ngroup performance in different contexts, including education\norganizations (Gibson, 2003). Based on the results of previ-\nous studies, we propose the following hypothesis.\nHypothesis 1: A team's collective efficacy has a positive\nimpact on team performance.\nStudying the trust within a group has attracted many\nresearchers' attention (Dirks & Skarlicki, 2004; Simons &\ndescribed trust as the belief and the willingness to depend on\nanother party. When team members perceive a high level of\ntrust in their interactions, they tend to devote more effort to\ncooperative behaviors (Kramer, Brewer, & Hanna, 1996).\nTrust is therefore an important variable in explaining why\nteam members are willing to complete their jobs jointly in a\nteam project setting.\nTrust in a team may include different dimensions, such as\ntrust in the team leader and trust among members. Previous\nresearch has mainly focused on trust in the team leader; nev-\nertheless, the impact of trust among team members on distal\noutcomes has not gained much attention. Dirks and Skarlicki\n(2004) suggested that focusing solely on a team's trust in a\nsupervisor may ignore other important referents. Therefore,\nexploring the impact of team cognitive trust, such as cogni-\ntive trust among team members, is a must for researchers to\nobtain a more complete understanding of the team-based\nworking relationships. This study conceptualizes team cog-\nnitive trust as having two dimensions: cognitive trust in the\nteam leader and cognitive trust among team members.\nTrust in a leader was frequently found to mediate the\nleadership-outcome relationship in studies of leadership\nprocesses (e.g., Dirks & Ferrin, 2002; Dirks & Skarlicki,\nertheless, different referents of trust may have different con-\nsequences in the leadership process (Dirks & Ferrin, 2002).\nDirks and Skarlicki (2004) suggested that a team leader not\nonly takes action to build the team's trust in the team leader\nbut also fosters the development of trust among team mem-\nbers necessary to perform a given task effectively.\nResearch on project management found that trust is\nlikely to be an antecedent of collective efficacy. Akg\u00fcn et\nal. (2007) found that strong interpersonal trust enhanced\nsoftware project teams' collective efficacy. They suggested\nthat mutual trust among team members will facilitate team\nmembers to collaborate more effectively. If a team builds\nstronger cognitive trust among team members, members\nof the team are willing to put more efforts to work together\nand become more confident in the group's ability to\nsuccessfully complete a task. Thus, higher cognitive trust\namong team members would help enhance team's collec-\ntive efficacy.\nChou et al. 3\nCognitive trust in the team leader, however, is members'\nconfidence in the team leader. Its influence on collective effi-\ncacy is proposed to be weaker than cognitive trust among\nteam members is. This study therefore hypothesizes that the\neffect of cognitive trust among team members on collective\nefficacy is stronger than the effect of cognitive trust in the\nteam leader on collective efficacy.\nHypothesis 2: Cognitive trust among team members has a\nstronger positive effect on collective efficacy than cog-\nnitive trust in the team leader does.\nLeadership is \"the process of influencing individuals or\ngroups so as to achieve group goals\" (Hoyt & Blascovich,\nbe positively associated with trust in the team leader, collec-\ntive efficacy (e.g., Hoyt & Blascovich, 2003), and team per-\nformance (e.g., Hoyt & Blascovich, 2003; Jung & Avolio,\nexert influence on subordinates by broadening and elevating\nfollowers' goals and providing them with the confidence to\ngo beyond specified, minimally acceptable expectations. The\nliterature (e.g., Avolio & Bass, 1995; Podsakoff, MacKenzie,\nMoorman, & Fetter, 1990) has confirmed that trust in the\nleader is a consequence of transformational leadership\nbecause transformational leaders empower and encourage\nfollowers to make decisions, thus gaining their followers'\ntrust. Jung and Avolio (2000) confirmed that trust in the team\nleader helps to explain the impact of transformational leader-\nship on performance. The mediating role of trust in the team\nleader on the relationship between transformational leader-\nship and performance was also confirmed in Hoyt and\nBlascovich's (2003) study of virtual and physical working\nenvironments.\nWhat is the relationship between a transformational lead-\nership and cognitive trust among team members? Few stud-\nies have addressed this question. Shamir, House, and Arthur\n(1993) suggested that transformational leaders build follow-\ners' personal and social identification and enhance members'\nfeelings of cohesiveness. Sosik, Avolio, and Kahai (1997)\nfound that transformational leadership positively affects the\nlevel of creative output generated by team members. This\nimplies that transformational leaders can facilitate interde-\npendent work among group members and encourage mem-\nbers to work together, help team members establish a sense\nof cognitive trust, and foster positive feelings among them-\nselves. In other words, transformational leadership may\ndirectly influence trust among team members. In this regard,\ntransformational leadership may exert a different effect on\ntrust in the team leader as it does on trust among team mem-\nbers. Therefore, this study proposes the following hypothesis\nto investigate whether a transformational leadership style's\nimpact on cognitive trust in the team leader is different from\nits impact on cognitive trust among team members.\nHypothesis 3: A transformational leadership style has a\ndifferent effect on cognitive trust in the team leader as\nits effect on cognitive trust among team members.\nCollective efficacy is team members'shared belief regard-\ning the team's ability to accomplish a given task, which may\nresult from the building of cognitive trust within a team.\nResearchers have indicated that a transformational leader\nthrough displaying idealized influence, intellectual stimula-\ntion, inspirational motivation, and individualized consider-\nation could facilitate team members' trust in the leader (e.g.,\nJung & Avolio, 2000) and mutual trust among team members\n(e.g., Zhu et al., 2013). In the team process, transformational\nleadership is beneficial to the establishment of team cogni-\ntive trust (Zhu et al., 2013). When a team leader displays a\ntransformational leader style, team members will perceive a\nhigh level of team cognitive trust and therefore will be more\nlikely to perceive to others' ability and reliability to perform\nAccordingly, team cognitive trust is likely to be related to a\nteam's collective efficacy in the transformational leadership\nprocess.\nAs discussed earlier, transformational leadership would help\nto foster team cognitive trust, which in turn would positively\nleverage collective efficacy. Team cognitive trust therefore may\nplay a mediating role in the relation between transformational\nleadership and collective efficacy. Nevertheless, relatively little\nempirical research appeared to have investigated the mediat-\ning role of team cognitive trust in the transformational lead-\nership-collective efficacy relationship. Given that team\ncognitive trust is likely to be the (or a) consequence of trans-\nformational leadership and the antecedent of collective effi-\ncacy, this study argues that the impact of transformational\nleadership on collective efficacy is likely to come from its\nmediating effect via team cognitive trust.\nBased on the arguments and evidences above, this study\ntherefore proposes that team cognitive trust mediates the\ntransformational leadership-collective efficacy relationship\n(cf., Figure 1).\nHypothesis 4: A transformational leadership will have an\nindirect positive effect, mediated through cognitive\ntrust in the team leader on collective efficacy.\nHypothesis 5: A transformational leadership will have an\nindirect positive effect, mediated through cognitive\ntrust among team members on collective efficacy.\nMethod\nThe aim of this study was to empirically examine the pro-\nposed model with collective efficacy and team cognitive\ntrust as the mediators of the transformational leadership-team\nperformance relationship. The research questions to be\naddressed in this study include the following: (a) how do\n4 SAGE Open\ntransformational leadership and team cognitive trust influ-\nence collective efficacy, which in turn affects team perfor-\nmance; and (b) is team performance affected by a series of\nmediating processes? A survey was conducted to empirically\nexamine the proposed model. The original instrument\nadopted in this study is the English version, and therefore a\npanel of experts including authors was responsible for trans-\nlating the instrument into Chinese. First, one author trans-\nlated the original instrument into Chinese. Therefore, another\nauthor screened and corrected the error of the translation.\nFinally, the first author administered a panel meeting to\nrefine the translation. To validate the Chinese version instru-\nment, several master students in the management college of\nuniversity in northern Taiwan were invited to participate in a\npilot test. According to the feedback from the participants\nand the result of the pilot test, the Chinese version instrument\nwas refined again.\nSample and Data Collection\nThe sample consisted of various team types from different\norganizations in Taiwan. Multiple members from each team\nwere invited to answer the questionnaires. Kumar, Stern, and\nAnderson (1993) indicated that data collected from a single\ninformant were highly correlated with team consensual data.\nHowever, one may raise some concerns about the reliability\nand validity of informant report as we asked only one mem-\nber of a team to answer the questionnaire. To ensure that the\nresponses were representative of that team, two members of\neach team were randomly picked to answer the question-\nnaire. The calculation of interrater reliability (R\nwg\n; James,\nDemaree, & Wolf, 1984) was used to determine whether the\ntwo team members' responses were correlated.\nteams in organizations in Taiwan, and 98 questionnaires\nwere returned. Of these, 92 questionnaires from 46 teams\nwere valid, yielding a response rate of 28.75%. The number\nof people per team ranged from 3 to 35 with an average of\nmonths, with a range of 4 to 120 months. Team types included\nIS (information systems) integration (12), quality improve-\nment (11), R&D (7), business management (5), customer ser-\nvice (3), production (1), sales (1), and others (6).Atotal of 27\nteams (58.7%) were temporary in nature.\nMeasures\nThe instruments used to measure research variables are\ndescribed below.\nTransformational leadership style.Twenty-four items adapted\nfrom Cheung, Ng, Lam, and Yue (2001) were used to mea-\nsure four aspects of transformational leadership of the proj-\nect team leader. Each aspect of transformational leadership\nincluding charisma, inspirational motivation, intellectual\nstimulation, and individualized consideration was measured\nby six items, respectively. The items wordings were refined\nto adapt to the team's context. Respondents were asked to\njudge each statement in terms of their team leader's overall\nleadership behavior based on their experiences in that spe-\ncific team. They were to evaluate how frequently, on aver-\nage, their team leader displayed the described behaviors on a\n5-point response scale (from 1 = never to 5 = always). A\nsample item for charisma was, \"The project team leader\nmakes the team members enthusiastic about the project.\" A\nsample item for individualized consideration was, \"The proj-\nect team leader finds out what I want and helps me to get it.\"\nA sample item for intellectual stimulation was, \"The project\nteam leader enables me to think about old problems in new\nways.\" A sample item for inspirational motivation was, \"The\nproject team leader stimulates enthusiasm among project\nteam members for the work of group.\" Cronbach's alpha\ncoefficient was = .975, which exceeds the recommended\nTeam cognitive trust.\nThe measures were adapted from\nKanawattanachai and Yoo (2002). Scale items were revised\nto measure two types of team cognitive trust: cognitive trust\namong team members and cognitive trust in the team leader.\nFour items measuring each type of trust were used using a\n5-point Likert-type scale (from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 =\nstrongly agree). A sample item for cognitive trust in the team\nleader is, \"I see no reason to doubt my team leader's compe-\ntence and preparation for the job.\" A sample item for cogni-\ntive trust among team members is, \"I see no reason to doubt\nmy teammates' competence and preparation for the job.\"\nCronbach's alpha coefficients for cognitive trust in the team\nleader and for trust among team members were = .848 and\nTeam inception\nTrust in the\nteam leader\nperformance\nCollective\nefficacy\nTrust among\nteam members\nTransformational\nleadership style\nTeam distal outcome\nTeam development\nFigure 1.

Wordings were\nadapted to adjust to the project team context. Five items were\nmeasured on a 5-point Likert-type scale (from 1 = strongly\ndisagree to 5 = strongly agree). A sample item was, \"My\nproject team can find solutions to problems with its perfor-\nmance.\" Cronbach's alpha coefficient was = .868, which\nexceeded the recommended level of .7 (Nunnally, 1978).\nTeam performance. This research adapts six items of Hoegl\nand Gemuenden's (2001) measure to assess team perfor-\nmance. Efficiency refers to the adherence to schedules and\nbudgets. Effectiveness refers to the degree to which the team\nmeets expectations regarding the quality of the outcome. In\nother words, effectiveness reflects the assessment of out-\ncomes, while efficiency is the assessment of input. Each\nquestion was measured on a 5-point Likert-type scale (from\n1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree). A sample item of\neffectiveness was, \"From the company's perspective, all\nproject goals were achieved.\" A sample item of efficiency\nwas, \"From the company's perspective, one could be satis-\nfied with how the project progressed.\" The value of Cron-\nbach's alpha was = .939, which exceeded the threshold of .7\nResults\nModel testing and data analysis were tested using the partial\nleast squares (PLS) approach. The PLS approach is suitable\nfor research with a small sample size (Chin, Marcolin, &\ntion, the sample size requirement for the PLS approach\nshould equal to or above 10 times the largest numbers of\nstructural paths directed toward a particular construct. As\ndepicted in Figure 1, the largest numbers of structural paths\nare two paths directed to collective efficacy, which indicated\nthat the requirement for sample size in our proposed model\nshould be equal to or above 20 teams. The sample size of this\nstudy is 46 samples and therefore satisfies the requirement.\nThis study calculates interrater reliability (R\nwg\n; James\net al., 1984) to investigate within-group agreement on the\nrating for each team. Out of the 46 teams' interrater reliabil-\nity coefficients for constructs, 7 did not exceed the threshold\nlevels of reliability (.7) as suggested by George (1990) and\nwere dropped from subsequent analysis.

Cronbach's alpha and composite\nreliability were used to examine reliability. As shown in pre-\nvious paragraphs, all of the Cronbach's alphas were well\nabove .7, the threshold suggested by Nunnally (1978), indi-\ncating the scale reliability of all major variables reached an\nacceptable level. As shown in Table 1, the composite reli-\nability coefficients were all above .6, as suggested by Fornell\nand Larcker (1981). Convergent validity was assessed by\nexamining the average variance extracted (AVE) from the\nmeasures (Hair, Black, Babin, Anderson, & Tatham, 2006).\nTable 1 shows that the values of AVE were all above the\nthreshold of .5 (Fornell & Larcker, 1981). Discriminant\nvalidity was confirmed by looking at the square root of AVE.\nThe values of the square root of AVE (depicted in Table 1)\nwere all larger than the interconstruct correlations (Fornell &\nLarcker, 1981). The variance inflation factor (VIF) that\nmeasures whether the collinearity existed was assessed.\nThe values of VIF for all constructs are smaller than the\nthreshold value of 10 (Hair et al., 2006). The result indicated\nthat the collinearity effect in the constructs studied was not\nsignificant.\nTable 1.

Therefore, Hypothesis 2\nwas supported.\nHypothesis 3 tested whether the impact of a transforma-\ntional leadership style on cognitive trust in the team leader is\ngreater than its impact on cognitive trust among team mem-\nbers. The path coefficient of transformational leadership\nstyle to cognitive trust in the team leader was positively\nthan the path coefficient of transformational leadership to\nThus, Hypothesis 3 was supported.\nHypothesis 4 and Hypothesis 5 examined whether team\ncognitive trust mediates the transformational leadership-\ncollective efficacy relationship. The Sobel test (1982) was\nused to examine the mediation effect of team cognitive trust.\nTwo independent PLS models exemplified by the SmartPLS\n2.0 bootstrap procedure with 200 re-samples were conducted\nto generate the necessary t values. Model 1 included two\npaths from transformational leadership (the independent\nvariable) to cognitive trust in the team leader and cognitive\ntrust among team members (two mediators). Model 2\nincluded two paths from cognitive trust in the team leader\nand cognitive trust among team members (two mediators) to\ncollective efficacy (the dependent variable). As depicted in\nTable 2, the showed t values and the corresponding z values\nfor the Sobel test were all significant. The results indicated\nthat cognitive trust in the team leader mediated the impact of\ntransformational leadership on collective efficacy (z value\nfor the Sobel test = 4.837, p < .01) and the effect of transfor-\nmational leadership on collective efficacy was also signifi-\ncantly mediated by cognitive trust among team members (z\nand Hypothesis 5 were supported.\nDiscussion\nIn attempting to understand the roles of cognitive trust and\ncollective efficacy in the transformational leadership-team\nperformance relationship, this study proposed five hypothe-\nses with aims to examine how transformational leadership\nand cognitive trust affect collective efficacy, which therefore\ninfluences team performance. The result of the study sup-\nported all five hypotheses confirming the intertwined rela-\ntionships between transformational leadership style, team\ncognitive trust, collective efficacy, and team performance.\nThe significant impact of collective efficacy on team per-\nformance (Hypothesis 1) was consistent with prior research\nof collective efficacy by way of the impact of two types of\nteam cognitive trust was confirmed (Hypothesis 2).

Therefore, cognitive trust\namong team members is also a necessary element of team\ntrust in exploring the formation of collective efficacy. The\nconfirmation of Hypothesis 3 revealed that transformational\nleadership had a greater association with cognitive trust in\nthe team leader than with cognitive trust among team members.\nCognitive trust in the team leader and cognitive trust among\nteam members significantly mediated the transformational\nleadership-collective efficacy relationship (Hypotheses 4 and\n5). Transformational leadership style affected collective effi-\ncacy by way of cognitive trust in the team leader and cogni-\ntive trust among team members. That is, through team\ncognitive trust, transformational leadership will help foster a\nteam's collective efficacy and leads to the distal outcome:\nteam performance. In other words, the impact path from\ntransformational leadership to team performance is by way\nof team cognitive trust and collective efficacy. Cognitive\ntrust in the team leader and cognitive trust among team mem-\nbers extend the influence of a transformational leadership\nstyle to collective efficacy and then ultimately to the proxi-\nmal outcome, team performance.\nIn summary, the confirmations of five hypotheses pro-\nvided a satisfactory answer to the research question: team\nperformance was affected by a series of mediating process\nwherein transformational leadership through cognitive trust\ninfluenced collective efficacy (the proximal outcome) and\nultimately led to team performance (the distal outcome).\nConclusion\nAccumulated literatures have evidenced the causal linkage\nbetween transformational leadership and team cognitive trust\n(e.g., Zhu et al., 2013). The inquiry regarding how transfor-\nmational leadership and team cognitive trust affect collective\nefficacy and therefore affects team performance has not been\nwell understood in previous research. The present study pro-\nvided the initial step to explore how team cognitive trust\nmediates the impact of transformational leadership on col-\nlective efficacy. We empirically assessed the antecedents\n(transformational leadership) and consequences (collective\nefficacy) of team cognitive trust. The transformational lead-\nership directly helped foster members' cognitive trust in the\nteam leader and cognitive trust among team member. As\nteam cognitive trust in the leadership process increased, the\ncollective efficacy of a team was enhanced accordingly,\nwhich in turn helped to lead to better team performance.\nAcademic Implications\nOur research contributes the following to academic research.\nFirst, this study conceptualized team cognitive trust as a\ntwo-dimensional construct: cognitive trust in the team leader\nand cognitive trust among team members. Such a conceptu-\nalization of team cognitive trust not only broadens the\nboundary of team trust beyond trust \"in the leader\" but also\nclosely reflects the real cognitive aspects of a team. We sug-\ngest that team cognitive trust may simultaneously emerge in\nthe interaction among team members and leaders as well\nas during the teamwork process. In summary, this study\nhelps to describe the two referents of cognitive trust as two\nseparate process variables in the transformation leadership\nprocesses.\nSecond, we characterized team cognitive trust using two\nreferents, cognitive trust in the leader and cognitive trust\namong team members. The findings confirmed that two dis-\ntinct constructs of team cognitive trust can be empirically\nclassified, and the development of collective efficacy is\nlargely dependent on cognitive trust among team members.\nSuch a classification is beneficial for comparing which type\nof team cognitive trust contributes more to collective\nefficacy.\nFinally, the study incorporated the model of collective\nefficacy from social cognitive theory into the framework of\ntrust in leadership theory. We theorized and validated the\ncausal relationships between transformational leadership,\ncognitive trust, collective efficacy, and the team's perfor-\nmance as a chain. Consistent with Burke et al.'s (2007)\nframework, our findings empirically confirmed that team\ncognitive trust under the transformational leadership process\nwas related to proximal outcomes (collective efficacy) and\ndistal outcomes (team performance). In conclusion, the find-\nings offer theoretical and empirical valuable insights into\nhow transformational leadership impacts team performance\nthrough various mediating variables.\nManagerial Implications\nOur study provides some managerial implications for team\npractices. This study confirmed the two elements of team\ncognitive trust, which is cognitive trust in the team leader\nand cognitive trust among team members. Specifically, cog-\nnitive trust in team leader and cognitive trust among team\nmember mediated the impact of transformational leadership\non collective efficacy which, in turn, led to better team per-\nformance. Therefore, effectively developing team cognitive\ntrust including cognitive trust in the team leaders and cogni-\ntive trust among team member is a critical issue in the team\ncontext. Team leaders or managers should work on being\nactive transformational leaders to help foster team mem-\nbers' cognitive trust in the team leader and cognitive trust\namong team members, which in turn will facilitate the\ndevelopment of collective efficacy and ultimately enhance\nteam performance.\nLimitations and Future Research\nThe target scope of the study primarily focused on how cog-\nnitive trust and collective efficacy intervene in the transfor-\nmational leadership-team performance relationship at team\n8 SAGE Open\nlevel. The result of the study provided empirical support for\nour proposed model and further confirmed the important role\nof team cognitive trust in the transformational leadership\nprocess. Nevertheless, data analysis solely targeted at team\nlevel and some other process variables naturally associated\nwith the transformational leadership were not incorporated\ninto the proposed model. Some limitations remain, and future\nimplications are described as follows.\nFirst, to gain a clearer understanding of the evolution of\nteam trust in the leadership process, a complementary longi-\ntudinal research design is suggested. Recent studies on group\nresearch have highlighted the development of cognitive trust\nand affective trust in the team process (Webber, 2008; Zhu\nthe development of affective and cognitive trust in student\nproject teams revealed that affective trust emerges early in\nthe early stage of team development, whereas cognitive trust\ndoes not. Conversely, Kim, Ferrin, Cooper, and Dirks (2004)\nsuggested that the early development of trust is likely to be\ndetermined by its cognitive dimensions, such as group mem-\nbership and reputation. Obviously, what types of trust\nemerges in the early stage of team development still remains\nblurred. Therefore, future research should examine the\ndevelopment of affective and cognitive trust in the team\nleader and among team members longitudinally to clarify\ntheir relationship in the team development process.\nSecond, the effects of selected control variables such as\nphysical versus virtual teams, team size, and task type should\nbe studied in future research. The low response rate of\nstudy limited this possibility. A larger sample size should be\nincluded in the future research to capture the effects of team\nsize and task type.\nThird, self-reported team performance may bias the\nresults. Future research may avoid this by collecting multiple\nmeasures of team performance, such as supervisor's evalua-\ntions of team performance or a team's key performance indi-\ncator (KPI). In addition, the finding of the study described a\nsample from project teams. The generalizability to different\ncontexts, such as an educational context or a sporting con-\ntext, should be assumed with caution in future research.\nFourth, this study only focused on how transformational\nleadership is associated with selected group variables,\nincluding cognitive trust and collective efficacy. There\nremain many other group variables, such as identification\n(Wang & Howell, 2012) and cohesion (Nielsen & Daniels,\n2012), that could bond team members together, in achieving\ngroup outcomes. Further research may explore the roles of\nthese factors in the transformational leadership processes.\nFinally, multilevel investigations of the transformational\nleadership into the team development process and follower\noutcomes have received many attentions recently (e.g.,\nlevel investigation of the transformational leadership in\nrelation to trust, efficacy, identification, and cohesion may\nprovide our richer understandings of how team performance\nand follower outcomes could be achieved by series of medi-\nating process.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAkg\u00fcn, A.
