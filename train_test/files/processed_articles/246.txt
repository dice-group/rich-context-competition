Design and Methods: Pharmacy records\nand self-reported medications were obtained for 294\nmembers of a state pharmaceutical assistance pro-\ngram who also participated in ACTIVE, a clinical trial\non cognitive training in nondemented elderly per-\nsons. The average age of the sample participants was\nmales. Results: Congruence between self-report\nand pharmacy data was generally high. Self-reports\nomitted drug classes in the pharmacy records less\noften than the pharmacy records did not include self-\nreported drug classes. The percentage of individuals\nwith perfect agreement between self-reports and\npharmacy records varied from 49% for major drug\nclasses to 81% for specific cardiovascular and central\nnervous system drugs. Within a drug class, agree-\nment tended to be higher for individuals without\na prescription in that class. Poorer health was\nconsistently related to poorer self-report of medica-\ntions. Implications: Self-reported medications are\nmost likely to be congruent with pharmacy records\nfor drugs prescribed for more serious conditions, for\nmore specific classes of drugs, and for healthier\nindividuals.\nKey Words: Brown bag method, Drug use in elderly\npersons, Medication adherence or compliance\nKnowing the number and types of medications\nthat an individual takes can provide information\nabout the individual's mental and physical health\nstatus and comorbidities (Clark, Von Korff,\nSaunders, Baluch, & Simon, 1995) as well as indicate\npossible cognitive impairment caused by medication\nside effects (Gillin & Byerly, 1990). Obtaining\nsuch information is especially important in studies\nof older adults, because of their greater use of\nmedications and greater likelihood of being treated\nfor multiple conditions. Medication data are often\ncollected in research studies by use of a self-report\nmethod known as the ``brown bag'' method (e.g.,\nJobe et al., 2001). With the brown bag method,\nparticipants are asked to collect containers of their\ncurrent medications in a brown paper bag and\nprovide them to research staff. Staff then record the\nprescription and nonprescription items. Alternatively,\nself-reports of medications have been collected\nby means of a written list, a verbal report, or a\nmedication form (e.g., Gerbert, Stone, Stulbarg,\nRegardless of how they are obtained, the utility of\nself-reports of current medications depends on the\nwillingness and ability of the individual to volunteer\nsuch information. A few studies have explored the\nvalidity of patient reports of current medications.\nGurwich (1983) found that self-reported medication\nhistories were more complete than the physician's\nmedical chart. In a sample of older adults, Opdycke,\nAscione, Shimp, Boyd, and Malloch (1994) found an\naverage of 81% agreement for medication name\nbetween self-reported medication histories and the\nprescriptions listed in the patients' medical records.\nIn contrast, Gerbert and colleagues (1988) concluded\nthat patient reports of medication regimens were\nFunding for the ACTIVE study was provided by the National\nInstitute on Aging and the National Institute of Nursing Research (Grant\nAG14263).

Self-reports tend to be better for medica-\ntions taken on a long-term basis or for serious health\nconditions (Hulka, Kupper, Cassel, Efird, & Bur-\ndette, 1975; Kelly, Rosenberg, Kaufman, & Shapiro,\n1990) and for individuals who were younger and had\nbetter functional status (Landry et al., 1988). Hulka,\nCassel, Kupper, and Burdette (1976) also found that\ngreater scheduling complexity was related to a\ngreater number of omissions by physicians of medi-\ncations in the self-reports.\nThe comparison of self-reported medications with\nmore ``objective'' measures warrants the consider-\nation of several methodological issues. Computer-\nized pharmacy records only provide information\nabout which prescriptions have been filled, not\nwhich medications are actually being taken (Choo\ndosing schedules can also make it difficult to\ndetermine the correct days' supply of a prescription\n(Christensen et al., 1997). Finally, many previous\nstudies on the congruence of ``self'' and ``other''\nreports of medications have either used a sample in\nwhich most or all participants were prescribed at\nleast one medication or have focused on a limited set\nof condition-specific medications (e.g., Choo et al.,\nrural elderly persons (Helling et al., 1987) found that\n29% reported taking no prescription drugs, whereas\nother individuals were reported up to 13 prescribed\nmedications. Clearly, the statistical methods used in\nprior studies to assess congruence have to be adapted\nto accommodate both older adults taking no\nmedications and those taking a wide variety of\nmedications. Moreover, when a broader range of\nmedications is included, decisions must be made\nabout which classes of drugs should be examined in\ngreater depth and about the level of therapeutic\nclassification that should be used.\nThe present study assessed the congruence be-\ntween the brown bag method of obtaining self-\nreported medication data and the prescriptions that\nhad been filled by a sample of older adults, according\nto computerized pharmacy records. Self-report\nmedication data were collected by use of the brown\nbag method as part of a multisite clinical trial on\ncognitive training, the Advanced Cognitive Training\nfor Independent and Vital Elderly (ACTIVE; Jobe\net al., 2001). Most participants at the Pennsylvania\nState University (PSU) site of ACTIVE were recruited\nfrom a state pharmaceutical assistance program, the\nPharmaceutical Assistance Contract for the Elderly\n(PACE). As a result, pharmacy claim data were\navailable for those ACTIVE participants at the PSU\nsite who were members of PACE. This allowed us to\ncompare the self-report medication data collected by\nmeans of the brown bag method with prescription\ndata in the PACE pharmacy records.\nThis study addressed four research questions in\na sample of low-income older adults who were\nprescribed a variety of medications. First, what\nproportion of a set of drug classes had congruent\ninformation in the self-reports and pharmacy re-\ncords? Second, are discrepancies more likely to be\nattributed to omissions by the self-reports or by the\npharmacy records? Third, what individual character-\nistics predict congruence (or discrepancies) between\nthe self-reported medications and the pharmacy\nrecords? Finally, does congruence between self-\nreports and the pharmacy data vary by drug class?\nThese four questions were examined for 10 major\ntherapeutic drug classes prescribed to this sample of\nolder adults as well as for specific drug classes within\n2 of these major drug classes (i.e., cardiovascular\ndrugs and central nervous system, or CNS, agents).\nCardiovascular drugs and CNS agents were exam-\nined in greater detail because they are frequently\nprescribed to elderly persons and because their\npossible cognitive side effects were of particular\ninterest in a clinical trial on cognitive training.\nMethods\nSample\nThe analysis sample for this study was 294\nmembers of PACE who completed the ACTIVE\ngroup baseline assessment; the included participants\nhad also been randomized to a treatment group in\neither the pilot study or the main study for ACTIVE.\nThe average age of the sample was 74.5 years (SD \u00bc\ndominantly White (96%) and had a mean income of\nWomen comprised the majority of the sample\ncurrently married. Eighteen participants in the\nanalysis sample (6%) were enrolled in an extension\nof the PACE benefits program that entailed a slightly\nhigher copayment and a $500 yearly deductible, for\nindividuals with slightly higher, but still low, in-\ncomes (less than $17,000 for single persons; less than\nMedication Data\nTwo types of medication data were obtained. Self-\nreported medication data were collected during the\ngroup baseline testing session for ACTIVE by use of\nthe brown bag method. Computerized pharmacy\nclaims for prescription fills and refills were obtained\nfrom PACE for participants for a window of time\nthat included the date of the brown bag data\ncollection. Each prescription medication in the PACE\ndata had a code to indicate its therapeutic purpose;\nthe American Hospital Formulary Service (AHFS)\ncodes were used. Each medication had three levels of\nAHFS codes, depending on the level of therapeutic\nspecificity. The first level of the AHFS code indicated\nthe major therapeutic drug class (e.g., cardiovascular\ndrugs), and lower levels indicated minor or more\nspecific therapeutic drug classifications (e.g., beta\nblockers). The brown bag medications were coded\nwith the same AHFS coding system. For both the\nPACE pharmacy data and the self-report data,\na participant was given a 0 or 1 for each AHFS\ndrug class to indicate whether the participant had at\nleast one medication in that class (i.e., score of 1) or\nno medication in that class (i.e., score of 0). Over-\nthe-counter items (e.g., Tylenol, Aleve, and Mylanta)\nwere excluded from the brown bag data. Medica-\ntions in the PACE pharmacy data whose supply was\nestimated to be depleted more than 5 days before the\nbrown bag assessment were also excluded. Sample\nmedications may have been included in the brown\nbag assessment, but they were not specifically\nrecorded as samples.\nSeven of the 17 major AHFS classes with at least\none prescribed medication were excluded from\nfurther analysis, because the class was prescribed to\nor self-reported by less than 5% of the sample. As\nshown in Table 1, the percentage of the sample with\nat least one medication in a given class was relatively\nlow for most of the 10 major therapeutic drug classes\nexamined. The three most prevalent major thera-\npeutic drug classes in both data sets were as follows:\n(a) cardiovascular drugs (PACE, 59%; self-report,\n67%), (b) hormones and synthetic substitutes (PACE,\n32%; self-report, 37%), and (c) CNS agents (PACE,\n28%; self-report, 34%); these classes have been\nfound to be among the most commonly prescribed\ndrugs for elderly persons in prior studies (Johnson &\ndata, the electrolytic, caloric, and water balance class\nwas reported as frequently as CNS agents.\nCardiovascular drugs and CNS agents were\nexamined in further detail in this study because of\ntheir possible side effects of cognitive impairment or\nconfusion, which was of particular interest because\nthe sample was participating in a study on cognitive\ntraining. The prevalence of the 7 specific classes of\ncardiovascular drugs and 3 specific classes of CNS\nagents included in this analysis are also presented in\nTable 1. The number of major drug classes present\nfor each individual (in the 10 classes studied) in each\ndatabase ranged from 0 to 7 (SD \u00bc 1.5 drug classes).\nFor the 10 major drug classes studied, the pharmacy\nrecords showed that 20% of the sample had no\ncurrent prescriptions at the time of the brown bag\ndata collection, whereas only 10% of the sample self-\nreported no current prescriptions.\nMeasures\nEveryday Problems Test.--The Everyday Prob-\nlems Test (EPT) assessed problem solving and\nreasoning in everyday situations encountered by\nolder adults. Participants were presented with 14\neveryday stimulus materials (e.g., medication labels,\ntransportation schedules, and a Medicare benefit\nchart) and used the information in the materials to\nsolve two problems per stimulus. The stimulus and\nproblems represented seven instrumental activities of\ndaily living (IADL) domains. The test was untimed.\nThe EPT has been shown in prior research to have\nhigh internal consistency, test\u00adretest reliability, and\nstructural stability (Willis & Marsiske, 1993). The\nscore was the number of correct answers (score\nMini-Mental State Examination.--Performance\non the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE;\nFolstein, Folstein, & McHugh, 1975) served as an\nindicator of general mental status. All ACTIVE\nparticipants scored greater than 22 on the MMSE as\na condition of their inclusion in the study. Thus, all\nparticipants had MMSE scores between 23 and 30.\nShort Form-36 General Health Score.--The\nShort Form-36 (SF-36) is a self-report instrument of\nhealth and the impact of health on functioning and\nTable 1.

The\ngeneral health subscale score tapped perceptions\nabout current health and health changes. General\nhealth scores ranged from 15 to 100 in this sample,\nparticipants did not complete this scale.\nVisual Acuity.--An in-person visual acuity test\nwas performed prior to baseline testing (Rubin &\nSalive, 1995). Participants who self-reported extreme\ndifficulty with reading ordinary newspaper print or\nwith a performance-tested vision score worse than\n20/50 were excluded from participation in ACTIVE.\nMeasures of Congruence\nSeveral measures of congruence between PACE\npharmacy records and the self-report data were\ncalculated in this study. Each measure addresses\na somewhat different question regarding congruence.\nThese measures are described in the paragraphs that\nfollow, and scores for three hypothetical cases are\npresented in Table 2. Two measures of congruence\n(agreement and omission\u00adcommission) provided in-\nformation at the level of the individual and thus\npermitted examination of predictors of congruence\nat the individual level. The remaining two measures\n(percent agreement and kappa coefficient) provided\ninformation about congruence at the aggregate level\nfor a given drug class.\nAgreement Score.--This score provided the pro-\nportion of information that was identical in the\nPACE pharmacy records and the self-report data\nagreement) to 1 (total agreement) and were calcu-\nlated with the following formula:\nAgreement score\n\u00bc \u00f0Number of agreements between PACE and brown\nbag data\u00de=Number of drug classes compared:\nBecause we were interested in the pattern of\ncongruence for either the absence or the presence of\nmedications within a defined set of drug classes, the\ndenominator in this equation (i.e., the number of\ndrug classes compared) was a constant value for all\nindividuals. This practice differed from previous\nstudies in which the denominator varied for each\nperson, depending on the total number of drug\nclasses reported in either data source. For example,\nfor all of the hypothetical cases shown in Table 2,\nour study used a denominator of 10 (i.e., the total\nnumber of drug classes compared), as opposed to\ndenominator values of 6, 5, and 0, respectively,\nwhich would have represented only the (different)\nnumber of drug classes present in the data for that\nperson. This practice also allowed agreement\nscores to be calculated for those with no current\nmedications (e.g., the third drug pattern shown in\nOne benefit of the agreement score is that the\nsame overall measure of the agreement could be used\nfor each person, despite differences in the medica-\ntions being taken by individuals. Another benefit is\nthat, unlike the percent agreement and the kappa\ncoefficient described in the paragraphs that follow,\nan agreement score was generated for each person\nrather than as a sample statistic. However, because\nthe agreement score does not define one data source\nas more accurate (i.e., a ``gold standard''), it does not\nindicate which source is the cause of any disagree-\nment between the two databases. Rather, the source\nof discrepancies is addressed with an analysis of\nomission and commission scores, described next.\nOmission and Commission Error Scores.--These\nscores provided information about the source of\nreporting errors that may be responsible for\ndisagreements between the self-reports and the\npharmacy records. Scores were calculated on a per\nperson basis, with values of 0 indicating no error,\nthat is, none of the drugs in one source were omitted\nby the other source, and a value of 1 representing\n100% error, that is, all of the drugs in one source\nwere omitted by the other source (Hulka et al., 1975,\nmatches\u00admismatches between the two data sources\nthat are considered in this method are described in\nTable 3. Because we were considering congruence in\na set of drug classes that were relevant to this\nTable 2. Three Sample Patterns of Reported Medications and Associated Agreement and Error Scores\nDrug Class Number Score\nNotes: In the analyses, N was coded as 0 and Y was coded as 1. PACE\u00bc the Pharmaceutical Assistance Contract for the Elderly.\nsample, individuals with no prescription drugs were\ngiven scores of 0 to avoid removing them from the\nanalysis (e.g., see the third drug pattern in Table 2).\nPercent Agreement.--We calculated an overall\npercent agreement as the percentage of the total\nsample whose self-report data were congruent with\nthe PACE data. For a particular drug class, this value\nincluded congruence either for the presence or the\nabsence of a prescription within that drug class. This\ntype of measure was used in a previous evaluation of\nself-reported medications with the PACE population\n(Landry et al., 1988). We also computed two\nadditional, more specific percent agreement values.\nFirst, for cases that had a prescription in a given drug\nclass in the PACE data, the proportion of individuals\nwho also reported that drug class in the brown bag\ndata was calculated as the ``percent agreement for\ncases with a prescription.'' Second, for cases that did\nnot have a prescription in a given drug class in the\nPACE data, the proportion of individuals who also\ndid not report that drug class in the brown bag data\nwas calculated as the ``percent agreement for cases\nwithout a prescription.''\nKappa Coefficient.--The kappa coefficient is\na measure of agreement between the classifications\nmade by two independent data sources and takes\ninto account the agreement expected by chance\nfrom 0 to 1; higher values indicate greater agreement.\nThe classifications examined from the two data\nsources were whether or not a drug class had been\nreported (yes or no) by that source for a particular\nindividual.\nResults\nFour main research questions were investigated in\nthis study. First, the proportion of a set of drug\nclasses that were congruent for each individual\nbetween the self-report data and the pharmacy\nrecords was examined; agreement scores were used\nfor this analysis. Second, the source of any discrep-\nancies between self-reports and pharmacy records\nwas investigated with an analysis of omission and\ncommission error scores. Third, predictors of the\nagreement and discrepancies between the self-report\ndata and the pharmacy data were considered.\nFinally, the congruence (using percent agreement\nand kappa) between the self-report data and the\npharmacy records was explored within each of 10\nmajor drug classes and additionally for 10 specific\ndrug classes (i.e., 7 specific cardiovascular drug\nclasses and 3 CNS drug classes).\nCongruence Between Self-Report Data and\nPharmacy Records: Across Drug Class\nIn this section, we examined the proportion of\na set of drug classes with congruent information\nbetween the two databases. We calculated three\nagreement scores for each individual, comparing the\nfollowing sets of drug classes separately: (a) 10 major\ndrug classes, (b) 7 specific cardiovascular drug\nclasses, and (c) 3 specific CNS drug classes.\nMajor Drug Classes.--An average of 91%\nagreement (i.e., 9 of 10 classes) between the self-\nreport and pharmacy records was found for the 10\nmajor drug classes included (SD \u00bc 11.3%). Almost\nagreement between their self-report data and the\npharmacy records. Although agreement scores\nranged from 50% to 100%, indicating that only half\nof the 10 classes were congruent for some individ-\nuals, 91.8% of the sample had congruent informa-\ntion for at least 8 of the 10 classes.\nSpecific Cardiovascular Drug Classes.--An aver-\nobserved for the 7 specific cardiovascular drug\nclasses (SD \u00bc 9.0%). Agreement scores ranged from\nperfect (100%) agreement between the two data-\nbases. Ninety-seven percent of the sample had\ncongruent information for 6 of the 7 specific cardio-\nvascular drug classes.\nSpecific CNS Drug Classes.--An average of\nTable 3.

The pharmacy\nrecords did not include an average of 24% of the\nmajor drug classes that were self-reported. The\naverage combined error rate was 28%, with the\nmajority of the discrepancies resulting when in-\nformation about current prescriptions taken from\nthe pharmacy records did not include drug classes\nthat the individual had self-reported. However, all\nclasses found in the pharmacy records were self-\nreported by 84% of the sample, and pharmacy\nrecords had information about all classes in the self-\nreport data for 58% of the sample.\nSpecific Cardiovascular Drug Classes.--The\naverage rate of omissions was 1% for self-reports\nof medications in the seven specific cardiovascular\ndrug classes; only 5 individuals did not report all\ncardiovascular drug classes present for them in the\npharmacy records. Although an average of 13% of\nself-reported specific cardiovascular drug classes was\nnot included in the pharmacy records, pharmacy\nrecords had information on all self-reported cardio-\nvascular drugs (i.e., 0% error rate) for 82% of the\nsample. The average combined error rate for\ncardiovascular drug classes was 13.5%, with most\ndiscrepancies occurring when the information drawn\nfrom the pharmacy records did not include a cardio-\nvascular drug class that had been self-reported.\nSpecific CNS Drug Classes.--Self-reports of\nmedications in three specific CNS drug classes\nomitted an average of 5% of the specific CNS drug\nclasses found in the pharmacy records, whereas\npharmacy records reported an average of 13% fewer\nCNS classes than the self-report data. However, the\npercentages of the sample with no errors of omission\n(94%) and with no errors of commission (87%) were\nquite high. The average combined error rate for CNS\ndrug classes was 17%, with the majority of the\ndiscrepancies occurring when the information drawn\nfrom the pharmacy records did not include a class\nthat had been self-reported.\nPredictors of Agreement\u00adDisagreement Between\nthe Self-Report and Pharmacy Data\nLinear regression analyses examined predictors of\nthree person-level outcomes: (a) agreement score\n(i.e., congruence between self-reports and pharmacy\ndata for a set of drug classes), (b) omission error\nscore (i.e., self-reports omitted a drug class included\nin the pharmacy records), and (c) commission error\nscore (i.e., pharmacy records omitted a drug class\nincluded in the self-reports). Analyses were per-\nformed for these outcome variables in three\ndomains: (a) 10 major drug classes, (b) 7 specific\ncardiovascular drug classes, and (c) 3 specific CNS\ndrug classes. Predictors included demographic vari-\nables (gender, marital status, age, and income) as\nwell as measures of cognitive and physical function-\ning. Cognitive variables included the EPT and the\nMMSE; physical functioning variables were the\nSF-36 General Health subscale and a vision score.\nResults of the regression analyses are presented in\nMajor Drug Classes.--For the 10 major drug\nclasses, marital status, income, and general health\nsignificantly predicted agreement between the two\nmedication databases. Participants who were mar-\nried, had lower income, and better general health\nwere more likely to have self-report data that agreed\nwith the pharmacy records. Marital status and\ngeneral health were also significant predictors of\nerrors of omission. Participants who were married\nand in better health were less likely to omit drug\nclasses included in the pharmacy records. Marital\nstatus was the only significant predictor of errors of\ncommission. Married participants were less likely to\nreport a drug class that was not included in the\npharmacy records.\nCardiovascular Drug Classes.--General health\nwas the only significant predictor of agreement (p ,\n.01) and errors of commission (p , .05) for the seven\nspecific cardiovascular classes. Individuals with\nbetter health had better agreement between their\nself-report data and the PACE pharmacy records for\ncardiovascular drug classes and were less likely to\nreport a drug class that was not found in the\npharmacy records. No significant predictors of errors\nof omission were found.\nCNS Drug Classes.--Gender (p , .05) and\ngeneral health (p , .01) were significant predictors\nof the amount of agreement for the three CNS drug\nclasses. Male participants and those in better health\nhad higher levels of agreement for CNS drugs. The\nEPT was the only significant predictor of errors of\nomission for CNS drug classes (p , .001). Individ-\nuals with better everyday problem-solving skills were\nless likely to omit CNS drug classes included in the\npharmacy records. General health was the only\nsignificant predictor of errors of commission for\nCNS drug classes (p , .05). Having poorer general\nhealth was related to a greater proportion of self-\nreported drug classes that were not being represented\nin information taken from the pharmacy records.\nCongruence Between Self-Report Data and\nPharmacy Records: Within Drug Class\nIn this section of results, we examined congruence\nseparately within (a) each of the 10 major drug\nclasses, (b) each of the 7 specific cardiovascular drug\nclasses, and (c) each of the 3 specific CNS drug\nclasses. Congruence (i.e., percent agreement) was\ninvestigated in three ways. First, what proportion of\nthe total sample has congruent information (i.e.,\nboth PACE and the self-report data were coded 0 or\nboth were coded 1)? Second, of cases with a pre-\nscription in a drug class in the pharmacy records\n(i.e., PACE \u00bc 1), what proportion also self-report\nthat drug class? Third, of cases without a prescription\nin a drug class in the pharmacy records (i.e., PACE \u00bc\n0), what proportion also did not self-report that drug\nclass? These results are presented in Table 5.\nMajor Drug Classes.--As shown in Table 5, the\noverall percent agreement (i.e., for the presence or\nabsence of a particular drug class) was high for all 10\nmajor therapeutic drug classes studied, ranging from\nfor a drug class was found in the pharmacy records,\nthe percent agreement was also relatively high (63.6\u00ad\ncases in which no prescriptions for a drug class were\nfound in the pharmacy records, the agreement\nbetween the self-report and pharmacy data was\nfor all 10 classes were significant at a 95% level of\nconfidence, indicating significantly more agreement\nbetween the two databases than would be expected\nby chance.\nCardiovascular Drug Classes.--Table 5 shows\nthat the overall percent agreement values for the\nseven specific cardiovascular classes were all high\nboth for cases with a medication in the specific class\nand for cases without a medication in that class in\nthe pharmacy records.

The kappa coefficients for all specific CNS\nclasses, except opiate agonists, showed significant\nagreement (p , .05) between the self-reported\nmedications and the pharmacy records.\nDiscussion\nThis study investigated the congruence between\nself-reports of medications obtained by use of the\nbrown bag method and information about current\nmedications taken from pharmacy records (i.e.,\nPACE data) for a sample of low-income, rural\nelderly persons. This sample was of particular\ninterest given their high rate of health problems,\nlimitations in access to health care, and often limited\neducation. The results indicated generally high levels\nof agreement across 10 major drug classes and across\nthe specific cardiovascular and CNS drug classes\nexamined. We also found that the brown bag data\nomitted drug classes found in the pharmacy records\nless often than the pharmacy records did not include\ninformation about drug classes that had been self-\nreported. However, it is important to note that the\npharmacy records included all self-reported major\ndrug classes for more than half the sample and\nincluded all self-reported cardiovascular and CNS\ndrugs for over 80% of the sample. An analysis of\npredictors of agreement and discrepancies between\nthe self-report and pharmacy data indicated that\ngeneral health status was an important factor to\nconsider. Better health was related to higher levels of\nagreement across the 10 major drug classes, across\nthe 7 specific cardiovascular drug classes, and across\nthe 3 specific CNS drug classes. Better health also\npredicted that fewer major drug classes would be\nomitted by the self-report data and that fewer\nspecific cardiovascular and CNS drug classes would\nbe self-reported that were not found in the pharmacy\nrecords.\nFinally, within each drug class, high congruence\nwas found for the total sample and for the subsample\nof individuals who did not have a prescription filled\nfor a particular drug class. For individuals with\na prescription medication in a drug class, very high\nagreement was found for reporting specific cardio-\nvascular drug classes, confirming previous research\nfindings that drugs for serious conditions are more\nlikely to be reported (Hulka et al., 1975; Kelly et al.,\n1990). Medications taken for less serious conditions\nor taken on an intermittent or short-term basis are\nTable 5.

In this\nstudy, the percent agreement for antihistamines,\nanti-infective agents, eye, ear, nose, and throat\npreparations, and opiate agonists was lower than\nthe percent agreement found within the other major\nand specific CNS drug classes for those who were\nprescribed a medication in one of those classes.\nThe congruence of pharmacy records and self-\nreported medication use is an important issue\nbecause self-reports of medications are frequently\nused as a proxy for health status or the presence of\nchronic diseases as well as to study topics such as\nmedication compliance, polypharmacy, and drug\ninteractions. Self-reports of medications are often\nused in population-based studies (e.g., the Iowa 65\u00fe\nRural Health Study), where pharmacy records are\nlacking or expensive to obtain. Although self-report\nmeasures are widely used, few studies have examined\nthe congruence of prescription records and self-\nreport measures, and the samples available for such\nstudies have often been limited and unique.\nOne typically validates self-report data by com-\nparing them to an objective, gold standard measure.\nHowever, to have a gold standard measure of cur-\nrent prescriptions, individuals would need to obtain\nall medications through a single source, and all\nmedications received (including samples) would have\nto be included in the database. In the current medical\nclimate, where individuals are likely to have multiple\nsources for prescription coverage and multiple\nphysicians, obtaining a gold standard measure of\nprescription medications is not likely. Thus, our\nanalysis has emphasized the comparison of two\nsources of information about current prescription\nmedications, rather than the absolute accuracy of\neither source. For example, although we utilized\na method termed ``error analysis'' to investigate\ndifferences between the two databases, we discussed\nthe ``errors'' as discrepancies or disagreements be-\ntween two potentially incomplete sources of in-\nformation about the same domain.\nWe believe the current study makes several\ncontributions to the prior literature with respect to\nthe measurement of the congruence of self-report\nand pharmacy records. First, congruence was exam-\nined both at the level of the individual and at the\naggregate level, across drug categories and within\nboth major and specific drug categories. Measure-\nment of congruence at the individual level led to\na second contribution of the study--the examination\nof person characteristics as predictors of congruence\nbetween self-reports and prescription records. In-\nformation on predictors could be useful in studies\nthat only use self-report measures by indicating\nsubsamples whose self-report might be expected to\ndiffer from pharmacy records. A final contribution\nof the study was the examination of congruence not\nonly for individuals in the sample who take\nmedications, but also for the significant proportion\nof community-dwelling, young-old elderly who take\nno medications. Although prior studies have often\nfocused on participants who take medications, it is\nwell known that, in community-dwelling popula-\ntions, a proportion of elderly persons take no\nmedications. In the current study, pharmacy records\nindicated that 20% of the sample had no current\nprescriptions, whereas the self-report data indicated\n10% with no current prescriptions. However,\na comprehensive study of congruence requires\nexamining congruence not only for participants\nwho take medications but also for those who do not.\nThis study had several limitations. First, the\nsample was relatively small and of low socioeco-\nnomic status and consisted of primarily women.\nSecond, all participants participated in a prescription\ncoverage program, which may increase the likeli-\nhood that medical conditions would be treated with\nprescription medications (Stuart & Grana, 1998).\nThird, congruence was examined at the level of the\ndrug class rather than at the level of the actual\nmedication. It is possible that some discrepancies\nwere not detected with our analysis. For example,\nmultiple medications within a drug class would have\nbeen coded as a ``yes'' for that class, although only\none of these medications may have been self-\nreported. Finally, using computerized pharmacy\nrecords as a proxy for current medications can be\nproblematic (Choo et al., 1999; Christensen et al.,\nSpecifically in this study, an individual's current\nmedications in the PACE pharmacy data were based\non the prescribed days' supply and the date of the\nprescription fill or refill. Individuals who did not use\ntheir medications as often as directed by their\nphysician may account for some of the discrepancies\nobserved between the self-report data and the\npharmacy records. For example, if elderly persons\ntake a lower dosage than prescribed and extend their\nsupply of the drug, medications might be included in\nthe brown bag beyond their prescribed dosing\nwindow. Such noncompliance may explain why\n10% of the sample had no current pharmacy records\nfor prescription refills but reported taking one or\nmore current medications. Days' supply can also be\ndifficult to determine for medications taken on an\n``as needed'' basis, such as opiate agonists. The use\nof a class-specific window may have improved\ncongruence for such classes. The elderly individuals\nmay also be obtaining medications that are not\nrecorded in the prescription records. A survey of\nPACE recipients found that approximately 29% have\nother prescription coverage (Pennsylvania Depart-\nment of Aging, 2002). In addition, health care\nprofessionals often provide patients, particularly\nlow-income patients, with medication samples,\nsuggesting that they try the medication before\na prescription is written. Or, the elderly persons\nmay use medications prescribed for friends or family\nmembers (Johnson & Moore, 1988). Medications\nnot obtained through PACE would not be recorded\nin the pharmacy claims data and could have falsely\ninflated the discrepancies between the PACE phar-\nmacy data and the self-reports.\nIn summary, the findings of this study have several\nimplications for the use of the brown bag method to\ncollect medication information. We believe the\nbrown bag method provides a reasonable substitute\nfor pharmacy records as a measure of current\nmedications. One must consider several factors,\nhowever, when using the brown bag method. First,\ncongruence of brown bag data and pharmacy\nrecords may vary by the type and prevalence of the\nmedication being considered. Medications for more\nserious conditions or that are taken on a long-term\nbasis are more likely to be reported than medications\ntaken on an as needed basis, for a short duration, or\nfor less serious conditions. Furthermore, medications\ntaken in forms other than by mouth (e.g., by\ntranscutaneous patch) may be less likely to be\nreported with the brown bag method. Second,\nwhether a general drug class (e.g., CNS agents),\na more specific drug class (e.g., opiate agonists), or\na set of drug classes is being considered may\ninfluence congruence. Although congruence was\ngenerally high, the best agreement tended to be\nfound within a specific drug class rather than within\na major drug class or for the overall pattern of all\ndrug classes for an individual. Third, the congruence\nof self-reports for prescribed medications was better\nfor more prevalent classes (e.g., cardiovascular\ndrugs). Finally, the investigation of predictors of\nagreement between the brown bag data and the\npharmacy data revealed that those individuals with\nworse health consistently had poorer congruence.\nFuture research on the congruence of brown bag\ndata with pharmacy records should include an\ninvestigation of reasons why drugs are omitted from\nboth self-reports and pharmacy records as well as an\nexamination of the congruence and stability of\nbrown bag data over time.\nReferences\nChoo, P.
