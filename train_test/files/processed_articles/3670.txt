    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe influence of parental attachment and love language on the resilience of graduating university students was studied in a\nPhilippine setting. Using the survey method (N = 843), it was found that a secure attachment and receiving love from parents\nresult in higher resilience. The parental love languages quality time, words of affirmation, and acts of service significantly\ncontributed to resilience. These are love languages that provide emotional, motivational, and practical resources that build\nresilience. While quality time contributed the most to resilience, a secure attachment is most especially required of fathers\nwhereas words of affirmation and physical touch are needed from mothers. Sons need quality time from their fathers and the\nphysical touch of their mothers. Daughters benefit from quality time with mothers alongside a secure attachment and words\nof affirmation from their fathers. This study emphasizes the parental factors of attachment and love as external resources\nof resilience. The research highlights the quality of parent\u00adchild relationship experience that would support the resilience of\nyoung adults. Results also point to the advantage of having loving parents and a secure parental attachment.\n",

The two critical\nconditions implicit in the quote are exposure to threat and\npositive outcome. Resilience is the \"process of, capacity for,\nor outcome of successful adaptation despite challenging or\nthreatening circumstances\" (Masten, Best, & Garmezy,\nobserved: (a) individuals who have experienced traumatic\nevents but have been able to recover well; (b) persons who\nbelong to high-risk groups, but who have more favorable\noutcomes than expected; and (c) persons who show positive\nadaptation despite life stressors (Masten etal., 1991).\nIn a paper presented by Gilligan (2003), he describes\nresilience not as a fixed trait but as a quality in children and\nyoung people having a good sense of belonging, and self-\nefficacy to confront adversities. These qualities would be\nbrought out in the context of committed and encouraging\nrelationships from others--parents, relatives, teachers, other\nadults, and peers. In this discourse, Gilligan explored the\nways in which adults and professionals can act to nurture\nresilience in young people. He contends the need to first,\nvalue the capacities of children and young people; second,\nrecognize the naturally occurring supports and resources\nfound in the children's everyday lives; and third, to consider\na strengths perspective in practice, policy, and research\nPositive parenting characterized by warmth, responsive-\nness, appropriate discipline, and secure attachment (Howell,\nprotective factors in children growing up at risk.

Apart from parental behavior, broader family\nfunctioning such as the children's perception of family\ncoherence and stability are associated with positive adapta-\ntion among maltreated children (Haskett, Near, Ward, &\nParental Attachment and Resilience\nBowlby (1979) conceptualized attachment as\nthe propensity of human beings to make strong affectional bonds\nto particular others and of explaining the many forms of\nemotional distress and personality disturbance, including\nanxiety, anger, depression, and emotional detachment, to which\nunwilling separation and loss give rise. (p. 127)\nThe behavior of attaining and maintaining proximity to an\nattachment figure, usually conceived as stronger and/or\nwiser, \"characterize human beings from cradle to the grave\"\nhood; however, it becomes apparent in adulthood when a\nperson is distressed, ill, or afraid.\nThe need to balance attachment and exploratory behav-\niors was emphasized in the writings of Bowlby (1979) and\nAinsworth and Bell (1970). There are genetic biases that bal-\nance this need to attach with the need to separate from moth-\ners. The latter would promote exploration and acquisition of\nknowledge, which will help species to adapt to their physical\nand social environment (Ainsworth & Bell, 1970). When\nchildren are provided with conditions of this balance, Bowlby\nasserted that they grow up secure and self-reliant and, in rela-\ntion to others, they tend to be more trusting, cooperative, and\nhelpful. Sensitive parenting is a key ingredient to developing\na secure internal working model. Pathogenic parenting is\ncommon in psychiatric referrals of anxious and insecure\nindividuals.\nThe influence of parental warmth and mental condition\non the outcome of adolescent and adult children has been\nexplored by some contemporary studies. McKinney and\nMilone (2012) found that parental psychopathology and\nparenting are related to late adolescent psychopathology.\nPerceived positive parenting increased the likelihood of late\nadolescent psychopathology in the context of high perceived\nparental psychopathology. The authors posit that children\ntend to identify more strongly with parents who provide\npositive parenting; hence, this higher level of identification\nand involvement may lead to a stronger transmission of\nparental psychopathology. In a study among Chinese ado-\nlescents for instance, pressure from parents to perform well\nin school may have negative effects on their psychological\nfunctioning. However, it was also found that greater paren-\ntal warmth generally reduced the association between the\nparents' academic pressure and the adolescents' symptoms\nof depression and anxiety (Quach, Epstein, Riley, Falconier,\n& Fang, 2015). Results of a qualitative meta-synthesis of\nstudies among adult children having parents with mental ill-\nness revealed that the central theme revolved around rela-\ntionship issues with reference to a lack of emotional affect,\ndistorted perceptions of others, hyper vigilance of others'\nemotional states, and mistrust of others (Murphy, Peters,\nJackson, & Wilkes, 2011). These findings may reinforce\nBowlby's attachment theory. However, the results of the\nmeta-synthesis also highlighted that experiences of parental\nmental illness have also generated creativity, resilience, and\npersonal growth, which questions the automatic correlation\nof parental mental illness and trauma.\nAtwool (2006) saw the significance of combining resil-\nience and attachment theories such that it signifies relation-\nships as key to all aspects of resilience--culture, community,\nrelationships, and individual factors. Both theories facilitate\nthe understanding of the adaptive nature of behavior and the\ntypes of relationship experiences necessary to promote posi-\ntive adaptation.\nParental relations have been studied to be important in\nencouraging resilience. In a study among youths ages 9 to\n15, it supported that parental responsiveness improved the\nprediction of the children's emotional resilience. Both\nmother and father parenting behaviors were seen as making\nunique contributions to the emotional functioning of children\n(Boughton & Lumley, 2011). A difference between mothers\nand fathers was also established in a longitudinal study con-\nsidering first-born children living in traditional mother-\nfather-child homes (Steele & Steele, 2005). The researchers'\ndata suggested that when understanding and resolving emo-\ntional conflicts within themselves, these children were highly\ninfluenced by their relationship with their mothers. However,\ntheir relationship with their fathers will more likely influence\ntheir understanding and resolution of emotional conflicts in\nthe outer world of human interaction--for example, with sib-\nlings and peers.\nThroughout adolescence, reliance on parents decreases,\nbut this does not necessarily mean that the attachment rela-\ntionship diminishes.Around this time, attachment may extend\nfrom parents to peers, with peers often becoming the pre-\nferred persons to spend time with and receive comfort from\n(Noller, Feeney, & Peterson, 2001). One view of this change\nof relationships is that peer groups and friendships provide\nimportant \"way stations\" during the separation process from\nparents (Goossens & Marcoen, 1999). However, parents still\nperform a critical function as secure base from which to\nexplore peer relationships and different roles and identities.\nThe secure base allows a child to explore this external world\nand return safely if the need arises (Noller etal., 2001).\nResilience and Love Language of\nParents\nSeveral studies demonstrate that the primary factor in resil-\nience is having caring and supportive relationships within\nMaximo and Carranza 3\nand outside the family. Relationships that create love and\ntrust provide role models, and offer encouragement and reas-\nsurance that help bolster a person's resilience. Other\nresearches take warmth and responsiveness to be a good\nindicator of love and have investigated the long-term effects\nof warm and responsive parenting on children (Maccoby,\nreviewed several works showing that warm and responsive\nparenting develops intrinsic resilient capacities and mediates\ncoping responses to many adversities including poverty, ill\nheath, substance abuse, youth crime, bereavement, or com-\nmunity violence.\nMany adolescents identify the value and importance of\nmaintaining positive, respectful, and loving relationships\nwith parents, a closeness that can override the effects of\npoor peer relationships (Noller & Patton, 1990). A sense of\nbelonging and connectedness to family, and feeling loved\nand respected in the family, is a protective factor for a num-\nber of risk behaviors, including suicidal behaviors, sub-\nstance abuse, and violence (Fuller, McGraw, & Goodyear,\n1999). Caring and connectedness surpass a range of demo-\ngraphic characteristics, such as single versus two parent\nfamilies, as protective factors against risky behaviors\nChapman and Campbell (1997) described love lan-\nguages into specific behavioral expressions, namely, physi-\ncal touch, quality time, gifts, acts of service, and words of\naffirmation. Children are behaviorally motivated and they\nrespond better when parents convey love concretely through\nthese actions. Chapman and Campbell (1997) said that\n\"every child has an emotional tank, a place of emotional\nstrength that can fuel him through the challenging days of\nchildhood and adolescence\" (p. 17). Parents must fill their\nchildren's emotional tanks with unconditional love for\nthem to operate as they should and reach their potential.\nThis research operationalized love based on Chapman and\nCampbell's concept of love languages.\nGender Differences: Resilience and\nParenting\nProtective factors may differ across gender. For instance,\ngirls tend to become resilient by building strong, caring rela-\ntionships, whereas boys are more likely to build resilience by\nlearning how to use active problem solving (Bernard, 1995).\nFurther evidence that resilience may yield gender differences\ncomes from the research of Werner and Smith (1992). In\ntheir longitudinal study of high-risk children, it was found\nthat scholastic competence at age 10 was more strongly asso-\nciated with successful transition to adult responsibilities for\nmen than women. However, factors such as high self-esteem,\nefficacy, and a sense of personal control were more predic-\ntive of successful adaptation among women than men. In the\nstress domain, males were more vulnerable to separation and\nloss of caregivers in the first decade of life, while girls are\nmore vulnerable to family discord and loss in the second\ndecade. Thus, the factors that influence resilience may differ\nin males and females.\nOverholt and Ewert (2015) found that males and\nfemales gained resilience by participating in the outdoor\nadventure program. Both and males and females cited\nstressful events, uncertainty, physical difficulty, and peer\nrelationships as contributors to resilience development.\nThese experiences were reported as contributing to self-\nconfidence and self-reliance. While women were espe-\ncially concerned with the physical challenges of the\nexpedition, men emphasized relational difficulties. Males\ndecreased in reported levels of resilience, whereas females\nexperienced increased levels. Many of the men entered\nthe program with a high level of confidence and later find-\ning humility as they learned to cope with the challenges.\nExpeditions are often framed in terms of their physical\nchallenges without much emphasis on the other challeng-\ning aspects such as interpersonal relationships. This dif-\nference in evaluation and expectation may be an artifact of\nthe ways in which individuals are socialized in terms of\ngender and gender identity.\nWith regard to parenting, Doucet (2009) argued that\ndespite ideologies and norms changing over time, beneath\nthe surfaces of everyday practices, there is still a constant\npull back to those primary assumptions about women as\nprimary carers and men as secondary caregivers. In her\nstudy on fathers, there is a strong sense that women feel\nguilty about leaving their child to go back to work and\nmen feel guilty about leaving their work to care for their\nchild. Mothers feel pulled toward care and connection\nwhile fathers feel pulled toward paid work and\nautonomy.\nHowever, using a maternal lens in understanding fathers\nmeans that paternal forms of nurturing are ignored or\nobscured. For example, with regard to the issue of emotional\nresponsibility, a maternal lens misses the ways in which\nfathers promote children's independence, playfulness, and\nphysicality, and these outdoors approach to the care of\nyoung children are viewed only as second best, or invisible,\nways of caring. One of Doucet's conclusions in parenting is\nthat, rather than using a maternal lens and comparing fathers\nwith mothers, what is required are novel ways of listening\nto, and theorizing about fathers' approaches to parental\nresponsibilities.\nSome previous studies exist exploring the differences in\npaternal and maternal influences on affective measures\n(Barton & Kirtley, 2012) and problem behaviors (Malmberg\n& Flouri, 2011) among sons and daughters as well as core\nbeliefs in young women (Blissett etal., 2006). In this study,\nwe would also present paternal and maternal influences on\nthe resilience of sons and daughters. Specifically, this study\ncould determine which attachment styles and love language\nof fathers and mothers are best predictive of the resilience of\ntheir sons and daughters.\n4 SAGE Open\nCultural Issues\nThe resilience among the Filipinos may relate to having a\nmore interdependent self-construal (Pe\u00f1a-Alampay, 2003).\nThe Filipino self is perceived as connected with others from\na deep sense of kapwa or referring to the oneness of the self\nwith others. In a study among Filipino adolescents, Rufino\nRamos (2007) found that the implicit meaning of happiness\nis consistent with a collectivist perspective. Happiness is\ncontextualized in meaningful interpersonal relationships\nwith emphasis on friendship and family support. Kapwa\nand the collectivist culture seep through many of the\nFilipinos' values and patterns of feelings, thoughts, and\nactions. The understanding of Filipino resilience may also\nthen be understood in line with interdependence, kapwa,\nand a collectivist mind-set.\nThis research was conducted among graduating students\nof a university in the northern part of the Philippines. This\nstudy first explored the general influence of parental attach-\nment and love language on the resilience of these students.\nThe specific paternal and maternal influences were also dealt\nwith. Differences between the parental influences on the\nresilience of sons and daughters were likewise specifically\ntackled. The researchers hypothesized that a secure attach-\nment would relate positively to resilience compared with\ninsecure attachment. Generally, the love languages were\nhypothesized to relate positively to resilience as well. This\nstudy also explored which of these combined parental factors\nwould best predict the resilience of the students as a whole\nand also that of the high stress group.\nMethod\nResearch Design\nThe descriptive method was used as this research aims to\nprovide information about how resilience varies in relation\nto parent\u00adchild attachment and parental love languages. The\nsurvey is the main tool employed. The researchers used\nquantitative measures to gather and analyze data.\nCorrelational methods and tests of differences were used to\nanalyze the quantitative relations of the variables parental\nattachment and love languages with resilience. Cross-\nsectional design was used to compare existing differences\namong the target groups.\nPopulation and Locale of the Study\nFor the survey questionnaires, 843 valid respondents were\nincluded in the statistical analysis. These are graduating uni-\nversity students of Saint Louis University, Baguio City,\nvalid to answer the questionnaire, these students must be\nFilipinos and not exceeding 23 years old. There were more\nfemales (67%) than males (37%). The university caters\nmostly to students coming from middle-income families.\nCollege life is challenging especially for students who have\nto hurdle the demands and requirements of graduation. They\nalso have to deal with the complexities of their lives outside\nthe academe. Several of these students may be juggling work\nand studies while some are young parents caring for their\nchildren. In addition, they have to fulfill their other interper-\nsonal roles in relation to their parents, romantic partners, sib-\nlings, and friends.\nData Gathering Tools and Procedures\nUpon administrative and ethics approval of this study, the\nresearchers distributed the questionnaires through the fac-\nulty or supervisors of graduating university students from\ndifferent undergraduate courses. The students were pro-\nvided informed consent through a letter attached to the\nquestionnaires.\nQuestionnaire.The entire questionnaire is self-administered\nand may be completed within 20 to 30 min. The graduating\nstudents answered the questionnaires the week immediately\nafter the mid-term examinations, hence, adding to the stress\ncomponent essential in resilience studies. The main mea-\nsures used with their descriptions are as follows:\nThe College Life Stress Inventory (Renner & Mackin,\nstudents may have encountered within the last 12 months.\nEach event has a corresponding stress rating and the sum\nof these ratings is computed to derive the stress rating per\nrespondent. Some items were slightly modified to make them\nmore content valid based on the culture. For example, attend-\ning an athletic or social event (e.g., games, parties; note that\nsocial events/parties were not included in the original).\nThe Relationship Questionnaire.These are four statements\neach describing the attachment patterns to a specific relation.\nThe attachment categories are based on the four-factor model\nof Bartholomew and Horowitz (1991). Half of the question-\nnaires distributed would measure attachment to their fathers\nwhile the rest would measure attachment to their mothers as\nsecure, pre-occupied, dismissing, or fearful. A 6-point rating\nscale is used with the following ratings and respective qualita-\ntive meanings: 1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = some-\nwhat disagree, 4 = somewhat agree, 5 = agree, and 6 = strongly\nagree. This same 6-point scale was used for the Parental Love\nLanguage Scale and the Resilience Measures.\nParental Love Language Scale. This is a 15-item measure of\nthe five-categories of love languages, which are (a) words of\naffirmation, (b) quality time, (c) gifts, (d) acts of service, and\n(e) physical touch. Based on the descriptions of Chapman\nand Campbell (1997), the researchers made three behav-\nioral items to represent each of the love language categories.\nFor the reliability of the measure given the sample of this\nMaximo and Carranza 5\nresearch, Cronbach's alpha coefficients were derived as fol-\nlows: (a) Full Scale (n = 15),  = .93; (b) words of affirma-\ntion (n = 3),  = .85; (c) quality time (n = 3),  = .81; (d) gifts\n(n = 3),  = .81; (e) acts of service (n = 3),  = .73; and (f)\nphysical touch (n = 3),  = .86.\nThe Child and Youth Resilience Measure\u00ad28 (CYRM-28,\nas part of the International Resilience Project (IRP), of the\nResilience Research Centre in Nova Scotia, Canada. It is a\nscreening tool for resilience among the youths aged 12 to\n23 years and it adopts an ecological model where individ-\nual, relational, communal, and cultural resources could be\nexplored. The computed reliability coefficients using the\nentire sample are as follows: (a) Full Scale (n =28),  = .91;\n(b) individual resilience factors (RF; n = 8),  = .70; (c) rela-\ntionship RF (n = 6),  = .70; (d) community RF (n = 8),  =\nShort Resilience Scale\u00ad7 (SRS-7). This is a seven-item test\nof resilience that the researchers developed based on the\ndefinition of resilience. The items pertain to a combination\nof behaviors that can help persons overcome difficulties\nor confront stresses in more effective ways. The computed\nreliability coefficient is  = .82 (n = 7). Compared with the\nCYRM-28, which mostly describes external resources, this\nmeasure pertains more to qualities found within the person.\nFor this research, resilience was measured by combining\nthe items in the CYRM-28 and SRS-7.\nResults\nThe influence of parental determinants on resilience was\nexplored through test of differences via ANOVA, t tests,\nPearson product\u00admoment correlation coefficients, and hier-\narchical multiple regression analysis. Test of differences are\nfirst presented followed by the correlational methods.\nTest of Differences\nDifferences in attachment styles.The dominant attachment\nstyle of the respondents was identified based on the item\nrated highest in the Relationship Questionnaire. Only those\nwith one highest rating on the four items were categorized. A\nwere categorized. One-way ANOVA was computed. The\nattachment having a moderate effect (2 = .085) on resil-\nience. The Tukey method shows that those with secure\nattachment have higher resilience level than those with fear-\nful and dismissing attachment.\nDifferences in level of love received.Two contrasting groups\nwere derived based on the scores in the love language full\nscale. The resilience level of the upper 27% (those who were\nloved more; n = 207) and the lower 27% (those who were\nloved less; n = 235) were compared via t tests for indepen-\nsignificant with very large effect (2 = 0.336). Those who\nhave received more love from their parents have signifi-\npared with those who have received less love (M = 4.4734;\nCorrelational Method\nSecure attachment has a significant positive relationship\nwith resilience, whereas fearful and dismissing attachments\n(both avoidant) have a significant negative relationship with\nresilience. Pre-occupied attachment is not significantly\nrelated to resilience. The full scale love language and its cat-\negories are positively related to resilience.\nHierarchical Multiple Regression Analysis\nHierarchical multiple regression analyses were computed by\nfirst entering attachment measures followed by love lan-\nguages measures as predictors of resilience. Pre-occupied\nattachment has insignificant Pearson correlations with resil-\nience and therefore was not entered into the regression.\nResilience Among Young Adults\nAttachment Styles significantly contribute to the variability\nof resilience in all conditions in Model 1 (Table 2) with all F\nvalues significant. When combined with Love Languages\n(Model 2 in Table 2), the variances accounted for by the\nparental determinants on resilience significantly increase as\nobserved by the higher values of Determination Coefficients\nTable 1.

Moreover, the\nadded contributions of Love Languages (R2 Change, Model\n2), over and above what is contributed by Attachment, are\nstill substantial with all F Change in Model 2 significant.\nGiven the beta coefficients in Table 3, the substantial\nparental predictors of resilience (betas italicized and in\nparentheses) are identified for the general group and for the\ntarget subgroupings.\nResilience among the young adults in general. Results show that\nquality time, words of affirmation, and acts of service from\nboth parents are more substantially associated with the resil-\nience of the general group. While quality time and a secure\nattachment from fathers associate more to resilience, the\nmothers' quality time, words of affirmation, and physical\ntouch substantially relate to the young adults' resilience.\nResilience among the high stress group. The high stress group\nconsists of the upper 27% scorers in the College Life Stress\nInventory (Renner & Mackin, 1998). Quality time from both\nparents, and even separately, either from fathers or mothers,\nmade a significant contribution to the variation in the resil-\nience of the high stress group. To a certain extent, resilience\nis also associated with paternal attachment that is more\nResilience among sons. The resilience of sons is substantially\naccounted for by the love languages quality time and physi-\ncal touch from both parents. Specifically, quality time from\nfathers and physical touch from mothers made a higher con-\ntribution to the resilience of sons.\nResilience among daughters. Quality time and words of affir-\nmation from both parents made a significant contribution to\nthe variation in the resilience of daughters. Resilience is\nmore associated with quality time from both fathers and\nmothers. In addition, a secure paternal attachment and words\nof affirmation from their fathers also link to the daughters'\nresilience.\nDiscussion\nThe findings confirm the hypotheses that resilience is posi-\ntively linked to secure attachment and negatively linked to\ninsecure attachment. Lower resilience is expected of inse-\ncure attachment specifically for the avoidant types--fearful\nand dismissing. Resilience seems to entail approach behav-\niors that individuals with avoidant attachment would less\nlikely do. Secure persons tend to be more trusting, coopera-\ntive, and helpful with reference to others. They would more\nlikely seek help having an internal working model that the\nothers--parents, relatives, teachers, other adults, and peers--\nare dependable.This coincides with Benzies and Mychasiuk's\n(2009) idea of optimizing resilience, that is, secure individu-\nals as opposed to avoidant ones are more likely to strengthen\ntheir protective factors at all interactive levels of the socio-\necological model.\nThe findings likewise support that resilience is positively\nlinked to Parental Love Language. Those who received more\nlove from their parents are more resilient. Chapman and\nCampbell (1997) described the concept of emotional tank in\npeople, which gets filled when loved by others. When the\nemotional tank of people is not empty, they can draw out inner\nstrength, which is most especially needed in times of stress.\nParental Determinants of Resilience\nThe three love languages combined, namely, quality time,\nwords of affirmation, and acts of service, contribute signifi-\ncantly to resilience. Quality time is expressed when parents\nshow genuine interest through attention, listening, understand-\ning feelings, and doing things together with children. Quality\ntime encourages communication and active listening. This\ncorroborates Zabriskiel and McCormick's (2001) observation\nthat spending time together and enjoying fun activities is asso-\nciated with kids and parents having a stronger emotional bond.\nThe emotional recharging provided in quality time enhances\nresilience. Resilience is likewise linked to receiving words\nTable 2.

Words of encour-\nagement helps promote and restore a person's self-esteem.\nThis finding is reinforced by Jennifer Kolari's (2009)\ndescriptions of the long-term impact of words on brain and\nneurological pathways. Repeated exposure to yelling fuels\nfear and anxiety, and a poor self-image that conditions chil-\ndren to anticipate poor, unsupportive responses and nega-\ntive experiences from the world, whereas positive verbal\nmessages, empathy, and the feeling of being heard tend to\nnurture the self, create positive expectations, and lay the\nfoundation of resilience.\nActs of service entails receiving practical help like finish-\ning house chores, providing needs and wants, as well as\nbeing assisted in projects and homework. Resilience in\nyoung adults is higher when they recall their parents render-\ning them needed service like cooking, fixing stuff, and\ndriving among others. Acts of service help build cooperation,\ntrust, and a sense of safety. It promotes resilience as by\nreceiving help, people may develop a more positive schema,\nthat is, life is not after all difficult, that problems have solu-\ntions, and that others are available for support. In sum, paren-\ntal love expressed through (a) quality time, (b) words of\naffirmation, and (c) acts of service, respectively, provide the\nemotional, motivational, and practical resources needed to\nbuild resilience in young adults.\nPaternal and Maternal Influences\nGenerally, quality time from both parents contributes largely\nto the resilience of these young adults. In addition, a secure\nattachment to fathers and the mothers' expression of love\nspecifically through words of affirmation and physical touch\nplay a role in resilience as well.\nTable 3.

Sig.\nUniversity\ngraduating students\nNote. Substantial beta coefficients (Sig. = p < .10) were italicized and in parentheses and considered for interpretation.\n8 SAGE Open\nThe role of a secure paternal attachment on resilience of\nyoung adults may relate to the finding of Rosenberg and\nWilcox (2006) who contend that the outcome in children is\nreflected in greater confidence to explore surroundings and\nbetter social connections with peers. The interaction of\nfathers to their children tends to promote independence and\nan orientation to the outside world. As a guide to the outside\nworld, children are influenced to explore the world comfort-\nably and to exhibit self-control and pro-social behavior. This\ncorroborates Steele and Steele's (2005) research data sug-\ngesting that children's relationship with their fathers will\nmore likely influence their understanding and resolution of\nemotional conflicts in the outer world of human interac-\ntion--for example, with siblings and peers. Many RFs are\nelements of the external world. Hence, when children have a\nsecure attachment to their fathers, they are more able to navi-\ngate their external world and effectively tap on these RFs.\nThis study also shows that mothers who express love\nthrough physical touch and words of affirmation contribute\nto the resilience of young adults. Words of affirmation that\ninclude encouragement and praises, especially from mothers,\ncan increase self-esteem. Increasing self-esteem enhances\nfeelings of competencies in basic life and problem-solving\nskills thereby promoting resilience. Mothers who have also\nprovided affection through touch (hugs, kisses, embrace)\ncontributed to the young adults' resilience. Future research\nmay try to delve more on this connection although the find-\nings seem to correspond with previous studies on touch and\nits influence on the survival and development of children\nsuch as the premature infants placed naked between their\nmother's breasts for extended periods of time (Feldman,\nWeller, Sirota, & Eidelman, 2003). Follow-up studies reveal\nthat by 10 years of age, these children also showed attenu-\nated stress response, improved autonomic functioning, orga-\nnized sleep, and better cognitive control (Feldman, Rosenthal,\n& Eidelman, 2014). Another connected study is on how mas-\nsage therapy was shown to increase the weight of pre-term\nbabies (Field, 2001) and to decrease the stress hormone cor-\ntisol and increase one's immune function (Field, 1998). It has\nproven to alleviate stress related to job, aging, and pregnancy\n(Field, Hernandez-Reif, Diego, Schanberg, & Kuhn, 2005).\nField (2002) also observed that intervention using massage\ntherapy decreased aggressive behavior and increased empa-\nthetic behavior among violent adolescents. From these cor-\nroborative studies, it may be implied that when young adults\nreceive loving physical touch, most specially from their\nmothers, it is related to a more effective structure in the brain\nand the body that allows them to behave more effectively.\nThese behavioral and cognitive controls are essential in\nbuilding resilience.\nHigh Stress Group\nQuality time is a strong predictor of the resilience among the\nhigh stress group. Stress can cause emotional exhaustion;\nhence, stressed people need a nurturing companion to restore\nemotional strength. Having someone who encourages com-\nmunication helps stressed people process the distressing\nemotions that accompany stress. Clear and open communica-\ntion allows them to share their reactions, accept emotions,\nand link them to outside sources of support.\nIt can be observed that a secure paternal attachment, and\nnot a dismissing one, predicts the resilience of the high stress\ngroup. Earlier it was mentioned that fathers orient children to\nthe external world, an outdoors approach as termed by\nDoucet (2009). A secure connection with fathers facilitates\nthe development of an internal working model that the exter-\nnal world is trustworthy. Securely attached individuals are\nmore comfortable exploring their environment allowing\nthem to find the resources they need to handle their stresses.\nResilience Among Sons and Daughters\nSons need quality time from their fathers. By spending qual-\nity time with their sons, fathers are able to model and teach\nbehaviors necessary for living. Therapist, educator, and\nauthor Michael Gurian (1998) discussed the role of the mas-\nculine nurturing system in the development of adolescent\nboys who seek the challenge and kindness of environments\nfull of male energy to inculcate discipline, morality teaching,\nand emotional sustenance. By reviewing studies on the role\nof fathers, it was noted that they spend more stimulating and\nplayful activities with their children (Doucet, 2009;\nRosenberg & Wilcox, 2006). Children learn to regulate their\nfeelings and behavior in these interactions. Roughhousing,\noften engaged in by boys with their fathers, can teach chil-\ndren to deal with aggressive impulses and physical contact\nwithout losing control of their emotions. The skills and\nbehavioral control processes learned by sons from their\nfathers could enhance their resilience.\nSons also need physical touch from their mothers as this\npredicts their resilience. Gurian (1998) described the emerg-\ning brain of an adolescent male during the second decade.\nBeing more spatial than females and with increasing testos-\nterone levels, boys tend toward activities that verge on vio-\nlence, physical activity, physical gesturing, and physical play.\nMales will then be more likely to be physical having fewer\nverbal tools than females in response to intense emotive reac-\ntions like anger. Given the advantage of physical touch on\nstabilizing physiological responses, it can be implied that\nyoung adult males who have received more maternal physical\ntouch will tend to be more resilient, able to regulate their\naggressive impulses, and capable of behavioral control.\nSons need quality time from their fathers, and daughters\nneed quality time from their mothers. Gender socialization\noccurs when children experience different child care behav-\niors from their mothers and fathers. Reviewed Filipino stud-\nies (Liwag, Dela Cruz, & Macapagal, 2002) show that\nalthough many Filipinos share the belief that child-rearing\npractice is a joint parental responsibility, in reality, the mother\nMaximo and Carranza 9\nis still ranked as the primary caretaker of her children. It was\nalso reported that during childhood years, girls naturally\nbecome closer to their mothers while boys become closer to\ntheir fathers. In the normal course of gender identity forma-\ntion, daughters and sons identify with their same-sexed par-\nent. Parents then become powerful models of masculine and\nfeminine behaviors for their children. Daughters could learn\nbest to solve problems encountered by women through their\nrelationship with their mothers. From their fathers, daughters\nneed to feel secure and receive words of acceptance, appre-\nciation, and encouragement from them. This supports find-\nings that positive father\u00addaughter relationships have shown\nbenefits in the areas of career success, relations with other\nmen, trust, joy, and self-confidence (Nielsen, 2007).\nConclusion\nParental factors are one of the external resources of resil-\nience. The study indicates that approach behaviors, charac-\nterized by secure attachment, make one more resilient as\nopposed to avoidant behaviors. Results also imply that lov-\ning parents raise resilient children. Three love languages,\nnamely, quality time, words of affirmation, and acts of ser-\nvice, contribute most to resilience. To love effectively, par-\nents need to, first, be a presence in the lives of their children,\nthat is, to become a source of emotional support. Second,\nparents need to be an affirmer of their children's strengths\nand, third, to be a loving steward by providing the practical\nneeds of their children. Quality time, words of affirmation,\nand acts of service are love languages that provide emo-\ntional, motivational, and practical resources, respectively.\nWhen children are loved well by their parents, their emo-\ntional tank gets filled and they get primed, bodily and psy-\nchologically, to face the challenges of life.\nThis study also provides insight on paternal and maternal\ninfluences most contributing of the young adults' resilience.\nQuality time from both parents is a basic love language that\ncontributes most to resilience, especially when high stress is\nencountered. A secure attachment to fathers is an advantage\nas they have the role of orienting their children to the exter-\nnal world. When securely attached to fathers, children are\nmore likely to view their external environment as a relatively\nsafe and comfortable place to explore. The mother's nurtur-\ning role, through affirming words and physical affection,\ncontribute to resilience as this may help build self-esteem.\nMoreover, the loving touch of mothers helps the body to\nrespond with lesser anxiety and greater calm. Maternal love\nappears to enhance the children's physical and psychological\nreadiness to confront the demands of the external world. This\nresearch provided evidence that parental love is a protective\nfactor that allows children to build resilience and its effect\ncontinues even until young adulthood.\nFathers and mothers have essential roles in developing\nresilience in their children. Both sons and daughters need\nquality time most especially from their parents of the same\nsex. Apart from emotional support, quality time allows for\nthe social learning of skills that father\u00adsons and mother\u00ad\ndaughters relationship could provide. In sum, this study sup-\nports the hypothesis that secure attachment and greater\nparental love result to higher resilience in young adults.\nSeveral recommendations could be made from this study's\nfindings. First, young adults are encouraged to continue their\nbonds with their parents and family and to increase their aware-\nness of available support systems that help build their resil-\nience. Parents are urged to spend quality time with their\nchildren, to affirm their worth, and continue providing practical\nhelp. Related community institutions (schools, churches, men-\ntal health agencies, government sector, etc.) could foster resil-\nience building programs among its constituents through\nrelevant activities such as curriculum development in schools,\nseminar/workshop offerings, and the establishment or strength-\nening of supportive agencies.\nFuture research may explore how far parent\u00adchild attach-\nment and parental love languages can predict or influence\nresilience throughout adulthood. Although this study proved\nthat the variables parental attachment and love are predictive\nof resilience, other explanatory research designs are called\nfor to validate a cause and effect relationship. This study\nincluded a very limited age range and setting for its respon-\ndents. Different findings may result granting a more diverse\nage group and population.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research and/or authorship of this article: This research was\nfunded by the University Research Grant Program for the Graduate\nSchool Faculty of Saint Louis University, Baguio City, Philippines.\nReferences\nAinsworth, M., & Bell, S.
