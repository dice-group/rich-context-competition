In\na group of smokers enrolled in a smoking cessation pro-\ngram, ADHD-IN symptoms were significantly associ-\nated with smoking motivation factors including smok-\ning for stimulation.12 Data from a large community sample\nof adolescents also showed that problems with atten-\ntion differentially predicted smoking status.13\nTo date, studies examining the relationship between\nADHD symptoms and smoking have focused primarily\non clinical or high-risk samples. Data from several larger\ncommunity samples as well as laboratory studies in hu-\nmans and nonhumans have also suggested that nicotine\nself-administration (ie, smoking) may be related to its\naugmenting effects on attention and executive function-\ning.14,15 Given the demonstrated association between in-\nattention and smoking across diverse samples and in-\nlaboratory experiments, the objective of the present study\nwas to examine the link between self-reported ADHD\nsymptoms and smoking status in a large population-\nbased sample of young adults while controlling for the\nconfounding effects of CD symptoms, sex, indicators of\nsocioeconomic status (parental education and receipt of\npublic assistance), and ethnicity. We examined data from\nthe National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health\n(Add Health) to accomplish this goal.16,17\nMETHODS\nThe study population was drawn from 20 747 adolescents from\nAdd Health, a nationally representative study of adolescents.\nThe longitudinal cohort includes 15 197 eligible respondents\nwho participated in in-home surveys on 3 separate occasions\nAdd Health survey included a sample stratified by region, ur-\nbanicity, school type, ethnic mix, and size to garner a nation-\nally representative sample. Precise details regarding the de-\nsign and data collection have been described elsewhere.16,17\nSAMPLE\nFor the present study, poststratification weights were unavail-\nable for 875 participants and the subpopulation of women who\nwere pregnant (n=379) were further excluded because it was\nbelieved that women who were pregnant may alter their smok-\ning behaviors. Information regarding CD symptoms and ADHD\nsymptoms was collected during waves I and III, respectively.\nplete data on items assessing ADHD and tobacco use.\nMEASURES\nParticipants were separated into 2 groups based on their self-\nreported smoking status during wave III. Those reporting hav-\ning ever smoked at least 1 cigarette every day for 30 days were\nindividuals were classified as \"never-regular smokers\" (n=8506,\n61.4%). The never-regular smoker group was composed of in-\ndividuals who had never tried smoking, had only taken 1 or 2\npuffs, who had taken puffs but never smoked an entire ciga-\nrette, or who had smoked an entire cigarette but never smoked\nregularly. We chose this classification since the primary aim\nof the study was to determine whether ADHD symptoms in-\ncreased the lifetime risk for regular smoking, regardless of cur-\nrent smoking status. Smoking behavior has been assessed in a\nsimilar manner in other epidemiological studies and has been\nshown to have acceptable reliability and validity among chil-\nTo further assess the relation between ADHD symptoms\nand smoking behaviors, 2 additional variables were exam-\nined: (1) self-reported age at onset of regular smoking (5-26\nyears); and for current regular smokers, (2) the number of ciga-\nrettes smoked per day in the last 30 days (1-100 cigarettes).\nIn wave III, participants were asked to retrospectively re-\nport ADHD symptoms experienced between the ages of 5 and\n12 years. Respondents were asked to report the frequency of a\nsymptom using a 4-point Likert scale: never or rarely, some-\ntimes, often, very often. One item asked in the retrospective\nADHD section of wave III (\"You were spiteful or vindictive\")\nis not a DSM-IV ADHD symptom and was excluded from analy-\nses; while 1 DSM-IV impulsivity symptom (\"Often interrupts\nor intrudes on others\") was not included in the retrospective\nADHD section. Thus, our analyses included responses to 9 IN\nand 8 hyperactive/impulsive (HI) symptoms.\nA symptom was considered present if it was experienced \"of-\nten\" or \"very often.\" This approach to dichotomizing symptoms\nhas been used in other community-based studies of ADHD symp-\ntomatology and is considered clinical convention.21 For our pri-\nmary analyses, the total number of symptoms reported (0-9 for\nIN; 0-8 for HI) was used as a measure of ADHD severity to assess\ntherelationbetweensymptomsandbothsmokingstatusandother\nsmoking outcomes (eg, age at onset of regular smoking, number\nof cigarettes smoked per day). For descriptive and bivariate analy-\nses, individuals were classified into 1 of 4 groups based on the\nnumberofreportedsymptoms:(1)6ormoreINsymptoms,fewer\nthan 6 HI symptoms; (2) 6 or more HI symptoms, fewer than 6\nINsymptoms;(3)6ormoreINsymptomsand6ormoreHIsymp-\ntoms; and (4) fewer than 6 HI and fewer than 6 IN symptoms.\nThe 6-symptom cutoff was chosen to be consistent with DSM-IV\nADHDcriteriarequiringthepresenceof6ormoresymptomsfrom\neither the IN or HI symptom domains.\nInternal consistency of the ADHD items specifically from\nthe Add Health data set was found to be adequate (Cronbach\n=.86). Moreover, parents of individuals reporting 6 or more\nsymptoms on either or both IN and HI scales were more likely\nto indicate learning or other behavioral problems at wave I; and\nthese individuals were also more likely to report taking medi-\nSince CD has been shown in previous studies to be an im-\nportant mediator of the risk between ADHD and substance use,22\nwe included a measure of CD symptoms in multivariate analy-\nses.

These relations among ADHD\nsymptoms and smoking behavior were largely linear with\neach additional symptom typically conferring addi-\ntional risk of regular smoking. Hyperactivity/impul-\nsivity symptoms were found to be a better predictor of\nlifetime regular smoking than IN symptoms. Among regu-\nlar smokers, more ADHD symptoms were also associ-\nated with earlier regular smoking and with greater ciga-\nrette consumption--again in a largely linear manner. The\npresent findings are consistent with previous reports link-\ntrary to previous studies which have reported a stronger\nlink between IN symptoms and smoking, our data sug-\ngest that HI symptoms confer greater risk for ever regu-\nlar smoking. Several methodological features of our study\nmay account for this difference. First, the average age of\nrespondents in the present sample (21.94 years) was con-\nsiderably higher than other studies (eg, 10th grade high\nschool students13). Since the present sample was older,\nthe opportunity to initiate and maintain smoking behav-\niors would necessarily be higher in this group. More-\nover, the relation among ADHD symptoms and smok-\ning might change over time. Future studies will be needed\nto examine this hypothesis.\nSecond, the primary smoking outcome measure in the\ncurrent study was based on a history of lifetime regular\nuse defined as smoking at least 1 cigarette per day for 30\ndays. In other studies, the primary smoking outcome vari-\nables were generally defined on the basis of much more\ninfrequent use (eg, ever tried at least 1 puff of a ciga-\nrette13). As such, the use of a more stringent smoking out-\ncome measure may have resulted in differential associa-\ntions with HI and IN symptoms. The current study has\nseveral important strengths. First, the results reported here\nare based on a large epidemiological sample and were ana-\nlyzed using population-based statistical approaches. As\nsuch, these findings extend those from community and\nclinical samples and are highly generalizable. A second\nstrength is that the incremental influence of individual\nADHD symptoms was examined while also controlling for\nthe effects of other variables known to be associated with\nsmoking (eg, socioeconomic status, CD symptoms). The\nresults, therefore, allow for a more accurate view of the\nassociation among these important variables.\nOne limitation of the present study was the use of ret-\nrospectively reported ADHD symptoms as a primary in-\ndependent variable. The nature of the Add Health sur-\nvey was such that individuals were asked to report on\nsymptoms occurring approximately 10 years before the\ntime of report. The use of retrospective report is com-\nmon in clinical practice when working with adults with\nADHD and data exist that support the reliability and va-\nlidity of these self-reports29-32 (also J. N. Epstein, PhD,\nand S.H.K., unpublished data, 2005). We also demon-\nstrated adequate reliability and validity of this approach\nin the present sample. A second limitation of this study\nwas that none of the models tested controlled for comor-\nbid non-nicotine substance use disorders, which are also\nhighly related to smoking. As such, it is possible that the\nrelationship between ADHD symptoms and smoking\ncould be confounded by concurrent substance use. Given\nthe prevalence rates reported for smoking in our study\nhowever, this possibility seems unlikely.\nThe results of this investigation suggest that the num-\nber of HI symptoms are strongly associated with the like-\nlihood of regular smoking, even in individuals report-\ning subclinical ADHD symptom levels. By contrast, IN\nsymptoms are not significantly associated with lifetime\nregular smoking when all variables including HI symp-\ntoms are controlled. Thus, the findings extend existing\nresearch suggesting a possible link between ADHD symp-\ntoms and smoking risk. Further work is necessary, how-\never, to more precisely characterize the nature of the re-\nlationship between ADHD symptoms and smoking. For\nexample, it will be important in future studies to deter-\nmine whether specific ADHD symptoms or symptom clus-\nters are more strongly associated with smoking risk.\nThese findings also suggest that self-reported ADHD\nsymptoms are associated with age at onset of regular smok-\ning. Given the established link among earlier age at on-\nset of smoking and risk for subsequent nicotine depen-\ndence and other drug use problems,33-35 these data are of\nhigh clinical and public health significance. The nature\nof the present study does not allow for any conclusions\nto be drawn regarding potential mechanisms that might\naccount for the relation between ADHD symptoms and\nsmoking. However, regulation of dopamine and seroto-\nnin have been linked with both smoking onset and de-\npendence as well as with ADHD symptomatalogy.36,37 Sub-\nsequent experimental research will be needed to further\nexamine the relationship between smoking and ADHD\nsymptoms and possible underlying mechanisms. How-\never, the robustness of the reported association empha-\nsizes the need for subsequent experimental research to\nexamine these relations.\nSubmitted for Publication: November 2, 2004; final re-\nCorrespondence: Scott H.
