    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn the literature, perspective space has been introduced as a model of visual space. Perspective\nspace is grounded on the perspective nature of visual space during both binocular and monocular\nvision. A single parameter, that is, the distance of the vanishing point, transforms the geometry of\nphysical space into that of perspective space. The perspective-space model predicts perceived\nangles, distances, and sizes. The model is compared with other models for distance and size\nperception. Perspective space predicts that perceived distance and size as a function of physical\ndistance are described by hyperbolic functions. Alternatively, power functions have been widely\nused to describe perceived distance and size. Comparison of power and hyperbolic functions\nshows that both functions are equivalent within the range of distances that have been judged in\nexperiments. Two models describing perceived distance on the ground plane appear to be\nequivalent with the perspective-space model too. The conclusion is that perspective space\nunifies a number of models of distance and size perception.\n",

Erkelens\nExperimental Psychology, Helmholtz Institute, Utrecht University,\nThe Netherlands\n Keywords\nvisual space, perceived distance, perceived size, physical space\nIntroduction\nPhysical space can be defined as the boundless three-dimensional extent in which objects have\nsize, form, and position. Physical space is homogeneous and isotropic within the extent of\nhuman vision, implying that objects do not change in size or form under translation and\nrotation. Visual space is the extent that we, that is, human beings, perceive through vision.\nVisual space differs from physical space, especially at long viewing distances. It is neither\nhomogeneous nor isotropic, implying that objects are perceived to change in size or form\nunder translation and rotation. Perspective space has been proposed as a model of visual\nto describe empirical data of distance and size perception. The single parameter of the\nmodel, that is, the distance of the vanishing point was inferred to be about 30 m or more.\nCorresponding author:\nCasper J.

Distances of the vanishing point inferred\nfrom perspective angles were shorter than 6 m. The large difference between the distances of\nvanishing points in the two studies suggests that the models of Gilinsky and Erkelens have\ndifferent geometries. An alternative explanation is that perceived distances and angles cannot\nbe described by a single perspective space. The purpose of this study is to investigate\nproperties of perspective space in relation to distance and size perception and to compare\nthe models of Gilinsky and Erkelens with each other and with other models of distance and\nsize perception.\nResearch of distance and size perception has a long history (for a comprehensive review\nsee Wagner, 2006). The extensive literature on the topic presents a plethora of experimental\nresults, which together do not seem to go well with a specific geometry of visual space.\nResults depended so heavily on methods, conditions, and instructions that researchers\neven repudiated the concept of visual space altogether (Cuijpers, Kappers, & Koenderink,\n2002). Wagner (2006) championed the idea, less remote from the intuitive notion of a visual\nspace, that we should see visual space as a family of spaces whose individual geometries differ\nfrom each other depending on experimental conditions and mental shifts in the meaning of\nsize and distance. This study will show that perspective space is such a family of spaces.\nPerspective space will prove to be an attractive model for distance and size perception\nbecause it fits well to many experimental results and unifies a number of existing models.\nAnother attractive property of perspective space is that it matches both physical space and\npictures in a natural and simple way.\nErkelens' Model of Perspective Space\nPerspective space is the collective name for spaces that differ from each other by the value of a\nsingle parameter, that is, the distance of the vanishing point. Figure 1 shows objects, rings in\nthis example, in physical space (Figure 1(a) and (c)) and how their sizes, distances, and\ndirections are transformed in perspective space (Figure 1(b) and (d)). Object size is\nindependent of distance in physical space (Figure 1(c)) but not in perspective space\n(Figure 1(d)). Perspective space is defined relative to the position and viewing direction of\nan observer. The distance of its vanishing point characterizes a certain perspective space.\nGenerally, the distance is finite meaning that perspective space is bounded in depth.\nThe family of perspective spaces includes two spaces whose geometries are equivalent to\nspaces in the physical world. The analogue spaces are physical space itself and the\nprojection of physical space on a flat surface orthogonal to the viewing direction, that is,\nthe picture plane (Figure 1(a) and (c)), a planar representation of the retinal image. Distance\nof the vanishing point is infinite for physical space and zero for the picture plane. Positions of\nobjects in perspective space are best expressed in terms of a two-dimensional direction\nrelative to the viewing direction and a one-dimensional depth relative to the position of\nthe observer. In perspective space, depth depends on distance of the vanishing point but\ndirection does not, implying that directions of objects are identical in all perspective spaces,\nincluding physical space and the picture plane.\nPerspective space is Euclidean, meaning that the metric is the straight-line distance and\nangles of triangles add up to 180 (Erkelens, 2015c). A property of perspective space is that\nstraight lines in one perspective space constitute straight lines in any other perspective space\n(Figure 2). As a consequence, line pieces aligned in physical space remain aligned in\nperspective space (Erkelens, 2015c). This property has been shown experimentally for\nvisual space (Cuijpers et al., 2002). Another property of perspective space is that parallel\n2 i-Perception\nlines in one space generally transfer to converging or diverging lines in other spaces.\nThus, parallelism is not preserved. Parallel lines in frontal planes are the exception. Such\nlines remain parallel in all perspective spaces. Experimentally, parallelism was found not\npreserved in visual perception for lines having orientations in depth (Cuijpers, Kappers, &\nKoenderink, 2000). Figure 2(a) shows that lines in physical space running parallel to the\nviewing direction converge in perspective space to a vanishing point VP lying in front of the\nobserver. Conversely, lines in perspective space parallel to the viewing direction converge in\nphysical space to a vanishing point VP lying behind the observer (Figure 2(c)). The famous\nparallel alleys of Hillebrand (1902) and Blumenfeld (1913) are examples of parallel lines\nin visual space that are described by the model of perspective space (Erkelens, 2015c).\nThe distance alleys of Blumenfeld (1913) are explained by perspective space in\ncombination with the size-distance-invariance hypothesis (Epstein, 1963). Figure 2(b)\nshows parallel lines in physical space that have an orientation in depth different from the\nFigure 1. Sizes and distances of rings in physical and perspective space. (a) One ring in physical space.\nThe observer (half sphere at the right side) fixates the center of the ring (blue). The black line indicates the\n(binocular or monocular) viewing direction. The ring defines a set of directions (forming the cone with its\nvertex at the observer). The ring also defines a set of lines parallel to the viewing direction, indicating physical\ntrajectories if the ring would move in the viewing direction. The parallel lines together form a cylinder,\nprojecting a circle the size of the ring in the plane of the observer. The orange plane orthogonal to the viewing\ndirection contains the projection (orange) of the ring on a two-dimensional planar surface. (b) The ring of (a)\nin perspective space. The directional cone is identical to that in physical space. The parallels in physical space\nare converted to lines converging to a vanishing point in perspective space, indicating trajectories if the ring\nwould move in the viewing direction. Together, the converging lines form a cone having its vertex at the\nvanishing point. Intersection between the two cones forms the ring (red) in perspective space. (c) Two\nidentical rings at different distances in physical space. The two rings (blue) project to two concentric rings\n(orange) in the picture plane, indicating their relative size on the retina. (d) The two rings of (c) in perspective\nspace. Size ratio of the rings (red) depends on the distance of the vanishing point and lies in between size\nratios in the picture plane (orange) and physical space (blue) for positive finite vanishing distances.\nErkelens 3\nviewing direction. These lines converge to vanishing points of other perspective spaces.\nThese perspective spaces are defined by viewing directions running parallel to the lines of\nthe grids in physical space.\nDistance and Size Perception\nThe model of perspective space makes predictions for distance and size perception. Since\ndirection and distance behave differently in perspective space, use of a polar coordinate\nsystem would be appropriate. However, perceived distances and sizes are usually expressed\nin meters rather than degrees. Therefore, it is convenient to use a Cartesian coordinate system\nhaving its origin at the observer and the z-axis along the viewing direction (Figure 3).\nFurthermore, Cartesian coordinates are helpful in comparing derived equations directly to\nequations presented in the literature.\nFigure 3(a) shows in one graph the right half of the cross-sections along the z-axes of the\nphysical and perspective spaces shown in Figure 1(a) and (b). Since perspective space is used\nas a model of visual space, the term visual will be used as a replacement of the term\nperspective.\nFigure 2. Transformations between physical and perspective shapes. (a) A two-dimensional grid in physical\nspace (blue) is located at a certain distance from the observer (indicated by arcs at the right side). Each point\nof the grid defines a direction (the black dotted lines are examples). Each point also defines a line parallel to\nthe viewing direction (blue dotted lines) intersecting with the frontal plane of the observer. The parallels in\nphysical space converge to the vanishing point VP in perspective space (red dotted lines). Intersections\nbetween directions and vanishing lines define points of the grid in perspective space. Together the\nintersections form a deformed grid (red). Transformation from physical to perspective space affects shape,\nsize and distance of the grid. A physical grid is shown whose lines are parallel or orthogonal to the viewing\ndirection. (b) The same physical grid is shown but rotated clockwise by 30 about its center. Note that the\ncomputed perspective grids of (a) and (b) are not rotated versions of each other. (c) The parallels in\nperspective space converge to a vanishing point VP in physical space lying behind the observer.\n4 i-Perception\nThe relationship between distance in visual and physical space is given by\nZv\nZp\n\u00bc\nVP\nZp \u00fe VP\nSince Sp\nand Sv\ndefine similar triangles relative to the observer, sizes have the same\nrelationship as distances\nSv\nSp\n\u00bc\nVP\nZp \u00fe VP\nThe two equations show that perceived distance and size depend both on physical distance\nand the vanishing distance of visual space. Although the relationship between physical and\nvisual size is simple, it cannot directly be applied to fit experimental results presented in the\nliterature. Usually, observers matched sizes of two objects. One object, called the standard,\nwas fixed of size and placed at various distances. The other object, called the comparison, was\nplaced at a fixed distance and adjustable of size. Figure 3(b) shows the geometry for a set of\nstandard and comparison objects. The general relationship between the physical and visual\nsizes of the two objects is given by\nSpc\nSps\n\u00bc\nSvc\nSvs\nZpc \u00fe VP\nZps \u00fe VP\nFigure 3. Geometries for distance and size judgments. (a) A line in physical space (blue) of size Sp\nis located\nat distance Zp\nfrom the observer (arc at the right side). In perspective space, as a model for visual space, the\nline (red) gets size Sv\nand distance Zv\nif the vanishing point is placed at distance VP. (b) A standard line in\nphysical space of fixed size Sps\nis located at a variable distance Zps\nfrom the observer. A comparison line in\nphysical space of adjustable size Spc\nis located at a fixed distance Zpc\nfrom the observer. In visual space, the\nlines have sizes Svs\nand Svc\n, respectively, if the vanishing point is at distance VP. The vertical, dotted lines on\nthe right side of the graphs represent the plane of the observer orthogonal to the viewing direction.\nErkelens 5\nEquations (1) and (3) are derived in the Appendix.\nMatching perceived sizes in a typical experiment means that observers are asked to set Svc\nequal to Svs\n, reducing Equation (3) to\nSpc\nSps\n\u00bc\nZpc\n\u00fe VP\nZps\n\u00fe VP\nFigure 4(a) shows relationships between visual and physical distances as expressed by\nEquation (1). The graph shows three classes of relationships. If VP is positive, visual\ndistance is an underestimation of physical distance and becomes equal to VP for objects at\ninfinity. In other words, visual space is a bounded space. If VP is infinite (blue line), visual\nand physical distances are equal. Then, visual space is unbounded. If VP is negative,\nobservers overestimate physical distances. Negative VPs are associated with inverted\nperspective (Arnheim, 1972), also called reverse perspective (Derksen, 1999; Wade &\nHughes, 1999), or occasionally, Byzantine perspective (Deregowski, Parker, & Massironi,\n1994). If VP is negative, parallel lines in physical space are perceived to diverge rather than\nconverge with distance. Negative VPs are discussed later in relation to instructions that have\nbeen given to observers in size and distance judgment tasks.\nFigure 4(b) shows relationships for perceived size as described by Equation (4). The graph\nshows ratios for two equally large perceived stimulus sizes positioned at different\ndistances. The horizontal line (blue) for which VP is infinite shows the law of size\nconstancy indicating that perceived size is independent of distance. Perceived size decreases\nwith distance for positive VPs. This phenomenon is called underconstancy of size. Decrease\nin size with distance is fully determined by stimulus size in the picture or on the retina,\nrespectively, if VP is zero. The negative VP is associated with overestimating size with\nincreasing distance.\nFigure 4. Effect of vanishing distance on perception of distance and size. (a) Perceived distance Zv\ncomputed\nas a function of physical distance Zp\nfor a number of distances of the vanishing point VP. (b) Size of the\ncomparison stimulus Spc\nrelative to size of the standard Sps\ncomputed as a function of physical distance Zp\nfor\na number of distances of the vanishing point VP. Zv\n, Zp\n, and VP are distances expressed in meters. Although\nboth physical space and perspective space are rectilinear (flat), the perspective transformation of the\nnoninfinite vanishing point implies that the relationship between distances in the two spaces represented in\nthese plots is curvilinear.\n6 i-Perception\nOther Models of Distance and Size Perception\nGilinsky's Model\nEquations (1) and (2), describing the relationship between visual and physical distances and\nsizes, are identical to the relationships derived by Gilinsky (1951). This means that the models\nof Gilinsky and Erkelens have the same geometry. According to Gilinsky herself,\ncomputations were mainly inspired by Luneburg's theory of a curved visual space (1947,\nthe two formulas [for distance and size] are rigorously derived from the basic metric of visual\nspace as established mathematically (for binocular vision) by Luneburg (1947, 1950). Second, the\nsame two formulas are mathematically derived (somewhat less rigorously but without restriction\nto binocular vision) from the known principles of visual perspective. Finally, the same two\nformulas are derived by a simple inductive method of mathematical composition for the two\nboundary laws of size constancy and retinal image (visual angle). All three methods of derivation\nyield the identical pair of formulas to express a unifying law of visual space perception.\nAs Fry (1952) pointed out, Gilinsky (1951) made substitutions in Luneburg's equations,\nwhich turned Luneburg's essentially non-Euclidean metric into a Euclidean metric.\nThus, Gilinsky (1951) used a Euclidean metric and described a flat rather than curved\nspace for the domains of monocular as well as binocular vision. Gilinsky's equation has\nbeen very successful in describing considerable amounts of experimental data (Fry, 1952).\nNevertheless, Baird and Wagner (1991) dismissed Gilinsky's equation for distance perception\nbecause the computed equation could not describe overestimation of distance as was\nobserved in a number of experimental studies.\nEquation (4) is mathematically equivalent to the equation Gilinsky (1951) derived for size\nratios. However, interpretation and usefulness are different. Gilinsky (1951) computed\nsize ratios by assuming a distance, called the ``normal'' viewing distance, at which\nperceived size was equal to physical size, which she called the ``true'' size. Thus, in size\njudgments between comparison and standard stimuli, distance of the comparison stimulus\nwas limited to the one believed to be ``normal''. Equation (4) does not have this limitation\nbecause it describes the ratio between two physical sizes, which are perceived as equally large.\nBoth physical sizes can be positioned at any distance from the observer. Equation (4) is a\nspecial case of Equation (3). Equation (3), describing the general relationship between\nphysical and perceived sizes, is also valid for conditions in which physical sizes are\nperceived differently from each other. For instance, it can be used in a task where the size\nof one object is judged as being twice the size of another.\nOoi and He's Model\nMany studies have reported that judged distance is influenced by ground surface information\nHe, Wu, Ooi, Yarbrough, & Wu, 2004; Madison, Thompson, Kersten, Shirley, & Smits,\nHe (2007) took errors in perceived slant of the ground surface as the starting point for\nderiving a distance equation. The equation reads\nd \u00bc\nDH= sin \nH cos = sin  \u00fe D\nErkelens 7\nwhere d is perceived distance, D is physical distance, H is height of the eye above the ground,\nand  is perceived slant of the ground surface. The authors showed that their ground-based\nequation took the same form as Gilinsky's equation if slant error was small. Difference\nbetween slants of planes in physical and visual space is a characteristic property of the\nperspective-space model if vanishing distances are finite (Erkelens, 2015c). Figure 5(a)\nshows computed grids in physical space, visual space and the picture plane according the\nperspective-space model. The grid on the ground surface in physical spaces is slanted towards\nthe observer in visual space if the distance of its vanishing point is finite. Perceived slant\ndepends on vanishing distance. At one extreme, the visual grid coincides with the physical\ngrid if the distance is infinite. At the other extreme, the visual grid becomes oriented\northogonal to the viewing direction if the distance is zero. The equation for perceived\ndistance of objects on the ground plane derived by Ooi and He (2007) is almost identical\nto the one derived from the model of perspective space. The equation is derived here for the\ngeometry presented by Ooi and He (2007), in which the observer views along the z-axis\n(Figure 5(b)). In the Appendix, the equation is derived for an observer fixating the object\non the ground. The equations are identical in the two viewing conditions.\nWith Zv \u00bc d cos  and Zp \u00bc D, Equation (1) reads\nd cos \nD\n\u00bc\nVP\nD \u00fe VP\nFigure 5. Relationship between perceived and physical distance on the ground plane. (a) Geometry of grids\nis according to the perspective-space model. The grid (blue) on the ground in physical space has an equivalent\ngrid (red) in visual space, whose distance of the vanishing point is finite. The orange grid represents the\nobserver's proximal image, that is, the projection of the physical grid onto a plane orthogonal to the viewing\ndirection (dashed line). (b) The vertical cross-section along the z-axis of (a) shows the geometry for an\nobserver at height H above the ground, judging the distance from his feet to an object on the ground.\nGeometry and symbols are identical to those used by Ooi and He (2007). Viewing direction is along the\nz-axis. The blue and red points indicate associated locations in physical space and visual space.\n8 i-Perception\nBecause VP \u00bc H= sin , Equation (6) can be rewritten as follows\nd \u00bc\nDH= sin \nH cos = sin  \u00fe D cos \nEquation (7) is almost identical to Equation (5) proposed by Ooi and He (2007). Term\nD cos  is different, it replaces the term D in Ooi and He's equation. However, for angles\n < 4, as have been measured by Ooi and He (2007), the terms differ less than 0.5%.\nWagner's Models\nSeveral investigators of distance judgments have proposed a power function for the\nrelationship between perceived and physical distance (Baird & Wagner, 1991; Da Silva,\ncan be written as d \u00bc  D\n. The power function has two parameters, namely scaling factor \nand exponent \n. Wagner (2006) fitted power functions to a great number of data from the\nliterature. Across the board, the fits were very good. Wagner (2006) did not fit hyperbolic\nfunctions to the same set of data. Hyperbolic functions have only one parameter, the\nvanishing distance VP. To investigate differences between the two functions, hyperbolic\nfunctions were fitted to power functions presented by Wagner (2006). Fits were made for\nphysical distances between 2 m and 50 m, distances relevant for the reported judgments\n(Figure 6(a)). Fits were made to the full range of power functions that described the\nexperimental distance judgments. The area between the hyperbolic and power function fits\nas a percentage of the area between the power function fit and the x-axis was used as a\nmeasure for the difference between the two fits. Differences were smaller than 2% for\nhyperbolic functions having VPs larger than 20 m. Differences were larger for hyperbolic\nfunctions with smaller VPs mainly due to poor fits at the very short distances. Considering\nthe variability in distance judgments, hyperbolic functions would have fit the experimental\ndata about equally well as did the power functions. The hyperbolic and power functions\nbecome very different from each other at very far distances because perceived distance is\nFigure 6. Comparison of distance functions. (a) Hyperbolic functions (red) are fitted to power functions\n(green) predicting relationships between visual (Zv\n) and physical (Zp\n) distance. Distances of the vanishing point\n(VP) specify the hyperbolic functions. (b) Linear contraction functions (blue) are fitted to power (green) and\nhyperbolic functions (red). Zv\n, Zp\n, and VP are distances expressed in meters.\nErkelens 9\nbounded for hyperbolic functions but not for power functions. The fact that the perceived\ndistance of extremely far objects, such as the moon, is noninfinite implies that visual space\nhas a bounded extent. This property of visual space argues against using power functions for\ndescribing perceived distances. An argument in favor of hyperbolic functions is that these\nfunctions follow directly from a model of visual space, namely perspective space. There is yet\nno model of visual space that predicts power functions.\nAnother model of Wagner (1985, 2006) describes distances between visible stakes in three-\ndimensional space. Analysis of judgments of distances between stakes that were randomly\nplaced in two- and three-dimensional spaces showed that physical distances were seen more\nthan twice as large in frontal orientations as these were in in-depth orientations (Wagner,\n1985). This result led to formulation of the vector contraction model of visual space.\nAccording to this model, the component of physical space frontal to the observer is\nunchanged in visual space, but the in-depth component is contracted. According to the\nmodel, frontally oriented sizes obey perfect size constancy. In-depth oriented sizes are\ncontracted linearly as a function of distance. This implies that the model is not compatible\nwith power and hyperbolic functions of distance. Figure 6(b) shows that linear functions only\nmatch power and hyperbolic functions for contraction factors near one, and thus, for visual\nspaces that closely match physical space.\nFoley's Model\nFoley, Ribeiro-Filho, and Da Silva (2004) also investigated perceived distances between\nstakes in three-dimensional space, which the authors called perceived extents. Foley et al.\n(2004) proposed a model in which perceived extent is proportional to the product of\nmagnified image size and perceived distance (Figure 7(a)). The computations of extents\nwere based on three equations with in total four free parameters. Foley et al. (2004)\ncomputed perceived extent as Sv \u00bc\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nq\n\u00bc  \u00fe QP and\n\u00bc R=\u00f0F \u00fe GR\u00de. Magnified image size 00\nwas obtained from image size  by adding a term\nwith the two free parameters Q and P. Perceived egocentric distance R0 was obtained from\nphysical distance R by the expression with the two parameters F and G. The expression for\nR0 resembles somewhat that for perceived distance in perspective space as described by\nEquation (1). However, Equation (1) relates perceived to physical distance with help of\nonly one parameter. Foley et al. (2004) used two parameters (F and G) for relating\nperceived to physical distances and another two parameters (Q and P) for relating extents\nto image sizes. To compare fits to data of perceived distances and extents by Foley's model\nwith fits by the model of perspective space, perceived positions (X', Z') according to the\nmodel of perspective space were computed from the physical positions (X, Z) of the stakes by\napplying Equations (1) and (2). Extents Sp\nand Sv\nwere computed as Euclidean distances\n(Figure 7(b)). Foley et al. (2004) recorded the physical coordinates of the 14 stakes used in\ntheir experiments in a table as (X, Z) coordinates. In another table, the authors recorded all\nthe measured median extents in four groups of 91 data points, namely, separately for\nbinocular and monocular viewing and for viewing at far and near distances. The perceived\negocentric distances of the stakes are shown as a function of their physical distances for\nbinocular viewing in Figure 8(a) and for monocular viewing in Figure 8(b). The data were fit\nby Foley's distance function with the parameters F and G, and by the distance function of\nperspective space with parameter VP. The current values computed for F and G and root\nmean square errors (RMSE) are identical to those given by Foley et al. (2004). Both models\nprovided good fits to the data. The slightly smaller root mean square errors for Foley's model\nwere to be expected because the model contains two free parameters and the perspective-\nspace model just one. Adjusted R2 values, as a goodness-of-fit measure for the two nonlinear\nmodels, were hardly different from each other (Foley: 0.996 (binocular), 0.994 (monocular);\nExtents computed by the perspective space model were compared with reported extents for\na range of distances of the vanishing point (VP). Figure 8(c) to (f) shows the results for values\nof VP that produced the lowest root mean square errors (RMSEs). On average, the RMSEs\nare slightly larger than those resulting from Foley's model (Foley et al. 2004). For perceived\ndistance during binocular viewing, fits of the perspective model were best for VP having a\ndistance of 59 m. Optimal VPs were about three times as large for perceived extents under the\nsame viewing condition. During monocular viewing, best fits of the distance data were\ncomputed for a VP of 98 m. The optimal VP was about equal for near extents. For far\nextents, fits of the perspective model were somewhat poorer. Best fits were obtained for\nVPs indistinguishable from infinity.\nDiscussion\nPerspective space is not a neurobiological model of visual space. It does not explain or even\nsuggest how visual space is constructed from retinal images and neural processes. Instead,\nperspective space describes how geometric quantities in visual space relate to those in physical\nspace and pictures. The model is based on two assumptions about visual space. One\nassumption is that visual space is Euclidean, implying that geodesics are straight lines.\nLooking at a straight railway line, road, or tube oriented in depth shows that preserved\nFigure 7. Comparison of the perspective-space model with Foley's model. (a) According to Foley's model, a\nphysical line (blue) of size Sp\n, whose ends are located at distances R1\n, is perceived as a line (red) of size\nSv\nhaving the ends at distances R0\n. (b) The same physical line and how it is perceived according to the\nperspective-space model.\nstraightness is a reasonable assumption for far and central vision (Erkelens, 2015a, 2015b).\nVisual space being Euclidean also implies that line pieces aligned in physical space remain\naligned in visual space (Cuijpers et al., 2002). The second assumption is that visual directions\nare identical in physical and visual space. Evidence for identical directions comes from aiming\ndevices and eye movements. In the event of differences between physical and visual directions,\nthese would occur as offsets or magnifications of the visual field relative to the physical field.\nOffsets are highly improbable because all kinds of aiming devices would be useless otherwise.\nMagnifications are improbable too because voluntary saccadic eye movements made between\ncontinuously visible targets are highly accurate relative to the required retinal angles\n(Collewijn, Erkelens, & Steinman, 1988; Erkelens, Steinman, & Collewijn, 1989). One\ncould argue that eye movements and other motor actions operate on stimuli in physical\nspace and do not affect visual space. However, convincing arguments in the empirical\nsciences support the view that perception of the external world is scaled by action-specific\nFigure 8. Model predictions for distance and extent. (a) Perceived distance (Zv\n) measured during binocular\nviewing of stakes positioned at various physical distances (Zv\n) to the observer. Data are from Foley et al.\n(2004). Lines are fits by the models of Foley (green) and perspective space (red). (b) Perceived distance\nmeasured during binocular viewing. (c, d, e, and f) Reported extents in four experimental conditions are\nplotted against extents predicted by the perspective space model. Red lines indicate perfect predictions.\nFitting the perspective-space model to perceived angles, distances, and sizes resulted in a\nwide range of inferred vanishing-point distances. Although data come from different studies\nand observers, it is hard to imagine that visual space defined by a single vanishing-point\ndistance can describe all the judgments of individual observers. To illustrate this, data from\nindividual observers showed that eye height affects judgments of distance (Ooi & He, 2007)\nand in-depth oriented angles (Erkelens, 2015a). Comparison of different studies suggests that\ndistances of vanishing points also depend on the attribute that is judged. Distances of\nvanishing points computed from judgments of in-depth oriented angles are shorter than\n6 m (Erkelens, 2015a). Distances computed from the parallel-alley data of Blumenfeld\n(1913) were even shorter than 1 m, probably because of the extremely small eye height at\nwhich the stimuli were viewed. Vanishing distances computed from distance judgments\ncomputed from size judgments made in the same studies range from about 100 m to infinity.\nThe vanishing point is a theoretical attribute of perspective space. It is questionable whether\nobservers can judge its distance. The wide range of inferred distances of vanishing points\nsuggests that visual space is best described by a perspective space whose depth depends on\ncondition and attribute. Apparently, observers are insensitive to the fact that different\nattributes of depth belong to different perspective spaces. The insensitivity is convincingly\nillustrated by a great number of perspective paintings. Laymen as well as experts of\nperspective are not aware of inconsistencies between in-depth oriented angles and distances\nin many high-quality paintings of famous artists (Erkelens, 2016).\nComparison With Competing Models\nThe perspective-space model has been compared with five models of distance and size\nperception. The first model was the mathematical model of Gilinsky (1951). Although\nbased on different principles, equations for distance and size derived by Gilinsky (1951)\nare equivalent to those given by the perspective-space model. Advantage of the\nperspective-space model is its wider applicability and greater simplicity, giving analytical\nsolutions for perceived distances, sizes, and angles. The second model was that of Ooi and\nHe (2007) who proposed their model to describe a particular phenomenon, namely,\nforeshortening of distance on the ground plane. Ooi and He's model describes perceived\ndistances of objects on the ground relative to the feet of the observer. Computations of\nperceived distance require estimates of eye height and another perceptual parameter,\nnamely, the perceived inclination of the ground plane. The almost identical equation given\nby the perceptual-space model shows that the experimental results of Ooi and He (2007) may\nreflect perceived and physical distances of objects (Zv\nand Zp\nin Figure 9) relative to the\nviewing point of the observer, that is, the eye or the head. Differences between both models\nare too small to decide which model best describes the data of Ooi and He (2007).Li, and\nDurgin (2012) proposed an alternative hypothesis, the angular expansion hypothesis. The\nhypothesis, assuming exaggerations in visual angle, was also used to describe perceived\nforeshortening of distance on the ground plane measured by Ooi and He (2007). The\nhypothesis was compared with the hypothesis of Ooi and He (2007), which they called the\nintrinsic bias hypothesis. Models based on each of the two hypotheses described the data\nequally well. Li and Durgin (2012), however, claimed more general usefulness for their\nhypothesis. The current computations show that the models of perspective space, Ooi and\nHe, and Li and Durgin can be regarded as equivalent models for distance perception of\nobjects on the ground plane. The third model was the power-function model for perceived\ndistance proposed by Baird and Wagner (1991) and used in many studies. Differences\nbetween power and hyperbolic functions of the perspective-space model were very small over\nthe entire range of distances in which judgments have been made. It is reasonable to conclude\nthat both functions are equivalent in describing perceived distance. The fourth model was the\nvector-contraction model of visual space (Wagner, 1985). This model was developed to\ndescribe judgments of distances between randomly positioned stakes. Comparison with\nhyperbolic and power functions showed that extending the model to perceived distances\nalong visual directions will give results that are incompatible with all the other models.\nConclusion is that the contraction model of visual space may fit a particular purpose but\ncannot be a generic model of visual space. The fifth model was Foley's model. Foley et al.\n(2004) proposed a model whose principal assumption was that, in the computation\nof perceived extent, the physical angle signal undergoes a magnifying transformation\n(Figure 7(a)).Figure 8 shows that the results of Foley et al.'s (2004) for egocentric distance\nand exocentric extent are described by the perspective-space model, distance and extent\nrequiring different distances of the vanishing point. The models of Foley and perspective\nspace have in common that distances and extents are not described by the same parameters.\nThe perspective-space model is simpler and more generic in that it includes the description of\nperceived angles.\nThe Role of Instructions in Distance and Size Perception\nIn a previous study, I argued that we have representations of both visual and physical space\nat our disposal (Erkelens, 2015a). For example, we see on the one hand that a road narrows\nin front of us but on the other hand we are confident that it does not. The same holds for size.\nWe see that an approaching car becomes larger but at the same time are aware that its size\nstays the same. Our representation of physical space does not result from vision alone but\nalso from other senses and motor interaction with the physical environment. For a yet\nunknown reason, our representations of visual and physical space do not merge into a\nsingle representation. The different representations give human beings the possibility to\nanswer questions about spatial relationships in several ways. The hypothesis deviates from\nthe view of many researchers who assumed that spatial judgments made under different\ninstructions reflect properties of a single space. Famous are the parallel and distance\nalleys, initially measured by Hillebrand (1902) and Blumenfeld (1913). The alleys led to the\nconcept of curved visual space (Luneburg, 1947, 1950). Results were confirmed and extended\nby many studies (Battro, di Pierro Netto, & Rozenstraten, 1976; Hardy, Rand, & Rittler,\nFigure 9. Relationship between perceived and physical distance. The observer at height H above the\nground judges the distance from his feet to an object on the ground plane. Symbols are identical to those used\nin Figure 5(b). Viewing is in the direction of the object (blue) on the ground.\nspace is curved although a few authors challenged its hyperbolic nature. Later studies\nreported conflicting results but persevered in constructing curved visual spaces (Cuijpers,\nKoenderink, van Doorn, Kappers, & Todd, 2002; Koenderink, van Doorn, & Lappin,\nKoenderink, & Kappers, 2001; Wagner, 1985). The concept of a curved visual space\nresults from the integration of parallel and distance alleys in one space. The integration\nmay not be allowed because parallelism and equal size may concern different spaces.\nThe parallel alleys are parallel in visual space, not in physical space. The distance alleys\nare based on the size\u00addistance invariance hypothesis, a mechanism causing that equally\nlarge objects positioned at different distances in physical space (Figure 1(c)) are perceived\nas equally large, although the objects are unequal of size in visual space (Figure 1(d)).\nThus, parallel alleys reflect a special condition in visual space and distance alleys may\nreflect a special condition in physical space.\nCarlson (1960) identified initially three and later four (Carlson, 1962) classes of instruction\nthat affect size judgments considerably. The instructions were called objective, perspective,\napparent, and projective. Effects of instruction were confirmed in other studies (Epstein,\ninstructions cause overestimation of size with distance. Overestimation may reflect\novercompensation of differences between representations of visual and physical space.\nNegative distances of the vanishing point simulate such overestimations in the perspective-\nspace model (Figure 4). Apparent instructions caused underestimation if the instruction was\ngiven first and resulted in almost perfect size estimation if the instruction was given after\njudgments under perspective and objective instructions (Carlson, 1962). The apparent\ninstructions may cause size judgments to occur in representations of either visual or\nphysical space. The projective instruction causes strong underconstancy, where the size\njudgments seem governed by retinal size. Similar judgments occur under reduced cue\nconditions (Thouless, 1931; Holway & Boring, 1941). It may indicate that observers, at\nleast up to a certain extent, have access to their retinal images. Retinal access is associated\nwith a type of visual perception called proximal perception (Todorovic\nperception is controversial already for a long time (Hastorf, 1950; Hochberg & Hochberg,\n1952; Ittelson, 1951) and still is today. Recent studies question proximal perception in laymen\nConclusion\nPerspective space is a simple, intuitive, and powerful model of visual space. It is simple\nbecause a single parameter defines its geometry. It is intuitive because perspective space is\na trade-off between physical space and a two-dimensional projection of physical space\nrepresenting the retinal image. It is powerful because it describes experimental results,\nexplains visual phenomena and unifies a number of models of distance and size perception.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nReferences\nBian, Z., Braunstein, M.

Rearranging the equation gives Equation (1).\nIn Figure 3(b), Equation (1) yields for both the standard and comparison stimulus so that:\nSvs\nSps\n\u00bc VP\nZps\u00feVP\nand Spc\nSvc\n\u00bc Zpc\u00feVP\nVP\n. Multiplication of left and right sides of the equations with each\nother gives: Svs\nSps\nSpc\nSvc\n\u00bc VP\nZps\u00feVP\nZpc\u00feVP\nVP\n\u00bc Zpc\u00feVP\nZps\u00feVP\nor Spc\nSps\n\u00bc Svc\nSvs\nZpc\u00feVP\nZps\u00feVP\n, which equals Equation (3).\nDerivation of Ooi and He's Equation for Fixation of the Object on the Ground\nFigure 9 shows that Zp \u00bc D= cos . Furthermore h \u00bc d cos  and h \u00bc Zv\ncos , from which it\nfollows that Zv \u00bc d cos = cos \nAccording to Equation (1) Zv \u00bc VP\nZp\n, where Zv\n, Zp\n, and VP are distances in the\nviewing direction.\nSubstituting Zp\nand Zv\nin the expressions for d, D, , and  gives d cos \ncos \n\u00bc VP\nD=cos \u00feVP cos \nD\ncos \nor\nd cos  \u00bc VP cos \nD\u00feVP cos \nD.\nThe term VP cos  is the horizontal component of VP. The perceived ground plane is\ndirected to the horizontal component of the vanishing point and, therefore, VP cos  \u00bc\nH= sin .\nSubstituting H= sin  for VP cos  in the equation of d cos  gives d cos  \u00bc DH= sin \nH= sin \u00feD\n.\nFrom this equation it follows that d \u00bc DH= sin \nH cos = sin \u00feD cos \n. The latter equation is identical to\nEquation (7)."
