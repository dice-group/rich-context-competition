Mexico as a\ncountry of origin is also experiencing an obesity epidemic (5). Thus,\nforeign-born, Mexican American children may experience risk\nfactors for obesity in both their origin and destination countries.\nThe existing literature on associations between acculturation,\nweight status, and diet intake mainly focus on adults. Foreign-\nborn Hispanic adults have a lower prevalence of obesity than U.\nS.-born adults (6). Adults' risk of obesity increases with length of\nresidence in the U.S. (6\u00ad10) and obesity risk increases with each\nsubsequent generation (11). When language preference is used as\na proxy for acculturation, immigrant Hispanic women who are\nfluent in English are at a greater risk of being obese than those\nwho are less fluent (12,13). Furthermore, highly acculturated\nHispanic adults reported consuming fewer servings of fruits and\nvegetables compared to less acculturated Hispanics (14).\nAlthough these associations found in adults provide insight\nabout possible associations among adolescents, investigating the\nrelationships among adolescents is important, because they may\nundergo acculturation differently than adults. For example,\nadolescents directly interact with their peers who may influence\ntheir acculturation to the US. They may request desired foods\nand their parents usually accommodate their preferences (15).\nLimited and mixed findings are available about links between\nacculturation and weight status among Hispanic adolescents.\nMultiple review articles (16\u00ad18) have called for more studies on\nthe influence of acculturation on diet among children and\nadolescents. To our knowledge, only four studies have assessed\ninfluences of immigration status and the child's acculturation on\nobesity (19\u00ad22), excluding studies using parental acculturation\nmeasures (23\u00ad25). Higher age- and gender-adjusted prevalence\nof overweight (BMI $ 85th percentile) was reported among\nsecond- and third-generation compared to first-generation\nHispanic adolescents (19), but that study did not adjust for\nSES7, which is known to be lower among immigrants (26).\nAnother study using the same data source but a different weight\nmeasure found that acculturation measures were not related to\nadolescent obesity (i.e., BMI $ 95th percentile) after adjusting\nfor SES and demographic characteristics (20). Both U.S.-born\nand foreign-born boys who resided in the US for .10 y were\nmore likely to be overweight than foreign-born boys with a\nshorter length of residence (21).

Of the studies found, two included a limited number of\nthe nativity of children (21). One large study used height and\nweight reported by parents, which are prone to measurement\nerror (22). Only one study considered the influences of diet and\nphysical activity as mediators of the association between accul-\nturation and weight status (20). Therefore, utilizing a quality\nnationally representative data set with a large sample of foreign-\nborn children, measured weight and height data, and broad range\nof potential confounders and mediating factors relevant to obesity\nmay address the limitations of the past studies.\nOur overall objective was to examine how the acculturation\nprocess, measured by generation status and language use, is\nassociated with both diet and obesity among Mexican American\nadolescents aged 12\u00ad19 y old. We also investigated whether the\nassociation between acculturation and weight status is mediated\nby dietary intake, physical activity, and sedentary behaviors.\nData and Methods\nData were from NHANES, a cross-sectional national health survey with\na complex, stratified, multistage probability sampling design. NHANES\nprovides the nutrition and health status of the U.S. civilian and\nnoninstitutionalized population (27). Data for NHANES are collected\nthrough in-home interviews (e.g., demographics, acculturation mea-\nsures, and health interviews) and a physical examination conducted in\na mobile center (e.g., 24-h dietary interview, height and weight\nicans and obtained multiple measures of acculturation among Hispanic\nparticipants who were 12 y old or older. We restricted our sample to\n75 respondents without any data on physical examination, 46 pregnant\nrespondents, and 36 respondents without height and weight data\n(yielding n = 2286). This sample was used when generation status alone\nwas the measure of acculturation. When using language as the\nacculturation measure, we excluded an additional 68 adolescents with\nmissing values for language (yielding n = 2218). The study was approved\nby the institutional review board at the University of South Carolina.\nMeasures\nAcculturation measures. Immigration represents physical relocation,\nwhereas acculturation represents the degree to which the immigrant\nlearns and adopts certain aspects of the dominant culture and/or retains\nmost or some aspects of their culture of origin after the relocation\n(16,28). Detailed information about adolescents' acculturation level may\nbe difficult to obtain or simply unavailable (18). Therefore, many\nresearchers opt to use one or multiple proxies including the place of\nbirth, age of arrival, and language spoken in the host country.\nUsing information available in NHANES, we assessed acculturation\nin two ways: generation status and language preference. Although the\ntwo measures are correlated, the use of both enabled us check the\nrobustness of the associations of interest and make our findings com-\nparable to the findings from studies using different measures. Gen-\nerational status was determined by respondents' birthplace and their\nparents' birthplace. Respondents were categorized into first generation if\nthe adolescent was not US born and at least one parent was also non-US\nborn; second generation if the adolescent was US born but at least one\nparent was non-US born; and third generation if the adolescent and both\nparents were US born (11,29). Only six U.S.-born adolescents who had\nno information on two parents' nativity were coded in the category of\nsecond generation.\nNHANES used the validated 5-item Short Acculturation Scale for\nHispanics to assess language preferences (17,29,30). Respondents\nindicated their preference for language used to read, think, speak at\nhome, as a child, and with friends, respectively, using a scale from 0 to 4,\nwhere 0 = only Spanish, 1 = more Spanish than English, 2 = both equally,\n3 = more English than Spanish, and 4 = only English. Their responses\nwere summed and further categorized as \"minimal use of English\" if the\ntotal score was #5, \"some use of English\" if the score was between 6 and\n19, and \"only use of English\" if the total score was 20.\nDiet. NHANES collected diet data through a 1-d, 24-h dietary recall\ninterview. Using this information, we first created the 2005 HEI score of\nthe USDA's Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion, which assesses\ndiet quality according to federal dietary guidance (31). The total HEI\nscore ranges from 1 to 100, with a higher score indicating a better quality\nof diet. Second, we assessed dietary intake based on the consumption of\n12 dietary constituents that were used to calculate the total HEI score.\nThese constituents represent all of the major food groups in MyPyramid\n(total fruit, total vegetables, milk, meat, and beans) plus 8 additional\ncomponents (whole fruit, dark green and orange vegetables, grains,\nwhole grains, oils, saturated fat, sodium, and energy from SoFAAS). We\nalso assessed consumption of sweetened beverages. All dietary variables\nrepresented the actual amount of intake except saturated fat, which was\nbased on the percentage of the total daily energy intake from fat. We top-\ncoded responses for intake of sodium, total grains, total energy, and\nservings of sweetened beverages; this affected 2\u00ad10 respondents.\nWeight status. NHANES used digital scales and stadiometers to\nmeasure height and weight for all respondents. BMI was calculated as\nweight divided by the square of height (kg/m2). Using the gender-specific\nBMI-for-age growth charts from the CDC, children whose BMI-for-age\nand -gender was in the 95th percentile or greater were classified as obese\n(32). We also examined age- and gender-specific BMI Z-score as a\ncontinuous measure.\nCovariates. To adjust for potential confounding effects, we considered\nthe following covariates: age, gender, parental education (,12, =12,\n.12 y), health status (excellent, very good, #good), in-school status (in\nwe also considered physical activity and sedentary behaviors as potential\nmediators. A binary variable was created for respondents' self-report of\nparticipation in vigorous leisure time physical activities lasting .10 min\nin the past 30 d. Sedentary behavior, measured by the mean daily hours\nsitting and watching television or using a computer in the past 30 d, was\ndichotomized into ,4 and $4 h/d.\nAnalysis. Statistical analyses were performed with Stata for Mac 10.1\n(StataCorp) using sampling weights that account for the complex\nsampling design and nonresponse. P # 0.05 was accepted as significant.\nChi-square tests were used to assess whether adolescents at different\nlevels of acculturation differ by their categorical socio-demographic\ncharacteristics. We used F-tests to compare continuous measures such as\nrespondents' age, BMI Z-scores, and dietary intake variables by\nacculturation measures.\nLinear regression models were used to examine associations between\nacculturation measures with continuous dietary measures such as HEI\nscore, dietary components (total grains, meats and beans, saturated fat,\nsodium, SoFAAS), and sweetened beverages. For the other seven dietary\ncomponents (total fruit, whole fruit, dark green and orange vegetables,\nwhole grains, total dairy, and oil), a large number of respondents reported\nconsuming zero servings in their 24-h dietary recall. Tobit regression\nmodels were used for these measures to account for censoring at zero\n(33,34). When modeling diet, we ran both crude models with only\nacculturation measures as the independent variables and adjusted models\nthat included age, gender, parental education, total energy intake, poverty\nstatus, self-reported health status, in-school status, and survey years.\nWeight status was modeled in two forms: continuous BMI Z-scores\nand dichotomized obesity status (i.e., BMI $ 95th percentile). We used\nlinear regression models for continuous BMI Z-scores and logistic\nregression model for obesity. We used an incremental modeling strategy\nAcculturation, diet, and body weight 299\njn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nto examine the possible mediating effects of obesity-related behaviors\n(such as diet, physical activity, and sedentary behaviors) (35). Model\n1 adjusted for age, gender, height, and an interaction term between\nheight and age. In model 2, we further adjusted for parental education,\npoverty status, self-reported health, in-school status, and survey year. In\nmodel 3, we added total energy intake, all dietary component variables,\nand sweetened beverage intake. In model 4, we further added respon-\ndent's participation in vigorous leisure time physical activities and\nsedentary behaviors.\nTo further examine how acculturation affects the distribution of the\nBMI Z-score, we used quantile regression models with 10% increments\nof BMI Z-scores and adjusted for all covariates listed above (36,37). Due\nto software limitations, we could not account for the complex survey\ndesign of NHANES in our quantile regression models. Nevertheless,\nthese models shed additional light by highlighting in which part of the\nBMI distribution the impacts most occur (38).\nResults\n29.4% of adolescents were first, second, and third generation,\nrespectively (Table 1). The majority reported using some English\n15.9% using minimal English. The two acculturation measures\nwere correlated, but 13.5% of those first generation and 12.5%\nof those in the third generation reported some use of English. On\naverage, respondents were 15.4 y old; those in the first\ngeneration and those who spoke minimal English were older.\nThere were significantly more boys than girls, particularly in the\nfirst generation and among those who reported minimal use of\nEnglish. Adolescents who were first generation or reported\nminimal use of English were more likely to have parents with less\nthan a high school education, to live in low-income families, to\nreport being in \"good, fair, or poor health,\" and to be out of\nschool. Adolescents in the third generation or who only used\nEnglish were more likely to report participating in vigorous\nphysical activities in the past 30 d. No significant difference in\nscreen time was observed across generational status or the short\nacculturation scale.\nDiet. Compared to first-generation adolescents, both second and\nthird generation children had lower HEI scores, indicating\npoorer dietary quality overall (Table 2). Second and third\ngeneration adolescents consumed significantly less total fruit,\nwhole fruit, total vegetables, dark green vegetables, and meats\nand beans. Intake of whole grains, saturated fat, and sodium\nwere significantly greater for both second and third generation\nGenerational status2 Short acculturation scale3\nCharacteristics All First generation Second generation Third generation P Minimal English Some English Only English P\nGender, %\nParental education, %\nPoverty level, %\nSelf-reported health status, %\nSchooling status, %\nParticipating in vigorous physical activity, %\nDaily television or computer screen time, %\n1 Values are mean 6 SE or percentage.\n2 Generational status: first generation is a non-U.S.\u00adborn individual and non-U.S.\u00adborn parents; second generation is a non-U.S.\u00adborn individual with $1 U.S.-born parent; third\ngeneration is a U.S.-born individual.\n3 Short acculturation scale for Hispanics, responses categorized by use of English to read, think, and speak at home, as a child, and with friends.\njn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nthan first-generation adolescents. The energy intake from\nSoFAAS and the consumption of sweetened beverages were\nhigher for those in the third generation. Similar patterns were\nfound across the short acculturation scale (data not shown).\nTable 3 presents the crude and adjusted coefficients for\ndietary intake variables by generation status. In terms of overall\ndietary quality, after adjusting for covariates, HEI scores were\nlower among those in the second generation (23.2) and third\ngeneration (25.6), respectively, compared to those in the first\ngeneration. Adolescents in the second and third generation had\nlower intake of total fruit, whole fruit, dark green vegetables,\ntotal grains, and meats and beans than those in the first gen-\neration. Adolescents in the second and third generations also had\nhigher intake of whole grains and higher energy coming from\nsaturated fat or SoFAAS than those in the first generation.\nCompared to the first generation, the third generation reported\nlower intake of total vegetables and higher intake of total oil and\nsweetened beverages, which were not shown with the second\ngeneration. The third generation was significantly different from\nthe second generation in total fruit, whole fruit, dark green\nvegetables, sodium intake, SoFAAS, and sweetened beverages.\nOverall, as generation status increased, diet quality declined.\nSimilar patterns but greater differences in the dietary intake were\nobserved when using the acculturation measure based on the\nshort acculturation scales (data not shown).\nWeight status. The second and third generation Mexican\nAmerican adolescents had significantly higher odds of being\nobese than those in the first generation [adjusted OR for second\nthe short acculturation scale, the association between accultur-\nation and obesity was stronger. That is, those who reported some\nuse of English or only used English had ;4 times higher odds of\nbeing obese than those who reported minimal use of English.\nThe OR between the second and third generation were not\nsignificantly different. Socio-demographic, health risk factors,\nand dietary factors mediated the association between accultur-\nation measures and obesity. Adjustment of socio-demographic\nand health factors changed the association most among the third\ngeneration or those who only used English. Additional adjust-\nment of dietary intake led to ;10% change in the point estimate\namong the second generation but not in the third generation and\namong those who used some English or used only English. Further\nadjustment of physical activity and sedentary behaviors did not\nchange the magnitude of the association.\nWith continuous BMI Z-scores as the outcome, adolescents\nin the second generation or those who reported some use of\nEnglish had higher BMI Z-scores than other generational status\n(i.e., first or third generation) or levels of acculturation (i.e.,\nminimal use of English or only use English), respectively (Table\n2). Adolescents in the second generation on average had higher\ngeneration after adjusting for socio-demographic and health risk\nfactors and dietary intake. This difference did not change with\nfurther adjustment of physical activity and sedentary behavior\nvariables. Adolescents in the third generation on average had\nsimilar BMI Z-scores as those in the first generation but lower\nBMI Z-scores than those for the second generation. Similarly,\nthose who reported some use of English had higher BMI Z-\nscores than those who used minimal English or only English in\ntheir life (Table 4).\nResults from quantile regression provided additional infor-\nmation about the effects of acculturation measures on the whole\ndistribution of BMI Z-scores (Fig. 1). Compared to the first\ngeneration, as BMI percentiles increased from the 50th to the\n90th percentiles, the second generation on average had signif-\nicantly higher BMI Z-scores (range: 0.35\u00ad0.46) and the third\nThe change in BMI Z-scores was smaller across the distribution\nin the third generation than that for the second generation. The\nsame findings were observed when we ran the analysis using the\nshort acculturation scale but the differences are smaller compared\nto those observed using generation status (data not shown).\nTABLE 2 Dietary intakes and BMI Z-score among Mexican American adolescents (12\u00ad19 y old) by\nGenerational status\nDietary measures\nWeight measure\n1 Values are mean 6 SE.

Our study demonstrates that higher acculturation is\nassociated with poorer diet and higher weight. These findings\nare consistent with previous studies on weight status among\nPrevious studies have not examined how the entire BMI\ndistribution might differ by acculturation status among adoles-\ncents. We found that those in the second generation or those\nreporting some use of English had higher BMI Z-scores than\nthose in the first and third generations. Higher acculturation has\na large impact at the higher end of BMI percentiles. What makes\nthose with the intermediate level of acculturation status stand\nout? Although we cannot further examine our finding using the\nNHANES cross-sectional data, this might reflect a parental\ncohort effect. That is, those in the second generation or those\nwho reported some use of English might be influenced more by\nthe obesogenic environment in the US or they might adopt an\nunhealthy diet more readily than the third generation or those\nwho speak only English. With a better SES, the highly accultur-\nated adolescents might prefer a thin body type and thus might\npartially prevent excessive weight gain. The relationship with\nBMI Z-score was particularly mediated by socio-demographic\nfactors for both second and third generations and those who\nused only English. Dietary intake mediated the effects of\nacculturation and BMI Z-score among those who used some\nEnglish. Additional analysis restricted to the second generation\nfound that those with foreign-born parents had lower total\nenergy intake (1.78 Mcal/d) than those with U.S.-born parents,\nalthough no other differences in dietary components were\nfound. Thus, detailed information on the gender of the parents,\nthe timing of relocation of the parents, and parental accultur-\nation levels will be useful to better understand higher BMI\namong those adolescents with intermediate levels of accultura-\ntion. Future studies should also investigate possible differential\nmechanisms by levels of acculturation.\nOur study draws strength from examining obesity-related\nrisk behaviors such as diet, physical activity, and sedentary\nbehaviors among immigrant Mexican American adolescents\nTABLE 4 Results from logistic and linear regression models for weight status by acculturation measures among Mexican American\nGeneration Short acculturation scale\nFirst Second Third Minimal English Some English Only English\nLogistic regression model for obesity OR (95% CI) OR (95% CI)\nLinear regression model for BMI Z-score Constant (95% CI) Coefficient (95% CI) Constant (95% CI) Coefficient (95% CI)\n1 Model 1 adjusted for age, height, gender, and age 3 height.\n2 Model 2 further adjusted for parental education, poverty status, self-reported health status, in-school status, and survey years in addition to covariates in model 1.\n3 Model 3 adjusted for total energy intake, all dietary intake variables (i.e., total fruits, whole fruits, total vegetables, dark green vegetables, total grains, whole grains, total dairy,\nmeats and beans, total oil, saturated fat, sodium, SoFAAS, sweetened beverages) in addition to covariates in model 2.\n4 Model 4 adjusted for participation in vigorous physical activity and sedentary behavior in addition to covariates in model 3. \u00a7Different from second generation, P , 0.05; *different\nfrom some use of English, P , 0.05.

We also used measured weight and\nheight data and analyzed weight status both as a categorical and\na continuous variable.\nOur study has several possible limitations. First, because\ndietary practices often have large day-to-day variability, esti-\nmates based on a single 24-h recall are not fully reliable as a\nmeasure of individuals' usual intake. Nevertheless, we found\nlarge differences for diet in our adjusted models. Second, the\nvalidated and commonly used acculturation measures have no\ninformation on food, music, and childrearing preference,\nethnicity of neighborhoods, and cultural heritage and celebra-\ntion. Immigration status itself is a proxy for the acculturation\nprocess. More detailed information related to parental and\nchildren's immigration experiences is needed to better under-\nstand the mechanisms for the association among acculturation,\ndiet, and weight status. These include the timing of arrival,\nmaternal and paternal acculturation experiences, intergenera-\ntional conflict, and family cohesion in parenting. Third, because\nof the cross-sectional design, this study cannot address potential\nparental cohort effects, i.e., parents who arrived during the same\nperiod may share common characteristics. For example, par-\nents of those adolescents in the second or third generations or\nwho speak only English might have come to the US earlier than\nthose in the first generation and those who rarely used English.\nLongitudinal studies are necessary to tease out this relationship.\nAn ideal longitudinal study design might identify Mexican\nparticipants prior to migration (40), allowing baseline assess-\nment of demographics, weight, and lifestyle behaviors and\nfollow them into the US for up to 5\u00ad10 y postmigration, with\nannual data collection on weight and lifestyle, including\nindicators of acculturation. Finally, we recognize that Hispanics\nliving in the US are a heterogeneous group. Our findings should\nnot be directly generalized to other Hispanic immigrant groups,\nalthough adolescents in these groups might experience similar\nchallenges as Mexican American adolescents.\nSuccessful interventions to address obesity in adolescents that\nwould be applicable to Mexican American immigrants are\ndifficult to ascertain. A review of physical activity interventions,\nnot limited to Hispanic youth, concluded that BMI was not\naffected by school-based interventions (41). Our findings on\ndietary intake suggest that dietary behaviors are sensitive to\ncultural changes that occur with migration, indicating that\ndietary interventions may show promise, especially for the\nsecond generation who had high risk of having higher weight\naccording to our study. Adolescent school-based interventions\ntargeting diet and activity report modest success with low-\nincome populations that include Hispanic children (42\u00ad44). Our\nfindings also suggest that policy and programmatic actions\nshould be in place to assist immigrants to protect traditional\ndietary practices such as a high intake of fruit and vegetables and\neating bread while they assimilate to the American culture and\nsociety. Future studies should continue to examine the barriers\nthat Mexican American adolescents encounter in maintaining\ntheir native diet and identify strategies to address those barriers.\nOur findings suggest that Mexican American adolescents in\nthe United States face challenges in terms of poorer diet and\nexcessive weight gain associated with this immigration experi-\nence. The American healthy eating and active living environ-\nments might be more \"obesogenic\" (45,46) than that of the\norigin country. To effectively prevent weight gain among\nMexican American adolescents in this obesogenic environment\nin the US, either changes to that environment or culturally\nappropriate actions to cope with that environment are needed\nfor this population. It is also warranted to identify and\ndifferentiate the cultural resources and structural factors that\nexplain how acculturation affects weight status. Considering the\nwell-established link among poor diet, obesity, and disease, and\nthe increased risk of adverse health outcomes observed in more\nacculturated Hispanics, this work has important implications\nfor the development of culturally and generationally targeted\nnutrition and weight prevention interventions.\n"
