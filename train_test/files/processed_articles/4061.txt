Drawing on an ethnography of\nfashion modeling in Amsterdam, Paris and Warsaw, I argue that objectification is neither\nubiquitous nor one-dimensional: it takes place in specific social contexts and unfolds itself\ndifferently under different social conditions. Moreover, objectification is not unidirectional:\nit is done by and happens to both men and women. By taking an experiential perspective\nwhich involves models' subjective responses to being objectified, I call into question\ntheoretical arguments of objectification pertaining to disempowered subjects, and the\nassumption that objectification is inherently negative or immoral. Instead, I argue that\nobjectification is socially rooted in institutions and specific situations and that this matters\nconsiderably for its varying forms, levels of intensity and the emotional and practical\nresponses it evokes in people. This does not imply that objectification is less compelling\nas a process, or easy to avoid. Objectification might be all the more effective exactly\nbecause the process is embedded in different social contexts, and adapts itself accordingly.\n",

This article unravels\nthis process of objectification by empirically examining a social context in which it\nis almost incessant: fashion modeling. I argue that just as there are many ways in\nwhich people can be used or seen as things, objectification is a multifaceted process,\nexperienced in a wide range of ways. Unlike in early feminist literature, in this\narticle I suggest that objectification is not necessarily a bad thing: models working\nfor Lucy may enjoy their work, may even be proud of being `a coat rack'.\nObjectification has been studied extensively in (social) psychological, socio-\nlogical and feminist studies. In the latter, it is often interpreted as resulting from\nFredrickson and Roberts, 1997) and has frequently been conflated with sexual\nobjectification: women are reduced to sexual instruments to be used or looked at\nby others, predominantly men (Coy, 2009). In early feminist theory, objectification\nwas attacked as harmful and immoral because of its dehumanising effects\nof objectifying experiences as misguided, even as examples of false consciousness.\nFor them, celebratory accounts of being looked at or sexualised are instances of\ninternalised misogyny (Cahill, 2012: x), or caused by consumerist ideology.\nWhile all these studies tend to reduce objectification to a common, generalisable,\nnegative phenomenon, philosopher Ann Cahill argues that rather than seeing them\nas an a priori negative event, detrimental to the self, objectifying experiences are\nbetter understood `as often crucial elements to a flourishing sense of self' (2012: x).\nI follow this line of thought in an empirical analysis of objectification.\nAcknowledging that objectification is an integrated aspect of social interaction\nenables an empirical interrogation of the idea of objectification as `good or bad'.\nI also look at how fashion models subjectively experience objectification\nunpacks the notion of objectification into at least seven distinct forms to explore\nobjectification in situated, institutionalised practice.\nBuilding on Mears's (2011) ethnographic work on the creation and valuation of\n`looks' in fashion modeling, I further argue that modeling is an extreme case, a field\nwhere objectification happens almost continuously. However, there are different\nforms and levels of intensity under different conditions: objectification may entail\nmodels being treated as only a body, unacknowledged as persons; being highly\nreplaceable; or not being seen or heard at all. My analysis shows that, in many\ncases, while being objectified is not an enjoyable experience, it is not fundamentally\nbad, and more `active' forms can be experienced as empowering, potentially pro-\nductive to the self.\nDrawing on an ethnography of fashion modeling in Amsterdam, Paris and\nWarsaw, I demonstrate that objectification is neither ubiquitous nor one-dimen-\nsional, but rather takes place in specific social contexts, unfolding differently under\ndifferent conditions. I argue that instead of being unidirectional, objectification is\ndone by, and happens to, both men and women. At the same time, female models\noften face different kinds of objectification simultaneously and experience it as\nmore challenging. Thus, rather than the practice of objectification, it is the sub-\njective experience of it that is gendered.\nConsidering how being objectified is subjectively experienced leads to a theor-\netical exploration of what it means to be objectified. Although fashion modeling is\noften associated with oppression and victimisation, in society modeling is a high-\nstatus profession and, more importantly, models do not see themselves as victims.\nHere an experiential angle enables a move beyond theoretical discussions about\npower and agency.\nTheories of objectification\nObjectification has been theorised by feminist scholars who have engaged with\ndisplays of, and gazes upon, women in particular (cf. Mulvey, 1975; Rubin,\nCahill's (2012) and Mahmood's (2001) analyses of objectification, subjectivation\nand subjectivity to enable new questions about objectification as a socially situated\npractice. I relate objectification to three issues: first, the subjective experience\nof objectification; second, its genderedness; and third, its multifaceted and\nsituated nature.\nAccording to Cahill, feminist thinkers have paid little attention to objectification\nby means of direct, empirical analysis (2012: 1), often employing the concept with-\nout explicit or detailed articulation of its meanings. In fact, most research and\ntheorising broadly defines objectification as a negative event, emphasising its\nde-humanising effects. For Fredrickson and Roberts, objectification is `the experi-\nence of being treated as a body, valued predominantly for its use to \u00ad or consump-\ntion by \u00ad others' (1997: 174). Similarly, Bartky states that it occurs when `a body is\nseparated from a person, reduced to the status of instrument or commodity, or\nregarded as if it is capable of representing the entire person' (1990, cited in\nargue that instrumentalisation undermines individuals' ability to decide what is\nvaluable and to find ways to realise and promote this value, leading to the reduc-\ntion of individuals to the status of things without autonomy or subjectivity, that\nexist solely to be used, and possibly violated and abused, by others. This denial\nand Mears, 2011). Other accounts, usually from (social) psychology, repeatedly\ndemonstrate how objectification has negative psychological outcomes, including,\nbut not limited to, disordered eating and low self-esteem (Noll and Fredrickson,\nhave found people finding pleasure in being objectified, as, for example, when\nit occurs in appreciative or sexually arousing ways (such as Strossen, 1995;\nMuch of this work makes a strong case for objectification as disempowering and\nhighly unfavourable. However, from Cahill's perspective, being perceived and trea-\nted as an object is inevitable, precisely because the human self is embodied. Our\nsubjectivity is material: we are body-subjects and -objects. Feona Attwood notes\nthat the exposure of the body \u00ad male and female \u00ad has become so central to forms\nof popular representation and individual self-expression (2010: 2) that presenting\noneself as an object, and being perceived as one, has become inescapable. Cahill\nalso argues that the experience of being an object, a bodily being whose material\nappearance arouses the (for example sexual) interest of another, is potentially\nenhancing to one's sense of self (2012: x). Building on these, this article considers\nthe possibility that being (seen as) an aesthetic object with aesthetic meaning might\ncontribute to feelings of self-worth, legitimacy and "
