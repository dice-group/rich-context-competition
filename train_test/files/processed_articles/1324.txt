We\nexamined maternal smoking in a cohort study for which data from 3\ngenerations were available to examine maternal characteristics and\nexposures from a life-course perspective.\nMethods: We had data from 3 generations: women enrolled in the\nat the Baltimore site (G1); daughters (G2) of those G1 mothers who\nwere followed to ages 27\u00ad33 years in the Pathways to Adulthood\nstudy; and children (G3) born to the G2 women who provided\npregnancy and birth information during the Pathways study. These\ndata allowed examination of exposures that occurred to the mother\nduring her childhood and in utero.\nResults: We found evidence of a 3-way interaction effect on birth\nweight for maternal smoking in pregnancy, maternal exposure to\nsmoking in utero (grandmaternal smoking), and maternal parity.\nMaternal smoking reduced birth weight in 3 of the subgroups, with\nthe size of the effect on birth weight moderated by parity and the\nmother's own in utero exposure to smoking.\nConclusions: A mother's prenatal exposure to smoke may affect the\nbirth weight of her offspring. This effect would be consistent with both\nthe accumulation-of-risk and the fetal-programming hypotheses.\nMaternal smoking is associated with reduced birth\nweight across a wide range of populations,1\u00ad10 often\nreported interactions between maternal smoking and other\nmaternal characteristics and exposures.

These data allow us to examine exposures that\noccurred to the mother during her childhood and even in utero.\nWe present here the results of analyses examining the effect of\nmaternal smoking on birth weight, with exploration of interac-\ntions with other maternal factors including in utero exposures to\nthe mother.\nMETHODS\nData from 2 large longitudinal cohort studies were\ncombined to create the intergenerational dataset for the\npresent study. The Johns Hopkins Institutional Review Board\napproved our use of these data. The Collaborative Perinatal\nProject was a multicenter prospective study designed to\nidentify risk factors for adverse perinatal and pediatric out-\nand their offspring were followed to 8 years of age.19 From\nlaunched a follow-up study of the original Baltimore-based\nstudy participants and their children.

Finally, 247\nfamilies were excluded randomly to cut costs. These exclu-\ncomplete G1 and G2 interviews.\nWe then necessarily excluded G2 women with no\nensure that the information obtained regarding G2's birth and\nchildhood was as accurate as possible, we excluded those\nfamilies whose G1 interview was completed by someone\nother than the biologic mother (n  29). G2s who were twins\nand G2s of \"other\" races were also excluded. After our\nG2 women at their interview at age 27 to 33 years. We excluded\n60 children with abnormalities at birth, 34 children with missing\nbirth weights, 1 child whose birth weight was reported to have\nchildren for analysis. Some G1 women had more than 1 preg-\nnancy in the original study, and some G2 women had more than\n1 child at the time of their interview. This resulted in noninde-\npendent observations on 2 levels: G2s with the same mother and\nG3s with the same mother or grandmother. Dealing with this\nmultiple clustering is not entirely straightforward using standard\nsoftware. Therefore, we selected only the eldest female G2 in\neach sibship and used Generalized Estimating Equations applied\nto ordinary least squares regression to deal with G3 offspring\nFinally, we excluded 18 infants whose G2 mothers re-\nported having diabetes. Diabetes is associated with higher birth\nweights but not necessarily healthy perinatal outcomes. The final\nVariable Definition and Construction\nBirth weight of the G3 infant was reported in pounds\nand ounces by the mother (G2) at the time of the interview.\nAlthough the length of the recall period varied, studies have\nshown that mother's recall of infant birth weight is reason-\nably accurate.22,23 Mothers were not asked to provide gesta-\ntional age for the G3s, precluding the study of intrauterine\ngrowth restriction and preterm birth.\nG2 variables for the index pregnancy included mother's\nrace (black, white), adult height (inches), age at G3 birth (years),\neducation at G3 birth (some college vs. not), parity before G3\nbirth (nulliparous, parous), and smoking during G3 pregnancy\n(yes, no). Age was modeled as a linear and quadratic term. A\ncomplete smoking history was obtained, including information\non the dates when women began and ended periods of smoking.\nThe unit of time was quarters of a year (eg, January through\nMarch). We noted the smoking status of G2 participants during\nthe quarter-years during which the mother was pregnant with\nG3, and categorized the mothers into those who had never\nsmoked, those who quit before the G3 index pregnancy, those\nwho smoked during part of the index pregnancy, and those who\nsmoked during the entire index pregnancy. Preliminary analysis\nindicated that the relevant categories were those who smoked at\nall during the pregnancy and those who did not. The smokers\nwere therefore combined for final analysis. An advantage of our\ndata was the ability to link data on the childhood and prenatal (in\nutero) exposures of the mother. We included G2's own birth\nweight and whether or not the G2 mother had been small for her\ngestational age (intrauterine growth restriction IUGR). These\ndata were available from medical records abstracted for the\noriginal study. IUGR was categorized as a dichotomous variable\nbased on a 10th percentile cut-off of birth weight for gesta-\ntional age using a U.S. standard growth chart.24 Childhood\nexposures include the receipt of welfare in G2's household at\nbirth or age 7 years and whether G2 was ever hospitalized\nbetween birth and age 8 years. Several variables were avail-\nable for G1 (the mother of G2 and the grandmother of G3):\nheight (inches), prepregnancy body mass index (BMI, kg/\nm2), education at G2's birth (at least high school diploma\nversus not), poverty ratio at G2's birth (a ratio of household\nneeds to income, with values below 1 indicating poverty and\nunmet needs), history of sexually transmitted diseases (yes or\nno), and smoking during G2 pregnancy (yes or no). The\ncorrelation in the original study of self-reported smoking\nstatus with biomarkers has been well documented.25\nStatistical Methods\nWe assessed differences in birth weight (grams) by\ncomputing the difference in mean birth weight and the ac-\ncompanying t test statistics. To adjust for G3s who were\nrelated, we applied GEE to ordinary least squares regression\nand adjusted the variance estimates for clustering by comput-\ning robust standard errors.20,21 To determine the significance\nof the interaction terms, we relied on 2 tests of model fit,\nrather than t test statistics for the coefficients, since the\nstandard errors of the latter are subject to substantial col-\nlinearity when all possible interactions involving some vari-\nables are added to the model.\nRESULTS\nThe mean birth weight for the G3 children in our\nsample was 3175 gm. Table 1 presents the frequency of the\nvarious descriptive characteristics of G1, G2, and G3 indi-\nviduals for the entire G3 sample and for G3s exposed to\nmaternal smoking compared with those who were not. As\nexpected, the mean birth weight for G3s born to smoking\nmothers was 132 g lower than for those born to nonsmoking\nvariables included in Table 1 made only a small difference.\nWe were interested a priori in 3 potential effect modifiers:\nmaternal age at G3 birth, parity at G3 birth, and G1 smoking\nin G2 pregnancy (in utero exposure of the index child's\nmother).

We did, however, find a significant interaction of parity\n(Table 2); among nulliparous women the G3 infants born to\nsmoking mothers were just 38 g lighter than their nonsmok-\ning counterparts while the G3s born to multiparous smoking\nmothers were 250 gm lighter. We also found interaction of\ngrandmother's (G1's) smoking. Maternal smoking had little\neffect (21 gm) if the mother had been unexposed in utero (ie,\nif G1 did not smoke while pregnant with G2), but a large\neffect (284g) if G1 had smoked during G2's gestation.\nWe then looked for a possible 3-way interaction among\nmaternal smoking, parity, and grandmaternal smoking. On\nthe basis of 2 analyses, including the 3-way interaction\nimproved the fit of the model (P  0.05 for addition of the\n3-way interaction to the model with the main effects and both\n2-way interactions).\nTable 2 presents the crude and adjusted models with the\neffect of maternal smoking on G3 birth weight stratified into\n4 groups: nulliparous G2 mothers where G1 did not smoke;\nparous G2 mothers where G1 did not smoke; nulliparous G2\nmothers where G1 smoked; parous G2 mothers where G1\nsmoked. As indicated in the table footnotes, results were\nadjusted for several covariates, including G2's own birth\nweight. Because there was little difference between adjust-\nment for G2 birth weight and G2 IUGR, we chose to include\nG2 birth weight (which probably has less measurement er-\nror). Maternal smoking had essentially no effect on birth\nweight for infants born to G2 women who were nulliparous\nand were unexposed to smoking in utero. However, maternal\nsmoking had a negative effect on the other 3 groups, with the\nsize of the birth weight effect moderated by parity and\ngrandmother's smoking. The strongest effect was in the\ngroup of parous women exposed to smoking in utero, for\nwhom the G3 birth weight was reduced by more than 400 gm.\nDISCUSSION\nMaternal smoking during pregnancy is strongly linked to\nreduced birth weight and impaired fetal growth.1\u00ad10 However,\nonly a small number of studies have examined the possibility\nthat the effects of maternal smoking depend on the underlying\ncharacteristics of the population. The adverse effect of maternal\nsmoking on birth weight and fetal growth appears to be stronger\ning outcomes for nearly half a million births, Cnattingius and\ncolleagues18 reported that the effect of smoking on the risk of\nlow birth weight increased with both age and parity. Our results\nare consistent with the parity interaction observed by Cnattin-\nTABLE 2.

We had\ndata on the mother's in utero exposure as well as her birth\nweight and IUGR status. We included maternal birth weight\n(Table 2) in our final models and also maternal IUGR (results\nnot shown) but these variables failed to account for the effects\nof G2's in utero exposure to smoking. We also adjusted for\nother variables (mother's adult height, childhood hospitaliza-\ntions) that might capture ways in which this very early\nexposure to smoking might have adversely affected the\nmother and thus explain the effects on her offspring, but the\neffects persisted. In utero smoking exposure appears to have\nan effect on a woman's offspring that is independent of its\neffect on her own health in infancy and childhood, thereby\nsupporting the notion of \"fetal programming.\"\nEffects of exposures across the life course have also\nbeen proposed to influence later outcomes through an \"accu-\nmulation of risk.\"27,29 In utero smoking exposure may add to\nthe cumulative effect of smoking exposure the mother expe-\nriences before and during pregnancy. Although these 2 path-\nways are not mutually exclusive, one pathway may predom-\ninate with regard to a particular exposure or outcome. Both\nthe \"accumulation of risk\" and \"fetal programming\" models\nare consistent with our finding of larger effects of maternal\nsmoking on birth weight among women who were themselves\nexposed in utero to smoking.\nThe finding of increased birth weight in offspring of\nnonsmoking mothers who were themselves prenatally ex-\nposed to smoke is more puzzling. There may be residual\nconfounding. For example, although smoking in present-day\ncohorts is associated with decreased socioeconomic status,\nsmoking by women in the 1960s may have been associated\nwith higher socioeconomic status. Therefore, G1s who\nsmoked may have been better off in unmeasured ways than\nG1s who did not smoke, and thus transferred these advan-\ntages to their G2 offspring. Such a difference could poten-\ntially explain the apparently beneficial effects of G1 smoking\non G3 birth weight among the nonsmoking G2s.\nFinally, our findings of no adverse effect of maternal\nsmoking for the subgroup of nulliparas unexposed in utero\nmust be addressed. With the exception of recent work by\nCnattingius and a few others discussed above, little has been\ndone to identify subgroups who may experience differential\nvulnerability to the effect of smoking. Furthermore, few\nstudies have data on the mother's in utero exposure to\nsmoking. Our findings must therefore be interpreted cau-\ntiously. Selection bias due to attrition and exclusions may\ncontribute to the results, although some of the attrition was\nrandom. The exclusions were primarily related to G2 sex and\nbirth order, factors that are unlikely to be associated with\neffects of smoking and parity on G3 birth weight.\n"
