Their papers provide insightful perspectives and different critical engagements with\nmy recent piece for this journal. Their reflections force me to revisit my central argument that the impact agenda\nunveiled in the United Kingdom's new Research Excellence Framework (REF) need not be the negative\ndevelopment for political theorists that many fear \u00ad and perhaps even that it should be embraced.\nKeywords: Research Excellence Framework REF; impact; political theory\nBefore I respond to the criticisms of Andrew Vincent, James Alexander and John Dunn,\nit is necessary to clarify misconceptions about the REF's understanding of impact. The\nResearch Excellence Framework (REF) is an assessment of research quality of academic\ndepartments (as `units of assessment') across three indicators. The first is the quality of\nresearch outputs, such as monographs and journal articles. The second is the quality of\nthe research environment taking into account research activities such as external speaker\nseminars, postgraduate students and research funding. These indicators count for 65 and\n15 per cent, respectively, of an academic subject's final score.\nThe newest indicator is the impact of research beyond academia, which counts for\n20 per cent of the final score. So the first myth we must dispel is that the REF is\nmostly about impact \u00ad to be clear, it is not. Impact has attracted much attention,\nperhaps because of its novelty coupled with the relatively brief period between its first\nannouncement in 2008 for use in a REF assessment that had already started. There was\nunderstandable concern about whether this measure could be assessed reliably. Never-\ntheless, impact is only one of several factors assessing research quality; to argue that\nimpact is the main driver for research quality is to overlook the role it plays in the\noverall assessment.\nA second myth is that the inclusion of impact as an indicator of research quality in the\nREF requires that all research-active academics demonstrate impact in their work. This\nis manifestly untrue. Impact is assessed through narrative case studies describing impact\nsubmit roughly one impact case study for every ten full-time academic staff included in\nthe assessment (REF 2011; 2012). While departments had an interest in securing a\nnumber of high-quality impact case studies, there is no requirement or need to submit\nan impact case study for every member of staff.\nA third myth is that impact is assessed only by non-academics. This is also untrue.\nImpact might be about the impact of research beyond academia, but its assessment is not\nplaced entirely beyond the hands of academics. The impact case studies are scored by\nmembers of the relevant assessment panel. The group judging impact in Politics includes\nbs_bs_banner\n\u00a9 2015 The Author. Political Studies Review \u00a9 2015 Political Studies Association\nsome of the leading political scientists \u00ad and political theorists \u00ad in Britain, including\nRichard Bellamy, Chris Brown, Iain McLean and Judith Squires. The Politics and\nInternational Studies REF Panel does include a few non-academics from organisations\nsuch as the House of Commons and the Institute for Public Policy Research. However,\nthe seven panel members from non-academic institutions are well outnumbered by the\n22 that are academics.\nExposing these myths is important because it clarifies misconceptions about the use\nof impact in the REF. Alexander discusses impact `as measured by various govern-\nexamine the relation of theory and practice where we should `recognise that the\npossibility of adopting a political or a philosophical ground is always open' (Alexander,\n2015, p. 492). Alexander is simply wrong to believe impact is determined by gov-\nernment and related organisations. Yes, government has supported its introduction, but\nacademics have developed how it was measured and led its assessment. Perhaps\nAlexander thinks this was a poor decision and much can be debated about that.\nNonetheless, I suspect his concern about the inability of impact to capture certain\npolitical or philosophical possibilities rests on his mistaken belief that ministers and not\nacademics \u00ad and especially not political theorists or philosophers \u00ad will lead on\nassessing impact. So if his fellow theorists and philosophers are unconvinced by his\narguments, Alexander cannot blame non-theorists for how impact is understood. Much\nof his critique rests on a mistake about how impact is assessed.\nDunn is critical of political theorists who aim `to affect the world for the better' for they\nrun a risk of `professional impropriety or self-deception' (Dunn, 2015, p. 497). But this\nrests on his acceptance of the myth that political theorists `measure the value of their own\nwork by a metric devised by public officials' or `Treasury officials' (Dunn, 2015, pp. 496\nand 498). It was not politicians who designed how impact could be scored, but academics.\nMoreover, Dunn understands `impact' purely in terms of affecting political decisions. This\nis a mistake: impact is about influencing non-academic users, including (but not exclu-\nsively) public policy makers. Even if his critique is correct, it is a partial victory at best.\nVincent argues that the use of impact creates `the \"Celebrity Come Dancing\" genera-\ntion of academics, rushing into TV studios or other assorted external media outlets, for\ntheir REF impact narrative' (Vincent, 2015, p. 481). This mistakes media engagement with\nimpact: having an active, visible media presence is good public engagement, but does not\nconstitute `impact' for REF purposes unless there is some identifiable change in relation to\nnon-academic users of 2* or better graded research. If impact should be rejected because\nit is thought to be nothing more than speaking to the media, then Vincent need not worry\nbecause this is not included as `impact' in the REF. He cites a passage by Martha Nussbaum\nin a 2010 book to claim REF impact `means above all economic impact' (Vincent, 2015,\np. 482). This was an understandable concern five years ago, but the REF panels' assessment\nof research impact should now help put such concerns to rest.\nThe discussion thus far is not a defence of the use of impact in the REF assessment.\nInstead, I seek only to highlight some common myths about what this impact is. It is\nimportant to expose certain views as mythical fictions to help us separate criticisms aimed\nat the target from those addressing concerns or issues that are based on mistakes. Each\n\u00a9 2015 The Author. Political Studies Review \u00a9 2015 Political Studies Association\nof the authors in this symposium focuses at least some part of their discussion on\nconcerns that do not exist \u00ad or at least not in the form identified. My argument\nis not that this renders their critiques irrelevant, but rather I want now to turn our\nattention to some of their criticisms aimed at the use of impact and not myths about\nits use.\nReplies to Critics\nVincent (2015) raises two issues worth considering further. The first is that not all\nimpact is positive. I raised the concern that many may view the impact of political\ntheory with suspicion given that so many in the canon opposed democracy and political\nnot a good in itself. However, impact for REF purposes has a specific meaning: is the\npotential impact linked to 2* or better quality research? I suspect many possible\ncounter-examples of essays that have contributed to negative consequences would not\nmeet this test. Nonetheless, I have no doubt we can find illustrations of research that\ncontributed to negative impacts, but recall that impact is one of several indicators of a\ndepartment's overall research quality where the greatest weighting is afforded to pub-\nlications. We should be concerned about the kinds of impact that research can have,\nbut it is best judged by panels led by academics with less importance than the quality\nof publications.\nA second issue Vincent raises is that research should not be market-led. However, it\nis unclear how the higher education system is market-led because of REF impact. It is too\nearly to tell if students choose universities because of a department's impact score in the\nrecent REF. This is also highly unlikely. Perhaps doctoral students will give extra weight\nto a department's REF score, but it is difficult to imagine `impact' scores outweighing the\nimportance of the department's overall score (or that many students will consider and\ncompare the different scores departments receive on `impact'). This is not to disagree\nwith him that marketisation of higher education is taking root and problematic in\nimportant respects. However, it is also worth noting context. Almost every Member of\nParliament I have spoken to tells me they do not know exactly why impact was missing\nin earlier assessments as a means of assessing `value for money'. Future prophesies are\nhostages to fortune, but it is a fairly safe bet that `impact' will remain in further REF\nexercises for the foreseeable future.\nI have already noted how Alexander's central concern about impact rests on a mistake\nabout how it is assessed.1 I now address two connected issues that relate more directly to\nmy original article for this journal. The first issue is Alexander's worry that my `argument'\nthat `theorists ought to welcome the requirement their \"research\" should have \"impact\" '\nis a problem because `if taken seriously, [it] would, I think, lead to the death of political\ntheory in all but one possible sense' (Alexander, 2015, p. 485). Alexander again rests\nhis concern on a mistake. I do not argue that all political theory research `should'\nhave impact or that theorists ought to `imitate' those that do. My actual argument is\nmore modest: impact is something that `political theory may \u00ad and often does \u00ad\npossess' (Brooks, 2013, p. 209). Not all research in this area may have impact nor\nshould it be required to have it to be valuable. Remember that impact is only one of\n\u00a9 2015 The Author. Political Studies Review \u00a9 2015 Political Studies Association\nseveral factors in an overall assessment of research quality where outputs will continue to\nreign. It is an error to think that all of a subfield might die off because of some\nrequirement it simply does not have. Nor do I argue anywhere that this should not\nThe second, related issue is Alexander's further mischaracterisation of me and `the\nstandard position of political philosophers and theorists today' as endorsing the view that\npolitical theory can and should be `untainted by practice', as theorists develop their lofty\nAlexander appears to overlook the significant rise of non-ideal theory that is increasingly\na part of any `standard' discussion in the mainstream literature. And second, Alexander's\ncharacterisation of political theory may be at odds with how most might think about the\nsubject as theories about the political, and thus related to our practices and institutions.\nThere are then reasons to reject Alexander's characterisation.\nCuriously, Alexander is critical of the view of the political theorist constructing\ntheories separately from worldly concerns while later embracing what he calls the\n`phlegmatic' relation of theory and practice where he `lets the world go to the dogs\nwith equanimity and simply writes philosophy where he can' (Alexander, 2015, p.\n491). This suggests not that political theory must lack practical relevance, but rather\nthat Alexander does not attribute too much importance or value to it. This is an issue\nworth considering, but it seems to rest on a further mistake. In another accusation\ntowards me, he says that the `sanguine' relation of theory to practice `supposes that\ntheories can be framed like policies for implementation' (Alexander, 2015, p. 491) \u00ad\nand among such theorists he includes myself. But this is nonsense. A theory is not a\npolicy, as anyone who works in public policy-making can attest. I may have a theory\nof citizenship and political justice; these may guide or inform policies relating to them\nlike citizenship tests and language requirements, but they do not serve as the policies\nthemselves. My conclusion here is that Alexander's interesting distinctions and state-\nments reveal more about his individual concerns about theorists and the possibility of\ntheir practical relevance than the actual use of impact in British higher education or\nhow theory does, in fact, relate to practice.\nDunn rejects the pursuit of creating impact by political theorists focusing exclusively\non their potential influence on politicians. He is dismissive of the `bewildering indiscre-\ntion of the leadership' in the UK and elsewhere, doubting that they have coped\n`reasonably successfully over the last few decades with their responsibilities to most of\ntheir own citizens' (Dunn, 2015, p. 495). Such sweeping statements are offered as\nobviously true, which I would dispute.\nDunn says that `a lecture room is not a church' and that `[m]ost useful educational\nadvice must either be broadly exemplary or highly contextual and very specific'\n(Dunn, 2015, p. 497). A political theorist might not be a preacher, but this does lead\nto the conclusion that there is nothing for political theorists to contribute for revising\nexisting public policy or developing new policy. Perhaps Dunn is correct that theorists\nmove at a very different speed and perspective than the policy making world he finds\nso poorly run. But this is no argument against trying `to do less badly' and it is unclear\nhe would disagree about this point. Dunn is either mistaken or overlooks how impact\n\u00a9 2015 The Author. Political Studies Review \u00a9 2015 Political Studies Association\nis assessed, and what it measures. However, there is much else of good sense about the\ndistinctive kind of projects that many political theorists \u00ad and especially historians of\npolitical thought \u00ad engage in that I readily accept in his well-presented and thought-\nprovoking piece.\nConclusion\nMy article `In Defence of Political Theory: Impact and Opportunities' was meant to\ncontribute to a debate about whether the UK's impact agenda sounds the death knell for\nthe subfield. I argued that we, as political theorists, should welcome the use of impact\nand many of us have been creating it for some time. Perhaps I should reconsider my\nclaim that `the primary obstacle for political theorists is overcoming scepticism about\nthe kind of impact theorists may offer', which I directed at non-theorists (Brooks,\n2013, p. 209). The essays in this symposium make clear that impact continues to be\ngreeted with suspicion and some degree of alarm. I hope this reply to critics highlights\nthat many of these suspicions focus on myths about what impact is and how it is\nassessed that are unsupported by the reality. My point is not that there is nothing to\ncriticise in the REF and its use of impact (there is), but to argue a case rarely\nconsidered: that impact is not bad news for political theorists. While the essays here are\nuseful in raising important issues, I am unpersuaded to change my conviction. At least\nfor now.\nMany of the problems raised about impact relate to myths and other misunderstandings\nabout what it is. Political theorists have a talent for conceptual analysis and grasp the finer\ndetails about how ideas of freedom or justice take different meanings from the perspec-\ntives of different philosophers. Cicero, Hobbes and Fuller may each appeal to natural law,\nbut each does so in different ways and generates different meanings. Likewise, the\nconcept of REF impact refers to a specific practice that is not the same as more everyday\nunderstandings of impact. Once we become clearer about what REF impact is, I believe\nwe find that many of the objections and concerns miss their targets and it is less\nobjectionable than often thought. This is not to claim that REF impact is unproblematic\n\u00ad this is certainly not my view \u00ad but rather it does not warrant the worry many have and\nis not bad news for political theorists more generally.\nNotes\n1 Alexander makes other mistakes as well, such as attributing statements to me that I have nowhere said in lectures or writing\n2 In fact, much of my early interest in political theory and philosophy arose out of purely academic curiosity without any regard\nfor \u00ad if I may once more use the stale language found in REF documentation \u00ad potential impact on non-academic users.\nReferences\nBrooks, T.
