Introduction\nThe rationale behind the Minimum Wage (MW) policy is to increase the wage level for low-income group re-\nX. Ma\nduce their poverty level and narrow income inequality between high- and low-wage groups. Thus, the MW im-\nplementation is an important labor policy in both developing and developed countries.\nIn China, income inequality increased during the economic transition period. Along with marketization\nreform progress, the Chinese government also implemented the MW policy. This policy addressed \"market fail-\nure\" caused by firms that set lower than equilibrium wages. MW was first promulgated as a law--Enterprise's\nMinimum Wage Regulations--in 1993. The MW level is mainly determined by the regional government. In\n2004, the government published a new MW regulation to enforce the implementation of MW policy in whole of\nChina; therefore, there was a large increase in MW level since 2004.\nIn addition, although the labor market is reformed by Chinese government since 1978, it is pointed out that\nthe wage determine systems are different between the public sector and the private sector; there exits wage gap\nbetween these two sectors even if worker's human capital factors are consistent (Chen, Demurger, & Fournier,\nThere are some empirical studies on the effects of MW on employment, wage gaps, and income inequality for\ndeveloped countries, but hardly any empirical studies to understand the effects of MW on wage distribution in\nChina. Particularly, there is no empirical study on the comparison between the public sector and the private sec-\ntor. In this study, we provide numerical evidence to these issues.\nConcretely, this study attempts to answer the following questions through an empirical analysis using micro-\ndata from Chinese Household Income Project survey (CHIPs). First, does the MW affect wage levels? Second, if\nit does, is the effect of MW on wage different by wage distribution? Third, is the MW effect on wage different\nfor the public and the private sector? Fourth, does MW affect wage gaps between the public and private sectors?\nConsidering that the MW primarily affects low-income groups, we employ different models to conduct an anal-\nysis on both average wage and different wage percentiles.\n2. Literature Review\nCunningham and Siga (2006), Hohberg and Lay (2015) utilized OLS (ordinary least squares) and QR (quantile\nregression) models to analyze the effects of MW on average wage and different percentile wage groups based on\nthe cross section data and time-series data1.\nConsidering empirical studies on the issue for China, Jia Peng and Zhang Shiwei (2013) utilized the Neumark,\nSchweitzer, Wascher (2004) model (which is names as Neumark, et al. 2004) to analyze the MW effect through-\nout wage distribution in China using 1997-2009 CHNS (Chinese Health and Nutrition Survey) survey data.\nThey found that the MW effect increase can reach to 1.00 - 1.25 times of the MW level on wage distributions.\nDi Junpeng and Han Qing (2015) utilized OLS (Ordinary Least Squares), QR (Quantile Regression) and DID\n(Difference in Difference) models to analyze the effect of MW on urban residents income using 1996-2010\nCHNS, and revealed that when the MW level increases per 1%, the average wage will increase by 0.6%, and the\naffect mainly concentrates in the low-income group. Moreover, they pointed out that the MW specially provide\nprotection for the elderly and low-skill workers based on the results by the DID method analysis. Ma Shuang,\nZhang Jie, & Zhu Xi (2012) utilized Chinese manufacturing firm-level data and city-level MW from 1997 to\n2007 to analyze the effect of MW on the average wage in firms by OLS, and found that if the MW increase by\n10%, the average wages in firms would pick up by 0.4% - 0.5%.\nThe main contributions of this study are as follows: First, considering the MW compliance problem in China,\nriod (2007-2013). This shows the disparities of MW effects on wage distribution, which is perhaps caused by the\ngovernment's enforcement behaviors. Second, considering that the wage determinants system and the MW pol-\nicy compliance situations are different for the public and private sectors and that the proportions of low-wage\ngroups may be different for these two sectors, the effect of MW on wage distribution might differ for the public\nand private sectors. Using the subsamples, the comparison between these two sectors is also employed in this\nstudy.\n1The analysis method based on panel data, please see Neumark, Schweitzer and Wascher (2004), Neumark, Cunningham and Siga (2006),\nX. Ma\n3. Methodology and Data\n1) The model for MW Effects on average wage\nThe OLS model for MW effects on average wage is represented with the Equation (1.1).\nln ln\nijt t jt ijt ijt\nW a MW X\n  \n=\nIn the Equation (1.1), i represents individual workers, t represents periods and j represents regions. lnW is\nthe logarithmic value of wage, ln MW is the logarithmic value of the MW maximum value, X is other va-\nriables affecting wages (such as education and work experience year as a proxy for human capital, male, occu-\npation, industry dummy, public sector dummy, and year dummy), a is a constant,  is an error term and\n ,\n represent the estimated coefficient of variables. The coefficients of ln MW (\n ) show the effect of MW\non average wage. If\n is statistically significant, it indicates that the implementation of MW affects average\nwage.\nComparing the difference between the public and private sectors in terms of the MW effect, public sector\ndummy is utilized in the OLS model, it is represented with the Equation (1.2). In the Equation (1.2), Pub\nrepresents public sector dummy, ln MW Pub\n is the interaction term-- ln MW and .\nPub If\n is a nega-\ntive value, and it is statistically significant, it indicates that the MW effect on average wage is greater for the\nprivate sector than for the public sector and vice versa.\nln ln ln *\nijt t jt ijt ijt\nW a MW Pub MW Pub X v\n   \n=\n2) The model for MW effects on wage distribution\nTo see the effects of the MW by wage distribution, we adopt the Quantile Regression model (Koenker & Ba-\n( ) ( ) ( )\nmin ln 1 ln\nij ij o ij ij\nij ij ij ij\nh W H h W H\n \n     \n <\n \n- + - -\n \n \n \n( )\n\n \nIn Equation (2), i represents individual workers, and  represents percentile of wages (1 percentile is ex-\npressed as 1st). The equation's other variables are the same as those of Equation (1). ( )\n.\n\n is a check (or indi-\ncator) function. H indicates ln MW , the public sector dummy Pub , the interaction term of ln MW and Pub ,\nand X presented in Equation (1.1) and (1.2).\nThe QR model is designed for estimation using the optimal method, which minimizes the two error terms.\nThe coefficients of ln MW ( ( )\n  ) show the MW effect on wage by the wage distributions. If ( )\n  is sta-\ntistically significant, it indicates that the implementation of MW policy affects wage distribution. The coeffi-\ncients of interaction terms-- ( )\nln MW  and Pub , are also utilized to compare the MW effects on wage distri-\nbution between the public and private sectors.\n3) The model for MW effects on wage gaps between the public and private sectors\nBased on wage functions by OLS, the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition model (Oaxaca, 1973; Blinder, 1973)\ncan be derived as equations (3.1), (3.2).\n( ) ( )\nln ln\npub pri pub pri pub pri pub pri\n  \n( ) ( )\nln ln\npub pri pri pub pri pub pri pub\n  \nIn equations (3.1), (3.2), pub represents public sector, pri represents private sector, lnW is the loga-\nrithm of the average wage, X is the average values of variables, and\npub\n and\npri\n represent the estimated\ncoefficients resulting from the wage functions of the public and private sectors, respectively.\n( )\npub pri pub\nX X \n- and ( )\npri pub pri\nX X \n- represent the wage gap resulting from a difference between the\npublic and private sectors in the individual characteristics factors--including human capital (e.g. education, ex-\nperience years, occupation and industry), the MW level and regional distribution, ( )\npri pub pri\nX  \n- and\n( )\npub pri pub\nX  \n- represent the wage gap caused by the unexplained differentials, including different wage\nsystem and discriminations.\nX. Ma\nthe four surveys of the CHIPs (Chinese Household Income Project Survey) conducted by NBS (National Bureau\nof Statistics), Institute of Economic, CASS (Chinese Academy of Social Science) and Beijing Normal Universi-\ndents.\nUsing retrospective survey data of income in CHIPs 1995 and CHIPs 2002, and the survey data in CHIPs\nthe 2007-2013 period. Because there are design similarities of the data in the questionnaire, we can use the same\nCHIP surveys cover the representative regions in China, including Beijing, Shanxi, Liaoning, Jiangsu, Anhui,\nGuangdong, Henan, Hubei, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Gansu in 1995, Beijing, Shanxi, Liaoning, Jiangsu, Anhui,\nGuangdong, Henan, Hubei, Sichuan, Chongqi Yunnan, and Gansu in 2002, Beijing, Shanxi, Liaoning, Jiangsu,\nAnhui, Guangdong, Henan, Hubei, Sichuan, Chongqi, Yunnan, Gansu, Shanghai, Zherjiang, Fujian, Hunan in\n2007 and 2013. Utilizing the information of the regions, we merge the MW level2 based on the National Mini-\nmum Wage Dataset to the CHIP survey data to construct the new dataset--including the individual level data\nand the regional level MW data for the analysis.\n3.3. Variable Setting\nThe wage is defined as the total earnings from work (called \"the total wage\")3. Here, it comprises the basic wage,\ncash subsidy, and no cash subsidy4. We use the CPI in 1995 as the standard, and adjust the nominal monthly\nwage and nominal MW level in every year.\nThe analytic objects of this paper are employees, excluding the self-employer and the unemployed. Consider-\ning the retirement system of the state-owned sector, to reduce the effect of that system on the analysis result, the\nanalytic objects are limited in the groups to between the ages of 16 and 60.\nIn the wage function, the explained variable is the logarithm of the monthly wage, and the explaining va-\nriables are the variables likely to affect the wage, such as schooling years, experience years5, public sector\ndummy variable6, occupation dummy variable7, industry dummy variable8, and region dummy variables (the\nEast, Central and West Regions).\n4. Descriptive Statistics of the Data\n4.1. Descriptive Statistics of Variables\nThe statistical description of variables for the three periods is summarized in Table 1. It showed that the indi-\nvidual characteristic and variable distributions in the occupation, industry, and regions are different for the pub-\nlic and private sectors.\n2Based on the MW policy, the MW level is adjusted once every one or two years, according to many factors, such as the lowest regional liv-\ning cost, consumer price index of urban residents, social insurance, the housing fund that individual workers are paid, regional average wage\nlevel, status of economic development, and employment status. The local government (province or city government) adjusts the MW level;\nas a result, there are regional disparities in MW levels.\n3According to the MW policy published in 1993, the main content of the MW consist of total earnings from work (except the overtime sub-\nsidy), any risk job subsidy and social security subsidy. We cannot distinguish the detail subsidy items from CHIP data. We also made an\nanalysis using the basic wage. The results are similar to the results using the total wage. Therefore, we show the results using total wage in\nthis paper. The earnings data does not include unofficial payments, and if such payments are more likely to be made to men, the gender\nwage gap will be underestimated.\n4Here, no cash subsidy is the goods which is provided by the firm or the organization in the public sector. For example, the workers receive\nthe food, the clothes and the other goods in the festivals such as the spring festivals (the Chinese New Year) from the state-owned enterpris-\nes (SOEs). These no cash subsidy in the CHIP survey are calculated by the market prices and they are utilized in the analysis as a part of\nwages.\n5Experience years = age-6-schooling years.\n6It is equal to 1 if the individual is working in the government organization, public organization (Shiye Danwei) and state-owned enterprises,\nit is equal to 0 if not.\n7It is equal to 1 if the individual is working as blue-color worker (such as manual job worker), it is equal to 0 if not.\n8It is equal to 1 if the individual is working in manufacturing industry, it is equal to 0 if not.\nX.

Does the spike effect exist in urban China?\nWage distribution using kernel density estimates are calculated for the three periods. These results are shown in\nTable 2.

The spike-shaped wage distribution showed that the\nproportions of groups around the maximum values of the MW level, particularly for the group with the wage\njust a little more than the maximum values of the MW level are greater--it indicated that the MW increased the\nwage levels around the MW before the MW enforcement. As it is described from the above, the MW was first\npromulgated as a law--Enterprise's Minimum Wage Regulations--in 1993, and it was enforced since 2004 in\nChina, therefore these estimated results indicated that there exist the spike effects in urban China for the MW\n5. Econometric Analysis Results\n5.1. Results of MW Effects on Average Wage\nand the 2007-2013 period. We observe the effect of MW on average wage through the estimated coefficient of\nthe MW logarithmic value.\nFirst (Estimation 1), the estimated coefficients of MW logarithmic values are the greatest for the 1998-2002\nperiod and smallest for the 1993-1995 period. Comparing the impact of the MW system at the beginning to the\npresent times, the effects of MW level on the average wage level is becoming greater.\nIn additions, holding the other factors consistent, the average wage level is higher for the public sector than\ner in the 2007-2013 period). Wage gaps between the public and private sectors exist in urban China even though\nthe human capital of workers is consistent in these two sectors from 1993 to 2013.\nSecond (Estimation 2 and Estimation 3), if the sample is divided between the public and private sectors, the\neffects of the MW are all positively significant in the three periods, and the coefficients of MW logarithmic val-\nues are greater for the private sector than for the public sector in the three periods. Results showed that although\nthe MW effect exists in both public sector and private sector, it is greater for the private sector than for the pub-\nlic sector.\nThird (Estimation 4), results of Estimation 2 and Estimation 3 might be caused by the human capital differen-\ntial and distribution proportion differential in terms of occupation, industry, and regions between these two sec-\ntors. Therefore, Estimation 4 is employed to control these influences. The estimated coefficients of interaction\ntors consistent, the effect of MW level on average wage is greater for the private sector than for public sector.\nThese results are consistent with the results in Estimation 2 and Estimation 3.\n5.2. Results of MW Effects on Wage Distribution in the Public and Private Sectors\nFigure 2 shows the estimated coefficients of MW logarithmic values based on the Quantile Regression (QR)\nmodel using total samples for the three periods.

To answer the ques-\ntion, two types of estimations are employed; they are shown in Figure 3 and Table 4.\nFirst, using the subsamples, the total samples are divided into two subsamples--the public sector group and\nthe private sector group. Estimations by the two sectors are employed and the results are summarized as follows:\nX. Ma\nTable 3.

Results of MW Effects on the Wage Gap between the Public and Private Sectors\nResults of the MW effects on the wage gap between the public and private sectors are shown in Table 5.\nFirst, overall, the influences of both unexplained differential and explained differential affect the wage gaps\nbetween the public and private sectors in the three periods.

Based on the CHIPs data, the proportion of workers with wages\n(2) The estimated values of the MW as a component of unexplained differentials are negative in the 1993-\n2002 period. It indicates that the MW effects on wage are greater for the private sector than for the public sector\nand contributes to reduce the wage gap in the MW beginning period and the MW enforcement period.\n(3) Considering the influences of other factors, the human capital is the main factor to cause the wage gap.\nFor example, the estimated value of education as a component of explained differential (31.9%) and of expe-\nvalue of education as a component of explained differential (37.8%) and of experience year as a component of\nponent of explained differentials (125.7%) and of experience year as a component of explained differentials is\ncation and the seniority wage system, which is mostly implemented in the public sector, are the main factors to\ncause the wage gaps between the public and private sectors.\n6. Conclusions\nChinese government has been officially implementing the MW system since 1993 and enforced MW policy in\nall of China since 2004. It is thought that the implementation of the MW policy contributes to increasing in-\ncomes of low-wage groups and reducing their poverty. In China, does the MW affect average wage and wage\ndistribution? Particularly, does the MW affect the wages for low-wage groups? Does the spillover effect of MW\nexist in China? If it does, does there exist the difference of MW effects between the public and private sectors?\nTo answer these questions, this study employs empirical studies using cross-section survey data--CHIPs 1995,\nemerge.\nFirst, comparatively, the overall impact of the MW on average wage at the MW policy beginning period is\ngreater than the effect of the MW level on the average wage.\nSecond, the MW effects on average wage exist in both the public and private sectors. However, holding the\nother factors consistent, the MW effect on average wage is greater for the private sector than for the public sec-\ntor.\nThird, the overall effects of MW level on the low-wage group increased in the 2007-2013 period.\nFourth, the effects of MW on wage distribution are greater for the private sector than for the public sector in\nthe three periods. Holding the other factors consistent, the impact of MW on the low-wage group for the private\nFifth, decomposition results indicated that the differences of distribution proportions, in regions with different\nMW levels, between the public and private sectors helped reduce the wage gaps, as did the MW effects on wage,\nX. Ma\nAccording to these empirical analyses, we can conclude that the MW implementation contributes to the rise in\nwage level for the low-wage groups in the public and private sectors. There are two points worthy of attention.\nFirst, the results revealed that the difference between the effects of MW on the public and the private sectors\nbecame greater for the low-wage group in the 2007-2013 period. The results might be caused by the reason that\nalong with the MW implementation, the MW compliance problem was reduced. A comparison study on the MW\ncompliance problem for the private sector and the public sector should be done in the future. Moreover, the re-\nsults show that the effects of MW on average wage and wage distribution are greater for the private sector than\nfor the public sector. Thus, the effects of MW level adjustment (rise in the MW levels) on labor force costs--\nwhich affect labor demand for the low-skill or low-education workers--might be greater for the private sector;\nhence, the negative effect on employment might be greater for the private sector than for the public sector. Thus,\nthe MW effects on employment should be considered when the government decides to modify the MW levels.\nAlthough this study utilized the repeated cross-section data (CHIPs) to analyze the impact of the Minimum\nthe 2007-2013 periods, and compared the MW effects between public and private sectors, there left the endo-\ngeneity and heterogeneity problems in the study. Panel data should be utilized to address these econometric\nproblems in the future. Moreover, the results also showed that the greater proportions of high-level education\nand the seniority wage system, which is mostly implemented in the public sector, are the main factors to cause\nthe wage gaps between the public and private sectors. Thus using the firm level survey data, the researches re-\nlated to the effects of firm wage and employment systems also should be done in the future.\nFunding\nNote\nData used for the study was provided by the Income Inequality Research Center, Beijing Normal University.\nReferences\nBhorat, H., Kanbur, R., & Stanwix, B.
