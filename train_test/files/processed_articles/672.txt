    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Previous research based on the Community Tracking Study (CTS) showed that\nwhile coverage expansions through the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP)\ngreatly increased children's eligibility for public or private health insurance coverage,\nuninsurance rates remained unchanged because of low take-up by eligible children. How-\never, more recent data show that this is changing. Children's uninsurance rates decreased\ntake-up rates have traditionally been the lowest and uninsurance rates the highest. Al-\nthough uninsurance rates still can be decreased further, state budget pressures threaten\nthe momentum toward higher participation in public programs.\nTo i n c r e a s e insurance coverage\namong low-income children, the State\nChildren's Health Insurance Program\n(SCHIP) was enacted in 1997. Enrollment had\nstudies have noted decreases in children's\nuninsurance rates since its implementation.1\nNevertheless, very little is known about how\nchildren's coverage availability and enroll-\nment have changed, and what the potential is\nfor future gains in coverage.\nOne key area of concern among policy-\nmakers is the level of Medicaid and SCHIP\nparticipation among those who are eligible.\nDespite efforts by federal and state govern-\nments, an earlier study indicated continued\nlow participation of eligible children despite\nincreased eligibility.2 Other studies have also\nexamined participation in SCHIP and Medic-\naid, but none has examined changes in partici-\npation since SCHIP was implemented.3\nChildren's uninsurance rates vary across the\ncountry, and a disproportionately large num-\nber of uninsured children are concentrated in\nareas with very high uninsurance rates. While\nthe greatest potential for gains in coverage ex-\nist in such areas, it may be more difficult to in-\ncrease coverage there. For example, participa-\ntion in public coverage programs tends to be\nlower than in other areas (despite higher costs\nfor private insurance).4 Barriers to public pro-\ngram enrollment, such as a more burdensome\napplication process, immigration status con-\ncerns, or greater stigma about accepting gov-\nernment-sponsored health coverage, may be\ngreater as well. Failure to remove these barri-\ners will greatly limit the ability of SCHIP to re-\nduce the number of uninsured children, and\nthere will continue to be large disparities in\ncoverage and access to care.\nThis study uses data from three rounds of\nthe Community Tracking Study (CTS) house-\nT r e n d s\nH E A LT H A F F A I R S ~ Vo l u m e 2 2 , N u m b e r 4 1 6 3\n\u00a92003 Project HOPE\u00adThe People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nPeterCunninghamisaseniorhealthresearcherattheCenterforStudyingHealthSystemChangeinWashington,\nD.C.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Results are then used\nto assess the potential for future gains in chil-\ndren's coverage.\nData And Methods\nThe CTS is a longitudinal study designed to\ntrack changes in the health care system and the\neffects of these changes on individuals.5 The\nCTS household survey is designed to produce\nrepresentative estimates, for the U.S. popula-\ntion and sixty randomly selected communities,\nof health insurance coverage, access to care,\nuse of services, and perceived quality of care.6\nThree rounds of the CTS household survey\nhave been completed, the first between Au-\nsage and implementation of SCHIP. The sec-\nond round was completed between August\nhad begun implementation of their programs,\nand SCHIP enrollment increased from less\nthan one million in late 1998 to just under two\nwas completed between August 2000 and Sep-\ntember 2001, by the end of which SCHIP en-\nrollment had increased to about 3.5 million\nchildren.8 The total sample for this study con-\nn Classification of CTS communities.\nThe CTS is unique among major national sur-\nveys of health insurance coverage and health\ncare in that it allows representative estimates\nfor individual communities as well as groups\nof communities. The sixty CTS communities\nare classified into three groups based on chil-\n(pre-SCHIP): low-uninsurance communities\n(children's uninsurance rates of less than 8 per-\ncent), moderate-uninsurance communities (8\u00ad\n15 percent), and high-uninsurance communi-\nties (16 percent or higher). Estimates for each\ngroup of sites are weighted to be representa-\ntive of all U.S. communities with low, moder-\nate, or high percentages of uninsured children\nbefore SCHIP.\nn Defining eligibility for and take-up of\npublic and private coverage. Eligibility for\npublic coverage is defined as being eligible for\nMedicaid or other state coverage programs\n(such as SCHIP). Determining eligibility for\nchildren in the sample takes into account year-\nand state-specific criteria related to age, in-\ncome, family composition, and parents' labor-\nforce participation.10 State-specific criteria as\nof 1996 were used to determine eligibility for\nMedicaid and selected other state programs\nMedicaid, as well as the age and income crite-\nria for the SCHIP programs that existed dur-\ntively, were used.\nEligibility for Medicaid and SCHIP in this\nstudy does not take into account program-\nspecific income disregards as well as the legal\nstatus of foreign-born noncitizen children, be-\ncause of the lack of data in the CTS.12 Although\nthese limitations are important when deter-\nmining eligibility for individuals, they are\nlikely to be less important for showing aggre-\ngate estimates of eligibility for a population\nand therefore would have little effect on our\nconclusions. In fact, when comparing similar\ntime periods, CTS estimates of children who\nare eligible for Medicaid and SCHIP are almost\nidentical to other national estimates of eligibil-\nity that account for legal status and income\ndisregards.13 CTS estimates of Medicaid eligi-\nbility before SCHIP are also close to other\nAccounting for foreign-born children's legal\nstatus could have a disproportionate effect on\nestimates of eligibility for high-uninsurance\nrelative to low-uninsurance communities. In\nthe findings section, it is demonstrated that\nthe extent of the error in high-uninsurance\ncommunities is not likely to materially affect\nour overall results and conclusions.\nH e a l t h T r a c k i n g\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Although the CTS\ndoes not ascertain whether parents were of-\nfered dependent coverage, other data show\nthat 98 percent of employees who are offered\ncoverage are also offered family coverage.15\nTake-up rates reflect the percentage of eli-\ngible children who actually enroll in\nemployer-sponsored or public coverage. The\ndenominator for computing take-up rates for\nemployer coverage is based on the number of\nchildren determined to be eligible, as defined\nabove. For Medicaid/SCHIP, the denominator\nfor computing take-up rates is based on the\nnumber of children who are eligible and who\nare not enrolled in any type of private insur-\nance coverage. Numerators for both are based\non the number of children enrolled in that\ntype of coverage on the day of the interview.\nThe computation of take-up rates for\nMedicaid/SCHIP differs from the earlier study\nin that that study included all income-eligible\nchildren in the denominator, regardless of\nwhether they were enrolled in private insur-\nance.16 Since privately insured children are\ntechnically not eligible for SCHIP, excluding\nthem allows for a more accurate assessment of\npublic program participation. It also results in\na higher estimate of Medicaid/SCHIP take-up\nin this study than in the earlier study (because\nof a smaller denominator).\nStudy Findings\nn Changes in coverage. Children's un-\ninsurance rates did not change between the\nhibit 1). Nearly 20 percent fewer children were\nhaps even more striking is that the decline oc-\ncurred almost entirely in communities with\nmoderate and high uninsurance rates. The per-\ncentage of low-income uninsured children de-\nmoderate-insurance communities and from\nuninsurance communities.\nGains in coverage were due entirely to large\nincreases in the percentage of children en-\nrolled in public coverage. Among low-income\nchildren, the percentage with Medicaid/\nSCHIP coverage increased from 28.9 percent\nover, all of these increases occurred in moder-\nate- and high-uninsurance communities. Low-\nuninsurance communities already had rela-\ntively high rates of public coverage among low-\nincome children (36.8 percent), as a result of\nrelatively expansive public programs that ex-\nisted before SCHIP, and rates of public cover-\nage for this group did not change between\nThere was also a decrease in low-income\nchildren's private insurance coverage during\nthis period; this decrease took place entirely in\nmoderate- and high-uninsurance communi-\nties. Other research based on the CTS shows\nthat Medicaid/SCHIP expansions resulted in\nsome substitution of public for private insur-\nance coverage (known as \"crowding out\"), and\nthe results in this paper suggest that this sub-\nstitution was concentrated in communities\nwith moderate uninsurance rates or higher.18\nn Changes in eligibility. Much of the in-\ncrease in Medicaid/SCHIP coverage between\ngains in eligibility, especially among low-\ngains occurred among children in moderate-\nand high-uninsurance communities, where eli-\ngibility before SCHIP had been the lowest.\nEligibility also increased in low-\nuninsurance communities, but the increase\nwas not as large or dramatic as elsewhere (Ex-\nhibit 2). Many low-uninsurance communities\nare in states that already had expansive public\ncoverage programs before SCHIP, either\nthrough optional Medicaid expansions that\nincreased eligibility well beyond the federal\nmandates or through separate state programs\nwith generous eligibility levels. Examples of\nthe latter prior to SCHIP include Washington\n(Basic Health Plan), Minnesota (Minnesota-\nCare), and Massachusetts (Children's Medical\nSecurity Plan), which all had low-uninsurance\nT r e n d s\nH E A LT H A F F A I R S ~ Vo l u m e 2 2 , N u m b e r 4 1 6 5\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Despite the\nfact that take-up rates of public coverage rose\nin communities with moderate and high un-\ninsurance rates, they are still considerably\nlower than take-up rates in communities with\nlow uninsurance. Since coverage expansions\nare relatively recent in moderate- and high-\nuninsurance communities, there is still poten-\ntial for take-up rates to increase there.

Three sets of predictions\nare computed: (1) assuming that all communi-\nties achieve a 75 percent take-up rate for\nMedicaid/SCHIP (which is equal to the 2000\u00ad\n01 actual rate for low-uninsurance communi-\nties, and the highest rate observed for that time\nperiod); (2) assuming that all communities\nachieve an 80 percent take-up rate (which is\nroughly equal to the pre-SCHIP take-up rate\nfor low-uninsurance communities, and the\nhighest rate observed in the CTS data); and (3)\nassuming that all communities achieve an 85\npercent take-up rate (which is higher than\nwhat has previously been observed in the CTS\ndata and is comparable to take-up rates of\nemployer-sponsored coverage). The results of\nthese predictions (Exhibit 4) show that there\nis still potential for further reductions in chil-\ndren's uninsurance rates (up to a 40 percent\n85 percent are achieved).\nWhether these more optimistic projections\nT r e n d s\nH E A LT H A F F A I R S ~ Vo l u m e 2 2 , N u m b e r 4 1 6 9\nSimulated Decreases In Uninsurance Rates Assuming Continued Increases In\nUninsurance rate for children\nTotal\nU.S.\nLow-\nuninsurance\nareas\nModerate-\nuninsurance\nareas\nHigh-\nuninsurance\nareas\nPredicted uninsurance rate, assuming\nincreased take-up rate for Medicaid/SCHIP\n75% (best achieved post-SCHIP)\n80% (best achieved pre-SCHIP)\nSOURCE: Author's analysis.\nNOTE: SCHIP is State Children's Health Insurance Program.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Despite\nthe fact that take-up of public coverage in-\neas with lower uninsurance rates (75 percent\ntake-up in low-uninsurance areas compared\nwith 64 percent in high-uninsurance areas,\nExhibit 3). Increasing participation levels in\nhigh-uninsurance areas to at least 75 percent\nmay prove to be difficult if there are continued\nbarriers to enrollment in these areas, despite\nrecent successes.\nImplications For Policy\nAfter a slow start, SCHIP has resulted in a\nreduction in uninsurance among children. The\nfindings strongly suggest that this is happen-\ning not only through expanding the number of\nchildren who are eligible for coverage but also\nby increasing participation among eligible\nchildren. Perhaps even more encouraging is\nthat some of the greatest gains are taking place\nin areas where uninsurance rates have tradi-\ntionally been the highest and public program\nparticipation the lowest. This suggests that\nstates' efforts to reduce administrative barriers\nand encourage enrollment are paying off. Fu-\nture studies should examine features of state\nSCHIP programs--such as outreach activities,\nefforts to reduce enrollment barriers, and pro-\ngram model (that is, Medicaid expansion ver-\nsus a separate SCHIP program)--to under-\nstand those aspects of SCHIP that have been\nmost effective in increasing enrollment.\nNevertheless, participation continues to lag\nin areas with a disproportionately large num-\nber of uninsured children, and the potential for\nfuture gains greatly depends on being able to\nfurther increase take-up in these areas. Despite\nrecent successes, barriers to enrollment per-\nsist, including the continuing stigma of enroll-\nment in public programs among some poten-\ntial beneficiaries, remaining complexities in\nthe application process, confusion or apathy\namong some potential beneficiaries, and cost-\nsharing provisions in some states.25\nRecent events threaten the gains made to\ndate and could undermine the potential for\nfurther reductions in the number of uninsured\nchildren. Increases in Medicaid and SCHIP en-\nrollment along with rising health care costs are\ncontributing to states' budgetary pressures,\nwhich are intensifying efforts by states to con-\ntain these costs. While few states were actively\nconsidering reducing eligibility at the time of\nthis writing, more states are reducing or elimi-\nnating strategies to encourage enrollment.26\nThe return of high health care inflation as\nwell as rising unemployment also might re-\nduce the number of children with private in-\nsurance coverage. This could offset the in-\ncreases in Medicaid/SCHIP coverage by\nraising the number of uninsured children who\nare eligible for neither employer-sponsored\nnor public coverage. Higher premiums could\nlead parents to transfer more children from\nprivate to public coverage, which could further\nincrease enrollment and the pressure on states\nto limit eligibility and enrollment.\nThus, the period of strong economic\ngrowth, flush state budgets, and general en-\nthusiasm for expanding enrollment in public\ncoverage programs that existed in the early\nyears of SCHIP implementation has given way\nto a period of greater economic uncertainty\nand greater concern about controlling pro-\ngram costs. Continued monitoring of chil-\ndren's health insurance coverage is needed if\nwe are to understand how this shift in priori-\nties will affect the recent gains in children's\ncoverage, and the potential for future gains.\nTheCenterforStudyingHealthSystemChangeissup-\nportedinfullbytheRobertWoodJohnsonFoundation.\nTheauthorthanksLenNicholsandtwoanonymousre-\nviewersfortheirhelpfulcomments.\nH e a l t h T r a c k i n g\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

As in other studies that examined eligibility, fam-\nilies in the CTS are defined as the household\nmembers who would be eligible for coverage un-\nder most family health insurance policies.\n11. Eligibility for state coverage programs other than\nMedicaid that existed before SCHIP was also\nconsidered. Since these varied considerably in\nterms of program design, comprehensiveness of\nbenefits, and enrollment limits, we included only\nthose where program penetration exceeded 5\npercent of uninsured children in the state. These\nprograms include MinnesotaCare, Washington\nState's Basic Health Plan, Massachusetts' Medi-\ncal Security Plan, New York's Child Health Plus,\nCalifornia's AIM, and Pennsylvania's Children's\nHealth Insurance Program.\n12. Income in the CTS is reported as annual family\nincome from all sources. Similar to other national\nsurveys of health care, family income is reported\nfor the prior year (for example, people inter-\nviewed in 2001 were asked about family income\nfor 2000), while health insurance coverage is\nmeasured at the time of the survey. The extent to\nwhich aggregate estimates of eligibility and take-\nup are biased because of the different reference\nperiods for income and insurance coverage is un-\nknown, but this is unlikely to affect the conclu-\nsions from this study concerning change over\ntime and variation across communities.\n13. A recent study that applied eligibility criteria for\nFamilies (NSAF) found that 50 percent of chil-\ndren were eligible for Medicaid and SCHIP, even\nwhen accounting for income disregards and im-\nputing the legal status of immigrant children\n(which was not observed directly in the NSAF).\nWhen eligibility criteria for 2000 are applied to\nCTS round that is most comparable to the 1999\nNSAF), 49 percent of children were estimated to\nbe eligible for Medicaid and SCHIP. The close-\nness of CTS aggregate estimates to other esti-\nmates of eligibility may reflect in part the fact\nthat income disregards and legal status are to\nsome extent offsetting, since taking income dis-\nregards into account increases the percentage of\nchildren who are eligible for Medicaid/SCHIP,\nwhile taking the legal status of noncitizen chil-\ndren into account decreases the percentage eligi-\nble. The estimates based on NSAF can be found\nin L. Dubay, J. Haley, and G. Kenney, Children's Eli-\ngibility for Medicaid and SCHIP: A View from 2000\n(Washington: Urban Institute, March 2002).\n14.

As are other survey-based estimates of public\nprogram enrollment, CTS estimates of public\nprogram enrollment are lower than those based\non administrative data. Some of this reflects the\nfact that people with dual private and public\ncoverage in the CTS were classified as \"private,\"\nwhile the \"Medicaid/SCHIP\" category reflects\nthose with that coverage only. However, at least\nsome of the discrepancy in public coverage esti-\nmates between survey and administrative data is\nalso likely to be due to errors with administrative\ndata and not just errors with survey data.

A more thorough analysis of the coverage\nCTS data showed that eligibility expansions at-\ntributable to SCHIP did result in a considerable\namount of substitution of public for private cov-\nerage, or crowding out. See P.J. Cunningham, J.\nHadley, and J. Reschovsky, \"The Effects of SCHIP\non Children's Health Insurance Coverage: Early\nEvidence from the Community Tracking Study,\"\nMedical Care Research and Review (December 2002):\nbe found at www.hschange.org.\n19. Some communities in the low-uninsurance\ngroup had sizable changes in coverage. For ex-\nample, Boston and Seattle showed decreases in\nenced no change or had increases in uninsurance,\nwith the result being no net change for the group\nas a whole.\n20. Dubay et al., Children's Eligibility. In computing\nstate-specific estimates of eligibility, the authors\ncomputed two sets of estimates: (1) assuming\nthat noncitizen children who met the other cri-\nteria were eligible for Medicaid/SCHIP, and (2)\nassuming that all noncitizen children who met\nthe other criteria were not eligible for Medicaid/\nSCHIP. Thus, the discrepancy of three to five per-\ncentage points between the two estimates for the\nthree states with high uninsurance rates repre-\nsents an upper bound, and the actual discrep-\nancy is likely to be lower.\ncharacteristics of eligible children either because\nsome types of children are more or less predis-\nposed to enroll in public programs, or because\nsome categories of public program eligibility are\nknown to have higher take-up rates (for exam-\nple, poorer children eligible for Medicaid gener-\nally have higher take-up rates than do children\neligible for SCHIP). To test this, I estimated a lo-\ngistic regression model of the likelihood of hav-\ning Medicaid/SCHIP coverage for the combined\nExhibit 3). Independent variables included chil-\ndren's age, sex, race/ethnicity, health status, fam-\nily structure (number of parents, number of sib-\nlings), family income, and a binary variable indi-\nlikelihood of having Medicaid/SCHIP coverage\nthe results of the binary variable), even after\nchanges in the characteristics of eligible children\nwere controlled for.\n22. To the extent that the increase in eligibility was\noverstated in moderate- and high-uninsurance\ncommunities, the increase in take-up in these\ncommunities is likely to be understated, and the\nactual increase in take-up is likely to be larger\n(that is, the denominators include more children\nwho are not eligible).\nwas demonstrated in Cunningham et al., \"The\nEffects of SCHIP.\" Although the decreases in\ntake-up of employer-sponsored coverage for\nlow-income children in moderate- and high-\nuninsurance communities were not statistically\nsignificant, the size of the decrease is twice as\nlarge in high- as in moderate-uninsurance com-\nmunities. This explains why high-uninsurance\ncommunities did not experience a larger de-\ncrease in uninsurance rates than moderate-\nuninsurance communities did (see Exhibit 1), de-\nspite the fact that increases in eligibility were\nsomewhat larger in high-uninsurance communi-\nties.\n24.
