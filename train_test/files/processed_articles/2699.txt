    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: The purpose of this study is to apply Andersen's Behavioral Model of Health Service Use to men's\nprisons to assess the direct and indirect effects of inmate predisposing characteristics through multiple types of\nneed. Also examined are the effects of prison-specific enabling factors and the variation in use of health services\nacross prisons. This study uses a nationally representative U.S. sample of men incarcerated in state prisons\n(n = 8816) and generalized structural equation and multilevel modeling. Five types of need--medical condition,\nillness, dental problem, unintentional injury, and intentional injury--are assessed for their association with use of\nhealth services.\nResults: Findings indicate that a number of inmate predisposing (age, race, education) and vulnerability (mood/\nanxiety disorder,) characteristics are associated with use of health services but are partially mediated by enabling\nand need factors. Each type of medical need has strong direct effects with mood/anxiety disorder emerging as the\nstrongest total effect (including both direct effects and indirect effects through need). There is significant variation\nin rates of health service utilization across prisons that is not accounted for by the prison-level factors included in\nthe multilevel model.\nConclusions: The varying patterns of health service use across prisons suggest that incarceration may be an\nimportant circumstance that shapes health. In other words, where someone is incarcerated may influence their\nability to access and use services in response to medical need. It is important that prisons provide integrated\nservices for inmates with mood/anxiety disorder given high comorbidity with other health conditions.\n",

(Estelle v. Gamble, 429\nThus, inmates have a constitutionally protected right\nto care for their \"serious medical needs.\"1 Additionally,\nunder the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Person Act\nrequired to staff medical and mental health professionals\nto determine when an inmate is in need of medical or\nmental health services (jails with less than 100 detainees\nare exempt). However, reports indicate that nonmedical\ncorrectional staff often perform screening during intake\nTraditional correctional settings are designed for\npunishment, incapacitation, and deterrence (Cullen &\nJonson, 2011), goals which conflict with the aims of\nhealth care (Watson, Stimpson, & Hostick, 2004). Allen\net al. (2010) summarize this tension stating:\nUnlike most healthcare settings where the physician is\nonly responsible for the patient's welfare, doctors\nworking within corrections often find themselves caught\nbetween the punitive aspect of the institutions' mission\nand the best interests of their patients. This dual loyalty\nconflict is made that much harder by the fact that many\nfeatures of the correctional system can directly conflict\nwith optimal treatment for a patient's medical\nconditions. This can include the deleterious effect of\nincarceration itself, especially for the mentally ill.\nThe healthcare infrastructure within correctional facilities\ncan create barriers limiting access to medical care (Magee,\nHult, & McMillan, 2005). Mandatory requirement of co-\npays, hygiene issues, administration of wrong medications,\nmedications stopped by mistake, delay in obtaining needed\nmedications, allergic reactions to medications, and other er-\nrors on the part of the facility all contribute negatively to the\nhealth of inmates (Hatton, Kleffel, & Fisher, 2006). Providing\ndiagnosis and treatment, and coordinating for transitions in\ncare upon release from prison can be extremely beneficial\nfor community public health (Binswanger, Redmond, Steiner,\n& Hicks, 2011) and in reducing recidivism (Baillargeon,\nBinswanger, Penn, Williams, & Murray, 2009).\nThe high rates of disease and illness in prisons\ncoupled with large incarceration rates for men and race/\nethnic minority groups, suggest a need to examine the role\nof the prison in the administration of healthcare in U.S.\nsociety given that prisons disproportionately house indi-\nviduals with disadvantaged health profiles. It has been\ndocumented that criminal-justice involved persons receive\nonly episodic care from correctional facilities and emer-\ngency rooms (Boutwell & Freedman, 2014). The prison\npopulation, specifically, makes up 1% of the total U.S.\nwith less than a high school education (Pettit, 2012). Black\nmen also have the highest mortality rates (Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention, 2016) and among the low-\nest rates of health coverage (James, Thomas, Lillie-Blanton,\nBehavioral models of service use are useful in identifying\npredictors of medical care and to assess whether health\nservice use is equitably distributed. In this study, Ander-\nsen's Behavioral Model of Health Service Use, first devel-\nprisons. Andersen's model has been mainly used for\nexplaining health care utilization patterns by the general\npopulation and suggests that use of health services is a\nfunction of predisposition to use services, factors that en-\nable or impede use, and need for care, thus providing a\nway to conceptualize variations in utilization. The model\nspecifies both individual and contextual determinants of\nhealth service use including individual's predisposing\ncharacteristics (e.g., demographic variables, socioeconomic\nstatus), enabling resources (e.g., health coverage, income),\nand perceived need (on the part of the individual) and\nevaluated need (on the part of a professional) (see Fig. 1).\nFig. 1 Analytical model of inmate health service use\nEnabling factors are social factors that are thought to play\na role in access to care. As previously discussed, within a\nprison access to care is supposedly the same for all in-\nmates. Therefore, this study examines factors that shape\nthe day-to-day experience for inmates such as offender\nstatus and hours spent in work assignment. Perceived\nneed for care should account for the majority of the ex-\nplained variability in health service use. Put another way,\nif service use is equitably distributed within and between\nprisons, individuals who are most at need will be most\nlikely to use services, and other observed factors will not\ninfluence use of services.\nAndersen's model has been updated and modified\nseveral times by Andersen and others (Andersen, 1995;\nAndersen & Newman, 1973; Stein, Andersen, & Gelberg,\n2007). For example, Gelberg, Andersen, and Leake\n(2000) developed the Behavioral Model for Vulnerable\nPopulations. This expanded model includes specific\nvulnerabilities found among homeless people such as\nmental illness, substance use, and competing needs for\nhealth services. Notably, Leukefeld et al. (1998) propose,\nand later test (Garrity, Hiller, Staton, Webster, &\nAndersen's model for examining use of medical services\namong drug-abusing offenders. They demonstrate that\npre-prison demographic and drug abuse history are\nimportant predictors of medical service use.\nThis study is among the first to apply Andersen's\nmodel to a diverse group of prison inmates using a\nmultilevel and structural equation modeling framework\nto assess health service use across multiple need factors.\nSpecifically examined is how varying prison contexts and\ninmate prison experience influence men's' use of health\nservices while incarcerated, above and beyond need. Also\nexamined are the potential indirect pathways on use of\nhealth services through variation in need by demo-\ngraphic and vulnerable factors that inmates bring with\nthem--or \"import\" (Irwin & Cressey, 1962)--when they\nare incarcerated. The overall research question is: what\nare the factors associated with health service utilization\nin men's prisons, and do utilization rates vary by prison?\nMethods\nData\nThe 2004 Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) Survey of\nInmates in State Correctional Facilities (SISCF) provides\na nationally-representative sample of persons incarcer-\nated in state prisons (United States Department of\nJustice. Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2007). The sample\ndesign employed a stratified, two-stage selection process.\nThere were 1401 male facilities included in the sampling\nframe with the 14 largest male prisons selected with cer-\ntainty. The remaining 1387 male prisons were stratified\nby U.S. region and population size with 222 additional\nfacilities selected for participation. Prisoners were then\nrandomly selected for participation within each facility.\nA total of 13,098 men were selected for participation\nwith a final overall sample size of 14,499 male and\nfemale inmates. The survey asks respondents about their\nincarceration history, offense characteristics, family and\nbackground characteristics, drug and alcohol use and\nabuse, prison activities, and self-reported health, mental\nhealth, and treatment history.\nThe sample for the current analysis includes only men\nwho are currently serving time who are aged 18 or older.\nWomen are excluded since, by definition, they are\nhoused in separate facilities. Because of skip patterns in\nthe survey instrument, only those inmates who reported\nany health problems (defined below) are included.\nRespondents were only asked about using health services\nif they reported a health problem. Therefore, there is not\ninformation on people who used health services without\nalso self-reporting a health problem. Patterns of missing-\nness were examined and less than 5% of cases had no\nmissing information. Therefore, a listwise deletion was\nperformed to exclude cases with missing information.\nThe final sample size that is used for all of the analyses\nin this study is 8816 men.2 All estimates are adjusted for\nthe complex study design. 3\nMeasures\nIndividual-level need and service use. The bivariate\noutcome included use of any medical care4 as a result of\nany of the need factors listed below. Overall, 83.6% of\ninmates reporting a health need used health services.\n\"Serious medical needs\" in this study were defined as\nreporting a current medical condition5, an illness since\nincarceration, a dental problem since incarceration, an\nunintentional injury since incarceration, and an\nintentional injury (e.g., assault) since incarceration. Al-\nmost one-third of inmates reported a medical condition\n(30.8%) while three-quarters reported an illness while\nincarcerated (73.5%). Sixty percent reported having a\ndental problem during their current incarceration epi-\ntional injury while 19.7% experienced an intentional\nIndividual-level predisposing factors. The characteris-\ntics for all study variables are presented in Table 1.\nSeven inmate-level predisposing factors were included:\nage, race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic\nblack, Latino, other race), nativity (foreign born), marital\nstatus (never married), education (at least high school),\nemployed prior to incarceration, and veteran status. The\naverage age for this sample was 36 years. The majority\nof inmates were men of color with 41% black, 17%\nLatino, and 6% other race. Seven percent were foreign\nborn. About half of inmates had never been married\n(56%) while about 70 % had a high school education\n(68%) and or were employed prior to incarceration\n(72%). Twelve percent reported serving in the military.\nIndividual-level vulnerability factors. There were four\nvulnerability predisposing factors included: previous\nincarceration episodes (zero, one, two, three or more;\nmean = 1.09), mood/anxiety disorder (i.e., depression,\nbipolar, anxiety, and or PTSD; 23%), schizophrenia (4%),\nand alcohol/drug dependence (42%).\nContextual-level predisposing factors. There were\nfour prison-level predisposing factors computed by\naggregating self-reported measures to the prison level,\nsimilar to previous prison studies (e.g., Jiang & Winfree,\ncluded proportion of inmates aged 25 or younger,\nproportion of black inmates, proportion of Hispanic in-\nmates, and proportion violent offenders. Table 1 shows\nthat there was wide variation in proportions across\nprisons. For example, the mean proportion for black in-\nwithin a prison.\nIndividual-level enabling factors. The six inmate-level\nenabling factors were the number of years served to date\nduring the current incarceration episode (continuous),\noffender status (violent offender and drug offender\ncompared to other), receiving visits from family and\nfriends in the past 12 months (0 visits, 1 visit, 2+ visits),\nreceiving a phone call from family/friends in the past\nweek (0 calls, 1 call, 2+ calls), and the number of hours\nspent in work assignment during the past week (con-\ntinuous). Thirteen percent of inmates had one visit with\nfamily/friends in the past month with 17% having two or\nmore visits. A higher percentage of inmates had phone\ncalls with family/friends in the past week: 17% once and\n29% two or more. Consistent with administrative data,\n17% of inmates were drug offenders and 53% were vio-\nlent offenders. Inmates spent an average of 14 h in work\nassignment during the past week with a range from 0 h\nto 40 h. Finally, the average length of time served to date\nwas 5.45 years with a range from less than one year to\nAnalysis.\nThe analysis was carried out in two parts. First, follow-\ning Goodwin and Andersen (2002), stepwise logistic re-\ngression models computed adjusted odds ratios and\nidentified the inmate predisposing, enabling, and need\ncorrelates of using health services. This analysis did not\nexplicitly model variation in prison context or adjust for\nthe clustering of individuals into prison, but the models\nare representative of the overall state prison population\nof men. Model 1 included the predisposing factors and\nvulnerability factors. Next, the enabling factors were\nadded, and then the need factors were added to assess\nany potential mediating effects. If only the need factors\nwere significant in the final model, this would provide\nevidence that use of services is equitably distributed for\nmale inmates.\nSecond, a generalized structural equation model\n(GSEM) was estimated in Stata 13. Structural equation\nmodeling (SEM) is a general modeling framework that\ncan incorporate many common statistical methods in-\ncluding regression, factor analysis, and simultaneous\nequations, among others. This approach allows for the\nassessment of mediation effects (indirect pathways) that\nare estimated and tested in a single step that is more\nTable 1 Characteristics of study measures (n = 8816)\nMean Std.

For\nmore information including the limitations of GSEM in\nStata see http://www.stata.com/manuals13/semgsem.pdf.\nThis analysis built off the previous analysis to test the\nanalytical model presented in Figure 1. The multilevel\nlogistic regression model tested the direct effects of in-\nmate predisposing, enabling, and need factors on health\nservice use and the indirect effects of inmate predispos-\ning factors on health service use through need. This\nmodel also specified the prison-level predisposing factors\nthat influence health service use by inmates, and\nwhether use of health services varies across prisons. In-\ndirect and total effects were decomposed using the non-\nlinear combination command (nlcom) which provided\nconfidence intervals for the estimates.\nResults\nTable 2 presents the stepwise logistic regression models.\nModel 1 included only the predisposing and vulnerability\np  0.05), having a mood and or anxiety disorder\np  0.01) are associated with use of health services.

Mood/anxiety disorder was comorbid with all\nof conditions except for illness. Overall, mood/anxiety\ndisorder and schizophrenia had the strongest association\namong the health conditions in this study. The patterns\nof co-occurrence among the physical, mental and behav-\nioral health problems were generally maintained in the\nmultivariate models in Table 3. Among the mental and\nbehavioral health vulnerability factors, mood/anxiety\ndisorder emerged an important co-occurring condition\nfor the medical outcomes.\nGiven the potentially strong indirect effects of mood/\nanxiety disorder, the effects on medical care were\ndecomposed (Figure 2). The log odds of mood/anxiety\nMedical need fully mediated this relationship so that the\nlog odds were reduced to -0.07 (n.s.). The indirect ef-\nfects of mood/anxiety disorder through the need factors\nwere calculated as the product of the two direct effects\ninvolved in the mediation. For example, the log odds of\nmood/anxiety disorder on having a medical problem was\n0.69 and the log odds of having a medical problem on\nany health service use was 2.10 for an indirect effect of\nmood/anxiety disorder on any health treatment was\ncalculated by combining the direct effect and the five\nmediation (indirect) effects where the total effect was\nTable 2 Stepwise logistic regression models (n = 8816)\nOR p CI- CI+ OR p CI- CI+ OR p CI- CI+\nPredisposing factors\nVulnerability factors\nEnabling factors\nVisits from family/friends\nPhone calls from family/friends\nNeed factors\nModel fit statistics\nTable 3 Generalized structural equation model (n = 8816)\nOutcome Need Factors\nHealth services Medical problem Illness Dental problem Unintentional injury Intentional injury\nOR p CI- CI+ OR p CI- CI+ OR p CI- CI+ OR p CI- CI+ OR p CI- CI+ OR p CI- CI+\n Need factors\n Predisposing factors\n Vulnerability factors\n Enabling factors\nVisits from family/friends\nPhone Calls from family/friends\nTable 3 Generalized structural equation model (n = 8816) (Continued)\n Prison-level predisposing factors\nthe sum of log odds of the direct and indirect effects.\nThe total effect of mood/anxiety disorder is 2.75\nthe direct effect (OR = 0.93). This means that given vari-\nation in medical problems among inmates with mood/\nanxiety disorder, these inmates had 15 times the odds of\nusing medical services while incarcerated compared to\ninmates without mood/anxiety disorder.\nSimilar to Model 3 in Table 2, the only enabling\nfactors that were significant were years incarcerated\nTable 4 Unadjusted pairwise comorbidity for health conditions (n = 8816)\n1 Medical condition\n6 Mood/anxiety\ndisorder\n8 Alcohol/drug\ndependence\nFig. 2 Log odds of mood/anxiety disorder predicting use of health services including direct, indirect, and total effects. Estimates derived from\ncalls from family/friends in the past week (OR = 1.22,\np  0.05). Finally, two prison-level predisposing factors\naffected use of medical care including proportion black\nation in use of health services across prisons that was\nnot explained by the prison-level predisposing factors\nexamined here. The random effects were reduced from\n0.45 in the baseline model (not shown) after inmate-\nand prison-level factors were accounted for.\nDiscussion\nUsing an adapted version of Andersen's Behavioral\nModel of Health Service Use, this study found that\nneeds did not use health services in prison. Men were\nmost likely to use health services in response to a med-\nical condition or dental problem, and were least likely to\nuse health services for an illness. Men are also less likely\nto seek medical care for an intentional injury compared\nto unintentional injury. This may be due to the serious-\nness of the injuries. It is also possible that inmates are\nhesitant to use health services for intentional injuries for\nfear of getting in trouble with correctional staff. There\nare a number of findings related to prison-level factors\nand inmate-level predisposing and enabling factors that\nwarrant further discussion.\nFirst, inmates in the United States have a constitution-\nally protected right to health care. Therefore, we should\nexpect uniform patterns of utilization across prisons\nafter accounting for need. However, there is significant\nvariation between prisons in rates of health service use\nneed using health services. This indicates that, not even\naccounting for the quality of services, not all inmates are\nhaving their service needs met despite constitutional\nprotections. In other words, the multilevel model shows\nunexplained variation in utilization rates between\nprisons (after controlling for inmate-level differences)\nthat are unexpected given legal mandates in the Unites\nStates. For example, the proportion of violent offenders\nis positively associated with rates of medical care\nutilization. This could indicate differences in availability\nof health services based on security level since violent\noffenders tend to be incarcerated in higher security\nprisons. It was also found that the proportion of black\nmen positively influence use of health services. This may\nbe due to regional or state-level variation since black\nadults are clustered in specific geographic areas which\nshape inmate composition (Mauer & King, 2007; Sakala,\n2014). These findings suggest that (1) where someone is\nincarcerated may influence their ability to access and use\nhealth services; and (2) further analysis is needed to bet-\nter examine the prison context including consideration\nof objective prison enabling factors such as staffing, size\nof prison, and overcrowding. This is especially important\ngiven recent court orders to improve correctional health\ncare delivery within several states (e.g., California,\nArizona). Nevertheless, the findings emphasize that,\noverall, health service utilization in prison cannot be\nfully explained by inmate characteristics.\nSecond, findings indicate that inequalities in use of\nservices while incarcerated seem to be largely driven by\ndifferences in predisposing factors on need. Although\nthis is a promising finding, this particular analysis ad-\ndresses differences in health services use regardless of\nwhy inmates may have differential levels of need. More\nspecifically, research on health service use that takes into\naccount health selection effects is greatly needed. For ex-\nample, after adjusting for differences in need, black men\nare significantly more likely to utilize treatment com-\npared to white men. These findings suggest that prisons\nmay be an important site for healthcare for black men in\nU.S. society given their low levels of access to healthcare\noutside of prison and their high rates of incarceration\n(see also (Nowotny & Kathryn, 2015)). Research has\nconsistently documented black-white disparities in\nhealthcare for noninstitutionalized adults (Hayward,\nexample, a 2007 Kaiser Family Foundation report provides\nevidence for racial differences in health insurance cover-\nage, access to primary care, and treatment for specific\nmedical conditions (James et al., 2007). Some studies find\nthat racial disparities persist even after adjustment for\nsocioeconomic differences and other healthcare-related\nfactors (Kressin & Petersen, 2001; Mayberry, Mili, & Ofili,\n2000). It may be that the reversal of the disparity in\nprisons is due to black men's motivation to seek care given\ntheir limited ability to access care in the community.\nAmong the vulnerability factors, inmates with mood/\nanxiety disorder are more likely to have medical need. In\ntotal, inmates with mood/anxiety disorder are 15 times\nmore likely to use health services in prison. It is\nespecially concerning that inmates with mood/anxiety\ndisorder have higher odds of experiencing both uninten-\ntional and intentional injuries while incarcerated. This\nspeaks to the vulnerability of inmates with mental health\nproblems. Schizophrenia does not follow this pattern,\nhowever, which may be attributed to different housing\nchoices for men with schizophrenia. These findings\nsuggest that (1) clinicians providing services to patients\nin correctional settings need to be trained on how to\nprovide effective health care to individuals living with\nmood/anxiety disorder; (2) it may be necessary to pro-\nvide comprehensive integrated (psychological/medical)\ncare services to these inmates; and (3) prisons may not\nbe safe places for persons living with mood/anxiety\ndisorder.\nThe only enabling factor that was significant is phone\ncalls from family and friends. Thus, social support may\nbe an important factor for encouraging inmates to use\nhealth services. Including additional indicators of sub-\njective social support in future studies may help to better\nunderstand how extra-prison social bonds influence use\nof health services behind bars. Enabling factors, in gen-\neral, are important because they can be modified (unlike\npredisposing factors). For example, prisons can decrease\nbarriers to maintain extra prison social bonds or provide\nsupport for family reunification efforts.\nConceptually, the varying patterns of health service\nuse across prisons suggest that incarceration is a social\ncircumstance that shapes health differentials (Galea &\nVlahov, 2002). For example, previous attempts at under-\nstanding use of health services in prison focused only on\ninmate-level predisposing and mediating (enabling)\nfactors even though criminological research has consist-\nently documented that the prison environment is an im-\nportant determinant of inmate behavior including use of\nhealth services as suggested by Anno (1997). This study\nfinds that there is a significant and troubling variation\nacross U.S. prisons in terms of health service use. More-\nover, there are both direct and indirect effects of this\nvariation. Wacquant (2000) argues that healthcare in\nprison may act as a \"stabilizing and restorative force,\"\nand black men are more likely to utilize health services\nwhich has the potential to improve health for the high\nproportion of black men cycled through U.S. prisons. In\nfact, research documents a mortality advantage for black\nmen who are incarcerated (Rosen, Wohl, & Schoenbach,\n2011; Wildeman, Carson, Golinelli, Noonan, & Emanuel,\n2016). Unfortunately, this study cannot account for the\nquality of services or differential adherence, and any\nhealth benefit afforded in prisons may be outweighed by\nthe long-term health consequences of incarceration\n(Massoglia, 2008; Massoglia, Pare, Schnittker, & Gagnon,\nistrative data from New York and found a dose-response\nof time serviced in prison on mortality. Each additional\nyear served in prison produced a 15.6% increase in the\nodds of death for parolees, which translates to a 2-year\ndecline in life expectancy for each year served.\nThere are a number of important study limitations to\nconsider. First, this study relies on self-reported health\nconditions. However, self-report data are an essential\nand commonly used source of health indicators in re-\nsearch (Stone et al., 1999), and the SISCF is the best data\nset available to answer the research question because it\nis the only large, nationally representative survey of\ninmates available in the United States. It has also been\nargued that individuals must perceive a need for the\nutilization of health services (de Boer, Wijker, & de Haes,\ndata are cross-sectional and do not provide information\non onset of health conditions. That is, this study is un-\nable to account for the timing of diagnosis or the sever-\nity of symptoms and the timing or quality of care. The\ndata are further limited since there is no way to intro-\nduce objective prison-level and state-level controls and\nmust rely on aggregate measures of composition. It is\npossible that this study has mistakenly assigned variation\nin inmate medical care usage to prison-level variables ra-\nther than differences in custody classification within\nprisons (Worrall & Morris, 2011). This study does not\ncontrol for selection effects \u00ad neither selection into\nprison nor selection into need for treatment. Future re-\nsearch should examine selection processes and within\nprison differences in inmate health behaviors. Finally, fu-\nture research should give particular attention to incar-\ncerated women because incarcerated women have worse\nand lower programming availability (Eliason, Taylor, &\nWilliams, 2004) compared to incarcerated men, and\nwomen's prisons often struggle to meet the healthcare\nneeds of women (Delgado & Humm-Delgado, 2008;\nEliason et al., 2004). Therefore, the experience of in-\ncarcerated women is shaped by distinct structural\nprocesses.\nConclusion\nEven though these data are more than ten years old, this\nstudy makes a theoretical contribution by applying the\nbehavioral model of health services use for vulnerable\npopulations to prisons. Future research should apply this\nmodel to other types of health service outcomes relevant\nfor inmates such as use of drug treatment services and\nincorporate objective prison-level factors. It is also pos-\nsible that predisposing, enabling, and prison-level factors\noperate differently for women in prison, and for other\nenvironments such as federal prisons and local county\njails. Nevertheless, this study documents the direct and\nindirect effects of inmate characteristics and vulnerabil-\nities on use of health services in men's prisons, as well\nas the direct effects of the prison enabling and prison-\nlevel factors, across multiple types of medical need.\nNotes\n1A \"serious\" medical need is defined as \"the existence of\nan injury that a reasonable doctor or patient would find\nimportant and worthy of comment or treatment; the\npresence of a medical condition that significantly affects\nan individual's daily activities; or the existence of chronic\nand substantial pain are examples of indications that a\nprisoner has a `serious' need for medical treatment\"\nsample size available from BJS is 14,499 persons. In this\nstudy, 27 respondents were dropped because they were\nless than 18 years of age. The number of females\ndropped is 2927, and the number of individuals who are\na medical problem (as defined in this study) and there-\nfore had no information on the outcome of interest be-\ncause of the skip patterns built into the survey. This\nleaves a sample of 9191 men who meet the study cri-\nteria. 375 of these men have missing information on at\nleast one variable included in the study, which is less\nthan 5%. The listwise deletion leaves the final sample\nmates per prison; range 3 to 62. Only three prisons have\nless than 10 inmates. 3BJS recommendations for sample\nsurvey weights were followed for all single level analyses.\nSampling weights were scaled for multilevel analysis in\nStata following Chantala, Blanchette, & Suchindran,\n2011. 4\"Medical care\" in this study is used as a general\nterm to differentiate from mental and behavioral health\nservices. 5Reported current problems with at least one of\nthe following conditions: heart problems, diabetes,\nhypertension, cancer, asthma, and kidney problems.\n"
