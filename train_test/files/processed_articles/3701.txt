A recent addition to the scholarship on this crucial question of the relationship of markets and\npolitics, Bellinger and Arce (2011), concludes that economic liberalization does have this effect, working to repoliticize\ncollective actors and reinvigorate democracy. We reexamine the article's analyses and demonstrate that they misinterpret\nthe marginal effect of the variables of theoretical interest. Thus, the article's optimistic claims about the consequences\nfor democracy of economic liberalization in the region are not supported by its own empirical results. It is argued here\nthat its results suggest instead that protests became more common in autocracies when they moved away from markets.\nRather than speaking to how people have mobilized to protest against liberal reforms in Latin America's democracies,\nthe work's analyses illuminate only when people protested against the region's dictatorships.\n",

Not surpris-\ningly, the relationship between these two processes has\nbeen intensely debated (see, e.g., Huber and Solt, 2004;\nWalton 2004). Many have argued that economic liberaliza-\ntion, by shifting decision-making power on a wide variety\nof matters from state to market, has limited and undercut\ndemocratic governance and so worked to demobilize civil\nsociety (see, e.g., Kurtz, 2004). Others have contended that\nthe hardships imposed by liberalization have in fact rein-\nvigorated democracy by spurring a variety of societal actors\nto organize themselves and mobilize against neoliberal\nreforms (see, e.g., Silva, 2009). Determining which of these\nperspectives more accurately depicts the relationship\nbetween economic liberalization and collective political\naction in Latin American democracies is central to under-\nstanding if market liberalism has successfully redefined\ncitizenship rights as exclusively political or if instead col-\nlective actors are broadening the concept of democratic\ncitizenship to include social and economic rights. It speaks,\nin other words, to the question of which side of Polanyi's\n(1944) `double movement' has gained the upper hand\nacross the region (see, e.g., Roberts, 2008).\nBellinger and Arce (2011), in their article entitled\n`Protest and democracy in Latin America's market era',\nprovide the broadest empirical examination yet conducted\non this question, examining the impacts of economic liber-\nalization on protest in seventeen Latin American countries\nabove, the repoliticization thesis, maintaining that griev-\nances resulting from economic liberalization provide strong\nframing opportunities for diverse social actors to overcome\ntheir collective action problems and that, in the favorable\nNeoliberal reform and protest in Latin\nAmerican democracies: A replication\nand correction\nFrederick Solt1, Dongkyu Kim1, Kyu Young Lee1, Spencer\nWillardson2 and Seokdong Kim3\n Keywords\nNeoliberal reform, political protest, Latin America\n1University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA\n2Nazarbayev University\n3Sungkyunkwan University\nCorresponding author:\nFrederick Solt, University of Iowa, 341 Schaeffer Hall, Iowa City, IA\nEmail: frederick-solt@uiowa.edu\nResearch Article\n2 Research and Politics \npolitical opportunity provided by democracy, the result will\nbe more protest.

The article is also an exemplar of sensitivity analysis,\noperationalizing both regime type and protest in a number\nof different ways and demonstrating similar results across\nall specifications. Finally, it usefully sharpens the concept\nof economic liberalization to better match the theories sug-\ngested by qualitative studies on the topic. In contrast to ear-\nlier cross-national work, which investigated whether protest\nwas associated with the level of liberal economic policies,\nactors `respond to changes in economic policy' because\narguments regarding the phenomenon focus `on the societal\neffects of economic reforms, not the level of economic lib-\neralization generally'.\nDespite these important contributions, our re-analysis\nreveals that the claims by Bellinger and Arce (2011) are\nbased on an incorrect interpretation of its statistical results.\nSpecifically, the study runs into two pitfalls often encoun-\ntered in the use of multiplicative interaction terms: it incor-\nrectly interprets the coefficients separately and fails to\ncalculate correctly the marginal effect of the variable of\ntheoretical interest (see, e.g., Braumoeller, 2004; Brambor\net al., 2006). Remedying these issues demonstrates that\nthere is no support for the contention that economic liber-\nalization produces higher rates of collective political pro-\ntests in democratic or semidemocratic settings, dampening\nhopes that unfettered markets and democracy are proving a\nfelicitous combination in Latin America.\nReplication, results and\nreinterpretation\nAccording to the repoliticization theory, protest in Latin\nAmerica results from a confluence of motive and opportunity\ntion, in this view, always generates grievances that motivate\npeople to collective action. These grievances are more likely\nto actually cause protests to occur, however, when democracy\nis present to provide a favorable political opportunity struc-\nture. The implication is that, at least in democracies, protests\nshould increase as liberalizing reforms increase. The article\nclaims that the evidence it presents supports this argument.\nThis claim is incorrect.\nThe faulty claim stems from the interpretation of multi-\nplicative interaction terms. The analyses presented use\nnegative binomial regression \u00ad a method that logarithmi-\ncally transforms the dependent variable to account for the\nskewed distributions commonly found in count data \u00ad to\nestimate the following equation:\nlog Protest Economic Reform\nDemocracy\nEconomic Libera\n( ) =\n+\n+\n\n\n\nl\nlization\nDemocracy\nSemidemocracy\nEconomic Liberalizati\n\u00d7\n+\n+\n\n\no\non\nSemidemocracy\nX\n\u00d7\n+ +\n \nIn this equation, 3\n, the coefficients for the two\nmultiplicative interaction terms, allow the effect of eco-\nnomic liberalization on protest to vary with regime type:\ndemocracy, semidemocracy, or autocracy.1 These multipli-\ncative interaction terms are completely appropriate. That\nprotests should become more common as economic reforms\nintensify and especially so in democratic (and, perhaps,\nsemidemocratic) settings is, of course, a conditional hypoth-\nesis, and it is `well established that the intuition behind con-\nditional hypotheses is captured quite well by multiplicative\nIt is equally well established that models containing\nmultiplicative interaction terms require particular care in\ninterpretation (see, e.g., Braumoeller, 2004; Brambor et al.,\n2006). Here, the article's conclusions were justified on two\nfoundations: first, that `the interaction terms \u00ad Economic\nLiberalization \u00d7 Democracy and Economic Liberalization\n\u00d7 Semidemocracy --are positive and significant' and, sec-\nond, that the conditional `coefficients for Democracy and\nSemidemocracy grow larger, more positive, and statisti-\ncally significant when economic liberalization increases'\nNeither of these two foundations is up to the task. The\nformer is insufficient to support the conclusion: as Brambor\net al., (2006: 74) note, the `analyst cannot even infer whether\nX has a meaningful conditional effect on Y from the magni-\ntude and significance of the coefficient on the interaction\nterm'. We show below that the coefficient of the interaction\nSolt et al. 3\nterm is only one component of the effect being examined\nhere. The latter is not directly relevant to the question at\nhand. Given that the study is `primarily concerned with how\ncollective actors respond to economic liberalization in vary-\nthe coefficient of Economic Liberalization for each regime\ntype that is much more to the point.\nA reinterpretation of these results is therefore needed.2\nThe marginal effect of economic liberalization on the\nlogged number of protests (recall that negative binomial\nregressions directly estimate the effects of independent\nvariables on the log of the dependent variable) is found by\ntaking the partial derivative of Equation 1 with respect to\neconomic liberalization:\n\n\n= + \u00d7\n+ \u00d7\nlog Protest\nEconomic Liberalization\nDemocracy\nSe\n( )\n \n\nm\nmidemocracy\nThat is, the estimated effect on logged protest of a\nchange in economic liberalization equals the sum of (1) the\nestimated coefficient of economic liberalization, 1\nproduct of the coefficient of the interaction between liber-\nalization and democracy, 3\n, and the indicator variable for\ndemocracy, and (3) the product of the coefficient of the\ninteraction between liberalization and semidemocracy, 5\n,\nand the indicator variable for semidemocracy. This simpli-\nfies to the sum 1\nfor democratic regimes, to the sum 1\nfor semidemocracies, and to just 1\nfor autocratic\nregimes. This last point makes clear the only appropriate\ninterpretation of 3\n: they represent not the effects of\nEconomic Liberalization in democracies and semidemocra-\nrather only the difference in the effect of Economic\nLiberalization from its effect in the reference category,\nautocratic regimes.\nCalculating the magnitude of the effect in each of the\nthree regime types is straightforward, but the standard error\n(and statistical significance) of only the reference category,\nautocratic regimes, can be determined from the information\nprovided in the article's tables. The formula for the stand-\nard error for democratic regimes is:\nSE var var cov\n \n   \n+\n= + +\n( ) ( ) ( , ) (3)\nSimilarly, the standard error for semidemocratic regimes\nis calculated as:\nSE var var cov\n \n   \n+\n= + +\n( ) ( ) ( , ) (4)\nAlthough the variances of 1\nare easily found\nin the article's tables \u00ad they are the squares of the standard\nerrors for these coefficients \u00ad the covariances between the\ncoefficients are not available from the information provided\nin a regression table: instead, the full variance-covariance\nmatrix is needed.\nAs a practical matter, the most straightforward approach\nto finding these standard errors is a trivial re-specification\nof the model: the choice of reference category for a categor-\nical variable is arbitrary, and the standard error of the coef-\nficient for the reference category chosen is directly available\nable for democracies in Equation 1 with a dummy variable\nfor autocratic regimes \u00ad that is, making democracy the ref-\nerence category \u00ad makes no substantive change in the\nmodel, but the reported coefficient and standard error of\nEconomic Liberalization in this re-specified model (corre-\nsponding to 1\nin the equations above) represent its effect in\ndemocracies. The standard error and statistical significance\nof the effect of Economic Liberalization in semidemocra-\ncies can be found similarly, by including dummy variables\nfor autocracies and democracies and so making semidem-\nocracy the reference category.\nUsing a dot-and-whisker plot (see Kastellec and Leoni,\nconfidence intervals of the effect of economic liberalization\non the logged number of protests for each regime type when\ncountries are classified according to Freedom House data.3\nTable 1.

As Bellinger\nandArce (2011) demonstrate, and our replication confirmed,\na variety of other measures of regime type yield substan-\ntively similar results; we therefore relegate these results to\nthe appendix. Figure 1 displays how the results of the nega-\ntive binomial regressions indicate that economic liberaliza-\ntion does not have a statistically significant effect on protest:\nthis is true whether we look at the total number of protests\n(Model 1 of Bellinger and Arce (2011)), or strikes (Model\n9), or riots (Model 12), or anti-government demonstra-\ntions (Model 15). The results show that in autocracies the\nliberalizing reform variable was statistically significantly\nassociated with fewer protests, with the exception of dem-\nonstrations. In light of this finding, the fact that 3\nare\nestimated to be positive and statistically significant reveals\nonly that more liberalizing reform in democracies and semi-\ndemocracies did not have the negative association with pro-\ntest that it did in autocracies, not that it served as a focal\npoint for the formation and mobilization of collective actors\nas the repoliticization theory would have it.\nWe, of course, are more directly interested in the effect\nof economic reforms on the number of protests, not on the\nlog of protests and, as noted above, the latter is the quantity\nestimated by the negative binomial regression employed in\nBellinger and Arce (2011). Figure 2 presents the number of\nprotests in autocracies, semidemocracies, and democracies\npredicted by the four models across the observed range of\neconomic liberalization when all other variables are fixed\nat their mean values. In each case, the solid lines indicate\nthe predicted number of protests and the shaded regions\ncorrespond to the 95% confidence intervals of these predic-\ntions. For autocracies, the numbers of total protests, strikes\nand riots (but not demonstrations) are predicted to be statis-\ntically significantly lower as liberalizing reform increases.\nFor semidemocracies and democracies, the wide\nconfidence intervals in every panel can easily encompass a\nhorizontal line representing no change at all in protest\nactivity over the range of economic liberalization. In fact,\nunder these conditions, in semidemocracies the point pre-\ndictions of all four measures of protest decline with rising\nliberalization, and in democracies riots are also predicted to\nfall as economic liberalization rises. None of this supports\nthe interpretation that `collective political activity rises\nwith economic liberalization in democratic and semidemo-\nAn extension: Protest and liberal\neconomic reform\nThe results of Bellinger and Arce (2011) do not support the\ninterpretation offered in that article. Liberalizing economic\nreforms in democracies do not in fact predict that more pro-\ntests occur. The conclusion that they do, as we have shown\nabove, was based on common misinterpretations of multi-\nplicative interaction terms. The confusion regarding the\napplication of multiplicative interaction terms is com-\npounded by the article's measure of liberalizing reform.\nAsecond look at Figure 2 reveals that liberalizing reform\nonly has statistically significant effects on protest in auto-\ncratic settings and that these effects occur largely, if not\nentirely, across only the negative values of the variable. As\ndiscussed above, however, the Bellinger and Arce (2011)\nmeasure of liberalizing reform represents change in the\nlevel of economic liberalization. Positive values represent\nreforms that increase the role of free markets and reduce the\nrole of the state in the economy. Negative values, in turn,\nrepresent moves away from free markets; that is, statist\nreforms. Including both liberal reforms and statist reforms\nin the same measure in this way constrains them to have\nequal and opposite effects on protest. Given that changes in\neither direction may generate losers with incentives to\nmobilize, to assume that reforms in one direction increase\nprotests and reforms in the other reduce them would seem\nunwise. Further, nothing in the repoliticization theory sug-\ngests that the effect of liberal reforms is the opposite of\nstatist reforms.\nRemoving this constraint is easily accomplished by\nsplitting the measure into two variables. The first measures\nthe magnitude of liberal reforms and takes on a value of\nzero when statist reforms are adopted; the second measures\nthe magnitude of statist reforms and takes on a value of\nzero when liberal reforms are adopted. Table 2 presents the\nrelevant results when these two variables are substituted for\nthe original liberalizing reforms measure in the Bellinger\nThe coefficients for the interaction term between liberal\nreform and democracy indicate that there is no statistically\nsignificant difference between autocracies and democracies\nin the coefficient of liberal reform for total protests, strikes,\nor antigovernment demonstrations.

Figure 3 displays the\ncoefficients and standard errors of liberal and statist eco-\nnomic reforms in all three regime types.\nIt reveals that the estimated coefficient for liberal reforms\nin democracies on riots is in fact negative and not distin-\nguishable from zero.

Moreover, the predicted difference in the\nactual quantity of interest, the number of demonstrations,\nbetween a country with no liberal reform and one with the\nlargest observed liberal reform is small and not statistically\nsignificant: 0.9 \u00b1 1.0 demonstrations, as can be seen in\nFigure 4. Like those for the other measures of protest, the\nconfidence interval for the predicted number of demonstra-\ntions in democracies can accommodate a horizontal line\nrepresenting no change at all over the full observed range of\nliberal reform.\nIf, as we have demonstrated, the results of Bellinger and\nArce (2011) and our extension to it do not support the repo-\nliticization theory, what do they show? A re-examination of\nFigure 2 reveals that liberalizing reform, measured as a sin-\ngle variable, only has statistically significant effects on pro-\ntest in autocratic settings and that these effects occur\nlargely, if not entirely, across only the negative values of\nthe variable. This point is confirmed in Figure 3: when lib-\neral and statist reforms are measured separately, the posi-\ntive and statistically significant coefficients for statist\nreforms in autocracies stand out as the only consistent\nresults. Figure 5 confirms these effects on the actual quanti-\nties of interest, the number of protests, over the observed\nrange of statist reform.\nRather than speaking to how people have mobilized to\nprotest against liberal reforms in Latin America's democra-\ncies, then, these results illuminate when people protested\nagainst the region's dictatorships. Latin American autocra-\ncies frequently pursued a two-pronged strategy of depoliti-\ncization, pairing free market reforms of the economy with\nharsh repression of civil society. It was when these regimes\nbacked away from free market policies \u00ad a signal that divi-\nsions had arisen in the authoritarian coalition of the mili-\ntary, domestic business, and foreign capital \u00ad that\nemboldened citizens went to the streets to protest.\nChile under Pinochet is the paradigmatic example on\nboth counts. When its program of nearly complete financial\nderegulation led to financial crisis in 1982, the military\ngovernment abruptly reversed course and intervened exten-\nsively in the Chilean economy. Dubbed by critics the\n`Chicago Road to Socialism' in mocking reference to the\nVia Chilena that the Pinochet government had worked to\neradicate, the statist reforms in Chile in 1983 are second in\nsize in the Bellinger and Arce (2011) data only to those that\nmarked the return of Peronism to Argentina in 1973.\nMassive demonstrations followed this sign of the\nFigure 3.

The repoliticization theory suggests that liberal-\nizing reforms should, in democratic settings, provoke pro-\ntests. In a critical re-analysis of the empirical evidence\noffered, we reveal that they do not. There is no support for\nthe conclusion that liberalizing reforms produce political\nprotests in Latin America's democratic or semidemocratic\nregimes. Instead, this evidence indicates only that protests\nwere only triggered by statist reforms in Latin American\nautocracies.\nThat economic liberalization may not consistently pro-\nvoke protest in democracies should not come as a surprise.\nship on resistance and acquiescence to neoliberal reforms\nin Latin America concludes, `Liberalization does not create\nhomogeneous interests, hardships, or insecurities among\nsubaltern groups, and neither does it generate a uniform\nresponse'. Future work on the issue should focus on eluci-\ndating the conditions in which liberalizing reform by demo-\ncratic governments generates collective protest.\nOne particularly important facet of this research will be\nthe collection of higher quality data on protest across the\nregion.

In the bottom panel, the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval never crosses zero on the y-axis, indicating that\nthe positive coefficients for economic liberalization estimated at higher, more democratic levels of the FH Civil Liberties Index fail to reach statistical\nsignificance.\n12 Research and Politics \nFigure 9.
