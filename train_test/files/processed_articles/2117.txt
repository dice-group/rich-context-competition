Bloch MD2\nLongitudinal data from the National Health and\nNutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) demon-\nof uncontrolled hypertension has declined. However,\nthere is still considerable room for improvement\nsenting approximately 33 million Americans, did not\nhave adequate blood pressure (BP) control\n(<140/90 mm Hg). The largest group of patients with\npoorly controlled hypertension were those who\nond largest group were those who were treated with\nonly 1 or 2 antihypertensive medications (34.4% in\ntension, defined as poor control despite at least 3 anti-\nhypertensive medications, was the third largest group\nand found in 28.0% of uncontrolled hypertensives\ntions. These data demonstrate that the majority of\npatients with uncontrolled hypertension are usually\nuntreated or undertreated and not necessarily resistant\nto treatment. Future population-based strategies to\nimprove BP control needs to focus on improving\naccess to care and raising awareness of hypertension in\nthose who infrequently seek primary care. In addition,\novercoming therapeutic inertia by adding antihyperten-\nsive medications and intensifying treatment appears\nimportant if we are to further improve BP control.\npopulation was undertaken by the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention. Known as NHANES, these\nsurveys used stratified multistage probability sampling\non the noninstitutionalized US population who were\nasked to self-report information about a number of\nchronic medical conditions and health-related behav-\niors. In addition, each participant had their BP mea-\nsured in standardized fashion by trained study\npersonnel and had basic laboratory studies performed,\nincluding lipid panels, measurement of renal function,\nand fasting blood glucose. Hypertension was defined\nas a systolic BP at least 140 mm Hg, a diastolic BP at\nleast 90 mm Hg, or a positive response to the question\n``Are you currently taking medication to lower your\nBP.'' Awareness, current treatment of hypertension,\nand number of medications were all self-reported on\nthe basis of standard queries. Control of hypertension\nwas defined as a systolic BP <140 mm Hg and a\ndiastolic BP <90 mm Hg.\nTherapeutic inertia was arbitrarily defined and strat-\nified according to prespecified criteria that took into\naccount the level of BP control, the number of health\ncare provider visits in the past year, the number of\nmedications being taken, and the underlying cardio-\nvascular risk. Because medication dose and adherence\nto therapy is not captured in NHANES, the term\napparent treatment resistant hypertension (aTRH) was\nused and defined as uncontrolled hypertension despite\nthe use of at least 3 antihypertensive medications. The\ninvestigators focused on those with uncontrolled\nhypertension and identified 3 key groups: (1) untreated\nhypertensives, (2) hypertensives taking 1 or 2 medica-\ntions, and (3) aTRH. The authors used standard statis-\ntical tools to identify key characteristics that were\nsignificantly associated with each group.--Egan BM,\nZhao Y, Axon RN, et al. Uncontrolled and apparent\ntreatment resistant hypertension in the United States\nOverall, the proportion of patients with uncontrolled\nsex, black race, and Hispanic ethnicity were associated\nwith poor BP control. Uncontrolled hypertensives were\nmore likely to have only 0 or 1 health care visits annu-\nally, while controlled hypertensives were more likely to\nhave at least 4 health care visits per year. Among\npatients with uncontrolled hypertension, the proportion\nof uninsured patients increased over time. Additionally,\nthe prevalence of diabetes was higher in controlled\nrather than uncontrolled patients. These data suggest\nthat having an identified reason to access health care,\nboth in terms of expanding insurance coverage and\nrequiring a greater frequency of contacts with a health\ncare provider, has an impact on improving BP control.\nFocus on Untreated Hypertension\nThe likelihood of being treated for hypertension rose\nthan 50% of uncontrolled patients were untreated.\nRoughly two thirds of these untreated hypertensives\nFrom the Seinsheimer Cardiovascular Health Program, Medical University\nof South Carolina, Ralph H.

The particular design\nof the NHANES, where hypertension was often defined\nbased on BP readings from a single study visit, may\nhave overestimated the incidence of hypertension and\nparticularly untreated hypertension. Nonetheless, even\ntaking this into account, it would appear that lack of\ntreatment (and even awareness) of hypertension is the\nmost common reason for poor BP control.\nAmong this group of untreated hypertensives, infre-\nquent contact with a health care provider was a major\nissue as approximately 40% reported having 0 or 1\nvisits to a health care provider annually. Furthermore,\nmany patients with hypertension lack insurance and\ncannot afford the visits to a health care provider\nand/or the cost of antihypertensive medications. In\naddition, since hypertension is largely an asymptom-\natic condition, even people with access to affordable\nhealth care without other medical issues that often\nprompt health care screening, such as young men, may\nnot have their BP measured regularly.\nIn summary, these data suggest that changes in pub-\nlic health policy and health care delivery could lead to\nsubstantial improvements in BP control. In addition\nto expanding health insurance coverage and access to\naffordable medications, increased BP screenings, par-\nticularly in less traditional settings where young men\nare more likely to gather (ie, work sites, barbershops,\ngrocery stores, pharmacies) and public health cam-\npaigns focusing on the importance of BP measurement\nand control may be among the most important and\ncost-effective ways to improve BP control rates.\nFocus on Treated Hypertensives Treated With 1 or\n2 Antihypertensive Medications\nThe second largest group of uncontrolled hypertensives\nin NHANES were those treated with only 1 or 2 medi-\ncations, representing about one third of the total in\neach of the NHANES examination time periods. By\ndefinition, this group of patients has inadequately\ntreated hypertension. Whereas infrequent contact with\na health care provider was a frequent characteristic of\nthose with untreated hypertension, in this group treat-\nleast 2 visits annually with a provider.\nThese data suggest that therapeutic inertia, the fail-\nure to intensify therapy in the face of poorly con-\ntrolled hypertension, appears to be the primary\ndriving force in this group. Degree of therapeutic\ninertia, as defined somewhat arbitrarily for the pur-\nposes of this study, was found in more than 50% of\nthese patients.\nThe authors of this report suggest that therapeutic\ninertia is not a provider-only trait, but a reflection of\nthe provider-patient interaction. We believe it is really\nthe result of the complex interactions between patient,\nprovider, and other components of the health care\ndelivery system, including health plans, formularies,\npharmacies, and governmental agencies. Multiple stud-\nies have identified that therapeutic inertia is a major\ncontributor to poor BP control, and awareness of the\nissue to date does not appear to have led to major\nimprovements in control. In order to better overcome\ntherapeutic inertia, we need to work towards develop-\ning systems of care that appropriately align incentives\nacross the spectrum of health care delivery and award\nquality. Overcoming therapeutic inertia (ie, intensify-\ning therapy in the setting of poorly controlled hyper-\ntension) should be considered a variable in emerging\npay-for-performance models.\nFocus on Apparently Treatment-Resistant\nHypertension\nAlthough definitions vary, resistant hypertension is gen-\nerally defined as uncontrolled hypertension in the set-\nting of at least 3 well-chosen, adequately dosed\nmedications or BP that is controlled using at least 4\nmedications. Since the NHANES database has only lim-\nited data regarding antihypertensive medication adher-\nence and dose, it is not possible to adequately define\nthe exact proportion of patients who are treatment-\nresistant, hence the use of the term apparent treatment\nresistant. Over time, the proportion of uncontrolled\nthese patients may have the white-coat effect or poor\nadherence rather than true treatment resistance.\nWhile it appears to be less common than untreated\nor inadequately treated hypertension, aTRH remains\nan important issue. Other studies have demonstrated\nthat these patients are at significant risk for cardiovas-\ncular events and may gain substantial clinical benefit\nfrom improved BP control. In multivariate analyses,\nclinical factors associated with aTRH-apparent, treat-\nment-resistant hypertension in NHANES include infre-\nquent health care visits and the presence of obesity,\nchronic kidney disease, or a high Framingham risk\nscore. One particular issue that was highlighted in this\npaper is the infrequent use of spironolactone in this\npatient population.\nHopefully, the Eighth Report of the Joint National\nCommittee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and\nTreatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 8) will pro-\nvide clinicians with more comprehensive guidance on\nhow to better use appropriate combinations of antihy-\npertensive medications in patients with poorly\ncontrolled hypertension. Additionally, the continued\ndevelopment of novel device interventions aimed at\ntreatment-resistant hypertension, including barorecep-\ntor modulation and renal sympathetic denervation,\nmay prove beneficial.\nThe NHANES investigators have provided us with a\nrelatively complete snapshot of what the population of\npatients with poorly controlled hypertension look like.\nIt is now up to us as clinicians and policy makers to\ndevelop the best strategies to improve BP control\nbased on these findings.\n268 The Journal of Clinical Hypertension Vol 14 | No 4 | April 2012 Official Journal of the American Society of Hypertension, Inc.\n"
