We hypothesize that those most harmed\nby corruption--the socioeconomically disadvantaged--should perceive corruption to be more frequent. Using multiple\ncross-national surveys, we find that the poor and the uneducated tend to perceive higher levels of corruption than the\nwealthy and the well educated.

Individuals often perceive the\nsame phenomenon differently, whether it is the health of the\neconomy (Duch et al., 2000) or the number of war casualties\n(Berinsky, 2007). Perceptions of corruption should be no\ndifferent, particularly since corruption is an illicit phenom-\nenon that is typically concealed and therefore difficult to\nmeasure. Most explanations privilege attitudes and predis-\npositions, such as partisanship (Anduiza et al., 2013; Davis\net al., 2004), support for the incumbent government\n2008), and ideological leanings (Razafindrakoto and\nRoubaud, 2010). In this article, we focus on socioeconomic\nstatus, a variable directly related to corruption's ill effects.\nWe hypothesize that those who are most harmed by corrup-\ntion, the socioeconomically disadvantaged, will tend to per-\nceive higher levels of corruption. Using surveys from\ndozens of countries and multiple data sources, we find\nrobust evidence in support of this hypothesis, but only in\nadvanced countries. In lower- and middle-income countries,\nthe negative relationship between socioeconomic status and\ncorruption perceptions is weaker and less consistent.\nUnderstanding how socioeconomic status relates to cor-\nruption perceptions is important for two reasons. First, absent\nhigh-quality cross-national indicators of corruption, scholars\nfrequently use perception-based measures as proxies for\nactual corruption. Knowing how and why corruption percep-\ntions systematically vary across individuals is essential for\nunderstanding potential biases in these perception-based\nmeasures. Second, identifying who in a society perceives\nmore or less corruption matters because perceptions moti-\nvate behavior, irrespective of their accuracy (Gerber and\nHuber, 2009). Beliefs that corruption is widespread diminish\ntrust in government and other members of society (Chang\ncal participation (Cover, 2007), and influence vote choice\n(Slomczynski and Shabad, 2012). Thus, knowing which\nsocioeconomic groups are likely to perceive more corruption\ncan shed light on patterns of mass political behavior and\nexplain why a phenomenon like corruption might affect vari-\nous segments of the population differently.\nThe unequal effects of corruption\nMost commonly defined as the \"the misuse of public office\nprises a variety of behaviors, including when politicians and\nbureaucrats steal money and resources from public coffers,\ndemand remuneration from citizens in return for special\nSocioeconomic status and corruption\nperceptions around the world\nKentaro Maeda1 and Adam Ziegfeld2\n Keywords\nCorruption perceptions, attitudes, cross-national\n1Associate Professor, Faculty of Law, University of Tokyo, Japan\n2International Council Assistant Professor of Political Science and\nInternational Affairs, George Washington University, USA\nCorresponding author:\nAdam Ziegfeld, International Council Assistant Professor of Political\nScience and International Affairs, George Washington University, 2115\nEmail: awz@gwu.edu\nResearch Article\n2 Research and Politics \nfavors, or make the provision of government goods and ser-\nvices conditional on the receipt of bribes or votes. Scholars\nfurther distinguish between grand corruption and petty cor-\nruptionoccursinthecourseofcitizens'everydaytransactions\nwith the state, grand corruption typically involves large\nsums of money and the participation of high-level bureau-\ncrats, politicians, and businesspeople.\nPrevious research has argued that corruption dispropor-\ntionately harms the socioeconomically disadvantaged, as it\nexacerbates existing inequalities (Gupta et al., 2002;\nAt an aggregate level, corruption causes higher levels of\nincome inequality and poverty (Gupta et al., 2002), which\nare likely to exert the greatest toll on those who are already\npoor. More specifically, petty corruption harms the socio-\neconomically disadvantaged because the poor are less able\nto pay bribes that are required to access public services.\nFurthermore, petty corruption harms citizens with little\neducation because they are less knowledgeable about how\nthe bureaucracy works and potential recourse should they\nfind themselves asked for bribes, thus making them easy\ntargets for corrupt officials. Grand corruption also harms\nthe poor disproportionately. When corrupt officials steal\npublic funds or the wealthy pay bribes to avoid paying\ntaxes, the state has fewer resources to spend on programs\nthat benefit the poor, such as primary education and welfare\nservices. Bribes to legislators can produce public policy\nthat disproportionately benefits the privileged, such as\nthrough a regressive taxation system. Finally, grand corrup-\ntion can exact a non-material harm on the socioeconomi-\ncally disadvantaged by corroborating beliefs that the\npolitical system is stacked against them, thereby diminish-\ning their feelings of trust in the political system and their\nperceptions of the system's efficacy.\nGiven the disproportionate harm that the socioeconomi-\ncally disadvantaged suffer from corruption, we hypothesize\nthat they should perceive higher levels of corruption. In\nparticular, the poor and the uneducated should perceive\nhigher levels of corruption than the wealthy and the well\neducated. This is not to say that the disadvantaged neces-\nsarily experience corruption more often (though they\nmight), but rather that they are disproportionately harmed\nby corruption.\nAt least three mechanisms explain why disproportionate\nharm should translate into higher levels of perceived cor-\nruption among the socioeconomically disadvantaged. The\nfirst involves the resolution of cognitive dissonance\n(Festinger, 1957). If corruption does someone great harm\nand she consequently cares deeply about it, she may over-\nestimate the frequency of corruption in order to justify her\npreoccupation with it. The second mechanism involves the\nselective consumption of information on corruption. Just as\npeople selectively expose themselves to information that\nreinforces existing political attitudes (Stroud, 2008), they\nmay pay greater attention to information that confirms their\nbeliefs about the gravity of corruption. Knowing that cor-\nruption harms them disproportionately, the disadvantaged\nmay pay more attention to information about corruption\nand therefore recall more instances of it than more socio-\neconomically advantaged citizens. Finally, the third mecha-\nnism involves distinct conceptions of corruption. Citizens\nof lower socioeconomic status often take a more expansive\nview of corruption that encompasses a broad range of\nunethical, but often legal, behaviors in which certain people\nbenefit from favoritism (Johnston, 1986; Redlawsk and\nMcCann, 2005). What the privileged see as normal politics,\nthe disadvantaged may see as corrupt. If those who do not\nbenefit from favoritism treat a wider range of behaviors as\ncorrupt, then they should perceive higher levels of corrup-\ntion than those who define corruption more narrowly. If, for\nthese reasons, the disadvantaged indeed perceive higher\nlevels of corruption, then an individual's income and edu-\ncation should be negatively associated with her beliefs\nabout corruption's pervasiveness.\nSo far, relatively little empirical research has focused on\nthe relationship between socioeconomic status and percep-\ntions of corruption. Studies that include income and educa-\ntion as predictors of corruption perceptions (often as\ncontrols) usually examine one or a handful of countries and\nhave arrived at mixed findings.1 Some have found that the\nperceive more corruption, while others find no relationship\n(Cover, 2007) or that the wealthy and educated perceive\nless corruption (Redlawsk and McCann, 2005; Tverdova,\n2011). By simultaneously analyzing surveys from dozens\nof countries and multiple data sources, we aim to uncover\nbroader patterns in the association between socioeconomic\nstatus and corruption perceptions.\nData\nTo examine whether socioeconomically disadvantaged citi-\nzens tend to perceive higher levels of corruption, we use\ncross-country surveys that ask citizens how they evaluate\ncorruption's frequency in their countries. Specifically, we\nuse Module 2 of the Comparative Study of Electoral\nSystems (CSES), Wave 3 of the World Values Survey\n(WVS), and the 2006 version of the International Social\nSurvey Programme (ISSP).2 Working with multiple sur-\nveys ensures that our findings do not result from idiosyn-\ncrasies inherent in any single survey. In each of these\nsurveys, we use the level of perceived corruption as the\noutcome variable and income and education, as measures\nof socioeconomic status, as the predictors.\nFor the outcome variables, we use the original scales for\nthe 4-point corruption perception variables in CSES and\nWVS and take an average of the two 5-point corruption\nperception variables in ISSP, one about politicians and the\nother about public officials. For the predictors, we use the\nMaeda and Ziegfeld 3\noriginal scales for income and education in CSES and\nWVS. In CSES, the income variable is based on a 5-point\nscale, whereas the education variable is based on an 8-point\nscale. In WVS, the income variable is based on a 10-point\nscale, whereas the education variable is based on an 8-point\nscale. In ISSP, we use the 6-point education variable, but\ntransform the income variable by recoding the national cur-\nrency units into US dollars and taking the log. The major\nchallenge in using multiple surveys is comparability, since\nthe surveys vary in how they measure corruption percep-\ntions, income, and education. In analysis available in the\nonline appendix, we show that the results below do not sub-\nstantively change when we standardize both the predictors\nand the outcome variables.\nAnalysis\nNo-pooling regression\nGiven that richer countries tend to have lower average lev-\nels of perceived corruption than poorer countries (Treisman,\n2000),3 we cannot pool data from multiple countries and\nregress each respondent's level of perceived corruption on\nher income and education. We may wrongly infer that edu-\ncated citizens are more likely to perceive lower levels of\ncorruption, even if no such relationship exists within most\ncountries, because education levels are likely to be higher\nand the mean level of perceived corruption lower in rich\ncountries. Moreover, since previous studies have found dif-\nfering relationships between income, education, and cor-\nruption perceptions in different national contexts, we\ncannot simply assume that the size and magnitude of the\nrelationship between socioeconomic status and corruption\nperceptions are identical across countries.\nWe therefore allow each country to have its own regres-\nsion coefficient, running separate regressions for each\ncountry without pooling the data. In other words, we treat\nthe data for each country j as a separate dataset, and fit the\nfollowing regression model.\ny x\nij j j ij ij\n= + +\n  \nIn this equation, yij\nis the level of corruption perception\nfor an individual i in country j, and xij\nis either her house-\nhold income or level of education. Each country j has its own\nintercept \nand slope parameter \n. In order to estimate\nthese parameters, we fit dozens of regressions--one for each\nof the two predictors in each of our country-level datasets.\nWe note two points about our estimation strategy. First, we\nenter the individual-level predictors separately for each\nregression and mainly focus on the bivariate relationships.\nWe take this minimalist approach because adding individual-\nlevel control variables may induce post-treatment bias if they\nare affected by the predictor of interest (King and Zeng,\n2006). Second, we choose not to fit categorical choice\nmodels. Although the categorical nature of the outcomes\nsuggests that we fit ordered logit or probit models, these\nmodels are most useful for predicting probabilities that are\nclose to either zero or one. In contrast, interpreting how a\nunit difference in the predictor is associated with the out-\ncome of interest is far more straightforward using linear\nchoice models does not substantively alter our results.\nTo illustrate our approach, we take the CSES dataset and\nregress corruption perceptions on household income in\neach country. Figure 1 presents the results. The black cir-\ncles show the estimated coefficients, and the bars show the\n95% confidence intervals. In countries with estimates on\nthe left half of the figure, poorer citizens perceive higher\nlevels of corruption, whereas in the countries on the right\nhalf of the figure, richer citizens perceive corruption to be\nmore widespread. The gray circles in the figure represent\nestimates controlling for education, gender, and age. In a\npreliminary analysis we also added urban residence and\nunemployment but the estimates did not noticeably change.\nSince these variables were not available for many coun-\ntries, we do not include them in the analysis presented here.\nIn analysis presented in the online appendix, we also show\nthat controlling for the ethnicity of the respondent does not\nalter the results.\nThe figure reveals considerable variation across coun-\ntries. In the most extreme case, the coefficient for the\nUnited States is -0.11. This indicates that the level of cor-\nruption perceptions for citizens in the richest quintile is\nlikely to be 0.4 points lower on a 4-point scale than for citi-\nzens in the poorest quintile. This difference represents\nabout half of a standard deviation in the corruption percep-\ntion variable (0.78). Concretely, more than three-quarters\nof American respondents from the poorest quintile consid-\nered corruption to be either \"Quite widespread\" or \"Very\nwidespread,\" while a majority of respondents from the\nrichest quintile perceived corruption to be \"Not very wide-\nspread\" or that \"It doesn't happen at all\".4 This rather strik-\ning disparity in how the two income groups perceive\ncorruption in the United States indicates that our findings\nuncover substantively important variation. A somewhat\nsurprising result is that the addition of control variables for\neducation, gender, and age--none of which should intro-\nduce post-treatment bias--does not drastically change the\nresults. Despite the correlation between the predictor and\nthe control variables, the estimates are roughly the same\nexcept for Finland and Portugal.\nWhen we repeat a similar analysis for WVS and ISSP,\nthe results are remarkably similar to those in Figure 1.\nUsing education instead of income as a predictor also\nshows a similar pattern. On the whole, we find that in most\ncountries, the disadvantaged--those who are poorer and\nless well educated--perceive higher levels of corruption\nthan fellow citizens who are wealthier and better educated.\nHowever, as evident in Figure 1, there is considerable\n4 Research and Politics \nvariation across countries, with some coefficients in the\ndata close to zero or even somewhat positive.\nExploring cross-national variation\nHaving analyzed respondents from each country separately,\nwe find partial support for our hypothesis that the socioeco-\nnomically disadvantaged perceive higher levels of corrup-\ntion. However, like the existing literature, the findings are\nsomewhat mixed, revealing a number of countries where\nthis relationship does not hold. To gain a better handle on\nwhere we do and do not find support for our hypothesis, we\ninvestigate whether the regression coefficients in our previ-\nous analysis vary systematically across countries.\nAlthough existing studies provide relatively little guid-\nance as to why the relationship between socioeconomic sta-\ntus and corruption perceptions should vary cross-nationally,\none exception is Uslaner's (2008) claim about the tight con-\nnection between corruption and inequality. Based on his\nargument, we should expect that the negative association\nbetween socioeconomic status and corruption perceptions\nis particularly strong in highly unequal societies. However,\nas we show in the online appendix, we do not find evidence\nthat fits this prediction. The association between socioeco-\nnomic status and corruption perceptions does not vary\nbased on income inequality.\nEconomic development is another variable that may\nexplain variation in the relationship between socioeconomic\nPhilippines\nSouth Korea\nSpain\nBrazil\nMexico\nPeru\nBulgaria\nFrance\nItaly\nRomania\nPoland\nIsrael\nHungary\nNetherlands\nAlbania\nNew Zealand\nFinland\nIreland\nRussian Federation\nSlovenia\nJapan\nCzech Republic\nGermany(Mail)\nUnited Kingdom\nAustralia\nChile\nHong Kong\nCanada\nSwitzerland\nGermany(Phone)\nSweden\nDenmark\nIceland\nNorway\nUnited States\nRich citizens\nperceive more corruption\nPoor citizens\nperceive more corruption\npooled average\nCoefficients\nFigure 1.

The\nvertical dotted line shows the average across all countries.\nMaeda and Ziegfeld 5\nstatus and corruption perceptions. Countries at varying levels\nof economic development experience not only different lev-\nels, but also different forms, of corruption (Johnston, 2005;\nence less overall corruption and relatively little petty corrup-\ntion, while poorer countries experience more overall\ncorruption, including both grand and petty corruption. This\nvariation in the corruption environment might influence the\nrelationship between socioeconomic disadvantage and cor-\nruption perceptions. Specifically, in wealthier countries where\ngrand corruption is the main form of corruption, corruption's\nharm to the poor may be more obvious. After all, the benefi-\nciaries of grand corruption are invariably those of high socio-\neconomic status. By contrast, the widespread nature of petty\ncorruption in poor countries--in which both rich and poor are\noften implicated--could make the wealthy as sensitive to cor-\nruption as the poor, reducing the statistical relationship\nbetween socioeconomic status and corruption perceptions.\nTo examine this possibility, we compare the regression\ncoefficients obtained from regressing corruption percep-\ntions on income and education across countries at different\nlevels of economic development. For the level of economic\ndevelopment, we use the per capita gross domestic product\n(GDP)--measured as the purchasing power parity (PPP)\nconverted value in US dollars--for each country in the year\nthe survey was conducted based on data from Penn World\nTables 7.0. The results are shown in Figure 2. Per capita\nGDP is plotted on the x-axis, and the regression coefficients\non the y-axis. For each of the datasets, we show the results\nusing income as the predictor in the left panel and educa-\ntion in the right panel. The black circles show the regres-\nsion coefficient in each country, and the bars show the 95%\nconfidence intervals. To indicate the general pattern in the\ndata, we fit a LOWESS line on the estimated coefficients\npredicted by the level of per capita GDP.\nIn Figure 2, a clear pattern emerges. In all of the sub-\ngraphs in this figure, most of the coefficients are negative\n(indicating that the poor and uneducated perceive higher\nlevels of corruption), but these coefficients become much\ncloser to zero and some even become positive in poorer\ncountries. In all of the surveys, the LOWESS line shows a\nnegative slope that intersects the x-axis at low levels of per\ncapita GDP. Whereas in advanced countries, high-income,\nhighly educated citizens tend to perceive lower levels of\ncorruption compared with other citizens, in developing\ncountries, the relationship is much weaker. The pattern for\neach survey is roughly the same if we include the other pre-\ndictors as controls.5\nMultilevel models\nWe repeat the previous analysis with multilevel models to\naddress the concern that differences in the coefficients\nacross levels of economic development may be small\nenough to have been generated by chance (Gelman and\nruption perceptions variables and the socioeconomic status\nvariables in their original scales and fit a multilevel linear\nmodel allowing the intercepts and the slope parameters to\nvary by country. In the context of equation (1), the individ-\nual-level parameters \nand \nare now modeled given\nthe level of per capita GDP as the country-level predictor.\nLeaving the details in the online appendix, we visually dis-\nplay the results here in Figure 3.\nFigure 3 is comparable to Figure 2 except that the graphs\nare based on multilevel models. The regression line shows\nthe predicted marginal effect of income or education on\ncorruption perceptions by a country's level of per capita\nGDP, and the scatterplot shows the predicted regression\ncoefficient of income (left column) or education (right col-\numn) on corruption perception for each country when the\ncountry-level errors are added to the predicted marginal\neffects. The vertical bars show the 95% confidence inter-\nvals. Comparing Figures 2 and 3, the two estimates show a\nroughly similar pattern.\nDiscussion\nWe began with the intuition that those most harmed by cor-\nruption should perceive more of it. Using dozens of surveys\nfrom countries around the world, we found that this intuition\nis correct--but only in affluent countries. In poorer countries,\nthe relationship between income and corruption perceptions\nis much murkier. These findings are remarkably similar\nacross different sources of data, and they are highly robust.\nAn alternative explanation for our findings is that lower-\nincome citizens actually observe more corruption. Given that\npetty corruption involving the average citizen tends to be\nlower in affluent countries (Uslaner, 2008)--where our\nresults are strongest--it seems unlikely that the poor consist-\nently observe more corruption than the rich. However, the\ndata analysis cannot ultimately distinguish between these two\nexplanations, and we cannot therefore rule out the possibility\nthat lower-income citizens' perceptions of greater corruption\nsimply reflect their greater exposure to it.\nNevertheless, our consistent empirical findings have\ntwo important implications. First, studies that employ cor-\nruption perceptions as a proxy for actual corruption should\nbear in mind that perceptions of corruption will vary based\non who is being asked. Importantly, relying on expert opin-\nions implies different biases in different countries, since the\naffluent and educated will systematically perceive less cor-\nruption than the poor and poorly educated mainly in wealthy\ncountries and less so elsewhere. Second, this article con-\ntributes to a growing literature about heterogeneity in indi-\nviduals' perceptions of the world around them. Whereas\nprevious work has focused largely on the impact of atti-\ntudes and beliefs on corruption perceptions, we draw atten-\ntion to socioeconomic status as a key shaper of an\nindividual's perceptions.\n6 Research and Politics \n    \n    \n\n     \n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n   \n    \n\n\n\n\n   \n     \n\n   \n     \n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.

Marginal effects from multilevel models.\n8 Research and Politics \nFinally, this article raises interesting questions for\nfuture research. Most notably, why do the disadvantaged\nin poorer countries not perceive more corruption than\ntheir comparatively advantaged compatriots? We specu-\nlated that developing and middle-income countries differ\nfrom high-income countries in their corruption environ-\nment because of high overall levels of corruption and the\nprevailing forms of corruption. However, an alternative\npossibility is that corruption is mobilized as a political\nissue differently across countries. Perhaps in poorer coun-\ntries, low-income citizens tend to be concerned with other\nissues, such that corruption is a largely middle-class pre-\noccupation. This question of why precisely the relation-\nship between socioeconomic status and corruption\nperceptions varies across levels of economic development\nis therefore ripe for future research.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any funding agency\nin the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\nSupplementary material\nThe online appendix is available at http://thedata.harvard.edu/dvn/\nfaces/StudyListingPage.xhtml?vdcId=2137&studyListingIndex=1\nNotes\n1. As an exception, Tverdova (2011) examines multiple coun-\ntries and is attentive to the association between socioeco-\nnomic status and corruption perceptions. We differ from\nher study in relying on additional datasets to corroborate\nour findings and approaching the data analysis differently.\nWhereas she estimates her results by including a long line\nof predictors into a single equation, introducing potentially\nendogenous attitudinal variables, we separately examine the\nrelationships between income and corruption perceptions\nand education and corruption perceptions.\n2.
