The postganglionic portion of these\nnerves is ensheathed by glial cells known as non-myelinating Schwann cells. In the brain, glia play important functional roles in\nneurotransmission, neuroinflammation, and maintenance of the blood brain barrier. Similarly, enteric glia are now known to\nhave analogous roles in gastrointestinal neurotransmission, inflammatory response, and barrier formation. In contrast to this,\nvery little is known about the function of glia in other visceral organs. Like the gut, the lung forms a barrier between airborne\npathogens and the bloodstream, and autonomic lung innervation is known to affect pulmonary inflammation and lung\nfunction. Lung glia are described as non-myelinating Schwann cells but their function is not known, and indeed no transgenic\ntools have been validated to study them in vivo. The primary goal of this research was, therefore, to investigate the rela-\ntionship between non-myelinating Schwann cells and pulmonary nerves in the airways and vasculature and to validate existing\ntransgenic mouse tools that would be useful for studying their function. We focused on the glial fibrillary acidic protein\npromoter, which is a cognate marker of astrocytes that is expressed by enteric glia and non-myelinating Schwann cells. We\ndescribe the morphology of non-myelinating Schwann cells in the lung and verify that they express glial fibrillary acidic protein\nand S100, a classic glial marker. Furthermore, we characterize the relationship of non-myelinating Schwann cells to pulmonary\nnerves. Finally, we report tools for studying their function, including a commercially available transgenic mouse line.\n",

In the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, enteric glia\nhave been shown to play important roles in the formation\nand maintenance of the intestinal epithelial barrier,\nneurotransmission and immune response, and their dys-\nfunction has been linked to inflammatory GI pathology\neral types of enteric glia, of which the intramuscular glia\nare most similar to non-myelinating Schwann cells in\nmorphology and function (Gulbransen and Sharkey,\n2012). All enteric glial types originate from a common\npopulation of neural crest progenitor cells that migrate\nto the GI tract during development and differentiate into\neither neurons or glia (Laranjeira et al., 2011).\nSimilarly, in the lung, both myelinating and non-mye-\nlinating Schwann cells arise from neural crest precursors\nthat migrate from the esophagus into the mouse lung at\nembryonic day 10.5, accompanying the progression of\nperipheral nerves (Deal et al., 2006). In the developing\nhuman airways, a network of ganglia and nerve trunks\naccompanied by Schwann cells can be found by the\nmiddle of the first trimester (Sparrow et al., 1999). The\ncalcium-binding protein S100, a classic glial marker, has\nbeen used to describe glia of the developing human\nrespiratory tract (Sparrow et al., 1999) and adult lungs\nof several other mammals (Sheppard et al., 1983).\nHowever, very little is known about the anatomy, other\ncell-specific markers, or the function of non-myelinating\nSchwann cells in the lung, and there are no known trans-\ngenic mouse tools to study these cells in vivo.\nThe primary goal of this study was, therefore, to inves-\ntigate the relationship of non-myelinating Schwann cells\nto pulmonary nerves in the airways and vasculature and\nto establish whether existing transgenic mouse tools\nwould be useful for studying their function. We focused\non the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter,\nwhich is a cognate marker of astrocytes and expressed\nin enteric glial and non-myelinating Schwann cells\nGulbransen and Sharkey, 2012). We first screened estab-\nlished, commercially available transgenic mouse lines that\nexpress green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the lung under\nthe control of GFAP promoters and then used the mice\nto verify expression of the glial marker S100 and to\ndescribe the morphology, anatomic distribution, and\nassociation of glial cells with pulmonary nerves.\nMaterials and Methods\nAnimals\nAll animal procedures were performed in accordance\nwith the protocol approved by the Institutional Animal\nCare and Use Committee at Stanford University. Six to\n10-week-old mice on a C57BL/6J background purchased\nfrom The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, were\nutilized for all studies: wild-type C57BL/6J mice\nPerfusion and Tissue Preparation\nMice were heavily anesthetized with chloral hydrate and\nterminally perfused through the right ventricle with\n(10 units/ml) until the lungs were completely clear of\nblood.

The following day, the sections were rinsed with\nTBS and incubated with a biotinylated secondary anti-\nbody (Table 2) for 1 hr. After rinsing with TBS, sections\nwere incubated in avidin\u00adbiotin peroxidase complex\n(Vectastain Elite ABC kit, Vector Laboratories) for\n1 hr, rinsed with TBS and a final wash with 0.1 M Tris\nand visualized with DAB for 1 to 2 min.\n2 ASN Neuro\nImmunofluorescence\nFree-floating sections were rinsed with TBS and blocked\nfor 1 hr in 5% serum from the species in which the sec-\nondary antibody was raised diluted in 0.1% Triton\nX-100.

The next day, sections were rinsed with\nTBS. Fluorescent secondary antibodies (Table 2) were\nserum. Sections were incubated in the appropriate\nsecondary antibodies at room temperature for 4 to 6 hr,\nrinsed in TBS, wet mounted with Vectashield hard set\nmounting media with 4'6-diamidino-2-phenylindole\n(Vector Labs) and coverslipped.\nImage Acquisition and Analysis\nImages of DAB-stained sections were taken using a Zeiss\nAxio Imager M1 with charge-coupled device camera\nusing a 20\u00c2 objective.

Z-stack images of\nfluorescent lung sections were acquired by sequential\nsize, with a line average of 2 to reduce noise. Stacks were\nreconstructed using FIJI (NIH), and Photoshop (Adobe)\nsoftware was used to change brightness and contrast of\nthe images.\nTo quantify double labeling, we used an unbiased\napproach. For example, to examine whether GFP expres-\nsion in GFAPcre-GFP mice was present in GFAP \u00fe cells,\nlung sections from three animals were immunostained for\nGFAP with a red (Alexafluor 555) secondary. When a\nGFP-expressing cell was identified in the green channel,\nthe channel was switched to red to determine whether it\nalso stained for GFAP. Conversely, to evaluate which\npercent of GFAP immunostained cells express GFP,\nGFAP \u00fe cells were identified in the red channel then the\nchannel switched to green to score GFP expression. At\nleast 100 cells from each mouse were counted for each of\nthese questions.\nAntibody Characterization\nSeveral antibodies against GFAP, an intracytoplasmic\nfilamentous protein that forms part of the cytoskeleton\nof glial cells, were used. The rabbit polyclonal antibody\nproduced by Dako has been used extensively to study\nglial cells both within the central nervous system (CNS)\nand in the periphery (Middeldorp and Hol, 2011;\nantibody by Western blots of brain and lung homogen-\nates; in both tissues, we find a specific band of 50 kDa,\nwhich is the appropriate size for GFAP. We have used\nthis antibody for DAB and immunofluorescence in both\nbrain (Cekanaviciute et al., 2014) and lung and find\nbrightly stained cells that are of astrocyte morphology\nin brain and what would be expected of the morphology\nand distribution for non-myelinating Schwann cells in the\nlung. Other GFAP antibodies were tested (made in rat\nand chicken, Table 1), and although they stained strongly\nand specifically for astrocytes in the brain staining in the\nlung appeared to be specific but was extremely weak.\nThe Millipore anti-GFP antibody is made against\nhighly purified native GFP from Aequorea victoria and\nreacts with both native and recombinant GFP sources.\nThe manufacturer reports that the antibody binds to a\nspecific 30-kDa band in Western blot of lysates from\nEscherichia coli expressing GFP. No band is seen in lys-\nates from E. coli that do not express GFP. In immuno-\ncytochemistry, GFP is detected in cells transfected with a\nplasmid directing expression of GFP or GFP-fusion pro-\ntein, cells that do not express GFP exhibit no detectable\nstaining. In our laboratory, we have verified the specifi-\ncity of this antibody through DAB immunostaining of\nlung and brain tissues from mice that express GFP\nunder a GFAP promoter. Additionally, we have ensured\nthat the staining is limited to GFP-expressing cells by\nusing the GFP antibody with a 555 conjugated\nsecondary.\nMyelin basic protein (MBP) is one of the most abun-\ndant protein components of myelin both in the CNS and\nperipheral nervous systems (PNS). This Abcam antibody\nhas been widely used as an oligodendrocyte and myelinat-\ning Schwann cell marker (Yu et al., 2009; Latimer et al.,\nthis antibody through immunohistochemistry of parafor-\nmaldehyde fixed frozen spinal cord sections, paraffin\nembedded brain sections, in which appropriate myelin\nstaining was observed. On Western blots, two bands of\n19 and 26 kDa represent MBP isoforms. In our lung\nimmunostains, we observe sparse but present labeling of\nstructures of appropriate morphology for myelin\nsheathes. In double stains, MBP-labeled structures can\nbe seen surrounding nerves.\nPlatelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1, also\nknown as CD31, reacts with adult and embryonic endo-\nthelial cells. The manufacturer has tested the antibody\nwith immunohistochemical staining of zinc-paraffin sec-\ntions of mouse spleen, lung, heart, and thymus and\nreports that it stains endothelial cells on small and large\nblood vessels. In our hands, this antibody shows wide-\nspread staining in lung parenchyma and larger blood ves-\nsels appropriate to vascular endothelium. Additionally,\nthis antibody does not stain airway endothelial cells.\nProtein gene product 9.5 (PGP9.5) is widely used as a\npan-neuronal and neuroepithelial cell marker in the PNS,\nincluding the lung (Lauweryns and Van Ranst, 1988;\nVeres et al., 2007). The antibody labels neuronal cell\nbodies and axons and neuroendocrine cells in the CNS\nand PNS. In vivo substrates of PGP9.5 are largely\nunknown (Day and Thompson, 2010). According to the\nmanufacturer, anti-human PGP9.5 is particularly suitable\nfor detecting small nerve fibers in peripheral tissues. We\nobserve specific staining morphologically appropriate for\nnerves and neuroepithelial bodies in the lung that have\nthe correct anatomic distribution.\na-Smooth muscle actin specifically labels the a-smooth\nmuscle isoform of actin and does not react with other\nmajor actin isoforms present in fibroblasts or epithelial\ncells, striated muscle, myocardium, or gamma-smooth\nmuscle isoform. This antibody labels vascular and vis-\nceral smooth muscle cells in adult and embryonic tissues.\na-Smooth muscle actin is a well-characterized marker of\nmyofibroblasts used to immunolabel smooth muscle in\net al., 2014) and other peripheral tissues (Arnold et al.,\nmanufacturer produces a specific 42-kDa band. In our\nlung stains, this antibody labels smooth muscle in the\n4 ASN Neuro\ntrachea and large bronchi, which results in a striated\nappearance that is appropriate for airway smooth\nmuscle. Smooth muscle cells in blood vessel walls are\nalso labeled.\nCalcium-binding proteins, such as S100, are expressed\nin many cell types. S100B is most abundant in glial cells\nof the CNS and PNS but is also present in other cell\ntypes, including a subpopulation of neurons. The S100\nantibody from Dako is widely used in the literature to\nimmunostain peripheral glial cells (Young et al., 2002;\nused was solid-phase absorbed with human plasma and\nbovine serum proteins and on Western blot of purified\nhuman recombinant S100 proteins, this antibody labels\nweakly. No reaction seen with other S100A proteins\nThe Millipore antibody for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)\nis widely used to study dopaminergic and adrenergic neu-\nrons in the CNS (Forrest et al., 2014). TH is the first\nrate-limiting enzyme involved in the synthesis of the cat-\necholamines dopamine and noradrenaline from tyrosine.\nThe manufacturer has tested the antibody through\nWestern blot, which shows a specific 62-kDa band. In\nour hands, we observe characteristic immunostaining of\nsympathetic nerves that is limited to vesicles and, there-\nfore, confers a beaded appearance. In lung, immunostain-\ning is restricted to areas where sympathetic nerves are\nexpected to be, surrounding airways and in blood vessel\nwalls.\nResults\nCells in the Mouse Lung Express Glial-Specific\nWe began our characterization of Schwann cells in the\nlung by immunostaining lung sections from wild-type\nC57BL/6J mice for two glial-specific markers. The cal-\ncium-binding protein S100B has been reported to be a\nmarker for peripheral non-myelinating glia (Cocchia\nsections with an antibody that strongly labels S100B but\nWe found that there were indeed prominent, nucleated,\nelongated cells that were most notable around medium to\nlarger airways and vascular structures (Figure 1(A) and\n(B), arrows), as would be expected for glia that accom-\npany pulmonary nerves. We noted that some of these\nelongated cells exhibited a distinctly smoother, more ser-\npentine appearance (Figure 1(A), asterisk). However, we\nalso consistently observed immunostaining in some bron-\nchial epithelial cells (Figure 1(A) and (B), arrowhead).\nWe next immunostained against GFAP using a poly-\nclonal rabbit antibody that labels all GFAP isoforms\n(Clairembault et al., 2014). GFAP is a type III intermedi-\nate filament protein (Steinert and Roop, 1988) that is a\ncognate marker of astrocytes in the brain and has also\nbeen reported in peripheral non-myelinating Schwann\ncells and enteric glia (Jessen and Mirsky, 1985;\nGulbransen and Sharkey, 2012). We observed GFAP-\nimmunoreactive cells that were of similar morphology\nand in a similar location to the cells identified by S100\nimmunohistochemistry (Figure 1(C) and (D), arrows). In\nboth immunostains, these cells form an intricate network\nthat surrounds large airways. The distribution is very\ndense around the primary bronchi and becomes progres-\nsively less dense in more distal airways. We quantified the\npresence of GFAP-expressing cells by counting 100 bron-\nchi that were over 100 mm in diameter and cut into a\ncross-sectional plane in each of three mice. All bronchi\ncounted had GFAP-expressing cells located just outside\nthe basal lamina and partially or completely surrounding\nthe airways.\nColocalization of GFAP and S100 could not be con-\nfirmed via double-immunostaining because both antibo-\ndies are made in rabbit. Interestingly several other anti-\nGFAP antibodies, a monoclonal rat, and a polyclonal\nchicken antibody (Table 1), that in our hands specifically\nand strongly label brain astrocytes, produced extremely\nweak immunostaining when applied to lung tissue.\nGFAP Transgenic Mice Drive GFP Expression in\nGFAP and S100 Immunostained Cells\nTransgenic mouse lines that express specifically in GFAP\nand S100 positive cells were, therefore, necessary to fur-\nther characterize these cells immunohistochemically and\nalso to study their function in the future. We turned to\ncommercially available transgenic mouse tools to deter-\nmine if we could use a mouse line containing a GFAP\npromoter to drive expression in peripheral non-myelinat-\ning Schwann cells. We evaluated lungs from four mice\nlines designed to express GFP in GFAP-expressing cells\n(Table 3). For each mouse line, we first investigated if\nGFP was present by DAB immunostaining of the lung\nand if it was present, whether it exhibited the anatomic\nlocation and morphology expected based on GFAP and\nS100 immunostaining. Next, in order to determine\nwhether GFP expression was limited to cells expressing\nGFAP, we performed a fluorescent double stain.\nThe first three lines we evaluated did not exhibit\nappropriate GFP expression. In FVB/NJ-GFAP-GFP\nmice, GFP could be detected through DAB staining\nand appeared to be in the correct anatomic location\nand morphology for GFAP positive cells. However,\nwhen we used fluorescent antibodies, we did not observe\nGFP immunostaining. Next, we characterized GFP\nSuarez-Mier and Buckwalter 5\nexpression in lungs of C57BL/6J-GFAP-cre/ERT2 mice\ncrossed with a C57BL/6J-Rosa 26 eGFP reporter line.\nMice were dosed with 300 mg/kg of tamoxifen dissolved\nin corn oil orally for 5 consecutive days and evaluated\n4 days later. We observed extensive nonspecific GFP\nimmunostaining in the lung, and in addition GFP was\nalso not present in most cells that immunostained for\nGFAP. We then tested the C57BL/6J-GFAP-GFP\nPleiades transgenic mouse, but no GFP expression was\nfound in lung.\nThe last strain we evaluated was a C57BL/6J-GFAP-\nCre crossed with C57BL/6J-Rosa26 eGFP reporter mice,\nwhich we will abbreviate as GFAPcre-GFP mice here.\nGFAPcre-GFP mice exhibited GFP expression in the\nexpected morphology and location for non-myelinating\nSchwann cells and excellent colocalization with GFAP\nimmunostaining (Figure 2). To formally test concord-\nance, we counted 100 cells per mouse and found that\n95% of cells that express GFP also immunolabeled for\nGFAP (Figure 2(K)). In addition, 98% of cells that\nimmunostained for GFAP coexpressed GFP (Figure\nTo verify that the morphologically similar cells that we\nhad immunostained in wild-type mouse lungs for GFAP\nand S100 (Figure 1) were the same cells, we evaluated\nlungs from GFAPcre-GFP mice with anti-S100 antibody\n(Figure 3). The GFAPcre-GFP mice exhibited close con-\ncordance of S100 immunostaining with GFP expression.\nThe bronchial epithelial cells seen in the DAB stain for\nS100 were also detected in fluorescent stains, but they did\nnot colocalize with GFP (Figure 3(D)\u00ad(G), arrowhead).\nGFP expression in the distal airways was sparse, and\nFigure 1.

Ninety-five percent of GFP-labeled cells around air-\nS100-immunostained cells also exhibited GFP immunos-\ntaining (Figure 3(P)). GFAP staining was not found in\ndistal airways; however, GFAPcre-GFP mice expressed\nWe noted that the smooth, serpentine cells that\nimmunostained for GFAP and S100 in DAB appeared to\nbe associated with pulmonary blood vessels, which were\nidentified by their characteristic morphology and anatomic\nposition in relation to airways. We confirmed that these\ndistinctly shaped cells were exclusively associated with\nblood vessels by immunostaining GFAPcre-GFP mouse\nlungs with the vascular endothelial marker platelet endo-\nthelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM1, Figure 4). As\nwith the cells associated with airways, vasculature-asso-\nciated GFP \u00fe cells coimmunolabeled with both GFAP\n(Figure 4(H)\u00ad(J)) and S100 (Figure 4(K)\u00ad(M)). In contrast\nto the airways, which almost always had GFP \u00fe cells sur-\nrounding them, only 55% medium to large blood vessels\nexhibited GFP-expressing cells (Figure 4(N)).\nIn GFAPcre-GFP mouse lungs, all of the cells asso-\nciated with large airways and vasculature that express\nGFP also exhibit GFAP and S100 immunostaining. The\ncells that do not exhibit GFAP immunostaining but do\nexpress GFP are the small airway-associated cells that\nalso costain for S100 (Figure 3(K)\u00ad(N)).\nGFAP-Expressing Cells in the Lung Are Associated\nWith Pulmonary Nerves\nAn important characteristic of both myelinating and non-\nmyelinating Schwann cells is close association with neu-\nrons or nerves. Peripheral nerves, including those in the\nlung (Lauweryns and Van Ranst, 1988), immunostain with\nthe marker PGP9.5. Dual labeling of GFP and PGP9.5 in\nGFAPcre-GFP mice showed that GFP-expressing cells\nwere closely associated with PGP9.5 immunostained\nnerves (Figure 5). PGP9.5-immunostained cells consist-\nently exhibited axonal densities that are larger and more\nintensely stained than the remainder of the axon (Figure\n5(K)\u00ad(M), arrowheads), and the glial cell sheath appears\nto have fenestrations that coincide with these densities. Of\nnote, the GFP \u00fe cells in the distal airways that costain for\nlabeled nerves (Figure 5(N)\u00ad(Q)). Almost all GFP-expres-\nsing cells were associated with PGP9.5 immunostained\nnerves (Figure 5(R)), and 12% of nerves did not associate\nwith GFP, which may correspond to myelinated nerves or\nnaked nerve terminals (Figure 5(S)).\nPGP9.5 also immunostains neuroepithelial bodies\nwhich we identified by their characteristic morphology\nand location within the airway lumen (Figure 6).\nNeuroepithelial bodies are clusters of specialized\nTable 3.

Neuroepithelial\nbodies did not express GFP and were not ensheathed\nby GFP-expressing cells. However, GFP \u00fe non-myelinat-\ning Schwann cells appeared to be in contact with the\nbasal aspect of neuroepithelial bodies.\nNon-Myelinating Schwann Cells Are Closely\nAssociated With Sympathetic Nerves\nWe also examined colocalization of GFP in GFAPcre-\nGFP mice with sympathetic nerves (Figure 7), which\ninnervate both the airways and vasculature of the\nmouse lung. We used TH to immunostain sympathetic\nnerves and their terminals. Sympathetic cell bodies are\nlocated outside of the lung; the superior cervical and stel-\nlate ganglia supply the trachea, and the stellate ganglion\nand thoracic ganglia 2 to 6 provide sympathetic innerv-\nation to the rest of the lung (Honjin, 1956; Kummer\net al., 1992). GFP-expressing glia in the lung, on the\nother hand, do have nuclei, so non-myelinating\nSchwann cells could be identified by their nuclei despite\ntheir intimate association with sympathetic axons.\nWhenever a serpentine shaped, GFP-expressing cell was\nnoted it was always associated with a vascular structure\nand was always positive for TH immunostaining (Figure\nFigure 2.

We found that GFAP-expressing glia were present\nin these nerve bundles and that multiple glia line up lon-\ngitudinally along each nerve fiber (Figure 8(A)).\nMyelinated nerves in the lung are predominantly pre-\nganglionic cholinergic parasympathetic nerves, but there\nare also some myelinated sensory nerves (Brouns et al.,\n2005). We observed prominent nerve bundles in the lar-\ngest airways that immunostained for GFAP in parasym-\npathetic nerve reporter mice (choline acetyl transferase\n(ChAT)-cre mice crossed with Rosa26-tandem dimer\ntomato (TDT) reporter line, Figure 8(B)\u00ad(D)). We\nobserved close association of GFAP and thinner TDT\npositive fibers; however, thicker fibers that formed part\nof larger bundles did not clearly colocalize with GFAP,\nimplying that myelinating Schwann cells do not consist-\nently coexpress GFAP. Indeed, unmyelinated TH-\nexpressing sympathetic nerves did clearly associate with\nGFP in GFAPcre-GFP mice but neither marker asso-\nciated with MBP in multiaxon bundles (Figure 8(E)\u00ad(L)).\nDiscussion\nIn the present study, we describe GFAP-expressing non-\nmyelinating Schwann cells in the lung. We validate a\ntransgenic mouse line that drives expression of cre under\na GFAP promoter and demonstrate that in GFAPcre-\nGFP mice, GFP is widely expressed but limited to non-\nmyelinating Schwann cells that immunostain for GFAP\nand S100 and are associated with pulmonary nerves. Non-\nmyelinating Schwann cells ensheathe pulmonary nerves\nthat travel distally in large bundles (Figure 9(A)) along\nthe bronchial tree. They also ensheathe the nerves that\nbranch off from the bundles to form part of an intricate\nbronchial plexus, which can be seen in the cross-sectional\nplane surrounding bronchi (Figure 9(B)) and have a mesh-\nlike appearance in the longitudinal plane (Figure 9(C)).\nGlia that are associated with the pulmonary vasculature\nalso immunostain for S100 and GFAP are sparse and\nhave a characteristic morphology that is smoother and\nmore serpentine than airway-associated glial cells\n(Figure 9(D)). In small airways, GFAP immunostaining\nis not detectable, however, slender, elongated GFP-\nexpressing cells also immunostain for S100 and are asso-\nciated with nerves immunostained with PGP9.5\n(Figure 9(E)). Non-myelinating Schwann cells are intim-\nately associated with TH immunolabeled sympathetic\nnerves both in airways and blood vessels.\nBeginning in the 1950s, electron microscopy studies\nrevealed the fine structure of unmyelinated peripheral\nnerve fibers and Schwann cells (Hess and\nFigure 6.

Later research showed that the airways of\nmammals, including mice (Hung et al., 1972), rats\nare supplied by unmyelinated nerve axons that are par-\ntially or completely surrounded by non-myelinating\nSchwann cells. Similar studies have explored the\ninnervation of other visceral organs such as the liver\n(Felten and Olschowka, 1987), adrenal medulla\n(Coupland, 1965), and bone marrow (Yamazaki and\nAllen, 1990), among others, but Schwann cells are men-\ntioned only in the context of nerve axons.\nFigure 7.

TH immunostained sympathetic nerve fibers are ensheathed by GFP expressing cells in a bundle that also contains MBP\nimmunostained structures that do not colocalize with either GFP or TH. Scale bars, 20 mm.\nNo unifying functions of glial cells in visceral organs\nare known, or if they are specialized by organ. In the\nbone marrow, non-myelinating Schwann cells are\ninvolved in maintenance of the hematopoietic stem cell\nniche (Yamazaki et al., 2011). In the lung, heart, intes-\ntine, bladder, and kidney non-myelinating Schwann cells\nexpress a specialized sodium channel and have been\nimplicated to play a role in extracellular sodium level\nregulation (Watanabe et al., 2002). There is a growing\ninterest in enteric glia as a component of the immune\nbarrier in the gut (Bush et al., 1998; Cornet et al.,\nGulbransen and Sharkey, 2012) that responds to sympa-\nthetic nerve stimulation (Gulbransen et al., 2010).\nEnteric glia differ from non-myelinating Schwann cells\n(Gershon and Rothman, 1991); however, they are the\nFigure 9. Diagram of a mouse lung showing the location of non-myelinating Schwann cells (A). Nerves travel down the lung in thick\nbundles of nerves that are ensheathed by glia. Glia-ensheathed nerves form a mesh that surround large and small bronchi and form an\nalmost complete semicircle around the cross-sectional aspect of the airways (B) and appear as a network on the longitudinal aspect (C).\nGlia are also found ensheathing blood vessel nerves (D), although at a much lower density compared with airways. Blood vessel-associated\nglia have a smoother and more serpentine morphology compared with airway glia. In small airways, (E) GFAP immunostaining is not visible;\nhowever, we do find the presence of GFP in the small airways GFAP-GFP mice. Although the morphology of the GFP \u00fe cells found in small\nairways is different to that of larger airways or blood vessels, these cells do co-immunostain with other glial markers (S100) and nerve\nSuarez-Mier and Buckwalter 15\nbest characterized visceral glia and may have common\nfunctional pathways with other visceral glia.\nThe availability of this GFAP-cre transgenic mouse\ntool makes it possible to study the functions of pulmon-\nary glia. We chose to evaluate GFAP expression in the\nlung because it is a marker of peripheral non-myelinating\nSchwann cells and enteric glia (Jessen et al., 1984;\nGulbransen and Sharkey, 2012). Additionally, there are\ncommercially available mice that express transgenes\nunder GFAP promoters. However, few transgenic tools\nhave been validated in non-myelinating Schwann cells. A\ntransgenic line of S100B-GFP mice express GFP specif-\nically in brain astrocytes (Vives et al., 2003); in the\nkidney, however, GFP is also expressed in cuboidal epi-\nthelial cells of Bowman's capsule (Darlot et al., 2008).\nGiven that some bronchial epithelial cells immunostain\nGFP in those pulmonary cells. Some transgenic mouse\nlines have been created to study activity of specific gene\nfunctions of non-myelinating Schwann cells: one\nexpresses a dominant negative ErbB2 receptor under\nthe control a GFAP promoter preferentially in the PNS\n(sciatic nerve, Chen et al., 2003 and inner ear, Rio et al.,\n2001) and minimally in the CNS or GFAP-IkB-alpha-dn\nmice, in which glial NF-jB signaling is disrupted in the\nsciatic nerve-associated non-myelinating Schwann cells\nWe establish here that GFAP-cre mice will be a useful\ntool to study non-myelinating Schwann cells in the lung.\nWhen crossed to Rosa26 GFP reporter mice, expression\nis remarkably faithful to GFAP immunohistochemistry\nand limited to non-myelinating Schwann cells identified\nwith GFAP and S100 immunostaining. Only 5% of GFP\nexpressing cells do not immunostain for GFAP or S100;\nhowever, their morphology and localization closely\nresembles those cells that immunostain for these glial\nmarkers. We may not have always observed GFP colo-\ncalizing with GFAP because GFP is particularly concen-\ntrated in the nuclei and decreases as it spreads out to the\nrest of the cell processes, while GFAP immunostaining\ntends to be stronger in the processes and less within the\nnucleus. Additionally, cells that immunostain for either\nWe did not see convincing evidence of GFAP expres-\nsion in myelinating Schwann cells and propose here that\nit is an exclusive marker for non-myelinating Schwann\ncells in the lung. The large nerve bundles that are asso-\nciated with large airways contain tightly packed myelin-\nated and unmyelinated axons. Despite this, we never\nobserved GFP clearly colocalized with MBP immunos-\ntaining in GFAPcre-GFP mice. In non-transgenic mice,\nwe very occasionally observed some GFAP immunostain-\ning on the cut edge of a bundle of myelinated nerves. This\nwas also observed with other antibodies, and although we\nthink is an artifact, myelinating Schwann cells have been\nreported to express GFAP when there is axonal injury\n(Stoll and Mu\n\u00a8 ller, 1999). Therefore, although we cannot\nexclude that some myelinating Schwann cells may express\nGFAP after injury, we conclude that in uninjured mice\nGFAP expression is confined to non-myelinating\nSchwann cells.\nThere are reports of GFAP-expressing lung cells that\nare not glial cells but are instead peribronchial fibro-\nblasts, with Zhao and Burt (2007) attributing them to a\n``stellate cell'' network (Hainfellner et al., 2001). In con-\ntrast, we report here that GFAP-expressing cells in the\nlung are non-myelinating Schwann cells that are asso-\nciated with pulmonary nerves. We did not observe\nGFAP-expressing cells that were not associated with pul-\nmonary nerves. The previous reports did not perform\ndouble immunofluorescence with nerve markers. The\nmorphology of the GFAP immunostained cells reported\nin the lung by Zhao and Burt is similar to the GFAP\nimmunostaining that we show here but with shorter pro-\ncesses. We speculate that this is because they used 10 mm\nparaffin embedded sections while we used 40 mm thick\nfloating sections, and that in their slides, Schwann cell\nprocesses were transected. We do report here a popula-\ntion of cells within the inner lining of the airways that\nimmunostain for S100, but not for GFAP or GFP.\nHowever, these cells are unlikely to be fibroblasts since\ntheir anatomy and morphology is very characteristic of\nairway epithelial cells. Finally, the S100 antibody that we\nused does not immunostain for S100A4, which is also\nknown as fibroblast specific protein 1, a specific fibroblast\nmarker.\nAlthough GFAP expression has been reported in\nneural crest precursor cells (Johnson et al., 2009), cre\nrecombinase did not appear to be expressed in neuronal\naxons in this GFAPcre-GFP mouse line. The resolution\nthat we achieved with confocal microscopy was not suffi-\ncient to convincingly show Schwann cells and nerve axons\nas separate cells. However, electron microscopy images of\nnon-myelinating Schwann cells in the lung clearly show\nthat each axon is partially or completely surrounded by\nSchwann cell processes (Hung et al., 1972). Our immu-\nnostaining is thus consistent with this relationship\nbetween non-myelinating Schwann cells and axons.\nAdditionally, sympathetic nerve axons have their cell\nbodies outside of the lung (Strack et al., 2002); therefore,\nthe nuclei that are found associated with TH \u00fe nerves\nbelong to glia, not nerves. We found that non-myelinating\nSchwann cells do not ensheathe neuroepithelial bodies;\nhowever, they do contact the basal aspect and are prob-\nably associated with capsaicin-sensitive, calcitonin gene-\nrelated peptide and substance P immunoreactive nerve\nfibers, which contact neuroepithelial bodies at their\nThis is, to our knowledge, the first characterization of\nnon-myelinating Schwann cells in the lung, including\ntheir basic morphology and anatomic distribution as well\nas immunohistochemical markers and relationships to\nlung innervation. We also identify a GFAP-cre mouse\nline that can be bred to floxed lines to disrupt genes or\npathways of interest in non-myelinating Schwann cells in\nthe lung.\nSummary Statement\nWe describe the morphology and anatomic distribution\nof pulmonary glia, non-myelinating Schwann cells that\nsurround pulmonary autonomic nerves and validate a\ntransgenic mouse tool to study the function of these cells.\n"
