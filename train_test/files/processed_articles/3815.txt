Addition of AEF to the cultured OPC\nresulted in a dose- and time-dependent increase in\nproliferation that was partially dependent on Akt (protein\nkinase B) and MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase)\nactivation. The major mitogen in an AEF-SE (soluble 2.0 M\nNaCl extract of the AEF) was identified as aFGF (acidic\nfibroblast growth factor) and accounted for 50% of the\nmitogenicity. The remaining 50% of the mitogenicity had\nproperties consistent with bFGF (basic fibroblast growth\nfactor) but was not unequivocally identified. Under\nconditions that limit the survival of OPC in culture, AEF\ntreatment prolonged the survival of the OPC. Antigenic\nand morphological examination of the AEF-treated OPC\nindicated that the AEF treatment helped the OPC survive in\na more immature state. The potential downstream\nmetabolic pathways potentially activated in OPC by AEF\nand the consequences of these activated pathways are\ndiscussed. The results of these studies are consistent with\nthe view that direct contact of axons with OPC stimulates\ntheir proliferation and survival while preventing their\ndifferentiation.\n",

While a number of\nresearchers have reported that axons regulate OPC (oligo-\ndendrocyte progenitor cell) proliferation (Barres and Raff,\n1993), the role of the axon in the differentiation of OPCs is\nless clear. OPCs can differentiate into oligodendrocytes in the\nabsence of axons (Abney et al., 1981), giving rise to the idea\nthat OPCs contain an intrinsic timer related to cell divi-\nsion that regulates their development. Support for this view\nhas previously been reported by Dugas et al. (2007) who\nshowed that p57(kip2) may be an intracellular timer that\nregulates how many times an OPC can divide prior to\ndifferentiating. Alternatively, a more recent analysis of the\ntranscriptome of OPCs reveals three enriched signalling\npathways in OPCs, which the authors postulate are influenced\nby cell\u00adcell signalling pathways (Cahoy et al., 2008).

It is important to note\nthat most of these studies have utilized as an axonal source\nthe easily accessible optic nerve in neonatal animals.\nHowever, in the adult CNS (central nervous system) during\ndemyelinating disease, it is the mature demyelinated axon\nthat must reinitiate the OPC proliferation and possibly\ndifferentiation. Our laboratory has devised a method to\nisolate an AEF (axolemma-enriched fraction) from the mature\nCNS (Detskey et al., 1988) that retains its ability to influence\nthe differentiation and proliferation of myelinating glial cells\nstudy, we examined the potential of the axonal plasma\nmembrane derived from the adult CNS to influence the\nproliferation, differentiation and survival of OPC. These data\nare significant, since it has been reported that active\ndemyelinating lesions contain intact OPCs that fail to be\nstimulated by mature demyelinated axons (Breij et al., 2008).\nIt is postulated that this lack of remyelination is possibly due\nto a loss of axon\u00adoligodendrocyte communication.\nMETHODS\nAll animals used in the present study were housed in the\nHines VA Animal Facility, and procedures were approved by\nthe Hines Animal Care and Use Committee and conducted in\naccordance with the guidelines in ``Guide for the Care and\nUse of Laboratory Animals'' from the National Institutes of\nHealth.\nPreparation of AEFs\nAEF isolation from bovine white matter has been previously\nbovine CNS white matter was homogenized and centrifuged\nto obtain a floating layer of myelinated axons. The myeli-\nnated axons were osmotically shocked to release the myelin\nfrom the axonal plasma membrane, followed by separation\nof the shocked myelinated axons in a 10\u00ad40% continuous\nsucrose gradient. To control for any variation in starting\ntissue sample, multiple AEF preparations were made and\ntested in multiple experiments.\nPrimary cell culture\nOPCs were prepared from postnatal day 2 Sprague\u00adDawley\nrat pups using the method of McCarthy and De Vellis (1986).\nCortices were dissected from approx. 25 pups, suspended in\nDMEM\u00adF12 [Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium\u00adnutrient\nmixture F-12 (Ham's F12 nutrient medium); Invitrogen] and\nTrypsin digestion was inactivated by the addition of FCS\n(fetal calf serum; Hyclone) and the tissue dissociated using a\n14-gauge needle. Following dissociation, the cells were cen-\nresuspended in DMEM\u00adF12 with 10% (v/v) FCS. The mixed-glial\ncell suspension was added to poly-L-lysine- (Sigma\u00adAldrich)\ncoated T75 flasks (Corning). The cells were allowed to attach\nand the medium changed every other day. After one week in\nculture, the flask contained astrocytes, OPC and some\nmicroglial cells. The medium was changed and microglial cells\nwere removed by shaking at low speed on an orbital shaker\nfor 2 h. After removing the medium containing the microglial\ncells, fresh medium was added and the flasks were shaken\novernight to selectively detach the OPC from the astrocyte bed\non which they were growing. The medium was harvested and\nfiltered through a nylon mesh to remove debris. Contami-\nnating astrocytes were removed by plating the OPC on to\nuncoated T75 flasks for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. Astrocytes preferen-\ntially attach to the flask, while the OPC remain floating. The\nmedium containing the floating OPC was replated on to poly-\nlysine-coated Petri dishes (Falcon). After OPC attachment, the\nmedium was changed to a defined medium containing DMEM\n(Invitrogen), 16ITS (insulin-transferrin-selenium; Invitrogen),\n100 mM putrescine (Sigma\u00adAldrich), 10 ng/ml biotin (Sigma\u00ad\nAldrich) and 20 nM progesterone (Sigma\u00adAldrich) with 30%\nB104-conditioned medium. Examination of the cultures by\nphase-contrast microscopy revealed a purity of 95% or greater\nof all OPC cultures used in these studies.\nMAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) and\nAkt (protein kinase B) kinase activation and\nWestern blot analysis\nOPC were plated on to poly-L-lysine-coated 60 mm Petri\nAfter 2 h, the medium was changed to defined medium with\nB104-conditioned medium. Cultures were grown for 2 days\nand then were nutrient starved for 4 h prior to AEF\ntreatment. OPC were either treated with AEF in basal\nmin following treatment. Cells were solubilized in RIPA (radio\nimmunoprecipitation assay) buffer with complete protease\ninhibitor (Boeringer Mannheim) and 30 mg total protein was\nseparated using 4\u00ad20% gradient SDS/PAGE (Bio-Rad).\nFollowing transfer to PVDF membranes, membranes were\n(glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; Trevigen,\nsaline with Tween 20) and incubated with either anti-rabbit or\n-mouse peroxidase-labelled secondary antibodies. Immu-\nnoreactive bands were detected using chemiluminescence\n(PerkinElmer). Densitometric analysis was performed using UN-\nSCAN-IT 5.1 software (Silk Scientific). Experiments were\nrepeated in triplicate using multiple preparations of AEF.\nS.G.

After 2 h, the medium was changed\nto defined medium with 30% B104-conditioned medium. Half\nof the wells containing OPC were treated with AEF (25 mg/ml) in\nbasal DMEM and the other half remained untreated. At 0, 24,\n48 and 72 h, coverslips were fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformalde-\nhyde and processed for immunocytochemistry using a\npreviously described protocol (Espinosa-Jeffrey et al., 2002).\n(Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank)], APC/CC1 (adeno-\nmatous polyposis coli protein; Merck Chemicals, 1:20), O1\ntransferrin (Nordic Immunology, 1:50), GFAP (glial fibrillary\nacidic protein; Millipore, 1:1000) and MBP (myelin basic\nprotein; Dako, 1:200) were used. In brief, the samples were\nincubated with the primary antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C prior to\nwashing and incubating with the appropriate FITC-, AMCA\n(aminomethylcoumarin acetate)- or Texas Red-conjugated\nsecondary antibody. Negative controls were treated in the\nsame manner as the experimental coverslips, while omitting\nthe primary antibody. Select coverslips were counterstained for\nnuclei with DAPI (49,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole). Analysis and\nimaging were done using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope with\nappropriate filters equipped with an Axiocam HRm camera and\nAxiovision 4.3 software (Carl Zeiss).\nOPC proliferation assays\nOPC were plated on poly-L-lysine-coated 96-well plates with\n4000 cells/well and allowed to attach overnight. OPCs were\neither untreated or treated with AEF in basal DMEM for 24,\n48 and 72 h. Cell proliferation following treatment was\nmeasured using the CyQuant assay (Invitrogen) in which the\namount of proliferation is correlated with the quantity of\nfluorescent dye bound to DNA within the cell. The CyQuant\nassay was performed according to the manufacturer's\nrecommendations. In brief, cells were washed with PBS,\nfrozen, thawed and lysis buffer containing fluorescent dye\nwas added to each well. Plates were read on a PerSeptive\nBiosystems (Farmingham, MA, U.S.A.)

Statistical analysis on the mean\ncell numbers for untreated and treated cultures was done\nusing a paired t test with significance at P,0.05.\nIn order to confirm results obtained with the CyQuant\ntetrazolium bromide] assay was used to determine the cell\nnumber following treatment with AEF. The MTT assay is based\non the conversion of MTT into insoluble formazan, which can\nthen be solubilized and the concentration determined by\nattenuance (D) at 540 nm. The attenuance can be correlated\nto the number of cells present in the well. OPCs were plated\nallowed to attach and treated with AEF in basal DMEM\nwithout Phenol Red for 48 h. MEK [MAPK/ERK (extracellular-\nsignal-regulated kinase) kinase] inhibitor (PD-98059, Biomol)\nwas used at 10\u00ad50 mM and the Akt kinase inhibitor, triciribine\nml of MTT stock solution was added to each well and\nincubated at 37\u00b0C for 4 h. Following the incubation, 85 ml of\nmedium was removed from each well and 50 ml of DMSO was\nadded to each well and the plate was incubated at 37\u00b0C for\n10 min. Plates were read on the PerSeptive Biosystems\nAttenuance values from wells with no cells were subtracted\nfrom treatment wells to account for background signal. Mean\nattenuance values from triplicate runs were expressed as a\npercentage and untreated OPCs were set to 100%.\nSignificance of change in percent proliferation was compared\nbetween AEF-treated and AEF-treated with addition of kinase\ninhibitor using a paired t test with significance at P,0.05.\nIn the experiments designed to extract the mitogen from\nthe AEF, the more sensitive 3H-thymidine incorporation assay\nwas used to determine cell proliferation. In this assay, OPCs\nwere seeded on PDL-coated 96-well plate in defined medium\nplus 1% horse serum at a cell density of 4610 cells/well. The\ncells were allowed to attach for 24 h before the serum-\ncontaining medium was removed. The cultures were washed\ntwice with PBS and shifted to defined medium for another\n48 h. Membrane fraction or soluble mitogen in 100 ml was\nadded to each well for 72 h and 3 piCi/ml of 3H-thymidine\nwas added to the cultures 24 h after the mitogen was added.\nThe cultures were washed with PBS and treated with 0.25%\ntrypsin at 37\u00b0C for 60 min. The cells were collected on to a\nfilter paper using a Titertek cell harvester. The filter paper was\ntransferred into a 10 ml scintillation vial and 4 ml of Budget-\nsolve scintillation fluid (Research Products International\nCorp., Mount Prospect, IL, U.S.A.) was added to each vial.\nThe radioactivity on the filter was determined using a\nBeckman LS5801 liquid-scintillation counter.\nLive-dead assay\nOPCs were plated on to poly-L-lysine-coated 6-well plates\nand were either untreated for control or were treated with\nAEF. Following AEF incubation, the number of live (Syto10-\nGreen-labelled) and dead cells (Dead Red labelled) was\ndetermined using the Live/Dead Cytotoxicity kit (Roche) in\naccordance with the manufacturer' instructions. Syto 10\n(green) is a permeable dye that stains the nucleic acids of all\ncells and Dead Red is cell-impermeant and only labels cells\nwith compromised membranes. Random fields were examined\nfor the presence of both live and dead cells, and their\nnumbers recorded. Experiments were carried out in triplicate\nand counts were performed by a blinded observer.

Insoluble pellet was\nresuspended in isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl in HP) and protein\nwas determined with Hartree (1972) protein assay.\nBefore adding the alkaline extract to the culture to assay\nmitogenicity, the soluble fraction of the pH 9 extraction was\nneutralized with Hepes buffer; the salt and detergent in salt\nextract and detergent extract were removed by dialysing the\nsample in 1 litre of 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) plus\n0.15 M NaCl overnight with two changes of dialysis buffer.\nDialysis tubing with a molecular mass cut-off of 3.5 kDa was\nused throughout for sample dialysis. Tubing was boiled in\nEDTA aqueous solutions as followed: 1.5 mM EDTA twice for\nmin. Boiled tubing was then soaked in Milli Q H20 and stored\nat 4\u00b0C.

Trypsin was inactivated by\nadding 0.5% soy bean trypsin inhibitor (final concentration).\nThe mixture containing extract, acetylated trypsin and trypsin\ninhibitor was diluted with fresh defined medium and added\nto the cultures.\nHeparin-sepharose column chromatography\nAffi-Gel Heparin gel (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA, U.S.A.) was\npacked in a 0.6610 cm column and the column was equi-\nNaCl. Sample was applied in the same buffer at a flow rate\nof 20 ml/h. The unbound fraction was collected and reapplied\nto the column twice. The column was washed with the same\nbuffer until the D at 280 nm of the eluant reached the\nbackground reading. Proteins bound to the column were then\neluted with a linear gradient of 0.15\u00ad2 M NaCl in phosphate\nbuffer. Fractions (0.8 ml) were collected at a flow rate of 12\nml/h and D at 280 nm was measured for each fraction.\nAliquots of 100 ml of each fraction were saved for protein\nassay using a micro-BCA (bicinchoninic acid) protein assay\nsaved for SDS/PAGE.

Following incubation with AEF for 24 h, OPC were\nwashed to remove excess and loosely bound AEF. Using\nantibodies to beta-3 tubulin and neurofilament, two proteins\nnot expressed by OPC, AEF was found localized to the OPC\nbodies and processes (Figure 1). AEF was bound to OPC even\nafter incubation for 72 h (results not shown). Random binding\nof the AEF to the culture dish was not detected (Figure 1B).\nAEF contact induces OPC proliferation\nOn prolonged incubation with AEF, we noted that the number\nof OPCs was significantly increased after 24 h. We incubated\nincreasing amounts of AEF with OPC and found a dose-\ndependent increase in the amount of proliferation (Figure 2).\nThis dose-dependent increase in cell number diminishes with\nAEF concentrations in excess of 100 mg/ml (results not shown).\nThe experiment was conducted using both basal DMEM with no\nadditives as well as defined medium without B104 (described in\nthe Methods) with similar results.

Next to heparin,\nthe most efficient extraction was achieved with 2 M NaCl salt\nthat removed about half of the original mitogenic activity\nwith a 5.8-fold enrichment in specific activity. Alkaline\nextraction (0.25 M sodium carbonate/sodium bicarbonate, pH\n9) solubilized 19.3% of the original protein with moderate\nmitogenicity recovery (36%).

The\nresults are shown in Figure 5. Note that under the untreated\nconditions there was a 4-fold increase in the mitogenicity of\nthe salt extract. The AEF-salt extract alone was completely\ninactivated by heating at 60\u00b0C for 10 min or by trypsin\ndigestion. In contrast, in the presence of 100 mg/ml of\nheparin the mitogenic activity of salt extract was not\naffected by heat or trypsin treatment, similar to the\nbehaviour of the heparin extract. We conclude that heparin\nbinds to the AEF mitogen specifically, and the formation of a\nheparin\u00adprotein complex induces a conformational change of\nthe AEF mitogen that stabilizes the biological activity of the\nmitogen.\nTo assess the possibility that the AEF mitogen might be\nsimilar or identical with the brain-derived, heparin-binding\ngrowth factors, we investigated the mitogenicity of the\naFGF and bFGF (basic fibroblast growth factor) on cultured\nOPCs under our experimental conditions. As shown in\nFigure 6, both aFGF and bFGF were potent mitogens for\ncultured OPCs. Purified aFGF gave a more than 50-fold\nstimulation at a protein concentration of 100 ng/ml, with\nFigure 4 Stimulation of cultured OPCs with extracts of AEF\nCultured OPCs were seeded on 96-well plates and stimulated with increasing amounts of PBS, AEF-heparin extract, AEF-salt extract,\nAEF-detergent extract and AEF-pH 9 extract.

We also\nexamined the effect of heparin on the mitogenicity of both\naFGF and bFGF. As shown in Figure 6, 100 mg/ml of heparin\npotentiated the mitogenicity of aFGF on cultured OPCs about\n8-fold but had no effect on the bFGF activity. The half-\nmaximal stimulation concentration of aFGF in the presence\nof 100 g/ml heparin was 1.1 ng/ml, similar to that obtained\nfor bFGF.\nTo determine the affinity of the AEF mitogen for heparin,\nproteins in the AEF-salt extract were bound to an Affi-Gel-\nheparin column and eluted using a 0.15\u00ad2.0 M salt gradient.\nFigure 7 shows the elution profile of protein and the\ndistribution of the mitogenicity in the gradient. While most\nof the proteins were eluted from the column at the salt\nconcentration below 0.8 M, the major peak containing\nmitogenic activity was found at the salt concentration\nbetween 1.0 and 1.5 M.

The proteins were\nelectrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose paper and\nincubated with rabbit antiserum against bovine brain aFGF or\nbFGF. The anti-bFGF antibody detected 1\u00ad5 ng of bFGF but did\nnot detect any immunoreactivity of 10 ng aFGF. Similarly, the\nanti-aFGF antibody recognized 10 ng of aFGF but did not\ncross-react with 10 ng bFGF, thus confirming the specificity of\nthese antibodies. No band of immunoreactivity could be\ndetected in either AEF-salt extract or fraction eluted with 1.5\nM NaCl by using anti-bFGF (results not shown). However, the\nanti-aFGF antibody detected a protein in both the AEF-salt\nextract and the fraction eluted by 1.5 M NaCl from the heparin\naffinity column. The protein migrated to the 17.5 kDa position,\nwhich is consistent with the migration of the FGF standards\n(Figure 8). Based on the stimulation of oligodendrocyte\nproliferation observed with these extracts (Figure 4), and\nassuming that all that activity was due to aFGF, there should be\n1\u00ad2 ng of aFGF in those two lanes, and the intensity of the\nimmunoreactivity is consistent with this estimation. These\nresults unequivocally confirm the presence of aFGF in the AEF-\nsalt extract.\nAEF-OPC contact activates kinase pathways\nThe increase in the number of OPCs detected using both the\nCyQuant and MTT assays could be due to both increased OPC\nproliferation and/or survival after AEF treatment. To elucidate\nwhich cellular mechanism was responsible for the increased\nnumber of OPCs, we examined the activation of two well-\ndocumented pathways in OPC, MAPK and Akt (protein kinase\nB). Activation of the MAPK [ERK1/2 (extracellular-signal-\nregulated kinase 1/2)] pathway is known for its downstream\neffect on cell proliferation and differentiation. Following\ntreatment with AEF, we found a rapid increase in the\nexpression of the phosphorylated form of MAPK (Figure 9A).\nThe peak of this increase was detected as early as 5 min after\ntreatment and remained at 15 min but tapered to basal levels\nby 30 min. Activation of Akt and its subsequent signalling\ncascade have effects on both cell survival and proliferation.\nWe found increased levels of phosphorylated Akt peaking\napprox. 5 min following AEF incubation and with continued\nactivation at 15 min (Figure 9B).\nOPC proliferation is MAPK dependent but Akt\nindependent\nTo gain more insight into the pathway responsible for OPC\nproliferation, OPC were stimulated with AEF in the presence\nor absence of inhibitors of the MAPK pathway (PD-98059) or\nthe Akt pathway (triciribine). The results are shown in\nstimulation of proliferation was inhibited significantly\n(P,0.05 compared with baseline AEF proliferation). On the\nother hand, AEF stimulation of OPC in the presence of 100 mM\ntriciribine (Akt inhibitor) had no effect on proliferation. These\ndata are consistent with the view that AEF-stimulated OPC\nproliferation was MAPK dependent but Akt independent.\nOPC survival increases following AEF treatment\nSince the CyQuant and MTT assays were mainly used to assess\nproliferation, we wanted to examine whether AEF treatment\nplayed a role in cell survival via the Akt pathway. Given the\nactivation of both the MAPK and Akt pathways during\nnormal OPC culture, it was not clear as to whether the\nincreased number of OPCs in AEF-treated cultures was due to\nan increase in cell proliferation, cell survival or both. The\npercentage of live OPCs within AEF-treated cultures was\nmeasured by counting the number of live cells within a field\nFigure 7 Elution of mitogenic activity of AEF-salt extract from heparin\naffinity column\nAEF-salt extract was bound to Affi-Gel-heparin in phosphate buffer (20 mM,\nFractions (0.8 ml) were collected and salt concentration was reduced to 0.15\nM by the use of a PD-10 desalting column.

The percentage of live cells in AEF-\ntreated cultures was compared with the percentage of live\ncells in untreated cultures at 24-h intervals over 3 days. A\nsignificant increase in the number of live cells in AEF-treated\ncultures was observed at 24 h (Figure 11). At subsequent time\npoints, there was no significant increase in cell number in\nthe AEF-treated cultures relative to appropriate untreated\ncontrols.\nAEF-treatment reduces the extent of OPC\ndifferentiation\nGiven the AEF-dependent induction of both the MAPK and\nAkt pathways, the effect of AEF-treatment on early OPC\ndifferentiation was investigated. After 24 h, the number of\nAEF-treated OPC expressing nestin (an intermediate filament\nprotein) and A2B5 (Figure 12B, arrows), was increased\ncompared with untreated OPC (Figure 12A). Few AEF-treated\nOPC expressed nestin alone (asterisk \u00ad Figure 12B), while the\nmajority of the AEF-treated OPC co-expressed both nestin\nastrocytes were detected in close proximity to nestin and\nA2B5-positive OPC in AEF-treated but not in untreated\ncultures (asterisk\u00adFigure 12B), which may indicate that AEF-\ntreated immature OPC may preferentially signal to and\nrequire close contact with astrocytes under these culture\nconditions. In agreement with previous studies that showed\naxolemmal fragments diminish astroglial proliferation (Sobue\nand Pleasure, 1984), an increase in astrocyte proliferation\nwith AEF treatment was not observed (results not shown). In\nuntreated OPC at 24 h, there was a marked increase in the\nnumber of OPC co-expressing CNPase and O4 which displayed\na more mature morphology with numerous branched processes\n(Figure 12E). In contrast, the AEF-treated OPC expressed\nlimited CNPase which was restricted to the cell body. The\nAEF-treated OPC did not express O4 at all (Figure 12F),\nsuggesting a more immature stage of maturation. After 48 h,\nthe untreated cultures had both increased GalC and O4-\npositive OPC (Figure 12G), which exceeded the amount of GalC\nexpression in the AEF-treated cultures (Figure 12H). Limited\npunctate GalC expression can be seen on the cell bodies and\nproximal processes of AEF-treated OPC, possibly indicating the\nstart of maturation (Figure 12H, arrows). The emergence of\nspecific populations of transferrin-positive OPC in the\nuntreated cultures (Figure 12G, asterisks) could suggest a\nsecond wave of differentiation occurring in these cultures.\nTaken together, these data demonstrate that the majority of\nthe OPC in the untreated cultures have already lost immature\nmarkers such as nestin and A2B5 and now express more\nmature markers such as CNPase, O4 and GalC. In contrast, the\nAEF-treated OPCs are maintained in a more immature state,\nevidenced by the continued expression of nestin and A2B5, the\nlimited expression of CNPase, O4 and GalC, and an immature\nmorphology with more limited extension and branching of\nprocesses.\nDISCUSSION\nIn the present study, we have demonstrated that an AEF\nisolated from adult myelinated axons stimulates the prolif-\neration, promotes the survival and arrests the differentiation\nof OPCs in culture. Axonal signals responsible for regula-\ntion of oligodendrocyte proliferation and differentiation as\nwell as survival are currently a topic of intense investigation.\nSince the AEF can be isolated only from well-myelinated\naxons, we could not generate an AEF from less mature or\nactively myelinating axons for comparison of the relative\npotencies of these signals during development. It is not\nFigure 9 OPC incubated with 50 mg/ml AEF show a rapid increase in\nphosphorylated MAPK and activated Akt\n(A) Densitometric quantification of Western blots probed for activated MAPK\nshows peak activation at 5 min in the AEF-treated OPC compared with the\nuntreated OPC.

The present study demonstrates the persistence\nof axonal signals for proliferation and survival, in the\naxolemma of fully myelinated mature axons. The converse\nhas also been reported, namely that neurites from embryonic\ndorsal root ganglia can stimulate adult OPCs to divide (Wood\nand Bunge, 1986). Our laboratory has also reported that\nunder the proper conditions adult rat OPCs can be stimulated\nto divide by AEF (Vick and DeVries, 1992). Fields has recently\nsummarized the evidence that even in the fully matured CNS,\nneuronal signals influence the thickness of the myelin sheath\n(Fields, 2008). The persistence of axonal signals in mature\nmyelinated axons is consistent with the view that these\nsignals could be reactivated by neuronal activity at later\nstages of development, perhaps at the paranode and at the\nnode of Ranvier.\nSeveral studies have reported that the mitotic signal for\nmyelinating glial cells is specific to the AEF. We have previously\nreported that the dose-dependent stimulation of rat OPC\nproliferation by rat AEF is not present in a myelin-enriched\nfraction, red blood cell membranes or a membrane fraction\nprepared from astrocytes (Chen and DeVries, 1989). In addition,\nneither granule cells nor a membrane fraction derived from\ngranule cells was mitogenic for cultured OPCs (Mason et al.,\n1990). Since the neuronal mitogen for OPCs and Schwann cells\nmay be co-localized (Mason et al., 1990), it is relevant to cite\nevidence of the specificity of AEF for Schwann cells. Plasma\nFigure 10 OPC number is MAPK dependent\nAn MTT assay was used to evaluate the effects of 50 mg/ml AEF in the presence of an MAPK (PD-98059) and Akt inhibitor\n(triciribine).

(1983). These data\nare consistent with the view that the mitogen for OPCs in AEF\nis specific and not due to a generalized effect of any membrane\nfraction on OPCs.\nSince the AEF is a vesicular preparation, for proper cell\u00adcell\nsignalling, it is critical that these vesicles are oriented with\nthe outside out rather than being inside out. If the vesicles\nwere in an outside-in orientation, this orientation would not\nallow molecules that are on the surface of the axolemma in\nvivo to interact with the surface of the OPCs. Three lines of\nevidence indicate that the majority of the AEF vesicles are in\nthe outside out orientation. First, freeze fracture studies of the\nAEF revealed distribution of membrane particles consis-\ntent with an outside-out orientation (Cullen et al., 1981).\nFigure 12 AEF treatment negatively regulates OPC differentiation\n(A) Untreated OPC cultures express little nestin (green), A2B5 (blue) or GFAP-positive astrocytes (red) when induced to differentiate\nfor 24 h. (B) AEF-treated cultures have numerous OPC that co-express nestin and A2B5 (arrows) as well as some cells with only\nnestin expression (*). (C, D) Higher-power images of these cells show co-localization of nestin and A2B5 along OPC processes\nand cell bodies. AEF-treated cultures also contain increased numbers of GFAP+ astrocytes. (E) Untreated cultures stained positive\nfor more mature OPC markers such as CNPase (green) and O4 (blue) at 24 h. CNPase and O4 staining co-localized on processes\nand cell bodies.

Interestingly, a\nmore immature subpopulation of transferrin-positive cells (red with *) is emerging.

This binding is only possible if the\nmembrane vesicle is properly polarized (Catterall et al., 1979),\nwhich requires an outside-out orientation. Finally, detergent\ntreatment of AEF does not increase the specific activity of the\nexternally orientated acetylcholinesterase, implying that none\nof this enzyme, which is externally orientated and enriched in\nthe preparation (DeVries et al., 1983), is trapped inside the\nmembrane vesicles, i.e. the AEF vesicles have an orientation\nthat is outside out (G.H. DeVries, unpublished work). Therefore,\nthe AEF preparation has an orientation that allows the surface\nof the axolemmal vesicles to interact with the outer surface of\nthe OPCs, mimicking the cell\u00adcell contact in vivo.\nAlthough evidence has been presented to indicate that\naxonal signals for proliferation of OPC are secreted by axons\n(Richardson et al., 1988), there are abundant data to suggest\nthat the mitogenic signal for OPCs is membrane bound. No\nmitogenic activity can be detected in the supernatant of\nhigh-speed centrifugation of the AEF (G.H. DeVries, unpub-\nlished work). Wood and Bunge (1986) first reported that in\nculture, only OPCs that had contacted neurites were\nstimulated to divide, which our laboratory has also confirmed\n(Mason et al., 1990). In further support of the tight\nassociation of the AEF mitogen with the membrane, we have\npreviously reported that the AEF-related mitogenic signal for\nSchwann cells and OPCs are both tightly membrane bound\nA membrane-bound mitogenic signal implies that the mi-\ntogenic effect of AEF is mediated by direct contact of the\nAEF with the cultured OPCs. Given the similarity of the AEF\nmitogen for both Schwann cells and OPCs (Mason et al.,\n1990), studies that support direct contact of the AEF with the\nsurface of the Schwann cell are informative. For example,\nfluorescent labelled AEF quickly localizes to the outer sur-\nface of Schwann cells and eletron microscopy studies confirm\nthis cell surface localization. Direct contact of AEF with\nSchwann cells is also supported by the observation that, in\ncontrast to myelin, AEF does not require internalization and\nlysosomal processing for its mitogenic activity (Meador-\nWoodruff et al., 1985). AEF specifically binds with high\naffinity to the surface of Schwann cells, but it does not bind\nat all to fibroblasts, consistent with AEF-Schwann cell surface\nbinding. Treating the AEF with trypsin or heat inactivation\ndecreased mitogenicity and adhesion to cultured Schwann\ncells in a parallel fashion, further supporting the cell surface\nlocalization of the AEF mitogen (Sobue and Pleasure, 1985).\nThe extraction of the AEF mitogen by heparin (Table 1)\nindicates that the AEF mitogen is bound to a heparin-like\nmolecule that is displaceable by heparin. Therefore it is likely\nthat at least some of the mitogenicity in AEF is bound to cell\nsurface heparin-related molecules and in this manner is\npresented to the oligodendrocyte surface as a result of cell\u00adcell\ncontact.\nFor the first time we report that at least half of the\nmitogenicity in the AEF for OPCs is due to aFGF. A number of\nlines of evidence support this view. The properties of the AEF\nmitogen are identical with those of aFGF: it is extracted\nby 1.5 M NaCl (Table 1), it is displaceable from the AEF by\nheparin (Table 1), it is potentiated and protected by heparin\n(Figure 5), and its elution profile from a heparin affinity\ncolumn (Figure 7) is consistent with the elution profile of\naFGF from a heparin affinity column (Thomas et al., 1991).\nFinally, PAGE analysis of the peak of mitogenic activity eluted\nfrom the heparin affinity column and the 1.5 M extracted\nmitogen unequivocally identify the mitogen as aFGF. A\nquantitative analysis of the mitogenicity in the salt extract\nleads to the conclusion that aFGF, is the only mitogen present\nin that fraction. For example, the mitogenicity for OPCs in a 5\nmg/ml heparin-stimulated AEF-SE (soluble 2.0 M NaCl extract\nof the AEF) is equivalent to 5 ng/ml of heparin-stimulated\naFGF. PAGE analysis of AEF-SE (Figure 8) revealed that there\nis 1 ng of aFGF/mg of AEF-SE. Therefore, the 5 mg/ml AEF-SE\ncontains 5 ng of aFGF, which can account for the total\nmitogenicity in the AEF-SE. If OPCs respond not only to aFGF\nbut also to other growth factors in the AEF-SE, a proliferation\ngreater than can be accounted for by the aFGF in the AEF-SE\nshould be observed that is not seen in our experiments. We\nconclude that the major mitogen extracted by 2 M salt from\nthe AEF is aFGF.\nHowever, the AEF-SE represents only 50% of the total\nmitogenicity in the total AEF fraction (Table 1), raising the\ninteresting possibility that the AEF could contain other\nmitogenic signals in addition to aFGF. Preliminary results\nindicate that like the AEF-SE, the salt-extracted AEF pellet\nwas able to stimulate the proliferation of FGF-sensitive\ncultured fibroblasts and cultured OPCs, suggesting that the\nnon-dissociable AEF mitogen might be similar to the salt\ndissociable mitogen (S.-J. Chen and G.H. DeVries, unpublished\nwork). The best candidate for this tightly associated mitogen\nis bFGF, because bFGF has been localized in neurons and\nbecause bFGF usually associates much more tightly with a\nheparin or heparin-like molecule than aFGF (Gospodarowicz\nanalysis of AEF has confirmed that bFGF is present in the\npreparation (S.G. Becker-Catania and G.H. DeVries, unpub-\nlished work). However, given that there are high levels of\nbFGF in astrocytes (Gonzalez et al., 1995), we cannot exclude\nthe possibility that if bFGF is in the preparation, it may be\nderived from bFGF released from astrocytes during prepara-\ntion of the AEF. Further investigations will be required to\nclarify this matter, since the tightly bound mitogen has not\nyet been identified.\nThe identification of aFGF and potentially bFGF as axonal\nmitogens for OPCs is consistent with the localization of these\nfactors in the CNS. We have previously reported that cultured\ndorsal root ganglion neurons express both aFGF and bFGF on\nthe surface of neurites after 20 days in culture (Neuberger\nand DeVries, 1993a). Both these growth factors were present\non the surface of neuritic vesicles after a crush injury to\nneurites that had been cultured for 30 days (Neuberger and\nS.G. Becker-Catania and others\n64 E 2011 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\naFGF was localized in neurons and not glial cells, with\nstrong aFGF immunoreactivity in the axonal membrane of\nmyelinated axons. Since the AEF is derived from myelinated\naxons, it is not unreasonable to find aFGF in the AEF. In\naddition, Butt and Berry (2000) proposed that FGF is an\naxonal signal that regulates myelination based on in vivo\nstudies of the effect of FGF on myelination in the rat anterior\nmedullary vellum. We conclude that the presence of aFGF in\nAEF is consistent with its distribution in the CNS and reflects\nthe in vivo expression of aFGF associated with the axonal\nplasma membrane in myelinated axons.\nHowever, other molecules associated with the AEF may also\ncontribute to the observed effects of AEF on OPCs. For\nexample, it is known that both BDNF (brain-derived\nneurotrophic factor) and basic FGF induce oligodendrocyte\nproliferation (McTigue et al., 1998; Mason and Goldman,\n2002) and AEF also contains BDNF and bFGF (S.G. Becker-\nCatania and G.H. DeVries, unpublished work). NRG (neuregulin)\nI isoforms have also been reported to play a major role\nin signalling that affects oligodendrocyte specification,\ndifferentiation, myelination and survival, at least in vitro\nand beta isoforms of NRG I Type II have been detected in AEF\n(J.K. Fitzgerald and G.H. DeVries, unpublished work), it is\nreasonable to propose that these NRG I isoforms may stimu-\nlate the MAPK and Akt pathways. It is interesting to note that\nNRG I (III) is completely absent from CNS axons and AEF (Bare\net al., 2011). Therefore, it is not likely that this isoform of\nNRG I plays any role in the biological effects of AEF on OPC\nalthough NRG I (III) is a critical axonal initiation factor for PNS\n(peripheral nervous system) myelination (Taveggia et al., 2005)\nand modulates CNS myelination (Taveggia et al., 2008). In any\ncase, it is clear that activation of MAPK (ERK, specifically p42\nand p44) is required for AEF-stimulated OPC proliferation to\noccur (Figure 9).\nIn addition to MAPK and Akt, AEF is also likely to influence\nother downstream signalling pathways related to prolifera-\ntion. For example, CREB (cAMP-response-element-binding\nprotein) has been reported to be a major mediator of the\nMAPK pathway regulating OPC proliferation (Johnson et al.,\n2000). AEF has been shown to induce both the expression and\nis possible that AEF-stimulated proliferation of OPC may\nresult from the induction and phosphorylation of CREB and\nsubsequent activation of MAPK in the OPC.\nThe metabolic pathways in OPCs which are activated by\nAEF are consistent with pathways known to be activated\nby FGF. For example, FGF activates both the Akt and the\nMAPK pathways (Yim et al., 2001). FGF activation of the Akt\npathway prevents apoptosis in the OPCs lineage (Yasuda\net al., 1995), which is consistent with the protective effect of\nAEF on oligodendrocyte survival possibly mediated by the AEF-\nassociated FGF (Figure 11). Evidence has also been presented to\nsuggest that FGF plays a subtle role in oligodendrocyte\nmaintenance in the mature CNS (Harari et al., 1997). It is\npossible that in the mature CNS, AEF-associated FGF may play\nthis role. Butt and Berry (2000) reported that in vivo FGF\nretarded oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination. The\ninhibitory effect of aFGF and bFGF on OPC differentiation in\nvitro has also been reported (Engele and Bohn, 1992). Further\nstudies showed that the inhibitory effect of FGF on\noligodendrocyte differentiation was mediated by a specific\nFGF receptor known to be present on OPCs (Zhou et al., 2006).\nThese data raise the possibility that AEF-associated FGF could\nmediate the inhibition of OPC differentiation that we observed\n(Figure 12). In summary, many of the biological effects\nobserved when AEF contacts OPCs may be due to the FGF\nfound in the AEF.\nThe ability of AEF to prevent OPC differentiation is\ninteresting and unexpected. Although it would seem logical\nthat OPC\u00adAEF contact would stimulate myelinogenesis,\nrecent evidence suggests several explanations for this\ninhibitory effect. The Gallo laboratory recently reported that\nERK activation in OPC up-regulated c-Jun, which in turn has\na negative effect on myelin gene expression (Chew et al.,\n2010). Therefore the sequence of events after addition of AEF\nto OPC could include rapid activation of ERK leading to\nstimulation of c-Jun, inhibition of myelin gene expression,\nand repression of other myelin markers as noted in Figure 12.\nSubsequent activation of p38 MAPK would repress ERK and\nJNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) activity and via up-regulation\nof Sox 10 stimulate the expression of myelin markers (Chew\net al., 2010). These data would imply that signals other than\nthose found in the AEF will be necessary to stimulate\nmyelinogenesis after axonal contact is re-established follow-\ning demyelination. The Notch1 signalling pathway in OPC is\nanother FGF-activated pathway known to inhibit OPC\ndifferentiation (Zhang et al., 2009). In OPC, downstream\ntargets in the Notch signalling pathway such as mastermind-\nlike 1 and Hes 5 were activated by FGF signalling and\ninhibited OPC differentiation (Zhou and Armstrong, 2007).\nTaken together these data raise an interesting possible\ninhibitory role for the axolemma after demyelination.\nEvidence has been presented that after demyelination, the\nNotch signalling pathway is specifically activated in OPCs\nnear demyelinated lesions (John et al., 2002). The high\nexpression of a ligand that activates the Notch1 signalling\npathway (Jagged 1) was noted in hypertrophic astrocytes\nand postulated to inhibit oligodendrocyte differentiation via\nsecretion of Jagged 1 by astrocytes, subsequent activation\nof the Notch pathway, followed by inhibition of OPC\ndifferentiation. After demyelination, contact of OPC with\nthe surface of demyelinated axons containing FGF could\nactivate these downstream effectors in the Notch signalling\npathway and further inhibit OPC differentiation. In any\ncase, the pathways activated by FGF and the downstream\neffects of this activation are consistent with the localiza-\ntion of FGF on the axonal surface of mature myelinated\naxons.\nAfter demyelination, rapid OPC ensheathment can promote\naxonal preservation that is required not only during\ndevelopment but also after demyelination when the axon is\nEffect of AEF on OPC\nE 2011 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nin a metastable condition (Franklin and Kotter, 2008;\nKassmann and Nave, 2008). Therefore, it is advantageous\nfor the demyelinated axon to rapidly signal to the appropriate\nmyelinating cell, expediting rapid myelin ensheathment. In\nthis regard, we have shown that within 5 min after addition\nof AEF to OPC, both the MAPK and Akt activation are almost\nat maximal levels (Figure 10). We have also reported a similar\nrapid induction of axonal signals to Schwann cells (Saunders\nand DeVries, 1988). It has been reported that maximal AEF-\ninduced Schwann cell proliferation requires 24 h of exposure\nto AEF in spite of the fact that maximal AEF adhesion to\nSchwann cells is reached after 6 h (Sobue and Pleasure, 1985).\nAlthough initial axonal contact may cause a rapid metabolic\nresponse in both Schwann cells and OPC, sustained axonal\ncontact is required to achieve a proliferative response. AEF\nbinding to OPC persists even after 72 h in culture (see\nFigure 12). We have previously reported that AEF signalling to\ninduce CREB expression reaches a maximum at 72 h (Lee\net al., 1996). These data suggest that the OPCs are not able to\nphagocytose or break the binding between the AEF\nmembrane fraction and the OPC cell surface for at least\n72 h (Meador-Woodruff et al., 1985). This persistent AEF-OPC\nbinding suggests that if OPC are supplied to a freshly\ndemyelinated axon, then after binding, the OPC would rapidly\nreceive the appropriate signals to survive and multiply, but\nfurther signals may be required for differentiation. A possible\ncandidate for the differentiation signal is LIF (leukaemia\ninhibitory factor), which the laboratory of Fields has\nidentified as a key signalling molecule for the initiation of\nhas been presented that LIF-negative mice have impaired\nremyelination implying a role for LIF in remyelination\nIn summary, the present study demonstrates that axonal\nsignalling to OPC leading to proliferation and survival as well\nas arrested differentiation can result from direct axonal\ncontact with the OPC. aFGF has been identified as a key\nfactor in the AEF preparation relating to mitotic stimulation\nof OPCs by AEF. These results are consistent with the report of\nButt and Berry (2000) who concluded that axons and OPC\nform interdependent functional units and that axons govern\nthe number of OPCs and their differentiation state. Current\nstudies are aimed at further identification of factors in the\nAEF that also contribute to regulation of OPCs.\n"
