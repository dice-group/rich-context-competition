The study also determined the relative power of the\npredictor variables in the classification. The accuracy with which the sample participants were classified into acculturation\ngroups was also explored. One hundred four first-generation Nigerian immigrants (N = 104) were recruited for the study.\nThese participants lived in different states across the United States. Discriminant function analysis (DFA) was conducted to\ndetermine acculturation group memberships, the relative power of the predictors, as well as the accuracy of classification\nof the sample. Findings suggested that the Nigerian immigrants were classified into five acculturation groups, which were\nintegration, assimilation, separation, assimilation and separation, as well as integration and assimilation. The assimilation and separation\nacculturation strategy was most frequently endorsed by the Nigerian sample, whereas the integration option was the least\nreported. The most powerful discriminant functions were immigration support and self-efficacy. Reclassification accuracy\nwas 64.8%. Nigerians in the United States, and perhaps Africans in general, may be using two parallel acculturation strategies\nto navigate the mainstream culture in plural societies. This preference is likely linked to their multicultural backgrounds.\nTherefore, integration as an acculturation strategy may not be the favored option among Nigerians living in the United States.\nFurthermore, immigration support and self-efficacy were revealed as important markers for the classification of the Nigerian\nsample into acculturation groups. These are areas that require further exploration.\n",

Acculturation is a process character-\nized by changes in one's culture, which occurs when people\n(mainly immigrants and native-born minorities) adjust to the\nmainstream culture of a plural society (Sam, 2000).\nAcculturation as a phenomenon has received attention since\nthe 19th century, and within the 21st century, a number of\nacculturation theories have been postulated (Rudmin, 2009).\nIn recent times, acculturation has evolved from a unidimen-\nsional concept of assimilation, such as the American melting\npot model, to a complex concept of biculturalism or cultural\nidentity involving multiple factors (Berry, 2003). One recur-\nring theme in the literature is the relationship between accul-\nturation, mental health, and physical health (Alex-Assensoh,\nracial group in the United States is bound to experience the\nrelationship between these variables (i.e., acculturation,\nmental and physical health) differently. This, along with the\nrapidly increasing cultural diversity within the North\nAmerican continent (Ramos, 2005), has necessitated the\nstudy of acculturation and its current impact on the public.\nMigration is usually associated with educational, societal,\neconomic, health care, and demographic variations (Aroian,\n2005). During the acculturation process, a combination of\nthese factors and experiences instigate stressful life changes\nthat lead to what Berry (1992) called acculturative stress.\nSimply put, acculturative stress is responsible for lowering\nthe overall and adequate level of functioning of an individual\ndue to exposure to a variety of social and cultural stressors.\nIn 2001, Berry identified four characteristics as the founda-\ntion upon which acculturation is based. These characteristics\ninclude one's cultural heritage, cultural identity, relationship\nwith out-group members, and the ethnic minority/majority\nperspective on the acculturation strategies utilized to adapt to\nthe mainstream cultural way of living.\nBerry proposed four acculturation patterns, which are\n(a) assimilation, (b) separation, (c) integration, and (d)\n1Alliant International University, Fresno, CA, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nNnenna Ndika, University of Rhode Island, 90 Lower College Road, Suite\nEmail: nndika@yahoo.com\nAcculturation: A Pilot Study on Nigerians\nin America and Their Coping Strategies\nNnenna Ndika1\n Keywords\nfirst-generation Nigerian immigrants, acculturation strategies, discriminant function analysis (DFA), immigration support,\nself-efficacy\n2 SAGE Open\nmarginalization. From the ethnic minority perspective, Berry\n(2001) described assimilation as the willingness to adapt to the\nhost culture at the expense of losing one's cultural heritage and\nidentity. Separation was defined as the preference for the\nretention of one's cultural heritage at the expense of adapting\nto the new culture. Integration was described as the willing-\nness to learn some aspects of the host culture, as well as the\nwillingness to retain some aspects of one's cultural heritage\nand identity. Finally, marginalization was explained as mean-\ning one's unwillingness to retain one's cultural heritage or\nidentity, as well as the unwillingness to learn the new culture.\nThe acculturation strategies that immigrants use to adjust\nto a foreign culture have been univocally linked, in many\ncases, to both psychological and physical well-being.\nTherefore, it has become pertinent to determine the accul-\nturation patterns among the different ethnic subpopulations\nin the United States, especially among groups that are his-\ntorically understudied such as Nigerian immigrants.\nIdentifying the acculturation patterns among Nigerians in the\nUnited States and the Diaspora in general would provide\nvaluable insights about an additional area to assess when\nNigerian immigrants need mental health services.\nFurthermore, the acculturation strategies that people use\nto fit into a novel culture can be predicted by certain socio-\ndemographics variables. According to Iman (2008), some\nvariables that predict acculturation attitudes are age, resi-\ndency, education, and so forth. Therefore, the purpose of the\npresent study was to identify acculturation group member-\nships based on socio-demographics (predictor variables)\ndata. In addition, the relative power of these predictor vari-\nables and the accuracy with which the sample was classified\nwere also at the crux of the research project.\nDesign\nAs part of a larger research project, the current pilot study was\nconducted to predict acculturation group memberships among\nfirst-generation Nigerian immigrants. The study also sought\nto determine the relative power of the predictors and the accu-\nracy of classification. Acculturation was the dependent vari-\nable (grouping variable) in the study. This variable had five\nlevels, which were integration, assimilation, separation,\nassimilation and separation, assimilation and integration.\nAlthough immigrants commonly endorse marginalization as\nan acculturation strategy, among the current study sample the\nuse of this strategy was not reported. The independent vari-\nables (predictors) were the socio-demographics data and psy-\nchological constructs. The psychological variables were\ndepression, anxiety, stress, and self-efficacy.\nMethod\nParticipants\nOne hundred four (104) adults, who are first-generation\nNigerian immigrants, and who resided in different states\nacross the United States, were recruited for the study. There\nparticipants, respectively. Mean age of the participants was\nand standard deviation, SD = 11.82 years. The inclusion cri-\nteria for participation in the study were (a) being raised in\nNigeria and (b) being 18 years or older. The exclusion crite-\nria were (a) poor literacy and lack of fluency in the English\nlanguage and (b) having active psychoses.\nInstruments\nSocio-demographics questionnaire.A socio-demographics\nquestionnaire was developed specifically for the study. This\ninstrument has 33 items. The socio-demographics question-\nnaire was used to gather information on participant age, sex,\ncurrent employment status, current physical and mental\nhealth statuses, current income, residential area, job satisfac-\ntion, place of birth, marital status, years of legal residency in\nthe United States, immigration experience, level of social\nsupport, influences on choice of destination country, the\nhighest level of education attained, and so forth.\n(Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995) is a short-form version of the\nfull Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS), which is a\n42-item measure. The DASS-21 has three subscales (7 items\nfor each subscale), which were used to collect data on depres-\nsion, anxiety, and stress.\nSelf-Efficacy Scale (SES). SES (Sherer et al., 1982) is a mea-\nsure for self-efficacy. The scale is a 30-item inventory\ndesigned to measure (a) general self-efficacy and (b) social\ndated the SES to foster its suitability to Nigerians. According\nto Omoluabi, the SES assesses (a) competence and effective-\nness in work performances and (b) efficacy in handling social\nrelationships among Nigerians.\nProcedure\nParticipants completed a socio-demographics questionnaire,\nand an acculturation measure, the Nigerian-American\nSystemic Acculturation Scales (NASAS; Ndika, 2012,\nunpublished). The acculturation tool was constructed for use\non Nigerian immigrants in the Diaspora, particularly in the\nUnited States. The socio-demographics questionnaire and\nthe NASAS were administered, along with measures for self-\nefficacy, depression, anxiety, and stress. The subscale scores\nobtained from the NASAS were submitted to the Statistical\nPackage for the Social Sciences (SPSS) discriminant func-\ntion analysis (DFA), to determine acculturation group mem-\nberships. That is, the acculturation strategies the current\nsample uses to adapt to the American mainstream culture.\nThe relative importance of each predictor variable in classi-\nfying the Nigerian immigrant sample into various\nacculturation groups, as well as the classification accuracy of\nthe model, was also determined.\nA correlation matrix was generated to examine the rela-\ntionships between the socio-demographics data, the psycho-\nlogical constructs, and acculturation. Of the predictor\nvariables, seven correlated most strongly with acculturation\n(grouping variables). These seven predictor variables had\nconceptual meanings, which supported their suitability as\nindependent variables in the DFA. The variables were sex,\nresidential area, length of residency, influences on choice of\ndestination in the country, stressful immigration experience,\nsocial support, and self-efficacy.\nResults\nOf the total sample, $60,000 was the median annual income,\nwere gainfully employed. See Table 1 for a summary of\nsocio-demographics variables of the study sample.\nDFA\nOn the first iteration, most of the cases were not accounted\nfor. This suggested that some of the sample participants\nmight have reported the use of more than one acculturation\nstrategy. Rudmin (2006, p.1), who is a prominent acculturation\nresearcher, wrote, \"The acculturation paradigm of measuring\nassimilation, separation, integration and marginalization\nconfuses dimensional and categorical conceptions of its con-\nstructs, fails to produce ipsative data from mutually exclu-\nsive scales . . ..\" Based on this premise, combinations of\nacculturation strategies were derived from the three basic\nacculturation patterns (integration, separation, and assimila-\ntion) that emerged from principal component analysis of the\nNASAS. (These acculturation patterns were derived from the\nlarger project.)\nFollowing further computations, five acculturation groups\nemerged, which were integration, separation, assimilation,\nintegration and assimilation, as well as assimilation and sep-\naration. Consequently, of the 104 cases submitted to SPSS\nDFA, 71 cases were processed. This number of cases satis-\nfied the minimum ratio of valid cases to independent vari-\nacculturation groups that emerged from the current sample\ndata.\nOf the seven predictor variables, three significant predic-\ntors were identified. These significant predictors included\nstressful immigration experience, social support, and self-\nefficacy. Three additional predictor variables approached\nsignificance. These were residential area (p = .067), length\nof residency (p = .053), and influences on choice of destina-\npredictor in this model. See Table 3 for a summary of the\nsignificant predictors in the discriminant function model.\nTable 1.

This finding suggested that the variances in\neach of the acculturation groups were approximately equal.\nRefer to Table 4 for a summary of the Box's M test of equal-\nity of covariance matrices.\nOf the four discriminant functions that emerged from the\nanalyses, only two functions were significant. The first dis-\nficients indicated correlations between the predictor variables\nand discriminant functions, from which meaningful names\nwere derived for each dimension. Discriminant Function 1,\nwhich was the most important dimension, had to do with\nsocial support and stressful immigration experience. Function\n1 was named immigration support, thereby producing a new\nvariable (name) used to discriminate between acculturation\ngroups. Discriminant Function 2 was self-efficacy.\nbetween the predictor variables and the acculturation groups,\nwhile Function 2 had a slightly lower canonical correlation\nstructure weights and canonical coefficients, the variables\nappeared to be strongly related to Discriminant Functions 1\nand 2, respectively. This, as it seemed was because of their\nlarge structure weights, as well as their unique contribution\nto the model (standardized canonical coefficients). Refer to\nTable 5 for a summary of the standardized canonical coeffi-\ncients and the structure weights of the variables.\nAnalyses of the Discriminant Functions (i.e., the\nDimensions)\nImmigration support (Function 1). The sample participants in\nthe integration and assimilation group reported having the\nmost support during the immigration process. Following the\nintegration and assimilation acculturation group were those\nin the assimilation category, who endorsed they received\nimmigration support, but to a lesser extent than those in the\nformer group. Participants classified in the separation group\nreported they received immigration support, which was less\nadequate than the amount the Nigerians in the assimilation\ncategory reported they received. Furthermore, the Nigerians\nclassified in the assimilation and separation acculturation\ngroup, as well as those who were categorized in the integra-\ntion group, endorsed that they experienced the least amount\nof support during immigration.\nSelf-efficacy (Function 2). The Nigerian participants classified\nin the assimilation and separation category reported having\nthe highest self-efficacy ratings, which was followed by the\nendorsements of those in the integration and assimilation\ngroup. Participants in the separation category reported the\nlowest self-efficacy ratings. Although the participants in the\nintegration group also reported having the tendency for low\nlevels of self-efficacy, their ratings were observed to be\nslightly higher than those, who were classified in the separa-\ntion category. Participants in the assimilation group endorsed\nself-efficacy ratings that fell between the levels endorsed by\nthe participants, who had indicated the lowest self-efficacy\nratings (i.e., members of integration and separation groups),\nand those who had endorsed the highest levels of self-effi-\ncacy (i.e., members of the assimilation and separation group,\nand integration and assimilation group). Findings suggested\nthat immigration support and self-efficacy ratings are the\nimportant markers for classifying Nigerian immigrants based\non the acculturation strategies they utilize as they adapt to\nthe American mainstream culture. Figure 1 presents a scatter\nplot graph of the various acculturation groups, which were\ndifferentiated on the basis of immigration support and\nself-efficacy.\nApproximately sixty-four percent (64.8%) of the cases\nwere reclassified correctly by the DFA, which meant that,\nwith a chance factor of 50%, 46 of the 71 cases were correctly\nreclassified. This percentage is probably an overestimation of\nthe classification accuracy of the model, because it was tested\nwith the same sample used to construct the model. Cross-\nvalidation on a different and a larger Nigerian immigrant\nsample is necessary. This is important especially when the\ndiscriminant function model is to be used in the clinical set-\nting, rather than to describe group differences for theoretical\nTable 3.

See Table 6 for a summary of the re-classification\nacculturation group memberships.\nDiscussion\nIndividuals living in plural societies might have to develop a\nvariety of acculturation strategies, with which they navigate\nand cope with the multicultural contexts and diversity of the\npeople with whom they interact. Most of the Nigerian par-\nticipants, who had resided in the United States for more than\n20 years (n = 33), might have developed complex strategies\nwith which they adapt to the American lifestyle. The major-\nity of the sample reported that they simultaneously use the\nassimilation and separation (n = 25, 24%) acculturation\nstrategy to adapt to the mainstream culture in the United\nStates. The sample endorsed integration (n = 10, 9.6%) as\nbeing their least utilized acculturation strategy. The latter\nfinding is contrary to the predominant viewpoint in\nliterature.\nRudmin (2006) suggested that immigrants, aboriginal\npeople, and the native-born ethnic minority often strive for\nassimilation into the prevailing culture of a plural society.\nThis means that assimilation is generally perceived as the\nend result of the acculturation process. Literature further\nsuggests that assimilation into the mainstream culture in a\nplural society is often preceded by the integration of one's\nindigenous culture and the new culture. This can be inter-\npreted as follows: Integration is the starting point for many\nindividuals, who have the desire to be assimilated into the\nLiterature on the preferred acculturation strategies used\nby immigrants and ethnic minorities is mixed. On the one\nhand, literature reveals that unidimensional acculturation\nstrategies are used by immigrants and ethnic minorities in\nplural societies to adapt to the mainstream cultural way of\n2006). Conversely, the utility of bidimensional acculturation\npatterns is also widespread among immigrants, ethnic minor-\nities, and aborigines (Jang, Kim, Chiriboga, & Kallimanis,\nLiterature that supports the use of the bidimensional\napproach to acculturation suggests that individuals navigate\nmulticultural contexts from more than one cultural perspec-\ntive. This is opposed to the unidimensional approach to\nacculturation, where individuals are believed to approach\nacculturation from one isolated cultural standpoint, as they\nadapt to multicultural contexts. When an individual navi-\ngates multicultural contexts from at least two cultural per-\nspectives, he or she is said to use the integration acculturation\nstrategy. Integration, which is interchangeably referred to as\nbiculturalism, is unanimously defined as the retention of\nsome aspects of one's cultural heritage and identity, as well\nas learning some aspects of the host culture (Berry, 1970,\nmay be adjusting to the American cultural life, differently.\nSince the majority of Nigerians in the current study have\nlived for many years in the United States, it is likely they\nhave modified their ethnic identity. Ethnic identity is one's\nperceived membership in a social, cultural, and ethnic group,\nwithin which similarities such as cognitions, emotions, phi-\nlosophies, and other characteristics are shared (Ashmore,\n2002). A large number of participants in the present study\nappeared to have a flexible ethnic identity, within which they\nperceive themselves as being Nigerian (separated), as well as\nbeing American (assimilated).\nEthnic identity flexibility could be described as having an\nethnic self-concept, which gives individuals the malleability\nFigure 1.

The finding\nis not surprising. After all, literature has shown that immi-\ngrants maintain, and in some cases promote, their mental\nhealth by engaging in their traditional practices, economic\nfreedom, as well as the willingness to learn about the host\nculture (Knipscheer & Kleber, 2007). To this end, it may be\nan appropriate intervention to encourage and support immi-\ngrants in general to develop a flexible ethnic identity to facil-\nitate the adaptation process.\nTherefore, in this study, the assimilation and separation\nacculturation strategy should be seen as markedly distinct\nfrom integration. The integration acculturation strategy was\nthe least endorsed by the Nigerian immigrant sample, while\nthe former strategy was mostly reported as the preferred\noption. The definition of integration connotes a blending of\ncultures (aspects of the indigenous culture and aspects of the\nhost culture), from which the emergence of a new and unique\nproduct (subculture) is expected. This is not the case with\nmany of the Nigerian immigrant participants, who reported\nthat they have adjusted or are adapting to life in the United\nStates using two acculturation strategies, simultaneously\n(i.e., separation and assimilation). Assimilation and separa-\ntion are two acculturation strategies used by Nigerians as\ncircumstances demand. Thus, findings from the study do not\nsupport integration as the most frequently endorsed accul-\nturation strategy among this Nigerian immigrant sample, and\nperhaps among Africans in the Diaspora, in general.\nsimilar results as the current study. Merametdjian assessed\nthe acculturation patterns of Somali refugees in Norway. She\nfound that many of the Somali participants endorsed more\nthan one acculturation pattern, as their preferred adaptation\nstrategy. However, while the Somali participants most fre-\nquently endorsed marginalization and integration, the cur-\nrent Nigerian sample reported the use of assimilation and\nseparation.\nDespite the strong similarities between Merametdjian's\nstudy and the present study, there lies a major difference in\nthe interpretation of the respective findings. Merametdjian\nattributed the failure to produce mutually exclusive data\nfrom the integration, assimilation, separation, and marginal-\nization subscales, to psychometric problems. It is possible\nthat psychometric problems may exist within many accul-\nturation scales, as declared by Rudmin (2006), especially the\nmeasures fashioned after Berry's model of acculturation.\nYet, this may be a literal interpretation. Underlying this lit-\neral interpretation, it is more likely that human beings do not\nuse, actually, cannot use, one exclusive acculturation strat-\negy during any adaption process.\nBecause acculturation is a dynamic process, it likely\ndemands multidimensional strategies. People are likely to\ndevelop dominant and auxiliary strategies with which they\nnavigate and cope with multicultural contexts and diversity.\nTherefore, to adjust to the American cultural lifestyle, immi-\ngrants, ethnic minorities, and even the ethnic majority might\nhave to develop multiple acculturation strategies. To this\nend, it is logical to assume that acculturation strategies will\nbe used interchangeably depending on circumstances.\nFrom a practical perspective, ethnic identity develop-\nment and the acculturation processes have similar pathways\nmain stages of ethnic identity development. These stages\ninclude the pre-encounter stage, the encounter stage, a\ntransition period, and then the internalization stage. The\nNigerians who endorsed the assimilation and separation\nacculturation strategy might also, simultaneously, be in the\ninternalization stage of ethnic identity development. The\ninternalization stage, which is the last stage of ethnic iden-\ntity development, is described as the high point of adult\nmental health (Cross, 1978). During the internalization\nstage, immigrants especially those who have resided in their\nnew countries for a long time tend to become culturally flex-\nible, and aware of their personal and group power, as well as\nfreedom (Watson, 2002). This naturally fosters better self-\nunderstanding and self-confidence, as well as the accep-\ntance of other groups. This may be the Nigerian case.\nWatson (2002) demonstrated the similarities between eth-\nnic identity development, and the assimilation and separa-\ntion acculturation pattern (used as interchangeable\nacculturation strategies) among African immigrants from\nNigeria, Ghana, Sierra Leone, Uganda, and Ethiopia. One of\nher participants, who is a Ghanaian immigrant, stated, \"I tell\nthem (my children) every day. This house is Ghana. When\nyou go outside, that is America. Inside my house, this is\nGhana and you will do according to the Ghanaian culture.\nThey respect that.\" This strategy is true for many Africans in\nthe Diaspora. For many of the first-generation Nigerian\nimmigrants in the study, the assimilation and separation\nacculturation strategies, especially when utilized inter-\nchangeably, might be a familiar and positive way of living\nwith culturally diverse people.\nKalin and Berry (1994) disclosed that people with multi-\ncultural backgrounds might more readily accommodate and\nrespect other people, who are culturally different. This may\nnot be an enduring quality in people from predominantly uni-\ncultural societies. Nigeria, like most African nations, is a\nconglomeration of different ethnic nations bound together\nunder a common political and economic government. These\nethnic groups have unique customs, traditions, cultures, his-\ntories, and languages. Yet, for decades, the members of these\ndiverse Nigerian ethnic groups have retained their unique-\nness, while mutually exchanging cultures and traditions with\none another. Therefore, the indigenous Nigerian can be said\nto be constantly in contact with multiple cultural/social con-\ntexts. This is mostly true for those who have migrated from\nthe rural areas to urban centers within Nigeria.\nAs the present study shows, to every rule, there are usu-\nally exceptions. Although the majority of the Nigerian\nsamples reported the use of the assimilation and separation\nstrategies, they also reported the use of alternative accultura-\ntion strategies. The Nigerians, who endorsed both the inte-\ngration and assimilation acculturation strategies, may have a\ngreater inclination to assimilate into, than separate from, the\nAmerican mainstream culture. Those who endorsed the use\nof one strategy for adjusting to the American cultural life-\nstyle may also be using an additional, but less preferred\nacculturation option. Whatever strategies immigrants choose\nto adopt during the acculturation process, the common ele-\nment is likely a longing to forge amicable relationships with\nout-group members. This does not necessarily encourage the\nloss of one's cultural identity and heritage (such as assimila-\ntion into the host culture, or integration of both the host and\nindigenous cultures, which connotes a blending of these cul-\ntures). It is psychologically adaptive for individuals living in\nmulticultural societies to develop ethnic identity flexibility,\nwhich encourages the use of acculturation strategies as situ-\nations demand.\ncited in Rudmin, 2006) recorded similar results from their\nrespective studies. Their participants were Westerners and\nEasterners, who endorsed the use of unidimensional accul-\nturation strategies for adjusting to their host cultures. These\nfindings appeared to show a link between their unicultural\nbackgrounds and their preference for unidimensional accul-\nturation strategies. Likewise, among Merametdjian's (1995;\nas cited in Rudmin, 2006) Somalian participants in Norway,\nand the current study's Nigerian participants in the United\nStates, their preferred acculturation styles appeared to be a\nreflection of their multicultural backgrounds. These are\ninteresting areas that require further exploration.\n"
