    "abstract": "Abstract: Working memory (WM) theoretically affords the ability to privilege social\nthreats and opportunities over other more mundane information, but few experiments have\nsought support for this contention. Using a functional logic, we predicted that threatening\nfaces are likely to elicit encoding benefits in WM. Critically, however, threat depends on\nboth the capacities and inclinations of the potential aggressor and the possible responses\navailable to the perceiver. Two experiments demonstrate that participants more efficiently\nscan memory for angry facial expressions, but only when the faces also bear other cues that\nare heuristically associated with threat: masculinity in Study 1 and outgroup status in Study\n2. Moreover, male participants showed robust speed and accuracy benefits, whereas female\nparticipants showed somewhat weaker effects, and only when threat was clearly expressed.\nOverall results indicate that working memory for faces depends on the accessibility of self-\nprotective goals and on the functional relevance of other social attributes of the face.\n",

William James (1890) proposed that this is what\nprimary memory--or its modern variant, working memory (WM)--is for: It thrusts to\nFacial cues and working memory\ncenter stage the key threats and opportunities of social life. Unfortunately, this functional\nthinking has not remained at the forefront of modern conceptions of WM, which tend to see\nit as a domain-general resource working equally well regardless of its contents.\nWe believe that WM does have specialized functionality; it prioritizes information\nrelevant to goals fundamental to successful survival and reproduction (e.g., self-protection,\ndisease-avoidance, mate acquisition, etc.). From this perspective, while many of the faces\nthat we encounter in day-to-day life readily slip from our mind, clear threats (and possibly\nopportunities) should elicit encoding efficiencies in WM to facilitate adaptive responses\nshould they suddenly reappear.\nThere is good precedent for the functionalist claim that basic\nmotivational/emotional systems penetrate and modulate cognitive processes (see Kenrick,\nNeuberg, Griskevicius, Becker, and Schaller, 2009). Functional biases have been\ndemonstrated for attention (e.g., Anderson et al., 2010; Maner, Gailliot, Rouby, and Miller,\n2007), spatial memory (Becker, Kenrick, Guerin, and Maner, 2005), information pick-up\n(Becker et al., 2010), and categorization (Miller, Maner, and Becker, 2010). Surprisingly,\nhowever, little research has investigated how the availability of recently encountered faces\nin WM storage might reflect such functional considerations.\nIndeed, although there are many purported demonstrations that angry faces elicit\npreferential attention, they tend to focus on attention to stimuli that are present (e.g., Fox,\nRusso, and Dutton, 2001) rather than looking at how attention efficiently encodes and holds\nonto the image of an angry face once it is out of sight. For example, there are well-known\nstudies that purport to show that angry faces exert preattentional effects, automatically\ndrawing our eyes to their location (e.g., \u00d6hman, Lundqvist, and Esteves, 2001). We--and\nothers--have recently argued against this claim: Well-designed studies suggest that the\nangry face actually eludes efficient detection, at least relative to happy targets (Becker,\n2009). Nevertheless, despite doubts about the existence of preattentional benefits for angry\nfaces, once attention has found a face and recognizes anger, we expect very efficient\nprocessing. We predict that this heightened vigilance will continue even if the angry face\nsuddenly disappears. In other words, anger will be prioritized in short-term/working\nmemory storage.\nA functional approach to social cognition also entails that we cannot ignore the\ncontext and the perceiver's expectations about a face, because all angry faces are not\nequally threatening. Indeed, there are biological regularities that have been consistently\nencountered in our ancestral past, and such regularities have very likely become key inputs\nto any threat-avoidance calculus. Consider that men are more likely to be perpetrators of\nphysical violence than women (Daly and Wilson, 1988). If threat avoidance mechanisms in\nthe brain have come to account for this, angry men, rather than women, should be the ones\nthat generate the strongest representations in WM storage.\nWhat about the gender of the perceiver? Men have historically been more likely to\nengage in intergroup conflict with other men, as well as intrasexual competition with one\nanother for mates. The male-warrior hypothesis (Van Vugt, De Cremer, and Janssen, 2007)\nsuggests that men evolved proclivities to form coalitions and battle with one another for\nmates and resources. Although the social implications of this hypothesis are typically\ndiscussed, it also stands to reason that this has led to a constellation of sex differences in\nthreat cognition. Specifically, the male warrior hypothesis may entail that men will be more\nFacial cues and working memory\nvigilant to anger in a strange male, maintaining such a face in WM so that they can rapidly\nrespond if the individual is encountered again. Of course, women are also victims of male\nviolence and sexual coercion, and in choosing mates, prefer kindness to meanness (Buss,\n1989). These factors could sensitize their memory for strange male faces in a similar way,\nbut we think the connection to an angry face is nevertheless more tenuous--other\nexpressions often precede violence against a weaker opponent and/or sexual coercion.\nConsequently, in addition to hypothesizing that angry male faces elicit more activation in\nWM, we think it is reasonable to predict that male participants might show the effect more\nrobustly, reflecting their biological preparedness for intergroup conflict with other males,\nand that this should particularly influence the speed with which they respond.\nIn the present experiments, we explore WM's attunement to threatening faces using\nSternberg's (1969) memory scanning method, in which participants memorize a small set\nof items and are then presented with a series of \"probes,\" each of which requires a rapid\ndecision indicating whether it is a member of the memory set or not. It therefore yields\nmeasures of both the accuracy and the speed of retrieval. It is important to note that storage\nin WM is limited (e.g., Cowan, 2001); this bottleneck imposes constraints on threat\nattunement that are not present at other processing stages that do not have such constraints,\nlike early perception or long-term memory.\nWe predicted a general attunement to anger but, following previous work (e.g.,\nMiller et al., 2010; Becker, Mortensen, et al., 2011), also predicted that other cues to\nthreat--particularly target sex--would moderate the effect. Moreover, given that WM is a\nlimited capacity resource, anger vigilance may operate at the expense of performance with\nless threatening faces. We also thought it plausible that the profile of performance would\ndiffer for male and female perceivers, with men privileging rapid responses to threat.\nExperiment 1\nMaterials and Methods\nThirty-two women and 32 men participated in exchange for course credit.\nParticipants were greeted by an experimenter and directed to one of several computers,\neach separated by large dividers. Stimuli were presented to participants seated\napproximately 22 inches away from 17-inch color monitors, and E-Prime experiment\ndisplay software was used to ensure precise recording of decision reaction time (registered\nwith the computer keyboard).\nParticipants completed four blocks of 32 trials each. In each block, participants\nwere instructed to view a set of four faces and hold these in memory. This memory set was\npresented for 10 seconds and consisted of two male and two female Caucasian faces, with\none of each gender making a slightly angry facial expression. To control the degree of\nanger expressed across faces, we modified neutral faces in Photoshop, lowering the center\nof the brow and tightening the mouth. Pre-testing indicated that all of these faces were rated\nas \"slightly angry\" or \"angry\" in the context of other expressive faces culled from standard\nstimulus sets, and there were no sex differences in these ratings. Participants then viewed\n32 memory probe trials, each consisting of an individual face and requiring a rapid decision\nconcerning whether or not it was in the original memory set. Half of these faces were from\nFacial cues and working memory\nthe original memory set and half were from a set of four new faces selected to reflect the\nsame factorial combination of gender and expression.\nThe order of the face types in the initial presentation of the memory set was fully\ncounterbalanced across participants, as was whether the face appeared as a target or a foil\nfor a given subject. In the memory test phase, each face was repeated four times, and the\norder of presentation was random.\nResults\nOne female participant was eliminated from the analysis for having accuracy three\nstandard deviations below the mean. Table 1 includes a variety of performance measures\nthat collectively indicate the presence of response biases as well as sensitivity effects. Our\nanalyses will focus on contrasts that address the specific hypotheses that motivated this\nresearch: 1) Do angry faces elicit more efficient processing? 2) Are angry male faces\nparticularly memorable? This later hypothesis is best explored by a contrast of angry male\nfaces with all others. Such contrasts are not necessarily (or even typically) the same as\ninteraction tests of moderation; indeed, the power of such tests can differ considerably\n(Rosenthal, Rosnow, and Rubin, 2000). Since this contrast more directly addresses the\nspecial status of the most threatening face in a limited capacity storage resource like WM, it\nhas the potential to better account for the variance in the results.\nTable 1. Performance in experiment 1 as a function of participant sex and face type\nHit Rates False Alarms Accuracy (d') Bias (C)\nMedian Correct RT\nMemory\nSet Hits\nCorrect\nRejections\nMale Participants\nFemale Participants\nNote. Standard deviations in parentheses.\nDo angry faces elicit more efficient processing? Hit rates were significantly higher\ninteraction with participant sex at this general level (see ahead). There was, however, also a\ndifference (3.5%) in false alarms (i.e., incorrectly saying that a new angry face was part of\naccuracy advantage (d-prime) for angry faces, but there was a significant bias (c) to\nidentify angry faces, regardless of their presence or absence in the memory set, t(62) =\n3.99, p < .001, dCohen = 0.50. This bias marginally interacted with participant and target sex,\n2 = 0.59, suggesting that the specific contrasts examining\nFacial cues and working memory\nadvantages for male faces presented in the next section may be more appropriate. Turning\nto median correct reaction times, we saw no general benefit for angry faces over neutral\nfaces, although sex differences did emerge for both target-present trials, t(62) = 2.12, p =\nmarginally faster with angry faces compared to neutral faces, whereas women exhibited\nsignificantly slower reaction times to angry faces than neutral faces, t(30) = 2.33, p = .027.\nThis is consistent with the idea that men need to be able to respond rapidly to a threat,\nwhereas women process the same stimuli more slowly and maintain accuracy.\nAre angry MALE faces particularly vivid in working memory? Across participant\nsex, hit rates were 3.0% higher for angry male faces than all other faces, t(62) = 2.21, p =\n.030, dCohen = 0.28, but there was no corresponding difference in false alarms. Although\nacross participants there was a non-significant trend for greater accuracy (d-prime)\nidentifying angry male faces relative to all others, t(63) = 1.44, p = .073, the effect was\nbenefit for male participants occurred in the absence of any significant bias. Moreover, this\nsensitivity to angry male faces compared to all other faces was accompanied by a 59 ms\neffects were observed in female participants with the exception that their correct rejection\ntimes for angry male faces were slower than all other faces, t(30) = 2.02, p = .026, dCohen =\nAs can be seen in Figure 1, Experiment 1 showed that male participants retrieved\nangry male faces from working memory more efficiently than neutral and/or female faces.\nThis sex-specific vigilance is consistent with the male warrior hypothesis (Van Vugt et al.,\n2007), which should entail that men are more vigilant about signs of physical threat coming\nfrom other men. More generally, however, we see distinct profiles for the sexes: Men\nprioritize angry male faces at the expense of all others, whereas women show more\nequivalent performance for all faces. This may reflect the fact that women employ a more\nbalanced set of strategies, and vigilance for affiliation opportunities may actually be more\nadaptive than a straightforward prioritization of interpersonal threat.\nFigure 1. Male (left) and female (right) participant memory accuracy (d-prime) and\nretrieval speed (for memory set hits, in milliseconds) as a function of face gender and\nexpression\nFacial cues and working memory\nDiscussion\nWe expected and found more pronounced threat-vigilance in male participants.\nAlthough contrasts of anger vs. neutrality produced some significant anger benefits,\nanalyses that contrasted angry faces vs. all others were far more informative. Here, male\nparticipants showed clear advantages in both speed and accuracy identifying angry male\nfaces, which were likely to be the most threatening faces in the limited capacity storage of\ntheir WM.\nDespite these positive results for male participants, it is curious that women showed\nequivalent processing of neutral faces, because they are also frequent victims of anger. One\npossibility is that the expressions in the stimuli--which were only slightly angry--may not\nhave passed a threshold for threat-identification in our female participants. Furthermore,\ngiven that outgroup men are especially likely to be seen as posing a physical threat\ncompared to ingroup men (e.g., Navarrete, McDonald, Molina, and Sidanius, 2010;\nSidanius and Pratto, 1999), angry men of another race might be more likely to elicit\nadvantages in WM. Finally, if men are chronically primed for intergroup conflict with other\nmen, it may be that women need self-protective goals to be made more salient in order to\nbring them into alignment with male psychology.\nTo explore these possibilities, in Experiment 2 we used a different stimulus set in\nwhich anger was clearly expressed, and replaced all the female faces in the memory set\nwith Black male faces, as a previous study using students from the same University found\nBlack men were most stereotypically associated with the potential to do harm; Cottrell and\nNeuberg, 2005). In addition, half of our participants listened to a frightening story (used in\nBecker et al., 2010) to prime thoughts of interpersonal aggressive threat, in the hopes of\nenhancing the accessibility of self\u00adprotective goals. We predicted that this would further\nenhance the processing of threatening faces, and hoped that it would elicit a threat-vigilant\nprofile in women that was similar to that seen in men in the control condition.\nExperiment 2\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants were 81 non-Black students from introductory psychology classes (42\nmale) in a design similar to that in Experiment 1, but with two important changes. First,\neach memory set consisted of two Black and two White male faces, with one of each race\nmaking a clearly angry facial expression (in order to have a sufficient numbers of faces, we\nused the expressive faces of Tottenham et al., 2009, whereas neutral faces were from\nBecker et al., 2010). Second, we primed self-protective concerns by exposing half the\nparticipants to a 3-minute audio recording asking them to visualize being alone in a house\nwith an intruder, and compared this to a control condition in which the other participants\nvisualized organizing their desks for a similar amount of time.\nResults\nFive participants were eliminated from the analysis for having mean accuracy more\nthan three standard deviations below the grand mean. Means are included in Table 2.\nFacial cues and working memory\nTable 2. Performance measures in Experiment 2 as a function of participant sex, condition,\nand face type\nHit Rates False Alarms Accuracy (d') Bias (C)\nMedian Correct RT\nMemory\nSet Hits\nCorrect\nRejections\nMale Participants\nFemale Participants\nDo angry male faces elicit processing benefits? Across participant sex, hit rates\ndCohen = 0.70. There was thus a large accuracy advantage with regard to angry male faces\nreaction times, participants were faster to identify angry male faces, t(74) = -3.15, p = .002,\ndCohen = -0.36, and they were faster to correctly reject angry male faces not in the memory\nAre angry Black male faces even more efficiently processed? For hit rates, there was\naccuracy for angry Black faces. The accuracy (d-prime) effect was even larger, F(1,72) =\n2 = .17, and no reaction time differences compromised this sensitivity\nbenefit.\nAre these effects moderated by participant sex? Men had higher hit rates for angry\ncompromised these effects.\nAre these effects moderated by the self-protection manipulation? There were no\noverall benefits of the self-protection prime--i.e., it did not make working memory work\nmore efficiently--but there were effects that arose as a function of face type and participant\nFacial cues and working memory\nsex. There was a marginal accuracy (d-prime) benefit for angry faces under the self-\ncondition. Intriguingly, this effect seems largely driven by female participants--t(35) =\ncondition, consistent with our speculation that interpersonal aggression concerns are not as\nchronically active in women as men. The self-protection prime also marginally enhanced\nwomen's bias to say that they had seen Black men, regardless of whether they were present\nIn contrast, male participants, who were already at ceiling performance in their accuracy\nfor angry Black male faces, showed marginally greater accuracy for ingroup angry faces in\nanger to which men are attuned, rather than race.\nFigure 2 illustrates these results. The upper panel shows that non-Black male\nparticipants under the self-protection manipulation showed the greatest accuracy benefits\nfor remembering angry Black faces. The lower panel shows that they also showed the only\nsignificant reaction time improvement when self-protection had been primed. Interestingly,\nwomen also showed significant benefits for accuracy and trends toward faster responding\nunder the self-protection manipulation.\nFigure 2. Benefits for angry male faces relative to neutral male faces\nNote. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals\nFacial cues and working memory\nDiscussion\nThe results of two experiments suggest that angry male faces are vividly\nrepresented in WM. The first experiment revealed that slightly angry male faces were more\nrapidly and accurately retrieved, but the effect was driven by male participants (see Figure\n1). This finding supports a novel prediction derived from the male-warrior hypothesis (Van\nVugt et al., 2007): Men's WM processes are attuned to evidence of anger in another male\nface.\nA second experiment verified this anger vigilance effect with faces that were more\nclearly angry, and found the effect for women as well as men. This second study also\nincluded faces of Black men--an outgroup that our non-Black participants presumably\nassociate with physical threat (given the findings of Cottrell and Neuberg, 2005, using the\nsame participant population). Although the overall accuracy and speed benefits were larger\nfor Black angry male faces, these effects were not as robust as the general anger advantage\ncollapsing across race.\nPriming a sense of self-protection by having participants imagine the threat of\ninterpersonal violence enhanced this general anger vigilance, but in different ways for male\nand female participants. Male participants showed more rapid identification of angry\noutgroup men once self-protection had been primed. But self-protection primes led to\nslower responses to the correct identification of black males with neutral facial expressions,\nand these targets also garnered the lowest accuracy. This suggests that the well-known\ncapacity limitations of WM may be strategically reallocated when self-protective\nmotivations are aroused--we do not have evidence that these manipulations increase the\ncapacity or efficiency of WM. Female participants show different reallocations of\nefficiency when self-protection has been primed: more rapid identification of all black male\nfaces, regardless of expression, accompanied by a marginal bias to say that black men were\npresent in the memory set, regardless of whether they were. Taking these results together,\nour self-protection prime appears to enhance men's vigilance (both speed and accuracy) to\nangry (male) faces at the expense of neutral (especially Black) faces, while it biases women\ntoward saying that outgroup men have been seen before. Navarrete and colleagues (2010)\nalso observed effects specific to participant sex, with the implication that men were attuned\nto threats of interpersonal aggression, while women were more attuned to threats of sexual\ncoercion from outgroup members.\nIn light of the finding that male participants show the most robust WM attunements\nto angry male faces, it is important to note that we know of no past memory studies that\nhave shown such a sex difference. Men were the only participants to show any effects with\nthe slightly angry faces in Experiment 1, and they showed larger effects than women in\nExperiment 2. Given that these sex differences have not been observed in past experiments\nthat focus on retrieval from long term memory (e.g., Ackerman et al., 2006; Becker et al,\n2010), it may suggest that WM is a better place to find functional sex differences. This\nstands to reason if it is truly limited in its capacity--reallocation of processing resources\nwould be one adaptive solution to such a bottleneck. We nevertheless think it is premature\nto entirely dismiss the possibility that emotional/motivational manipulations can sensitize\nor amplify the capacity of WM.\nFacial cues and working memory\nConclusion\nPast research has suggested that angry faces are \"special,\" in the sense that self-\nprotective goals have sculpted perceptual and cognitive systems to be on the lookout for\nanger (Fox et al., 2001). Although a growing chorus of researchers have questioned the\npreattentional basis for anger advantages (e.g., Becker, Anderson, et al., 2011; Horstmann,\n2009), we should not dismiss the claims that angry faces are privileged once we have\nattended to them. It seems clear that angry faces hold onto attention, resisting efforts to\nrapidly look away from them (Becker, Anderson, et al., 2011; Fox et al., 2001), and that\nthey elicit better recognition (Ackerman et al., 2006). Our results provide direct evidence\nthat WM is also attuned to anger, which suggests a link between visual attention and long-\nterm benefits. Moreover, the functional relevance of the face appears to exert nuanced\neffects in WM storage, which suggests that this testing method could be used to establish a\nhierarchy of the functional priorities of the WM system.\nConsistent with this, other cues to threat appear to potentiate the effect, because it is\nthe angry man that is most privileged in WM processing. This vigilance to angry men\nsuggests that self-protective goals are automatic and autonomous; it can be seen even in the\ncontrol condition. Priming participants to think about self-protective goals enhances the\ndegree to which angry male faces grip WM resources, and the present results suggest that it\nmay recruit additional processing to bring other threat cues--like race--to the foreground.\nGoals and needs have been known to modulate the initial stages of cognition since\nthe early days of cognitive psychology, when Bruner ushered in the \"New Look\" in\nperception by showing that poor children perceive coins to be physically bigger than do\nmore affluent children (Bruner, 1957; see Fessler and Holbrook, 2013 for a conceptual\nreplication). We believe that all cognitive processes are on the threshold of receiving a\nsimilar \"New Look\" (Kenrick et al, 2009). Memory researchers, in particular, are beginning\nto investigate how survival and reproductive fitness concerns differentially engage memory\nsystems (Nairne, Thompson, and Pandeirada, 2007). The present findings show a more\ndomain-specific enhancement of the stimuli linked to particular survival concerns. Overall,\nthe present results suggest that encoding efficiency can depend on perceivers' current social\ngoals and the functional relevance of the social information being processed. The presence\nof such encoding priorities may reveal key insights into how WM deals with the important\nthreats and opportunities of social life.\n"
