Accord-\ning to a recent report from the European Centre for Disease\nControl (ECDC) and the European Medicines Agency, .25000\npatients in the European Union (EU) die each year from infections\ncaused by multiresistant bacteria.1 Antibiotic use is widely\nregarded as a major driver of resistance,2 especially in ambula-\ntory care settings; a direct correlation has been clearly\ndescribed.3 For this reason, many countries have launched cam-\npaigns aimed at increasing awareness among both the general\npublic as well as the medical and pharmaceutical professions.4\nSince 2008, the EU, through the ECDC, has encouraged public\ninformation campaigns on prudent antibiotic use in its member\ncountries, by promoting a European Antibiotic Awareness Day\n(EAAD) on the 18 November.5 Nevertheless, concerns have\nbeen raised that such campaigns are not having their anticipated\nThere is a significant difference in antibiotic consumption per\ncapita between European countries.8 Interestingly, this variation\nhas a clear geographical pattern.

Using data analysis from thousands of detailed\ninterviews, conducted in 53 countries, Geert Hofstede has formu-\nlated a model showing that world cultures vary along consistent,\nfundamental dimensions, which can be grouped into specific\nconstructs: power distance (PDI), individualism (IND), masculinity\n(MAS), uncertainty avoidance (UAI), long-term (versus short-\nterm) orientation (LTO) and indulgence versus restraint (IVR)\n(Figure 1).11,12 Each dimension carries a designated score,\nwhich varies from country to country. Therefore, it is possible\nto undertake correlation analysis with behavioural statistics to\nascertain possible cultural influences.\nIn 2010, the European Commission published a Eurobarom-\neter study that had been carried out between 13 November\ncovered residents aged 15 years in each country. The basic\ndesign, identically applied to all countries, was a multistage,\nrandom probability assessment using a number of sampling\npoints proportional to the population size. These data are freely\naccessible for use and further evaluation.13\nMethods\nFor the purpose of the study, Eurobarometer data were extracted and\nrelated to the proportion of respondents, by country, who replied\ncorrectly to four questions assessing their knowledge that antibiotics:\nare not active against viruses; do not work on colds and flu; can\nbecome ineffective if used unnecessarily; and their use can potentially\nbe associated with serious side effects. Also noted were the respective\nproportions of respondents, by country, who stated that they had\ntaken at least one course of antibiotics in the previous year for colds/\nflu/sore throat (CFSt). Lastly, the proportion of respondents in each\ncountry who said that they had received information in the previous\nyear about the importance of using antibiotics correctly was identified.\nIndividual scores for PDI, IND, MAS, UAI, LTO and IVR were accessed\nfor each EU country from http://www.geerthofstede.nl/research--vsm/\ndimension-data-matrix.aspx. These scores were then correlated, by\ncountry, with the proportion of respondents who had taken antibiotics\nfor CFSt. Multiple linear regression models were built in order to establish\noverall relationships; these were carried out using the backward stepwise\ntechnique utilizing, as the dependent variables, the proportions of people\nwho had taken an antibiotic for CFSt. The adequacy of the models was\nconfirmed through analysis of variance, the Durbin\u00adWatson test for\nautocorrelation and collinearity diagnostics. Analyses were performed\nusing Medcalc, version 9.2.1.0 (Medcalc Software, Mariakerke, Belgium)\nand SPSS, version 15 (SPSS Inc., USA). A P value of 0.05 was taken to\nindicate statistical significance.\nPearson correlation analysis was then undertaken between the pro-\nportion of individuals per country who stated they had received informa-\ntion about antibiotics in the previous year and the proportion of\nindividuals who correctly answered all four antibiotic knowledge ques-\ntions. Individual tests of association between the use of antibiotics for\nCFSt and correct reply to each of the four antibiotic questions were\nalso performed. These were then repeated, but controlled for any cultural\ndimensions that were previously retained in the multiple regression\nmodel.\nResults\nData were extracted for all EU countries participating in the 2009\nEurobarometer survey, with the exception of Cyprus, for which no\nHofstede dimensional scores were available. These incorporated\nindividuals who indicated that they had taken antibiotics for\nCFSt in the previous 12 months varied from 11% in Finland to\nSignificant correlations for inappropriate antibiotic use in CFSt\nwere seen on univariate analysis with several Hofstede cultural\ndimensions, namely UAI, MAS, IND and IVR. However, the\nmultiple regression model retained only UAI and MAS\nables (Table 2).\nIndividuals who stated they had received information about\nantibiotics in the previous year were more likely to answer all\nfour antibiotic knowledge questions correctly (uncontrolled:\nP,0.001). Furthermore, the proportions of respondents per\ncountry who answered all four antibiotic knowledge questions\ncorrectly were also found to be inversely correlated with the\nproportions who took antibiotics for CFSt (Table 3).\nThe use of antibiotics for CFSt was inversely associated at an\nindividual level with knowledge that antibiotics are ineffective\nagainst viruses and that they do not work against colds and\nflu, as well as with awareness of the long-term impact of un-\nnecessary use. However, when the correlation analysis was con-\ntrolled for UAI and MAS country scores, only knowledge about\nPower distance (PDI) relates to the extent to which the less powerful\nmembers of organizations and institutions accept and expect that\npower is distributed unequally. It suggests that a society's level of\ninequality is endorsed by the followers as much as by the leaders.\nUncertainty avoidance (UAI) indicates to what extent a society\ntolerates uncertainty and ambiguity, and shows how comfortable its\nmembers feel in unstructured situations that are novel, unknown,\nsurprising or different from usual.\nIndividualism (IND) is the degree to which individuals are integrated\ninto groups.\nMasculinity (MAS) refers to the distribution of emotional roles\nbetween the genders. Masculine dimensions are very assertive and\ncompetitive.\nLong-term orientation (LTO) fosters pragmatic virtues oriented\ntowards future rewards; in particular, saving, persistence and\nadapting to changing circumstances.\nIndulgence (IVR) stands for a society that allows relatively free\ngratification of basic and natural human drives related to enjoying life\nand having fun.\nFigure 1.

The\nto have cost E100 million over the 6 years.14 Even though signifi-\nyear.15 In both cases, the reduction in antibiotic consumption\nrendered the investment cost-effective. Nevertheless, it is not a\nstraightforward assumption to anticipate that decision-makers\nwill immediately sign off requests for funding of such national\ninitiatives. Indeed, financial support in EU countries, even just\nfor the activities of the annual EAAD, has been far from univer-\nsal.5 It is therefore essential to establish a robust cross-national\nevidence base within Europe that validates the effectiveness of\nthese initiatives within the region.\nThe results of this study clearly show that European citizens\nwho have been exposed to information about antibiotics, and\ntheir appropriate use, are more knowledgeable about the\nsubject. In turn, they are less likely to take antibiotics unneces-\nsarily for respiratory infections of probable viral origin. The\nsame Eurobarometer survey reported that 96% of EU inhabitants\ntook antibiotics only following a prescription by a medical practi-\ntioner. Public campaigns equally impact on doctors and influence\ntheir prescribing habits.16 In fact, the model identified no correl-\nation between use for CFSt and PDI, a change from an earlier\nstudy that had used data collected before the EAAD and other\nantibiotic campaigns were introduced in Europe.17 This could\nsuggest that the recent EAAD and other campaigns may be influ-\nencing prescribing by empowering patients to resist unnecessary\nantibiotic prescriptions for CFSt from their doctors. Indeed, inter-\nventional strategies that improve doctor\u00adpatient communica-\ntion and patient empowerment have been shown to be\neffective in reducing primary care antibiotic prescriptions.18\nHowever, antibiotic campaigns have not been universally\nsuccessful in all countries. Unlike in France and Belgium, national\ncampaigns in other countries failed to show a significant reduc-\ntion in antibiotic prescriptions.7,19 Cultural differences could\npotentially explain some of these and other geographical differ-\nences in antibiotic use between European countries. Indeed,\nnational UAI and MAS constructs can explain almost half of\nthe variation of inappropriate use of antibiotics for CFSt reported\nin the Eurobarometer survey. UAI has already been suggested as\na potential driver for unnecessary antibiotic use.17 It would\nappear to be a logical choice. Mediterranean countries are\namong the largest users of antibiotics in Europe and also\nexhibit some of the highest UAI scores. High UAI nations\nexhibit a general intolerance of ambiguity and uncertainty. It is\nto be expected that patients in these countries are likely to\nfind difficulty in accepting a recommendation to manage a\nviral upper respiratory infection simply through rest and symp-\ntomatic therapy. Physicians in high UAI countries are equally\nlikely to feel uncomfortable when faced with a variety of mild\nsymptoms, such as fever, cough and sore throat, and the\ndiagnostic difficulty to fully exclude a potential, albeit unlikely,\nbacterial aetiology.20 In such circumstances, antibiotics offer a\npsychological assurance in a situation of uncertainty to both\npatient and prescriber. There is already some evidence that\nwould support this hypothesis. Harbarth et al.21 reported signifi-\ncant differences in public perspectives, prescriber attitudes and\nlevels of antibiotic use between Germany (UAI\u00bc65) and France\n(UAI\u00bc86). Similarly, differences in attitudes towards infections\nand antibiotic use have been noted between Flemish Belgians\nand Dutch residents just over the border in the Netherlands.22\nThe former has one of the highest UAI scores in Europe,\nwhereas the Dutch have one of the lowest. On the other hand,\nthe association with MAS is a novel and very interesting\nfinding. It could provide a possible sociocultural explanation for\nthe relative failure of antibiotic campaigns in parts of the UK,23\nas well as the high level of ambulatory care antibiotic consump-\ntion in the USA.24 Both countries score low on UAI, but very high\non MAS. Countries with high MAS have a strong work ethos and\ntheir citizens are often described as `living to work'. In such\nenvironments, antibiotics would be incorrectly regarded as vital\nmedicines to get back to work as quickly as possible. This\ndemand could then plausibly influence the prescriber, overtly\nThe inclusion of cultural factors into antibiotic-related behav-\niour throws up a number of ponderables. National cultural\ndimensions are reputed to have been formed from core values\nin societies, which have evolved over hundreds, if not thousands,\nof years.11 It will not be easy to change such behaviour in the\nshort or medium term. However, the success in France suggests\nthat improvement is possible, even in countries with a high UAI\nscore. It should, nevertheless, be noted that after almost a\ndecade of campaigns costing many millions of euros, France\ncontinues to be the third highest antibiotic consumer per\ncapita in Europe.9 In addition, antibiotic prescribing for respira-\ntory infections that carry more aetiological and therapeutic\nuncertainty, such as bronchitis, sinusitis, otitis media and tonsil-\nlitis, showed little or no difference after the campaign.26\nOne possible way to address UAI is by adopting strategies that\neliminate or, at least, reduce uncertainty in the population being\ntargeted. Rapid near-patient tests for Streptococcus pyogenes\noffer significant promise, as they provide a visual assurance for\nboth patient and doctor that the pharyngitis is not being\ncaused by a bacterial infection. Indeed, a recent publication\nshowed a moderate reduction in prescribing using this approach\nin Spain, another high UAI country.27 It has been recommended\nthat campaign messages need to be clear and simple, and that\nnegative, fear-inducing statements should be avoided.28 Above\nall, this study suggests that they also must be conducive with\nthe culture of the country where they are applied. A message\nthat the best remedy for colds and flu is just to rest at home\nhas been commonly used in past EAAD campaigns;4,5 however,\nit is not synchronous with high UAI and MAS cultures. On the\nother hand, an incontrovertible factual statement that viruses\nare not killed by antibiotics, and that their use will therefore\nnot reduce the duration of illness, may be more assimilable\nand effective in such cultural backgrounds.\nThe greatest strength of this study was the extensive, and\npossibly unmatched, power offered by the Eurobarometer set\nof data. No previous European survey on antibiotic perceptions\nand practices has incorporated .26000 respondents and genu-\ninely encompassed the whole of the EU, stratified in terms of\nmetropolitan, urban and rural areas. Eurobarometer data have\nvery low whole-country confidence intervals, ranging from only\nBorg\nof +3.1% for an observed proportion of 50%.13 This supported\naccurate correlations. In addition, it concentrated on inappropri-\nate use rather than total prescriptions, which is what many\nstudies have looked at in the past.4 The most important limita-\ntion was the same as that of any other study of association:\ncorrelation does not automatically infer causality. Nevertheless,\ncultural dimensions evolve from the core values of a society\nand easily pre-date modern medicine by centuries. It is logical\nto conclude that it is these fundamental values that then give\nrise to rituals, such as antibiotic-related perceptions and\npractices.\nIn conclusion, following analysis of published Eurobarometer\ndata, this study suggests that cultural dimensions, especially\nUAI and MAS, may be significantly responsible for variations in\nthe inappropriate ambulatory care use of antibiotics within\nEuropean countries. Furthermore, they support a hypothesis\nthat EU citizens who have been exposed to more information\nabout antibiotics exhibit greater knowledge on the subject. In\nturn, they are less likely to take antibiotics unnecessarily for\nCFSt. Awareness that antibiotics are ineffective against viruses\nand that misuse will render them ineffective in the longer term\nseem to be particularly relevant. These inferences can prove\nuseful to design better and more effective antibiotic campaigns\nin European countries.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by internal funding.\nTransparency declarations\nNone to declare.\nReferences\n1 European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.
