To examine the influence of social networks and social engagement on cognitive decline in a population-\nbased cohort of elderly people, and to assess gender differences in the effect of social relations on cognition.\nMethods. A longitudinal study of community-dwelling people over 65 was carried out. Cognitive function (orientation\ninstrument previously validated for populations with a low level of education. The effect of social networks, social\nintegration, and social engagement with friends, children, and relatives on cognitive function and cognitive decline was\nestimated by multiple linear and logistic regressions after adjusting for age, sex, education, depressive symptoms, systolic\nand diastolic blood pressure, and functional status.\nResults. Poor social connections, infrequent participation in social activities, and social disengagement predict the risk\nof cognitive decline in elderly individuals. The probability of cognitive decline was lower for both men and women with\na high frequency of visual contact with relatives and community social integration. Engagement with friends seemed to be\nprotective for cognitive decline in women but not in men.\nDiscussion. This longitudinal study indicates that few social ties, poor integration, and social disengagement are risk\nfactors for cognitive decline among community-dwelling elderly persons. The nature of the ties that influence cognition\nmay vary in men and women.\nRESEARCH over the past decades has demonstrated that\nsocial relations, including social networks, social in-\ntegration, and social engagement, impact significantly on the\nmental and physical health of elderly people (Berkman &\nSeeman, 2000). However, the study of the influence of social\nrelations on human cognitive decline is recent. A few\nlongitudinal studies of community-dwelling older people have\nindicated that the probability of cognitive decline and dementia\nis higher in individuals who are isolated, have poor social\nnetworks and support, and are not very physically active\n(Balfour, Masaki, & Launer, 2001; Bassuk, Glass, & Berkman,\net al., 1995; Fratiglioni, Wang, Ericson, Maytan, & Winbland,\nBerkman and colleagues (2000) have proposed a cascading\ncausal process beginning with the macrosocial to psychobio-\nlogical processes by which social relationships influence health.\nWe have adopted this model to explore the relations between\nsocial integration and cognitive aging. Social networks are\nembedded in a larger social and cultural milieu in which\nupstream forces (political economy, social stratification, gender\nroles) condition network structure. Moving downstream we\nargue with Berkman and colleagues that social networks affect\nsocial and interpersonal behavior. Networks operate at the\nbehavioral level through primary pathways, including social\nengagement and the flow of social support. These microsocial\nand behavioral processes influence more proximal pathways\nto cognitive aging, such as depression, direct physiological\nresponses to stress, and life habits that increase the probability\nof developing health conditions that lead to cognitive decline.\nThis model allows for definition of concepts such as social\nintegration, social networks, and social support. Social in-\ntegration is defined as involvement with ties spanning the range\nfrom intimate to extended. Social networks are defined by their\nstructure (number of ties, proximity of ties) and function\n(frequency of contact, reciprocity). Networks can be further\nclassified into subnetworks according to the nature or role\nspecificity of the tie (friends, relatives, children, couple). We\nargue that both the structural characteristics of the network and\nthe nature of the ties may have important and separate effects\non cognitive aging, as proposed by Glass and colleagues to\nexplain the relationship between social integration and health\nstatus (Glass, Mendes de Leon, Seeman, & Berkman, 1997).\nWe also argue that social integration is beneficial for\nmaintaining cognitive function, yet the nature of beneficial\nsocial relationships may vary in men and women. We followed\nthe hypothesis formulated by Taylor and colleagues (2000)\nbased on evidence of sex differences in the neurobiology of\nstress responses and in patterns of affiliation under stress. The\nfight or flight response may stem from an androgenic response\nto threat, activated in part by testosterone.\nJournal of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES Copyright 2003 by The Gerontological Society of America\nAnimal studies suggest that, in females, the neuro-endocrine\nsystem favors an affiliative response to stress--rather than\na fight or flight response. This literature indicates that whereas\nmales may respond to stress by ``fighting'' or ``fleeing,''\nfemales tend to respond in dyadic fashion (e.g., by bonding\nwith other females or with their young). The ``tend and\nbefriend'' pattern may be maintained not only by sex-linked\nendocrine responses to stress but also through social roles.\nHence the nature of social networks and support associated\nwith the maintenance of cognitive function may differ among\nmen and women.\nAnthropological and survey studies indicate that men and\nwomen do tend to behave differently under stress. Men tend to\nform larger groups than women, and male groups are often\norganized around defined purposes or tasks. Although men\ninvest in a large number of social relationships, many of these\nrelationships emphasize hierarchy over intimate bonding\nIn this article, data from a longitudinal study of community-\ndwelling people over age 65 have been analyzed to examine\ntwo hypotheses: (a) Older men and women with poor social\nnetworks, little social integration, and little social engagement\nare at high risk of cognitive decline, independent of established\nrisk factors, namely, age, level of education, depression, blood\npressure, and functional limitations and (b) the nature of\nthe social relationships associated with the maintenance of\ncognitive function differ by sex in older adults. More\nspecifically, emotional ties with peers would be stronger\npredictors of sustained cognitive function for women than for\nmen; and formal roles in families and other social organizations\nwould be stronger predictors of sustained cognitive function for\nmen than for women.\nMETHODS\nParticipants\nThe study population was a stratified random sample (n 5\nLegane\n\u00b4s, a suburban municipality located 8 km outside Madrid,\nSpain (Zunzunegui, Be\nsample is representative of the elderly people in Legane\n\u00b4s whose\nage, sex, marital status, and education resemble those of the\nSpanish elderly population as a whole. Data were collected in\n1993, through two home interviews and a medical exam.\nmedical exam. Because clinical diagnosis of dementia at\nbaseline was not carried out, 99 subjects with severe cognitive\ndeficit (5 or more errors in an 8-item version of the Short\nPortable Mental Status Questionnaire) were excluded from the\nanalysis for this study. In addition, 102 subjects with visual\nimpairments (unable to see 23-point characters) were also\nexcluded because they were likely to experience difficulties in\nthe visual memory test. Therefore, the sample used in this study\ninterviewed and reexamined.\nMeasurements\nCognitive performance was measured during home inter-\nviews using a scale that included several items on orientation\nand memory, excerpted from the Short Portable Mental Status\nQuestionnaire (Pfeiffer, 1975), the Barcelona Test (Pen\n~a-\nCasanova et al., 1997), and the EPESE short story recall\n(Coroni-Huntley, Brock, Ostfeld, Taylor, & Wallace, 1986).\nThis scale was developed to assess cognitive function in elderly\npopulations with low levels of formal education, for which\navailable tests have a strong education bias (Zunzunegui,\nGutierrez-Cuadra, Be\ndependent variables were considered: a continuous, almost\nnormally distributed score in 1997, and a categorical measure-\nment defined over the distribution of cognitive change between\na standard deviation of 27, and the following arbitrary\ncategorization of change was established: a change score\nwithin one standard deviation below the mean (22 to 27) was\nconsidered as ``mild decline,'' a change score larger than one\nstandard deviation below the mean was considered as ``severe\ndecline'' (scores between 28 and 223), and finally, change\nscores on and over the mean (21 to 12) were considered as\n``normal.'' A severe decline was found in 11.0% of the cohort,\na mild decline in 20.6%, and no decline or improvement in\nThe study entitled Envejecer en Legane\n\u00b4s was designed to\nassess the role of social networks and support in maintaining\nhealth and function in a aging Spanish population. Three\ndimensions of social relations were examined in the survey:\nsocial networks, social integration, and social engagement. The\nnumber of monthly visual contacts and telephone contacts with\nfriends and relatives (other than children) was ascertained via\nseveral questions from the MacArthur Healthy Aging Ques-\ntionnaire (Seeman, Berkman, Blazer, & Rowe, 1994), and three\nvariables were obtained. Only half of the sample (48%)\nreported having one or more friends (1 to 60) and a di-\nchotomous variable was considered: has or does not have\nfriends. Monthly visual and telephone contacts with relatives\nboth variables were divided into three categories for descriptive\nanalysis: no contacts, one to three, and more than three, but\nwere truncated to 15 monthly contacts (95th percentile of the\ndistribution) and introduced as continuous in the multivariate\nanalyses. We did not evaluate social networks involving\nchildren in the same way that we assessed networks involving\nfriends and other extended family, because more than half of\nour subjects live with their children, most of them live within\nwalking distance of their children and see them at least weekly,\nand 93% of the sample population have children. Therefore,\nfrequent contact with children is almost universal and governed\nby social norms. Instead, we only considered active social\nengagement (parental role providing help to children, playing\nan important role and being useful) with children, because this\ninvolvement may require more mobilization of cognitive\nfunction.\nThree dichotomous markers of social integration were\nrecorded at baseline: (a) membership in a community associ-\nation, (b) at least monthly attendance of religious services, and\n(c) visits to the community center for elderly people (social\ncenter with recreational activities). A composite social in-\ntegration index was constructed with the addition of the three\nindicators (score range 5 0 to 3).\nSocial engagement with children, relatives, and friends was\nassessed via four choice questions (three for type of social tie:\nchildren, relatives, and friends) taken from the MacArthur\nHealthy Aging Study (Seeman et al., 1994). Their wording is as\nfollows: How often do you feel you help your children (family/\nfriends)? How often do you feel useful to your children (family/\nfriends)? How often do you feel that you play an important\nrole in your children's (family's/friends') lives? Factor analysis\nindicated the existence of a single factor referring to the self-\nperceived usefulness to others. The Cronbach's alpha reliability\nfriends. Items were recorded as 22 (never), 21 (sometimes), 1\n(frequently), and 2 (always). Individuals stating that they had no\nfamily or friends were assigned the value of 0 on the\ncorresponding variable. Items were added to produce one score\nfor children, one for family, and one for friends. For descriptive\nanalyses the social engagement score was categorized as low\nanalyses the score was introduced as a continuous variable.\nThe following potential confounders of the association be-\ntween social relations and cognitive decline were included in\nthe analyses: age, education, depressive symptoms, systolic and\ndiastolic blood pressure, and functional limitations. Age and\neducation have previously been found to be associated with\ncognitive decline in our population (Alvarado, Zunzunegui, del\nSer, & Be\n\u00b4land, in press), and several studies have shown that\nsocial relations decrease with age and are more rare for people\nwith lower level of education (Glass et al., 1997; Turner &\nMarino, 1994). Because the level of formal education in this\npopulation is low, subjects were classified according to being\nilliterate (12%), with no formal schooling but able to read and\nwrite (33%), with incomplete primary school (35%), and\nhaving completed primary school (4 years of schooling for this\nage cohort). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were\ndetermined by the average of two measurements following\nthe procedures of the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up\nStudy. Depressive symptomatology was measured using the\nSpanish version of the Center for Epidemiology Studies\nDepression Scale (Moscicki, Locke, & Rae, 1989). Four\nquestions regarding the performance of actions requiring\nmobility and effort were asked to assess functional limitations\nof the upper and lower extremities (Coroni-Huntley et al., 1986;\nNagi, 1976). Subjects received a score ranging from one to\nthree according to their ability to perform all four actions\nwithout difficulty, experiencing some difficulty but able to\nperform the four actions, and unable to perform at least one\naction.\nStatistical Analysis\nA comparison between the baseline population and those\nwho continued in the study after 4 years was carried out to\nassess possible selection bias. Bivariate analyses were\nperformed to examine differences in the distributions among\nthose who completed the follow-up and those who were lost\nto follow-up due to change of residence, refusal, or death.\nDifferences between women and men in each variable were\nalso recorded.\nAnalysis was carried out in four phases: 1. Eleven multiple\nlinear regressions of the continuous cognitive score in 1997 on\nsocial networks, social integration, and social engagement were\ncarried out, one regression for each independent variable.\nLinear regressions were performed, controlling for age (as\ncontinuous variable), baseline 1993 cognitive function, and\nlevel of education.\n2. A sequential hierarchical multiple regression was fitted\naccording to the conceptual framework (Berkman et al., 2000).\nIn a first step, age, education, cognitive function in 1993, and\nsex were entered as antecedent or exogenous variables.\nVariables concerning networks were entered; then we added\nthe integration index and engagement with relatives, friends,\nand children. Correlations between the 11 indicators of social\nLastly, depression, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and\nfunctional limitations were entered as potentially confounding\nvariables because they are risk factors for cognitive decline and\nthey may influence the likelihood of social interactions. Finally,\ngender differences were tested through inclusion of interaction\nterms suggested by the results of the 11 regressions of the\nprevious analysis. All models were adjusted by 1993 baseline\ncognitive function, age, sex, and level of education.\n3. The risk of severe decline in cognitive function was\nestimated by comparing those who had experienced severe\ndecline with those who had not. Again, 11 binary logistic re-\ngressions were fitted controlling for age and level of education,\nseparated for men and women.\n4. An ordinal logistic regression was performed with the\nthree-category measures of decline (``no decline,'' ``mild,'' and\n``severe decline'') as dependent variables to identify clinically\nrelevant predictors of change. The strategy of inclusion of\nvariables in the model was the same explained above: first age,\nsex, and education; second, the network and the integration\nindex; and third, engagement with relatives, children, and\nfriends. Depression, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and\nfunctional limitations were included in the final model as\npotential confounders.\nRESULTS\nFollowed and Lost Cases\nNine hundred sixty-four subjects (83% of the total sample)\nprovided complete data on cognitive function and had good\nvisual function in 1993, and they constitute the base popula-\nCompared with the 1993 study population, those who com-\npleted the follow-up were similar in marital status, social net-\nworks, social integration, and social engagement characteristics\n(Table 1). However, poor social networks, social integration,\nand social engagement were significantly associated with\nmortality. The probability of death was higher for men with\nless visual contacts with relatives (odds ratio [OR] 5 1.05,\nwho participated infrequently in social activities (OR 5 1.49,\nSociodemographic Characteristics\nLiving alone was not frequent (9.8%). Contacts with\nrelatives were more frequent than contacts with friends.\nAlthough 68% of the subjects had contacted three or more\nrelatives in the last month, only 48% reported having friends.\nOnly 8.6% of this sample had not been engaged in any of the\nfour social activities included in the index of social integration.\nHigh engagement with relatives and children was more\nfrequent than high engagement with friends (Table 1). Several\nsignificant differences were found between men and women.\nMen were more likely to be married whereas women were more\nlikely to live alone or with family. Women reported less\nextensive networks than men, that is, fewer social contacts with\nfriends and extended family and fewer social activities over the\npast month. Only attendance of religious services occurred\nmore frequently among women than men. Engagement with\nchildren and relatives occurred as frequently for men as for\nwomen, but women tended to be less engaged with friends.\nThere were more women reporting cardiovascular morbidity\nsignificant gender differences with respect to frequency of\ndecline.\nTable 2 shows the results of the total and gender-specific\nmultiple linear regressions of 1997 cognitive function on each\nvariable of social relations, controlling for age, baseline\ncognition value in 1993, and education. Visual contacts with\nrelatives, participating as a member of a group, attending\nreligious services, attending old age center, and the social\nintegration index were positively related to cognitive score in\n1997 both in men and in women. Having friends and social\nengagement with friends was associated with cognitive\nfunction in women but not in men; this was formally tested\nin the model including all subjects ( p 5 .09; bottom two lines\nof Table 2).\nThe final multiple regression analyses results are shown in\nTable 3. The frequency of visual contacts with relatives and the\nsocial integration index are positively associated with cognitive\nfunction both for men and women, whereas engagement with\nfriends is significantly associated with good cognitive function\nin women and the interaction between engagement with friends\nand sex is significant at p 5 .06. In addition, among men\ndepressive symptoms are significantly associated with poorer\ncognitive function ( p 5 .03).\nTable 4 shows the results of the logistic regressions of severe\ncognitive decline for men and women separately. First, a higher\nsocial integration index and a high frequency of visual family\ncontacts were associated with a low probability of severe\ncognitive decline 4 years later for both genders. Equations for\nboth sexes separately seem to indicate that friends are stronger\nnegative predictors for women and social engagement with\nchildren in men is also a negative predictor of cognitive decline.\nTable 5 shows the results of fitting an ordinal logistic regression\nequation. Here, the dependent variable was cognitive decline\nwith three levels: no decline, mild decline, and severe decline.\nThe number of relatives seen at least monthly and the social\nintegration index are significant predictors of cognitive decline\nfor both sexes. Among women, engagement with friends\npredicts lower probability of cognitive decline. Neither\nengagement with relatives or children was related to decline\nin this final model. Depression is associated with decline in\nmen but not in women.\nTable 1.

Three main results have been obtained in our study.\nFirst, several areas of social relations--social networks, social\nintegration, and social engagement--are associated with\ncognitive decline controlling for age, baseline cognitive\nfunction, education, cardiovascular morbidity, depression, and\nfunctional limitations. Second, formal participation in social\nactivities (church, social center for elderly people, group\nmembership, park) has protective effects against cognitive\ndecline. Third, the influence of social relations on cognitive\nfunction is to some extent different for every gender. Engage-\nment with friends was protective in women but not in men.\nOur findings are in agreement with one previous report\n(Bassuk et al., 1999). That study used a composite index of\nsocial networks and social integration, based on six indicators:\npresence of spouse, visual and nonvisual contacts with friends\nand relatives, attendance at places of worship, membership in\nother groups, and regular participation in social activities. The\nfollow-up period was 12 years (4 measurements). At 3 years,\nthose who had no social ties were at increased risk of cognitive\ndecline after adjusting for age, education, and morbidity\nconditions. Contrary to our results, this study did not find\na distinct effect for each dimension of social networks or in the\nsocial integration measurements. Moreover, the effect of social\nnetworks on cognitive decline was not evaluated separately for\nmen and women; therefore, we are not able to compare our\ngender-specific results with them.\nOther observations in noninstitutionalized elderly cohorts\nhave demonstrated associations between social networks, social\nintegration, and incidence of dementia. Using a community-\nbased cohort, Fratiglioni and colleagues (2000) showed that\nthose living alone or without any close social ties were 1.5\ntimes more likely to develop dementia after 3 years of follow-\nup. In the Honolulu Asia Aging Study, Balfour and colleagues\n(2001) reported that a higher rate of social engagement and\nparticipation in productive activities (helping others, paid work,\nvolunteer work) might reduce the risk of dementia among older\nadults. In contrast, the PAQUID Study (Fabrigoule et al., 1995)\nshowed that active participation in leisure activities (gardening,\ntravelling, and knitting) predicted lower risk of dementia,\nwhereas group memberships and participation in social\nactivities were not related to the incidence of dementia after 3\nyears of follow-up, when baseline cognitive performance was\ncontrolled. The authors argued that leisure activities demand\nmore attention and control than social ties and social\nparticipation and have more powerful effect on delaying\ndementia. However, the structural and role-specific models of\nsocial networks were not clearly defined in their study. A recent\nstudy of the MacArthur Successful Aging population older than\nyears of follow-up in those having a high frequency of\nemotional support. Neither the number of social ties (children,\nfriend, and relatives) nor group participation predicted\ncognitive decline in this population. Gender interactions with\nsocial relations variables were not significant, therefore,\nanalysis was presented for both sexes together.\nTable 2.

First, there has been a marked separation\nof social roles by gender in Spanish society (as in virtually\nevery society), with specific values and cultural norms about\nsocial behavior and networks. Women's social role in Spain in\nthis older age cohort has been rather restricted to domestic life,\nwhereas men's role is centered on kinship. Some studies have\ndemonstrated gender-specific associations between social\nrelations and health for men and women (Berkman & Syme,\nBruce, Berkman, & Seeman, 1999). Our results indicate that\nsocial networks, social integration, and social engagement\noperate in similar ways in both sexes, although the nature of the\nrelations that matter vary by gender. For women, friends appear\nto play a more significant role. Our data suggest that social\nrelations outside of the family circle are not frequent among\nwomen living with their spouse or with others; however,\nwomen living alone have more frequent social participation,\ncontacts, and active engagement with friends and relatives.\nConversely, among men, social contacts, integration, and\nengagement are not associated with living arrangements (data\nnot shown). It may be that social engagement outside of the\nhome environment is stimulating for women, whereas an active\nrole as head of the household within one's own family and as\nmember of the community is stimulating for men. Because our\nresults on these gender-specific effects are not conclusive,\nfurther longitudinal research should explore these hypotheses.\nThere are several possible explanations of our findings about\nthe impact of social networks on cognitive decline in elderly\npeople. All of them are compatible with the data that we, and\nother previous authors, have obtained, and only more refined\nfuture research may determine the mechanisms underlying\nsocial impact on cognition. Cognitive reserve hypothesis, often\nused to explain the influence of variables such as education\nand occupation, on the risk of cognitive decline and dementia\n(Coffey, Saxton, Ratcliff, Bryan, & Lucke, 1999; Katzman,\nSchofield, Mosesson, Stern, & Mayeux, 1995) may also\naccount for our study's findings. Good social relations with\nfriends and relatives, throughout the life course and especially\nin the late life, might produce continued mental stimulation and\nbetter cognitive strategies or increase neural growth and\nsynaptic density--the ``use-it-or-lose-it'' hypothesis--delaying\ncognitive impairment or protecting against pathological pro-\ncesses. An alternative formulation of cognitive reserve\nhypothesis should be also considered. People who have a better\nneural structure, more resistant to late damage and cognitive\ndecline, may be also more able to acquire and maintain social\nabilities and contacts, and the association between social\nnetworks and cognition in the old age could be not causal but\na surrogate.\nAlternatively, social networks could act on cognitive\nfunction through psychosocial pathways: the individual with\nmore frequent contacts and integration has more opportunities\nfor engagement with others (Berkman et al., 2000). Our study\nsuggests that the effect of social networks on cognitive function\nmay be partially explained by the social engagement index.\nWomen with friends showed a better cognitive function in\n1997, and the association increased when social engagement\nwith friends replaced the dichotomous variable ``has/does not\nhave friends'' in the equation. Social engagement may protect\nTable 4.

Women with a\npositive perception of their helpfulness and usefulness, and\nwho felt they played an important role with friends, showed\nless cognitive decline. Among men social engagement with\nchildren showed a protective effect but this association lost\nsignificance in the final multivariate equation. In fact, social\nengagement could also provide opportunities for mobilization\nof cognitive functions and operate as an antidote to minor stress\nmechanisms related to stress theory could also partially explain\nour results. Stress may favor neurodegenerative processes,\nespecially in the hippocampus, which plays a crucial role in the\nmemory process (McEwen, 1998; O'Brien, Ames, & Schweit-\nzer, 1993). Furthermore, the hippocampus regulates the stress\nresponse and acts to inhibit the response of the HPA axis to\nstress. Frequent social contacts and high rates of social\nintegration and social engagement could dampen or moderate\nthe effect of stress on the activation of the hypothalamic-\npituitary adrenal axis of the central nervous system; therefore,\nsocial relations may reduce brain damage and the effects of\nSome authors have stated that associations of social networks\nand social integration with cognitive function could be\nartifactual. Firstly, low rates of participation in social activities\nand lower frequency of visual contacts could be a prodromal\nfeature of or a reaction to incipient dementia, rather than a risk\nfactor for cognitive decline. Secondly, measures of social\ncontacts and participation, which require a minimum level of\nfunctional and cognitive capacity, could be confounded by\nfunctional limitations. Thirdly, measures that rely on self-\nreports of perceived engagement could be confounded by\nmental decline (Glass et al., 1997). However, we excluded\ncases with very low cognitive scores at baseline. Furthermore,\nwe found that participants with low cognitive scores at baseline\ntended to either die or move out of the study area (Alvarado\net al., in press). Only 15 people completed the follow-up,\nscoring less than 18 points on the cognitive test at baseline, and\nour results did not change when we repeated the analysis\nexcluding those subjects. We showed that the association of\nsocial contacts and the index of integration with cognitive\ndecline remained after adjustment for functional limitations.\nDepressive symptoms were associated with severe decline only\namong men but they did not confound the association between\nsocial relationships and cognitive function because the\ncoefficients of the social variables remained unchanged.\nThis study has both methodological strengths and limita-\ntions. Its strengths include the following. The study was based\non a prospective design with social variables measured at\nbaseline and cognitive change and decline measured after 4\nyears of follow-up. Social relations measurements were based\non a theoretical model that proved to be valid for elderly\nindividuals (Berkman et al., 2000), capturing three dimensions\nof network structure (frequency of contacts, integration, and\nengagement) and the role-specificity of each of them. Previous\nresearch indicates that these three dimensions, as well as the\ntype of social relation, have a differential impact on health\noutcomes (Seeman, Kaplan, Knudsen, Cohen, & Guralnik,\nstudy shows similar effects on cognitive function in elderly\nindividuals. Cognitive function was assessed using an in-\nstrument, validated for a population with low levels of edu-\ncation, that has proven construct validity (Zunzunegui\net al., 2000). Finally we used two dependent variables:\na cross-sectional cognitive score as a continuous variable and\na categorical description of cognitive decline over 4 years. Our\nanalysis, using both multiple linear and logistic regressions, has\nproduced consistent results.\nWe will now discuss some limitations. Firstly, the attrition of\nour baseline sample due to mortality and change of residence\nwas rather high, that is, 24%. However, there were no\nsignificant differences between those who refused to continue\nin the study and those who completed the exams, whereas those\nwho died or moved out of the area during the follow-up period\nhad lower cognitive performance at baseline, according to\nexpectations. In addition, mortality was higher among those\nwith infrequent social contacts and a low rate of social\nengagement, especially in women--variables that were related\nto cognitive decline in our study. As attrition was higher in\nthose with the worst baseline performance, reported associa-\ntions of cognitive decline with social relations may be\nunderestimated in this study. Secondly, the small sample size\nof our study limits the ability to explore interactions in the\nmultivariate models and obtain more precise estimates of the\nmagnitude of the effects. Thirdly, with our 4-year follow-up,\nwe cannot determine whether the observed effect of social\nrelations on cognitive function is the result of a lifelong\ncumulative exposure or the result of an abrupt change from\na previous extensive network to a more limited one. Previous\nstudies examining the effect of social networks on mortality\nhave reported that the availability of a good social network is\na better predictor of survival than the changes in such a network.\nOther authors agree with the fact that social networks are stable\nIn conclusion, we have provided evidence that social in-\ntegration, frequent contact with family and friends, and playing\nan important role with significant others have beneficial effects\nin maintaining cognitive function in later life.\n"
