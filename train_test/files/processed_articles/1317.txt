Uric acid; Gout; Beer; Liquor; Wine; Alcohol, NHANES III.\nINTRODUCTION\nHyperuricemia is considered the precursor of gout, which\nis the most common inflammatory arthritis in adult men\n(1). Many studies have shown that increased alcohol in-\ntake is associated with hyperuricemia (2\u00ad10), but little\ndata are available about the effect of individual alcoholic\nbeverages (i.e., beer, liquor, and wine) on serum uric acid\nlevels. If different alcoholic beverages have different ef-\nfects on serum uric acid (11), it would have practical\nimplications for prevention and management of hyperuri-\ncemia and gout.\nIn a recent large prospective study of incident gout\namong men, we found higher beer and liquor intake inde-\npendently increased the risk of incident gout, whereas\nhigher wine intake did not (12). These findings led us to\nhypothesize that these beverages differentially affect se-\nrum uric acid levels. To evaluate this hypothesis, we con-\nducted a cross-sectional study based on the US Third\nNational Health and Nutritional Examination Survey\nMETHODS\nthe NHANES III included a representative sample of the\nnoninstitutionalized civilian US population, which was\nselected by using a multistage, stratified sampling design\n(13). After a home interview, participants were invited to\nattend examination sessions where blood and urine spec-\nimens were obtained. For participants unable to attend the\nexamination for health reasons, a blood sample was ob-\ntained during the home interview. We limited our analysis\nto participants 20 years old who attended the medical\n1Hyon K.

During the home\ninterview, beer, liquor, and wine intake were determined\nfrom responses to the food frequency questionnaire ad-\nministered to participants to assess their usual consump-\ntion over the past month. Food frequency questionnaire\nassessment of alcohol intake has been shown to be a valid\nand reliable method for assessing average consumption\n(15). The average daily intakes of each alcoholic beverage\nwere then combined to compute total alcohol intake.\nAssessment of covariates. The average daily intakes of\ntotal meat, seafood, and dairy foods were derived from\nresponses to the food frequency questionnaire. Food fre-\nquency questionnaire assessment of dietary intake has\nbeen shown to be a valid and reliable method for assessing\naverage dietary consumption (16,17). Total energy intake\nwas calculated from a single 24-hour dietary recall. The\nNHANES III collected information on body measurements\n(including height and weight), medication use (including\ndiuretics, antihypertensives, allopurinol, and uricosuric\nagents), medical conditions (including self reported hyper-\ntension and gout), and serum creatinine levels. Body mass\nindex (BMI) was calculated by dividing the weight in\nkilograms by the square of the height in meters.\nStatistical analysis. All statistical analyses were com-\nputed using survey commands of Stata (e.g., SVYMEAN\nand SVYREG) to incorporate sample weights and to adjust\nfor clusters and strata of the complex sample design (Ver-\nsion 7; Stata Corporation, College Station, TX).\nWe used linear regression modeling to evaluate the re-\nlationship between alcohol intake and serum uric acid\nlevel. The average daily serving for each alcoholic bever-\ntreating alcohol intake as continuous variables. Multivar-\niate models were adjusted for age; sex; total energy intake;\nBMI; use of diuretics, beta-blockers, allopurinol, and uri-\ncosuric agents; self-reported hypertension and gout; serum\ncreatinine level; and intake of total meats, seafood, and\ndairy foods. Multivariate models for individual alcoholic\nbeverages were additionally adjusted for the other 2 indi-\nvidual alcoholic beverages. Trends in serum uric acid lev-\nels across categories of intake were assessed in linear re-\ngression models by using the median values of each\ncategory to minimize the influence of outliers. We con-\nducted analyses stratified by sex or BMI (25 kg/m2 versus\n25 kg/m2). We evaluated potential interactions with\nthese variables by testing the significance of interaction\nterms added to our final multivariate models with the\nmain effects. For all  coefficients, we calculated 95%\nconfidence intervals (95% CIs). All P values are 2 sided.\nRESULTS\nCharacteristics.

Furthermore, the association with\nbeer was larger than that with liquor. These associations\nwere independent of the other alcoholic beverages and of\nadditional risk factors for hyperuricemia, such as sex, BMI,\ndietary risk factors, serum creatinine level, hypertension,\nand diuretic use. These findings persisted across different\nsubgroups stratified by sex and BMI.\nEthanol intake has been shown to increase serum uric\nacid level via both decreased urate excretion (4,18\u00ad20) and\nincreased production (5,6). Meanwhile, our findings sug-\ngest that certain nonalcoholic components that vary across\nthese alcoholic beverages play an important role in serum\nuric acid level. One candidate for this nonalcoholic com-\nponent is the variation in purine contents among the in-\ndividual alcoholic beverages (21). Beer is the only alco-\nholic beverage acknowledged to have a large purine\ncontent, which is predominantly guanosine (21). Guano-\nsine is more readily absorbed than other nucleosides, nu-\ncleotides, or bases (11,21). Thus, the effect of ingested\npurine in beer on the blood uric acid may be sufficient to\naugment the hyperuricemic effect of alcohol itself (11,21).\nThere may be other nonalcoholic offending factors, partic-\nularly in beer. Wine is known to contain a number of\nFigure 1. Multivariate difference in serum uric acid per daily serving of alcoholic beverages stratified by sex and body mass index (BMI).\nThe differences are adjusted for age; sex; total energy intake; BMI; use of diuretics, beta-blockers, allopurinol, and uricosuric agents; self\nreport of hypertension and gout; serum creatinine level; and intake of total meats, seafood, and dairy foods. Error bars indicate 95%\nconfidence intervals of the difference. Thus, if the bars cross the X-axis (unity), the respective difference is not significant (P  0.05).\nSignificant interactions were present for liquor intake between sexes (P for interaction  0.03) and for intake of beer or total alcohol\nbetween the BMI subgroups (P values for interaction  0.03 and 0.01, respectively). All other P values for interaction were  0.19.\nnonalcoholic components, including antioxidants (22\u00ad24),\nvasorelaxants (25), and stimulants to antiaggregatory\nmechanisms (26). Because uric acid is considered an indi-\ncator for increased oxidative stress, nonalcoholic compo-\nnents in wine (e.g., polyphenols with antioxidant proper-\nties) (22\u00ad24) may potentially play a role in mitigating the\nimpact of alcohol on serum uric acid levels. Nonetheless,\nour results provide novel relevant information that mod-\nerate wine drinking may not increase serum uric acid\nlevels.\nThese findings closely agree with the results of our re-\ncent prospective study of incident gout based on a large\nmale cohort (12). In that study, we found that higher beer\nand liquor intake independently increased the risk of in-\ncident gout, whereas higher wine intake did not (12). We\nalso found that beer increased the risk of gout more than\ntwice that observed for liquor, even though alcohol con-\ntent per serving was less for beer than liquor. The current\nstudy findings indicate that these beverages may affect\nserum uric acid levels differentially, thus causing the vari-\nation in the risk of incident gout. The fact that these\nstudies were based on different study populations (the\ncurrent one being nationally representative sample with\nboth sexes) supports the robustness of the argument.\nWe found that the increase in serum uric acid level\nassociated with beer or liquor intake tended to be larger\namong women than men and also among those who were\nnot overweight than those who were. Confirmation of\nthese findings by future studies would bring more refined\nand comprehensive dietary recommendations for hyper-\nuricemia or gout given the emerging role of moderate al-\ncohol intake in preventing coronary heart disease (27).\nStrengths and limitations of our study deserve comment.\nThis study was performed in a nationally representative\nsample of US women and men; thus, the findings are likely\nto be generalizable to all US men and women. Although\nthe exposure range of alcohol intake in this study should\ndescribe that of US adults, our analyses may not have\neffectively addressed the association with alcohol intake\nbeyond moderate intake. Although we have no reason to\nsuspect that the associations observed in this study would\nlessen in higher intake ranges of beer or liquor, we cannot\nrule out the possibility that wine drinking may still have\nan effect on uric acid at a higher consumption level (i.e.,\nsubstantially higher than 1 glass per day). A cross-sec-\ntional study design tends to leave uncertainty regarding\nthe temporal sequence of exposure\u00adoutcome relationships\nand is also vulnerable to recall bias as opposed to prospec-\ntive studies. If some participants reduced their alcohol\nintake based on previously measured hyperuricemia, it\nwould lead to an underestimation of the association be-\ntween alcohol intake and serum uric acid level, making\nour findings conservative. In the NHANES III, the health\nexamination component including serum uric acid mea-\nsurement (outcome) was performed after the household\ninterview that inquired about alcohol intake during the\npast month (exposure). Thus, it appears implausible that\nserum uric acid levels measured in this study somehow\nwould systematically influence the reporting intake of\nthese beverages. Furthermore, differential effects among\nthe individual alcoholic beverages would not be explained\nby these potential methodologic limitations. Our main\nanalysis included those with self-reported gout and those\nwho were taking medications to treat hyperuricemia.\nThus, if these participants reduced intake of alcohol based\non their gout diagnosis or hyperuricemia requiring treat-\nment, it would theoretically lead to an underestimation of\nthe association between alcohol intake and serum uric\nacid level. However, exclusion of these participants did\nnot materially affect our results. This is likely due to the\nlow proportion of participants with these characteristics\n(3%) or potentially due to insubstantial change in alcohol\nintake after their diagnosis of gout or hyperuricemia re-\nquiring treatment.\nIn conclusion, our results suggest that the effect of indi-\nvidual alcoholic beverages on serum uric acid levels varies\nsubstantially: beer confers a larger increase than liquor,\nwhereas moderate wine drinking does not increase serum\nuric acid levels.\nREFERENCES\n1.
