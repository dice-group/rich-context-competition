However, very little research has investi-\ngated this association in a bereaved sample. It is imperative to\nextend this line of research to include bereaved samples\nbecause (a) bereavement can negatively impact health\n(Stroebe et al., 2007), (b) personality influences how indi-\nviduals cope with stressors (Carver and Connor-Smith, 2010),\n(c) personality influences how individuals recall and describe\ntheir bereavement experiences (Baddeley and Singer, 2008),\nand (d) personality influences who seeks out social support\nwhen experiencing stressors (Connor-Smith and Flachsbart,\n2007). Although some research suggests that social support\nmay be a buffer against the negative outcomes associated\nwith bereavement, other studies have not found support for\nis possible that these studies have failed to take into account\nnegative social exchanges, which are aversive exchanges\nindividuals receive from members of their social network\n(Brooks and Dunkel Schetter, 2011), that have been shown to\nnegatively influence physical health (Hill et al., 2014;\nNewsom et al., 2005). Thus, this study focused on whether\nthe association between personality and physical health\namong non-bereaved samples could be replicated within a\nbereaved sample and whether negative social exchanges\nmight be associated with self-reported health in the sample.\nBereavement and health\nBereaved individuals have an increased risk of morbidity and\nespecially within the first few months after the death of a loved\none (Roelfs et al., 2012). These increased risks are the result of\nbereaved individuals' grief, which is the reaction to the death\nof a loved one. These reactions can include psychological and\nphysiological components, which may increase vulnerability\nto premature death through increased susceptibility to disease\nResearch has found that bereaved individuals perceive\ntheir health to be poorer than their same-aged non-bereaved\ncounterparts (Stroebe et al., 2007). They report somatic\ncomplaints more frequently, exhibit increased use of\nPersonality, negative social\nexchanges, and physical health\namong bereaved adults\nNicole M Silva1, James A Henrie2 and Julie Hicks Patrick1\n Keywords\nbereavement, negative social exchanges, personality, physical health\n1West Virginia University, USA\n2University of Wisconsin--Parkside, USA\nCorresponding author:\nJulie Hicks Patrick, West Virginia University, 53 Campus Drive,\nEmail: julie.patrick@mail.wvu.edu\nReport of empirical study\n2 Health Psychology Open \nmedical services, experience disability at higher rates,\nbegin new and increase current medication use, and are\nhospitalized more often than their non-bereaved counter-\nparts. They are also 1.4 times more likely to report a new or\nworsened illness affecting the endocrine, immune, cardio-\nvascular, gastrointestinal, or musculoskeletal systems\nWhile much of the above research has emphasized the\nnegative outcomes associated with bereavement, it is\nimportant to note that research has found great variability\n2011). Although bereavement can have a strong negative\nimpact on individuals, there are many individuals who\nendure this potentially stressful experience quite well,\nshowing little or no response. Given this variability,\nresearch has focused on identifying resources or factors\nthat might differentiate between those individuals who\nadjust well after the death of a loved one and those who do\nnot. One potentially fruitful area is the association between\npersonality and bereavement.\nPersonality, grief, and coping styles\nPersonality is the enduring thoughts, feelings, and emo-\ntions that are specific to the individual. Personality can be\ndefined in many ways; however, the most prominent trait\ntheory in personality is the five-factor model (Lodi-Smith\net al., 2011), which organizes personality into five super-\nfactor models: neuroticism, conscientiousness, extraver-\nsion, agreeableness, and openness to experience. Research\nindicates that personality influences the intensity of grief\nindividuals' experience. Specifically, bereaved mothers\nwho were higher in neuroticism reported higher levels of\ngrief intensity (i.e. higher levels of emotional and physical\ndistress; Robinson and Marwit, 2006). Furthermore,\nbereaved parents who were higher in neuroticism reported\nhigher levels of grief (Wijngaards-de Meij et al., 2007).\nPersonality also influences the types of coping styles\nindividuals engage in when experiencing a stressor.\nIndividuals who are higher in neuroticism report engaging\nin not only less task-oriented coping (i.e. attempting to\nchange the stressful situation) but also more avoidance-\noriented coping (i.e. seeking out distractions) and problem-\natic emotion-oriented coping (i.e. minimizing the distress\nby expressing negative emotions; Connor-Smith and\nwho are higher in extraversion report engaging in more\ntask-oriented coping and avoidance-oriented coping, while\nthey also report engaging in less emotion-oriented coping\n(Connor-Smith and Flachsbart, 2007; Robinson and\nMarwit, 2006). Individuals who are higher in conscien-\ntiousness report engaging in more task-oriented coping\n(Connor-Smith and Flachsbart, 2007). Research indicates\nthat personality has a stronger influence on coping styles as\nthe stressor becomes more acute (Connor-Smith and\nFlachsbart, 2007). Thus, personality plays an influential\nrole when it comes to how individuals cope with stressors,\nespecially a stressor such as the death of a loved one.\nPersonality and health\nIn addition to coping styles, personality influences physical\nhealth. There are many theoretical models that describe the\nmechanisms that account for the association between per-\nsonality and health (Smith, 2006). One influential theoreti-\ncal model is the health behavior model, which states that\nindividuals who endorse higher levels of specific personal-\nity traits do or do not engage in specific health-promoting\nor health-risk behaviors, which can lead to illness. The fol-\nlowing paragraphs attempt to condense this abundant litera-\nture (see Friedman and Kern, 2014; Hampson and Friedman,\npersonality and health).\nStudies that have examined conscientiousness effects on\nhealth have found consistent results in which higher levels\nof conscientiousness are beneficial to health (Kern and\nFriedman, 2011). Specifically, individuals who are higher\nin conscientiousness engage in fewer health-risk behaviors\n(e.g. alcohol use, tobacco use, other substance use, and\nrisky driving) while they engage in more health-promoting\nbehaviors (e.g. physical activity, healthy eating, and well-\nness maintenance such as visiting a doctor) relative to those\nlower in conscientiousness (Atherton et al., 2014; Bogg and\nals who are higher in conscientiousness have fewer physi-\ncal limitations (Goodwin and Friedman, 2006).\nNeuroticism exhibits a strong negative association with\nphysical health (Taga et al., 2009). Individuals who are\nhigher in neuroticism engage in health-risk behaviors, such\nas alcohol or tobacco use. These individuals also engage in\nfewer health-promoting behaviors compared to those lower\nThus, individuals who are higher in neuroticism experience\nmore physical limitations, report more medical problems,\nand report poorer general health (Atherton et al., 2014;\nResearch has found a positive association between agree-\nableness and self-reported physical health (Atherton et al.,\nhigher in agreeableness report better general health, better\nphysical functioning, and fewer medical problems relative to\nthose lower in agreeableness (Atherton et al., 2014; Jerram\nand Coleman, 1999). Gender has been found to moderate the\nassociation between agreeableness and self-reported physi-\ncal health: agreeableness may be a stronger predictor of\nphysical health for males, while neuroticism may be a\nstronger predictor for females (Friedman et al., 2010).\nExtraversion has shown mixed results in the literature.\nIndividuals who are higher in extraversion engage in more\nhealth-promoting behaviors relative to those who are lower in\nSilva et al. 3\nextraversion (Atherton et al., 2014; Jerram and Coleman,\n1999). They also report better physical functioning and general\nhealth. However, individuals who are higher in extraversion are\nmore likely to engage in substance use (Atherton et al., 2014).\nOpenness to experience has been the least studied trait\nwith regard to health (Taga et al., 2009), and when included\nin research, results are mixed (Eldesousky, 2013; Goodwin\nand Friedman, 2006). Higher levels of openness to experi-\nence have been associated with better self-reported physi-\ncal functioning and perceived general health (Jerram and\nColeman, 1999). However, when paired with higher levels\nof neuroticism and lower levels of conscientiousness,\nhigher levels of openness to experience have been associ-\nated with tobacco and illegal drug use (Turiano et al., 2012).\nPersonality, bereavement, and social support\nIn addition to health, personality influences how bereaved\nindividuals describe their experiences with bereavement.\nWhile examining bereavement narratives, Baddeley and\nSinger (2008) found that bereaved individuals who were\nhigher in conscientiousness told shorter stories and made\nmore references to death relative to individuals who were\nlower in conscientiousness. Bereaved individuals who were\nhigher in neuroticism were more likely to reference them-\nselves in their stories. Thus, personality influences how\nbereaved individuals recall and share their experiences, which\nmay influence the frequency and amount of social support\nbereaved individuals receive. In fact, research has suggested\nthat individuals who were higher in extraversion were more\nlikely to share their bereavement narratives to get closer to\nsomeone or to gain comfort or support from others (Baddeley\nWith regard to social support, there is a long-held\nassumption that it is an important tool in overcoming grief;\nhowever, there is limited empirical support for this assump-\ntion. While some research suggests that social support buff-\ners against depressed moods and maintain positive moods\namong bereaved individuals (e.g. Lund et al., 2010; Van der\nHouwen et al., 2010), other studies have found limited evi-\ndence for this. Krause (1986) found that social support was\nassociated with a decrease in somatic symptoms but it was\nnot associated with sadness or loneliness. Other studies\nalso have found little or no evidence for this position among\na variety of samples (e.g. Murphy, 1988; Murphy et al.,\nfailed to account for the dark side of social support, specifi-\ncally, negative social exchanges.\nNegative social exchanges, health, and\npersonality\nResearch indicates that relationships and exchanges among\nmembers of the social network are not uniformly positive\nmay not help when called upon or may engage in behaviors\nthat they perceive to be helpful, but are not. These\nexchanges, which are termed negative social exchanges,\nhave been shown to be conceptually and empirically dis-\ntinct from social support or positive social exchanges\n(Okun and Keith, 1998). They consist of the undesirable\nand aversive exchanges individuals receive from members\nof their social network and include neglect, interference,\nrejection, conflict, insensitivity, and unwanted advice\nResearch indicates that negative social exchanges nega-\ntively influence health. Strain from the social network (i.e.\nnegative social exchanges from partner, family, or friends)\nhas been associated with health problems (Walen and\nLachman, 2000), while it also accounted for the greatest\namount of variance in physical symptoms when compared\nto daily hassles, social support, and life events (Edwards\net al., 2001). Recent analyses from the Health and\nRetirement Study demonstrate that negative social\nexchanges from friends and family are particularly power-\nful predictors of the onset of new chronic health conditions\n(Hill et al., 2014). The association between negative social\nexchanges and physical health is also evident in longitudi-\nnal studies. Newsom et al. (2008) examined participants'\nself-rated health, functional limitations, health conditions,\nand frequency of negative social exchanges experienced\nover the course of 2years. Results indicated that increases\nin negative social exchanges were associated with poorer\nself-rated health after controlling for baseline self-rated\nhealth, race, gender, age, education, and income. Also,\nincreases in negative social exchanges were associated with\nmore health conditions after controlling for baseline health\nconditions, race, gender, age, education, and income. Thus,\nnegative social exchanges influence physical health above\nand beyond influential variables.\nResearch suggests that individual characteristics influ-\nence the frequency with which individuals experience neg-\native social exchanges. Research indicates that females are\nmore likely to report and experience negative social\nexchanges due to the social roles they endorse (e.g. being\nmore relationship-oriented) compared to men (Beals and\ngests that negative social exchanges should decrease with\nage. According to the socioemotional selectivity theory,\nolder adults prune negative social network members from\ntheir networks (Carstensen, 1992), thus reducing the fre-\nquency they experience negative social exchanges.\nIt is important to understand whether other individual\ncharacteristics, such as personality, influence the frequency\nwith which individuals experience negative social\nexchanges. Research conducted by Caspi et al. (1987) indi-\ncates that individuals' behavior predisposes them to envi-\nronments that reinforces the behaviors (i.e. cumulative\ncontinuity) and that these behaviors also elicit responses\n4 Health Psychology Open \nfrom the social network members, in which further elicits\nbehaviors from the individuals (i.e. interactional continu-\nity). As such, it is possible that individuals who are higher\nor lower on certain personality traits are more likely to\nelicit negative social exchanges from their social network\nin comparison with individuals who are not higher or lower\non those traits. It is also possible that individuals place\nthemselves in environments that strengthen their personal-\nity characteristics, which increases or decreases the nega-\ntive social exchanges they receive.\nHowever, the association between personality and nega-\ntive social exchanges has not been examined in detail.\nResults from a limited number of studies indicate that indi-\nviduals who are higher in neuroticism or extraversion expe-\nrience more interpersonal conflicts with friends and spouses\n(Asendorpf and Wilpers, 1998; Bolger and Zuckerman,\n2008). Furthermore, individuals who are higher in neuroti-\ncism are more likely to respond to those conflicts with\nanger (Bolger and Zuckerman, 1995). In comparison, indi-\nviduals who are higher in conscientiousness, agreeable-\nness, or emotional stability (i.e. lower in neuroticism)\nreport experiencing lower levels of conflict with their par-\nents and friends (Neyer and Lehnart, 2007; Parker et al.,\nindividuals who are higher in openness experience a reduc-\ntion in conflict (McCrae and Sutin, 2009). Thus, it is\nimportant to examine whether personality is associated\nwith negative social exchanges in a bereaved sample as\nthese individuals may be in great need of and be in frequent\ncontact with their social networks.\nThe current study\nDue to the unique circumstances surrounding bereavement\nas discussed previously (e.g. bereavement negatively\nimpacting health), this study was conducted to examine\nwhether the association between personality and physical\nhealth could be replicated within a bereaved sample.\nFurthermore, this study was conducted to examine whether\npersonality influences the frequency with which bereaved\nindividuals report experiencing negative social exchanges\nand whether these exchanges influence self-reported physi-\ncal health in a sample of 783 bereaved adults.\nHypotheses\nWithin a structural equation model (see Figure 1), this\nstudy examined the (a) association between personality\nand self-reported physical health; (b) association\nbetween personality and negative social exchanges; (c)\nassociation between negative social exchanges and self-\nreported physical health; (d) associations among length\nof bereavement, age, and gender with negative social\nFigure 1. Tested structural equation model.\nSilva et al. 5\nexchanges; (e) associations among length of bereave-\nment, age, and gender with self-reported physical health.\nBased on the previous literature, it was hypothesized\nthat (a) neuroticism, age, and negative social exchanges\nwould be negatively associated with self-reported physical\nhealth; (b) conscientiousness, agreeableness, and length of\nbereavement would be positively associated with self-\nreported physical health; (c) neuroticism, extraversion, and\nbeing female would be positively associated with negative\nsocial exchanges; and (d) conscientiousness, agreeable-\nness, and age would be negatively associated with negative\nsocial exchanges.\nMethod\nParticipants\nParticipants were recruited using Amazon Mechanical\nTurk, an online survey tool. Research has shown that\nrecruiting participants from Amazon Mechanical Turk is\nsimilar to other online and convenience sampling methods\n(Paolacci et al., 2010). Participants received US$2 for com-\npleting the questionnaire, which was approved by the\nInstitutional Review Board. In order to detect response sets\nand other survey-taking concerns, participants were\nrequired to correctly answer three out of four validity check\nquestions. These checks consisted of directions such as\n\"For this question, please answer some or little of the time,\"\nwhich were placed throughout the questionnaire.\nParticipants who did not answer the majority of the validity\nchecks correctly were excluded from the analyses.\nInitially, 980 participants completed the survey. In all,\n56 participants were excluded as a result of failing the\nvalidity check questions, 1 was excluded as a result of\nresponse setting, 42 were excluded due to never having\nexperienced bereavement, while 86 participants were\nremoved due to excessive (30+%) missing data. An addi-\ntional 12 participants were excluded due to being multivari-\nate outliers.\nThus, our final sample included 783 participants between\n=\n(SD)\n=\nwere female. Most of the participants self-identified as\npercent were African\nAmerican or Black, 6.4\npercent were Asian\u00adPacific\npercent were Hispanic, 2.4\npercent reported\nother racial affiliations, and 0.4\npercent did not specify a\nrace. Additional sample characteristics are given in Table 1.\nParticipants reported experiencing the death of grandpar-\nchildren (0.5%), and nieces or nephews (0.5%), while\npercent of the sample did not indicate their relation-\nship to the deceased person. Additional bereavement char-\nacteristics are given in Table 2.\nMeasures\nDemographics.Participants indicated their age, gender,\nhighest level of education, ethnicity, marital status,\nTable 1.

These adjectives correspond to the person-\nality traits of agency (five items, =.76), neuroticism (four\nitems, =.77), extraversion (five items, =.81), openness\nto experience (seven items, =.81), conscientiousness\n(four items, =.74), and agreeableness (five items, =.86).\nBecause we were interested in the five-factor model, agency\nwas not included in the analyses. Responses to the adjec-\ntives could range from 1 (a lot) to 4 (not at all). Personality\ntraits were scored by reverse coding responses when appli-\ncable and averaging the responses in which a higher score\nreflects greater endorsement of the personality trait.\nPhysical health.Subscales of the Short Form 12 (SF-12;\nWare et al., 1996) were used to index self-reported physical\nhealth. The two-item physical role functioning scale\n(=.77), the one-item bodily pain scale, and the two-item\nphysical functioning subscale (=.71) were included in the\nanalyses.\nNegative social exchanges. Participants indicated how often\nthey experienced four different types of negative social\nexchanges in the past year. Responses could range from 1\n(never) to 5 (very often) and included receiving unwanted\nadvice (i.e. informational negative social exchange), being\nlet down when help was needed (i.e. instrumental negative\nsocial exchange), being forgotten or ignored (i.e. compan-\nionship negative social exchange), and experiencing criti-\ncism about personal concerns (i.e. emotional negative\nsocial exchange).\nAnalytic strategy\nIn order to test the associations shown in Figure 1, our\npreliminary strategy included examining the patterns of\ncorrelations (see Table 3). Next, we used AMOS to simul-\ntaneously test the measurement and structural models. For\nthe measurement model, two latent variables were cre-\nated, which were labeled negative social exchanges and\nself-reported physical health. Four indicators (i.e. infor-\nmational, instrumental, companionship, and emotional\nnegative social exchanges) were used for the latent varia-\nble of negative social exchanges while three indicators\n(i.e. physical role functioning, bodily pain, and physical\nfunctioning) were used for the latent variable of self-\nreported physical health. Once the structural equation\nmodel was analyzed, multigroup analyses were conducted\nto test whether the associations among the variables\ndiffered for males and females and whether it differed for\nindividuals who were recently bereaved (i.e. experienced\nbereavement less than 2\nyears) and those who were not\nrecently bereaved (i.e. experienced bereavement more\nyears) due to differential effects of gender and\nlength of bereavement in previous literature (e.g. Friedman\nResults\nThe measurement model and structural equation model\nshown in Figure 1 were tested simultaneously using full\ninformation maximum likelihood estimation. Results indi-\nComparative Fit Index (CFI)=.951, root mean square error\nof approximation (RMSEA)\n=\nder, and length of bereavement accounted for 15.7percent\nof the variance in negative social exchanges, while person-\nality, age, gender, length of bereavement, and negative\nsocial exchanges accounted for 22.9percent of the variance\nin self-reported physical health (see Figure 2 and Table 4).\nResults indicated that individuals who were female\n(\n=\n.15), those higher in openness to experience\n(\n=\n.09), and those higher in neuroticism (=.29)\nreported more negative social exchanges, while indi-\nviduals who were older (\n=\n-.07) and those higher in\nconscientiousness (\n=\n-.12) reported fewer negative\nsocial exchanges. Agreeableness, extraversion, and\nlength of bereavement were not significantly associated\nwith negative social exchanges.\nResults also indicated that individuals who were older\n(\n=\n-.31), those higher in agreeableness (=-.12), and\nthose higher in neuroticism (=-.15) reported poorer\nphysical health, while individuals who were higher in\nconscientiousness (=.11) reported better physical health.\nFurthermore, individuals who reported more negative\nsocial exchanges (\n=\n-.23) reported poorer physical\nhealth. Openness to experience, extraversion, length of\nbereavement, and gender were not associated with self-\nreported physical health. Indirect effects were examined,\nand results indicated that negative social exchanges did\nnot mediate the association between personality and self-\nreported physical health.\nNext, we examined whether the strength of these asso-\nciations were equivalent across men and women. We con-\nducted multigroup analyses, using gender as the grouping\nvariable. Personality, length of bereavement, and age\naccounted for 12.8percent of the variance in negative social\nexchanges for females and 18.4\npercent of the variance in\nnegative social exchanges for males. Personality, length of\nbereavement, age, and negative social exchanges accounted\npercent of the variance in self-reported physical\nhealth for females and 26.3percent of the variance in self-\nreported physical health for males.

We\nconducted multigroup analyses, using length of bereave-\nment as the grouping variable.

Personality, gender, age, and\nnegative social exchanges accounted for 27.7percent of\nthe variance in self-reported physical health for those\nrecently bereaved and 20.1percent of the variance in self-\nreported physical health for those not recently bereaved.\nThe structural weights for males and females did signifi-\nsee Tables 5 and 6).\nDiscussion\nWhile the association between personality and physical\nhealth has been the frequent topics of the study (Hampson\nand Friedman, 2008), little is known regarding whether the\nassociation can be replicated among bereaved individuals.\nIt is important to examine whether the association is main-\ntained given research indicating that bereavement nega-\ntively influences physical health (e.g. Stroebe et al., 2007).\nIn addition, it is important to examine whether bereaved\nindividuals' personality influences the types of interactions\nthey receive from members of their social network given\nthe fact that bereaved individuals may have more contact\nwith their network after the death of a loved one. Thus, this\nstudy was designed to determine whether personality influ-\nenced the frequency of negative social exchanges and self-\nreported physical health in a bereaved sample.\nSelf-reported physical health\nIn our bereaved sample, findings regarding the associa-\ntion between personality and self-reported physical health\nwere somewhat similar to those found using non-bereaved\nsamples. Based on prior research (e.g. Atherton et al.,\nwas hypothesized that neuroticism would be negatively\nassociated with self-reported physical health, while con-\nscientiousness and agreeableness would be positively\nassociated with self-reported physical health. Our\nbetas are reported.\nSilva et al. 9\npredictions regarding neuroticism and conscientiousness\nwere supported; however, our findings contradicted previ-\nous research with regard to agreeableness and physical\nhealth. Perhaps, our bereaved individuals who were higher\nin agreeableness were also more open, cooperative regard-\ning how they felt, or more likely to conform to unhealthy\nsocial pressure, which could lead to poorer self-reported\nphysical health.\nBased on previous research (e.g. Roelfs et al., 2012),\nwe predicted that age and length of bereavement would be\nnegatively and positively associated with self-reported\nphysical health, respectively. Our prediction regarding\nage was supported while length of bereavement was not.\nOne potential cause of this non-significant finding may be\nthe method of measuring length of bereavement. Instead\nof measuring length of bereavement as a continuous vari-\nable, this study examined length of bereavement as a cat-\negorical variable. In addition, individuals who had\nexperienced the death of loved one more than 2years prior\nto the study were assigned to the same category. This con-\nceptualization of length of bereavement may have masked\nthe association between length of bereavement and self-\nreported physical health.\nAnother potential reason may be the fact that our predic-\ntion was based on research that emphasizes time since\ndeath. Other bereavement research has found that the\namount of time that has passed since the death of a loved\none may only impact a subset of bereaved individuals.\nResearches emphasizing psychological outcomes after the\ndeath of a loved one have investigated different trajectories\net al., 2011). While the number of specific trajectories var-\nies, the data suggest that half of bereaved individuals show\nno grief response or show a very small response before\nimmediately returning to their baseline. Additionally, a\nsubset of bereaved individuals (10%\u00ad20% depending on\nthe study) may experience chronic or complicated grief,\nwhere the individuals show high levels of symptoms that\nTable 4.

These results suggest that the majority of bereaved\nindividuals would not show differences or changes over\ntime, which would limit the length of bereavement's pre-\ndictive ability in a statistical analysis.\nNegative social exchanges\nBased on previous research (e.g. Bolger and Zuckerman,\nhypothesized that neuroticism and extraversion would be\npositively associated with negative social exchanges, while\nconscientiousness and agreeableness would be negatively\nassociated with negative social exchanges. Our findings\nregarding neuroticism and conscientiousness supported\nthose predictions while our findings regarding extraversion\nand agreeableness did not. It is possible that our bereaved\nindividuals who were higher in extraversion endorsed the\ntrait of friendly greater than the other traits that constitute\nextraversion. Furthermore, it is possible that our bereaved\nindividuals who were higher in agreeableness were more\nlikely to engage in social network members' requests.\nWhile we did not make an a priori prediction regarding\nthe association between openness to experience and nega-\ntive social exchanges, we found a small but significant\npositive association. It is possible that our bereaved indi-\nviduals who were higher in openness to experience were\nmore willing to engage in activities which may bring judg-\nment or criticism from their social network in order to cope\nwith the death of their loved ones.\nBased on prior research (Beals and Rook, 2006;\nCarstensen, 1992), it was predicted that women and\nyounger participants would report experiencing more nega-\ntive social exchanges. Our prediction regarding women\nwas supported; however, our prediction regarding age was\nnot. The non-significance of the association between age\nand negative social exchanges was particularly surprising\ngiven that our prediction was based on socioemotional\nselectivity theory (Carstensen, 1992), a very heavily\nresearched and well-supported theory. Perhaps there is\nTable 5.

In fact, the inclusion\nof negative social exchanges in the structural equation\nmodel accounted for an additional 7.2\npercent of the vari-\nance in self-reported physical health. This finding lends\nfurther support to the idea that the type and quality of inter-\naction with one's social network is particularly important\nwhen trying to understand how individuals cope with life\nstressors. Future bereavement research should consider\nattempting to separate the impacts of different types of neg-\native social exchanges, such as well-meaning negative\nsocial exchanges (e.g. offering inappropriate or unwanted\nadvice), accidental negative social exchanges (e.g. failing\nto spend time together), and purposeful negative social\nexchanges (e.g. being critical about personal concerns), as\noutcomes may differ in kind or severity based on the type\nof negative social exchange.\nLimitations\nResults should be interpreted in the context of the follow-\ning limitations. Due to the unique characteristics of the\nsample (e.g. Amazon Mechanical Turk sample, mostly\nhighly-educated Caucasian individuals, and very diverse\nrelationships with the deceased), results may not be gener-\nalizable to other populations experiencing bereavement.\nFurthermore, previous research indicates that individuals\nwho have obtained higher levels of education or income\nTable 6.

As such, this sample may have been less likely\nto experience negative social exchanges. It is possible that\nnegative social exchanges would have a stronger associa-\ntion among personality and self-reported physical health in\nother samples. Future research should examine these asso-\nciations in a more generalizable sample.\nWhen examining personality, this study only examined\nthe influence of each personality trait separately. It is possi-\nble that certain associations were not found among person-\nality, negative social exchanges, and self-reported physical\nhealth as a result of not taking into consideration personality\nprofiles or interactions among personality traits. Kinnunen\net al. (2012) examined personality profiles and self-rated\nhealth in middle-aged adults, with results indicating that the\nover-controlled personality profile (i.e. higher in neuroti-\ncism and lower in extraversion) reported the worst self-rated\nhealth compared to the other personality profiles. Future\nresearch should examine the role of personality profiles or\ninteractions among negative social exchanges.\nThere are some methodological concerns with the SF-12\nand negative social exchanges scale. Specifically, physical\nhealth was assessed through self-report via the SF-12.\nThus, the association between personality and self-reported\nphysical health may be biased because individuals who are\nhigher in neuroticism are more likely to report physical\nhealth symptoms (Friedman and Kern, 2014). Future\nresearch assessing physical health should examine objec-\ntive measures of health to offset this reporting bias. In addi-\ntion, the negative social exchanges scale asked participants\nto rate how frequently they have experienced negative\nsocial exchanges within the past year. As such, it is possible\nthat participants were not reporting the amount of negative\nsocial exchanges they have received during their length of\ntheir bereavement, especially the individuals who experi-\nenced bereavement less than a year.\nFinally, this study was a cross-sectional study. As such,\nonly associations can be inferred from the results. Future\nresearch should take a longitudinal approach to personality,\nnegative social exchanges, and physical health. Through this\napproach, researchers can control for previous negative social\nexchanges and physical health and examine whether changes\nin negative social exchanges influence physical health.\nImplications\nDespite the limitations, there are many important implica-\ntions from our findings. First, our data suggest that person-\nality retains the association with physical health even in the\ncontext of experiencing stressful life events with known\nimpacts on physical health. Second, researchers in the\nbereavement field could target individuals who are more\nlikely to experience greater declines in physical health\nbased on their individual and social characteristics. These\nindividuals could be assessed with a questionnaire, which\nwould be resource inexpensive and efficient in time.\nFinally, our results suggest that negative social exchanges\nare an important area of study for future bereavement\nresearch. While much research has focused on the role of\nsocial support in assisting bereaved individuals, our data\nimply that the type and quality of interactions with mem-\nbers of the social network are important to examine. If the\nmembers of the bereaved individual's social network are\nnot supportive, even if well-intentioned, they may cause or\nexacerbate difficulties for the bereaved adult.\n"
