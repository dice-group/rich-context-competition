All analyses used Wald tests to\ncompare sample means.\n(n = 2,589/2,799) items. Pain items varied by gender with women reporting more head, arm, hip/buttock, leg, and foot\npain compared to men, (p < .05) at each individual site. Women also reported more intense pain compared to men--2.13\nversus 1.94, respectively (p < .05). Pain items demonstrated remarkable similarity among age cohorts. Health indicators\nwere significant and in the expected direction (p < .001). An increase in comorbidity, ADL and IADL dependence, worse\nself-rated health, and more depressive symptoms were each significantly more common among participants who reported\nmoderate or greater pain compared to none to mild pain.\nDiscussion. Pain presence, location, and intensity measures were successfully integrated into NSHAP Wave 2 and\nexhibit construct and external validity.\nKey Words: Location--Measurement--Older adult--Pain.\nThe perception of pain is a universal experience and\nalerts us to internal and external threats to our integ-\nrity (Woolf, American College of Physicians, & American\nPhysiological Society, 2004). Acute pain generally repre-\nsents a noxious stimulus produced by injury and/or disease,\nis limited in its duration, and serves a protective function.\nIn contrast, persistent (e.g., chronic) pain lasts beyond the\nusual course of an acute process, injury, or chronic patho-\nlogical process and lacks a meaningful biologic function\n(Woolf et al., 2004). Persistent pain can last for months or\nyears and manifest symptoms intermittently or continu-\nously (AGS Panel on Persistent Pain in Older Persons,\nassociated with persistent pain substantially impacts the\nwell-being and health of older adults including poorer phys-\nical, psychological, and social outcomes compared to older\nadults without pain (AGS Panel on Persistent Pain in Older\nGibson & Lussier, 2012; Reitsma, Tranmer, Buchanan,\nThe elucidation of reliable and valid reports of a\npatient's pain experience is paramount in order to bet-\nter delineate the relationships between persistent pain and\nhealth in older adults. This can be obtained from several\nsources including self-report, proxy report, and an assess-\nment of pain behaviors, of which self-report is considered\nthe gold standard (AGS Panel on Persistent Pain in Older\nMultidimensional pain measures, such as the Brief Pain\nInventory and McGill Pain Questionnaire (Atkinson et al.,\ncomprehensive assessment of a person's pain experience\nincluding pain descriptors, exacerbating and relieving fac-\ntors, impact of analgesia, and an extensive inventory of\npain-related interference with physical and psychological\nfunctioning. However, the time needed to complete these\ninstruments and the specificity of the questions to pain-\nrelated impairment usually limits the use of these measures\nto studies whose primary objective focuses on pain-related\noutcomes.\nUnidimensional pain measures (e.g., pain intensity) pro-\nvide an alternative approach to capturing a person's pain\nexperience. These measures benefit from minimal respond-\nent burden, a rapid administration time, and strong psy-\nchometric properties. Unidimensional measures include\nthe numeric rating scale (NRS) (e.g., 0 to 10-point scale),\nvisual analogue scale (VAS) (e.g., continuous line anchored\nby two end-points), and the verbal descriptor scale (VDS)\n(e.g., verbal terms express the level of pain). The response\nto these scales can then be used to determine the propor-\ntion of participants with pain, its intensity, and the relation-\nship between pain and other health-related conditions, such\nas depressive symptoms or physical health. Unfortunately,\nunidimensional pain scales do not permit an evaluation of\nother important pain-related characteristics captured by\nmultidimensional scales.\nIn response to the burgeoning evidence surrounding the\nrelationship between pain and physical, psychological, and\nsocial health among community-dwelling older adults, the\nNational Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP)\nincorporated a pain assessment. Pain measurement in Wave\n1 focused on pain presence in the lower extremity. Wave 2\nincorporated a more comprehensive pain assessment includ-\ning its presence, location, and intensity. In this article, we\ndescribe the rationale for selecting the pain measures for\nNSHAPWave 2, derive information regarding its internal and\nexternal validity, and provide recommendations for measure\nuse as an outcome or covariate for NSHAP-related research.\nMethod\nOverview\nNSHAP is a nationally representative, longitudinal sur-\nvey designed to investigate the complex interplay of social,\nbiological, emotional, and environmental factors that come\nwith aging. Persistent pain represents a common experience\namong older adults with a theoretical as well as empirical\nrole in aging trajectories (Blyth et al., 2008; Shega, Dale,\net al., 2012). Despite this, epidemiologic studies of aging\nfrequently overlook pain assessment or select measures\nnot adequately validated in older persons. Moreover, stud-\nies that incorporate a pain measure maintain noteworthy\nlimitations, including an assessment of pain presence but\nnot intensity, measurement in one wave but not others, and/\nor failure to assess pain uniformly across multiple waves\nthe longitudinal relationship of pain with health at the popu-\nlation level remains poorly understood.\nIn Wave 1, pain presence was assessed in the lower\nextremity while walking (see Table 1).\nIn Wave 2, investigators sought to integrate a more robust\npain measure in order to address the shortcomings of previ-\nous studies as described above, and to better understand the\nrelationship of pain with health. Given the time and space\nconstraints within NSHAP, investigators elected to incor-\nporate a brief, yet scientifically rigorous assessment of per-\nsistent pain, including its presence, location, and intensity.\nA literature review was conducted along with input from\npain and aging experts (J. W. S. and W. D.) to establish opti-\nmal measures.\nData are publicly available (NSHAP Wave 1: Waite,\nLinda J., Edward O. Laumann, Wendy Levinson, Stacy\nTessler Lindau, and Colm A.

Pain represents a continuum with cut\npoint between acute, subacute, and persistent being some-\nwhat arbitrary. Persistent pain generally lasts for weeks\nto months from which we selected a threshold of 4 weeks\nTable 1.

The pain map, as depicted in Figure 1,\nadapted from Margolis et al., has undergone rigorous reli-\nability and validity testing in older populations (Margolis,\nis widely recognized as the pain location measure of choice\nin older adults with and without cognitive impairment.\nThe front and back of a body is divided into 45 areas and\nrespondents circle painful locations. These numbered body\nareas correspond to 1 of 12 body locations, as described\nin Figure 1. In Wave 2, we asked participants to indicate\nwhere they have felt the most pain in the past 4 weeks (see\nTable 1). Over half of Wave 2 respondents indicated more\nthan one painful location.\nTheVDS was selected as the pain intensity measure based\nupon the findings of several landmark studies examining the\npsychometric properties of unidimensional pain measures\nK. A. Herr et al., 2004). Older adults routinely choose the\nVDS (compared to the NRS and VAS) as the most preferred\nunidimensional pain intensity measure (K. Herr et al., 2007;\nthe VDS demonstrated the highest completion rates when\ndirectly compared to other unidimensional measures (K.\nexhibits superior reliability and validity compared to other\nunidimensional measures in older adults from different eth-\nnicities and range of cognitive abilities (K. Herr, 2002; Li,\nTable 1 displays the stem and response categories for the\nVDS incorporated into Wave 2.\nWe recommend the pain descriptors be recoded into\nthe following numeric format: 0 = no pain, 1 = slight\npain, 2 = mild pain, 3 = moderate pain, 4 = severe pain,\n5 = extreme pain, and 6 = the most intense pain imaginable.\nIn this format, verbal pain descriptors can be readily trans-\nlated into numeric values to facilitate data analysis with\npain as a predictor or outcome (Scudds & Ostbye, 2001;\nShega, Andrew, et al., 2012). Also, the pain intensity meas-\nure can be dichotomized at the moderate intensity level\nand greater (e.g., no pain, slight pain, mild pain vs moder-\nate pain, severe pain, extreme pain, and the most intense\npain imaginable) to better ascertain clinically relevant pain\n(Collins, Moore, & McQuay, 1997; Shega, Andrew, et al.,\nThe data collection process in NSHAP included three\ncomponents: (a) an in-home face-to-face interview; (b) a\ncollection of biomeasures; and (c) a leave-behind self-\nadministered questionnaire. The pain questions for Wave 1\nand 2 were assessed in the leave-behind self-administered\nquestionnaire. Pain presence with walking in Wave 1 was\ncompleted by 82.3% of respondents. Among Wave 2 sam-\nleave-behind questionnaire of which 2,799 were age eligi-\nble for the current analysis. The pain questions were asked\nin the order and format displayed in Table 1.

Respondent completion rates by item in order of presentation.\nwas followed by location, and intensity with response\nof respondents did not answer the pain presence question\nand intensity (n = 204) items as reflected by the larger sam-\nple size for these later groups. See Figure 2 for a flow dia-\ngram displaying participant response to pain-related items\nbased upon response to the pain presence question. These\nrespondents were coded as \"missing\" for analyses of the\npain presence item in this article. However, researchers may\nconsider recoding the skipped pain presence responses as\n\"yes\" or \"no\" based upon the responses to the subsequent\npain location or intensity measures. Investigators should\nestablish their analytic approach a priori depending upon\nthe research question. Also, participants who reported no\npain in the past 4 weeks on the pain presence question were\ndirected to skip the subsequent two questions on pain loca-\ntion and intensity. These participants (n = 798) were subse-\nquently identified as \"missing legitimately\" for the latter 2\nquestions and coded as a \"no pain\" response.\nStatistical Analysis\nIn order to generate an inter-wave robustness test of pain\nresponses, we ran Pearson's correlations between the simi-\nlar, but not identical, measures capturing walking pain at\nWave 1 and pain location at Wave 2, limiting the analysis\nto Wave 1 returning respondents. Of note, a series of ques-\ntions also evaluated sex-related lower extremity pain at\nWave 1; however, these items were not examined in this\nanalysis since they are more appropriately intended for use\nwith the NSHAP sexual measures. Eleven out of the 12\nbody locations assessed in Wave 2 demonstrated significant\nassociations with Wave 1 walking pain (data not presented).\nWalking pain at Wave 1 was positively correlated with\nall lower body extremity pain sites at Wave 2-hip/buttock\nSummary statistics were generated for walking pain,\npain presence, location, and intensity. Sample means\nby gender and age (Table 2) were compared using Wald\ntests. In order to examine mean differences among the\nthree age categories, the pain measures were regressed\non age, followed by the Wald tests. Pain intensity reports\nwere dichotomized (no to mild pain vs moderate pain\nor greater) among Wave 2 respondents and compared\nby demographic characteristics along with physical and\nmental health status (Table 3). The analytic sample was\nfirst compared to the nonrespondent group, as a portion\nof respondents neglected to answer the pain items which\nrespectively.\nResults\nMean pain presence, location, and intensity by gen-\nder and age are presented in Table 2. In general, women\nreported more pain by location and intense pain than\nmen. Among women who completed the pain location\nhip/buttock (19.7%) were the most common painful\nTable 2.

Among men who completed the pain location\nand foot (15.3%) were the most frequently reported\npainful locations. In addition, women described more\nhead, arm, hip/buttock, leg, and foot pain compared to\nmen, (p < .05) at each individual site. Women reported\nrespectively (p < .05).\nNext, Table 2 compares mean pain reports of presence,\nlocation, and intensity according to age cohorts specified at\nthat although there were some qualitative differences in\npain presence, location, and intensity, only a few reached\nstatistical significance. Older respondents reported more\nhead pain and chest pain, but less genital pain than younger\nrespondents (p < .05).\nPain reports categorized as no to mild versus moder-\nate or greater among Wave 2 respondents by demographic\ncharacteristics along with physical and mental health fac-\ntors are displayed in Table 3. Women were more likely to\nreport moderate or greater rather than none to mild pain,\ngraduates reported lower rates of moderate or greater\nrespectively (p < .01). All of the health indicators were\nsignificant and in the expected direction (p < .001). An\nincrease in comorbidity, ADL and IADL disability, poorer\nself-reported health, and more depressive symptoms were\neach significantly more common in participants who\nreported moderate or greater pain compared to none to\nmild pain.\nDiscussion\nPain presence, location, and intensity questions were suc-\ncessfully incorporated into NSHAP Wave 2 with acceptable\nresponse rates for a leave-behind questionnaire. Participants\nwho reported walking pain at Wave 1 were more likely to\nreport lower extremity pain (e.g., hip/buttocks, genital, leg,\nand feet pain) at Wave 2. Pain was commonly reported as\n49.8% of the sample endorsed moderate or greater pain in\nthe past 4 weeks. Moreover, moderate or greater pain was\nassociated with worse health, including increasing comor-\nbidity, ADL and IADL disability, poorer self-reported\nhealth, and additional depressive symptoms compared to\npersons who reported none to mild pain.\nAmong age eligible Wave 2 participants, over half indi-\ncated pain in more than one body area. Based upon ques-\ntion wording and respondent reporting, we recommend\ninvestigators interpret the pain location measure as marked\nareas corresponding to painful locations. However, we do\nnot believe these areas necessarily represent locations of\nthe most intense pain, nor can one infer an absence of\nmarkings indicating no painful locations. The convergent\nand predictive validity of the pain location measure is sup-\nported by the correlation of respondents reporting pain in\nthe lower extremity in Wave 1 and an increased likelihood\nof circling painful areas in the lower extremity in Wave\n2. Moreover, respondents indicated lower extremity pain\n(e.g., leg, back, and foot) was more common than other\nlocations such as head, upper extremity, and chest, as\nhas been demonstrated in other older adult samples, sup-\nporting the measures' external validity (D. Weiner et al.,\nTable 3. Wave 2 Sample Characteristics by Pain Intensitya\nDemographic\nHealth\nNotes. aEstimates weighted to account for probability of selection and differential nonresponse.

Variations in pain report may\nstem from sample characteristics including participant loca-\ntion (e.g., community-dwelling, assisted living facility, and/\nor nursing home) along with patient specific factors such as\ncomorbidity and the presence of cognitive impairment, as\nwell as characteristics of the pain measure itself. The fact\nthat the prevalence of pain in our sample mirrors that of\nother studies further substantiates the external validity of\nthe pain presence and intensity measures incorporated into\nNSHAP Wave 2. Importantly, item nonresponse did vary\nby gender and age. Therefore, researchers interested in the\nrelationship of pain with these variables should consider an\nadjustment for differential nonresponse to minimize bias.\nThe construct validity of the NSHAP pain intensity\nmeasure is further supported by the association of mod-\nerate and greater pain with poorer health. Pain intensity\ndemonstrates the predictive relationship of pain with physi-\ncal, psychological, and overall health among older adults\n(Eggermont, Penninx, Jones, & Leveille, 2012; Leveille\net al., 2009; Parmelee, Harralson, McPherron, DeCoster,\n2003). We generated the NSHAP measure based on the\ncriterion of previous research that utilized verbal descrip-\ntor scales, and these results meet expectations for an older\nTable 3 presents evidence for concurrent validity since\nmoderate or greater pain was associated with additional\nphysical disability and depressive symptoms as well as\npoorer self-reported health compared to those with no or\nmild pain. Moderate or greater pain was also associated\nwith additional comorbid conditions, many of which are\nassociated with persistent pain, such as arthritis, diabetes,\nand osteoporosis. These results can be used as guidelines\nby analysts who wish to distinguish between the health of\nat least two sub-samples of respondents by self-reported\npain intensity. While the above findings argue the \"4 week\"\ntime-frame in the stem of the pain item represents persis-\ntent pain, such report may also represent other designations\non the pain continuum including acute or subacute pain,\nthereby limiting generalizability.\nWe recommend that investigators interested in pain as\nan outcome dichotomize the intensity measure at the mod-\nerate intensity level and greater (e.g., no pain, slight pain,\nmild pain vs moderate pain, severe pain, extreme pain,\nand the most intense pain imaginable). This represents\n\"clinically relevant pain\" or pain associated with physical,\npsychological, and social health (Collins et al., 1997; Shega,\nused as a predictor, investigators may elect to use either the\npain intensity measure at the cutoff of moderate intensity\nor higher or the pain presence measure (yes or no). It is\nimportant to note that the verbal descriptor levels maintain\nordinal and not interval properties. That is, the increase in\nphysical, psychological, and social impairment between\npain levels (e.g., mild to moderate vs moderate to severe)\nis not equivalent.\nIn conclusion, we were able to successfully incorporate a\npain presence, location, and intensity measure into NSHAP\nWave 2. The robustness of the variables is supported by a\nhigh completion rate of pain items by respondents along with\nevidence of external validity. Researchers can utilize the pain\nmeasures as a predictor or outcome and as a continuous or\ndichotomous variable depending upon the research question.\nNSHAP investigators hope and encourage researchers to use\nthese measures to further our understanding of the relation-\nship between pain and health, particularly social health.\n"
