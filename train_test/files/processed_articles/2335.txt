We analyzed data from\nthe National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey\n(NAMCS) and National Hospital Ambulatory\nMedical Care Survey (NHAMCS) between the\nMethods\nDesign of NAMCS and NHAMCS\nThe NAMCS and NHAMCS, conducted by the\nNational Center for Health Statistics (NCHS),\ncontain nationally representative data on ambula-\ntory visits in the United States. NAMCS collects\ninformation on patient visits to community, of-\nfice-based physician practices, including visits to\nfederally qualified health centers and nonfederal\ngovernment clinics. The database incorporates a\nmultistage probability design, accounting for\ngeographic location, physician specialty, and in-\ndividual patient visits within the practice. Physi-\ncians are randomly selected and assigned to a\n1-week reporting period. Data for a systematic\nrandom sample of visits is recorded on a stan-\ndardized encounter form and checked for com-\npleteness by NCHS field staff. Sampled physi-\ncians complete 30 records per sampling week.\nThe NHAMCS collects information on patient\nvisits to nonfederal hospital outpatient departments\nand hospital emergency departments. The data\nfrom hospital emergency departments were not\nused in this study. NHAMCS incorporates a mul-\ntistage probability design, accounting for geo-\ngraphic primary sampling units, hospital outpatient\ndepartments within primary sampling units, and\nclinics within outpatient departments. The final\nsampling stage involves systematic random samples\nof outpatient department visits during randomly\nassigned 4-week reporting periods.\nThe response rate for physicians sampled in\nNAMCS and hospital outpatient departments sam-\nof the sample records using a 2-way independent\nverification procedure. Item nonresponse rates are\n5% for most variables. For this study, major ex-\nceptions include race (18% to 33% annual nonre-\nsponse rates) and ethnicity (22% to 35% annual\nnonresponse rates). The NAMCS staff imputed\nmissing data to help compensate for nonresponse\nto items involving race and ethnicity. Imputation\nwas performed by randomly assigning a value from\na patient record form with similar characteristics.\nThe NCHS weights each visit to allow extrap-\nolation to national estimates for all aspects of the\nsurvey. The weights account for practices that were\ninvited to participate but declined to do so. Na-\ntional estimates are considered reliable with a stan-\ndard error of 30%, which generally corresponds\nto a sample of at least 30 patient visits.15 The\nNCHS institutional review board approved the\nprotocol, including a waiver of the requirement for\ninformed consent.\nCreation of Variables\nWe examined all ambulatory visits with a primary\npurpose of gynecological examination (Interna-\ntional Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision,\nClinical Modification [ICD-9-CM] codes V72.3,\nV72.31) and routine cervical Papanicolaou test\n(ICD-9-CM code V76.2) and considered these to\nrepresent preventive gynecologic visits.17 Inclusion\ncriteria included these preventive gynecologic visits\nmade by women 18 years old. A variable was\ncreated and defined as concurrent medical diagno-\nsis, indicating whether the secondary or tertiary\ndiagnoses included a medical condition or nonpre-\nventive gynecologic condition addressed during the\npreventive gynecologic visit. These concurrent di-\nagnoses were classified by ICD-9-CM codes in the\nfollowing categories: infectious and parasitic dis-\nhealth status and contact with health services (codes\ndiagnostic categories were not analyzed separately\nbecause of insufficient numbers for analysis: disease\nof blood and blood-forming organs (ICD-9-CM\nmedical diagnosis occurring during a preventive\ngynecologic visit represented the primary outcome\nof the study.\nThe diagnostic codes used in the NAMCS/\nNHAMCS are not derived from billing informa-\ntion. Rather, physicians list diagnoses on a 1-page\nsurvey form near the time of the office visit, which\nthen are coded by staff at the NCHS central office.\nSurvey participants are instructed that the intention\nis to capture the clinical scope of the encounter\nrather than the order or number of problems that\nwould result in the highest level of billing.\nProvider variables include self-selected specialty.\nPhysician specialty was categorized as a visit occur-\nring with either a primary care physician or obste-\ntrician-gynecologist. Primary care physicians in-\ncluded visits occurring at a family medicine (67%),\ninternal medicine (21%), or general medical clinic\n(12%). In addition, visits were further categorized\nby whether the visit occurred with the patient's\nprimary care physician and based on the provider's\nresponse to the question.\nClinical and demographic data, including age,\ninsurance status, and race, were collected for each\nvisit and de-identified.16 Clinical variables included\nthe primary diagnosis and 2 secondary diagnoses\ncoded according to the ICD-9-CM.17 The NCHS\ndivides the country into 4 geographical regions:\nNortheast, South, Midwest, and West. Rural loca-\ntions were identified based on the designations of\nnon\u00admetropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) by the\nUS Office of Management and Budget. An MSA is\ndefined as a county or group of contiguous counties\nthat contains at least one city with a population of\nStatistical Analysis\nWe calculated standard errors for all results, as\nrecommended by the NCHS, using STATA soft-\nware version 10 (StataCorp, LP, College Station,\nTX).16 STATA was programmed with the masked\nsurvey design variables to account for the complex\nmultistage sample design and weighting calcula-\ntions that allow for making population estimates\nand generation of variance estimates that result in\nconservative tests of significance.19 We evaluated\ncategorical variables with the 2 test.

Preventive gynecologic visits may\nrepresent the sole time during a year that women\nseek health care and therefore represent a chance to\naddress coexisting diseases that do not involve the\nfemale reproductive system, such as disorders of\nthe endocrine or circulatory systems or mental\nhealth disorders. It is plausible that acute or chronic\ncomplaints not addressed during preventive gyne-\ncologic visits may represent a missed opportunity\nfor some women.\nThis analysis is unable to answer the question of\nwhether those women seen by obstetrician-gyne-\ncologists for preventive gynecologic visits had sub-\nsequent visits with other health care providers at\nwhich additional screening, treatment, and coun-\nseling of nongynecologic diseases were completed.\nHowever, a woman's need to rely on multiple visits,\noften with multiple physicians, throughout their\nlife for primary health care needs conflicts with the\ncurrent principles and ideals of the patient-cen-\nTable 1.

However, primary care en-\ncompasses a much broader scope of care than\npreventive services, including the ability to ini-\ntially evaluate and treat a variety of presenting\nogists' primary care practice patterns found by\nColeman et al,23 we found that primary care\nphysicians were significantly more likely than\nobstetrician-gynecologists to address the follow-\ning diagnoses during a preventive gynecologic\nvisit: mental disorders and endocrine/metabolic,\ncirculatory, respiratory, digestive, and skin/sub-\ncutaneous diseases.23 Primary care physicians ad-\ndressing concurrent nongynecologic medical is-\nsues is a component of receiving continuous,\ncomprehensive women's health care.\nOur analysis of this nationally representative da-\ntabase has several inherent limitations. We are un-\nable to address any outcomes or quality of care,\nwhich might affect the interpretation of the study\nfindings, recognizing that the ultimate goal of co-\nordinated and comprehensive care is improved\nhealth outcomes. Second, NAMCS data provide a\nsnapshot of a single visit rather than tracking indi-\nvidual patients over time, making it impossible to\ndetermine whether obstetrician-gynecologists may\nhave recognized concurrent medical problems but\nreferred patients to another provider for manage-\nment. This practice of referring to another physi-\ncian would still signify a less timely and less com-\nprehensive approach to care and thereby does not\ndetract from the study conclusions. In addition,\nNAMCHS categorizes specialty as only general\nmedical clinic, not allowing for any individual anal-\nysis of specialty by internal medicine or family\nmedicine. The NAMCS database contains limited\ndata on the contribution of mid-level providers to\noutpatient preventive gynecologic visits, prohibit-\ning any analysis of visits made to independently\nfunctioning nurse practitioners or midwives. Last,\nin this database rural status was considered to be\nnon-MSA as defined by the US Office of Manage-\nment and Budget.18 This designation, however, oc-\ncurs at the county level and may actually misclassify\nsmaller, rural areas as urban if they are located\nwithin a county considered to be an MSA.\nConclusion\nPrimary care physicians are significantly more\nlikely to address concurrent medical problems dur-\ning preventive gynecologic visits compared with\nobstetrician-gynecologists. These findings demon-\nstrate the vital role of primary care physicians in\nTable 2.

A potential patient-\ncentered model of care may include having multi-\ndisciplinary sites where women have access to dif-\nferent providers who can work together to provide\noptimal care at one site. As US health systems\nincreasingly adopt these patient-centered princi-\nples, the role of primary care in meeting the unique\nneeds of women's health should be considered to\nprovide women with comprehensive preventive and\nprimary care within the medical home. For women,\nthis may prove to be a critical factor as they strive\nto ensure that both their gynecologic and nongy-\nnecologic health needs are addressed.\nReferences\n1.
