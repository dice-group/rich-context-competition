These\nstudies using instrumental variable estimates have\nfound strong associations between education and\nreduced risk of mortality12 as well as better cognitive\nfunctioning at older ages.13\nA different approach to identify the causal effect of\neducation on health is the use of twin- or sibling-\nfixed-effect designs. Krieger et al.14 showed that\nfemale twins discordant on occupational class differed\nwith respect to systolic and diastolic blood pressure\nand low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. In the same\nstudy, twins who were discordant on education did\nnot vary by the health outcomes examined. Osler\net al.15 reported an analysis of twins who were discor-\ndant on social class (defined by type of employment\nand vocational education). Among dizygotic (DZ)\ntwins, they found associations of occupational class\nwith height and cognitive score for males and physi-\ncal activity score for females. However, the same rela-\ntionships were not observed among monozygotic\n(MZ) twins, leading the authors to conclude that\nthe relationship between occupational class and\nhealth is due mainly to selection effects (i.e. those\nwho have better health enjoy higher social class)\nrather than a causal effect. One limitation of these\nprior twin studies is that they dichotomized socio-\neconomic position (high vs low) so they could not\nassess `dose\u00adresponse' of health outcomes across\nyears of schooling. In order to examine the impact\nof additional years of schooling, a fixed-effect model\nis superior to stratification analysis.16\nThe National Survey of Midlife Development in the\ndata, which provide detailed educational attainment,\nhealth outcomes and health behaviour information.\nThe current study hypothesized that differences in\neducational attainment influence the health and\nhealth behaviours of twins sharing the same genetic\nbackground and family environment. The MIDUS\ntwin data were used to identify the causal effect of\neducational attainment on health and health beha-\nviours among twin pairs, MZ and DZ, who shared\nthe same family environment in childhood. If a pos-\nitive association was observed in both MZ and DZ\ntwin pairs, this provides evidence of a causal effect\nof schooling on health. If a positive association was\nobserved only in DZ twins, the association between\nhealth and education may be still confounded by\ngenetic factors. If both the DZ and MZ twin pairs\nshowed null associations, this suggests that the rela-\ntion between schooling and health is biased by unob-\nserved confounders such as inherited ability, early\nfamily environment or health selection effects.\nMethods\nStudy population\nDetails of the sampling procedures have been\nexplained elsewhere.17 Twin pairs were recruited by\nusing a separate two-part sampling design. The first\npart involved screening a representative national\nsample of $50 000 households for the presence of a\ntwin. The screening was conducted by International\nCommunications Research, the market research group\nof AUS Consultants and Bruskin Associates.\nRespondents who indicated the presence of twins in\nthe household or being part of a twin pair themselves\nwere asked permission to be contacted by a research\nteam for inclusion in the first national study of twins.\nThe presence of a twin in the family was reported by\nmission to be contacted for the twin study. The\nsecond part of the twin sample design was carried\nout by interview staff at the Institute for Social\nResearch (the University of Michigan) who contacted\nthe twin households in order to recruit twins to par-\nticipate in the survey. The cooperating twins were\nasked to provide contact information for their co-\ntwins. Almost half (49%) of the first contacts identi-\nfied twin pairs who did not meet the eligibility criteria\nof the study (aged between 25 and 74 years, non-\ninstitutionalized, living in the continental USA and\nEnglish speaking). The final response percentage for\ncomplete twin interviews was 26%. The final response\npercentage for the twin pairs varied according to\nwhether the first contact was with a relative of the\ntwin (20% response percentage) or the twin himself\nor herself (60% response percentage). The final twin\nsample included a total of 1996 twins, resulting in\nSince the impact of education on health potentially\nvaries by gender,18 different-sex DZ twins (n \u00bc 526;\n263 pairs) were excluded. We also excluded twins in\nwhom the zygotic status was unknown (n \u00bc 32;\n16 pairs). Finally, we excluded twin pairs if one of\nthe pair reported that they had lived separately\nMZ and same-sex DZ twins). The final study sample\nMeasurements\nTwin pairs were interviewed by a telephone question-\nnaire, which inquired about educational attainment,\nthree health outcomes (perceived physical and mental\nhealth and number of depressive symptoms) and sev-\neral types of smoking behaviour (further details\nbelow), followed by a self-administered mailed ques-\ntionnaire, which inquired about four additional health\noutcomes [perceived global health, body mass index\n(BMI), waist circumference (WC) and waist\u00adhip ratio\n(WHR)], as well as physical activities. The telephone\nand the self-administered mail questionnaire was\nIn the telephone survey, educational attainment was\nassessed by asking the highest grade of school or\nyears of college completed. The responses were categor-\nized into 12 groups: no school/some grade school,\neighth grade/junior high school, some high school, gen-\neral educational development (GED), graduated from\nhigh school, 1\u00ad2 years college (no degree yet), 3 years\nof college (no degree yet), graduated 2 years college\n(vocational or associate degree), graduated 4 or 5\nyears college (bachelor degree), some graduate school,\nmasters degree, doctor degree (PhD, EdD, MD, DDS,\nLLB, LLD, JD) or other professional degree. We then\nassigned the average number of years of schooling to\neach category as follows: no school/some grade\nschool \u00bc 4, eighth grade/junior high school \u00bc 8, some\nhigh school \u00bc 10, GED \u00bc 11, graduated from high\nyears college (vocational or associate degree) \u00bc 14,\ngraduated 4 or 5 years college (bachelor degree) \u00bc 16.5,\nsome graduate school \u00bc 17, masters degree \u00bc 18 and\ndoctor degree (PhD, EdD, MD, DDS, LLB, LLD, JD) or\nother professional degree \u00bc 20. Perceived physical\nhealth was assessed using a single question: `In general,\nwould you say your physical health is . . ..' with Likert-\nscale responses ranging from poor, fair, good, very good,\nor excellent.\nPerceived mental health was also assessed using a\nsingle question: `What about your mental or\nemotional health?' with Likert-scale responses ran-\nging from poor, fair, good, very good or excellent.\nThe responses `poor' and `fair' were collapsed a priori\ninto a single category, since the lowest category (poor)\nby itself was too small to allow meaningful statistical\nanalysis (0.9%). To assess depressive symptoms, ques-\ntions in the Composite International Diagnostic\nInterview Short Form (CIDI-SF) were used. The\nassessed depressive symptoms were (i) lack of interest\nin most things, (ii) feeling more tired or having lower\nenergy than usual, (iii) loss of appetite, (iv) sleeping\ndifficulties, (v) difficulty concentrating, (vi) feeling\ndown, bad or worthless and (vii) increased thoughts\nof death. The total number of depressive symptoms\nwas examined as a mental health outcome.\nFor smoking, we examined the following behaviours\nseparately: (i) ever smoking, (ii) age at starting to\nsmoke regularly, (iii) current regular smoking, (iv)\nnumber of cigarettes smoked per day during the\n1 year in life when the individual smoked most heav-\nily, (v) experience of trying to quit smoking and\n(vi) age at the time when the individual last\nsmoked regularly. The smoking variables were all\ndichotomous (yes/no), except the number of ciga-\nrettes per day (which was asked only for current\nsmokers).\nIn the mailed questionnaire, perceived global health\nwas assessed using a single question: `Using a scale\nfrom 0 to 10 where 0 means the worst possible health\nand 10 means the best possible health, how would\nyou rate your health these days?' To calculate BMI,\nheight and current weight were asked. To measure\nwaist and hip circumference, a tape measure was\nenclosed and respondents were provided with instruc-\ntions to (i) take the measurements while standing,\n(ii) avoid measuring over clothing, (iii) record\nanswers to the nearest quarter inch and (iv) follow\nthe figure shown in the questionnaire booklet to\nguide where to take the measurements. The physical\nactivity was assessed by four questions: `During the\nsummer, how often do you engage in vigorous phys-\nical activity (for example, running or lifting heavy\nobjects) long enough to work up a sweat?'; `What\nabout during winter--how often do you engage in\nvigorous physical activity long enough to work up a\nsweat?'; `During the summer, how often do you\nengage in moderate physical activity (for example,\nbowling or using a vacuum cleaner)?'; and `What\nabout during the winter--how often do you engage\nin moderate physical activity?'. The responses were\nin six categories: several times a week or more,\nabout once a week, several times a month, about\nonce a month, less than once a month and never.\nThese questions have been validated in previous stud-\nZygosity was determined as identical or fraternal\ntwins using self-report data collected as part of the\ninitial twin-screening questionnaire. In cases where\nthe respondent was unsure, DNA analysis was\nperformed on returned cheek cell samples. Similar\nmethods of diagnosing zygosity have been shown to\nAnalysis\nFirst, all twin pairs were treated as individuals and\nthe association between educational attainment and\ncontinuous health outcomes/behaviours were investi-\ngated using a generalized estimating equation (GEE)\nmodel, which adjusts for the clustering of outcomes\nwithin twin pairs. Individual covariates (age, gender,\nrace, working status and marital status) were also\nadjusted. The number of depressive symptoms was\nexcluded from GEE analysis due to a high degree of\nright skew. Details of individual covariates are pre-\nsented in Table 1.\nSecondly, the relationships between education and\nhealth outcomes/behaviours were re-analysed by\nusing the fixed-effect model among twin pairs. See\nGreene24 and Hsiao25 for a detailed description of\nthe statistical approach used in the fixed-effect\nmodel, and Fujiwara et al.16 as an example. Briefly,\nin the fixed-effect model, the effect of education on\nhealth outcomes/behaviours was calculated by cancel-\nling the effect of unknown shared factors, such as\ngenetic or early family environmental influences,\nthat might affect health outcomes/behaviours. An\nequation representing the association between health\nand education for each pair of twins (let the first\nsubscript, i, represent the twin pair, and let the\nsecond subscript represent either twin 1 or 2 in the\npair) can be written as follows:\n\u00fe fi\n\u00fe fi\n,\nwhere\ny is health outcomes/behaviours,\nx is the educational attainment,\ng and f, respectively, represent unmeasured factors\nsuch as genetic endowment g and early family envi-\nronment f and e represents a normal error term.\nIn the fixed-effect model, the effects of these\nunmeasured factors (i.e. fixed effect) can be cancelled\nby subtracting the equations as follows:\n) \u00fe (fi\n\u00ad fi\n),\nwhich can be rewritten as\nyi\nxi\n\u00c3\u00fe gi\n\u00c3 \u00fe fi\n\u00c3 \u00fe ei\n\u00c3, where the asterisk indi-\ncates the difference of variables within each twin pair.\nAs early family environment is the same in both MZ\nand DZ twins, fi\n\u00c3 is equal to zero. In MZ twins, the\ngenetic endowment is the same; hence, gi\n\u00c3 is equal to\nzero. Therefore, if b'1\nis different between MZ and\nDZ pairs, the difference can be interpreted to be due\nto the term gi\n\u00c3.\nIn fixed-effect analysis, years of schooling and\nhealth outcomes (perceived global, physical, mental\nhealth, BMI, WC, WHR) were treated as continuous\nvariables. The number of depressive symptoms was\ntreated as an ordinal variable (due to a high degree\nof right skew), and ordered logistic regression was\nused. In terms of health behaviours, for smoking\n(other than number of cigarettes per day), variables\nwere treated as binary in the fixed-effect models. The\nnumber of cigarettes was also analysed among current\nsmokers as a continuous variable, to check the dose\u00ad\nresponse effect of education on smoking. For physical\nactivity, first, responses were dichotomized into those\nwho responded `never' versus any physical activity.\nSecondly, among those who responded doing any\nphysical activity, items were re-coded into average\nmonthly physical activity using the category mid-\n`13.5'. Detailed analyses were performed to examine\nthe effects of schooling on different aspects of smok-\ning behaviour. In sensitivity analysis, education was\ntreated as a categorical variable (i.e. less than high\nTable 1 Demographic characteristics of the sample\nVariables\nMale\ntwins\nFemale\ntwins\nDemographics\nZygocity\nEducation\nRace\nWorking status\nMarital status\nData are given as N (%) or mean standard deviation (SD),\nunless otherwise mentioned.\nschool, high school, some college, college or more).\nAll analyses were performed by Stata SE version 9.0.\nResults\nDemographic characteristics including educational\nattainment are shown in Table 1.

These percentages\nwere similar to the original MIDUS study, a national\nrepresentative sample (e.g. 79% of females do moder-\nate physical activity at least once a week in the\nsummer and winter).26\nThe individual-level associations between years of\nschooling and health outcomes/behaviours adjusted\nfor covariates (race, working status and marital\nstatus) as well as the within-twin pair correlation\nare shown in Table 3. Among males, years of school-\ning were positively associated with perceived global,\nphysical and mental health, while BMI, WC and WHR\nwere not associated with schooling.

Among\nfemale twins, the associations between education and\nhealth outcomes were broadly in a similar direction as\nthe GEE results, except for smoking status where\nyears of schooling and smoking status were not asso-\nciated among female twins in the fixed-effect model.\nTo increase the power, sex-combined fixed-effect\nanalysis was performed (results shown in Table 5).\nIt is noteworthy to report that years of schooling\npositively associated with perceived global health:\neach additional year of schooling increased the\nscore of perceived global health (range 0\u00ad10) by 0.1\nTable 2 Continued\nVariables Mean SD Mean SD\nModerate physical activity in summer\nModerate physical activity in winter\nthe same association was not found with the point\nestimate showing an inverse association between\nyears of schooling and perceived global health.\nAnthropometric outcomes suggested associations\nbetween higher years of schooling and lower BMI\nand WC among MZ pairs. Smoking status was not\nassociated with years of schooling in sex-combined\nMZ and DZ twins.\nTable 6 shows the association between schooling\nand detailed smoking behaviours using the fixed-\neffect model. Schooling was not associated with ever\nsmoking. Among DZ male twins, schooling reduced\nthe likelihood of being a current smoker (OR: 0.66,\nciation was not observed in MZ male twins, although\nthe point estimate was similar.

This suggests that the associa-\ntion between schooling and smoking status may be\nconfounded by unobserved genetic factors.\nOur findings were consistent with the middle-aged\nDanish twin study.15 In their study, self-reported\nhealth, BMI, depressive symptoms, smoking habits\nand physical activity were not associated with educa-\ntion after cancelling for genetic and early family envi-\nronmental factors. A previous study showed that the\nassociation between education and smoking is stron-\nger than the association between occupation and\nsmoking.2 Gilman et al.27 showed robust associations\nbetween lower educational attainment and smoking\npatterns, although adjustment for family environment\n(using a fixed-effect approach among siblings) failed\nto confirm the association.27 A study of female twins\nin Virginia also showed that both genetic and envi-\nronmental factors were associated with smoking ini-\ntiation and nicotine dependence.28 It is possible that\nthere are health selection effects on the association\nbetween education and health, i.e. poor health\nduring childhood, such as asthma or epilepsy, may\nbe prior common causes of both limited educational\nachievement as well as poor health in adulthood.29,30\nHowever, it is premature to conclude that education is\nnot causally associated with smoking. In our study,\nalthough the fixed-effect model among MZ male\ntwins failed to show a strong association between\neducation and current smoking, the point estimate\nwas nonetheless 0.60, which is in the expected direc-\ntion. The weak associations reported in our twin\nfixed-effect analyses may be due to low statistical\npower, rather than to the absence of a causal effect\nof education on health outcomes.\nIn addition, our study showed an association\nbetween education and dose of moderate physical\nactivity among male DZ twins, but not male MZ\ntwins, suggesting unmeasured genetic factors, but\nnot early family environment, may influence the asso-\nciation between education and moderate physical\nactivity among males. With regard to females, no\nassociation was found between education and physi-\ncal activity after cancelling genetic and early family\nenvironmental factors, although a strong association\nwas found in the individual analysis. This suggests\nthat the associations between education and physical\nactivity in individual analysis were confounded by\ngenetic and early family environmental factors\namong females. These findings are consistent with\nprevious findings suggesting stronger genetic influ-\nences on physical activity among males than\nIn summary, the current study showed possible\ncausal effects of education on perceived global\nhealth and on smoking habits among males, but did\nnot suggest direct associations between schooling and\nthe other health outcomes studied. The repeatedly\nobserved association between education and health\nmay be at least partly confounded by genetic or\nearly family environmental factors.9 Nonetheless, our\nstudy also suggested that education may be effective\nin prevent smoking habits among men.\nOur study has several limitations. First, the analyses\nare cross-sectional, so that reverse causation cannot\nbe ruled out. However, educational attainment was\ndetermined before 25 years of age, the youngest age\nof our sample, so that poor health status (which most\npeople begin to succumb to at older ages) is less likely\nto have affected educational attainment. The remain-\ning bias is health status during schooling, i.e. those\nwith major illnesses during childhood might have\ncompleted fewer years of schooling, and also ended\nup with lower levels of health in adulthood. Secondly,\nthe analyses assume that twins living together up to\naged 14 years shared the same family environment,\nbut living together in childhood does not necessary\nmean that they shared the same `rearing' family\nenvironment. Thus, for example, the inverse associa-\ntion between schooling and smoking among male\ntwins might be explained by a difference in the rear-\ning environment between twins. Thirdly, BMI, WC\nand WHR were reported by the respondents, not mea-\nsured by the investigators. The null associations\nbetween schooling and BMI, WC and WHR may be\ndue the reporting bias, as educational attainment\ncould affect self-reporting of health outcomes, thereby\ndiluting the true association between schooling and\nhealth outcomes. Other risk factors for poor health,\nfor example, blood pressure or low-density lipoprotein\ncholesterol level, were not measured. Fourthly, the\nlimited response percentage could have led to selec-\ntion bias in this study. The educational level among\ntwins in this study was somewhat higher than that in\nthe original MIDUS study. It is also possible that\ntwins who were discordant on educational attainment\nwere less likely to participate in the twin study in\norder to avoid comparisons with their opposite twin\npair. Such selection bias may have contributed to an\nunderestimation of the association between schooling\nand health/health behaviours.\nIn conclusion, education was associated with health\noutcomes in individual-level analysis, but in fixed-\neffect analysis (i.e. adjusted for genetic and early\nfamily environment), the associations were less\nrobust, even though the direction of the associations\nwas similar.\nFor specific health behaviours, such as current\nsmoking and frequency of moderate physical activity,\nschooling appeared to be associated in the hypothe-\nsized direction among males, though not in females.\nTaken together, our twin fixed-effect analyses suggest\nthat at least some cases of the education/health rela-\ntionship reflect confounding by unobserved third\nvariables.\nConflict of interest: None declared.\n The association between education and health may be confounded by unobserved common prior\ncauses such as inherited ability, personality such as time preference, or early family circumstances.\n The twin fixed-effects approach can potentially address this problem by cancelling these factors\nbetween twin pairs.\n The findings showed that among monozygotic twins, more years of schooling was associated with\nbetter perceived global health.\n For health outcomes/behaviours, the point estimates of the effect of education suggested a weak\nprotective association.\nReferences\n1 Marmot M, Ryff CD, Bumpass LL et al.

Where do we go from here?\nMia Madsen1 and Merete Osler1,2*\nIt has become increasingly recognized that many\nof the associations between various exposures and\nhealth outcomes measured in adulthood are con-\nfounded by social and behavioural factors acting\nearly in life,1 and recent research has questioned\nwhether socio-economic position (SEP) in adulthood\nin fact has an additional impact on adult health\nbeyond the influence of one's childhood environment\nand genetic make-up.2\nThe traditional way to examine the independent\ninfluence of adult SEP on differences in health out-\ncomes is to use multivariable models, which mutually\nadjust for early and late social factors. However, such\nanalyses may not provide sufficient adjustment for all\nthe factors that constitute childhood social environ-\nment, and close correlation between early and late\nsocial factors may present serious statistical chal-\nlenges. Alternative approaches for dealing with con-\nfounding are designs that approximate the conditions\nof a true experiment. One such approach is the\ndiscordant twin-pair design employed by Fujiwara\nand Kawachi3 in their well-designed and innovative\nstudy. Here, the authors compare health status in\ntwin pairs who are discordant on educational status\nin adulthood, but are matched fully or partly on\ngenetic make-up and rearing environment. Such a\nstudy on twin-pair discordant on exposure provides\na useful analogue to the idealized counterfactual\ndesign, and failure to observe an association within\ndiscordant twin pairs would imply that a previously\nobserved association between an exposure and an out-\ncome is attributable to common genetic or shared\nenvironmental factors. In addition, differences in the\nmagnitude of association between monozygotic and\ndizygotic twins may serve to further disentangle the\nrespective effects of genetic and familial environmen-\ntal effects.\nHowever, as enchanting as this approach may seem,\nas with everything else, it has a price: in this case, the\nflip side of the coin is the fact that the statistical\npower in the fixed-effects analyses is dramatically\nlimited, resulting in highly imprecise estimates.\nThe implication of this is that these `unconfounded'\nestimates may in fact be further away from the `true\nvalue', which we are trying to estimate, due to the\nlarge imprecision of estimates.4 A consequence of\nthis is that authors are left with considerable room\nfor interpretation of results and, in some cases, inter-\npretation tends to border on arbitrariness. To illustrate\nthis point, we would like to call attention to a discus-\nsion paper by Lundborg,5 which essentially is based\non the same data (MIDUS survey, first data collection\nwave) as the paper by Fujiwara and Kawachi,\nalthough dizygotic same-sex twin pairs were not\nincluded. Despite the fact that the results in the\ntwo papers appear to be fairly similar, the authors\n* Corresponding author.
