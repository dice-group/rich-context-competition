The aim of this study was gaining an understanding of\njournalists' changing role perceptions in health crisis coverage, and moreover to examine\npotential differences between general and specialist reporters. We conducted 22 in-\ndepth interviews with reporters with experience in health crisis reporting in Germany\nand Finland. Findings suggest that journalists' roles shift when covering health crises\n(versus non-crises), towards a role as public mobilizers, towards classifying risks and from\na watchdog to a more co-operative role. Furthermore, professional characteristics matter\nin journalists' understanding and performance of their roles. Specialist reporters appear\nbetter equipped to deal with the challenges of health crisis coverage, such as balancing\nremaining critical with co-operation with authorities in their efforts to contain crises.\nSpecialist reporters are also less likely to get swayed by the panic often accompanying\nhealth crises than general reporters are.\nCorresponding author:\nCeline Klemm, Department of Communication Science, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1081,\nEmail: c.klemm@vu.nl\nArticle\n2 Journalism \n",

Health authorities and medical\nexperts, for example, often appeal to the media to use their power to impact public health\nto the better (Leask et al., 2010). They desire the media to broadcast their messages of\nreassurance and appeals of adherence to precautionary measures to the public (Holmes,\n2008), or to act as partners in emergency response (Reynolds and Seeger, 2005; Veil and\nOjeda, 2010). Scholars, in turn, admonish journalists to act as accurate and critical\nreporters on health matters, to function as health educators and to be aware of becoming\nmere mouthpieces of authorities (Schwitzer, 2004; Schwitzer et al., 2005). Probably\nresulting from these diverse expectations, there generally exists more discontent than\ncontent regarding how well the media perform their various roles. During past crises,\nsuch as the Swine flu or recent Ebola outbreak, journalists were repeatedly criticized for\nfalling short of expectations, reporting inaccurately, imbalancedly or aggravating fears\nThe fact that journalists face strongly articulated (and at times conflicting) expecta-\ntions hints at what may be an important variable in the overall process of communicating\nhealth crises, namely, journalistic role perceptions. Journalistic role perceptions have\nbeen defined as `generalized expectations which journalists believe exist in society and\namong different stakeholders' and which they perceive as legitimate part of their profes-\nsional self-image (Donsbach, 2008: 2605). They are not established in a vacuum but in\nresponse to the expectations journalists experience from various societal stakeholders,\nsome of which they endorse and eventually act on. Role perceptions influence journal-\nists' decision-making and their news products (Skovsgaard et al., 2013; Van Dalen et al.,\n2012), and can serve as a base for normative judgement as role performance is judged by\nothers (and role holders themselves) by `how well they conform to the expectations'\n(Turner, 2001: 234). Accordingly, journalists'self-perceived roles can be interpreted as a\npivotal concept that is logically positioned between stakeholders' expectations and the\nactual journalistic product.\nMuch is known about universal societal roles of journalism (e.g. Hanitzsch, 2011;\nHanitzsch et al., 2011; Willnat et al., 2013), however, little is known on how, in a health\ncrisis, journalists themselves understand their roles, how they negotiate the diverse\nexpectations, and which of these they accept as legitimate. At its base, this study aimed\nat gaining an in-depth understanding of what journalists'perceive as their key roles when\ncovering health crises, in particular outbreaks of novel or re-emerging infectious diseases\nor food safety crises. Recent studies (e.g. Mellado and Lagos, 2014) suggest that report-\ning on certain issues might require particular roles or responsibilities. A few studies also\nKlemm et al. 3\nsuggest differences between general reporters and science or medical reporters (e.g.\nLeask et al., 2010). Accordingly, the present study's wider goal was understanding spe-\ncifics in health crisis coverage, such as whether situational (e.g. uncertainty, time pres-\nsure) and professional (e.g. specialized expertise) characteristics effectuate role shifts\namong journalists. Therefore, we conducted 22 in-depth interviews with journalists\nexperienced in health crises reporting.\nJournalistic role perceptions: Role shifts during crises\nJournalistic role perceptions have been primarily studied in survey research on large,\noften cross-national samples of generalist or political reporters. Scholars devoted a\ngreat deal of effort to developing role typologies and identifying universally shared\nrole perceptions (e.g. Hanitzsch et al., 2011; Willnat et al., 2013). One of the key stud-\nies by Weaver and Wilhoit (1996) proposed a taxonomy of four roles that journalists\nadopt: interpreter, disseminator, adversarial and populist mobilizer. Journalists assum-\ning an interpreter role feel they ought to provide analysis and interpretation of com-\nplex problems, as well as investigate government claims. The disseminator role\nentails fast information dissemination and verification of facts. The adversary role\nmainly involves developing public interest, and the populist mobilizer role giving a\nvoice to `ordinary' citizens and providing entertainment. In the last decades, several\nother typologies have been developed. Most prominently, Hanitzsch (2011) identified\nfour professional milieus with shared values: detached watchdog, critical change\nagent, opportunist facilitator and populist disseminator. Skovsgaard and colleagues\ndifferentiated roles based on two dimensions: an active versus passive stance, and\njournalists' democratic conception, representation versus participation (Skovsgaard,\nWhile these studies have provided invaluable insights into the journalism profession\nas a whole, much less is known on the particulars in role perceptions that might arise in\nspecific contexts, even though situational demands, such as those of a health crisis, may\nbring about shifts in journalistic roles or demand additional, situation-specific roles.\nPrior research indicates that journalists working in different journalistic beats, that is,\ncovering designated subjects such as politics or economy, differ in the professional\nstandards they endorse (Reich, 2012), and in the importance they assign to journalistic\nroles, depending upon several contextual factors, such as news organizations, culture and\nstories belonging to different news beats, different roles predominated. `The functions\nand roles of journalism in society are diverse, and some news beats have been associated\nwith the fulfillment of certain roles over others', the authors argue (Mellado and Lagos,\ncrisis coverage as a specific subgenre of news requires unique journalistic norms.\nExtending this logic, we argue that other contexts, like a health crisis, may equally bring\ncertain journalistic roles to the fore.\nThe Oxford Handbook of Public Health Practice (Bolton and Burkle, 2013) gives a\nbroad definition of a public health crisis, as\n4 Journalism \nan event(s) that overwhelms the capacity of local systems to maintain a community's health\n[...] Crisis can range from specific health issues, such as a disease outbreak in an otherwise\nunaffected community, to a full-scale disaster with property destruction and/or population\ndisplacement and multiple public health issues. (pp. 210\u00ad211)\nIn this article, the definition of health crises is narrower, including only crises of the\nformer type, that is, outbreaks of previously unknown infectious diseases (e.g. AIDS,\nEbola), re-emerging diseases (e.g. measles) or diseases that are spreading to new areas of\nthe world, or the occurrence of food safety crises (e.g. Escherichia coli). Our definition\noverlaps with what has been studied under the term `emerging infectious diseases' by\nScience and health coverage is usually initiated by scientific innovations, and there is\nample time to research stories. Health crises situations, in comparison, are characterized\nby a sudden, often inconceivable, emergence of a severe threat, creating a sense of\nurgency and a need for immediate response (Rosenthal et al., 2001). Paradoxically, crises\ncreate a pressing `need for specific and accurate information'(Sellnow and Seeger, 2001:\n16), yet, they are also characterized by uncertainty and high complexity, and scientific\nknowledge might not be available yet. When the public's demand for accurate and\nactionable information is not filled in a timely manner, rumours may arise and be relied\nupon (Veil et al., 2008), making crises often inherently emotion-laden (Glik, 2007). We\npropose that these contextual characteristics influence journalists' perceived importance\nof various roles. Journalists might adopt a stronger role in crisis mitigation (e.g. promot-\ning adherence to precautionary measures), or of pressing for political solutions, as Kr\u00fcger\nHealth crisis coverage and professional characteristics\nNumerous studies have investigated risk reporting generally, and medical reporting more\nspecifically. A common focus of studies is the quality of news coverage (e.g. Shuchman\nand Wilkes, 1997; Smith et al., 2005). An important finding was, for example, that the\njournalistic practice of `balance' can generate bias in news reporting (Boykoff and\nBoykoff, 2004). Although generalizations have to be treated with caution, common pat-\nterns in the way the mass media report on risk stories have been uncovered. Media are\nmore likely to cover risks with a large number of fatalities at one time rather than a\ncumulative number of larger fatalities over time, risks that are unusual (`man-bites-dog'\nformula) or evoke controversy, and stories tend to focus on conflict between stakehold-\ners, or the human aspect of risk. In terms of sources, news media rely heavily on author-\nConcerning medical reporting, several scholars have provided theoretical debates on\nthe roles and responsibilities of health journalists (e.g. Schwitzer, 2004; Schwitzer et al.,\n2005). However, research studying the perspectives of science and medical reporters\nthemselves are far less common. A meta-synthesis by Amend and Secko (2012) identi-\nfied 21 such studies, the majority of which focused on sourcing practices and news selec-\ntion, only three on the professional roles of health and science reporters. To the best of\nour knowledge, only one study has examined the roles journalists assume in the specific\nKlemm et al. 5\ncontext of health crisis coverage. Hooker et al. (2012) interviewed 16 Australian journal-\nists on their criteria for newsworthiness, perceptions of news accuracy and journalistic\nroles. They found journalists experienced role conflicts between assuming a role as inde-\npendent and neutral public informants and feeling responsible for supporting public\ninterests and officials' crisis mitigation efforts (Leask et al., 2010: 535).\nLeask et al. (2010) indicate that general and specialist reporters differ in their report-\ning in that specialist reporters are better able to produce high-quality stories, and have\nnegotiating power within their organizations. Other studies likewise indicate that such\ndifferences might exist, specifically with regards to the use of sources (Conrad, 1999),\nand journalists'critical perspective on scientific events (Henderson and Kitzinger, 2007;\nSaari et al., 1998). A second goal of the present study was to analyse potential differences\nbetween general and specialist reporters in the coverage of health crisis events to deepen\nour understanding of the impact of professional characteristics as a key determinant on\nthe roles journalists adopt, and of role performance.\nMethod\nWe conducted semi-structured, in-depth expert interviews with newspaper journalists\nand editors with relevant experience in health crisis reporting between October 2014 and\nSample and procedure\nWe used purposive sampling, specifically maximum variety sampling. Following Patton\n(2002), participants were chosen to reflect a large diversity in information-rich cases\nrelevant to the research interest: different news organizations (national, regional, popular\npress and quality press), levels of expertise (generalist vs specialist reporters) and auton-\nomy (editor, journalist). We additionally included two European countries, Finland and\nGermany. Both share several core values along Hofstede's (2001) cultural dimensions\nrelevant to the context of this study but differ regarding their newspaper market and his-\ntory with health crises. Specifically, both countries are highly uncertainty avoidant (i.e.\nfeel threatened by ambiguous/unknown situations) and low on power distance (i.e.\nexpect power to be distributed equally in society) (Hofstede Center, 2016), aspects we\nexpect to influence the response to the new, ambiguous threat a health crisis poses and\njournalists'positioning towards authorities. Finland has an exceptionally high newspaper\nconsumption (third highest in the world), yet only one dominant, and by far largest,\nnational newspaper: Helsingin Sanomat. The remaining dailies consist mainly of two\nevening tabloids, and otherwise regional newspapers. While strong local papers equally\nexist in the German market, there are several leading national papers with different polit-\nical orientations (Kelly et al., 2004). This awards the national newspaper in Finland with\na more central position in health crisis scenarios, whereas German media are more com-\npetitive (e.g. in getting access to authorities) but also more likely to broadcast diverse\nviews on events. Regarding past health crises, most notable differences are that Germany\nwas (with France) the only country with an E. coli (Ehec) outbreak in 2011 (World\nHealth Organization, 2016), which many journalists considered one of the few `hot'\n6 Journalism \ncrises, threatening the local public. Finland (with Sweden) was affected by an increase in\nnarcolepsy cases, often considered a side-effect of the H1N1 vaccine (Nohynek et al.,\n2012), which impacted journalists.1 Our aim and the benefit of the described sampling\nstrategy is that it allows to identify `shared patterns that cut across cases and derive their\nsignificance from having emerged out of heterogeneity' (Patton, 2002: 235).\nExperience was a prerequisite. As no formalized news beat of `health crisis reporters'\nexists, we attempted to identify those most experienced with health crisis reporting in\neach newspaper in two ways. First, we contacted reporters who had reported at least\nseveral times on health crises events (e.g. on the then current Ebola and measles out-\nbreaks) during the last year, although several had years of experience. Second, we con-\ntacted managing editors about who they considered `specialists' on the matter. Some\nnews organizations had no reporters designated to reporting on health issues, yet several\nothers had specialized reporters (besides generalist journalists assigned to covering\nhealth on demand). Our sample included 18 journalists (of which 11 specialist reporters)\nand four editors, most of which were also writing stories (N\n=\n22). For Finland, we\nincluded journalists working for Helsingin Sanomat, Ilta-Sanomat, Iltalehti, Aamulehti,\nTurun Sanomat and Hofvudstadsbladet, and for Germany, journalists from S\u00fcddeutsche\nZeitung, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, BILD, Die WELT, Der Tagesspiegel and\nK\u00f6lner Stadtanzeiger. Interviews lasted 30\u00ad75minutes (on average 1hour) and were pre-\ndominantly conducted face-to-face, few by telephone (n=4).\nInterview guide\nThe interview guide addressed three topic areas. Section A concerned journalists'notions\nof indicators of the quality of health crisis coverage. Questions addressed journalists'\nperceptions of what characterizes `good' health crisis reporting, journalistic practices\nand organizational structures, (dis)content with these and (special) ethics of health crisis\ncoverage. Section B concerned self-perceived roles: questions addressed what journalists\nfelt their roles and responsibilities in crises were, how these would change in acute crisis\nstates and how roles have changed given a changing media landscape. Section C con-\ncerned the role and usage of emotions in health crisis reporting, the findings of which\nwill be reported elsewhere, due to their complexity. Furthermore, interviewees were\ngiven the opportunity to offer their view of what the term `health crisis' meant. Most\nsalient in their understanding were more recent infectious disease outbreaks like Ebola,\nH1N1, measles and Ehec; fewer mentioned HIV/AIDS, or local crises such as bacteria in\nhospitals.\nCoding and analysis\nAll interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim following transcription rules\nproposed by Dresing et al. (2013). We conducted a thematic analysis, which posits `a\nmethod for identifying, analysing and reporting patterns (themes) within data' (Braun\ncomprises six phases that allows for systematization and transparency of the coding and\nanalysis process, which we followed. Codes and thematic map were discussed with two\nKlemm et al. 7\nindependent researchers, which then informed the refinement of themes, their definition\nand naming. Thematic analysis allows us to identify shared patterns across the state-\nments of various interviewees centred around our two research interests, while staying\nflexible to identify other emerging themes. Next, we will discuss the key findings for\nboth research interests.\nContinuities and situation-driven shifts in roles\nWe found both continuities in roles and role shifts that appear driven by the contextual\nspecifics of a health crisis. We will first briefly discuss continuities in roles, before dis-\ncussing the three major shifts in roles that we identified. Several of the roles identified in\nearlier studies as `universal' or `general' roles remain important professional roles in the\ncontext of health crises coverage. First, interviewed journalists were strongly committed\nto their information dissemination function (Hanitzsch, 2011; Weaver and Wilhoit, 1996;\nWillnat et al., 2013). Some stated, gathering as much new information as possible and\nadhering to classic journalistic norms like balance, verification of facts and accuracy is\nwhat matters most, also during health crises. Second, interviewees mentioned responsi-\nbilities that resonate with Weaver and Wilhoit's (1996) interpretive role, namely, provid-\ning contextual analysis as well as commentary (i.e. a subjective interpretation of facts/\nevents). Some journalists mentioned, third, assuming a classic watchdog role (e.g.\nWeaver and Wilhoit, 1996) and, fourth, a translator role, which has been identified as a\ncommon role among science journalists (Fahy and Nisbet, 2011). Besides these continui-\nties, we identified three role shifts.\nTowards a role as public mobilizers\nMost noteworthy was a shift towards a public mobilizer role that many of the journalists\nin our sample assume when covering health crises events. We identified two core respon-\nsibilities \u00ad mobilizing self-protective behaviours and mobilizing social responsibility \u00ad\nas part of this role.\nMobilizing individuals' self-protective behaviours involves enabling audiences to\ntake precautionary measures, and \u00ad to some extent \u00ad also encouraging the performance\nof such measures. Most interviewees felt they hold an important duty to provide advice\nor action recommendations. One journalist, for example, commented,\nYou need to give people the right information that they can take precautions, they know if they\nneed to take a vaccine or anything. You have a big role there. (Interviewee 11)\nSome interviewees perceived their role to go beyond solely supplying practical `how-\nto-act' messages and adopt a role as health educators. German interviewees frequently\ndescribed their key responsibility as Aufkl\u00e4rung, a concept which includes both provid-\ning practical instructions and health education, enabling citizens'self-determining health\ndecision-making. While there was general agreement about their role of enabling precau-\ntionary health behaviours, there was little explicit mention of health promotion or advo-\ncacy of such behaviours. However, some expressed them like one interviewee who\n8 Journalism \ncommented on a recent measles outbreak during which large subsections of the German\npopulation rejected vaccination:\nEventually it is their own health, yes, but you also impact the health of others if you reject. And\nwell, so then we wanted to explain together with doctors, why this vaccination is important.\nThe discussed responsibility of advice-giving and health education reflects a general\ntrend in news reporting. One editor recounted that her newspaper had recently formally\nintroduced a so-called Hy\u00f6t\u00f6 journalism, a Finnish term that translates to `how-to-act'\njournalism. Another journalist remarked similarly:\n[A] strategy, not so new but it has been in place for about eight months is to put the reader's\ninterests first. So we try to think of advice. We are trying to do stories that people find helpful.\n(Interviewee 4)\nProviding `how-to-act'messages, what health communication scholars term `mobiliz-\ning information' (Hinnant et al., 2012), is thus not restricted to health crises. However,\nwe find that it greatly gains in importance in the crisis context. This is illustrated by the\nremark of an editor on how reporting would change in case of an acute crisis:\n[O]f course the nature of the reporting would also change to even more a service than before.\nLike, to tell where you can get treatment, where you need to call, what are the first symptoms,\nreally the information that you need (...) And of course we do that now too, but that would\nchange. (Interviewee 11)\nIf a crisis becomes more acute, journalists' role seems to shift from a more gen-\neral-educative to a more active, advising role. Several interviewees state they focus\nmore on action recommendations \u00ad at times in collaboration with authorities \u00ad while\nthese are usually a side-facet of reporting. The comment of one editor is typical for\nthis shift:\nIn that case also the news coverage would become less hypothetical. And it also would have to.\nSo it would really very clearly say: `Dear people out there, do not leave the house. Don't do the\nfollowing'. So, really tell people concretely: `It is dangerous at this moment, the following\nthings you now have to do'. (Interviewee 16)\nA second core responsibility of the public mobilizer role is mobilizing social respon-\nsibility. Journalists in this study described their role as `social conscience', reminding\nsocieties `we have to act like human beings', or `create an awareness'.\nOne key aspect commonly mentioned was encouraging philanthropic behaviours\nsuch as volunteering or donations:\nHumanitarian catastrophe is the first thing, I have to remember that, and they need immediate\nhelp and the whole international community needs to help and unite not only to prevent the\nspreading of the disease but also help the people, who are suffering. (Interviewee 3)\nKlemm et al. 9\nAnother aspect which several journalists considered important is discouraging anti-\nsocial behaviours and attitudes, such as stigma, prejudices, racism and `othering':\nI always think about writing about health issues as some kind of creating more acceptance and\ntolerance. For people that are not mainstream and all the same. Because we are different and\nsomebody walks badly, somebody is not right in his head, and so on. But we are still all here.\nAnd it is kind of an anti-racism thing. (Interviewee 7)\nParticularly in health crises situations, stereotypes and resultant blames can easily\nsurface, and in extreme cases, individuals can become an object of stigma or hatred, as\nhappened during the latest Ebola outbreak (Yusuf et al., 2015). Many journalists in our\nsample were aware of these issues and considered fighting stereotypes and safeguarding\nthe anonymity of the affected party a particularly important ethical consideration. One\njournalist remarked that fighting stereotypes includes a perceptive treatment of official\nmaterials, which are not always immune to prejudice:\nEven the statements of the WHO were in parts slightly stigmatizing and I think it was relatively\neasy to fall into the trap of simply repeating these and then also contribute to a stigma or a slight\nracism. (Interviewee 18)\nThe public mobilizer role has been identified in earlier research and described as a\nresponsibility `to pursue and promote certain solutions to societal problems'(Skovsgaard\net al., 2013: 8). This definition fits with the enhanced sense of responsibility among our\nsample. However, unlike earlier definitions that viewed the role as a duty to motivate\ncitizens to participate in a democratic debate and give a voice to ordinary citizens\n(Skovsgaard, 2014; Skovsgaard et al., 2013), we identified two substantially different\ncore responsibilities: mobilizing self-protective behaviours and mobilizing a socially\nresponsible treatment of others. Journalists shift towards a specific type of public mobi-\nlizer when covering health crisis events.\nTowards classifying risk\nSecond, we identified a shift towards a stronger focus on classifying health crisis risks\nand treatments. This seems closely related with journalists' shift towards a public mobi-\nlizer role, as it likewise aims to enable people's decision-making regarding risk.\nInterviewees commonly felt that the public disproportionately fears new health risks,\nwhile in reality common diseases (e.g. tuberculosis, diarrhoea) or other threats (e.g. car\naccidents) pose bigger risks, as is illustrated in one interviewee's comment:\nI also reported once about other diseases prevailing in those regions, and which other ones\ngenerally have amounted to very large crises, and that those involved at times considerably\nlarger numbers than in the current case of Ebola. That Ebola, hence, is not the worst that ever\nplagued the world. (Interviewee 19)\nHence, journalists emphasized providing a framework that allows to grade or assess\nevents/facts in a context of other entities, for example, how fatal a new virus is compared\nto other diseases or risks (German interviewees use the term Einordnung). While this\nrole is also important in non-crisis contexts, journalists' roles shift in acute crises in the\nsense that classifying risks becomes a prime responsibility. To illustrate, one interviewee\nstated regarding acute crises,\n[A]t that point, it is the important art of journalism to classify events. (Interviewee 20)\nThis is echoed by the comment of another interviewee who, when asked whether her\nrole changes in acute crises, answered, `Yes, towards classification' (Interviewee 18).\nBesides the finding that certain responsibilities within roles become accentuated, also\njournalists' interpretation of their respective roles is influenced by the health crisis con-\ntext. Although we find like Weaver and Wilhoit that journalists adopt an interpretive role\nin health crisis coverage, some of the responsibilities that define this role, for example,\n`investigating government claims'(Weaver and Wilhoit, 1996: 137), were not mentioned\namong our interviewees. Rather, their focus shifts from official policies to a contextual-\nization and interpretation of complex medical or scientific facts.\nFrom watchdog to co-operative\nThird, we identified a shift in the stance journalists adopted towards authorities. Earlier\nstudies suggest that journalists tend to assume a strong watchdog role and critically eval-\nuate authorities' emergency response to health crises (Veil, 2012). Yet, in the current\nstudy, few interviewees expressed adversarial attitudes or adopted a watchdog role.\nRather, interviewees described their relations to authorities as based on co-operation or\nconsider co-operation highly important. It must be noted that journalists in this study\ngenerally differed in their stances towards authorities: some assumed a stronger watch-\ndog role, while others were more neutral, or co-operative. Yet, when discussing health\ncrisis reporting, most interviewees expressed co-operative attitudes, and especially in\nmore acute stages, there was a general shift towards co-operation. This is illustrated by\nthe comment of one interviewee on reporting during health crises:\nYes, yes. I think we have come a bit nearer to the authorities. Maybe we were in our own\nposition and the authorities were there, and we have come closer to each other. Someone could\nsay that we are too close (laughing) you know! (Interviewee 1)\nJournalists' shift from a watchdog to a more co-operative role appears logical given\nthat as public mobilizers, journalists' goals are more naturally aligned with the goals of\nhealth authorities than in the reporting of other issues (e.g. an economic crisis). The fol-\nlowing quote supports this interpretation:\nWhat happens in crisis, journalists start being, they start working together with the\nauthorities. Because it is a little bit like you are not a nurse, but the law says that if you see\nsomebody is dying out in the street, you have to help. Otherwise, you could be prosecuted.\nAnd the same kind of thinking, I think, works that if something is really life-threatening,\nthen you have some kind of obligation to start telling people how we can avoid a bigger\ncrisis. (Interviewee 7)\nIn more acute crises, interviewees' willingness to disseminate authorities' messages\nalso tends to grow, at times notwithstanding own concerns. A crucial episode illustrating\nthis was the Swine flu pandemic. A shared narrative among many interviewees \u00ad particu-\nlarly Finnish \u00ad concerned their support of authorities' vaccination campaigns despite\nown concerns about vaccine safety. For example, one journalist related how she con-\nsciously decided not to publish stories about children suffering from Narcolepsy (a com-\nmonly assumed side-effect) in order to not create, potentially unwarranted, fear of\nvaccination. Eventually, however, safety concerns materialized and some journalists\nreported negative feelings \u00ad regret or even guilt \u00ad about their own responsibility and their\ndecision to support official vaccination recommendations.\nOverall, few interviewees reflected critically on the increased co-operation with\nauthorities in crisis times. One journalist criticized that some journalists `shout along'\nwith governments' appeals for vaccinations (Interviewee 14); another criticized that\njournalists often `blindly follow that which someone burbles', which effectively lets\nauthorities `have complete partners in the media, because they print everything'\n(Interviewee 22). That being said, it becomes evident that co-operation must not nec-\nessarily preclude critical stances, the latter serving as a shield for preserving inde-\npendence. Working in partnership with authorities \u00ad aligning interests and adopting\nthe goals of authorities \u00ad is a disputed issue, particularly regarding its exact bounda-\nries. In this sense, the term partnership is a stronger one than that of co-operation,\ndenoting a reduction in independence or agency. The divergence of opinions among\nour interviewees is illustrated by the following quotes, representing the most extreme\npositions:\nI am not the partner that merrily sits together in the crisis offices and says [she switches to the\nperspective of the officials], `Alright, we are assigning roles now and you, calm down your\nreaders a little bit and make sure to write more stories that they get vaccinated more now. We\nmight perhaps somehow sneak some information to you, and you will get it in a preprocessed\nform'. And this surely is the wishful thinking of many stakeholders, but is in outright\ncontradiction to the journalistic self-image. (Interviewee 22)\nIn contrast, another journalist described such a scenario as best case, which as she\nstated may involve withholding information that is perceived as non-beneficial for the\npublic. She continued,\nAt best \u00ad and it also nicely works out like this in 70% of cases \u00ad at the beginning, the right\npersons talk with each other and then you jointly contemplate what you will do. (Interviewee 17)\nWe found that journalists' co-operation is, besides being driven by a perception of\nshared goals and general trust in authorities, intertwined with a dependence on health\nauthorities, as an editor's comment illustrates,\n[W]e are not medical researchers ourselves, we cannot take the microscope and try to (laughing),\nyou really need to just somehow trust certain authorities or just try to get as many authoritative\nopinions as you can. And if they all point to one direction then you just really don't have\nanother choice than to try to trust them. But that's always the problem in this kind of medical\nnews because you really can't do the research yourself. In political news, if you have time you\ncan. (Interviewee 11)\nThe influence of professional characteristics on role\nperformance\nSaari et al., 1998), we uncovered differences between general and specialist reporters.\nRegarding the public mobilizer role, specialists in our sample generally expressed a\nstronger health-oriented mission: they were more likely to emphasize health education,\npromoting self-protective behaviours and influencing public opinion. Specialist report-\ners tended also towards more co-operation with health authorities, which is plausible,\ngiven their stronger public mobilizer role and thus naturally more aligned goals with\nhealth officials. Additionally, specialist reporters in our sample reported having closer\ncontact with health authorities and experts, felt treated `better' \u00ad more trusted, and taken\nseriously \u00ad and enjoyed privileged access during hectic crisis times. For example, one\njournalist commented on crisis coverage:\nThen it becomes sometimes more difficult to talk to people that are important for us (...) They\nare suddenly `overrun' and they are not allowed to comment anymore (...) Although, for us as\nscience journalists it really is, by and large, not too bad. You can still get good contact with the\nscientists. Usually, we also already have this contact established. (Interviewee 21)\nYet, specialist reporters were also particularly protective of their independence and\nare more critical towards the veracity of research findings or expert information.\nFurthermore, similar to Conrad (1999), we identified differences in the use of\nsources between general reporters and specialists. Specialist reporters in our sample\nmentioned two responsibilities not mentioned by general reporters. First, they stressed\ngathering multiple, independent opinions rather than passing on information from a\nsingle authority. Second, they emphasized the need for identifying those with relevant\nexpertise rather than the more common practice of interviewing those that, as one\ninterviewee put it, `talk into every microphone' \u00ad those who are eager to engage with\nmedia but lack robust credentials relevant to the specific issue. One interviewee illus-\ntrated this as follows:\nI sometimes try to explain this to colleagues of the feuilleton. Although I think, I wouldn't just\ncall any museum director, but surely the one for Renaissance art, for antique art, right? Surely,\nI would search for the expert. And the same way it needs to be done in science, without fail.\nIdentifying those with relevant expertise rather than just `an expert' may include hav-\ning to read experts'scientific publications, crosschecking credentials, searching archives:\na demanding, time-consuming task. In general, specialists relied more on scientific pub-\nlications and archives as sources, and several commented on how \u00ad if consulting journals\n\u00ad health crisis reporting could have been substantially improved.\nFinally, specialist reporters in our sample tended to understand and frame the crisis\nbased on their experience with earlier crisis, or in comparison with other risks. They\nplaced stronger emphasis on giving interpretation, especially by classifying risks or illus-\ntrating its proportion to other events:\nThe role for us as science journalists, if the cold crisis turns into a hot one, you are often more\nsomeone who sees the whole issue in relation to other problems that exist. (Interviewee 21)\nSeveral of the interviewed specialist reporters described how they, as science or medi-\ncal reporters, tend to be the `sober voice', or have a more factual approach to health crisis\nnews compared to general news or local news departments. The following quote exem-\nplifies this:\nThose of us who are responsible for medical topics are always like `ok, no panic, let's stay calm\nhere. Careful'. (Interviewee 14)\nAnother journalist commented that specialist reporters tend to try to exert an influence\non the news agenda and other departments' reporting during health crisis events:\nYou attempt to have an influence on the editorial office, as a first thing, and well, keep news\nreporting as factual as possible in that moment. So, this story where the unemployment agency\nhere was locked down, there was somehow an element of panic involved. Now we have the first\ncase of Ebola in Berlin. Then the adrenalin among the reporters goes up anyway because you\nthink `God, now this is it'. And in this state of adrenalin, if you then write, well then sometimes\nthings also happen. But then, well, for starters you try to feed in neutral information \u00ad it does\nnot transmit that easily, it is not airborne. (Interviewee 18)\nFurthermore, the reporter described how the relation between different editorial\noffices within a newspaper can be delicate during health crises. On the one hand, edito-\nrial departments sometimes believe that specialists simply want to underplay the impor-\ntance of a topic. On the other hand, specialists are consulted to contribute to the reporting\nof other departments because of their expertise.\nHaving experienced multiple health crises, and understanding risks and transmis-\nsion modes, specialist reporters thus seem less easily perturbed and take a special\nrole within their news organizations. This fits the findings of Henderson and\nKitzinger's (2007) analysis of the coverage of human-genetics research, that special-\nist reporters saw new discoveries in greater perspective, and were more cautious not\nto `overhype'.\nIn comparison to specialists, general reporters have a wider focus, and assume a more\nneutral role in health crisis coverage. They highlighted their role of disseminating offi-\ncial information, particularly `how-to-act' messages. Moreover, they emphasized the\nhumanitarian aspect of health crises, particularly general ethics (preventing stigma, rac-\nism). Both groups of professionals felt similar responsibility to protect or warn people.\nOverall, the observed differences mostly lie in their focus: a narrower, in-depth versus a\nwider perspective.\nDiscussion\nThis study set out to explore at its base level how journalists understand their roles in the\ncontext of health crisis reporting, and as a wider goal whether situational and profes-\nsional characteristics initiate role shifts among journalists. Our findings resonate with\nfindings by Hooker et al. (2012) that journalists experience role conflicts between\nremaining independent and feeling responsible for supporting public interest, when cov-\nering public health crises. The present study extended earlier findings by identifying role\nshifts and an additional role that comes to the fore in health crisis coverage: a public\nmobilizer role.\nFor existing frameworks on role perceptions, the present findings implicate that despite\ncertain continuities in the roles journalists adopt regardless of context of reporting, situa-\ntional context does matter in terms of how journalists prioritize and interpret these roles.\nOf particular importance is the substantial re-interpretation of the public mobilizer role,\naway from encouraging democratic debate or giving a voice to ordinary citizens, to one of\nmobilizing the public as individuals to take appropriate actions. This demonstrates the\nmerit of studying journalists' professional ideology in specific contexts, as a complement\nto existing research that focuses on current affairs and political reporting. In addition, the\nfinding on the particular role of specialists shows that besides situational also professional\ncharacteristics influence interpretation of roles and role performance.\nFor the quality of health crisis news and crisis management, the present findings have\nseveral implications. The observed role shifts towards a public mobilizer role and\ntowards co-operation with authorities carry potential benefits and dangers. Co-operation\nbetween media and emergency managers can strongly benefit the success of crisis miti-\ngation measures (for an example, see Veil and Ojeda, 2010). Indeed, the usual tendency\nof mass media `to be highly critical of government response to emergencies' can be\ncounterproductive (Veil, 2012: 291). Too fervent criticism in a role as watchdog might\nundermine or obstruct authorities' crisis relief efforts. But increased co-operation also\ncarries dangers. Some health journalism scholars have warned journalists of becoming\nmere `mouthpieces' of health authorities (Schwitzer et al., 2005). One of our interview-\nees voiced accusations that authorities misuse journalists' fear to misreport:\nThe media get taken as partners, because somehow the media do not dare, with the subject\nvaccination they are insanely careful. (Interviewee 22)\nIn principle, the authority \u00ad journalist relationship \u00ad can thus go both directions. As\nVeil (2012) puts it, `the emergency managers can be perceived to be engaging in media\nmanipulation, or altruistically helping the journalist protect the public'. For journalistic\npractice, this means it is critical that journalists maintain a critical perspective. The com-\nplexity of health crises and immense pressure to report fast make this exceptionally dif-\nficult, which is why experienced specialist reporters are so crucial.\nA valid question to raise is in how far journalists can actually challenge health author-\nities. As Berkowitz (2009) contends, the classic vision of autonomous watchdogs does\nnot match the reality of news reporting. Rather, in most cases, `journalists cannot truly\nchallenge news sources', as their interpretation of events is beforehand constrained by\nnorms of the workplace \u00ad `the preferred meanings of their media organization, their news\nsources, and their geographic community's power structure' (Berkowitz and TerKeurst,\nSpecialist reporters could play a special role in remedying some of these challenges\nof health crisis coverage. They are more capable to withstand pressures and juggle dif-\nferent roles: endorsing a role as co-operative and being better connected with public\nhealth officials/experts, while critically evaluating facts or scientific findings, identify-\ning sources with relevant expertise and providing frames to understand the `bigger pic-\nture'. Moreover, the finding that specialist reporters emphasize classifying risks/\ntreatments in context has implications for the quality of reporting. News stories have\nbeen criticized as superficial, lacking contextual information that shows how new infor-\nmation relates to a more comprehensive understanding of a situation (Lowrey et al.,\n2007; Schwitzer et al., 2005). Finally, our findings demonstrate that specialist reporters\nmight play a unique role in alleviating one of the key concerns about health crisis report-\ning: fear-mongering (e.g. Dunwoody and Peters, 1992; Shuchman and Wilkes, 1997).\nSpecialists appear to be `sober voices' within their news organization that view events,\nsuch as disease outbreaks, in a wider context.\nThis raises serious concerns considering decreasing numbers of specialist reporters in\nduring the past years, `newsroom budgets for training have been slashed' (p. 362).\nResultantly, media organizations lack reporters with sufficient scientific knowledge of\nissues such as emerging infectious diseases (Lowrey et al., 2006). Science issues are\noften covered in `in a cursory manner by general assignment reporters responding to\npress releases', who are unlikely to be able to cover such events critically (Saari et al.,\nto more news being covered with lesser reporters, and an increased commercialization of\nnews, giving audiences what they want, rather than what they need (McManus, 2009).\nIndependent initiatives developing training programmes or manuals for health crisis\nreporting (e.g. by the Nieman Foundation for Journalism) and independent platforms\ngathering and critically investigating in-depth information on current health issues freely\navailable to journalists (e.g. the German `medien-doktor.de') gain importance.\nHowever, a core limitation of the present study is that it is based on self-reports and thus\nvulnerable to (intentional or unintentional) misrepresentations of journalistic reality. Our\nchoice of self-reports was driven by our research interest \u00ad self-perceived roles. However,\nfurther research is needed to compare self-perceptions with actual role performance, such\nas through ethnographic studies or combinations of interviews with analyses of news con-\ntent. Also, as this study focused on infectious disease outbreaks or food safety crises, the\ngeneralizability of findings to other types of health crises needs to be examined.\nPractical implications: Journalistic roles and expectations from external\nstakeholders\nIt appears that the reality of health crises coverage is less dire than may be feared based\non common media criticisms. Journalists seem to accept many of the voiced expectations\nfrom external stakeholders as legitimate parts of their professional self-image. As urged\nby scholars, they express commitment to contextual reporting, and adopt a role as health\neducators (Schwitzer, 2004; Schwitzer et al., 2005). The public mobilizer role relates to\na core expectation of authorities \u00ad impacting public health to the better. Furthermore,\nmany journalists expressed willingness to act as disseminators of authorities' messages\nto the public, and as co-operatives in crisis management efforts (Holmes, 2008; Reynolds\nand Seeger, 2005). The fact that journalists emphasize providing mobilizing information\n(how-to-act) promises positive implications for health crisis management because stud-\nies show that mobilizing information fosters individuals' readiness to engage in precau-\nConclusion\nWhile universals exist, health crisis coverage also involves particulars in the way roles\nare prioritized and interpreted in light of situational and professional characteristics. This\nunderscores the importance of not merely focusing on political contexts in journalism\nstudies but equally considering specific contexts. Specialist expertise emerged as a key\nvariable enabling enactment of the roles identified in this study and the fulfilment of\nexpectations from scholars and health officials. Seeing shrinking numbers of specialist\nreporters in media organizations, this raises serious concerns and calls for a re-evaluation\nof the importance of specialist reporters in the industry.\n"
