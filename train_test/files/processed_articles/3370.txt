The first of\nthese is the study by Adamopoulos et al.,20 who performed\na preliminary exploratory analysis of the Eplerenone Post-\nAMI Heart Failure Efficacy and Survival (EPHESUS) trial.\nThis study demonstrated that an earlier aldosterone block-\nade improved outcome in patients with HF, and this benefit\nwas not observed when the aldosterone receptor antagonist\n(ARA) was initiated later. The other study is by Hayashi et\nal.,21 who found that the treatment with MRAs within 24\nhours after an AMI may prevent post-infarct LV remode-\nling. However, there is no information concerning how the\nbeneficial effect of aldosterone inhibition relates to the tim-\ning of MRA initiation in the specific population of patients\nsuffering a first episode of decompensated congestive HF.\nUsing the database of our hospital, we selected a homog-\nenous cohort of consecutive patients in order to study the\nassociation between time of MRAinitiation (within the first\n90 days after hospital discharge) and mortality in patients\nwith HF discharged alive after a first episode of decompen-\nsated congestive HF. Risk of mortality was computed com-\nparing patients who initiated MRAs at discharge (early\ngroup), who we postulate to be advantaged, and those who\ninitiated MRAs one months later, up to 90 days after dis-\ncharge (delayed group).\nSubjects and methods\nStudy cohort\nEligible patients were residents of the Province of Modena,\nwho were discharged alive from the Modena Policlinico\nHospital after a first episode of decompensated congestive\nwere available for these patients until April 2011.\n\"MRA users\" (see definition below) who were dis-\ncharged alive from their first hospitalization for decompen-\nsated congestive HF were included. Patients were excluded\nif they met  one of the following conditions: (1) presence\nof severe comorbidities (significant renal impairment\n(defined as reduction of the glomerular filtration rate, cal-\nculated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equa-\nage  85 years. These two groups of patients were frail and\nlikely to have a short life expectancy, which may have\nobscured the effect of treatments; and (3) a total length of\nhospital stay  three days.\nPatients who filled a prescription of an MRA  90 days\nafter discharge were identified as \"MRA users.\" Those who\nhad a prescription dispensed at discharge formed the \"early\ngroup,\" and those who filled a prescription 30 to 90 days\nafter discharge formed the \"delayed group.\"\nThe study outcome was defined as mortality due to any\ncause. All patients were followed for the earliest occur-\nrence of death or one year after discharge.\nData source\nData were obtained from the general database of our hospi-\ntal, which contains information concerning hospital admis-\nsions, discharge reports, inpatient physician encounters,\nand dispensed medications. Prescription information\nincludes type of medication and dispensed dose.\nDeath information was obtained from the Modena pro-\nvincial registry office.\nDetailed information on patients' baseline characteris-\ntics, including medication and doses, was recorded at dis-\ncharge (baseline).\nBaseline characteristics\nGeneral information, including patients' age, gender, and\nco-morbidity, was noted at discharge. Concurrent use of\nmajor cardiac medications was recorded for beta blockers,\nnitrates, diuretics, warfarin, digoxin, ACE-Is, ARBs, and\nMRAs. In addition, data included: date of cardiac proce-\ndures after the index hospital admission (catheterization,\npercutaneous coronary intervention, or coronary artery\nbypass grafting), and length of hospital stay.\nPrescription time distribution matching\nBy definition, patients in the delayed group survived at\nleast the first month and up to 90 days, whereas patients in\nthe early group may have had an event any time after dis-\ncharge. Although the risk of death is higher after discharge,\nan excessive amount of early events is expected to occur in\nthe early group. This systematic difference in time to treat-\nment initiation may result in biased estimates if not cor-\nrected for either at the design or analysis level. To address\nthis between-group survival difference, we used the method\nof prescription time distribution matching to define time of\nstudy entry (T0). The method considered the dispensing\ndate of the first MRA prescription (the date of post-\ndischarge visit) was considered to be the time of study entry\nof the delayed users. Early users were assigned a T0 that\nwas selected at random from the observed prescription time\ndistribution of the delayed users. Those who died before the\nassigned T0 were excluded. The two groups were then fol-\nlowed from their respective T0 values, and onward.\nStatistical analyses\nDescriptive statistics were used to compare baseline patient\ncharacteristics between groups.\nTo exclude the possibility that the delayed users were\nlate to fill the prescription because they underwent more\npost-discharge procedures or hospital readmissions, we\nexamined the period between discharge and matched pre-\nscription time for rates of cardiac procedures (percutaneous\ncoronary intervention, coronary artery bypass grafting, and\ncatheterization) and hospital admissions for congestive HF.\nSurvival in the two groups was displayed by a Kaplan\u00ad\nMeier curve. A multivariate Cox's regression model was\nused to obtain the hazard ratio (HR) of mortality between\nthe delayed (reference) and early groups after adjusting for\nbaseline characteristics. Mortality hazards were evaluated\nat six months and at one year after discharge.\nA p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nResults\nCohort and baseline characteristics\nIn our cohort, 689 consecutive patients filled an MRA pre-\nscription during the first 90 days after discharge. Of these,\nprescription at discharge (early group), and 320 patients\n(delayed group).\nAfter matching on study entry between the early and\ndelayed users, the early group had an assigned T0 distribu-\ntion identical to that of the delayed users (median: 55 days;\ninterquartile range: 40 to 72 years). There were four sub-\njects who were excluded from the early group because they\ndied before their assigned T0.\nA comparison between early and delayed users after pre-\nscription time distribution matching showed similar demo-\ngraphic and clinical characteristics (Table 1). Also, as\nregards the type and dose of the prescribed drugs, we did\nnot note any significant difference. Specifically, types and\ndose of prescribed MRAs are summarized in Table 2.\nPatients did not significantly differ in terms of types and\ndose of prescribed MRAs.\nTreatment rates after discharge and up to\nmatched prescription time\nThere was no difference in the rates of post-discharge cardiac\nproceduresandhospitaladmissionsuptomatchedT0between\nthe early and delayed groups. For post-discharge cardiac pro-\ncedures, rates in the early and delayed groups were 9% and\n10%, respectively (p = 0.32).

Compared with a delay in MRA initiation, early users\nshow a significant difference in mortality compared with\ndelayed users during the first year after discharge. Based on\nthe survival curve, a delay of only one month in the admin-\nistration of an MRA implies approximately a doubling of\nmortality risk after one year. This aspect may be important\nfrom a practical point of view, because even the most recent\nguidelines do not provide guidance regarding how early to\nstart MRA treatment after hospitalization for congestive\nHF. The present study provides a clear indication for use of\nMRAs as early as possible, on top of the treatment (includ-\ning ACE-I or ARB and beta-blocker), preferably at dis-\ncharge after an episode of decompensate HF.\nThe reason to define delayed use as one month to 90 days\nin the present study is threefold. First, this is determined by\nthe actual prescription pattern. The first 90-day period cap-\ntured practically all the first MRA prescriptions in the year\nafter discharge.22 Second, the highest risk of readmission\nand death occurs during the first month after discharge.23,24\nThird, the EPHESUS trial suggests that earlier eplerenone\nadministration improved outcomes in patients with HF, that\nthis benefit was not demonstrated when eplerenone was ini-\ntiated later,20 and that the reduction in mortality from any\ncause was apparent within the first 30 days of randomiza-\ntion.25 Therefore, it is important, in our opinion, to examine\nthe effect on mortality as a result of an initiation delay  one\nmonth compared with initiation at discharge.\nPathophysiological effects of aldosterone and\n\"aldosterone escape\" in congestive heart failure\nMineralocorticoid antagonism attenuates cardiovascular\ndamage by mechanisms that involve direct blockade of\naldosterone's cardiovascular pro-inflammatory and pro-\nfibrotic effects.26 Aldosterone induces fibrosis in the heart,\nblood vessels, and kidney,25 and the antagonism of miner-\nalocorticoid receptors has been associated with reduced\nfibrosis in human myocardium, limited ventricular remod-\neling, and improved survival in patients with ventricular\ndysfunction and heart failure.14,25\u00ad28 Our results suggest a\ngreater benefit in terms of survival if MRA treatment is\nstarted as early as possible.\n122 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(1)\nTable 1.

Increasingly, it is\nbecoming evident that following an acute fall in aldoster-\none in response to administration of an ACE-I, the level of\naldosterone rises again, and indeed returns to baseline in\nalmost all patients, a phenomenon known as \"aldosterone\ntion with an ARB, aldosterone levels remain uncon-\ntrolled.34,35 Additionally, there is evidence that aldosterone\nescape, in turn, might promote release of angiotensin II via\na positive feedback loop that stimulates ACE in the vascu-\nlature.36 This, and the progressive escape of aldosterone,\nare thought to contribute to \"ACE-I resistance,\" whereby\nthe effect of ACE-I becomes blunted, and beneficial effects\non mortality decrease over time.37,38 The results of our\nstudy allow us to postulate that the escape phenomenon\noccurs rapidly in patients who have had an episode of\ndecompensated congestive HF. MRAs, in turn, are able to\nantagonize the deleterious effects of aldosterone, resulting\nin a beneficial effect, ultimately, on patient mortality.\nARAs utilized in the present study\nWhile in the United States the most widely used MRA is\nrepresented by spironolactone, in Italy canrenone and\npotassium canrenoate are also used.\nPotassium canrenoate is a competitive non-selective\ninhibitor of aldosterone receptor; its pharmacologic activity\nis due to a rapid conversion to canrenone, which is the active\nmetabolite of potassium canrenoate and spironolactone.39\nPotassium canrenoate is rapidly and completely absorbed\nfrom the gastrointestinal tract and bypasses the liver\nunchanged. Canrenone and canrenoate are in enzymatic\nequilibrium in vivo, in which canrenoate represents the\nderived -hydroxycarboxylic acid.40 The bioavailability and\nwater solubility of potassium canrenoate and canrenone are\ngreater than those of spironolactone; therefore the number\nof active metabolites of the latter is considerably greater.40\nIn Italy eplerenone, a selective aldosterone receptor\nblocker, is not commercially available. All of the aldoster-\none inhibitors used in the present study are, in consequence,\nnot selective.\nIn Italy, overall, MRAs are little used: In 2011 the mean\nnumber of doses of MRAs consumed daily by 1000 inhab-\nitants was 3.5, a very small quantity compared with 88.5\nretics, and 6.0 of thiazide diuretics.41 However, the present\nstudy is indicative of current clinical practices in a large\nItalian referral center. Our group, together with other refer-\nral Italian centers, is part of the AREA-in-CHF network, a\nresearch group that demonstrated in patients with HF posi-\ntive effects of canrenone in preventing LV remodeling28\nand in improving myocardial mechano-energetic\nFigure 1. Cumulative one-year mortality in patients with a first episode of decompensated heart failure among \"early\" and\n\"delayed\" users of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists.\n124 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(1)\nStrengths and limitations of the study\nThe strengths of the present study are: first, the homogene-\nous cohort of patients; and second, the primary end-point of\nthe study, represented by mortality from any cause. This is\nuniversally accepted as the strongest end-point in prognos-\ntic studies.\nDespite appropriate design and analyses, this study has\nseveral limitations. First, the study is prone to biases\nbecause of its observational nature. Although the bias that\nresults from confounding by indication is minor, because\nall patients are MRA users, there are likely uncharacterized\nfactors that may confound the timing of initiation. Some of\nthem could be related to clinical practice and patient dis-\nease severity, which could obscure the possible benefit\nassociated with early MRA initiation. Despite adjustment\nfor a wide spectrum of characteristics, it is possible to have\nresidual confounding in the comparisons. Second, survival\nbias in the comparison of early versus delayed MRA initia-\ntion may affect the validity of the results. We controlled for\nthis bias by matching the time of study entry between the\ntwo groups using prescription time distribution matching.\nHowever, due to matching, we could not study the effect in\nthe first month. Third, our study is limited by the data and\nclinical practice during the study period, although patients\nwere similar with regard to types of prescribed MRA and\nused dosages.\nConclusions\nIn patients suffering from HF, a delay of MRA initiation up\nto 30 days after discharge implies a significant increase in\nmortality compared with MRA initiation at discharge after\na first episode of decompensated congestive HF. Subsequent\nstudies, preferably randomized, should confirm these find-\nings. However, on the basis of the results of our study, it\nseems reasonable to suggest from a clinical point of view\nthat patients with HF in whom there is a clear indication to\nuse an MRA, should have the possibility of starting this\ntreatment as soon as possible.\nConflict of interest\nNone declared.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any funding\nagency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
