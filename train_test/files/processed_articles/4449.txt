According to a popular family of hypotheses, crossmodal matches between distinct\nfeatures hold because they correspond to the same polarity on several conceptual dimensions (such\nas active\u00adpassive, good\u00adbad, etc.) that can be identified using the semantic differential technique.\nThe main problem here resides in turning this hypothesis into testable empirical predictions.

The results highlight that the semantic hypothesis cannot easily explain\ndifferences in the prevalence of crossmodal associations built on the same semantic pattern (fast\nlemons, slow prunes, sour boulders, heavy red); furthermore, the semantic hypothesis only minimally\npredicts what happens when the semantic dimensions and polarities that are supposed to drive\nsuch crossmodal associations are made more salient (e.g., by adding emotional cues that ought to\nmake the good/bad dimension more salient); finally, the semantic hypothesis does not explain why\nreliable matches are no longer observed once intramodal dimensions with congruent connotations\nare presented (e.g., visually presented shapes and colour do not appear to correspond).\n",

Initially, such intuitive cross-\nmodal matches often strike us as surprising, not to say arbitrary. When, for example, people are asked\nto match non-words like \"Takete\" or \"Kiki,\" and \"Maluma\" or \"Bouba\" to angular and rounded shapes\nand \"Kiki\" to the angular shape, and \"Maluma\" and \"Bouba\" to the rounded one. When asked which\ncolour is heavier, red or yellow, people consistently tend to say that red is the heavier of the two\n(Alexander & Shansky, 1976); they also intuitively associate brighter surfaces with higher pitched\nsounds, and darker ones with lower pitched sounds (Ludwig, Adachi, & Matzuzawa, 2011; see also\nOne obvious limitation with many of these subjective questions, tested on only a limited number\nof participants, is that they do not reveal what drives/underlies the crossmodal matches. Over the years,\nseveral different explanations have been put forward, including the popular semantic hypothesis inspired\nby work on the semantic differential technique popularized by Osgood, Suci, and Tannenbaum (1957; see\nFast lemons and sour boulders: Testing crossmodal\ncorrespondences using an internet-based testing methodology\n366 Woods A T, Spence C, Butcher N, Deroy O\nalso Osgood, 1960; Snider & Osgood, 1969). The idea here is that the presented objects are categorized\nalong a certain number of common dimensions (such as active/passive; good/bad; dominant/submissive,\netc.) and match if they fall in the same dimensional region as one another along some number of these\ndimensions. For instance, bright and high pitch are both \"active,\" and therefore considered as more intui-\ntively congruent than bright and low pitch. A similar hypothesis has also been adopted very recently by\nWalker and Walker (2012) and defended, albeit without commitment to specific conceptual dimensions,\nThe lack of specificity, and the plurality of dimensions at stake, makes it feasible to criticize the\nsemantic hypothesis as being possibly rather ad hoc: It is, after all, possible to find a common feature\nfor any two objects one can think of, and then reconstruct it as the dimension that governed their\nmatching. It is also possible that the participants in such studies may try to guess what sort of con-\nceptual association the experimenter(s) had in mind when selecting a series of stimuli, making the\neffect an artifact of the forced-choice task more than the test of a pre-existing intuition (e.g., Pratt,\n1990; Waterman, Blades, & Spencer, 2000). The goal of the present study was therefore to explore\nways in which the semantic hypothesis could be put to the test empirically.\nA first test here, inspired by the title of an article by Brown (1958), was to find some crossmodal\nmatches which are semantically sound, and yet do not give rise to consistent intuitions. In the title of\nhis review of Osgood et al.'s (1957) book on the semantic differential technique, Brown, for instance,\nconsidered the prosaic nature of a question like \"Is a boulder sweet or sour?\" Here, we tested the\ngenerality of this, and other crossmodal correspondences (such as that lemons are fast and that red\nis heavier than yellow), by utilizing an internet-based testing methodology which was trialed on the\noccasion of this study. We also tested a number of other similar associations involving non-relative\nor qualitative features such as \"sweet\u00adsour\" that have frequently been endorsed in the literature (i.e.,\nthat lemons are fast and that red is heavier than yellow) to see whether the kind of effect obtained\nwith boulders would generalize to these other cases. Similarly, we tested several other associations\nwith selected features (sharp vs. round; red vs. yellow; rough vs. soft) that were already assigned a\nplace on specific semantic dimensions by previous researchers/experiments to see whether or not\nthey would generate intuitive matches that would be consistent with the semantic hypothesis.\nA related prediction, which the defenders of the semantic hypothesis have not explicitly explored\nat this point, concerns intramodal correspondences: If all objects and features can be categorized\naccording to certain common dimensions, and if any two features associated with the same pole on a\ngiven dimension should be matched by participants--this should happen regardless of whether those\nfeatures are taken from the same versus different sensory modality. In this sense, one would expect\npeople to match active \"angular\" to active \"yellow\" or \"rough\" within the visual modality, as much as\nthey match active \"up\" and \"high pitch\" across modalities (e.g., across vision, audition, and touch; see\nA final inference that can be drawn from the semantic hypothesis would appear to be that features\nthat are easier to place in terms of certain crucial semantic dimensions (such as active/passive; good/\nbad; dominant/submissive) should lead to more frequent or confident matches by participants. For\ninstance, one can think that the success of the Bouba/Kiki effect (e.g., Bremner et al., 2013; K\u00f6hler,\nfigures are easy to place on a scale that is anchored by the labels \"passive\" and \"active\" or \"bad\" and\n\"good.\" Here, we tested whether participants would find this placing easier (i.e., more intuitive) by\nadding cues of the same polarity to the shape (such as adding cues like \"happy\" to the sharp shape,\nto make it more active, dominant, and good) or more difficult by adding cues going in the opposite\ndirection (such as sad to the sharp shape, to make it less active, dominant, or good). In the present\nstudy, we tested these three hypotheses in a block of trials using a randomized internet testing method,\nfirst in an English-speaking environment that was highly controlled (Experiment 1), and then in a\nmuch broader selection of participants from different parts of the world in a somewhat less controlled\nmanner (Experiment 2), in order to examine any differences that might be attributable to a partici-\npant's prior linguistic or cultural exposure (Eitan & Timmers, 2010). The consequences of the results\nobtained here for the semantic explanation of crossmodal matches are discussed below.\n2 Experiment 1: Crossmodal matches and semantic dimensions\nIn Experiment 1, we tested three sets of predictions related to the semantic hypothesis of crossmodal\nmatching. First, we were interested in determining whether certain matches that would challenge this\nCrossmodal correspondences 367\nexplanation also existed--primarily those involving qualitative (that is, metathetic, see Smith & Sera,\nobjects like boulders or fruits. Second, we wanted to test whether those features associated with the\nsame polarity on specific dimensions would also be associated intramodally (e.g., shape and colours;\ncolours and visually displayed textures). Third, we examined whether adding cues that made a certain\npolarity more salient on a particular semantically relevant dimension (e.g., happy for active sharpness)\nwould lead to more confident or faster responding by participants on a classical crossmodal matching\ntask (\"Bouba\u00adKiki\" being matched with round\u00adangular shapes; Bremner et al., 2013; K\u00f6hler, 1929,\nMethods\nParticipants\nEighty-one undergraduate students (71 female and 10 male) from York St. John University (UK) vol-\nunteered to take part in this study as part of a first year practical class. The participants ranged in age\nfrom 18 to 32 years (mean of 19.4 years). All of the participants provided informed consent prior to the\nstudy and the experimental protocol was approved by the University Ethics Committee. Participants\nreported their country of origin as United Kingdom (80) and Ireland (1). The average time taken to\ncomplete the study was 425 seconds (standard deviation 72 seconds).\nStimuli\nText descriptors and images were used as stimuli. The participants always had two response options\n(either text- or image-based) for each of the stimuli that were presented. The stimuli consisted of a\nsubset presented in one configuration only (\"boulder,\" \"heavier,\" \"prune,\" \"yellow\") and a subset of\nstimuli (blob, star, rectangle) that were varied parametrically across three factors (shape, colour, emo-\ntion; e.g., a blob that is red and has a smiley face). The stimuli and their possible response options\navailable to participants are shown in Figure 1. We selected a variety of non-words that have been\nshown to correspond to \"Bouba\" (Bouba, Maluma, Lomoro, Mamima, Muromu, Malomu) and \"Kiki\"\n(Kiki, Takete, Kiriki, Teziki, Kichiki, Kekiti) in previous studies of sound symbolism (see Nielsen &\nRendall, 2011). These non-words were chosen randomly from each list as needed (one randomly cho-\nsen word from each list was presented five times and the remaining words six times each). The stimuli\nApparatus\nThe participants completed the experiment in one of four lab classes on PC computers. The\nexperiment was conducted on the internet through the Adobe Flash based Xperiment software\n(http://www.xperiment.mobi downloaded on 15/10/12). Testing was conducted in parallel on a\nnumber of computers in the psychology laboratory. The monitor resolution was set at 1,024 3 768\nand had a screen size of 38.1 cm, corner to corner. All of the stimuli were clearly visible, each filling\napproximately 15% of the screen.\nDesign\nA repeated measures design was used with all of the participants undertaking all of the experimental\ntrials. The dependent variables were the response chosen (two possibilities), the reaction time (RT),\nand the confidence rating.\nProcedure\nThe procedure was explained verbally to the participants by the experimenter and, at the start of the\nstudy, by means of an illustration (see Figure 2). The participants were instructed to follow the instruc-\ntions that were presented on the screen, to remain quiet after completing the study, and to initiate the\nstudy when they were ready. All of the experimental trials followed the same procedure. A question\nmark was always presented in the centre of the screen for the duration of each trial. The test stimulus\nwas positioned immediately above the question mark. The participant dragged the test stimulus to one\nof the two possible response options displayed equidistant to the left and right of the midline in the\nlower half of the screen. This response was recorded automatically. Left- and right-option positioning\nwas randomized across trials and participants, as was the order in which the trials were presented. The\ntime from the appearance of the stimulus up until when the stimulus was \"dropped in place\" over a\n368 Woods A T, Spence C, Butcher N, Deroy O\ngiven response option by the participant was also recorded. Upon selecting a response, the participants\nwere asked \"How confident are you that other people will respond in the same way as you?\" The par-\nticipants made their responses on a five-point horizontal scale shown above the question mark with the\nfollowing options, arranged from left to right: \"very unconfident,\" \"unconfident,\" \"uncertain,\" \"confi-\ndent,\" \"very confident.\" After responding, a \"continue\" button appeared. Pressing this button cleared\nthe screen and initiated the next trial after a 500 ms pause. There were 35 trials per participant, which\ntook approximately 10 minutes to complete. After the completion of the study, all of the participants\nwere debriefed as to the nature of the study.\nFigure 1. Stimuli used in Experiment 1 together with the two response options. (a) The subset of stimuli was\npresented in a single configuration only (no parametric variation); (b) the subset of stimuli that were parametrically\nvaried in terms of their shape, colour, and emotion.\nFigure 2.

Boulders were 3.50 times more likely to be labelled\nassociation between the colour descriptor chosen (\"pink\" or \"red\") for shape (circle, triangle), and the\nmaterial-image (rough, smooth) chosen for shape.\nParticipants' confidence ratings were recoded numerically. A \"very confident\" response was\nassigned a value of 4, while a \"very unconfident\" response was assigned a value of 0; intermediate rat-\nings were assigned appropriate intermediate values. In the subsequent analyses, confidence was used\nas the dependent variable. An ANOVA with shape (circle or triangle) as a repeated-measures factor and\nmaterial-image (hard or soft) as a between-participants factor revealed a significant interaction term\nas \"soft\" than as \"hard\" (p , 0.05; respective means 2.61 and 2.14; in terms of count, the number of\nparticipants rating circles as \"soft\" was 38 and as \"hard\" was 43). There was also an interaction in an\nANOVA with fruit (lemon and prune) and fastness (\"slow\" and \"fast\") as factors, F(1, 158) 5 9.29,\np , 0.01, with prunes being more confidently rated by participants as \"slow\" than as \"fast\" (p , 0.05),\nwhilst lemons were more confidently rated as being \"fast\" than \"slow\" (p , 0.05). Finally, \"heavier\"\nFigure 3. (a) Bar graph showing participants' confidence ratings when allocating stimuli to the different descriptors\n(error bars 2 SEM).

The boulder, likewise,\nA log-linear analysis was performed, using text (\"Bouba\" and \"Kiki\") 3 shape (blob, rectangle,\nstar) 3 colour (red, white, yellow) 3 emotion (happy, neutral, sad) as the variables. The four-way\nlog-linear analysis produced a final model that retained the text 3 shape 3 colour and text 3 emo-\nprovided a good fit to the data. There was a trend effect for the text 3 shape 3 colour interaction,\ninteraction down, separate x\u00b2 tests were performed with each type of shape to determine whether they\nto the other (see Figure 4a). Odds ratios indicated that the rectangles and blob shapes were 1.81 and\n1.87 times more likely to be rated as \"Bouba\" than as \"Kiki,\" respectively. By contrast, the star was\n2.59 times more likely to be rated as \"Kiki\" (than as \"Bouba\"), explaining the original interaction and\nimplying a genuine difference in the descriptor chosen between the star and the other two shapes. No\nlower-order significant factors which interacted significantly in higher order effects are reported.\nThe text by emotion interaction was broken down in the same fashion as the previous text and\nshape interaction in order to determine whether there were any significant differences in the assign-\n1.45 times more likely to be rated as \"Bouba\" than as \"Kiki\" (see Figure 5a).\nA four-way between-participants ANOVA was conducted on the confidence rating data (note that\none data point was missing from this analysis). The factors consisted of the same independent vari-\nables as above. The interaction between text selected and shape was significant, F(2, 2,132) 5 21.18,\np , 0.001 (see Figure 4b). Post hoc LSD tests revealed that the participants were more confident in\nassigning the label \"Kiki\" than the label \"Bouba\" to the stars (p , 0.001), and, conversely, the label\n\"Bouba\" (rather than \"Kiki\") to the blobs (p , 0.001) and rectangles (p , 0.01).\nFigure 4.

Outlying data for RTs to stimuli reported as \"Bouba\" and\nthose reported as \"Kiki\" were screened separately and corrected for (,1% in both cases; outliers are\nhenceforth defined as exceeding \u00b13 standard deviations surrounding the mean, and henceforth cor-\nrected for by being replaced with the next most extreme but non-outlying data point). For \"single con-\nfiguration stimuli\" (Figure 1a), two two-way ANOVAs were conducted with log RT as the dependent\nvariable, a repeated-measures factor of stimulus (circle or triangle), and also a between-participants\nresponse factor of either pink/red or hard-/soft-material (see the bottom four rows in Figure 1a). Four\nindependent sample t-tests were also conducted in order to see whether stimulus (either \"heavier,\"\n\"boulder,\" \"lemon,\" \"prune\") were allocated more so to one response or to another (responses were\nrespectively \"red\"/\"yellow,\" \"sweet\"/\"sour,\" \"fast\"/\"slow\" and \"fast\"/\"slow\" again; see the top four\nrows in Figure 1a). There were no significant effects on log RT between allocations in those trials\nwith a circle, triangle, \"heavier,\" and \"boulder\" as the stimuli. There was a trend towards an effect\nassign \"lemons\" than to assign \"prunes\" (computed averages 3,038 and 2,529 ms, respectively). For\n\"parametrically varied\" stimuli (Figure 1b), a four-way between-participants ANOVA was conducted\nwith log RT as the dependent variable and shape, colour and emotion as independent variables.

This finding has been reported before (one explanation is that negative\nstimuli might be processed more slowly than positive and neutral stimuli to avoid potentially danger-\nDiscussion\nThe results of Experiment 1 can be divided into two parts: The re-testing of already documented\ncrossmodal matches, and the testing of new correspondences. Our results establish that boulders are\nassociated with sourness while prunes are associated with slowness. By contrast, no significant match-\ning pattern was found intramodally, that is, between shapes (circle/triangle) and texture (soft/round),\nor shapes and colour (red/pink)--although those participants who rated circles as soft were more con-\nfident of their choice than those who rated them as rough. Regarding those crossmodal matches that\nhave already been documented in the literature, our results are consistent with previous or expected\nFigure 5.

(b) Line graph showing RT (in ms) to assign happy,\nneutral, and sad stimuli as either \"Bouba\" or \"Kiki\"; error bars (2 SEM) were calculated for log RT but then\nreverted to normal scale via an inverse log function for ease of presentation.\n372 Woods A T, Spence C, Butcher N, Deroy O\nresults (such as the fastness of lemons, see Smith, 2012, and the heaviness of red or the attribution\nof \"Kiki\" to star-shaped figures). That said, our results also demonstrate that intermediate figures\n(rectangle with rounded corners) are rated as Bouba, and that, in some circumstances, emotional cues\ncan override the intuitive associations that exist between shapes and sounds, as sad faces embedded\nin either of the shapes have a tendency to be associated with \"Bouba.\" This result can be explained\nin terms of the semantic hypothesis by asserting that the sound \"Bouba\" is associated with passive\nstimuli and that sad faces are also more strongly associated with passivity than are shapes. However,\nthe same result underscores the risk of the ad hoc application of the semantic hypothesis: if \"Bouba\"\nis associated with the blobby shape, and the blobby shape can be described as good (or at least as less\nbad) than the spiky star shape, then it is rather surprising that \"Bouba\" is also associated with sad, i.e.,\nnegative emotions. No effect on the \"Bouba\"\u00ad\"Kiki\" matching was documented in the case of colour\n(red/yellow), also creating something of a tension for the semantic hypothesis: If the semantic dimen-\nsions attributed to \"Kiki\" are active and/or bad (explaining the matching with angularity), then one\nwould expect a match with \"red\" which is often recognized as alerting or enlivening (Elliot & Maier,\n3 Experiment 2: Crossmodal matches across linguistic borders\nIn a follow-up study, we tested whether the previous results could be attributed to cross-culturally\nsemantic dimensions that are common to all objects (as posited by the semantic hypothesis) and\nwhether they were universal as often assumed in the field of crossmodal correspondences (see Bremner\nMethods\nParticipants\nEighty-two individuals (39 female and 43 male) recruited from Amazon's Mechanical Turk took part\nonwards over a four-hour period (see Crump, McDonnell, & Gureckis, 2013, for a methodological\noverview).

To summarize, there\nwas little difference between the results of the two experiments. Once again, the results reported here\ndemonstrate that lemons and prunes differed in terms of the allocation to the labels \"fast\" and \"slow,\"\np , 0.01. In terms of the odds ratios (see Figure 7), lemons were 1.56 times more likely to be labelled\nas \"fast\" than as \"slow\" (respective counts 50, 32), whilst prunes were 1.93 times more likely to be\nlabelled as \"slow\" than as \"fast\" (54, 28).

This result\ntherefore confirms that people really do tend to associate boulders with \"sour,\" \"heavy\" and \"red,\" and\nconverges on the conclusion that lemons are fast while prunes are slow. The distribution of responses\nwas also similar, with convergence being more important for the heaviness of the colour red and the\nslowness of prunes than for the sourness of boulders and the speed of lemons. However, we also\nobserved an intramodal correspondence between circles and red, which raises questions about the\nabsence of intramodal matching in the previous set of participants. The results on the \"Bouba\"\u00ad\"Kiki\"\nmatchings were also broadly similar to those obtained in Experiment 1 (and which have already been\ndocumented recently in a remote culture; see Bremner et al., 2013, for a cross-cultural study of the\n\"Bouba\"\u00ad\"Kiki\" effect), while showing some minor differences regarding the effects of emotional\ncues (here, both sad and happy faces were more often associated with \"Kiki\" than \"Bouba\"), thus sug-\ngesting that the effect of emotion should be more thoroughly investigated in future research.\n4 General discussion\nThe results of the two experiments reported in the present study demonstrate the potential power of\ninternet-based testing methods for those wanting to assess a variety of different crossmodal corre-\nspondences. Despite participants completing Experiment 2 unsupervised on a wide variety of hard-\nware in various testing environments, the results of both experiments were satisfyingly congruent with\none another (as also reported by Crump et al., 2013; Germine et al., 2012). The speed of data collection\nin Experiment 2 was in addition remarkably fast (82 participants in 4 hours) and very cost effective,\nand indeed perhaps \"revolutionary\" (Crump et al., 2013). Conceivably, the limiting factors for online\nresearch are now the limited number of sensory modalities that can be stimulated and the restricted\nrange of sensors that can be used to collect data--smartphones do have an edge over computers in this\nregard, indicating the direction of the potential next \"revolutionary\" step in data collection (Miller,\n2012). Our results also confirm the fact that, as intuited by Peter Walker (and others, Deroy, 2011;\nSmith, 2012), most people do indeed consider lemons to be fast. One of the novel findings to emerge\nfrom the results of the present study was that most people also associate prunes with slowness, an\nassociation that, as far as we are aware, has not been documented previously. The experimental tech-\nnique used here allowed us to distinguish between the inter-individual (overall likelihood of matching\nFigure 9. Bar graph showing the proportion of happy, neutral, and sad stimuli associated with the words \"Bouba\"\n376 Woods A T, Spence C, Butcher N, Deroy O\nacross all trials) and the intra-individual (confidence ratings plus RT) intuitive appeal of crossmodal\ncorrespondences, and to check the cross-cultural validity of the results.\nAccording to the semantic hypothesis, surprising associations between sensory features or dimen-\nsions arise because the information available to different modalities is recoded into a more abstract,\nsemantic format. The cross-cultural similarities are, in themselves, important to question the link\nbetween this \"semantic\" recoding and linguistic representations (as suggested for instance by Mar-\ntino & Marks, 1999): In the case of thickness and pitch, the association seems to exist--at least, to\nintroduce an interference in a perceptual task--only for Farsi participants who describe pitches as thin\n(na-zok) or thick (koloft) (see Dolscheid, Shayan, Majid, & Casasanto, 2013). Here, we found that\nintuitive crossmodal associations were widespread across cultural and linguistic groups.\nInstead of language, it has been suggested that crossmodal associations are governed by general\ndimensions shared or \"connoted\" by the perceptual concepts applied to the stimuli (Walker & Walker,\n2012). According to the semantic differential technique, as introduced by Osgood et al. (1957; Snider\n& Osgood, 1969), more than half a century ago, many concepts can be analysed (and then matched) in\nterms of dimensions anchored by pairs of polar adjectives; with the most commonly retained dimen-\nsions being active\u00adpassive, good\u00adbad, and dominant\u00adsubmissive (e.g., Proctor & Cho, 2006). Accord-\ning to this approach, for instance, angularity and bitterness are matched because both angular and\nbitter fall on the same \"bad\" end of the bad/good dimension (i.e., they are both potentially dangerous\nIn answer to the question posed in the title of Brown's (1958) early paper (and reprinted in Snider\n& Osgood, 1969), there really is a crossmodal association (or correspondence) between boulders and\nsourness--ironically one for which there is even more inter-individual agreement than the success-\nful \"fast lemons\" originally proposed by Peter Walker. That said, these crossmodal associations are\nweaker than the weight of hues, as assessed here (and borrowed from the research of Alexander &\nShansky, 1976). The existence of a correspondence between boulders and sourness is at first quite\nsupportive of the semantic hypothesis, as it seems not to fail on this example. The fact is that we\npresumably cannot rely on an individual's intuitions as necessarily reflecting a consensus (as Koriat,\n2008, suggested for sound\u00adsymbolic associations between foreign words and their referents). Instead,\nwe need to validate each intuition with experimentation, and this is where a fast, non-expensive and\nfar-reaching new technique like the internet-based testing shows its strength.\nStill, the existence of an intuitive matching between boulders and sourness reinforces a pre-existing\nchallenge for the hypothesis, as one needs to explain how it is that qualitative, metathetic dimensions\n(e.g., of hue and taste quality; Spence, 2011) or natural objects with variable features (boulders) are\nassigned a specific polarity: Why, for example, should yellow, lemons and boulders all be more active?\nWe also examined a rarely discussed aspect of correspondences, that is, the presence of intramodal\ncorrespondences. The results reported here suggest that there may not be a systematic intramodal cor-\nrespondence between shape and texture (soft/rough) although one would expect that both round and\nsoft, and triangle and rough would be given the same polarity regarding certain semantic dimensions\n(\"good\" for the former, and \"active\" for the latter). There was also no systematic correspondence\nbetween colour and shape (except for the matching of roundness with redness in Experiment 2). This\nfinding challenges Kandinsky's (1925) early claim that many instances of such matches exist.\nIn testing the \"Bouba\"/\"Kiki\" effect, we were also able to confirm that making the angularity/\nroundness contrast more salient (by using a star with many angles and a square with fewer) affected\nthe intra-individual confidence of participants in the matching. Interestingly, the prediction generated\nby a consideration of the semantic differential technique (Osgood et al., 1957), that adding cues of sad-\nness to the shape-cues of passivity or cues of happiness to shape-cues of activity would influence the\nmatching between sounds and visual images, was not observed. What is more, the effect of emotional\nfaces on matching also differed as a function of the regions of the world in which the participants\nwere located, but were strong enough to substantially influence the performance of participants on the\nmatching task in Experiment 1, with a sad schematic line drawing of a face overriding shape cues in\nthe association with \"Bouba.\" This result is, however, insufficient to refute the explanations of cross-\nmodal correspondences in terms of the semantic differential technique--as it is possible to construct\nan explanation in terms of another shared dimension (say, for example, that both \"Bouba \" and \"sad\nface\" are passive). However, this result certainly points to the need for those who support the explana-\ntory power of the semantic hypothesis to state precisely which dimension prevails and why, in a given\nsituation.\nCrossmodal correspondences 377\nMore fundamentally, these results show the need to question whether the dimensions singled out\nby Osgood et al. (1957) should be the ones (or the only ones) used when explaining crossmodal cor-\nrespondences. In this sense, Martino and Marks's (2001, p. 64) idea of an \"abstract semantic network\nthat captures synesthetic correspondences\" more carefully avoids mentioning the dimensions inher-\nited from work on the semantic differential technique, but could still be criticized for failing to gener-\nate precise refutable hypotheses (Platt, 1964).\n5 Conclusions\nOver the years, many researchers have been eager to explain surprising crossmodal matches in terms\nProctor & Cho, 2006): The idea is that people match sensory stimuli across different sensory modali-\nties because they connote the same pole on a set of fundamental dimensions, such as active/passive or\ngood/bad. Evaluating this hypothesis empirically is difficult and will certainly require examples used in\nits defence or against it to be robustly tested. Evaluating the hypothesis will also require researchers to\ntest a number of predictions that follow on from the hypothesis. Here, we have pointed to four difficul-\nties: The semantic hypothesis does not explain differences in frequency--or individual confidence--\nwhich exist between crossmodal associations built on the same model (fast lemons, slow prunes, sour\nboulders, and heavy red); it does not explain why certain qualitative dimensions get assigned to a\nspecific polarity in the scaling; it only minimally predicts what happens when the connotations that are\nsupposed to drive the associations are made more salient; finally, it does not explain why the matches\nare no longer observed once intramodal dimensions with congruent connotations are presented. Here,\nwe would like to suggest that this does not mean that the semantic hypothesis does not account for parts\nof the reflective processes by which people rationalize their intuitive sense of crossmodal congruency,\nbut that it lowers its ability to explain what determines these intuitions in the first place. In this respect,\nthe use of internet-based testing protocols, which is now starting to become more widely used across\nvarious areas of psychological research (see Germine et al., 2012, for a recent review) will turn out to\nbe crucial in reaching out to a more varied array of potential participants than those most commonly\nused in psychological experiments currently (i.e., those coming from Western, Educated, Industrialized,\nRich, and Democratic societies--or WEIRD, see Henrich, Heine, & Norenzayan, 2010).\nReferences\nAlexander, K.
