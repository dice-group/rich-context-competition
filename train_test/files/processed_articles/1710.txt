The chief dietary sources of DHA and EPA are\nfatty fish such as mackerel, lake trout, herring, tuna,\nsardines and salmon, as well as dietary supplements.\nConsumption of DHA and EPA and fish containing these\nfatty acids has been shown to reduce blood lipid con-\ncentrations of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol\n(TC) and TAG, and to raise concentrations of HDL\ncholesterol (HDL-C)(5\u00ad7). n-3 Fatty acid intake is also\nassociated with a reduction in plasma biomarkers of\ninflammation such as C-reactive protein (CRP)(5). The phy-\nsiological effects of DHA and EPA include lowering plasma\nTAG concentrations, inhibiting plaque formation, decreas-\ning platelet aggregation and reducing arrhythmias(8\u00ad10).\nFish also contains methylmercury (MeHg), an environ-\nmental contaminant derived from industrial waste and the\nburning of fossil fuels. MeHg makes its way into streams,\nlakes and oceans where it becomes incorporated into\nthe food chain of marine animals(11). The main focus of\nMeHg has been its effects on neurodevelopment in chil-\ndren(12\u00ad14). To monitor exposure to MeHg, the National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)\nmeasured blood and hair Hg concentrations in the sen-\nsitive populations of children and women of childbearing\nage. There is more recent evidence that, in addition to its\neffects on neurodevelopment in children, MeHg may\nincrease the risk of CHD by promoting the formation of\nfree radicals and compromising the function of anti-\noxidants that neutralize these agents(15). Therefore, it is\npossible that consuming fish contaminated with MeHg\nmay increase the risk of CHD.\nThe hypothesis that MeHg attenuates associations\nbetween fish consumption and CHD risk markers remains\nunproven.

There-\nfore the objective of the current study was to investigate\nrelationships between 30 d frequency of fish intake, total\nblood Hg concentrations and risk markers of CHD in\nwomen aged 16\u00ad49 years who participated in NHANES\nblood concentrations of TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, TAG and the\ninflammatory marker CRP.\nMaterials and methods\nrelationships between fish consumption, total blood Hg\nand risk markers of CHD in women aged 16\u00ad49 years.\nThe NHANES is a stratified, multistage probability sample\nof the civilian non-institutionalized US population which\ninterviews approximately 5000 people per survey year.\nRespondents are interviewed in their homes and also\ncomplete a health examination component in mobile\nexamination centres.

In the present\nanalysis, total fish frequency of consumption data for\nwomen aged 16\u00ad49 years was grouped into four cate-\nomitted from the analysis because they are low in Hg. For\nindividuals in each of the four fish consumption cate-\ngories, mean blood lipids, CRP, total blood Hg and\nnutrient concentrations along with descriptive statistics\nfor selected demographic variables were calculated. The\nsummary statistics were derived using the 4-year statistical\nweights and adjusting for the statistical design of the\nsurvey as recommended by the NHANES analytical\nDietary exposure to Hg was evaluated in this study using\ntotal blood Hg concentrations measured in NHANES\nDependent variables\nThe dependent variables of interest in this study were TC,\nHDL-C and CRP. Because TAG data were available for a\na separate sensitivity analysis was conducted using serum\nTAG and LDL-C concentrations.\nCovariate variables\nCovariates were included in the regression models to take\ninto account demographic, lifestyle and nutritional factors.\nDemographic and lifestyle variables were self-reported\nunless otherwise noted and included age (grouped for the\nand 40\u00ad49 years), ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-\nHispanic black, Mexican-American, other Hispanic and\nother), BMI (calculated as measured weight in kilograms\ndivided by the square of measured height in metres),\neducational attainment (less than high school, high school\nor General Educational Development, greater than high\nschool), physical activity (separated into low, moderate\nand heavy levels of daily activity), prescription drug use\n(anti-inflammatory or lipid-lowering), serum cotinine\nconcentrations (a measure of exposure to tobacco) and\nmedical history of heart disease (physician-diagnosed\ndiseases). The diagnoses of congestive heart failure, CHD,\nangina, heart attack or stroke were categorized as heart\ndisease. Intake of individual nutrients was derived from\nthe 24 h dietary recall interview and was based on calcu-\nlations by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).\nNutrient intakes (energy, fibre, MUFA, SFA, TC, vitamin C,\nalcohol and Se) were treated as continuous variables in\nall models. Nutrients that were omitted from the models\nbecause they were not significantly associated with the\ndependent variables or caused collinearity included pro-\ntein, carbohydrate, total fat and total PUFA.\nCohort for analysis\nThe sample for the present study was limited to women\nfor whom data for the independent and dependent vari-\ndataset contains a total of 10 790 women, including\nrestricted to women having measurements for total blood\n(n 3435). LDL-C and TAG data were collected on only a\nsubset of women, reducing the sample size to 1726 prior\nto testing for confounding variables.\nWomen were excluded from all analyses if they\nreported on the demographic questionnaire that they\nwere pregnant (n 704), if a doctor had told them\nthey were diabetic (n 104) or if their 24 h dietary recall\ninterview was coded by NCHS as unreliable (n 207). This\noccurred if .25 % of foods reported consumed had\nmissing descriptive information, .15 % of foods had\nmissing quantities eaten or if a meal did not include\nat least one identified food. In addition, 211 women who\ndid not have 4-year statistical weights were excluded. The\nnumbers excluded are not mutually exclusive.

All estimates were derived\nusing the 4-year statistical weights based upon mobile\nexamination centre participation and adjusting for survey\ndesign. Regression analyses were conducted using the sur-\nvey regression commands in STATA. The distributions of\ncontinuous variables were tested for normality using the\nShapiro\u00adWilk test and data were transformed to achieve\nnormality when necessary. Prior to analysis, log transfor-\nmations were done on CRP and total blood Hg values, and a\nsquare-root transformation was performed on the total\nreported 30d fish food frequency values(21).\nThe following hypotheses were tested:\n1. Fish intake is negatively associated with TC and CRP\nconcentrations, and positively associated with HDL-C\nand total blood Hg concentrations.\n2. Total blood Hg will attenuate any associations\ndemonstrated between fish consumption and CHD\nrisk markers.\nWe tested the effects of dietary 24 h intakes of n-3 PUFA\non TC, CRP and HDL-C and the effects of total blood\nHg on these associations; however, all results were not\nsignificant and thus are excluded from the current paper.\nThe sample was stratified into categories defined by\ntotal frequency of fish consumption in the past 30 d\nvariables for each of the three fish-consuming groups\nwere compared with those of the fish non-consuming\ngroup using the adjusted Wald test.\nThe associations between total frequency of fish con-\nsumption in the past 30 d, blood lipids and CRP con-\ncentrations were tested using multiple linear regression\nanalyses. The initial models (Model 1) adjusted for energy\nintake and age (separated by decade, with women aged\n16\u00ad19 years serving as the reference population). To\nadjust for potential confounding, subsequent multivariate\nmodels included known CHD risk factors.\nSpecifically, Model 2 adjusted for the variables in\nModel 1 as well as for lifestyle, dietary habits and medical\nhistory of arthritis and CHD. Model 2 also included\nadjustments for prescription drug use (anti-inflammatory\nor lipid-lowering), ethnicity, educational attainment\n(indicator variables) and continuous variables such as\nBMI, smoking (measured as serum cotinine) and 24 h\ndietary recall interview intakes of total energy, fibre, SFA,\nMUFA, vitamin C, Se and alcohol (continuous variables).\nModel 3 included total blood Hg concentrations (log) in\naddition to the variables included in Model 2. The analyses\nwere conducted separately for each of the blood lipids and\nCRP.

When total blood Hg was\nintroduced into the regression models, the significant\nassociations between frequent fish intake and CRP\nremained the same although the association with HDL-C\nwas diminished. Further analyses controlling for total\nblood Hg demonstrated that this latter effect is most likely\ndue to collinearity between fish intake and total blood\nHg. There was no longer an association between fish\nconsumption and TAG once the total blood Hg and fish\ninteraction was added to the model. This may be attrib-\nuted to the small sample size since the TAG analyses were\nconducted on a subset of the population, or it may be\npossible that adding Hg to the model may have led to\nover-controlling for variables as Hg and fish consump-\ntion are highly correlated. No significant associations\nwere seen between fish intake and either LDL-C or TC\nconcentrations.\nConsumption of DHA and EPA and fish containing\nthese fatty acids has been shown to reduce blood con-\ncentrations of LDL-C, TC and TAG and to raise con-\ncentrations of HDL-C(5\u00ad7). The average DHA 1 EPA intake\nin our study (0?1 g/d) was much lower in comparison to\nthat of other studies. Our results agree with other studies\nwhich have shown that fish intake or markers of fish\nintake (plasma PUFA) do not significantly impact LDL-C\nin our study was also less than the American Heart\nAssociation (AHA) recommendation (at least 0?5\u00ad1?0 g of\nn-3 fatty acids daily to achieve cardioprotective effects),\nwhich may explain the lack of association in the models\nwhere HDL-C, LDL-C and TC were the independent\nvariables(24). When 24 h dietary intake of DHA 1 EPA was\nused as a marker of fish consumption there were no\nassociations with risk markers of CHD. The lack of\nassociation may be due to the fact that fish intake is\nvariable and a single 24 h recall does not capture foods\nthat are eaten on an irregular basis.\nOrganic (methyl) Hg is present in fish due to its uptake\nfrom environmental sources(11). In man, the sole source\nof exposure to organic Hg is the consumption of fish and\nsea mammals(12). Research has linked Hg ingestion from\nstudy of women aged 16\u00ad49 years we found a protective\nassociation between fish intake and CHD risk factors.\nAnalyses of the association between fish consumption\nand HDL-C levels, controlling for Hg levels, showed that\nthe difference in HDL-C concentrations between fish non-\nconsumers and consumers across Hg tertiles did not\ndecrease, implying that Hg did not diminish the positive\nassociation between fish intake and HDL-C. Inconsistent\nrelationships between biomarkers of Hg and CHD risk\nhave been reported, perhaps due to differences in the\nages of the study subjects, frequency of fish consumption\namong populations studied, type of fish consumed and\nCRP is a predictor of CHD risk(27) and is affected by\nnumerous lifestyle variables. In general, individuals with\nelevated CRP concentrations tend to smoke, have high\nblood pressure, are overweight and fail to exercise(28). A\nfew studies have evaluated the effects of dietary intakes of\nDHA 1 EPA on CRP concentrations and other biomarkers\nof inflammation in different samples of subjects and have\nThe present cross-sectional study extends the results of\nThe average total blood Hg was higher for the 1245\nwomen (aged 16\u00ad49 years) in the current study than Hg\nlevels reported from the same data set using a different\net al. also reported that women who ate 3 or more\nservings of fish (in the past 30 d) had four-fold greater\ngeometric mean Hg concentrations compared with\nwomen not consuming fish(31). A second study that ana-\nlysed hair Hg data reported three-fold higher hair Hg\nconcentrations in frequent fish consumers ($3 times in\nthe past 30 d) than in non-consumers(32). In the current\nstudy, there was a seven-fold difference in total blood Hg\nconcentration between women who consumed fish $9\ntimes/30 d and the fish non-consumers. The differences\nbetween studies are most likely due to how the fish\nconsumption groups are stratified and the sample sizes\nwithin these groups.\nWhen total blood Hg data were analysed by race/\nethnicity, the results of the current study are consistent\nwith two recent reports that analysed relationships\nbetween calculated organic blood Hg (rather than total\nblood Hg concentrations), hair Hg concentrations and\nfish intake during the first two years of the NHANES\ncentrations were in Mexican-Americans and the highest\nconcentrations were in participants who designated\nthemselves in the `other' racial/ethnic category, which\nincluded Asians, Native Americans and Pacific Islan-\nyears have blood organic Hg concentrations 1?5 times\nfound a two-fold difference in total blood Hg con-\nOnly fifty-seven women in our sample reported con-\nsuming fish $9 times in the past 30 d, a frequency similar\nto the AHA recommendation of eating fish at least twice\nweekly.

Therefore,\nthese results cannot be generalized to other population\ngroups. Inherent to a large cross-sectional study is the\ntemporality of the data; therefore, in the present obser-\nvational and cross-sectional study we cannot exclude the\npossibility that the association between fish and CHD risk\nfactors may be due to unmeasured variables. However,\nwe controlled for all variables currently known to affect\nrisk of CHD. Alternatively, the study would have been\nstrengthened if actual disease endpoints could have been\nused; however, the age group of the study sample was\nprohibitive of such analysis.\nn-6 and n-3 PUFA compete during metabolism and an\nexcessive intake of n-6 fatty acids may attenuate the\ncardioprotective benefits normally seen with n-3 PUFA.\nIn a large prospective cohort study, Mozaffarian et al.\ninvestigated the joint effects of different PUFA on the risk\nof CHD in men. These researchers saw benefits in the\ncombination of plant- and marine-based n-3 PUFA on\nCHD risk independent of n-6 PUFA consumption. They\nconcluded that non-marine-based n-3 PUFA are beneficial\nin reducing risk of CHD, especially when populations do\nnot have easy access or availability to marine sources(34).\nThe interplay of plant-derived and marine-derived n-3\nfatty acids was not analysed in the current study.\nThe results of the present study would have been\nstrengthened if data on LDL-C and TAG had been avail-\nable for more subjects, since both of these lipid bio-\nmarkers may be affected by n-3 PUFA(12). However, the\nanalysis on a subpopulation did not show any association\nbetween n-3 fatty acids and these blood lipids. Other\ninflammatory biomarkers such as IL-6 or other cytokines\nmay be better indicators of CHD risk than CRP, but these\ndata were not available in the current NHANES surveys.\nA strength of the current study is that a 30 d frequency of\nfish intake was used which provides a good estimate of\nhabitual intake. Also, the current study included healthy\nwomen of childbearing age, whereas studies that examined\nthe joint association between fish intake, MeHg and CHD\nonly included men and older women. Finally, because the\nNHANES data set is large, we were able to control for a\nnumber of demographic and lifestyle variables.\nSummary\nThe results of the present study provide further support for\nrecommending regular fish consumption along with main-\ntaining a healthy lifestyle (e.g. not smoking and getting daily\nmoderate exercise) as a way of reducing the risk of CHD.\nThe effect of Hg on biomarkers of inflammation is unclear.\nBased on this study and others, it appears that the levels of\nHg in fish consumed by this population may not be high\nenough to counteract the positive association between fish\nintake and CHD risk factors.\n"
