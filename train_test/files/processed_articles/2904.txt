Nevertheless,\nsevere outflows and falling returns. In this paper we investigate the reasons be-\nhind these developments and contribute to our understanding of the stability\nof financial intermediaries. The sample we are using includes all German retail\na competitive environment, where investors react to good or bad performance,\nMMFs' managers have an incentive to invest in riskier assets in order to en-\nhance their performance. The narrow structure of MMFs is thereby diluted\nand the probability of a run on the fund increases.\nFirst, we look at persistence of money market funds' returns i.e. if the per-\nformance ranking of money market funds is repeated over subsequent years.\nPositive evidence for persistence permits a first inference on the reasons be-\nhind money market returns. Our main finding is that even though returns are\noverall persistent there are some periods that do not show persistence. Most\nimportantly, the winning funds of 2006 (before the liquidity crisis) are the los-\ning funds of 2007 (in the liquidity crisis) and vice versa. This provides a first\nindication of the impact of market liquidity for the returns of money market\nfunds.\nSecond, we examine the causes for persistence in returns. We find that two\nfactors drive persistence: expenses and portfolio liquidity. Thus, money mar-\nket funds can enhance their returns by investing in less liquid assets. By doing\nso money market funds with less liquid portfolios can outperform more liquid\nfunds. Sufficient market liquidity ensures that funds with less liquid portfolios\ncan sell assets at any time. The long period of high market liquidity from 2002\nto 2006 enabled illiquid funds to outperform persistently. The liquidity crisis\nof 2007, however, led to a reversal of performance. Funds with a less liquid\nportfolio were at a disadvantage due to the decline in market liquidity\nThird, this article investigates flows into and out of MMFs. We find a sig-\nnificant flow-performance relationship, meaning that investors withdraw their\nmoney from funds that underperform and invest in funds that outperform. In\ntimes of low market liquidity people withdraw their money from less liquid\nfunds and we observe run-like phenomenons. Liquid funds, on the other hand,\nshow no significant outflows and continue to function as a safe haven.\nOur results are subject to caveats. Credit as well as interest rate risk may\nalso be behind our evidence. However, data limitations do not allow us any\nanalysis of these aspects. Interest rate should play a limited role given the\nassets typically have a very short maturity. The developments during the sub-\nprime crisis have shown that previously save securities exhibited substantially\nlarger credit risk and may thus also be present in MMFs. Also credit and\nliquidity risk are difficult to disentangle during times of market turmoil.\nNichttechnische Zusammenfassung\nGeldmarktfonds gelten \u00a8\nublicherweise als sehr sichere Anlage, da sie ausschlie\u00df-\nlich in Wertpapiere mit sehr hoher Bonit\u00a8\nat und kurzer Laufzeit investieren.\nDennoch verzeichneten deutsche Geldmarktfonds starke Abfl\u00a8\nusse und fallende\nRenditen w\u00a8\nahrend der Liquidit\u00a8\natsengp\u00a8\nasse im Zuge der Subprime-Krise. In\ndiesem Diskussionspapier untersuchen wir die Ursachen f\u00a8\nur diese Ereignisse\nund analysieren die Stabilit\u00a8\nat von Finanzintermedi\u00a8\naren. Die verwendete Stich-\nprobe enth\u00a8\nalt alle deutschen Publikumsgeldmarktfonds im Zeitraum 1996 bis\nzur ersten Jahresh\u00a8\nalfte 2008. Unsere Ergebnisse weisen darauf hin, dass Inve-\nstoren auf den Investitionserfolg von Geldmarktfonds mittels ihrer Anlageent-\nscheidung reagieren. Somit haben Manager von Geldmarktfonds einen Anreiz\nin riskantere Anlagearten zu investieren, um ihre Ertr\u00a8\nage zu verbessern. Dies\nverw\u00a8\nassert jedoch die sichere Struktur von Geldmarktfonds und macht einen\nAnsturm auf Geldmarktfonds durch die Investoren wahrscheinlicher.\nIn einem ersten Schritt untersuchen wir, ob die Renditen der Geldmarkt-\nfonds im Zeitablauf persistent sind, d.h. ob eine stabile Rangfolge der Geld-\nmarktfonds hinsichtlich ihrer Renditen \u00a8\nuber mehrere Jahre erkennbar ist. Wir\nzeigen, dass Renditen zwar persistent sind, dass die Persistenz in einigen Zeit-\nperioden aber unterbrochen wurde. Hierbei ist besonders hervorzuheben, dass\ndie Geldmarktfonds mit der h\u00a8\nochsten Rendite vor der Liquidit\u00a8\natskrise in den\nahrend der Liquidit\u00a8\noren. Dies stellt ein erstes Indiz f\u00a8\nur den Einfluss der Marktliquidit\u00a8\nat\nauf die Renditen der Geldmarktfonds dar.\nIn einem zweiten Schritt untersuchen wir die Gr\u00a8\nunde f\u00a8\nur persistente Rendi-\nten bei Geldmarktfonds. Unsere Ergebnisse weisen auf zwei Faktoren hin, die\ndie Persistenz von Renditen bestimmen: Fondsgeb\u00a8\nuhren und die Portfolioliqui-\ndit\u00a8\nat. Geldmarktfonds k\u00a8\nonnen ihre Renditen aufbessern, indem sie in weniger\nliquide Wertpapiere investieren. Fonds mit einem weniger liquiden Portfolio\nk\u00a8\nonnen daher Fonds mit liquidem Portfolio in der Rendite \u00a8\nubertreffen. Eine\nausreichende Marktliquidit\u00a8\nat gew\u00a8\nahrleistet, dass weniger liquide Fonds jeder-\nzeit Aktiva verkaufen k\u00a8\nvon sehr hoher Liquidit\u00a8\nat gepr\u00a8\nagt und machte es m\u00a8\noglich, dass weniger liqui-\nde Fonds kontinuierlich liquidere Fonds \u00a8\nubertrafen. Die Liquidit\u00a8\natsengp\u00a8\nasse\nw\u00a8\nuhrte allerdings zu einer Umkehr des In-\nvestitionserfolges. Aufgrund des deutlichen R\u00a8\nuckgangs der Marktliquidit\u00a8\nat wa-\nren weniger liquide Fonds im Nachteil.\nDrittens untersucht dieses Diskussionspapier die Mittelzu- und abfl\u00a8\nusse von\nGeldmarktfonds. Als erstes Ergebnis ist festzustellen, dass Investoren auf den\nInvestitionserfolg von Geldmarktfonds reagieren. Fonds mit einer positiven\n\u00a8\nUberschussrendite verzeichnen Zufl\u00a8\nusse, w\u00a8\nahrend Fonds mit einer negativen\n\u00a8\nUberschussrendite Abfl\u00a8\nusse verzeichnen. Unser zweites Ergebnis ist, dass in\nPhasen von geringer Marktliquidit\u00a8\nat Investoren ihre Mittel aus weniger liqui-\nden Fonds abziehen. Liquidere Fonds hingegen verzeichnen keine signifikanten\nAbfl\u00a8\nusse und wurden somit von Investoren als sicherer Hafen wahrgenommen.\nEinschr\u00a8\nankend ist zu konstatieren, dass die Ergebnisse m\u00a8\noglicherweise auch\nauf Kreditrisiken und das Zins\u00a8\nanderungsrisiko zur\u00a8\nuckgef\u00a8\nuhrt werden k\u00a8\nonnen.\nJedoch erlauben uns die Daten keine Untersuchung dieser beiden Aspekte.\nDas Zins\u00a8\nanderungsrisiko spielt bei Geldmarktfonds aufgrund der sehr kurzfri-\nstigen Laufzeiten der Aktiva nur eine eingeschr\u00a8\nankte Rolle. Die Entwicklungen\nw\u00a8\nahrend der Subprime-Krise haben gezeigt, dass viele vormals als sicher einge-\nstufte Wertpapiere ein deutlich h\u00a8\noheres Kreditrisiko aufweisen. Zudem gehen\nw\u00a8\nahrend der Turbulenzen an den M\u00a8\narkten Kredit- und Liquidit\u00a8\natsrisiko eng\nmiteinander einher.\nContents\n2 Related Literature 2\n3 Institutional Background 6\n4 Empirical Analysis 7\n4.1 Data and Descriptive Statistics . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7\n4.2 Persistence of Returns . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15\n4.3 Outperformance and Liquidity Risk . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 19\n4.4 Market Illiquidity and Fund Flows . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 23\nList of Tables\n1 Summary Statistics . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9\n2 Asset Composition of German Retail Money Market Funds . . . 14\n3 Performance Persistence of Money Market Funds: First-Order\nAutocorrelation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 16\n4 Performance Persistence of Money Market Funds: Repeat Win-\nners and Losers . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 18\n5 The Influence of Portfolio Liquidity on Returns: Cross Sectional\nRegressions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 21\n6 The Influence of Portfolio Liquidity on Returns: Fixed Effects\nRegression . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 22\n7 The Influence of Market Illiquidity on Fund Flows . . . . . . . . 28\nList of Figures\n1 Return of Money Market Funds and 3-month Bubill Return . . 8\n2 Excess Returns of Money Market Funds . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10\n3 Total Net Assets of Money Market Funds . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11\n4 Flows of Money Market Funds . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12\n5 Euribor-Bubill Spread . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13\n6 Net Flows by Portfolio Liquidity . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25\n7 Marginal Effect of Market Illiquidity on Net Flows . . . . . . . . 30\n1 Introduction\nMoney market funds (MMFs) are normally seen as an extremely safe invest-\nment, because they only invest in short-term, high-grade debt. For this reason,\nMMFs should only have a minimum exposure to interest rate, credit or liquid-\nmarket funds faced severe outflows and falling returns. The aim of this paper\nis to investigate the reasons for the crisis of German money market funds.\nOpen-end mutual funds in general, similarly to banks, offer demand de-\nposit contracts, meaning that investors can withdraw their money at any\ntime. Withdrawals, however, impose a negative externality on the remain-\ning investors in the fund (e.g. Edelen 1999, Nanda, Narayanan & Warther\n2000). This is because facing outflows fund managers have to sell their assets\nat an unfavorable time. The expectation that other investors will withdraw\ntheir money can lead the remaining investors to follow, and can result in a\nGoldstein & Jiang 2007). The likelihood of such a run increases if the negative\nexternality increases. Therefore, runs are more likely in illiquid funds than in\nliquid funds.\nGiven that money market funds only invest in short-term, high grade debt,\nruns used to be considered as unlikely. Money market funds close the matu-\nrity gap that makes banks vulnerable to runs. By doing so MMFs can provide\nliquidity services without needing a socially costly deposit insurance. MMFs\nare therefore often considered to be \"narrow banks\".\nThis alternative form of liquidity provision is growing not only in the United\nStates, but also in other countries. Since the first MMF was established in the\nwide. Overall, money market funds account for over 19% of all mutual fund\nassets in the world, which makes them the second largest group after equity\nfunds.1 The growing relevance of MMFs as financial intermediaries makes it\nimportant to investigate whether MMFs are indeed immune to runs in times\nof financial turmoil.\n1Worldwide Fund Statistics of the Investment Company Institute (ICI)\nIn this article we use a panel of German retail MMFs and analyze their\nreturns and flows before and during the shortening of liquidity which started\nwith the US subprime crisis. First, we look at persistence of money market\nfunds' returns. The performance of MMFs is usually highly persistent and\nmostly driven by the expense ratio. Our main finding is that even though\nreturns are overall persistent there are some periods that do not show persis-\ntence. Most importantly, the winning funds of 2006 (before the liquidity crisis)\nare the losing funds of 2007 (in the liquidity crisis) and vice versa. Second, we\nexamine the causes for persistence in returns. We find that not only expenses\nbut also the portfolio structure drive performance persistence. While money\nmarket funds that invest in illiquid assets outperform during liquid times they\nunderperform in illiquid times. Third, we investigate the flows into and out of\nMMFs. There exists a significant performance-flow relationship, meaning that\ninvestors withdraw their money from funds that underperform and invest in\nfunds that outperform. In times of extreme illiquidity people withdraw their\nmoney from less liquid funds and we observe run-like phenomenons. Liquid\nfunds, on the other hand, show no significant outflows and continue to function\nas a safe haven.\nThe results of this paper contribute to our understanding of the stability\nof financial intermediaries. Our results suggest that in a competitive environ-\nment, where investors react to good or bad performance, MMFs' managers\nhave an incentive (\"Drang\": drive, impulse, urge) to invest in riskier assets in\norder to enhance their performance. The narrow structure of MMFs is thereby\nwidened and the probability of a run (ger.: \"Sturm\") on the fund increases.\n2 Related Literature\nThis article refers to several strands of literature: Persistence of MMFs' re-\nturns is a well known fact in the literature and documented by several studies\nEngstr\u00a8\nom & S\u00a8\noderlind 2000). Performance persistence of MMFs is generally\nattributed to the strong persistence of expense ratios. Domian & Reichen-\nstein (1998) find that expense ratio plus a dummy variable indicating whether\na fund exclusively invests in government securities explain 87% of the cross\nsectional difference in net returns. They conclude that MMFs are a financial\ncommodity and best selected by the lowest expense ratio.\nA logical question that follows is, how can in an competitive environment\nfunds with high and low expense ratios coexist? Christoffersen & Musto (2002)\nargue that fund managers can charge different prices to their investors, because\nthey face different demand curves. In particular, investors differ in their sensi-\ntivity to management fees. Therefore, fund managers are able to charge higher\nexpense ratios without losing all existing investors. This allows some MMFs'\nmanagers to persistently have higher expense ratios and to underperform other\nfunds.\nUsing a non-parametric method proposed by Brown, Goetzmann, Ibbot-\nson & Ross (1992) we are able to have a disaggregate view on performance\npersistence of MMFs. Even though persistence in our sample is very strong\nand present in the majority of years we also find that several years show no\npersistence and a reversal in performance from one year to another. The per-\nsistence of expense ratios is not able to explain years without persistence or\na reversal in performance. This result suggests that an additional factor is\ndriving MMFs' return persistence.\nOther studies argue that MMFs are not a mere commodity meaning that\nfund expenses are not the only determinant of returns. Koppenhaver (1999)\nshows in a cross-sectional regression that in addition to expenses also other\nportfolio characteristics affect returns. The share of agency securities and\ncommercial papers is assumed to be a proxy for credit risk and has a positive\neffect on returns. Further, a higher weighted average maturity results in a\nhigher return. In this sense, fund managers can offset the annual expenses and\nenhance returns by increasing credit or interest rate risk.\nWe follow this line of argument and investigate how money market fund\nmanagers can enhance their returns by investing in less liquid assets. This\npaper contributes to the literature above in showing that the impact of liq-\nuid assets is not constant over time but varies as a function of market-wide\nliquidity: money market funds with illiquid assets outperform in liquid times\nbut underperform in illiquid times (See Acharya & Pedersen 2005, Massa &\n2We primarily relate the performance of MMFs to liquidity risk and not to credit and\nThere exists a large literature on the negative effect of outflows on the\nremaining investors in the fund (e.g. Chordia 1996, Nanda, Narayanan &\nexample liquidity-based trading, price impact and commissions. In addition,\nthe fund might be forced to deviate from its desired portfolio also resulting\ninto costs. Therefore, fund managers set front- and back-end fees to dissuade\nredemptions and investors self-select themselves into a fund according to their\nliquidity needs (e.g. Chordia 1996). Since it usually takes some days for the\nfund manager to restore her cash balance, the costs of redemptions affect\nmainly the remaining investors in the fund. For this reason, withdrawals im-\npose a negative externality on the remaining investors.\nChen, Goldstein & Jiang (2007) consider this negative externality in the\ncontext of strategic complementarities in mutual funds. In the framework of\nglobal games they are able to develop testable predictions about runs (Carlsson\ninvestors will withdraw their money can cause further investors to withdraw\ntheir money, resulting in a \"self-fulfilling run\". Since the negative external-\nity increases with the illiquidity of the fund, illiquid funds are more likely to\nexperience runs than liquid funds. Chen et al. (2007) argue further that the ex-\nternality caused by withdrawals can be internalized if the number of investors\nis small enough. This article shows that strategic complementarities can even\nexist in relatively liquid sector of money market funds.\nFinally, this article contributes to the literature concerned with the financial\nstability of narrow banking. Banks finance short-term deposits with long-term\ncredits. This maturity intermediation makes banks vulnerable to runs (Dia-\nmond & Dybvig 1983). One remedy to avoid bank runs is to insure deposits\nand thereby establish trust in the bank. Deposit insurance, however, comes at\na cost: it can lead to moral hazard because managers, insured against a bank\nrun, may invest in riskier assets. A possible solution to this dilemma is the\nSince the key problem of bank runs is the maturity gap narrow banking sug-\nother risks. MMFs typically invest in high grade assets which exhibit limited credit risk.\nHowever, the sudden and rapid downgrade of various asset classes during the subprime crisis\nuncovered previously unexpected credit risks. However, disentangling credit from liquidity\nrisk is difficult given that particularly in times of market wide distress they go hand in hand.\ngests to reduce or eliminate this gap. The narrow banking approach proposes\nthat the two main functions of a bank, the deposit taking and lending function,\nshould be separated into two firms. Instead of financing demand deposits with\nlong term obligations narrow banks should be financed with short-term, high-\nquality securities. In theory, the reduction of the maturity gap would make\nnarrow banks immune to bank runs and a (socially) costly deposit insurance\nwould not be needed. In practice, money market funds are often considered\nto be a form of narrow banking. MMFs provide liquidity services to their\ninvestors by investing exclusively in high-grade debt with short maturity and\nthe deposits are, in contrast to banks, not insured.\nThere are a number of papers that investigate whether MMFs are indeed\nimmune against liquidity or credit shocks. Gorton & Pennacchi (1992) analyze\nin an event study, how a default in the commercial paper market affects the\ncommercial paper spread and if this leads to withdrawals from money market\nfunds. Their main result is that an individual commercial paper default has no\nsignificant impact on the commercial paper spread and does not result in a run\non MMFs. In a similar study Miles (2001) compares the response of MMFs\nand commercial banks to monetary shocks. He finds that money market funds\nhave no difficulties withstanding a monetary shock.\nMore recently, a debate evolved around the question if commercial banks\nhave an advantage in hedging liquidity risk in comparison to other financial\nintermediaries such as MMFs. Gatev & Strahan (2006) argue that the ad-\nvantage of commercial banks to hedge against liquidity risk originates from\nthe fact that flows into banks co-vary with market illiquidity. In other words,\nfollowing an illiquidity shock commercial banks experience inflows instead of\noutflows. Pennacchi (2006), however, finds a similar result for MMFs. Using\nvector autoregression (VAR) he finds that after a liquidity shock MMFs ex-\nperience inflows and the dimension of these inflows is similar to those of large\ncommercial banks.\nThis article contributes to the studies investigating financial stability of\nMMFs in two important ways: First, we use individual money market funds\ninstead of aggregate data. Second, we investigate the stability of MMFs against\nliquidity shocks for a non-US sample. This permits us to gain insight, how the\nconcept of MMFs works under a different regulatory setting.\n3 Institutional Background\nThere are several differences between US and German money market funds. In\nthis section we discuss the most important differences and their implications\nfor the stability of MMFs.\nWhile money market funds have existed for quite some time in the United\nStates, they are fairly new in Germany and were only introduced in the mid\nnineties. As a consequence money market funds play only a minor role in the\nfinancial system of Germany. In the United States money market funds ac-\ncount for 25.8 % of all mutual fund assets. In comparison, in Germany money\nmarket funds represent only for 7.6 % of all mutual fund assets.3\nThe majority of US money market funds have a constant net asset value\n(CNAV) meaning that the value of one share, usually one dollar, remains\nunchanged. Income is reflected in an increase of the number of shares. In\nGermany MMFs have an accumulating net asset value (ANAV), meaning that\nthey are priced market-to-market. Income of the fund is directly reflected by\nan increase of the share value. Gorton & Pennacchi (1992) argue that the\npopularity of constant net asset value in the US is mostly due to a simplified\ntax treatment.\nTo maintain a fixed asset value American MMFs use the so called amor-\ntized cost valuation. This method can lead to arbitrage possibilities, when\nthe valuation method deviates from the market-to-market value. For further\ndetails on the method and the magnitude of arbitrage see Lyon (1984). If the\nmarket price decreases and the amortized cost valuation overprices the share\nvalue substantially there is an incentive for investors to withdraw their money.\nIn this sense, a fixed net asset value makes MMFs more vulnerable to runs. On\nthe other hand, market discipline forces MMFs with constant net asset value\nto reduce the risk of their portfolio.\nIn both the US and Germany MMFs have to invest in securities with a\n3Figures refer to the end of 2007. Sources: Investment Company Institute (ICI) Fact\nBook 2008 and Deutsche Bundesbank Capital Market Statistic (Kapitalmarktstatistik).\nmaximum maturity of one year. In the US the weighted average maturity of\na money market fund is not allowed to exceed 90 days. This regulation was\nintroduced by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 1991 in an\neffort to increase stability of MMFs (Gorton & Pennacchi 1992). Unlike the\nUS there is no regulation concerning the average maturity of German MMFs.\nProbably the most important difference between US and German money\nmarket funds is that US MMFs are subject to an implicit insurance. Issuers\nof money fund promise to never \"break the buck\". This means that the fund\nissuer guarantees that the value will never fall below one dollar. Hence, an in-\nvestor can be sure to get at least the money back she invested. This is no legal\nobligation, but historically the sponsoring organizations have bailed out their\nmoney market funds in trouble (Gup 1998). Bailouts of US money market\nfunds have also taken place during the subprime mortgage crisis. In the course\nof the subprime crisis at least 17 financial companies have bought low-valued\nsecurities from their MMFs to avoid a negative return.4 German issuers of\nmoney market funds do not provide an insurance for their funds or at least do\nnot announce it a-priori. The lack of an implicit insurance increases investor\nuncertainty which may ultimately contribute to runs.\n4 Empirical Analysis\n4.1 Data and Descriptive Statistics\nOur sample contains a survivorship bias free sample of all German retail money\nmarket funds.5 In order to make funds comparable we only consider MMFs\nwhich invest in Euro denominated securities. Our main data source is the\nmonthly capital market statistic (Kapitalmarktstatistik) of the Deutsche Bun-\ndesbank. Further, data on the monthly returns was obtained from Thomson\nFinancial Datastream and data on the annual expense ratios originates from\nthe German Federal Association of Investment Companies (Bundesverband\nDeutscher Investmentgesellschaften, BVI).\nReturns are calculated assuming that dividends are reinvested immediately.\n5There are a number of MMFs registered in Luxembourg and marketed in Germany.\nUnfortunately, we do not have any data on these funds.\nAnnualized Return (%)\nTime\nMMF Return 3-month Bubill Return\nFigure 1: Return of Money Market Funds and 3-month\nBubill Return\nThe figure shows the monthly (annualized) return of an equally\nweighted portfolio of German retail money market funds (MMFs)\nin comparison to a German government bill (Bubill) maturing in\nFigure 1 displays the annualized returns of German MMFs in comparison to\nthe return of a 3-month German treasury bill (Bubill) in the period 1996/01\n- 2008/06. The returns of MMFs follow usually closely the returns of short-\nterm government securities. During the subprime crisis, however, we observe\na sharp drop in the mean MMFs' return.\nFigure 1 highlights that the 3-month Bubill rate can serve as a natural\nbenchmark to compare the performance of MMFs. Therefore, we calculate\nexcess returns by subtracting the 3-month Bubill rate from the funds' net re-\nuse a relative benchmark (i.e. an index of all money market funds) to compare\nthe performance of MMFs. Since the average performance of MMFs dropped\nsharply during the second half of 2007 using a relative benchmark is not ade-\nquate for our purposes.\nTable 1: Summary Statistics\nThis table shows summary statistics to the fund specific variables. Excess return is the\nannualized net return minus the 3-month Bubill rate in percentage points. Relative net\nflows are inflows minus outflows in relation to total assets (in percent). Commercial papers\nare defined as short term securities issued at a discount from financial and non-financial\nissuers. Treasury bills include all European government securities. Debt securities are\nall securities that are neither commercial papers nor treasury securities. Debt securities\ninclude floating and fixed rate securities and also asset-backed securities. All asset classes\nare measured as share of total assets. Age is measured in years since inception. Size is\nthe log of total net assets. Expense ratio is the operating expenses divided by the average\nassets under management. Data sources are Thomson Financial Datastream, the capital\nmarket statistic of the Deutsche Bundesbank (BBK) and the German Federal Association\nof Investment Companies (Bundesverband Deutscher Investmentgesellschaften, BVI)\nMean Variance Percentile Percentile Source\nThe mean excess return is -46.3 basis points (See Table 1). A negative\naverage excess return is at first sight surprising, but MMFs generally earn\nless than short term treasury securities and more than insured bank deposits\n(Koppenhaver & Sapp 2005). This is due to management fees which are nec-\nessary to run the fund. The investor values these intermediary services such\nas diversification, active maturity management and liquidity services, that she\nis willing to pay the fees instead of directly investing in treasury securities.6\nFigure 2 displays the median, 25th and 75th percentile of MMFs' excess\nmoney market fund generally underperforms a 3-month Bubill. However, there\nare funds that outperform other funds and achieve a return equal or higher\n6Koppenhaver & Sapp (2005) estimate the value for intermediary services to be around\nthan the treasury security return. Starting in the second half of 2007 we ob-\nserve a drop in median excess return. But funds are not equally affected by the\ncrisis. While some funds' performance drops considerably other funds manage\nto achieve a return at or above the benchmark. It also can be seen that some\nfunds dropped below zero percent return, meaning that investors actually faced\nnegative returns.\nExcess Return (%)\nTime\nMedian\nFigure 2: Excess Returns of Money Market Funds\nThis figure shows the distribution of annualized excess returns (in\npercentage points) of German retail money market funds.

Summary statistics are displayed in Table 1 and the asset compo-\nsition at the end of each calender year is displayed in Table 2. Commercial\npapers are defined as short term securities issued at a discount by financial\nand non-financial issuers and do not include asset-backed securities. Treasury\nsecurities are all securities issued from European governments and play only a\nminor role in our sample.

Further, bank deposits play an\nimportant but declining role for MMFs.\nAs can be seen in Table 2 MMFs increased their share of debt securities\ncontinuously until 2006 up to 81%. Supposably, they did so because these\nassets earned a higher return than alternative assets (i.e. bank deposits or\ncommercial papers). With the start of the liquidity crisis in 2007 total net\nassets decreased by an amount of around 10 billion Euro, which accounts for a\nthird of all MMFs assets under management (See also Figure 3). In the crisis\nMMFs reduced their share of debt securities and increased the share of more\nsecure assets such as commercial papers or bank deposits.\nThe capital market statistic enables us to directly observe inflows and out-\nflows. We therefore calculate the relative net flows the following way:\n(Rel.) Netflowi,t\n=\nInflowi,t\n- Outflowi,t\nTotal Assetsi,t-1\nMio.

Euro) of German\nretail MMFs over time.\nliquidity crisis we observe increased outflows and a reduction in net flows. Note,\nthat MMFs also experienced outflows in earlier periods, for example during the\nyear 2004. These outflows, however, did not have a negative impact on the\nreturns, supposably because the money market was relatively liquid at that\ntime. Such outflows could have been motivated by the low absolute return of\nMMFs at that time or by other more attractive investment opportunities.\nWe approximate aggregate money market liquidity by the spread between\nthe 6-month Euribor (Euro Interbank Offered Rate) and the 6-month Bubill\nrate. The spread between interbank loans and government bonds can gener-\nally be assigned to both credit or liquidity risk. We follow Grinblatt (2001),\nwho argues that an interbank loan is essentially risk free and the spread be-\ntween the two assets has to be attributed to their differences in liquidity. An\ninterbank loan is rather illiquid, because it cannot easily be converted back.\nA government bond, on the other hand, can more easily be sold before it ma-\ntures. The difference in return between interbank rate and government bonds\nSpread in Percentage Points\nTime\nFigure 5: Euribor-Bubill Spread\nThis figure shows the monthly average spread between the\n6-month Euribor and a German government bond maturing in\nis therefore referred to as convenience yield. Recent empirical studies (e.g.\nutter & Lando 2007) find that the majority of\nthis money market spread can be attributed to a liquidity premium.\nFigure 5 shows the spread between the 6-month Euribor and the 6-month\nthe first half of 2007 the money market experienced a time of relatively high\nliquidity. With the beginning of the second half of 2007 we observe an increase\nin money market spread of more than 60 basis points.\n7Since the Euribor was only established in 1999 we will only use the reduced sample in\nour further investigation.\nTable 2: Asset Composition of German Retail Money Market Funds\nThis table shows the aggregate portfolio positions in million Euro.

The autocor-\nrelation coefficient is 0.54 and significantly different from zero (See Table 3).8\nWe therefore reject the the null hypothesis that past performance is unrelated\nto future performance. Persistence also holds for several sub-samples, however,\nin the sub-sample including the crisis year 2007 significance weakens.\nIn addition, we employ a non-parametric method, suggested by Brown et al.\nThis method allows us to obtain a disaggregate view on persistence. In a\nfirst step, we separate for each year the sample into winning and losing funds.\nWinners are defined as funds which are above the median return and losers\nare smaller or equal the median return. In a second step, we consider repeated\nwinners and losers. Winner-Winner (WW) denotes funds that were winners\nin the last year and are also winners in the current year. In the same way\nfurther groups are established: Loser-Loser (LL), Winner-Loser (WL) and\nLoser-Winner (LW). Table 4 shows the contingency tables for each year. It\nfurther reports the number of new funds in the sample and the funds that drop\nout of the sample.9 We also distinguish whether the fund was a winning fund\nthe period before dropping out (Winner-Gone) or a losing fund (Loser-Gone).\nFor each year we calculate the odds-ratio (OR):\nOR = (WW \u00b7 LL)/(WL \u00b7 LW) (2)\nUnder the null hypothesis that performance in the previous year is unrelated to\nthe performance of the current year the odds-ratio equals one. The logarithm\n8For details on the estimation method see Grinblatt & Titman (1992) or Horst & Verbeek\n9The difference in the number of funds in comparison to Table 2 originates from the fact\nthat a fund has to exist for two whole calender years.\nTable 3: Performance Persistence of Money Market\nFunds: First-Order Autocorrelation\nThis table shows the first-order autocorrelation of MMFs' annual\nreturns. We estimate the first order autocorrelation using the\nFama-MacBeth method. For each year we run a cross sectional\nregression of lagged return on return and average the coefficients\nover time.

In the majority of years, seven out of eleven\ntimes, we reject the null hypothesis of independence on a 10% significance\nlevel. This means that in the majority of years the winners of last year are\nalso the winners of the current year.\nTo assess the overall significance we employ Pearson's p\n-Test (e.g. Rao\nfrom the individ-\nual tests are equally distributed on the [0,1] interval. It follows that  =\nk\n(-2 \u00b7 ln(pi\n)) has a 2 distribution with 2k degrees of freedom where k\nis the number of individual tests.

The advantage of contingency tables is that\nwe are able to disaggregate the test and investigate persistence period by period\nIn contrast to this we find a reversal in outperformance during the subprime\ncrisis: Most winners of 2006, a year of extremely high market liquidity, are\nlosers in 2007, a year of extremely low market liquidity.\nThis result suggests that outperformance of money market funds is a group\nphenomenon depending on market-wide liquidity as a state variable. In the\nnext section we will investigate more closely the determinants of performance\npersistence in money market funds.\nTable 4: Performance Persistence of Money Market Funds: Repeat Winners and Losers\nNote: Funds are classified into winners (annual return above median) and losers (annual return below median) for each year.\nWinner-Winner indicates that a fund was is a winner in the current year (t) and was also a winner the previous year (t-1). New\nFund indicates the number of new funds in t. Winner-Gone (Loser-Gone) shows the number of funds that were Winners (Losers)\nthe previous year (t-1), but are not observed in the current year (t). We test the null hypothesis that past winners are unrelated\nto present winners by calculating the odds-ratio: (Winner-Winner \u00b7 Loser-Loser)/(Winner-Loser \u00b7 Loser-Winner). An odds-ratio of\n1 corresponds to independence. To evaluate the overall rejection/acceptance of the null hypothesis we report Pearson's p-Test\nWinner- Winner- Loser- Loser- New Winner- Loser- Odds-\nYear Total Winner Loser Winner Loser Funds Gone Gone Ratio z p-value\nPearson's p\nTest:\n4.3 Outperformance and Liquidity Risk\nThe persistence of fund returns is generally attributed to the strong persis-\ntence of expense ratios (See e.g. Domian & Reichenstein 1998, Christoffersen\n& Musto 2002). Since investors face costs when switching from one fund to\nanother fund managers are able to charge higher fees without loosing existing\ninvestors. For this reason, some funds can persistently underperform others\nwithout loosing their investors.\nThe year by year inspection of performance persistence showed clearly that\npersistence is not common in all years. There are years without persistence and\npened without a change in expense ratios. Therefore the expense ratio alone\ncannot be the sole explanation for performance and persistence of MMFs.\nKoppenhaver (1999) finds that in addition to expenses the portfolio compo-\nsition also determines MMFs' returns. Fund managers can therefore enhance\ntheir returns by increasing the riskiness of the portfolio. In this line of argu-\nment we want to analyze the cross-sectional differences of money market fund\nreturns with respect to the liquidity of their portfolio. We therefore run the\nfollowing cross-sectional regression for each month:\nExc. Returnit\nLiq. Assetsi,t-1\nExpense Ratioi\n+ i,t\n,\nwhere Liq. Assetsi,t-1\nis the share of treasury securities, bank deposits and\ncommercial papers. These traditional money market instruments are arguably\nthe most liquid assets in the portfolio of a money market fund. Most impor-\ntantly, this share does not include asset-backed securities which bear a higher\nliquidity risk because the market has only recently been established in Europe.\nTo account for possible economics of scale we include Sizei,t-1\n, the logarithm\nof total assets of the fund (Domian & Reichenstein 1998). Further we include\nthe Expense Ratioi\nof the fund as a control, which is the average expense ratio\n11Taking the average for each fund is justified by the fact that expense ratios do almost\nnot vary over time in our sample. The main part of the overall variation (standard deviation:\n0.194) can be attributed to cross sectional variation (standard deviation: 0.183).\nThis regression is similar to the one of Koppenhaver (1999), but we extend\nthis regression by taking into account that the relationship between portfolio\nand return may vary over time as a function of market-wide liquidity. Acharya\n& Pedersen (2005) report that liquid assets have superior performance in illiq-\nuid times and inferior performance in liquid times. We follow Massa & Phalip-\npou (2005) who argue that the relationship of portfolio liquidity and perfor-\nmance varies over time as a function of market-wide liquidity. This leads to\nour first testable hypothesis:\nHypothesis 1: Funds that hold illiquid assets outperform in liquid\ntimes and underperform in illiquid times.\nTo test this hypothesis we run the cross-sectional regression displayed in\nequation 4 for each month. Afterward, we sort the months by market-wide\nliquidity into four quartiles and average the coefficients for each of the four\ngroups. The results of this Fama-MacBeth regression are displayed in Table 5.\nThe impact of liquid assets varies across the four quartiles. In the most liq-\nuid months (1st quartile) the share of liquid assets has a negative impact on\nperformance. The negative impact of liquid assets on performance decreases\nfor the less liquid assets (2nd and 3rd quartile). In times of extreme illiquidity\n(4th quartile) liquid assets even have a positive impact on excess return. We\nfind no evidence for economics of scale.\nFor robustness and to better measure how market illiquidity and portfo-\nlio liquidity interact we run the following fixed effects regression displayed in\nequation 5. We now ask the question how a specific money fund manager can\nenhance her return by changing the portfolio. Using fixed effects we account\nfor possible endogeneity that might result from a correlation of unobserved\nfund specific attributes with the regressors. The empirical model is specified\nas follows:\nExc. Returnit\n= i\nLiq. Assetsi,t-1\nSpreadt\nLiq. Assetsi,t-1\n Spreadt\n+ i,t\n,\nTable 5: The Influence of Portfolio Liquidity on Returns:\nCross Sectional Regressions\nNote: All observations are sorted by money market illiquidity (spread between 6-month\nEuribor and 6-month Bubill rate) and grouped into four quartiles. The table reports average\ncoefficients of monthly cross sectional regressions. Liquid assets include the short term\ngovernment securities, commercial papers and bank deposits. Size is measured as the log of\ntotal assets. Expense ratio is the ratio of annual expenses divided by average assets.

Assetst-1\nwhere Liq. Assetsi,t-1\nis, as mentioned before, the share of traditional money\nmarket instruments (i.e. bank deposits, treasury securities and commercial\npapers). The share of liquid assets enters directly and in interaction with our\nmeasure for market illiquidity Spreadt\ninto the regression equation. Hypoth-\nesis 1 suggests a negative 1\n: in very liquid times liquid assets should have a\nnegative impact on performance. It also follows from hypothesis 1, that the\ncoefficient of the interaction term 3\nis positive: in illiquid times liquid assets\nshould have a positive effect on performance.\nWe again control for economics of scale by including the log of total assets\n. Unobservable fund characteristics are captured by the individual ef-\nfect i\n. This includes also the expense ratio which is, as shown before, largely\ninvariant over time.\nThe results are displayed in Table 6. First, we estimate equation 5 without\nTable 6: The Influence of Portfolio Liquidity on Returns:\nFixed Effects Regression\nThe table shows the fixed effect regression of explanatory variables on excess return.\nSize is measured in log of total assets, Liq.

It becomes obvious, that\nomitting market illiquidity, is problematic. In the first sample period liquid\nassets have a negative impact on returns. This first period was characterized\nby relative high market liquidity as can be seen in Figure 5. In the full sample\nliquid assets do have a positive impact. This is at first sight counterintuitive,\nhowever, driven by the extreme market illiquidity since the middle of 2007.\nControlling for market liquidity is apparently important.\nThe results of the fully specified model can be found in column (2) and\n(4). The coefficient of Liq. Assetsi,t-1\nis, as hypothesized, negative: funds\nwith liquid assets underperform in liquid times. Liquid funds, however, out-\nperform in illiquid times. The interaction coefficient with market illiquidity 3\nis significantly different from zero and positive. Including market-wide liquid-\nity directly and as an interaction term also increases the model's explanatory\npower measured by the within R2 considerably. The pre-crisis sample (1999-\n2006) shows that this result is not driven by the crisis only.\nSince money market liquidity was persistently high from 2001 until the\nfirst half of 2007 illiquid MMFs persistently outperformed liquid MMFs. Per-\nsistence of MMFs' returns is therefore not only driven by persistence of expense\nratios but also by the portfolio structure and the persistence of market-wide\nliquidity.\nEnhancing returns by investing in illiquid assets, however, comes at a cost.\nIf market-wide liquidity drops managers face problems, when investors want\nto redeem their shares. They have to sell relatively illiquid assets at fire sale\nprices, which results in a reduction of returns. This in turn might lead to\nfurther outflows. An illiquidity shock can therefore trigger a self-fulfilling run.\nFor this reason, we now move to analyze the flows in and out of MMFs result-\ning from a market-wide illiquidity shock.\n4.4 Market Illiquidity and Fund Flows\nA market-wide liquidity shock can a-priory have two effects on investors (See\ninvestors can see money market funds as a safe haven, which would lead to\ninflows into money market funds. On the other hand, a sudden drop in liquid-\nity can cause investors to withdraw their money because they are concerned\nabout a value reduction. If other investors fear a reduction in value caused by\nthe initial redemptions, the liquidity shock can lead to a self-fulfilling run.\nThe likelihood of a run depends crucially on the liquidity of the portfolio.\nA withdrawal in illiquid times results in costs, because the fund manager has\nto sell her assets at a bad time and can only achieve a smaller price. Since it\nusually takes some days for the fund manager to restore her cash balance, these\ncosts affect mainly the remaining investors in the fund. Therefore, redemption\nimpose a negative externality on the remaining investors. If this externality\nbecomes sizable, the expectation of other investors withdrawing their money\ncan cause the remaining investors to also withdraw their money, resulting in a\nself-fulfilling run. The negative externality and consequently the likelihood of\na run increases with market illiquidity and the illiquidity of the portfolio. Our\nsecond testable hypothesis therefore is:\nHypothesis 2: In illiquid times funds that hold illiquid assets are\nmore likely to experience a run than funds that\nhold liquid assets.\nAs a first test of this hypothesis we examine the cumulative net flows of\nMoney market funds are sorted in 2007/06 into four groups according to their\nshare of liquid assets.12 Overall, money market funds lost 10.8 billion Euro in\nthe crisis period (Compare also Figure 3). The most illiquid quartile of funds\nlost around 7.2 billion Euro, which accounts for the majority of all outflows.\nIn relation to their total assets before the crisis (2007/06) the quartile of the\nmost illiquid funds lost around 60% of their assets. It can clearly be seen, that\nthe intensity of outflows decreases with portfolio liquidity. The most liquid\nfunds only experienced outflows of around 5%.\nTo evaluate the impact of market liquidity shocks on MMFs' flows more closely\nwe specify the following empirical model:\nNetflowit\n= i\nLiq. Assetsi,t-1\nExc. Returni,t-1\nSpreadt\nSpreadt\n Liq. Assetsi,t-1\nSpreadt\n Exc. Returni,t-1\n+ i,t\nwhere Netflowit\nis the relative net flow of fund i in period t. The flow is\nmeasured relative to total assets of the previous month. Liq. Assetsi,t-1\nis our\npreviously used proxy for portfolio liquidity. We include past excess return\nExc.

We use the share of treasury securi-\nties, bank deposits and commercial papers as proxy for liquidity.\nFigure 6(a) shows the cumulated net flows (inflows minus out-\nflows) for the four groups of funds in million Euro. Figure 6(b)\nshows the net flows in relation to total net assets of 2007/06.\nbad performance of the fund (e.g. Sirri & Tufano 1998). More recently a per-\nformance flow relationship has also been documented for MMFs (Koppenhaver\n& Sapp 2005). Market illiquidity Spreadt\nis again measured by the spread be-\ntween the Euribor and the Bubill rate, both maturing in 6 months.\nThis money market spread enters directly and as interaction term with\nportfolio liquidity into the regression equation. Hypothesis 2 suggest that\ninvestors react differently to a market-wide liquidity shock depending on the\nliquidity of the portfolio. An increase in the money market spread alone should\nlead to outflows, which should result in a negative 3\n. Liquid funds, on the\nother hand, should experience less outflows when facing market illiquidity. We\nexpect therefore the coefficient of the interaction term 4\nto be positive. The\nregression equation also includes an interaction term of market illiquidity with\npast excess return to test whether the performance flow relationship changes\nin liquid and illiquid times.\nAgain, the log of of total net assets is added as a control. It is generally\nfound that small funds grow faster than large funds. Similarly, we include the\nage in years as a control variable into the regression. Older funds are also as-\nsociated with less inflows (Sirri & Tufano 1998). We only include funds which\nexisted for at least two years. Recently founded funds usually experience very\nlarge inflows in relative terms. This can lead to an outlier problem and skew\nThe results are displayed in Table 7. We estimate equation 6 first using\nthe fund fixed effects (Panel A) and second using fund and time fixed effects\n(Panel B). The control variables Sizei,t-1\nand Agei,t-1\nhave the expected neg-\native sign. We find a positive performance flow relationship. A increase in\nexcess return leads to an inflow and a decrease in performance leads to an out-\nflows of funds. The performance sensitivity of investors might be the reason\nwhy fund managers increased the risk of their portfolio and enhanced their\nfunds in the first place. Similarly, we find some evidence that liquid assets\nlead to outflows in liquid times. This is in line with the positive performance\nflow relationship. Liquid assets earn less return in good times and investors\nrespond by withdrawing their money.\nA sudden increase in market illiquidity has a negative effect on flows, which\nconfirms the hypothesis of a run on illiquid funds. An increase in liquid assets\nlimits outflows and counteracts this first effect. Funds with a large amount of\nliquid assets will therefore not experience significant outflows after an illiquid-\nity shock. Figure 7 plots the marginal effect of market illiquidity on net flows\nas a function of portfolio liquidity.13 Money market funds with less than 30%\nof liquid assets experience significant outflows after an illiquidity shock (at the\n5% significance level). In contrast, there are no significant outflows after an\nilliquidity shock for funds with a share of above 30%.\nThis result shows the crucial importance of portfolio liquidity in preventing\nruns. MMFs that are truly narrow are immune against runs and thus there is\nno need for deposit insurance. By contrast, MMFs that enhance their returns\nby deviating from the narrow to a wider portfolio structure expose themselves\nto the risk of a run.\n13The marginal effect and its variance is calculated as follows (For details see e.g. Greene\nNetflow\nSpread\n= 3 + Liq.Assets \u00b7 4\nVar\nNetflow\nSpread\n= Var[3] + Liq.

Market illiquidity\nis measured by the Euribor-Bubill spread and portfolio liquidity\nis approximated by the share of traditional money market instru-\nments.\n5 Conclusion\nThis paper showed that in liquid times some MMFs' managers enhanced their\nreturns by investing in less liquid assets. We give evidence that this drive (ger.:\n\"Drang\") to higher returns is motivated by investors reacting to bad perfor-\nmance and withdrawing their money. By investing in illiquid assets funds can\noutperform other funds as long as liquidity in the market is high. Investing in\nless liquid assets, however, widens the narrow structure of money market funds\nwe observe runs (ger.: \"Sturm\") on money market funds with enhanced and\nilliquid portfolios. Money market funds with more liquid portfolios, in con-\ntrast, had no significant outflows and functioned as a safe haven.\nThe study shows the risk involved in investing in illiquid assets when a\nopen-ended structure is involved. Most importantly, this paper gives evidence\nthat runs are even possible in the, usually highly liquid, money market seg-\nment.\nThe results raise the question of how to ensure the stability of money mar-\nket funds. Additional regulations with regard to permitted assets and maturity\nare not necessarily the right solution. Increasing transparency would already\nhelp private investors to gain better insight in the risks they are taking when\ninvesting in money market funds. Up to now asset composition of German\nMMFs is only scarcely available to the public and not standardized. Higher\ntransparency should allow investors to select funds given their liquidity and\nrisk preferences.\nFurther, an insurance provided by the fund issuer might play an important\nrole in the stability of MMFs. During the course of the subprime crisis MMFs'\nassets have increased in the US, where an implicit insurance is provided. Gor-\nton & Pennacchi (1992) argue that an implicit insurance can reduce the risk\nof a run on MMFs in two ways: From the investor's perspective, an insurance\ncan establish trust in the money market fund and thus avoid a self-fulfilling\nrun. From the manager's perspective, the insurance payed by the fund issuer\ngives an incentive to reduce the riskiness of the portfolio\nReferences\nAcharya, V. & Pedersen, L.
