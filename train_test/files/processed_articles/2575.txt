Life-space mobility can be\nThe Gerontologist\nconceptualized as a series of zones, ranging from movement\nwithin one's home to movement beyond one's town, state, or\ngeographic region (Baker, Bodner, & Allman, 2003).\nA majority of community-dwelling adults aged 65\nregularly travel outside their neighborhoods, but 10\u00ad20%\nare confined to their homes (Ganguli, Fox, Gilby, & Belle,\nrisk factor for frailty (Xue, Fried, Glass, Laffan, & Chaves,\n2008), nursing home admission (Sheppard, Sawyer,\nRitchie, Allman, & Brown, 2013), and cognitive decline\n(Crowe et al., 2008); and even modest constrictions in\nlife-space are associated with poor health outcomes (Xue\net al., 2008). Correlates of reduced life-space include\nolder age, lower education, functional limitations, cogni-\ntive impairment, depressive symptoms, health problems,\nsocial isolation, inability to drive, and fewer neighbor-\nhood amenities (Barnes et al., 2007; O'Connor, Edwards,\nWadley, & Crowe, 2010; Rosso, Taylor, Tabb, & Michael,\nWhile documenting life-space constriction at the pop-\nulation level is informative for provision of health and\nsocial services (e.g., meals on wheels, alternate transporta-\ntion services), focused research on specific subgroups (i.e.,\nwomen, racial minorities) provides a unique perspective\non the processes by which disparities in mobility emerge\nand is thus informative for efforts to promote health equal-\nity. Parallel to gender and racial disparities in functioning\n(i.e., Instrumental Activities of Daily Living [IADLs]) and\ndisability (den Ouden, Schuurmans, Mueller-Schotte, &\nvan der Schouw, 2013; Hoover, Rotermann, Sanmartin,\n& Bernier, 2013), is a growing body of research indicat-\ning gender and racial disparities in life-space mobility. For\nexample, older women have smaller life-space relative to\n2013), but longitudinal studies are mixed as to whether\nthe incidence of life-space restriction is greater for women\n2012). Most longitudinal reports operationalized life-space\nas a continuous variable, rather than examining specific\ncategories of constriction that may have more clinical sig-\nnificance (i.e., neighborhood, town) (Rantakokko et al.,\n2013). Additionally, risk factors for life-space constriction\nmay differ by gender; for example, married women are\nmore likely to stop driving in later life than married men\n(Choi, Mezuk, Lohman, Edwards, & Rebok, 2013), indi-\ncating distinct processes within a household that impact\nmobility (i.e., gender or social roles).\nBy several metrics, Blacks have more functional impair-\nment and greater health burden in later life (Allman et al.,\n2004). Such disparities reflect the accumulation of social\nand economic inequalities across the life course (Ferraro &\nShippee, 2009). However, evidence regarding racial dispari-\nties in life-space constriction is mixed. Two cross-sectional\nstudies reported that Blacks have smaller life-space relative\nto Whites (Boyle et al., 2010; Rosso, Grubesic, Auchincloss,\nTabb, & Michael, 2013) although others have not reported\nthis disparity (Sartori et al., 2012). In the only prior lon-\ngitudinal study to date, Allman and colleagues (2004)\nreported that Blacks had smaller life-space than Whites at\nbaseline; however, they were less likely to experience inci-\ndent life-space constriction over follow-up. Moreover, sev-\neral predictors of life-space constriction (i.e., demographic\nand neuropsychological factors, health behaviors, certain\ndiseases, geriatric syndromes) varied in magnitude by race\n(Allman et al., 2004). However, the paucity of longitudinal\nresearch focused on pathways underlying life-space constric-\ntion limits the understanding on how these processes differ\nby gender and race, and how such differences may contrib-\nute to the broader issue of health and healthcare disparities.\nTherefore, the goal of this study was to investigate the\nprocesses underlying prevalent and incident life-space con-\nstriction in later life, and to conduct a focused inquiry of the\nroles of gender and race on these processes. We examined\nthese research objectives using data from the 5-year follow-\nup of the Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and\nVital Elderly (ACTIVE) Study, a prospective community-\nbased cognitive training randomized controlled trial. Based\non previous research we expected to find significant gender\nand racial differences in life-space constriction both at base-\nline and over time, even after adjusting for sociodemographic,\ncognitive, and health factors. Furthermore, we hypothesized\nthat these gender and racial disparities would be differential\nwith respect to prevalent versus incident life-space restriction,\nand that the intersection of gender and race (i.e., white men,\nblack women) would indicate unique patterns of life-space\nrestriction. We conceptualize these as exploratory research\nquestions rather than directional hypotheses given the mixed\nfindings from the limited number of extant studies. Findings\nmay inform efforts to reduce the impact of gender and racial\ninequalities in physical functioning and disability in later life.\nMethods\nSample and Procedures\nThe ACTIVE study is a multisite cognitive training clinical\nrecruitment was limited to older adults who were gener-\nally healthy (e.g., no substantial cognitive or functional\nimpairments). Participants were randomly assigned to one\nof three treatment groups (memory, reasoning, speed of\nprocessing) or control, and follow-up assessments were\nbaseline. The baseline sample consisted of 2,802 persons\naged 65\u00ad94 recruited in 6 metropolitan areas: Boston,\nMassachusetts; Baltimore, Maryland; Detroit, Michigan;\nIndianapolis, Indiana; Birmingham, Alabama; and State\nCollege, Pennsylvania. This analysis is limited to non-\nHispanic Blacks (n = 726) and non-Hispanic Whites\n(n = 2,039) who had completed data on all relevant\ncovariates. ACTIVE was approved by the Institutional\nReview Boards at each site, and all participants provided\ninformed consent.\nMeasures\nLife-Space\nLife-space was assessed with the nine-item Life-space\nAssessment at each wave (Peel et al., 2005). Participants\nwere asked whether they have been outside of their own\nbedroom, house, yard/driveway, property, neighborhood,\nand town in the last week, and whether they have been\nout of their county, state, and region in last 2 months (each\nitem: yes/no). Participants traveled to testing sites at base-\nline; thus they were able to travel at least beyond their\nneighborhood at baseline. Therefore, in our analyses we\ndefined our outcome variable as life-space constricted to\ntown, and our final longitudinal model focused on the inci-\ndence of life-space constriction within town (i.e. outcome\nvariable) This level was chosen because larger levels of life-\nspace constriction (e.g., state) are less likely to be related to\nquality of life (Rantakokko et al., 2013).\nGender and Race\nThe main predictors of interest were gender (men = 0,\nwomen = 1) and race (Non-Hispanic Whites = 0, Non-\nHispanic Blacks = 1) both assessed through self-report.\nOther Predictors\nSociodemographic, health, and cognitive predictors identi-\nfied in previous studies of life-space were included (Baker\net al., 2012). Sociodemographic factors included age, years\nof education (both treated as a continuous variable), and\nliving alone (dichotomized as 0 = live with others, 1 = live\nalone). Comorbidity was measured as a count of the num-\nber of self-report health conditions experienced out of\n11 total (e.g., osteoporosis, asthma, cataracts, glaucoma,\nmacular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, heart disease,\nheart failure, stroke, hypertension, and high cholesterol).\nParticipants reported their driving status via a yes/no ques-\ntion as to whether they drove a car in the prior 12 months.\nDepressive symptoms were assessed using the Center for\nEpidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale, 12-item\nversion (Radloff, 1977). Participants rated how often (on a\n3-point scale) they experienced symptoms during the past\nweek, and items were summed into a total score; higher\nscores indicated more depressive symptoms. Physical per-\nmeasured the number of steps participants took to turn\nin a complete circle. Fewer steps indicated better perfor-\nmance, and the average of two trials was used in analy-\nses. Participants reported their self-rated health on a scale\nfrom 1 = excellent to 5 = poor. Mental status was assessed\nwith the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE; Folstein,\nFolstein, & McHugh, 1975). Participants had to score\n23 to qualify for the study. Cognitive speed of process-\ning was measured with the Useful Field of View (UFOV)\nTest. UFOV measured how quickly participants localized\nand identified stimuli on a computer screen. Scores could\nms for each of four subtests, and\nthe composite score of these subtests was used in analyses\n(Edwards et al., 2005). Higher scores indicated poorer per-\nformance. Everyday cognitive functioning was measured by\nthe Timed IADL Test (TIADL). On this test, participants\nperformed five tasks relevant to daily living (e.g., counting\nchange; reading food labels). Scores were the total num-\nber of seconds taken to perform all tasks, and errors were\npenalized by standardized additions to completion time as\nA dichotomous indicator for cognitive training arm was\nalso included in the analyses. It was important to consider\ncognitive training because such interventions may improve\nmobility(Ball,Edwards,&Ross,2007).Consistentwithpre-\nvious research, cognitive training was coded as 0 = control\ngroup and 1 = any training (O'Connor et al., 2010). Finally,\nstudy site was examined in relation to life-space, as com-\nmunity size and amenities may impact mobility (O'Connor,\nEdwards, Waters, Hudak, & Valdes, 2013; Rosso et al.,\n2013). Study site was dichotomized as \"0 = small cities\"\n(Birmingham and State College) and \"1 = large cities\"\n(Boston, Baltimore, Detroit, and Indianapolis).\nAnalyses\nBaseline differences between gender and racial groups were\nexamined using Chi-square tests for categorical variables\nand Independent Samples t-tests for continuous variables.\nLogistic regression was used to examine the correlates\nof life-space constriction to town at baseline. All covari-\nates described previously were included, and continuous\nvariables were standardized prior to being included in the\nmodel. Next, three Cox proportional hazard models were\nfit to examine predictors of incident life-space constriction\nto town over the 5-year follow-up period. Benefits of using\nthe Cox model are that it includes all participants in the\nanalysis, not just those who completed all years of follow-\nup. Therefore, it explicitly incorporates incomplete out-\ncome assessment through right-censoring. The first model\nwas run in the entire sample, the second was stratified by\nrace, and the third was stratified by gender. These longitu-\ndinal analyses included participants who had a life-space\nbeyond town at baseline (N = 2,095) and had completed\nfollow-up assessments (N = 1,798). Participants were coded\nas having experienced life-space constriction at any follow-\nup visit, and time-to-event was measured as the number of\nmonths between the baseline assessment and the first report\nof constriction. Those who never experienced constriction\nwere right-censored at their last follow-up. Analyses were\nconducted using SPSS v.21 statistical software, and all sta-\ntistical tests are evaluated at p < .05, two-tailed.\nResults\nBaseline characteristics are presented in Table 1.\nApproximately 76% of participants were women, 26%\nwere Black, and the average age of all participants was\n73.6 years. Most participants traveled outside of their own\nproperty or neighborhood within the last week; however,\nabout one out of five had life-space constricted to town\nor county. More than half (57%) of participants reported\nthey had not traveled outside of state, and most (80.5%)\nparticipants had not been outside of region.\nLife-Space Constriction at Baseline\nIn bivariate analyses, women were more likely to have\nlife-space constriction than men. However, after account-\ning for sociodemographic covariates etc., the relationship\nbetween gender and life-space constriction was not sig-\nnificant (odds ratio [OR]: 1.11, p > .05) (Supplementary\nMaterial). Concerning race, Blacks were more likely to\nreport constriction at all levels of life-space compared to\nWhites (Figure 1). Blacks were also more likely to live in\nlarge cities and be non-drivers. After accounting for other\ncovariates, Blacks were still more likely to have life-space\nLife-Space Constriction Over Follow-Up\nApproximately 16% (n = 203) of participants experienced\nincident life-space constriction, and 84% were right-cen-\nsored, which means not experiencing incident life-space\nconstriction during the observation period. The results for\nthe overall sample are displayed in Table 2. Women were\nmore likely to experience incident life-space constriction\nthan men (HR = 1.89, p < .01), and Blacks were less likely\nto experience incident life-space constriction than Whites\n(HR = 0.67, p < .05). Other significant predictors of inci-\ndent life-space constriction were older age, poorer IADL\nperformance, residing in/near small cities, and being a\nnon-driver.\nFindings for the models stratified by gender and race are\nshown in Table 3. Among women, significant risk factors\nincluded White race, older age, poorer self-rated health, liv-\ning in/near small cities, and being a nondriver. Among men,\nBlack race, residing in/near small cities, and being a non-\ndriver were significant risk factors for incident life-space.\nRisk factors for incident life-space constriction among\nTable 1.

Moreover, several correlates of\nincident life-space constriction also differed across gender\nand race. Notably, in this study women were more likely to\nexperience life-space constriction over time relative to men\nin their later lives even after accounting for health character-\nistics. Previous reports on travel patterns of older Americans\nindicated that women took fewer trips and traveled fewer\nmiles each day than men (Lynott & Figueiredo, 2011). This\ngender disparity in mobility can be understood in the con-\ntext of gender roles (Choi, Adams, & Kahana, 2013). The\nparticipants in our study spent their young and middle ages\nin the era when gender norms were more rigid and women\nwere often expected to stay home, spending more time on\ndomestic work than men.\nIn addition to gender disparity, salient race differences\nwere identified. Specifically, Blacks were more likely to\nhave life-space constriction at baseline, but less likely to\nexperience constriction during follow-up in comparison\nto Whites. Our findings were consistent with prior reports,\neven though these previous studies defined life-space con-\nstriction differently from this study (Barnes et al., 2007;\nSartori et al., 2012). Similar racial \"crossover\" effects have\nbeen reported for racial disparities in late-life mortality\n(Whitfield & Baker, 2013). Like the mortality crossover, the\nlife-space may be the result of additional selection pressures\non disadvantaged groups which results in premature life-\nspace constriction earlier in life, but leaves a more resilient\ngroup in later life (Mehrotra & Wagner, 2013). Our find-\nings also suggest that future research should explore the\nintersection of race and gender as they relate to the emer-\ngence of health disparities in mobility in later life.\nFindings should be interpreted in light of study strengths\nand limitations. It is important to note that the definitions of\n\"town\" may have varied among participants or by geogra-\nphy (e.g., rural vs. urban areas); however, our longitudinal\nanalysis would have accounted for these fixed characteris-\ntics. The sample sizes in the stratified groups (i.e. Blacks and\nmen) were small, which limited statistical power. The use of\nself-report measures should be noted too. However, the rela-\ntively healthy sample and longitudinal analysis allows us to\nexamine predictors of incident life-space constriction, and\nwe were able to examine and account for a wide range of\nhealth and psychosocial predictors of mobility in our models.\nIn conclusion, our findings demonstrate the utility of\nexplicitly examining the processes by which gender and\nracial disparities in mobility emerge in later life. Situating\nthis study of life-space mobility within a health disparities\nframework focuses attention on the differential processes\nthat impact functioning in later life for socially disadvan-\ntaged groups. Further research is needed to understand\nhow these processes that differentially impact functioning\nin later life work together to protect against (or exacerbate)\ndisparities in mobility limitations among older adults by\ngeographical location (urban vs. rural areas) (Meng et al.,\n2009) to provide effective community-level interventions.\nIn addition, research is warranted that will identify\nmodifiable risk factors that can be included in behavioral\nhealthcare interventions that would ultimately minimize\nFigure 1.
