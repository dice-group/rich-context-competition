It has been hypothesized that 2D:4D is a biomarker\nfor prenatal testosterone (PT) and prenatal estrogen (PE) such that 2D:4D is negatively\ncorrelated to PT and positively correlated to PE (Manning, 2002, 2011; Manning et al.,\n1998). The evidence for this hypothesis has been reported in both correlational and\nexperimental studies. With regard to the former, individuals with congenital adrenal\nhyperplasia (a trait associated with high prenatal androgen) tend to have low\n\"masculinized\" 2D:4D (for meta-analysis, see H\u00f6nekopp and Watson, 2010). In contrast,\nKlinefelter's men (individuals with XXY sex chromosomes), who have low prenatal\ntestosterone, show high \"feminized\" 2D:4D (Manning et al., 2013). In addition, XY\nindividuals who are partly or completely insensitive to androgen have mean 2D:4D that is\nsimilar to that of females (Berenbaum, Bryk, Nowak, Quigley, and Moffat, 2009). With\nregard to experimental evidence, in rodents the administration of in utero testosterone or\nthe blocking of estrogen receptors has been shown to lower 2D:4D, whereas administration\nof estrogen or blocking androgen receptors increases 2D:4D (Talarovicova, Krskova, and\nBlazekova, 2009; Zheng and Cohn, 2011). Further examination of these and related data\nsuggests that 2D:4D is fixed in a narrow prenatal window of development and is linked to\nthe activation of \"skeletogenic\" genes by sex steroids. The skeletogenic genes, some 20 in\nnumber, have multiple additional functions which include the morphogenesis of the\nreproductive organs and the brain (Lawrance-Owen, Bargary, Bosten, Goodbourn, and\nThese findings provide compelling evidence that 2D:4D is negatively related to PT\nand positively related to PE, such that it reflects both sensitivity to sex steroids and the\nconcentration of prenatal sex steroids (Manning, 2011). However, there remains a debate\non whether small gradations in 2D:4D are closely correlated to individual levels of PT and\nPE. For instance, Hampson and Sankar (2012) suggested that the correlation between\n2D:4D and sensitivity to testosterone is not substantial, whereas Van Honk and colleagues\nhave reported that very small gradations in 2D:4D strongly moderates the influence of\nexperimentally-administered testosterone on empathy (van Honk et al., 2011), co-operation\n(van Honk, Montoya, Bos, van Vugt, and Terburg, 2012), and moral judgments (Montoya\net al., 2013) in women. To our knowledge, no experiment has been undertaken to examine\nthe relationship between 2D:4D and aggression in men and, in particular, whether this\nrelationship may be explained by fluctuating testosterone levels.\nAggression in humans is strongly sex dependent, such that men tend to show more\nsame-sex physical aggression compared to women (e.g., Campbell and Muncer, 2008).\nTherefore, this would suggest that 2D:4D is negatively related to physical aggression.\nHowever, such a relationship is controversial. The first examination of the association\nreported that 2D:4D did not correlate with aggression (Austin, Manning, McInroy, and\nMathews, 2002). Subsequent studies have reported both significant and non-significant\nfindings in links between 2D:4D and aggression. For example, Hurd, Vaillancourt, and\nDinsdale (2011) found a significant negative relationship between 2D:4D and physical\n2D:4D, aggression, and testosterone\naggression in a sample of Canadian men, but Butovskaya et al. (2012) reported no\nassociation between 2D:4D and physical aggression in a sample of Hadza men. A recent\nmeta-analysis (H\u00f6nekopp and Watson, 2011) has not resolved these differences, reporting\nonly a small but significant, negative relationship between 2D:4D and aggression in men\n(r = -0.06). These discrepancies in the literature concerning 2D:4D and aggression in men\nmay be resolved, to some extent, if aggression is influenced by testosterone induced by an\naggressive challenge and such influence is additionally moderated by 2D:4D.\nThere is evidence for an aggression-testosterone-2D:4D link in the presence of a\nchallenge. Millet and Dewitte (2007) reported no relationship between 2D:4D and physical\nor provoked aggression in a sample of 45 men, but a significant negative correlation with\nboth physical and provoked aggression, and 2D:4D was noted immediately after exposure\nto an aggressive video. Although testosterone was not measured in this study, there are\nreports of increases in testosterone after watching an aggressive video clip (e.g., Cook and\nCrewther, 2012; also see Millet, 2010 for general discussion of the link between aggressive\nstimuli and testosterone production), which, in turn, may influence the expression of such\nbehaviors as aggression. Furthermore, a study of Italian football players in \"Series A\"\nshowed low 2D:4D and high testosterone were linked to the number of fouls during games\n(Perciavalle et al., 2013). This correlation is to be expected if low 2D:4D predicts high\nphysical aggression during the challenge of a competitive game of football. Therefore,\nstudies that address any association between 2D:4D and aggression would benefit from\nexperimentally manipulating testosterone levels using a \"challenge\" stimulus such as an\naggressive video.\nIn this study, we examined the relationship between 2D:4D, testosterone\nresponsiveness, and provoked aggression in men in relation to an aggressive video\nstimulus. We manipulated testosterone levels by exposing the participants to an aggressive\nchallenge video and also a control video. Aggression was measured after each video and\nfree testosterone was measured before and after exposure to each video. Our working\nhypothesis was that the aggressive video would raise testosterone levels and, in this\ncontext, 2D:4D would be negatively related to aggression. In contrast, we expected\ntestosterone would not be raised by the control video and, in this context, 2D:4D would not\nbe associated with aggression.\nMaterials and Methods\nWe broadly followed the protocol of Millet and Dewitte (2007) and considered their\nmeasure of provoked aggression as the outcome variable.\nParticipants\nParticipants were recruited from male students and staff of a UK University. The\nsample (as in Millet and Dewitte, 2007) comprised 45 Caucasian men with a mean age of\n24.27 (SD = 7.72) years. Most participants were from the UK. Each participant had the\nprotocols explained to them and signed informed consent before the study commenced.\nEthical approval was provided by a local University Ethics Committee.\n2D:4D, aggression, and testosterone\nProtocols\nA randomized experimental study with a cross-over design was used to address the\nstudy's hypotheses. All participants were assessed between the hours of 10am and 4pm,\nwith subsequent assessments made at the same time of day for each individual. After\narriving at the testing facility, each participant was asked to provide a saliva sample and\nwas then exposed to either an aggressive video (a rugby haka plus rugby tackles) or a\ncontrol video (a blank screen), both of which had a duration of 4 minutes. A haka is a\nritualized display which is a traditional war dance or challenge of the Maori people. It is\nperformed before national New Zealand rugby matches. Our recent work demonstrated an\nacute rise in free testosterone levels with this type of aggressive stimulus (Cook and\nCrewther, 2012). We checked the effectiveness of the manipulation in each participant by\nasking: (i) \"To what extent has physical aggression been shown in the video?\" and (ii)\n\"How aggressive does this video look in general?\" Both questions were scored out of 100\nfor effectiveness (0 = not effective; 100 = highly effective). A second saliva sample was\ncollected 15 minutes after exposure to the video to coincide with the testosterone surges\nreported elsewhere (Cook and Crewther, 2012). Due to experimental constraints, the videos\nwere shown on a large video screen and presented to participants in small groups (1-4).\nThere were no interactions between participants while watching the video footage, or\nduring the short period after, to ensure minimal effects of the social environment on the\nhormonal and behaviour measures. The aggressive video was watched without any sound.\nAfter viewing the aggressive or control video, the participants were presented with\nfive situations from the aggression provocation questionnaire used by Millet and Dewitte\n(2007). For each situation, participants were asked to rate on a five-point Likert scale (1\nbeing lowest, 5 being highest) how angry, irritated, and frustrated they would feel in each\nsituation. The testing procedure was repeated, after a period of approximately one week,\nwhen the participant was exposed to whichever video they previously had not seen.\nAt the completion of the first video exposure, the ventral surface of the participant's\nhands was photocopied. In order to minimize possible distortion of the fingertips by\npressure on the glass plate of the photocopier, all participants were asked to gently place\ntheir hand on the glass plate. All photocopies were checked to ensure the finger tips were\nnot flattened and that the finger creases were clearly displayed. Measurement of finger\nlength was from the finger crease proximal to the palm to the tip of the finger using vernier\nSaliva collection and hormone analysis\nSaliva was collected by passive drool into sterile containers, approximately 2 ml\nover a timed collection period of 2 minutes. The samples were subsequently stored at -30\u00b0\nC until assay. After thawing and centrifugation (2000 rpm x 10 minutes), the saliva samples\nwere analyzed in duplicate for testosterone concentrations using commercial kits\n(Salimetrics LLC, USA) and the manufacturers' guidelines. The minimum detection limit\nfor the T assay was 6.1 pg/ml, with inter-assay coefficients of variation (CV) of < 9.7%.\n2D:4D, aggression, and testosterone\nResults\nThe repeatability (ICC) of the first and second measurement of 2D:4D was high and\nsignificantly greater than measurement error. Mean 2D:4D was calculated for right (0.949\nConsidering the manipulation, we calculated a mean of the two manipulation\nchecks. Ratings for aggressive content were high for the aggressive video (79.87[11.67])\nand very low for the control video (0.91 [1.55]). The difference was significant, t(45) =\nWith regard to the aggression provocation questionnaire, we calculated a composite\nscore for provoked aggressive tendency after the aggressive video and after the control\nvideo (PAT: aggressive video condition PATaggress\nConsidering the testosterone levels associated with the aggressive video, mean\ntestosterone was higher after the video (156.92 [59.45] pg/ml) in comparison to before the\nsignificant (one-sample t-test mean set at zero, t = 1.81, p = 0.08).\nIn contrast to the aggressive video, the testosterone levels associated with the\nManipulation effects and provoked aggression tendency\nThe perceived magnitude of aggression reported in the manipulation check did not\ncorrelate with PATaggress\n(r = 0.19, p = 0.21). Also the difference between the manipulation\nscore for the aggressive and control conditions did not correlate with the difference in\nPATaggress\n- PATcontrol\nDigit ratio, testosterone and provoked aggression tendency\nWith regard to the aggressive video condition, 2D:4D was negatively related to\nPATaggress\nright 2D:4D (r = -0.23, p = 0.13). We checked this finding by applying a more conservative\ntest for correlation, i.e., the Spearman correlation test, and again found a significant\nassociation for left 2D:4D (rs\n= 1.46, p = 0.14). There were no associations between testosterone and PATaggress\ntestosterone after video \u00ad testosterone before video: r = 0.02, p = 0.88).\nWe considered the relationship between left 2D:4D, PATaggress\n, and testosterone\nfurther by performing a multiple regression analysis with dependent variable PATaggress\nand\nindependent variables left 2D:4D, change in testosterone (testosterone after video \u00ad\ntestosterone before video), and the interaction between left 2D:4D and change in\ntestosterone. We found that left 2D:4D was no longer significantly related to PATaggress\n2D:4D, aggression, and testosterone\nrelated to PATaggress\n2D:4D, there was no significant relationship with PATaggress\nFigure 1.

In this instance, Spearman correlation tests showed that both left 2D:4D\nand right 2D:4D were significantly negatively related to PATaggress\n-PATcontrol\nrs\nFigure 2.

The relationships between left 2D:4D and PATaggress - PATcontrol in 45 men\nPAT aggress\nPAT aggress\n- PAT control\n2D:4D, aggression, and testosterone\nDiscussion\nThis study gave the following key results: (i) With regard to the aggressive video,\nthis was associated with a marginally significant increase in testosterone levels. In addition,\naggression levels were significantly greater after the aggressive video compared to after the\ncontrol video (i.e., PATaggress\n> PATcontrol\n). Left 2D:4D was significantly and negatively\ncorrelated to PATaggress\n(product-moment and Spearman correlations). A multiple\nregression showed testosterone increase was positively related to PATaggress\nand there was a\nsignificant interaction of left 2D:4D*change in testosterone. Considering a median split of\ntestosterone change, we found that among individuals with increased testosterone there was\na strong negative correlation between left 2D:4D and PATaggress\n(product-moment and\nSpearman correlations) (ii) The control video did not have any impact on testosterone\nlevels. There were no significant correlations between left and right 2D:4D and PATcontrol\n.\n(iii) Considering differences between the aggressive and control conditions, left 2D:4D\n(product-moment and Spearman correlations) and right 2D:4D (Spearman correlation only)\ncorrelated negatively with the difference between PATaggress\nand PATcontrol\n.\nOur results replicate those of Millet and Dewitte (2007), in that we found a\nsignificant negative correlation between 2D:4D and aggression after an aggressive\nstimulus. The effect was related to an increase in testosterone concentrations, insofar as it\nwas greatest in the sub-group that showed the greatest increase in testosterone. This\nsuggests that low 2D:4D men are likely to show high aggression in conditions of challenge\n(such as aggressive encounters, including aggressive sports), which is consistent with the\nchallenge hypothesis. Most of the significant associations we found were for left 2D:4D. In\ngeneral, 2D:4D correlations with target traits tend to be strongest for right 2D:4D.\nHowever, for links with sports performance the left 2D:4D is of equal importance\n(H\u00f6nekopp and Schuster, 2010). Performance in sports involves a challenge which may be\nsimilar to an aggressive situation. This may explain the link with left 2D:4D and aggression\nin our findings. There was no correlation between 2D:4D and aggression after the control\nvideo. This suggests that in the absence of an aggressive challenge a low 2D:4D is not a\nstrong biomarker for aggression. Thus, with regard to the relationship between 2D:4D and\naggression, it is possible to see negative or null correlations, as have been reported by Hurd\net al. (2010) and Butovskaya et al. (2012). The former is likely if most of the study\nparticipants have recently been exposed to a challenge, whereas the latter is likely if there\nwas no preceding challenge in most participants.\nThe finding of a link between low 2D:4D and aggression in challenge conditions\nmay be explained by two underlying mechanisms:\nFirstly: 2D:4D and sensitivity to testosterone. Low 2D:4D is thought to be a marker\nfor testosterone levels in the fetus and also sensitivity to testosterone in the fetus and adult.\nTherefore, a spike in testosterone may lead to an increase in aggression, and this would be\nparticularly seen in low 2D:4D men. Is low 2D:4D linked to high sensitivity to\ntestosterone? Sensitivity to testosterone is partly dependent on allelic variation in the\nandrogen receptor gene (AR). Within the terminal domain of the AR is a polymorphic\nregion with a variable number of CAG repeats. Low CAGn is associated with high\nsensitivity to testosterone. Therefore, spikes in testosterone may elicit a greater effect in\n2D:4D, aggression, and testosterone\nthose individuals with low CAGn, and in men with low 2D:4D if the latter is linked to low\nCAGn. However, the correlational evidence for a link between low 2D:4D and low CAGn\nis mixed. The prediction is that 2D:4D is positively correlated with CAGn. With regard to\nstudies of aggression, a positive association between 2D:4D and CAGn was found for left\nby Butovskaya et al. (2012), but not by Hurd et al. (2011). Regarding general population\nsamples, Manning, Bundred, Newton, and Flanagan (2003) reported a significant positive\nmen. Loehlin, Medland, and Martin (2012) failed to replicate this, but did report a\nsignificant positive relationship between left 2D:4D and CAGn (p = 0.04) in women.\nKnickmeyer, Woolson, Hamer, Konneker, and Gilmore (2011), as well as Hampson and\nSankar (2012), reported no association between low 2D:4D and low CAGn. However, the\nformer found that high neonatal testosterone levels plus low CAGn in infants together\npredicted low 2D:4D, whereas the latter reported no interaction between testosterone and\nCAGn in adults. Finally, Folland, McCauley, Phypers, Hanson, and Mastana (2012)\nreported positive but non-significant associations between 2D:4D and CAGn in left and\nright hands. It is important to note that all these studies are correlational in nature.\nHowever, three experimental studies have shown that 2D:4D is a marker for subtle\nvariations in sensitivity to testosterone, with the digit ratio found to be a strong modulator\nof the effect of administered testosterone on empathy (van Honk et al., 2011), cooperation\nSecondly: 2D:4D, challenge and testosterone production. There is little evidence to\nsupport the view that 2D:4D is correlated with circulating levels of testosterone in general\npopulation samples (e.g., Muller et al., 2011). However, 2D:4D may predict testosterone\nproduction immediately after a \"challenge.\" For example, Kilduff et al. (2013) have\nreported that low right 2D:4D (relative to left 2D:4D) predicts high testosterone production\nafter a physical challenge (a repeated sprint test). In the sporting domain, there have been a\nnumber of reports of links between low 2D:4D and high performance in men (e.g., football:\nManning and Taylor, 2001; rowing: Longman, Stock, and Wells, 2011; rugby: Bennett,\nManning, Cook, and Kilduff, 2010). We suggest that under challenge, men with low 2D:4D\nshow a combination of sensitivity to testosterone and a tendency to produce high levels of\ntestosterone. This combination may underlie the behavioral and physiological attributes\n(such as high aggression and VO2max; see Hill, Simpson, Millet, Manning, and Kilduff,\n2012) associated with sports success. Further work may show that, under challenge, 2D:4D\nis a powerful predictor of abilities that are useful in aggressive and sports contests and\ndominance behaviors. These may include visuo-spatial perception and judgment of the\nemotional state of opponents.\nIn conclusion, we have found an aggressive video was associated with raised\naggression responses and marginally significant increases in testosterone. Left hand 2D:4D\nwas negatively correlated with aggression after the aggressive video and this correlation\nwas stronger in those participants with the highest increase in testosterone. Left 2D:4D was\nalso negatively correlated to the difference between aggression scores in the aggressive and\ncontrol conditions, such that participants with high aggression in the former compared to\nthe latter also had low 2D:4D. We conclude that 2D:4D moderates the impact of an\n2D:4D, aggression, and testosterone\naggressive stimulus on aggression, such that an increase in testosterone is associated with a\nnegative correlation between 2D:4D and aggression.\n"
