    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe phenomenon of substance abuse during pregnancy has fostered much controversy, specifically\nregarding treatment vs. punishment. Should the pregnant mother who engages in substance abuse\nbe viewed as a criminal or as someone suffering from an illness requiring appropriate treatment?\nAs it happens, there is a noticeably wide range of responses to this matter in the various states of\nthe United States, ranging from a strictly criminal perspective to one that does emphasize the\nimportance of the mother's treatment. This diversity of dramatically different responses illustrates\nthe failure to establish a uniform policy for the management of this phenomenon. Just as there is\nlack of consensus among those who favor punishment, the same lack of consensus characterizes\nthose states espousing treatment. Several general policy recommendations are offered here\naddressing the critical issues. It is hoped that by focusing on these fundamental issues and ultimately\ndetailing statistics, policymakers throughout the United States will consider the course of action\nthat views both pregnant mother and fetus/child as humanely as possible.\nOverview and nature of the problem\n",

As a review, this is a systematic\nanalysis of existing data (findings) on maternal drug use\nduring pregnancy for determining the best policy among\nthe alternatives for dealing with drug using mothers and\ntheir children. We will address issues of efficacy (which\npolicies work?), economics (how much does it cost?) and\npolitics (who is it for or against?). For new policies we will\nalso consider how they fit with existing policies or laws,\nthe social impact, ethical issues and the feasibility of\nimplementation and administration.\nThe issue of substance abuse is one that has perpetually\nplagued society. The complexities surrounding addiction\nare not easily overcome. These complexities are even more\ndefined in cases of substance abuse by pregnant women,\nan issue that has been pushed to the forefront of the pub-\nlic consciousness over the course of the past 20 years.\nMaternal prenatal substance abuse is defined as chronic\nuse of alcohol and/or other drugs [1]. The acronym AOD\nis often used to describe the generic problem of alcohol\nand other drugs. However, AOD is not specific to mothers\nand includes both prenatal and postnatal use as well as\nuse by men. This review will encompass the three main\ntypes of addictive substances used during pregnancy: alco-\nhol, tobacco and illegal drugs (ATID). Maternal Alcohol,\nTobacco and Illegal Drugs (MATID) will be used to\ndescribe maternal use of these substances during preg-\nnancy that threatens the well being of the child.\nThis article is available from: http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5\n\u00a9 2004 Lester et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

One of the\ngoals of this review is to see how what we learned from the\ncocaine controversy can be applied to issues arising from\nabuse of other (legal and illegal) drugs. The review will\naddress policies on several levels including federal, state,\nand local public policies. Legal and ethical issues will also\nbe considered. As this article goes to press, the U.S.\nSupreme Court has declined to hear the case of a South\nCarolina woman convicted of murder homicide by child\nabuse after her stillborn baby was found with cocaine in\nits system. This case could have major policy implications\nfor the treatment of drug using mothers and for the inter-\npretation of child abuse charges.\nBackground\nThe sensationalistic coverage of the \"crack epidemic\" in\nthe mid-1980s focused national attention on the relation-\nship between drug use, and the social and economic con-\nditions that plagued our society. These include poverty,\nviolent crime, overcrowded prisons, hospital emergency\nrooms overcrowded with drug related violence and ill-\nness, homelessness and sexually transmitted diseases [2].\nAbout 11 percent of the adult population of the United\nStates suffers from a substance abuse problem (AOD) dur-\ning the course of a year [3]. That figure increases to 28% if\nwe include substance abuse or mental health disorders,\nwhich are often inseparable [3]. Of the 10 leading causes\nof disability worldwide in 1990, five were psychiatric con-\nditions including AOD [3]. The cost to society of drug use\nincluding crime, health care and reduced work productiv-\nity was estimated at over 300 billion dollars annually [4].\nIn 1997, the total expenditure for treatment of substance\nabuse was $11.9 billion in contrast to the social costs of\n$294 billion estimated for that year [3]. In addition, sub-\nstance abuse is a contributing factor in child abuse and\nneglect cases for 40% or more of the 1.2 million annual\nconfirmed cases of child maltreatment [5] and in 40\u00ad80%\nof families involved with the child welfare system [6]. The\npresence of substance use disorders in parents increases\nthe risk of child maltreatment threefold or more [7,8].\nThese children are also at substantial risk of placement in\nout-of-home care [9].\nDrug use in this country is not a recent phenomenon.\nLegal use of opiates in America has a 200-year-old history\nand cocaine has been around since the 1870s. Illicit drug\nuse by women is also not new. By the end of the 19th cen-\ntury, almost two thirds of the nation's opium and mor-\nphine addicts were women [2]. The issue of drug use\nduring pregnancy garnered the national spotlight starting\nin the 1960's when public attention began to focus on the\npossible harm to the unborn child. Less than 15 years after\nChuck Yaeger shattered the sound barrier, several events\ncombined to shatter the placental barrier \u00ad the notion that\nthe fetus was protected and even invulnerable. The pla-\ncental \"barrier\" suddenly became quite porous. The\nrubella (German measles) epidemic and, in particular, the\ntragedies caused by two drugs, thalidomide and diethyl-\nstilbestrol (DES), amplified public sentiment about the\nneed for protecting the fetus from risks from drug use.\nThalidomide was approved for marketing in 1958 and\nwas used primarily as a sedative and antidote for nausea\nin early pregnancy. By 1962, evidence showed that a rare\nset of deformities, mostly limb malformations, were\ncaused by the drug and 8,000 children had been affected\n[10]. DES was a synthetic hormone prescribed in the\nand 1970s, the side effects of the drug became known: the\ndaughters of women who had taken DES during preg-\nnancy developed a rare adrenocarcinoma of the vagina.\nLicit and illicit drugs became suspect as possible tera-\ntogens, and the activities, diet and behaviors of pregnant\nwomen have been under close scrutiny ever since [11].\nAs the country was coping with these events in the early\nbegan to describe the effects of fetal alcohol syndrome\n(FAS) including dysmorphic features, growth retardation,\ncentral nervous system problems, long term retardation\nand developmental delays [16]. One response was the\n1989 federal law that required warnings on all alcohol-\ncontaining beverages about the risk of birth defects. Also\nin the 1970s, research documented child outcome associ-\nated with opiate addiction in pregnant women including\nwithdrawal effects in infants exposed to heroin or metha-\ndone [17,18]. There is currently a resurgence of heroin use\ndue to the introduction of a cheap, smokeable and more\npure form comparable to crack cocaine but more potent.\nMaternal prenatal substance abuse became an issue for\npublic health debate in the mid-1980s when the price of\ncocaine dropped, and a smokeable form, \"crack\" became\nwidely available. The heightened attention came in\nresponse to the emergence of a perceived crack epidemic\nand their infants were labeled, \"crack babies\" [1]. Cocaine\nis a special case because it riveted our attention of the\nproblem of drug use by pregnant women, it became a\nmoral as well as a public health issue and has forever\nchanged the way we think about substance use by preg-\nnant women.\nCocaine has a long history of use in this country. It was\nfirst introduced in the 1880s as a wonder drug. Doctors\nhailed its ability to counteract melancholy, or depression.\nIt was made readily available to the public as a treatment\nfor sinusitis and hay fever. It was used in soft drinks such\nas Coca-Cola until 1900. Upon its first introduction it was\nused as a panacea for all that ailed people. However by\nHarm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5\n(page number not for citation purposes)\n1910 there were numerous proposals for laws against its\nuse because of its association with violence, paranoia, and\ncollapsed careers [19].\nBy 1980, the United States had entered another period of\nwidespread use of the drug. There are several reasons why\ncrack was very popular at the time. These reasons include\nthe fact that it is smoked rather than injected, it was a\ncheap high after the 1980s cocaine price plunge, and it\nof Representatives, Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse\nand Control and Select Committee on Children, Youth,\nand Families defined the widespread use of cocaine as a\ncrisis. The testimony of the Honorable Charles Rangel\nduring the committee hearing on \"The Crack Cocaine Cri-\nsis\" epitomized the feelings of lawmakers of the time.\nAccording to Judge Rangel, \"Cocaine is threatening the\nvitality of the generation of Americans we are counting on\nto lead us into the 21st century...The crack epidemic is part\nof the overall cocaine abuse problem in America. This\nproblem will continue as long as... the Administration\nand State Department view the international drug prob-\nlem as \"business as usual.\" Only when we give the drug\nproblem the foreign policy priority it deserves will we ever\nbegin to get a handle on the cocaine crisis sweeping our\ncotics Penalties and Enforcement Act, imposing severe\npenalties on any person convicted of either possessing or\ndistributing cocaine [22].\nThe war(s) on dugs\nThere is a long history of legislative intervention and con-\ntrol over the use of those drugs deemed dangerous. The\ndrug war is the name conventionally given to the efforts of\nthe Regan and Bush administrations against the wide-\nspread availability and use of illicit drugs in the United\nfourth such war: Sustained legislative and governmental\nment of addicts and prevention but the emphasis has\nbeen on law enforcement; control at the source, interdic-\ntion, arrest, prosecution, imprisonment and seizure of\nassets. Even in the 19th century the United States\nattempted to prevent acute poisoning by implementing\nregulations that called for the labeling of certain sub-\nstances that might be purchased in ignorance of their\nlethal potential or might be too easily available for sui-\ncide. During this time, Americans bought whatever types\nof drugs they wanted over the counter or through mail\norder catalogs. Doctors regularly prescribed morphine\nand opium to their patients as the primary pain control\nIn response to consumer demand, Congress passed the\nPure Food and Drug Act of 1906. This act mandated cor-\nrect labeling. Any \"patent medicine\" had to reveal on the\nlabel whether it contained morphine, cocaine, cannabis,\nor chloral hydrate. The act simply required that consum-\ners be informed that the drugs were present. It made no\nattempt to regulate the purchase of the drug or how much\nof the drug could be included in substances [19]. The\ncountry's drug policy changed with the 1914 passage of\nthe Harrison Anti-Narcotic Act and with Supreme Court\ndecisions, [24,25] which allowed new drug fighting poli-\ncies. When it took effect in 1919, the law outlawed the\nmaintenance of addicts on prescription narcotic medica-\ntion. It also empowered the federal government to take\nnationwide action to arrest and convict health profession-\nals who practiced maintenance of narcotic-addicted\npatients. A few months later in 1919, the Volstead Act\nwidened the \"no maintenance\" policy to alcohol. The act\nmade drinking alcoholic beverages illegal [22].\nThe emphasis on drug interdiction and policing has\nresulted in an increase in the national drug budget over\nthe last 20\u00ad25 years. According to the Office of National\nDrug Control Policy, Federal spending on drug control\nControl Budget earmarked for prevention and treatment\nhas remained relatively stable at approximately 33%. The\nfunds covered by this 33% include drug abuse treatment,\ndrug abuse prevention, and prevention research and treat-\nment research. Approximately 10% is spent on research\nand approximately 1 1/2 times more is spent on drug\nabuse treatment than on drug abuse prevention. Treat-\nment alone accounts for only 15% of the budget. Given\nthat research has shown that treatment and prevention are\neffective, one wonders why these proportions of the\nNational Drug Control Budget have not been increased.\nThe drug control budget has more than doubled in the\npast decade, yet the proportion of the budget devoted to\ntreatment and prevention is unchanged, despite the gains\nmade in science.\nIt is also interesting to contrast Federal spending with\nStates spending on drug abuse. A recently released study\n(Shoveling Up: The Impact of Substance Abuse on State\ndollars on substance abuse and addiction representing\nIn contrast to the Federal budget in which 66% of the\nbudget is spent on enforcement, the State budgets spent\n38% on justice with other funds spent on education\nmental health and developmental disabilities (7.5%).\nHarm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nEpidemiology and prevalence rates\nNumerous attempts to answer the question of the preva-\nlence of prenatal exposure have been made reflecting a\nvariety of definitions, sampling procedures and drug use\ndetection procedures [11]. Settings vary and include hos-\npitals, public health clinics and prenatal practices. Sam-\npling includes the country as a whole, entire states as well\nas individual counties. Drug use is typically detected by\nmaternal report, history or urine testing. The National\nPregnancy and Health Survey (NPHS) was designed to\nprovide a nationally representative sample of live births in\nalence for use of any illicit drug during pregnancy was\nself-report and urine in a subset of this sample suggested\nunderreporting in the use of cocaine.\nThe National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA)\nbased on interviews with 66,706 persons. The NHSDA\nestimated that among women 15 to 44 years old, rates of\ncurrent use of alcohol, tobacco and illicit drugs 1999 were\ndrug use between pregnant and non-pregnant women.\nreported using illicit drugs. This was significantly lower\nthan the rate among non-pregnant women age 15\u00ad44\nyears (8.1%). For example, cocaine is .2% for pregnant\nbut .9% for non-pregnant. Methamphetamine is scary\nbecause it is the only illicit drug that does not have a lower\nrate for pregnant (.2%) than for non-pregnant women\ntobacco, and alcohol, indicating that a large number of\nwomen continued their substance use during pregnancy.\nmates of substance use during pregnancy, the approxi-\nmate numbers of births in 1999 complicated by maternal\npublic health perspective, the impact of substance use\nduring pregnancy extends far beyond maternal health to\nthat of a large number of the unborn population.\nThere is also overlap between licit and illicit drugs.\nApproximately 32% of women who use illicit drugs dur-\ning pregnancy also use alcohol and cigarettes [30]. From\nthese estimates it has been suggested that approximately 1\nmillion children each year are exposed to legal or illegal\nsubstances (i.e. MATID) during gestation [31]. It is also\nimportant to point out that the NHSDA is based on self-\nreport of drug use and therefore likely to underestimate\nthe extent of prenatal drug exposure. Just as with other\ndrugs, it is very difficult to isolate the true prevalence of\nprenatal cocaine use among pregnant women because\nprevalence rates are often dependent on self-reporting by\nthe women. In a study by Vega and colleagues in the early\nexpectant mothers used cocaine within 12 to 72 hours of\nlabor and delivery [32]. The lack of true prevalence rates\ncan also be attributed to the lack of focus on those groups\nthat are considered to be \"low-risk\" for drug use, e.g. mid-\ndle class, non-minority populations.\nThere are groups considered high risk based upon patterns\nof use. Cocaine use is especially concentrated among poor\nwomen of color. In the Vega et al. [32] study, it was found\nthat 7.8 percent of African Americans compared with 0.55\npercent of Hispanics and 0.60 percent of Caucasians\ntested positive for cocaine use. This figure became even\nmore pronounced when looking at subgroups of poor\nwomen. Nearly 1/3 of unmarried pregnant African Amer-\nican Medicaid recipients in their mid-thirties tested posi-\ntive for cocaine [33].\nTable 1: Drug Use by Pregnant and Non-Pregnant Women in the United States (1999)\nDrug Non-Pregnant Pregnant\nHeroin .1 *\nHarm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nMethods of identification of drug using women\nThe accurate identification of prenatal drug exposure is\nimportant not only to understand the nature and magni-\ntude of the problem, but also to determine appropriate\nmedical and psychosocial intervention. The prevalence of\nprenatal drug exposure is very difficult to estimate because\nof flaws in all methods of identification. Methods vary\nand include interview, self-administered questionnaires,\nintake history, urine testing of mother and infant, testing\nof infant hair and meconium (first stool of the newborn).\nMaternal self-report of drug use is problematic because of\nthe fear of the consequences of admitting to the use of\ndrugs such as Child Protective Services (CPS) involvement\nand the threat of child removal, or because it is socially\nunacceptable. Self-report is also unreliable because of the\ninaccuracy of recall, especially when questions such as\n\"when\", \"how often\" and \"how much\" are asked. Under-\nreporting of drug use by pregnant women has been\nreported in several studies [34-37]. In a sample in which\n43% of mothers were positive for illegal drugs during\npregnancy, only 11% admitted illegal drug use [35]. Frank\nfound that self-report misclassified 24% of cocaine users\nidentified by urine toxicology, and in Lester et al, [34]\n38% of mothers denied cocaine or opiate use during preg-\nnancy but the infant's meconium was positive.\nInfant biomarkers of in-utero exposure to illegal and legal\ndrugs including cocaine, opiates, amphetamines, mari-\njuana and nicotine, are available from different speci-\nmens. Although urine has been the widely used specimen,\nincreasing evidence suggests that meconium is preferable\nable in urine for only 96\u00ad120 hours after the last cocaine\nuse in contrast to meconium, which can detect cocaine\nuse throughout the second half of pregnancy. The primary\nmetabolite of nicotine is cotinine and can be measured in\nurine and meconium. Cotinine is also readily passed from\nmother to infant, with fetal cotinine concentrations in\npregnant smokers reaching approximately 90% of mater-\nnal values during pregnancy [45]. A recent assay has been\ndeveloped for detecting alcohol in meconium using fatty\nacid ethyl esters [46]. Hair analysis can also be used to\ndetect drugs, and like meconium has the advantage of\nreflecting more than recent use [47].\nIn addition to the choice of specimen, the accurate detec-\ntion of prenatal drug exposure is influenced by the choice\nof initial screening test and use of a confirmation proce-\ndure. Moore et al. [48] found a 43% false positive rate for\ncocaine when screens were used without confirmation.\nGas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the\nforensic standard for confirmation of presumptive posi-\ntive screens. Lester et al. [34] confirmed 75% of presump-\ntive positive screens for cocaine using GC/MS in a sample\nthat would have incorrectly identified had we relied on a\nscreen alone. Choice of metabolites can also affect accu-\nracy of identification. We [34] used four metabolites for\ncocaine, and one of them, HBE, was the only metabolite\nfound in 235 of the cases. Finally, some drugs are more\ndifficult to detect than others. Even with GC/MS we were\nonly able to confirm 36% of the presumptive positives for\nmarijuana.\nThe advantage of using both drug toxicology and mater-\nnal self-report has been shown in several studies\nbetween maternal reports based on a structured question-\nnaire and information collected about the mother from\nmedical record review as the latter is less reliable, and may\nnot be appropriate for comparison with toxicology\nresults. The importance of using both a biomarker (pref-\nerably meconium) and maternal self-report is to identify\nmothers who deny use but did use as evidence by positive\nGC/MS confirmation. It is generally assumed that moth-\ners will not report that they used drugs if they did not.\nFinally, it would not be wise to rely only on meconium, as\nthis assay is only valid for the second half of pregnancy.\nAgreement between positive maternal report and positive\nexpected because infants of mothers who report that they\nused cocaine, but not in the second half of pregnancy, will\nhave a negative meconium for appropriate reasons.\nResearch on prenatal MATID exposure and child outcome\nMATID use during pregnancy is a major public health\nissue and a social policy concern because of the possible\nadverse effect or harm to the developing child caused by\nthe chemical effect of the drug, i.e., the drug as a toxin. The\nbest documentation of this effect is for alcohol. The tera-\ntogenic effects of alcohol are well established. The brain is\nparticularly vulnerable with documented sites of damage\nincluding the cerebellum, hippocampus, basal ganglia\nand corpus collosum [52-54]. One study estimated that\napproximately 2.6 million women of 4 million who give\nbirth each year use alcohol at some point during their\nschool age children per year experience adverse affects\ncaused by their mother's alcohol use [55]. One of the\nmost widely chronicled problems attributed to alcohol\nuse is fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). FAS was first\ndescribed in the published medical literature in 1968 and\nrefers to a constellation of physical abnormalities. FAS\nproduces slow growth, damage to the nervous system,\nfacial abnormalities and mental retardation. It is most\nobvious in the features of the face and in the reduced size\nof the newborn, and in problems of behavior and cogni-\ntion in children born to mothers who drank heavily dur-\ning pregnancy. Rates of FAS range from .5 to 3 cases per\nHarm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nFAS is caused by prenatal exposure to high levels of alco-\nhol; however, the definition of \"high\" is not specific. For\nexample, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) definition\nincludes terms such as \"substantial, regular intake or\nheavy episodic drinking\" as well as associated alcohol\nrelated effects, behaviors and problems but these terms\nare not defined. Heavy drinking by pregnant women has\nbeen estimated at less than 1%. (IOM).\nIn addition to FAS, there are children who do not show\nthe facial dysmorphology of FAS but who do show deficits\non a wide variety of neurobehavioral measures. Different\nlabels have been used to describe this heterogeneous\ngroup including fetal alcohol effects (FAE) and alcohol-\nrelated neuro-developmental disabilities (ARND).\nARND/FAE may reflect more moderate levels of alcohol\nexposure as well as some degree of uncertainly about\nwhether alcohol or other factors was the causal agent\n(IOM). Alcohol has the potential to produce milder prob-\nlems such as mental and behavioral problems as well [56]\nand these may also be due to FAE/ARND.\nThe IOM report concludes that FAS is arguably the most\ncommon known non-genetic cause of mental retardation.\nThey also conclude that FAS and ARND are a completely\npreventable set of birth defects and neurodevelopmental\nabnormalities. We would argue that the latter is true for\nthe consequences of tobacco and illegal drugs as well.\nTobacco is another legal drug that can have adverse effects\non fetuses. Cigarette smoking is the largest single risk fac-\ntor for premature death among adults in developed coun-\ntries, causing over 500,000 deaths per year, or one in every\n5 deaths. Currently, there are 57 million cigarette smokers\nin the United States \u00ad roughly one quarter of the adult\npopulation. The majority of smokers fall between 18 \u00ad 25\nyears of age; 37% of people in this age range are smokers\n[57,58]. Cigarette smoking is correlated with low socio-\neconomic status, reduced educational achievement, and\ndisadvantaged neighborhood environment, as well as\nApproximately 12.3% of all mothers report cigarette\nsmoking while pregnant [59]. Cigarette smoke is a com-\ncompounds, [61] including carbon monoxide, that may\nalso affect the fetus. Maternal smoking during pregnancy\nproduces adverse effects for the fetus through several path-\nways. First, cigarette smoke interferes with normal placen-\ntal function. As metabolites of cigarette smoke pass\nthrough the placenta from mother to fetus, they act as\nvasoconstrictors to reduce uterine blood flow by up to\n38% [62]. The fetus is deprived of nutrients and oxygen,\nresulting in episodic fetal hypoxia-ischemia and malnutri-\ntion [63]. This is the basis for the fetal intrauterine growth\nretardation seen in many infants born to smoking moth-\ners. Studies have shown that smoking is responsible for\n20\u00ad30% of all infants of low birthweight, and that infants\ngrams less than infants born to nonsmoking mothers\nSecond, the nicotine in cigarette smoke acts as a neuroter-\natogen that interferes with fetal development, specifically\nthe developing nervous system [65]. In utero, nicotine tar-\ngets nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the fetal brain to\nchange the pattern of cell proliferation and differentia-\ntion. Fetal nicotine exposure up-regulates nicotinic\ncholinergic receptor binding sites, causing abnormalities\nin the development of synaptic activity [66]. The end\nresult is cell loss and ultimately, neuronal damage. Fur-\nthermore, because concentrations of nicotine on the fetal\nside of the placenta generally reach levels 15% higher than\nmaternal levels, even low levels of cigarette smoking may\nexpose the fetus to harmful amounts of nicotine [67,68].\nAs preclinical studies have shown, fetal doses of nicotine\nthat do not result in low birthweight still produce deficits\nin fetal brain development [65]. Cigarettes contain many\nhazardous toxic chemicals, including nicotine, hydrogen\ncyanide, and carbon monoxide. Ingestion of these harm-\nful toxins into the fetal blood supply can cause problems\nin newborns such as low birth weight, pre-term delivery,\nslow fetal development, and infant mortality [69-71].\nAlthough the effects of cigarette smoking on fetal growth\nretardation have been known for many years, more recent\nwork has linked prenatal nicotine exposure to sudden\ninfant death syndrome as well as short and longer term\nbehavioral and cognitive problems [72-77] including\neffects on IQ [78]. In a recent study, we [79] found a dose\nresponse relationship between cotinine (the major metab-\nolite of nicotine) in the mothers saliva at delivery and the\nneurobehavior of the newborn suggesting possible with-\ndrawal effects from cigarette smoking during pregnancy.\nIn addition, the effects were observed at less than 7 ciga-\nrettes per day, which is below the threshold of 10 ciga-\nrettes per day typically reported for the effects on birth\nweight. In another study, maternal genotype was found to\nalter the effect of smoking on infant birthweight [80]. This\ncould suggest that genetic influences may also explain\nwhy some nicotine exposed infants show neurobehavio-\nral deficits while others do not.\nIn addition to these prenatal mechanisms there are post-\nnatal mechanisms through which smoking can affect the\nchild. These include research on the transmission of nico-\ntine through breast milk and its harmful effects, and the\nconsequences of second-hand smoke exposure on chil-\ndren [46,81,82]. The toxic effects of tobacco are illustrated\nby a study in which infants of nonsmoking mothers who\nHarm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nhad environmental exposure to tobacco smoke showed\nmeasurable ill effects [83].\nIt is positive to note that tobacco use during pregnancy is\nexposed infants) in 1996. Women who do still smoke are\ntrends underscore the importance of smoking cessation\nprograms, particularly for women of childbearing age. At\nthis opportune time in which the harmful effects of ciga-\nrette smoke have been subjected to increasing scrutiny,\nefforts aimed at smoking cessation and addiction treat-\nment, as well as studies directed at understanding the\neffects of prenatal exposure to nicotine on infants have\ndefinitive relevance in advancing the health and develop-\nment of children.\nIllicit drugs are the most often targeted drugs in the fight\nagainst maternal substance abuse, because they are per-\nceived to produce the most harmful side effects in both\nthe mothers and the children. Whether this is true or not\nis a topic that is certainly up for debate. As mentioned ear-\nlier, it is hard to pinpoint the exact prevalence of illegal\ndrug use among pregnant women because figures are\nderived from self-reporting by the women or reporting by\na physician. Figures on the frequency of illegal drug use\n[85,86]. There are numerous birth complications attrib-\nuted to illegal drug use, including pre-term delivery, low\nbirth weight, smaller-than-normal head size, miscarriages,\ngenital and urinary tract deformities, and nervous system\nFor cocaine, we now know that early scientific reports\nwere exaggerated, and portrayed children who were\nexposed to cocaine in utero as irreparably doomed and\nexposed children suggest a pattern of small deficits in\nintelligence and moderate deficits in language [91]. Fur-\nther, cocaine-exposed children at 6 years show deficits in\nacademic skills including poor sustained attention, more\ndisorganization, and less abstract thinking [92-94].\nResearch on prenatal marijuana exposure started slightly\nbefore the explosion of cocaine research in the 1980s.\nDevelopmental effects on executive function have been\nreported in a study of 9\u00ad12 year olds [78]. However,\ndespite the fact that marijuana is the most frequently\nabused illegal drug, it has not received the attention, as\nhave other drugs, and there are calls for legalization and\napproval for medicinal use. Finally, it has been only\nrecently that amphetamine/methamphetamine use dur-\ning pregnancy has drawn attention. Longitudinal studies\nof development in methamphetamine-exposed children\nare just beginning [95].\nA lingering puzzle, especially with the cocaine literature, is\nthe discrepancy between preclinical (animal) and clinical\n(human) studies. There is substantial preclinical evidence\nthat cocaine and other drugs of abuse are neuroteratogens\nthat can produce serious abnormalities in brain develop-\nment. More recent findings [96] suggest that the behavio-\nral impact of such neural abnormalities that might occur\nin humans depends on other complex pre- and postnatal\nfactors, which may also include genetic vulnerability. We\nhave seen how public understanding of the impact of pre-\nnatal exposure has lurched from an initial over-reaction in\nwhich drug-exposed children were characterized as irrevo-\ncably and irreversibly damaged to a perhaps equally pre-\nmature excessive \"sigh of relief\" that drugs such as cocaine\ndo not have lasting effects, especially if children are raised\nin appropriate environments. Exaggerated statements\nabout the benign effects of cocaine as found in Frank et al.\n[97] can have negative policy implications. Infants\nexposed to drugs in utero may have a milder phenotype\nwith appropriate environment input. We need to under-\nstand combinations of biological (including genetic) pre-\ndispositions and environmental conditions that result in\nnormal development and what specific factors might pro-\nmote resilience. This will require changing some of our\nmodels for studying the effects of MATID.\nDevelopmental model\nMost studies of MATID use and child developmental out-\ncome follow the behavioral teratology model. The goal is\nto isolate the unique effects of the drug, typically by con-\ntrolling other variables that could also explain child out-\ncome [98,99]. This approach is based on our\nunderstanding of the mechanisms of action of ATID, as\nwell as on preclinical and clinical studies, and enables us\nto study the potential pharmacological and toxic effects of\nthe drugs per se. The limitation of this approach is that it\ndoes not lend itself to study drug exposure as part of a\ndevelopmental model in which the goal is to predict child\noutcome with ATID as one of many contributing factors.\nThis is because behavioral teratology research designs typ-\nically treat environmental variables as potential con-\nfounding factors rather than as a primary focus for\ninvestigation [100]. Developmental-ecological models\nhave shown that many, if not most, child outcomes are\ndue to multiple antecedent variables [101].\nDevelopmental models should also take into account the\neffects of polydrug exposure. Adverse MATID effects are\nthought to be due to mechanisms by which the drugs dis-\nrupt programs for brain development associated with\nalterations in brain structure and neuronal function that\nhave unique behavioral consequences. ATID freely cross\nHarm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nthe placenta and the developing fetal brain. Typically we\nthink about the specific or individual effects of each drug,\nethanol and the GABA system, nicotine effects on acetyl-\ncholine, opiates and the \u00b5, , and  receptors, and the\neffects of cocaine on DA, NE, 5-HT. However, in addition\nto these mechanisms specific to each drug, recent litera-\nture suggests a mechanism of action common to all drugs\nof abuse. Every drug of abuse appears to increase the levels\nof the neurotransmitter dopamine in the brain pathways\nthat control pleasure. This explanation centers on activa-\ntion of specific neural pathways that project from the pons\nand midbrain to more rostral forebrain regions, including\nthe amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate\ncortex, ventral palladium, and subdivisions of the stria-\ntum, particularity the nucleus accumbens [102]. This\nmodel of a final common pathway for all drugs of abuse\nis critical because, as documented earlier, most prenatal\ndrug use is polydrug use. Therefore, understanding these\npotential pathways will give us one model for understand-\ning the developmental effects of polydrug use.\nTheoretically, we can describe three types of consequences\nof MATID on child development (1) immediate drug\neffects (2) latent drug effects, and (3) postnatal environ-\nment effects as shown in Figure 1.\nImmediate drug effects are direct teratogenic conse-\nquences of MATID exposure and emerge during the first\nyear before postnatal environmental effects become sali-\nent. These effects may be transient, such as catch-up in\nphysical growth or more long lasting, such as behavioral\ndisregulation that is observed in infancy and persists\nthrough school age. Latent drug effects are also direct ter-\natogenic effects but reflect brain function that becomes\nrelevant later in development. There are two kinds of\nlatent effects. First, MATID can affect brain function that\nDevelopmental Model of the Effects of Maternal Alcohol, Tobacco and Illegal Drug Use (MATID) During Pregnancy on Child\nOutcome\nDevelopmental Model of the Effects of Maternal Alcohol, Tobacco and Illegal Drug Use (MATID) During Pregnancy on Child\nOutcome\nPRENATALPOSTNATAL\nIMMEDIATELATENT\nSPECIFICGENERAL\nRISKRISK\nPROTECTIVE\nHarm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5\n(page number not for citation purposes)\ndoes not manifest until children are older, including cog-\nnitive processes (I.Q., language, executive function and\nacademic skills), antisocial behavior (conduct disorder\n[CD], oppositional defiant disorder [ODD], delinquency,\nand externalizing and aggressive behavior problems), sub-\nstance use onset, psychopathology (attention deficit dis-\norder [ADD], attention deficit hyperactivity disorder\n[ADHD], internalizing behavior, depression, and anxi-\nety). Second, MATID affects the brain by causing a predis-\nposition for dependence on drugs. By \"predisposition\" we\nmean an increase in risk that requires other conditions to\nbe met. These conditions would be activated during\nschool age when opportunities to use drugs arise, leading\nto early substance use onset.\nThere is also evidence from the nicotine and alcohol liter-\nature for the biological basis of drug use in children, such\nthat adolescent or childhood onset of substance use is\nrelated to prenatal exposure. Adolescents are more likely\nto smoke if their mothers smoked during pregnancy even\nSimilar results have been reported for alcohol [106]. In\ntwo cohorts Kandel [103] found that adolescent girls are\nmore likely to smoke if their mothers smoked during\npregnancy even after controlling for postnatal maternal\nsmoking. It was suggested that nicotine input to the\ndopaminergic system could predispose the brain to later\naddictive behavior. Therefore, prenatal exposure may be\nrelated to increased risk of substance abuse in the off-\nspring. More recently, Weissman [107] found a 4-fold\nincrease of prepubertal-onset CD in boys and a 5-fold\nincreased risk of adolescent onset drug dependence in\ngirls whose mothers smoked during pregnancy, also unre-\nlated to postnatal maternal smoking. Maternal smoking\nduring pregnancy has also been related to increased\nup, [106] prenatal alcohol exposure was more predictive\nof adolescent alcohol use and its negative consequences\nthan was family history of alcohol problems. Moderate to\nheavy maternal drinking during pregnancy was related to\ncurrent drinking in daughters after controlling for current\nmaternal drinking and child rearing practices. Prenatal\nmaternal smoking was also related to elevated rates of\nadolescent drinking [110]. Therefore, drug exposure in\nutero may alter the brain in ways that increase the risk for\nlater addiction.\nPostnatal environment effects include general environ-\nmental factors (socio-demographics, care giving context\nand style, and caregiver characteristics) that include both\nrisk and protective factors. Environmental risk factors are\nwell established correlates of a variety of poor child out-\ncomes including cognitive, social, psychological, school,\nand health problems that occur in both drug-using and\nnon-drug using populations. MATID is associated with\ngeneral psychosocial risk factors that compromise child\noutcome apart from substance abuse issues including\nment in difficult or abusive relationships with male\ntreatment show a high incidence of psychopathology\n[124] including affective and personality disorders\ncocaine using women showed elevated levels of depres-\nsion, general mental distress and more psychological\nsymptoms postpartum [129]. There are also specific\naspects of the caregiving environment unique to AOD\nusing mothers analogous to the well-documented litera-\nture on \"children of alcoholics\" (COAs). Passive exposure\nto smoke is also a direct teratogenic effect that is also part\nof the environment [78].\nAnother problem with the behavioral teratology model is\nthat as a deficit model it does not include protective or\nresiliency factors that buffer the child against adverse child\noutcome. Resiliency factors can be biological (such as self-\nrighting, compensatory brain mechanism that may be\ngenetically based) as well as factors such as stable temper-\nament, high motivation, connectedness to parents/others,\nconsistent parental supervision and discipline, relation-\nship to prosocial institutions, intolerant attitudes toward\ndeviance, peers with anti-drug attitudes and community\nanti-drug norms. Connectedness to others and intoler-\nance of attitudes toward deviance were also highlighted by\nthe Surgeon General Report [130] on youth violence.\nFinally, the model includes the \"development\" arrow to\nindicate that development is a dynamic process. Nature\nand nurture are not viewed as static \"either/or\" categories.\nRather there are reciprocal causal relations between intra-\nand extra-individual factors that change over the course of\ndevelopment.\nWe can say unequivocally that some children exposed to\ndrugs in utero have learning and behavioral problems.\nClearly in the case of cocaine the problem is not as severe\nas was once feared. We also know that environmental fac-\ntors play a large role in determining the development of\ndrug-exposed children. There is increasing evidence that\namount of exposure makes a difference. This is well estab-\nlished for alcohol, for tobacco with respect to effects on\nbirthweight, and the cocaine literature is just starting to\nstudy level of exposure. There is also some evidence that\ntiming of exposure makes a difference, again especially for\nalcohol. Not all children who are exposed to drugs in utero\nshow neurobehavioral deficits and those who are affected\ndisplay a wide range of neurobehavioral effects. The same\nHarm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5\n(page number not for citation purposes)\ndrug, even at the same dose does not appear to produce\nthe same deficits in all children.\nIt is almost superfluous to say that advances over the com-\ning years will provide a much clearer picture and deeper\nunderstanding of the long-term effects of prenatal drug\nexposure. However, it is not superfluous to say that the\ndata available today indicate that society must take the\nproblems of substance abuse during pregnancy very seri-\nously. Priority must be given to programs that help\naddicted pregnant women avoid drugs and to programs\nthat provide postnatal intervention. We know that preven-\ntion and treatment programs are effective. We do not\nknow which are most effective. With limited resources,\nclinical trials are necessary, and well-tested programs with\nfidelity should be adopted.\nWe don't have (and we may never have) the complete sci-\nentific picture. What we do have is enough information to\nmake it a priority to identity and treat drug-using pregnant\nwomen and their children. We do know enough to pro-\nvide an \"antidote to complacency\" [131].\nThere are important limitations to the research on the\ndevelopmental consequences of MATID that have policy\nimplications. First, our knowledge of use patterns (how\nmuch, when and how often during pregnancy drugs are\nused) is limited by reliance on self-report (including both\nproblems associated with memory and reluctance to\nreveal drug use due to fear of prosecution and child\nremoval), and limitations of drug toxicology (including\nno bioassay for alcohol). Second, it is not clear whom we\nare studying, that is, to what population the developmen-\ntal effects of MATID generalize. For example, most women\nin the cocaine studies are recreational users; they are not\n\"hard core\" addicts. In the cocaine literature, a \"heavy\"\nuse is defined as three or more times per week during the\nfirst trimester. This definition is a function of the patterns\nof use detected in the studies and is in sharp contrast to\nthe heroin addict or methadone user where use is daily for\nthe entire pregnancy. One reason that the developmental\neffects of cigarette smoking may be as strong as the effects\nof cocaine is that the use patterns of women who smoke\ncigarettes during pregnancy are closer to those of narcotics\nthan cocaine \u00ad daily use throughout pregnancy. The sever-\nity of the effects of the drug is one important factor, as is\nthe pattern of use.\nThird, and related to the previous issue is that we know lit-\ntle about dose response relationships between MATID\nand developmental outcome. There is some evidence for\nthresholds in the literature (10 cigarettes/day, .5 oz alco-\nhol/day, three days/week cocaine during the first trimes-\nter) but the developmental effects of these thresholds have\nnot been well established. Fourth, there is virtually no\ninformation on polydrug effects, yet polydrug use is more\ncommon than single drug use. Little is known about the\npharmacology of polydrug use, such as how drug interac-\ntions affect fetal development. Although the final com-\nmon pathway model involving the dopaminergic system\nis attractive it has not been empirically applied to the\nchild development literature. Fifth, although there are\nhundreds of published developmental studies, there are\nrelatively few long-term outcome studies, and methodo-\nlogical problems make interpretation difficult. Alcohol\neffects, especially FAS and COA, are well established but,\nfor example, untangling prenatal MATID use from postna-\ntal environmental (including parenting) effects on devel-\nopmental outcome is still problematic. Sixth, there is the\nuncomfortable problem of effect size. Other than FAS, the\nliterature does not show a devastating pattern of develop-\nmental effects. This is fortunate for the many children in\nsociety affected but has left researchers in a quandary with\nrespect to how to interpret these effects for the public. The\nresearch typically addresses the question of whether or\nnot there is an association between variables; such as drug\nexposure and child outcome. The issue of whether or not\nthe association is of practical importance, i.e., clinically\nsignificant, is often not addressed, however, this issue is\ncritical for policymakers. For example, in our multisite\nstudy of prenatal cocaine exposure with 8600 subjects we\ndid find increased medical problems, however, the preva-\nlence rates were low, raising issues as to the clinical signif-\nicance of the findings [90]. Most findings are presented in\nterms of tests of statistical inference (p value). Effect size\n(size of the estimate in standard units) is usually not pre-\nsented. The practical importance of an effect is dependent\non two contexts, scientific and empirical [132]. The scien-\ntific context refers to the fact that, ideally, policy decisions\nwould be data-based. However, data, i.e., effect size is con-\nstrained or decreased by problems in measurement,\ndesign and methods. In other words, measured effects are\nlikely to be small due to methodological limitations. The\nempirical context refers to the fact that results need to be\nevaluated in the context of the existing empirical litera-\nture. Meta-analysis is a useful tool for this [132]. For\nexample, using meta-analysis, we were able to show that\nthe effect sizes of prenatal cocaine exposure on IQ and\nlanguage when children reach school age range from .33\u00ad\n.71. Our findings [133] from the Maternal Lifestyle Study\nof prenatal cocaine exposure and child outcome showed\nthat the effects of cocaine on IQ actually increased over\ntime from 1.5 in infancy to 3.5 IQ points at age 7. If this\npattern continues, the deficit will be 7.6 IQ points at age\n11. We also found that children in the cocaine exposed\ngroup are more than 1 1/5 times more likely to qualify for\nspecial education services than children in the unexposed\ngroup.\nHarm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nThe question that the scientific community and policy\nmakers have not come to grips with is how to interpret\nmore subtle effects: what are clinically significant (as\nopposed to statistically significant) effects and how do\nthese effects impact policy including treatment programs?\nThere are tough questions to answer. If a study does show\na MATID effect, how many children are affected, what is\nthe magnitude of the effect and what does it mean? Lastly,\nas mentioned earlier, and related to the previous issue,\ndevelopmental MATID effects must be understood in the\ncontext of the child's overall development. This means\nunderstanding protective and resiliency factors as well as\nrisk factors, and viewing drugs as one of a number of\nevents that will determine the developmental outcome of\nthe child. This will help enable us to develop interven-\ntions designed to minimize risk factors and maximize pro-\ntective factors.\nPolicy options\nImportance of context\nContext is always important for social policy, but in the\ncase of drug abuse during pregnancy, context is important\nin several different ways. First, policy is, by definition,\ndependent on social context. As was clear from our histor-\nical review, the social context for prenatal drug exposure\nchanged dramatically in the mid-1980's with the crack\nepidemic. Social consternation with the high level of use\nby pregnant women centered on consequences for the\nchildren and then shifted to the fetus. Once the fetus\nbecame the central protagonist there was a significant\nshift in social perception. The concept of harming the\nfetus by using drugs during pregnancy resulted in sanc-\ntions by both the criminal justice system and the child\nprotective system.\nSecond, existing policies have been made in a climate of\nscientific uncertainly about the effects of prenatal drug\nexposure. Policies looking for a \"quick fix\" have taken a\nlinear approach by focusing on the single risk factor of\nprenatal drug exposure as the explanation for the out-\ncomes of these children. However, as we will show later,\nthere is a wide variation in the developmental outcome of\nthese children, and the determinants of development in\nthese children are multifaceted and complex. Drug effects\nmust be understood in the context in which the child\ndevelops. Parenting and other environmental factors in\naddition to drugs are responsible for the outcome of these\nchildren. Poverty (which can be a proxy for an inadequate\nenvironment) affects IQ without drugs. The combination\nof drugs and poverty can be a \"double whammy\" and put\nchildren at extreme disadvantage [91]. Policy must take\ninto account the fact that biological vulnerability and\nenvironmental factors interact to determine the outcome\nof these children, and this is a dynamic process [134].\nThird, context is also important because social policy in\nthis area brings up many ethical dilemmas. In the \"real\nworld,\" drug-using pregnant women are mostly poor and\nminority. The social policy context for these women\nincludes dramatic reductions in services and access to\nlegal recourse. In the real world, child rearing is also\naffected by context, including culture. Drug-using moth-\ners may want \"the best\" for their children, but what they\nmean by \"best\" will be influenced by their context, expe-\nrience and belief systems and may differ from what the\nexperts mean by \"best.\" And \"best\" needs to be weighted\nagainst the alternative. Foster placement, especially multi-\nple foster placements, is not necessarily a better alternative\nfor the child. Pragmatic recognition of how these women\nare treated by policies is necessary to enlarge the frame\nand alter the construction of the problem.\nFourth, to say that policy is dependent on social context\nalso means that policy is shaped by public perception and\nattitudes. One of the consequences of shattering the pla-\ncental barrier, triggered primarily in response to the use of\ncocaine by pregnant women in the 1980s, has been two\nparallel sets of attitudes towards drug use during preg-\nnancy resulting in two parallel sets of policy responses.\nOne approach is to view drug abuse as a mental health/\nmedical illness. Advocates of this approach recommend\npolicy that emphasizes treatment and prevention includ-\ning reproductive health care, therapy for past abuse and\nfor parent child relationships. The other approach is puni-\ntive and views drug-using women as criminals and as irre-\nsponsible (\"how could they do this to their babies?\"). This\napproach translates into sanctions within both the crimi-\nnal justice system and the child protection system. The\nnew twist was the construct of harming the fetus by using\ndrugs. The cocaine problem shone the spotlight on this\nissue and it has now intensified concern about other drugs\nas well including marijuana, alcohol and tobacco. For\nexample, if \"harm\" to the fetus is no worse for cocaine\nthan it is for legal substances such as tobacco and alcohol,\nshould the same criminal and treatment policies apply for\nuse of all these substances? It is important to point out\nthat for many advocates of the sanction approach, treat-\nment is included. The two approaches may not agree on\nissues such as the nature of addiction, autonomy of the\npregnant woman, status of the fetus, and utility of puni-\ntive measures; they do agree that treatment is an essential\ncomponent of the policy response [135].\nViews of addiction\nThere is much societal debate on what should be the\nappropriate response to maternal substance abuse during\npregnancy. One reason for the ongoing controversy is tied\nto the conflicting views of addiction, and again an histor-\nical perspective is useful. Society's approach to substance\nuse has changed markedly over the decades from being\nHarm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nviewed as an individual problem for which society has no\nresponsibility to a major social problem that must be\naddressed by the mental health, medical and criminal jus-\ntice systems. For example, fifty years ago, a person seeking\nhelp for a serious alcohol or drug problem would have\nbeen treated for months in a psychiatric hospital diag-\nnosed using the American Psychiatric Association's Grey-\nbook (APA 1942) as a character disorder along with\nstuttering and bed wetting. Today people with substance\nabuse disorder have a better chance of being identified\nand finding support and/or being required by the crimi-\nnal justice system to undergo treatment. Alcohol and\nDrug Abuse are now distinct psychiatric (DSM-IV) disor-\nders; treatment is specialized and more often outpatient.\nToday this issue tends to get polarized, especially when it\ncomes to pregnant women. There is the liberal perspective\nof drug abuse that calls on people to look at drug use as a\npublic health problem requiring compassion and under-\nstanding. To deal with drug use during pregnancy in a\nharsh way would be unconstitutional, misogynistic, and\nineffective [70]. From this perspective, drug use during\npregnancy must be treated in the same manner as depres-\nsion or other mental illness. It has also been suggested\nthat not only is it ineffective to treat drug and alcohol\naddiction as a criminal act, but it is also a punitive\napproach that is akin to criminalizing mental illness\nduring pregnancy is that it is a voluntary and illegal act\nthat requires significant neglect of the rights of the fetus.\nFrom this view women who use drugs during their preg-\nnancy are willfully committing a criminal act, deserving a\nWhile the pendulum has swung back and forth between\nviewing addiction as a medical problem or viewing it as a\ncriminal problem, the highest levels of the judicial system\nhave made their perspective clear. As early as 1925, the\nUnited States Supreme Court recognized addiction to be a\ndisease. In the Linder decision, the justices state,\n\"...addicts...are diseased and proper subjects for such\n(medical) treatments\" [139]. The Court reaffirmed this\nopinion in the 1962 decision in the case of Robinson v.\nCalifornia. The Court stated, \"...It is unlikely that any state\nat this moment in history would attempt to make it a\ncriminal offense for a person to be mentally ill, or a leper,\nor to be afflicted with a venereal disease...in light of con-\ntemporary human knowledge, a law which made a crimi-\nnal offense of such a disease would doubtless be\nuniversally thought to be an infliction of cruel and unu-\nsual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Four-\nteenth Amendments...the prosecution is aimed at\npenalizing an illness, rather than providing medical care\nfor it. We would forget the teachings of the Eighth Amend-\nment if we allowed sickness to be made a crime and per-\nmitted sick people to be punished for being sick...\"\nFrom a medical perspective addiction is a chronic disease\ndeviation from or interruption of the normal structure or\nfunction of any part of an organ or system (or combina-\ntion thereof) of the body that is manifested by a character-\nistic set of symptoms and signs, whose etiology,\npathology and prognosis may be known or unknown.\"\nThe vagueness of this definition illustrates the broad range\nof conditions that are called disease, and also that whether\nor not a particular condition is called a disease could be\ndue to cultural consensus as much as medical factors. This\nsocial stigma probably plays a major role in addiction not\nbeing viewed as a disease.\nProsecution and state statutes\nThere are many different reasons why state legislatures\nhave taken an interest in addressing the problem of sub-\nstance abuse by pregnant women. One reason is the basic\nnotion that the state has an obligation to provide for the\nwelfare of its citizens. It is also of financial importance to\nthe state to address the issue [144]. Immediate effects of\nMATID use include pregnancy complications as well as\nhealth issues for the newborn, driving up the amount of\nmoney that the state must spend on obstetrical and neo-\nnatal care. This is not where the cost of maternal drug use\nends for the state. After birth, children born to mothers\nwho used substances during pregnancy are at a higher risk\nof neglect, abuse, and abandonment, thus requiring the\nintervention of child protective services or juvenile courts\nat further cost to the states [145]. First year costs to states\nof births affected by maternal substance use can be as high\nas $50,000 each above the cost of \"usual\" births. State\nexpenses for public assistance and foster care for each year\nThe costs to the state coupled with media attention as a\nresult of the \"crack baby\" epidemic of the 1980s, forced\nstates to respond. Most often the response came in the\nform of legislation [147]. Many different types of bills\nwere introduced in an attempt to combat the problem on\nmany different fronts and levels. Some bills addressed the\nroles of health professionals; specifically, these bills often\nrequired doctors to report incidents of maternal substance\nabuse to the proper authorities; others required social\nservice agencies to assess families affected by alcohol or\ndrugs for abuse and neglect; and other bills introduced the\nrequirement of commercial vendors who sell alcohol and\ntobacco to post warnings about the effects of these sub-\nstances on pregnant women [148].\nHarm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nState approaches to maternal substance use\nStates have employed a wide variety of strategies to com-\nbat maternal perinatal alcohol and drug use. Due to the\npublic's outcry for an answer to the problem of \"crack\nbabies\" and other drug-exposed infants, the courts imple-\nmented policies and practices that emphasized personal\nresponsibility and punishment [1]. User accountability\nwas stated as the basis for most drug control policies. User\naccountability was based on the idea that if there were no\ndrug users, there would be no drug problems, and that\nusers were responsible for creating the demand that made\ntrafficking a lucrative criminal enterprise [149]. Of course,\nour cultural penchant for punishment and criminaliza-\ntion may have played a role in justifying these policies.\nSince there were not, and still are not, any statutes on the\nbooks specifically criminalizing drug use during preg-\nnancy, women have been prosecuted under statutes that\ndeal with child abuse, assault, murder, or drug dealing\n[150]. One of the newest attempts in prosecuting women\nis using statutes related to the delivery of drugs to a minor.\nHowever, it is much more difficult to convince a judge\nand jury of prosecuting on these grounds because there is\nno explicit language in any statute delineating that a fetus\ncan be considered a minor, entitled to all the rights and\nProsecutorial strategies\nhave been criminally prosecuted in relation to their use of\ndrugs during pregnancy [71]. State supreme courts have\noverturned nearly all these convictions. Prosecutorial\nattempts fall under a few general types of criminal stat-\nutes. There are statutes that deal with the delivery of a con-\ntrolled substance to a minor, statutes that attempt to hold\nmothers who use drugs accountable under child abuse\nstatutes, those that charge mothers with manslaughter\nshould the baby die, and those related to involuntary\ndetention and treatment of the mother [153].\nDelivery of a controlled substance to a minor\nIn light of the lack of specific criminal statues applying to\nmaternal substance abuse during pregnancy, state prose-\ncutors have come up with creative ways of dealing with\nthe issue. One such creative method is prosecuting under\nstatutes that govern the delivery of a controlled substance\nto a minor. Prosecutions in these cases focus on the\nminute after birth before the umbilical cord is cut. At that\nmoment the child is fully born, and thus a person under\nthe Fourteenth Amendment entitled to full and equal pro-\ntection under the law. At the same time the child is still\nattached to the mother and could possibly be receiving\nArguably the most renowned case prosecuted in this man-\nner is that of Florida v. Johnson [155]. Jennifer Johnson\nwas convicted in Seminole County, Florida of delivering a\ncontrolled substance to her baby through the umbilical\ncord after birth. The conviction came after hospital offi-\ncials discovered that her two children had positive toxicol-\nogy results for cocaine following birth. Johnson also\nadmitted to smoking crack cocaine three to four times\nevery other day throughout the course of her pregnancy.\nJohnson was convicted and sentenced to 15 years proba-\ntion. In 1992, the Florida Supreme Court overturned her\nconviction on the basis that the statute was not meant to\napply to the delivery of controlled substances through the\numbilical cord (Florida Supreme Court, 1992).\nChild abuse\nThe most common strategy employed is charging preg-\nnant drug users with child abuse and/or neglect. The chal-\nlenge facing prosecutors is finding a way to convince the\ncourt that an unborn child falls under the legal definition\nearliest prosecution using child abuse and neglect statutes\nwas the 1977 case of Reyes v. California. In this case the\nmother gave birth to heroin-addicted twins. Ms. Reyes was\nconvicted under child endangerment laws. However, the\nconviction was overturned and the case dismissed by the\nappellate courts on the grounds that child endangerment\nlaws were never intended by the legislature to apply to\nfetuses. Thus in the eyes of the law a fetus was not really\nCases tried using abuse and neglect statutes revolve\naround the central issues of whether or not the fetus can\nbe considered a \"child\" in the eyes of the law, and whether\nor not the behavior of the mother prior to the birth of the\nchild can be considered viable criteria for judging whether\nabuse or neglect has occurred. Even given these issues,\nmany convictions have been obtained using these stat-\nutes. While convictions under these statutes have been\noverturned in higher courts of appeal, the high courts\nhave also suggested that states take the initiative to pass\npieces of legislation that specify prenatal maternal con-\nduct as admissible in establishing abuse, or legislation\nManslaughter\nAnother form of prosecutorial strategy that states may\nemploy is charging the pregnant drug user with man-\nslaughter. Manslaughter statutes are difficult to apply to\nthe cases of pregnant women because the statutes were\nintended for third party criminal culpability. This means\nthat manslaughter laws were originally intended to cover\nthe death of a baby as the result of the actions of a third\ncriminal code which states that the willful killing of an\nHarm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nunborn child, by any injury to the mother of such child, is\nmurder if it resulted in the death of such mother, to be\ndeemed manslaughter, a second degree felony [159].\nDespite these laws, there have been cases in which women\nwith babies stillborn to mothers in their third trimester\nwere charged with manslaughter. This prosecutorial strat-\negy has seldom been employed and has never resulted in\na conviction. It is doubtful whether manslaughter charges\nwould ever actually result in a conviction for a drug-using\nmother if tested in a jury trial. It is even more unlikely that\nthe charge would be upheld in higher courts of appeal.\nThe case law does not lend itself to the legal conception of\nthe fetus as a person with independent legal rights sepa-\nrate from those of the mother. When cocaine mothers\nhave been convicted of manslaughter, it was the result of\ntheir guilty pleas without the deliberation of public trials\nInvoluntary detention\nIn an attempt to decriminalize drug use in pregnant\nwomen, involuntary detention in treatment programs has\nbeen offered as an alternative. It has been argued that\ninvoluntary detention is the best available mode of\nadministering punishment, rehabilitation, and deterrence\nall at once, as well as providing the addict with education\nstates is to move toward reducing the severity of the effects\nof drug use on the infant. According to The New York\nTimes, when doctors specializing in maternal-fetal medi-\ncine were surveyed in 1986, more than half of them\nagreed that pregnant women who refuse medical advice\nand endanger the life of the fetus should be detained in\nhospitals and forced to follow their physician's orders\n[160]. By committing the pregnant drug user without her\nconsent, the state is essentially taking custody of the child\nbefore it is ever born. This presents a legal and ethical con-\nflict. By involuntarily committing the mother as a mode of\nprotecting the infant, the court is, in some respect, putting\nthe needs and the health of the child over those of the\nmother. There is an understood obligation to the mother's\nhealth and well being, but with involuntary detention, the\nhealth and well being of the fetus comes first, even though\nthis is not a legally recognized obligation [150].\nCivil interventions\nWith the waning popularity of criminal prosecutions\nagainst perinatal substance abusers, states have turned\ntoward civil legal remedies. These actions are both more\npervasive and more successful than criminal prosecutions.\nThis is largely because in order to establish a prosecution\nagainst someone the state must prove that the defendant\nis guilty of the alleged crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\nIn civil actions the state is only obligated to prove there is\na preponderance of evidence to suggest the guilt of the\nChild neglect statutes\nCivil actions in regard to child abuse and neglect provide\na basis for which social welfare agencies, especially child\nprotective agencies, can intervene and conduct investiga-\ntions into the fitness of a parent [149,162]. While criminal\nchild abuse and neglect statutes seek to punish the parents\nfor their failure to properly care for their children, civil\nchild neglect statutes seek to intervene in the family set-\nting in an attempt to introduce plans of action for rehabil-\nitating the parent and restoring normal order to the family\nunit [22,161]. Civil actions are established in the same\nway as criminal child abuse cases. They are most often\nbased on the results of toxicology screens performed on\nthe child at the time of birth. There are questions today on\nwhether a positive toxicology screen is enough to estab-\nlish neglect, remove the child from the home, and ulti-\nmately terminate parental rights. The general \"rules\" the\ncourts have established in deciding these cases are that\nchildren have the right to be born with a sound mind and\nbody and past evidence of neglect and abuse is relevant in\ndetermining future harm [147].\nInvoluntary civil commitment\nCivil commitment is a civil action with state intervention\nthat places individuals in some type of inpatient facility\nagainst their will after the state has demonstrated they are\ndangerous or unable to meet their most basic needs or\nboth [149]. This type of intervention has been widely used\nagainst substance abusers, however only one state has suc-\ncessfully included pregnant women in the statutes that\ncall for involuntary commitment.\nTort actions\nTort actions are civil actions that are filed by an independ-\nare meant to deter drug use by imposing financial conse-\nquences on the drug-using mother. In tort actions women\nare held accountable for the financial burden incurred for\nthe cost of the birth of the drug-exposed baby.\nState statutes\nIn formulating laws, whether criminal or civil, pertaining\nto perinatal substance abuse, there are certain general cat-\negories that are adhered to. There are laws dealing with the\ntermination of parental rights and the removal of children\nfrom the home, testing/reporting/ identifying drug-\nexposed infants, child abuse, and treatment for the\nmother and alcohol. Figure 2 shows the number of states\nwith laws in each of these categories. Table 2 shows which\nstates have specific laws and Table 3 (see Additional File\n1) provides a summary of the specific laws.\nChild abuse and neglect\nMore than one-quarter of the states have passed laws that\nspecifically define a mother's drug use as child abuse or\nHarm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nTable 2: Type of Substance Abuse Statutes by State\nSTATE Mandates\nPrenatal\nTesting/\nScreening for\nSubstance Use\nIncludes\nmaternal\nsubstance\nabuse or infant\nsubstance\nexposure\nunder the\ndefinition of\nabuse\nMandates\nNeonatal\ntesting For\nDrugs\nMandates\nReporting as\nChild Abuse or\nNeglect\nMandates\nPostnatal\nReporting\nAssessment or\nServices\nMandates\nPriority Access\nto Treatment\nfor Pregnant\nWomen\nProvides\nTreatment\nProgram or\nCoordination\nof Services\nPerinatal\nSubstance\nAbuse Task\nForce\nEstablished by\nState\nLegislature\nMandates\nPosting of\nDangers of\nAlcohol to\nPregnant\nWomen\nAL\nAK\nAZ Yes Yes Yes\nAR\nCA Yes Yes Yes\nCO Yes\nCT Yes\nDE\nDC Yes Yes\nFL Yes Yes\nGA Yes Yes\nHI\nID\nIL Yes Yes\nIN Yes\nIA Yes Yes Yes\nKS Yes Yes\nKY Yes\nLA Yes\nME\nMD Yes Yes Yes Yes\nMA Yes\nMI Yes Yes Yes\nMN Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes\nMS\nMO\nMT\nNE\nNV Yes\nNH Yes\nNJ Yes\nNM Yes\nNY Yes\nNC Yes\nND\nOH Yes\nOK Yes Yes\nOR\nPA Yes\nRI\nSC Yes Yes\nSD Yes Yes Yes\nTN\nTX\nUT Yes\nSTATE Mandates\nPrenatal\nTesting/\nScreening for\nSubstance Use\nIncludes\nmaternal\nsubstance\nabuse or infant\nsubstance\nexposure\nunder the\ndefinition of\nabuse\nMandates\nNeonatal\ntesting For\nDrugs\nMandates\nReporting as\nChild Abuse or\nNeglect\nMandates\nPostnatal\nReporting\nAssessment or\nServices\nMandates\nPriority Access\nto Treatment\nfor Pregnant\nWomen\nProvides\nTreatment\nProgram or\nCoordination\nof Services\nPerinatal\nSubstance\nAbuse Task\nForce\nEstablished by\nState\nLegislature\nMandates\nPosting of\nDangers of\nAlcohol to\nPregnant\nWomen\nVT\nVA Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes\nWA\nWV Yes Yes\nWI Yes Yes\nWY\nHarm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nneglect. Thus by defining maternal drug use as an act of\nchild abuse, these states are insuring serious consequences\nfor the mothers, including criminal prosecution, removal\nof the child(ren) from the home, and termination of\nparental rights. Every state has laws mandating reporting\nof child abuse [163]. Thus in the states where drug use is\ndefined as child abuse, reporting of the abuse to the\nproper authorities is also mandated.\nTermination of parental rights/removal from the home\nA major reason women do not disclose their drug use and\nseek treatment is because they fear their children will be\nremoved from their homes and their rights may be alto-\ngether terminated. This is not an unfounded fear. Sixteen\nstates have enacted laws that allow for the removal of a\nchild from the home based on various factors, including a\npositive toxicology screen at the time of birth, or a con-\nfirmed report of drug use in the home. After the child has\nbeen removed from the home, child protective services is\nobligated under ASFA 1997 to move quickly in ensuring\nthat the parent has the opportunity to obtain treatment\nfor their addiction through a court-formulated service\nplan. Noncompliance can result in termination of paren-\ntal rights and adoption of the child.\nTesting/reporting/identification\nWhile every state in the country has mandatory reporting\nlaws for child abuse and neglect, not every state has laws\nconcerning testing/reporting/identification of pregnant\nand postpartum substance users. This is because not every\nstate specifically defines drug use during pregnancy as\nchild abuse or neglect. Given this fact, there are still a sig-\nnificant number of states, 17, that have laws specifically\nrelated to prenatal substance exposure. These laws range\nfrom mandating toxicology tests for infants of mothers\nsuspected of using drugs, toxicology tests for the mother\nherself, to reporting the findings of any positive toxicol-\nogy screen to the proper authorities, whether that be the\npolice department or child protective services [164].\nCriminal offenses vs. treatment\nOne of the most pressing questions among social service\nprofessionals today is whether maternal substance abuse\nwarrants treatment or criminalization. The states also\nstruggle with this question in formulating laws. Many\nstates are leaning towards treating the mother. In fact, no\nless than one quarter of the states have laws in place man-\ndating state establishment of treatment programs for\nexpectant and parenting women who are also substance\nabusers. The state of California has enacted a law mandat-\ning an alternative sentencing program that combines\ntreatment with criminal consequences for noncompli-\nwith an established history of substance abuse, or preg-\nnant or parenting women with an established history of\nsubstance abuse who have one or more children under the\nage of 6 are eligible to enter a drug treatment program,\ncoupled with one year of transition services under inten-\nsive parole supervision. Should they complete the pro-\ngram they will be discharged from parole. If they do not\ncomplete the program, they will be returned to state\nprison to complete their original sentence.\nAlcohol policy\nGiven the fact that alcohol is a legal substance in this\ncountry, it is difficult for states to enact laws criminalizing\nit for pregnant women. As long as they are over the age of\n21, pregnant women are free to drink. However seven\nstates do have laws in place requiring establishments that\nsell alcohol to post warnings about the dangers of drink-\nThe information in Tables 2-3 suggests that as a nation we\ndo not have a uniform policy for dealing with drug use\nduring pregnancy. State statues are quite varied ranging\nfrom no policies to strictly punitive policies. For some\nstates, drug use during pregnancy equals child abuse\n(Iowa, South Carolina, Tennessee, Florida). Other states\n(Maryland, New York) are more vague and include treat-\nment options. For example, Missouri grants pregnant\nwomen priority at drug treatment centers and Washington\nonly requires an investigation. States also vary with\nrespect to the definition of \"drug.\" For example, some\nstates (Maryland, Iowa, Oregon, Idaho, Illinois) only\nmention illegal drugs or controlled substances and not\nalcohol.\nPolicies for newborn drug testing, including conditions\nunder which a drug screen can be ordered, and mandatory\nreporting also vary from state to state. Some states (e.g.,\nNumber of States by Type of Substance Abuse Statue\nNumber of States by Type of Substance Abuse Statue\nHarm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nMassachusetts, Arizona, Minnesota) require mandatory\nreporting to CPS following a positive drug screen; Colo-\nrado \"encourages\" but does require reporting; and other\nstates (e.g., California, Kentucky) evaluate and determine\nif further investigation is necessary. In California, a posi-\ntive toxicology screen is not in and of itself a sufficient rea-\nson to report; further assessment of the needs of the\nmother and child are required.\nFoster care\nMaternal drug use impacts directly on the foster care sys-\ntem. In the mid-1970s, there were over half a million chil-\ndren in substitute care in this country. There was concern\nwith child welfare programs and in 1980 the concept of\n\"permanency planning\" was codified into law. By 1985,\nthe foster care population dropped by almost 50%. But\npermanency planning was ultimately ineffective and in\n1995 the number of children in substitute care had risen\nfive years of age is increasing at twice the national rate of\nthe general foster care population. This dramatic increase\nin the number of children in foster care from the late\ndrug use among women, particularly cocaine use among\npregnant women.\nSubstance use during pregnancy not only raises questions\nabout the options for the drug-using women, treatment\nconsiderations, and the medical and developmental out-\ncome of the infant, but also about the placement of the\ndrug-exposed infant. There have been substantial reports\nof the effects of prenatal substance exposure upon both\nmedical and developmental outcomes of the infant. Aris-\ning from this is the perception of drug-using mothers\nbeing unable to care for their children, thus propelling\nsocial service agencies to intervene and remove the child\nfrom the mother's custody.\nThe increased need for foster care homes has created a lack\nof available foster homes for these infants. The fear of\ndetection, incarceration, and child removal associated\nwith reported drug use drives women away from the\nhealth care system for prenatal care and from seeking\ntreatment for their substance abuse problems. Thus, there\nis an increase in the number of \"boarder babies.\"\nBoarder babies\n\"Boarder babies\" are at-risk infants (typically drug-\nexposed) in the custody of Child Protective Services (CPS)\nwho remain in the hospital beyond the date of medical\ndischarge, i.e., they do not require any special medical\ncare but stay in the hospital because they are awaiting\nplacement decisions or because placement options are\nsparse. The \"boarder baby\" problem is tied to the crimi-\nnalization of mothers with infants who are prenatally\ndrug exposed and to a decrease in the availability of\nappropriate foster homes [165].\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services esti-\nmated that there were 9,700 \"boarder babies\" nationwide\ndefined as infants younger than 12 months of age who\nremain in the hospital beyond the date of medical dis-\ncharge. Almost one-fourth stayed from 21 to over 100\ndays beyond medical discharge. \"Boarder babies\" place\nincreased demands on both the health care system and\nthe child welfare system. A second study recently reported\nnationwide. This represents a 38% increase in the boarder\nwas African American, although the percentage of African\nAlthough the total number of boarder babies increased by\n1998, there was a change in the geographic distribution of\nthese infants. In 1991, three jurisdictions (New York City,\nCook County, Chicago and Los Angeles County)\naccounted for 47% of the boarder baby population. By\n1998, boarder babies in these three jurisdictions\ndecreased 21% and increased by 90% in the rest of the\nnation. Hospital staff in the three jurisdictions attributed\nthe decrease in the boarder baby population to improved\nefforts by the child welfare agencies and hospitals to more\npromptly identify alternative placements for these chil-\ndren. The per diem cost for boarder baby care rose 17%\nboarder babies beyond the point of medical discharge\ndecreased from 22 days to 9 days, and the percent residing\nin hospitals for more than 21 days decreased from 24% to\n12%. Also over this period the percent of premature\ninfants decreased from 47% to 35%, and the percent low\nSixty-five percent of these infants were tested for drug\nof those tested were positive for drugs.

The number of boarder\nbabies discharged to out of home placement was 66% in\nAbandoned infants\nAlthough the terms \"boarder babies\" and \"abandoned\ninfants\" are often used interchangeably, and both are\nHarm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nrelated to prenatal drug exposure, they are differentiated\nby the Federal government. Boarder babies may eventu-\nally be claimed by their families or abandoned and/or\nplaced in alternative care. Abandoned infants are under\nthe age of 12 months, and have not yet been medically\ndischarged but who are unlikely to leave the hospital in\nthe custody of their biological parent(s). This includes\ninfants whose parents are unwilling or unable to provide\ncare and/or whom the child welfare agency determines\ncannot safely remain in the care of their biological par-\nent(s). Abandoned infants are viewed as \"potential\nboarder babies\" whose living arrangements were resolved\nprior to the time of medical discharge. Obviously, infants\nremoved from their biological parent(s) due to maternal\ndrug use during pregnancy fit into this category.\nThe survey also queried hospitals in those jurisdictions\nwith a boarder baby problem about the number of aban-\nincrease of 46%.

Drug-exposed\ninfants were more likely to have conditions such as ane-\nmia, asthma, small size, and feeding, sleep, and behavior\nproblems. Other research has shown that intrauterine\ndrug exposure predisposes infants to poorer outcomes\nsuch as low birthweight and delayed cognitive or motor\ndevelopment. Although research also suggests that the\neffects of intrauterine substance exposure may be subtle\nand most health care professionals may not consider the\nneeds of these infants severe, they do place more demands\nupon the caregivers of these infants. Many caregivers feel\nthey are ill equipped to care for drug-exposed infants.\nThey do not understand the subtle needs of drug-exposed\ninfants and therefore fear they will not be able to manage\ntheir care. These needs place additional demands on the\nfoster family and thus the concerns of not being able to\nmeet those needs contribute to the lack of placements for\ndrug-exposed infants.\nEven when foster care placements are available, foster par-\nents of infants prenatally exposed to drugs have a higher\n\"burnout\" rate [168]; that is, they choose to return the\nbaby more often than if the baby is not drug-exposed.\nThey face a lack of supportive services. Interestingly, adop-\ntive parents of infants whose drug exposure status was\nunknown to them expected the easiest time in caring for\ntheir children [169]. However, with regards to satisfac-\ntion, there was no difference between those families\nadopting substance-exposed infants as compared to those\nadopting infants not exposed to illegal drugs.\nInfants that test positive at birth are more likely to be\nplaced in foster care [170]. They are also more likely to\nhave siblings in foster care and their mothers are more\nlikely to have previous involvement with CPS. Infants\nexposed to drugs prenatally are also likely to be placed in\nkinship (relative foster) care but receive fewer visits from\ntheir biological parents [167]. Yet, these same families do\nnot receive significantly enhanced services. One pressing\nissue is that the problems associated with infant outcome\nare influenced by other factors pertaining to maternal\ndrug use such as poor health, nutrition, depression, pov-\nerty and the postnatal environment of these infants. From\nthis arises the question of which needs and services are\nbeing considered when the infant is placed. All issues sur-\nrounding drug addiction (treatment, lack of support,\nfinances) seem to negatively impact upon parenting.\nAbused or neglected children are at risk for developing\npoor attachments to their caregivers. The emotional con-\nsequences of multiple placements should be considered\nin the placement of infants.\nIn a study to determine factors that affect the nature of\nlegal custody and placement, MacMahon [171] studied\nthe outcome of infants who were dependents of the court\nat discharge from the hospital. Court-ordered services for\nthe mothers differed, although most were required to\nattend a drug rehab program, undergo random drug test-\ning, and receive public health nurse visits. Other families\nwere required to attend psychological counseling and\nparenting education classes. Those infants reunited with\ntheir biological mothers in their first year of life had older\nmothers, had received some prenatal care, did not have\nprevious involvement with CPS, and had mothers who\nhad not had any other children removed from them. Two\nfactors related to a parent never receiving custody of the\nchild were the mother's previous involvement with CPS,\nand having previously lost custody of her child. Since\nsome mothers were not able to comply with court-ordered\ndrug treatment and had positive urine screens, they did\nnot receive full custody of their infants. The MacMahon\nstudy showed that court-ordered monitoring of required\nservices can help with permanency decisions. Yet, this\nraises questions about the additional supportive services\nnecessary for these families.\nHarm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nIncreased communication between the agencies that pro-\nvide care to these at risk infants and families is critical\n[170]. Coordinated case management can decrease obsta-\ncles to services [172]. The increased healthcare risks of\nthese infants suggest the need for more intensive interven-\ntions and training. A comprehensive and multidiscipli-\nnary approach to the care of these infants seems warranted\nincludes an evaluation of developmental areas such as\nmotor, cognition, language, self help skills, coping skills,\nand emotional well being should be conducted at regular\nintervals after placement in foster care. In addition, an\nassessment of the caregiver's parenting skills should be\nconducted. Helping both biological and foster parents\nunderstand the child's needs and capabilities is crucial in\ntrying to de-stigmatize drug-exposed children [174]. Inter-\nventions should include biological and foster parents\nwhen appropriate. Having the biological mother attend\nthe infant's medical or diagnostic appointments can\nenhance continuity of care [167]. Longitudinal follow-up\nis critical. Comparisons of infants in foster care exposed to\ndrugs with infants in foster care not exposed to drugs did\nnot show increased developmental delays in the group of\ninfants prenatally exposed to drugs [174]. However,\napproximately half the infants in each group were at risk\nfor further delays, suggesting the need for long-term fol-\nlow up. Finally, training of foster parents is a key compo-\nnent for enhancing the caregiver child relationship.\nWhile the research is unclear about the outcome of infants\nexposed to drugs, the research concerning those infants\nplaced in foster care stresses the importance of coordi-\nnated, comprehensive, and intense interventions and\nmonitoring. It is understood that the needs of infants pre-\nnatally exposed to drugs include consistent monitoring.\nMore studies are needed to evaluate the longitudinal out-\ncome of these proposed services.\nAdoption and safe families act (ASFA)\nGrowing national concern regarding too many children\nwho linger in foster care led to the passage of the Adop-\ntion and Safe Families Act (ASFA). ASFA was signed into\nextensive changes in federal child welfare policy since the\nAdoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980. ASFA\nseeks to provide the states with the necessary tools and\nincentives to achieve the original goals of Public Law 96-\n27: safety, permanency, and child and family well being.\nThe impetus for ASFA was the general dissatisfaction with\nthe performance of state level child welfare systems in\nachieving these goals for children and families. ASFA\nseeks to strengthen the child welfare system's response to\na child's need for safety and permanency at every point\nalong the continuum of care.\nIn part, the law places safety as the paramount concern in\nthe delivery of child welfare services and decision-making,\nclarifies when efforts to prevent removal or to reunify a\nchild with his or her family are not required, and requires\ncriminal record checks of prospective foster and adoptive\nparents. To promote permanency, ASFA shortens the time\nframes for conducting hearings, creates a new requirement\nfor states to make reasonable efforts to finalize a perma-\nnent placement, and establishes time frames for filing\npetitions to terminate the parental rights for certain chil-\ndren in foster care.\nASFA requires child welfare agencies to pay heightened\nattention to children's well-being and safety and to their\nneeds for permanent families, and is founded on five key\nconcepts: (1) the child's health and safety \"shall be the\nparamount concern\" in determining what efforts should\nbe made to reunify families, (2) in \"aggravated circum-\nstances\" as defined in State law reunification services to\nfamilies are not required (3) when no reunification serv-\nices to families are required, the child needs a quick, alter-\nnative permanent placement, (4) in all other cases,\nservices to families need to be improved and accelerated\nand, (5) in all cases, permanency \u00ad whether the goal is to\nreturn home, adoption, legal guardianship, or legal cus-\ntody with a fit and willing relative \u00ad needs to be expedited.\nUnder ASFA, a permanency hearing must be held in Fam-\nily Court 12 months after the child enters foster care and\nat 12-month intervals thereafter. For ASFA, the date that a\nchild enters foster care is defined as either: 1) sixty-days\nafter the child is removed from the home, or 2) the date\nthat the child is found by a Court to be an abused or\nneglected child, whichever is earlier. At the hearing, the\nFamily Court judge must determine whether and when\nthe child will be either returned to the birth parents,\nplaced for adoption, referred for legal guardianship,\nplaced with a fit and willing relative, or placed in another\nplanned permanent living arrangement.\nIn order to ensure that children do not linger indefinitely\nin foster care, ASFA creates a presumption that a petition\nto terminate parental rights must be filed, and concur-\nrently steps to finalize an adoptive placement must be ini-\ntiated in the following three circumstances: Where a child\nhas been in foster care for 15 of the last 22 months, OR\nwhere a court has determined a child to be an abandoned\ninfant, OR where a parent has committed certain crimes\nagainst the child or a sibling (i.e., murder, manslaughter,\nattempted murder or manslaughter, or a felony assault\nresulting in serious bodily injury to the child or another\nchild of the parent).\nAlthough ASFA creates the presumption that certain cate-\ngories of foster children should be freed and adopted\nHarm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nquickly, it also creates three grounds for exceptions to that\npresumption: (1) at the option of the State, the child is\nbeing cared for by a relative, (2) a State agency has docu-\nmented in the case plan (available for court review) a\ncompelling reason for determining that filing a TPR peti-\ntion would not be in the best interests of the child, or (3)\nthe state has not provided to the family of the child, con-\nsistent with the time period in the State case plan, such\nservices as the State deems necessary for the safe return of\nthe child to the child's home if reasonable efforts to\nreunify the family are required.\nBarriers to treatment\nThe overriding feeling among policy makers and social\nwelfare agencies is that preserving the family is important\nwhere at all possible. This view has been reinforced by\nASFA. Substance use is not always a clear indicator of a\nparent's lack of commitment to their child. In fact many\ndrug users are committed to being parents. One large bar-\nrier to seeking treatment is that the substance addict is\nafraid that if they seek help they will lose their children\n[175]. While the main goal of civil interventions is to pro-\ntect children rather than punish mothers, many women\nview them as the state trying to take their children. Thus\nagencies have taken steps to make removing children\nfrom their homes the last resort. If this cannot be\nachieved, the next goal is family reunification and often\nthe success of a program is measured by how effectively\nthe program preserves the family.\nThus in an attempt to preserve the family, the preferred\nmethod of state intervention has become treatment and\nrehabilitation. There has been little consensus over the\nyears on the best methods to employ in treating pregnant\nwomen with substance abuse problems. While treatment\nis recognized as the best method of addressing the issue,\nthere are many problems that plague it that have made it\ndifficult to implement on a large scale. These problems\ninclude a shortage of drug treatment programs, the resist-\nance of drug treatment programs to including pregnant\nwomen, lack of consensus on the most effective method\nof treatment, cost, and whether treatment should be vol-\nThe reluctance of drug treatment programs to accept preg-\nnant women is a large problem that has plagued the treat-\nment approach to state intervention. In trying to\nunderstand this phenomenon it is important to note that\nhistorically drug treatment programs have exhibited a\nreluctance and insensitivity to addicted women in general.\nIn the early 1970s the National Institute on Drug Abuse\nbegan research that targeted women addicts. In the treat-\nment programs they surveyed, they found that male staff\nand participants were openly hostile to women clients,\nemployed a confrontational \"therapeutic\" style uncom-\nfortable for women, and directed them into gender-stere-\notyped tasks and training which offered minimal\ncompensation or chance for success after completion of\nthe program. The programs also failed to address many\nissues that played a strong role in female drug addiction.\nThese issues included the environments of violence and\nsexual exploitation in which the women often live. The\nprograms provided no provision for the care of the\nwomen's children and also included no contraceptive and\nensured lack of participation by pregnant women in estab-\nlished programs.\nReviews of the literature with regard to chemical depend-\nency reveal that as a group the female user has been over-\nlooked. Research also shows the lack of availability of\ntreatment programs for women, specifically pregnant or\nconsideration to the funding of women's treatment and\nprevention programs [179]. Still, programs frequently\noverlook the special needs of the female user. Historically,\nin studies that examined treatment outcomes, approxi-\nmately half of these studies included women, whereas a\nvery small number focused on women alone. Studies that\nincluded pregnant women are even fewer. Those that do\ninclude this population focus mainly on birth outcome of\nthe baby or early infant development, and very little focus\nwas placed on treatment issues for women, or treatment\nusing women tend to be younger and are more likely to be\npregnant than the typical female client found in alcohol-\nism treatment centers.\nStates have used a variety of approaches to address prob-\nlems created by prenatal substance use. These approaches\ninclude criminal prosecution of the mother, civil interven-\ntion by child protective service agencies, and public health\ninitiatives providing education, intervention, and treat-\nment. Some states are combining approaches by creating\n\"drug courts\" (discussed later) that mandate treatment\nand/or jail time. However, at this time, no state has made\npregnant drug addiction illegal, per se. Instead, states have\napplied statutes dealing with child abuse, assault, drug\ndealing to a minor, etc., to pregnant women who use\ndrugs. In fact, the Supreme Court recently ruled that it is\nillegal for birthing hospitals to provide law enforcement\nagencies the results of drug screens performed in the hos-\npital. It is unconstitutional for hospital workers to test\nmaternity patients for illegal drug use if the purpose is to\nalert the police to a crime [183].\nAs mentioned earlier, 16 states consider alcohol or drug\nuse during pregnancy sufficient grounds for an investiga-\ntion of parental fitness and/or removal of the children\nfrom the home. Because of this, women using substances\nHarm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nduring their pregnancy are often reluctant to seek help.\nThe National Women's Resource Center also reports that\nwomen are unwilling to be separated from their children\nfor long therapeutic interventions and fear losing custody\nmore than criminal prosecution. Yet, Hser et al. [184]\nreports that legal pressure is a strong predictor of entry\ninto treatment.\nThe financial cost of treatment is high. The National Asso-\nciation of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors found\nthat in 1997, states spent approximately $2 billion on\ntreatment programs and the federal government contrib-\nuted approximately $1.5 billion more. Funding for these\ntreatment programs came from such sources as The Sub-\nstance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) Block\nGrant, which mandates that 5% of the grant must be allo-\ncated for pregnant women unless the state can demon-\nstrate that the needs of pregnant users are already being\nmet. Transitional Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)\nfunds can be used for treatment if these funds are used for\nnon-medical services such as those provided by psycholo-\ngists or social workers. Despite the availability of funds\nand allocation for a variety of services, only one third of\nindividuals admitted to drug treatment programs were\nwomen. Clearly, an even smaller percentage of pregnant\nusers are receiving treatment.\nAlthough the financial cost of treatment is great, there is\nlimited information regarding the cost effectiveness of\ndrug treatment. One study compared hospitalization rates\nfor infants of two groups of women [185]. Both groups\nconsisted of pregnant drug-using women. One group\nincluded women who had enrolled in a treatment pro-\ngram that provided both prenatal medical and drug abuse\ntreatment services. The second group consisted of preg-\nnant drug using women who did not undergo treatment\nbecause it was unavailable. Infants of mothers in the\ntreatment groups had substantially better outcomes at\nbirth and were less likely to need intensive care services.\nMothers in this group also showed less drug use. Total cost\ncomparisons showed that even with the cost of the treat-\nment program included, the cost for intensive care serv-\nices far outweighed the cost for treatment for pregnant\ndrug-using women. While further cost effectiveness stud-\nies are warranted, this study indicates both the financial\nand medical benefit of drug treatment.\nOur meta-analysis of the effects of prenatal cocaine expo-\nsure on school age children showed that special education\nservices for these children cost our society upwards of\n$372 million per year [91]. That figure represents addi-\ntional costs to society due to prenatal cocaine exposure\nalone. If that money was spent on services for these moth-\ners and infants prenatally or at birth, the school age defi-\ncits could be prevented or at least minimized, the children\nwould not have to wait for services until school age, and\ntherefore they would suffer less. Intervention would be\nprovided while the child's brain was still in the period of\nmost rapid growth and thus easier to change, as compared\nwith school age when there is less brain plasticity. In addi-\ntion, there would be cost savings because the children\nwould not need as extensive (if any) special education\nservices. In a recent study of children growing up in\npoverty (not drug-exposed), it was found that an increase\nimproved social skills and school readiness (Day care\nstudy, November CD). That's $4,466 per year compared\nto the $6,335 average cost for special education services\nyears later once children start school [91].\nOne way to think about cost savings is through integrated\ndrug treatment. Weisner et al. [186] found that patients\nwith psychiatric and medical conditions linked to sub-\nstance abuse can benefit from receiving their medical and\naddiction care in the same treatment program, without\nsignificant higher costs than is the case when treatments\nare separate. The prevalence of medical disorders is high\namong substance abuse patients but medical services are\nseldom provided in coordination with substance abuse\ntreatment. This randomized clinical trial compared inde-\npendent delivery of substance abuse treatment with treat-\nment integrated with primary care. Patients in the\nintegrated services group had higher abstinence rates and\nlonger periods of abstinence than did patients in the inde-\npendent services group. Moreover, costs were not higher\nin the integrated services group.\nOn the other hand, we need to be clear that policy recom-\nmendations should not be based on cost-benefit analysis\nalone. A sobering reminder was the Philip Morris report\nthat the Czech government had saved 147 million dollars\nin health care, pensions and housing as a result of\npremature deaths due to smoking. Drug treatment is jus-\ntified because people suffer and need it regardless of\neconomics.\nHistory of treatment issues\nPolicymakers and legislators have \"led the charge\" in try-\ning to curb the problem of maternal substance abuser.\nHowever it is virtually impossible to have an impact\nunless the complex legal, ethical, emotional, and moral\nissues are seriously examined and overcome. Although\nthere has been a boom of research in what substance\nexposure does to a fetus and subsequent child, there is a\nconsiderable lack of empirical research on treatment\noptions for the substance-using mother [182]. At first,\nthere was the documented shortage of substance abuse\ntreatment programs, particularly for pregnant women\n[182]. In fact, most traditional treatment programs were\ndesigned primarily for men and were not appropriate for\nHarm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nwomen, especially pregnant women [187]. However, after\nthe evidence regarding cocaine exposure in the 1980's,\nmany government agencies such as the National Institute\non Drug Abuse (NIDA), the Center for Substance Abuse\nTreatment (CSAT), etc., began to support treatment pro-\ngrams specifically designed for the pregnant or mothering\nresearch demonstration projects that focused on the treat-\nment of drug-using pregnant women. A description of\nthese projects, termed the Perinatal 20, in addition to sev-\neral other model programs, will be discussed later.\nDespite the increased support and availability of treat-\nment programs, there exist serious barriers to treatment\nfor pregnant substance users. Very few treatment pro-\ngrams have existed for women or have used treatment\nmodalities designed specifically for women. Many pro-\ngrams have relied on male-based recovery models. These\ntreatment approaches followed the medical or disease\nmodel, with a focus on the client's problem without any\nregard for any other variables that may foster treatment.\nThis approach, focused on the individual and not the\npregnant addict within the context of her family or envi-\nronment, presents a challenge to women willing to access\ntreatment. For instance, it is difficult for many users to be\naccepted into programs. Breitbart, Chavkin, and Wise\n[188] surveyed five U.S. cities as to the availability of treat-\nment programs to pregnant women. Although the large\nmajority of programs did accept pregnant women (80%),\nmany did not accept women on Medicaid and did not\nprovide or arrange for childcare. Addiction treatment is\nmore effective when it is designed to account for women's\nneeds. Addiction treatment counselors find that gender-\nspecific treatment is much more effective than mixed-gen-\nder approaches. For seriously addicted women, the most\neffective treatments are long-term and residential. Also\nlow-income women often have a variety of other service\nneeds such as the need to learn parenting and career skills\nAnother barrier to treatment is identification of the target\npopulation. Many pregnant substance users are reluctant\nto admit to drug use for fear of losing custody of their chil-\ndren especially in states that legally require or practice\nmandatory reporting. Many of these women also fear\ncriminal prosecution. The fear or threat of domestic vio-\nlence is another serious concern.\nThe stigma against a pregnant user has been discussed in\nthe literature. These women are frequently seen as weak\nwilled and negligent of their children and are often\nblamed for exposing their children to drugs [190]. This in\nturn has led to legal interventions such as criminal prose-\ncution, mandatory treatment, and removal of custody\n[144]. In addition, research has documented negative atti-\ntudes towards pregnant users by treatment providers,\n[182] which may make them reluctant to admit substance\nuse.\nAnother barrier to treatment is the recognized lack of\nresources designed to help the pregnant addict and her\nchildren. Staff often lack knowledge and training regard-\ning issues of pregnancy and addiction. The first challenge\nis a concern over to how to medically manage these\nwomen. Addiction to alcohol and other drugs is a bio-\nchemical process. Many addicted women wish to quit\nusing drugs or alcohol but are physically unable to stop.\nDetoxification is usually the first step in treatment. Usu-\nally this takes place is an inpatient setting and is a short\nterm way to eliminate chemical dependence, although it\ndoes not treat the enduring psychological and behavioral\naspects of addiction. Since there is a fear of harming the\nunborn fetus with many of the medications used for\ndetoxification, opiate-dependent women are especially\nsusceptible to this barrier. Thus, their access is limited to\nmost residential treatment programs. The concerns seem\nto be centered around the fact that detoxification can pre-\ncipitate fetal withdrawal in utero, and that there is a high\nrate of recidivism among opiate-dependent individuals,\nwhich makes it harder to keep the unborn baby away from\ninconsistent levels of a drug and drug impurities. Many\nprograms are ill equipped to include infants and children\ninto the program. There is also a fear of liability for nega-\ntive birth outcomes and a lack of appropriate care for the\ninfant and/or other children while the mother is in treat-\nment. The lack of services for both the mother and the\nbaby together leads to mothers being reluctant to obtain\ntreatment because of the amount of time spent away from\nthe child. All too often, it is a choice between treatment or\ncaring for a new infant and other children [182]. Even\nthough programs do not include treatment services for\nchildren, they do not offer childcare as an alternative or\nincentive to treatment. Once again, the substance user\nmust choose extended time away from the infant in order\nto obtain help.\nSuch factors contribute to the low numbers of pregnant\nsubstance users receiving medical care. When women do\nreceive prenatal care it provides an opportunity for inter-\nvention or access to support providers. Prenatal care clin-\nics may also be a venue for screening for substance use.\nSeveral brief screening tools have been devised that are\nappropriate for individuals with minimal substance abuse\ntraining [191]. However, many treatment programs do\nnot include prenatal care as a vital component.\nAnother barrier is the lack of coordination between the\nresources needed by the pregnant substance user and lack\nof personnel who are sensitive to the issues and needs of\nthis population. Also, many physicians are reluctant to\nHarm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nidentify the pregnant user for a variety of reasons. For\ninstance, they may feel that they are ill equipped to pro-\nvide pregnant women with support, or they may have lit-\ntle confidence in social service agencies.\nFinally, women may not seek treatment because they do\nnot have transportation to and from programs and for\neconomic reasons. They may not have insurance, money\nto pay for treatment, childcare, or treatment programs that\nare even available to them.\nHistorically, the approach for drug and alcohol treatment\nhas been individually based, thus causing the pregnant\naddict to represent two avenues for intervention. Treat-\nment professionals are often divided. First, there are those\nconcerned with child welfare and second, there are those\nconcerned with the addiction, thus leaving a clear lack of\ncoordinated, comprehensive, family centered treatment\n[182]. Instead, a fragmented social service system stands\nin the wake of this division. Funding is usually not family\ncentered so each service necessary in the treatment is in a\nseparate location with unique regulations and procedures.\nCoordinating and accessing all these services becomes a\nburden and thus services are not utilized. Clearly, barriers\nto treatment exist for pregnant women and many pro-\ngrams are not providing the vital services needed for\nsuccess.\nMerely accessing treatment should be considered as a\ncomponent for success. There is little definitive evidence\nin the treatment literature with regard to why a client\ninterrupts or stops treatment. There may be differing\nrationales based on the type of user, i.e., age, race, educa-\ntion, gender, pregnant or parenting women. Hser et al.\n[184] examined factors affecting treatment entry. Charac-\nteristics that predicted treatment entry include legal pres-\nsure, lower levels of psychological distress and family or\nsocial problems, and prior successful treatment experi-\nences. Perhaps treatment programs should identify such\nfactors as part of their recruitment and service delivery and\ncreate individual, family centered treatment services.\nResearch on treatment effectiveness\nThere is no clear empirical evidence as to what treatment\nmodality is best for substance using mothers, including\ninpatient or outpatient. The limited research on treatment\nprograms is in part due to small sample sizes and the obvi-\nous lack of control or comparison groups. Hence, most of\nthe information about treatment programs is descriptive\nin nature. Amidst the descriptions of these programs exists\na discussion of what is the most effective approach to\ntreatment. In this question lies the debate over one-step\nexpectation programs of immediate abstinence or pro-\ngrams that institute a stage process of recovery. No current\nstage measure is designed specifically for substance using\npopulations. Prochaska and DiClemente's Transtheoreti-\ncal Model of Behavior Change posits that an intervention\nshould fit an individual stage of readiness for change. This\nstage model has been used successfully with cigarette\nsmokers. However, some research suggests this may not\nbe an appropriate model for street drug-using populations\ndifficulty completing a lengthy questionnaire and have\ndifficulty with the vocabulary used within them [193].\nWing [194] proposed a four-stage model of alcohol recov-\nery that included steps for life planning and recom-\nmended nursing interventions. Kearney [192] suggests\nthat this model may be more appropriate for substance\nusers because of the similarities between alcohol and drug\nusers, and because this model recognizes the need for\nwhole life restructuring required for lasting recovery.\nOnce again, even with the increase in treatment services\nthere is little empirical research on them. The outcomes\nfor these are usually retention in the treatment program\nand/or negative drug screens or abstinence from sub-\nstances. Treatment retention has been related to successful\nprogram outcome [195]. The NIDA supported Perinatal\n20 consists of twenty individual demonstration projects\nlocated across the country. Outcome information is not\npublished for all of the projects as of yet, however, results\nfor some of the projects will be discussed below in the\ncontext of type of treatment program.\nResidential treatment programs\nand parenting substance dependent women who were\nplaced in two residential treatment programs. In addition\nto drug use, this study examined the effectiveness of\nparenting component and aftercare services. Measures of\nparenting skills, self-esteem, etc., were compared before\nand after program participation. Birth outcomes were also\nexamined. Results suggest that participants improved con-\nsiderably in their parenting knowledge and self-esteem.\nWith regard to infant outcome, few infants exhibited poor\nbirth outcomes such as low birth weight or early gesta-\ntional ages. Completion of the program resulted in longer\nperiods of abstinence.\nThe Salvation Army Treatment program in Honolulu is a\nlong-term residential chemical dependency treatment\nfacility. Women have been admitted to the program for\napproximately 6 \u00ad 18 months either with or without their\nchildren. Most of the women are referred to the program\nby child protective services or the courts. The residents of\nthe program are usually single, unemployed, and have a\ncriminal history. Treatment plans are developed for the\nmother and if needed, her child. Treatment usually\nincludes individual and group counseling, family groups,\npractical life skills, trauma resolution groups, and parent-\nHarm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5\n(page number not for citation purposes)\ning classes. The treatment team includes addiction coun-\nselors, early childhood specialists, nurses, social workers,\nand psychiatrists. Women enrolled in the program also\nhave a weekly parent child therapy session to maximize\ntheir interaction capabilities. This program also includes a\ntherapeutic nursery for the children focused on develop-\nmental mastery and remediation of any problems associ-\nated with prenatal drug exposure. A psychiatric day\ntreatment program for children aged 3\u00ad7 years who have\nemotional or behavioral problems is also located on the\nprogram's campus. This program has conducted an inter-\nnal study of treatment retention for participants who\nentered the program with their children as compared to\nparticipants who did not enter with children. Mothers\nadmitted to the program with their children had better\ntreatment retention and higher rates of successful treat-\nment completion (treatment goals met) than women\nadmitted without their children [197].\nAmity Inc. in Arizona revised its program in 1981 to be\nmore conducive to the female user. The female to male cli-\nent ratio increased, regular groups were created, and chil-\ndren were permitted to stay with their mothers in the\nresidential program. These changes significantly\nimproved the treatment outcomes for both men and\nwomen. The length of stay for the women increased over\ntime; in fact, the length of stay for women with children\nin the program was highest overall. The authors suggest\nanother factor in addition to including children that\ncontributed to the improved success. This was the creation\nof an environment in which female clients feel safe in dis-\nclosing and addressing treatment issues [198]. In the early\n90's, Amity received funds to continue these changes from\nA Perinatal 20 project conducted by Hughes et al. [200]\nwomen with children who were randomly assigned to\neither a standard residential treatment program or a dem-\nonstration residential program, in which the children\nwere allowed to live with their mothers. Operation PAR or\nPAR Village includes a treatment component focused on\nworking with the client as a parent. The psychosocial\ninterventions employed are aimed at facilitating the par-\nent-child relationship through group interventions,\nparenting education, and structured bonding activities.\nOperation PAR also includes licensed therapeutic daycare.\nClients in the demonstration component of the program\nhad significantly longer length of stay, suggesting that\nincluding children in the treatment program has implica-\ntions for success. The authors also suggest that the inclu-\nsion of children could strengthen mother self-esteem and\nmother-child bonds while also improving post-treatment\noutcomes.\nOutpatient programs\nHaller, Knisely, Dawson, and Schnoll [201] compared\nsubjects randomly assigned to two outpatient treatment\nprograms. One program was a time-limited program of\nfive months. The other was a self-paced program for up to\n18 months. Results showed that the women in the time-\nlimited program had significant reductions in alcohol and\ndrug use.\nAnother Perinatal 20 project was conducted in South Cen-\ntral Los Angeles. This program was designed for the special\ntreatment and support needs of drug-using women. It also\nsought to test the effectiveness of a modified relapse pre-\nvention approach. This project compared an intensive six-\nmonth treatment program with a traditional outpatient\nprogram. The day treatment component focused on drug\nrelapse prevention and competency building and empow-\nerment. Clients were required to participate for five and\none half hours per day, seven days per week. The model\nwas based on the intensity of a residential seven-day week\nprogram; however, clients were allowed to return to their\nhomes at night. Clients received four hours per week of\neducation regarding drug abuse, and ten to twelve hours\nper week of group or individual counseling to address\nproblem solving. Refinement of cognitive/behavioral\naction plans for relapse prevention was addressed in the\ntwice-weekly individual counseling sessions. Clients in\nthe program were also required to complete six hours of\nparent training focused on the special care of infants\nexposed to drugs. Two days per week the mothers were\nrequired to bring their infants to the site and engage in the\npractice of childcare in the nursery. The goal of this com-\nponent was to improve the client's ability to bond and\ninteract positively with her infant, thus strengthening\ninfant physical and social development. A parent educa-\ntion component was required to help strengthen parent-\ning skills with older children. Here, clients were educated\nabout development and positive approaches to discipline.\nAn alcohol and drug free lifestyle was required, although\nclients were allowed up to three lapses. These lapses pro-\nvided the clients and professionals valuable information\nregarding relapse triggers, and aided the relapse preven-\ntion plan.\nThe outpatient component was not as intense as the day\ntreatment component. Here, the problem of drug depend-\nence was addressed in semi-structured groups, individual\ncounseling, and other program activities that included\nmale as well as female clients. The clients in this compo-\nnent also received parent education but did not partici-\npate in special training regarding infant development.\nThis program was a five-day a week, one and one half\nhours per day commitment. Clients could participate in\nthis component for a year or more provided they appeared\nto be benefiting from the program.\nHarm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nResults suggest that an intensive day treatment model is\nmore effective than a standard outpatient treatment\nmodel for a variety of reasons. First, the staff at the day\ntreatment program was comprised mostly of women and\nthe staff caseload was smaller that at the outpatient pro-\ngram. The study reports that if the day treatment clients\nretained custody of their infant, it was a predictor of\nlength of stay in treatment, however, if the mother had\nmore children at home, this was a negative predictor of\nlength of stay. The authors suggest that it may have been\nharder for the mothers to secure childcare for more than\none child, if she were in an intensive seven-day a week\nprogram. With regard to amount of social support or psy-\nchological distress (reported by the clients), neither pre-\ndicted treatment retention [202].\nA New York City program, Pregnant Addicts and Addicted\nMothers Program (PAAM) was created in 1975. PAAM is\nan outpatient program for pregnant women who are\naddicted to opiates or methadone. Potential clients who\nhave multiple addictions must receive inpatient detoxifi-\ncation before attending PAAM. Women enrolled in the\nprogram must attend the program five times per week for\nmethadone maintenance and attend prenatal visits, indi-\nvidual counseling sessions, and parent education classes.\nThere is a preschool nursery incorporated into PAAM and\nchildren are periodically assessed via the Bayley Scales of\nInfant Development. Several of the goals of the PAAM\nprogram concern helping the mother have a normal preg-\nnancy and deliver a healthy newborn, as well as helping\nthe newborn develop normal cognitive and motor abili-\nties. This is a comprehensive program that has demon-\nstrated positive outcomes such as treatment compliance\nand favorable newborn outcomes [180].\nCalifornia's Options for Recovery was created as an alter-\nnative to incarceration or relinquishment of custody of\nchildren by substance dependent women. Options for\nRecovery offered a specific residential and intensive day\ntreatment services for dependence on alcohol and or other\ndrugs, comprehensive case management, foster parent\nrecruitment and training, and respite care for drug\nexposed infants. This program also included a full evalua-\ntion component to understand its effectiveness. Seven\nsites (Alameda County, Contra Costa County, Harbor\nSouth Bay, South Central LA, Sacramento County, Shasta\nCounty) were developed to help pregnant alcohol- and\nother drug-dependent women, postpartum women iden-\ntified with a prenatal history of alcohol and other drug\nexposure, and parenting women impaired in their ability\nto care for their children due to drug addiction. Most of\nthese projects included goals of increasing services to drug\ndependent women, alleviating the deleterious effects of\ndrug dependence, improving health outcomes for preg-\nnant and postpartum women and their children, and\nimproving family integrity and quality of life.\nTo provide comprehensive profiles of Options for Recov-\nery, many evaluation approaches were used. For instance,\nin addition to client demographics and satisfaction, staff\nwere also surveyed and interviewed regarding their\nimpressions of the program. The development of the chil-\ndren participating in the program was also included.\nResults have been published regarding profiles of the cli-\nents, outcomes for participants, family functioning, child\nhealth outcomes, and participant satisfaction. Specifi-\ncally, there were increased numbers of children reunited\nwith their biological mother after foster care placement\nand children in Options homes were more likely to be\nreunited with their biological mothers. Children partici-\npating in Options programs displayed normal child devel-\nopment on standardized tests. Cost effectiveness was also\nassessed for Options for Recovery. Options for Recovery,\nas compared to the combined cost of incarceration and\nother drug and alcohol treatment, was significantly more\nAcknowledging all barriers present in treating pregnant\nand postpartum substance-using women, the Federal gov-\nernment granted money to demonstration programs to\naddress these barriers and to combat the epidemic of chil-\ndren born substance-exposed. The Parent and Child\nEnrichment Program (PACE) program in Harlem began in\n1990 as a result of these grants. The program integrated\nthe services of social workers, drug treatment counselors,\nparent educators, childcare workers, and medical person-\nnel, including a pediatrician and a nurse midwife. PACE\nwas set up to provide comprehensive, women-centered,\nand family-oriented services. The key focus of the program\nwas to provide a flexible schedule of treatment to the\nwomen in order to maintain a high retention rate within\nthe program without encouraging relapses into drug use\n[176]. The successes and failures of the program provided\ngood learning opportunities for the future development\nof similar programs.\nThe program reinforced the need to develop a female\nmodel of drug treatment. Many women enter drug treat-\nment for different reasons, have different reasons for stay-\ning, and have different needs than men. PACE's clients\noften came into the program in order to be drug free at the\ntime of their child's birth in order to keep their child, or to\nregain custody of their children. They struggled with feel-\nings of being overwhelmed at their roles as mothers and\ncaretakers. PACE showed that program flexibility to meet\nthe needs of the individual client was critical. Compre-\nhensive care in one location (one-stop shopping) also\ndecreased barriers to treatment, allowed women to estab-\nlish trusting relationships with a consistent team of pro-\nHarm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nviders, reduced the likelihood of dropping out, enabled\nstaff to get to know clients well, and allowed women to\nfeel comfortable disclosing sensitive personal informa-\ntion to providers. Many of the program's clients lacked the\nnecessary skills to be good parents. Offering parenting\nclasses gave the women confidence in their abilities to\neffectively parent. PACE recognized that drug relapse pre-\nvention must begin from day one of the treatment pro-\ngram so that the women would be aware of the danger of\nrelapse and be prepared to deal with the urge to go back\nto drug use. For many women, their drug use was related\nto their status as abused women. The counselors realized\nthat addressing this issue was as key as addressing the drug\nuse itself. Finally, PACE showed that drug use does not\nhappen in a vacuum. Including family members in the\ntreatment process may help to establish a network of sup-\nport for the women, both while they are in treatment and\nQuantitative results of the program have shown that the\nprogram has had a positive effect on its clients and thus\nthe project is a useful model for drug treatment programs.\nAlso the program helped to start a trend in the city of New\nYork of providing treatment for pregnant and postpartum\nwomen. Table 3 compares services in New York between\nVital components for success\nMost professionals agree that a comprehensive program is\nbest for mothers [204]. Services should be family cen-\ntered, community based, multidisciplinary, individually\ntailored, and promote competency of the individual\na framework for the delivery of services to substance\ndependent women. This model develops prevention and\ntreatment in the context of a multigenerational and\nlifespan perspective. A more family centered model of care\nmay improve treatment and post treatment outcomes.\nTable 4[182] includes a list of programs and their\ncomponents.\nThere is general agreement in the literature that programs\nneed to be comprehensive and include the following com-\nponents: a cognitive/behavioral approach, parent role\nmodels and support, educational and vocational plan-\nning, transportation, mostly female staff, staff sensitive to\nissues of population, relapse considered part of treatment,\noutreach, case management, family support services such\nas child care, medical (including prenatal care), mental\nhealth services, multi-method approaches to measure suc-\ncess, follow-up, parent training, child development serv-\nices, family planning, legal services, crisis intervention,\nrespite care, life skills management, pharmacological serv-\nices, referral services, self-help groups and stress\nmanagement.\nFamily drug courts\nMany states are establishing drug courts that deal with\ndrug offenders.

The reason that this is important is because the term\n\"client\" implies that the court has an obligation to offer\noffender is given the opportunity to contract with the\ncourt to seek treatment instead of receiving a jail sentence.\nParticipants in the drug court system are referred to the\ncourts from the regular judicial system. If the client agrees\nto seek treatment, she will receive inpatient detoxification\nservices, and in the case of pregnant women, medical\ntreatment to provide for the care of the fetus during the\nwithdrawal stage of recovery. After the initial inpatient\ndetoxification, clients are required to enroll in a one- to\ntwo- year process of outpatient treatment and aftercare\nThroughout the course of the treatment process partici-\npants report to a caseworker and the drug court judge,\nwho monitor the progress of the individual. The partici-\npants are often drug tested to ensure that they are indeed\n\"clean\" and are thus abiding by the terms of their\n\"sentence\" [189]. There are different consequences,\ndependent on the particular court, for not complying with\nthe terms. For some courts this may mean immediate\nexpulsion from the program and jail time; for others the\nparticipant may be given a second chance to prove her\ncommitment.\nAt the present time there are 195 drug courts in 43 differ-\nent states and territories. Between 50 and 65 percent of\noffenders choose to enroll in the treatment programs\n[206]. While the majority of these courts have not been\nopen long enough to truly evaluate the success of the pro-\ngrams, initial results are promising. Only time will tell if\nthe court programs are able to foster long term success,\nmeasured by a lack of relapse into drug use on the part of\nthe participants in the programs.\nFamily drug courts are a relatively new innovation in an\neffort to protect the best interests of the child. Drug courts\nthat focused on the adult substance abuser were estab-\nlished in the late 1980s. However, it was not until the\n1990s that drug courts dealing with family and depend-\nency issues were established. A family drug court is\ndefined as \"a drug court that deals with cases involving\nparental rights...which arise out of the substance abuse of\na parent\" [207]. Once children are in danger of or have\nalready been removed from their parents, the family drug\ncourt attempts to help the parent regain or retain custody\nor if necessary, permanently place the child. This is done\nthrough intensive use of resources, and commitment on\nthe part of the parent, the treatment team and the judge.\nFamily drug courts were developed because traditional\ncase management methods were not working with sub-\nstance abusing parents. For example, a typical case would\ninvolve a referral for abuse and neglect that would be sub-\nstance abuse-based with the children removed. Parents\nwould be given a list of actions to regain custody and they\nwould be given a court date 6\u00ad12 months later. However,\nsocial service workers trying to motivate the parents did\nnot have the power to compel compliance and the parents\nlacked the skills to follow through with that much lati-\ntude.

The timeframe imposed by ASFA has added\nmomentum to the development of court programs and\nprocedures to enable families to remain intact, or if\nnecessary, to terminate parental rights allowing children\naccess to placement.\nThere are currently more than 37 family drug courts oper-\nating in 27 states in the U.S. plus 10 combined adult/juve-\nnile/family programs, and an additional 50 programs are\nbeing planned. Almost all these programs (88%) focus on\ncivil abuse and neglect cases and 4% are handling abuse\nand neglect cases prosecuted as criminal matters. Most\ncurrently enrolled and there are 3,500 children involved.\nare Caucasian, 36% African American and 15% Hispanic,\n63% of the females (and 48% of the males) are single, 8%\nare living with a significant other, 70% of the females\n(52% males) have no high school or GED, 44% of the\nfemales (5% males) are unemployed.

Another 300 participants representing 20% of\nthose enrolled have been terminated for noncompliance.\nThere are currently 900 participants estimated to be\nenrolled.\nThe demographic characteristics of family drug court par-\nticipants indicate that almost all have had at least one\nprior contact with CPS and 75% have had two or more\nprior contacts. Approximately half have had al least one\nprior criminal (generally misdemeanor) conviction prior\nto entering the family drug court with less than 10% hav-\ning been incarcerated for a drug related offense. 68% are\nsingle and not living with a significant other, 22% were\nliving with a significant other (who in most cases was the\nparent of at least one of the children) and 6% were mar-\nHispanic/Latino and 8% Asian/other. More than two\nthirds are unemployed. More than two thirds have been\nusing drugs for more than 5 years, 15% for more than 10\nyears with the most common drugs of choice as alcohol,\ncocaine and marijuana with one-third reporting addition\nto methamphetamine and/or heroin. Addiction to\ncocaine, heroin and methamphetamine is rising and more\nthan half report addiction to prescription medication.\nMost have been enrolled in at least one treatment pro-\ngram prior to entering family drug court. At least 75%\nhave a history of being abused and more than one third\nsuffer from mental health problems.\nOutcome research has shown a significant decrease in\ndrug use by participants once they enter the program with\n95% showing negative drug tests [208]. The frequency of\ndrug testing and the frequency of negative drug tests for\nparents in family drug court programs are higher than for\nparents in other abuse/neglect (non-drug court) pro-\ngrams. All participants who completed a family drug court\nprogram were able to improve their legal relationship\nwith their children, one third retained or regained legal\ncustody and the remaining two thirds retained or regained\nvisitation. Participation in family drug courts also resulted\nin obtaining or retaining employment in one half of the\ncases, two thirds enrolled in vocational training an addi-\ntional one third completed their GED and/or enrolled in\ncollege, 90% received mental health treatment, and 40\ndrug free babies were born to participants while in the\nprogram. Half of the courts have developed alumni\ngroups or other aftercare support networks.\nIt should be clear that the focus of family drug court is in\nthe best interest of the child, while addressing the needs of\nthe parent participant and the family. These interests may\nbe in conflict, as the court must be prepared to make per-\nmanency decisions, especially with ASFA. In addition, the\nbest interest of the child should not be narrowly defined\n\u00ad that which helps the parents is in the best interests of the\nchild. Although substance abuse is the trigger that brings\nthe child to the attention of the courts, family drug courts\nmust go far beyond treating the parent's addiction issue\nalone. The treatment team needs to address the issues that\nimpact the parent's ability to stay sober, including special-\nized services such as mental health, domestic violence,\nsexual abuse, parenting, social support and financial\nresources (housing and employment) and by trying to\nidentify strengths in the family.\nModel programs\nPrograms are being established through the cooperative\nefforts of the courts, social service workers, and treatment\nprofessionals that can overcome the barriers preventing\npregnant women from seeking treatment, including\naccess to services, fear of losing their children, cost, and\nlack of coordination of care and available services.\nThe Dependency Court Recovery Project in San Diego\nCounty, California, coordinates treatment services, as well\nHarm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nas other social welfare services the court provides, in order\nto keep families intact, or at the very least to reduce the\namount of time that children spend in foster care. The\nmain feature of the program is the Substance Abuse\nRecovery Management System. The purpose of this system\nis to make alcohol and drug treatment immediately avail-\nable for parents. In this system when a referral is made\nfrom the juvenile court, the family is assigned a social\nworker, responsible for overall case management. The\nparent is also assigned a recovery specialist, responsible\nfor ensuring that the dependent parent is assigned to the\nappropriate alcohol and drug services and the necessary\nfollow-up case management.\nThis program has been successful in meeting statutory\ncase processing timelines, expediting substance abuse\nassessment, achieving \"reasonable efforts\", reducing the\nfrequency and length of removal of children from their\nhomes for placement in foster care, providing immedi-\nately available services and \"safe house\" residences for the\nparent with their child(ren) during recovery, increasing\npersonal accountability and responsibility of parents for\nprogress of individual case plans, providing a recovery\nmanagement system to engage parents in appropriate\ntreatment, monitoring progress and increase judicial over-\nsight, reducing court workload, determining timely and\nappropriate placement for the children, and\naccomplishing family preservation, reunification or early\npermanent placement.\nThe success of the program has been attributed to several\nfactors. These include that all the necessary treatment serv-\nices are made readily available to the women, thus the\nissue of transportation and access to care are overcome.\nThey also include the establishment of treatment sites\nwhere women can go with their children without fear of\nlosing them. In addition, disciplinary actions are tied to\nthe program. Since the program has the full backing of the\ncourt, noncompliance with the program bears legal conse-\nquences. The first or second time a patient is noncompli-\nant (\"dirty test\", no-show, or failure to comply with\ntreatment program activity), the client/offender may get a\nwarning, but further noncompliance can, and will, war-\nrant expulsion from the program and a prison term or\nThe Jackson County, Missouri, family drug court targets\nmothers who have given birth to drug-exposed infants\nand blends both civil and criminal cases [209]. The advan-\ntage of the blended court is that it avoids the problem of\nthe client needing to be in two different courtrooms where\ncourt issues may conflict and not provide a unified\napproach for the family. In the civil family/dependency\nsetting, the court is able to obtain jurisdiction over the\nchildren, allowing the court to order necessary services for\nthe children. However, because the court does not have\njurisdiction over the parent, the court has the carrot of cus-\ntody of the children but not the authority to force the par-\nent to comply with the requirements of the court. The\ncourt gains jurisdiction over the parent through the crim-\ninal charge. Here the court has jurisdiction over the\ndefendant but not the family, thus, family members do\nnot have to comply.\nThe program is immediate and intensive and includes\nsubstance abuse assessment and development of a treat-\nment plan including additional specialized services.\nMothers are seen on a weekly basis to ensure treatment\ncompliance and to insure that the needs of the child are\nbeing met. Both sanctions and incentives are used. Sanc-\ntions can be written assignments; more frequent court\nappearances and urine screens, chastisement in court and\ncommunity services, as well as the ultimate sanction of\nchild removal. Incentives include reduced court appear-\nance, praise from the bench, certificates, movie passes,\nand grocery vouchers. If the mother successfully com-\npletes the family drug court program the criminal case is\ntreated in a diversionary manner and is dismissed.\nThe Family Treatment Court in Suffolk County, New York\nprovides comprehensive and integrated case management\nservices and intensive case supervision to address the mul-\ntifaceted needs of chemically dependent parents and their\nchildren. The program emphasizes immediate assessment\nand early intervention and integrates chemical depend-\nency and child welfare services for the entire family\nsystem.\nThe Vulnerable Infants Program of Rhode Island (VIP-RI)\n[210] is based on research suggesting that drug-exposed\ninfants are vulnerable, not damaged, and that many of\nthese infants can recover and develop normally given an\nappropriate environment. VIP works with CPS and the\ncourt to comply with ASFA and provide a program of\ncoordinated care for drug-exposed infants and their fami-\nlies. VIP conducts a comprehensive and standardized\nassessment of the mother (maternal substance depend-\nency, mental health, parenting and attachment, life skills,\nfamily support and resources) and of the infant (medical\nand neurobehavioral status) as soon as the baby is identi-\nfied as drug exposed in the hospital. The assessments are\nused to help CPS make recommendations to the court\nregarding placement of the infant with the biological\nmother or in foster care and to develop a treatment plan\nfor use by the court. A special Family Treatment Drug\nCourt for drug-exposed infants has been established for\nVIP clients based on the \"treatment with teeth\" concept.\nThe program allows mothers the opportunity to get the\nappropriate treatment to be reunited with their infants\nand to provide the kinds of ancillary services including\nHarm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nmental health, to make reunification effective and facili-\ntate the development of the mother infant attachment\nrelationship. In this voluntary program, the VIP treatment\nplan is court ordered and sanctions are used for noncom-\npliance, the ultimate sanction, of course being loss of cus-\ntody of the infant.\nPolicy issues and recommendations\nWhile it is widely acknowledged that there must be a soci-\netal response to the issue of maternal substance abuse,\nthere is much controversy on just what this response\nshould be. Much of this debate is linked to the complica-\ntions and dilemmas present in the different policy\nresponses that have arisen in attempts to address the issue.\nPrevention\nMost interventions to address the problem of maternal\nsubstance use during pregnancy have focused on prevent-\ning the problem in the first place. These include education\ncampaigns about the dangers of smoking and drinking\nduring pregnancy, legislation requiring warning labels on\ncigarettes and alcohol, education about the dangers of\nillicit drugs such as cocaine and efforts to reduces the use\nof illicit drugs through criminalization. Yet, despite these\nefforts, drug use by pregnant women continues to be a sig-\nnificant public health problem. Thus, policy\nrecommendations must go beyond attempts to prevent\ndrug use by pregnant women.\nPolicy approaches for MATID use include primary, sec-\nondary and tertiary prevention strategies. Because of the\ncomplex substance abuse, psychological, parenting,\nsocial, family and medical issues involved in maternal\ndrug use during pregnancy, it is easy to fathom that all\naspects of prevention will be required to combat this\nproblem. Different strategies for intervention can be used\nincluding treatment and research in addition to education\nand legislation. These are interrelated and interdepend-\nent, and inform and feedback on each other.\nPrimary prevention is aimed at preventing the initial\noccurrence of the problem \u00ad in this case, MATID abuse\nduring pregnancy or avoiding pregnancy while using sub-\nstances. This includes informing women of childbearing\nage about the dangers of prenatal drug exposure and edu-\ncation to abstain from drug use during pregnancy or to\navoid pregnancy if using drugs. Specifically, women of\nchildrearing age and pregnant women can be educated\nabout the potential danger to the fetus and child from\nexposure to drugs. Providing treatment for drug-using\nwomen of childbearing age could help eliminate drug use\nduring pregnancy. This could even be an incentive for\nwomen who want to have a baby to initiate treatment.\nIntervention to practice contraception is a way to prevent\npregnancy in drug-using women and would also help\nreduce the spread of STDs and HIV. Use of fetal ultra-\nsound to show the mother her fetus can increase attach-\nment and potentially result in cessation of dug use during\npregnancy.\nSecondary prevention aimed at minimizing a problem\nwhen a risk factor exists would identify pregnant drug-\nusing women and attempt to minimize their drug use\nthrough educational, treatment, research, and regulatory\ninterventions [30]. Relatively little attention has been paid\nto the early detection of substance use during pregnancy\ndrug-using women receive little or no prenatal care and it\nis known that fear of detection because of potential puni-\ntive actions against the women and the potential for\nremoval of the child drive pregnant drug using women\naway from the health care system. As a result many prena-\ntal substance exposure cases are not identified until birth.\nFor prevention to be effective, the health care system\nneeds to be perceived as friendly and supportive by drug-\nusing pregnant women, not as punitive. They can be\nattracted to take advantage of prenatal care if they think it\nwill help them and their child. Health care professionals\ncan be better trained to detect substance abuse during\npregnancy and to respond to comply with reporting\nrequirements and in arranging services for the patient.\nA harm reduction model might argue for low-level use of\nsome substances, or even that use of some substances is\ntolerable for the benefit of cessation of other substances.\nFor example, should pregnant women on methadone\nmaintenance or those who use cocaine in residential treat-\nment, or those who are in prison be allowed to smoke?\nShould they be allowed less than 10 cigarettes a day if that\nis the threshold for negative effects on the baby? Should\nthey be given psychotropic medication to treat the anxi-\nety/depression that accompanies abstinence even if these\ndrugs are contraindicated for pregnant women?\nTertiary prevention aims to minimize the adverse conse-\nquences of a problem, in this case the short term or long\nterm harm to the child caused by drug exposure. This\nincludes mental health, medical and social interventions,\ntreatment for the mother and family members as well as\ntreatment for the infant, and parenting and parent/child\nrelationship therapy.\nPrevention efforts should include education and treat-\nment and target all drugs (i.e., licit and illicit) that have\nabuse potential during pregnancy. In addition to the\ndrugs mentioned in this review (alcohol, tobacco and ille-\ngal drugs), abuse of prescription drugs should also be\nincluded. For example, there is an emerging literature on\nabuse of benzodiazapenes, OxyContin, during pregnancy.\nPrevention efforts should be organized to enhance protec-\nHarm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5\n(page number not for citation purposes)\ntive factors and to minimize risk factors. These efforts\nneed to be developmentally and culturally appropriate,\ncapitalize on the mother's motivation to change and\ndesire to keep or be reunited with her baby. They also\nshould deal with the complexity of these cases including\nmental health co-morbidities and should have a family\nand community focus.\nScientific uncertainty\nPolicies have been established in the context of uneven\nscientific knowledge about MATID use and developmen-\ntal outcome. The literature is uneven with respect to type\nof drug (more is known about alcohol than other drugs)\nand in terms of drug effects, there is uncertainty as to\nwhether or not illegal drugs have more deleterious effects\nthan legal drugs. Mostly we do not know the long-term\ndevelopmental effects of prenatal drug exposure per se.\nThat is, drug effects have not been \"isolated\" from other\neffects (environmental as well as genetic), drug effects\nhave not been studied in a developmental model that\nwould enable us to determine the risk associated with\ndrugs in the context of other risk factors, and polydrug\neffects have not been studied. It is remarkable that at a\ntime when we acknowledge that most women who use\ndrugs during pregnancy are polydrug users, studies have\nnot examined the effects of polydrug exposure on devel-\nopmental outcome. It is probably safe to say at this point\nthat scientific facts do not support the \"quick fix\" linear\napproach that focuses on the single risk factor of prenatal\ndrug exposure as the explanation for the outcomes of\nthese children.\nPublic awareness\nA related issue is that the public should be aware of the\nscientific advances in the last 20 years. These advances\ninclude understanding of addiction as a chronic, relapsing\nmedial/mental health problem, consequences of prenatal\ndrug exposure for child development, and effectiveness of\ntreatment. It does not appear as if this knowledge has\nreached (or been accepted by) the general public or has\nbeen applied in clinical programs or policy settings. This\nsituation is exacerbated by the stigma surrounding drug\nuse during pregnancy. Pregnant women are not extended\nthe compassion normally displayed by the public towards\nindividually suffering from chronic diseases. The view that\nsubstance abuse should not be treated as another mental\nhealth and medical illness is at odds with established\nscience.\nFetal rights\nThere have been several routes that the courts have taken\nin attempting to prosecute women for substance abuse\nduring pregnancy. The most basic routes of societal\nresponse include the following: (1) use of the penal code\nto regulate all behavior of pregnant women that places the\nfetus at risk of harm; (2) use of the penal code to regulate\nall illegal behavior (particularly the use of controlled sub-\nstances) that place the fetus at risk of harm; (3) use of fam-\nily law and the power of the state to ensure that the best\ninterests of the child are served, whether the behavior of\nthe parent is legal or illegal; and (4) the use of no addi-\ntional criminal or family law regulations specifically tar-\ngeted at fetal abuse, relying instead on current language\nThe filing of any charges against a substance-abusing\nmother hinges on the notion of fetal rights, namely that\nfetuses are human beings entitled to certain rights and\nprivileges [213]. Much of the debate around the issue of\nperinatal substance exposure has focused on this very\nidea. There are many questions as to whether fetuses are\nreally entitled to protection under the law, and if they are,\nwhat are the widespread social implications. Certainly the\nquestion of what rights the fetus is entitled to is intrinsi-\ncally tied to the argument of when life begins and when is\nit appropriate for society to regulate the current behavior\nof the mother in order to prevent potential future harm to\nSince the beginning of the fetal rights movement, propo-\nnents have maintained that the fetus is a human being\npossessing an existence separated from that of its mother\nand because of its existence, entitled to legal acknowledge-\nment. Among these fundamental rights is the right to be\nborn with a sound mind and body [156]. The court has\nfavored this point in several cases, ruling in favor of the\nfetus in such cases as In re Baby X [215], Grodin v. Grodin,\nMore recent effects of the fetal rights movement are evi-\ndent in legislation that states have tried to adapt in\nresponse to the wave of media attention directed towards\n\"crack\" babies. Most of the changes and adaptations in\nlegislation have been in existing criminal child neglect\nand abuse legislation, essentially widening the definitions\nof child to include the unborn. It is interesting to note\nhowever, that while states have successfully adapted exist-\ning laws to include fetuses and have even successfully\nated legislation that specifically penalizes pregnant drug\nusers with additional punishment for the effect that their\ndrug use and abuse has on their unborn child. One factor\nthat this is attributed to is the difficulty in definitively\nestablishing a correlation between the mother's drug use\nand harm to the child.\nThere is certainly a flip side to the fetal rights movement.\nIn fact, strong opposition has been raised to the idea that\nthe fetus is a human with its own existence separate from\nthat of its mother. Opponents fear the \"slippery slope\"\nHarm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5\n(page number not for citation purposes)\neffect that may occur if the rights of the fetus are acknowl-\npurports that acknowledging the rights of the fetus in any\ncircumstance potentially has the adverse effect of making\nthe rights of the fetus take precedence over the rights of\nthe mother in all circumstances. It poses the question: if\nwe allow the regulation of one sphere of pregnancy, where\ndo we stop [162]? This would have serious implications\nfor other issues surrounding the rights of the fetus versus\nthe rights of the mother, including abortion.\nFetal/maternal conflicts\nIt is important to acknowledge at the outset that policies\nfor the pregnant woman/mother may be in conflict with\npolicies for the fetus/infant. For example, high doses of\nmethadone used for heroin-addicted pregnant women\ncan produce withdrawal in the infant. Lower doses that\nwould not produce withdrawal in the infant increase the\nrisk that the methadone will be less effective and the preg-\nnant woman return to street drugs. As another example,\nboth managed care and welfare reform have resulted in\nsanctions that reduce services to drug using mothers, such\nas when drug users are not eligible for benefits [135]. The\nirony is that such policies are based on concern for the\nchild ant not only create a rift between advocates for\nwomen and advocates for children, but also mean that\nmother and child face poverty without public assistance\nor the child enters the foster care system.\nPerinatal drug screening\nOne of the major issues that arise in trying to isolate a\nresponse to maternal drug use is related to screening for\ndrug use in women and for exposure in newborns. It is dif-\nficult to determine who should be tested. Often times this\nquestion is answered in a way that exhibits different biases\npresent in society. Targeted testing, which leaves testing\nup to the discretion of the hospital and physicians, intro-\nduces the possibility of significant bias in decision-mak-\ning. Tremendous inconsistency is inevitable with targeted\ntesting because it is highly plausible that identification\ncan more be a function of area of residence, hospital pol-\nicy, and physician prerogative [218]. One argument for\nuniversal testing of newborns is that it is the only way to\nemploy testing devoid of social biases. A second argument\nis that universal testing also ensures that exposed infants\nwho are detected will be able to receive all available serv-\nHowever, universal testing of infants places hospitals in a\nprecarious position. Traditionally hospitals provide serv-\nices to patients in a confidential and nonjudgmental way.\nBut if a newborn exhibits a positive toxicology screen and\nthe state has a mandatory reporting law, the hospital has\na responsibility to report that fact to the necessary author-\nities in order to ensure the protection of the welfare of the\nchild. In cases such as this there is a conflict between the\nhospital's responsibility to protect the confidentiality of\nthe mother and responsibility to protect the welfare of the\nAnother problem is that hospitals typically only screen for\nillegal drugs. There is no newborn screen for alcohol, yet\nthe effects of prenatal alcohol exposure are at least as\nsevere as the effects of illegal drugs. Some have argued that\nthe effects of nicotine are comparable if not worse than\nthe effects of cocaine. Yet even though there are nicotine\nassays for urine and meconium they are not used to iden-\ntify exposed infants. And what would we do with this\ninformation? Would we really report up to 25% of new\nmothers to an already overburdened child welfare and\ncriminal justice system because nicotine and cocaine have\nsimilar effects on the baby?\nAnother option for screening is to not test at all and sim-\nply rely on the self-report of the mother. The benefit of\nthis option is that it greatly reduces the possibility of vio-\nlating the civil liberties of the mother, treatment avoid-\nance by the mother, and biased use of child welfare/\ncriminal involvement. It would also allow healthcare\nworkers to simply treat the mothers without being in an\ninvestigative role. By allowing healthcare workers to sim-\nply treat them, the mothers may feel more comfortable in\nadmitting their drug use and more willing to accept treat-\nment. However there is also the risk that mothers will not\ndisclose their drug use. Lack of disclosure by the mother\nwould render physicians unable to identify high-risk\ninfants and thus unable to prevent negative\nFinally, it might be possible to develop very specific crite-\nria for drug testing based on specific medical indicators\nand that avoids use of such open-ended criteria as \"clini-\ncal suspicion\" that invite discriminatory testing. This solu-\ntion would work with two caveats. First, all drugs would\nbe included (legal and illegal and prescription medication\nthat can also be abused such as benzodiazipines or perco-\ndan, OxyContin) Second, the mother would not be auto-\nmatically reported to CPS. Rather, the point of drug\ntesting would be to provide hospital staff with the oppor-\ntunity for intervention and the possibility of an additional\nstandardized assessment if there is concern for the welfare\nof the child. Only if such an assessment suggested indi-\ncated inadequate parenting would the mother be reported\nto CPS.\nWho gets prosecuted\nAnother problem associated with criminalization is that\nof prejudicial reporting practices. Many fear that racial dis-\ncrepancies in prosecutions are related to racial prejudices\namong people who report maternal substance abuse and\nHarm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nthe criminal justice system as a whole. The overwhelming\nperinatal substance abuse have been illegal drug users;\nmost notably and most often crack cocaine users [221].\nStudies have shown that more minority women are crack\ncocaine users than other demographic groups. Thus\nwomen of color are most likely to be prosecuted for peri-\nnatal substance abuse. This has led to the concern that\ncriminalizing of perinatal substance abuse is in fact a\nprocess that is discriminatory against poor women of\nBeyond the fact that more crack users are prosecuted than\npregnant drug users, there is a class component regarding\nwho is prosecuted for drug use. The government prose-\ncutes more impoverished women than those in the\nmiddle class [218]. This is because middle class women\nare more apt to use the services of private physicians. Pri-\nvate physicians who treat middle class and wealthy\nwomen are less likely to question their patients' behavior\nbased on an unsubstantiated belief that wealthier women\nare less likely to use or abuse substances. By contrast, phy-\nsicians are more likely to question poor minority women\nabout their substance abuse and ultimately report their\nA 1990 Florida study produced statistics supporting the\nnotion that there is a race and class bias in reporting. The\nstudy revealed that while there was very little difference in\nabuse rates between black and white women, rates of\nreporting are drastically different. According to the study,\nphysicians are ten times more likely to report a black\nwoman than a white woman. The most frequently\nreported subjects were low-income women who relied on\npublic health care [222]. In a similar study, poor minority\nwomen were the subjects of 81% of government sought\ncourt-ordered interventions [33].\nAnother illustration of this point is found in a 1990 Amer-\nican Civil Liberties Union report.

At the heart of contro-\nversy are several Fourteenth Amendment entitlements,\nincluding due process, liberty, and equal protection. The\nFourteenth Amendment states, \"...nor shall any State\ndeprive any person of... liberty...without due process of\nlaw; nor deny any person within its jurisdiction the equal\nprotection of the laws.\"\nThis statement of due process under the law creates a situ-\nation in which the state must have a clearly defined objec-\ntive when intervening in the lives of citizens. This\nobjective must be tied to public health, safety, or welfare.\nThis is certainly not where the due process clause stops. In\nfact it goes on to assert that whatever the planned inter-\nvention the state chooses to implement must be related to\nachieving the aforementioned objective. There also must\nbe a relative degree of certainty that the intervention will\nbe effective in accomplishing the intended goal. If the fun-\ndamental rights of an individual will be infringed upon\ndue to the intervention, then the State must demonstrate\nthat the intervention is reasonable, narrowly constructed,\nand that there is no less intrusive way of accomplishing\nBased upon the criteria laid out by the due process clause\nof the Fourteenth Amendment, there have been several\nissues raised in relation to state intervention in the lives of\ndrug-using mothers. Firstly, there is the issue of criminal\nprosecution itself. Is criminal prosecution really an effec-\ntive intervention in deterring pregnant women from using\ndrugs? There is much controversy over whether criminali-\nzation of the act really is an effective deterrent.\nThere is also the issue of physician disclosure of positive\ntoxicology results to the authorities. The public disclosure\nof these results coupled with the use of the women's med-\nical records are often used against the women in prosecu-\ntorial settings. This could be a violation of the women's\nright to privacy and freedom of association. Along the\nsame lines it is often argued that by requiring physicians\nto report positive toxicology results the medical provider\nis forced into a situation where they are law enforcers and\nthus must obtain informed consent from their patients\nbefore performing any tests that may result in criminal\nment officials having to obtain a warrant before search\nand seizure. Often, drug screens are performed on the\nmothers without their knowledge or consent. This raises\nstrong questions about violation of the mother's rights as\nHarm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nrelated to their Fourth Amendment protection against ille-\ngal search and seizure.\nPolicing pregnancy: Ferguson v. Charleston\nWith the case of Ferguson v. Charleston, the Supreme\nCourt has entered into the legal arena surrounding mater-\nnal substance abuse. The case of Ferguson v. Charleston\ndeals with the practices of a Charleston, S.C. public hospi-\ntal regarding the testing and reporting of women for sub-\nstance abuse when they come to deliver their babies. In\nthe fall of 1988, staff members at the Charleston public\nhospital operated by the Medical University of South\nCarolina became concerned with the increasing numbers\nof patients coming in for prenatal care who were also\nusing cocaine. To combat these numbers, in April of 1989\nthe hospital adopted a policy of referring cocaine-using\nmaternity patients to both counseling and treatment pro-\ngrams. Referrals would be made based upon drug screens\nperformed on urine samples from maternity patients who\nDespite the efforts of MUSC staff, the number of cocaine-\nusing maternity patients remained constant. The hospital\nthen decided to offer its support and cooperation to the\ncity in prosecuting mothers whose children tested positive\nfor drugs at the time of birth. The women could undergo\ndrug treatment to avoid prosecution. Babies would be\ntested only if their mothers were suspected of drug use.\nSuspicion was based on the following criteria: no prenatal\ncare, late prenatal care after 24 weeks gestation, incom-\nplete prenatal care, abruptio placentae, intrauterine fetal\ndeath, preterm labor \"of no obvious cause,\" intrauterine\ngrowth retardation \"of no obvious cause,\" previously\nknown drug or alcohol abuse\" or unexplained congenital\nanomalies.\nThe plaintiffs were ten women, including nine women of\ncolor, who were arrested directly based on the hospital's\npolicy. Four of the women were immediately arrested,\nwhile six were offered the option of drug treatment, but\neither failed to comply or failed a second drug screen. The\nwomen challenged the practice on the theory that war-\nrantless and nonconsensual drug tests conducted for crim-\ninal investigatory purposes were unconstitutional\nsearches [223]. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the\nwomen, saying that the women's Fourth Amendment\nRights had indeed been violated. Because MUSC is a state\nhospital, its staff members are government actors subject\nto the Fourth Amendment's strictures. They found that a\nstate's performance of a diagnostic test to obtain evidence\nof a patient's criminal conduct for law enforcement pur-\nposes is an unreasonable search if the patient has not con-\nsented to the procedure. The interest in using the threat of\ncriminal sanctions to deter pregnant women from using\ncocaine cannot justify a departure from the general rule\nthat an official nonconsensual search is unconstitutional\nwill change the relationship between hospitals and law\nenforcement with respect to reporting of evidence of ille-\ngal drug use during pregnancy.\nBacklash against criminalization\nThere are other reasons beyond the constitutionality of\nprosecuting perinatal substance abusers that have come\ninto play in the backlash against criminalization. Many\nprofessional health care and child welfare organizations\nhave banded together against criminalization on the basis\nthat it is antithetical to the best interests of both the\nmother and the child. They also argue that it puts health-\ncare providers in the inappropriate and uncomfortable\nposition of having to police their patients. Reasons for the\nrejection of criminalization include that criminalization\nhas no proven effect on improving infant health or deter-\nring substance abuse by pregnant women. In fact, crimi-\nnalization may in fact deter the pregnant woman from\nseeking out necessary prenatal care for fear of losing their\nchildren or being arrested.\nCriminalization of perinatal substance abuse creates\nuntenable legal and ethical obligations for health care\nproviders and other statutory mandatory reporters. It\nstretches the limits of what it means to be a caregiver.\nFinally, criminalization has been shown to be discrimina-\ntory based on race and socioeconomic status [220].\nImpact of welfare reform\nThe passage of the Personal Responsibility Work Oppor-\ntunity and Reconciliation Act (PRWORA), or welfare\nreform act in 1996, affects availability of resources, living\nconditions and medical services to drug using mothers.\nThe act sought to reduce the number of children growing\nup in poor single parent families by promoting marriage\nand requiring mothers to move from welfare to work. The\nlegislation is probably best known for having repealed the\nAid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) pro-\ngram and for providing states with TANF (Temporary\nAssistance for Needy Families) block grants to design\nwork focused, time limited welfare programs. However,\nthe 1996 law was more extensive as it made major\nchanges affecting a wide range of programs that provide\nservices to low income children, including child support\nenforcement, child care, Medicaid, food stamps, child\nwelfare and disability benefits. The law restricted services\nto immigrants and reduced federal protections for indi-\nviduals while expanding state discretion and flexibility in\nimplementing social policy. The law also generated new\nrounds of discussion about out-of-wedlock births, fathers,\nand marriage and family formation.\nHarm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nUnder AFDC, states were mandated to provide assistance\nto all eligible poor families, but had broad discretion in\nsetting benefit levels. The federal government paid half or\nmore of all program costs based on caseload levels. States\nwere required to provide work-related services and\nrequirements for AFDC families but these programs were\noften not well funded and reached a limited number of\neligible families. Under TANF, each state receives a block\ngrant and has broad discretion in using the funds for pro-\ngrams that provide case assistance for needy families, as\nwell as for other benefits and services that accomplish the\nfour purposes of the law:\n\u00b7 Provide assistance to needy families so that children can\nbe cared for in their own homes or in the homes of\nrelatives;\n\u00b7 End needy parents' dependence on government benefits\nby promoting job preparation, work, and marriage;\n\u00b7 Prevent and reduce the incidence of out of wedlock preg-\nnancies; and\n\u00b7 Encourage the formation and maintenance of two-par-\nent families.\nTANF enabled states to tie assistance to specified maternal\nbehaviors and includes drug-related prohibitions\nincluding ineligibility for drug felons. Thirty-five states\nhave elected to deny options to drug felons and at least 10\nstates require drug testing for TANF applicants [226].\nOther provisions of these new rules will also affect drug-\nusing mothers. Estimates are that 15\u00ad20% of the TANF\npopulation has drug problems that limit their ability to\n[229], but drug treatment and related services are inade-\nquate. Moreover, if mothers are ineligible for benefits due\nto sanctions, the funds available for treatment programs\nwill be reduced because many treatment programs\ndepend on block grants, Medicaid reimbursement, and\npublic assistance benefits.\nTANF could also be detrimental because of the historical\nconnection between AFDC and the child welfare system.\nFamilies in the two systems face substance abuse and\nrelated mental health problems, domestic violence, and\npoverty, and both programs support many children who\nare being cared for by grandparents and other relatives\ntime limit requirements under TANF, as well as the dis-\nposable income some families may experience as they\nmove from welfare to work could lead to increased drug\nuse and involvement of child welfare. Two studies looking\nat AFDC caseloads found that sanctions and work com-\nbined in ways associated with more CPSA involvement\n[234], neglect and out of home care increased when cash\nassistance benefit levels decreased. In addition, rates of\nneglect increased as the number of single working moth-\ners increased. Families that participated in Delaware's\nAFDC waiver program (similar to TANF requirements)\nhad higher rates of child neglect than those in the control\ngroup [235]. Child welfare agencies in 12 states reported\nthat lack of child care supervision had increased under\nTANF as had the number of families surrendering their\nchildren to child welfare agencies or delaying reunifica-\ntion of children already in care [236].\nTANF can affect the amount of money spent on child wel-\nfare services such as substance abuse treatment, mental\nhealth, parenting education, and supports available for\nchildren in kinship care (grandparents or relatives) [237].\nFinally, there is the related concern that TANF legislation\ncould impact poor children with disabilities receiving\nsupplemental social security income. The criteria used by\nthe Social Security Administration for determining\n\"marked and severe functional limitations\" in children\nwould rule out many drug-exposed children from obtain-\ning much needed services.\nPolicy recommendations\nIt would be easy to look at the shortcomings of the current\npolicies surrounding issues of maternal substance abuse\nand lose hope at the prospects for improvement for the\nfuture. However, strides in the right direction are being\nmade. The pendulum has swung back in the direction of\nproviding treatment to pregnant drug users in an attempt\nto both address their addiction and preserve their fami-\nlies. There is certainly progress to be made in achieving\npolicies and practices that effectively address all the issues\nthat these women and their children face. We have\ndivided policy recommendations into the following cate-\ngories: (i) Education, (ii) Legal, (iii) Assessment, (iv)\nFinancial, (v) Training, (vi) Treatment and (vii) Research.\nEducation\nEducate the public about the social and political issues surrounding\nthe stigma of drug abuse in general and specifically with respect to\ndug use by pregnant women\nThis includes acceptance about drug use as a mental\nhealth/medical problem, that drug use does not automat-\nically rule out adequate parenting, how development\nunfolds in drug exposed children, the effectiveness of\ntreatment including court involvement, barriers to treat-\nment, and that barriers to treatment and punishment of\nthe mother may not be in the best interests of the child. In\naddition to the \"general' public, this education should\nalso target state and federal legislators, state agencies, CPS,\nHarm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nchild welfare workers, court, drug and alcohol treatment\nprograms.\nEducate the public about the dangers of prenatal drug exposure\nAlthough pregnant women and women of childbearing\nage should be high priority, it is also important to educate\npreadolescent girls and boys, and men as well as women.\nPartners can have a substantial influence on each other's\ndrug use. Having partners and friends with anti-drug use\nattitudes can help prevent drug use during pregnancy. This\neducation should make it clear that 1) although not all\ndrug exposed children will be affected, some will and they\nwill be affected from birth; others might look normal at\nbirth and not show problems until years later, 2) all drugs\nof abuse (legal as well as illegal and prescription medica-\ntion such as benzodiazapenes and OxyContin, percodan)\ncan affect the child, 3) prenatal care and connection to the\nhealthcare system is important for the health of the baby\nand can lead to treatment if drugs are involved, 5) good\nparenting can help these babies but it is hard to be a good\nparent when you are using drugs, 6) mental health\nproblems are often co-morbid with drug dependency and\nwill also affect child outcome.\nEducate health care providers\nThis includes education to 1) detect drug use during preg-\nnancy, 2) understand that non-supportive, punitive\nattitudes drive pregnant women away from the health care\nsystem depriving them of prenatal care and opportunity\nfor help, 3) learn about the unique issues and needs of\nthese women, and 4) learn what resources are available in\nthe community to make appropriate referrals and connect\nthese women to services.\nEducate that policies must be developed that are fair to both mother\nand child\nTreatment providers and policy makers should not have\nto \"choose\" between the welfare of the mother and the\nwelfare of the child.\nDisseminate educational materials\nEducation includes dissemination. Educational materials\nshould be prepared so that they are understandable,\nmeaningful and user friendly for the targeted audience.\nThis will require the preparation of different materials for\ndifferent audiences including different media (e.g.,\nprinted, audio, video, in-person testimony, Internet, con-\nferences, \"town meetings,\"). Dissemination should be\ngeared at reaching the public using the media (newspa-\npers, etc), and lawmakers.\nLegal\nDevelop federal laws and guidelines for dealing with the detection of\ndrug use during pregnancy, placement of drug-exposed infants and\nthe treatment of drug using mothers and their infants\nThe purpose of these laws would be to provide a set of\nuniform policies for the nation based on current \"state of\nthe art\" knowledge described above under \"Education.\"\nThese Federal policies would include:\nDrug testing should be targeted and only be based on spe-\ncific medical criteria and not include ambiguous criteria\n(such as \"clinical suspicion\") that invite discriminatory\ntesting of minority and underprivileged patients.\nAn infant should be considered drug-exposed and in need\nof some level of intervention if the mother states she has\nused illegal drugs during pregnancy or if drug exposure is\nshown through toxicology tests of the infant.\nWhen an infant is identified as drug-exposed, the infant\nand his/her family should be assessed by hospital health\nproviders (with assistance when necessary from develop-\nmental, drug treatment, and other specialists) using a\nstandardized assessment battery to determine what inter-\nvention, if any, is needed. An identified drug-exposed\ninfant should be reported to child protective services only\nif factors in addition to prenatal drug exposure show that\nthe infant is at risk for abuse or neglect. Drug use alone is\nnot sufficient to report to CPS. It is a risk factor. Reporting\nto CPS is only required when the standardized assessment\nbattery indicates evidence of inadequate parenting that\nplaces the child at risk for abuse/neglect in addition to\ndrug use.\nA drug-exposed infant should be removed from the cus-\ntody if his/her parent (s) only if the parent (s) are unable\nto protect and care for the infant and either support serv-\nices are not sufficient to manage this risk, or the parent (s)\nhave refused such services. If the parent (s) are not capable\nof resuming custody of the infant within 12\u00ad18 months,\ndespite receiving services to make reunification possible, a\npermanent alternative placement should be promptly\nprovided for the infant.\nFamily drug courts for drug-exposed infants should be\nestablished with the goals of keeping infants with their\nbiological mothers if there is no documented risk of\nabuse/neglect, providing court ordered treatment and\nplans for reunification or alternative permanency plan-\nning to comply with ASFA.\nThe availability of resources, living conditions, benefits\nand medical services to drug using mothers and their\ninfants including benefits (e.g. TANF) should not be\nHarm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5\n(page number not for citation purposes)\ndenied to drug-using women who comply with their\ncourt-ordered treatment program.\nA woman who uses illegal drugs during pregnancy should\nnot be subject to special criminal prosecution on the basis\nof allegations that her illegal drug use harms the fetus. Nor\nshould states adopt special civil commitment provisions\nfor pregnant women who use drugs.\nBarriers to child protective services' capacity to meet the\nrequirements of current child welfare laws should be iden-\ntified and removed. These barriers include high caseloads,\nlack of drug treatment and support services for the family,\nbacklogs in the court, and inadequate numbers of foster\nor adoptive homes.\nAssessment\nDevelop universal guidelines for comprehensive risk assessment\nA standardized assessment battery that includes maternal\nsubstance dependency, mental health, parenting, family\nresources and support, life skills, home environment, and\ninfant neuro-behavior and medical status should be\nadministered. The battery includes standardized scoring\nwith specific criteria for additional evidence of abuse/\nneglect that requires reporting to CPS. The battery also\nincludes guidelines for placement recommendations and\ndeveloping treatment plans based on the assessment. If\nthe mother is identified prenatally, much of the battery\ncan be administered before delivery. If the mother is iden-\ntified at birth, the battery should be administered before\nthe infant is discharged with follow-up assessments at\nselected intervals determined by the court. The battery\nshould be administered by trained, certified staff that can\ninterface with hospital, CPS, and court staff and with treat-\nment providers.\nFinancial\nSpend early, spend often, spend more: Specifically, increase funding\nfor prevention and intervention programs during the prenatal and\ninfancy periods\nFunding should be available for programs that are fre-\nquent and comprehensive dealing with mental health and\nfamily issues as well as drug dependency. The portion of\nthe National Drug Control Budget for treatment, preven-\ntion and research should be doubled. The proportion of\nthe NIH research budget for substance abuse research\nincluding policy research and research on developmental\nconsequences of prenatal MATID exposure, treatment,\nprevention and health services should be increased. Spe-\ncific funds should be allocated for \"out of the box\"\nresearch in areas that cross traditional disciplinary lines\nand therefore, NIH institutes. For example, joint NIMH\nand NIDA funds should address mental health and sub-\nstance abuse issues. NIAAA and NIDA should collaborate\non research involving alcohol and illegal drug use. Policy\nresearch cutting across all institutes should also be\nfunded.\nDevelop cost effective services\nTreating substance abuse as an isolated problem is\ndoomed to fail. Wraparound mental health and family\nsupport services need to be provided for these families.\nDevelop reimbursements strategies so that mental health,\nparenting and family support services can be bundled in\nwith substance abuse treatment. These should be viewed\nas packages rather than as compartmentalized separate\nservices. Establish one carve-out for the maternal sub-\nstance abuse, mental health and family assessment and\ntreatment services, a second carve-out for all of the child\nassessment and treatment services and a third carve-out\nfor case management. The same service provider or pro-\nvider group should provide these services at a single loca-\ntion (one-stop shopping). Medicaid coverage should be\nexpanded to include these services.\nGuarantee that drug using mothers in treatment keep their\ninsurance\nThis includes medical benefits and TANF.\nUnderstand that economic issues need to be understood and\nfactored into policy decisions but they should be viewed only as one\nof many factors, never the sole factor\nView economic issues in the context of moral values and\nvalue systems to relieve suffering and provide needed care.\nUnderstand that there is no cheap fix but that prevention\nand treatment are cost effective when compared with the\ntoll that drugs take on society.\nTraining\nDevelop training programs and train hospital personnel in the\nadministration, scoring and interpretation of the assessment battery\nTrain CPS staff, the court, treatment and service providers\nand third party reimburses in how to understand the\nassessment battery, and provide cross-training so that all\nparties involved appreciate each other's areas of expertise.\nTrain foster/adoptive parents and treatment providers in\nbest practices for drug-exposed infants. Develop training\nprograms and train professionals to provide multiple\n(bundled) services. Train one set of professionals in\nmaternal issues (assessment and treatment of substance\nabuse, mental health disorders, and family systems,\nparenting, child development and women's issues) and\nsecond group in infant and child assessment and treat-\nment and a third in case management. Provide multidis-\nciplinary substance abuse clinical training of health\nprofessionals as part of academic programs, postgraduate\nprograms, and specialty licensing programs.\nHarm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nTreatment\nImprove access to treatment\nDrug treatment programs should be available for all drug-\nabusing pregnant women and parents of infants as well as\nwomen of childbearing age, and these programs should\nbe comprehensive and responsive to other related needs\nof these families, including mental health, health, devel-\nopmental, parenting education and other support serv-\nices. Treatment programs should include thorough\nassessment of the infants that includes an evaluation of\ndevelopmental areas such as motor, cognition, language,\nself help skills, coping skills, and emotional well being,\nand should be conducted at regular intervals including\nafter placement in foster care for infants not with their\nbiological mothers. Treatment programs should be fam-\nily-based and include partners as well as other siblings.\nDevelop coordinated multidisciplinary treatment programs with\ninterconnected services based on the needs mothers and children\nInclude expectations for relapse as part of treatment mod-\nels and mechanisms to help reduce relapse such as pro-\ngrams for transition back to the community, halfway\nhouses and step-down facilities. Extended follow-up\nshould be seen as an integral part of treatment. Recognize\nthat maltreatment includes both abuse and neglect, that\nmore is known about abuse than neglect, abuse is more\nvisible, easier to diagnose and less subtle than neglect.\nDevelop different strategies and interventions for abuse\nand neglect based on the different family dynamics\ninvolved. Establish connections to state programs such as\nearly intervention programs, early head start, head start\nand follow through to preschool services.\nDevelop preventive intervention efforts\nThese efforts should start as early as possible (during preg-\nnancy, if and when possible). All drug-exposed infants\nshould automatically qualify for early intervention serv-\nices. Prevention efforts should enhance protective factors\nand minimize risk factors, be developmentally appropri-\nate and culturally sensitive, but at the same time should\nnot stereotype families. They should capitalize on the\nmother's motivation to change and desire to keep or be\nreunited with her baby while also working within her\nreadiness to change; that deal with the complexity of these\ncases including mental health co-morbidities; and should\nhave a family and community focus.\nResearch\nBasic research should study (a) the prevalence of MATID use among\npregnant women (not solely based on self-report), (b) the relationship\nbetween such use and birth and developmental outcomes, and (c)\nthe effectiveness of drug treatment and intervention programs\nSpecial focus should be given to evaluating drug treatment\nprograms for pregnant women and parents with infants\nfor their effectiveness in enabling participants to function\nas adequate caretakers of their children. Research should\naddress the demographics of perinatal drug users (geogra-\nphy, social and minority status), level of use (hard core\naddicts versus recreational users), and drug and drug com-\nbinations (polydrug use). The consequences of prenatal\nMAITD exposure should be studied with reference to\ndevelopmental models, long term effects, specific as well\nas polydrug effects, comparison of legal and illegal drugs,\neffect size and clinical significance, the role of confound-\ning variables and drugs as a risk factor. Research also\nneeds to determine the role of protective and resiliency\nfactors and to understand factors that buffer the child\nagainst the adverse consequences of prenatal drug\nexposure.\nResearch needs to be conducted in which treatment pro-\ngrams are monitored by independent evaluators, which\nuse clinical trials methodology and determine cost effec-\ntiveness. This includes research on the effectiveness of\ndrug courts. Finally research needs to determine which\ninterventions are most effective for specific groups of the\nmaternal drug using population.\nPolicy research should have a specific focus on issues related to\nmothers (MATID) and their infants.\n\u00b7 Research needs to address how policies for mothers and\ninfants are affected by:\n\u00b7 Findings that suggest subtle and comparable effects due\nto MATID including similar effects for legal and illegal\ndrugs;\n\u00b7 Criminal/punitive versus mental health/disease views of\naddiction;\n\u00b7 Conflicts between programs that address fetal issues and\nprograms that address maternal issues;\nPolicy research also needs to address the:\n\u00b7 Effects of ASFA including long-term effects of on relapse\nafter reunification\n\u00b7 Effects of treatment drug courts on permanency place-\nment, compliance with ASFA, foster care, substance partic-\nipation in substance abuse treatment, relapse, and child\noutcome;\n\u00b7 Effects of welfare reform on participation in treatment\ncourts and participation in substance abuse treatment;\n\u00b7 Effects of hospital drug testing (universal, selective, and\nnone) on mothers' use of the health care system (e.g., pre-\nnatal care), and participation in treatment programs;\nHarm Reduction Journal 2004, 1 http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/1/1/5\n(page number not for citation purposes)\n\u00b7 Effects of prenatal enrollment in drug treatment pro-\ngrams on placement of the infant, CPS and court involve-\nment and ASFA;\n\u00b7 Effects of insurance and treatment programs that bundle\nsubstance use and mental health treatment on treatment\noutcome permanency placement and child outcome;\n\u00b7 Cost effectiveness of new approaches such as prenatal\nenrollment, treatment courts, maintenance of health\nbenefits and TANF for mothers involved with CPS and\nbundling of substance abuse and mental health services;\n\u00b7 Effects of types of substance abuse state statutes (includ-\ning different statues for different types of substances) on\nfactors such as MATID, treatment outcome, child removal\nfoster care and permanency placement, and CPS involve-\nment, long-term outcome of mother and child.\nConclusions\nThe issue of MATID use during pregnancy sits squarely at\nthe intersection of behavioral teratology, jurisprudence,\nmental health, medicine, child protection, chemical\ndependency, civil rights, and women's issues perhaps in a\nway that no other controversy has. We learned a hard\nlesson from the cocaine controversy and saw the pendu-\nlum swing from an overestimation of risk associated with\nprenatal cocaine exposure to a more balanced view. That\nview includes the notion that, from a public health per-\nspective, even subtle effects have significant societal\nimpact and cost. The task at hand is to make sure that we\nview all drugs of abuse through a common lens, regardless\nof legal status, social or political considerations, so that\ntheir impact on child outcome can be adequately assessed\nleading to appropriate policy making.\nThere is a substantial disconnect between our knowledge,\npolicy and practice regarding maternal drug use during\npregnancy. For example, the drug control budget has\nmore than doubled in the past decade. Yet the proportion\nof the budget devoted to treatment and prevention is\nunchanged, despite the gains made in science, and in our\nunderstanding of the nature of addiction in research\nshowing that treatment and prevention are effective.\nArguably, the major barrier facing changes in policies for\ndrug-using mothers is societal attitude. We have Supreme\nCourt rulings that define drug use as a mental problem,\nwe have modern evidence that treatment is effective and\nthat there is no reason to consider drug use as different\nthan any other mental/medical problem; there are treat-\nment programs shown to be effective with drug-using\nmothers; and there are treatments with the programs\ninvolving the courts. We have identified all other barriers,\nyet why has policy not changed? Is it because we are still\nangry and want to punish these mothers? That we will not\nforgive them for using drugs when they are pregnant? The\ngreat tragedy is that we are only harming the children. We\nharm them by denying service, by increasing the number\nof children in out of home placement, by undermining\nthe ability of the children to form attachment relation-\nships, and by labeling these children as damaged. We\nknow the danger of self-fulfilling prophecies. If we expect\nthese children to fail, they will fail. It is time to realize that\ngetting angry and punishing the mother is not in the best\ninterests of either the mother or the child. It is time that\nwe develop a national consensus on how to deal with\nmaternal prenatal drug use that does justice to the state-\nof-the-art knowledge in research and treatment and dem-\nonstrates a fair and unbiased attitude towards these\nwomen and their children.\nCompeting interests\nNone declared.\nAdditional material\n"
