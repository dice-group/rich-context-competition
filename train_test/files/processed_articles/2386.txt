Despite the health concerns raised about these beverages,\nwhich are often highly caffeinated, surprisingly little data are available to estimate\nthe prevalence of their use. This review presents the results of secondary data\nanalyses of a nationally representative data set of schoolchildren in the United\nStates and reviews the available research on the association between energy drink\nuse and risk-taking behaviors. Approximately one-third of the students surveyed\nwere recent users of energy drinks, with substantial variation by age, sex, and race/\nethnicity. Among the health and safety concerns related to energy drinks and their\nconsumption is the possible potentiation of risk-taking behaviors. The review of\navailable research reveals that, although there does appear to be a strong and\nconsistent positive association between the use of energy drinks and risk-taking\nbehavior, all but one of the available studies used cross-sectional designs, thereby\nlimiting the ability to make inferences about the temporal nature of the association.\nThus, more research is needed to understand the nature of this association and how\nenergy drinks, particularly those containing caffeine, might impact adolescent\nhealth and safety, especially given the high prevalence of their use among youth.\n\u00a9 2014 International Life Sciences Institute\nINTRODUCTION\nAlthough no formal definition has been proposed, bever-\nages labeled and marketed as energy drinks comprise a\nheterogeneous beverage category, with most of these\ndrinks containing caffeine and a variety of other ingredi-\nents,including guarana,taurine,and B vitamins.1,2 Several\ntypes of energy drinks are additionally carbonated and\ncontain sugar,3,4 although sugar-free variations are avail-\nable.5 Public health concerns have been raised, primarily\nbecause of the high levels of caffeine these beverages typi-\ncally contain, both in amount and in concentration. The\namount of caffeine varies considerably, ranging from 50\nto 500 mg per container,6 with some containers contain-\ning more than a single serving.7 Energy shots come in\nsmaller-sized containers, typically less than 3 oz. The caf-\nfeine concentration in energy shots differs by product,\nwith some products containing in excess of 100 mg per\nfluid ounce.6 Currently, no maximal limit on caffeine is\nimposed by the US Food and Drug Administration for\neither caffeine-containing energy drinks or energy shots.\nIn contrast, the maximal limit on caffeine in a cola-type\nEnergy drinks were first introduced to the US mar-\nketplace in the late 1990s, and since then, there has been\nrapid growth in both the number of different types of\nproducts available and the varieties within a particular\nbrand.6 Industry data indicate that energy drinks and\nenergy shots constitute one of the fastest growing seg-\nments of the beverage market, with sales in the United\nAffiliations: AM Arria, BA Bugbee, KM Caldeira, and KB Vincent are with the Center on Young Adult Health and Development, Department of\nBehavioral and Community Health, University of Maryland School of Public Health, College Park, Maryland, USA.\nCorrespondence: AM Arria, Associate Professor, Center on Young Adult Health and Development, Department of Behavioral and\nCommunity Health, University of Maryland School of Public Health, 2387 School of Public Health Building, College Park, MD 20742, USA.\nKey words: adolescents, caffeine, energy drinks, energy shots, risk-taking behavior\nbs_bs_banner\nSupplement Article\nAlong with the rise in popularity of energy drinks\nhas been an increase in reports of emergency department\nthere was an estimated twofold increase in the number of\nindividuals presenting to emergency departments after\nsubstance (such as prescription medications) in addition\nthe ages of 12 and 17 years were admitted to the emer-\ngency department following consumption of an energy\ndrink either alone or in combination with another sub-\nstance.

Recent concerns about possible\ncardiovascular effects from high levels of caffeine in\nenergy drinks have been raised in the scientific\nliterature.7,13\u00ad16 More generally, the American Academy of\nPediatrics has raised safety concerns about the inclusion\nof energy drinks in the diets of children,17 and the Ameri-\ncan Medical Association issued a resolution to ban the\nmarketing of these beverages to individuals under the age\nData to describe consumption patterns among the\nUS population are scarce. Federally funded US national\nepidemiologic surveys that track annual trends in health\nbehaviors and nutritional habits among adults and chil-\ndren have included very few questions about the con-\nsumption of energy drinks. In 2010, the National Health\nInterview Survey included a supplement containing the\nfollowing question on the topic:\"During the past month,\nhow often did you drink sports and energy drinks,such as\nGatorade, Red Bull, and Vitamin Water?\"19 To our knowl-\nedge, there have been no published reports of these data.\nThe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\naccepts entries of energy drinks as part of a 24-h dietary\nrecall on beverages,and provides example cards of energy\nbeverages but it does not specifically inquire about their\nOne of the most widely used surveys to measure the\nhealth-risk behaviors of American schoolchildren is the\nNIH-funded Monitoring the Future (MTF) Survey,\nwhich began including questions about energy drinks in\n2010. Estimates of consumption of alcohol containing\ncaffeine became available in the MTF reports in 2011\ntenth, and twelfth graders, respectively, consumed\ncaffeinated alcoholic beverages during the past year.21\nFor college students and young adults between the ages\nof 19 and 28 years, these estimates were even higher\npublicly available, the annual MTF reports have not\nincluded consumption estimates for energy drinks and\nenergy shots without alcohol. Nevertheless, an analysis\nof the MTF data on energy drinks and energy shots,\nconducted by Terry-McElrath et al.,22 found an associa-\ntion between the frequency of their consumption and\nsubstance use; however, that study analyzed the use of\nenergy drinks and energy shots as one variable, rather\nthan analyzing use of the products separately. Addition-\nally, the study did not describe subgroup variation of\nenergy drink or energy shot use by race or grade level\nand did not report data on the quantity of energy drinks\nconsumed.\nIt is important to understand the extent to which\nenergy drinks are becoming a part of the adolescent and\nyoung-adult diet. The nutritional requirements during\nadolescence, defined as the period between the ages of 13\nand 18 years, is marked by complex hormonal changes\nthat result in pubertal development and growth. The\nrapid physical growth that occurs during this period\nrequires the increased intake of calories, protein, vita-\nmins, and minerals.23 Future eating patterns are often\nestablished during adolescence, making this a critical\nperiod with lifelong nutritional implications.24\nNo research could be located that focused specifically\non the potential effects of caffeine consumption on physi-\ncal growth and development during childhood and ado-\nlescence.However,the effects of caffeine use on disrupted\nsleep patterns are well recognized.25 Interestingly,\ndaytime sleepiness related to caffeine and other substance\nuse has been shown to be related to poor academic\nperformance among a large sample of adolescents.26 A\nlaboratory study of caffeine use during a critical develop-\nmental period has shown a relationship between caffeine\nadministration and decreases in sleep quality and brain\nIn addition to the attention paid to the possible car-\ndiovascular effects of consuming high levels of\ncaffeine,7,13\u00ad16 other research studies have pointed to an\nassociation between consumption of energy drinks and\ndifferent types of risk-taking behavior among adoles-\ncents and young adults. Adolescence is a peak develop-\nmental period for risk-taking, which many believe is\nnormative and biologically driven.28 New research in the\nfield of developmental neuroscience has shed light on\nthe complex structural and functional changes that take\nplace in the brain from adolescence through the early\nare more likely than older individuals to take risks\nwithout regard for possible consequences and why there\nmight be an inherent reliance on peers when making\ndecisions.\nBecause of the pharmacologic stimulating proper-\nties of caffeine, it is possible that consumption of\ncaffeine-containing energy drinks might potentiate the\nrisk-taking behavior that is normative to adolescent\ndevelopment. At least two non\u00admutually exclusive\nmechanisms have been suggested to explain the rela-\ntionship between energy drinks and substance use. First,\nfrom a biological perspective, through its interaction\nwith dopamine, early caffeine use could potentially\nprime neural reward circuitry such that the individual\nexperiences a more positive response to other drugs.36,37\nSupporting this hypothesis is evidence suggesting cross-\nsensitization between caffeine and nicotine.38 Second,\nconsumers of energy drinks might be more likely to use\nother drugs because of an underlying general propensity\nfor risk-taking.\nThe present review reports prevalence estimates of\nenergy drink and energy shot use by grade, gender, and\nrace/ethnicity from secondary data analyses of the MTF\ndata set. These findings are complemented with a\nsummary of results from studies utilizing college student\nand adult samples. Secondarily, the review summarizes\nresearch to date on the link between use of energy drinks\nand various forms of risk-taking behavior.\nData from MTF surveys are available for public use via\nthe National Addiction and HIV Data Archive Program.39\nTo estimate the prevalence of energy drink consumption\namong adolescents in the United States, data were ana-\nthe most recent data available at the time the analyses\nwere performed. These secondary data analyses were\napproved by the University of Maryland Institutional\nReview Board. MTF is a cross-sectional paper-and-pencil\nsurvey administered annually to eighth,tenth,and twelfth\ngraders attending more than 100 public and private\nschools across the 48 contiguous states.40 Multistage\nrandom sampling occurs first at the level of geographic\nareas, or \"primary sampling units\"; next, at the school\nlevel within each selected geographic area; and, finally, at\nthe class level within each selected school. Surveys are\nthen self-administered to all students in selected class-\nrooms (or the entire school, for smaller schools). Due to\nthe large number of topics assessed, several alternative\nforms of the MTF questionnaire are developed each year\n(i.e., six for twelfth graders; four for eighth and tenth\ngraders), with each form containing only a subset of all\npossible questionnaire items. Forms are distributed ran-\ndomly, and the resulting subsamples show no significant\ndifferences.\nfor twelfth graders to 91% for eighth graders.40 Data were\ndownloaded from the National Addiction and HIV Data\nArchive Program and analyzed using SPSS statistical soft-\nware41 to estimate the prevalence of energy drink use and\nexamine variations in prevalence estimates by grade,\ngender, and race/ethnicity. Standard weighting proce-\ndures were used to adjust for differences in selection\nprobabilities at each level of the sampling design (i.e.,\nstudents, schools, and geographic areas) by assigning a\nsampling weight,provided in the dataset,for each respon-\nand/or energy shots were available for 5,207 eighth\n(weighted sample sizes). Analyses were replicated using\ndata collected in 2010 from separate samples of compa-\n2,142 twelfth graders); however, for ease of presentation,\ncomparisons across demographic subgroups are pre-\nThe questionnaire provided participants with the fol-\nlowing background information: \" `Energy drinks' are\nnonalcoholic beverages that usually contain high\namounts of caffeine, including such drinks as Red Bull,\nFull Throttle, Monster, and Rockstar. They are usually\nsold in 8- or 16-ounce cans or bottles\" and\"Energy drinks\nare also sold as small `shots' that usually contain just\n2 or 3 ounces.\" The questionnaire did not differentiate\nbetween sugar-containing and sugar-free energy drinks,\nnor did it differentiate between caffeine-containing and\nnon-caffeinated energy drinks. Ordinal responses to the\noriginal survey question, \"About how many (if any)\nenergy drinks do you drink per day on average?\" were\nrecoded into a three-level categorical variable represent-\ning daily use (\"One,\" \"Two,\" \"Three,\" \"Four,\" \"Five or six,\"\nand \"Seven or more\" per day), less than daily use (\"Less\nthan one\" per day), and non-use (\"None\"). No timeframe\nwas specified in the original question; therefore, current\nuse was operationalized as encompassing both daily use\nand less than daily use. Similar procedures were used for\nenergy shots.\nFigure 1A displays the 2011 prevalence estimates of\nenergy drink use by gender and race/ethnicity for eighth,\ntenth, and twelfth graders. Overall, 35% of eighth graders\nand 29% of both tenth and twelfth graders indicated they\nused energy drinks. One striking observation is that\neighth graders were more likely to consume energy\ndrinks compared with tenth and twelfth graders. For\nevery grade, males were more likely than females to use\nenergy drinks. Black individuals had the lowest preva-\nlence of energy drinks use regardless of grade. The\nhighest prevalence was observed among Hispanic eighth\ngraders (43%), and the lowest among black twelfth\nFigure 1B presents similar data related to energy shot\nconsumption. Overall, the consumption of energy shots\nwas less prevalent than for energy drinks, with 12%,\n9%, and 10% of eighth, tenth, and twelfth graders,\nrespectively, using energy shots. While gender differ-\nences were similar to what was observed for energy\ndrinks, racial/ethnic variations were less apparent.\nHowever, Hispanic eighth graders stood out as having a\nparticularly high prevalence (20%) relative to all other\nsubgroups.\nBecause questions on energy drinks and energy shots\nwere asked separately, it was possible to examine the pro-\nportions of students consuming both types of products.\nAs shown in the lowest layer of bars in Figure 2, between\n8% and 12% of students consumed both energy drinks\nand energy shots. Interestingly, almost all of the energy\nshot users also consumed energy drinks. Between 20%\nand 24% consumed energy drinks, but not energy shots,\nas shown in the highest layer of bars. It is also noteworthy\nthat there is considerable consistency in the results from\nTable 1 shows data on the daily use of energy drinks\nand energy shots. Eighth graders showed the highest\nprevalence of daily use for both energy drinks (18%) and\nenergy shots (7%). Consistent with results from\nFigures 1A and 1B, Hispanic eighth graders stood out\nFigure 1 Prevalence of recent energy drink (A) and energy shot (B) use, by sex, race, and school grade.\nagain as the subgroup with the highest prevalence of\ndaily use (22% for energy drinks and 11% for energy\nshots).\nAmong individuals who consumed these products,\nmost drank only one or less than one per day (see\nTable 2). Although individuals who drank two or more\nper day were in the minority, their proportion decreased\nwith age, similar to the trends observed in overall preva-\nlence of use and daily use. For instance, 24% of eighth\ngraders consuming energy drinks were drinking two\nor more per day, compared with 16% and 13% of their\ncounterparts in the tenth and twelfth grade, respect-\nively. This trend was evident in all six of the subgroups\nexamined, but was perhaps most pronounced among\nHispanics, with nearly a threefold difference in two-a-\nday use between eighth and twelfth graders (30% versus\n11% drinking two or more energy drinks per day). On\nthe other hand, two-a-day use was most prevalent\namong black eighth graders (33%). The age-related\ndecrease in quantity consumed was less consistent for\nenergy shot users. In at least two subgroups \u00ad namely,\nfemales and blacks \u00ad the proportion of energy shot users\ndrinking two or more shots per day changed very little\nwith age.\nThe prevalence of energy drink use among college stu-\ndents is presented in Table 3.As the table illustrates,use of\nthese beverages varied substantially among the samples\nstudied, primarily because of the different timeframes\nused to assess consumption. Both Arria et al.44 and\nMiller45 reported that 10% of college students in their\nsamples were \"weekly\" consumers. Other researchers\nreported higher estimates for weekly consumption.48 In\none study of energy drink consumption patterns,\nMalinauskas et al.5 found that 51% of college students\nconsumed more than one such beverage each month in\nan average month during the past semester. Across the\nvarious studies,even with the differences in methodology,\nuse of energy drinks appears to be even more common\namong college students than younger adolescents.\nSeveral observational studies and one experimental study\nhave examined the association between energy drink use\nFigure 2 Prevalence of recent use of energy drinks and/or shots, by school grade and year.\nTable 1 Prevalence of daily use of energy drinks and\nenergy shots by school grade, sex, and race.\nGroup Energy drinks Energy shots\nand various types of risk-taking behaviors (see Table 3).\nAll of the studies were conducted among college students\nand young adults, except for one study of 18-45-year-old\nmusicians. All but one of the studies gathered data using\ncross-sectional survey designs, whereby questions about\nenergy drink consumption were asked along with ques-\ntions about risk-taking behaviors. The results of these\nstudies are consistent and clearly show that users of\nenergy drinks are more likely to engage in risk-taking\nbehavior.\nMany forms of risk-taking behavior have been inves-\ntigated, including use of marijuana, tobacco, and other\nforms of drugs, risky sexual behavior, and seat belt omis-\nsion. Consumption of energy drinks, regardless of\nwhether they were mixed with alcohol at the time of\nconsumption, has been associated with alcohol-related\noutcomes. In a study of 298 college students, Skewes\net al.48 found a positive association between the typical\nnumber of energy drinks consumed per week and mea-\nsures of alcohol dependence, current symptoms of\nalcohol dependence, and alcohol-related problems when\ncontrolling for age, gender, and frequency of binge drink-\ning. Specifically, consumption of energy drinks was posi-\ntively associated with scores on theAlcohol Use Disorders\nIdentification Test (a screening tool used to identify haz-\nardous drinking),theYoung Adult Alcohol Consequences\nQuestionnaire (a measure of alcohol-related problems),\nand the Short Alcohol Dependence Data questionnaire (a\nmeasure of current alcohol dependence symptoms).\nTypical frequency of energy drink consumption was also\nassociated with two types of alcohol use motives:\nenhancement motives (i.e., drinking for enjoyment or for\nfun) and coping motives (i.e., drinking to forget one's\nproblems).\nArria et al.44 found a positive relationship between\nthe frequency of energy drink use and risk for alcohol\ndependence among college students, even after statistical\nadjustment for the level of alcohol consumption (i.e.,\ntypical quantity) and a wide range of background vari-\nables and other known risk factors for alcohol depen-\ndence, including sensation-seeking, conduct problems\nbefore the age of 18 years, the age of first alcohol intoxi-\ncation, depressive symptoms, and parental history of\nalcohol problems. Demographic variables also included\nin the model were sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic\nstatus, and involvement in a fraternity or sorority. Also\nunique to this study was that use of other caffeinated\nproducts was measured and used as a covariate in the\nanalyses. The breadth of variables included in this model\nwas important because it points to the possibility that\nenergy drink use and alcohol dependence might be inter-\nrelated in a meaningful way, rather than merely\nco-occurring due to shared risk factors, such as a general\npropensity to drink more alcohol.\nTable 2 Number of energy drinks and energy shots consumed per day, among self-reported users, by sex, race, and school grade.\nNo. of energy beverages\nconsumed/day\nMale (%) Female (%) Black (%) White (%) Hispanic (%) Total (%)\nEnergy drinks\nEnergy shots\nTable 3 Summary of studies investigating the relationship between energy drink use and risk behaviors.\nReference Sample Study design Prevalence of energy\ndrink use\nRisk behaviors studied Results\nArria et al.\n1,060 college students Prospective Typical use:\nIncident use of eight drugs Use associated with incident\nnonmedical prescription drug use\nand frequency of tobacco\nsmokinga\nArria et al.\n975 college students Cross-sectional Past-year use:\n51% less than weekly;\nAlcohol use and related problems,\nalcohol dependence\nUse associated with alcohol\ndependencea\nMiller\n602 college students Cross-sectional Past-month use: 38% Marijuana, tobacco, alcohol, and\nprescription drug use, sexual\nrisk-taking, seat belt omission\nUse associated with risk-taking; race/\nethnicity difference existed\nMiller et al.\nCross-sectional Past-year use: 57% Marijuana, psychedelic drug,\ncocaine, prescription drug, and\ntobacco use, binge drinking, and\nalcohol-related problems\nUse associated with prescription\ndrug misuse, binge drinking, and\nsocial problems related to alcohol\nusea\nPeacock\net al.\n28 young adults (age\nExperimental, within\nsubjects\nN/A Laboratory measure of risk-taking Small but significant relationship\nbetween energy drink condition\nand risk-taking task\nSkewes\net al.\n298 college students Cross-sectional 39% weekly use Hazardous alcohol use,\nalcohol-related problems,\nsymptoms of alcohol dependence,\nalcohol use motives\nUse associated with hazardous\nalcohol use, alcohol-related\nproblems, alcohol dependence,\nand coping and enhancement\nmotives\nSpierer et al.\ngraduate students\nCross-sectional 21% high users (at least\nthree times a week)\nRisky driving behaviors, tobacco,\nanabolic steroid, and illicit drug\nuse, sports-related risks\nUse associated with increased\nlikelihood of driving after drinking\nto inebriation and riding with a\ndrunk driver\nStasio et al.\n107 college students Cross-sectional Past-week use: 57% Anxiety, sleep quality Use accounted for 29% and 20% of\nvariance in anxiety and sleep\nquality, respectively.a\nTrapp et al.\nCross-sectional 48% monthly use Alcohol, cigarette, illicit drug use Monthly use associated with\nincreased alcohol consumption,\ncigarette smoking, use of ecstasy\nand marijuana, and the number of\nillicit drugs used\nVelazquez\net al.\n(underclassmen)\nCross-sectional Past-month use: 40%\nAlcohol use, heavy drinking, mixing\nalcohol and energy drinks\nUse associated with greater risk of all\nbehaviors studied\nWoolsey\net al.\ngraduate students\nCross-sectional Past-year use: 83% Nonmedical use of prescription\nstimulants\nUse significantly associated with\nnonmedical prescription stimulant\nuse\na Controlled for other types of caffeine use.\nAnother study of college students reported that\napproximately one-third of past-month energy drink\nusers had consumed the beverage mixed with alcohol.52\nFrequency of energy drink use was also associated with\nalcohol quantity consumed during a single event.A study\nof young adults in Australia51 also found that alcohol\nquantity was associated with consuming energy drinks at\nleast monthly. In another study, Miller45 found that\nthe frequency of energy drink use and alcohol pro-\nblems were positively associated for white but not black\nundergraduates.\nA study of musicians between the ages of 18 and 45\nyears found that the frequency of energy drink consump-\ntion was positively associated with binge drinking and\nalcohol-related social problems, even when controlling\nfor demographic variables, sensation-seeking, impulsiv-\nity, and other types of caffeine use.46\nOther substance use has also been associated with the\nconsumption of energy drinks, including marijuana,\ntobacco, and nonmedical use of prescription\nquency of energy drink use was associated with nonmedi-\ncal use of prescription stimulants, with 22.2% of the\nconsumers using prescription stimulants for nonmedical\npurposes. Miller45 found that consumption of energy\ndrinks was associated with nonmedical use of prescrip-\ntion drugs among white,but not black,undergraduates.In\nanother study, Miller and Quigley46 also found that\nenergy drink consumption was associated with nonmedi-\ncal prescription drug use even when controlling for other\ntypes of caffeine use. Trapp et al.51 reported that consum-\ning energy drinks at least monthly was associated with\nusing ecstasy and marijuana, as well as the number of\nillicit drugs used.\nSeveral other risk behaviors have been linked to\nenergy drink consumption. Miller45 found that sexual\nrisk-taking (e.g., unprotected intercourse, having inter-\ncourse under the influence of alcohol or other drugs),\nparticipating in extreme sports, seatbelt omission, and\ntaking risks on a dare were more common among high-\nfrequency (at least once a week) energy drink consumers\nthan low-frequency consumers. Another study of college\nstudents found that past-week consumption of caffeine-\ncontaining energy drinks accounted for 29% and 21% of\nthe variance in anxiety and sleep disturbances, respec-\ntively,when controlling for other types of caffeine use.50 A\nstudy of students at a predominantly minority university\nreported that energy drink consumption was associated\nwith drunk driving and riding in a car with an inebriated\nOne experimental study has been conducted on risk-\ntaking behaviors related to energy drink consumption.47\nParticipants attended four sessions. They were randomly\nassigned to consume one of four beverages at each session\nin a counterbalanced order: a caffeine-containing energy\ndrink, alcohol, a caffeine-containing energy drink\nmixed with alcohol, or a placebo beverage. Doses of\nalcohol and caffeine were based on body weight. After\nconsuming the beverages, participants completed the\nBalloon Analogue Risk Task, which is a laboratory\nmeasure of risk-taking.A small but significant increase in\nrisk-taking was seen only among participants who had\nconsumed the nonalcoholic caffeine-containing energy\ndrink.\nThe only prospective study conducted to date on the\nrelationship between energy drink use and risk-taking\nbehavior was guided by prior research suggesting that use\nof caffeine might exacerbate the underlying vulnerability\nto the use of other substances. Arria et al.43 examined the\nprospective relationship between use of energy drinks\nduring the second year of college and the risk for other\nforms of drug use during the subsequent year, after\nadjusting for prior use of each drug, demographic char-\nacteristics, and the use of other types of caffeine. The\nresults showed that after adjustment for these variables,\nenergy drink users were more likely to initiate nonmedi-\ncal use of prescription stimulants and analgesics and they\nincreased the frequency with which they smoked tobacco.\nThe adjusted odds ratio associated with energy drink use\nfor incident stimulant and analgesic use were 2.05 and\nThe consumption of alcohol mixed with energy\ndrinks has been linked to acute health risks and serious\nalcohol-related consequences.54\u00ad60 For further discussion\nof the consumption of alcohol mixed with energy drinks,\nsee Marczinski et al.61 in this issue.\nAmong adolescents, Terry-McElrath et al.22 found\nthat the consumption of energy drinks and energy shots\nis associated with past-month frequency of alcohol, ciga-\nrettes, marijuana, and amphetamine use among eighth,\ntenth, and twelfth graders, even after adjusting for demo-\ngraphic variables.\nThe analyses of MTF data presented here show that\nalmost one in three secondary school students in the\nUnited States reported recent consumption of an energy\ndrink.Data on energy drink consumption from Canadian\nadolescents shows wide variation by province, with esti-\nsuming energy drinks during the past year.62\nThis high prevalence of energy drink consumption\nunderscores the need to demonstrate the safety of con-\nsuming these beverages, especially for individuals\nbetween the ages of 13 and 18 years.As mentioned above,\nthe amount of caffeine per serving and the concentrations\nof caffeine among the beverages in this class vary\nwidely.6,7 The acute and long-term health consequences\nof such consumption are not yet fully known.\nResearch is needed to develop more comprehensive\nassessment methods for energy drink and energy shot\nconsumption. Despite the methodological strengths of\nthe MTF survey, including its large sample size and its\nnational representation, only a few questions were asked\nabout the use of energy drinks and energy shots. Because\nof this, the results cannot provide sufficient information\nabout patterns of use, specific products consumed, con-\ntexts, or consequences. It would be useful to know, for\nexample, the proportion of youth that have used various\ntypes of energy drinks in a defined time period, such as\nthe past year or the past month, in order to more accu-\nrately estimate how much caffeine is being consumed by\nadolescents. Among users, assessments are needed that\ncan reliably quantify the amounts of the beverages con-\nsumed (e.g.,typical,maximum,minimum) and how regu-\nlarly consumption occurs. Given the concerns regarding\nthe effects that ingesting high doses of caffeine can have\non acute cardiovascular functioning, and during physical\nactivity, future measures should attempt to characterize\npatterns of energy drink use (e.g., acute, chronic) and the\ncontexts in which they are used (e.g., during exercise or\nsporting activities),particularly since marketing messages\nfor energy drinks often involve associations with physical\nAt a fundamental level, it is important to understand\nhow these beverages are being incorporated into the usual\ndietary intake of adolescents. It is possible that these\ndrinks are replacing other beverages (e.g., water, soda,\nsports drinks), but they might, alternatively, be consumed\nin addition to other types of beverages. Concerns have\nbeen raised about the dietary choices that adolescents and\nyoung adults make, including the types of nutritional\nsupplements and beverages they consume.64,65 Recent\ndata suggest that caffeine intake among children and ado-\nlescents in the United States has remained steady during\nthe last decade, but the proportion of caffeine intake that\ncomes from energy drinks and coffee is increasing.66 The\nextent to which energy drink consumption might be con-\ntributing to weight gain is an aspect that is not as well\nunderstood as for other sugar-sweetened beverages.67 The\ndata presented here show that few youth report consum-\ning energy shots alone; instead, energy shots are con-\nsumed in addition to larger-volume energy drinks.\nAlthough data from the MTF surveys do not differentiate\nbetween sugar-containing and sugar-free energy drinks,\nsome of these beverages contain substantial amounts of\nsugar in addition to caffeine. It will be important for\nfuture research to understand the extent to which energy\ndrink consumption is a source of \"empty calories\" in the\nadolescent diet, and therefore a potential target for\nobesity prevention strategies. Malinauskas et al.5 reported\nthat 74% of college students who consumed energy\ndrinks drank sugar-containing versions, with females\nbeing over-represented among individuals who con-\nsumed sugar-free versions.\nIn contrast to the health concerns about the cardio-\nvascular effects of energy drinks that have been raised\nfor several years, a newer concern relates to the poss-\nible effects of high levels of caffeine on the developing\nkilogram of caffeine per day has been suggested for\nSpecific subgroups appear to be at increased risk for\nconsuming excessive caffeine. Namely, eighth graders\nwere both more likely to have consumed an energy drink\nand to have consumed greater quantities of such bever-\nages and energy shots than their older counterparts.Simi-\nlarly,Hispanic youth were more likely to consume energy\ndrinks and energy shots than other racial/ethnic groups.\nNo data are available to shed light on possible contribu-\ntory factors underlying this observed subgroup variation.\nAdolescents begin to make more autonomous dietary\nchoices during this time, and personal preference begins\nto play a larger role.24 Although parents'influence on food\nchoices decreases throughout this period, parental mod-\neling still plays a role in determining adolescents' food\nchoices.24,70 For example, in one study of adolescent con-\nsumption of soft drinks, adolescents were approximately\nthree times more likely to consume soft drinks regularly if\nthey reported that their parents also consumed them\nregularly.70 Taste preference, peer habits, habit strength,\nand mass media have also been identified as important\ninfluences on the food and beverage choices of\nadolescents.70\u00ad73 While it is tempting to speculate that dif-\nferences in family modeling of dietary practices or tar-\ngeted marketing practices might underlie these\ndifferences, future research is needed to fully explain dif-\nferent patterns of consumption.\nLittle research has been conducted to understand\npatterns of energy drink use among high-risk popula-\ntions, such as young individuals with cardiovascular\nabnormalities. No data are available to evaluate the safety\nof consuming highly caffeinated energy drinks concur-\nrently or simultaneously with stimulant medications\nand/or illicit substances used by adolescents and young\nadults.\nCONCLUSION\nWith respect to the association between energy drink\nconsumption and risk-taking behavior, the studies\nreviewed herein consistently demonstrate the existence of\nan association. However, more research is needed to\nclarify the nature of the observed relationship. For\nexample, it is not entirely clear whether the association\nstems from a general increased propensity for risk-taking\nbehavior among energy drink users or whether energy\ndrinks potentiate risk-taking among users. A few studies\nadjusted statistically for measures of general risk-taking\npropensity still found strong associations between energy\ndrink use and alcohol-related problems.44,46 Further\nresearch is needed to understand the extent to which\ncaffeine use during adolescence potentiates the reinforc-\ning properties of other substances, especially because it is\na period of rapid brain development.31,74 Additionally,\nmore longitudinal research is needed to understand the\ntemporal relationship between energy drink use and risk-\ntaking behaviors.The one prospective study conducted to\ndate observed a relationship between energy drink\nconsumption and the incident or \"new\" use of nonmedi-\ncal prescription stimulants and analgesics, even after sta-\ntistical adjustment for other indicators of risk-taking\nGiven other research suggesting that adolescents are\nmore likely to experience the rewarding properties of\nsubstances,75 it is important to understand if high levels of\ncaffeine early in adolescence might be related to increased\nrisk for use of other psychoactive substances later in\nlife.36,37 It is clear that neurobiological changes during\nadolescence partially explain why adolescents are more\nlikely than older individuals to engage in risk-taking\nbehavior76\u00ad78 and perhaps less likely to fully recognize the\nconsequences of such behavior. How the use of caffeine\nand energy drinks fits into the sequence of underage\nalcohol use and the use of other drugs among adolescents\nrequires further inquiry.\nIt is possible that energy drink consumption during\nthe developmental periods of adolescence and young\nadulthood potentiates natural risk-taking behaviors of\nyoung people due to the stimulating pharmacological\neffects of caffeine. This possibility raises questions about\nthe appropriateness of marketing and selling highly\ncaffeinated energy drinks to adolescents because they\nmight be especially susceptible to the potentiating effects\nof energy drink use on risk-taking behavior. More\nresearch is warranted to fully understand the relationship\nbetween energy drink use and risk-taking behavior and\nhow the dose and pattern of caffeine consumption might\nmediate the relationship. Resolving these issues based on\nscientific evidence is needed to promote and protect ado-\nlescent and young adult health and safety.\n"
