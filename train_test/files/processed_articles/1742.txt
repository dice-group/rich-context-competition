Data from the Health Care Financing Administration's (HCFA)\nMedicare Health Outcomes Survey (MHOS) of patients enrolled in managed care\nservices through Medicare were analyzed. The MHOS provided baseline estimates\nof quality of life of cancer survivors in comparison to a frequency age-matched\ncohort of noncancer patients.\n22,747 respondents who had been diagnosed with cancer were frequency age\nmatched to an equal number of noncancer patients.\nRESULTS. Cancer survivors had statistically significantly poorer scores than non-\ncancer patients on all eight subscales as well as on the Physical Component and\nMental Component summary measures of the Medical Outcomes Study Short\nForm-36 (MOS SF-36). Comparisons by type and number of cancers for which an\nindividual was currently in treatment showed lowest quality of life for those in\ntreatment for lung carcinoma, followed by those who were in treatment for more\nthan one type of cancer.\nCONCLUSION. The data suggest that cancer shows negative effects on health-related\nquality of life that are not explainable by simple effects of age because frequency\nage-matched cancer survivors had statistically significantly lower scores on all 10\nscores of the MOS SF-36. Effect sizes are evaluated to determine the clinical\nsignificance of these differences in health-related quality of life. The MHOS offers\nuseful data for planning and improving cancer policy and programs. Cancer 2003;\nKEYWORDS: quality of life, oncology, cancer survivors, managed care, Medicare,\nprogram planning, American Cancer Society, prostate carcinoma, breast carcinoma,\ncolorectal carcinoma\nCancer occurs later in life, with nearly 80% of all cancers diagnosed\namong individuals at 55 years and older.1 Currently, cancer is the\nsecond leading cause of death in the United States.1 However, due to\nimprovements in prevention, early detection, and treatment, cancer\ndeath rates for all sites combined decreased an average of 0.6% per\nsurvivors in the United States.3 The term \"cancer survivor\" is defined\nin several ways. The traditional National Institutes of Health defini-\ntion of a cancer survivor was someone who had survived cancer for 5\nyears and was disease free. The American Cancer Society (ACS) has\nadopted a broader definition of a cancer survivor. Its definition in-\ncludes people from the time of their diagnosis with cancer and for the\nbalance of their lives, a definition that has been used by the National\nPublished 2003 by the American Cancer Society*\nCoalition for Cancer Survivorship for a number of\nyears.4 This is the definition used in this article.\nThe ACS has issued three cancer challenge goals\nfor the year 2015, which include decreasing incidence\nand mortality due to cancer. Recognizing that cancer\nand its treatment may result in physical impairments\nas well as psychosocial losses, these goals also include\nimproving the health-related quality of life (HRQOL)\nof cancer survivors.5 Attempting to achieve any of\nthese three goals poses formidable difficulties. How-\never, unlike incidence and mortality, quality of life has\nthe additional problem of lacking a commonly agreed\nupon standard of measurement for assessing the cur-\nrent status of this variable and any progress that is\nmade in improving it.\nOver the past two decades, increased attention\nhas been given to developing HRQOL as an operation-\nally defined patient-report based measure, and HRQOL\nhas become a standard outcome measure in cancer\nclinical trials.6,7 Recognition of the need to include\nHRQOL as part of population-based assessments of\nhealth status has also increased. The ACS is beginning\nto conduct its own population-based studies of the\nHRQOL, psychosocial adaptation, and changing needs\nof cancer survivors. However, this will take time, and\ndata are needed now to use as a guide for program\ndevelopment. The available data on the HRQOL of\ncancer survivors are provided by relatively small op-\nportunistic samples. Because of the difficulties of sep-\narating the effects of cancer on HRQOL from effects\nthat are due to comorbid conditions and other life\nchanges, additional data on a comparable sample of\nnoncancer patients are needed for comparison.\nThe available data comparing the quality of life of\ncancer survivors with individuals who have never had\ncancer show little difference. A Canadian study8 com-\npared the HRQOL of breast carcinoma survivors 8\nyears after diagnosis. In that study, fewer cancer sur-\nvivors reported positive quality of life than similarly\naged controls, but these differences were small and\nnonsignificant. Another Canadian study9 compared\nindex cancer cases with neighborhood controls of a\nsimilar age and gender. The quality of life of the cancer\nsurvivors was found to be similar to the neighborhood\ncontrols. A French population-based case\u00adcontrol\nstudy found that testicular carcinoma survivors with a\nmean follow-up of 11 years did not differ significantly\nin HRQOL from controls.10 A Swedish study11 compar-\ning HRQOL in long-term head and neck carcinoma\nsurvivors with general population norms showed no\nsignificant differences except on the role-physical\nscale of the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36\n(MOS SF-36). These studies did not include U.S. sam-\nples and were limited in sample size. This article com-\npares cancer survivors with noncancer patients in a\nreasonably large sample of respondents.\nIn April 1999, the ACS hosted a conference in\nArlington, VA, to bring together major government\nagencies to identify possible collaborations and to\nshare information on how each was attempting to\nmeasure the HRQOL of various populations. This ar-\nticle is the result of a successful collaboration initiated\nat that meeting, i.e., a collaboration between the ACS\nand the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA;\nrecently renamed the Centers for Medicare and Med-\nicaid Services). The collaboration led to an analysis of\ndata from the 1998 Medicare Health Outcomes Survey\n(MHOS) of patients receiving managed care services\nthrough Medicare. This analysis compared the\nHRQOL responses of cancer survivors with those of\nfrequency age-matched respondents who were not\ncancer survivors, using the definition of cancer survi-\nvor as any person who is living after a diagnosis of\ncancer.\nSurvey Instrument\nThe MHOS was developed by the National Committee\nfor Quality Assurance (NCQA) under contract to HCFA\nto measure the outcomes of care provided by Medi-\ncare  Choice organizations to Medicare beneficiaries\nenrolled in these health plans. This performance mea-\nsure was included in the 1998 Health Plan Employer\nData and Information Set (HEDIS 3.0) for Medicare. A\ntechnical expert panel of representatives from health\nplans, health services researchers, and clinicians as-\nsisted in the development of the tool.12 Originally\ncalled the Health of Seniors survey and later renamed\nthe Medicare Health Outcomes Survey, the MHOS\nincluded a 95-item core and a five-item variable mod-\nule.\nMeasures\nThe core instrument included a measure of HRQOL\nand questions to collect demographic information.\nThe HRQOL measure was the MOS SF-36, a 36-item\nwell tested, valid, and reliable self-report tool that has\nbeen used in hundreds of studies world-wide to mea-\nThe eight scales of the MOS SF-36 include the\nfollowing:\n1. Physical functioning (PF). Ten questions that ask\nthe extent to which health limits the performance\nof physical activities.\n2. Role-physical (RP). Four questions that ask indi-\nviduals the extent to which their physical health\nQuality of Life of Cancer Patients/Baker et al. 675\nlimits them in their work or other usual activities\nin terms of time and performance.\n3. Bodily pain (BP). Two questions that ask individ-\nuals about the severity of their pain and the extent\nto which pain interferes with normal work, includ-\ning work outside the home and housework.\n4. General health (GH). Five questions that ask indi-\nviduals to rate their current health status overall,\ntheir susceptibility to disease, and their expecta-\ntions for health in the future.\n5. Vitality (VT). Four questions that ask individuals to\nrate subjective well-being in terms of energy and\nfatigue.\n6. Social functioning (SF). Two questions that ask\nindividuals about limitations in normal social\nfunctioning due specifically to health.\n7. Role-emotional (RE). Three questions that ask\nwhether emotional problems have interfered with\naccomplishments at work or other usual activities\nin terms of time as well as performance.\n8. Mental health (MH). Five questions that ask how\nfrequently the respondent experiences feelings re-\nlated to anxiety, depression, loss of behavioral or\nemotional control, and psychological well-being.\nThese eight scales provide the basis for calculating\ntwo summary measures, the Physical Component\nSummary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary\n(MCS). One additional question that asks the respon-\ndents to rate their general health compared to one\nyear ago is also included but is not used in calculating\nthe two summary measure scores. The MOS SF-36 is\nscored so that higher scores represent better function-\ning on both the two summary measures and on all\neight subscales. Norm based scaling is used so that\nscores are standardized using normative values for the\ngeneral U.S. population. A score of 50 represents the\nnational average for both the summary scores and for\nthe subscales. A score that is 10 points above or below\nthe mean score of 50 represents a difference of 1\nstandard deviation from the national average.\nProcedures\nThe survey was sent to a random sample of 1,000\nMedicare beneficiaries continuously enrolled for at\nleast six months in each plan with a Medicare contract\nin place on or before January 1, 1997. In plans with\n1,000 or fewer Medicare enrollees, all eligible mem-\nbers were surveyed. The sampling frame included the\naged and the disabled but excluded those eligible for\nMedicare because of end stage renal disease, since\nthese patients are not eligible to enroll in a managed-\ncare plan. To ensure the validity and reliability of the\ndata collected, plans were instructed to contract with\none of six NCQA-certified vendors for administration\nof the survey. The survey was administered to the first\ncohort at baseline (May 1998) and again to the same\ncohort in spring 2000. A new cohort will be selected\neach year for baseline measurement.\naged care plans covering 287 market areas. Completed\nraw response rate of 60%. Data files were aggregated\nby NCQA and forwarded to HCFA's data cleaning,\nanalysis, and dissemination contractor, the Health\nServices Advisory Group Health Outcomes Team. An\nanalytic data set was created that merged plan char-\nacteristics from HCFA administrative data files with\nthe survey response data and patient demographic\nand entitlement information from the Medicare En-\nrollment Data Base. This augmented file was delivered\nFor purposes of this study, two separate files were\ncreated from the MHOS Cohort 1 final data set. The\nfirst file consisted of all respondents who answered\npositively when asked if a physician had ever told\nthem that they had any cancer other than skin carci-\nwhom we defined as cancer survivors using the ACS\ndefinition of a cancer survivor as anyone still living\nafter a cancer diagnosis.\nThe second data set created was a file of respon-\ndents who indicated that no physician had ever told\nthem that they had cancer other than skin carcinoma.\nA frequency age-matched sample of noncancer pa-\ntients was randomly selected for inclusion in the an-\nalytic data set using 13 age categories: 29 or younger,\nused a frequency age-matched cohort analytic ap-\nproach to better assess differences between cancer\nsurvivors and those who had never been diagnosed\nwith cancer.\nData Analysis\nBoth for those who were cancer survivors and those\nwho were not, only individuals whose Medicare enti-\ntlement was based on being aged 65 or older were\nincluded in the analyses. Individuals younger than 65\n(whose entitlement was based on a disability) were\nnot included. A single SAS data file including all indi-\nviduals who met these criteria (n  43,757) was cre-\nated for use in the analyses. One-way and two-way\nanalyses of variance performed in PROC GLM were\nused to compare mean MOS SF-36 standardized\nscores. Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD)\ntests were used in post hoc testing. Chi-square tests in\nPROC FREQ were used for demographic comparisons.\nMultiple linear regression analyses to test for indepen-\ndent predictors of MOS SF-36 subscale and summary\nscores were performed in PROC REG.\nRESULTS\nTable 1 presents data on sample characteristics. Both\nthe cancer survivors and those who did not report\nhaving been diagnosed with any cancer other than\nskin carcinoma (hereafter referred to as the no-cancer\ngroup or noncancer subjects) were equally divided\nbetween the elderly (65\u00ad74 years old) and the older\nelderly (75 years and older). Both groups had a some-\nwhat higher percentage of female than male respon-\ndents and were predominately white and non-His-\npanic. The majority of individuals in both groups were\ncurrently married and about 30% in each group were\nwidowed. About 30% of both groups had less than a\nhigh school education, and 34.4% of each group re-\nported graduation from high school as their highest\neducational attainment. Less than one-fifth in each\ngroup reported an annual household income of less\ngroup reported an annual household income of\nbeing in treatment for breast, colorectal, lung, or pros-\ntate carcinoma only.

The remaining four scales--\nMC, BP, RE, and MH--had effect sizes less than 0.2.\nAlthough four, the differences were statistically signif-\nicant for these four scales, they are not practically\nsignificant, as judged by the magnitude of the effect.\nMultiple linear regressions showed that having\nbeen diagnosed with cancer was still a significant pre-\ndictor of MOS SF-36 summary and subscale scores\neven after the effects of a number of other variables\nwere taken into account. Variables for inclusion in the\nregression models were selected based on a technical\nreport prepared for the HCFA and NCQA.15 Nonmed-\nical variables included in the models were age (in\nyears), gender, race (white/nonwhite), Hispanic eth-\nSample Characteristics by Cancer Status: MHOS 1998 Baseline Data\nCharacteristic\nCancer\nsurvivors No cancer\nNo. (%) No. (%)\nAge group (yrs)\nGendera\nRacea\nHispanica\nMaterial statusa\nEducationa\nHousehold incomea\nCurrently in treatment for N/A N/A\nIn treatment for more than one\nMHOS: Medicare Health Outcomes Survey; HS: high school; GED: general education.\na Chi-square P value  0.001 for comparing cancer survivors with those who reported not having been\ndiagnosed with any cancer other than skin carcinoma.\nQuality of Life of Cancer Patients/Baker et al. 677\nnicity (yes/no), annual income (/ $20,000), marital\nstatus (married/not married), education (/ high\nschool graduate), home ownership (yes/no), and data\ncollection mode (paper/phone).

Means and post hoc testing results for the two\nsummary measures and eight subscales are shown in\nTable 4. Generally, mean scores are ordered from\nhighest to lowest in the following sequence: no cancer;\ncancer not currently in treatment for breast, colorec-\ntal, lung, or prostate carcinoma; in treatment for pros-\ntate carcinoma only; in treatment for breast carci-\nnoma only; in treatment for colorectal carcinoma\nonly; in treatment for more than one cancer; and in\ntreatment for lung carcinoma only. For all 10 scales,\nthose currently in treatment for lung carcinoma only\nor for more than one cancer had significantly lower\nmean scores than any of the other five groups. Those\nwho had not been diagnosed with cancer had the\nhighest mean score on all 10 scales and their mean for\neach scale was significantly higher than the means for\nany of the five in treatment groups except the group in\ntreatment for prostate carcinoma only (which differed\nsignificantly from noncancer subjects on 5 of the 10\nscales). Mean scores for those in treatment for breast\ncarcinoma only or for colorectal carcinoma only were\nconsistently lower than the means for those being\ntreated for prostate carcinoma only and were consis-\ntently higher than means for those being treated for\nlung carcinoma only or for more than one of the four\nlisted cancers.\nAlthough the effect sizes for the overall cancer\ngroup compared with the noncancer group were small\nor nonexistent, larger effect sizes were found when\nusing the treatment groups described above for com-\nparison to the noncancer group. For example, the\neffect size for GHS for those currently in treatment for\ncolorectal carcinoma was 0.55 (moderate) and the ef-\nfect size for PCS for those currently in treatment for\nlung carcinoma was 1.02 (large), corresponding to\nscore differences of 5.5 and 10.2 points. The effect\nsizes can be summarized as follows for each treatment\ngroup compared with the noncancer group: currently\nnot in treatment for breast, colorectal, prostate, or\neffect except small effect for GHS and RPS); in treat-\nfects for all except MCS and MHS); in treatment for\nall except GHS and SFS, which were moderate); in\ntreatment for more than one of the four cancers, 0.48\u00ad\n0.90 (large effects for GHS and SFS, moderate for all\nothers except BPS, which was small); and in treatment\nPCS, PFS, RFS, GHS, VTS, and SFS, moderate for all\nothers).\nDISCUSSION\nThe central purpose of this article is to compare the\nquality of life of a large national sample of cancer\nMean MOS SF-36 Standardized Scores by Cancer/Treatment Status: MHOS 1998 Baseline Data\nNo cancer\nCancer but not\nin treatment\nProstate\ncarcinoma in\ntreatment\nBreast carcinoma\nin treatment\nColorectal\ncarcinoma in\ntreatment\nIn treatment\nfor more than\none cancer\nLung carcinoma\ntreatment\nMOS SF-36: Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36; MHOS: Medicare Health Outcomes Survey; PCS: Physical Component Summary; MCS: Mental Component Summary.\na Not currently in treatment for breast, colorectal, lung, or prostate carcinoma.\nb Currently in treatment for more than one of the following carcinoma: breast, colorectal, lung, prostate.\nc P  0.001 for difference in mean scores across cancer/treatment groups in one-way analysis of variance.\nd\u00adi Tukey groupings in post hoc testing; means within the same Tukey grouping are not significantly different from one another.\nQuality of Life of Cancer Patients/Baker et al. 679\nsurvivors who completed the MOS SF-36 as part of the\nMHOS with that of a frequency age-matched sample\nof noncancer MHOS respondents. No claim is made\nthat this sample of managed care recipients in the\nMedicare program is representative of the Medicare\npopulation. However, this data set provides informa-\ntion on a large sample of people 65 and older who\nhave access to care through Medicare, some of whom\nhave received a diagnosis of cancer at some point in\ntheir lives, and on an age-comparable group who have\nnot been diagnosed with cancer.\nAs a basis for examining the quality of life of\ncancer survivors, the MOS SF-36 has a number of\nstrong practical advantages. Among its strengths is its\napplicability to many disease groups as well as the\ngeneral population, so that it can be used to make\ncomparisons between cancer patients and patients\nwith other diseases as well as healthy populations.\nSince most studies of the quality of life of cancer\nsurvivors lack either a non-cancer control group or\nbroad normative data on non-cancer patients against\nwhich to compare findings, this is a very important\nadvantage in attempting to sort out the contribution\nof cancer and cancer treatment to differences in qual-\nity of life versus the effects of comorbitidites and nat-\nural aging.\nResearch documents the responsiveness of the\nscales and summary scores of the MOS SF-36 to vari-\nous treatment interventions.16 Findings indicate that\nsmall absolute differences in scores are clinically\nmeaningful. For instance, a study documented that\nuntreated asthmatics reported a PCS score 3.7 points\nlower than asthmatics treated with drugs. Another\nshowed that people suffering from a migraine head-\naches reported an increase in PCS score of 2.09 points\nwhen their headache was treated. Therefore, the dif-\nference in mean physical functioning between cancer\nsurvivors in our study (mean PCS score  38.5) and in\nthe noncancer group (mean PCS score  41.2) can be\nlikened to the increase in physical limitations experi-\nenced when suffering from untreated migraine head-\nache, which is clinically meaningful. Clinical signifi-\ncance of the differences found in our study is also\nevidenced by the effect sizes seen, especially with\nregard to the impact of treatment status on HRQOL.\nOur data show that cancer patients have statisti-\ncally significantly poorer quality of life than noncancer\nrespondents as measured by all eight subscales of the\nMOS SF-36 and the two summary measures even after\nconsidering the effects of other variables. These dif-\nferences in HRQOL, however, represented small ef-\nfects for five of the eight MOS SF-36 subscales. Of the\nsummary measures, only the PCS showed a small ef-\nfect. The effect size for MCS did not indicate any\npractical significance. These data support the view\nthat cancer is a uniquely traumatizing event, produc-\ning broad negative impact on a variety of dimensions\nof a survivor's HRQOL.\nSecondary analysis of data collected for broader\npurposes can limit the questions one can ask of these\ndata. One limitation of this data is the absence of\ninformation on the time since cancer diagnosis. Al-\nthough these data do not allow clear analysis by stage\nof recovery, there is evidence in these results that\npatients who have access to care through Medicare\nmanaged care continue to have serious biomedical\nand psychosocial HRQOL problems. This should re-\nceive further attention, particularly as these quality-\nof-life dimensions are significantly worse for the can-\ncer survivors than for same-age controls who have not\nhad to deal with the physical and psychosocial se-\nquelae of cancer.\nThese data also allow a comparison by type and\nnumber of cancers for which a subject is currently\nbeing treated. Analyses were made across the condi-\ntion of having no cancer; having a cancer diagnosis\nbut not in treatment for breast, colorectal, lung, or\nprostate carcinoma; or in treatment for one or more of\nthese four common types of cancer. As these analyses\nshow, those who had not been diagnosed with cancer\nhad statistically significantly higher HRQOL scores. In\ncontrast to the small effects found when comparing\ncancer survivors overall with the noncancer group,\nlarger effects were found when the comparisons were\nmade across treatment status. Being in treatment for\nlung carcinoma only or in treatment for more than\none type of cancer had the most negative effect on\nquality of life. The general pattern showed the highest\nMOS SF-36 scores for individuals without cancer, fol-\nlowed by those not in treatment for breast, colorectal,\nlung, or prostate carcinoma; only prostate in treat-\nment; only breast in treatment; only colorectal in\ntreatment; treatment for more than one type of can-\ncer; and only lung in treatment. For all 10 MOS SF-36\nscales, being in treatment either for lung carcinoma\nonly or for more than one type of cancer resulted in\nstatistically significantly poorer HRQOL. Moderate or\nlarge effects were found for all 10 MOS SF-36 scores\nwhen comparing those in treatment for lung carci-\nnoma only with the noncancer group. For those in\ntreatment for more than one of the four cancers, mod-\nerate or large effects were found for all 10 MOS SF-36\nscales except for the BPS, which showed a small effect.\nThese data show that the severity and range of effects\nof particular types of cancer and the varied treatments\noffered for various cancer sites produce different ef-\nfects on HRQOL. However, the development of several\nmalignancies is particularly difficult for patients. Hav-\ning to fight cancer on several different fronts poses a\ncascade of complex HRQOL challenges.\nPrevious studies employing the MOS SF-36 have\nfound that older age groups (particularly 75 and older)\nshow lower scores on the eight scales of the MOS\n75 and older group in this study had significantly\nnoteworthy that even in the 75 and above age group,\nthose with a cancer history continued to have signifi-\ncantly lower scores than the noncancer group.\nThere are some limitations to using the MOS\nSF-36 to describe the HRQOL of cancer patients. Its\nstrength in being a generic measure that can be used\nto assess functional outcomes across many medical\nconditions, both acute and chronic, as well as with\nhealthy populations, also provides a limitation. It does\nnot include data on domains that measure the specific\neffects of particular diseases such as cancer and its\nvarious treatments. Therefore, it does not reveal as\nmuch as one might like in terms of well delineated\nareas for intervention.\nHowever, the MOS SF-36 as it is included in the\nMHOS offers important and relevant data for those\nconcerned with planning, evaluating, and improving\ncancer policy and programs. Because the MHOS was\nrepeated again after 2 years with this 1998 cohort,\nwhen data are available for analysis, changes in scores\nmay also reveal patterns of interest to program plan-\nners. Furthermore, the continued administration of\nthe MHOS to new cohorts each year will provide data\nthat may be useful in tracking changes in HRQOL\nrelated to the efforts of the ACS and its partners to\nimprove the quality of life of cancer survivors over the\nREFERENCES\n1.
