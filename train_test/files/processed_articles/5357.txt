    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe present article provides an overview of the best-selling apps for the age range of\n0\u00ad8 years under various categories, including `Kids', `Books', `Educational games',\n`Family games' and `Word games' in the two major application stores (Google Play\nand iTunes App Store) in four economically diverse European countries: Hungary,\nTurkey, Greece and the Netherlands. As tablets seem to be a substantial part of chil-\ndren's leisure activities, and thus apps might play an important role in their development,\nwe conducted a content analysis to highlight two issues: the educational value of the\nmost popular children's apps and the fine-tuning of apps to the local culture and lan-\nguage of non-English speaking countries. There is a large overlap between the best-\nselling apps in the four countries; in fact, half of the apps appear among the most popular\nlists in more than one country. Consequently, most children's apps do not include any\noral language and, if they do, they are not available in the local language. Furthermore,\nthe results show that a substantial part of the apps supported early literacy skills. In the\nmajority of apps teaching literacy, although advertised for the youngest, the focus of\ninstruction was more suited for school-age children.\n",

Tablets have also started to find their way into children's\ndaily life more and more (Chiong and Shuler, 2010). Common Sense Media,\na nonprofit organization, reports that 80% of children aged 2 to 10 in the U.S.\nuse educational media that are offered on TV and computer and mobile\ndevices at least once a week, including about one-third of children who use\nthem daily (Rideout, 2014). In the Netherlands, the ownership of tablets had\nat an increasingly younger age. In 2014, 70% of Dutch children up to age 7\nwere reported to use tablets often (Iene Meine Media, 2014). Tablet usage\nseems to be a substantial part of children's leisure activities, and thus the apps\nthey use may play an important role in their development. At the same time,\nwe have very little data regarding the language and content of those apps.\nConsequently, it is of great importance to assess the apps that children spend\ntime with in order to make an educated guess about the impact tablet usage\nmay have on children's development and advise developers, educators and\npolicymakers. We expect similar growth in tablet usage in the three other\ntarget countries of the present study but reports about children's use of com-\nputer and mobile devices are not available for Greece, Turkey and Hungary.\nPotential of apps as an educational activity\nWith more than one million apps available for IOS and Android devices and\nthe fact that the vast majority in the Education category target children, it is of\nthe utmost importance to examine the type of content that young children are\nengaging with (Lauricella et al., 2017). Even though apps may provide an\nactive, enjoyable and engaging context, the question is whether they are\nattuned to children's educational needs: Do popular apps offer opportunities\nto foster children's emergent academic skills, including language, literacy,\nnumeracy and science? For playing a role in language development, the min-\nimum seems to be that they include oral language, preferably the first lan-\nguage of young children. There are, however, popular app series like Toca\nBoca that do not include any language. There is only nonverbal information in\nthese apps, probably in order to expand the market.\nFurthermore, there is an abundance of studies indicating that young chil-\ndren show an interest in academic skills and develop those skills through\nvarious voluntary activities in the preschool period (e.g. Duncan et al.,\n2 Journal of Early Childhood Literacy 0(0)\n(1996), for instance, gives numerous examples of activities in the home\nenvironment that include literacy skills and that contribute to emergent liter-\nacy. To mention some, parents and teachers read storybooks to children,\nwhich improves their vocabulary and comprehension skills (Bus et al.,\n1995); children of preschool and kindergarten age practise writing their\nnames and other words which may contribute to letter knowledge and phon-\nemic awareness (Both-de Vries and Bus, 2010); children count objects in their\nsurroundings which may foster number skills (LeFevre et al., 2009); and so\non. Apps, if well-designed, may have the potential to elicit similar activities in\nthe age range of 0\u00ad8 and give a boost to early literacy and numeracy skills.\nThey may even have the potential to involve the child in these activities with-\nout any adult support because they provide guidance and feedback that is\nIn fact, technology, if well designed, may have an advantage over traditional\nlearning materials. Apps have the potential to include nonverbal information\nthat may, if congruent with the verbal content, including a story, numbers\nor letters, to facilitate learning in accordance with multimedia learning\n(Mayer, 2003). For instance, in a recent review, digital storybooks with non-\nverbal representations of the story, in addition to narration, were found to be\nmore facilitative of story comprehension and word-learning than traditional\npaper storybooks (Bus et al., 2015). However, unlike research on digital pic-\nture storybooks, where studies have explored whether and how the multi-\nmedia additions of e-books affect young children's learning, only a few\nstudies have investigated other types or features of apps to test their effects\non children's learning (Lauricella et al., 2017).\nThe aim of the current study was to test available apps as an auxiliary to\ntraditional playful activities that promote early skills in the language, literacy\nand mathematics domains. As a minimum, we propose that the majority of\napps should expose young children to language, and preferably the local\nlanguage, as one of the best predictors for academic success (Morgan et al.,\n2015). There are quite a few apps that enable activities, like cutting, decorat-\ning, cooking dishes or using make-up, designed to replicate aspects of chil-\ndren's free play on digital devices (Lauricella et al., 2017). Although these\napps do not include any language, they are promoted as `educational' in\nonline stores (e.g. Toca Boca apps). As reported on the official website of\nToca Boca, these applications may improve `children's creativity' (Toca\nBoca, n.d.). This and other app series are quite famous and rank high on\nSari et al. 3\nthe best-selling lists, but the question arises: Are they an auxiliary in addition\nto traditional activities in early childhood, like drawing, writing and\ndramatizing?\nIn line with findings by the Joan Ganz Cooney Center, we expect that a sub-\nstantial part of apps (about 40%) will provide educational content related to basic\nacademic skills, and probably more to literacy than to maths and science, as\nchildren overall spend more time with literacy-related activities in daily life\n(Vaala et al., 2015). However, whether findings from the American market\napply to the European market is, so far, an unanswered question. We also\nwonder whether popular apps available in main stores include language, in par-\nticular the local language, thus promoting language skills as a critical aspect of\npreschool development. This question seems particularly relevant in countries\nthat represent relatively small languages (Simons and Fennig, 2017). Compared\nto English, spoken by 955 million people, Dutch (20 million speakers),\nHungarian (10 million speakers), Turkish (80 million speakers) and Greek (11\nmillion speakers) are small languages. Without localized content, apps can be\npromoted in more countries without the costs of translation and localization.\nHowever, bringing out apps in such a way that they can be sold in different\ncountries makes sense from a commercial point of view but may be at the\nexpense of fine-tuning to a specific culture and the local language.\nThis study\nThe two major international online application stores, the App Store (iOS) and\nthe Google Play Store (Android), increasingly offer more apps including\ngames and digital storybooks specifically designed for children (Guernsey\net al., 2012). In every country, it is possible to download all available apps\nin all languages, but a somewhat different set of featured apps appears when\nyou enter the store. The aim of the present study was, apart from an inventory\nof the most popular available apps in four European countries, to be a test of\nthe overlap between the lists of the most popular children's apps across\nEuropean countries and what the consequences are. When apps rank high\non best-selling lists in different countries they may not include the local\nlanguage, especially when the language area is small, as is the case for the\ncountries included in the present study. This omission is of high significance\nbecause, considering the amount of time that young children spend with\nmobile devices, this may be a missed opportunity for language development\nas compared to other common activities (e.g. watching educational\ntelevision).\n4 Journal of Early Childhood Literacy 0(0)\nThe number of apps available in the local language may differ as a result of fine-\ntuning, which might be related to prosperity. This could be another illustration of\nthe finding that the quality of educational materials differs, at the expense of\nchildren growing up in less wealthy circumstances (Putnam, 2015). In order to\ntest this hypothesis, we compared lists of the most popular children's apps in four\nEuropean countries with relatively small languages and differing prosperity:\nHungary, Turkey, Greece and the Netherlands. Among the most popular apps\nin the Netherlands, the most prosperous country of the four, we may expect more\napps in the local language than in the other countries.\nIn sum, in the present content analysis of the most popular children's\napplications in four European countries we aimed to answer the following\nquestions:\n1. Are apps available in the local language, and more so in more prosperous\ncountries?\nBased on our impressions when familiarizing with the app stores' selections\nof children's apps, we hypothesized that there is a significant overlap between\nthe best-selling apps in the different countries. Consequently, we expected\nthat most apps were developed by international companies, and accordingly,\nthe majority of apps do not include any oral language and/or are not available\nin the local language. This is of high significance as such an omission\nmeans that applications do not provide any stimulation in the local\nlanguage, which is a serious issue for the language development of children\nof preschool age and for their emerging academic skills that are founded in\nlanguage skills.\nFurthermore, we expected more apps in the local language on the Dutch\nmarket as compared to the other three countries; GDP (Gross Domestic\nProducts) per capita for Greece, Turkey and Hungary ranges between 20\nand US$ 26,000, but it is about twice as high in the Netherlands (World\n2. To what extent do apps serve educational aims?\nIn line with previous results regarding the U.S. market (Guernsey et al.,\n2012), we expected that a substantial part of the best-selling apps would not\nserve purely as entertainment for children but would have some educational\nSari et al. 5\ncontent. Insofar as apps are educational, they are expected to relate more often\nto literacy than to other academic skills and are mainly developed for children\nof preschool age rather than for school-age children.\nMethod\nSample of apps\nPopular online stores offer apps for children under various categories.\nAccording to the scope of our study, we selected from the two main app\nstores' categories that might include educational apps for children. In the\niTunes App Store, we targeted: Kids, Books, Education, Educational Games, Word\nGames and Family Games. In Google Play, we focused on Books and References,\nEducation, Family Games, Word Games and Educational Games. We took a screen shot\nof the top 50 best-selling paid and the top 50 most downloaded free apps in\neach category on the same day for the Dutch, Turkish and Hungarian markets\n(23 March 2015). The same procedure was applied to the best-selling lists in\napps were included in one package in the paid section of the iTunes App Store\nas a bundle deal. We decided to include all those apps.\nWe focused on the top 50. The exact ranking in each category\nseems to change daily, but apps may stay for a longer period among\nthe top 50. About a quarter of the apps were still on the best-selling lists\none-and-half years after the first downloads. The numbers of the same apps\nwere 22%, 30% and 25% for the Netherlands, Turkey and Hungary, respect-\nWe excluded any apps that were not designed for children, such as foreign\nlanguage learning apps (e.g. Duolingo), word games, dictionaries, adult audio\nbooks, e-book readers, holy books (e.g. Bible, Quran), sky observation\napps, topology apps etc. When the same apps appeared in different categories,\nwe excluded duplicates. However, if the same app appeared in both stores,\nAndroid and iOS, both apps were included because the two versions are\nnot necessarily the same. In the end, we analysed 560 Dutch, 492\nHungarian, 532 Greek and 494 Turkish apps for children found in the\nAndroid and iOS stores.\nCoding\nEach app was coded on the basis of the specifications explained below.\nTo make all oral language and educational content manifest we applied very\n6 Journal of Early Childhood Literacy 0(0)\nminimal requirements to apps that were coded as including oral language or\napps that were considered as including educational content.\n1. General characteristics\n1.1. Overlap across countries: We coded for each app if it was unique on the best-\nselling list of the country or also appeared on the list of any of the other\ncountries.\n1.2. Device: We coded the app store where we found the app: iTunes (IOS) and/or\nGoogle Play Store (Android).\n1.3. Developer: We coded whether the company that developed the app was a local or\nan international developer.\n1.4. Age range: We coded if the app was recommended in the app store for infants\n(0\u00ad3 years old), preschool/kindergarten (4\u00ad6 years old) or children in pri-\nmary education (6\u00ad12 years old).\n1.5. Price of the app: We coded the price of every paid application in euros. If it was\npart of a bundle we divided the price by the number of apps in the bundle.\n2. Oral language\nWe coded whether the app contained any oral language (at least 5 words)\nor not.\n2.1. Availability of oral language in the local language: We coded whether the apps that con-\ntained oral language used the local language or a foreign language. Sometimes,\nthe title of the apps was in the local language but the app itself in a foreign\nlanguage, mostly English. In these cases, we coded the language as a foreign\nlanguage.\n3. Educational content: We coded whether an app included any content that was\nrelevant for basic academic skills, i.e. language, literacy, maths or science. In any\nother cases, we coded the app as just entertaining. Some of the most popular apps\noffer nonverbal games such as driving, cooking and decorating, we coded these as\npurely entertaining. Other apps that we considered purely entertaining typically\nincluded dressing-up and make-up games, activities like taking care of a pet or a\nbaby, or decorating cakes or a room. Apps from the Toca Boca Company let chil-\ndren explore areas such as rooms, groceries and restaurants; see for instance Toca\nLife: Town. The app is designed to be played without any instructions, dialogue,\nnarrative or feedback. On the other hand, puzzles, storybooks and games that\nrelate to basic academic skills, including counting (e.g. Lola's Math Train), com-\nparing (Monkey Preschool: Fix it) and sorting (Monkey Math School Sunshine),\nSari et al. 7\nwere coded as educational. LetterSchool is an example of an educational app that\nfocuses on literacy skills. Children practise hand-writing letters and numbers in an\nengaging and interactive way. We did not code the quality of instruction or feed-\nback offered preceding or during assignments.\n3.1. Literacy content: We coded whether the educational content of an app was\nrelevant for language and literacy development or not. We considered narra-\ntive stories in addition to games and activities identifying sounds or letter\nforms, teaching vocabulary and letter-sound relationships or practising emer-\ngent writing as related to language and literacy. The apps that contained\nnarratives were mostly digital versions of existing print books (Dr. Seuss's\nABC; Frozen: Storybooks Deluxe).\n3.1.1. Direct/indirect literacy content: We coded whether literacy skills were taught dir-\nectly (e.g. games with words, letters and the alphabet) or indirectly by means\nof stories and nursery rhymes. Apps with a mix of the two approaches were\ncoded as indirect because mixed apps typically had a main focus on\nstorytelling.\nInter-coder agreement\nThe top 10 apps in all categories in the Dutch iTunes App Store were coded by\ntwo independent coders in order to calculate inter-coder reliability statistics.\nCoding these apps, Cohen's kappa was satisfactory for all categories:\n(k > 0.78) whether the app was designed for children (k \u00bc 0.97), whether\nit was educational (k \u00bc 0.78), whether it was relevant for children's literacy\ndevelopment (k \u00bc 0.82), whether it taught literacy skills in a direct or an\nindirect manner (k \u00bc 0.78), and whether the content of the app was available\nin the local language or only in another foreign language like English\n(k \u00bc 1.0). The findings were very similar for the three other countries\nwhere agreements between coders were also checked. All disagreements\nwere settled by discussion between the two coders.\nResults and discussion\nAs shown in Table 1, there were similar numbers of apps on the best-selling\nlists that we coded as intended for children in the four countries: about 500 in\neach country. Somewhat more than half of these children's apps (on average\n55%) were found in the iTunes App Store. Most apps were advertised for the\nyoungest age groups, i.e. for infants and preschoolers, and less so for school-\naged children. This was similar in all four countries. It should also be noted\n8 Journal of Early Childhood Literacy 0(0)\nTable 1.

For educational applications, this might be\nproblematic as it is unlikely that what is educational for a toddler is also\neducational for a 5-year-old.\nFine-tuning to local language and culture\nOverall, only 43% of the children's applications included oral language.\nHungary having the smallest percentage of applications including any oral\nlanguage (36%) and Turkey the largest percentage (47%). On average, only\n27% of the apps included oral language in the local language. Regarding\nlocal language speaking apps, there were significant differences between\ncountry, the Netherlands, there were by far the most apps in the local language\non the best-selling lists (50%), while in Hungary only 10% of the apps were\nin the local language. In the same vein, overall, 10% of the apps were released\nby local developers. There were significant differences between countries (2\nDutch best-selling lists (18%) and the least on the Hungarian list (5%).\nAs expected, there were substantial overlaps between the best-selling lists of\nthe four countries: half of the children's apps appeared on the list of two or\nmore countries, as shown in Table 1. There was a significant effect of country\nunique titles in Greece (56%) and the Netherlands (49%), as compared to\n34% in Hungary and 41% in Turkey. As a consequence of substantial overlaps,\none might expect that apps that are intended for the markets of more coun-\ntries would either have no oral language or, insofar as there is language, it not\nto be in the local language.\nIn fact, we found evidence for these hypotheses. As shown in Table 2, there\nwere no differences between overlapping and unique titles in the numbers of\napps that included oral language (2 (1) \u00bc 0.45, p \u00bc.50). However, when we\nonly considered apps that included oral language there were many more\nunique apps featuring the local oral language (85%), as compared to over-\nthat were uniquely popular in one country were developed by a local devel-\np <.001. In other words, unique apps more often offered on the iOS platform\n10 Journal of Early Childhood Literacy 0(0)\nthan on Android were more fine-tuned to a specific culture and the local\nlanguage. It is tempting to attribute these differences between countries to\ndifferences between the countries' prosperity, but these results might reflect\neither the preferences of parents and educators (there were apps in the local\nlanguage but those were not chosen), the availability of such applications\n(apps in the local language were not available) or both.\nApps serving emergent academic skills\nSimilar to the results of the American content analysis (Guernsey and Levine,\n2015), 37% of the best-selling apps were categorized as educational regarding\nbasic academic skills, meaning that 63% of the most popular apps were coded\nas purely entertaining. There were significant differences between countries\nappearing on the Dutch best-selling lists (45%) and the lowest percentage on\nthe Hungarian list (30%). More educational apps were recommended for\npreschool-age children (72%, n \u00bc 339) as compared to apps advised for\nschool-age children (n \u00bc 113). This finding was similar for all four countries.\nCountry-specific popular apps were more likely to be educational (45%) than\noverlapping apps on the best-selling lists of more than one country (31%), 2\nTable 2. Differences between apps that are unique titles for one country\nand apps that are on the best-selling lists in two or more countries.\nUnique Overlapping Difference\nM\n(SD)\nM\nable in the local language and whether it was categorized as educational was\nhighly confounded in all four countries (the Netherlands: 2 (1) \u00bc 26.19,\nwere in the local language in the four countries were educational. This makes\nsense as letter sounds, and similar topics in educational apps, differ across\ncountries.\nWhen considering educational apps, about 72% of the apps were relevant\nfor children's language and literacy development. There were, again, signifi-\nthe largest proportion of literacy-related apps in Greece (80%) and the smal-\nlest percentage in the Netherlands (64%). This also means that the largest\nproportion of maths and science apps appeared on the Dutch best-selling lists.\nWithin the category of literacy apps, 34% taught literacy skills in a direct\nmanner. Most of these apps targeted teaching letters, spelling words, iden-\ntifying phonemes in words and the like. The rest of the literacy apps included\nstories instead of or in addition to the direct teaching of basic literacy skills. It\nis doubtful that direct practice of basic literacy skills (e.g. letter knowledge,\nphoneme awareness) matches the interests of children of preschool age.\nwith the smallest percentage of apps directly teaching basic literacy skills on\nthe Greek best-selling lists (19%) and the largest on the Dutch list (44%).\nIt might be that there are fewer Greek apps because international literacy apps\nare not useful due to the Greek alphabet. The data support this hypothesis;\noverall, 50% of the literacy apps were international, while this applied to only\nMain conclusions and future directions\nOverall, the results of this first inventory of popular apps are not very promis-\ning. One consequence of the huge overlap in popular apps across countries\n(55%) is that most apps are not designed by local developers, which may have\nserious consequences for their content. They may, for instance, not include\nlocal characters, typical visualizations and local language, thus preserving the\ncultural heritage and fostering children's developing language and literacy\nskills. In the current study, we tested whether the set of apps that is available\nin more than one country is less fine-tuned to children. We were particularly\ninterested in the language: do apps make use of the local language? We found\n12 Journal of Early Childhood Literacy 0(0)\nthat the majority of apps that are on the lists of popular apps in more than one\ncountry and that include language are not available in the local language\n(75%). This is a serious issue, particularly when we consider that children\nspend an increasing amount of time with apps each year. The effect is stronger\nthe less prosperous a country is. This finding is even more shocking when we\nconsider the very lenient criterion applied in the present study, which was at\nleast five spoken words with no restrictions on whether it is in a complete\nsentence or whether these words go beyond the most basic vocabulary, like\n`hi' and `good' (E.g. Dr. Panda: Restaurant). The finding that many apps for\nyoung children do not contain any language might be explained by consider-\ning the ease of adaptation of the apps to other countries. Apps without any\nlanguage can be easily offered in all countries without the additional cost of\ntranslating them. Although this makes sense from a commercial point of view,\nit is a loss from an educational perspective, as these apps provide no language\ninput for young children. In comparison, even television programming that is\nnot educational or designed for children includes oral language and thus\nprovides language stimulation.\nAbout 30\u00ad40% of the popular apps are educational according to our\ndefinition: they included some task that is related to emergent literacy, numer-\nacy and science. This is not a change compared to the pre-computer era:\nSince the seminal work of Ferreiro and Teberosky (1982), we are aware\nthat preschoolers spend substantial amounts of time on practising academic\nskills. It is a reaction to the fact that adults are continuously modelling aca-\ndemic skills and children respond to that by showing interest in doing the\nsame activities and making attempts to imitate. We do not yet know whether\neducational apps outweigh the benefits of traditional activities that relate to\nacademic skills and what the long-term effects are when apps are an auxiliary\nin addition to traditional activities.\nIn line with Hisrich and Blanchard (2009), our findings suggest that\nfew quality apps are available for emergent literacy skills \u00ad even with a very\nminimal criterion. Activities promoted by educational apps often include\nassignments that are not age-appropriate. Many apps advertised for pre-\nschoolers utilize direct teaching, e.g. letter training by making children\nclick on the letter that matches the name, while it is doubtful that this kind\nof practice matches the interest of children in that age range. According to\nemergent literacy research, children in this age range do show some interest\nin reading and writing, but in a different way. From the research, it can be\nderived that when, for instance, they make attempts to write they are more\ninterested in `drawing' writing: they often produce writing-like scribbles or\nstrings of pseudo letters and they mix writing with drawing (Levin and Bus,\n2003). More in-depth content analysis is needed to test whether apps reflect\nsuch interests. However, from what we have seen, it is our impression that\namong the popular educational apps there are no apps promoting this kind of\nage-appropriate writing and reading activities. Note that computer programs\nlike Kid Pix that came out in the 1980s to elicit writing and reading activities by\nyoung children are no longer available (see Labbo's 1996 description of the\nprograms). It is more common to practise school-like subskills of reading and\nwriting. The echoes of thirty years of research on emergent literacy and numer-\nacy do not seem to reach the domain of educational apps, perhaps because the\ndevelopment of apps is the exclusive domain of computer experts and designers\nand does not include educators or educational experts. This might provide an\nexplanation for previous findings showing an ambiguous effect of tablet use on\nchildren's emergent literacy skills (Neumann, 2014).\nIn sum. Our findings align with what Guernsey et al. (2012) describe as the `fast\nevolving and chaotic Wild West of digital apps', and we gave some explanations\nfor this. In As regards exposure to children's first language, the situation seems\neven more worrisome in countries with a small language base. Many apps are\ndeveloped without oral language, probably to expand the market for the apps. As\na result of that, about 60% of all apps do not include any oral language and, if they\ndo include oral language, they are not available in the local language, while\nlanguage input is abundantly available in most alternative activities for children\nin early childhood. Another trend is that many popular apps targeting educational\nissues are recommended for a far too broad age range between 0 and 5 years.\nMany apps offer direct training in basic literacy skills including phonics/word\nrecognition and sounding out letters \u00ad all activities that are not developmentally\nappropriate for the youngest children between 0 and 4 years of age. The advan-\ntage of apps is that they are cheap and easily accessible, also for children growing\nup in less wealthy circumstances but, unfortunately, the quality of educational\nmaterials is mostly not satisfying, at the expense of those children most in need of\nstimulating materials.\nLimitations\nThe long lists of best-selling or most downloaded apps indicate how popular\napps are. The exact rankings seem to change daily. However, after several\nattempts, we could not figure out how the best-selling lists are constructed\nand which underlying parameters are considered. For instance, it is not known\n14 Journal of Early Childhood Literacy 0(0)\nexactly how many downloads are behind the rankings. Furthermore, a ranking\nmight change at the exact time when someone downloads an app or the ranking\nmay be based on daily or weekly data. Additionally, the high overlap between\ncountries might be a result of how the lists are constructed: it might be that it is\nnot only local sales that affect the rankings on best-selling lists. Also, we do not\nknow how the lists relate to what is available in the stores. For different reasons,\nthere may be few popular apps in the local language: these apps may not be\nselected or they may not be available. Likewise, the low percentage of apps with\neducational content can be both a result of availability and/or the preferences of\nparents and educators. As reported in the study, 72% of the apps are suggested\nfor children between 0 and 6 years old. However, for 51% of the apps, no\nrecommendation regarding the age of the audience was available. Additionally,\nthe downloading of the Greek list was not done at the same time as the other\ndownloads, which probably resulted in an underestimation of the overlap\nbetween the best-selling lists of Greece and the other countries. Finally, our\ncriteria for oral language and educational content in the apps were set low (e.g.\nincluding at least five spoken words to qualify for an app with oral language).\nThe results, however, justified this decision because even with such a lenient\nyardstick a shockingly small percentage of apps qualified as apps with oral\nlanguage and/or educational content. Still, we did not differentiate at the\nother end of the spectrum and have no information about the number of\nhigh quality educational apps.\nAuthor's note\nAdriana G Bus is also affiliated to Eo\n\u00a8tvo\n\u00a8s Lora\n\u00b4nd University, Hungary.\n"
