Respondents aged 40\u00ad55 years were randomly selected\nfrom seven geographic locations in the United States for the 1996\u00ad1997 cross-sectional survey of the Study of\nWomen's Health Across the Nation, a longitudinal, observational study of the menopause transition.\nRespondents rated their activity level as much less, less, the same as, more, or much more than other women\ntheir age. Physical activity rating varied minimally by race/ethnicity. The proportions of women who rated\nthemselves much less active and much more active ranged from 3.1% for Whites to 4.8% for Japanese and from\n13.6% for Japanese to 16.4% for African Americans, respectively. Multiple logistic regression models, stratified\nby race/ethnicity, showed independent associations between a low level of activity and higher body mass index,\npoor health, functional impairment, perceived stress, difficulty sleeping, and not being employed. A high level of\nactivity was associated with excellent health, single marital status, higher education, lower body mass index, and\nolder age.

In the broadest sense, physical\nactivity refers to any bodily movement produced by skeletal\nmuscles that results in energy expenditure (1). As with other\ncomplex behaviors, such as dietary intake, physical activity\nis difficult to measure. Over the past decade, developments\nin the methodology of physical activity assessment have\nparalleled increased interest in understanding the role of\nphysical activity in disease prevention and health promotion\n(2, 3). Methods of direct measurement, such as accelerome-\nters, have become more sophisticated, practical, and valid\n(4, 5), and survey methods have expanded to include a wider\nrange of activities relevant to both men and women (6), to\nolder persons (7), and to diverse racial and ethnic groups\n(8). However, single, global activity questions that ask for\nan overall assessment of activity level rather than about par-\nticipation in specific activities or categories of activity are\nstill desirable, particularly for studies in which physical\nactivity is not the main variable of interest, and participant\nburden and investigator expense are major concerns.\nA number of studies have found that global questions can\nbe used to rank people roughly by activity level and to dif-\nferentiate those who participate in vigorous exercise from\nthose who do not (9\u00ad12). However, the relatively low corre-\nlations between global questions and more detailed assess-\nments of activity suggest that respondents may use different\nconstructs for responding to these two types of activity mea-\nsures. To date, little is known about how people translate\ntheir specific behavior into the general concept of physical\nactivity level. This problem is exacerbated when a global\nquestion is used in a racially and ethnically diverse popula-\ntion in which the meaning and value of physical activity\nmay not be commonly shared.\nThe purpose of the present study was to compare\nresponses to a global physical activity question in a large,\ncommunity-based sample of midlife African-American,\nChinese, Hispanic, Japanese, and White women and to\nexamine the correlates of high and low rating of activity\nwithin and across the different racial/ethnic groups.\nSpecifically, this study examined the race-/ethnic-specific\nrelation between a comparative self-rating of physical activ-\nity and demographic and health status variables known or\nhypothesized to be associated with varying levels of activity\nin the population to evaluate whether this global question\nappears to measure the same construct in different ethnic\ngroups.\nGlobal Assessment of Physical Activity in Women 679\nStudy sample\nAs part of the Study of Women's Health Across the\ngraphic areas of the United States were interviewed by tele-\nphone, or infrequently in person (about 10 percent of the\ntotal sample, limited to those sampling units for which tele-\nphone numbers could not be determined), to provide cross-\nsectional data on the health status of midlife women and to\nscreen for eligibility for the prospective cohort study.\nSampling of women, described in detail in Sowers et al.\n(13), was based on either random digit dialing or list-based\nsampling frames; one of four specific racial/ethnic commu-\nnities was oversampled at each site (African Americans in\nBoston, Massachusetts; Chicago, Illinois; the Detroit area of\nMichigan; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Chinese in\nOakland, California; Hispanics in Newark, New Jersey; and\nJapanese in Los Angeles, California). In addition, all seven\nof the sites surveyed a random sample of White women. The\nsampling strategies were designed to produce a study sam-\nple that was racially/ethnically and socioeconomically\ndiverse and representative of the various communities from\nwhich the samples were drawn. The overall response rate,\ncalculated by adding to the denominator of known eligibles\na proportion of sampling units with unknown eligibility\nassumed to be eligible, was 46.6 percent and varied by site\nfrom a low of 29.6 percent to a high of 73.7 percent, largely\nreflecting differences in sampling frames. Although, as dis-\ncussed by Sowers et al., the relatively low response rates at\nsome sites may limit generalizability, the sampling strate-\ngies for the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation\nsuccessfully achieved a socioeconomically diverse sample\nbroadly representative of five major racial/ethnic groups in\nthe United States (13).\nthe present analysis. Reasons for exclusion included missing\nphysical activity data (n  501); mixed race/ethnicity,\nrace/ethnicity other than the five purposely sampled, or no\nspecified race/ethnicity (n  426); pregnant at the time of\nthe interview or no menstrual period in the prior 12 months\nbecause of pregnancy or lactation (n  391); and self-\nreported diagnosis of myocardial infarction or angina (n \n431). In addition, women who reported severe functional\nlimitation, defined as \"a lot of difficulty\" with walking one\nflight of stairs, walking one block, or bathing (n  695),\nwere excluded since they generally tended to rate them-\nselves at the lowest end of the activity spectrum (39 vs. 6.1\npercent in the sample as a whole). After exclusions, 13,621\nwomen remained in the sample.\nAssessment of physical activity and other covariates\nPhysical activity was assessed in the cross-sectional sur-\nvey by using a single global question that asked women to\nrate their level of physical activity as much less, less, the\nsame as, more, or much more than other women their age.\nThis comparative self-rating of activity has been used in a\nnumber of previous population-based surveys, including the\n1985 National Health Interview Survey Health Promotion/\nDisease Prevention Supplement, in which a more detailed\ncriterion method of measuring activity was also included in\norder to evaluate the validity of this and other global activ-\nity questions (11). In that data set, the overall Spearman's\ncorrelation coefficient between the more detailed measure\nof energy expenditure and the comparative rating of activity\n0.23 for those aged more than 75 years. Although these cor-\nrelations are relatively weak, they are comparable to the cor-\nrelations observed between other global measures and more\nextensive physical activity assessments (14).\nAlthough the comparative activity question is a standard\none used in studies of English-speaking populations, to our\nknowledge it has not been used previously with non-\nEnglish-speaking people. Since the sample for the Study of\nWomen's Health Across the Nation included women who\nspoke Cantonese, Japanese, and Spanish, the entire cross-\nsectional survey, including the physical activity question,\nwas translated into these three languages and then back-\ntranslated into English to ensure the accuracy of the transla-\ntions. The back-translation of the original Cantonese activ-\nity question revealed that the meaning had been altered from\nthe concept of physical activity to physical strength.\nTherefore, only the responses from those Chinese-speaking\nwomen who were interviewed after the translation of the\nactivity question was corrected were included in the present\nanalysis; the responses of those interviewed prior to that\npoint (n  63) were set to missing, accounting for 12.6 per-\ncent of the 501 women for whom activity data were missing.\nThe independent variables of primary interest for this\nanalysis included seven demographic factors and 10 self-\nreported indicators of health status; standard questions from\nprevious population-based surveys were used wherever pos-\nsible. For this analysis, the demographic variables were cat-\n2) education: high school graduate or less/more than high\nschool graduate; 3) marital status: married or living as mar-\nried/not married, including single, widowed, separated, or\ndivorced; 4) number of children: none/one or two/three or\nmore; 5) employment status: working for pay outside the\nhome (either full-time or part-time)/not working; 6) ability\nto pay for basic family needs: very difficult/somewhat\ndifficult/not at all difficult; and 7) interview language, a\ncrude marker of acculturation.\nThe 10 indicators of health status were categorized as fol-\nlows: 1) overall self-reported health: excellent or very good/\ngood/fair or poor; 2) overall quality of life indicated on a 10-\npoint scale, with higher indicating better quality: seven or\nless/eight or more; 3) number of diagnosed medical condi-\ntions (high blood pressure, osteoporosis, fibroids, cancer,\ndiabetes): none/one or more; 4) number of symptoms expe-\nrienced during the previous 2 weeks (hot flashes; night\nsweats; forgetfulness; irritability; feeling blue or depressed;\nfeeling tense or nervous; vaginal dryness; leaking urine;\npounding or racing heart; stiff or sore joints, neck, or shoul-\nders; headaches): three or less/four or more; 5) difficulty\nsleeping during the previous 2 weeks: yes/no; 6) perceived\nstress level based on Cohen et al.'s four-item perceived\nstress scale (15), with a higher score indicating greater\nstress: eight or less/more than eight; 7) any functional limi-\ntation, defined as any limitation on activity due to impair-\nment or health problems: yes/no; 8) a five-level menopausal\nstatus variable: premenopause and early perimenopause (at\nleast one menstrual cycle within the previous 3 months with\nor without change in regularity)/late perimenopause (no\nperiod for 3\u00ad12 months)/postmenopause (no period for\nmore than 12 months)/surgical menopause (hysterectomy\nand/or bilateral oophorectomy)/hormone user (current use\nof hormones with undetermined status); 9) smoking status:\ncurrent smoker/not current smoker; and 10) body mass\nindex (BMI), calculated as weight in kilograms divided by\nheight in meters squared, from self-reported height and\nweight.\nStatistical analysis\nThe distributions of all independent variables, except\nBMI, were examined across the five-level physical activity\nrating by using proportions and were evaluated with the chi-\nsquare statistic. For BMI, which was treated as a continuous\nvariable, means and standard deviations were calculated by\nactivity level, and differences were evaluated by using\nanalysis of variance. Similar descriptive and analytical sta-\ntistics were used to examine the associations between\nrace/ethnicity and the other independent variables.\nBecause the correlates of a low level of activity may not\nbe merely the inverse of the correlates of a high level of\nactivity, separate logistic regression analyses, stratified by\nracial/ethnic group, were used to examine two distinct sets\nof relations: 1) the associations between the independent\nvariables and a reported low activity level relative to an\naverage activity level (the same as one's peers) and 2) the\nassociations between the independent variables and a\nreported high activity level relative to an average activity\nlevel. Average activity level was selected as the reference\ncategory to focus on sedentary behavior on the one hand and\na highly active lifestyle on the other. Initially, only the\nextreme levels of activity (1 vs. 3, 5 vs. 3) were modeled.\nHowever, because small sample sizes in these extreme cate-\ngories limited the statistical power, particularly for the\nChinese and Japanese women, for whom the overall sample\nsizes were smaller, and because relations were similar when\ncategories 1 and 2 (much less and less activity than one's\npeers) and categories 4 and 5 (more and much more activ-\nity) were combined, all of the data presented here were\nbased on the combined categories.\nTo assess the independent associations between demo-\ngraphic factors and indicators of health status and a low or\nhigh level of activity, multivariable logistic regression mod-\nels included all variables that were statistically significant at\nthe p < 0.05 level in unadjusted analyses. Variables were then\nselected for final, race-/ethnic-specific multivariable models\nif they continued to show a statistically significant relation to\nthe outcome in that particular racial/ethnic group or in at\nleast three of the other racial/ethnic groups. The common\nvariables included in all of the final, race-/ethnic-specific\nmultivariable models were 1) BMI, overall health status, per-\nceived stress level, functional limitation, sleep problems, and\nemployment status for activity less than one's peers relative\nto average activity level and 2) BMI, overall health status,\nage, marital status, and education for activity more than one's\npeers relative to average activity level. These final models\nprovided race-/ethnic-specific estimates of the odds ratios\nand 95 percent confidence intervals associated with specific\ndemographic and health status variables. Goodness of fit of\neach model was examined by using the Hosmer-Lemeshow\ntest. All analyses were conducted with SAS software, version\n6.11 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina).\nRESULTS\nCharacteristics of the sample\nAs shown in table 1, the sample was almost equally\ndivided between Whites and other racial/ethnic groups, and\nslightly more than 40 percent of the women reported that\npaying for basics was very difficult or somewhat difficult.\nMore than a third had a high school education or less. The\nsample was relatively uniformly distributed within the spec-\nified age range (40\u00ad55 years), but more than half were either\npremenopausal or early perimenopausal. Although only 14\npercent rated their overall health as fair or poor, more than\nhalf reported one or more chronic medical conditions, and\nmore than a third reported difficulty sleeping.\nAll of the demographic characteristics and indicators of\nhealth status varied significantly by race/ethnicity (data not\nshown). For instance, only 38.3 percent of the Hispanic\nwomen had more than a high school education compared\nwith 79.8 percent of the Japanese women. Only 7.0 percent\nof the Whites considered their health to be fair or poor com-\npared with 31.4 percent of the Hispanics. In contrast, only\n7.9 percent of the Hispanics, but 15.8 percent of the Whites,\nreported any functional limitation. The Chinese group had\nthe lowest proportion of any diagnosed chronic condition\n(33.9 percent) and also the lowest proportion of current\nsmokers (2.2 percent), while African Americans had the\nDistribution of comparative rating of physical activity\nDespite the relatively large racial/ethnic differences in\ndemographic characteristics and indicators of health status,\nthe variations in rating of physical activity by race/ethnicity,\nalthough statistically significant, were slight (table 1).\nAmong those women who rated themselves as much less\nactive than their peers, the proportions only ranged from a\nlow of 3.1 percent of the Whites to 4.8 percent of the\nJapanese. At the high end, the proportion of women rating\nthemselves as much more active ranged from 13.6 percent\nof the Japanese to 16.4 percent of the African Americans, a\ndifference of only 2.8 percentage points. Somewhat more\nvariation existed in the proportions rating themselves as\nhaving the same level of activity as their peers; about 40 per-\ncent of the African Americans, Japanese, and Whites placed\nthemselves in that category compared with 45.3 percent of\nthe Chinese and 52.6 percent of the Hispanics.\nGlobal Assessment of Physical Activity in Women 681\nIn contrast, the magnitude of the variation in physical\nactivity rating by other demographic and health status vari-\nables was more notable (table 1). Only 1.5 percent of those\nwho considered their overall health to be excellent or very\ngood, but 12.2 percent of those rating their health as fair or\npoor, considered themselves much less active than their\npeers. Conversely, 20.3 percent of those who reported their\nhealth to be excellent or very good rated themselves as\nmuch more active than their peers compared with only 7.3\npercent of those reporting fair or poor health. Also, rela-\ntively more women with any functional limitation consid-\nered themselves much less active than those with no limita-\ntions (10.4 vs. 2.6 percent), while the opposite was true for\nthose rating themselves as much more active (9.8 percent of\nthose with vs. 16.2 percent of those without functional lim-\nitation). BMI declined steadily across the five activity cate-\ngories, from a mean of 31.8 kg/m2 at the low end to a mean\nEven when differences were not so pronounced, the\nrelations generally were in the expected direction. For\ninstance, a higher proportion of women with more than a\nhigh school education compared with women with less\neducation considered themselves much more active (16.9\nreported being much more active compared with 11.6 per-\ncent of those not working. Similarly, women with a high\nquality of life and lower stress levels were overrepre-\nsented in the higher activity categories, while those with a\nlower quality of life and more stress were overrepresented\nin the lower categories. Only menopausal status and\nsmoking status showed little relation to physical activity\nrating.\nIndependent correlates of activity less than one's peers\nMultivariable models, developed from simple logistic\nregression analyses (as described above), showed that some\nof the demographic and health status factors were indepen-\ndently and consistently related to a physical activity level\nless than one's peers (relative to the same as) in all or\nmostly all of the racial/ethnic groups. However, other fac-\ntors associated with low activity levels were observed in\nonly one or two of the groups. Specifically, as shown in\ntable 2, higher BMI, fair/poor health, and having any func-\ntional impairment showed a significant direct association\nwith low activity level in all groups except the Japanese,\nwhile a higher perceived stress level and not being\nemployed were significant factors except in the Chinese\nand Japanese groups. Having sleep problems was a signifi-\ncant factor in all groups of women except the Chinese and\nHispanics. In contrast, older age, excellent/very good\nhealth, and higher quality of life showed a significant\ninverse relation with low activity rating for the African\nAmericans and Whites only, as did having three or more\nchildren for those in the Hispanic and White groups. A\nhigher number of symptoms and not being married were\nassociated with low activity rating for only the Hispanics,\nwhile completing the interview in Spanish showed an\ninverse association.\nIndependent correlates of activity more than one's peers\nAs summarized in table 3, multivariable analysis of fac-\ntors associated with activity more than one's peers, relative\nto average activity, also showed both consistency and incon-\nsistency across the racial/ethnic groups. For instance, BMI\nhad a significant independent, inverse relation and excel-\nlent/very good health a significant independent, direct rela-\ntion in all racial/ethnic groups except the Chinese, for whom\nthere was a suggestive relation. In addition, being single was\nsignificantly related to an increased likelihood of a high\nactivity rating in all five groups; in four of the five groups,\nolder age and higher education were directly associated,\nwhile not being employed was inversely associated. A\nhigher level of perceived stress was associated with a\nreduced likelihood of a high activity level only for African\nAmericans and Whites (not significant), while a higher qual-\nity of life was related to an increased likelihood only for\nWhites. Completing the interview in Japanese was associ-\nated with increased odds of a high activity rating, and a site\ndifference was indicated for African Americans (the only\nother racial/ethnic group represented at more than one site\nwas Whites, for whom no site difference was observed) that\nsuggested an increased odds of a high activity rating in\nMichigan relative to Pittsburgh.\nDISCUSSION\nThis study of the correlates of comparative rating of phys-\nical activity level in a large, multiethnic cohort of midlife\nwomen found only minimal racial/ethnic differences in self-\nreported activity level. In contrast, substantial differences in\nactivity level across a number of other demographic and\nhealth status variables were observed, and these relations\nwere generally consistent across the racial/ethnic groups.\nSome variables, such as BMI, overall health status, employ-\nment, and, to some extent, age and perceived stress level,\nwere related to both low and high activity, showing decreased\nlikelihood of the one and increased likelihood of the other.\nOther variables, such as functional limitations, difficulty\nsleeping, and number of children, were associated only with\nlow activity; still others, namely education and marital status,\nwere more generally associated only with high activity.\nThe finding within each of the five racial/ethnic groups of\nthe expected relations between comparative physical activ-\nity rating and established correlates of activity, such as BMI,\noverall health status, and employment status (16), suggests\nthat different races/ethnicities may share a similar construct\nfor responding to this global question and that it is as valid\nfor assessing physical activity in non-White populations as\nit is in White populations. Therefore, the comparative phys-\nical activity rating may be an appropriate method for assess-\ning activity in large, epidemiologic studies of a single\nracial/ethnic population group, in which relative ranking of\nactivity level, rather than an absolute level, is the exposure\nof interest. For such studies, the global comparative rating\nmay be particularly useful, given its simplicity and ease of\nadministration either by in-person or telephone interview, as\nin the present study, or by self-administration.\nHowever, this study failed to observe any substantial dif-\nferences in rating of physical activity by race/ethnicity.\nFewer than 5 percent of any racial/ethnic group rated them-\nselves as much less active than their peers, while between\nmuch more active. Given national and other survey data (3,\n17\u00ad19) that consistently report lower levels of regular,\nrecreational physical activity in minorities, especially\nminority women, relative to Whites, the absence of such dif-\nferences in the present study is noteworthy and may have\nresulted from the specific wording and intent of the question\nitself. Because the question asks respondents for a compar-\nTABLE 1.

In\nthis study, that frame of reference may well have been not\nmidlife women in general, but women of the respondent's\nown racial/ethnic group. If that was the case, then the com-\nparative activity rating may not be useful for describing\nracial/ethnic differences in physical activity and may not be\nsuitable for studies examining differences in physical activ-\nity level as predictors of racial/ethnic differences in health\nstatus or incidence of specific disease outcomes.\nAlthough racial/ethnic differences in activity level among\nwomen are well documented and persist even when domains\nof activity other than sports and exercise are assessed (6) and\nwhen efforts are made to assess a wide range of culturally\nrelevant activities (20), little is known about racial/ethnic dif-\nferences in the meaning or interpretation of the concept of\nphysical activity. In a qualitative study of perceptions and\nbeliefs about exercise among mostly low-socioeconomic-\nstatus African Americans, focus groups suggested that rest\nwas more highly valued than exercise and that physically\nTABLE 1.

A limitation of the current study is the lack of knowl-\nedge about how respondents conceptualized physical activity\nand whether that conceptualization varied systematically by\nrace/ethnicity. For instance, did women from one racial/\nethnic group interpret the question primarily in terms of\nsports and exercise, while those from another group respond\nmore in terms of \"busy-ness\" and their social roles (22)?\nThe inverse relation between low activity rating and num-\nber of children generally observed in this study, and the\ndirect relation with unemployment, may indicate that, on\nsome level, all women interpreted this global question about\nTABLE 2.

In that sense, the comparative rating of\nactivity may be a more valid measure for women than other\nglobal questions, such as the number of times of sweating\nfrom exertion per week, particularly for differentiating\nwomen at the lower levels of activity.\nPrevious studies of the descriptive epidemiology of phys-\nical activity have consistently found that younger age and\nhigher socioeconomic status are associated with higher lev-\nTABLE 3.

In the present study, in\nwhich the age range was narrow and included only the\nmidlife years (age 40\u00ad55 years), older age was associated\nwith higher activity. This finding may be chance or may\nreflect a widening gap between the perception of one's own\nactivity level and the average activity level of one's peers as\none ages. It also may reflect a true change in women's\nopportunities to engage in diverse activities as they move\nfrom one life stage to another (such as full-time employment\nto retirement), although the lack of association of\nmenopausal status with either high or low activity level sug-\ngests that chronologic age, or the social meaning of chrono-\nlogic age, may define life stages more than hormonal events\ndo, at least in terms of physical activity behavior.\nOn the other hand, consistent with previous literature (24,\n25), this study found that higher education, one dimension of\nsocioeconomic status, was associated with a high activity rat-\ning while unemployment was inversely associated with high\nactivity and directly associated with low activity. In addition,\nbeing single was related to high activity but not to low activ-\nity (except in Hispanics). Taken together, this constellation of\nfactors suggests a picture of the women who rated them-\nselves as more active than their peers: educated, employed,\nand without family responsibilities, a picture generally con-\nsistent with the demographic description of women who reg-\nularly participate in sports and exercise that emerges from\nmore detailed assessments (6, 26). This consistency suggests\nthat the comparative rating of physical activity also may be a\nvalid measure for differentiating more-active women from\nthose with an average activity level.\nFewer studies have examined the correlates of inactivity or\nsedentary behavior. Although national data show that the\ndemographic characteristics of persons who do not participate\nin any recreational physical activity tend to be the inverse of\nthose who do (less education, non-White, and female) (27),\nlack of participation in recreational physical activity does not\nnecessarily imply lack of activity in all domains, especially\namong women (6), nor is sedentary behavior merely the\nopposite of physical activity behavior (28). For instance,\nheavy television viewing, which may be one measure of\nsedentary behavior, has been associated with factors such as\nhostility and alcohol consumption that may or may not be\nassociated with physical activity (29). In the current study,\nactivity less than one's peers appeared to be less related to low\nsocioeconomic status and more to a state of poor health, both\noverall and in terms of specific complaints (functional impair-\nment and sleeping problems). Unfortunately, given the cross-\nsectional nature of these data, it was not possible to determine\nthe directionality of the observed relations.\nFrom a public health perspective, this study suggests that\ndifferent standards of usual or even \"appropriate\" activity level\nmay prevail in different racial/ethnic groups. In 1997, the\nSurgeon General's report on physical activity and public health\nrecommended that to achieve health benefits, everybody\nshould engage in a minimum of moderate-intensity activity for\na total of 30 minutes a day most days of the week (3). Given\nthe racial and ethnic diversity of the United States, the public\nhealth challenge is to promote efforts that encourage and\nenable all groups to accept and follow that recommendation.\n"
