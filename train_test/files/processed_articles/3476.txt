Kidneys were processed to AT1R, AT2R,\nMR, and GR immunolocalization and for western blotting analysis. The renal function was estimated by creatinine and\nlithium clearances in 12-week-old offspring.\nResults: By stereological analyses, FR50% offspring present a reduction of nephron numbers (35%) with unchanged\nrenal volume. Expression of AT1R and AT2R was significantly decreased in FR50% while the expression of GR and MR\nincreased in FR50%. We also verified a pronounced decrease in urinary sodium excretion accompanied by increased BP\nConclusion: The current data suggest that changes in renal function are conducive to excess sodium tubule reabsorp-\ntion, and this might potentiate the programming of adult hypertension. It is plausible to arise in the current study an\nassociation between decreasing natriuresis, reciprocal changes in renal AngII and steroid receptors with the hyperten-\nsion development found in FR50% compared with age-matched NF offspring.\n",

Experiments have been demonstrated that\nrenal programming with nephron number reduction may\noccur even when birth weight is normal.7,8 It is important\nthat the consequences of fetal programming are not limited\nto the first generation and their effects may be prolonged to\nsubsequent generations.9 The nephron number reduction\nand hypertension provoked by gestational protein restric-\ntion may pass throughout for F1 and F2 generations in both\nmale and female programmed rats.10 The renal program-\nming has been studied in an extended number of animal\nmodels and recently we showed that rats submitted to ges-\ntational low protein diet presented 8% lower birth weight\nand hypertension from the 10th week of life in parallel with\nold offspring of maternal low-protein rats have shown that\nrenal sodium excretion was 50% lower and angiotensin II\nreceptors were strikingly reduced.11,12 Different animal\nmodels and gestational diet regimes or insults may result in\ndistinct programming effects and also different compensa-\ntive challenges to maintaining homeostasis from birth to\nadult life.

Recently, Rosario et\nal.18 have speculated that transplacental down-regulation of\nnutrients flow; in particular, amino acid transporters may\nbe also evolved in fetal programming by gestational protein\nrestriction. The purpose of the present study was to deter-\nmine whether maternal undernutrition during pregnancy\nalters the kidney expression of angiotensin II (AT1R and\nAT2R), MRs and GRs in 23-day-old and 12-week-old male\nrats. Since we have verified in a protein restriction model\nthat the long-term changes in renal sodium tubule handling\nare associated with arterial hypertension development, we\nhypothesized that undernutrition hypertension may result\nfrom decreased urinary sodium excretion in the offspring.\nThus, to comparatively analyze these two models, we stud-\nied the tubular sodium handling, evaluated by lithium clear-\nance, in conscious maternal undernourished rats compared\nwith their appropriate normal maternal food intake\ncontrols.\nMaterial and methods\nAnimals\nThe experiments were conducted on age-matched rats of\nallowed free access to water and normal rat chow. The gen-\neral guidelines established by the Brazilian College of\nAnimal Experimentation (COBEA) were followed through-\nout the investigation. Our local colonies originated from a\nbreeding stock supplied by CEMIB/Unicamp, Campinas,\nSP, Brazil. Immediately after weaning at 3 weeks of age,\nanimals were maintained under controlled temperatures\naccess to tap water and standard rodent laboratory chow\n(Nuvital, Curitiba, PR, Brazil) and followed up to 12 weeks\nof age. Animals were then mated and the day that sperm\nwere seen in the vaginal smear was designated as day 1 of\npregnancy. The dams were divided into two groups:\nthroughout the entire pregnancy, the daily food supply of\none group (FR50%) was restricted to 50% of the food con-\nsumed by the other group (NF), and fed ad libitum. All\ngroups returned to the ad libitum standard rodent chow\nintake after delivery. Body weight and food consumption\nwere determined every day (subsequently normalized for\ndifferent litters were followed and maintained with normal\nchow ad libitum until 23 days old and adulthood.\nBlood pressure measurement\nThe systemic arterial pressure was measured in conscious\ncuff method using an electrosphygmomanometer (Narco\nBio-Systems, Austin, TX) combined with a pneumatic\npulse transducer/amplifier. This indirect approach allowed\nrepeated measurements with a close correlation (correla-\ntion coefficient = 0.975) compared with direct intra-arterial\nrecording. The mean of three consecutive readings repre-\nsented the blood pressure.\nMorphometric measurements and\nstereological estimation of kidney volume,\nglomerular number and glomerular volume\nAt postnatal Day 23, rats were anesthetized with a mixture\nof ketamine (75 mg.kg-1 body weight, i.p.) and xylasine (10\nmg.kg-1 body weight, i.p.) and the kidneys were removed\nand weighed. Left kidneys were weighted and the volume\nwas estimated by Cavalieri's principle. Then, they were lon-\ngitudinally divided into two halves and 4 mm slices were\nweighted. The slices were placed in 10% formalin for ste-\nreological estimation of total nephron number. Total body\nweight and the weights of kidneys were determined and NF\n(n=5) and FR50% (n=7) obtained from different litters.\nTissue blocks were exhaustively sectioned at 5 \u00b5m and then\nstained with hematoxilin-eosin. We used the \"fractionators\"\nmethod to estimate the number of glomeruli and estimated\nthe total number of renal corpuscles per kidney considering\nthe analyzed fraction of the kidney corrected to the entire\norgan as described by Mandarim-de-Lacerda.19\nRenal function tests\nThe renal function tests were performed on the last day at\n12 weeks of age in unanesthetized, unrestrained NF (n =\nclearance were performed as standard methodology.12,20\nCalculations and biochemical analysis\nPlasma and urinary sodium, potassium, and lithium concen-\ntrations were measured by flame photometry (B262;\nMicronal, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil).

The rats\nwere anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (75 mg.kg-1\nbody weight, i.p.) and xylasine (10 mg.kg-1 body weight,\ni.p.) and the animal's abdominal cavity was opened to kid-\nney removal. The tissue was minced coarsely and homog-\nenized immediately in 10 volumes of solubilization buffer\namino-methane (Tris) pH 7.4, 10 mM sodium pyrophos-\nphate, 100 mM sodium fluoride, 10 mM ethylenediamine-\ntetraacetic acid (EDTA), 10 mM sodium vanadate, 2 mM\nphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PSMF) and 0.1 mg/mL\naprotinin at 4\u00baC, using a polytron PTA 20S generator\n(model PT 10/35, Brinkmann Instruments, Westbury, NY,\nUSA) operated at maximum speed for 20 s. The tissue\nand the supernatants used as samples.\nTissue processing, histology, and\nimmunohistochemical procedures\nTwenty-three-day-old and 12-week-old male rats from the\nNF (n=5) and RF50% (n=5) groups were anesthetized with a\nmixture of ketamine (75 mg.kg-1 body weight, i.p.) and xyla-\nsine (10 mg.kg-1 body weight, i.p.) and the level of anesthe-\nsia was controlled by monitoring the corneal reflex. The\nanimals were then perfused with saline containing heparin\n(5%) for 15 min under constant pressure, followed by perfu-\nsion with 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 4%\n(w/v) paraformaldehyde and 0.1 M sucrose for 25 min. After\nperfusion, kidneys were removed, weighted, and representa-\ntive samples were fixed in 4% phosphate-buffered formalin\nduring 24 h for paraffin embedding. For immunohistochemi-\ncal analysis we used anti-AT1R, AT2R, MCR, and GR anti-\nbodies (Santa Cruz Biotech, Inc., CA, USA). Antigen\nretrieval was performed using 0.01 M citrate buffer (pH 6.0)\nboiling in a microwave oven (1,300 W) twice for 5 min each.\nProteins were immunohistochemically detected using the\navidin\u00adbiotin\u00adperoxidase method.

Chromogenic color was\naccomplished with 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochlo-\nride (DAB, Sigma\u00adAldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) as the\nsubstrate to demonstrate the sites of peroxidase binding. The\nslides were counterstained with Harris's hematoxylin. Five\ncortical and five medullar fields of each histological section\n(n=3 for each group) were analyzed and the average of the\nreadings determined the immunoreactivity. Images were\ncaptured with photomicroscope and analyzed by the Leica\nQwin 3.1 for windows.\nAntibodies and chemicals\nProtein quantification was performed using the Bradford\nmethod. For quantification, both tissue and total extract\nsamples (250 \u00b5g protein) were subjected to SDS-PAGE.\nAfter electrophoretic separation, proteins were transferred\nto nitrocellulose membranes and then blotted with specific\nantibody. The samples were treated with Laemmli buffer\ncontaining 100 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), heated in a boiling\nwater bath for 4 min and subjected to 8% sodium dodecyl\nsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) in\na Bio-Rad minigel apparatus (Mini-Protean, Bio-Rad,\nHercules, CA, USA). Electrotransfer of proteins from the\ngel to the nitrocellulose membranes was performed for 90\nmin at 120 V (constant) in a Bio-Rad miniature transfer\napparatus (Mini-Protean).

In 12-week-old male\nrats we found increased cytosolic expression in glomerular\ncells and in the parietal epithelium of Bowman's capsule\n(Figure7(a) and (e)). This increase was also observed in the\nnuclei and citosol of post-proximal segments of both cortex\n(Figure 7(b) and (f)) and medulla (Figure 7(d) and (h)).

The result obtained in the present study suggests that\nthe kidney is an organ in which there are permanent func-\ntional and humoral changes that underlie the developing\nhypertension. The low birth weight widely observed in fetal\nprogramming models induced by maternal malnutrition\nwas confirmed in the current study, where we found a\ndecreased offspring birth weight of 17% in maternal severe\nfood intake restriction. We previously demonstrated that in\na gestational low protein (LP) diet model, the birth weight\nreduced by nearly 8.5%; however, here this reduction was\nmuch more accentuated. We also found in FR50% animals,\na graded and significant increase in blood pressure from the\nsixth week of life while, in LP offspring, the enhanced\nblood pressure was observed beyond the 12th week\nFigure 6.

Additionally, 12-week-\nold male offspring from 50% food-restricted mothers\npresented a pronounced decrease in fractional urinary\nsodium excretion accompanied by intensive sodium\nreabsorption in distal segments of the nephron in spite of\nunchanged CCr and FEPNa+. In this study, the reduced\nnumber of nephrons is not responsible, per se, for the ele-\nvated time-dependent blood pressure response in FR50%\noffspring, since we did not observe any difference between\nFR50% and NP creatinine clearance. This is consistent with\nthe fact that permanent and severe reduction of nephron\nunits does not cause enhanced arterial blood pressure in the\nadult rats.26 Thus, it is plausible to hypothesize that\nincreased kidney sodium transport in FR50% offspring\noccurs by maladaptive renal tubule development during the\nontogenetic period.

In fact, it is also possible that indirect\nphysical mechanisms associated with overexcitability of\nthe sympathetic nervous system induced by the renin\u00ad\nangiotensin system could underlie the decrease in renal\nsodium excretion and, consequently, enhance arterial pres-\nsure in FR50% offspring.\nThe involvement and local expression of all components\nof the renin\u00adangiotensin system during nephrogenesis have\nThe perinatal treatment of rats with high doses of the AT1R\nantagonist caused, in adult life, a striking reduction in the\nnephron number associated with arterial hypertension.32\nHere, in the FR50% offspring, we demonstrate a decreased\nAT1R expression by immunoblot (minus 30%) and immu-\nnohistochemistry in all nephron segments accompanied\nwith early and pronounced reduction of nephron units. On\nthe other hand, the type 2 angiotensin II receptors are\nexpressed at high levels in embryonic tissues, and decrease\nrapidly after birth.33 These receptors antagonize many\nphysiological AT1R-mediated effects by inhibiting cell\ngrowth, and by inducing apoptosis and vasodilatation.34\nFigure 10.AT1R kidney expression by immunohistochemistry in NF (a and b) and FR50% (c and d) groups in 23-day-old rats.The\ngraph on the left represents a total kidney staining quantification in NF and FR50% offspring and the graph on the right is cortical\nfood; FR50%: 50% of normal quantity of food received.\n44 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(1)\nFigure 11.AT2R kidney expression by immunohistochemistry in NF (a and b) and FR50% (c and d) groups in 23-day-old rats.\nThe graph on the left represents a total kidney staining quantification in NF and FR50% offspring and on the right is cortical (NFC\nquantity of food received.\nIn the current study, the renal expression ofAT2R presented\n12-week-old offspring), which is consistent with a previous\nreport showing reduced renal AT2R mRNA in food-\nrenalAngII receptor expression in the FR50% progeny may\nbe simply an adaptive downregulation response that limits\nthe fetal renal growth and post-natal sodium transport.\nConversely, the expression of the MRs and GRs in\n23-day-old and adult FR50% kidneys was significantly\nincreased, when compared with the age-matched control\ngroups. The most well-defined physiological action of\nmineralo- and glucocorticoid is the regulation of electrolyte\nand volume balance through its renal action on the distal\ntubule and cortical collecting duct. The amino acid\nsequences of the MR and GR have a high degree of homol-\nogy. The identity is near 94% at the center of the molecule\nin the DNA-binding domain and 55\u00ad60% in the C-terminal\nligand-binding domain. Most effects of mineralocorticoid\nare mediated by a specific nuclear receptor, the MR.\nStimulation of MR in these cells results in sodium reab-\nsorption and potassium excretion. This steroid binding to\nits cognate receptor enhances the transcription of steroid-\ninducible proteins and the synthesis of the subunits of the\napical epithelial sodium channel and of the basolateral\nNa/K-ATPase are increased.36,37 Moreover, the non-\ngenomic effects of mineralocorticoid, such as the methyla-\ntion of the sodium channel, may contribute to the increased\nsteroid-mediated sodium reabsorption.37,38 It has been\nobserved that aldosterone and cortisol have similar binding\naffinities for the MR in vitro.39 Circulating levels of cortisol\nin humans and corticosterone in rodents are 2- to 3-fold\nhigher than aldosterone levels. However, in vivo, only\naldosterone acts as a physiologic agonist of the MR. This\napparent paradox was solved with the discovery of the\nget tissues, the type 2 isoenzyme converts the biologically\nactive 11-hydroxy-steroid to their inactive 11-keto-steroid\nforms, thus conferring ligand specificity on the MR. In the\ncurrent study, the increased reabsorption of sodium in distal\nportions of nephron may be associated with enhanced\nexpression of MR and GR in these sites and/or to decreased\ntubule expression of 11HSD2 as demonstrated in other tis-\nsues in food-restricted animals.43\nBased on these comparisons, we may suppose that a\nsevere gestational reduction of all food nutrient and calo-\nries content accentuate the renal and cardiovascular disor-\nders in adult life, when compared with the maternal\nprotein-restricted intake group at the same period.\nMoreover, the psychological stress caused by extreme food\nrestriction may also contribute to exacerbate the effects of\nconcomitant nutritional stress. Although the precise mecha-\nnism responsible for the subsequently enhanced sodium\nretention response in 12-week-old FR50% offspring is not\ncompletely known, the current data suggest that changes in\nrenal function are conducive to excess sodium tubule reab-\nsorption that is associated with presumable higher AngII\nAT1/AT2 receptor ratio expression in peripheral vessels,\nwhich might potentiate the programming of adult\nhypertension.\nConclusion\nIn fact, it is plausible to deduce in the current study an asso-\nciation between decreased natriuresis, reciprocal changes\nin renal AngII and steroid receptors with the hypertension\ndevelopment found in severe food-restricted offspring\nwhen compared with age-matched NF rats. In conclusion,\nwe suppose that, under extreme food restriction, the fetus\nresponds with adaptations accommodating to intrauterine\nconditions. After birth, the overload for an economical kid-\nney version may result in decreased urinary sodium excre-\ntion and increased blood pressure. This overload can result\nin premature nephron senescence in parallel with functional\nloss.\nConflict of interest\nNone declared.\nFunding\nReferences\n1. Woods LL, Weeks DA and Rasch R.
