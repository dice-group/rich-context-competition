    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe purpose of this study was to characterize wheelchair tiedown and occupant restraint\nsystem (WTORS) usage in paratransit vehicles based on observations of wheelchair and\nscooter (wheeled mobility devices, collectively, \"WhMD\") passenger trips. A retrospective\nreview of on-board video monitoring recordings of WhMD trips was conducted. Four hun-\ndred seventy-five video recordings were collected for review and analysis. The use of all\nfour tiedowns to secure the WhMD was observed more frequently for power WhMDs (82%)\nand manual WhMDs (80%) compared to scooters (39%), and this difference was significant\n(p< 0.01). Nonuse or misuse of the occupant restraint system occurred during 88% of\nWhMD trips, and was most frequently due to vehicle operator neglect in applying the shoul-\nder belt. Despite the absence of incidents or injuries in this study, misuse and nonuse of\nWTORS potentially place WhMD seated passengers at higher risk of injury during transit.\nThese findings support the need for improved vehicle operator training and passenger edu-\ncation on the proper use of WTORS and development of WTORS with improved usability\nand/or alternative technologies that can be automated or used independently.\n",

Paratransit vehicles commonly used to transport WhMD-seated passengers\ninclude full size modified vans and mini-buses equipped with lifts. These vehicles are consid-\nered high-g environments because they have a relatively low mass[1] compared to larger transit\nbuses, resulting in increased crash severity and a greater potential for injury during a crash or\nemergency maneuvering. The deceleration pulse experienced by paratransit vehicles during a\nfrontal impact can be three times as high as those associated with a larger transit bus exposed\nto the same frontal impact[2], requiring the use of wheelchair tiedowns to secure the wheel-\nchair, and occupant restraints (lap and shoulder belts) to ensure occupant protection for\nWhMD users and nearby passengers.\nCitation: Frost K, Bertocci G, Smalley C (2018)\nWheelchair tiedown and occupant restraint\npractices in paratransit vehicles.

As\ndetailed previously[4], WTORS consist of four wheelchair tiedown (WT) straps and an occu-\npant restraint system (ORS) comprised of a shoulder and lap belt assembly used to restrain the\npassenger's torso and pelvis. Proper use of the WTORS is shown in Fig 1 and requires using all\nfour tiedown straps to secure the WhMD to the vehicle floor and tensioning the straps to\nDespite the presence of WTORS, the injury incidence rate for paratransit WhMD passen-\nper 100,000 trips for all passengers[6]. Wretstrand et al. found that 12% of WhMD passengers\nreported being involved in an incident while using paratransit services in Sweden. The most\ncommon cause of incidents was vehicle braking or acceleration during non-crash events;\napproximately two-thirds of incidents occurred during normal driving or sudden maneuver-\ning[7]. Injuries varied from minor to severe, but the majority of passengers received medical\ntreatment. Interestingly, 94% of passengers stated their WhMD was always secured, and 78%\nFig 1.

Despite the high reported usage rate of WTORS,\nadverse incidents and injuries remained high.\nOur previous investigation of WTORS usage in public transit buses, and the research of\nothers suggest that WTORS may not be implemented or used properly in the field, potentially\nplacing wheelchair users at increased risk of injury[8\u00ad12]. In this study, we reviewed video\nrecordings from on-board vehicle cameras for the purpose of describing in situ use of WTORS\nduring paratransit travel.\nMethods\nApproval to conduct this study was obtained from the University of Louisville Institutional\nReview Board (IRB No. 14.0274) through the Expedited Review Procedure in accordance with\n45 CFR 46.110(b), Category 7. Additionally, a waiver of informed consent was granted accord-\nTransit agency and ridership\nThe study was conducted in a metropolitan transit agency located in the southeastern region\nof the United States. The transit agency owns 85 paratransit vehicles and provides door-to-\ndoor service. Weekly WhMD boardings are estimated at 600\u00ad700; annual WhMD trips average\n33,800. All wheelchair accessible paratransit vehicles are equipped with WTORS, and signs are\nposted on each vehicle notifying passengers that activities within and outside the vehicle are\nbeing monitored and recorded for public safety purposes. The transit agency randomly assigns\noperators to vehicles on a daily basis, thus all operators had an equal likelihood of being\nassigned either vehicle during the course of this study.\nVideo recordings\nVideo recordings of WhMD activities on two paratransit vehicles were retrospectively\nreviewed by the research team. The first vehicle was a 2011 General Motors, Chevrolet1\nG3500 paratransit vehicle equipped with a rear mount Braun Millennium1 2 lift. The second\nvehicle was a 2006 Ford Econoline1 E350 paratransit vehicle equipped with a side mount\nRicon1 S5005 lift. Each vehicle was equipped with a dashboard-mounted camera (\"dashcam\")\nproviding a view of the vehicle interior, however, additional cameras were needed to fully\nobserve the use of WTORS. Thus each vehicle was additionally equipped with a 3-camera\nAngelTrax1 MiniMicro video surveillance system consisting of high resolution, multi-purpose\ninterior cameras, each having a 90-degree adjustable mount, and equipped with infrared capa-\nbility to record high quality video in both day and night conditions. Cameras were located to\ncapture views of vehicle operators applying the WTORS, and lift boarding and alighting activi-\nties (Fig 2). Additionally, the 2006 Ford Econoline1 van was equipped with a fourth camera\nthat provided a floor level view of the wheelchair tiedown system. Video image resolution,\nframe rate and storage are described elsewhere[4].\nData collection and analysis\nData collection occurred over a 12-month period to allow for collection during all four sea-\nsons. Video records were downloaded on a bi-weekly basis to a laptop computer in the field\nusing a USB cable, and viewed and abstracted using AngelTrax's FlexPlayTM software. Video\nreview was performed by two of the authors (CS and KF) using methods previously described\nto insure consistency between reviewers[4]. WTORS usage and WhMD-related data were\nrecorded as categorical or continuous data and abstracted into a customized database (File-\nMaker Pro 12 Ver. 3). WhMD-related data included WhMD type, number of items\nWTORS practices in paratransit\n(backpacks/bags) attached to the WhMD, and any additional assistive technology used or car-\nried by the WhMD passenger that may have encumbered use of the WTORS.\nWTORS usage was subdivided into two categories: WhMD tiedown usage or occupant\nrestraint usage. WhMD tiedown data was recorded based on whether or not WhMD tiedowns\nFig 2. Sample images of WhMD securement station from video surveillance system (AngelTrax1). (A) Overhead\nview, (B) floor level view.\nWTORS practices in paratransit\nwere used, along with the number and location of the applied tiedowns (as applicable). Tie-\ndown usage was further subcategorized as follows: i) \"complete use\" was defined as the use of\nall four tiedowns, ii) \"misuse\" was defined as the use of between one to three tiedowns, incor-\nrect placement of the tiedown on the WhMD (or of the tiedown anchor point on the vehicle\nfloor), overtly incorrect tiedown strap angle, and/or excessive slack in tiedown straps, and iii)\n\"nonuse\" was defined as situations in which zero tiedowns were applied to the WhMD. The\nsame terms were used to subcategorize occupant restraint usage, where i) \"complete use\" was\ndefined as the use of both the shoulder and lap belt, ii) \"misuse\" was defined as neglecting to\nuse either the lap or shoulder belt, or incorrectly routing one or both belts, and iii) \"nonuse\"\nwas defined as situations in which neither the shoulder nor lap belt were used to restrain the\noccupant. Also recorded was the individual who applied the WTORS (vehicle operator, care-\ngiver/assistant, other passenger).\nDescriptive statistics were used to present all data. Post-hoc independent samples chi-\nsquare analysis was performed to examine WTORS usage based on WhMD type and vehicle.\nAll statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS Statistics, Ver 22 (IBM1).\nResults\nVideo records of 475 WhMD trips were collected over a 12-month period of time covering\neach weather season. As previously stated, the transit agency randomly assigns operators to\nvehicles each day.\nSlightly more power WhMDs (n = 234, 49.3%) were observed than manual WhMDs\nin their WhMD with 33 (7%) transferring to a vehicle seat. Backpacks or bags were attached to\nfootrests, and 6 (1.3%) had reclined seats. Footrests were considered elevated if the angle\nbetween the footplate and vehicle floor appeared to exceed 20 degrees. Seatbacks were consid-\nered reclined if the angle between the seatback and wheelchair frame appeared to exceed 110\ndegrees.\nTiedown usage\nThe vehicle operator applied the WTORS in nearly all cases (n = 470, 99%); in 4 cases (>1%)\nan assistant of the passenger or other person applied the WTORS. In one trip, zero WTORS\nwere applied.\nThe use of all four tiedowns was observed during the majority of trips (n = 353, 75%). Tie-\ndown nonuse was observed in only two trips. Misuse was observed during 90 trips (19%) and\nis detailed in Fig 3. Among WhMDs having elevated footrests (n = 76), incorrect placement of\nfront tiedowns on the casters or footrest bar was observed in 7% of cases. Tiedown usage could\nnot be classified for 30 trips (6%) in which obstructions prevented observation of tiedown\nusage and/or securement locations on the WhMD.\nTiedown usage by WhMD\nDetails of tiedown usage for 207 manual WhMD trips revealed complete use of tiedowns dur-\ning most trips (n = 165, 80%) and zero instances of nonuse (Fig 4). Misuse was observed dur-\ning 42 trips involving manual WhMDs; incorrect placement of the tiedown on the WhMD\noccurred during 11 trips (26%), 10 instances involved attachment of a tiedown to a caster, one\ninstance involved attachment to a footrest, and one instance involved improperly looping a tie-\ndown through the WhMD frame. An overtly incorrect strap angle was observed in 10 trips\nWTORS practices in paratransit\n(24%) and excessive slack in one or more straps, evidenced by the tiedown strap sagging or lay-\ning on the vehicle floor, was observed in 7 trips (17%). Nearly a third of observations involved\nthe use of less than four tiedowns (n = 13, 31%).\nTiedown usage for power WhMDs (n = 220) followed a pattern similar to that of manual\nWhMDs (Fig 5). Complete use of tiedowns was observed in the majority of trips (n = 181,\n82%) and nonuse was observed once (0.1%). Among 38 misuse cases, incorrect securement\nlocation was most common (n = 17, 45%). Instead of being attached to the WhMD frame, tie-\ndowns were attached to armrests (n = 8, 21%), casters (n = 6, 16%), seat posts (n = 2, 5%), and\nin one instance, a footrest (n = 1, 3%). Overtly incorrect strap angle was observed in 14 trips\n(37%), and excessive slack in tiedown straps was observed in 3 trips (8%).\nTiedown usage was observed during all but one scooter trip (Fig 6). Complete use of tie-\ndowns occurred during 7 trips (39%). However, the majority of trips involved misuse of tie-\ndowns (n = 10, 56%). Of the 10 misuse cases, incorrect placement of the tiedown on the\nFig 4. Wheelchair tiedown usage for manual WhMDs.\nFig 3.

One instance of tiedown nonuse was observed (6%).\nPost-hoc analysis--Tiedown usage\nPost-hoc chi-square analysis was conducted to examine tiedown usage according to vehicle,\nWhMD type, and whether or not the passenger remained seated in their wheelchair during\ntransit. Results indicated vehicle operators were less likely to use all four tiedowns to secure\nto use all four tiedowns when passengers remained seated in their wheelchair during transit\nwas no difference in tiedown practices based on vehicle (complete tiedown use versus misuse;\nFig 5.

Wheelchair tiedown usage for scooters.\nWTORS practices in paratransit\nORS usage\nAnalysis of ORS usage excludes 33 trips in which the passenger transferred from their WhMD\nto a vehicle seat (Fig 7). Overall, ORS was most frequently misused (n = 381, 86%), either by\nincorrectly routing one or both belts, or neglecting to apply the shoulder belt. The majority of\nincorrectly routed lap belts were placed on top of the armrests, followed by those placed in\nfront of the armrest or vertical tubing/supports. Shoulder belts were frequently incorrectly\nrouted between the occupant and the seatback. Complete use of the ORS was observed in just\nORS usage by WhMD\nORS usage followed a similar pattern during both manual and power WhMD trips, (Figs 8 and\n9).

During scooter trips, complete use of the ORS was observed once (11%),\nand misuse was observed in the remaining 8 trips (89%), typically consisting of the vehicle\noperator neglecting to use the shoulder belt (Fig 10).\nPost-hoc analysis--ORS usage\nPost-hoc Chi-square analysis to assess the relationship between ORS usage and WhMD type\nrevealed no significant relationship between type of WhMD and correct use versus misuse of\nfrom this analysis as the distribution of misuse among scooters did not meet the assumptions\nfor the Chi-square statistic. Nor was there a difference between vehicles in the application\nWTORS practices in paratransit\nDiscussion\nTo our knowledge, this is the first observational study to report on WTORS practices in a para-\ntransit environment. Our objective was to characterize WTORS usage to provide an under-\nstanding of real world practices so that transit policies, procedures and vehicle operator\ntraining can be optimized for improved WhMD user safety when traveling in high-g environ-\nments such as paratransit vehicles. Best practice dictates the use of 4 tiedown straps to secure\nthe WhMD, and the use of both lap and shoulder belts to restrain the occupant.\nWe were alarmed to find that the majority of WhMD passengers were not afforded the ben-\nefit of occupant restraints despite transit agency policy mandating their use. Video observation\nrevealed that vehicle operators failed to apply one or both occupant restraint belts during 65%\nof trips (Fig 7). Failure to apply the shoulder belt accounted for 98% of these cases, and con-\nsisted of the vehicle operator allowing the shoulder belt to hang loose behind passenger's\nWhMD. This finding is comparable to our previous report of no observations of ORS use in\nfixed route public transit buses[11], however this comparison is limited as transit agency policy\ndoes not mandate the use of ORS in public transit buses.\nIn general, it is recommended that WhMD passengers transfer to an OEM floor-mounted\nvehicle seat provided they have adequate postural stability and the opportunity to utilize an\nORS. In this study, only 8% of WhMD passengers transferred to vehicle seats, resulting in a\nmajority of passengers who were reliant on the vehicle operator to properly apply the WTORS\nfor their safety. WhMD users are a particularly vulnerable group of paratransit passengers.\nThey are more likely to be elderly, frail and/or have less physical function, making them less\nable to transfer to a vehicle seat or to stabilize themselves while seated in their WhMD. Despite\nthe absence of injuries in our study, our findings suggest a high potential for adverse incidents\ngiven poor compliance with best WTORS practices.\nAlthough tiedown use to secure WhMDs exceeded that of ORS, 1 in 5 WhMDs were not\ncompletely secured using all four tiedowns, increasing the potential for WhMD movement or\ntipping during vehicle maneuvers or when the vehicle is in motion. In Wrestrand's study, 89%\nof injury incidents that occurred when the paratransit vehicle was moving occurred during\nroutine driving manuevers[6]. He also reported that the injury incidence rate for paratransit\nWhMD passengers is almost twice that of ambulatory and WhMD passengers combined,\nunderscoring the need for WTORS usage. Salipur et al. (2012) reported WhMD instability\nduring 20% of observed WhMD trips in public transit buses, a percentage that is likely lower\nthan would be expected in paratransit vehicles given the low-g environment of transit buses\n[13]. In our study we observed several instances in which the vehicle operator stopped driving\nand returned to the securement station to re-position and re-secure the WhMD. In one trip, a\ntiedown detached from a WhMD during transit, and in another, an unoccupied manual\nwheelchair \"secured\" using only a shoulder strap tipped over. None of these instances resulted\nin an adverse consequence, but they raise concern as to WTOR strap nonuse and lack of\nproper strap tensioning.\nOur methodological approach using video records proved useful in characterizing types of\nmisuse and nonuse. It also adds to the growing body of evidence highlighting existing chal-\nlenges with the use of WTORS. Alternative strategies, such as passive or automated rear-facing\nWhMD retainment stations (e.g. Quantum1, Q'Straint) are beginning to be used in public\ntransit buses in the US and are commonly used by Canadian and European transit agencies.\nHowever, this approach is not appropriate in a paratransit environment given the potential for\nhigh-g crashes.\nDespite sampling from a single transit agency, our findings may be of benefit throughout\nthe transportation industry to improve vehicle operator training and transit policies and\nWTORS practices in paratransit\nprocedures for WTORS use. A better understanding of WTORS misuse and nonuse may\ninform transit agency supervisors whose job is to investigate incidents and perform \"ride\nalongs\" to observe and improve vehicle operator practices. Additionally, knowledge of\nrepeated types of misuse can potentially direct WTORS manufacturers to modifications that\nmay be warranted in subsequent design revisions. Moreover, understanding WTORS misuse\nand nonuse can potentially guide vehicle manufacturers in improving the design of WhMD\nsecurement spaces, and provide rationale for policy makers seeking to improve WhMD trans-\nportation safety.\nOur findings are not without limitations. As mentioned, our observations were limited to\nthat of a single transit agency. Our assessments of video footage only determined frequency\nand type of WTORS use. We were unable to determine WTORS tension or angles, and in\nsome cases, the exact location of a tiedown on the WhMD. Adding a qualitative component to\nthis study may have allowed us to gain insights specific to cases of misuse and nonuse from the\nperspective of vehicle operators and WhMD passengers.\nConclusions\nObservation of vehicle operator practices at a single transit agency was useful in characterizing\nWTORS misuse and nonuse. These practices affect a majority of WhMD passengers who are\nreliant on paratransit services. Our primary finding of nonuse or misuse of the occupant\nrestraint system during 88% of WhMD trips, combined with incomplete use of tiedowns to\nsecure 1 in 5 WhMDs supports the need for improved vehicle operator training and passenger\neducation on the proper use of WTORS. Our findings also contribute to the growing body of\nevidence indicating these systems are not being properly utilized in the field, and the need for\ndevelopment and implementation of WTORS with improved usability and/or alternative tech-\nnologies that can be automated or used independently.\nSupporting information\nS1 Fig. Wheelchair tiedown and occupant restraint system (WTORS).
