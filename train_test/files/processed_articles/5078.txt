    "abstract": "Abstract\nOutdoor walking has positive impacts on older adults' health. It is crucial to identify less active older adults and to encourage\nthem to take outdoor walks. Previous studies have shown that physical activity levels vary according to socioeconomic\ndeprivation. However, knowledge on objectively measured older adults' outdoor walking levels is limited. This study\ninvestigated associations between area (socioeconomic) deprivation and older adults' objectively (geographic positioning\nsystem [GPS]) measured outdoor walking levels (i.e., walking durations and frequencies) in Birmingham, United Kingdom.\nIt used a multilevel approach. The final sample included 173 participants (65 years and above). A questionnaire was used to\ncollect data on personal characteristics (e.g., educational attainment as a proxy of individual deprivation, age, and marital\nstatus). The results show that independent of personal characteristics, area deprivation associates with outdoor walking\ndurations. Participants from high-deprivation areas spend less time for outdoor walking than those from low-deprivation\nareas. Associations between area deprivation and outdoor walking frequencies were nonsignificant. Future research needs\nto investigate how attributes (e.g., environmental attributes) of low- and high-deprivation areas drive disparities in outdoor\nwalking durations among older residents of low- and high-deprivation areas.\n",

It is especially important for older adults,\nwho are at risks of chronic disease (Department of Health,\nan excellent type of physical activity (Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention, 1999; Cunningham & Michael,\n2004). As Broderick, McCullagh, White, Savage, and\nTimmons (2015) have reported, walking and being able to\nspend time outdoors is very important for older adults.\nOutdoor walking (total walking for transport, recreation, and\nexercise in outdoor space) reduces risks of chronic disease\n(e.g., diabetes II and stroke) and improves social interactions\ndevelopment of interventions aiming at encouraging older\nadults to take outdoor walks has been recommended\n(Department of Health, 2011). Addressing outdoor walking is\nespecially important for urban planning discipline, because\noutdoor walking takes place in outdoor spaces such as urban\nstreets and urban open spaces. One of the aims of a healthy\nurban planning is encouraging outdoor walking among all\npeople (Barton & Tsourou, 2000; World Health Organization\n[WHO], 2011). Great health benefits could be obtained by\nencouraging older adults who are less active--and, therefore,\nare more at risks of health problems--than others (Hillsdon,\nLawlor, Ebrahim, & Morris, 2008). Reducing inactivity and\neliminating disparities in physical activity are important pub-\nlic policy priorities (Healthy People, 2006; Public Health\nexamine disparities in older adults' outdoor walking levels\nand to identify less active groups of older adults.\nEvidence indicates a socioeconomic deprivation gradient\nin older adults' health (Grundy & Sloggett, 2003; Lima-\nCosta, De, Oliveira, Macinko, & Marmot, 2012) and health\nbehavior (e.g., healthy eating; Bianchetti, Rozzini,\nCarabellese, Zanetti, & Trabucchi, 1990; Conklin et al.,\n2014; Conklin, Forouhi, Surtees, Wareham, & Monsivais,\n2015).

These findings raise a hypothesis that older\nadults' outdoor walking levels vary according to socioeco-\nnomic deprivation. The issue of socioeconomic deprivation\nhas been addressed in previous studies on physical activity\nlevels (Gidlow, Johnston, Crone, Ellis, & James, 2006).\nHowever, knowledge on associations between socioeco-\nnomic deprivation and older adults' outdoor walking levels\n(especially objectively measured outdoor walking levels) is\nlimited. Thus, this study addresses this hypothesis by focus-\ning on associations between area (socioeconomic) depriva-\ntion and older adults' objectively measured outdoor walking\nlevels.\nArea Deprivation\nEvidence indicates that two levels of socioeconomic depri-\nvation may associate with physical activity levels (Gidlow\nindividual deprivation, that refers to an individual's disad-\nvantage in terms of material welfare and the ability to partici-\npate in social life (Communities and Local Government,\n2010)--common proxies of individual deprivation are edu-\ncational attainment, income, and occupational status\n(McNeill et al., 2006); and (b) area deprivation, that refers to\nrelative disadvantage of urban areas in which people live.\nArea deprivation is usually measured as \"a composite of fac-\ntors relating to the economic, health, education, safety, hous-\ning, environmental, and social capital aspects of life for\nresidents of particular areas\" (Communities and Local\nincludes individual residents' characteristics, such as indi-\nvidual deprivation, it can also involve measurements related\nto environmental conditions (Communities and Local\nGovernment, 2010), such as quality of housing (McLennan\nMost previous studies on physical activity have focused\non associations between individual deprivation and levels of\nGidlow et al., 2006). They have found the most stable asso-\nciations between physical activity levels and educational\nattainment (Gidlow et al., 2006). Although previous research\nhas reported inconsistent results on total physical activity\nlevels (Beenackers et al., 2012), they have shown lower\nprevalence of leisure-time physical activity among people\nwith high individual deprivation than among those with low\nindividual deprivation (Beenackers et al., 2012; Gidlow\net al., 2006). These findings indicate that physical activity\npromotion interventions targeting highly deprived individu-\nals are needed.\nRecently, multilevel research on physical activity have\ninvolved both, individual and area, levels of deprivation\n(Hillsdon et al., 2008; Shishehbor, Gordon-Larsen, Kiefe, &\nthat independent of individual deprivation, area deprivation\nassociates with physical activity levels. Findings of previous\nresearch indicate that residents of high-deprivation areas are\nmore likely to have lower physical activity levels than resi-\ndents of low-deprivation areas (Gidlow et al., 2006;\n& Cagney, 2007). It is crucial to address the associations\nbetween area deprivation and physical activity levels,\nbecause an area may contain a large number of people. It is\nknown that interventions targeting individuals are costly and\ndifficult to implement and, thus, area-level interventions that\nencourage a larger number of people to do physical activity\ncould be targeted (Gidlow et al., 2006). Most of past multi-\nlevel research, however, has addressed adults' population\ntotal physical activity (Hillsdon et al., 2008). Multilevel\nstudies examining associations between area deprivation and\nolder adults' outdoor walking levels are scarce.\nObjectively Measured Outdoor\nWalking Levels\nSome previous studies on older adults' walking levels have\naddressed area deprivation (Fisher, Li, Michael, &\nhave typically relied on self-reported measurement of older\nadults' outdoor walking levels (Fisher et al., 2004; Zandieh,\nMartinez, Flacke, & van Maarseveen, 2015), which is virtu-\nally not an accurate measurement of physical activity levels\nand is subject to recall bias (Gidlow et al., 2006; Harris\n(2011) have used accelerometers to measure walking levels\nobjectively. However, they have not focused on objectively\nmeasured outdoor walking levels, probably because accel-\nerometers cannot capture the locations in which walking\ntakes place--indoor or outdoor spaces (Cho, Rodriguez, &\nEvenson, 2011). For measuring outdoor walking levels\nobjectively, using geographic positioning system (GPS)\ntechnology has been suggested (Duncan & Mummery,\nThe GPS technology provides accurate data on the location,\ntime, and speed of walking (Gong, Chen, Bialostozky, &\nLawson, 2012), and reduces the problems associated with\nthe self-report survey methods (Forrest & Pearson, 2005;\nMurakami, Taylor, Wolf, Slavin, & Winick, 2004).Although\nthis technology has been used in previous studies on active\ntransport (Dessing, de Vries, Graham, & Pierik, 2014) and\nenvironmental health (Harrison, Burgoine, Corder, van\nSluijs, & Jones, 2014), it has been rarely used in research\non older adults'walking. Therefore, this study uses the GPS\ntechnology, applies a multilevel approach, and aims to\ninvestigate the associations between area deprivation and\nolder adults' objectively measured outdoor walking levels.\nSimilar to previous research on physical activity (Fox et al.,\nZandieh et al. 3\nvidual deprivations, this study includes older adults'\nsociodemographic status (e.g., age, marital status, and eth-\nnicity) and health status because these personal characteris-\ntics may influence people's physical activity levels (Chad\nFull, Fitzgibbon, & Uskali, 2015). To operationalize the\nnotion of outdoor walking levels, this study uses two indi-\ncators that have been used in previous research on walking\nphysical activity guidelines (WHO, 2010): (a) duration,\nwhich refers to the length of time in which outdoor walking\nis performed; and (b) frequency, which refers to the number\nof times that outdoor walking is performed (WHO, 2010).\nAccordingly, this study answers two research questions:\nResearch Question 1: What is the association between\narea deprivation and older adults' outdoor walking\ndurations?\nResearch Question 2: What is the association between\narea deprivation and older adults' outdoor walking\nfrequencies?\nMethod\nWe conducted this empirical research in Birmingham, United\nBirmingham is a large, ethnically diverse city in the West\nMidlands of England (Birmingham City Council, 2013,\nBirmingham has been known as the most populous British\ncity outside London (City Mayors, 2010).\nThe ethical approval for this study was received from\nUniversity of Birmingham's Humanities and Social Sciences\n(HASS) Ethical Review Committee.\nDistinguishing Low- and High-Deprivation Areas\nSimilar to other studies (Hillsdon et al., 2008), we identified\nlow- and high-deprivation areas (wards). To do so, we used\nthe index of multiple deprivation (IMD; Zandieh, Martinez,\nFlacke, Jones, & van Maarseveen, 2016). The IMD is an\nindicator that provides an accepted measure of area depriva-\ntion in the United Kingdom (Communities and Local\nGovernment, 2010). It involves seven domains of depriva-\ntion, such as education, income, and crime (McLennan et al.,\n2011), and determines a score of relative deprivation of each\nlower super output area (LSOA)--defined as a relatively\nhomogeneous geographic area with a population of about\nWe identified the 20% least and 20% most deprived\nLSOAs of Birmingham by using IMD quintiles. Then, we\nidentified a ward as a relatively low-deprivation area, if more\nthan 50% of its area was covered by the 20% least deprived\nLSOAs. Similarly, a ward was identified as a relatively high-\ndeprivation area, if more than 50% of its area was covered by\nthe 20% most deprived LSOAs. As a result, low-deprivation\nareas (four wards) were identified in northern part of\nBirmingham and high-deprivation areas (four wards) were\nidentified in inner part of Birmingham (Figure 1). We used\nthese selected wards for participant recruitment (Zandieh\nParticipant Recruitment\nWe applied a convenience sampling strategy for participant\nrecruitment in both low- and high-deprivation areas.\nApplying this sampling strategy is often the norm in studies\non health behavior (Gochman, 1997, cited in Newsom,\nKaplan, Huguet, & McFarland, 2004), particularly in\nresearch on older adults (Newsom et al., 2004). We recruited\nparticipants from social centers (e.g., community centers,\nworship centers) located in low- and high-deprivation areas\n(all eight selected wards). By posting advertisements, we\ninformed participants about the research, and by arranging\ninformation sessions, we provided information on the pro-\ncess of participation in research. To explain the research to\nnon\u00adEnglish-speaking older adults, we used a translator\nEligible participants were those older adults (65 years or\nabove) who were (a) residing in a (low- or) high-deprivation\narea, (b) capable to walk, (c) autonomous in their daily activ-\nities, and (d) mentally healthy (Zandieh et al., 2016). English\nspeaking was not an inclusion criterion. We screened partici-\npants for their ethnicity. To reach maximum similarity to eth-\nnical heterogeneity in the total population of the selected\nwards, we applied quota sampling and mirrored proportions\nof diverse ethnicities found in census 2001--the latest avail-\nable census (Zandieh et al., 2016). Two hundred sixteen par-\nticipants received GPS tracking units. We excluded 43\nparticipants who forgot to use the GPS tracking unit when\nthey went out of their homes or refused to use the tracking\nunit after receiving it. However, we included participants\nwho accepted (and remembered) to use the tracking units\n(after receiving it), but they did not walk outside their homes.\nTherefore, the final sample included 93 participants from\nlow-deprivation areas and 80 participants from high-depriva-\ntion areas (173 participants in total). All participants signed a\nconsent form before participation in this study.\nMeasuring Outdoor Walking Durations and\nFrequencies\nWe used a GPS tracking unit--the i-gotU GT-600 GPS data\nlogger from Mobile Action Technologies--to measure par-\nticipants' outdoor walking durations and frequencies. This\ntracking unit had been used in other studies (Belkin et al.,\net al., 2013). It is small, portable, and light; has a motion\n4 SAGE Open\ndetector; needs least involvement by participants, and, there-\nfore, is suitable to use with older adults (Vazquez-Prokopec\nunit has good reliability and spatial accuracy in urban areas\n(Vazquez-Prokopec et al., 2009). We also tested the spatial\naccuracy of this device in different parts of Birmingham and\nit was fit for our purpose.\nWe set the tracking units on motion detector mode and on\n2-s recording interval and, then, we gave them to participants\nfrom low- and high-deprivation areas. In terms of time, the\ntracking units were distributed in parallel (simultaneously) in\nlow- and high-deprivation areas during data collection\nperiod; therefore, atmospheric conditions were similar for\nparticipants from low- and high-deprivation areas. We\ntrained participants how to use the tracking units and we pro-\nvided written and oral instructions for them. Participants\nagreed to wear a tracking unit on their wrists when they went\nout of their homes. Depending on participants' willingness\nand availability, participants used the tracking units for a\nWe collected the tracking units 1 day after the lending\nperiod and asked participants some questions about using the\ntracking unit during the lending period. For example, we\nasked participants whether they refused to use the tracking\nunit after receiving it and how many days they forgot to take\nthe tracking unit. Thus, we could exclude participants who\nchanged their minds and refused to use (or forgot to use) the\ntracking unit after receiving it. By using GPS technology,\ndata on the location (x, y), date, speed, and time of partici-\npants' trips were provided.\nWe imported GPS data in a Geographic Information\nSystem (GIS)--Arc GIS 10.3.1 (Environmental Systems\nResearch Institute [ESRI])--and overlaid the recorded tracks\nwith streets and buildings. We took all trips taken place\ninside Birmingham into account for further analysis. By\nusing data on date, we identified daily trips for each partici-\npant. Then, we applied criteria on identifying walking trips\nusing GPS data (Cho et al., 2011) and identified daily out-\ndoor walking trips (Zandieh et al., 2016). For measurement,\nwe considered all outdoor walking trips, including (a) walk-\ning started from home and ended in a destination (or in home\nFigure 1.

We calculated\naverage outdoor walking duration (minutes per day) for each\nparticipant by using this formula: (Total duration of all daily\noutdoor walking trips) / (The period: number of days that\nparticipant was loaned the tracking unit; Zandieh et al.,\n2016). To measure outdoor walking frequency, we counted\nnumber of all outdoor walking trips for each participant.\nIndividual-Level Data: Personal Characteristics\nTo collect data on individual level, we used a self-adminis-\ntered paper questionnaire. For non\u00adEnglish-speaking partici-\npants or participants who needed assistance in completing\nthe questionnaire (n = 58), we used a translator/assistant. In\nthis way, we collected data on participants' educational\nattainment (sub\u00adGeneral Certificates of Secondary Education\n[GCSE] or its equivalents) vs. GCSE and higher) as a proxy\nof individual deprivation. We also collected data on partici-\npants' age (65-74 years old vs. 75 years old and above), gen-\nder (man or woman), marital status (single vs. in relationship),\nand ethnicity (Black and minority ethnic [BME] groups--\nincluding Asian, Black, or mixed ethnic heritage--or White\nBritish; Roe, Aspinall, & Ward Thompson, 2016). Data on\nperceived health status over the last 12 months (poor or\ngood) were also collected (Zandieh et al., 2016).\nParticipants' income was not involved in this study,\nbecause in Britain, people are sensitive to income-related\ninformation and these data are rarely collected (Gidlow et al.,\n2006). Moreover, because the sample includes retired peo-\nple, occupational status was not used as a proxy of individual\ndeprivation. Missing data were less than 5% on each partici-\npant's characteristic (except 11% missing data on educa-\ntional attainment).\nData Analysis\nTo analyze sample characteristics, we used descriptive statis-\ntics. We examined spatial distributions of data on outdoor\nwalking durations and frequencies. For this purpose, we\napplied ArcGIS 10.3.1 and we used the Jenks Natural Breaks\nclassification method to classify data on outdoor walking\ndurations and frequencies into three classes (e.g., high,\nmedium and low). \"The Jenks Natural Breaks classification\nmethod is a data classification method designed to determine\nthe best arrangement of values into different classes\"\nthe variance within classes and maximizing the variance\nbetween classes (Stefanidis & Stathis, 2013).\nWe studied associations between area deprivation and out-\ndoor walking durations and frequencies by generating\nbivariate and multiple models. Outdoor walking durations and\nfrequencies were examined separately. For outdoor walking\ndurations, we generated linear regression models. To improve\nnormality, we used logarithmic-transformed variables (x + 1).\nFor outdoor walking frequencies, because we had count data,\nwe generated negative binomial models, and used the number\nof walking trips as dependent variable and the logarithmic-\ntransformed number of days (GPS lending period) as an offset\nvariable. We applied multiple models after testing bivariate\ncorrelations between all independent variables (area depriva-\ntion and personal characteristics): The maximum Pearson cor-\nrelation, rmax\n(153)between area deprivation and educational attainment\np = .000, was acceptable for generating multiple models.\nWe, first, examined associations between personal char-\nacteristics and outdoor walking durations/frequencies for\nlow- and high-deprivation areas, separately. We tested bivar-\niate associations between personal characteristics and out-\ndoor walking durations/frequencies in low- and\nhigh-deprivation areas. Then, we generated multiple models:\nWe entered all personal characteristics at once and we\ndropped the least significant (in terms of t value/Wald chi-\nsquare value) predictors to get the model of best fit.\nAfterward, we did analyses for total sample (low- and high-\ndeprivation areas). We tested bivariate associations between\nindependent variables (area deprivation and personal charac-\nteristics) and outdoor walking durations/frequencies.\nAfterward, we used hierarchical analyses. We generated two\nmultiple models: In Model 1, we entered only two indepen-\ndent variables related to deprivation (i.e., area deprivation\nand educational attainment); and in Model 2, we entered all\nindependent variables (i.e., area deprivation, educational\nattainment, age, gender, marital status, ethnicity, and health\nstatus) at once, and then we dropped the least significant (in\nterms of t value/Wald chi-square value) predictors (except\narea deprivation) to get the final model (the model of best\nfit). We controlled the final models for interactions between\narea deprivation and personal characteristics that were asso-\nciated with outdoor walking levels in low- or in high-depri-\nvation areas.\nIn all models, we excluded missing data listwise. We\nconducted all analyses by using IBM SPSS Statistics\n22 and we considered a p < .05 significant. The average\nGPS lending period (number of days) was not signifi-\ncantly different between low- and high-deprivation areas\nResults\nSample Characteristics\nA summary of the sample characteristics is presented in\nTable 1. As this table shows, higher percent of participants\nfrom BME groups and higher percent of participants with\nlow educational attainment (sub-GCSE) reside in high-depri-\nvation areas. It also shows that more than 90% of participants\n6 SAGE Open\nperceived good health status. This trend was similar in low-\nand high-deprivation areas.\nSpatial Distribution Pattern of Outdoor Walking\nDistribution patterns of participants'outdoor walking durations\nand frequencies in low- and high-deprivation areas are pre-\nsented in Figure 2. As Figure 2A shows, minimum and maxi-\nmum participants' outdoor walking durations are 0.00 and\n69.40 min per day. Moreover, minimum and maximum partici-\n(Figure 2B). On average, participants living in high-depriva-\ntion areas spend less time for outdoor walking than their peers\nliving in low-deprivation areas. Moreover, whereas low out-\ndoor walking frequency is more prevalent among participants\nfrom high-deprivation areas, medium walking frequency is\nmore prevalent among participants from low-deprivation areas.\nThe percentage of participants with high outdoor walking fre-\nquencies, however, is higher in high-deprivation areas than in\nlow-deprivation areas. Detailed results on associations between\narea deprivation and outdoor walking durations/frequencies are\npresented later in this article.\nAssociations Between Personal Characteristics\nand Outdoor Walking Durations and Frequencies\nin Low- and High-Deprivation Areas\nTable 2 represents bivariate associations between personal\ncharacteristics and outdoor walking durations and frequencies\nin low- and high-deprivation areas. As this table shows, only\nmarital status is independently associated with outdoor walk-\ning durations in low-deprivation areas.\nTable 3 shows the results of multiple models. It represents\nassociations between personal characteristics and outdoor\nwalking durations and frequencies in low- and high-depriva-\ntion areas after dropping the least significant predictors. In\nlow-deprivation areas, only one personal characteristic (i.e.,\nmarital status) is associated with outdoor walking durations.\nNone of personal characteristics was associated with outdoor\nwalking frequencies in low-deprivation areas. Personal char-\nacteristics were not associated with outdoor walking dura-\ntions and outdoor walking frequencies in high-deprivation\nareas. These results (Table 3) were used later for controlling\ninteractions between personal characteristics and area depri-\nvation in total sample.\nAssociations Between Area Deprivation and\nOutdoor Walking Durations and Frequencies in\nTotal Sample\nBivariate associations of area deprivation and personal char-\nacteristics with outdoor walking durations and frequencies\nare presented in Table 4.

As\nthis table shows, area deprivation is associated with outdoor\nwalking durations after adjustment for educational attain-\nment (Model 1). Area deprivation is also associated with out-\ndoor walking durations, after including all personal\ncharacteristics and dropping the least significant predictors\n(Model 2). In addition to area deprivation, marital status is\nassociated with outdoor walking durations (Model 2).\nTherefore, participants who live in high-deprivation areas--\nas well as participants who are single--are more likely to\ntake shorter outdoor walks.\nBecause marital status was associated with outdoor walk-\ning durations in low-deprivation areas (Table 3), we con-\ntrolled Model 2 for interactions between area deprivation and\nthis personal characteristic (i.e., marital status). The interac-\ntion between area deprivation and marital status was not\nrelated to outdoor walking durations (Table 5). Moreover,\nassociations of area deprivation and marital status with out-\ndoor walking durations remained significant after adjustment\nfor this interaction (i.e., Area deprivation \u00d7 Marital status).\nAs Table 5 shows, area deprivation combined with per-\nsonal characteristics is not related to outdoor walking fre-\nquencies (Model 1 and Model 2). Therefore, participants'\noutdoor walking frequencies do not significantly differ\nbetween low- and high-deprivation areas. None of the per-\nsonal characteristics was associated with outdoor walking\nfrequencies (Table 5, Model 1 and Model 2).\nDiscussion\nThis study used GPS technology and examined associations\nbetween area deprivation and older adults' objectively mea-\nsured outdoor walking levels (i.e., durations and frequencies)\nin Birmingham, United Kingdom. In this study, we showed\nthat independent of personal characteristics, area deprivation\nassociates with participants' outdoor walking durations.\nDiscussion on the findings of this study is provided in the\nfollowing subsections.\nOutdoor Walking Durations\nWe found that participants residing in high-deprivation areas\nspend less time for outdoor walking than their peers residing\nin low-deprivation areas. This finding is consistent with find-\nings of a previous study examining self-reported outdoor\nTable 3.

It is\nalso in line with results of a previous U.K. study on associa-\ntions between area deprivation and older adults' walking\nusing accelerometer (Fox et al., 2011). Moreover, it supports\nfindings of past research on physical activity indicating\nhigher prevalence of inactivity in high-deprivation areas than\nin low-deprivation areas (Hillsdon et al., 2008; Kavanagh\nWe also found that one personal characteristic (i.e., mari-\ntal status) is related to outdoor walking durations (Table 5).\nSingle participants take shorter outdoor walks than those\nwho are in relationship. It is likely that participants who are\nin relationship enjoy benefits of their spouses'/partners' sup-\nports and encouragements and take longer outdoor walks\n(Booth, Owen, Bauman, Clavisi, & Leslie, 2000; McNeill\net al., 2006). The interaction between area deprivation and\nmarital status was not related to outdoor walking durations.\nIt means that associations between area deprivation and out-\ndoor walking durations (Table 5, Model 2) are not moderated\nby personal characteristics (i.e., marital status). Therefore,\narea deprivation associates with outdoor walking durations,\nindependent of personal characteristics.\nIn this study, educational attainment was only indepen-\ndently associated with outdoor walking durations (Table 4).\nThe strength of this predictor decreased when it was com-\nbined with area deprivation and other individual characteris-\ntics (Table 5, Model 1 and Model 2).\nOutdoor Walking Frequencies\nWe did not find significant associations between area depri-\nvation and outdoor walking frequencies. These findings are\ninconsistent with findings of this study on outdoor walking\ndurations. These inconsistencies may be explained by type of\noutdoor walking trips. For example, a round trip in a park or\naround a block is counted as one trip frequency, but it results\nin a long outdoor walking duration. A single trip from home\nto a close shop is also counted as one trip frequency, but it\nresults in a short walking duration. Therefore, the number of\ntimes that outdoor walking is performed does not differ\nbetween low- and high-deprivation areas, but the length of\ntime spent for outdoor walking varies between these areas.\nFindings of this study on outdoor walking frequencies are\nalso inconsistent with a previous study showing association\nbetween area deprivation and frequency of walking for trans-\nport among adults (Cerin et al., 2009). This inconsistency\nmay be explained by differences in outdoor walking mea-\nsures. In this study, we used a composite measure of total\noutdoor walking levels (walking for transport, recreation,\nand exercise). We did not classify outdoor walking durations/\nfrequencies by walking purposes because of lack of data on\noutdoor walking purposes. It is possible that area deprivation\nhas a differential impact on durations/frequencies of outdoor\nwalking for different purposes. Studies on adults' population\nthat differentiate between walking purposes have shown that\ncompared with residents of low-deprivation areas, residents\nof high-deprivation areas more tend to walk for transport\n(Turrell et al., 2010) and less tend to walk for exercise/recre-\nation (van Lenthe, Brug, & Mackenbach, 2005). Future stud-\nies on older adults may involve outdoor walking purposes\nand may investigate associations between area deprivation\nand objectively measured durations and frequencies of out-\ndoor walking for different purposes.\nApplication of the Findings\nFindings of this study indicate that area-level interventions--\nas well as individual-level interventions--that encourage\nparticipants to take longer outdoor walks could be targeted.\nHowever, the content of such area-level interventions are not\nclear and require further research. Although this study identi-\nfied disparities in participants' (objectively measured) out-\ndoor walking durations between low- and high-deprivation\nareas, it did not examine the reasons behind these disparities,\nbecause this issue is out of the scope of this study. Future\nstudies may investigate how different attributes of low- and\nhigh-deprivation areas may drive disparities in older adults'\noutdoor walking durations.\nPast research has shown that environmental attributes\n(e.g., land use mix and safety) may influence people's physi-\ncal activity (Haselwandter et al., 2015; Khreis, van Nunen,\nMueller, Zandieh, & Nieuwenhuijsen, 2017; Saelens, Sallis,\nBlack, & Chen, 2003), such as walking (Haselwandter et al.,\ndeprivation and outdoor walking levels may be a sign of dif-\nferent influences of environmental attributes on participants'\noutdoor walking durations in low- and high-deprivation\nareas. Findings of this study pave the way for future research\nto develop a hypothesis on impacts of environmental attri-\nbutes of low- and high-deprivation areas on disparities in\nolder adults' outdoor walking durations. This research may\ninvestigate what environmental attributes influence older\nadults' outdoor walking durations in low- and high-depriva-\ntion areas and how.\nLimitations\nWe acknowledge that this study has some limitations. Because\nit is a cross-sectional study, it cannot provide cause-and-effect\nstatements on associations. Moreover, it involves one proxy of\nindividual deprivation (i.e., educational attainment). Lack of\ndata on participants' income, as well as other income-related\nproxies (e.g., household income) prevented this study from\ninvolving income as a proxy of individual deprivation.\nAlthough previous studies have found \"educational attain-\nment\" as a stable predictor of physical activity (Gidlow et al.,\n2006), involving \"income\" may add more information about\nassociations between area deprivation and physical activity\nlevels. Future studies may improve knowledge on associations\nbetween areas deprivation and older adults' objectively mea-\nsured outdoor walking levels by involving educational attain-\nment and other proxies of individual deprivation (e.g.,\nincome). Moreover, this study addresses participants' health\nstatus, but it does not specifically involve perceived walking\ndifficulties (e.g., knee pain) or use of walking aids due to lack\nof data.\nThis study was conducted in one British city and used a\nconvenience sampling strategy for participants' recruitment.\nOlder adults who participated in this study may not represent\nall older residents of low- and high-deprivation areas, par-\nticularly older residents with perceived poor health status.\nMoreover, this study could involve two categories of areas\n(low- and high-deprivation areas). Future research may use a\nlarger and more heterogeneous (in terms of health status)\nsample and may identify variations in older adults' outdoor\nwalking levels between more categories of areas (e.g., low-,\nmedium-, and high-deprivation areas).\nDespite these limitations, the findings of this study on\nlower levels of outdoor walking among participants residing\nin high-deprivation areas versus participants residing in low-\ndeprivation areas is consistent with the findings of previous\nmultilevel studies on physical activity (Fox et al., 2011;\nsome evidence that the results of this study may not be\nunique to this sample in Birmingham, United Kingdom.\nConclusion\nThis study extends the knowledge on associations between\narea deprivation and physical activity and adds to the litera-\nture on older adults' objectively measured walking levels.\nThis study is one of the first evidence on older adults' out-\ndoor walking using a multilevel approach and GPS technol-\nogy. It shows that objectively measured participants'outdoor\nwalking levels (i.e., durations) vary by area deprivation:\nParticipants residing in high-deprivation areas spend less\ntime for outdoor walking than those residing in low-depriva-\ntion areas. This research confirms past research showing\nnegative associations between area deprivation and physical\nactivity levels. Area-level interventions may help to reduce\nnegative impacts of multiple deprivation on older adults'out-\ndoor walking durations. However, the content of these inter-\nventions are not clear and require further research. This study\nsets the ground for future research to investigate how attri-\nbutes (e.g., environmental attributes) of low- and high-depri-\nvation areas may give rise to disparities in participants'\noutdoor walking durations.\n"
