A mixture of five volatile fatty acids secreted vaginally, identified and named ``copulins,''\nsignificantly increase in concentration during the follicular phase and decrease in concentration during the luteal phase in nonpill\nusing women.

In\nthe current study, we attempted a replication of Ju\n\u00a8tte and Grammer's finding indicating copulins inhibit the ability of men to\ndiscriminate attractiveness of women's faces, and we examined the role of copulins in self-reported mate-guarding behaviors and\nself-perceived sexual desirability. We utilized a randomized placebo-controlled design and as predicted, results indicated men\nexposed to copulins were more likely to rate themselves as sexually desirable to women and, on average, the copulin group rated\nwomen's faces as more attractive than controls.

During estrus, several primate species\nexhibit visual cues to their physiological status, like sexual\nswelling (Grammer, Fink, & Neave, 2005). Humans do not\nexhibit overt visual cues during ovulation. Thus, human ovula-\ntion is often termed concealed, which may provide some\nadvantages to women, for example, increasing the appeal of\nmonogamous pair-bonding thereby increasing male parental\ninvestment, increasing chances of successful cuckoldry, and\ndecreasing the risk of infanticide (Grammer et al., 2005;\nSexual Conflict and Parental Investment Theory explains\nthe diverging and often conflicting evolutionary interests of\nmales and females (Chapman, Arnqvist, Bangham, & Rowe,\n2003). The disparity between male and female potentials for\nlifetime reproductive success is reflected in the mating strata-\ngems adopted by each sex (Trivers, 1972). Sperm are produced\nthroughout a lifetime, eggs, on the other hand, are finite. Eggs\nare also the more energetically costly sex cell. Any copulation\nevent for a human female could result in 9 months of invest-\nment in a single offspring, thus females benefit from being\nselective in their mate choice. Male investment, on the other\nhand, can end with ejaculation. Males must compete for access\nto the limiting resource, in this case females, which results in\nsome males monopolizing multiple females and other males\n1 Department of Anthropology, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ, USA\n2 Psychology Department, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nMegan N.

Females have a low\nrisk of being left out the mating game, as mating with any\nfemale is low cost and high benefit for a male. Because the\nbest interest of males and females are in conflict, with regard to\nreproductive success, an evolutionary ``arms race'' manifested\nas certain behavioral tendencies, such as mate guarding, and\nphysiological adaptations, like nonadvertised ovulation, may\nMate guarding and sexual jealousy occurs when a partner\nperceives a threat to their mating relationship (Buss, 2002).\nBuss (2002) described seven typical mate-guarding tactics:\nvigilance, violence, concealment, monopolization of time, sex-\nual inducement, physical signs of possession, and possessive\nornamentation. Some examples of these tactics include obses-\nsive calling and checking the whereabouts of one's partner,\ndissuading a partner from attending a social gathering where\nthe opposite sex will be present, and even the custom of wed-\nding rings that signify the wearer is already in a committed\nrelationship.\nHaselton and Gangestad (2006) showed that nonpill using\npair-bonded women self-reported more flirtatious behavior and\nan increase in their partner's mate guarding around ovulation.\nNear and during ovulation women are more likely to seek\nextrapair copulations. Women may choose to engage in a\nlong-term relationship with men who are willing to invest their\ntime and resources in an offspring but seek ``sexy genes'' dur-\ning ovulation in an attempt to improve the overall genetic\nquality of their offspring while also cuckolding parentally\ninvesting men (Trivers, 1972). In self-report surveys, ovulating\nwomen do show an increased preference for more attractive\nmen and an increased desirability for men besides their current\npartner. This result is more extreme when the woman's primary\npartner does not possess ``sexy traits'' (Haselton & Gilder-\nsleeve, 2011). Gangestad, Garver-Apgar, Cousins, and Thron-\nhill (2014) found that nonpill using women report greater\nself-assertiveness and engage in more behaviors aimed at resist-\ning their partners mate guarding during their fertile phase. The\nwomen's partners also self-reported more assertive behaviors\ntoward their partner, while she was at high conception risk.\nIncreased mate-guarding behavior during ovulation may be\nrelated to something more than a response to changes in female\nbehavior (i.e., increased flirtation and desire for extrapair copu-\nlation; Haselton & Gangestad, 2006). A large portion of\nresearch on sexual behavior concerns visual cues and beha-\nvioral signaling. Substantially less research has been devoted\nto olfactory influences as humans have traditionally been clas-\nsified as microsmatic (poor smellers; Carlson, 2013). Porter\net al. (2007) suggest that the perceived differences in human\nand other species olfactory capabilities might be due to the\nanatomical adaptation of bipedality and not a direct reflection\nof olfactory ability. The current study argues men may be able\nto detect odor changes related to the physiological status of\nwomen, and this may explain subsequent behavioral and phy-\nsiological changes in men.\nIn a number of animals, including some primates, chemicals\nhave been shown to advertise female ovulation and affect male\nmating behavior (Miller & Maner, 2011). These chemicals are\nreferred to as pheromones. Pheromones are defined as chemi-\ncals released from an organisms' body into the environment\nthat result in certain responses, both physiological and beha-\nvioral, in conspecifics. Some well-known physiological\nresponses in mammals to pheromones include the Lee-Boot\neffect, the Bruce effect, and the Whitten effect (Grammer\nCummins et al. (2011) reported a striking example of intra-\nsexual aggression induced via a pheromone produced by\nfemale squid. A protein, Loligo b-microsemino, synthesized\nby female squid causes male squid upon contact to rapidly\nchange from a calm state to one of extreme aggression, result-\ning in the exhibition of fighting displays. In their natural envi-\nronment, female squid produces this protein and inserts it into\nthe outer portion of the egg capsule. Males are attracted to egg\ncapsules visually and upon contact with Loligo b-microsemino,\nbecome aggressive. Male\u00admale competition ensues and the\nfemale squid benefits from the acquisition of the victor's\nsperm. Laboratory studies showed that the presence of Loligo\nb-microsemino without a female or egg capsules present was\nenough to trigger behavioral shift in males. Loligo b-microse-\nmino is related, albeit distantly, to a protein represented in\nfemale mammalian reproductive secretions.\nIn some primate species, females produce vaginal secretions\nthat may influence males behaviorally and hormonally.\nMichael and Keverne (1970) reported that estrogen stimulated\nsome primates to produce vaginal secretions containing a\nchain of five volatile aliphatic acids: acetic, propanoic,\nmethylpropanoic, butanoic, and methylbutanoic. This mixture\nof fatty acids, called copulins, could potentially be classified\nas a pheromone, since they are produced vaginally and trigger\ncertain behavioral and physiological reactions in conspecifics\nCopulins were first identified within the vaginal secretions\nof rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta; Michael & Zumpe,\n1982). Copulins are registered by male rhesus monkeys\nthrough olfaction and affect mate choice. Michael and Zumpe\n(1982) placed four bilaterally ovariectomized females into a\nsocial group with one male. Testosterone was administered to\ntwo of the females causing them to be more receptive to\napproach and mounting attempts. One of the testosterone\ntreated females was also treated with synthetic copulins, while\nthe other was treated with ether. Female treatments were\naltered every trial to control for male mate-choice bias. The\nresults indicated that copulins significantly increased mounting\nattempts and ejaculations. This suggests copulins act as a sig-\nnificant olfactory stimulus affecting male rhesus monkey mat-\ning behavior by allowing them to discriminate, which females\nin a social group are ovulating (Michael & Zumpe, 1982).\nA similar study was conducted with stump-tailed macaques\n(Macaca arctoides). Female stump-tailed macaques lack sex-\nual swellings, yet males have been shown to discriminatorily\nengage in copulatory behavior with females during the perio-\nvulatory phase. Vaginal secretions were collected throughout\nthe five menstrual phases, and males were exposed to cotton\n2 Evolutionary Psychology\nswabs soaked in these secretions or salt water. Upon returning\nto the home cage, males exposed to secretions from the ovula-\ntory phase showed increased exploratory and coercive sexual\nbehaviors (Cerda-Molina, Hernandez-Lopez, Rojas-Maya,\nMurcia-Mejia, & Mondragon-Ceballos, 2006).\nMatsumoto-Oda et al. (2003) identified a chain of six vola-\ntile fatty acids: mucus, acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid,\niso-butyric acid, and valeric acid in the vaginal secretions of\nchimpanzees. Four captive female chimpanzees were observed\nthroughout their cycles. One female exhibited significantly\nhigher levels of acetic and propionic acids in her vaginal secre-\ntions. She was also the only female to be followed by a male\nand impregnated during the study. Levels of acetic and propio-\nnic acids were stable across all the female's cycles. Only the\nconcentration of iso-butyric acid fluctuated throughout the\nmenstrual cycle. This finding suggests that iso-butyric acid\nmay act as a signal or cue to reproductive status. The other\nacids, specifically acetic and propionic, may play a role in\nadvertising overall genetic quality and fecundity.\nCross-species comparisons between humans and primates\nthat exhibit sexual swelling or seasonal breeding patterns sug-\ngest that ovulatory cues have been lost in humans. However,\nwomen do display some cues related to their reproductive sta-\ntus such as behavioral shifts. Grammer, Renninger, and Fischer\n(2004) reported that ovulating nonpill using women at night\nclubs in Vienna danced more provocatively, showed more skin,\nand self-rated their outfit choices as sexier and bolder. They\ninterpreted their results to imply women consciously display\nsocial signals with their clothing choices. Men report their\nperception of a woman as a partner is altered by her clothing\nchoice. Women models showing more skin are reported as\nattractive for a sexual partner but less attractive as a long-\nterm mate (Grammer, Renninger, & Fischer, 2004). Other\nresearch shows that near ovulation, women report an increased\npreference for men, other than their partner, that possess more\nsymmetrical bodies and immunocompatible odors (Singh &\n13.8% of unprotected extrapair copulations happened during\novulation. According to parental investment and sexual selec-\ntion, women should be seeking both good genes and good\nparental partners. Women may form pair bonds with more\nparentally investing partners and sneak extrapair copulations\nduring ovulation with men exhibiting sexy genes. Sperm com-\npetition will improve the overall genetic quality of a woman's\noffspring, as the ``best'' sperm will impregnate her egg (Gram-\nthat women not only exhibit behavioral shifts but also shift in\nphysical appearance throughout their cycles.\nSymmetry is selected for in many species as an indicator of\noverall genetic quality. For example, fluctuating asymmetry in\nplants is a product of sexual selection and involved in signaling\nto pollinators (M\u00d8ller & Eriksson, 1994). Human mating stra-\ntagems may correlate with symmetry, in that higher symmetry,\nmen are likely to develop short-term mating strategies and\nasymmetrical men are likely to develop long-term mating stra-\ntegies (Haselton & Gangestad, 2006). The sexy genes discussed\nin previous paragraphs is a reference to symmetry, among other\nfluctuating asymmetry in relation to the menstrual cycle\n(Roberts et al., 2004). Soft tissues (ears, fingers, and breast)\nbecome more symmetrical during ovulation (Manning, Scutt,\nWhitehouse, Leinster, & Walton, 1996). Other subtle shifts in a\nwoman's physical features include lighter facial skin pigmen-\ntation, improved waist-to-hip ratio, and fluctuations in vocal\nMen judge photos of a woman not using hormonal contracep-\ntives as more attractive during the follicular phase and less\nattractive during the luteal phase, suggesting that men may use\nfluctuating asymmetry as a cue to reproductive status (Roberts\nMiller, Tybur, and Jordan (2007) found that nonpill using\nlap dancers earned US$350 in tips while ovulating compared to\nOne hypothesis based on behavioral differences suggests the\ndiscrepancy in earnings is due to more flirtation and provoca-\ntive dancing during ovulation. Another hypothesis suggests\nmen are unconsciously detecting olfactory cues to the physio-\nlogical status of the dancer (Haselton & Gangestad, 2006;\nMichael, Bonsall, and Kutner (1975) examined vaginal\nsecretions throughout the menstrual cycle of 50 young women\nvia a tampon method. Their findings show that humans produce\nthe same copulins as nonhuman primates and that copulins\nincrease in concentration significantly during high fertility\nphases and decrease during low fertility phases. Before enter-\ning into a discussion on chemical communication via copulins\nin humans, it is worth mentioning that copulins could be a\nbyproduct of shared phylogeny with nonhuman primates and\nof little importance in modern society. This will be brought up\nagain in the discussion of future research (see the Section Dis-\ncussion of Men's Behavior in Response to Copulin Exposure).\nMichael et al. (1975) found that women using oral contracep-\ntives were clearly distinguishable from normal cycling women\nbecause the overall content of fatty acids in their vaginal secre-\ntions was low and there was no alteration in concentrations\nthroughout their menstrual cycle. Acetic acid was the most\ndominant acid found in the participants' vaginal secretions,\nwhich is congruent with chimpanzee vaginal secretion findings\n(Matsumoto-Oda et al., 2003). In the chimpanzee study\ndescribed earlier, researchers suggested that acetic and propio-\nnic acid signal overall female genetic quality because of their\nrelatively stable concentrations across the menstrual cycle. Iso-\nbutyric acid, on the other hand, fluctuates throughout the men-\nstrual cycle, and these fluctuations may be detected by males\n(Matsumoto-Oda et al., 2003). Acetic acid in human vaginal\nsecretions is also relatively stable across the menstrual cycle\nand has a high threshold for olfaction. Thus, acetic acid,\nalthough the most dominate, contributes the least to vaginal\nodor. Waltman et al. (1973) reported iso-butyric acid, which\ntypically fluctuates the most in human vaginal secretions across\nthe menstrual cycle, decreases in production by postmenopau-\nsal women. Postmenopausal women do not ovulate and\nWilliams and Jacobson 3\nsubsequently do not need to secrete an acid that plays a role\nsignaling reproductive status. Thus, changes in men's behavior\nand perceptions surrounding an ovulating woman may not be\nsolely due to changes in her behavior and fluctuating asymme-\ntry but also related to fluctuations in concentrations of copulins,\nspecifically iso-butyric acid, in her vaginal secretions.\nMany studies show men are able to distinguish nonovulating\nwomen from ovulating women via scent alone. In one example\nof a classic smelly T-shirt study, nonpill using women in both\nthe luteal and follicular phases wore t-shirts to bed for three\ndays in a row. Afterward, men judged the scent of these T-shirts.\nResults indicated that men preferred the scent of women in the\nfollicular phase. They rated those T-shirts as the most pleasant\nand sexy smelling (Singh & Bronstad, 2001).\nMiller and Maner (2010) took hormonal measurements after\nexposing men to T-shirts worn by ovulating and nonovulating\nwomen. Men exposed to T-shirts worn by ovulating women\nexhibited a significant increase in testosterone. Testosterone\nhas been implicated in, among other things, aggressive beha-\nviors like competiveness and dominance. These are traits that\nmay be valued by women, especially during ovulation, and are\nrelated to intrasexual aggression (Kenrick et al., 2009; Miller &\nManer, 2010). In the presence of an ovulating woman, we\nsuggest that men may be primed by copulins to compete with\neach other and display aggression, similar to the effects of\nLoligo b-microsemino in squid (Cummins et al., 2011). In a\nseries of follow-up studies, Miller and Maner (2011) had men\ncomplete an emotional perception task after being exposed to\nT-shirts worn by ovulating and nonovulating women. Men in\nthe ovulating condition reported higher levels of sexual arousal\nand were more likely to complete a word stem to form a sexual\nword. They also rated the sexual interest of a female confed-\nerate significantly greater than men in the nonovulating condi-\ntion. In a separately run study, Miller and Maner (2011) had\nparticipants interact with a confederate, while she was at a\nhigh-conception risk or low-conception risk. Men were\naccessed on how often they mimicked her body language and\ntheir risk taking in a black jack game the confederate watched.\nMen in the ovulating condition were more likely to mimic the\nconfederate's posture and make riskier decisions (Miller &\nDoty, Ford, Preti, and Huggins (1975) found that on average\nmen and women rate preovulatory and ovulatory secretions as\nweaker and less intense than secretions from other phases of the\nmenstrual cycle. Cerda-Molina, Hernandez-Lopez, De la O,\nChavira-Ramirez, and Mondragon-Ceballos (2013) provide evi-\ndence that men exhibit endocrine changes specifically to\nincreased concentrations of chemicals in women's axillary and\nvulvar secretions at ovulation. Axillary and vulvar scents from\nhigh fertility phases increased cortisol and testosterone levels\nwith vulvar scents, creating a longer lasting changes. General\nsexual interest also increased. Luteal vulvar scents were rated as\nintense and unpleasant compared to the other scents. These stud-\nies as well as others presented above show that men are sensitive\nto high fertility and low fertility odors, but these studies do not\nisolate copulins as the potential chemical mechanism.\nJu\n\u00a8tte and Grammer (1997) exposed men to copulins, while\nhaving them rate the attractiveness of women's faces. Hormo-\nnal measurements showed an increase in testosterone for men\nin the copulin condition. Men in the copulin condition also\nseemed inhibited in their ability to discriminate attractiveness,\nmeaning they rated all of the women's faces as significantly\nmore attractive than controls and exhibited a decrease in var-\niance of responses. A follow-up study replicated the hormonal\nfindings and indicated men exposed to copulins were less coop-\nerative in a tragedy of the commons paradigm than controls\n(Steinbach, Oberzaucher, & Grammer, 2012).\nIn our study, we causally tested whether copulin exposure\nincreased men's mate-guarding behavior, ratings of women's\nattractiveness, and self-perceived sexual desirability. We\nsought to replicate Ju\nto synthetic copulins while having them rate photographs of\nwomen's faces. Prior research has focused on behavioral shifts\nand fluctuating asymmetry as subtle cues to human ovulation.\nYet we know, olfaction and chemical signaling play an impor-\ntant role in social interactions and mating behavior in diverse\nanimal taxa. The relevance of this in primates, specifically\nhumans, has been discounted, as human sensory evolution has\nbeen characterized by increased optical primacy. However, a\nprofusion of recent studies challenges this view. Our study will\nadd to this growing body of research and try to answer the\nquestion: What functions does olfaction play, if any, in human\nmating psychology?\nMaterial and Method\nParticipants\nOne hundred heterosexual men were recruited from advertise-\nments posted around the campuses of Rutgers University, New\nBrunswick. The study involved deception as advertisements\ndescribed the study as collecting hormonal measurements and\nmeasuring mating preferences. No hormonal measures were\ncollected, and participants were debriefed afterward. Partici-\npants were paid US$20 upon completion of the study but were\ninformed suspension of the study at any time would not effect\ntheir collection of the full participation payment. Demographic\ninformation, beyond age (M \u00bc 20.7, SD \u00bc 4.1) and relationship\nstatus (Single \u00bc 69%, Committed Relationship \u00bc 31%), was\nnot collected in order to make participants feel less identifiable.\nThis study was approved by the Rutgers University's Institu-\ntional Review Board.\nProcedure\nParticipants reported for a single session and were equally\ndivided into two conditions, control and copulin. Control data\nwere collected prior to experimental data. The composition of\nacid, and 2.14% methylbutanoic acid diluted with distilled\nwater to a concentration of 0.08 per ml. The acid percentages\n4 Evolutionary Psychology\nare from the concentrations of acids recorded during ovulation\nin Michael et al. (1975). All subsequent studies with copulins\nhave used these concentrations (Ju\nbach et al., 2012). The solution was stored in a glass bottle at\n\u00fe4C until participants entered the lab. At this time, 5 ml of the\nsolution, or distilled water, were used to coat a gauze pad\npinned to the inside of an Uline surgical mask. The solution\nwas applied using a plastic pipette stored at room temperature.\nSubjects were instructed to wear the treated masks for the\nentirety of their participation.\nMeasures: Ratings of Attractiveness\nTen photographs of makeup-less women's faces were used to\ntest previous research that indicated exposure to copulins inhi-\nbits men's ability to discriminate attractiveness in women's\nfaces (Ju\n\u00a8tte & Grammer, 1997). Stimuli were randomized, and\nparticipants rated each stimulus on a 5-point Likert-type scale,\nwith 1 being not attractive and 5 being very attractive.\nMeasures: Self-Perceived Sexual Desirability\nAssessment of self-perceived sexual desirability was measured\nby asking participants to rate on a 5-point Likert-type scale,\nwith 0 being not very likely and 4 being definitely would, the\nphotographed woman's desire to have sex with them.\nMeasures: Mate Guarding\nMate guarding was assessed using a modified version of the\nMate Retention Inventory (Buss, Shackelford, & McKibbin,\n2008). We modified the inventory by reducing the number of\nquestions and deleting the time frame of within the past year.\nThe question reduction was due to time constraints. We\n36 as we thought these would show the least variance between\nconditions. The original time frame was eliminated and instead\nwe prompted participants to think of how they behaved in any\nserious relationship over their lifetime. We thought this would\ngive us a more accurate measure of mate-guarding behavior\nbetween conditions as our sample size was too small to analyze\ndifferences between single men and men in relationships (see\nthe Section Limitations).\nResults and Discussion\nMate guarding\nWe calculated a mate-guarding score by averaging responses\non our modified version of the Mate Retention Inventory; the\nmodified version had good internal consistency, a \u00bc .82. We\nthen analyzed this using a between-subjects t-test. There was\nno difference in mate-guarding scores between the control\nAttractiveness Ratings\nWe analyzed ratings of facial attractiveness using a mixed-\nmodel analysis of variance (ANOVA), with condition as a\nbetween-subject factor and the different faces as a within-\nsubject factor. There was a trending difference between the\nZ2 \u00bc .03; facial attractiveness ratings were higher in the copu-\nlin condition (M \u00bc 2.4, SD \u00bc 0.6) than in the control condition\nWe next tested if men exposed to copulins were less dis-\ncriminating when rating facial attractiveness by calculating a\nvariance across ratings for each participant; this was analyzed\nwith a between-subjects t-test. There was no difference\nvariance across ratings were similar in the control (M \u00bc 0.72,\nsuggesting men exposed to copulins were equally discriminat-\ning when ratings facial attractiveness.\nSelf-Perceived Sexual Desirability\nWe analyzed ratings of self-perceived sexual desirability using\na mixed-model ANOVA, with condition as a between-subject\nfactor and the different faces as a within-subject factor. There\nwas a significant difference between the control and copulin\nrated themselves as more sexually desirable in the copulin\ncondition (M \u00bc 2.3, SD \u00bc 0.9) than in the control condition\nDiscussion of Men's Behavior in Response to\nCopulin Exposure\nOur results did not uphold the findings of Ju\n\u00a8tte and Grammer\n(1997).

There was no\ndifference in variance of responses between the copulin and\ncontrol condition. Although our data were trending, we do not\nhave statistical evidence to report a replication of Ju\n\u00a8tte and\nGrammer (1997). This may be due to small sample size and\nsmall number of visual stimuli (see Section Limitations).\nThere are different hypotheses that could explain why\ncopulins, if they do, have an effect on men's ability to dis-\ncriminate women's attractiveness. One may take into account\nAnisogamy, Sexual Selection, and Parental Investment The-\nory, which together explain men having a low cost and high\nbenefit from copulating with any woman may find it advan-\ntageous to detect a cue to women's physiological status and\nmate with any woman that is ovulating. Thus, when exposed\nto the concentrations of copulins produced at ovulation, men\nmay be placed in a mating mind-set, where all women are\nnow attractive. A follow-up study may look at whether men\nrespond differently to different concentrations of copulins as\nwell as whether we can distinguish the specific acid(s) cor-\nrelating to overall genetic quality and fecundability or the\nacid(s) acting as the olfactory cue to physiological status as\nsuggested in the Female Quality Hypothesis (Matsumoto-Oda\nAn alternative way of viewing copulins is that of a signal.\nWomen may be using copulins to signal their physiological\nstatus and manipulate men into finding them more attractive\nand thus of high mate quality. Future studies should also look at\nattractiveness ratings of full-body photographs as research sug-\ngests waist-to-hip ratio is also an indicator of conception risk\n(Kirchengast & Gartner, 2002). Are men exposed to copulins\nless discriminatory? If copulins are a signal, our finding that\nmen under the influence of copulins rate themselves as more\nsexually desirable to women is quite puzzling. It may further\nsuggest an arms race between the sexes. Perhaps women use\ncopulins to manipulate men into finding them more attractive\nand as counter strategy men have adapted an increased\nself-perception of their own mate quality, effectively canceling\nout the woman's strategy of increased attractiveness.\nOther hypotheses may be that copulins are a byproduct of\nour shared ancestry with nonhuman primates or that copulins\nare a signal and a cue. Perhaps women use copulins to signal to\nhigh-quality mates or to their partner when they are ovulating\nto increase chances of successful copulation. In turn, low-\nquality mates may use copulins as a cue to women's physiolo-\ngical status. Future studies may examine the differences in low-\nquality and high-quality men's sensitivity to copulins and what\nthese differences, if any, may mean.\nAnalyses of our data produced a null result for mate guard-\ning. The copulin and control conditions did not differ in their\namount of mate guarding. Again, this result may be due to\ndesign flaws. The majority of our participants were single\n(69%). In the control condition, 16 participants reported being\nin a committed relationship and only 15 participants in the\ncopulin condition likewise reported being in a committed rela-\ntionship. Future studies should look at the difference between\nmen in committed relationships between conditions, but the\nsample size of this study was simply too small to adequately\ndetermine any relationship and thus not worth reporting. Men\nin relationships should utilize cues to or signals of their part-\nner's physiological status in order to prevent mate infidelity or\ncoordination in timing copulation, but single men are not\nstrongly motivated to mate guard. Although our findings on\nmate guarding are null, we do think it worth investigating more\nin future studies as our study design was a severe limitation,\nparticularly to this finding.\nAs mentioned previously, our results do support the\nhypothesis that men exposed to copulins perceive themselves\nas more sexually desirable to women. Again, this raises some\ninteresting questions that may get at the differences between\nsignals and cues. Are women producing copulins to signal\nthey are ovulating. If so, why did they develop this mixed\nstrategy? Are men detecting copulins as a cue to ovulation\nand using this information to precisely time when to increase\nmate-guarding behaviors? Are copulins simply a byproduct of\nshared phylogeny? Research on olfactory influences of human\nmating behavior is underwhelming. The studies that do exist\nfail to differentiate between signals and cues. This discrepancy\nwill produce vastly different interpretations of any results, and\nfuture studies will need to determine how copulins should be\nclassified.\nLimitations\nThe current study had a number of limitations. Participants\nwere not asked if they smoked, were suffering from a congested\nnose, or had any known medical issues affecting olfactory\ncapability. Future studies should eliminate any participants that\nexhibit behaviors potentially leading to olfactory loss or have\nany known olfactory problems.\nSample size was too small to determine any meaningful\nfindings with regard to mate guarding and relationship status.\nSmall sample size and small number of visual stimuli may also\naccount for the differences in our findings and Ju\n\u00a8tte and Gram-\nmer (1997). Mate-guarding behaviors were assessed using self-\nreport, which is invariably a limitation. Interviews or a com-\nparison between the participant's self-reported behaviors and\nhow their partner scored their behaviors on the same survey, at\nhigh- and low-conception risk, may be more insightful. The use\nof actual sensory stimuli may also provide a better measure of\nmate-guarding behavior when using a random sample of men,\nthe majority of which are single. Seeing or reading a situation\nand having participants record their reaction may provide more\naccurate information as to what actions, mate-guarding or else-\nwise, a participant would adopt in a given situation. A reviewer\nalso brought to our attention that removing the time frame on\nthe Mate Retention Inventory may also be a limitation, and\nfuture research should use a measure more sensitive to imme-\ndiate experimental manipulation.\nFollow-up designs should also be double blind to eliminate\npotential researcher and participant biases. Future studies also\nneed to take learned association into account. Copulins could\nbe a pheromone, or the effects of copulins may be due to a\n6 Evolutionary Psychology\nlearned association between the smell of copulins and sexual\narousal. Future studies should look at the sexual history of\nparticipants as a potential mediator. Perhaps only sexually\nactive heterosexual men are effected by copulins. Chemical\ncommunication via copulins may also be a byproduct of our\nshared evolution with nonhuman primates and of little impor-\ntance in modern society. Follow-up designs should employ\nscent masking tactics to see if men are still sensitive to copu-\nlins. Modern hygienic habits and the use of personal deodorant\nand perfumes could negate any influence copulins may have on\nmen's behavior and physiology.\nImplications and Future Research\nCopulins have implications for human mate choice, behavioral\nstrategies, infertility, and sexual coercion. Waltman et al.\n(1973) found that postmenopausal women show a significant\ndecrease in concentrations of iso-butyric acid in their vaginal\nsecretions. Future research should assess the potential of iso-\nbutyric acid in signaling or cueing female ovulation. Future\nresearch should examine the relationship between fecundity\nand copulin concentrations as well as how socioeconomic sta-\ntus effect copulin production. Women with unrestricted socio-\nsexuality may produce higher concentrations of copulins as\ncompared to women in less favorable conditions.\nPrimate studies show exposure to ovulating females causes\nmales to exhibit sexually coercive behaviors (Cerda-Molina\net al., 2006). Human studies have shown synthetic copulin expo-\nsure increases men's testosterone levels and decreases their\ncooperative behaviors (Steinbach, Oberzaucher, & Grammer,\n2012). Thus, women may be at a greater risk of direct aggressive\nbehaviors perpetrated by men during ovulation. And indeed\nstudies show that women may be aware of this increased risk.\nWomen are more risk aversive at high conception risk than low\nconception risk (Chavanne & Gallup, 1998). Women at high\nconception risk, but not low conception risk, display greater\nhandgrip strength in response to sexual assault vignettes but\nnot in response to control vignettes (Petralia & Gallup, 2002).\nThis could have implications for domestic violence and date\nrape and would be an interesting area for future research.\nThere has been no research looking at the effects of copulins\non other women. Future research questions may include\nwhether women show greater intrasexual aggression and anti-\nmate poaching behaviors when exposed to copulins. Future\nresearch may also look at the sensitivity of homosexual women\nto copulins.\nAs previously mentioned, olfaction is an understudied area of\nhuman mating leaving open many questions for future research.\nAny finding will spawn multiple new research questions, and the\ninteractions between these findings and known olfactory influ-\nences, like major histocompatibility, will need interpreting.\nConclusion\nPrevious research indicates exposure to copulins results in hor-\nmonal changes, inhibits male ability to discriminate the\nattractiveness of women's faces, and decreases men's cooper-\nation (Ju\nstudy did not replicate Ju\nthe data were trending toward significance. Men in the copulin\ncondition did assign a higher average attractiveness rating for\neach woman's face than controls. Our mate-guarding data pro-\nduced null results. We did find that men in the copulin condi-\ntion rated themselves as significantly more sexually desirable\nto women than men in the control condition. These findings\nprovide extremely limited evidence for copulins exerting some\neffect on men's behavior. However limited, these results are\nsignificant in setting the groundwork for future studies on puta-\ntive human pheromones and provide some empirical evidence\nfor olfactory influences on human mating. There are many\ncritics of human pheromone research and this has led to some\nconfusion in the general public about whether humans produce\nand detect pheromones. Although the scope of the current study\nis not adequate to dispel this skepticism, as associative learning\nwas not tested, future research will address this question. The\nsignificance of this research area extends beyond academia, as\nsome commercial perfumes capitalize on the notion of phero-\nmones and increasing sexual desirability. Thus, the dissemina-\ntion of empirical evidence for or against the role of putative\nhuman pheromones will be vital in the future.\n"
