    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis study describes the use of guided learning activities that exposed aspiring helping professionals to the challenges and\ndiscrimination experienced by individuals living in poverty. Pretest/posttest and qualitative analysis of participants' reactions\nto a Poverty Simulation and a Bridges Out of Poverty Workshop were analyzed to explore perceived learning benefits\nreported by 43 master of social work (MSW) students. Incorporating poverty content into masters-level social work\ncurriculum stimulated classroom discussions about how the lived experiences of individuals living in poverty impact the\nservice relationship between helping professionals and clients. This observational study evaluated the effectiveness of the\nused strategies and methods in impacting individual assumptions about socioeconomic class and illustrated the value of\nuniversity\u00adcommunity collaborations in supporting diversity education and awareness both on and off campus.\n",

These policies include deregulation of pri-\nvate industry, privatization, and decreased public expendi-\ntures for safety net services and social service sectors such\nas education and health care, inevitably shaping individual\nviews on causes and solutions to the social problem of\npoverty.\nIn 2014, the United States Department of Health and\nHuman Services (USDHHS) set the poverty threshold for a\nfamily of four at $23,850. An impoverished family of four\nhas just $1,987 a month to pay for housing, food, transporta-\ntion, and utilities, among other costs (USDHHS, 2014).\nMany families at this income level work jobs that lack ben-\nefits and health insurance. They often live in substandard\nhousing and many are just one crisis away from becoming\nhomeless. Furthermore, the social problem of poverty\nimpacts and impedes individuals' ability to lead healthy and\nproductive lives--impacting health and mental health out-\ncomes, exposure to violence, access to services, and poten-\nCurrent Population Survey Annual Social Economic\nSupplement (CPS ASEC) 2013 findings indicate that indi-\nviduals and families living below the poverty level com-\nprised 14.5% of the U.S. population with 45.3 million people\nliving in poverty (DeNavas-Walt & Proctor, 2014). In the\ncounty where this study was conducted, 10.1% of families\nand 13.6% of all individuals reported having an income at or\nbelow poverty level with only 9.8% receiving food stamps or\nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) bene-\nfits (U.S. Census Bureau, 2012). In addition, compared with\nthe 50 most populous cities in the United States, the south-\neastern city in which this study was conducted was recently\nrated as having the lowest social mobility with only 4.4% of\nchildren born in the bottom fifth income level likely to move\nto the top fifth income level during their lifetime (Chetty,\nThis inability of a person to move up the economic ladder\nhighlights tremendous racial and socioeconomic disparities\nin the region--factors which inhibit the ability of many indi-\nviduals and families to reach goals of higher education and/\nor move out of poverty (Chetty et al., 2014; U.S. Census\nBureau, 2010). As the only premiere urban research univer-\nsity in the region, it is the responsibility of the university to\nincrease access and inclusion of community members of dif-\nfering socioeconomic status.\n1University of North Carolina at Charlotte, USA\n2University of South Carolina, Columbia, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nOthelia Eun-Kyoung Lee, School of Social Work, University of North\nCarolina at Charlotte, CHHS Building, 9201 University City Blvd.,\nEmail: Othelia.lee@uncc.edu\nTeaching Strategies for Addressing\nPoverty Awareness With Aspiring\nHelping Professionals\nOthelia Eun-Kyoung Lee1 and Mary Ann Priester2\n Keywords\npoverty, social class, helping professions, active learning\n2 SAGE Open\nPoverty-aware practice is advocacy and service provi-\nsion that is grounded in an understanding of the centrality of\npoverty in the lives of those who experience it and acknowl-\nedge the intersection of poverty with other marginalized\nidentities (Davis & Wainwright, 2005; Krumer-Nevo,\nWeiss-Gal, & Monnickendam, 2009). It also includes aware-\nness of how living in poverty impacts the human experience\nat the individual-, micro-, mezzo-, exo-, and macro-systems\nlevels. Rehner, Ishee, Salloum, and Velasques (1997) sug-\ngest that a helping professionals' attitude about poverty\nimpacts how they provide services, interact with their cli-\nents, choose interventions, and make referrals. To illustrate,\na non-structural view of poverty increases the likelihood that\nhelping professionals will be unsupportive, un-empathetic,\nand unable to challenge policy and organizational culture to\nbest serve individuals living in poverty. These findings sug-\ngest that levels of poverty awareness impact helping profes-\nsionals' interactions and practice with individuals living in\npoverty.\nDespite the broad impact of poverty, master of social\nwork (MSW) programs have failed to adopt poverty curricu-\nlum to ensure poverty-aware practice (Davis & Wainwright,\n2005). Protecting vulnerable and marginalized populations is\na core value of the social work profession yet poverty aware-\nness curriculum has not been a priority. A survey of the cur-\nriculum of 50 top social work schools found that only 12\noffered more than one course on the topic of poverty\n(Harding, Ferguson, & Radey, 2005). Consequently, MSW\nstudents may overestimate the financial resources that\nimpoverished individuals receive from benefits such as food\nstamps and welfare or minimum wage jobs (Ljubotina &\ners make these "
