The percentage of residents with a positive WTP changed from 29.7% before\nthe event to 39.3% immediately after the event, while average WTP increased sig-\nnificantly from 3.58 to 4.45, leading to an increase of residents' valuation from\n5.8 million to 7.1 million.

These intangible effects of sport events include effects such as\nhappiness, excitement, and pride (De Nooij & Van den Berg, 2013). The intangible\nimpacts of a sport event, for the population of a nation or region, can be measured\nthrough the contingent valuation method (CVM), by asking individuals about their\nwillingness to pay (WTP) for hosting the event (Atkinson, Mourato, Szymanski, &\nOzdemiroglu, 2008). Most of this event-related research has been on residents' WTP\nbefore the event. However, ex ante valuations may under- or overestimate residents'\nWTP at or immediately after the event. To gain a better insight in possible shifts in the\nresidents' valuationofanevent,weexamineboth the exantewilling topay (WTP0) and\nex post willing to pay (WTP1) for a large sport event. Using panel data, we are able to\ndistinguish between ex ante and ex post valuations within a single research population\nas well as between visitors and nonvisitors of the event.\nThe case of interest for our research is the \"big start\" of the 2016 Giro d'Italia,\nwhich was hosted in the Gelderland region of the Netherlands. The Giro d'Italia is\nthe second largest cycling event in the world, after the Tour de France. It is a 3-week\nevent for professional elite cyclists that is part of the international Union Cycliste\nInternational (the world cycling governing body) World Tour. First held in 1909, its\n20-odd stages attract hundreds of thousands of spectators along the course, and\nmillions of followers of the event on the TV and (social) media. The so-called\nGrande Partenza, or big start, of the first stage or stages has occasionally been held\noutside Italy. Interested cities or regions are invited by RCS Sports (part of RCS\nMedia, formarly know as Rizzoli-Corriere della Sera), the owner of the Giro\nd'Italia, to bid for hosting this big start. The privilege to host the 2016 Grande\nPartenza was acquired by the regional government of the Gelderland province in\nthe Netherlands, along with the three municipalities of Apeldoorn, Arnhem, and\nNijmegen, all located within the Gelderland province. The 2016 Grande Partenza\nconsisted of a Team Presentation on May 5 (in Apeldoorn) and three race stages\nfrom May 6 until May 8. The three municipalities were all assigned a stage start and\na stage finish, while the courses (up to 190 km per day) were situated almost\ncompletely within the Gelderland area. Gelderland has approximately 2 million\ninhabitants (Statistics Netherlands, 2017). Although no specific permanent sport\nfacilities had to be created, organizational costs for the local organizing committee\nwere considerable, amounting to 12.4 million (De Boer et al., 2016). These costs\nincluded side events such as amateur cycling events and school projects to promote\ncycling for children. The regional and local governments paid around 9 million,\nwhile the national government contributed 2.5 million. While around 10% of the\nbudget was spend on side events, public funding amounted to 93% of all income of\nthe organizing committee (De Boer et al., 2016).\nThe Giro d'Italia big start can be classified as a major spectator event (Type B in\nthe Gratton & Taylor (2002) classification). The event attracted approximately\n482,500 visitors and gained significant national and international media attention\n2 Journal of Sports Economics XX(X)\n(De Boer et al., 2016). Held in the public space, the event was free to access, except\nfor a few stands for sponsors and VIPs. Therefore, the big start can be viewed as a\npublic good, since it is characterized by nonexcludability as well as nonrivalry in\nconsumption (Downward, Dawson, & Dejonghe, 2009). Because of the nonexclud-\nability, it is hard for the organizers and policy makers to extract the utility enjoyed by\nattendees of the event. For that reason, revealed preferences--as would be evident\nby tickets sales--were not measurable, and we had to resort to the more indirect\nmeasurement of CVM.\nMany studies have valued the intangibles of upcoming large or major sport\nevents. Much less is known about the actual valuation during or after sport events.\nAs such, an ex ante estimation may either be an overvaluation or be an undervalua-\ntion. This study investigates if there is a gap in residents' WTP to host an event\nbefore and immediately after a large sport event, in this case, the big start of the 2016\nGiro d'Italia. Our research question is does the residents' WTP1 for hosting a large\nsport event as the big start of the Giro d'Italia differ from the ex ante valuation?\nAdditionally, we will investigate which factors affect these WTPs, and whether\ndifferent factors are related to WTP at different times. Apart from socioeconomic\nvariables, we also analyze whether usage of the event, both in attending the event\nand following the event in the media, contributes to a residents' WTP. This research\nwill contribute to the understanding of differences between WTP0 and WTP1 for a\nsport event as well as factors that are related to the intangible effects. The outcomes\nwill be valuable for public policy makers that may bid for hosting events as well as\nevent organizers.\nThe plan of this article is as follows. In the Literature Review section, we present\nsome relevant literature, while the approach of the CVM that we use is put forward\nin the Method section. We present the data and the empirical results of our models in\nthe Data and Results section. Finally, in the Discussion and Conclusion section, we\npresent the conclusions, implications, and limitations of our research.\nLiterature Review\nThere is little evidence that the economic benefits exceed the economic costs of\nliterature review by Porter and Chin (2012) shows that, in the 40 articles they\ninvestigated, no consistent positive economic impacts from mega sporting events\nexist. With this knowledge, economists like Coates and Szymanski (2015) have\nwondered why cities and countries are often eager to bid to host the Olympics or\nthe World Cup. They argue that public funding for major sport events may be\njustified by intangible effects (see Maennig & Porsche, 2008). Kavetsos and Szy-\nmanski (2010) have shown that a feel-good factor was significantly associated with\nhosting major soccer events. Sporting events can have several potential intangible\nbenefits such as civic pride, community spirit (e.g., Johnson, Mondello, & Whitehead,\nde Boer et al. 3\nsport events are associated with an increasing image of the host country, feelings of\nnational pride, and improved development of the elite sport system, although these\nfactors have been scarcely researched (Wicker, Hallmann, Breuer, & Feiler, 2012).\nCVM\nTo measure the value of the nonmarket dimensions in sport events, the CVM can be\nused. The CVM tool uses surveys in which the respondent is presented with a\nhypothetical scenario and then asked to state his or her WTP for the public good\ndescribed in that scenario (Walker & Mondello, 2007). According to Baade (2006),\nthe rationale for the public funding of sport events relies on this contingent valua-\ntion. The method originates from environmental economics and has been adopted in\nother research fields dealing with nonmarket goods such as health economics. Since\n2000, CVM has become a regularly used method to estimate the intangible values in\nsport and is often used for measuring citizens' valuation of hosting sport events.\nAlmost all research on the WTP for sport events has been in advance (ex ante) of an\nactual or planned event, often the Olympic Games. Both Atkinson, Mourato,\ndemonstrated a WTP0 among UK residents toward funding for the 2012 London\nOlympics. Four years before the actual event, they estimated the total intangible\nvalue to UK residents at approximately \u00a32 billion (around 2.4 billion). Although\nsubstantial, this was well below the total public cost of hosting the games of almost\nresidents' WTP for hosting the 2016 Summer Olympics in Berlin, San Francisco,\nand Chicago. He found an average individual WTP varied from 16 for Berlin to\nonline survey, Wicker, Whitehead, Mason, and Johnson (2016) estimate the average\nindividual WTP for the 2024 Olympic Games over a 5-year period at 51 per month\nVery little research has been done after an actual sport event, which raises the\nquestion whether the WTP0 still holds for the actual or WTP1. To our knowledge,\nHeyne, Suessmuth, and Maennig (2007) present the only research of the WTP prior to\nas well as after a sporting event, in their case the 2006 Soccer World Cup in Germany.\nThey find that total WTP increased by 129% after the event and conclude that sporting\nevents therefore may be viewed as experience goods. Additionally, Ma, Ma, Wu, and\nRotherham (2013) demonstrated that, from a behavioral perspective, local residents'\nperceptions of mega event impacts vary pre-, during-, and postevent. This raises the\nquestion whether the \"usage\" of the sport event may explain the residents' valuation.\nUse and Nonuse Values\nAccording to Barget and Gouguet (2007), the `use value' corresponds with the utility\nactually felt by the consumer at the sport event. Other values that contribute to the\n4 Journal of Sports Economics XX(X)\ntotal economic value of sporting events constitutes are the optional value (utility felt\nby people about the possibility of benefiting from the sporting event in the future),\nlegacy value (long-lasting infrastructures as well as satisfaction felt as a result of\nhanding down a sporting event to future generations), and existence value (utility\nfrom knowing that the event exists). These all represent values for nonusers. Allmers\nand Maennig (2009) argue that sport events may have a \"nonuse effect,\"' which also\nhas to be considered. This is the benefit for the host country's population, even for\nthose individuals who do not visit the event. Reasons for benefits without experien-\ncing the sporting event might be, among others, the increased topics of conversation\nand an increased national pride. The differences in valuation of an event between\nusers and nonusers have first been demonstrated by Andersson, Armbrecht, and\nLundberg (2012) for a music festival. This approach, developed in environmental\neconomics, has been successfully applied to culture (Armbrecht, 2014), but just very\nrarely in sports (Allmers & Maennig, 2009). In sports, Wicker et al. (2016) have\nshown that for German football teams different factors for attendees and nonatten-\ndees affect the decision to support the local team and the actual amount of WTP.\nVekeman, Meulders, Praet, Colpaert, and Van Puyenbroeck (2012) demonstrated\nthat sporting events, such as large cycling events, may have a value both for users,\nthose who attend the event, and nonusers, those who do not visit the event.\nMany sport events (including the Giro d'Italia) attract much media attention and\nmedia coverage may play an important role in the public's perception of sport events\n(Gratton, Shibil, & Coleman, 2006). Thus far, the aspect of following the event in the\nmedia has not been incorporated in WTP research. It is also absent from Barget and\nGouguet's descriptions of any of the use and nonuse values. Only event visitors are\nincluded in the use value, so perhaps media following may be considered an implicit\npart of the \"existence value\" of an event. Therefore, to addresses a gap in the\nliterature, we include media following in our research as an explanatory factor for\nWTP in addition to the actual attendance of the event.\nMethod\nTo measure the WTP for nonmarket goods, two alternatives exist: the revealed pre-\nference method and the stated preference methods. The revealed preference method\nestablishes WTP from observed behavior of the purchase of complementary or sub-\nstitution goods. At best, this method can only provide estimates for the use value of an\nevent (Vekeman et al., 2012). Because of the possible existence of intangible aspects,\nincluding nonuse values such as happiness or pride, the WTP is more appropriately\nmeasured by the stated preference method. Also, in the absence of ticket sales for the\nbig start of the Giro d'Italia, demand could not be measured through revealed pre-\nference, so we had to resort to an indirect measurement method.\nFollowing similar research on cycling (Vekeman et al., 2012) and other sport\nevents such as the Olympics (e.g., Coates & Szymanski, 2015, Wicker et al., 2012),\nde Boer et al. 5\nwe adopt the CVM, in which respondents are questioned directly about their WTP.\nThe CVM uses surveys to measure an individual's WTP for a good or service\nmethod is very appropriate to place \"monetary value on environmental goods and\nservices not bought and sold in the marketplace\" (p. 1413). A disadvantage of CVM\nis the hypothetical bias, or the tendency of respondents to overstate their WTP. To\naddress this issue, we incorporate an extensive and realistic reasoning for contribut-\ning to the event. To assess the WTP for hosting the big start of the Giro d'Italia in\nGelderland, a standardized questionnaire was developed in which respondents are\npresented with a hypothetical situation. Following the advice of Mitchell and Carson\n(1990) to present a realistic scenario, inhabitants of Gelderland were ex ante pre-\nsented with the following hypothetical situation:\nAs a result of the bankruptcy of a major sponsor of the \"big start\" of the 2016 Giro d'Italia,\nthe organization has a major shortfall in the budget for the event. To still have the cycling\nrace take place in Gelderland, residents are asked to contribute. If the total contribution of\nthe public is insufficient, the Giro Start will be moved to Italy. What is the maximum\namount of money that you personally are willing to contribute to maintain the start of the\nGiro d'Italia for Gelderland?\nIn the ex post research, this scenario was adjusted to the past tense and the\nrespondents were asked to imagine the following, slightly altered, scenario:\nAs a result of the bankruptcy of a major sponsor of the \"big start\" of the 2016 Giro d'Italia,\nthe organization had a major shortfall in the budget for the event. In order for the cycling\nrace to take place in Gelderland, residents were asked to make a donation. If the total\ncontribution of the public was insufficient, the Giro Start would have been moved to Italy.\nWhat is the maximum amount of money that you personally would be willing to contribute\nto have preserved the start of the Giro d'Italia for Gelderland?\nWe have chosen for the scenario of a bankruptcy, because in early 2016, several\nwell-known Dutch brands (such as Vroom & Dreesmann, HEMA, and McGregor)\nwent bankrupt or were in danger of being liquidated. Therefore, in our view, a\nbankruptcy presents a likely but exogenous reason to ask respondents for a private\ndonation. Since governments at several levels (local, regional, and national) were\nalready financially committed to the event, the alternative of including a case for\npublic subsidies in our scenario was problematic.\nThe survey question considering WTP can be formulated either as open-ended\nquestion or by using a dichotomous choice format. Green, Jacowitz, Kahneman, and\nMcFadden (1998) point out that a dichotomous approach has an anchoring effect\nwhich may distort the outcomes severely and conclude that an open-ended question\nmost likely provides more information on the WTP. Castellanos, Garci\n\u00b4a, and Sa\n\u00b4nchez\n(2011) confirm this finding in the sport context for the support of funding for a local\nprofessional football club. We therefore used the open-ended question for the purpose\n6 Journal of Sports Economics XX(X)\nof our research. We assume that the strategic bias--the tendency of respondents to fill\nin a lower than real value in fear of having to really pay the amount on a later date--to\nbe negligible because as we added an element of voluntariness to the WTP question.\nThe survey was conducted using the Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social\nSciences (LISS) panel of CentER data at the Tilburg University. The LISS panel is a\nrepresentative panel of the Dutch population2 and consists of around 8,000 individuals\nfrom ca. 5,000 households. The LISS panel consists of persons aged 16 and older. Our\nresearch was aimed at all the panel members from the Gelderland province. This\namounted to 880 panel members. LISS works with 4-week panels. Respondents were\nquestioned about 2 months before the event, from March 7 to April 3, 2016 (T0); and\nimmediately after the event from May 9 to June 6, 2016 (T1). At both instances,\npersons who had not yet participated got a reminder up to 2 times. In total, 719 people\nparticipated in the first survey, of whom 642 also filled in the second survey (overall\nresponse rate of 73%). After eliminating incomplete surveys, the final data set con-\nsisted of 572 respondents that filled in the questionnaire on both T0 and T1.\nIn this article, we want to establish whether the WTP1 is different from the\nWTP0. We found no work on this difference besides Maenning (2007), who found\na substantial increase in WTP at the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany. However, it\nmust be pointed out that the German population experienced this event as particu-\nlarly successful in terms of sporting success as well as the feel good factor and social\nperceptions of an event changes over time, but this change varies between different\ngroups of residents. Based upon these results, our hypothesis is that WTP can\nchange, but the direction is not clear. Therefore, we use a two-sided test when testing\nthe null hypothesis that no change between WTP0 and WTP1 occurs.\nOur second objective is to find a relationship between visiting the event and\nfollowing the event in the media on the one hand and WTP on the other hand. Since\nWalton et al. (2008) showed that the potential attendance was positively related with\nWTP0, our hypothesis is that (an intention to) visit the events leads to a higher WTP.\nThis is backed up by Andersson et al. (2012) who showed that for a music event\nthere exists a significant and positive use value. Following the findings of Ma et al.\n(2013), we assume that people who follow the event in the media are doing so\nbecause of a positive interest in the event. Therefore, our hypotheses are that there\nis a positive relationship between both visiting the event and WTP as well as\nbetween following the event in the media and WTP.\nTable 1 shows the dependent and independent variables in our data panel. The\ndependent variables are the WTP0 and WTP1. Standard socioeconomic variables\nthat have shown to be significant indicators for WTP in sport, were included. These\nwere gender, age,3 education, and household income (see, e.g., Atkinson et al., 2008;\nWicker et al., 2016). Additionally, sport-specific dummies were included for persons\nparticipating at least 12 times in the last 12 months in sports in general and in cycling\nspecifically. Finally, dummies for both visiting the event and following it in the\nmedia have been included in both realization (at T1) and intention (at T0).\nde Boer et al. 7\nData and Results\nTable 2 reports the descriptive statistics of the sample. Half of the respondents\n(50.0%) were women, while the average age was 51.7 years. Almost a third of the\nrespondents (32.3%) had completed higher education and average household income\nwas over 2,700 per month.

Over half of the\nrespondents (52.8%) followed the event in the media, while 47.2% intended to\nfollow it 2 months prior to the event.\nThe results show that the average WTP was 3.58 before the event and 4.45 after\nthe event. This is an increase of 24.3%. The Wilcoxon-signed rank test for compar-\ning matched samples (that are not normally distributed) dismisses the null hypoth-\nesis that WTP0 has the same median as WTP1 (p < .001). The average WTP1 for the\npersons that had a WTP0 of 0 was 2.08. This increase was significant (p \u00bc .002).\nBy contrast, the average WTP1 of the persons with a positive WTP0 decreased by\n2.02 compared with their average WTP0. However, this change was not significant\n(p \u00bc .17). The average WTP of the persons who were willing to pay something\nwith a WTP > 0 at T1).\nTable 3 shows the number of respondents who were willing to pay something for\nhosting the event. This percentage changed significantly (p < .001) from 29.7% ex\nante to 39.3% ex post. Of the persons that ex ante did want to pay something for the\nevent 23.6% did not want to pay anything after the event. Vice versa, a similar\npercentage (23.5%) of the persons that ex ante did not want to pay anything for the\nevent did want to pay something ex post. The w2 test shows that the ex ante and ex post\nprobabilities for a positive WTP differ significantly (p< .001). Hence, the timing of\ncontingent valuation measurement of a sport event is important for its outcome.\nFurther analysis shows that the gaps in WTP between persons (with the intention\nof) attending and nonattending the events, as well as (with the intention of)\nTable 2. Descriptive Statistics.\nVariable Observations Mean SD Min. Max.\nDependent\nIndependent\nNote.

However, the change in WTP between the\nex ante and the ex post measurement was not significant for any of these subgroups.\nWith two possible outcomes (yes or no) and two moments of measurement (ex\nante and ex post), it is possible to distinguish between four groups of people,4 for\nboth attending the event (Table 4) and following it in the media (Table 5). Analysis\nof these groups shows a significant increase in WTP for people who visited the event\nbut had no intention to do so. For all other groups, no significant change in WTP was\nmeasured. Additionally, within the group of persons with an intention to visit the\nevent, persons who actually did visit the event had a significantly (much) higher\nWTP than those who in the end decided not to attend. This finding is also replicated\nin the group of people with the intention of following the event in the media but not\nin the groups with no intention to visit or follow the event.\nWe use regression modeling to measure the effect on WTP of covariates such as\nvisiting or following the event. For a CVM data set with a relative large number of\nzeroes, a Tobit regression model can determine the effects of the independent vari-\nable on WTP. Alternatively, a hurdle model could be considered if a respondent's\nWTP anything at all depends on other factors than the actual amount of payment,\nespecially with a relative large number of zeroes (Castellanos, Garci\n\u00b4a, & Sa\n\u00b4nchez,\nTable 3.

Preliminary analyses showed that the same covariates are relevant in explain-\ning the amount as well as whether or not one is willing to pay at all. For this reason,\nthe Tobit model was preferred to a hurdle model to estimate effects of the socio-\neconomic, sport-related, and \"use\" variables on residents' WTP. For both T0 and T1,\nseveral Tobit models have been estimated, the outcomes of which are shown in\nFor both the ex ante and ex post regressions, four models are represented: a\nsimple model with only visit and media as explanatory variables (intention at T0,\nrealization at T1; Model 1); a full model with all explanatory variables (Model 2);\nand two final models with the use of backward elimination (dropping all variables\nwith p > .05), one model with visit, but without media (Model 3), and a second final\nmodel with both visit and media use at T1 and intention at T0 (Model 4).\nThe results show that visiting the event and following the event in the media are\nimportant determinants of WTP, as both are highly significant predictors (p < .01) of\nWTP and the outcomes are robust for different model specifications. This holds true\nfor both the ex ante and the ex post models. Also, the coefficients of the media\nvariables in all Models 1, 2, and 4 are larger than those of the attendance variables,\nboth for T0 and T1. Additionally, net household income has a positive and signif-\nicant relation with WTP, whereas gender and sport participation are not significantly\nrelated with the WTP0.\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nThe main aim of this research was to provide an ex ante and ex post contingent\nvaluation of a large sport event, the big start of the 2016 Giro d'Italia in the Gelder-\nland province in the Netherlands. Two months prior to the event and in the month\nimmediately after the event are presentative panel of residents from Gelderland was\nasked to state their WTP for the event. The average WTP0 was 3.58, while the ex\npost average was 4.45, a difference of 24%. The results show that the ex ante and ex\npost chances of a positive WTP increased significantly from 29.7% to 39.3%. A\nsimple extrapolation of these results would lead to a total ex ante valuation of this\nevent of 5.8 million for the 1.6 million adult residents of the host area of\nTable 5.

These\nfindings echo those of Heyne et al. (2007) who also found a significant increase\nin WTP after the 2006 Football World Cup.\nOur research shows that ex ante contingent valuations of the intangible effects of\nsport events may be an underestimation of the actual or ex post valuations. However,\nwe would be extremely cautious to generalize these outcomes to other events.\nMoreover, we would not rule out the possibility of ex ante overestimations, since\nthe difference in valuation may be a reflection of, for example, the level of success or\nother characteristics of the event. Also, the nature of WTP1 measurement is vulner-\nable for overestimation, since the hypothetical bias (as discussed in Walker &\nMondello, 2007) is much more likely to occur after than before the event. Using a\npanel for the longitudinal approach for the CVM may limit this ex post effect.\nAnother limitation of our research is the one-sided focus on positive externalities\nin willingness to pay, which does not allow for negative externalities. Our study does\nnot take into account that a part of the region's residents may be willing to pay for\nnot the hosting of the event (see, e.g., Hausman, 2012). This may be more concern-\ning for a large-scale sport event crossing many public roads as the Giro d'Italia than\nfor smaller events or those taking place in a demarcated area such as a stadium.\nAlthough the Tobit model addresses the zeroes in the data statistically, the results\nmay therefore have a realistic upward bias. Additionally, the respondents may not be\ntruly representative of the whole population. The use of a panel leads to a relatively\nsmall number of nonrespondents. Nevertheless, nonresponse could be for a sign of\nno interest, and thus a WTP of less than or equal to the mean WTP values of our\nsample. In that case, the presented WTPs could be interpreted as an upper bound\nestimate (see Johnson, Groothuis, & Whitehead, 2001).\nOnly for visitors of the event who initially had no intention to do so, a significant\nchange between WTP0 and WTP1 is measured. Analysis also showed that within the\ngroup of persons with an intention to visit the event, average ex ante WTP was much\nhigher for the individuals who actually did attend than for those who did not attend\nand a similar pattern was found for persons with regard to following the event in the\nmedia. While the first finding suggests that attracting visitors who initially had no\nintention to do so can increase WTP, the second finding means that, for people who\nsay they have an intention to visit or follow the event, WTP0 maybe a predictor of\nthe likelihood of actually visiting or following the event. To explore which other\nfactors determine a person's actual behavior toward a sport event, in relation to\nWTP, more research (with a larger sample size) is needed.\nResults of the Tobit regressions show that both visiting the event and following\nthe event in the media lead to a significant higher WTP. Remarkably, the effect of\nthe latter is larger than the former, both in intention (ex ante) and in realization. The\nregression results indicate that, at the individual level, media use is more important\nthan visiting the event for residents' valuation of the event. In Table 6, visit intention\nhas a higher coefficient in Model 3 than in Model 4. Table 7 shows similar results for\n14 Journal of Sports Economics XX(X)\nvisit use and media use. These outcomes implicate that the model without a variable\nfor media following (intention or realization) may overestimate the effect of attend-\ning the event. At the same time, that model may underestimate WTP for people who\nfollow the event in the media. Our research shows that media usage for the valuation\nof the intangibles of an event such as the Giro d'Italia (free to visit but also free to\nwatch on the television) may be more important than actual visiting the event, not\nonly because it had a higher impact at the individual level but also because it is\napplicable to a larger share of the population (53% vs. 26%). Media coverage and\nmedia consumption of a sport event can therefore have a strong influence on the\npublic's valuation of that event.\nWe conclude that the timing of the measurement of WTP affects the outcomes,\nwhich is valuable information, in particular for policy makers who have to decide\nwhether or not to host or organize an event. Most of the variance in the total\nvaluation can be attributed to a shift of people who went from a WTP of nill to\na positive WTP. This can in part be contributed to the persons who visited or\nfollowed the event but did not have the intention to so. In this case, the ex post\nmeasurement was conducted immediately after the event. Later measurements\nmay show other outcomes, with a fading memory of the event, as well as conse-\nquences of the event (such as financial implications) may have an effect on res-\nidents' valuation. An assessment whether WTP1 is stable over time and is beyond\nthe scope of this article.\nFurther research is needed for explaining differences between WTP0 and\nWTP1 for sport events. Specific research questions may include \"`what event\nand nonevent factors determine a person's change from zero WTP to a positive\nWTP?\" and \"what causes can identify nonvisitors among the persons with the\nintention of visiting or following the event?\" This research should also include\nother factors, such as the weather the (chances of) success of local participants\nor a home team or competitive balance, as has been suggested by Nalbantis,\nPawlowski, and Coates (2017). The outcomes, in combination with more com-\nbined WTP0 and WTP1 studies, may help explaining and predicting the \"real\"\nWTP. We furthermore advise to include media consumption of an event into a\nbroader concept of use, to complement the traditional \"narrow\" perception of\nuse, which only includes actual visiting the event. Our findings show that media\nfollowing, and therefore media coverage, can play a very important role in the\nresidents' perception of a sport event's value, which is important information for\nboth public policy makers and event organizers with regard to the bid, prepara-\ntion, execution, and evaluation phases of events. To get a better understanding\nof the role of media coverage and media following in the valuation of events,\nmore research is needed.\n"
