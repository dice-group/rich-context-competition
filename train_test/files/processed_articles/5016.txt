In\nvivo studies were done to confirm safety and investigate fucoidan-mediated immune modulation. Methods: Cytochrome\nhepatocytes model to evaluate the CYP450 induction potential of each fucoidan at highest theoretical concentrations.\nFour hepatic metabolism phase II pathways--glutathione S transferase (GST), quinone oxidoreductase (QOR), catechol-\nO-methyltransferases (COMT), and uridine di-phosphate (UDP)-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)--were evaluated with\nvalidated immunoassays. Growth inhibition assays were performed with each fucoidan alone and in combination with\nchemotherapy agents in a panel of human cancer cell lines. In vivo studies evaluated safety and immune modualtion.\nResults: CYP450 inhibition was observed with FVF. The GST, QOR, and UGT pathways had no changes. UPF and FVF\nboth interacted with COMT. No growth inhibitory activity in cancer cell lines was observed. UPF and FVF had synergistic\nactivity with paclitaxel or tamoxifen and additive activity with topotecan. In vivo, FVF decreased HeLa human cervical\ntumor growth and both FVF and UPF decreased TOV-112D human ovarian tumor growth. Otherwise, no significant\nchange in tumor growth was observed. FVF immune modulation of IgG and IL-6 was observed (p<0.03). Conclusion: At\nhigher doses, UPF and FVF may have limited potential for drug-supplement interactions, with either CYP450 or COMT\nhepatic metabolism pathways. Additional studies are warranted to evaluate to confirm findings of fucoidans in combination\nwith chemotherapy.\n",

They show a wide\nspectrum of biological effects, such as anticoagulant and\nantithrombotic properties, and antiviral, antitumor, antioxi-\ndant, and anticomplement functions.2-4 Fucoidans also have a\nvariety of immune-modulation effects, such as promoting\nactivation of macrophages, induction of dendritic cells, natu-\nral killer cells, and T-cells, and enhancing antiviral and anti-\nPolysaccharides display the highest biological properties\namong macromolecules.

These include polysaccharides extracted\nfrom medicinal mushrooms and yeast glucans.6 The struc-\nture of these natural polysaccharides allows them to be used\nin conjugation with anticancer agents; however, the activity\nmay vary depending on the unique extraction and purifica-\ntion processes leading to variations in physiochemical and\nbiopharmaceutical properties.7\nThe overall objective in this study was to determine the\nsafety of Undaria pinnatifida and Fucus vesiculosus to sup-\nport potential evaluation in prospective clinical trials in com-\nbination with chemotherapy in the oncology arena to\nultimately improve patient outcomes. Specifically, studies\nwere done to define the hepatic metabolism pathways for\nfucoidans and potential for drug-herbal interactions.\nFurthermore, the activity of the fucoidan extracts in a panel\nof human cancer cell lines was evaluated to define the growth\ninhibitory concentration (IC\n) of each fucoidan extract alone\nand/or in combination with commonly used cytotoxic che-\nmotherapy agents. Finally, in vivo studies were completed to\nconfirm safety of fucoidans in the presence of tumors and to\ninvestigate fucoidan-mediated immune modulation.\nMaterials and Methods\nFucoidans\nIn this study, the fucoidan extract from Undaria pinnatifida\n(UPF; Figure 1A) and the fucoidan extract from Fucus\nvesiculosus (FVF; Figure 1B) were prepared by Marinova\nPty Ltd (Cambridge TAS, Australia). The carbohydrate pro-\nfiles were defined using a gas chromatography (GC)\u00adbased\nmethod for the accurate determination of individual mono-\nsaccharide ratios in a sample. This method relies on the prep-\naration of acetylated alditol derivatives of the hydrolyzed\nsamples established by Morvai-Vit\u00e1nyi and colleagues.8 The\nuronic acid content was determined by spectrophotometric\nanalysis of the hydrolyzed compound in the presence of\n3-phenylphenol, based on a method described by Filisetti-\nCozzi and Carpita.9 Sulfate content was analyzed spectro-\nphotometrically using a barium sulfate (BaSO\n) precipitation\nmethod (barium chloride [BaCl\n] in gelatin), based on meth-\nods developed by Dodgson and Price.10 Finally, cations,\nincluding sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+), and\nmagnesium (Mg+), were determined by flame atomic absorp-\ntion spectroscopy. Table 1 is a summary of the composition\nof UPF and FVF that were used in the preclinical studies in\nthis research.\nCell Culture\nAll human cancer cell lines including HeLa (HPV 16+) and\nSiHa (HPV 16/18+) cervical cancer cell lines, MCF-7\n(ER+/PR+, COMT wild type) and ZR-75 (ER+/PR+,\nCOMT wild-type) breast cancer cell lines, and TOV-112D\n(platinum-sensitive) ovarian cancer cell lines were obtained\nfrom the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC,\nManassas, VA). SKOV-3 GFP-Luc (platinum-resistant)\novarian cancer cell line was obtained from Cell Biolabs, Inc\n(San Diego, CA). The SiHa squamous cell cervical carci-\nnoma, HeLa cervical adenocarcinoma, and the MCF-7\nbreast cancer cell lines were propagated in a media consist-\ning of EMEM. The SKOV\n-GFP-Luc ovarian adenocarci-\nnoma cell line was propagated with media consisting of\nMcCoy's 5a medium. The ZR-75 breast cancer cell line was\npropagated in a media consisting of RPMI 1640, and TOV-\nmedium 199 with 2 mM L-glutamine and Earl's BSS\nadjusted to contain 1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate, 0.1 mM\nnonessential amino acids, 1.0 mM sodium pyruvate, and\n10% FBS.All cell lines were grown in 75-cm2 culture flasks\nin air at 37\u00b0c to 90% confluence. Cell lines used\nfor this study were maintained for less than 15 passages in\norder to prevent major changes in cell line characteristics.\nMetabolism Studies\nDuring the designing and planning of this preclinical\nresearch study, the achievable FVF or UPF human systemic\nplasma concentration data were unavailable to investiga-\ntors. Hence, for all of the metabolism studies, the 0.2 mg/\nmL concentration was selected as an estimate of the clini-\ncally relevant concentration. This was based on the current\nestimated maximum recommended dosage of 3 g total daily\nFigure 1. (A) Chemical structure of FVF. (B) Chemical\nstructure of UPF.\ndose as instructed by the manufacturer, assuming 100% bio-\navailability and using an estimated total blood volume of an\naverage adult of 7 L. However, a recent study by Irhimeh\nand colleagues reported less than 0.6% oral bioavailability\nin human fucoidan pharmacokinetic studies.13 Therefore,\nconcentrations used in these metabolism studies were above\nachievable plasma concentrations in humans so may not\ntranslate to the clinical setting. The concentrations of FVF\nor UPF used in the metabolism studies might be achievable\nin animal models with smaller total volume or in the human\ngut for short-term (2-4 hours) during transit through gastro-\nintestinal tract, but animal plasma concentration of FVF or\nUPF data were also not available.\nPhase I Inhibition Assay. The highest analytical grade avail-\nable chemicals and reagents were used. As mentioned\nearlier, the UPF and FVF were provided by Marinova Pty\nLtd (Cambridge TAS 7170, Australia). All other chemi-\ncals and reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St\nLouis, MO).\nCytochrome P450 enzyme microsomes. The group of iso-\nacquired from BD Biosciences (Gentest) Discovery Lab-\nware (Woburn, MA). The stated total protein content for\nthe isozymes packaged in 0.5 mL aliquots is 5.8 mg/mL in\n100 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) and corresponding\nutilized in accordance with provided Material Safety Data\nSheets and technical bulletins.\nHigh-throughput CYP450 inhibition assays.A validated\nhigh-throughput method for measuring CYP450 inhibi-\ntion method that was provided by BD Gentest was used\nto develop the assay protocol. In brief, the test com-\npounds (UPF and FVF), positive controls (ketoconazole,\nquercetin, quinidine, and sulfaphenazole), and substrates\n(dibenzylfluorescein and 3-(2-(N,N-diethyl-N-methyl-\nammonium)ethyl)-7-methoxy-4-methylcoumarin iodide\n[AMMC]) were used to study this potential inhibition of\nCYP450 substrates.11 The manufacturer's methods were\nused to prepare the common solutions, enzyme/substrate\nmixes, cofactors stocks, and positive control solutions.\nA final cofactor solution was prepared consisting of 1.3\nUnits/mL of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and\n3.3 mM of magnesium ion and then 200 \u00b5L of the cofac-\ntor solution was added in each reaction well of a 96-well\ntiter plate. After the addition of CYP450 enzyme, the\n\u00b5M) and 58.3 \u00b5M of the inhibitor positive control were\nadded to the reaction mixture and serially diluted 1: 3 for\n8 wells. The experimental wells on each plate had either\nthe low or high concentrations of FVF of either 285 \u00b5g/\nmL or 1.300 \u00b5g/mL or low or high concentrations of UPF\nof either 14 \u00b5g/mL or 285 \u00b5g/mL that also was then seri-\nally diluted 1:3 for 8 wells. The reactions were incubated\nwith the addition of \"stopping solutions\" consisting of\n2D6 only) or 2M NaOH solution for all of the other\nCYP450 isoenzymes. In each reaction well, IC\nvalues\nwere used to quantify and report CYP450 inhibition.\nThese data were produced by comparing the metabolism\nduring assay reactions containing varied concentrations\nin the presence and absence of the known positive con-\ntrol inhibitor. The amount of substrate metabolized for\nthe control comparison reactions was determined via\nfluorescence emission detection with FL600 Dual-Band\nplate reader from BioTek Instruments, Inc (Winooski,\nVT). The wavelength measured was at 528 nm (excita-\ntion 485 nm) of fluorescein (metabolite product of DBF\nof 3-(2-(N,N-diethyl-N-methyl ammonium)ethyl)-7-hy-\ndroxy-4-methylcoumarin (AMHC; metabolite product of\nPhase I enzyme induction assay.Cryopreserved\nhuman hepatocytes were obtained from BD Biosciences\n(Gentest) Discovery Labware. The cells were handled\nTable 1.

Hepato-\ncytes were replated using supplemented Hepatozyme\nSFM media (Gibco Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad,\nCA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bio-\nProducts, West Sacramento, CA) and 250 \u00b5M ascorbic\nacid (Sigma-Aldrich). Hepatocytes were then maintained\nin SFM media for the 7-day duration of the study. Pri-\nmary hepatocyte cells were plated into separate 6-well\nCollagen I\u00adcoated plates for the CYP450 induction and\nsubstrate experiments, respectively. The cultures were\nprepared in triplicate for each experimental time point.\nAn ex vivo model of cryopreserved human hepatocytes\nwas used to evaluate the ability of each fucoidan extract, UPF\nenzyme was selected, including diclofenac (CYP450 2D6),\n(CYP450 3A4). The experiment was set up in triplicate using\neach known substrate alone, a control inducer of all 4 CYP450\nisoenzymes, rifampicin 25 \u00b5M (Sigma-Aldrich) with the\nknown substrate, then a low and high concentration of each of\n\u00b5g or 1300 \u00b5g/mL and using known substrates diclofenac\nThe hepatocytes were treated for a total of 72 hours with\neither the control inducer rifampicin or either FVF or UPF\nwith media changes every 24 hours. After 72 hours, rifampi-\ncin or fucoidan products were removed and the appropriate\nsubstrate concentration specific to the CYP450 isoenzyme of\ninterest or specific to the test substrate (fucoidan products)\nwere added. Samples were taken at different time points, start-\nand test sample were set on a 96-well plate and absorbance\nwas read at the appropriate wavelength for the test substrate.\nPhase II Enzyme Inhibition Studies\nGST metabolism inhibition assay.GST activity was evalu-\nated using a slightly modified method described by Man-\nnervik and Guthenberg.12 The assays were carried out in 200\n\u00b5L total volume, 96-well ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) plates\n(Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The reaction of 1 mM\nGSH with 1 mM 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene in the presence\nof 2 \u00b5L human liver S9 fraction (20 mg/mL), diluted in 1 M\npotassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), was measured by UV\nabsorbance on Synergy HT multi-detection microplate reader\nexperimental agents and serially diluted 1:3 for 8 wells. Ethac-\nrynic acid (6 \u00b5M) is a broad inhibitor of GST activity and was\nselected as a positive control inhibitor of GST activity and\nwas added to wells serially diluted 1:3 for 8 wells as well.14\nUGT metabolism inhibition assay.UGT activity was\nevaluated following a method described by Liu and Frank-\nlin.15 Inhibition assays were carried out in 200 \u00b5L total\nvolume, 96-well UV-Vis plates. The 3 primary isoforms\nof UGT associated with drug metabolism were evaluated:\nisoform included estrone (UGT1A3), 1-napthol (UGT1A6),\nand testosterone (UGT2B17). In short, the reaction of 2\nmM uridine 5-diphosphoglucuronic acid (UDPGA) with\neach respective substrate in the presence of 2 \u00b5L human\nliver microsomes (20 mg/mL), diluted in 50 mM potassium\nphosphate buffer (pH 8.0), was measured by UV absorbance\non a FL600 Dual-Band plate reader (BioTek Instruments,\nUGT2B17). UPF or FVF was added as the test/experimen-\ntal agents using either UPF 14 \u00b5g or 285 \u00b5g/mL or FVF\nRemoval of UDPGA was used as a negative control.\nQOR metabolism inhibition assay.QOR activity was\nevaluated using the method described by Benson and col-\nleagues.16 Assays were carried out in 96-well UV-Vis plates\nwith total volume of 200 \u00b5L per well. The reaction mixtures\ncontained 0.7 mg of bovine serum albumin, 25 mM Tris-\nnolindophenol (DCPIP), and control inhibitor, dicoumarol\n10 mM. As with the UGT assay, UPF or FVF was added as\nthe test/experimental agents using either UPF 14 \u00b5g or 285\n1:3 for 8 wells. NADPH was measured by UV absorbance\nreader from BioTek Instruments, Inc.\nCOMT metabolism induction study.The cryopreserved\nhuman hepatocytes obtained from Corning (Gentest Dis-\ncovery Labware) were replated using supplemented\nhepatozyme SFM media (Gibco Invitrogen Corporation)\ncontaining 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bio-Products)\nand 250 \u00b5M ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) in 6-well col-\nlagen-coated culture plates. Cells were allowed to adhere\nfor 8 hours prior to removal of seeding media. Hepatocytes\nwere maintained in un-supplemented hepatozyme SFM\nmedia for at least 24 hours prior to the study being initiated.\nFor the COMT method, primary hepatocyte cells were incu-\nbated with 500 ng/mL 17- estradiol in the presence of UPF\ndans were compared to the control known inducer, folic\nacid 150 ng/mL.17 Estradiol concentrations remaining at\neach time point were determined by employing a validated\nhigh-pressure liquid chromatography assay with ultravio-\nlet absorbance detection according to parameters described\nin the CDER Guidance for Industry Bioanalytical Assay\nMethod Validation detection.18 Briefly, 17--estradiol was\nisolated from spiked hepatozyme media with liquid-liquid\nextraction with n-hexane. Liquid chromatographic separa-\ntion was achieved by isocratic elution on a Waters Bondpak\n(Milford, MA). The mobile phase consisted of an isocratic\nflow of 50:50 deionized water-acetronitrile at a flow rate\nof 1.0 mL/minute and total run time of 15 minutes. The\n17--estradiol peak was positively identified from other\npeaks using UV absorbance at a wavelength of 200 nm.\nAssay had sensitivity with lower limit of detection of 0.05\nUGT metabolism induction study.For the UGT method,\nprimary hepatocyte cells were incubated with 150 \u00b5M\n-naptholflavone 80 \u00b5M. The cultures were maintained\nin duplicate for each experimental time point, including 2\nhours, 6 hours, and 24 hours. To determine UGT induction,\nremaining substrate concentrations in samples were mea-\nsured with FL600 Dual-Band plate reader from BioTek\nInstruments, Inc using UV detection at 230 nm for estrone\nIn Vitro Growth Inhibition Studies\nFucoidan Alone Study.Growth inhibition assays were con-\nducted as previously described.19 Briefly, cells were plated\nat 37\u00b0C for 24 hours. Each of the cancer cell lines were\ntreated with 50 \u00b5L of various concentrations of fucoidan\nextracts, UPF or FVF, starting at 300 \u00b5g/mL for low or\n1300 \u00b5g/mL for high followed by serial dilutions for the\nremaining 9 columns of wells. For the cell growth inhibi-\ntion studies fresh stock solutions were prepared in media of\neach respective cell line for each experiment. Control wells\nhad media alone and blank wells had no cells, drug, or\nmedia. After a 72-hour incubation period, 25 \u00b5L of\nmide (MTT) was added to obtain a final concentration of\n300 \u00b5g/mL, and cells were incubated for 2 hours. Plates\nwere then centrifuged and the supernatant was removed.\nAfterwards, 50 \u00b5L of dimethyl sulfoxide was added to each\nwell and absorbance at 563 nm was measured. The inhibi-\ntory concentration to achieve 50% cell death (IC\n) for each\nfucoidan extract and each cell line were calculated.\nFucoidan Extracts in CombinationWith Selected Chemotherapy\nAgents.Combination agent growth inhibition assays were\ndone using IC\nconcentration of one of the selected chemo-\ntherapy agents including topotecan, gemcitabine, pacli-\ntaxel, carboplatin, 5-fluorouracil, tamoxifen, and letrozole\nhours incubation and then growth inhibitory activity was\nevaluated. The IC\nwas selected to ensure that enough via-\nble tissue was available for immunoblotting and flow\ncytometry experiments. After 72 hours growth inhibitory\nactivity was evaluated as described above for the single\nagent studies. All experiments were done in quadruplicate.\nTo define synergy/additive activity for the in vitro\ngrowth inhibition assays the interaction index was used to\ndetermine antagonism, additive, or synergistic activity as\ndescribed by Tallarida20 was determined with the following\nequation:  = a/A + b/B, where A = dose of drug A alone that\ngives the specified effect; B = dose of drug B alone that\ngives specified effect; a = dose of drug A used in combina-\ntion to achieve specified effect; and b = dose of drug B used\nin combination to achieve specified effect. The interaction\nindex measures drug combination as follows:  value equal\nto one it is additive;  value less than one is synergistic and\n value greater than one is antagonistic.\nIn Vivo Study With Orthotopic Human Cancer\nMouse Models\nThe protocol was reviewed and approved by the\nInstitutional Animal Care and Use Committee prior to ini-\ntiating any animal work. For this study, 240 female nude\nmice, 6 to 8 weeks old, were obtained from Charles River\nLaboratories Wilmington, MA. All the mice weighed\nabout 22 to 26 g and were maintained 5 per cage in spe-\ncific pathogen free (SPF) barrier room, with a temperature\nhad free access to autoclaved food and reverse osmosis\nautoclaved water. The experiment procedures and the han-\ndling of the mice were in strict accordance with the guide\nfor the care and use of laboratory animals. The mice were\n6 cell lines). There were 4 arms of this study: 2 treatment\narm (N = 10 each), no treatment control arm (N = 10), and\na vehicle control arm (N = 10). The treatment arm received\nan oral dose (30.4 mg/kg, in 0.2 mL, gastric gavage) of\nUPF or FVF, which was selected based on estimated\nequivalent total daily dose of fucoidan of 2125 mg/daily in\na 70-kg adult, the control arm received an oral dose of\nautoclaved water (0.2 mL, gastric gavage) per day starting\non day 1 and continued until completion of the study (day\n28). The UPF and FVF were provided by Marinova Pty\nLtd and were prepared to a final concentration of 152 mg/\nmL in deionized purified water once a week and stored in\n2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C for animal studies.\nand injected subcutaneously (subQ), and each mouse grew\none tumor on the dorsal surface.

UPF and FVF at both low and high\nconcentrations showed induction of the CYP450 2D6 pathway.\ncalipers (Mitutoyo, Utsunomiya, Japan) and the IP tumors\nwere imaged under Kodak Imaging Station (Kodak,\nRochester, NY) once in a week, and abdominal girth was\nmeasured by using a measuring tape twice in a week. Blood\nwas collected from facial vein from each group every week\nduring the treatment period, plasma were separated and kept\nin -80\u00b0C freezer to evaluate selected panel of immune mark-\ners including interleukin-6 (IL-6), immunoglobulin G (IgG),\ninterferon-/ (IFN-/), and interferon- (IFN-). Mice\nwere monitored daily for signs/symptoms of morbidity\nincluding but not limited to lethargy, weight loss, anorexia,\nhunching, or any signs of distress. Mice were sacrificed via\nCO\ninhalation followed by cervical dislocation, when tumor\ndiameter was greater than 12 mm2 or if there was greater\nthan a 10% decrease in body weight found during the study\nperiod. At the end of the study all the remaining mice were\nsacrificed. When sacrificed, total tumor burden was deter-\nmined by macroscopic dissection. Immediately after sacri-\nfice, tumors were surgically removed from all mice and\nQuantification of Selected Immune Markers\nA selected panel of immune markers including IL-6, IgG,\nIFN-/), IFN- were evaluated from mouse blood samples\ncollected weekly throughout the treatment. Standard vali-\ndated ELISAassays for the detection of the selected immune\nmarker including IL-6, IgG1, IFN-, IFN-, and IFN-\nwere employed according to respective protocol from the\nmanufacturer (eBioscience, San Diego, CA). For each\nseries of immunomarker determinations, a standard curve\nwas constructed with known concentrations of these mark-\ners. Sandwich ELISAs for the detection of total IL-6, IgG1,\nIFN-, IFN-, and IFN- were performed and plasma con-\ncentrations of these 4 immune markers were calculated\nfrom respective standard graphs.\nStatistical Analysis\nAll experiments were carried out at least in triplicate and\nrepeated if the coefficient of variance was greater than 20%.\nFinal results are described through appropriate summary sta-\ntistics (eg, means, standard deviations, and correlation coef-\nficients). ANOVA was employed to determine differences in\nmetabolism activity for each respective metabolic pathway,\nand Pearson's correlation test was used to evaluate all cor-\nrelations. A paired t test was used to evaluate the viability in\ncontinuous data as appropriate. Results were considered to\nbe significant when P > .05. The program GraphPad Prism\n5.02 (GraphPad Software Inc, San Diego, CA) was used to\nperform the analysis.\nResults\nMetabolism Studies\nHigh-Throughput CYP450 Assays.

The UPF high concentration showed inhibition of the 2C8 and 2C9\npathway. FVF showed inhibition of all 4 enzyme pathways, 2C8, 2C9, 3A4, and 2D6, at both the high and low concentrations.\nCYP450 2D6 pathway was observed when exposed to either\nUPF or FVF at the low and high concentrations.\nPhase II Metabolism Pathways.UPF (low [14 \u00b5g/mL] and\nmL] and high [1300\u00b5g/mL] concentrations) were\nobserved to inhibit or induce the GST, QOR, and UGT path-\nways. In the COMT pathway, the UPF extract exhibited\ninduction of COMT, which was less than the positive con-\ntrol inducer (folic acid). However, the FVF extract exhib-\nited inhibition of COMT pathway (see Table 3).\nIn Vitro Growth Inhibition Activity\nAs anticipated, none of the fucoidan compounds consis-\ntently achieved a concentration with 50% inhibition (IC\n)\nthat was reproducible across all cell lines. We did observe\nslightly more activity with the FVF in 87% of cell lines\ncompared to UPF in 53% of the cell lines across the concen-\ntration ranges. In the screening of UPF and FVF, both fucoi-\ndan extracts appeared to have overall synergistic activity\ngiven in combination with paclitaxel or tamoxifen and addi-\ntive activity given in combination with topotecan (Table 4).\nThere were some cell lines that despite overall antagonistic\nactivity observed still had slight (10% to 15%) increase in\ngrowth inhibitory activity with the combination of fucoi-\ndan/chemotherapy compared to the chemotherapy agent\nalone.\nSingle Agent Animal Studies\nThe animal studies definitely confirmed the safety of both\nUPF and FVF extracts in the presence of cancer. As single\nagent given by mouth once daily, neither fucoidan extract\naffected the growth or growth rate of human cancer ortho-\ntopic mouse models including ovarian cancer cell line\nSKOV\n-GFP-Luc (platinum- resistant; Figure 2A) or TOV-\n112d (platinum sensitive; Figure 2B); or breast cancer cell\nlines MCF-7 (COMT variant; Figure 3A), ZR-75 (COMT\nwild type; Figure 3B); or cervical cancer cell lines HeLa\nIn fact, FVF statistically decreased tumor growth in the\nHeLa (HPV 16+) human cervical cancer mouse model (P <\nhad a statistically significant decrease in growth rate to both\nsupplementation.\nAlthough duration of study was only short duration of 30\ndays, fucoidan extract modulation of immune markers was\nobserved. Daily supplementation with FVF demonstrated a\nstatistically significant improvement in both IL-6 (P < .03)\nand IgG (P < .003) and some nonsignificant increases in\nIFN-/ and IFN- (Table 5). UPF also had some trend in\nimprovement in the panel of immune markers evaluated\nthat did not reach statistical significance.\nDiscussion\nProspective evaluation of the safety of the use of nutritional\nsupplements in the oncology patient population both during\nand off treatment is a priority in the oncology health care\nteam. However, there is limited clinical information avail-\nable, hence utilizing systematic preclinical studies can help\ngain knowledge and perspective on each nutritional supple-\nment. This systematic preclinical evaluation of 2 fucoidans,\nUPF or FVF, for use in oncology included evaluation of both\nphase I and phase II metabolism pathways to determine\npotential for drug/supplement interactions, in vitro single\nsupplement and combination with chemotherapy growth\ninhibition evaluation in a panel of 15 human cancer cell lines\nand finally in vivo single agent studies were completed in 8\nselected human cancer orthotopic models to evaluate impact\non tumor growth as well as confirm immune modulation\nactivity. The phase I and phase II metabolism studies demon-\nstrated that UPF appears to have no potential for drug-sup-\nplement interactions, and FVF showed only limited potential\nof interactions with CYP450 and COMT pathways.\nAdditional studies are warranted to evaluate potential for\nsynergistic activity between fucoidan compounds and pacli-\ntaxel, tamoxifen, and additive activity with topotecan that\nwas observed in the in vitro growth inhibition studies. All 8\nanimal models confirmed both UPF and FVF will not pro-\nmote tumor growth and perhaps in few studies suggested\nmay have some benefit to decrease tumor growth, likely\nTable 3.

FVF low is an inhibitor of the COMT pathway. FVF high resulted in inhibition of GST\npathway and COMT pathway.\nTable 4.

The short-term expo-\nsure of only 30 days in the animal studies did confirm in vivo\nimmune modulation with both UPF and FVF.5\nThis was first study to complete a comprehensive evalua-\ntion of both phase I and phase II hepatic metabolism of UPF\nand FVF to define any potential for drug/supplement interac-\ntions. While there was synergistic activity with tamoxifen\nand paclitaxel in breast cancer cell lines in other studies, this\nwas first study to also observe this in vitro synergistic activity\nin also 6 other cancers including ovarian, endometrial, cervi-\ncal, prostate, hepatic carcinoma, and prostate cancers.21,22\nImmune modulation and potential mechanisms for antican-\ncer activity of the fucoidan compounds has been observed in\nmultiple preclinical studies throughout the literature. For\nexample, Senthilkumar and colleagues recently published a\nsummary review of all the current proposed mechanisms of\nbrown seaweed fucoidans activity against cancer cell growth,\nimmune modulation being cited as mechanism associated\nwith UPF, which was also observed in this study.23 Immune\nmodulation in preliminary human studies has also been con-\nfirmed.13 Based on the findings from this study, the next steps\nwill be to complete preclinical screening to identify the\nFigure 2.

While it is\nunlikely to have any drug/supplement interactions based on\nthe data from metabolism studies presented in this study as\nwell as limited bioavailability observed by Irhimeh and col-\nleagues, traditional pharmacokinetic/safety studies should be\ncompleted prior to proceeding to larger phase II studies for\ndefining efficacy and role of combinations with fucoidans. In\nan initial small study by Ikeguchi and colleagues that evalu-\nated combination of fucoidan with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin\nplus oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) or 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin plus\nirinotecan (FOLFRI), the authors reported less fatigue, abil-\nity to have increased duration of treatment, and longer sur-\nvival in the 10 patients that received fucoidan with\nchemotherapy compared to the 10 patients that had chemo-\ntherapy alone.24 While not statistically significant, this study\nsupports that there is merit in continuing to evaluate and\ndefine the role of supplementation with fucoidans to optimize\nchemotherapy outcomes. A pharmacokinetic/safety study\nevaluating FOLFOX and paclitaxel/carboplatin in combina-\ntion with fucoidan 500 mg twice a day is already underway as\nwell.\nFigure 3. (A) Single agent fucoidan in MCF-7 human breast cancer mouse model. Both fucoidans showed no significant change in\ntumor growth. (B) Single agent fucoidan in ZR-75 human breast cancer mouse model. Both fucoidans showed no significant change in\ntumor growth.\nThe strengths of this study is that it was systematic pre-\nclinical evaluation with in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo stud-\nies evaluating fucoidans, UPF and FVF. Evaluating both\nphase I (cytochrome P450) metabolism and also the phase\nII pathways (GST, UGT, QOR, and COMT) provided\nmore complete information on potential for drug interac-\ntions. Completing the in vitro screening in a diverse panel\nof human cancers allowed the consistency additive/syner-\ngistic activity with paclitaxel, tamoxifen, and topotecan to\nbe demonstrated. Finally, conducting 8 in vivo human can-\ncer orthotropic mouse models demonstrated reproducibil-\nity and reliability of data that showed fucoidans do not\npromote tumor growth rate and perhaps its immune modu-\nlation may contribute to inhibition of tumor growth but\nthat data will need to be confirmed in future human stud-\nies. A definite limitation of this study was the concentra-\ntions of fucoidans selected for the metabolism studies\nwere well above what is clinically achievable based on\nFigure 4. (A) Summary of impact of fucoidan on rate for tumor growth in SiHa human cervical cancer mouse model. Both fucoidans\nshowed no significant change in tumor growth. (B) Summary of impact of fucoidan on rate for tumor growth in HeLa human cervical\ncancer mouse model. FVF demonstrated a decrease in tumor growth. UPF showed tumor growth comparable to vehicle group.\npreliminary pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volun-\nteers.13 There were no metabolism pathway mediated\ninteractions observed at the lowest 14 \u00b5g/mL concentra-\ntion of fucoidans, which is still above plasma concentra-\ntions observed in the human pharmacokinetic study where\nthe maximum concentration achieved (c\nmax\n) was 2 \u00b5g/\nmL.13 Perhaps higher concentrations might be achievable\nin animal models with smaller total volume or in the\nhuman gut for a short term (2-4 hours) during transit\nthrough gastrointestinal tract, but there are currently no\ndata available on concentrations achieved in human gut\nafter oral administration.\nConclusion\nThis comprehensive preclinical evaluation of 2 different\ntypes of fucoidans for use in oncology demonstrated\noverall that both UPF and FVF appear to have limited\npotential for any drug interactions at clinically achiev-\nable concentrations. In the panel of human cancer cell\nlines evaluated, fucoidans did not have inherent cytotox-\nicity activity alone but may have some additive or syner-\ngistic activity with chemotherapy that needs further\nevaluation. Confirmatory animal studies are ongoing to\nevaluate potential with combination of selected chemo-\ntherapy agents. Finally, both UPF and FVF did not nega-\ntively affect tumor growth in animal studies and some\npotential benefit was observed in these studies. Similar\nto other preclinical studies, immune modulation was also\nobserved after short-term exposure to UPF and FVF. In\nconclusion, after evaluating multiple aspects in this\nseries of preclinical studies, fucoidans overall appear to\nbe safe to proceed to be evaluated in clinical studies to\ndetermine benefit of fucoidans alone or in combination\nwith chemotherapy in oncology patients.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared the following potential conflicts of interest\nwith respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle: JAS has received unrestricted research grant from\nMarinova associated with funding the current research and future\nclinical study.
