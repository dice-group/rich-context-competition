Scholars have frequently\nstudied the political agenda-setting effect of the media\n(Dearing and Rogers, 1996), and have found that the media\nagenda systematically influences political agendas; an\nincrease in media attention for an issue leads to an increase in\npolitical attention for the issue (see e.g. Edwards and Wood,\nthus adopt media issues in their political activities. However,\nthe media do not influence all political actors to the same\nextent. Researchers investigating the conditionality of politi-\ncal agenda setting--a research agenda proposed by Walgrave\nand VanAelst (2006)--demonstrate that there are notable dif-\nferences in levels of media responsiveness, both between par-\nties, and between individual politicians within parties (Midtb\u00f8\net al., 2014). Some parties in parliament are more attuned to\nthe media agenda than other parties, and some MPs are more\noften inspired by the media than other MPs.\nWhile the variation between parties has been exten-\nsively addressed and has been accounted for (see Green-\nPedersen and Stubager, 2010; Vliegenthart and Walgrave,\n2011), the heterogeneity on the individual level has not\nsatisfactorily been explained. In particular, the relationship\nbetween politicians' political motivations and their media\nresponsiveness has never been studied. This paper takes up\nthis question, asking: Do politicians' individual political\ngoals affect the degree to which their personal initiatives\nare inspired by the media?\nThe paper contributes to the growing political agenda-set-\nting literature by (partly) explaining the micro level heteroge-\nneity that existing scholarship has so far left unexplained.\nFocusing on the individual level, and particularly on the\nmotives and goals of individual politicians, helps to better\ndefine and understand the exact mechanism connecting the\nmedia agenda with the political agenda. It is individuals, not\ninstitutions or parties, who attend to information and issues.\nBy analyzing in detail who react to the media it can be better\nunderstood why they do so and how the existing, consistent\nmacro level findings about the media's agenda setting power\nare generated. Additionally, by focusing specifically on the\ngoals of individual politicians, the mechanistic approach that\nPolitical elites' media responsiveness and\ntheir individual political goals: A study of\nnational politicians in Belgium\nJulie Sevenans, Stefaan Walgrave, Debby Vos\n Keywords\nPolitical elites, media responsiveness, Parliament, Belgium\nUniversity of Antwerp, Belgium\nCorresponding author:\nJulie Sevenans, University of Antwerp, Sint-Jacobstraat 2, 2000\nAntwerpen, Belgium.\nEmail: julie.sevenans@uantwerpen.be\nResearch Article\n2 Research and Politics \nconsiders the mass media as a powerful actor in its own right\nthat imposes its agenda on politics is avoided. Instead, this\npaper shows that individual politicians, and some more than\nothers, strategically employ the media to realize their goals.\nEmpirical analyses are based on data from a survey with\nnational Dutch-speaking MPs in Belgium. The results show\nthat politicians' individual political goals matter in addition\nto their partisan environment. Concretely, the more an MP\nis focused on party political goals, the higher the usefulness\nof media coverage to realize his/her goals, and hence the\nhigher his/her media responsiveness.\nParty level variation in media\nresponsiveness\nIn contemporary politics, the media play an important\nagenda-setting role. This paper defines the media as the\n`traditional' mass media, both in their old forms (newspa-\npers, television and radio) and in new derivatives (such as\nwebsites from newspapers).1 Large-scale studies in differ-\nent countries have shown that the aggregate-level political\nagenda is influenced by the media agenda (see e.g. Edwards\nWalgrave, 2011). Those studies have addressed the varia-\ntion in media responsiveness between parties. Most impor-\ntantly, they have shown that opposition parties are more\ninspired by media coverage than coalition parties (Green-\nand Walgrave, 2011). The reason lies in the usefulness of\nthe information that the media provide. Political actors do\nnot passively respond to all kinds of information sources;\non the contrary, they actively follow those sources that pro-\nvide information they can employ to realize their political\ngoals (Kingdon, 1973). The literature mentions various,\ntypical coverage characteristics that enhance the usability\nof media coverage for opposition parties, while decreasing\nit for coalition parties.\nIn terms of content, the mass media cover a large variety\nof policy topics. Editors strive for a balanced composition,\ntrying to appeal to a large and diverse audience (Galtung\nand Ruge, 1965). Consequently, media information is gen-\neral rather than specialized. Concerning style, the news\ntends to be negative in tone (Galtung and Ruge, 1965),\nespecially news about politics (Farnsworth and Lichter,\noften focuses on conflict and controversy (De Vreese et al.,\nbility attribution frame', indicating which political actors\nare to blame or to reward for problems in society (Semetko\nand Valkenburg, 2000). And finally, the media regularly\nfocus on the business of politics itself, rather than on sub-\nThese particular characteristics of news coverage--gen-\neral, negative, conflict-rich, responsibility-attributing and\nfocused on the political game--make the coverage especially\nuseful for opposition parties. Their role in parliament is to\ncontrol the government, often via interpellations and parlia-\nmentary questions.2 News coverage gives them potential\nammunition to attack the government (Walgrave and Van\nAelst, 2006). Coalition parties also engage in party politics,\nbut must be careful in this respect because attacking other\npoliticians, especially those from the government, could\nthreaten the stability of the coalition (De Winter and Dumont,\n2006). Accordingly, they often avoid negative, conflict-rich\nand responsibility-attributing media cues. This assumption is\nconfirmed by studies that examine the type of news that poli-\nticians react to most (see e.g. Thesen, 2012), and which find\nthat political actors react most to those messages that they can\nuse in the `attack and defense game' between parties (Green-\nIndividual level variation in media\nresponsiveness\nWhereas differences in media responsiveness between par-\nties are well documented, research into individual level\nvariation is still in its infancy. Only two studies, which both\nrely on elite surveys, specifically asked politicians about\nthe extent to which they personally act upon media cues in\ntheir parliamentary work (see Midtb\u00f8 et al., 2014;Walgrave,\n2008). These studies explain micro level variation by look-\ning at structural features of MPs. Much like the studies of\naggregate political agenda setting, these micro level studies\nfind that opposition MPs are more responsive to the media\nthan coalition MPs are. Men, more than women, are\ninspired by the mass media when taking parliamentary ini-\ntiatives. Some authors think that women are less `media-\noriented' in general (Aalberg and Str\u00f6mb\u00e4ck, 2010).\nFinally, the media are used less by older politicians, who\nhave built up networks and have other sources of informa-\ntion beyond the media to nurture their activities (Midtb\u00f8\nincludes party position (government/opposition), sex, and\nage as control variables in its analysis.\nThis paper goes beyond the well-known structural fea-\ntures of elites and argues that their different goals affect\ntheir varying degrees of media responsiveness; inspired by\nthe literature stating that the usefulness of media coverage\nis key to explain media responsiveness, this argument deals\nwith two individual goals that MPs may have: fighting the\nparty political competition and making public policy. These\ngoals are not exclusive; many politicians probably have\nboth foci simultaneously. This study measures the degree to\nwhich each politician attributes importance to each of the\ntwo goals.\nIn this paper, the MPs who focus mainly on the first\ngoal--engaging in party politics--are called 'party warri-\nors'. In a recent study about legislative roles, Van Vonno\n(2012) describes these MPs as being in `interparty mode',\nviewing politics as an ideological struggle between parties.\nSevenans et al. 3\nParty warriors play the `attack and defense game'. They are\neager to publicly confront political rivals with their incom-\npetence and mistakes. They are not proactively selective:\nthey 'wait and see what crises appear in the media and then\naverage usefulness of media coverage for these MPs is\nexpected to be high. The media cover many issues from\nwhich a party warrior can pick the one that is most suitable\nin the competition. Features such as negativity, conflict and\nresponsibility attributions are useful for attacking other par-\nties. The news has become an important means for these\npoliticians to gauge the `political mood' (Sellers, 2009).\nThose MPs who consider policy making to be their pri-\nority are different from `party warriors'. In line with Searing\ncates' here. These MPs take up governing-related tasks in\ntheir parties; realizing policy goals is crucial to them. Since\ndeveloping bills and amendments is a technical and often\nslow process, it is expected that the quick, general and the-\nmatically diverse nature of media coverage will be less\nusable for these MPs. Davis, who interviewed British MPs\nabout the role of the media in their work, found indeed that\n'although many MPs listed the news media as an important\nsource of information for their jobs, it was not usually\nregarded as a source of information on specific policy mat-\nassumption may seem to contradict the literature that policy\nmakers strategically use the news media to promote their\nideas and put their policy initiatives on the agenda of their\ncolleagues (Davis, 2009), or that policy makers consciously\nlaunch initiatives when there is a lot of media attention for\nthe issue, because it creates a `window of opportunity' to\nBut, in those instances, the media determine the timing of\nan initiative taken by a policy maker, or they serve as a tool\nfor promotion, rather than as a source of inspiration.\nWhereas party warriors can be more re-active--since stra-\ntegic political discussions are volatile and can follow the\nquick, daily rhythm of the news production--and can thus\nbe inspired by media coverage, the information-seeking\nbehavior of policy advocates is more long-term, pro-active,\nand topic-focused. It is likely that policy advocates typi-\ncally use other sources to determine their issue agenda.\nIndividual MPs probably do not define their political\ngoals fully autonomously. Their goals are determined by\ntheir own preferences, but also by the broader context in\nwhich they operate. It is likely that MPs from the opposi-\ntion are generally more focused on party politics, while\nMPs from the majority attribute greater importance to pol-\nicy making. Parties may also impose a division of labor on\ntheir MPs, assigning some the task to engage in war with\nthe other parties, while asking others to focus on policy.\nThe party and individual level are thus interwoven. This\npaper claims that individuals adapt their media responsive\nbehavior contingent on their goals, their roles, and how\nthey are embedded in the partisan structure. Two hypothe-\nses are tested:\nHypothesis 1: The more an MP is focused on party polit-\nical goals, the more he or she will be responsive to the\nmedia.\nHypothesis 2: The more an MP is focused on policy\nmaking goals, the less he or she will be responsive to the\nmedia.\nData and methods\nThese two hypotheses are tested using data from a survey\nwith Belgian, Dutch-speaking national MPs. The survey,\nadministered on iPads, is part of a series of face-to-face MP\ninterviews conducted by the authors and their collaborators\nMPs participated, leading to a response rate of 86%, which\nis exceptionally high for elite research. Each interview took\napproximately one hour and was scheduled beforehand.\nMost interviews took place in the MP's office in Parliament\nor in his/her hometown.\nThe dependent variable (media responsiveness) is based\non item (a) of the following survey question:\nOf the initiatives you personally raised in Parliament last year\n(e.g. bills, written and oral questions), roughly what percentage\nwere inspired by the following?\n(a) The media;\n(b) Interest and action groups;\n(c) Meeting with individual citizens;\n(d) Personal experience;\n(e) Within the party (e.g. leadership, research center);\n(f) Other.\nThe six items add up to 100% for each politician, so this\nstudy's dependent variable is a proportional measure. Using\na proportion--and not an absolute number of initiatives\ninspired by the media--allows MPs with different parlia-\nmentary activity levels to be directly compared. Moreover,\nit is believed that MPs are better able to estimate the rela-\ntive importance of the media in their work, than they are\nable to precisely count their media-based initiatives in\nabsolute terms, which would require they recall each indi-\nvidual initiative. This measure is limited, as it does not take\nthe importance of the initiatives into account--some are\nmore consequential and require more resources than others.\nHowever, the main interest here lies neither in the type of\ninitiative nor in its importance, but in the source of inspira-\ntion, regardless of other factors.\nThe independent variables measuring MPs' political\ngoals are constructed based on measures in the same sur-\nvey. The question used is the following:\n4 Research and Politics \nWhat features of information make you take action (e.g. ask a\nstaff member to follow up on it, write a press release, and so\non)? Please indicate for the following features how much they\nmatter to you (on a scale from 0 to 10; 0 = does not matter at\nall; 10 = matters very much):\n(a) Can help me realize my policy goals;\n(b) Can be used to generate negative attention for another\nparty.\nItem (a) measures the extent to which an MP is focused\non policy making goals--this is believed to be straightfor-\nward indicator of the concept. Item (b) is used to assess the\ndegree to which an MP focuses on party political goals. It is\nonly a partial indicator. For instance, having party political\ngoals could also imply promoting an individual's own party.\nYet, it is believed that this study's indicator captures the\nunderlying concept of the party warrior reasonably well,\nespecially in the light of its theoretical conceptualization,\nwhich characterizes party warriors primarily as MPs play-\ning the `attack and defense game'.\nBased on the official website of the Belgian federal\nParliament3 three additional features of each MP were\nretrieved: sex; age; and party membership (government/\nopposition). Descriptive statistics of all variables can be\nfound in Table 1.\nThe data suggest that the media are, on average, the\nmost important source of inspiration for MPs; 23 percent of\ntheir parliamentary initiatives are inspired by the media,\nMPs say. As was expected, the share of initiatives inspired\nby the media is larger for opposition MPs (26%) than for\ncoalition MPs (19%). The standard deviation of 11 in both\ngroups, however, shows that there are considerable differ-\nences between MPs within parties. There is a good deal of\nindividual level variation that this paper will try to account\nfor by looking at the goals of individual politicians.\nAs discussed above, it is anticipated that politicians'\ngoals are partly determined by the context in which they\noperate, namely their party. A t-test shows that opposition\nMPs focus slightly more on party politics than coalition\nrelationship between being a coalition MP and focusing on\npolicy goals is not significant (t = -0.06; p = 0.95). It is clear\nthat party membership does not fully explain the individual\ngoals of politicians; there is plenty of variation within\nparties.\nTo test the two hypotheses, a linear regression analysis\nis performed. Some readers may consider this to be prob-\nlematic--this study's dependent variable, media respon-\nsiveness, refers to percentages (always between 0 and 100),\nwhile the predictions of a linear model could go beyond\nthose bounds. Therefore, an alternative model is also run\nfollowing the procedure for proportional dependent varia-\nbles as suggested by Papke and Wooldridge (1993)4; the\nresults are highly similar and the predictions of the two\nmodels are nearly identical. To simplify interpretation, this\npaper reports the results of the simple linear regression\nmodel below.\nResults\nThe results of the analyses are shown in Table 2. In spite of\nthe small N (73), different variables appear to have a sig-\nnificant effect on media responsiveness. Most interestingly,\nMPs' goals matter. The importance an MP attributes to\n`party political goals' has a positive and significant effect\non media responsiveness, corroborating H1: party warriors\nuse the media more often. The effect of `policy making\ngoals' goes in the expected direction, as well, but the nega-\ntive coefficient is not significant (p = 0.65). H2 cannot be\nconfirmed.\nWith respect to the control variables, the effect of party\nposition is significant. Parliamentarians from opposition\nparties are more responsive to media than MPs from the\nmajority. It is interesting to compare models 1 and 2 in this\nrespect. The coefficient of being in an opposition party\ndecreases when adding political goals, indicating that the\nindividual political goals partly soak up the effect of party\nposition, though not entirely. Individual goals matter on top\nof party membership. Media responsiveness is significantly\nhigher for younger compared to older MPs. The third con-\ntrol variable (female) does not yield significant results;\nmale MPs are not more responsive to media than female\nMPs. These results confirm what is already known about\nTable 1. Descriptive statistics.\nVariable N Mean Standard deviation Minimum Maximum\nSevenans et al. 5\nvariation in media responsiveness, but they add an impor-\ntant new factor: politicians' individual political goals.\nAdding goals to the model leads to a substantial increase\nmatter. They account for an additional part of the variation\nthat could not be explained by previous studies.\nFigure 1 visualizes the size of the effect of the impor-\ntance of party political goals on media responsiveness.\nThe predicted probabilities show that, keeping all other\nvariables in the model at their means, MPs who state that\ngenerating negative attention for other parties is very\nimportant (score for `Party political goals' is 10), base\nalmost twice as much of their parliamentary initiatives (31\npercent vs. 17 percent) on the media compared to MPs\nwho attribute no importance at all to these party competi-\ntion-related aspects of politics (score for `Party political\ngoals' is 0).\nConclusion and discussion\nThis paper investigated individual level variation in media\nresponsiveness by Belgian political elites. Descriptive anal-\nyses showed that the media provide MPs with important\ninformation--on average, 23 percent of all parliamentary\ninitiatives are inspired by the news--but that not all MPs\nare equally reactive to media. Most importantly, politicians'\nindividual political goals matter. While MPs who focus\nmore on policy making goals do not use the media signifi-\ncantly less, focusing on party politics does make MPs sub-\nstantially more reactive to the media. Furthermore, as is\nshown in previous studies, the context in which parliamen-\ntarians operate is crucial as well. Opposition MPs are\ninspired by the media more often than coalition MPs.\nIndividual goals matter on top of the party context.\nThe differential usefulness of media coverage for vari-\nous political actors explains this study's findings. On the\nparty level, the typically general, negative, conflict-rich\nand responsibility-attributing media coverage is much more\nrelevant for opposition parties than for coalition parties. As\nthis paper has shown, this is not merely a consequence of\nthe underlying differences in individual goals. Opposition\nparty members--even those who are not focused on party\npolitics--are more reactive to media than government MPs.\nAn explanation could be that they have fewer alternative\nsources for information. Compared with government MPs,\nwho for instance can get inside information from the cabi-\nnet and from `their' ministers, opposition members are\n`information poor' and have to rely on the media to be\ninformed and to get inspired. Within parties, there is a divi-\nsion of labor as well, leading to differences in media\nresponsiveness on the individual level. The more MPs con-\nsider engaging in the party political game to be important,\nthe higher the usefulness of media coverage, and the higher\ntheir media responsiveness.\nTable 2.

Predicted probabilities.\n6 Research and Politics \nIn this study, it was assumed that motivations and posi-\ntion are largely stable and affect MPs' information seeking\nbehavior, rather than vice versa (for a similar argument see\nSearing, 1991). Technically speaking, however, this study's\ncross-sectional design only demonstrates the co-occurrence\nof the two phenomena and a causal relationship cannot be\ndemonstrated. It is interesting to reflect on the inverse\nmechanism as well. It is possible that politicians partly\ndefine their goals based on what the incoming media infor-\nmation is suited for, and that their goals and their media\nresponsiveness reinforce each other; panel data--which are\ndifficult to collect since political elites are being dealt with\nhere--would be interesting to further investigate the exact\ncausal mechanism.\nIn any case, this study's findings have implications for\nthe relationship between media and politics; it was observed\nthat the party-political rather than the policy-making\naspects of politics are sensitive to agenda influences from\nthe mass media. This is good news for those who think\nmedia influence on policy-making is undesirable because\npolicy decisions need to be based on a long-term vision\nrather than on the news of the day. Alternatively, media\nresponsiveness in politicians might be viewed as a good\nthing, as it ensures that the topics politicians care and\ndevelop policies about are relevant to what happens in soci-\nety. It is seen that especially party warriors guarantee this\nresponsiveness vis-\u00e0-vis media priorities.\nUsing a survey design has limitations--though it cer-\ntainly has advantages as well. The main drawback is the\npossibility of misperception; politicians may not be able to\nadequately assess the contribution of the media to their\npolitical initiatives (Van Aelst and Walgrave, 2011). On the\nother hand, perceptions are relevant; it is how politicians\nperceive reality, and not reality itself, that structures politi-\ncians' behavior (Maurer, 2011). A second disadvantage of\nsurveys is the influence of social desirability on the answers.\nIn this study, the item gauging MPs' use of information\n`that can be used to generate negative attention for other\nparties' may to a certain extent be prone to biased answers.\nDespite these limitations, it is thought that this survey is an\nappropriate method--it is simply impossible to directly\nobserve political goals, for instance--and produces valid\nresults.\nThe current study deals with one country only: Belgium.\nFuture research should examine whether the same results\nare obtained elsewhere. Since this study's findings largely\nresemble the results of Midtb\u00f8 et al. (2014), who conducted\na similar study with MPs of fifteen European countries,\nBelgium can likely be considered a representative case for\nEuropean countries. Media responsiveness appears to be, at\nleast partly, a function of individual politicians' goals.\n"
