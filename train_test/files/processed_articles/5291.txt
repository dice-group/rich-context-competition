    "abstract": "Abstract\nMental ill health accounts for 13\nper cent of total global disease burden with predictions that depression alone will be\nthe leading cause of disease burden globally by 2030. Poor mental health is consistently associated with deprivation,\nlow income, unemployment, poor education, poorer physical health and increased health-risk behaviour. A plethora\nof research has examined the relationship between physical activity and mental wellbeing; however, the influence of\ncommunity-wide gamification-based physical activity interventions on mental wellbeing, to the authors' knowledge, is yet\nto be explored. In view of this paucity of attention, the current study examined the relationship between physical activity\nand mental wellbeing pre/post a community-wide, gamification-based intervention. The findings revealed that increases in\nmental wellbeing were significantly greater for the least active prior to the intervention, and a strong, positive correlation\nbetween increase in physical activity and increase in mental wellbeing was observed.\n",

Mental health is defined as a state of wellbeing in\nwhich every individual realises his or her own potential,\ncan cope with the normal stresses of life, can work produc-\ntively and fruitfully and is able to make a contribution to\nher or his community (World Health Organization and\nCalouste Gulbenkian Foundation, 2014).

A study by Richards and Abbot\n(2009) provides strong evidence for the severe impact that\npoor mental health at childhood could have on adulthood.\nThe authors analysed longitudinal data from three British\nsignificant association between emotional problems at ado-\nlescence and increasing severity of emotional problems in\nadulthood. Adolescents with emotional problems were three\ntimes more likely to have worsened symptoms than those\nwithout emotional difficulties. These data also revealed sig-\nnificant associations between early mental health problems\nand poor educational achievement, chronic economic inac-\ntivity, lower earnings, marital problems, teenage parenthood\nand contact with the criminal just system.\nPsychosocial outcomes of positive mental\nwellbeing\nIn contrast to the detrimental impact of poor mental health,\npositive mental wellbeing has been associated with a breadth\nof biopsychosocial benefits.According to Chida and Steptoe\n(2008), positive psychological wellbeing is associated with\nreduced cardiovascular mortality in healthy and disease\npopulations. Elsewhere, Keyes (2007) reported that `flour-\nishing' adults who were `completely mentally healthy'\nreported the fewest absenteeism, the healthiest psychologi-\ncal functioning (including low helplessness, clear goals in\nlife, high resilience and high intimacy), the lowest risk of\ncardiovascular disease, the lowest number of chronic physi-\ncal diseases with age, the fewest health limitations of activi-\nties of daily living and lower health care utilisation. More\nrecently, subjective wellbeing has been associated with\ngreater health and longevity, income, productivity and\norganisational behaviour and a range of psychosocial bene-\nfits (including sociability, altruism, reduced risk taking and\ngreater future time perspective) (De Neve et al., 2013).\nDeterminants of mental wellbeing\nSocial inequalities are at the forefront of inequalities in\nmental health and wellbeing. A recent report published by\nthe World Health Organization and Calouste Gulbenkian\nFoundation (2014) outlined greater exposure and vulnera-\nbility to adverse social, economic and environmental cir-\ncumstances as predisposing certain population subgroups\nto developing mental health problems. The report elabo-\nrated that such inequalities start before birth and accumu-\nlate throughout life (Allen et al., 2014). It has been argued\nthat income inequality is a fundamental driver of social\nexclusion in England (Piachaud et al., 2009). The report\npublished by the World Health Organization and Calouste\nGulbenkian Foundation (2014) outlined that a universal\napproach must be taken to reduce health inequalities and\nimprove mental health and wellbeing, arguing that inequal-\nities in mental health exist along a social class gradient and\nas such, targeted services will likely miss most of these\ninequalities. Factors that influence mental health and well-\nbeing operate at the individual, family, community, struc-\ntural and population level, and therefore, a multi-sector\napproach is required to address the scale of the problem.\nEnhancing social cohesion is a potential avenue for\nbridging the health and social inequalities experienced\nthroughout the world. A socially inclusive society is defined\nas one where all people feel valued, their differences are\nrespected and their basic needs are met so they can live in\ndignity (Cappo, 2002). An early literature review by\nKawachi and Berkman (2001) highlighted the well-estab-\nlished relationship between strong social relationships and\nenhanced mental wellbeing, which has been supported by\nmore recent evidence (Cacioppo and Cacioppo, 2014;\nSantini et al., 2016). Social relationships influence habits\nwhich may be detrimental to health and wellbeing, they pro-\nvide a social support mechanism, they can act to mitigate\nstress and they provide symbolic purpose and influence\nphysiological responses to psychological distress and harm\net al., 2010). As such, social inclusion policies may be a\npromising avenue for at least mitigating the detrimental\nimpact of social inequalities on subsequent shortfalls in\nexamined population level data from 10,653 adults and dis-\ncovered that poor mental health was significantly associated\nwith area-level income deprivation and low social cohesion\nafter adjusting for individual risk factors. Furthermore, the\nauthors found high social cohesion significantly modified\nthe association between income deprivation and mental\nhealth. However, no causal inferences can be made from\nthis cross-sectional study; an alternative explanation could\nbe that communities with individuals possessing greater\nmental health could be more socially connected.\nPhysical activity and mental wellbeing\nPhysical inactivity is the fourth leading risk factor for\nglobal mortality, attributed to 6per cent of deaths globally\nreduces the risk of developing breast cancer by up to 75per\ncent, cardiovascular and heart disease by up to 49per cent,\ndiabetes by up to 35per cent and colorectal cancer by up to\nper cent. However, effective interventions to reduce\npopulation levels of physical inactivity, which extend\nbeyond `standing' or `take the stairs' campaigns, are sparse\n(Bauman, 2016). Furthermore, a recent Cochrane system-\natic review concluded insufficient evidence for current\nmulti-component community-wide interventions citing\nscalability is a major weakness with many previous inter-\nventions failing to reach a substantial portion of the com-\nThe evidence base for the relationship between physical\nactivity and mental wellbeing is well established (see\nMason and Kearns, 2013). For instance, evidence has con-\nsistently shown that physical activity is positively associ-\nated with increased mental wellbeing (Bize et al., 2007;\nCerin et al., 2009); however, such reviews have focused\noverly on `frequent' physical activity (Mason and Kearns,\n2013). Furthermore, a frequent limitation of research exam-\nining the relationship between physical activity and mental\nwellbeing is the abundance of small sample size investiga-\ntions (Penedo and Dahn, 2005). While a plethora of research\nhas examined the relationship between physical activity\nand mental wellbeing (cf. Biddle and Asare, 2011; Fox,\nnity-wide gamification-based physical activity interven-\ntions on mental wellbeing is yet to be explored and with\ngrowing concerns of large geographical variations in men-\ntal wellbeing at a population level (Arora et al., 2016), the\npotential of this approach warrants further exploration.\nThe current study\nThe purpose of the current study was to explore the rela-\ntionship between physical activity and mental wellbeing by\nfocussing primarily on those who are inactive. The study\nsought to examine the cross-sectional relationship between\nphysical inactivity and mental wellbeing from a large rep-\nresentative sample size, to explore the impact of a commu-\nnity-wide gamification-based physical activity intervention\non mental wellbeing and to examine changes in mental\nwellbeing in relation to changes in physical activity before\nand after a community-wide intervention.\nMethodology\nIntervention\n`Beat the Street' aims to increase physical activity using\ngamification components. Battery powered radio-fre-\nquency identification (RFID) scanners called `Beat Boxes'\nare located at half mile intervals throughout a town/city and\nresidents receive 10 points each time two consecutive `Beat\nBoxes' are touched with a RFID card within 1\nhour.\nResidents compete to see which schools, community groups\nand individuals can achieve the greatest physical activity\nover the course of the game period and highest scorers are\nrewarded with prizes. For example, vouchers for sports\nequipment are provided to schools, community groups are\nrewarded with active lifestyle prizes (such as bicycles),\n`lucky tap' prizes offer instant gratification and there is an\noverall prize for total miles travelled where money is\ndonated to a local charity. A 7-month period follows the\n6-week competition and involves trained individuals sup-\nporting residents into long-term behaviour change by\ndirecting them into suitable physical activity opportunities\nfor their age, competency level and demographic, while\nalso working with the local authority to develop and intro-\nduce bespoke physical activities if a gap in provision is\nidentified. For the purposes of the current study, a total of\n20 Beat Boxes were situated throughout Stranraer, Scotland,\ndetailed overview of the intervention has been provided\nelsewhere (see Coombes and Jones, 2016).\nParticipants\nPrior to the intervention, residents of Stranraer, Scotland,\nwere encouraged to register their RFID card online which\nenabled their accumulated points to be allocated to a team\n(school/community group).

Mental wellbeing was measured using the\nWEMWBS (Tennant et al., 2007).The long-formWEMWBS\nis a 14-item scale with five response categories, ranging from\n`None of the Time'to `All of the Time', with scores summed\nto provide a single score of between 14 and 70. The\nWEMWBS has been shown to demonstrate high levels of\ninternal consistency, reliability and construct validity\nof fit index (GFI)\n=\n0.91 and adjusted goodness of fit index\n=\nlevel data in Scotland have interpreted `good'mental wellbe-\ning as a WEMWBS score of over one standard deviation\nabove the mean of 51.05, `average' mental wellbeing as a\nWEMWBS score of within one standard deviation of the\nmean and `poor' mental wellbeing as a WEMWBS score of\nmore than one standard deviation below the mean (see\nBraunholtz et al., 2007). The items are all worded positively\nand cover both feeling and functioning aspects of mental\nwellbeing (Braunholtz et al., 2007). Examples of questions\nincluded in the scale are `I've been feeling optimistic about\nthe Future'and `I've been feeling close to other People'. The\nWEMWBS is widely regarded as a valid and reliable tool for\nmeasuring mental wellbeing in diverse populations (Stewart-\nOverview of analyses\nBaseline data were subjected to a one-way between sub-\nject's analysis of variance (ANOVA) to test differences in\nmental wellbeing across self-reported days of physical\nactivity, and a Spearman's rank-order correlation was used\nto examine the relationship between physical activity and\nmental wellbeing. Separate within subject's ANOVAs were\nused to test for differences in physical activity and mental\nwellbeing between baseline and follow-up. Finally, a\nPearson's product moment correlation was run to examine\nthe relationship between changes in mental wellbeing and\nchanges in physical activity between baseline and\nfollow-up.\nProcedure\nPrior to the competition, residents were given a RFID card\ndistributed via schools, council facilities, libraries, leisure\ncentres, general practice clinics and promotional events. To\nparticipate in the competition, residents were required to\nactivate their RFID card via an online portal. During regis-\ntration, participants were invited to complete a number of\noptional and mandatory questions, including a range of\nsociodemographic questions, a validated physical activity\nquestionnaire, a retrospective 1-week travel survey and a\nvalidated self-report measure of mental wellbeing.\nImmediately following the end of the 6-week competition,\nall registered participants who agreed to be contacted and\ndid not unsubscribe from being contacted during the com-\npetition period (72.5%) were sent a link to a follow-up sur-\nvey via email. A \u00a350 prize draw was offered to incentivise\nfollow-up survey completion and a total of four reminders\nwere sent to participants.\nResults\nComplete responses on mental wellbeing and physical\nactivity at baseline were collected from n=1686 people,\nwith varying levels of self-reported physical activity (see\nFigure 1).\nCross-sectional analysis\nData were subjected to a one-way between subject's\nANOVA, with a between factor of self-reported days of\nphysical activity.

This investigation explored the\nrelationship between physical inactivity and mental wellbe-\ning using baseline data from a large representative sample\nsize and studied the influence of a community-wide physical\nactivity intervention on mental wellbeing. The analysis\nrevealed a substantial and statistically significant difference\nbetween participants who reported 0days of physical activity\nin the previous week, compared to those who reported all\nother activity levels. There was a statistically significant\nincrease in mental wellbeing from baseline (pre-interven-\ntion) to follow-up (post-intervention). Furthermore, the\nincrease in mental wellbeing was significantly greater for\nthose reported 0\ndays of physical activity pre-intervention\nwhen compared to all other activity groups. Additionally, a\npositive correlation was found between change in physical\nactivity and change in mental wellbeing from baseline to\nfollow-up.\nThe current study provides three novel contributions to\nthe current evidence base for the relationship between phys-\nical activity and mental wellbeing.

These findings provide support for the use\nof community-wide interventions for increasing levels of\nmental wellbeing at a community level and suggest that\nsuch approaches may be particularly effective for raising\nFigure 1.

Previous research\nhas provided strong evidence for the potential of social\ncohesion for enhancing individual wellbeing (Kawachi and\nBerkman, 2001). Social relationships influence health hab-\nits, provide social support, can mitigate stress, can eluci-\ndate a sense of purpose and alter physiological responses to\ndirectly examining the relationship between social cohe-\nsion and mental health has found high social cohesion sig-\nnificantly modified the association between income\ndeprivation and mental health (Fone et al., 2007); however,\nno causal direction could be established due to the cross-\nsectional design of this study; an alternative explanation\ncould be that communities with individuals possessing\ngreater mental health could be more socially connected.\nA hypothesis which stems from these findings is that\nsocial cohesion may mediate the relationship between physi-\ncal activity and mental wellbeing, with increased levels of\nsocial cohesion elucidating a subsequent increase in mental\nwellbeing, or vice versa. The Beat the Street intervention\nwhich occupied the focus of the current study provided\nnumerous components which may have increased levels of\nsocial cohesion. First, the intervention operates at a commu-\nnity-wide level and is branded to the local environment, in\nthis instance, Stranraer, which may have functioned to con-\nnect people to their local area. Second, the programme relies\non the competitive nature of teams (whether school or com-\nmunity group based) which could have functioned to\nstrengthen existing social networks or enable individuals\nwithout connection to an existing social group to become a\npart of one (for instance, their child's school, their workplace\nor a local charity). Finally, the intervention offered 20 local\npoints of common interest, the `Beat Boxes', and a common\nscans on just 20 Beat Boxes, it is highly likely that paths\nwould have crossed on numerous occasions with familiar\nand unfamiliar neighbours and the game itself would have\noffered a convenient topic of discussion, such as what team\npeople are a part of, how many points they have acquired and\nhow many miles they have travelled. However, due to the\nnovelty of both the intervention and the theory of behaviour\nchange, gamification, these hypotheses are speculative rather\nthan scientific and warrant further investigation.\nStudy limitations\nThere was a high drop-out rate for the second element of\nthe study which examined changes in physical activity\nand mental wellbeing over time; it could be that those who\nremained in the study could have been a unique popula-\ntion compared to those who did not provide post-interven-\ntion data. Furthermore, women were more likely to engage\nin the intervention, provide baseline data and provide\nfollow-up data post-intervention; therefore, the findings\nof the current study could be gender specific. This study\nalso relied wholly upon self-reported measures of both\nphysical activity and mental wellbeing, and therefore, the\nhonesty by which participants disclose such information\nis questionable. However, the study utilised measurement\ninstruments which have been validated and used exten-\nsively at population level across the country of origin of\nthe sample.\nFuture directions\nThe Beat the Street intervention which formed the focus\nof the current study offers a novel way to promote physi-\ncal activity and other wider psychosocial benefits, such\nas individual mental wellbeing and community cohe-\nsion. However, due the novelty of the intervention and\nits underlying theoretical basis, gamification, little is\nknown about the precise mechanisms which support (un)\nsuccessful implementation. As noted above, three poten-\ntial, unique components are provided which may explain\nthe findings of the current study; however, these are\nhighly speculative. More research is needed which\nexplores these elements in greater detail and such future\ncontributions may be more suited to qualitative\nmethodology.\nConclusion\nThis study provides further support for the relationship\nbetween physical activity and mental wellbeing and high-\nlights the substantial differences in mental wellbeing\nbetween the least and most active individuals. The findings\npresented above provide preliminary evidence for the\npotential role of community-wide, gamification-based\nphysical activity interventions in addressing mental health\ninequalities. Future research should explore the potential\nmechanisms which underpin the relationship between\nphysical activity and mental wellbeing and seek to identify\nthe extent to which social or psychological factors best\nexplain this association.\n"
