    "abstract": "Abstract\nWhile participation in public life is generally agreed to be important for governance and citizenship, scholars focused on\ntalk-oriented participation (in the Tocquevillian tradition) suggest that there is a participation deficit in the American public\nsphere. Qualitative analysis of responses from 60 interview respondents about whether or not they are participants in four\nprominent American debates suggests a novel explanation for this apparent deficit: Persons whom analysts classify as non-\nparticipants may believe that they are already participating, because their understanding of participation is not based on public\npolitical talk. Moreover, individual responses about participation vary substantially by debate, suggesting that what counts as\nparticipation is more fluid for respondents than for analysts. Implications for public sphere studies are discussed.\n",

Robert\nPutnam (2000) suggests that the rich associational life that\ncharacterized the America of Tocqueville's time has unrav-\neled, loosening the social connections that support the public\nsphere. As a recent Contexts article put it, \"The ties that bind\nare fraying\" (McPherson, Smith-Lovin, & Brashears, 2008).\nSimilarly, Fung and Wright (2001) claim that efforts to shrink\nthe \"affirmative state\" have constrained representative insti-\ntutions and limited opportunities for egalitarian participation\nin public life. And Lichterman (2005) shows how existing\ncivic organizations (such as church groups) sometimes limit,\nrather than enable, participation in the public sphere.\nThe Tocquevillian concern about a general participation\ndeficit is reinforced by studies focusing on how persons\nengage (or not) in public political talk. Eliasoph (1998)\nshows that even persons who are already members of civic\norganizations nevertheless actively practice \"avoiding poli-\ntics.\" Overwhelmed by the scale of political problems, and\ndiscouraged by the confrontation and division on display in\npublic debate, members avoid \"political\" talk to preserve\n\"civic etiquette\" in their associational groups. Similarly,\nMutz (2006) finds that participation decreases when expo-\nsure to alternative political perspectives increases, as people\nsolve the problem of \"mixed political company\" by avoiding\nconfrontation altogether. Americans seem to respond to\nproblems of public debate by \"producing apathy\" and mov-\ning political talk to private life (Eliasoph, 1998).\nAt the same time, a growing interdisciplinary literature in\nempiricalpublicspherestudiessuggeststhattheTocquevillian\nconcern may be misplaced.

Evans1\n Keywords\nparticipation, individual, opinion, public sphere, civil society\n2 SAGE Open\nabout political issues, the alternative account suggests that\nthere is no standard set of activities called \"participation\"\nthat people do (or not). To take a recent example, Perrin\n(2006) includes \"thinking and talking\" as \"citizenship activi-\nties\" along with \"voting, running for office, demonstrating,\nor signing petitions\" (p. 19). But, obviously, sometimes\n\"thinking and talking\" are not actually \"citizenship activi-\nties.\" Rather, thinking and talking, like many of the things\nthat people already do, are variably directed toward political\nends (see, for example, O'Neill, 2010). Likewise, the differ-\nent activities in which people engage are variably public\n(e.g., \"talking politics,\" see Gamson, 1992). And in practice,\nactivities of all sorts are variably treated as \"participation\" by\nsocial scientists, by political elites, and by the alleged partici-\nspective, there cannot be an overarching participation deficit,\nbecause there is no consistent version of \"participation\" to be\nevaluated across all cases.\nThese two positions on participation seem irreconcilable.\nFor the Tocquevillians, increasing \"participation\" in the form\nof public political talk is important for creating durable trust\nrelations that extend into other domains and foster develop-\nment of valuable social capital in communities (Putnam,\n2000). But if \"participation\" describes a contingent and vari-\nable configuration of activities, conditions, and descriptions\nthat reflect relations of power in a particular time and place,\nthen efforts toward increasing public political talk may rein-\nforce existing inequalities of access and power (Fraser, 1990;\nMouffe, 1999), provide opportunities for private interests to\ncapture the processes of public political talk for their own\nand ignore possibilities to foster democracy as it is actually\nThis tension between competing ideas about participation\nraises two basic questions for sociologists of the empirical\npublic sphere. First, how can empirical studies of the public\nsphere distinguish some configurations of politics, publics,\nand activities as \"participation\" and not others? Second, and\nimportantly for the historical foundations of sociology, how\ndoes a more complicated understanding of participation con-\nnect to classic Tocquevillian concerns about declining public\npolitical talk, if at all?\nRather than attempt to answer these questions through\ntheoretical elaboration, this research note instead examines\nfirst-person accounts from actualAmerican persons speaking\nabout participation. In a recent study of public debates over\nstem cell research, human origins, environmental policy, and\nthe origins of sexuality, 60 respondents answered questions\nabout whether or not they saw themselves as participants in\neach debate. The majority describe participation in terms\nconsistent with the talk-oriented participation reported by\nTocqueville. Many respondents saw themselves as conven-\ntional participants (e.g., arguing in discussion groups). And\nmany respondents did not see themselves as participants,\ndescribing how they \"produce apathy\" (e.g., by avoiding\npolitical talk at church, see Eliasoph, 1998).\nBut a distinct alternative version of \"participation\"\nemerged as respondents spoke of participation in terms of\nwhatever activities they were already doing (e.g., recycling),\neven though such activities are inconsistent with the talk-\noriented participation described in other categories of\nresponses. Notably, however, this version of participation\nonly surfaced for some issues, and not for others, even for the\nsame respondents, suggesting that what counts as participa-\ntion is issue-specific, rather than universal or even\nrespondent-specific.\nThese empirical findings, though limited in scope, sug-\ngest a way forward in reconciling the two approaches.\nExisting public debate sets boundaries around which activi-\nties count as participation for each issue, with different issues\nproducing different configurations of legitimate participa-\ntion. But sociological understandings of conventional par-\nticipation and \"producing apathy\" are useful for evaluating\nparticipation on particular issues, wherein there is general\nagreement among actors about what counts as participation.\nIn the concluding discussion, I consider the implications of\nthese insights for future research.\nMethod\nData Collection\nThe data for this research note come from a larger research\nproject comparing \"ordinary\" understandings of public\ndebate with the actual behavior of elected officials and other\nprominent media figures over four issues where religion and\nscience are both involved: human origins, environmental\npolicy, stem cell research, and the origins of sexuality. These\nissues were selected in advance not only because of their\nreligion and science content but also because they have sig-\nnificant public policy implications (unlike, for example,\ndebates over the bodily resurrection of Jesus Christ). Beyond\nthese common features, the four issues vary in many respects,\nand would be expected to have varying personal significance\nto different respondents depending on their life experiences,\ninterests, and preferences.\nTo collect data on what \"ordinary\" persons think about\nthese debates, I conducted multipart, semi-structured inter-\nviews with 62 individual respondents across two different\nlocations in the United States (see sample description below).\nAs part of these interviews, I asked a series of open-ended\nquestions to verify that respondents were not elected officials\nor media figures, as including such non-ordinary persons\nwould confound the comparison. I began discussion of each\nissue with a set of open-ended questions asking respondents\nto describe the debate for me as they understood it, and as\nthey discussed it with other people (see Table 1). I then\nasked, \"Do you see yourself as participating in this debate?\"\nAsking such open-ended questions allowed respondents to\nexpress their own understanding of debate and how they\nmight, or might not, be participating (see Luker, 2008;\nMartin, 2011). Those responses provide the data for this\nresearch note.\nGiven the consistent finding in the existing literature that\nthere is an apparent participation deficit in American public\nlife, I initially expected that most responses to the question\n\"Do you see yourself as participating in this debate?\" would\nbe \"No.\" But from the earliest interviews, it became clear\nthat respondents actually often saw themselves as partici-\npants in various public debates, though in different ways and\nfor different reasons. I recorded the surprising initial\nresponses in field notes as an interesting theme for later anal-\nysis, but left the interview schedule unchanged to maximize\ncomparisons across all interviews. Interviews ranged in total\nlength from 49 min to just over 2 hr, though the amount of\ntime spent on individual components of each interview var-\nied substantially. All interviews were digitally recorded and\nprofessionally transcribed.\nData Analysis\nAfter completing interviews with all respondents in the sam-\nple, I counted a total of 187 valid responses to the participa-\ntion question. In two interviews, the word \"participating\"\nwas not used, due to interviewer error, so I omitted those\nrespondents from this analysis. The number of responses\n(187) greatly exceeds the number of respondents (60)\nbecause respondents could (and often did) answer the ques-\ntion for multiple issues in each interview. However, not every\nrespondent answered questions about every issue, so the\nnumber of responses is less than the theoretical maximum.\nitive. Contrary to what reports of participation deficit might\npredict, in a (slight) majority of instances, respondents saw\nthemselves as participants in public debates. I returned to the\ntranscripts to understand how respondents saw themselves as\nparticipants (or not) in public debate. Using generally\naccepted methods of open and axial coding (see Babbie,\n1998), I manually analyzed the open-ended responses from\ninterview transcripts to identify important categories across\nrespondent answers and to expose the conceptual relation-\nships that underpin those categories.\nSample Description\nRespondents were recruited using a snowball approach\nseeded with convenient contacts in purposive target groups.\nWith the limited target size of the sample (approximately 60\nrespondents), the goal was not to achieve statistical represen-\ntativeness, as a random sample might not actually capture\nenough different cases to derive useful theoretical insight.\nInstead, I sought to maximize range (Weiss, 1994). Because\nof the religion and science content of the selected debates, I\nformally enforced heterogeneity of religious affiliation and\noccupation, but the sample also ranged usefully in other\ncategories.\nRespondents ranged in age from 18 to 79 years (average\n40). The sample (with invalid respondents omitted) included\na Southern California city of more than 1.5 million residents\nthat is known for high-tech industries and military presence.\nThe remaining 25% came from a South Florida city of fewer\nand retirement destination. The overall ratio of White to non-\nWhite respondents (about 3 to 1) approximately matched\nthat of the U.S. general population, though non-White racial/\nethnic composition varied by site. All respondents had com-\npleted high school, though postsecondary education ranged\nfrom none to PhD, with most respondents having taken at\nleast some college courses and a majority having earned AA/\nAS or BA/BS degrees. In short, though the sample is not\nintended to be generalizable, it resembles the U.S. general\npopulation along many dimensions (but not education).\nNevertheless, this is a qualitative analysis, and I do not\nattempt general quantitative inferences in what follows.\nResults\nRespondents spoke of participation in multiple and some-\ntimes overlapping ways. First, respondents varied in how\nthey described what sorts of talk counted as debate in the first\nplace. For example, some responses described debate as\n\"argument\" with \"people [who] hold different opinions,\"\nespecially in the halls of Congress or the radio airwaves,\nwhile others said that debate was \"informed conversation,\"\n\"teaching classes,\" or just \"chatting\" in the workplace,\nchurch, or classroom. Second, respondents varied in what\nactivities counted as participation. For example, some\ndescribed participation as \"writing letters,\" \"raising money,\"\nor, more vaguely, \"political activism,\" while others talked\nabout activities such as \"conversation,\" \"giving opinions,\"\n\"learning,\" or \"considering issues.\" Third, and most obvi-\nously, respondents varied in whether or not they saw them-\nselves as participating in a given debate, with \"yes\" or \"no\"\nanswers often (but not always) leading to additional\nexplanations.\nTable 1. Opening Interview Question Sequence For Each\nDebate.\n1 Can you briefly describe the . . . debate as you see it?\n2 Where did you learn about . . . ? Can you be specific?\n3 Do you talk to other people about . . .

Responses in each category share a dis-\ntinct configuration of ideas about debate, activity, and\nparticipation. Note that these are not simply linguistic dis-\ntinctions over the meaning of the word \"participation,\" but\nbroader categories that encompass understandings of partici-\npation, debate, and activity for specific issues in the public\nsphere. I call these three categories \"conventional participa-\ntion,\" \"producing apathy,\" and \"personal participation.\"\nWhile responses in the first two categories are consistent\nwith the Tocquevillian understanding of participation as pub-\nlic political talk, responses in the third category are not,\nbecause they describe participation as not public, not politi-\ncal, or, most commonly, not talk. Moreover, while responses\nfit into these three categories, respondents themselves did\nnot. Approximately 75% of respondents who answered ques-\ntions for multiple issues actually switched from one qualita-\ntive response category into another depending on the issue.\nIn relating these findings below, I use pseudonyms to facili-\ntate reporting, but this should not be taken to mean that a\nrespondent only returned responses in the category in which\nthey are quoted.\nConventional Participation\nThe first category of responses combines the elements of\nTocqueville's civic ideal. Responses in this category usually\ndescribe debate as interactive, ranging in setting from small\ndiscussion groups to electoral politics, and sometimes con-\nflictual. Relevant activities typically include holding and\ngiving opinions, especially in small-group settings, as well\nas several varieties of activism, such as raising and donating\nmoney, voting, and advocating for causes. Importantly, all\nresponses in this category contain a \"yes\" reply to the partici-\npation question. Arthur typifies this category in his answer\nabout participation in human origins debate:\nI have been voting liberal for quite a long time, but I still joined\nthe Rebuild the Party group and wanted to contribute my ideas.\n[T]hey were just collecting all kinds of ideas for what is wrong\nwith the Republicans.And so I did go online and I did participate\nin those debates. You know, by participate I mean, I added\ncomments to the issues that I had something to say on. And yes,\nI basically did tell them like, \"Look, drop the young earth\ncreationists.\"\nResponses in this category usually involve advocating\nactively, generating conversations, and otherwise seeking\nout ways to form and shape opinions about public issues. For\nexample, Lewis said, \"I've been in the discussion groups that\nwe have [at church] because I'm definitely in favor of stem\ncell research [and] I know people that would seriously ben-\nefit.\" Tamara talked about how she just completed a research\nproject designed to present her position on the origins of\nsexuality, and also recently \"went to the AIDS Walk\" and\n\"talked to all sorts of people about [sexuality].\" Josefina\n\"contribute[s] $10.00 a week to Human Rights [Campaign,\nan advocacy group] just because I believe it's a human rights\nissue in the way people are treated.\" In short, conventional\nparticipation means actively contributing to public discus-\nsion of political issues, through a variety of means and in a\nvariety of public settings.\nProducing Apathy\nA second category of responses is consistent with Eliasoph's\nResponses in this category often describe debate as interac-\ntive, occurring in a variety of settings, and largely conflic-\ntual. Respondents discuss taking part in a variety of social\nactivities, such as chatting with friends, family, and cowork-\ners, and they often belong to civic groups.\nHowever, respondents do not understand this activity to\nbe participation. When discussing participation explicitly,\nrespondents downplay social activities or talk about individ-\nual activities instead, such as \"considering issues,\" \"listen-\ning,\" or \"hav[ing] an opinion.\" This category is characterized\nby the deliberate avoidance of public debate.All responses in\nthis category contain a \"no\" reply to the participation\nquestion.\nResponses in this category often describe a reluctance to\nargue or give opinions in public, describing such activities as\npointless or even counterproductive. Daniela, for example,\ndoes not \"feel like my voice is shaping the debate across the\ncountry.\" Raymond describes stem cell debate as \"tense and\nunproductive.\" And Judith's response typifies those who\nsimply feel unable to contribute usefully:\nNo, I don't seek out this one, probably because I don't personally\neven know a lot about it. I don't even know how long it's been\naround. So I kind of feel like I'd just be hurting the cause to a\ndegree to branch off on something that I'm completely wrong on\npotentially.\nResponses in this category especially emphasize avoid-\nance of the confrontation and conflict that is seen to charac-\nterize debate. Penny, for example, describes how she has\n\"kind of resigned from the debating society.\" Similarly,\nMorgane says that she is \"kind of a weenie\" and avoids\nconfrontation. Morris emphasizes that he is \"not a\ncrusader.\"\nThis work of \"producing apathy\" (Eliasoph, 1998) contin-\nues even when respondents recognize that participation\nmight be seen as desirable. As Phoebe put it, \"I am so unin-\nvolved. It's horrible.\" Yet responses consistently indicate\nthat the benefits of avoiding debate outweigh the benefits of\nparticipation. Oscar sums it up as \"You know, no. I'm a live\nand let live guy.\" In short, producing apathy means recogniz-\ning participation as public political talk, but consciously and\nactively not participating, and instead retreating from con-\nflictual public debate, even when otherwise involved in civic\nor social activities.\nPersonal Participation\nWhile the previous two categories account for a majority of\nresponses, analysis also revealed a surprising third category\nof participation that is distinct from public political talk.\nMuch like the previous two categories, responses in this cat-\negory described debate as public, interactive, and sometimes\nconflictual. Also, like the \"producing apathy\" category,\nresponses emphasized individual activities such as \"having\nan opinion,\" \"listening,\" \"paying attention,\" and \"setting an\nexample.\"\nBut surprisingly, respondents nonetheless saw themselves\nas participants in debate, even when they shared a view of\npublic debate as conflictual or confrontational, and even\nwhen they described their activities in terms more consistent\nwith producing apathy rather than conventional participa-\ntion. Responses in this category all contained a \"yes\" answer\nto the participation question.\nI call this category \"personal participation\" to capture this\nunique response to (perceived) bad debate. For the responses\nin this category, respondents produce an alternative version\nof participation that is not necessarily public, not necessarily\npolitical, and definitely not talk-oriented. This allows them\nto understand themselves as participants, even though their\nactivities fall outside the realm of public political talk. For\nexample, Zoe sees herself as participating by relocating\ndebate from the conflictual public sphere to her individual\nthoughts:\nWell, I participate more in my own mind. I have some friends\nwho are definitely against homosexuality, and it's not worth it\nfor me to bring it up because I know I'm not going to change\ntheir minds and so it'd create a rift between us and so. But it\ndefinitely gets me thinking about things.\nResponses in this category largely describe participating\nin public debate as such individual activity rather than talk or\ninteraction. For example, Sterling describes his participation\nin environmental policy debate by recounting how he rides\nhis bicycle to work, recycles, and minimizes water usage,\nconcluding that \"I pay attention to those things, and my\nbehavior is modified by my attention to them.\"\nBut even when responses in this category acknowledge a\nbroader realm of public talk, they uniformly emphasize indi-\nvidual readiness or preparation to talk, rather than starting a\nconversation or advocating a position to others. Holly prides\nherself on being ready to give an opinion \"if asked.\"\nLikewise, Barry describes himself as \"aware of arguments,\"\nwhile Crystal sees herself as \"willing to share [her] perspec-\ntive.\" Grace emphasizes that she does not usually talk to\npeople, but is instead a \"living testimony.\" Similarly, Chantal\nseeks to \"set an example\" but does not seek out arguments.\nIn short, personal participation means (re)imagining indi-\nvidual activities such as opinion formation or recycling as\nlegitimate modes of participation in their own right, thereby\nturning what might otherwise be apathy over conflictual\npublic debate into participation.\nSwitching\nPerhaps more surprising than the emergence of the \"personal\nparticipation\" category is the finding that even though\nresponses fit into categories, respondents generally do not.\nNor are the three categories of responses evenly distributed\nacross debates. Instead, what counts as participation varies\nby debate, both at the level of individual respondents and at\nthe aggregate level of debate. At the individual level, many\nrespondents switch qualitative response categories depend-\ning on the debate being discussed. Of 54 respondents who\nanswered the question for multiple issues, fewer than 25%\ngave consistent (either positive or negative) responses across\nissues.\nIn some cases, the same activity is seen as participation in\none debate, but not in another. For example, Sienna consis-\ntently describes \"talking to friends and family\" as relevant\nactivity across debates, but only counts this activity as par-\nticipation for environmental policy debate, and not for stem\ncell research or human origins debate. But in most cases of\nswitching, respondents simply understand the relationship\nbetween debate, activity, and participation differently for dif-\nferent debates. For example, in environmental policy debate\nAnita participates conventionally, \"saying what I think\" to\nfriends and strangers alike, but when it comes to debate over\nthe origins of sexuality, she produces apathy by avoiding par-\nticipation in debate in favor of \"private talk.\"\nGiven the diversity of the issues under discussion, in the-\nory this individual switching could be explained in multiple\nways. Respondents might simply have different levels of\ncommitment to different issues. For example, when discuss-\ning sexuality, respondents often used personal examples\nfrom relationships with family or friends. If \"the personal is\npolitical\" (Hanisch, 1970), then modes of participation\naround this issue might be understood differently than modes\nof participation around issues that do not connect to personal\nexperience and interests in the same way. Another explana-\ntion is that individual switching reflects the context of dis-\ncussion. For example, in most instances respondents claimed\nto talk about issues with friends and family, if they claimed\nto talk about an issue at all. But when religious respondents\nreflected on who they talked to, they more frequently named\nfellow churchgoers and coreligionists for the issue of sexual-\nity than for other issues. For those respondents, it makes\nsense that modes of participation in a church setting might be\nunderstood differently than modes of participation in other\nsettings.\nIssue Variation\nIndividual switching between responses from the same\nrespondent is noteworthy. But at the aggregate level of\ndebate, it is apparent that different debates have different\npatterns of \"participation\" across respondents. Even when\nissues do not necessarily provoke a personal response, and\neven when they do not share a common discussion context\n6 SAGE Open\n(such as church), debates for each issue tend to be character-\nized by a distinct combination of activities that count as par-\nticipation. Whether or not they see themselves as\nparticipating, respondents tend to associate some activities,\nand not others, with participation in debate over a given\nissue.\nFor example, in discussing stem cell research debate,\nrespondents typically understand participation to mean\n\"being informed,\" \"talking to friends and family,\" \"giving an\nopinion,\" and occasionally some form of \"political activism\"\nsuch as \"protest\" or \"going to rallies.\" Whether or not respon-\ndents see themselves as participating, they recognize that\nthese are the activities that constitute participation in stem\ncell research debate. By contrast, in discussing debate over\nenvironmental policy, respondents typically understand par-\nticipation to mean either individual choices that they make,\nsuch as \"changing light bulbs,\" \"preserving things in good\nshape,\" and \"recycling,\" or, to a much lesser extent, formal\npolitical activity such as voting. Whether or not respondents\nsee themselves as participating, they recognize that these are\nthe activities that constitute participation in environmental\npolicy debate.\nWhat counts as participation for each debate is not exclu-\nsive. Sometimes activities (e.g., \"giving an opinion\") are\nconsidered participation for several issues. And it is not sim-\nply that some debates are seen as public issues while others\nare seen as private issues. For example, neither \"being\ninformed\" nor \"changing light bulbs\" are especially public\nactivities in their own right. But note that these shared\nnotions of \"participation\" are sharply different with regard to\nthe public sphere. In the case of stem cell research, \"partici-\npation\" generally involves the conventionally understood\npublic sphere. But for debate over environmental policy,\n\"participation\" generally means personal activities that\nbypass the conventionally understood public sphere\naltogether.\nSo, while there are individual variations and exceptions,\nthe overall pattern across debate is of distinctive groups of\nactivities that are (together) considered to be participation\nfor each issue. On one hand, this is not surprising, as public\ndebates over particular issues have distinctive histories,\nunique trajectories, and characteristic language that shapes\nhow debates can unfold. But on the other hand, it is surpris-\ning to see how these distinctive features manifest in respon-\ndent understandings of their own participation. Certainly\nwhether or not individuals see themselves as participating\npartly depends on the debate under consideration. But more\nfundamentally, what can count as participation at all appears\nto vary by debate. Respondents do not consistently mobilize\na universal reference definition for participation and evalu-\nate their own activities accordingly. Instead, each debate is\ncharacterized by a distinctive range of acceptable forms of\nparticipation, from which respondents make sense of their\nown activities and respond within the constraints of each\ndebate.\nDiscussion\nThis research note has reported novel findings about partici-\npation from a recent qualitative study of multiple public\ndebates. Two clear findings emerge. First, conventional par-\nticipation and \"producing apathy\" are empirical categories\nthat surface only for particular issues in which participation\nis understood as a particular configuration of political\nengagement and public activities (especially public talk).\nSecond, each issue sets the boundaries for what counts as\nparticipation. Taken together, these findings suggest a way\nforward for evaluating participation deficit in empirical pub-\nlic sphere studies.\nThe obvious implication of these findings is that the\nTocquevillian understanding of participation as public politi-\ncal talk should not be considered universal or even general.\nIn one sense, the qualitative evidence here suggests a reason\nthat public political talk might actually be in decline. Perhaps\nAmericans do not participate (in public political talk) because\nthey already think that they are participating (through vari-\nous individual activities).\nBut the deeper implication is that concerns about declin-\ning participation need to account for a variety of views of\nparticipation. Instead of starting from a universal\nTocquevillian definition of participation as public political\ntalk, then judging the failure of Americans to engage in pub-\nlic political talk as participation deficit, it makes more sense\nto start from the empirical case and judge the success or fail-\nure of Americans to participate based on what counts as par-\nticipation in that empirical case. At a minimum, future\nresearch into (apparent) participation deficit in American\npublic life should not simply treat participation as obvious\nand universal, but should first answer the question, \"What\ncounts as participation here?\"\nDespite potential misdirection, the Tocquevillian concern\nis hardly unfounded. These findings suggest that it should be\nmultiplied. Each issue and debate may well have its own ver-\nsion of participation, and therefore its own version of partici-\npation deficit, to examine. In this study, what counts as\nparticipation (and therefore what counts as participation defi-\ncit) varies, even for the same respondent, depending on the\nissue under consideration. This finding aligns usefully with\nrecent research, suggesting that the qualities of a particular\nissue set the horizon of possibility for how persons might par-\nticipate in debates about that issue (Perrin & Vaisey, 2008).\nFuture research with a much larger and more representative\nsample would allow exploration of differences between per-\nsons and issues regarding what counts as participation and\nparticipation deficit. Such research might usefully distinguish\nbetween effects of individual characteristics and effects of\ndebate structure, and might identify patterns of participation\nacross issues that are not visible in this limited study.\nRegardless of sample size, future research should also\nexplore how inequalities of participation are multidimensional\nin ways that are not reducible to the individual qualities,\nattributes, preferences, or activities of (non-) participants.\nWhen different versions of participation are seen as more or\nless legitimate, what counts as participation at all may be a\nsource of inequality in its own right. And if such legitimacy\ndepends on the constraints of the issue under debate rather\nthan (or in addition to) the efforts of individual citizens, then\nthe possibilities for alternative and more equitable forms of\nparticipation may also be constrained.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nData collection supported by grants from the Society for the\nScientific Study of Religion and the Religious Research Association.\nReferences\nBabbie, E.
