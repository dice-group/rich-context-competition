Because of the\nhigh costs of examination surveys, much of the surveil-\nlance of obesity is based on self-reported height and\nweight data, particularly at the state and local level. A\nnumber of studies have reported the validity of self-\nreported weight and height and BMI computed from them\nin populations of European extraction in the US and else-\nwhere [8-19]. A recent report noted lower validity of self-\nreported hypertension in Mexican Americans than in non-\nHispanics [20]. However, data are lacking on the validity\nof self-reported obesity data in the growing Hispanic\nAmerican population.\nTherefore a study was done to test the null hypotheses that\nthere is no association of ethnicity with the validity of BMI\nor \"overweight or obesity\" determined from self-reported\nheight and weight and that the estimated measure of asso-\nciation of ethnicity with validity of self-reported over-\nweight or obesity is not confounded by age, gender,\neducation, marital status, region, smoking, and health sta-\ntus in the American population. Data on a large, multi-\nethnic, national sample of adults from the Third National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III)\nwere examined.\nMethods\nThe Third National Health and Nutrition Examination\nnationwide multi-stage probability sample of 39,695 per-\nsons from the civilian, non-institutionalized population\naged 2 months and over of the United States excluding\nreservation lands of American Indians. Mexican Ameri-\ncans and African Americans were oversampled. Of these,\nthe plan, sampling, operation and response have been\npublished as have procedures used to obtain informed\nconsent and to maintain confidentiality of information\nDemographic data, years of education completed, medi-\ncal history including self-assessed health status and\nbehavioral information including smoking history were\ncollected by household interview. Participants chose race\nand ethnicity categories from a card with categories\nincluding Mexican American (MA)[21]. Later in the\nhousehold interview, interviewers asked, \"How tall are\nyou without shoes?\" (inches) and \"How much do you\nweigh without clothes or shoes?\" (pounds). This occurred\nbefore they invited participants to take part in an exami-\nnation and told them they would be measured and\nweighed.\nExaminations were carried out in a mobile examination\ncenter. Technicians measured height to the nearest 0.1\ncentimeter, weight to the nearest 0.01 kg, as described in\ndetail elsewhere [21-23]. Body mass index was computed\n(BMI = weight/height2, kg/m2). Obesity was defined as\nBMI >= 30.0 kg/m2. Overweight or obesity was defined as\nBMI >= 25.0 kg/m2 [5]. Extensive descriptive data on\nheight, weight, BMI, and obesity prevalence have been\npublished elsewhere and will not be duplicated here [23-\nStatistical analysis\nsons under age 20y, 268 pregnant women, and persons\nwith missing height or weight by self report or examina-\ntion, 15,025 remained for this analysis. Self-reported\nheight and weight were available for over 90% of persons\nwith measured height and weight data. For stratified anal-\nysis, a cut-point of 60+ was used because persons 60+\nwere oversampled. Weighted descriptive statistics and\nmeasures of association were computed using the SAS\n[27-29]. The number of true positives (TP), false positives\n(FP), true negatives (TN) and false negatives (FN) were\nused to calculate sensitivity = (TP/(TP+FN))100, positive\npredictive value (PPV) = (TP/(TP+FP))100, specificity =\n(TN/(TN+FP))100, and predictive value negative (PVN) =\n(TN/(TN+FN))100. The BMI difference (error) was com-\nputed by subtracting the self-reported value from the\nmeasured value. Multivariate linear regression was used\nfor models with BMI difference as a continuous depend-\nent variable. All models controlled for age in years. All sta-\ntistical testing and variance estimation were performed\nusing the PROC REGRESS procedure for regression mod-\nels in the SUDAAN system, which takes the complex clus-\nter design of the survey into account [30,31].\nResults\nTable 1 compares prevalence of overweight or obesity\n(BMI >= 25 kg/m2) based on BMI computed from self-\nreported height and weight with that based on BMI com-\nputed from measured height and weight. In women, prev-\nalence is consistently and substantially underestimated by\nself-report data, most markedly among MA both in abso-\nlute and relative terms. This was also true of MA men. For\nother men, no consistent difference was seen. Table 2\nshows estimated prevalence of obesity (BMI >= 30 kg/m2)\nby self-report versus measurement. Prevalence is consist-\nently underestimated by self-report, the gap being greater\nfor MA than for other women, but similar for MA and\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nother men. The gap was greater in women than men but\nvaried little with age.\nTables 3 and 4 show test characteristics for the classifica-\ntion of overweight or obesity based on BMI calculated\nfrom self-reported height and weight by age, gender and\nethnicity. Sensitivity was similar in non-Hispanic\nEuropean Americans (EA) and non-Hispanic African\nAmericans (AA) but much lower in MA. Sensitivity was\nalso lower in persons aged 60 years and over than < 60\nyears and in women than men. The highest sensitivity was\nin younger EA men (93%) and the lowest in older MA\nwomen (69%) (Table 3). PPV was similar across ethnic\ngroups. It was higher in older persons and women. PPV\nwas highest in older EA women (98%) and lowest in\nyounger AA and MA men (89%).\nSpecificity was highest in EA and similar in AA and MA\n(Table 4). It was higher in women than men and in older\nthan younger men, but varied little with age in women.\nThe highest specificity was in older EA women (98%) and\nthe lowest in younger MA men (82%). In men, PVN was\nsimilar in EA and AA but much lower in MA within age\ngroups. It was higher in younger than older men. In\nwomen, PVN was highest in EA, intermediate in AA and\nlowest in MA. It was higher in younger than older women,\nand lower than in men among AA and MA, but not EA\nwomen. The highest PVN was in younger EA women\n(91%) and the lowest in older MA women (51%).\nThe effect of smoking status, a possible effect modifier, on\nsensitivity of overweight or obesity based on self-reported\nheight and weight was examined (Appendix Table A1, see\nAdditional file 1). No consistent effect was seen in men. In\nwomen, sensitivity tended to be slightly higher in younger\nTable 1: Prevalence of overweight or obesity defined as body\nmass index >= 25 kg/m2) calculated from self-reported versus\nmeasured height and weight by gender, age, and ethnicity:\nNHANES III.(weighted)\nEthnicity\nMen\nWomen\nEA, Non-Hispanic European American, AA, Non-Hispanic African\nAmerican, MA, Mexican American\nTable 2: Prevalence (percent) of obesity defined as body mass\nindex >= 30 kg/m2) calculated from self-reported versus\nmeasured height and weight by gender, age, and ethnicity:\nNHANES III.(weighted)\nEthnicity\nMen\nWomen\nEA, Non-Hispanic European American, AA, Non-Hispanic African\nTable 3: Sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) of\noverweight or obesity defined as body mass index >= 25 kg/m2\ncalculated from self-reported height and weight by gender, age,\nand ethnicity: NHANES III.(weighted)\nEthnicity\nMen\nWomen\nEA, Non-Hispanic European American, AA, Non-Hispanic African\nAmerican, MA, Mexican American, PPV, positive predictive value\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nnon-smokers than in smokers, but higher in older smok-\ners than non-smokers, the difference being large only\namong older Mexican American women (smokers 82%,\nThe percentages not overweight by self report (BMI < 25\nkg/m2) with measured BMI >= 25 kg/m2, i.e. false\nnegatives for overweight or obesity, among men and\nwomen by age, smoking and ethnicity were examined\n(Appendix Table 2, see Additional file 1).

The pattern is similar to that for overweight or\nobesity. A few exceptions are the similar sensitivity and\nPVN but lower PPV in MA men compared to other men.\nThe mean difference between self-reported and measured\nBMI was greater in Mexican Americans (men -0.37,\nwomen -0.76 kg/m2) than in non-Hispanic EA (men -\ndifference between self-reported and measured BMI as the\ndependent variable and MA ethnicity as the exposure\nvariable and controlling for demographic variables or\ndemographic variables plus smoking and health status,\nMA ethnicity was a significant predictor of BMI difference\n(Table 7).\nAn examination of mean differences between measured\nheight and self-reported height indicated that MA men\nAA men 1.16 cm taller than measured.

Under-reporting of weight\nkg; 60+, 0.28 kg. So underestimates of overweight preva-\nlence in each group of women was due primarily to under-\nreporting of weight at younger ages and both to over-\nreporting height and under-reporting weight at older ages.\nDiscussion\nOverweight/obesity is one of the leading preventable\ncauses of death in the United States and most industrial-\nincreases in US obesity prevalence among children and\nadults compared to earlier surveys, it was widely recog-\nnized that an \"epidemic\" was occurring [23-26]. Therefore\nmonitoring of the prevalence of obesity by interview sur-\nveys, such as the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)\nand the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System\n(BRFSS), which rely on self-reported data, have assumed\neven greater importance than previously [34]. Yet, all cur-\nrent guidelines for the diagnosis and management of\nobesity are based on measured height and weight.\nOver-sampling of the MA population and availability of\nmeasured as well as self-reported height and weight data\nin NHANES III made it possible to evaluate the ethnic var-\niation in validity of self-reported data. NHANES III data\nshow that using self-reported data produces consistent\nunderestimates of the prevalence of overweight and obes-\nity (BMI >= 25 kg/m2) in MA by up to 21 percentage\npoints and of obesity (BMI >= 30 kg/m2) by up to 14 per-\ncentage points (Table 1). Criteria for deciding whether SR\ndata are to be considered valid will depend on the appli-\ncation and on a number of factors including statistical test\ncharacteristics and expert judgement as discussed at length\nelsewhere [35]. However, these data suggest that self-\nreported data for MA are not sufficiently valid for use in\nproducing such estimates and are suspect for etiologic\nresearch. Further research is needed determine the appli-\ncability of these findings to data from telephone inter-\nviews or self-completed questionnaires.\nAt a mechanistic level, the important underestimate of\nBMI and hence overweight and obesity prevalence in\nNHANES in women was due primarily to under-reporting\nof weight at younger ages and both to over-reporting\nheight and under-reporting weight at older ages. Possible\nexplanations for under-reporting of weight in women\nhave been discussed [8-19]. In MA women and men, these\nmay include recall bias and lack of information because of\nno recent measurements at home or by health care provid-\ners. This is important for both weight and height, since\nstature declines with age in older persons by up to 2 cm\nper decade after age 30 [8]. Lack of access to scales and\nhealth care and/or lack of utilization of either may be due\nto barriers such as cost, transportation, language or\ncultural factors. Poorer validity of self-reported hyperten-\nsion has been noted in MA, perhaps for similar reasons\n[20]. Further, if obesity and short stature are seen as\nsocially undesirable, a conscious or unconscious tendency\nto under-report body weight and over-report height may\noccur even if true weight and height are known. On the\nother hand, MA women have been reported to be less\nlikely to perceive themselves as overweight and more sat-\nisfied with body size than non-Hispanic EA women in\nsome, but not all studies [36-39]. Specifically in NHANES\nIII, participants were asked, \"Do you consider yourself\nnow to be overweight, underweight, or about the right\nweight?\" Hispanic women and men were more likely to\nunder-assess their overweight status than non-Hispanic\nEA; e.g. 31% of overweight Hispanic women said they\nTable 7: Adjusted regression coefficients (SE) of Mexican American ethnicity (yes/no) as a predictor of difference of measured and self-\nreported BMI by gender in NHANES III\nVariable N Demographic-\nAdjusted*\n95% CI Demographic-and\nhealth-adjusted+\nCI, confidence interval\n*adjusted for age (y), education < 12 years (yes/no), marital status (married/single), region (South vs other), metropolitan residence (yes/no).\n+Adjusted for the above plus smoking status (smoker/nonsmoker) and poor self-reported health (yes/no)\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nwere \"about the right weight\" compared to 14% of non-\nComparisons with previous reports\nNHANES III is one of the largest studies to provide popu-\nlation-based data on the validity of prevalence estimates\nbased on self report and one of the first to provide such\ndata for Mexican Americans. Two previous reports were\nbased on a nationally representative sample of US adults.\nOne used NHANES III data to assess the effect of age on\nvalidity of self-reported data [8]. Under-reporting of\nheight and consequently BMI bias was higher above age\n60 than below. However, data from all ethnic groups were\ncombined. The present report demonstrates important,\nconsistent ethnic differences between MA and other\ngroups. Patterns of reporting error in weight by gender\nand age were similar in NHANES II and III [8,9]. A non-\nsignificant effect of race (\"white\"/\"black\") on reporting\nbias for both weight and height was observed in NHANES\nII. In European and Australian adults, height was over-\nreported and weight under-reported, producing under-\nestimates of BMI and obesity prevalence [15-19]. An\nexception was the under-reporting of both weight and\nheight in Scotland leading to BMI and prevalence esti-\nmates slightly higher than from measurement [10]. Brazil-\nian adults reported height and weight with small errors\nthat differed by gender [11]. In studies of American ado-\nlescents, height was over-reported and weight and conse-\nquently BMI and obesity prevalence under-reported [14].\nThe latter two studies did not describe ethnic variation.\nOne report indicates that correction equations do not\neliminate systematic error in self-reported BMI [40]. Com-\nparisons of self-reported and measured BMI in etiologic\nresearch was beyond the scope of the present paper [41].\nAmong these studies, self-reported height and weight\nwere obtained by in-person interview in several\nmore than one of these methods for self-reported data.\nQuantitative comparisons of error magnitude of self-\nreported data among studies are not possible due to vary-\ning designs, analytic methods, and reporting. A large Brit-\nish survey that used a self-completed questionnaire found\nmean differences between self-reported and measured\nin men 60+ years, somewhat larger than in NHANES. An\nAustralian telephone survey found differences in preva-\nlence of overweight or obesity (percentage points) of -23\nin men and -15 in women, much larger than those see in\nEA in NHANES. Variation in differences by ethnicity was\nnot examined in other studies.\nLimitations and strengths\nSeveral unavoidable limitations of the present study\ninclude possible bias arising from survey non-response\nand from missing values for some variables. Several spe-\ncial studies of NHANES III data have indicated little bias\ndue to non-response [42]. The 2 to 4 week time lapse\nbetween ascertainment of self-reported data and meas-\nured data is unlikely to affect the difference in this adult\npopulation [8]. Compared to interview surveys such as\nNHIS or BRFSS, error in self-reported height and weight\nmight be underestimated in NHANES III if subjects were\naware before the interview that they would be weighed\nand measured during the subsequent examination and\nhence might be less likely to misstate height and weight.\nAt the time of the home interview when participants\nreported their current height and weight, participants had\nnot been invited to the NHANES III examination or told\nthat the examination would include height and weight\nmeasurements. However, because of pre-survey media\npublicity or explicit questions asked of interviewers, some\nparticipants might have known or assumed they would\nlater be measured and weighed. It is not possible to deter-\nmine what effect, if any, this may have had on height and\nweight reporting.\nConfounding by variables not controlled for cannot be\nexcluded. However, given the uncertainty about the exist-\nence or nature of the association, it is unclear which other\nvariables should be controlled for as confounders. The\nnumber of tests was restricted to those of weighted regres-\nsion models. The representativeness of the sample and the\nuse of sample weights provide generalizability of the\nresults to United States non-institutionalized population\nof the same ages, but not necessarily to Mexico or other\nnations or smaller US ethnic groups such as Cubans.\nIn order to monitor overweight prevalence in Cuban and\nPuerto Rican Americans and American Indians using\ninterview survey data, replication of the current findings\nin these groups is needed. Participants might be asked\nwhen their weight and their height were last measured\nand by whom. The validity of self-report data obtained by\nin-person interview, telephone interview, and self-com-\npleted questionnaire should be compared to establish\ngeneralizablity of validity estimates from the former to the\nlatter two. Trends in validity over time should also be\nsought in MA using more recent surveys and related to\npossible correlates.\nConclusion\nSelf reported height, weight and BMI in Mexican Ameri-\ncans may not be of sufficient validity for use by public\nhealth agencies and they underestimate obesity preva-\nlence in women of all ethnic groups.\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nList of Abbreviations\nAA, African American\nBMI, body mass index\nEA, European American\nMA, Mexican American\nNHANES, National Health and Nutrtion Examination\nSurvey\nAdditional material\n"
