    "abstract": "Abstract\nBased on data from qualitative interviews with 40 engaged heterosexual couples, this paper examines how couples transform\ntheir relationship from \"serious\" to being \"engaged to be married.\" Social Scientists have developed relationship models\ndesigned to explain the transformation, but these models fail to adequately capture how couples transform their relationship\nand the context in which this behavior occurs. Using a constructionist framework, an alternative process model is offered.\nThe five-process model captures the ongoing and fluid work couples perform to negotiate a redefinition of the relationship.\nCouples reflexively use a host of complex symbolic interaction including talk, rituals, relationships with others, testing, and\nuse of time to construct their relationship in a new way. By examining the underlying reality construction process, rather\nthan merely looking at the outcome, the social processes and human actions that shape relationships are revealed.\n",

Relationship models tend to portray relation-\nship transformation in fixed, universalistic, and static terms.\nThis study, using a constructionist approach, offers an origi-\nnal process model that illuminates how engagement is\nsocially constructed and seeks to understand the meanings\nengagement has in the lives of heterosexual couples. The\nmodel focuses on interpretive practice, \"the constellation of\nprocedures, conditions and resources through which reality\nis apprehended, understood and conveyed in everyday life\"\nsocial context and reflexive interaction required to become\nengaged are considered. Thus, sociologists are armed with a\nmore complex and contextualized understanding of how\nrelationships progress toward marriage.\nThe Literature on Coupling\nTraditional research on coupling identifies social behaviors\nthat contribute to increasing levels of intimacy. Close roman-\ntic relationships are linked to factors such as an increase in\nself-disclosure in breadth and depth (Laurenceau, Feldman\nshared experiences (Aron, Norman, Aron, & Lewandowski,\nspaces (Levinger, 1980), greater likelihood to discuss the\nrelationship, and more attempts to change the partner's\nbehavior (Argyle & Henderson, 1985; Haunani & Knobloch,\nTraditional research makes inferences based on close-\nended surveys or behavioral data. This poses several prob-\nlems. One, the researcher relies on a priori explanations for\nrelationship commitment and the researcher's definition of\ncommitment. These research methods do not take into\naccount how the couples themselves understand and inter-\npret their own relationship. Imposing preconceived notions\nof commitment has proven problematic. Manning and Smock\n(2005), for example, find that couple's interpretations of\nwhat it means to cohabitate differ from researcher's that has\nled to significant underestimation of cohabitation rates. By\nexamining couple's own understanding of relationships,\nsociologists are in a position to ascertain not only a more\naccurate picture of the state of the relationship but also how\nthese understandings affect the relationship. Participant's\ndefinitions of the relationship are powerful influences on\ncommitment (Johnson, 1991; Orbuch, Veroff, & Holmberg,\nSecond, quantitative studies tend to portray relationship\nprogression as fixed and bounded events. Yet, qualitative\n1California State University, Stanislaus, Turlock, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nTamara Sniezek, California State University, Stanislaus, One University\nEmail: TSniezek@csustan.edu\nNegotiating Marriage: A Process Model of\nHeterosexual Engagement\nTamara Sniezek1\n Keywords\ncoupling, dating, engagement, intimacy, relationship\n2 SAGE Open\nstudies show that these processes are gradual and boundaries\noften blurry. Cohabiting couples rarely define a concrete\nstarting point for cohabitation and that progressing into\ncohabitation is fluid and gradual (Macklin, 1978; Manning &\nSmock, 2005). Qualitative studies of transitions out of rela-\ntionships (\"break-ups\") also find the process gradual and\nfluid (see Vaughan, 1986, also noted in Manning & Smock,\nThird, the social context in which relationship transitions\noccur are not adequately examined in quantitative studies.\nFor example, traditional research assumes couples live and\noperate independently. Yet, couples often reside with other\nadults, with children, and other roommates and these rela-\ntionships greatly influence their relationship (Manning &\nFinally, traditional research relies on cross-sectional sur-\nvey and behavioral data ignoring how relationships ebb and\nflow over time. Relationship stage models, on the other hand,\nattempt to address how coupling evolves. These models typi-\ncally characterize relationships as developing through a\nseries of stages that become increasingly intimate and com-\nmitted. In the Knox and Wilson (1981) model, engagement\nfollows three stages of dating: casual dating, regular dating,\nand steady dating. The stage before engagement, steady dat-\ning, for example, is a period of serious dyadic exclusiveness.\nExpectations that the relationship is exclusive are clear, if not\nexplicit. It is common to have tangible symbols of commit-\nment, such as living together or owning joint property.\nEngagement differs from the \"steady couple\" in that there is\na public "
