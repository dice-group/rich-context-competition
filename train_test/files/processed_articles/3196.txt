First, firms' price setting and hiring decisions are subject to costs and frictions. As in\nseparated from each other, but affect the same firms. This is important, because a firm that has chosen\na particular price will adjust its labor input to meet the demand it faces at that price. Second, firms can\nadjust only hours per worker to satisfy demand in the short run; they can change their workforce only\nwith a lag in response to persistent changes in demand.\nResults\nThe steady state displays distortions along the two labor input margins. First, due to the combination of\nmonopolistic competition in product markets and labor market frictions (wage bargaining coupled with\na `right-to-manage' choice of hours), hours per employee are too low. Second, as a result, the shadow\nvalue of the marginal worker is too low and therefore hiring is below the efficient level.\nIn a large firm, there is another (and well-known) effect on employment that goes in the opposite\ndirection. Hiring shifts the burden of future production away from the intensive and towards the\nextensive margin. Hours per employee fall and, through intra-firm bargaining the wage paid to all\nworkers falls, too. In isolation, this externality leads to overhiring. We demonstrate that, in a standard\ncalibration, the first effect on employment dominates and steady state employment is too low.\nWe show that the optimal tax policy mix is a subsidy to private consumption (to raise production and\nhours per employee), combined with a firm revenue tax (to counter the overhiring result that would\nobtain due to the large-firm externality, see above).\nIn the absence of fiscal instruments, the steady state distortions lead to inefficient business cycle\nfluctuations. Our model features a `wage curve`. The wage set through bargaining is a convex function of\nhours per worker; the real marginal wage is increasing in hours. A low steady-state real marginal wage\nimplies that the real wage and thus real marginal costs are not very sensitive to hours. As a consequence\nof this real wage rigidity, firms overuse the hours margin relative to the employment margin in response\nto shocks. The optimal monetary policy uses inflation as an instrument to dampen inefficient\nfluctuations in hours worked.\nNicht-technische Zusammenfassung\nFragestellung\nIn der vorliegenden Studie wird der Frage nachgegangen, inwieweit sich die Verf\u00fcgbarkeit zweier\nVariablen f\u00fcr den Arbeitseinsatz auf Unternehmensebene (Besch\u00e4ftigung sowie Arbeitsstunden je\nBesch\u00e4ftigten in gro\u00dfen Unternehmen) auf optimale Gestaltungskonzepte mit Blick auf die Steuer- und\nGeldpolitik auswirkt.\nBeitrag\nUnser Modell verf\u00fcgt \u00fcber eine Reihe wichtiger und \u00ad unserer Meinung nach \u00ad realistischer Merkmale\nim Vergleich zu weiten Teilen der Fachliteratur. Erstens unterliegen die Preisgestaltungs- und\nPersonaleinstellungsentscheidungen der Unternehmen Kosten und Beschr\u00e4nkungen. Wie Barnichon\nk\u00fcnstlich voneinander getrennt, sondern betreffen ein- und dieselben Unternehmen. Dies ist von\nBedeutung, da ein Unternehmen, das einen bestimmten Preis festgelegt hat, seinen Arbeitseinsatz\nanpassen wird, um die bei diesem Preis entstehende Nachfrage zu erf\u00fcllen. Zweitens k\u00f6nnen die Firmen\nkurzfristig nur die Arbeitsstunden je Besch\u00e4ftigten angleichen, um der Nachfrage gerecht zu werden.\nIhren Personalbestand k\u00f6nnen sie bei anhaltenden Ver\u00e4nderungen der Nachfrage lediglich mit einer\nzeitlichen Verz\u00f6gerung anpassen.\nErgebnisse\nDer Gleichgewichtszustand (steady state) weist Verzerrungen mit Blick auf die beiden Variablen f\u00fcr den\nArbeitseinsatz auf. Zum einen sind aufgrund des Zusammenspiels von monopolistischem Wettbewerb\nan den G\u00fcterm\u00e4rkten und Arbeitsmarktbeschr\u00e4nkungen (Lohnverhandlungen in Verbindung mit dem\nLeitungsrecht zur Bestimmung der Arbeitsstunden) die Arbeitsstunden je Besch\u00e4ftigten zu niedrig. Zum\nanderen ist aus diesem Grund der Schattenwert eines zus\u00e4tzlichen Besch\u00e4ftigten zu gering, und somit\nliegt die Neueinstellung von Mitarbeitern unter dem Effizienzniveau.\nIn gro\u00dfen Unternehmen gibt es eine weitere (wohlbekannte) Auswirkung auf die Besch\u00e4ftigung, die in\ndie entgegengesetzte Richtung geht. Durch die Einstellung von Mitarbeitern wird die Belastung der\nk\u00fcnftigen Produktion vom intensiven auf den extensiven Rand verlagert. Die Arbeitsstunden je\nBesch\u00e4ftigten sinken, und durch unternehmensinterne Lohnverhandlungen verringert sich auch der\nLohn f\u00fcr alle Mitarbeiter. Isoliert betrachtet f\u00fchrt diese Externalit\u00e4t zu einer \u00fcberm\u00e4\u00dfigen\nPersonalakquise. Wir demonstrieren, dass bei einer Standard-Kalibrierung die erstere Auswirkung auf\ndie Besch\u00e4ftigung dominiert und die gleichgewichtige Besch\u00e4ftigung zu gering ausf\u00e4llt.\nWir zeigen, dass der optimale steuerpolitische Mix aus einer Subventionierung des privaten Konsums\n(zur Steigerung der Produktion und der Arbeitsstunden je Besch\u00e4ftigten) und einer\nUnternehmensertragsteuer (um der \u00fcberm\u00e4\u00dfigen Personaleinstellung aufgrund der Externalit\u00e4t gro\u00dfer\nUnternehmen entgegenzuwirken, siehe oben) besteht.\nFehlen finanzpolitische Instrumente, so f\u00fchren die Gleichgewichtsverzerrungen zu ineffizienten\nSchwankungen im Konjunkturzyklus. Unser Modell bildet eine ,,Lohnkurve\" ab. Bei dem durch\nVerhandlungen festgesetzten Lohn handelt es sich um eine konvexe Funktion der Arbeitsstunden je\nBesch\u00e4ftigten; der reale Grenzlohn nimmt mit den Arbeitsstunden zu. Ein niedriger gleichgewichtiger\nrealer Grenzlohn impliziert, dass der Reallohn und somit die realen Grenzkosten nicht sehr empfindlich\nauf die Arbeitsstunden reagieren. Aufgrund dieser Reallohnrigidit\u00e4t greifen Unternehmen in Reaktion\nauf Schocks gegen\u00fcber der Besch\u00e4ftigungsvariable unverh\u00e4ltnism\u00e4\u00dfig stark auf die Variable der\nArbeitsstunden zur\u00fcck. Die optimale Geldpolitik setzt die Inflation als Instrument ein, um ineffiziente\nSchwankungen der geleisteten Arbeitsstunden zu begrenzen.\nEmployment, Hours and Optimal Monetary Policy\nMaarten Dossche\nNational Bank of Belgium\nVivien Lewisy\nKU Leuven\nC\u00e9line Poillyz\nUniversity of Lausanne\n Keywords: employment, hours, wage curve, optimal monetary policy.\nNational Bank of Belgium, de Berlaimontlaan 14, 1000 Brussels, Belgium, maarten.dossche@nbb.be,\nhttp://maartendossche.googlepages.com.\nvivien.lewis@kuleuven.be, http://sites.google.com/site/vivienjlewis.\nzCorresponding author.

Papers inspecting optimal monetary\npolicy in a search-and-matching model usually assume that hours per worker are constant\nand a ...rm is composed of a single worker, so he contributes to the ...rm'\ns pro...t through its\nmarginal productivity. In this paper, we characterize optimal policy in a large-...rm setup\nwith two margins of labor, namely employment and hours per employee. Two related forces\na\u00a4ecting wages come up in this realistic framework. First, a ...rm can hire multiple workers\nand an additional worker is not productive straight away. Therefore, he contributes to pro...ts\nby a\u00a4ecting the wage of all other workers, which results in a `\nwage externality'\n. Second, a\n...rm can adjust the two labor margins, which sheds light on the `\nwage curve'\n, i.e. the real\nwage is a function of the number of hours worked. A form of `\nreal wage rigidity'emerge \u00ad\nwhen wages respond little to hours \u00addue to imperfect competition and labor market frictions.\nUnlike the typical search-and-matching model, ...rms can exploit it by overusing the hours\nmargin when adjusting production. We argue that deviation from price stability might occur\nin this setup. With its lever on in\nation and real marginal costs, the Ramsey planner can\na\u00a4ect the real wage and thus the ...rm'\ns hours decision.\nOnce we allow for ...rms to have many workers, we move away from the standard one-\nworker-...rm model of Mortensen and Pissarides (1994) and towards a large-...rm model. Many\nstudies considering labor market frictions in monetary economies focus on one of two labor\ninput margins, either the extensive margin (employment) or the intensive margin (hours).\nOhanian and Ra\u00a4o (2012), however, stress the importance of accounting for both the ex-\ntensive and the intensive labor input margin. In our model, employment is predetermined,\ni.e. it takes one period for a newly hired worker to become productive. When faced with a\nshock, ...rms cannot expand the extensive margin of labor on impact, but instead adjust hours\nin a `\nright-to-manage'fashion. We believe that predetermined employment is a reasonable\nassumption since VAR evidence suggests that, on impact, employment and unemployment\nrespond little (if at all) to demand shocks (see Monacelli et al., 2010, Brueckner and Pappa,\nThe right-to-manage feature by which ...rms choose hours worked unilaterally, coupled\nwith wage bargaining, results in a `\nwage curve'\n, i.e. the real wage becomes a function of the\nnumber of hours worked. Kuester (2010) shows that a model with such a `\nwage channel'\nperforms well at matching impulse responses in US data. In the presence of the wage\ncurve, instantaneous hiring vs. predetermined employment is not an innocuous model choice.\nWith instantaneous hiring as in Sunakawa (2013), the marginal worker generates pro...ts by\ncontributing directly to production. With predetermined employment, an additional worker\ncontributes to current pro...ts by reducing the wage payments to all existing workers, creating\na `\nwage externality'\n. An additional worker reduces the number of hours needed to satisfy\nfuture demand as ...rms shift production from the intensive to the extensive labor margin.\nThrough the wage curve, the reduction in hours results in a reduction in the real wage.\nWe assume that producers are monopolistically competitive ...rms that face price rigidities\nas well as search-and-matching frictions in the labor market (see Barnichon, 2010, Kuester,\nmonopolistic competition by arguing that a ...rm'\ns size is related to its market power. While\nthe separation of these two frictions in a `\nproducer-retailer structure'\na useful device for many research questions, we argue that optimal policy prescriptions are\nrather sensitive to this assumption.\nOur contribution is to show that our large-...rm model combining the two labor margins\ngives rise to optimal monetary and ...scal policies. We highlight that both the intensive\nand the extensive labor margins are distorted in the competitive allocation. Hours per\nemployee are ine\u00a2 ciently low because of the combination of imperfect competition in product\nmarkets and labor market frictions (wage bargaining coupled with a `\nright-to-manage'choice\nof hours). Hiring is ine\u00a2 cient for two reasons. All things equal, the wage externality implies\nthat ...rms tend to over-hire in order to bene...t from the reduction in wages (see Stole and\nZwiebel, 1996). This e\u00a4ect is, however, dominated by the fact that each employee works\ntoo few hours, implying that the steady-state value of an additional worker is lower than\nis e\u00a2 cient. As a result, both hours and employment are suboptimally low at the steady\nstate. We show how a combination of a tax on ...rm revenues, a consumption subsidy and\na compensating transfer to unemployed home production workers makes the steady state\ne\u00a2 cient. Under an optimal tax policy mix, \nuctuations in real marginal costs due to price\nsetting frictions represent the only cyclical distortions. Therefore, strict in\nation targeting\nis optimal and implements the e\u00a2 cient allocation. However, when tax instruments are\nunavailable and the steady state is distorted, the Ramsey optimal policy deviates from price\nstability.\nLabor inputs distortions at the steady state result in ine\u00a2 cient cyclical \nuctuations in\nresponse to shocks. The wage per worker, set through bilateral bargaining, is an increasing\nand convex function of hours worked, as captured by the wage curve. The slope of the\nwage curve (i.e. the real marginal wage) is too low at the steady state due to the hours\ndistortion described above. This implies that, in response to shocks, wages do not rise much\nfor a given increase in hours worked. Firms exploit this endogenous `\nreal wage rigidity'\nby overusing the hours margin, and potentially underusing the employment margin, when\nresponding to changes in demand or technology. Price rigidities give the Ramsey planner a\ntool to in\nuence the real marginal wage and thus the tradeo\u00a4 between the intensive and the\nextensive labor margin. In\nation is used as a countercyclical policy instrument (with respect\nto hours worked) to dampen ine\u00a2 cient \nuctuations in hours. We show that the magnitude\nof the deviation of price stability depends on the size of the hours distortion, which in turn\nis driven by the bargaining power of workers, the disutility cost of hours and the return to\nhours in production (see also Barnichon, 2012).\nSeveral authors have analyzed the implications of labor search frictions and price rigidi-\nties for optimal policy. Ravenna and Walsh (2011) study optimal monetary policy in a\nlinear-quadratic framework, while Sala et al. (2008) use an ad-hoc loss function. These\nauthors do not distinguish between the two labor margins. Thomas (2008) shows that\nimperfect wage adjustment creates ine\u00a2 cient hiring and leads to optimal deviations from\nprice stability. Blanchard and Gal\u00ed (2010) study the e\u00a4ect of real wage rigidities on the\nin\nation-unemployment trade-o\u00a4. However, they all restrict their attention to the case of\nan e\u00a2 cient steady state. Faia (2009) shows that deviations from the e\u00a2 cient steady state,\nthrough the Hosios condition, imply that optimal monetary policy does not fully stabilize\nprices. Sunakawa (2013) extends this analysis by assuming that hours are chosen in a right-\nto-manage fashion. Importantly, unlike that author, employment is predetermined in our\nmodel. Finally, Ravenna and Walsh (2012) characterize optimal tax policies in a model\nwhere price rigidities and labor search frictions a\u00a4ect di\u00a4erent sectors. We provide policy\nrecommendations in a setting where ...rms, with two labor input margins, face both labor\nsearch frictions and price adjustment costs. Another strand of the literature has explored\nvarious aspects of the large-...rm setup, but has so far not provided an optimal monetary\npolicy analysis.2 Our paper aims to ...ll this gap.\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the model. Section\n3 describes the distortions at the steady state and the optimal taxation results. In Section\n4, we analyze optimal monetary policy. Section 5 concludes.\ncombined with search-matching frictions generates ine\u00a2 ciencies in the competitive allocation. However, they\ndo not consider hours, such that the only labor market distortion is over-hiring by ...rms. Beugnot and Tidball\n(2010) incorporate price setting in a large-...rm model, where both hiring and pricing decisions are in the\nsame sector and the aggregate production function features increasing returns to scale. Here, we distinguish\nbetween two labor margins and allow for increasing returns to hours only.\nOur model features search-and-matching frictions in the labor market and bilateral wage\nbargaining \u00e0 la Mortensen and Pissarides (1994).3 We adopt the large-...rm version of this\nmodel where ...rms employ many workers, see Chapter 2 in Pissarides (2000). We allow for\nvariable hours per worker such that labor input can be adjusted along two margins, the\nextensive margin (employment) and the intensive one (hours per employee). Firms operate\nunder monopolistic competition and face quadratic price adjustment costs \u00e0 la Rotemberg\n(1982).

So far, we have described the\nrepresentative family. Given that all families are identical in equilibrium and their mass is\nnormalized to unity, Ct\nrepresents household consumption as well as economy-wide consump-\ntion. The ...rst order conditions for consumption and bonds imply 1 = Rt\nEt\ng,\nwhere t 1;t\nCt\nis the stochastic discount factor and t\n= Pt\nis the gross in\nation\nrate.\n2.2 Labor Market Search and Matching\nFirms post vacancies and unemployed workers search for jobs. Let Mt\nut\nt\ndenote\nthe number of successful matches. The matching technology is a Cobb-Douglas function of\nthe unemployment rate ut\nand the aggregate number of vacancies vt\n=\nR\nvit\ndi, where\n2 (0; 1) is the elasticity of the number of matches to unemployment and M0\n> 0 is a scale\nparameter. The probability of a vacancy being ...lled next period is qt\n= Mt\n=vt\n,\nwhere the ratio of vacancies to unemployed workers t\n= vt\n=ut\nis a measure of labor market\ntightness.

Ceteris paribus, a greater { implies that\nraising hours worked results in a larger increase in the equilibrium wage.

This means\nthat increasing hours by 1% raises output per worker by more than 1%. As argued by Oi\n(1962) and Solow (1964), increasing returns to hours can be rationalized through unobserved\nvariations in factor utilization, such as work intensity, or e\u00a4ort. See also Barnichon (2010,\nThe ...rst order condition for hours worked states that the Lagrange multiplier on the\ndemand constraint st\nequals the real marginal wage divided by the marginal product of\nhours,\nst\n=\nt\n(ht\n)\nmpht\nEquation (14) describes the ...rm'\ns real marginal costs, i.e. the change in the wage bill for\na unit increase in output. Since employment is predetermined, ...rms increase production\nto satisfy demand by increasing hours worked. Using more hours has two e\u00a4ects on real\nmarginal costs. On one hand, it increases the real marginal wage w0\nt\n(ht\n), or the cost of one\nadditional worker-hour, provided that { > 0 in (8), and therefore st\n. On the other hand,\nwhen ' 6= 1, the marginal productivity of hours also varies with hours worked. Under the\nstandard assumption of decreasing returns to hours (' < 1), mpht\nfalls with hours, raising\nreal marginal costs. Under increasing returns to hours (' > 1), the marginal product of\nhours mpht\ninstead rises with hours, which reduces st\n. Then real marginal costs respond less\npositively to a rise in hours worked.\nThe real marginal cost can be seen as the cost of using the hours margin, rather than the\nemployment margin, to adjust output in response to a persistent shock. It is increasing in\nthe slope of the wage curve, w0\nt\n(ht\n), and decreasing in the marginal product of hours, mpht\n.\nVacancy Posting The ...rst order conditions for vacancies and next period'\ns employment\ntogether imply\nv\nqt\nwhere t\nis the shadow value of the marginal worker. A ...rm posts vacancies until the cost of\nhiring a worker equals the expected discounted future bene...ts from this extra worker. The\ncosts of hiring a worker are given by the vacancy posting costs, v\n, multiplied by the average\nduration of a vacancy, 1=qt\n. The bene...ts of hiring a worker are his shadow value, it\n, plus\nthe vacancy posting costs saved in case the employment relationship continues.\nIn the one-worker-...rm framework with instantaneous hiring, the shadow value of a mar-\nginal worker, t\n, corresponds to his marginal productivity net of his wage. In our setup\nwith large ...rms and predetermined employment, the marginal worker reduces future hours\nworked of all the ...rm'\ns employees by shifting production from the intensive to the exten-\nsive margin. The reduction in hours in turn reduces the wage determined in the bargaining\nprocess. Formally, the shadow value of a marginal worker captures the reduction in the wage\nbill induced by an additional hire,\nt\n=\n@wt\n(ht\n) nt\n@nt\n= wt\n(ht\n) +\nht\n'\nt\n(ht\nOn one hand, hiring an additional worker costs the ...rm wt\n. On the other, it allows the ...rm\nto reduce the number of hours, and through (6) the wage payments to, all other workers.\nThe degree of returns to hours has a direct and an indirect e\u00a4ect on the shadow value.\nFirst, if the degree of returns to hours ' is high, a given reduction in hours reduces output by\na larger amount. Then hiring an additional worker and reducing hours is less attractive and\nthe shadow value is lower. Second, there is an indirect e\u00a4ect through the wage externality. If\nthe degree of returns to hours ' is high relative to the utility cost of hours (1+ h\n), the wage\ncurve is rather \nat and raising hours has a smaller e\u00a4ect on the equilibrium wage. Then the\nshadow value of the marginal worker is lower and hiring is discouraged.\nSubstituting out the real marginal wage in (16), the shadow value can be expressed as\nt\n= wt\n(ht\n) +\nht\n'\nst\nmpht\nPrice Setting The ...rst order condition for prices yields the New Keynesian Phillips Curve,\np t\n( t\nYt\nOur speci...cation of price rigidities follows Faia (2009) and Sunakawa (2013), but di\u00a4ers\nstaggering.

The\nsteady-state output level Y is normalized to unity. Steady-state technology is then set to\nobtain an unemployment rate of 9:6% in the steady state, which corresponds to the aver-\nage unemployment rate in the Euro Area between 1999 and 2013. The resulting value is\n, the curvature of labor disutility in hours,\nequal to 2. The household'\ns weight on labor disutility h\nis calibrated such that hours equal\n0:9 in steady state.11 Following Christo\u00a4el et al.

Second, we characterize the steady-\nstate distortions to employment and to the number of hours that arise in the competitive\nequilibrium. Third, we derive the optimal tax policy mix that removes these distortions.\nFinally, we analyze the e\u00a4ects of the steady-state distortions on the model dynamics when\nprices are \nexible.\n3.1 E\u00a2 cient Allocation\nThe social planner problem is to maximize household utility subject to the evolution of\naggregate employment, which we regard as a technological constraint, and the resource\nconstraint.\nDe...nition 2 An e\u00a2 cient allocation is a set of paths fht\n; vt\n; Ct\nwhich maximizes\nutility (1), subject to the employment dynamics constraint and the resource constraint,\nt\nAt\nnt\nh'\nt\n) b = Ct\n+ Gt\n+ v\nvt\nThe e\u00a2 cient allocation is characterized by two conditions determining hours and employ-\nment.

(2007), we characterize the distortion in the number of hours worked\nin terms of a wedge between the marginal rate of substitution and the marginal product of\nhours. This wedge or `\nine\u00a2 ciency gap'is driven by a wage markup and a price markup,\nrepresenting ine\u00a2 ciencies in labor markets and in product markets, respectively.\nFirst, in the steady state, the real marginal wage (8) is related to the marginal rate of\nsubstitution as follows\nw0 (h) = w\nwhere w\n= { can be viewed as a wage markup. In a typical calibration we have 1+ h\n'\nand therefore { > 1, such that the real marginal wage under bargaining is larger than\nthe marginal rate of substitution. This means that wages rise faster with hours than in\nthe e\u00a2 cient case. Recall that { = 1 if wages were set in a Walrasian labor market. The\nparameter { thus captures the distortion imposed by the bargaining process.\nSecond, using the ...rm'\ns ...rst order condition for hours (14), we can relate the real marginal\nwage to the marginal product of hours as follows,\nmph\np\nwhere p\n= 1=s represents a price markup. Setting (32) and (33) equal to eliminate w0 (h)\nand de...ning the steady-state ine\u00a2 ciency gap as gap = mrs\nmph\n, we obtain\ngap = ( w p\ns\n{\nIn the absence of taxes ( f = c = 0), Gal\u00ed et al (2007)'\ns ine\u00a2 ciency gap (34) corresponds to\nthe hours distortion (31) in our model. More speci...cally, we have gap = 1=({ ) < 1. The\nine\u00a2 ciency in the choice of hours comes from two sources.\nFirst, because of monopolistic competition in goods markets captured by the markup ,\nwhich reduces real marginal costs below unity (s < 1), output and thus hours per worker\nare too low.\nSecond, wages are not set as in a Walrasian labor market but are instead chosen through\nbargaining. Suppose that wages are set such that the demand for hours by the ...rm equals\nthe supply of hours by the household. If the household could choose hours optimally, it\nwould set ht\nto maximize utility (1) subject to the budget constraint (3). The associated\n...rst order condition is that the real marginal wage equals the marginal rate of substitution\nbetween leisure and consumption, w0\nt\n(ht\n) = mrst\n.\nThe wedge introduced by wage bargaining is greater than unity ({ > 1). For a given\nproduct market distortion > 1, it is theoretically possible that hours are e\u00a2 cient (s={ = 1),\nor even too high (s={ > 1). This is the case only if (1 + h\n) =' < 1 such that { < 1, which\nhappens if labor disutility does not rise strongly with hours, such that h\nis close to zero,\nand there are strongly increasing returns to hours, such that ' is much above 1. We do not\nconsider this case here.\nFigure 1 displays the (log) real marginal wage as a function of hours by using (32) and\n(33), setting taxes to zero ( c = f = 0). The competitive equilibrium allocation for hours\nworked is at the intersection of the two curves. Notice that in this partial equilibrium exercise,\nwe plot the marginal rate of substitution (9) as a function of hours, keeping consumption\nconstant at the competitive level, C. Figure 1 also plots mrs and mph as a function of\nhours worked. We keep consumption constant at the e\u00a2 cient level, C , in mrs . The\ne\u00a2 cient number of hours worked can be read o\u00a4 from the intersection of the two latter\ncurves.\nThe ...gure shows two results. First, hours worked are lower than in the e\u00a2 cient alloca-\ntion. This is what we call the `\nhours distortion'\n. Second, the real marginal wage is lower\nthan it would be in a Walrasian labor market. How do our results di\u00a4er from Gal\u00ed et al.\n(2007)? First, since we consider two labor input margins, hours and employment, the hours\ndistortion in (34) is not the only ine\u00a2 ciency. We analyze the employment distortion in more\ndetail below. Second, since in our model the marginal product of hours is increasing in\nhours worked, the mph-curve is positively sloped in Figure 1. The real wage is therefore\nunambiguously too low in the competitive equilibrium.\nright-to-manage' assumption, by\nwhich ...rms choose hours unilaterally, results in a wedge between the marginal rate of sub-\nstitution and the marginal product of labor. In an alternative setup where both wages and\nhours are determined through Nash bargaining, this wedge is removed, such that hours are\nFigure 1: Labor Market Allocation: Hours\nHours\nmrs, mph\nmph- \u00b5\np\nmrs+\u00b5\nw\nmrs*\nmph\nNote: The curves depict the (log) real marginal wage, the (log) marginal product of labor and\nthe (log) marginal rate of substitution as a function of hours.

The line with circles displays the real marginal wage\ndetermined through bargaining (32). The dotted line displays the marginal rate of substitution (9)\nwhen c = 0 and consumption is e\u00a2 cient.\nset e\u00a2 ciently. This is what Trigari (2006) calls `\ne\u00a2 cient bargaining'\n. She considers prede-\ntermined employment, but assumes a producer-retailer structure where price rigidities and\nhiring frictions are located in di\u00a4erent sectors. Sunakawa (2013) considers ...rms that face\nboth price rigidities and hiring frictions, but assumes instantaneous hiring. In our model,\nboth features are present: price rigidities and hiring frictions a\u00a4ect the same ...rms and em-\nployment is predetermined. Therefore, we cannot use e\u00a2 cient bargaining as a benchmark,\nbecause a ...rm that has set a price needs to be able to adjust total hours in order to satisfy\ndemand at the chosen price. Since employment is predetermined, the only labor margin\nadjustable in the short run is the number of hours per worker.\nEmployment Margin As in Pissarides (2000) and Krause and Lubik (2007b), we highlight\nthe distortions associated with vacancy posting decisions. To do so, we derive two steady-\nstate equations in unemployment (u) and vacancies (v): the Beveridge Curve and the job\ncreation condition for both the competitive and the e\u00a2 cient allocation.\nUnder symmetry, the law of motion for employment (4) is nt\n+ qt\nvt\n, which\nin steady state becomes n = qv= or\nv =\nu\nafter substituting out n and q. The Beveridge Curve (35) traces out the number of vacancies\nv as a function of unemployment u, for a given matching e\u00a2 ciency M0\nand separation rate\n. Since the e\u00a2 cient allocation is characterized by the same law of motion for employment\n(4), the Beveridge Curve holds in the competitive and in the e\u00a2 cient allocation.\nThe competitive job creation condition is derived by combining the vacancy posting\ncondition (15) with the shadow value (17) at the steady state. After several substitutions,\nwe obtain\nv\nu\n=\nv\nv\nu\n'\ns\nY\nn\n). In the e\u00a2 cient allocation, the steady-state job creation\ncondition is given by\nv\nu\n=\nv\nv\nu\n'\nY\nn\nComparing the job creation condition (36) with its e\u00a2 cient counterpart (37), we can see that\nthere are three channels through which unemployment a\u00a4ects the number of vacancies.\nThe ...rst channel is related to the e\u00a4ect of unemployment on vacancy duration. This\nis captured by the ...rst term on the right hand side of the job creation condition. For a\ngiven matching e\u00a2 ciency M0\n, labor market tightness falls when unemployment rises, which\nlowers the duration of a vacancy q 1 and encourages hiring. A distortion arises if 6= . To\nrestore e\u00a2 ciency, the well-known Hosios (1990) condition needs to hold, which requires that\nthe workers'bargaining power must equal the elasticity of vacancy duration to the number\nof vacancies, . When this elasticity is high, a ...rm that posts a vacancy greatly increases\nvacancy duration for all other ...rms, creating a congestion e\u00a4ect. This e\u00a4ect is o\u00a4set if\nworkers have a lot of bargaining power, which discourages ...rms from posting vacancies. In\ncontrast to the standard search-and-matching model, however, the Hosios condition is not\nenough to guarantee e\u00a2 cient vacancy posting in this model.\nThe second channel is a deviation of the worker'\ns outside option bc from the e\u00a2 cient\nvalue b, which we recall represents the productivity in home production. A distortion arises\nif bc 6= b. Any consumption tax or subsidy ( c 6= 0), distorts the choice of market production\nrelative to home production, and hence the worker'\ns outside option, since bc is no longer\nequal to b in this case.13\nThe third channel is related to the combination of monopolistic competition and search\nfrictions in our large-...rm setup. This is captured by the last term on the right hand side of\nthe job creation condition. A distortion arises if\ns\nY\nn\nY\nn\nThe inequality captures two opposing e\u00a4ects on hiring. First, because of the hours distortion\ndescribed above, output per worker is suboptimally low in the competitive equilibrium,\nY=n < Y =n . Since hours per worker are too low, an additional worker is less productive\nand therefore less valuable to the ...rm, reducing the ...rm'\ns incentives to hire. Therefore,\nemployment is reduced below its e\u00a2 cient level.\nSecond, in a typical calibration, steady-state real marginal costs are greater than the\nelasticity of matches to vacancies, s > 1 . Recall that real marginal costs (14) represent\n13This distortion is also present in the model of home production described by Ravenna and Walsh (2012).\nthe cost of adjusting hours, relative to employment, in order to accommodate changes in\ndemand. Real marginal costs are high if w0 (h) is large, i.e. the wage curve is steep. In that\ncase, an additional worker and a corresponding reduction in the number of hours per worker\nallows for a large wage cut for all other workers. This boosts the ...rm'\ns incentive to hire.\nIntuitively, when the ...rm hires a new worker, its other workers have to work fewer hours\nto produce a given amount of output. The bargained wage falls and this raises the shadow\nvalue of a worker and hence the number of vacancies posted. Thus, ...rms have an incentive\nto over-employ workers in order to reduce their bargaining position within the ...rm (see\nStole and Zwiebel, 1996). As shown by Ebell and Haefke (2009), this over-hiring externality\nis reinforced when the degree of competition is low (the price markup is high such that\ns = 1= is close to 1). The following result summarizes this discussion.\nResult 2 A distortion in the extensive labor margin arises when the shadow value of a\nworker is too low or too high. Two forces work in opposite directions. On the one hand,\nthe monopolistic competition distortion depresses the number of hours per worker, h, and\ntherefore productivity (output per worker, Y/n),\nY\nn\n<\nY\nn\nresulting in too low employment. On the other hand, if steady-state real marginal costs are\ngreater than the match elasticity to vacancies,\nemployment is too high in equilibrium.\nFigure 2 depicts the Beverige curve, as well as the competitive and the e\u00a2 cient job\ncreation condition (JCC).14 We keep the steady-state output levels in the competitive and\n14Notice that the competitive Beveridge curve is identical to the e\u00a2 cient one.\nin e\u00a2 cient allocation, Y and Y respectively, constant in this partial equilibrium exercise,\nand we use the relation n = 1 u.\nFigure 2: Labor Market Allocation: Employment\nUnemployment Rate\nVacancies\nBeveridge Curve\nCompetitive JCC\nEfficient JCC\nCompetitive JCC, Y = Y*\nEach curve depicts the number of vacancies as a function of the unemployment rate. The continuous\nline displays the Beveridge Curve (35). The line with circles displays the competitive job creation\ncondition (36). The dashed line displays the e\u00a2 cient job creation condition (37). The dotted line\ndisplays the competitive job creation condition (36) when output is e\u00a2 cient, Y = Y .\nUnder the standard Hosios condition = and with all tax rates set to zero ( f =\nc = Tb = 0), the di\u00a4erence between the competitive and e\u00a2 cient JCC stems entirely from\nthe inequality (38). The Beveridge curve is the downward sloping curve in (u; v)-space. A\nhigher number of vacancies is associated with a higher level of employment (and hence lower\nunemployment). The JCC is upward-sloping; as unemployment rises, the shadow value of\na worker rises overall and the number of vacancies increases. The equilibrium is located at\nthe intersection of the Beveridge curve with the relevant JCC.\nThe ...gure shows that the e\u00a2 cient JCC is \natter than the competitive JCC. The compet-\nitive equilibrium is thus characterized by too much unemployment. What if hours are large\nenough such that output in the competitive economy is at the e\u00a2 cient level? The corre-\nsponding JCC is depicted as the steepest upward-sloping curve in Figure 2. The intersection\nwith the Beveridge Curve is at a point where unemployment is below the e\u00a2 cient level. The\nremaining distortion in the shadow value is given by the inequality s > 1 , leading to the\nover-hiring distortion described above.\n3.3 Optimal Tax Policy\nUnder \nexible prices, the e\u00a2 cient allocation can be implemented through an appropriate tax\npolicy mix. More precisely, the policy maker needs to choose the ...scal instruments which\nremove the hours and employment distortions at the steady state.\nDe...nition 3 An optimal tax policy is a set { f ; c; Tb}, such that the zero-ination steady\nstate in the competitive equilibrium coincides with the e\u00a2 cient steady state.\nAs described above, the intensive margin of labor is distorted when the ine\u00a2 ciency gap\nis not equal to the gross consumption tax, see (31). In addition, there are three potential\nsources of distortion on the extensive margin of labor which can be shown by comparing\nthe decentralized JCC (36) with the e\u00a2 cient JCC (37). In the following, we ...rst assume\nthat the standard Hosios condition is satis...ed ( = ), which allows us to derive a simple\nexpression for an optimal mix of revenue taxes, consumption subsidies and transfers to the\nunemployed, that jointly correct for ine\u00a2 ciencies in vacancy posting and hours. Second, we\nrelax the Hosios assumption and derive the optimal tax policy mix for the general case.\nSpecial Case We assume that the standard Hosios condition is satis...ed ( = ). In\nthis special case, we can show analytically that the remaining distortions in hours and\nemployment can be removed with our tax instruments. To derive the optimal revenue and\nconsumption tax rates, we replace s = 1 f = , Y=n = Ah' and Y =n = Ah ' in (31)\n{\nThe optimal ...scal policy mix is given by the tax rates f , c and Tb which jointly satisfy\nthe two e\u00a2 ciency conditions (41) and (42), as well as b = bc, such that h = h and n = n .\nResult 3 Under the standard Hosios condition = , the optimal tax policy mix is given\nby\nc =\n'\nFirst, we focus on the extensive labor margin as described in the ...rst e\u00a2 ciency condition\n(41). Given an optimal consumption tax such that hours worked are e\u00a2 cient (h = h ),\ne\u00a2 ciency in vacancy posting is restored with an appropriate revenue tax (43). The optimal\nrevenue tax depends on the price markup and on the elasticity of matches to vacancies,\n1 . Recall that the large-...rm setup - in isolation - features an over-hiring externality\nwhen condition (40) is satis...ed. Firms employ too many workers in order to reduce hours\nper worker and thus the wage bill through (6). Overhiring in turn generates congestion\ne\u00a4ects by reducing the probability of other ...rms to ...nd a worker. Therefore, the optimal\nrevenue tax to be imposed on a monopolistic ...rm equals the gross markup adjusted for the\ncongestion externalities it creates.15 Equation (43) shows that, if there are no matching\nfrictions and therefore no congestion externalities, such that = 0, we have the standard\nresult from the New Keynesian model prescribing an optimal revenue subsidy equal to the\n15Felbermayr et al. (2012) show that the over-hiring externality can also be corrected by increasing\nunemployment bene...ts.\ngross markup. If instead (1 ) < 1, as is the case in a calibrated search-and-matching\nmodel, ...rm revenues are instead taxed at the optimum, f > 0.\nSecond, we turn to the intensive labor margin as described in the second e\u00a2 ciency\ncondition (42). Given an optimal revenue tax such that employment is e\u00a2 cient (n = n ),\nan appropriate consumption tax can correct the ine\u00a2 ciency in hours worked, such that\nh = h . Imposing f = f (43) in (42), the optimal consumption tax that removes the\nhours distortion simpli...es to (44). The optimal consumption tax is negative: at the optimum,\nmarket consumption should be subsidized. Recall that the hours distortion is driven by the\ngap between the real marginal cost, s, and the slope of the wage curve, {, as shown in\n(31). The latter corresponds to the deviation from Walrasian wage setting and is driven by\n) =' and , see (7). A high relative disutility cost of hours, (1 + h\n) =', or a high\nworker bargaining power, , shift the real marginal wage curve up for any given number of\nhours worked, see Figure 1. The farther the real marginal wage is from the marginal rate of\nsubstitution, the greater is the required consumption subsidy, which shifts the marginal rate\nof substution down, see (9).\nThird, we choose an appropriate lump sum transfer to the unemployed such that we can\nabstract from the choice between market and home production. To remove the distortionary\ne\u00a4ect of the consumption tax on vacancy posting, we allow for transfers to unemployed\nworkers Tb = c b, such that bc = b (see the de...nition of bc in the household budget\nconstraint (3)).\nGeneral Case In the general case where the standard Hosios condition does not hold\n( 6= ), the optimal tax policy mix has no neat analytical form but instead depends on the\nentire model'\ns steady state and therefore has to be derived numerically.16 We continue to\nassume that unemployed workers receive lump-sum transfers Tb , such that b = bc.\n16First, the optimal revenue tax is such that employment in the competitive steady state equals its e\u00a2 cient\nlevel, n = n . Second, the optimal consumption tax removes the hours distortion by satisfying the e\u00a2 ciency\nFigure 3 displays the optimal tax policy mix as a function of the elasticity of vacancy du-\nration to the number of vacancies, . The other model parameters are set to their benchmark\nvalues, in particular, the workers'bargaining power is set to = 0:4.\nFigure 3: Optimal Taxation and Congestion E\u00a4ects\nThe left panel shows the optimal tax on ...rm revenues, f , as a function of the elasticity of matches\nto unemployment, . The right panel shows the optimal consumption tax, c , as a function of .\nFor a given price markup, the higher the congestion e\u00a4ects (large ), the larger is the\nrequired tax on ...rm revenues. Large tax revenues lower steady-state real marginal costs s =\nand hence the gap between s and 1 . At the same time, for a given bargaining friction\n{, lowering steady-state real marginal costs s through (1 f ) increases the ine\u00a2 ciency gap\n{\ns\n, implying that consumption has to be subsidized by more. Therefore, the higher the\nelasticity , the greater are both the optimal revenue tax and the optimal consumption\nsubsidy.\n3.4 E\u00a4ect on Model Dynamics\nWe now analyze how the steady-state distortions a\u00a4ect the variables'dynamics in a \nexible-\nprice model by comparing impulse responses in the competitive model with the e\u00a2 cient ones.\nTaxes are set to zero, c = f = Tb = 0. Two shocks are considered, a technology shock (At\n)\nand a government spending shock (Gt\n). The transmission channels of these shocks can be\nbetter understood by examining the log-linearized equations driving the two labor margins.\nIn the competitive allocation, the hours and hiring decisions, (22) and (23), are given in\nlinearized form by:\n^\nst\n+ ^\nAt\n+ [' (1 + h\n)]^\nht\n= ^\nCt\n^\nt\n= ^\nrt\n+ $\nAh'\nsEt\nf ^\n+ '^\n+ ^\ng + [(1 ) p] Et\nf^\nwhere ^\nrt\n= Et\nf^\ng is the real interest rate and we de...ne $ 1 (1 )\nv\n). A\n\nexible-price version of our model is characterized by constant real marginal costs st\nsuch that ^\nst\n= 0. As emphasized by Monacelli et al.

(2010), who call this the `\nmarginal value of work'\nchannel, because in our model, there are two margins of work: employment and hours.\n^\nt\n= ^\nrt\n+ $\nAh '\nf ^\n+ '^\ng + [(1 ) p] Et\nf^\nThe hours decision is identical in the e\u00a2 cient and in the decentralized allocation under \nexible\nprices, see (46) and (48). Comparing the linearized hiring condition in the competitive\nequilibrium (47) with its e\u00a2 cient counterpart (49), we notice two di\u00a4erences.\nFirst, price stickiness induces ine\u00a2 cient \nuctuations in employment through variations\nin real marginal costs, ^\nst\n. Suppose that after an expansionary demand shock, prices do not\nadjust upwards in the same proportion. Then real marginal costs rise. From (47), we see\nthat the shadow value of a worker rises, because it becomes more expensive to expand hours\nin order to satisfy the higher demand. This e\u00a4ect vanishes under \nexible prices where real\nmarginal costs are constant, ^\nst\nSecond, to the extent that Y=n\ns di\u00a4ers from Y =n\n(1 ), there are ine\u00a2 cient employment\n\nuctuations even under \nexible prices, owing to the steady-state distortions explained above.\nIf the former elasticity, Y=n\ns, is higher than its e\u00a2 cient counterpart, Y =n\n(1 ), hiring\nresponds too strongly to the marginal value of a worker and therefore to hours worked.\nUnder which conditions does the competitive allocation feature employment ine\u00a2 ciencies?\nAs explained above, if distortions (31) and (38) are removed, the gap between the e\u00a2 cient\nand the competitive steady state disappears, which in turn makes the dynamics identical.\nHowever, the bargaining process implies that there is a wedge between the real marginal cost\n(s < 1) and the parameter re\necting wage bargaining ({ > 1).\nFigure 4 compares the impulse responses of output, hours and unemployment in response\nto technology and government spending shocks in the competitive \nexible-price equilibrium\nand in the e\u00a2 cient allocation.

The dashed lines cor-\nrespond to the dynamics in the e\u00a2 cient allocation. Employment is expressed in percentage-point\ndeviations from the steady state. Output and hours are in percent deviations from the steady state.\nA government spending expansion ( ^\nGt\n) implies an increase in expected future taxes which,\nthrough the wealth e\u00a4ect, discourages household consumption and makes workers supply\nmore labor. Hours rise by more than is e\u00a2 cient. This is because the steady-state real\nmarginal wage is too low, see Figure 1, such that a rise in hours raises the wage and therefore\n...rms' production costs only by a small amount. Firms exploit this by expanding hours\nworked by a large amount. As described above, the shadow value of a worker is too sensitive\nto hours worked in the competitive allocation, such that ...rms post too many vacancies and\nemployment rises too much in response to the spending expansion. Consequently, both the\nextensive and the intensive margins are too volatile compared to the e\u00a2 cient allocation.\nAn improvement in technology ( ^\nAt\n) implies that workers have to work fewer hours to\nproduce a given amount of output. The marginal value of a worker increases (driven by\n^\nAt\n), although the rise in productivity is dampened by the reduction in hours. Figure 4\nshows that hours drop by more in the competitive allocation than in the e\u00a2 cient allocation.\nThis reduces the shadow value and hiring by ...rms relative to the e\u00a2 cient case, see (47).\nIn addition, hiring responds by more to hours worked in the competitive allocation than\nin the e\u00a2 cient allocation. It follows that employment increases by less in the competitive\nequilibrium than in the e\u00a2 cient allocation.\nWe show in the next section that the gap between the e\u00a2 cient and the competitive\nallocation gives room for optimal deviations from price stability.\n4 Optimal Monetary Policy\nIn the following, we characterize optimal monetary policy when prices are sticky. To this\nend, we compute the paths that the Ramsey policy maker chooses for the model variables in\norder to maximize household utility, subject to the decision rules of households and ...rms.\nA formal de...nition of the Ramsey policy is given next.\nDe...nition 4 The Ramsey optimal policy is a set of plans for the control variables fht\n, vt\n,\n, Ct\n, st\n, t\nthat, for a given initial employment level n0\n, maximizes household utility\n(1) subject to the implementability conditions (22)-(26).\nThomas (2008) shows that in the absence of wage markup \nuctuations, e.g. in the form\nof nominal or real wage rigidities, strict in\nation targeting is optimal when the steady state\nis e\u00a2 cient. Since real marginal costs are the only time-varying wedges around an e\u00a2 cient\nsteady state, the optimal monetary policy stabilizes real marginal costs over the cycle. This is\ntrue also in our model. Under the optimal tax policy ( f ; c ; Tb ), price stability replicates\nthe e\u00a2 cient allocation. However, if taxes are unavailable and the steady state is distorted,\nprice stability is no longer optimal.\nWe investigate how the optimal policy is a\u00a4ected by steady-state distortions (31) and (38).\nTo this end, we derive the ...rst order conditions of the Ramsey problem and linearize them\naround the steady state. First, we study the optimal dynamics in response to technology\nshocks and government spending shocks. Second, we simulate the model under the Ramsey\npolicy and compute the optimal in\nation volatility.\nThe impulse response functions of in\nation, real wages, output, hours and employment,\nunder the optimal Ramsey policy and in the competitive allocation, are shown in Figure 5.\nThe left and the right panels show the responses to a technology shock and to a spending\nshock, respectively.\nThe ...gure shows that under the optimal policy, in\nation is countercyclical with respect to\nhours worked. After a spending expansion, real marginal costs (and therefore in\nation) need\nto fall in order to compensate for the ine\u00a2 ciently large rise in hours, see (47). In contrast,\na positive technology shock generates an ine\u00a2 ciently large reduction in hours, which has to\nbe o\u00a4set by a rise in in\nation. In the next paragraph, we show that the deviation from price\nstability depends on the size of the two distortions. This ...nding di\u00a4ers from Sunakawa (2013)\nwho shows that the Ramsey policy does not deviate from price stability in a search-and-\nmatching model with right-to-manage and instantaneous hiring. With instantaneous hiring,\na worker'\ns shadow value depends on his marginal productivity. Here, since employment is\npredetermined, a worker'\ns shadow value depends instead on the reduction in hours and in\nthe wage paid to all other workers through the bargaining distortion (31). As shown above,\nhours decrease too much in response to a technology shock at the cost of a small variation\nin employment. This ine\u00a2 ciency is corrected by modifying real marginal costs and therefore\nFigure 5: Competitive and Ramsey Optimal Policy Dynamics\nAnnualized Inflation\nAnnualized Inflation\nReal Wages\nReal Wages\nOutput\nOutput\nHours\nHours\nEmployment\nEmployment\nTechnology shock\nSpending shock\nTechnology shock\nSpending shock\nTechnology shock\nSpending shock\nTechnology shock\nSpending shock\nTechnology shock\nSpending shock\nTechnology shock\nSpending shock\nTechnology shock\nSpending shock\nTechnology shock\nSpending shock\nTechnology shock\nSpending shock\nTechnology shock\nSpending shock\nThe left (right) panel shows the impulse response functions to a positive technology shock (gov-\nernment spending shock).

All other responses are in percent deviations from the steady\nstate.\nin\nation.\nWe now investigate in more detail what the main drivers of the optimal in\nation volatility\nare. As shown in (31) and (38), the steady-state distortions are re\nected by two gaps. First,\nthe gap between real marginal costs s and the intra-...rm bargaining parameter {. Second,\nthe gap between real marginal costs s and the elasticity of matches to vacancies, 1 . We\n...rst consider the optimal in\nation volatility as a function of s.19 In practice, we compute\nthe volatility for a grid of values for \", the elasticity of substitution between goods varieties.\nThe real marginal cost is s = (\" 1) =\". Consider Figure 6.\n19The volatility is given by the standard deviation of annualized in\nation under the Ramsey policy.\nFigure 6: Optimal In\nation Volatility\nInflation Volatility\nInflation Volatility\nInflation Volatility\nThe optimal in\nation volatility is computed as the standard deviation of annualized in\nation (in\npercent). The upper panel displays in\nation volatility as a function of the real marginal cost, s. The\nmiddle panel displays in\nation volatility as a function of the net disutility cost of hours, (1 +\nh\n)='.\nThe lower panel displays in\nation volatility as a function of the workers'bargaining power, .\nThe upper panel in Figure 6 shows that optimal in\nation volatility is 0:18% in our\nbenchmark calibration.20 A high volatility goes hand in hand with low real marginal costs\n(i.e. a high price markup, ). All things equal, higher real marginal costs diminish the steady-\nstate hours distortion as s gets closer to {, see (34).21 At the same time, the steady-state\nemployment distortion is worsened as s deviates more from 1 , see (40). The deviation from\nprice stability therefore depends on the relative size of these two distortions. We can shut\ndown the hours distortion by imposing an optimal consumption subsidy c = c . Since the\nonly distortion left is the employment distortion, we ...nd that volatility of optimal in\nation\nis reduced to 0:09% (not shown).\nWe now have a closer look at the hours distortion, given by (31), which depends on\nthe gap between the real marginal cost, s, and the intra-...rm bargaining parameter, {. As\nmentioned above, a large value of { implies that the wage curve is steep in hours, see (8).\nation volatility ( = y\n21To understand this result, recall that in our benchmark calibration. s = 0:83, { = 3 and 1 = 0:6.\nIt follows from distortion (31) that the ine\u00a2 ciency gap is large since the level of hours is\ntoo low compared to the Walrasian labor market allocation (i.e. { = 1). To con...rm this\nintuition, the middle and lower panels in Figure 6 display the volatility of optimal in\nation\nas a function of (1 + h\n)=' and , respectively, the two drivers of the intra-...rm bargaining\nparameter {.22 Recall that { is a positive function of (1 + h\n)='. If the disutility cost of\nhours is high compared to the returns to hours in production, we are further away from a\nWalrasian labor market and the steady-state distortion resulting from bargaining is larger.\nSimilarly, parameter { is a positive function of the workers'bargaining power . Intuitively,\nreal wages in steady state deviate more from the Walrasian allocation when workers have\ngreater bargaining power. From Figure 1 we see that the real marginal wage is too low, such\nthat wages respond less to hours. Firms exploit this insensitivity of wages by overusing the\nhours margin in response to shocks, at the expense of the employment margin. Hours become\ntoo volatile over the business cycle. This in turn generates optimal in\nation volatility. The\ndeviation from price stability depends on parameters a\u00a4ecting the trade-o\u00a4 between the\nintensive and the extensive margins of labor: the larger is the deviation from Walrasian\nwage setting, {, the greater is the optimal deviation from price stability.\nThis result di\u00a4ers from Sunakawa (2013) who shows that, in the absence of real wage\nrigidities, price stability is optimal in a right-to-manage model with instantaneous hiring.\nThe reason is that in that setup, real wages and hours replicate the Walrasian allocation.\nWe show that the intra-...rm bargaining process combined with predetermined employment\ngenerates optimal deviations from price stability by generating hours and real wages that\ndi\u00a4er from the Walrasian allocation.\n22In practical terms, we vary ', taking (1 + h\n) as given.\n5 Conclusion\nWe study optimal policy in New Keynesian search-and-matching model where ...rms can\nadjust their workforce as well as hours per worker. Firms operate under monopolistic com-\npetition; they set a price and commit to satisfying demand at that price. Since employment\nis predetermined, ...rms adjust hours per worker in a `\nright-to-manage'fashion in order to\nsatisfy demand in the short run. The right-to-manage assumption, combined with wage bar-\ngaining, results in a convex `\nwage curve'\n, such that the real marginal wage is an increasing\nfunction of hours per worker. In a large-...rm model, this wage curve generates an external-\nity since a change in the number of hours per worker a\u00a4ects the wage of all other workers.\nWe show that product market imperfections and labor market frictions combine to reduce\nsteady-state output and hours below their e\u00a2 cient levels. Since the real marginal wage is too\nlow at the steady state, wages respond little to hours worked. Firms exploit this real wage\nrigidity by overusing the hours margin when adjusting their production level in response\nto shocks. As a result, hours are too volatile along the business cycle. A policy of strict\nin\nation targeting is suboptimal in this environment. In\nation can be used to a\u00a4ect the real\nwage set through bargaining and dampen ine\u00a2 cient \nuctuations in hours.\n"
