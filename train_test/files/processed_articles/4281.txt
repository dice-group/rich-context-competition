Neuropathological hallmarks of\nAD include loss of neurons, deposition of neuritic plaques and\nreactive astrogliosis in affected brain regions, particularly the\nhippocampus and neocortex (Masliah, 2008). Accumulation\nof Ab (amyloid b-peptide) fragments and sustained disrup-\ntion of intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i\n) homoeo-\nstasis are prevailing hypotheses for the pathogenesis of AD\nThe role and contribution of astrocytes to the patho-\nphysiology of AD and the molecular and signalling mechan-\nisms that potentially underlie them are still very poorly\nunderstood. Calcium signalling in astrocytes in the form of\nintracellular calcium transients and intercellular calcium\nwaves putatively play critical roles in neuronal\u00adastrocytic\nbidirectional communication (Pasti et al., 1997; Scemes and\n1 These authors contributed equally to this work.\n2 To whom correspondence should be addressed (email gsilva@ucsd.edu).\nAbbreviations: Ab, amyloid b-peptide; AD, Alzheimer's disease; APP, amyloid precursor protein; A.U., arbitrary units; BAPTA/AM, 1,2-bis-(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-\nN,N,N9,N9-tetra-acetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester); DAPI, 49,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; FBS, foetal bovine serum; Fluo-4AM, Fluo-4 acetoxymethylester; GFAP, glial\nfibrillary acidic protein; KHB, Krebs Hepes buffer; PDL, poly-D-lysine.\nE 2010 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://\ncreativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is\nproperly cited.\nneuronal activity and survival (Parri et al., 2001; Takano et\nal., 2006). There is mounting evidence that [Ca2+]i\ndysregula-\ntion in astrocytes contributes to the pathophysiology of AD.\nIntracellular calcium transients associated with Ab exposure\nin astrocytes result in calcium-dependent glutathione\ndepletion in neurons and the formation of reactive oxygen\nspecies in astrocytes that directly produce neuronal death\nchanges in presenilin-transfected astrocytes induced by\npharmacological treatment with ATP or glutamate in the\npresence of Ab required lower concentrations of these\nagonists for responses to manifest themselves (Johnston et\nal., 2006). Intercellular calcium waves in astrocyte networks\nin vitro can be mechanically induced after Ab treatment, and\nthey travel further and faster than comparable waves induced\nin the absence of Ab (Haughey and Mattson, 2003).\nImportantly, spontaneously forming intercellular calcium\nwaves have recently been shown in vivo in the APP (amyloid\nprecursor protein)/PS1 (presenilin 1) Alzheimer's transgenic\nmouse model independent of neuronal hyperactivity\n(Kuchibhotla et al., 2009), although the nature of the\nexperiments did not allow testing whether Ab itself was\nresponsible and sufficient for the observed waves or whether\nthere was a signalling effect from other cell types (e.g.\nmicroglia). Spontaneous intercellular calcium waves have not\nbeen observed in vitro in isolated astrocyte cultures in\nresponse to direct Ab stimulation. The consequences of these\nwaves on neuronal physiology or the clinical manifestation of\nAD are not yet known.\nChanges in intracellular calcium levels have also been\nimplicated in the regulation of gene expression in both\nneurons and astrocytes (Dolmetsch et al., 1998; Morita et al.,\n2003). Hence it is possible that changes in astrocytic calcium\ndynamics induced by Ab may molecularly contribute to the\npathogenesis of AD. Reactive astrogliosis in AD characterized\nby up-regulation of GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) and\nassociated with Ab plaques and the formation of abnormal\nneurites that contribute to the formation of neuritic plaques\nand neurofibrillary tangles (Casas et al., 2004). The molecular\nand cellular consequences of intracellular calcium dysregula-\ntion in neurons in AD and its effects on neurotoxicity are well\ndocumented (LaFerla, 2002), but little is known regarding the\nmolecular response of astrocyte calcium signalling to Ab\nexposure and its effects on the cell.\nIn the present study, we show that Ab alone at relatively low\nconcentrations is directly able to induce intracellular calcium\ntransients and spontaneous intercellular calcium waves in\nisolated astrocytes in purified cultures, raising the possibility of\na potential direct effect of Ab exposure on astrocytes in vivo in\nthe Alzheimer's brain. Waves did not occur immediately after\nAb treatment, but were delayed by many minutes before\nspontaneously forming, suggesting that intracellular signalling\nmechanisms required sufficient time to activate before\nintercellular effects at the network level become evident.\nFurthermore, the dynamics of intercellular calcium waves were\nheterogeneous, with distinct radial or longitudinal propagation\norientations. Lastly, we also show that changes in GFAP and\nS100B expression levels are affected by Ab-induced calcium\nchanges differently, with GFAP being more dependent on\ncalcium levels than S100B, which was up-regulated after\nexposure to Ab independent of calcium levels.\nAstrocyte cell culture\nAll experiments were carried out in accordance with approved\nprotocols from the Institutional Animal Care and Use\nCommittee of the University of California (San Diego, CA,\nU.S.A.). Primary cortical cultures were prepared from postnatal\nday 1 Sprague\u00adDawley rats (Harlan Sprague Dawley,\nIndianapolis, IN, U.S.A.) as previously described (Haughey and\nMattson, 2003). Briefly, 1-day-old Sprague\u00adDawley rat pups\nwere sacrificed by anaesthesia overdose. Their brains were\nremoved and the cerebral cortices dissected in sterile KHB\n; pH 7.3). Cells were\nmechanically dissociated in KHB through a 70 mm cell strainer\n(BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, U.S.A.) and cultured in Modified\nEagle's Medium (Cellgro/Fisher, Herndon, VA, U.S.A.) with 10%\n(v/v) heat-inactivated horse serum (Omega Scientific, Tarzana,\nCA, U.S.A.), 1% penicillin\u00adstreptomycin (Gibco/Invitrogen,\nCarlsbad, CA, U.S.A.) and 1% Glut-Max (Gibco/Invitrogen).\nBefore trypsinizing the cell cultures, they were hand shaken for\n5 min, resulting in the detachment of contaminating cell types\nsuch as oligodendrocytes and microglia sitting on top of the\nastroglial monolayer. Manual shaking resulted in microglia-free\ncultures similar to plates purified by shaking in an orbital shaker\nfor at least 12 h. For both approaches, we tested for microglia\nusing immunocytochemistry and saw no significant differences\n(results not shown). Astroglial cultures were trypsinized and\nsubcultured once to obtain highly enriched astroglial cultures\ntwice per week, and all cultures were used within 2 passages.\nAstrocytes were trypsinized and plated on to PDL (poly-D-\nlysine)-coated 35 mm glass bottom dishes (MakTek, Ashland,\nMA, U.S.A.) at a density of 16105 cells per well. Cells were\n/95% atmospheric air to\nconfluency (,90%) prior to performing calcium imaging\nstudies and immunocytochemistry.\nCalcium imaging\nCortical astrocyte cultures of ,90% confluency were washed\ntwice with KHB and incubated with 8 mM Fluo-4AM (Fluo-4\nacetoxymethyl ester; Molecular Probes/Invitrogen, Carlsbad,\nS-K Chow and others\n16 E 2010 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commerical use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nCA, U.S.A.) in KHB for 40 min at room temperature (25\u00b0C).\nExcess dye was removed by washing twice with KHB, and an\nadditional incubation of 20 min at room temperature was\nperformed to equilibrate intracellular dye concentration.\nUnder specific experimental conditions, cells were pretreated\nBAPTA/AM [1,2-bis-(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N9,N9-\ntetra-acetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester); A1076;\nSigma) was also used in certain experiments. Typically, 5 mM\nknown to be neurotoxic in vivo and in vitro (Emre et al., 1992;\nKowall et al., 1992), was used in the experiment, and the time\npoint of Ab dosing was regarded as zero time. We did nine\nintercellular calcium experiments, with 8\u00ad10 randomly\nselected fields of view observed for each, during which\nreal-time movies of 4.5 min were taken of primary astrocyte\ncultures at three time points (0, 15 and 30 min) under five\nconditions (control, Ab, Ab+thapsigargin, Ab+BAPTA/AM and\nAb+BAPTA). In each experiment, 5 mM of Ab was bath applied\nand 4.5 min movies were recorded at randomly chosen fields\nmin post-administration of Ab). All movies were acquired at 5\nHz using a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER digital camera (Hamamatsu\nPhotonics, Hamamatsu City, Japan). Visualization of Ca2+\nindicator dye fluorescence was done using a 488 nm (FITC)\nfilter on an Olympus IX81 inverted fluorescence confocal\nmicroscope (Olympus Optical, Tokyo, Japan) using a 620\nUPlanFLN objective (NA50.5; Olympus Optical). Images were\nacquired with custom-written LabVIEW (National\nInstruments, Austin, TX, U.S.A.) software developed in our\nlaboratory. Similar experiments were performed with the\nnon-bioactive control of Ab 1\u00ad40, where we used a reverse\ncessed in ImageJ (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/) and Matlab\n(Mathworks, Natick, MA, U.S.A.).\nQuantification of Ca2+ transients\nQuantification of Ca2+ transients was performed using\nmethods similar to those described previously (Yu et al.,\n2009). Briefly, using ImageJ [an NIH (National Institutes of\nHealth; Bethesda, MD, U.S.A.)-funded open source JAVA-\nbased morphometric application], individual cell fluorescence\nintensity versus time was extracted. The fluorescence\nintensity of Fluo-4AM is assumed to be proportional to\ncalcium concentration. The data were run through a low pass\nfilter and a running average filter of 10 frames implemented\nin Matlab. In order to identify individual [Ca2+]i\ntransients, we\nidentified periods of sustained increase in fluorescence\nintensity for each centroid. A first-derivative filter was used\nto distinguish significant and sustained increases in calcium\n(i.e. 10 or more consecutive frames or 2 s at 5 Hz, with\npositive derivative values). Cells with sustained calcium\nincreases were considered to have transient responses. The\npercentage of active cells was the ratio of the number of cells\nthat displayed calcium transients to the total number of cells\nin the field of view, while the average transient frequency (in\nHz) was the ratio of the total number of transients to the\nnumber of active cells acquired per movie. For the observed\ncalcium waves, the average speed of calcium wave propaga-\ntion was calculated by plotting the radius from the centre of\nthe wave against activation time of the cell involved and\nfitting the slope of the line through the scatter plot. All\ncalculations and graphs were done using Matlab and\nSigmaPlot (Systat, San Jose, CA, U.S.A.), and the results were\nexpressed as means\u00a1S.E.M. In all the cases, consistent\nimaging settings were used across experimental conditions\nand individual experiments (e.g. frame rates, exposure times\netc.).\nGFAP and S100B immunocytochemistry\nCultures grown on PDL-coated dishes were fixed with 4%\n(w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min.

Furthermore, active cells under Ab-\ntreated conditions that showed transient responses had on\naverage a higher frequency of responses relative to active\nP,0.001; Figure 1B). In all cases, we measured baseline levels\nof calcium transient response frequencies before exposure to\nAb for 90 s, and with results statistically similar to untreated\nAb controls. The quality and signal-to-noise ratio of\nmeasured transient responses for both experimental and\ncontrol conditions were comparable (Figure 1C). Ab-induced\nincreases were significantly reduced by the perturbation of\nintracellular and extracellular calcium sources, suggesting\nthat the observed changes were directly due to calcium-\ndependent mechanisms. Pretreatment with thapsigargin,\nwhich raises cytosolic calcium levels by preventing the\npumping of calcium back into the endoplasmic reticulum,\ndiminished both the number of active cells and the transient\nresponse frequency increase evoked by Ab (39\u00a114% in\nthapsigargin-treated cells versus 92\u00a13.5% for Ab-treated\nP,0.001).

Control experiments using the biologically\ninactive reverse 40\u00ad1 Ab did not show any changes in the\nfrequency of calcium transient responses in individual cells or\nthe fraction of active cells relative to untreated controls (results\nnot shown). The effects of Ab on calcium transients lasted for at\nleast 45 min after dosing. We did not use data beyond 45 min in\norder to avoid potential confounding effects due to unrelated\nchanges in the cultures, such as decreasing cell viability with\ntime, even though we routinely confirmed good cell viability\nafter the 45 min experimental window by using a calcein/\nethidium live/dead cell cytotoxicity assay.\nAb induces spontaneous time-delayed\nintercellular calcium waves in astrocytes\nPrevious work has shown that mechanically induced inter-\ncellular calcium waves in astrocyte cultures pretreated with\nAb travel longer distances and at greater speeds than induced\nwaves in control cultures not treated with Ab (Haughey and\nMattson, 2003). In vivo in the APP/SP1 transgenic mouse\nmodel of AD, spontaneous waves in astrocyte networks have\nbeen seen (Kuchibhotla et al., 2009). We examined whether\nAb by itself is sufficient to directly induce spontaneous waves\nin culture in isolated astrocytes. We bath applied Ab and\nrecorded movies of randomly chosen fields of view in 15 min\nintervals for 90 min after Ab treatment. In contrast with\nuntreated control cultures, which never showed any res-\nponses, all of the 8\u00ad10 randomly chosen fields in eight of the\nnine Ab-treated independent experiments displayed spon-\ntaneous time-delayed waves. Interestingly, two distinct\npatterns of calcium waves were observed: seven experiments\ndisplayed waves that propagated radially from an initial focal\nlocus (Figures 2A and 2B), consistent with patterns of\ninduced waves reported in most studies (Cornell-Bell et al.,\net al., 2002), whereas one experiment exhibited waves that\npropagated linearly (Figures 2C and 2D). This is similar to in\nvivo waves seen in the cerebellum (Hoogland et al., 2009). The\ndistances travelled by radial and linear waves were 75\u00a121\noccurred not earlier than 10 min and no later than 75 min\nafter Ab dosing. The significant delay between the application\nof Ab and the initiation of waves suggests that metabotropic\nsignalling mechanisms may underlie the initiation of wave\nevents in astrocyte networks, and excludes the possibility that\nthey were the result of experimental artefacts (e.g.\nmechanical disruption of cells during bath application of\nAb). We also checked for and confirmed good cell viability\nafter the 90 min recording period. Interestingly, some cells in\nthe path of the wave front were not activated and did not\ndisplay intracellular calcium transients, resulting in spatially\nheterogeneous activation patterns. This is consistent with\nprevious results from our laboratory (Macdonald et al., 2008).\nIt is possible that the absence of observed waves in the one\nexperiment could have been due to chance if they occurred\noutside our randomly chosen fields of view or during intervals\nbetween successive recordings, since we did not selectively\ninduce them in any way. Control experiments using the\nreverse 40\u00ad1 Ab never showed spontaneous calcium waves,\nsimilar to untreated controls (results not shown).\nAb induces changes in S100B and GFAP\nexpression in astrocytes by 12 h\nFinally, we also looked at the relationship between Ab-\ninduced intracellular Ca2+ transients and reactive gliosis by\nmeasuring GFAP and S100B expression levels after Ab dosing\nusing immunocytochemistry (Figure 3). Elevated levels of\nS100B and GFAP have been shown to occur in astrocytes\nassociated with neuritic AD plaques (Pike et al., 1994;\nSimpson et al., 2008). Two previous studies have looked at\nchanges in the immunocytochemical expression of GFAP,\nS100B, vimentin, as well as other putative markers of reactive\nnature of the analyses and experimental preparations make a\ncomparison of those studies to our own results difficult: in\nthe former study, the authors claimed that GFAP and S100B\nwere up-regulated at 72 h after exposure to a number of Ab\nsequences, whereas the latter study claimed that GFAP and\nvimentin but not S100B were up-regulated in a subpopula-\npeptide. However, both studies used astrocytes that had been\nmaintained in culture for very long periods of time prior to\nexperiments, 21 and 14 days respectively, and in both cases\nthey based their results on qualitative observations from\nmicrographs without any quantification or image analysis.\nInterestingly, Meske and colleagues did not observe any\nchanges in calcium signalling (Meske et al., 1998).\nImages of 10 randomly chosen fields (640) were taken at\nthree time points after Ab dosing (12, 24 and 48 h) under six\nconditions (control, Ab, Ab+thapsigargin, thapsigargin,\nAb+BAPTA/AM and BAPTA/AM) in three experiments.\nDifferences in fluorescent intensities between experimental\nconditions were similar at different time points, so we\nevaluated the data for statistical significance at the earliest\ntime point in which we observed changes (Figure 3). We found\nsignificant changes in S100B and GFAP expression by 12 h after\nAb exposure. The average fluorescence intensity of GFAP at this\ntime point was 492\u00a112 A.U. (arbitrary units) for controls and\nsample; see the legend to Figure 3), whereas for S100B the\nintensity level for Ab treated cells was 602\u00a121 compared with\n435\u00a16 for controls. Thapsigargin and BAPTA by themselves\nhad no effect on either GFAP or S100B expression levels relative\nto controls. For GFAP, the application of Ab in combination\nwith thapsigargin or BAPTA significantly decreased the effects\nmeasured with Ab by itself and brought fluorescence levels\nback to those observed for untreated controls (458\u00a19 for Ab\nAmyloid b-peptide induced astrocyte calcium signalling\nE 2010 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commerical use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nboth). On the other hand, S100B expression levels did not\nchange relative to Ab levels when challenged with Ab in\ncombination with thapsigargin or BAPTA, which measured\nDISCUSSION\nWe examined the effects of Ab on the dynamics of\nspontaneous intracellular calcium transients and intercellular\ncalcium waves in networks of primary cortical astrocytes in\nvitro, and explored Ab-induced changes in the expression of\nGFAP and S100B. Ab increased the frequency of intracellular\ncalcium transients in individual cells and the total number of\nactivated astrocytes. It also induced delayed spontaneous\nintercellular calcium waves. The recruitment of participating\ncells and the dynamics of observed waves were spatially\nheterogeneous, in the sense that not all cells within the area\naffected by the wave were necessarily activated, and waves\ndisplayed distinct radial or longitudinal directional propaga-\ntion patterns.

Indeed,\nATP vesicular release has been implicated as the principal\nmechanism underlying intercellular calcium waves in astrocyte\nnetworks, with a minimal contribution through gap junctions\nThese results complement the work by Kuchibhotla and\ncolleagues (Kuchibhotla et al., 2009).

However, microglia could also modulate\nastrocytic calcium signalling independent of any neuronal\ncontribution, and have been shown to migrate and cluster near\nAb plaque-forming areas in the hippocampus and neocortex\n2001). Microglia internalize microaggregates of Ab and secret\npro-inflammatory factors including IL-1b (interleukin-1b), TNF\n(tumour necrosis factor) and nitric oxide, which in turn affect\ncalcium homoeostasis and transients in surrounding neurons\n2003). Furthermore, microglia derived from AD patients show\nsignificantly higher basal [Ca2+]i\ncan also cause calcium elevations in neighbouring cells by\nregulating the amount of extracellular calcium (Barger and\nastrocytes by themselves are capable of spontaneously forming\nsignalling networks by initiating and propagating intercellular\ncalcium waves under stress conditions similar to those present\nin AD in the absence of signalling factors and cues from other\ncell types. The shorter distance and lower speed of the waves in\nour experiments compared with those reported by Kuchibhotla\net al. (2009) may be due to an augmented effect caused by\nother cell types or signalling factors in vivo missing from the\nreduced in vitro preparations we studied. The molecular and\ncellular mechanisms that produce these waves and any effects\non the pathophysiology of AD are yet to be confirmed in vivo\nand will require much further investigation.\nLastly, in our experiments, Ab induced changes in the protein\nexpression of both S100B and GFAP by 12 h after exposure to\nthe peptide. Measured relative changes of normalized fluor-\nescence intensity levels of anti-GFAP and anti-S100B signals in\nimmunocytochemistry have been used as reliable markers\nassociated with reactive gliosis (Dyer and Cepko, 2000; Wu et\nbetween [Ca2+]i\nand the expression levels of GFAP after\nexposure to Ab. Reducing [Ca2+]i\nby chelating with BAPTA or\napplying thapsigargin reduced GFAP levels to those measured\nunder control conditions. Thus it appears that changes in GFAP\nexpression are dependent on changes in calcium homoeostasis\ninduced by Ab, rather than a direct effect of Ab itself. S100B\nlevels, on the other hand, were not affected by application of\nBAPTA or thapsigargin, suggesting a potentially more direct\neffect of Ab on S100B up-regulation. Interestingly, GFAP plays\na role in trafficking of dense core vesicles containing ANF (atrial\nnatriuretic factor) (Pangrsic et al., 2007); and since intercellular\ncalcium waves in astrocytes are mediated primarily by vesicular\nATP, this could play a role in the pathological propagation of\nsignals throughout the astrocytic network.\nThe pathophysiology of AD is multidimensional and\ncomplex. While previous efforts have focused on the effects\nof Ab on neurons, the results we present here add to other\nwork implicating a potential, but as yet poorly understood,\nrole for astrocytes in the pathogenesis of AD. The picture that\nis emerging, however, is one where astrocytes directly and\nrobustly respond to the presence of Ab in a number of ways\nknown to affect the health and function of neurons. It is\nlikely that a complete understanding of the pathology of AD\nwill require an understanding of the metabolic and functional\nresponses and effects that astrocytes have. Such an\nunderstanding may suggest novel pharmacological targets\nto either slow down or reverse the resultant neuronal death.\nFUNDING\nThis work was supported by funds from the NINDS (National\nInstitute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke) at the NIH\nREFERENCES\nAbramov AY, Canevari L, Duchen MR (2003) Changes in intracellular calcium\nand glutathione in astrocytes as the primary mechanism of amyloid\nAbramov AY, Canevari L, Duchen MR (2004) Calcium signals induced by\namyloid b peptide and their consequences in neurons and astrocytes in\nArcuino G, Lin JH, Takano T, Liu C, Jiang L, Gao Q, Kang J, Nedergaard M\n(2002) Intercellular calcium signaling mediated by point-source burst\nBarger SW, Basile AS (2001) Activation of microglia by secreted amyloid\nprecursor protein evokes release of glutamate by cystine exchange and\nBenveniste EN, Nguyen VT, O'Keefe GM (2001) Immunological aspects of\nBowser D, Khakh B (2007) Vesicular ATP is the predominant cause of\nCasas C, Sergeant N, Itier JM, Blanchard V, Wirths O, van der Kolk N,\nVingtdeux V, van de Steeg E, Ret G, Canton T, Drobecq H, Clark A, Bonici\nB, Delacourte A, Benavides J, Schmitz C, Tremp G, Bayer TA, Benoit P,\nPradier L (2004) Massive CA1/2 neuronal loss with intraneuronal and N-\nterminal truncated Ab42 accumulation in a novel Alzheimer transgenic\nCoco S, Calegari F, Pravettoni E, Pozzi D, Taverna E, Rosa P, Matteoli M,\nVerderio C (2003) Storage and release of ATP from astrocytes in culture.
