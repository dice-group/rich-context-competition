Browning,2 and Ming Wen3\n1Department of Health Studies, University of Chicago, Illinois.\n2Department of Sociology, Ohio State University, Columbus.\n3Department of Sociology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City.\nObjectives. Racial differences in self-rated health at older ages are well documented. African Americans consistently\nreport poorer health, even when education, income, and other health status indicators are controlled. The extent to which\nneighborhood-level characteristics mediate this association remains largely unexplored. We ask whether neighborhood\nsocial and economic resources help to explain the self-reported health differential between African Americans and Whites.\nNeighborhoods\u00adCommunity Survey, and selected years of the 1991\u00ad2000 Metropolitan Chicago Information Center\u00ad\nMetro Survey, we examine the impact of neighborhood structure and social organization on self-rated health for a sample\nof Chicago residents aged 55 and older (N \u00bc 636). We use multilevel modeling techniques to examine both individual and\nneighborhood-level covariates.\nResults. Findings indicate that affluence, a neighborhood structural resource, contributes positively to self-rated health\nand attenuates the association between race and self-rated health. When the level of affluence in a community is low,\nresidential stability is negatively related to health. Collective efficacy, a measure of neighborhood social resources, is not\nassociated with health for this older population.\nDiscussion. Analyses incorporating individual and neighborhood-level contextual indicators may further our\nunderstanding of the complex association between sociodemographic factors and health.\n``HOW WOULD you rate your health? Would you consider\nyour health excellent, good, fair, or poor?'' This query,\nnow standard in social surveys of health and well-being, has\nrevealed a curious pattern in the responses of older African\nAmerican and White individuals: African Americans consis-\ntently report poorer health, even when age, chronic health\nconditions, and a host of additional individual-level covariates\nare considered (Clark & Maddox, 1992; Mutchler & Burr,\nAmerican persons who reported fair or poor health was 15.4%\nas compared with 8.7% for their White counterparts (National\nCenter for Health Statistics, 1998). Although the gap between\nBlacks and Whites has narrowed slightly in recent years, it is\nstill most pronounced among those at older ages: Over 44% of\nAfrican Americans aged 75 and older reported fair or poor\nhealth as compared with 31% of Whites (Kington & Nickens,\n2001). Whereas some research does suggest that Blacks and\nWhites may evaluate their health differently (Ferraro & Kelley-\nAndersen, Mullner, and Cornelius (1987) and other psycho-\nmetric investigations of the validity of self-reports of health\nhave led researchers to believe that, in general, differences\ndetected between groups are real rather than an artifact of the\nmeasurement method (Cunningham, Hays, Burton, & Kington,\nevidence of a substantive race differential in self-reports of\nhealth but, as yet, has not yielded a convincing explanation for\nthis discrepancy.\nBecause Black race is associated with lower socioeconomic\nstatus (SES) and lower SES with poor health, research has\nfocused on the study of individual-level SES as a mediating\nvariable between race and self-rated health (Mutchler & Burr,\n1991). In general, this work hypothesizes that education,\nincome, and wealth account for racial differences in self-rated\nhealth; that is, once these factors are incorporated into the\nanalysis, any difference by race should disappear. Results are\nmixed, with most research continuing to report an unexplained\nhealth differential between African Americans and Whites\n(Kington & Nickens, 2001). In the case of self-reported\nfunctional status, Clark and Maddox (1992) note that Blacks\nreport poorer functional status than non-Blacks even when\nincome and education are controlled.\nAbsent from these analyses is the social context in which\nevaluations of health are reported. Although individual-level\nsocial and economic indicators clearly affect health (Williams\n& Collins, 1995), there is a growing body of literature linking\nthe social environment in which people reside with their\nhealth (Browning & Cagney, 2002; Diez Roux, Nieto, &\n2002). Research on the relationship between place and health\nvaries by geographic unit (e.g., state, county, community\narea), but evidence points to the neighborhood in which\npeople live as a meaningful entity; the proximal social and\neconomic environment may contribute to health via, for\ninstance, noxious conditions, stress, or limited access to care\n(Krause, 1996). In this article, we extend previous research by\nJournal of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES Copyright 2005 by The Gerontological Society of America\nturning our attention to these characteristics of community. In\ndoing so, we aim to explore whether neighborhood social\ncontext is reflected in self-assessments of health and whether\nit has any explanatory power in an examination of racial\ndifferences in self-assessed health. To guide our investigation,\nwe employ collective efficacy theory (Sampson, Raudenbush,\n& Earls, 1997). This theoretical perspective emphasizes the\nrole of neighborhood-based economic and social resources in\nenhancing individual health. We hypothesize that some part of\nthe racial disparity in older persons' self-assessed health can\nbe attributed to variation in these neighborhood-level factors.\nWe focus this investigation on older persons both because the\nrace differential in self-reported health is greater at older ages\nand because we expect the role of neighborhood to be more\nimportant for older than younger adults (Robert & Li, 2001).\nOur hypothesis is grounded in theoretical and empirical\npropositions that point to the salience of neighborhood context\nfor older adults. Many adults age in place; fully one-third of\nolder adults have lived in their communities for 30 years or\nlonger (Bryan & Morrison, 2004). Length of residence\nimplies a commitment to the community, and, indeed, this\nis borne out by the data. Putnam's research (2000) indicates\nthat a community with a disproportionate number of elderly\nresidents is likely to have a more active neighborhood watch,\nbetter social services, and, in general, greater engagement in\ncivic affairs. Although older adults may have more time, and\na greater tendency, to engage in community life, they are,\npractically speaking, also much more dependent on the\ncontext that their community provides. Neighborhood context\nmay in large part determine whether it is feasible to take\na walk, go food shopping, or remain engaged in community-\nbased activities such as church (Robert & Li, 2001; Ross,\n2000). The circumference of social space may constrict as one\nages, making the immediate community environment all the\nmore important. Indeed, Balfour and Kaplan (2002) found that\nolder adults who live in neighborhoods with poorer-quality\nenvironments (e.g., high crime, heavy traffic, excessive noise,\npoor lighting) experience a greater risk of functional de-\nterioration. Krause (1996) also found that deteriorating\nneighborhood conditions exerted an independent effect on\nhealth. In general, the antecedent literature examining the link\nbetween individual well-being and the level of neighborhood\ncriminal activity indicates that higher crime rates are\nassociated with stress, community withdrawal, and fear of\nleaving one's home (Ferraro, 1995). For older persons, this\nexposure may exacerbate an already compromised health\nstate, and there may be few mechanisms in place to buffer\nthese negative effects (Thompson & Krause, 1998).\nWe investigate the health effects of neighborhood context\nusing a multilevel approach. This provides the opportunity to\ndisentangle individual and neighborhood-level effects (Rauden-\nChicago Neighborhoods\u00adCommunity Survey, and the 1995,\nMetro Survey. This combination of data sources offers a unique\nopportunity to explore the role of neighborhood context in the\nassociation between race and self-reported health status.\nCollective efficacy theory emphasizes neighborhood social\nresources in the form of mutual trust and solidarity (social\ncohesion) and expectations for action (informal social control)\nin explaining the impact of neighborhood structural factors on\nresidents' well-being (see Sampson et al. [1997] and Sampson,\nMorenoff, & Earls [1999] for an extended discussion of the\ncollective efficacy framework and its specific operationaliza-\ntion). The collective efficacy framework and the social\ndisorganization perspective on which it is based (Shaw &\nMcKay, 1969) point to two key structural conditions thought to\nattenuate neighborhood social cohesion and informal social\ncontrol: the prevalence of poverty, or, more generally, economic\ndisadvantage, and the aggregate stability of neighborhood\nresidents. Extending this basic model, recent contributions to\ncollective efficacy theory have stressed the critical role of\nneighborhood affluence in generating the social conditions that\nsupport a cohesive and trusting environment (Morenoff,\nwork builds, in part, on Wilson's theoretical framework (1987),\nwhich emphasizes the benefits of economic heterogeneity and\nthe presence of affluent residents (i.e., middle and upper-middle\nclass). Relatively little attention, however, has been paid to the\nrole of affluence in the literature on neighborhood and health\nCagney, 2003); socioeconomically advantaged residents may\nhave the resources to mobilize on behalf of a health-enhancing\nenvironment. The prevalence of economic resources and\nassociated higher levels of collective efficacy may contribute\nto the provision of health services, the maintenance of safe\nrecreational space, and the management of neighborhood\nphysical hazards--all critical for community-dwelling older\nadults. Specific mechanisms through which collective efficacy,\nin particular, may contribute to health include the social control\nof health-related behaviors and conditions and the positive\npsychosocial processes that generate a protective effect for\nhealth (House, Landis, & Umberson, 1988). Figure 1 illustrates\nthe connections between neighborhood structure, social organi-\nzation, and health.\nSelf-assessments of health may reflect the impact of collective\nefficacy more readily than other measures of health status due to\nthe nature and scope of the self-rated health question. Recent\nresearch indicates that self-assessments of health tap energy,\nFigure 1. Social organization and collective efficacy theories.\nactive functioning, and perceptions about social support\n(Benyamini, Idler, Leventhal, & Leventhal, 2000). These do-\nmains may be particularly responsive to environmental change;\nfunctional well-being and energy, for instance, could be con-\nsiderably lessened in a community context where one is afraid to\nwalk outside. In addition, the relationship between collective\nefficacy and self-rated health may be heightened for the very\nyoung and the very old--vulnerable population groups may\ndepend more readily on the community to facilitate daily\ninteractions and transitions (e.g., walking to school, grocery\nshopping, attending church).\nMETHODS\nData\nThree data sources are used to explore the mediating effect of\nneighborhood on the relationship between race and self-rated\nhealth at older ages. They are the 1990 Decennial Census; the\nNeighborhoods\u00adCommunity Survey (PHDCN-CS); and the\nCenter\u00adMetro Survey (MCIC-MS). The outcome of interest,\nself-rated health, and thus the sample N come from the MCIC-\nMS. Neighborhood-level characteristics are constructed from\nthe other two data sets and are merged into the individual-level\nMCIC-MS. MCIC-MS respondents were geocoded using\ncensus tract identifiers and were merged with the PHDCN-CS\non that basis. The sample was restricted to individuals 55 years\nof age or older (N \u00bc 636). Table 1 illustrates the data sets and\nsample years used in this study.\nMeasures of neighborhood structural characteristics are taken\nfrom the 1990 Census. These include measures of affluence,\npoverty, and residential stability. Measures of neighborhood\nsocial processes are constructed from the PHDCN-CS (the text\nto follow explains how these variables were constructed, but the\nindividual-level sample size is not directly relevant to this\nanalysis because we use only summary covariates constructed\nfrom this data set). The PHDCN-CS asks questions about the\ncommunity in which respondents live. It is a probability sample\nmeaningful ``neighborhood clusters'' (NCs)--aggregations of\ntwo to three census tracts designed to more accurately represent\nthe practical and ecological boundaries of Chicago neighbor-\nhoods. NCs were designed to maintain relative population\nhomogeneity with respect to racial/ethnic, socioeconomic,\nhousing, and family structure characteristics (NCs average\nSampson et al., 1997). The sampling strategy of the PHDCN-CS\nwas intended to capture a within-NC sample size sufficient to\nestimate neighborhood characteristics based on aggregated\nindividual-level data. The purpose of this strategy was to ensure\nthe reliability of neighborhood-level measures of social pro-\ncesses. The response rate was 75%. Our analysis includes\nresidents from 246 Chicago neighborhoods. Neighborhoods not\nincluded in this analysis were those that did not have an\nadequate population base 55 years or over. The dependent\nvariable and individual-level predictors are drawn from the\nMCIC-MS. The MCIC-MS is a serial cross-section of adults\nages 18 and older who reside in the city of Chicago (Taylor,\n2001). The response rate for the MCIC-MS was approximately\n55% across the 10 cross-sectional samples. Because the MCIC-\nMS did not achieve as high a response rate as the PHCDN-CS,\nwe conducted a validity assessment by comparing the PHDCN-\nCS with selected years from the MCIC-MS. The distributions\nacross demographic characteristics such as gender, age, and race\nin these MCIC-MS waves were similar, indicating that the\nMCIC-MS adequately represents the Chicago population.\nDependent measure. --Our dependent variable is a measure\nof self-rated health (Goldstein, Siegel, & Boyer, 1984; Wilson &\nKaplan, 1995). The psychometric and health status assessment\nliteratures document that self-rated health measures are reliable\nand exhibit construct and criterion validity (George, 2001;\nPatrick & Erickson, 1993). For instance, self-rated health has\nbeen shown to predict mortality (Idler & Benyamini, 1997;\nKaplan, Salonen, Cohen, Brand, Syme, & Puska, 1988),\nmorbidity (Ferraro, Farmer, & Wybraniec, 1997), subsequent\ndisability (Idler & Kasl, 1995), and health care utilization\n(Malmstrom, Sundquist, & Johansson, 1999). In addition, it has\nbeen used in prior studies examining the link between\nneighborhood context and health (Browning & Cagney, 2002;\nKrause, 1996). Although validity assessments of the self-rated\nhealth measure across dimensions such as gender, race, and\nethnicity still merit further exploration (Idler & Benyamini,\n1997), initial investigations indicate that its predictive capacity\nis comparable for Latinos, African Americans, and Whites\n& Wolinsky, 1994). The MCIC-MS asks, ``In general, would\nyou say your health is: excellent, good, fair, or poor?'' We treat\nself-rated health as an ordered categorical variable.\nIndependent measures. --To capture the economic profile of\nthe community, we focus on the prevalence of poor and upper/\nmiddle-class residents as defined by income from the 1990\nCensus. Neighborhood poverty is operationalized as the\nproportion of residents with incomes below the 1990 federal\npoverty threshold ($13,359 for a household of four). Neighbor-\nhood affluence is operationalized as the percentage of house-\nholds with incomes $50,000 or over. A residential stability scale\nwas constructed based on scores from a factor analysis of\nmeasures of housing tenure (percentage living in the same house\nsince at least 1985) and the percentage of housing occupied by\nowners (factor loadings exceeded .75). (The analysis employed\nalpha-scoring factor analysis with an oblique rotation. Scores\nfrom principal components analyses yielded the same pattern of\neffects in multivariate analyses of health. Analyses are available\nfrom the first author upon request.)\nTable 1. Data Sources by Year Represented\nDecennial Census *\nMCIC-MS * * *\nNotes: PHDCN-CS \u00bc Project on Human Development in Chicago\nNeighborhoods\u00adCommunity Survey; MCIC-MS \u00bc Metropolitan Chicago\nInformation Center\u00adMetro Survey.\nCollective efficacy is operationalized through combining the\nPHDCN-CS measures of social cohesion and informal social\ncontrol. Social cohesion was constructed from a cluster of\nconceptually related items measuring the respondent's level of\nagreement (on a 5-point scale) with the following statements: (a)\n``People around here are willing to help their neighbors.'' (b)\n``This is a close-knit neighborhood.'' (c) ``People in this\nneighborhood can be trusted.'' (d) ``People in this neighborhood\ngenerally don't get along with each other'' (reverse coded).\nHealth-related informal social control was tapped through\nrespondent agreement with the following: (a) ``If I were sick, I\ncould count on my neighbors to shop for groceries for me.'' (b)\n``You can count on adults in this neighborhood to watch out that\nchildren are safe and don't get in trouble.'' An additional\ninformal social control item asked respondents how likely it was\nthat people in their neighborhood would intervene if a fight\nbroke out in front of their house. The informal social control\nitems tap expectations for action with respect to health-related\nsocial support as well as neighborhood supervision of\npotentially hazardous conditions or violent situations. The\nseven items were combined to form a single scale of health-\nrelated collective efficacy. The reliability of the collective\nefficacy scale is .73.\n1999 waves of the MCIC-MS. Self-rated health and relevant\nhealth background controls were simultaneously assessed in\nthese three waves of the MCIC-MS only. We chose to pool these\n3 years to increase our ability to examine differences in self-\nrated health; we include a variable for interview year to capture\nany time trends in this dependent variable. Table 2 reports\ndescriptive statistics on the outcome, self-rated health, and key\ndemographic background and health-related items. These\ninclude measures of gender, age, race/ethnicity (Black, Latino\nversus White/other), income, education level, and marital status\n(married versus single or cohabiting). Health background\nmeasures include insurance coverage (Medicaid, Medicare, or\nprivate insurance versus no insurance coverage) and indicator\nvariables measuring health-risk behavior (exercise, physician-\nindicated weight problem). In all, the combination of these three\ndatasets provides a uniquely rich source of individual and\nneighborhood-level predictors of health.\nAnalytic Strategy\nThe clustering of respondents within Chicago's neighbor-\nhoods renders standard ordinary least squares (OLS) techniques\ninappropriate owing to the likely underestimation of standard\nerrors. We use generalized linear latent and mixed models\n(GLLAMM; Skrondal & Rabe-Hesketh, 2004) to estimate two-\nlevel ordinal logit models. GLLAMM uses adaptive quadrature\nto perform maximum likelihood estimation of multilevel\nmodels. It adjusts standard errors for the effects of the clustering\nof cases within neighborhoods. Our sample of neighborhoods\ncontained, on average, 2.6 respondents. Although the within-\nneighborhood n is small, this does not pose an estimation\nproblem in the case of random intercept (as opposed to random\nslope) models (Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002). Hierarchical tech-\nniques are used not only in our overall analysis but also in the\nconstruction of selected covariates. For instance, to correct in-\ndependent neighborhood-level measures of collective efficacy\nfor missing data, we use empirical Bayes residuals from a three-\nlevel item-response model of the component items of the\ncollective efficacy scale.\nIn baseline models, we examine the association between\ndemographic and background characteristics and self-rated\nhealth. These individual-level characteristics are considered\nexogenous in the models and partially determinative of\nneighborhood of residence. We then enter structural (e.g.,\npoverty, affluence) and social process (e.g., collective efficacy)\nmeasures. The analyses reported are two-level hierarchical\nordinal logit models of self-rated health with positive coef-\nficients associated with poorer self-rated health.\nRESULTS\nOur results consist of descriptive statistics, stratified by\nrace, for our individual-level variables (Table 2), a correlation\nTable 2. Descriptive Statistics for Individual-Level Variables\nAll\nBlack\nWhite\nSelf-rated health\nDemographic background\nRace\nIncome\nEducation\nHealth background\nInsurance\nNote: For the table, N \u00bc 636. Statistics are taken from the Metropolitan\nmatrix for our neighborhood-level variables (Table 3), and\na series of hierarchical ordinal logit models predicting self-\nrated health (Table 4). We include a predicted probability plot\nto illustrate the interaction term included in the last model of\nTable 4 (Figure 2). These models introduce demographic and\nindividual-level SES, health, and neighborhood-level variables\nsequentially. With this approach, we illustrate how each\ndimension contributes to our outcome, self-rated health, and\nhow these dimensions alter the racial disparity observed.\nThe descriptive statistics in Table 2 include our de-\nmographic indicators, individual-level SES measures, and\nour health variables. Included are results for the entire sample\nand for the Black and White samples separately. Black\nrespondents report fair/poor health at a much higher rate (.45\nvs .27). The income distributions differ for Blacks and\nWhites, with far fewer Black respondents falling into the\nhigher-income levels. A similar phenomenon is true for\neducation: Approximately 25% of the White respondents hold\na college diploma or higher as compared with 13% of Black\nrespondents. In terms of health, African American respondents\nare much more likely to have a weight problem and to have\nasthma and high blood pressure. They also are more likely to\nbe Medicaid recipients, a result reflective of both economic\nstatus and, potentially, access to quality health care.\nThe correlations presented in Table 3 show the extent to\nwhich the neighborhood-level variables in our analyses are\ninterrelated. As anticipated, poverty and affluence have a high\nnegative correlation. Affluence and collective efficacy are the\ntwo variables with the highest positive association (r \u00bc .54),\nsuggesting that affluence might aid the ability of neighbors\nto know one another and their social context. Age structure\n(population aged 55 and over) is associated with poverty (r \u00bc\n\u00c0.49), affluence (r \u00bc .40), and collective efficacy (r \u00bc .37),\nperhaps signaling that older persons have accrued more\nwealth and are more connected to/knowledgeable about the\nneighborhood. Overall, the correlations illustrate that these\nvariables are tapping relatively unique components of the\nneighborhood social context.\nTable 4 reports the results of hierarchical ordinal logit\nmodels predicting self-rated health. Model 1 shows the\ncoefficients of a model predicting poorer self-rated health\nbased on demographic background and individual-level SES.\nBlack race is associated with lower self-rated health. African\nAmerican older persons are 77% more likely to report fair or\npoor health than their White counterparts (p , .001), after\nadjusting for age, interview year, Latino ethnicity, gender,\nmarital status, education, and income (note that age was\nassociated with lower self-rated health in the bivariate case but\nis no longer significant in the full individual-level model).\nConsistent with expectations and previous research, education\nand income are protective against poor health, with the greatest\nimpact coming from additional years of schooling (each level\nreduces the likelihood of poorer health by approximately\nTable 3. Correlations Among Neighborhood-Level Variables\nTable 4. Hierarchical Ordinal Logit Model of Self-Rated Health on Individual and Neighborhood Characteristics\nIndependent Variables Model 1 Model 2 Model 3 Model 4 Model 5 Model 6\nIndividual demographic background\nIndividual health background\nNeighborhood-level factors\nNotes: For the Table, neighborhood level N\u00bc246; individual level N\u00bc636. The dependent variable is self-rated health (1 \u00bcexcellent, 2\u00bcgood, 3\u00bcfair, 4\u00bcpoor).\nStandard errors are presented parenthetically.\naFrom the baseline model (Model 1).\nModel 2 adds health background measures. Controlling for\nthese indicators results in modest reductions in the coefficient\nfor Black race as compared with Model 1: African Americans\nare now 65% more likely to report fair/poor health as compared\nwith Whites (p , .01). Older persons who have a physician-\ndiagnosed weight problem are 2.3 times more likely to report\na poorer state of health (p , .001).\nModel 3 adds neighborhood structural characteristics to this\nset of nested models: age structure (percentage of the population\naged 55 or older), residential stability, and poverty. While\nnone of these three variables is significant under this model\nspecification, the coefficient for Black race decreased about\nModel 4 substitutes percentage affluent for percentage\nimpoverished but otherwise maintains the same model specifi-\ncation. Affluence, unlike poverty, significantly reduces the\nlikelihood of reporting poorer self-rated health; a 1-unit increase\nin the percentage of neighborhood households with incomes\nlikelihood of reporting poorer health. In addition, residential\nstability has emerged as a significant predictor of self-rated\nhealth. A standard deviation increase in the residential stability\nscale (SD \u00bc 1.03) leads to a 24% increase in the likelihood of\nreporting poorer health. Important to this analysis, the race\ncoefficient was rendered insignificant (percentage change\napproximately 60% as compared with 22% in Model 3).\nModel 5 includes these neighborhood-level variables but now\nadds collective efficacy. Collective efficacy is not significant in\nthis model specification (nor does the effect of collective\nefficacy vary with time [additional analyses available from the\nfirst author upon request]). This finding is inconsistent with the\nexpected beneficial effect on health based on collective efficacy\ntheory. Residential stability maintains its importance, with its\neffect increasing slightly. Affluence is again protective against\npoorer self-rated health. Race, as in the prior model, is no longer\na significant predictor of health status.\nModel 6 introduces an interaction between affluence and\nresidential stability, acknowledging that the effect of residen-\ntial stability may vary by the level of affluence in\na community. The interaction term is significant (p , .10)\nand indicates that as affluence increases, the magnitude of the\ndetrimental effect of residential stability on self-rated health\ndecreases.\nFigure 2 illustrates this relationship graphically. It shows\nthe predicted probability of fair or poor health by residential\nstability and two levels of neighborhood affluence (the 25th\nand 75th percentiles). We observe that affluence is protective\nof health, regardless of stability. When affluence is low, the\neffect of residential stability is negatively related to health.\nThe coefficient for race does not change appreciably.\nA possible threat to the conclusion that neighborhood\naffluence exerts a unique effect on health status relates to the\npotential reliability mismatch between neighborhood and\nindividual-level measures of income. Arguably, neighborhood\naffluence could be tappingindividual income tothe extentthat the\nlatter is measured with error (a notorious flaw of survey-based\nself-reports of income). To address this possibility, we used\nerrors-in-variables regression (Fuller, 1987) to impose various\nlevels of reliability on the individual-level income measure. The\nneighborhood affluence measure remained a significant predictor\nof health status, even when we assumed a conservative level of\nreliability for individual income (.64). These results suggest that\nFigure 2. Predicted probability of fair or poor health by neighborhood residential stability and affluence.\nthe effect of neighborhood affluence is real and not merely a\nfunction of inaccurately measured income at the individual level.\nDISCUSSION\nThe aim of this work was to introduce a neighborhood-level\nanalysis into the literature on race and self-rated health, thereby\ndetermining whether neighborhood-level factors might explain\nwhy older African Americans rate their health more poorly than\nWhites, all else being equal. We knew from previous work that\nindividual-level SES was an important predictor of self-rated\nhealth (Williams & Collins, 1995) and that individual-level SES\nexplained some, but not all, of the race differential in self-rated\nhealth (Mutchler & Burr, 1991). In addition, we knew that\nneighborhood factors such as dilapidated housing, noise, and\ntraffic were associated with older persons poorer ratings of\nhealth (Krause, 1996). What we did not know was whether\nneighborhood-level SES and neighborhood social organization,\nmeasured by residential stability, poverty, affluence, and\ncollective efficacy, had any explanatory power in the relation-\nship between race and health status. Given the salience of\nneighborhood context to the lives of older persons, our\nexpectation was that these neighborhood-level factors would\nexplain, at least in part, the race differential in self-rated health.\nDoes the introduction of neighborhood-level factors close the\ngap between Blacks and Whites? We find some evidence that it\ndoes. Consistent with previous research, we found that older\nurban African Americans have a substantially higher likelihood\nof reporting low levels of health when compared with White\nrespondents. Our analyses were intended to address a number of\nexisting hypotheses offered to account for this consistent health\ndifferential by race. First, we considered SES as manifest in\neducational achievement and current income. Although SES\nwas strongly predictive of current self-reports of health\n(reflected principally in education but also present in income),\nthese factors accounted for only a proportion of the race effect.\nWe then investigated the mediating effects of health back-\nground. The health behavior literature has suggested that\nAfrican Americans are exposed to a higher risk of poor health\ndue to health-compromising behavioral orientations including\npoor diet and lack of exercise. We also considered the\ncontribution of health insurance coverage to the risk of poorer\nhealth. Only a weight problem was associated with lower self-\nreported health, and this did not account for a substantial\nproportion of the race effect. Marital status and insurance\ncoverage--potentially important to self-rated health at younger\nages--do not appear to be predictive in this case (Ferraro &\nKelley-Moore, 2001). In this older cohort, marital status and\ninsurance coverage may not differentiate groups in the same\nmanner or for the same set of reasons (because of widowhood\nand Medicare coverage, respectively). Once again, the unique\nnegative effect of Black race remained significant in this model.\nRelying on collective efficacy theory to motivate our\ninvestigation, we then considered the role of neighborhood\nsocial context in mediating the effect of race on health. Drawing\non collective efficacy theory's emphasis on the availability of\neconomic and social resources at the neighborhood level, we\nexamined the effects of the proportion of residents in both\nimpoverished and affluent households and a latent indicator of\nresidential stability as structural indicators of community SES.\nConsistent with expectations, neighborhood affluence exerted\na strong and substantial effect on health, even after controlling\nfor individual-level SES and health background. Moreover,\nneighborhood affluence further reduced the negative coefficient\nfor Black race and rendered it insignificant. The proportional\nreduction in the race coefficient was nontrivial: Older African\nAmerican residents may benefit substantially from the presence\nof economically advantaged neighbors with the capacity to\nmobilize on behalf of a health-enhancing and health-protective\nenvironment.\nAt odds with theoretical expectations, however, we found that\nresidential stability was positively associated with poorer health.\nAlthough inconsistent with collective efficacy theory, this result\nnevertheless parallels other recent findings that question the\nbeneficial role of residential stability and the social processes\nwith which it may be associated. Sampson and colleagues\n(1997), for instance, found that residential stability was\npositively associated with homicide rates in Chicago commu-\nnities. Prior analyses (Browning & Cagney, 2003) also have\noffered evidence that the negative effect of residential stability\non health holds for younger populations as well. The effect\nof residential stability may reflect processes described by\nWilson (1987), who suggests that, for some communities, sta-\nbility may not produce or reflect social organization but rather\neconomic and social isolation and constrained mobility (Ross,\nFinally, our operationalization of the collective efficacy\nconcept--tapping social cohesion and health-related informal\nsocial control--did not predict self-rated health for older adults.\nPrevious analyses indicate that collective efficacy is protective\nfor a younger adult population (Browning & Cagney, 2002).\nThus, collective efficacy, in its current conceptualization, may\nnot be tapping the precise elements most important to older\npersons. Future work will attempt to validate this measure\nacross age strata.\nThese results must be interpreted in light of study limitations.\nFirst, our sample size may hamper the ability to make\ncomparisons between race groups and limit us in our capacity\nto test interactions among the variables. Second, although self-\nrated health is a robust measure of general health status, it\nwould be beneficial to include other metrics and to compare and\ncontrast these findings with other evaluations of health. Health\nis a multidimensional construct, so additional measures would\nadd credence to these findings. Although our existing data\npreclude this approach, additional health information, particu-\nlarly in longitudinal form, would further elucidate the\nassociation between race and health. Third, our three data\nsources span a 9-year range; in some cases, the evaluations of\nhealth occurred appreciably later than the structural assessments\nof community. Although we are fortunate that our data structure\nis in keeping with the causal sequence indicated by our\ntheoretical model--neighborhood structural measures from the\ncensus first, neighborhood social process measures from the\nPHDCN-CS second, and health measures from the MCIC-MS\nthird--we recognize that neighborhood structure may have\nchanged over time. To investigate this possibility, we explored\ncross-level interactions with time. None of the interactions was\nsignificant, apart from residential stability; in no case did cross-\nlevel interactions alter the effects of our key theoretical\nvariables. Nonetheless, it would be preferable if the range of\nyears was tighter. Fourth, our analysis is limited to Chicago\nneighborhoods and thus cannot be easily generalized to other\nsettings. We do believe, however, that this combination of data\nsources allowed us to gain insight into urban social processes.\nIn this way, our results may be elucidating for other U.S.\nurban centers.\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, is the larger issue of\ncausality and the causal order implied by our theoretical and\nempirical approach. We begin with the premise that a neighbor-\nhood's social context contributes to the health and well-being of\nthe individuals who reside within it. This is a plausible assump-\ntion, and one made by governmental organizations such as the\nU.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, whose\nlandmark program Moving to Opportunity (MTO) is based on\nthe notion that the context in which people reside affects not only\ntheir physical health but also their mental health, their academic\nachievement, and their success in the job market (Orr et al.,\n2003). Decisions to reside in one community over another,\nhowever, are complex; in the absence of initiatives such as the\none described above, individuals may select into a particular\ncommunity based on one or any number of characteristics that\nwe are unable to identify via current data sources or conventional\nresearch mechanisms. For instance, if illness drives neighbor-\nhood location, then it is not the neighborhood itself that leaves an\nimprint on individual health, but rather individuals who collect\nin a neighborhood who confer a summary assessment of poor\nhealth. We are unable to determine when, or why, the individuals\nin our study moved into their current communities. We believe,\nhowever, that our theoretical and empirical approach lends cre-\ndence to the notion that the social and physical environment\nmatters, apart from duration of residence. We included three\ndistinct data sets--the self-rated health measure and the neigh-\nborhood evaluation from two different sources, ameliorating\nconcerns that illness would cause one to evaluate one's environ-\nment negatively--along with a rich set of controls and an\nadvanced statistical approach. We did, to the extent that our data\nwould allow, follow the general approach suggested by Diez\napproached it with data that had some temporal sequence, and\nwe employed a modeling strategy that accounted for shared\nvariance. By no means does our approach ensure that a causal\nprocess is at work, but it employs some of the best contemporary\ntools and strategies to explore it. We also conducted a reliability\nanalysis, uncommon in neighborhood effects research. Our reli-\nability analysis indicated that neighborhood affluence remained\na significant predictor of health status, even when we assumed\na conservative level of reliability for the individual income mea-\nsure, suggesting that the effect of neighborhood affluence is real.\nIncreasingly, evidence in the literature indicates that neigh-\nborhood does influence health, providing additional evidence\nthat an underlying causal process may be at work. For instance,\na recent article by Johnson and Schoeni (2004) uses the Panel\nStudy of Income Dynamics (PSID) to tease apart family from\ncommunity effects (the initial 1968 sample of the PSID was\nclustered, with many PSID families living in the same\nneighborhood--this allowed for a comparison of siblings living\ntogether versus unrelated individuals living nearby). They find\nthat although the childhood neighbor correlations are smaller\nthan those of the siblings, neighborhood relationships remain;\ndisparities in neighborhood background account for between\none third and one fourth of the variation in health status among\nmen in midlife. Evidence from the MTO initiative--to our\nknowledge, the closest contemporary example of an experi-\nmental design in neighborhood location--indicates that neigh-\nborhood context contributes to the health of both children\nand adults (Kling, Liebman, Katz, & Sanbonmatsu, 2004;\nRacial differences in self-rated health, along with research\nthat investigates the antecedent conditions that might inform\nit (e.g., access to care, differential procedure rates) (Ayanian,\nCleary, Weissman, & Epstein, 1999; Petersen, Wright, Peterson,\n& Daley, 2002), have occupied considerable attention in recent\nyears. Discrepancies in individual-level factors such as\neducation and income have indeed helped to explain a pro-\nportion of the differential; evidence suggests, however, that\nthese alone do not fully account for the persistent disparities in\nhealth between Whites and African Americans. Our findings\ncontribute to research on race and health by highlighting the\nimportance of the presence of neighborhood resources--\nspecifically, the proportion of residents with relatively high\nincomes--in accounting for the residual racial difference in\nhealth between African Americans and Whites. Our analyses\ndemonstrate the specific importance of affluent residents in\ncontributing to the health of older residents, as distinct from the\nhypothesized opposite effect of the presence of poor residents.\nIn exploring this relationship for older persons in particular, we\nacknowledge that the neighborhood effect is likely cumulative.\nFuture research efforts will be aimed at further unpacking the\nrole of neighborhood context in the lives of older residents,\nincluding explorations of other health status measures (partic-\nularly physical function and activities of daily living limita-\ntions), additional community context variables, and analyses\nthat examine the extent to which these variables differentially\ncontribute to health and well-being across the life course.\n"
