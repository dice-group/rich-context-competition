Despite\nthese changes in maternal labor force participation in recent decades, surprisingly few\nstudies have investigated participation using longitudinal data. This is an important\noversight as studying the continuity, intensity, and type of participation mothers engage\nin over time is key to understanding how and whether maternal labor force participation\nis linked with family wellbeing. In this descriptive report we describe maternal labor\nforce participation (employment, unemployment, out of labor force), intensity (part- vs.\nfull-time) and type (nonstandard, multiple job-holding), in the first nine years after\ngiving birth.\nA second aim of this paper is to describe variation in maternal labor force\nparticipation in the years after a birth by maternal education. We do this for a few\nreasons. Changes in U.S. social policies in the late 1990s led to a greater increase in\nmaternal employment among the least advantaged groups (Coley et al. 2007). Research\nhas also documented the phenomenon of \"diverging destinies\", whereby the families in\nwhich children are being raised are increasingly diverging in terms of key inputs such\nas time, quality, and money for child health and development by maternal education\n(McLanahan 2004) and, more generally, there are huge disparities in economic\nresources that children receive by parents' education levels (Putnam 2015). To shed\nlight on these potential disparities, we study whether the levels, timing, and intensity of\nmaternal labor force participation over time vary by maternal education.\nA handful of studies have examined women's labor force participation\nlongitudinally and have found that women make numerous entries into and exits from\nthe labor force (or employment) over the life course (Hynes and Clarkberg 2005; Moen\n1985; Vandenheuvel 1997). These entries and exits have important implications for\nDemographic Research: Volume 34, Article 14\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 409\nthinking about long-term earnings potential, overall economic wellbeing, and ultimately\nthe wellbeing of families. The current study builds on these earlier studies by examining\nmaternal labor force participation in a contemporary cohort of mothers \u00ad those who had\nchildren between 1998 and 2000, shortly after major welfare reforms in the U.S. and\njust after maternal labor force participation rates leveled out.\n2. Data and methods\nWe use longitudinal data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study\n(FFCWS; N~3000), a representative study of births to mothers in large US cities (with\nrecent maternal labor force participation patterns as the data were collected at the time\nthey represent the mother's employment patterns during the first decade of that child's\nlife. The FFCWS included approximately 5,000 births, drawing a random sample from\n75 hospitals in 20 large US cities. The study oversampled non-marital births (at a ratio\nof 3 non-marital to 1 marital birth), resulting in a racially diverse, somewhat\neconomically disadvantaged sample; however, the sample was designed so that when\nthe data are weighted they are representative of mothers who gave birth in the late\n1990s in large U.S. cities. The weights also adjust for non-response and attrition.\nBecause we are looking at patterns over time we restrict our sample to include mothers\nwho are in all survey waves, N=2,986 (the substantive findings are very similar when\nthe analyses are not restricted to mothers who are in all survey waves; analyses\navailable upon request).\nbecause the Great Recession began in the U.S. in December 2007 and ended in June\n2009 (as defined by the National Bureau of Economic Research). As a result, many of\nthe mothers of the 9-year-olds surveyed were interviewed during the Great Recession,\nwhich may have affected their labor force participation. Thus, although the results\nreflect a contemporary birth cohort, they may not reflect typical circumstances faced by\nurban mothers with 9-year-old children.\nPilkauskas, Waldfogel & Brooks-Gunn: Maternal labor force participation in an urban birth cohort\n410 http://www.demographic-research.org\nOur key variable of interest is maternal labor force participation and we construct\nmeasures at each survey wave. We examine two variables, labor force participation and\nemployment. Following the Bureau of Labor Statistics, mothers are considered to be in\nthe labor force if they report that they are currently employed or if they are looking for\nwork (unemployed), otherwise mothers are considered out of the labor force. Mothers\nare asked \"Last week, did you do any regular work for pay?\" and if they report working\nor being on vacation they are considered employed. Mothers who are not working are\nasked if they are looking for work, and, if they are, they are considered unemployed. To\ninvestigate the intensity of labor force participation, we separate mothers who are\nemployed full-time (defined as working 30 hours or more per week) from those\nemployed part-time (less than 30 hours a week).\nWe also study maternal non-standard work hours and multiple job-holding. We\nconstruct a measure of any non-standard work if mothers report working evenings,\nnights, weekends, or shifting schedules (following Dunifon et al. 2013). Multiple job-\nholding is coded as 1 if mothers report working more than one job at the same time.\nIn all our analyses we investigate differences in maternal labor force participation\nby mother's education, which is coded as less than high school, high school, some\ncollege, and college or higher. Twenty-four percent of mothers in our sample have less\nthan a high school education, 32% have a high school degree, 21% some college, and\n24% a college degree or greater.\nWe include a number of demographic characteristics that have been linked in prior\nresearch with maternal labor force participation as control measures in our analyses.\nSpecifically, we include race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black,\nHispanic, other race/ethnicity), maternal age at the birth, whether she was foreign-born,\nand time-varying measures of relationship status (married, cohabiting, single) and the\nnumber of children in the household (to account for birth order and subsequent births).\nTable 1 documents the demographic make-up of the sample by maternal education.\nDemographic Research: Volume 34, Article 14\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 411\nTable 1: Sample characteristics by maternal education (%)\nEducation All\n< High\nSchool High School\nSome\nCollege/\nAssoc.

The sample is restricted to mothers who were interviewed in all survey waves.\nMultivariate models, controlling for the demographic characteristics specified above,\nare run and used to predict labor force participation rates by education level at each\nsurvey wave. All analyses are weighted using national weights, which adjust for\nattrition and sample design (to account for the oversample of non-marital births) and to\nprovide estimates that are representative of mothers in large US cities. Our goal is to\ndescribe variation in the patterns of mothers' labor force participation post-birth as a\nfunction of several key characteristics associated with maternal employment. By\ncontrolling for a number of demographic factors that might be confounded with\nmaternal education we can observe how labor force participation patterns vary by\neducation, net of a number of key demographic characteristics, to better ensure that the\nvariation we observe is largely driven by education as opposed to, say, the birth of a\nnew child or race/ethnic differences in education and employment.\nPilkauskas, Waldfogel & Brooks-Gunn: Maternal labor force participation in an urban birth cohort\n412 http://www.demographic-research.org\n3. Results\n3.1 Patterns of labor force participation\nFigure 1 plots predicted labor force participation among urban mothers after the birth of\na child by the child's age and by maternal education level, controlling for maternal\ncharacteristics (race/ethnicity, age, nativity, relationship status, and number of children\nin the household). Looking across the four panels, we see that labor force participation\nrates vary greatly by maternal education. Participation rates are highest for mothers\nwith some college education, followed by college-educated mothers, then high-school-\neducated mothers, and finally mothers with less than a high school degree, who have\nthe lowest participation rates. Although on average labor force participation increases\nover time, the timing of the increase and even the overall trend varies by maternal\neducation.\nFigure 1: Labor force participation by child's age and by maternal education\nNote: PT= Part-time, FT= Full-time. All figures are predicted percentages, adjusted by the number of children in the household,\nmaternal relationship status, maternal age, maternal race/ethnicity, and immigrant status. All analyses are weighted using\nnational weights. The sample is restricted to mothers who were interviewed in all survey waves, N=2986.\nStarting with mothers with less than high school (Panel A), a sharp increase in full-\ntime employment occurs from age 1 to 3, accompanied by a sharp decline in part-time\nemployment (and level rates of labor force participation and unemployment). Full-time\nDemographic Research: Volume 34, Article 14\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 413\nemployment continues to increase through age 5. At age 9, possibly as a result of the\nGreat Recession, mothers with less than high school are more likely to be employed\npart-time, and less likely to be working full-time, whereas unemployment remains high\nand relatively level over the whole time period for this group (about 25%).\nFor mothers with a high school education (Panel B), the pattern is quite different.\nMothers' overall participation in the labor force increases over time, but unlike mothers\nwith less than high school, full-time employment in this group increases from ages 1 to\n3 to 5, and remains steady through age 9, but part-time employment, which remains\nsteady from ages 1 to 5, also increases at age 9 (possibly due to the Great Recession, if\nmore mothers would have otherwise chosen full-time employment). Unemployment\ndeclines sharply from ages 1 to 3 and then remains steady at 15% for high-school-\neducated mothers (11 percentage points lower than that of mothers with less than high\nschool). Thus, over time, mothers with a high school degree are more likely to enter the\nlabor force, and, among those in the labor force, more are employed.\nPanel C documents the trends in labor force participation for mothers with some\ncollege education and Panel D shows the trends for college-educated mothers. At first\nglance, the patterns for mothers with some college and college education are relatively\nsimilar. Both sets of mothers experience a bump up in full-time employment from ages\n1 to 3 and then a decline from ages 3 to 5 that remains level through age 9. Rates of\nunemployment are generally declining for both groups over time. College-educated\nmothers experience a large decrease in unemployment from 3 to 5; however, much of\nthis decline occurs because college-educated mothers are moving out of the labor force\n(an increase of 13 percentage points), whereas far fewer mothers with some college exit\nthe labor force (an increase of 4 percentage points). Patterns in part-time employment\nalso vary across the two groups. Fifteen percent of mothers with some college work\npart-time at each year, whereas for college-educated mothers, levels of part-time work\nare lower and there is a decline in part-time work from ages 1 to 3 and an increase at\nage 9 (possibly due to the Great Recession).\n3.2 Non-standard employment and multiple-job holding\nIn Figure 2 we document the predicted percentage of mothers working any non-\nstandard hours by child's age and mother's education among mothers who are\nemployed. We see that over time there is a general decline in the percentage of mothers\nwho are working non-standard work hours, but that the decline is steepest for college-\neducated mothers: whereas 60% of employed college-educated mothers work some\nnon-standard hours at age 1, by age 9 only 21% do likewise. In comparison, for all\nother groups there is a decline from ages 1 to 3 but then a relative leveling off, and for\nPilkauskas, Waldfogel & Brooks-Gunn: Maternal labor force participation in an urban birth cohort\n414 http://www.demographic-research.org\nemployed mothers with some college, 56% are working non-standard work schedules at\nage 9, more than twice the percentage of college-educated mothers.\nFigure 2: Non-standard work by child's age and maternal education, among\nemployed mothers\nNote: All figures are predicted percentages, adjusted by the number of children in the household, maternal relationship status,\nmaternal age, maternal race/ethnicity, and immigrant status. All analyses are weighted using national weights. The sample is\nrestricted to mothers who were interviewed in all survey waves, N=2986.\nIn Figure 3 we document predicted multiple-job holding among mothers who are\nemployed. Here we see a general pattern that shows an increase in multiple-job holding\nover time from about age 1 to 5 and then a decline at age 9. These patterns are relatively\nsimilar across education groups, but the levels are quite different. Mothers with some\ncollege education have the highest rates of multiple-job holding, whereas college-\neducated mothers generally have the lowest rates.\n%\nChild's Age\n<High School\nHigh School\nSome Coll./Assoc.\nCollege +\nDemographic Research: Volume 34, Article 14\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 415\nFigure 3: Multiple-job holding by child's age and maternal education, among\nemployed mothers\nNote: All figures are predicted percentages, adjusted by the number of children in the household, maternal relationship status,\nmaternal age, maternal race/ethnicity, and immigrant status.

Conclusion\nUsing recent longitudinal data, this paper examines mothers' labor force participation\nfrom when their child was age 1 through age 9 and is the first to study variation in the\npatterns of participation among mothers over time to examine whether the specific\ntiming of their labor force entry and intensity of employment varied by maternal\neducation. Our study builds on previous studies of maternal labor force participation to\nshow that the timing and intensity of labor force participation varies considerably by\nmaternal education level. Mothers with high school or less education increase their\nlabor force participation gradually over time, moving toward full-time work as their\nchildren age. By comparison, mothers with some college education or more have a\nbump up in participation (and intensity) at age 3, but overall have flatter labor force\nparticipation over time.\nMothers with less than a high school degree have the weakest labor force\nattachment; these mothers have the lowest rates of full-time work, the highest rates of\nbeing out of the labor force, and the highest rates of unemployment, which remain high\n%\nChild's Age\n<High School\nHigh School\nSome Coll./Assoc.\nCollege +\nPilkauskas, Waldfogel & Brooks-Gunn: Maternal labor force participation in an urban birth cohort\n416 http://www.demographic-research.org\nover time; whereas for all other education groups, unemployment declines as children\nage. We also see that at age 9, when the Great Recession hit, mothers with less than\nhigh school have a 10-percentage point decline in full-time work and a small increase in\npart-time work, which does not occur for mothers in the other groups (although there is\nan increase in part-time work for both high school and college-educated mothers,\npossibly due to the Great Recession). This finding is consistent with work that has\nshown that the recession hit less-educated populations hardest (Hoynes, Miller, and\nSchaller 2012), especially those individuals at the very bottom of the income\ndistribution (Sum and Khatiwada 2010), and suggests that disparities in employment by\neducation level persist over time.\nSurprisingly, we found that mothers with some college education had the highest\npredicted rates of labor force participation, even higher than college-educated mothers.\nAdditional analyses, however, indicated that mothers with some college education were\nmore likely to work part-time, work non-standard hours, and hold multiple jobs than\ncollege-educated mothers. Thus, although overall labor force participation and\nemployment rates may be higher than that of college-educated mothers, the quality of\nemployment (nonstandard work, multiple job-holding) is likely lower for mothers with\nsome college.\nThis study has a few limitations. First, as noted earlier, it is likely that the Great\nRecession affects our findings for age 9. Although our descriptive findings do not\nsuggest higher unemployment rates in the age 9 analyses than in earlier waves, it is\nlikely that had there been no recession the unemployment rates would have been lower\nand more mothers would have entered the labor force. Nonetheless, we are describing\nlabor force participation patterns in a recent cohort of mothers \u00ad those that faced the\nGreat Recession. Second, the findings here are limited to mothers in large US cities\nwith young children, and are specific to a cohort of women who gave birth between\n1998 and 2000. Labor force participation rates in the FFCWS study are higher than\nnational estimates when the children are young, but converge with national estimates as\nthe children age. Third, the periodicity of the panel means we are missing periods of\nemployment. Finally, attrition may affect our findings. Although the weights adjust for\nnon-response and attrition, we know that mothers who attrite are more economically\ndisadvantaged and slightly more likely to be unemployed than those who do not leave\nthe sample. Thus, to the extent that the weights do not fully account for attrition, our\nestimates may misstate employment and labor force participation levels over time.\nIn spite of these limitations, our study offers some important lessons. Our findings\nsuggest that simple conceptualizations of labor force participation do not fully capture\nthe dynamics of labor force attachment for mothers in terms of intensity, timing of\nentry, and type of work hours. They also suggest that disparities by maternal education\nin employment and labor force participation persist over time, supporting the concept of\nDemographic Research: Volume 34, Article 14\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 417\n\"diverging destinies\". Future research should consider whether longitudinal patterns of\nmaternal labor force participation affect the wellbeing of families and children, and\nexamine differences by maternal education.\nPilkauskas, Waldfogel & Brooks-Gunn: Maternal labor force participation in an urban birth cohort\n418 http://www.demographic-research.org\nReferences\nBureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor (2014).
