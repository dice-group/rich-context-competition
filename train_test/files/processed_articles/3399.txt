As the diagnosis rate\nfor those with ASD continues to rise along with the practice of including these learners in the general education environment,\nthere is an increasing need to identify evidence-based practices that focus on the acquisition and remediation of social-\ncommunication skills, social skills, and social competence. A variety of strategies have been developed and implemented to\nremediate deficits in these areas. The use of CAI is an approach that has been proven to accommodate both the needs and\nthe visual learning styles of these learners.\n",

The\nmost recent diagnosis rate has indicated that 1 in 50 chil-\ndren are affected by autism with the occurrence in boys\nbeing 5 times greater than girls (Blumberg et al., 2013).\nAutism is referred to as a spectrum disorder because it\nencompasses multiple similarly related disorders as well as\nthe diagnosis requiring the presence of repetitive patterns\nof behavior or activities (Ryan, Hughes, Katsiyannis,\nMcDaniel, & Sprinkle, 2011). Symptoms range from mild\ncognitive, social, and behavioral deficits to more severe\nsymptoms in which children may suffer from intellectual\ndisabilities and be nonverbal. A variety of treatments and\nstrategies have been developed and implemented to reme-\ndiate the deficits that are associated with autism spectrum\ndisorders (ASD). With the growing prevalence and diagno-\nsis rate of ASD and the current emphasis in education on\ninclusion, Social Stories are increasingly being used as a\nmethod of changing the social understanding and behaviors\nof these children to be socially acceptable (Cihak, Kildare,\nSmith, McMahon, & Quinn-Brown, 2012). The following\nis a discussion of acceptable social skills and social compe-\ntence as well as the use of video modeling (VM) with Social\nStories as an instructional strategy with individuals who\nhave been diagnosed on the autism spectrum.\nSocial Skills Interventions\nIndividuals who have been diagnosed on the autism spec-\ntrum typically have difficulty with social interactions because\nof deficits in the area of social skills and social competence.\nThese skills are critical to the successful integration into\ninclusive environments such as school, the community, and\nat job placements.According to Wheeler, Mayton, and Carter\n(2015), there are five categories of intervention that have\nbeen shown to be effective and that qualify as evidence-\nbased interventions. These categories include but are not\nlimited to (a) social skills training groups, (b) VM, (c) social\nnarratives, (d) self-management, and (e) naturalistic inter-\nvention (Wheeler et al., 2015). Taking into consideration that\nthose diagnosed on the autism spectrum generally demon-\nstrate the ability to process visual stimuli more efficiently\nthan others, it is essential to consider their visual learning\nstrengths when determining which intervention is most\nappropriate. VM accomplishes this effectively by presenting\n1Saint Joseph's University, Philadelphia, PA, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nNanette Edeiken-Cooperman, Saint Joseph's University, 5600 City\nEmail: ncooperm@sju.edu\nThe Use of Computer-Assisted\nInstruction as an Instructional Tool to\nTeach Social Stories to Individuals Who\nHave Been Diagnosed on the Autism\nSpectrum\nNanette Edeiken-Cooperman1\n Keywords\nautism, Social Stories, computer-assisted instruction, video modeling, teacher education, education, social sciences\n2 SAGE Open\na video recording of a person or themselves carrying out the\ntarget behavior, or a visually cued model of instruction.\nVM as an Instructional Tool\nThe use of VM and video self-modeling (VSM) as an instruc-\ntional strategy to improve a learner's communi-cation,\nbehavior, and academic performance in the classroom has\ndemonstrated significant success (Cihak et al., 2012).\nAccording to Sansosti and Powell-Smith (2008), a child\nlearns to memorize and imitate target behaviors when those\nbehaviors are modeled on video and presented in a system-\natic and discrete manner. In addition, VM is appropriate for\nuse in the school or home and has consistently demonstrated\neffectiveness for teaching skills to children with ASD and for\nuse as an intervention approach. This success is attributed to\nthe motivation that is created in the learning environment by\ncomputer-assisted instruction (CAI; Sansosti & Powell-\nSmith, 2008). Therefore, because most children with ASD\nare fascinated with computers and iPads, they are intrinsi-\ncally motivated to learn. Although the research to support the\neffectiveness of CAI is limited, schools are increasingly\nusing assistive technology in the classroom with children\nwho have been diagnosed on the autism spectrum.According\nto King, Thomeczek, Voreis, and Scott (2014), \"the advent of\nthe Apple iPad in 2010, in particular, has contributed to this\nincrease in use of CAI with children with ASD\" (p. 2). They\ngo on to say that the growth in technology is \"outpacing\nresearch, education professionals are implementing use of\niPads and apps without research-based guidance on how to\ndo so effectively and efficiently\" (p. 3).\nThe techniques of VM and VSM can readily be applied to\nthe use of Social Stories to benefit the academic, behavioral,\nand social outcomes of students with ASD. A Social Story\ndescribes a situation, skill, or concept in terms of relevant\nsocial cues, perspectives, and common responses in a spe-\ncifically defined style and format (Gray, 1994). Generally,\nthe Social Story is presented to the student prior to the situa-\ntion occurring to help rehearse the scenario. The goal is to\nshare accurate social information in the format of an indi-\nvidualized short story intended to increase appropriate social\ninteractions of children with ASD. Over the past several\nyears, researchers have demonstrated the success of Social\nStories when used to remediate a wide variety of problem\nbehaviors (Scattone, Tingstrom, & Wilczynski, 2006). It is\nfor these reasons that teachers are now integrating the use of\nVM of Social Stories on iPads into their classrooms in order\nto increase the success rate of those learners who are included\ninto the general education classrooms. This process has led\nto the addition of the development of Social Stories using an\niPad or similar device into the curriculum of pre-service\nteachers.\nThe skill of developing personalized video models is\nessential for pre-service teachers who are currently attending\ncertification programs in either elementary or special\neducation. Research has reported results that personalized\nvideo models are more effective than commercially distrib-\nuted video models (Palechka & MacDonald, 2010) and that\nthere is a \"consistent degree of procedural fidelity and con-\nsistent levels of reinforcement\" with the use of the iPad when\nimplementing instruction in academics or student behavior\nTherefore, our challenge in higher education is to ensure that\nprofessors in pre-service teaching programs have available\nto them iPads to instruct their students how to develop and\nimplement programs in the classroom that target appropriate\nsocial skills for individuals who have been diagnosed on the\nautism spectrum.\nConclusion\nAs the diagnosis rate for those with ASD continues to rise\nalong with the practice of including these learners in the gen-\neral education environment, there is an increasing need to\nidentify evidence-based practices that focus on the acquisi-\ntion and remediation of social-communication skills, social\nskills, and social competence. The use of technology is an\napproach that accommodates the needs and the visual learn-\ning styles of these learners. It has been reported that there are\npotential advantages when using iPads as an intervention\ndelivery system rather than other types of assistive technol-\niPads \"are readily available, relatively inexpensive, and\nappear to be intuitive to operate\" (p. 155). In addition, they\nare less stigmatizing when used as an instructional aid because\nthey are a socially accepted device. The literature confirms\nthat it is essential to evaluate our pre-service programs and\ndetermine within what courses we can include training in the\nuse of assistive technology, more specifically using this tech-\nnology to implement the strategy of Social Stories.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nBlumberg, S.
