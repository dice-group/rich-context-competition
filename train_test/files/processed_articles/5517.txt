Obesity is a risk factor for both cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. p16INK4a is a cell cycle\nregulator and tumour suppressor. Whether it plays a role in adipose tissue formation is unknown. p16INK4a knock-down\nin 3T3/L1 preadipocytes or p16INK4a deficiency in mouse embryonic fibroblasts enhanced adipogenesis, suggesting a role\nfor p16INK4a in adipose tissue formation. p16INK4a-deficient mice developed more epicardial adipose tissue in response\nto the adipogenic peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma agonist rosiglitazone. Additionally, adipose tissue\naround the aorta from p16INK4a-deficient mice displayed enhanced rosiglitazone-induced gene expression of adipogenic\nmarkers and stem cell antigen, a marker of bone marrow-derived precursor cells. Mice transplanted with p16INK4a-\ndeficient bone marrow had more epicardial adipose tissue compared to controls when fed a high-fat diet. In humans,\np16INK4a gene expression was enriched in epicardial adipose tissue compared to other adipose tissue depots. Moreover,\nepicardial adipose tissue from obese humans displayed increased expression of stem cell antigen compared to lean\ncontrols, supporting a bone marrow origin of epicardial adipose tissue. These results show that p16INK4a modulates\nepicardial adipose tissue development, providing a potential mechanistic link between the genetic association of the\nCDKN2A/B locus and cardiovascular disease risk.\n",

More distally,\npericardial adipose tissue (pcAT) is the fat depot outside\nthe visceral pericardium, that is, within the pericardial sac.\nAlthough pvAT is thought to develop from its own precur-\nsors, it shares many similarities between white and brown\nAT (bAT).6 Besides structural support, pvAT is being\nincreasingly appreciated as an active modulator of vascu-\nlar tone and function. Given the close role of pvAT with\nobesity, it may be an important link between the metabolic\nsyndrome and atherosclerosis.6\nDuring adipogenesis, cell cycle regulation contributes\nto adipocyte formation.7 During adipogenesis, precursor\ncells go through 1 or 2 rounds of cells division, a process\ncalled mitotic clonal expansion. However, the potential\nrole of cell cycle mediators does not entirely depend on\nthis clonal mechanism. It has been shown, for example,\nthat CDK4, whose function is controlled by p16INK4a,\ndirectly interacts and activates the master adipogenic regu-\nlator peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma\n(PPAR) besides its role in the cell cycle.8 Currently, it\nis unknown whether CDKN2A/B gene products play a\nrole in adipogenesis. We therefore investigated whether\np16INK4a is involved in adipogenesis and AT formation.\nExperimental procedures\nCell culture\n3T3-L1 cells were cultured in growth medium containing\nDulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen, Paris,\nFrance) and 10% foetal calf serum (GE healthcare, Lille,\nFrance). For differentiation, fully confluent cell monolay-\ners were incubated for 48\nh in medium containing 10%\nHyClone Cosmic Calf Serum (GE Healthcare, Lille,\nFrance), methylisobutylxanthine (0.5\nmM), insulin (5\nM)\nand dexamethasone (1M). Hereafter, adipocytes were cul-\ntured in post-differentiation medium (Dulbecco's modified\nEagle's medium, 10% HyClone Cosmic Calf Serum, 5M\ninsulin). Small interfering RNA (siRNA) experiments were\nperformed overnight in pre-confluent 3T3/L1 cells using\n(ON-TARGET plus SMART pool siRNA)], control\nnon-targeting pool siRNA), Villebon-sur-Yvette, France]\n(ON-TARGET plus SMART pool siRNA)] using\nINTERFERin reagent (Polyplus-transfection) according\nto manufacturer's instructions. Transfection efficiency\nwas measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction\n3T3-L1, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as vehicle.\nMouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were derived from\n13.5-day-old wild-type and p16-/-embryos and plated in six-\ncells/well). Adipocyte differentiation\nwas initiated after 2days of confluence. MEFs were differen-\ntiated with AmnioMAX-C100 medium (Invitrogen, Paris,\nFrance), 7.5% AmnioMAX-C100 supplement (Invitrogen,\nParis, France), 7.5% foetal calf serum, 0.5\nmM 3-isobutyl-\n1-methylxanthine, 1M dexamethasone, 5M insulin. From\ndays 3 to 8, cells were incubated with medium supplemented\nM insulin and 1\nM rosiglitazone. At different time\npoints, cells were lysed and homogenized for RNAisolation,\nor fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with Oil Red\nO. All experiments were performed at least in triplicate.\nFlow cytometry\nphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed in cold 70% ethanol\nfor 30min, and washed twice in PBS by centrifugation at\n850g for 5min. Fixed cells were treated with 5\u00b5g/mL of\nDNase-free RNase A (Sigma, Lesquin, France) and incu-\nbated in 20\u00b5g/mL of propidium iodide (PI, sigma,\nLesquin, France) for 15\nmin at room temperature. DNA\ncontent frequency was acquired using a FACS Canto II\nflow cytometer equipped with the FACS Diva software\n(BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Cell dou-\nblets were excluded from the analysis using doublet dis-\ncrimination gating method: FSC-A/SSC-A gate followed\nby a PI-A/PI-W gate. Cell cycle distribution was analysed\nusing FACSDiva6.0 (Tree Star, Inc., Ashland, OR, USA).\nMice\nground were kindly provided by P. Krimpenfort\n(Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam). Female mice\nwere treated with rosiglitazone (15\nmg/kg) for 5\nweeks.\nFor bone marrow transplantation, 8-week-old female\nldlr-/- mice were lethally irradiated (8 Gy) and tail vein\ninjected the next day with 107 bone marrow cells isolated\nfrom 8-week-old p16-/- or littermate control (p16+/+) donor\nmice. Mice received autoclaved acidified water (pH\n=\nsupplemented with neomycin (100\nSigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and polymyxin B\nweek before and 4\nweeks after transplantation.\nMice were studied 6\nweeks post-transplantation allowing\ncomplete repopulation by the donor bone marrow. To\nensure that donor bone marrow efficiently replaced the\nresident blood cell population, DNA was extracted\nfrom whole blood with an Illustra blood kit (GE Health-\ncare, Lille, France). PCR was performed with the forward\n5-GCA-GTG-TTG-CAG-TTT-GAA-CCC-3 and reverse\nyielding products of different lengths depending on the\ngenotype, separated on a 1.5% agarose gel and quantified\nwith the Gel Doc XR system (Bio-Rad, Marnes-la-\nCoquette, France). Over 95% of host blood cells were\nfrom donor origin. All protocols were conducted with the\napproval of the ethical review boards of the Pasteur\nRNA extraction and analysis\nTotal RNA was obtained from tissues using the guanidini-\numthiocyanate (GSCN)/phenol/chloroform extraction\nmethod and from cells using EXTRACT-ALL (Thermo\nFisher Scientific, Villebon-sur-Yvette, France), DNase-I\ntreated and complementary DNA (cDNA) was generated\nusing cDNAreverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems,\nVillebon-sur-Yvette, France). Real-time qPCR detection\nwas conducted on a Stratagene Mx3005P (Agilent tech-\nnologies) using Brilliant II SYBR Green reagent (Agilent\nTechnologies, Les Ulis, France) and specific primers.\nMessenger RNA (mRNA) levels were normalized to cyclo-\nphilin mRNA and fold induction was calculated using the\ndelta CT method.

Inhibiting CDK4 activity with\nously knocking down PPAR with siRNA blunted the\neffects of p16INK4a knock-down (Figure 1(b) and (c)).\nGiven the key role of PPAR in adipogenesis,7 we tested\nwhether p16INK4a deficiency affects adipogenic differentia-\ntion of MEFs. Indeed, primary p16-/- MEFs displayed\nincreased adipogenesis upon PPAR activation compared\nto MEFs from p16+/+ littermates, evidenced by enhanced\nexpression of PPAR (Figure 2(a)), c/ebp (Figure 2(b)),\nadiponectin (Figure 2(c)) and perilipin (Figure 2(d)) at\nseveral time points of adipogenic differentiation. These\ndata demonstrate that p16INK4a deficiency increases adipo-\ngenesis via a CDK4-PPAR-dependent pathway.\nTo assess a role of p16INK4a in AT formation in vivo, we\nanalysed AT depots from p16+/+ and p16-/- mice. Neither\nscAT, gonadal AT [ovarian AT (oAT) or ecAT] nor bAT\nweight was different between the genotypes in either male\nor female mice (Supplemental Figure 2Aand B). Moreover,\nthe weight of scAT and ecAT from p16+/+ and p16-/- mice\ndid not change upon feeding a high-fat diet (data not\nshown), suggesting that p16 deficiency has no major\nimpact on adipogenesis in vivo under these conditions.\nSince our results show that the effect of p16INK4a deficiency\non adipogenesis in vitro depends on PPAR, we assessed\nthe effect of rosiglitazone on AT depots from p16+/+ and\np16-/- mice. Rosiglitazone treatment induced bAT forma-\ntion equally in p16+/+ and p16-/- mice, while oAT or scAT\nwere unaffected (Supplemental Figure 2C). Since recent\nstudies show that AT surrounding the murine heart is\ninduced by PPAR activation,9 perivascular AT was ana-\nlysed. Rosiglitazone induced the appearance of adipocytes\nat the aortic valve area, that is, aortic pvAT which anatomi-\ncally corresponds to human ecAT located between the\nmyocardium and visceral pericardium (Figure 3(a) and\n(b)). Interestingly, pvAT surface was significantly larger in\np16-/- mice than in wild-type littermates (Figure 3(a) and\n(b)). Since these murineAT depots were too small to obtain\nenough mRNA for reliable qPCR analysis, mRNA was\nmeasured in thoracic aortas with their surrounding pvAT.\nRosiglitazone-treated p16-/- mice expressed higher levels\nof adipogenic genes such as PPAR (Figure 3(c)) and per-\nilipin (Figure 3(d)), in pvAT from thoracic aortas com-\npared to littermate controls. Expression of the macrophage\nmarker F4/80 was unaltered (Figure 3(e)), indicating that\np16INK4a deficiency does not influence pvAT macrophage\ncontent. Mesenchymal stem cell precursors especially\nreside in the perivascular region.10 Moreover, rosiglitazone\nhas been shown to contribute to murine peripheral adipo-\ngenesis by promoting recruitment of SCA-1-positive bone\nmarrow-derived progenitor cells,11 prompting us to meas-\nure SCA-1 expression. Interestingly, while SCA-1 expres-\nsion was unaffected by rosiglitazone treatment in other\nTable 2.

Therefore, we next investigated the contribu-\ntion of bone marrow p16INK4a deficiency on pvAT develop-\nment. The mice were fed a western-type diet as a\nphysiologically relevant stimulus of pvAT development.\nBone marrow-restricted p16INK4a deficiency resulted in\nenhanced formation of aortic pvAT (Figure 4(a) and (b)).\nMice transplanted with p16INK4a-deficient bone marrow\ndisplayed slightly lower body weight gain compared with\ncontrols. However, this difference did not reach statistical\nsignificance (Supplemental Figure 4A). In addition, oAT\nwas lower in mice transplanted with p16INK4a-deficient\nbone marrow (Supplemental Figure 4B), arguing that\nincreased adipogenesis is restricted to the aortic region in\nthese animals. Thus, our results show that p16INK4a defi-\nciency in bone marrow cells enhances western diet-induced\npvAT formation in mice.\nFinally, we investigated gene expression of p16INK4a in\nscAT, vAT, pcAT and ecAT isolated from human subjects.\nCompared to the other AT depots, p16INK4a expression is\nespecially high in ecAT (Figure 5(a)), explaining why\necAT is more sensitive to modulation by p16INK4a than\nother ATs. Although SCA-1 has no human ortholog, the\nneighbouring SCA-2 gene is conserved in humans and\nmay have similar functions.12 Interestingly, SCA-2\nexpression is higher in ecAT from obese patients com-\npared to lean controls (Figure 5(b)), while its expression\nis not influenced by obesity in other AT depots (Figure\n5(c) to (e)).\nDiscussion\nAlthough the link between CDKN2A and CVD and T2D\npathways this locus influences CVD. Our results show that\np16INK4a plays a role in mitotic clonal expansion-mediated\nadipogenesis and in the development of murine pvAT\nclose to the heart.\nWe show for the first time a functional role for p16INK4a\nin adipocyte differentiation, likely due to an enhancement\nof mitotic clonal expansion, crucial for adipogenesis of\nmurine cells.13 Although the employed siRNA targeting\ndata show that the effects of CDKN2A knock-down\ndepend on CDK4 activity, which is controlled by p16INK4a\nbut not p19ARF.14 Moreover, similar results were obtained\nusing primary MEFs from mice specifically lacking\np16INK4a. CDK4 was shown to promote adipogenesis\nthrough PPAR activation.8 In line, our data show that the\neffects of CDKN2A knock-down depend on PPAR. In\naddition, CDK4 was recently shown to potentiate insulin\nsignalling in adipocytes, thereby inhibiting lipolysis and\nenhancing lipogenesis.15 Therefore, we cannot exclude\nthat metabolic changes are at least partially involved in\nthe enhanced adipogenesis after p16INK4a knock-down.\nIn vivo, p16INK4a deficiency did not affect rosiglitazone-\ninduced adipogenesis in bAT, vAT or scAT. Interestingly,\np16INK4a deficiency increased the formation of pvAT sur-\nrounding the aortic root. In addition, by performing bone\nmarrow transplantation, we found increased pvAT forma-\ntion in mice transplanted with p16INK4a-deficient bone\nmarrow fed a high-fat high-cholesterol diet. We did not\nobserve increased body weight or oAT, suggesting that the\neffects of p16INK4a deficiency are specific for pvAT forma-\ntion. The origin of adipocyte precursor cells currently\nremains subject of debate and conflicting data exist\nwhether or not adipocyte progenitors derive from hemat-\nopoietic cells.16 In support of a bone marrow origin of at\nleast some adipocytes, is the fact that adipogenesis in\nwhite AT depots occurs in close proximity to the vascula-\nture without sharing a common progenitor with vascular\ncells.16 To our knowledge, the potential hematopoietic ori-\ngin of pvAT has not yet been investigated. Although our\nstudy was not designed to univocally identify a bone mar-\nrow origin of pvAT, our results suggest that increased adi-\npogenesis caused by p16INK4a deficiency in bone marrow\ncells contributes to aortic pvAT formation.\nFigure 2.p16INK4a-deficient MEFs display enhanced\nadipogenesis: mRNA expression of PPAR (a), C/EBP (b),\nadiponectin (c), and perilipin (d) was measured in p16+/+\n(white bars) and p16-/- (black bars) MEFs by qPCR before\ndifferentiation (d0), and after indicated time points (d=days) of\nadipogenic differentiation.\nDifferences were assessed with two-way ANOVA using Bonferroni\nFigure 3.p16INK4a deficiency enhances rosiglitazone-induced pvAT formation in vivo: p16+/+ (n=10) and p16-/- (n=9) littermates\nwere treated with rosiglitazone (15mg/kg) for 5weeks or vehicle and cardiac AT was stained for neutral lipids with Oil Red O (a).\nScale bare represents 500\u00b5m.

Differences were assessed with Student's t-test. **p<0.01.\nIn human ecAT, p16INK4a mRNA is more abundant than\nin other AT depots. This result suggests that ecAT may be,\nmore than other AT depots, sensitive to p16INK4a function or\nregulation. Interestingly, SCA-2 gene expression was higher\nin ecAT isolated from obese compared to lean individuals.\nIn line, murine aortic pvAT from p16-/- mice displayed\nhigher SCA-1 mRNAlevels than wild-type controls. Murine\nSCA-1 is a surface molecule associated with stem cells\nthought to function as a co-signalling molecule with roles in\nhaematopoiesis, bone formation and muscle homeostasis.12\nSCA-1 does not have a clear human ortholog since the\nregion encoding this and five additional related genes has\nbeen deleted through evolution. However, the region flank-\nkb are conserved in humans and it is\npossible that at least some of the important roles of SCA-1\nin murine development are taken over by one or a number of\nhuman-related proteins,12 such as SCA-2. However, it\nremains to be determined whether SCA-2 shares the same\nrole in bone marrow stem cells as SCA-1 in mice.\nThe development of fat covering the human heart and\naorta is thought to contribute to CVD. These fat depots,\nwhich are in direct contact with the epicardium and the\narteries, are a source of free fatty acids, adipokines, and\ninflammatory cytokines.5 ecAT is thus believed to directly\ninteract with cardiomyocytes and the coronary vasculature\nthrough paracrine signalling. Recent epidemiological stud-\nies have linked ecAT volume with CVD, such as atrial\nfibrillation and coronary atherosclerosis.5\nIn conclusion, our results shed light on the potential\nrole of p16INK4a in pvAT development. Given the known\nassociation of pvAT with CVD, our data provide a new\nmechanism to explain one of the most profound GWAS\nassociations for CVD risk.\nAuthor contributions\nK.W., Y.D., S.A.H., J.V., X.M., A.C., M.T., B.D., E.B., C.D.,\nE.V, R.P. performed experiments.
