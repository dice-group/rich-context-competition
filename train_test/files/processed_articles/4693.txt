Pertici and others\nINTRODUCTION\nAn SCI (spinal cord injury) induces axonal degeneration fol-\nlowed by cellular reactions that lead to a glial scar formation\nthat forms a tight barrier and to post-traumatic pseudocyst\ncavities. All of these reactions induce network disorgani-\nzation and mechanically hinder the axonal regeneration of\ninjured CNS (central nervous system) neurons (Berry et al.,\nvolves microglia, meningeal cells, astrocytes and oligoden-\ndrocyte precursors, the majority of which produce molecules\nknown to inhibit the axonal elongation (Fawcett and Asher,\nOne of the methods to limit the glial scar formation is\nto re-form the tissue structure and to promote axonal re-\ngeneration across such CNS by the use of biomaterial-based\nscaffolds to bridge the lesion site. Scaffolds may serve as a\nmatrix for cell growth within the inhibitory region of the\ninjury, may allow the diffusion of various neuroactive sub-\nstances including growth factors and may provide a permis-\nsive environment supporting the regrowth of axons through\nthe lesion site.\nThe use of various biomaterials has been proven to be\neffective in providing a cellular framework for regenerat-\net al., 2005). Most of these biomaterials used in tissue engi-\nneering studies published to date have been based on PGA\n[poly(glycolic)], PLA [poly(lactic acid)] and their copolymers.\nAlthough they have a wide acceptance, these polymers ex-\nhibit some disadvantages: (i) they are not elastomeric, (ii)\nthey are hydrophobic, (iii) they break down into acidic prod-\nucts that are incompatible with cell growth, (iv) the acidic\nbreakdown products autocatalyse further polymer break-\ndown, often leading to catastrophic disintegration of larger\nmasses of polymer, and (v) they are difficult to derivate\nchemically.\nNon-resorbable polymers are suitable implantation ma-\nterials. Acrylate and methacrylate polymers are tolerated\nin vivo. These polymers with hydrophilic substitute groups\ncan form hydrogels that are suitable in medicine and biol-\nogy applications because of their high water content and\nfavourable mechanical properties. Indeed, they are water-\nswollen polymers with a macromolecular three-dimensional\nnetwork that resembles a sponge. Moreover, they are also\nstable, biocompatible, with a viscoelasticity close to living\ntissues, with a porosity allowing neuroactive molecules, nu-\ntriments and metabolites to permeate through the matrix,\nand have the ability to entrap cells that act as a source of\nextracellular matrix (Atzet et al., 2008). Among candidates,\nhydrogels of pHEMA [poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)] are\nknown to present the previously cited characteristics. They\ncan be fabricated in various architectures with mechanical\nproperties that are similar to natural tissue (Homsy, 1970;\ntive materials for axonal regeneration in the CNS because\nmacroporous pHEMA hydogels can be synthesized using a\nvariety of chemistries, resulting in a range of microstruc-\ntures with varying degrees of porosity and pore size in which\ninjured axons should regrow, i.e. they can be used as bridg-\ning structures providing physical as well as trophic support\nfor the regenerative process. Hydrogels based on crosslinked\npHPMA [poly N-(2-hydroxypropyl)-methacrylamide] are also\nknown to have the potential for facilitating tissue regener-\nation in the injured spinal cord (Woerly, 2000; Woerly et al.,\n(Loh et al., 2001). This pHPMA provides a porous environ-\nment into which cells from the intact neural parenchyma can\nmigrate.\nIt is well established that, after a trauma, many differ-\nentiated neurons trans-synaptically degenerate below and\nabove the lesion, but some motoneurons survive and re-\net al., 2008). As a result, spinal segments that are not fully\ninjured remain able to exhibit functional activity medi-\nated by reflex pathways. The Hoffman (H)-reflex, which is\nthe electrical analogue of the monosynaptic stretch reflex,\ncan be used to assess the excitability of motoneuron pools\net al., 2002). More precisely, it provides information on the\nfunctional properties of the Ia afferents and homonymous\n-motoneurons, under physiological and pathological con-\nditions (Pierrot-Deseilligny and Mazevet, 2000). It is a com-\nmonly used clinical tool (Misiaszek, 2003; Yablon and Stokic,\n2004) that yields information about altered properties of\nthe reflex after SCI. The H-reflex is elicited by an electrical\nstimulation of a peripheral nerve that innervates the muscle\nfrom which the reflex is recorded. A single stimulus generates\na short-latency M-wave, resulting from direct stimulation\nof the motor axons, and a long-latency H-wave elicited by\nthe activation of -motoneurons activated by Ia afferents\n(Gozariu et al., 1998). The amplitude of the H-reflex has been\nshown to be proportional to the number of activated mo-\ntoneurons (Magladery and Teasdall, 1958) and the reflex rep-\nresents a good measure of the transmission between muscle\nBurke et al., 1984). In normal subjects, the H-wave ampli-\nand a depression is observed when frequency stimulation\nincreases. However, after SCI, H-reflex increases in ampli-\ntude (Malmsten, 1983) and the decrease in H-wave ampli-\ntude becomes less sensitive to stimulus frequency, resulting\nin a higher H/M ratio compared with corresponding frequen-\ncies in uninjured control (Thompson et al., 1992; Calancie\net al., 1993). Such phenomenon results in a decrease of the\npresynaptic inhibition by local interneurons on Ia afferents\n150 C 2013 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits unrestricted use, distribution\nand reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\npHPMA in repair of transected spinal cord\nfollowing loss of descending projections from the brainstem\nto those interneurons (Delwaide et al., 1973). The elevated\nH-reflex amplitude and H/M ratio at the baseline stimulus\nfrequency are manifestations of hyperexcitability (Delwaide\net al., 1973) and spasticity (Diamantopoulos and Zander\n1984) and are used to correlate reflex pathway properties\nwith functional outcome in animal experiments (Lee et al.,\nIn the present study, outcomes of pHPMA hydrogel were\nalso evaluated during muscle exhaustive exercise. Adjustment\nto exercise is a complex phenomenon that could be briefly\ndescribed as an increase in oxygen and energetic metabo-\nlites supply to working muscle. It is commonly admitted that\nexercise induces an increase in HR (heart rate), MABP (mean\narterial blood pressure) and minute ventilation by two classes\nof neural mechanisms: (i) the central command system which\ninvolves the direct activation of brainstem locomotion, venti-\nlatory and autonomic networks by the cerebral processes oc-\ncurring at the onset of exercise (Krogh and Lindhard, 1913;\nflex network resulting of the activation of a complex system\nof feedback and feed forward through medullar pathways\nand Hayes, 2002). Recently, we demonstrated that this reflex\nis mediated by metabosensitive afferent fibres from groups III\nand IV whose receptors are uncapsulated nerve endings found\nin the connective tissue and in the walls of small vessels\nwithin the muscle respectively (Decherchi et al., 2007). We\nalso showed that metabolites released from a low-frequency\n(10 Hz) electrically stimulated muscle-activated nerve end-\nings that elicited a reflex increase in blood pressure, sym-\npathetic activity and ventilation, in animals whose humoral\ncommunication was abolished. These reflexes are named `Ex-\nercise or Muscle Reflex' (ER or MR) or \"Metaboreflex\". Af-\nferent inputs from exercising skeletal muscle are believed\nto signal the CNS that blood and/or oxygen supply to the\nmetabolically active tissues is not adequate to meet blood\nand/or oxygen demand (Mitchell, 1985; Rowell and O'Leary,\n1990). Consequently, metabolic stimuli provide an error sig-\nnal indicating that blood supply and demand in contracting\nmuscle are not matched properly. After a spinal cord trauma,\nthe metaboreflex originating from skeletal muscle and con-\ntributing significantly to the regulation of the cardiovascular\nand respiratory systems during exercise is altered (Crisafulli\nIn the present study, we have evaluated the effective-\nness of a pHPMA hydrogel as a implant material to bridge\nthe defected spinal cord tissue and to facilitate axonal re-\ngeneration. A great attention was paid to neurophysiological\nchanges that may be related to the development of enhanced\nexcitability of hind limb reflexes after a SCI. Thus, functional\nrecovery was assessed by means of two tools\u00adHoffman (H)-\nreflex and respiratory adjustments during muscle induced\nfatigue. In addition, qualitative morphology of the injury site\nwas assessed by estimating the white matter myelin preserva-\ntion, the number of macrophages/monocytes (ED-1 positive\ncells) at the lesion border and the neurofilament-positive\n(NH-F) axon profiles penetrating the hydrogel.\nAnimals\nAdult male albino Sprague Dawley rats (8 weeks old at the\nstart of the experiment), weighing 300 g (Elevage JANVIER\u00ae,\nCentre d'Elevage Roger JANVIER), were singly housed in\nsmooth-bottomed plastic cages at 22C in a colony room\nmaintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle, with dark onset at\n7.00 PM. Food (Purina\u00ae, rat chow) and water were avail-\nable ad libitum. On arrival, all animals were examined by\na qualified veterinarian. In order to accustom the animals\nto the laboratory environment, an acclimation period of\n3 weeks was allowed before the initiation of the experi-\nment. All animals were weighted before each experimental\nstep.\nEthical approval\nAnaesthesia and surgical procedures were performed ac-\ncording to the French law on animal care guidelines and\nthe Animal Care Committees of University Aix-Marseille\n(Aix-Marseille Universit\u00b4\ne) and CNRS (Centre National de la\nRecherche Scientifique) approved our protocols.

Furthermore, experiments\nwere performed following the recommendations provided in\nthe Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (US De-\npartment of Health and Human Services, National Institutes\nof Health) and in accordance with the European Community's\nical sign of pain or unpleasant sensation (i.e. screech, prostra-\ntion, hyperactivity, anorexia) and no paw-eating behaviour\nwere observed throughout the study.

Pertici and others\nHydrogel preparation\nWater-soluble matrix was provided by Dr Eric Pinet\n(AquaGel Technologies Inc.). Briefly, the macroporous hy-\ndrogels were prepared from HPMA by heterophase sepa-\nration using radical polymerization in a pore-forming sol-\nvent with a divinyl cross-linking agent. The synthesis of the\nhydrogel was pre-\nviously described (Woerly et al., 1998). Following polymer-\nization the gel was extensively washed in water to remove\nunreacted products and then stored in distilled water at 4C.\nPrior to its use the hydrogel was sterilized by exposure to hot\nHydrogel characteristics\npHPMA is a biocompatible synthetic hydrogel that displays no\nsigns of toxicity, chronic inflammation or risks of transmitting\ndisease (Woerly et al., 2001a). This hydrogel is a cross-linked\nhydrophilic macromolecular network that has a water frac-\ntion of 95.66%. Its mechanical properties, matching those of\nthe nervous system, allow it to properly fit the lesion cav-\nity and bridge the spinal cord stumps (Woerly et al., 1998).\nMoreover, this hydrogel presents a multimodal pore size dis-\ntribution from micropores (<2 nm) to macropores (>50 nm;\nnected pores allow free transport of macromolecules, mi-\ngration of cells and angiogenesis (Woerly, 2000). It was also\nobserved that axonal regeneration could cross throughout\nthe hydrogel (Woerly et al., 2004). The large surface/volume\nratio highly encourages tissue formation into the hydrogel\nSurgical protocol\nFor the initial surgery, rats were deeply anaesthetized with an\nintra-peritoneal injection of chloral hydrate (400 mg kg- 1,\nSigma) and additional (0.1 ml) anaesthesia was given ap-\nproximately every 20 min. Atropine (0.2 ml, subcutaneous)\nwas administered to reduce secretions. Surgical procedures\nwere performed aseptically with the aid of dissecting micro-\nscope. Rats were then positioned in ventral decubitus. The\nanimal's back was shaved, disinfected (betadine, 5%) and\na midline incision was made over the C6-T13 spinous pro-\ncesses. Dorsal muscles were cut and maintained on the side\nusing retractors while spinous processes of the vertebra T10\nwere partially removed. Thoracic spinal column was fixed\nwith the help of haemostatic forceps. A hole was made in\nthe T10 vertebra arch using a Friedman micro-rongeur. After\nbone removal, periosteal membrane was opened with a pair\nof sharp tweezers to allow direct visualization of the spinal\ncord. The dura was opened longitudinally along the midline\nand retracted laterally to expose the dorsal surface of the\ncord. Prior to the transection, the spinal cord was rinsed with\ncold saline to favour vasoconstriction. Using a microscalpel,\na left hemicordotomy was performed and 1 mm of spinal tis-\nsue segment was removed with microforceps and ophthalmic\nsponges. Close examination of the cut edges of the cord con-\nfirmed that the surface of the tissue was free of meninges\nor blood clots. The hydrogel implant was sized and adapted\nto the dimension and shape of the hemi-cavity. It was in-\ntroduced into the lesion with a slight downward pressure to\nallow settling of the gel using a microspatula and ophthalmic\nsponges ensuring apposition of the polymer gel with the ros-\ntral, caudal and sagittal surfaces of the spinal tissue. The gel\nwas hydrated with drops of sterile saline solution to ensure\ncomplete apposition of the surfaces between the polymer\nimplant and the cord stumps (which was verified under the\nsurgical microscope under high magnification). The surgi-\ncal site containing the polymer implant was covered with a\nfilm of bioabsorbable artificial dural substitute (Seamdura\u00ae,\nGunze Ltd., Codman, Johnson and Johnson Company) to iso-\nlate the gel implant from the overlying muscle and mes-\nenchymal tissue. Muscle and skin were sutured (Vicryl\u00ae 3-0,\nEthicon France) in anatomical layers. Animals were kept un-\nder heat lamps for 12\u00ad24 h. They were rehydrated with a\nbolus of saline (3 ml, subcutaneous) to replace fluid lost dur-\ning the surgical procedure and received a subcutaneous in-\njection of an antalgic (bupr\u00b4\nthey were kept in individual cages and observed daily during\nthe next 14 weeks. The animals were not placed in an en-\nriched environment. They were preventively treated (in their\ndrinking water) with wide spectrum antibiotic (Oxytetracy-\ncline, 400 mg l- 1, Sigma Aldrich, Saint-Quentin Fallavier)\nduring 1 week. Manual bladder expression was performed\nat least twice daily until bladder reflex was re-established\nBBB test\nThe animals were observed for any spontaneous recovery\nof motor activity and postural function of their hindquar-\nters during overground movement. Behavioural evaluation\nwas performed in an open field, once a week for 14 weeks,\naccording to the BBB scale (Basso et al., 1995). This locomo-\ntor rating scale designed to measure the amount of loco-\nmotor function evaluates the movements of the rats on a\n21-point rating scale, with a score of 21 representing nor-\nmal movement and 0 representing complete paralysis of the\nhindlimb. This test is based on the normal recovery observed\nafter a mild SCI and involves detailed analysis of move-\nment including the motion degree of particular joints of the\nhindlimbs, trunk stability during movement, weight-bearing\ncapabilities and the placement of each paw of the hind\nlimbs.\nRecording protocol\nFourteen weeks post-surgery, rats were re-anaesthetized by\nan intra-peritoneal injection of solution containing ure-\nthane (120 mg kg- 1, Sigma). A tracheotomy was performed.\nA catheter was inserted into the right femoral artery and\npushed up to the fork of the abdominal aorta.

Animals were placed on a stereotaxic\napparatus (Model 902, David Kopf Instrument). The left per-\noneal nerve was dissected free from surrounding tissues on a\nlength of 3-4 cm and tendons were left intact. Animals were\nthen prepared for reflex testing. Urethane does not depress\nspinal cord monosynaptic reflexes and does not alter presy-\nnaptic inhibition. This anaesthetic has been shown to produce\nsimilar negligible effects on H-reflex as ketamine, which is\ncommonly used for H-reflex recordings (Cliffer et al., 1998).\nCore temperature was maintained at 36 +\n- 1C using a heat-\ning pad controlled by a thermostat driven by a rectal probe.\nTo prevent dehydration, subcutaneous injection of 0.5 ml of\nisotonic glucose\u00adsaline, pH balanced to 7.4, were adminis-\ntered at 0.5 h intervals. The animal's forelimbs and hindlimbs\nwere secured with tape while knee and ankle joints were\nfirmly held by clamps on a horizontal support to prevent any\nmovement during nerve (H-reflex testing) or muscle (phys-\niological reflexes testing) stimulation. Hindlimbs were only\nslightly extended away from the trunk, and care was taken\nnot to apply any unnecessary pressure or stretch to any part\nof the limbs.\nM- and H-waves\nA bipolar cuff electrode was placed on the peroneal nerve for\nstimulation (0.1 ms pulses). The cathode (positive electrode)\nwas oriented proximally. A pair of wire electrodes was placed\nsubcutaneously on the Tibialis anterior muscle for EMG (elec-\ntromyographic) recording. Ground electrode was implanted\nin a nearby muscle. Exposed tissue was covered with paraffin\noil to prevent drying. The recorded signal was passed to a\ndifferential amplifier (P2MP\u00ae, 5104B) and bandpass filtered\nat 0.1 Hz and 10 kHz. The analogue signal was then sent to\nan A/D converter and the digital waveform was stored and\ndisplayed (sampled at 20 KHz, filtered with High Pass at 150\nHz) online using data acquisition software (Biopac MP150\u00ae\nand AcqKnowledge\u00ae software). Stimulation of the peroneal\nnerve produced two EMG responses. The earlier response (<\n4 ms latency), the M-wave, was due to direct activation of\nthe motor axons in the peroneal nerve and did not involve\na spinal circuit. The second response (> 4 ms latency), the\nmonosynaptic H-reflex, was due to the activation of muscle\nafferents in the peroneal nerve that synapse on sciatic mo-\ntoneurons. The H-reflex provides a quantitative measure of\nnetwork changes that occur in the spinal cord after injury.\nMore precisely, changes in the H-wave can be correlated to\nthe amount of damaged grey matter (D'Angelo, 1973).\nIn order to elicit the H-reflex, the peroneal nerve was\nstimulated using a Grass\u00ae S88 stimulator (Astro-Med, Inc.)\ndelivering bipolar electrical pulses of 0.1 ms duration. Thresh-\nold and maximal response amplitudes were measured. Stim-\nulus intensity was gradually increased until both M- and H-\nwaves were maximal and stable: in the low stimulus intensity,\nonly M-wave was evoked, whereas the H-wave was observ-\nable at higher intensity. Thus, when the Hmax\nwas reached,\nthe M-wave amplitude was already maximal. The total mo-\ntor unit response was determined by supramaximal stimu-\nlation of the peroneal nerve axons to produce a maximal\nM-wave.\nIn a first step, the influence of supraspinal descending ax-\nons on the sub-lesional sensory-motor circuitry was exam-\nined. The H-reflex rate sensitivity (i.e. the decrease in reflex\nmagnitude relative to repetition rate) was studied (Thompson\ntion rate of 0.3 Hz was used for H-reflexes consistent with\nthe original studies describing rate-sensitive depression as a\ndiminished response produced by successive stimuli falling\nat intervals of<3 s (Eccles and Rall, 1951). Although a small\ndepression was subsequently shown to outlast this period,\n3.0 s provided a practical compromise between recovery and\nefficient performance of the protocols (Lloyd and Wilson,\n1957). The amplitudes of the M- and H-waves as determined\nby the peak-to-peak values of each waveform were used\nto calculate the average Hmax\n/Mmax\nratio. The latencies of\nthe responses were measured as time elapsed between trig-\nger and peak of each waveform. Hmax\n/Mmax\nratio provided\nan index of motoneurons recruited via a monosynaptic re-\nflex relative to the total motoneuron pool (Magladery et al.,\nmagnitude, expressed as a fraction of the M-wave, provided\na standard that could be referenced across animals. There-\nafter, stimulation was performed at frequencies of 1, 5 and\n10 Hz, with a 5-min inter-rate interval. The same stimulus\nintensity previously defined (i.e. the minimum stimulus in-\ntensity required to elicit maximal H-wave) was used across\nthe applied frequencies. Immediately after changing to a new\ntest frequency, the magnitude of the initial two or three re-\nflexes progressively reached a new plateau. To decrease the\nvariability that could be due to this transition, the signal av-\nerage, at each test frequency, was recorded after the initial\nreflexes to exclude responses with the most acute transi-\ntion. Fifteen consecutive waveforms were collected at each\nfrequency and an average of ten responses was stored af-\nter discarding the first five responses in order to obtain an\naverage of the stabilized reflex. The Hmax\n/Mmax\nratio at 1,\n5 and 10 Hz was expressed as a percent of 0.3 Hz baseline\nfrequency ratio in order to calculate the H-reflex rate de-\npression. Following the frequency series testing, the H-reflex\namplitude was confirmed at 0.3 Hz for consistency. If the\namplitude at recheck was less than 90% of the initial am-\nplitude, data were discarded. The M- and H-waves were only\nrecorded on the left side. The investigator was blind to the\nexperimental groups during recording and analysis of\nthe data.\nIn a second step, the reflex excitability was tested us-\ning a modification of the method reported by Skinner et al.\n(1996).

Pertici and others\n10 Hz was normally reduced by the second and subsequent\nstimuli, probably through presynaptic inhibitory mechanisms.\nHowever, in injured animals, the normal inhibition was ab-\nsent, and the H-reflex amplitude remained close to 100% of\nits control value. Single square wave stimuli (0.5 ms, 5-15 V)\nwas used to elicit M-wave and H-reflex and then trains of\nfive stimuli at 10 Hz are delivered at 5x H-reflex threshold.\nAs described by Gozariu et al. (1998) in rats, when increas-\ning the stimulation intensity, the M- and H-waves reached a\nplateau so that at 5x the H-reflex threshold amplitude of M-\nand H-waves were maximal. The amplitude of the M-wave\nwas monitored throughout the recording period to ensure it\nremained constant. H-reflex amplitude of the second, third,\nfourth and fifth responses were measured from the average\nof three trials and Hmax\n/Mmax\nexpressed as a percentage of the first Hmax\n/Mmax\nratio (1st),\nalso averaged over three trials.\nPhysiological reflexes\nChanges in ventilation were recorded after ipsilateral\nT. anterior stimulation to the spinal lesion. The experiments\nwere performed after regional circulatory occlusion, which\nisolated and maintained the neural drive as well as abolish-\ning the humoral communication. In intact animals, repeti-\ntive muscle stimulations induced muscle fatigue responsible\nof the metabosensitive afferent fibre activation and sub-\nsequently a ventilation frequency and amplitude increase\n(Decherchi et al., 2007). In animal with an SCI, such stim-\nulation was ineffective, i.e. the ventilation response was\nabolished. However, the changes in ventilation after mus-\ncle stimulation may reappear after an effective therapeutic\nOne-hour of rest after the last nerve stimulation used\nto evoke M- and H-waves, EIF (electrically induced muscle\nfatigue) were performed. For this purpose, rhythmic muscle\ncontractions were produced by a neurostimulator (Grass\u00ae\nS88, Quincy), which delivered, through an isolation unit, rect-\nangular pulse trains to a pair of steel electrodes placed on the\nmuscle surface (pulse duration: 0.1 ms; frequency: 10 Hz, i.e.\nvoltage range: 5\u00ad8 V). The voltage was supramaximal, i.e.\n20% higher than that used to elicit a maximal twitch. Fa-\ntigue was assessed from the decay of force throughout the\n3-min EIF period. The strength of muscle contraction (the de-\ncay of force) was measured from the beginning to the end of\nthis 3-min muscle electrical stimulation with a gauge strain\nattached to the distal tendon (Microdynamometer S 60; Ugo\nBasile Narco Biosystem). We chose to stimulate directly the\nmuscle because it was previously shown that muscle low\nfrequency stimulation is a strong activator of metabosensi-\ntive afferent fibres (Darques and Jammes, 1997). Ventilatory\nfrequency recorded through the canula inserted into the tra-\nchea was measured 2 min before EIF, during EIF and 5 min\nafter.\nThe recording protocol is summarized in Figure 1.\nMuscular weight\nAt the end of the electrophysiological recordings, animals\nwere sacrificed by a lethal dose of sodium pentobarbital\n(Nembutal, intravenous 120 mg kg- 1).

The functional loss due to\nthe spinal cord hemisection was maintained throughout the\nentire time of the study in both groups. However, contrary to\nthe Lesion group that reached a plateau at the second week\npost-surgery suggesting typical reorganization observed af-\nter an SCI (Gale et al., 1985), the Lesion + Matrix group pre-\nsented a functional improvement until the sixth week. As in\nour study, previous experiments showed that after a spinal\nhemisection at the T9\u00adT10 level a spontaneous locomotor re-\ncovery was observed (Teng et al., 2002). However, in a model\nof T8 dorsal hemisection that interrupts several pathways in-\ncluding the corticospinal and the raphespinal tracts, it was\nshowed at 6 weeks after implantation of a biodegradable\nhydrogel (acrylated PLA-b-PEG-b-PLA) that the BBB score\nreached higher values (Piantino et al., 2006).

This improvement may have\nan anatomical basis, i.e.: axonal regrowth throughout the le-\nsion, myelination of the newly formed axons, synapse devel-\nopment (newly formed contacts between subpopulations of\nneurons) and/or reorganization of segmental, intersegmen-\ntal and suprasegmental axonal circuitries. Previous studies\nshowed that pHPMA hydrogel enabled the integration of\nthe CNS cellular component into the lesion and promoted\ntissue restoration of the spinal cord (Woerly et al., 1999,\n2001a). This reparative neo-histogenic process was made pos-\nsible because the polymer gel established a stable structural\nthree-dimensional continuity across the lesion cavity that\nserved as a growth template that facilitated tissue morpho-\ngenesis, organization (infiltration of host cells within the\npore structure of the gel, formation of tissue trabeculae)\nand axonal growth within the polymer implant (these axons\nwere myelinated by ectopic Schwann cell that may have mi-\ngrated into the lesion/implantation site). Thus, it had been\nsuggested that pHPMA hydrogel had a strong stimulating\neffect on neurons and Schwann cells activity as well as sup-\nporting revascularization of the lesion site and having an\napparent protective effect against Wallerian degeneration\ngested that because of its physico-chemical properties, the\n160 C 2013 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits unrestricted use, distribution\nand reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\npHPMA in repair of transected spinal cord\nFigure 7 Axonal staining\n(A) Green NF-H-stained axonal profiles were accumulated at the lesion (L)\nedge, and deeply penetrate throughout the lesion when matrix was applied.

Our results\nalso indicated that the rate sensitivity of the H-wave in the\nLesion + Matrix group was close to control values. However,\nthe H-reflex depression was absent at 10 Hz-train stimulation\nin the Lesion and Lesion + Matrix groups.\nWe interpret these changes as consistent with the view\nthat implanted pHPMA induced a beneficial network reorga-\nnization that allows the transmission of the motor messages\nfrom the supra- to the sub-lesional spinal cord and that\nSCI resulted in a marked alteration in the distribution of\nbackground excitation and inhibition, producing changes in\nmotoneuron excitability.\nIt was previously described that SCI in mammals are fol-\nlowed by a `spinal shock' period with muscle paralysis, flaccid\nmuscle tone, and loss of tendon reflexes below the level of\ninjury. Several weeks after injury, a spastic syndrome de-\nvelops showing exaggerated tendon jerks, increased mus-\ncle tone, and muscle spasm (Hiersemenzel et al., 2000). This\nsecond step has been explained as a result of cortical and\nsubcortical release of spinal cord reflex circuits connecting\nmuscle and skin sensory afferents with intact interneurons\nand motoneurons (Engberg et al., 1968). Corticospinal pro-\njections from primary, premotor and supplementary motor\nareas have been implicated in the modulation of spinal re-\nflexes by mechanisms of presynaptic inhibition onto affer-\nent sensory projections and their synapses with interneurons\nand motoneurons (Petersen et al., 1998). The cortically driven\nregulatory activity ceases when descending pathways are in-\nterrupted by the injury, thus giving rise to enhanced activity\nof spinal segmental reflexes under the injury level. The SCI-\ninduced changes in the H-reflex by (i) increasing the H-wave\namplitude and H/M ratio at the baseline stimulation and (ii)\nreducing rate depression upon low-frequency stimulation.\nDiverse mechanisms may be involved in the post-traumatic\nH-reflex enhancement such as increase in motoneuron ex-\ncitability due to reappearance of large persistent inward\nionic currents, decrease of presynaptic inhibition of Ia af-\nferents, enhanced post-activation depression of transmitter\nrelease in Ia terminals and reduced reciprocal inhibition by\nIa terminals from antagonist muscles (Hultborn, 2003; Li and\nIt is commonly described that short-term alteration in reflex\nexcitability, occurring within hours and days after SCI, can be\nexplained by loss of supraspinal and propriospinal inputs, by\nalterations in receptors and channels in motoneurons and\nby presynaptic terminals modulating neuronal excitability\nFrigon and Rossignol, 2006). In contrast, long-term changes,\nrequiring weeks or even months, are generally associated with\nstructural synaptic plasticity, i.e. axonal sprouting and for-\nmation of new synaptic contacts between primary afferents\nor spared descending axons, on the one hand, and interneu-\nrons and motoneurons in the lumbar spinal cord, on the other\nhand.\nAn unexpected observation in rats has previously been\nreported (Lee et al., 2005): rats with mild contusion injury,\nand thus fairly good functional recovery, display a decrease\nin the rate depression of the H-reflex, i.e. becomes more ab-\nnormal between the 1st and the 8th post-operative weeks.\nIn contrast, the same authors reported that the depression\nincreases, i.e. becomes more `normal', in rats with complete\ntransection of the spinal cord, an injury leading to poor func-\ntional outcome.

They suggested\nthat the H-reflex recovers some sensitivity to afferent stimu-\nlus frequency in the absence of any supraspinal connections.\nHowever, when supraspinal connections are partially spared,\nthere is a further loss in sensitivity of the H-reflex to afferent\nstimulation frequency. After a complete spinal cord transec-\ntion an increase in GAD (glutamic acid decarboxylase) and\nGABA (-amino-butyric acid) is observed (Smith et al., 1976;\nnaptic inhibition of Ia afferents is GABA-mediated, increased\nGABA could explain the higher depression rate observed over\ntime after transection. More recently Rudomin and Schmidt\nrecovery in mice is associated with enhanced H-reflex re-\nsponses, an unexpected finding regarding the general view\nthat hyperexcitability is a negative pathophysiological factor.\nThese authors thus suggested that reduction in the rate sen-\nsitivity of the H-reflex provides functional advantages after\nincomplete SCI (compression) in mice.\nThe Lesion group presents the lowest baseline Hmax\n/Mmax\nratio 14 weeks after the hemisection. This result was related\nto a decrease in H-wave amplitude whereas the M-wave am-\nplitude was maintained in any of our experimental groups.\nThe presence of a decrease in the baseline Hmax\n/Mmax\nratio\n14 weeks after the SCI seems to contradict previous reports.\nIf baseline Hmax\n/Mmax\nratio was solely influenced by tonic\ninhibition from supraspinal pathways, then we should have\nobserved an elevated baseline ratio if these descending path-\nways were interrupted. One previous study has reported an\nincrease in the H-wave amplitude during the first couple of\ndays after partial thoracic transection (80\u00ad95%) and a re-\nturn to pre-injury values by the 3-4 days after injury (Chen\net al., 2001). The authors suggested that plasticity induced by\nthe presence of spared supraspinal or intraspinal pathways\nmay explain these results after SCI.

The abnormal low baseline Hmax\n/Mmax\nratio observed in our Lesion group may reflect a motoneuron\nloss and/or changes in excitability properties in a context of\nsevere SCI in which few descending axons were poorly or\nnot functional. In the Lesion + Matrix group, the higher ratio\n(similar to the Control group ratio) may be explained by the\nbeneficial effect of the implanted hydrogel, which may limit\nthe glial scar formation, reform the tissue structure and help\npromote axonal regeneration across or around the lesion\nsite. In the context of neuroplasticity alone, a decrease in\nsecondary damage due to a less severe inflammatory reaction\nin the Lesion + Matrix group may also explain the observed\nfunctional improvement.\nSeveral situations have been described in the literature.\nFor example, a longitudinal study performed in tetraplegic\npatients reported an elevated T. anterior Hmax\n/Mmax\nratio as-\nsociated with a decrease in M-wave amplitude (Hiersemenzel\net al., 2000) while it was reported an increased ratio until 1\nmonth after complete thoracic transection in the rat (Valero-\nCabre et al., 2004). However, contrary to our study and others\n(Lee et al., 2005) in which only the peroneal branch was stim-\nulated, they obtained their electrophysiological responses by\nstimulating the entire sciatic nerve which undoubtedly stim-\nulated many muscles of the hindlimb that induced reciprocal\nfacilitations between different muscle groups, as it was re-\nported in SCI patients (Crone et al., 2003; Xia and Rymer,\n2005). Some evidence indicated a correlation between 5-\nHT-IR and baseline Hmax\n/Mmax\nratio after incomplete SCI\nsuggesting that spared descending serotonergic fibres may\nbe involved (e.g. sprouting) in the recruitment of more mo-\nwe can hypothesize that there is virtually no local serotonin\nas previously described after complete spinal cord transec-\ntion (Schmidt and Jordan, 2000) and that the recovery of the\nHmax\n/Mmax\nratio observed in the Lesion + Matrix group was\nmainly due to plasticity of spared descending pathways, or a\nregrowth of injured axons through or around the hydrogel, or\nchanges in the motoneurons properties and 5-HT receptors.\nAxonal and myelin preservation\nIn this study, we confirm that the application of this type of\nmatrix promotes axonal regrowth mainly supported at the\nedge of the matrix. Here we observed a higher presence\nof macrophages/monocytes (ED-1-positives cells), that may\nsuggest a correlation between such axonal sprouting and\nthe higher number of macrophages/monocytes. The higher\nnumber of ED-1-positive cells might be due to some reten-\ntion action by the matrix. It is well known that the number\nof macrophages/monocytes has a peak around a week after\nspinal cord lesioning, and that later it decreases (Bottai et al.,\n2010). It is possible that the higher number observed in the\nLesion + Matrix group might be due to a slower decrease\ncompared with Lesion group rather than to an attractive\naction by the matrix itself. In addition, we show that matrix\ngreatly counteracts the degeneration of myelin both rostrally\nand caudally to the lesion. The improved myelin preservation\nsuggests a neuroprotective action by the matrix that seems to\nreduce the extent of secondary degeneration induced by the\nlesion. Such preservation occurs in the ventral white matter,\nwhere the reticular spinal pathway descends. This pathway\nregulates the movement of the rodent foot. Previous studies\nshowed that pHPMA hydrogel implanted into the transected\nor compressed spinal cord cavity promoted the formation of\na replacement tissue with histotypic characteristics of the\nformed a stable bridge between the cord stumps was infil-\ntrated by a reparative tissue composed of glial cells, capillary\nvessels, newly formed neurons presumably from precursor\ncells of the ependyma and/or migrating neurons and re-\ngenerating afferent and efferent axons (Woerly et al., 1998,\nConclusion\nThis work demonstrates that acute pHPMA hydrogel implan-\ntation into the hemisected T10 rat spinal cord induced loco-\nmotor and neurophysiological improvements. This recovery\nmight be due either to a more suitable environment for re-\ngenerating axons and/or to a prevention of secondary injury\nand glial scar formation inducing higher neuroplasticity. The\nsub-lesional sensori-motor loops of grafted animals seem\nto be partially once again regulated by supra-lesional in-\nfluences even though H-reflex excitability changes are still\npresent 14 weeks after the SCI. Further studies are needed to\ndetermine which mechanisms are involved in the spinal cord\nplasticity after pHPMA hydrogel implantation. This study pro-\nvides new insight into the concept that biomaterial technol-\nogy constitutes a promising approach to repair spinal cord\ninjuries.\n"
