Introduction\nChina's rapid economic growth in the 1990s, which averaged between 8 and\n10 percent per annum, has attracted worldwide attention (NBS, 2003). Many\nproductivity growth studies have attributed this rapid growth rate to the growth\nof total factor productivity (TFP) in China. Yeh (2004) estimates that China's\nGDP growth in China. Kaneko and Managi (2004) calculated that China's\nment in terms of economic efficiency in conventional outputs and inputs, such\nas capital, labor and intermediate inputs, for which the quantity and prices can\nbe directly observed from the market.\nWith rapid economic growth, China's energy use and environmental pollution\nhave increased significantly, and the environmental quality in China has continued\nto deteriorate. Based on estimates by the World Bank (1997) and Ho and Jorgenson\n2\u00ad8 percent of total GDP. Therefore, because they do not consider undesirable\nnon-market outputs, such as environmental pollution, conventional TFP studies\nare seriously misleading in explaining true technology changes in terms of both\nproduction efficiency and environmental efficiency from the social point of view.\nIn the late 1990s, the Chinese Government started to implement a series of\nenvironmental regulations, including direct command and control in pollution\nabatement technologies, national emission control standards and pollution levy\nsystems on both particulate matters and sulfur dioxide. These policies have been\nparticularly implemented in pollution intensive sectors, such as the electricity,\nthe primary metal and the chemical sector. With the gradual stringency of environ-\nmental regulation, firms have been diverting more resources to pollution treatment\nto meet the environmental standards. Therefore, even if there is slow TFP growth\nin terms of conventional inputs or outputs, as long as R&D improves environmental\nquality or environmental efficiency, from the perspective of sustainable development\nan improvement is still achieved in terms of true technological progress. In\ncontrast, for some rising markets with increasing demands, such as construction\nand transportation industries, the conventional TFP approach might overestimate\ntrue productivity growth by ignoring the rapidly increasing pollution emissions\nand associated environmental damage cause by these industries.\nLet us do a simple thought experiment to consider this issue. Suppose that\nfirms have multiple ways of producing the same amount of output with the same\nquality; one is to use a conventional pollution-intensive production technology\nwith less factor inputs such as capital and labor, and the other involves green\nproduction but requires more of other factor inputs. The conventional TFP\napproach suggests that the cheaper pollution intensive technology has higher\nproductivity using less conventional inputs, whereas the green production with\n \nmore resources allocated to pollution abatement would imply low productivity\ngrowth. Undoubtedly, this reflects the traditional view that environmental\nregulations negatively impact productivity growth. However, neoclassical\neconomic theory also asserts that what really matters is not how much in goods\nis produced in society, but the available welfare level where consumers optimize\ntheir consumption choices given the resource constraints. In the conventional\nTFP framework, without considering the dimension of consumption on environ-\nmental quality, the optimal condition that requires the productivity frontier to\nbe tangent with the utility curve would lead to a misleading efficiency point.\nThe conventional approach does not take into account the substitution between\ncommodity consumption and environmental quality.\nTherefore, the conventional approach does not provide a reliable indicator of\noverall economic efficiency, because it only captures the loss in factor costs as\na result of stricter environmental regulations but ignores the gains in environmental\nbenefits. More importantly, this biased measurement will inevitably direct our\nattention to less efficient use of environmentally friendly abatement technologies\nand instill a bias to government policies.\nIn sum, if one wants to measure how rapidly changes in technology progress,\nin terms of both commodity production and environmental efficiency from a\nsocial welfare point of view, the conventional TFP index needs to be extended\nto a green TFP index framework. The latter method not only considers conven-\ntional inputs, such as labor, capital, intermediate energy and non-energy inputs,\nbut also incorporates the non-market value of environmental costs. Therefore,\nthis method can be used to investigate real productivity growth and technology\nchanges from the perspective of sustainable development.\nThe paper proceeds as follows. In Section II, a summary of the published\nliterature on empirical TFP estimates in China, recent developments in the\nmethodology of green TFP accounting, and applications in the developed countries\nis presented. Section III provides a detail explanation of how to construct the\nindex on sectoral output, capital, labor and intermediate inputs, as well as\nquantifying the aggregate price and quantity index of environmental health\ndamage. In Section IV\n, the flaws in the conventional TFP methodology framework\nare discussed and a new framework for calculating green TFP is presented.\nEmpirical estimates of green TFP for China's manufacturing sectors are given\nin Section V, and Section VI concludes the paper.\nII. Literature Review\nEconomic theory to measure a society's productivity growth was developed\nmore than half a century ago. The notion of efficiency or productivity change as\na measure of change in economic efficiency was first introduced in Stigler's\n(1967) shifted the literature's focus from labor productivity to TFP, which measures\n \nhow well a society uses its scarce resources. Over the past 50 years, a tremendous\namount of literature has contributed to the intellectual development of TFP\nThere have been many conventional TFP measurement studies in China, at\nboth the aggregate level and at detailed census and survey data level, in particular\nTFP growth of the non-agriculture sector to be only 1.4 percent per year. Ho\nand Jorgenson (2001) used the gross output data from a time-series input\u00adoutput\ntable, rather than value-added data alone, and measured the sectoral TFP and\ncalculated the aggregate for China. Their results suggest that for the sample\ngrowth; in the manufacturing sector, some industries exhibited positive pro-\nductivity gains whereas others experienced negative productivity growth. Ren\nand Sun (2005) constructed a more recent time series input\u00adoutput table with\nsectors. They then calculated the Domar-weighted aggregate at the national level\nfor four sub-periods. Their study shows that, first, there was a fast TFP growth\nWoo et al. (1994) investigated productivity growth with different ownership\nstructures using detailed survey data rather than economic aggregate data, and\nfound that collective-owned enterprises have higher TFP growth than state-\nowned enterprises (SOE) or other ownership enterprises; results for TFP growth\nin SOE are inconclusive, with both positive and negative effects. Zhang et al.\n(2001) conducted similar research, and suggested that foreign owned enterprises\nhave the highest efficiency score and that SOE have the lowest. Although\nmeasuring TFP at both macro and micro levels has been extensively studied,\ncurrent TFP literature only takes into account the market output, while leaving\nout the non-market part of the production process: environmental damages.\nGreen accounting, particularly green GDP, has become an important topic\nattracting attention from both academia and government policy-makers. It is widely\naccepted that the conventional national GDP account needs to be adjusted to\naccount for the degradation of both environmental and natural resources. The\nState Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) and the National Bureau of\nStatistics (NBS) have already formed working groups for calculating green\nGDP. There have also been some trial estimations of China's green GDP. For\n1990s was actually achieved at the cost of the degradation of natural resources\nand the environment. He also points out that from a sustainable development point\nof view, 40\u00ad60 percent of annual GDP growth should be deducted to compensate\nfor environmental degradation. However, Lei only calculates the green GDP for\n1992, by constructing an environmental accounting extension of the official\n1992 input\u00adoutput (IO) table, which only gives a value term for the static quo\n \nof a single year 1992, rather than indicating the dynamic efficiency changes in\nthe whole Chinese economic system. Therefore, following a similar idea of green\naccounting, the present paper extends the `green' concept to productivity.\nGreen GDP only measures the size of economic activities, whereas green TFP\naggregates over all sectors indicate the efficiency changes of `green' productivity\nover time.\nCurrently, there are still very few studies considering how non-market\nresources should be incorporated in a model of productivity growth. This is\npartly due to the fact that the prices and quantities of those non-marketable\nresources, such as changes in environmental quality or natural resource stocks,\nare not readily available. In addition, the equivalence between the producer's\nmodel and consumer's model are not reliable for calculating the weights\npoint out that the conventional method of TFP accounting ignores environmental\ndamages. They revise the concept by augmenting the conventional output to\n`total' output, which takes into account the emissions released from the production\nprocess. However, the model in Repetto et al. is not derived from productivity\ntheory, and the input shares are still the same as those in the conventional TFP\nframework. Because consumers face different marginal prices for an output\ncompared with producers, the equivalence link between the producers' and\nconsumers' model would be broken. Swinand (1999) further addresses this\nissue, and extends the model in Repetto et al. to a welfare-based `total resource\nproductivity (TRP)' framework, which is applied to the agriculture sector in\nUSA, by estimating the marginal abatement cost of pesticide leaching in ground\nwater. In addition, the social price of clean water is determined. Although Swinand\ncorrects the price and weights in the paper by Repetto et al. and provides a\ntheoretical basis for the green TFP, he still uses pollutant emissions as the quantity\nto measure the growth index of environmental damages. Therefore, Swinand's\npaper ignores the complexity of the emissions' air dispersion process: people in\ndifferent geographic sites and exposed to varying conditions inhale different\ndosages of pollutants. Hence, different environmental impacts are generated.\nThis paper follows Swinand's TRP approach, but revises Swinand's emission\nindex to create an environmental damage index; that is, an index of monetized\nphysical impact of pollution. In addition, this paper conducts an industry level\ngreen TFP analysis for all the manufacturing sectors in China. Ideally, one\nneeds to quantify the time-series environmental damages of all the pollutants\nand their various impacts on human health, crop productivity, forests, water\nbodies, the ecosystem and physical infrastructure. However, many environmental\nexperts believe that air pollution damage to human health dominates other types\nof environmental impacts. For example, based on a World Bank study, the total\npollution costs in China are approximately US$54bn a year, which includes\nurban and indoor air pollution, lead exposure, water pollution, and acid rain on\ncrops, materials and the ecosystem (World Bank 1997). It is estimated that total\nair pollution-induced health damages are the largest component of pollution\n \ncosts: making up approximately 80 percent of the total damages.1 Because of\ndata limitations, the present study only considers air pollution-induced health\ndamage in the green TFP framework.\nIII. Data\nThe present paper uses data from IO tables that were constructed from NBS raw\ndata by Professor Ren Ruoen and his group at Beihang University (Xu et al.,\n2005). Time-series IO tables, in particular `Use' or `Activity' tables, which\nconsist of inter-industry sections (dimensioned 33 commodities by 33 commod-\nities), value-added row sections, and final demand sections, are used. The labor\ninput data used in the present study was constructed by Professor Yue Ximing in\nRenmin University, based on the value estimates from the time-series IO tables\nand data from the household survey of income distributions in China.2\nThe methodology used in this study to compile the output, capital, labor and\nintermediate inputs closely follows that in Ho and Jorgenson (2001), Jorgenson\ndescription of the method of calculating the price and quantity index of conventional\ngross outputs and all inputs.\nThe environmental emission data in this study is primarily collected from the\nSinton Energy Databook (version 6) (Sinton et al., 2004). The environmental\ndamage valuation using the intake fraction method follows previous estimation\nwork in a computable general equilibrium model of the Chinese economy (Cao\nIII.1 Measuring capital input\nTo construct an index of capital input for each industrial sector Kjt\n, the present\npaper uses the Divisia method to derive the capital aggregate over multiple\ntypes of capital assets: structures, equipments and auto vehicles.\nwhere\n( j = 1, 2, . . . , 28; k = structure, equipment, auto vehicles).\n1.

Recall that total emissions are collected\nfrom Sinton et al. (2004), and are made up of combustion emissions and non-\ncombustion (process) emissions.\nwhere x = TSP, SO2\nis the annual emissions\nof pollutant x (in kilotons), and the C and NC superscripts denote combustion\nand non-combustion, respectively.\nIn the environmental health literature, the intake fraction (IF) is defined as\n`the integrated incremental intake of a pollutant released from a source or source\ncategory (such as mobile sources or power plants), summed over all exposed\nindividuals during a given exposure time, per unit of emitted pollutant' (Ho and\nJorgenson, 2007, pp. 293). The intake fraction of pollutant x from source r is\ndefined as:\nd E d E\nd M d M\njt Eet\nj\ne\njet\njt Mit\nj\ni\njit\nln ln\nln ln\n=\n=\n\n\n\n\n \nEet\nj\nEet\nj\nEet\nj\nMit\nj\nMit\nj\nMit\nj\nEet\nj Eet\nj\njet\nEet\nj\njet\ne\nMit\nj Mit\nj\njit\nMit\nj\njit\ni\nv v v v\nv\np E\np E\nv\np E\np M\n( ) ( )\n.\n= + = +\n= =\n- -\n \njxt jxt\nC\njxt\nNC\n= +\niF\nEM\nxr\nxd d\nd\nxr\n=\n\n \nwhere Cxd\nis the change in concentration at location d as a result of emissions\nEMXY\n, POPd\nis the population at d, and BR is the breathing rate (Ho and Jorgenson,\n2007). The industrial iF index (50 km) in China has been calculated from the\natmospheric dispersion models for the monitoring region in five sample urban\nareas for various sectors (Wang et al., 2007). Following similar adjustments in\nHo and Jorgenson (2007), the iF parameter for the whole of China is scaled by\nmultiplying the 50 km local sample iF parameter by a factor of three. Therefore,\na time-series iF parameter index at the national level (N) can be constructed as\nin Equation (6), where  is the adjustment parameter for converting air dispersion\nmodel iF sample parameters to the extended parameters at the national level,\nis the urban population at year t,4 and POPt0\nis the urban population at\n= 1997, which was chosen as the base year in the intake fraction estimations:\nHence, one can estimate the health effects by sector. Following Ho and\nJorgenson's (2007) definition, the total dosage DOSEjxt\nof pollutant x for sector\nj is defined as the product of iFxt\nand the total national emissions of pollutant\nx from sector j. Now substitute in the definition of the intake fraction from\nEquation (5), and the dosage can be interpreted as the quantity of pollutant x\ninhaled by the total population in location d exposed to concentration C of\nindustrial emissions from sector j, summed over all locations d in the country\nThis paper also takes into account secondary particles of sulfate (SO2\n) and\nnitrate (NOx), thus the dosage of total PM10\ncan be expressed as follows:\nBased on the epidemiology literature, one can derive the quantity of physical\nhealth damage Djht\nof each health endpoint h for sector j, by multiplying the\ndose-response coefficients DRhx\nby the pollutant dosage DOSEjxt\n, and dividing\nby the breathing rate BR, then summing over all the pollutants x:\n(h = mortality, respiratory hospital admissions), (9)\nwhere h denotes various types of health endpoints, including mortality, respiratory\nhospital admissions, emergency room visits, restricted activity days, lower\nrespiratory infection/child (asthmatic), asthma attacks, chronic bronchitis,\nrespiratory symptoms and so forth.\n4.

Differing from Repetto et al.\nquantity index of health damages, but uses the physical impacts of health\neffects directly to calculating the quantity index.\nEstimating the time-series price of health effects\nIf one treats environmental quality as a normal good (i.e. people demand more\nwhen their income increases), then the time-series unit price of health damages\nneeds to be updated with time t.\nMortality The valuation of mortality is based on the willingness to pay (WTP)\napproach, which reflects an individual's preference on environmental quality. In\nview of the technical, financial and temporal requirements for generating local\nWTP estimates, a benefit transfer (BT) approach is used to calculate the value\nof averted premature deaths. Following Ho and Jorgenson (2007), the present\npaper uses the average value found in the Zhou and Hammit (2007) study of\nBeijing and Anqing: approximately 367 600 yuan. GDP per capita is used to\nadjust the unit price of averted premature death to each time point t:\nMorbidity The BT method is also applied to derive a morbidity value, which is\nbased on the World Bank (1997) study. First, the US dollar currency value used\nin the World Bank's study is converted to the Chinese yuan, and then the unit\nvalue of each morbidity endpoint h is adjusted by GDP per capita in China and\nCPI in the USA:\nAggregate index of sectoral health damage output\nThe sections above summarize the calculation of quantity and price indexes for\neach health endpoint for each manufacturing sector. To construct an aggregate\nindex of health damage output (negative) or input (positive) over all the health\nendpoints, including mortality, respiratory hospital admissions, chronic bronchitis,\nthis paper assumes that sectoral health damages, Djt\n, can be expressed as a\ntranslog function of each individual component of health Dhj,t\n. The corresponding\nindex of sectoral health damage is a translog quantity index of individual health\nendpoint damage:\nGDP per capita China\nGDP per capita China\nmortality t mortality\nt\n, ,\n( )\n( )\n=\nGDP per capita China\nGDP per capita China\nht h\nt t\n( )\n( )\n( )\n( )\n,\n=\nln ln (ln ln )\njt jt hd\nj\njht jht\nh\n- = -\n- -\n\n\n \nwhere weights are given by average shares of each component health endpoint\nin the value of total health damages at time t:\nand\n.\nAn alternative way to measure the quantity index of environmental damages\nis to use the index of quality adjusted life years (QALY) method, which combines\nboth the length and quality of life into a single measure. This method has been\nextensively used in studies concerning cost-effectiveness in developed countries.\nHowever, the QALY method requires enormous data, including human charac-\nteristics and lifetime projections. In the developing countries like China, it is\nvery difficult to apply this method to measure environmental damages because\nof the inadequacy of the available data. Therefore, the present paper still uses the\nconventional `environmental damage impact path' method and dose-response\nfunctions to measure air pollution-associated health damages.\nIII.5 The concept of green output\nGreen GDP has been used by environmentalists and economists for many years by\nadjusting the traditional GDP concept through a deduction of negative environ-\nmental and resource impacts. To measure `true' productivity growth, one must\nnot only capture the efficiency of a society's use of scarce marketed resources,\nbut also take into account the efficiency of non-market resources, such as air quality.\nFor this purpose, this paper defines a new `green output' concept W for the\ngreen TFP calculations. This is an aggregate index of the market output Y and\nnon-market residue `output' of negative environmental damages D:\nd ln W = sy\nd ln Y + sd\nwhere sy\nand sd\nare the share of the value of market output Y and the share of\nthe value of environmental damages D in the value of `green output', respectively.\nBecause environmental damages are negative, residual `output', sd\n, is a negative\nterm that implicitly suggests that the shadow price of negative environmental\nquality is negative as well. Whether environmental damages are treated as negative\noutputs or as positive inputs, the results are the same numerically.\nIV. Methodology\nThe basic idea here is to incorporate the non-market undesirable output `pollution'\ninto the green TFP framework. Let us start with the conventional TFP\n\nhd\nj\nhdt\nj\nhdt\nj\nv v\n( )\n= + -\nv\nhdt\nj ht jht\nht jht\nh\n=\n\n \nmethodology, assuming that the total technology change is the unexplained\nresidual of productivity growth (Solow, 1957). Then one can treat environmental\ndamages, predominantly air pollution-associated health damages (World Bank,\n1997), as an undesirable non-market traded `output' from the production process,\nand return it to the conventional TFP framework, as discussed in Section IV.2.\nIV.1 Measurement of conventional total factor productivity index\nBecause the present paper focuses on TFP at the industry level, let us assume\nthat each sector has a unique linearly homogenous function f j(\u00b7). The production\nis characterized as constant returns to scale. The sectoral output Yj\ncan be\nexpressed as a function of two primary inputs, capital input Kj\nand labor input\nLj\n, and two aggregate intermediate inputs, energy aggregate Ej\nand non-energy\nmaterial aggregate Mj\n. T denotes time that indexes technology level:\nYj\n= f j(Kj\n, Lj\n, Ej\n, Mj\nNow, sectoral TFP can be derived by taking total logarithmical differentiation\nof Equation (14), which yields:\nIn reality, each sector might face different wages or rental prices as well as\ndifferent marginal products of their inputs. Therefore, this paper models specific\nprices for all the inputs. Now the sectoral planner needs to maximize the sectoral\nprofits subject to the production function (Equation 14)\nf j(Kj\n, Lj\n, Ej\n, Mj\n, T) - PK, j\n\u00b7 Kj\n- PL, j\n\u00b7 Lj\n- PE, j\n\u00b7 Ej\n- PM, j\n\u00b7 Mj\nTaking first-order conditions will yield the sector specific equilibrium\nconditions\nEquation (17) suggests that the marginal product of all primary and inter-\nmediate inputs must be equal to the sectoral specific factor or input prices. In\naddition, the following identity must hold, which suggests that the value of total\noutputs should equal the value of total inputs.\nPj\nYj\n= PK, j\nKj\n+ PL, j\nLj\n+ PE, j\nEj\n+ PM, j\nMj\nd Y\ndT\nf\nK\nd K\ndT\nf\nL\nd L\ndT\nf\nE\nd E\ndT\nf\nM\nd M\ndT\nf\nT\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\nln ln\nln\nln ln\nln\nln ln\nln\nln\nln\nln\nln ln\n.\n= + +\n+ +\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP\nf\nK\nf\nL\nP\nP\nf\nE\nf\nM\nP\nj\nj\nj\nK j j\nj\nj\nL j\nj\nj\nj\nE j j\nj\nj\nM j\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n, ,\n, ,\n= =\n= =\n \nSubstituting the first-order conditions (Equation 17) into Equation (15), one\nderives:\nRearrange the terms, and the conventional TFP can be derived as follows:\nEquation (20) is referred to as the Divisia index of TFP change.\nIn practice, because of the discrete data points in time, a translog function\nis usually assumed if constant returns to scale conditions and concavity\nconstraints are satisfied. Therefore, for the two discrete periods t and t \u00ad 1, the\naverage TFP change can be approximated using the Tornqvist index of TFP\nchange, which was proved by Diewert (1976):\nTFP =  ln Yj\n- (\nK,j\n ln Kj\n+ \nL, j\n ln Lj\n+ \nE, j\n ln Ej\n+ \nM, j\n ln Mj\nwhere x = xT\ndenotes the change between period T \u00ad 1 and T, and  is the\ntwo-period average share of the input in the nominal value of adjusted output.\nTherefore, the rate of productivity change is defined as the residual of the\ngrowth rate of output after deducting the growth rate of all its input indexes,\nwhich are weighted by their cost share of the total output value.\nFor each discrete period T, the value share of each input is defined in\n5.

Pittman\n(1983) proposes a producer-cost measure to model pollution as an undesirable\noutput. He defines national income as the value of total goods consumption\nminus the total abatement costs of reducing pollution. Repetto et al. (1996)\ncounter that argument by showing how the productivity growth measure\nmisrepresents the industrial process by taking only pollution abatement costs\ninto account and ignoring pollution damage averted. Repetto et al. also conduct\nan empirical study of green productivity in electricity power, pulp and paper,\nand agriculture sectors in the USA.\nIn addition, following Repetto's work, several recent studies argue that\npollution should not be valued at its (negative) shadow producer's price, but at\nits (negative) shadow consumer price from the social welfare perspective,\nthereby suggesting that the consumer's marginal rate of substitution between\npollution and numeraire composite good replace the marginal abatement cost\nRepetto's study makes a significant contribution in this field, as Swinand (1999)\npoints, Repetto does not derive his green TFP measurement from productivity\ntheory. In addition, the present paper finds that Repetto's green TFP method\nrevises the share weight for output and pollutant emissions, but keeps the same\ninput share parameters for other inputs, as in the conventional TFP framework;\nthis might violate the dual identity between the production model and the\nconsumption model (Equation 26).\nUsing a similar consumer demand-side approach, as in Chaston et al. (1997) and\nSwinand (1999), let us modify the conventional TFP analysis by posing a transforma-\ntion function Wj(\u00b7), with the scale of the green output denoted as a scalar, wj:\nwj  Wj(Yj\n, Kj\n, Lj\n, Ej\n, Mj\n, Dj\nwhere Yj\n= f j(Kj\n, Lj\n, Ej\n, Mj\n, T) and Dj\nis the quantity of environmental health\ndamages. wj denotes the maximum scale level of augmented output,6 which\nincludes both desirable marketable outputYj\nand undesirable non-marketable Dj\n.\nNow taking the total logarithmic derivative of Equation (24) and solving\nfor the partial derivative of Wj with respect to the time-based technology level\n6. The scale of output can be normalized to unity with no loss of generality.\n \nT, we can derive a similar equation to Equation (15) in the conventional TFP\nframework:\nThe change in Wj with respect to time-based technology level T is defined as\ngreen productivity growth: green TFP in this paper.\nNow the identity equations are given as follows:\nBased on standard perfect competition, constant returns to scale, and the\nnecessary conditions for profit maximization, the following first-order conditions\ncan be derived, which make Equation (25) tractable in practice:\nSubstituting the above first-order conditions (27) into Equation (25), we\nobtain the green TFP as follows:\nAs with the approximation procedure for the conventional TFP discussed in\nSection IV.1, one can derive a Tornqvist index of green TFP change as follows:\nGreenTFP = \u00df\nY, j\n ln Yj\n-\n-\n-\n- (\u00df\nK, j\n ln Kj\n+ \u00df\nL, j\n ln Lj\n+ \u00df\nE, j\n ln Ej\n+ \u00df\nM, j\n ln Mj\n+ \u00df\nD, j\n ln Dj\nwhere x = xT\ndenotes the change between period T \u00ad 1 and T, and \u00df is the\ntwo-period average share of the input in the nominal value of adjusted output.\nCompared to the conventional TFP approach, in this green TFP framework there\nis one additional negative output term or positive input term, an environmental\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nln ln\nln\nln ln\nln\nln ln\nln\nln\nln\nln\nln ln\nln\nln ln\nln\nln\n.\nW\nT\nW\nY\nd Y\ndT\nW\nK\nd K\ndT\nW\nL\nd L\ndT\nW\nE\nd E\ndT\nW\nM\nd M\ndT\nW\nD\nd D\ndT\nj j\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\n= - - -\n- - -\nP w PY P D\nj\nW\nj j j D j j\nK j j L j j E j j M j j j j\n,\n, , , ,\n= -\n+ + + =\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nW\nK\nP\nP\nW\nL\nP\nP\nW\nE\nP\nP\nW\nM\nP\nP\nW\nD\nP\nP\nW\nY\nP\nP\nj\nj\nK j\nj\nW\nj\nj\nL j\nj\nW\nj\nj\nE j\nj\nW\nj\nj\nM j\nj\nW\nj\nj\nD j\nj\nW\nj\nj\nj\nj\nW\n.\n, ,\n, ,\n,\n= =\n= =\n= = -\n\n\nln ln ln ln\nln ln ln\n, ,\n, , ,\nW\nT\nPY\np w\nd Y\ndT\np w\nd K\ndT\np w\nd L\ndT\np w\nd E\ndT\np w\nd M\ndT\np w\nd D\nj\nj j\nj\nW\nj\nj K j j\nj\nW\nj\nj L j j\nj\nW\nj\nj\nE j j\nj\nW\nj\nj M j j\nj\nW\nj\nj D j j\nj\nW\nj\nj\n= - -\n- - -\ndT\ndT\n.\n \ndamage term . In addition,the denominator\nof the share parameter is not the value of marketable output, but the value of\ngreen output in which the damages of environmental pollutions are netted out.\nV. Empirical Results\nTable 1 lists a snapshot view for the year 2000 based on the IO table. In this\nstudy, there are 28 manufacturing sectors, in which the largest sector by value-\nadded or gross output is construction, followed by electrical machinery and\nchemical sectors. The sector with the lowest gross output is gas utilities. The\nsector with the largest capital stock is the transportation sector, followed by the\nelectric sector. The construction sector not only produces the largest gross output\nbut also requires the most labor inputs. The transportation sector consumes the\nsecond most labor. The gross output of the total 28 manufacturing sectors was\nTable 2 gives the growth rates of output, inputs and health damage averaged\nsuch as electrical machinery, communications, instruments, furniture and fixtures\nand apparel industries, grew very fast. Industries that are heavy polluters, such as\nconstruction, chemicals, primary metal, stone, clay, and glass industries, also grew\nfast in our sample period. The gross output growth rate of the biggest air pollution\nemitter, the electricity sector, is modest at approximately 9.2 percent per year.\nGrowth of sectoral capital, labor, energy aggregate inputs, and non-energy\nmaterial aggregate inputs are reported in the next four columns of Table 2.\nRecall that because it is assumed that the growth rate in the capital quality is\ntoo small, the growth rate in capital input is roughly equal to the growth in the\ncapital stock. In most energy intensive and some heavily polluted sectors, such\nas coal mining, oil and gas extraction, construction, miscellaneous manufactur-\ning, transportation, electric utilities and gas utilities, the growth rate of capital\ninput is higher than that of output. For these sectors, the growth rates are mainly\ndriven by the rapid growth rates in capital inputs. However, this might be due to\nan overestimate or poor guesses of the initial capital stock for those sectors. For\nexample, in the electricity sector, the deflators used in Ren's capital dataset\nmight be underestimated. In the other sectors, the growth rates of capital inputs\nare smaller than the growth rates of the gross outputs.\nThe growth rate in labor inputs is modest for most of the manufacturing sectors.\nIn the 1990s, most trade-oriented sectors and labor-intensive sectors, such as\napparel, leather, construction, electrical machinery, miscellaneous manufacturing,\nelectric utilities and gas utilities, had very high growth rates. For the energy and\nnon-energy material aggregate, growth rate patterns for labor inputs are similar\nto output growth. Although some sectors had higher growth in energy aggregate\ninputs, others had higher growth in non-energy aggregate inputs.\n- -\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00dfD j j\nD j j\nj\nW\nj\nj\nD\nP w\nd D\ndT\n,\n,\nln ,\nln\n or\n \nTable 1 Sectoral characteristics of the economy in 2000\nSector Output input\n(bn yuan)\nCapital input\n(bn yuan)\nLabor input\n(bn yuan)\nEnergy input\n(bn yuan)\nMaterial\n(bn yuan)\nCapital Stock\n(bn yuan)\nEmployment\n(million)\n \nTable 2 Growth rate of sectoral output, input and health damages (growth rates % per annum)\nSector Output\nCapital input\nLabor input\nEnergy input\nMaterial input\nEnvironmental damages\n \nUsing the environmental damage estimation methods introduced in Section\nIII.4, the sixth column of Table 2 provides the growth rate of the quantity index\nthat in many manufacturing sectors, the growth rate of environmental damage\nfar exceeds the growth rate of gross output, or any of the inputs, except for\nrapidly growing industries, such as electrical machinery, instruments, motor\nvehicles, transportation equipment, communications, or some relatively cleaner\nindustries, such as printing, publishing, and leather industries. This suggests\nthat although China has experienced rapid growth in overall output or GDP,\nenvironmental damage is growing more rapidly in many sectors. Those negative\nimpacts are currently ignored by the conventional accounting systems. Green\nGDP and green TFP are two promising methods for adjusting these biases.\nThe conventional TFP and green TFP calculations of the contribution of energy\naggregates, non-energy material aggregates, and capital and labor inputs are shown\nin Tables 3 and 4, respectively. Table 4 also presents the negative contribution of\nenvironmental damages for the green TFP method in column six.\nThe biggest contributor of environmental damages is non-energy materials.\nThe contributions from energy, capital and labor inputs are relatively low,\nexcept for the communication sector in which the contribution of capital input\nis very high, explaining almost half of output growth. Oil and gas extraction,\nand the transportation sector also have high growth rates of capital inputs; this\ncould be explained by their huge amounts of capital instalments in new facilities.\nBecause of the slow growth rates of the Chinese labor force, the contribution of\nthe growth rate of output is also very low for most of the manufacturing sectors,\nexcept for some labor-intensive sectors, such as construction, apparel, leather,\ntransportation, communications and gas utilities. The smallest, even negative\ncontributions are also those that have low growth rates in gross output, such as\ncoal mining, textile mill products, and oil and gas extraction.\nThis paper finds that for some `high tech' sectors, such as electrical machinery,\ninstruments, and communications, the growth rate of TFP is fairly high. Some\nenergy and resource-related sectors, such as metal and nonmetal mining, primary\nmetal, petroleum and the coal product sector also show high positive TFP\ngrowth. This could reflect the rapid technology changes in these sectors, as well\nas the the rapid transfer of foreign technology or improved management practices\nin these sectors during the 1990s. However, the other energy-related sectors,\nsuch as oil and gas extraction, electric utilities and gas utilities all show negative\nTFP growth. This result might be explained by the fact that land input is not taken\ninto account because of data limitations. The large price effects from economic\nreforms might also have affected the results. For example, before economic\nreform, some government-protected sectors had lower than average input prices.\nAfter economic reform and deregulation, their input prices were raised to the\nmarket level. Therefore, the growth rate of inputs is biased upward and might drive\ndown overall sectoral TFP growth. In addition, the estimates on the rate of return\nto capital in these sectors might be biased, because of insufficient official data.\n \nAs shown in Table 4, the value share of environmental damage to the value\nof output is very small for most of the manufacturing sectors, except for the\nelectric utilities and transportation sectors. The first column of Table 4 shows\nthe revised output, which is equal to \u00df\nY, j\n ln Yj\nin equation (29). Because \u00df\nY, j\nexceeds 1, the first column in Table 4 actually has a larger value of output com-\npared to the first column in Table 3. Because this paper uses green output as the\ndenominator to calculate the weighted average of value shares of all inputs, the\ncontributions of energy aggregate, non-energy material aggregate, and capital\nand labor inputs are slightly larger than those in Table 3. The sixth column of\nTable 4 shows the contribution of the environmental health damage. Note that\nthe share parameter on environmental damage is negative; therefore, the\npositive contribution of environmental damage suggests that the growth rate\nof environmental damage is negative. This indicates that there are efficiency\nimprovements in terms of pollution abatement in that sector. One can see that\nTable 3 Conventional total factor productivity (TFP) method: contributions to growth in\nSector Output Energy Materials Capital Labor TFP\n \nenergy intensive sectors, in particular electric utilities, have very negative\ncontributions to environmental damage. This suggests there were negative\nimprovements in technical efficiency in terms of pollution abatement of the\n1990s, although this effect is partly magnified by the relatively high weights of\nenvironmental cost shares compared to other sectors. Similarly, gas utilities,\ntransportation, petroleum and coal products, paper and allied, and construction\nsectors all indicate that environmental damage became worse in the 1990s.\nOnly coal mining, metal and nonmetal mining, food products, transportation\nequipment, and miscellaneous manufacturing sectors improved pollution\nabatement efficiencies. For all other sectors, the contributions of environmental\ndamage are almost zero. This could be because there was no change in terms of\nTable 4 Green total factor productivity (TFP) method: contributions to growth in sectoral\nSector Revised\noutput\nEnergy Materials Capital Labor Environmental\ndamage\nGreen\nTFP\nMetal and non-metal\nmining\nMiscellaneous\nmanufacturing\n \nthe emission abatement, or the weight of damages was too small.

In particular, after Deng\nXiaoping's trip to southern China, the country officially declared that it would\nbuild a socialist market economy with Chinese characteristics, which was\naccompanied by a rise in numerous `development zones' in coastal cities of east\nand southeast China. With rapid FDI inflow and further reform of the SOEs,\nChina's overall GDP increased very fast and the growth rate exceeded\n10 percent annually. However, during this period, energy use and resource use\nincreased very rapidly; energy efficiency was very low and environmental policy\nlagged behind economic policy. Environmental damage escalated very quickly,\nin particular in electricity utilities, gas utilities, petroleum and coal product,\nand primary metal sectors. From Table 5, one can see that the growth rates of\nenvironmental damage for the pollution-intensive sectors, such as electric utilities,\nthose in the other two periods. From the contribution of the environmental\ndamage, we can see that the electricity utilities sector had the most negative\ncontribution because it was one of China's most polluted sectors. Similarly,\nprimary metal, construction, chemicals, petroleum and coal products also made\nlarge contributions in terms of environmental damage.\ngraded while private ownership, township and village industrial enterprises\nwere elevated as important components of China's economy. Although these\nsmall private firms were more able to fit into the new market-oriented economy,\nvery few of them were equipped with emission abatement facilities or end pipe\ntreatments at that time. Therefore, for sectors like stone, clay, glass, printing\nand publishing, leather, and paper, the growth rate of environmental damage\nwas very high. In 1996, SEPA enlarged the geographical area to collect the SO2\nemission charge at 0.20 yuan per kg for SO2\nemissions. However, environmental\nregulations (and their implementation) were still very weak right after the\npolicy changes. Therefore, heavy polluting sectors, such as electric utilities, gas\nutilities and primary metal, continued to contribute to high growth rates of\npollution emissions and environmental health damage.\nthe area for SO2\npollution charge collection to almost the whole country. Two\nacid rain control zones were designated in southern and south-eastern China. In\naddition, China's coal washing capacity increased significantly from 1996 to 2000,\nover which period annual SO2\nare estimated to have reduced by approximately\n0.18 million ton (Hao et al. 2001). In addition, a series of industrial policies,\n \nTable 5 Summary of the growth rate and contribution of environmental damage\nGrowth rate of environmental\ndamage\nContribution of environmental\ndamage\n \npower sector regulation, and effective environmental policy regulations, especially\ncommand and control policies with requirements for end pipe abatement\ntechnologies, started to play an important role in reducing particulate matters\n. The economy's structural change and shift in the types of energy used\nalso improved technology efficiency of pollution mitigation. This is evident in\nTable 5: for pollution intensive sectors, such as electric utilities and primary\nmetal, the growth rates of environmental damage have dropped by almost\n60 percent. In the chemical industry, the growth rate of damage is even negative.\nIn addition, for the electricity utility sector, the contribution between 1997\nand 2000 is only \u00ad0.2, only one-quarter of that in the other periods. The negative\ncontribution in the primary metal sector also decreased to approximately\none-quarter of its previous contribution. Because of the negative growth rate of\nenvironmental damage, the contribution in the chemical sector even had a\npositive contribution between 1997 and 2000. In contrast, because of the increasing\ndemand for gas usage, for the gas utilities sector, the growth rate of environmental\nFor some modern `high tech' sectors, such as machinery, non-elect sector,\nmotor vehicles, transportation equipment, and instrument, the growth rates of\nenvironmental damage are declining for all three periods. This might be\nbecause of the overall efficiency improvement in the whole decade.\nA new phenomenon of a dramatically rising real estate market appeared in the\nlate 1990s. Therefore, the growth rate and negative contribution of environmental\ndamage in the construction sector increased very quickly, with the rate almost\ntripling. In the stone, clay and glass sector, the growth rate and negative\ncontribution of environmental damage almost doubled as well.\nOne can also see that in the transportation sector, environmental damage also\ntransportation and motor vehicle, as well as the weak environmental policy on\ncontrolling motor vehicle emissions.\nChina's environmental policy implementations concerning small private\nfirms and township and village industrial enterprises (TVIE) were still very\nquickly in the sectors that were primarily composed of small firms, such as food\nproducts, textile mill products, apparel, lumber and wood, furniture and fixtures,\npaper and communications. Most of the sectors in this category seem to have\nwhich might reflect their overall efficiency improvements in the production\nactivities.\nThe calculations in this paper are still very crude, and only health damage\nassociated with air pollution were included. In future studies, other types of\nenvironmental damage, such as water pollution, ecosystem degradation, should\n \nbe incorporated to provide a more complete picture of green productivity in\nChina. However, the proposed new green TFP methodology and empirical study\nin this paper still shed some light on the trends of environmental technological\nefficiency and the effectiveness of air pollution-related environmental policies\nin China's manufacturing sectors.\nVI. Conclusion\nIncreasing environmental damage is threatening China's future sustainable\ndevelopment. It is clear that the Chinese Government must become more con-\ncerned about both economic productivity growth and environmental protection.\nHowever, the conventional TFP method would bias the overall technological\nefficiency estimation and ignore any efficiency changes in emission abatements\nand environmental damages. From a welfare point of view, our study provides\nan unbiased measure, green TFP, for estimating the overall efficiency changes\ncreated through both production technologies and environmental technologies\nand from efficiency improvements through enhanced management.\nongoing economic reform, we found that the overall environment deterioration\nenvironmental regulation implemented in some heavily polluted sectors, such\nas electricity utilities, primary metal and chemical industries. However, the\nenvironmental damage caused by those sectors with many small private firms\nand TVIE continued throughout the whole decade. Driven by the growth in real\nestate and motor vehicle markets, rising environmental damage and negative\ncontributions to green TFP in the construction and transportation sectors are\nposing serious challenges to SEPA and the Chinese Government.\nAlthough this green TFP framework is a very useful tool for measuring\nefficiency changes in terms of environmental technology or management, one\nshould also keep in mind that this method should not replace the conventional\nTFP measures, but only supplement the existing TFP accounting method.\nCurrently, our estimation of China's green TFP is still very crude. Because of\ndata limitations, the present study scope is limited to the measurement of air\npollution-associated health damages in the green TFP framework. Therefore, a\nmore reliable record of productivity growth depends on an adequate informa-\ntion data base regarding all pollutants. This requires the coordination of both\nSEPA and the NBS to coordinate developing an environmental database, for\nproviding more complete and reliable data to explain the past, and to guide\nfuture directions in environmental policy reform.\nReferences\nCao, J., M.
