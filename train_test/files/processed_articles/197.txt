How-\never, the program does not cover some important\ntypes of medical services, including prescription\ndrugs, dental services and most long-term care. Ex-\npenditures for these services, as well as the copay-\nments and deductibles under the Medicare program,\nmay result in significant out-of-pocket expenditures\nfor health care among older Americans. As a result,\nmany have private insurance coverage that supple-\nand older had private insurance coverage (Short,\nEmployers are a major source of private insur-\nance coverage to supplement Medicare. Thirty-five\npercent of the elderly in 1987 were covered by\nemployment-based insurance (Short et al., 1989).\nRetiree health benefits were initially viewed by em-\nployers as an inexpensive benefit as they served\nprimarily to supplement Medicare. However, several\ntrends have made these benefits increasingly expen-\nsive to employers. These include the rapid rise in\nmedical costs, the aging of the work force and the\nChun, Karl Schultz, and especially Patricia St. Clair for their assistance in\npreparing the data, and Barbara Thurston and Robin Grant for their assis-\ntance in the preparation of the manuscript.\n2RAND, Santa Monica, CA.\n3RAND, Washington, DC.

In 1993, the Federal\nAccounting Standards Board (FASB) required firms to\ninclude the present value of their retiree health liabil-\nity as a cost against current earnings since 1993.\nBecause these liabilities were so high and largely\nunfunded, many firms are now considering decreas-\ning the generosity of their post-retirement health\nbenefits.\nPost-retirement health insurance is a form of de-\nferred compensation offered by firms to their work-\ners. There are well known variations in the rate of\noffers of retiree health benefits by industry, with\nemployers in some sectors, such as service indus-\ntries, much less likely to provide these benefits than\nthose in other sectors, such as manufacturing (Karoly\n& Rogowski, 1994). Larger firms are also more likely\nto provide these benefits to their workers than small\nfirms. Most firms have eligibility requirements for\nretiree health benefits. For instance, in a 1991 survey\nof medium and large firms, 35% of firms have a\nservice requirement (e.g., a minimum tenure of em-\nployment) and 32% require that the retiree also qual-\nify for pension benefits (Bureau of Labor Statistics\nFor those elderly who do not have access to health\nbenefits from current or former employers, private\ninsurance to supplement Medicare can be purchased\nin the Medigap market. In 1980, federal legislation\nwas enacted which established minimum require-\nments for these policies after hearings in the late\n1970s made it evident that there were abuses in the\nmarket for supplemental insurance. The legislation,\nknown as the Baucus Amendment, became effective\nin 1982. In addition to imposing minimum benefit\nrequirements, it also prevented policies from exclud-\ning pre-existing conditions for more than 6 months\nand placed minimum limits on the amount of premi-\nums that had to be returned to policyholders in the\nform of benefits (Cafferata, 1985). Recently, the Om-\nnibus Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990 further regu-\nlated the Medigap market, requiring all policies sold\nto conform to one of ten types. All policies contain at\nleast core benefits which include coverage of all Part\nA coinsurance for hospital stays over 60 days, the 20%\npart B coinsurance, and the Parts A and B blood\ndeductible. Prescription drugs are covered under the\nmost comprehensive plans. Dental care is not in-\ncluded in any of the plans. The legislation also raised\nthe loss-ratio requirements and established a six-\nmonth open enrollment period for policy purchase\nPrior studies have shown that the presence of\nsupplemental insurance among the elderly is related\nto sociodemographic and economic characteristics.\nThe presence of private insurance is higher among\nWhites and those with higher incomes and higher\nlevels of education, and decreases with age (Long,\nSettle, & Link, 1982; Carfinkel, Bonito, & McLeroy,\nimportant determinant of private insurance to sup-\nplement Medicare, but the findings with respect to\nhealth status are mixed. Garfinkel et al. (1987), using\ndata from the 1980 National Medical Care Utilization\nand Expenditure Survey (NMCUES) find that, con-\ntrolling for sociodemographic and economic factors,\npersons with chronic conditions are more likely to\nhave supplemental insurance. Rice and McCall\n(1985), using a survey of Medicare beneficiaries in six\nstates, found that elderly persons in poor health\nwere less likely to have supplemental insurance than\npersons in better health. Because private health in-\nsurance among the elderly is obtained from two\nsources, employers and self-purchases, these results\ncombine the effects of various factors on the proba-\nbility of owning these types of policies.\nSeveral studies have addressed the determinants\nof self-purchase of supplemental insurance. Taylor,\nNational Medical Care Expenditures Survey, showed\nthat the probability of self-purchase was also linked\nto sociodemographic and economic characteristics,\nbeing higher for Whites and persons with higher\nincomes. They also found that, controlling for these\nfactors, persons in fair and poor health were much\nless likely to purchase supplemental insurance than\nWaves of the Retirement History Survey, Wolfe and\nCoddeeris (1991) studied elderly persons who were\nretired and neither Medicaid-eligible nor receiving\nhealth benefits fully paid for by an employer or\nunion. Private insurance for these persons was either\nindividually purchased in the Medigap market or was\na retiree health benefit in which the retiree shared in\nthe cost of premiums. They found that, among eco-\nnomic factors, wealth was an important determinant\nof the possession of private insurance.\nIn this article, we study the long-term determi-\nnants of insurance coverage among the elderly using\na new data source, the 1990 Health Supplement to\nthe Panel Study of Income Dynamics. Because much\nof the private health insurance among the elderly\ncomes from employers, we would expect that em-\nployment histories would be an important determi-\nnant of the possession of this type of coverage.\nSimilarly, economic theory suggests that it is perma-\nnent income, as opposed to current income, that\ndrives consumers' purchase decisions.\nAnother important issue with the purchase of in-\nsurance coverage is whether adverse selection oc-\ncurs. Elderly persons in poor health may be more\nlikely to purchase insurance since they anticipate\nhaving higher medical expenditures. The results by\nTaylor et al. (1988) suggest that adverse selection may\nin fact be taking place in the Medigap market. Wolfe\nand Coddeeris (1991) find some evidence of adverse\nselection but conclude that its magnitude is small.\nWe consider the issue of adverse selection by includ-\ning lagged measures of health status as explanatory\nvariables in the insurance purchase equations.\nFinally, because prescription drugs and dental care\nare two important excluded services, we also study\nthe determinants of having coverage for these ser-\nvices. Among elderly persons who use prescription\ndrugs, a large fraction of their cost (67%) is paid for\nout-of-pocket, resulting in an average of 3.1% of\nhousehold income being spent on out-of-pocket ex-\npenses for drugs (Rogowski, Lillard, & Kington,\n1997). Similarly, most dental services are paid for out-\nof-pocket. Among elderly users of dental care, 88%\nof costs are paid for out-of-pocket. This results in\n1.7% of household income being spent on dental\ncare (Kington, Rogowski, & Lillard, 1995). Thus, pri-\nvate insurance coverage for these uncovered ser-\nvices could significantly decrease out-of-pocket ex-\npenditures by elderly households.\nWe use the Panel Study of Income Dynamics\n(PSID) to study the patterns of insurance coverage\nwithin the Medicare population. The PSID data we\nuse contains longitudinal history on elderly respon-\ndents for 22 years. It is thus possible to measure\nemployment histories, prior health status, and per-\nmanent income. In 1990, the PSID was supplemented\nwith a survey of elderly respondents regarding their\nhealth insurance and health care expenditures.\nThese two data sources permit the examination of\nthe effect of long-term factors on the presence of\nsupplemental insurance among the elderly.\nMethods\nData\nThis study uses longitudinal data from the Panel\nwork history, health history, and family demography\ncombined with newly available information on insur-\nance coverage and health status collected for elderly\nrespondents as part of the 1990 wave to study the\nlong-term determinants of supplemental insurance\ncoverage.\nThe PSID is a nationally representative (weighted)\nlongitudinal survey of households conducted by the\nSurvey Research Center at the University of Michi-\ngan. Since 1968 the PSID has followed and inter-\nviewed annually a sample that began with about\n5,000 families, collecting information about the origi-\nnal sample of respondents and members of their\nhouseholds. The core survey collects detailed infor-\nmation on income, work, unemployment, use of\npublic programs, demographic information, and\nsome measures of health and disability. Early waves\nof the PSID collected information primarily on the\nemployment histories of household heads. In the\n1976 PSID, retrospective histories were obtained for\nall spouses of heads of household in the survey, thus\nproviding data for spouses that are nearly compatible\nto that of heads of household. In 1990 the PSID data\nwas supplemented to collect detailed information on\nhealth status, insurance, and health care costs of the\nelderly. Information on health status and insurance\ncoverage were obtained in a mail-in survey. The\nresponse rate to the mail-in survey was 74%. Com-\nbined with the 22-year panel of information in the\ncore, it is possible to study the long-term determi-\nnants of insurance coverage in the elderly.\nOur analyses include 763 households for which\neither the head or spouse is sixty-six or older and\ncomplete data are available for insurance coverage,\nwork history and lagged health. Of these, 193 are\nmarried couples for whom the health and insurance\ndata are available for both spouses; there are thus\nwomen. Selected socioeconomic characteristics of\nindividuals in the sample are reported in Table 1. A\nsmall number of individuals who were known to be\nresidents of nursing homes and not living in the\nhousehold were dropped from the analyses, but\ntheir core PSID data were used in the creation of\nvariables such as spousal employment history. Analy-\nses are weighted to reflect (a) the original 1968 sam-\npling weights for households, (b) panel attrition be-\n1990 mail-in survey. The procedure to develop\nweights to correct for nonresponse follows that re-\nported in the PSID User's Guide, except that logit\nrather than CART probabilities are used.\nAnalytic Measures\nInsurance Coverage. -- We have assumed that all\nindividuals in this sample are insured by Medicare\nage 65 and older were covered by Medicare (Levitt,\nOlin, & Letsch, 1992). The percentage in this sample\nis probably even higher than in the general popula-\ntion because the original 1968 PSID panel under-\nrepresents immigrants, who are more likely not to\nqualify for Medicare.

All sample persons\nsurvey were asked the insurance questions, includ-\ning whether insurance covers the spouse, so that\ndata on insurance coverage for almost all spouse\npairs are complete. Since insurance coverage is al-\nmost identical for matched men and women in mar-\nried couples in the PSID, in the multivariate analyses\nwe use a couple-based (household) measure of in-\nsurance coverage for married couples and an\nindividual-based measure for unmarried men and\nwomen. There were a few inconsistencies in the\nreports of husbands and wives about who is covered.\nIn these cases, we indicated coverage if either\nspouse reported coverage, assuming a more knowl-\nedgeable spouse would know.\nWork History. -- Employment history is a poten-\ntially important determinant of insurance coverage\nthrough its effect on health insurance provided by\nemployers. The long history of employment and\nwork information available in the PSID allows us to\nconstruct detailed measures based on twenty-three\nyears (waves) of panel data. Our measures focus on\nthe characteristics of the last job before first re-\ntirement, or the current job if never retired, and\ninclude (a) years of tenure with that employer, and\n(b) indicator variables for aggregated occupation\ngroups on that job. These variables are thought to\ninfluence the probability of post-retirement health\nplan coverage. The last job was determined by first\nidentifying the first survey year in which an individ-\nual reported himself or herself to be retired. The last\njob was then defined as the last identified job prior\nto that survey year.\nWe use occupational groupings that were predic-\ntive of employer-provided insurance, with different\naggregates for men and for women. We first esti-\nmated each model by gender with indicators for each\nof the occupational groups. We then collapsed all\noccupational groups with significant coefficients into\na single category by gender, resulting in different\ngroups of occupational category indicators for men\nand women. For men the occupational group indi-\ncated by the variable in the models includes self-\nemployed businessmen, operatives and kindred\nworkers, laborers and service workers, and farmers,\nfarm managers, and farm laborers, relative to all\nother occupations. For women the occupational\ngroup indicated by the variable in the models in-\ncludes professional, technical, and kindred workers,\nand managers, officials and proprietors, relative to\nall other occupations.\nFor unmarried men we use their own work history.\nFor married couples we include the work histories of\nboth the male head of household and of the wife. For\nunmarried women, we use her own work history and\nthe work history of her former husband if she is\nwidowed within the panel period.\nThe distributions of years of tenure and occupa-\ntional group indicators are presented in Table 2 for\nmen and women in the sample. Women tended to\nhave shorter periods of tenure with the last em-\nployer, and about half of the women were included\nin the miscellaneous occupational category includ-\ning self-employed and housewives.\nEconomic Factors. -- Wealth is measured in the\n1989 Wealth Supplement to the PSID and represents\ntotal wealth for the couple or individual if single,\nincluding housing. Permanent income is based on\nthe detailed longitudinal income histories in the\nPSID, and represents the average income for the\ncouple or individual if single during the past five\nyears prior to 1990. The mean weighted household\nwealth and permanent income for the sample of\nindividuals (n = 956) and standard deviations (SD in\nvalues are presented in Table 1. We include in the\nestimation equations log values of all positive wealth\nestimates, with negative and zero values set equal to\nzero. Based on evidence that respondents who fail to\nprovide wealth data may be different from other\nrespondents, we have also added to each model that\nincludes the wealth variable a dummy variable indi-\ncating that the wealth data were missing for that\nobservation and imputed with the sample mean. In\nseveral equations, the coefficient for this variable\nwas significant. Data on the urbanicity of the location\ncome from the Area Resource File of the Department\nof Health and Human Services. The variable mea-\nsures the percent of the county population that re-\nsides in an urban area.\nLagged Health Status. -- We include several mea-\nsures of lagged health status. First, we include varia-\nbles indicating the presence of seven common\nchronic conditions that were reported in the 1990\nHealth Supplement to have been present for at least\nfive years. These conditions are (mean weighted\nprevalence for sample of individuals in parentheses):\narthritis (.37), congestive heart failure (.08), angina\nand hypertension (.32).\nWe also included a mean of three years of self-\nreported general health status as measured by an\nindex of general health based on an ordinal five-\nTable 2.

The question in each year was: Would you\nsay your health in general is excellent (5), very good\n(4), good (3), fair (2), or poor (1)? The lagged general\nhealth measure is an average value of these ordinal\nreports with a higher score indicating better health.\nThe weighted mean value for this measure in the\ntotal sample of male and female individual respon-\nFinally, we included an index based on a series of\nquestions on functional status asked in the 1986\nsurvey. Individuals reported limitations in each of\nthe following activities due to health: limitations\nwalking several blocks or climbing a few flights of\nstairs; limitations bending, lifting, or stooping; limi-\ntations driving a car; requiring assistance traveling\naround the community; staying indoors most or all\nof the day; and confined to bed or chair most or all of\nthe day. A simple count of these restrictions was\ndetermined for each individual with a higher score\n(indicating worse function). The mean score for the\nlagged functional status measure in the total sample\nof male and female individual respondents were,\nFor both the lagged general health measure and\nthe lagged functional status measure, for insurance\nequations in which the unit of analysis is a household\n(n = 763) both measures were entered separately by\ngender for heads and spouses in the households. For\nchronic conditions, a condition was present if either\nspouse in the household reported the condition. For\nhouseholds with only a head and no spouse, the\nhead's lagged general health, functional status, and\nchronic condition measures were used.\nModeling Insurance Coverage\nOur model includes equations for four aspects of\nhealth insurance coverage. The four health insur-\nance equations estimated the probability of report-\ning: (a) employer-provided health insurance, (b)\nprivately-purchased health insurance, given no\nemployer-provided coverage, (c) health insurance\ncovers prescription drugs, given insurance coverage,\nand (d) health insurance covers dental, given insur-\nance coverage. We consider the model for each of\nthese relationships in turn, including their inter-\nrelationships. We use a probit formulation so that\neach of the four binary outcomes is determined by a\nprobit index function.\nEmployer-Provided Health Insurance Coverage. --\nFor each household in the sample we consider\nwhether the couple or person has employer-\nprovided health insurance, which is denoted by a\nbinary indicator EHj. The probit index function deter-\nmining coverage is given by:\neh, -0,0 + <*vK + aJjEMP, + uv\nThe household is covered if the index is positive,\nand zero otherwise, i.e.:\nkM'~\nExplanatory variables included in vector X are edu-\ncation, race, and age of the head of household,\nmarital status and female headship if unmarried.\nEconomic factors include household income and\nhousehold wealth. The measures of employment\nhistory constructed using the long history of the\nPSID panel are indicated by vector the EMP. These\ninclude job tenure and occupation on the last job\nbefore retirement, but the men's and women's occu-\npational aggregates are different. For unmarried men\nthe equation includes his last tenure and occupation.\nFor unmarried women the equation includes her last\ntenure and occupation. If the observation is for a\ncouple either currently married or for a woman wid-\nowed within the PSID panel period, both the hus-\nband's and wife's work history variables are in-\ncluded. We hypothesize that employment histories\nwill be important determinants of employer-\nprovided coverage because employer offers of post-\nretirement health benefits vary by industry and many\nemployers who do offer benefits have service re-\nquirements. The equations also include a variable for\nmarital status to account for any shift due to there\nbeing two persons rather than one.\nSelf-Purchased Health Insurance Coverage. --\nGiven that the person does not have employer-\nprovided insurance {EH, = 0), the person has self-\npurchased (Medigap) health insurance if\n,X, +\nis positive, and zero otherwise, i.e.:\nMifsp/ifX)\nThe decision-making model is then sequential pro-\nbit, since a household purchases private health cov-\nerage only if not covered by an employer policy.\nThe purchase of private insurance coverage is\nmodeled as a function of economic, sociodemo-\ngraphic, and health factors including education,\nrace, and age of the head of household, marital\nstatus and female headship if unmarried, and mea-\nsures of wealth, permanent income, and urbanicity\nof the residential location for the household.\nWe are interested in determining whether there is\nadverse selection into privately-purchased policies.\nTo this end, we include the measures of lagged\ngeneral health status and functional status and the\nlagged presence of common chronic conditions\n(vector Y). The decision to purchase insurance is\nmade prior to the date at which elderly respondents\nwere surveyed. Because of the longitudinal nature\nof the data used for the study, it is possible to ob-\nserve health status for five years prior to the inter-\nview window. If there is adverse selection into\nindividually-purchased policies, we would expect\nthe purchase of these policies to be positively associ-\nated with lagged measures of poor health.\nThe probit equations for employer-provided and\nfor privately purchased health insurance coverage\nmay not be independent; there may be unobserved\nfactors which influence both, so that not having\nemployer insurance is not a random selection with\nrespect to private insurance purchase. We tested for\ncorrelation between the two probit equations and\ncould not reject independence.\nWhether Health Insurance Coverage Includes Pre-\nscription Drugs. -- Given that the person has health\ninsurance coverage (EH, = 1 or SPH, = 1), the person\nhas coverage for prescription drugs if\n/\n,\nis positive, and zero otherwise, i.e.:\n_ p if drg? >0\n_\nOne of the key variables explaining coverage of pre-\nscription drugs is expected to be whether health\ninsurance is employer-provided or self-purchased.\nThere is evidence that few individually purchased\npolicies contain prescription drug benefits. A study\nby Long (1994) found that among privately purchased\npolicies, only 19% covered prescription drugs. This\ncompared to 92% of employer-provided policies.\nEmployer policies typically provide the same benefits\nto retirees as to active workers and thus tend to cover\nprescription drugs. We hypothesize that the majority\nof prescription drug coverage will be associated with\nthe source of coverage being an employer.\nWhether Health Insurance Coverage Includes Den-\ntal Care. -- Given that the person has health insur-\nance coverage (EH, = 1 or SPH, = 1), the person has\ncoverage for dental care if\nden? = a\u00ab + ai1\nX/\n/\n,\nis positive, and zero otherwise, i.e.:\nMifc/en*>0\n= i\nOne of the key variables explaining coverage of den-\ntal services is also expected to be whether health\ninsurance is employer-provided or self-purchased.\nFew elderly persons (13%) have insurance coverage\nfor dental services (Kington et al., 1995).

The table illustrates the\ndistinctive patterns of insurance coverage among de-\nmographic groups. In general, older persons, less\neducated persons, and women were less likely to\nhave any supplemental coverage and less likely to\nhave employer-provided coverage, and older persons\nwere less likely to have either dental or drug cover-\nage. The pattern for Blacks compared to non-Blacks\nwas particularly noteworthy. Blacks were almost half\nas likely to report any supplemental insurance com-\npared to non-Blacks, but if they reported any supple-\nmental coverage, they were almost 75% more likely to\nreport employer-provided coverage. Although higher\npercentages of Blacks reported both dental and drug\ncoverage, only the difference in dental coverage\nreached marginal statistical significance.\nThe following three tables (Table 4-6) present the\ncoefficients and standard errors for a series of probit\nequations that provide insights into underlying rela-\ntionships that might explain some of the patterns\nobserved in Table 3.\nEmployer-provided Insurance\nEstimates of the parameters of the employer-\nprovided insurance equation are presented in Table\n4.

While per-\nmanent income does not have an effect on the pur-\nchase decision, wealth does have a significant effect.\nThese findings are consistent with the hypothesis\nthat wealth may be a better measure of financial\nresources than permanent income in this population\n(Hurd, 1989). Female household heads and blacks\nare less likely to obtain self-purchased insurance,\nand elderly persons living in more urbanized areas\nare more likely to purchase insurance. Households\nheaded by less educated persons are also much less\nlikely to purchase a private policy. Taking these\nresults in combination with the results for employer\ninsurance, the households headed by less educated\npersons are much less likely to have any private\nhealth insurance overall.

Standard errors in ( ); Significance (Ho\nin the demand for medical care is related to the\npotential effects of lagged health on the decision to\nobtain self-purchased health insurance, since cur-\nrent and lagged health status are correlated. The\neffects of the lagged general health index, functional\nstatus, and chronic conditions on the probability of\nhaving self-purchased supplemental health insur-\nance are reported in Table 5. Lagged general health\nand lagged functional status had no effect. Similarly,\nthe presence of most common chronic conditions in\neither a head of household or spouse had no effect\nwith the exceptions of having had an ulcer or diabe-\ntes five years or more. About 6% in this population\nhad had an ulcer that long and about 7% had had\ndiabetes that long. The Baucus Amendment, which\nwas in effect during the study period, did not permit\npolicies to exclude pre-existing conditions for more\nthan 6 months. Thus, the results presented here are\nlikely to be demand effects as opposed to supply\neffects. These results suggest that there is relatively\nlittle adverse selection in the self-purchase of private\nsupplemental insurance.\nCoverage for Prescription Drugs and Dental Services\nTable 6 presents coefficients for probits predicting\ndrug and dental coverage with and without the\nlagged health variables. For those who do have a\nprivate health insurance policy, by far the strongest\nand most significant determinant of coverage of ei-\nther prescription drugs or of dental services is\nwhether the policy is employer-provided. These\nresults are consistent with the fact that many employ-\ners structure their retiree health benefit plans to\nmirror benefits provided to active workers.\nNet of the effects of the insurance being employer-\nprovided, elderly persons living in urban areas are\nmore likely to have prescription drug coverage. The\nresults for education in the equations for drug cover-\nage were somewhat surprising. For unclear reasons,\npersons with less than college education were more\nlikely to report drug coverage. For both dental and\ndrug coverage, men with better lagged general\nhealth were more likely to report coverage, and\nhouseholds with hypertension were less likely to\nreport dental coverage.\nDiscussion\nThis study takes advantage of the unique longitudi-\nnal employment histories and the supplemental\nhealth and insurance data of the PSID to demonstrate\nthe importance of several dimensions of long-term\nemployment patterns in determining the patterns of\nhealth insurance coverage among older adults. Pri-\nvate insurance among elderly persons derives from\ntwo primary sources -- employers and self-purchase\nof insurance in the Medigap market. For elderly\npersons who purchase insurance in the Medigap\nmarket, the decision to purchase is related to socio-\ndemographic and economic factors. There are large\nracial differences in the probability of insurance pur-\nchase. Controlling for income and other factors\nknown to affect insurance purchase, Blacks are less\nlikely to buy these policies than Whites. Female\nhousehold heads and elderly persons with lower\neducational levels are also less likely to purchase\ninsurance. The purchase of insurance coverage is not\nrelated to permanent income but instead to wealth.\nThis is consistent with the findings of Wolfe and\nGoddeeris (1991) and with the observation by Hurd\n(1989), that wealth may be a better overall measure of\nfinancial resources for the elderly.\nElderly persons who are in poor health may be\nmore likely to purchase private supplemental poli-\ncies, as they attempt to insure against future high\nmedical expenses. The prior literature has been in-\nconclusive about the effect of health status on the\nlikelihood of having private insurance in old age. We\nfind relatively little evidence in support of adverse\nselection being an important factor in the purchase\nof insurance in older populations. Neither a lagged\ngeneral measure of health nor a lagged general mea-\nsure of functional status nor the presence of most\ncommon chronic conditions for at least five years are\nsignificantly related to the purchase of private insur-\nance. The only evidence was the finding that the\npresence of ulcers or diabetes for more than five\nyears in a head or spouse was predictive of a lower\nprobability of purchasing insurance. Since the\nBaucus Amendment, which was in effect during our\nstudy period, prohibited Medigap policies from ex-\ncluding pre-existing conditions for more than six\nmonths, this effect is likely driven by the demand\nside of the market rather than the supply side.\nPerhaps our most important finding concerns the\nrelationship between several dimensions of long-\nterm employment patterns and insurance. Employ-\ners are an important source of private insurance\ncoverage for the elderly, as they are for younger\npopulations. The primary determinant of having cov-\nerage through an employer even in this age group is\nwork history, including both tenure and specific oc-\ncupational categories. The fact that employer insur-\nance coverage varies by current or former occupa-\ntion is consistent with the fact that firm offers of\npostretirement insurance coverage vary by industry.\nIndustries with high rates of health insurance offers\nto active workers, such as manufacturing, also have\nhigh rates of retiree health benefit offers. Those with\nlow rates of health benefits to active workers, such as\nthe service industries, also have low rates of retiree\nhealth offers (Karoly & Rogowski, 1994). The receipt\nof insurance through a current or former employer\nalso decreases with age, probably due to the de-\ncrease in the number of active workers with age as\nwell as the lower likelihood that retiree health bene-\nfits were an employment benefit for older cohorts of\nworkers.\nEducation also proved to be a consistent important\npredictor of coverage. Controlling for work history,\npersons with lower educational levels are less likely\nto have insurance through an employer. Combined\nwith the fact that less educated persons are also less\nlikely to purchase insurance, this results in lower\nrates of private insurance coverage for this segment\nof the elderly population. For those who do have a\nprivate health insurance policy, by far the strongest\nand most significant determinant of coverage of ei-\nther prescription drugs or of dental services, two\nservices not covered by Medicare, is whether the\npolicy is employer-provided -- employer policies are\nmuch more likely to cover drugs or dental services.\nThe evidence presented in this study suggests that\nemployment histories are the most important long-\nterm determinants of private insurance coverage\namong the elderly, and this finding may have impor-\ntant implications for future patterns of health insur-\nance coverage among the elderly population. Since\nemployers are now decreasing the generosity of\ntheir retiree health benefit offers, it is likely that\nfuture cohorts of the elderly will have to rely increas-\ningly on the Medigap market for insurance coverage.\nAs a result, fewer will have coverage for such ex-\ncluded services as prescription drugs and dental\ncare, which can result in significant out-of-pocket\nexpenses for elderly households. These changes in\npatterns of coverage may lead to an increase in the\nfinancial burden associated with medical expenses\namong older persons, most of whom live on fixed\nincomes.\nReferences\nBureau of Labor Statistics.
