    "abstract": "Abstract\nFew studies address Serbian providers' perceptions of informal payments and the association between these perceptions\nand health system governance. The aim was to investigate civil servants' perceptions on informal payments of the health care\nsystem in Serbia and to link these results with available evidence on informal payments in other Western Balkan countries. A\nliterature review on informal payments in Western Balkan and in-depth interviews of civil servants working with Serbian health\ncare were conducted. Informal payments were mostly taking place in inpatient care and were based on low salaries of doctors,\npoor resources, a desire to receive better or faster service, fear of being denied treatment, and an expression of gratitude\nthrough gifts. Policy measures had limited effect and vulnerable groups were more likely to pay informally. There is a need for\nfurther research to highlight how health system governance and prevailing policies affect informal payments in Western Balkan.\n",

To become an EU member, the\ncandidate countries must agree to certain values and princi-\nples regarding health systems, for example, the main focus\nshould be put on primary health care (Council of the EU,\n2007). The countries must also commit themselves to the\nEuropean policies and strategies for enhancing population\nhealth, for instance, the \"Europe 2020\" strategy (European\nEU membership, and in 2012, the country was granted a can-\ndidate status. Negotiations for membership began in January\nTo commit to the context of EU integration and its common\nvalues and principles, Serbia reformed its health care sector\nafter the overthrow of the Yugoslavian government in 2000\n(Simic, Marinkovic, & Boulton, 2012). Some of the challenges\nSerbia faces after the reform are (a) high referral rates from\ngeneral practitioners to specialists, (b) a perception that special-\nists provide high quality care (World Health Organization\n[WHO], 2010), (c) weak contributions to the Health Insurance\nFund by public enterprises experiencing economic difficulties,\nand (d) a deficit in funding for the health system (Simic et al.,\n2012). The poor funding has lowered the quality of services,\ncreating long waiting lists and lowering the quality of health\ncare equipment and facilities (Karajicic & Muzik, 2014). In\naddition, the primary care system suffers from inadequate skills\nand competencies and the low economic and social status of\nhealth professionals (Simic et al., 2012).\nThe services of general practitioners are often seen as\nobsolete, and when they provide easy access to specialists, it\nis perceived as high quality health care (Simic et al., 2012).\nBecause general practitioners are the gatekeepers to special-\nists or secondary care, informal payments may exist to facili-\ntate access to these services (Simic et al., 2012). Today, the\nhealth care system in Serbia is characterized by a universal\nhealth coverage system that is both publicly financed and\npublicly provided. Private insurance can also be obtained to\nreceive quicker access and enhanced consumer choice.\nThese, however, are not included in the public insurance\nIn 2015, the Euro Health Consumer Index (Health\nConsumer Powerhouse, 2015) compared the performance of\nhealth care systems in 35 European countries based on 48\nindicators. The Index ranked the Serbian health system as the\n30th among these countries. One explanation of such perfor-\nmance could be drawn from Transparency International's\n(TI; 2015) Corruption Perception Index, which ranked Serbia\nas 78 out of 177 countries worldwide in terms of its level of\ncorruption. This is an overall perception of corruption and\nincludes not only health care but all public sectors in Serbia.\nAccording to the United Nations Office of Drug and Crime\n1University of Southern Denmark, Esbjerg, Denmark\nCorresponding Author:\nSofie Buch Mejsner, Unit for Health Promotion, University of Southern\nEmail: sofieditte85@gmail.com\nInformal Payments and Health System\nGovernance in Serbia: A Pilot Study\nSofie Buch Mejsner1 and Leena Eklund Karlsson1\n Keywords\ninformal payments, health system governance, Western Balkan, content analysis, literature review\n2 SAGE Open\n(UNODC; 2011), there are notable variations in bribes\nbetween the Western Balkan countries. In this article, bribes\nare understood as giving, receiving, or offering goods or ser-\nvices to influence the actions of an official. Informal pay-\nments are, therefore, understood as a form of bribery. In\nSerbia, almost 14% of citizens at age 18 to 64 reported that\nthey had directly or indirectly experienced bribery during the\nstudy period. Although there were variations between the\nregions of Serbia, 9% of the interviewees had paid at least\none bribe during that period. In 56% of the cases, the citizen\noffers to pay, and in 14% of the cases, they are asked to make\nbribes to the public administration staff (UNODC, 2011).\nAccording to several studies (International Federation for\nzens of Serbia believed that health was the most corrupt sec-\ntor. UNODC (2011) found that one in three Serbian citizens\nwho participate in any type of bribery do so to receive better\nservice and one in five to speed up the service. Medical doc-\ntors are one of the groups of public officials that receive the\nmost bribes. In the present study, these illegitimate bribes are\nreferred to as informal payments. The concept of informal\npayments also includes gratitude gifts. In this study, the term\n\"informal payments\" will, therefore, include both gratitude\ngifts and bribery.\nSeveral studies (Avdyli, 2010; Colombini, Rechel, &\nNekoeimoghadam, Esfandiari, Ramezani, & Amiresmaili,\n2013) show that informal payments have negative effects on\nhealth care access, equity, and population health. WHO\n(2000) claimed that any demand for out-of-pocket payment\n(formal and informal payment for health services) will lead\nconsumers to reduce their use of health services. This may\nhurt particularly the poor by limiting their access to health\nservices. Lewis (2007) claimed that informal payments\nsometimes exist alongside formal payments, and a distinc-\ntion between these is difficult, which undermines the report-\ning of informal payments. Therefore, informal payments\nmay cause inequity in the sense that they can impoverish\nsome groups of society, whereas groups with greater\nresources receive better quality of care. Consequently, the\nfinancing of the health system determines the burden of\nhealth care payments in society and the level of protecting\npoorer groups from further poverty (financial risk protec-\nInformal payments indicate poor health system gover-\nnance as they are linked to a lack of control and accountabil-\nity in health care and weak rule of law (Gaal & McKee,\n2005). In addition, information about the existence of infor-\nmal payments in Serbia is scattered, and there is a poor over-\nview of informal payments and their consequences on the\nSerbian health care system. To identify future research focus,\nthis exploratory study aimed to investigate Serbian civil ser-\nvants' (government officials, that is, doctors working in the\nhealth care system) perceptions on informal payments of the\nhealth care system (Gaal & McKee, 2004; Greer, Wismar, &\ncountry (Serbia) was selected for the empirical data collec-\ntion. Only little evidence about the topic regarding Serbia\nwas available. Knowledge based on existing literature from\nother Western Balkan countries completed the results\n(excluding Macedonia because no such study fulfilled the\ninclusion criteria of the literature review).\nDefinition of Concepts and Theoretical\nFramework\nA variety of professions have acknowledged the existence of\ninformal payments in health care. However, there are sub-\nstantial differences in the definition of the concept and no\ndefinition covering the various aspects of informal payments\nis available (Chereche, Ungureanu, Sandu, & Rus, 2013.\nVian (2008) argued that one of the fundamental issues that\nillustrate this conceptual confusion is the uncertain differen-\ntiation between gifts and bribes in health care. One perspec-\ntive features cultural aspects and sees informal payments as\nan expression of gratitude, whereas another includes feeling\ncompelled to make unofficial payments to receive higher\nquality care. These payments vary from flowers, sweets,\nsmall tips, or large sums of cash (Gaal, Belli, Mckee, &\nSz\u00f3cska, 2006). As concluded in the systematic review of\nGaal et al. (2006) is the best yet available. Despite its limita-\ntions toward solely considering informal payments as an\nadditional payment on top of any formal out-of-pocket pay-\nment (Chereche et al., 2013), the present study will take\ninspiration from the definition described as\na direct contribution, which is made in addition to any\ncontribution determined by the terms of entitlement, in cash or\nin-kind, by patients or others, acting on their behalf, to health\ncare providers for services that the patients are entitled to.\nPolese (2014) argued that there is a blurred line between gifts\nand bribes in that they depend largely on the context and\nlong-term relationships that maybe generated from both gifts\nand bribes. Balabanova and McKee (2002) also doubted\nwhether gratitude gifts exist in health care, as any payment\nfavors the payer in obtaining preferential access to care.\nLiaropoulos, Siskou, Kaitelidou, Theodorou, and Katostaras\n(2008) showed that only one fifth of the respondents paid out\nof gratitude, whereas nearly half of the respondents did so\nout of fear of otherwise receiving lower quality care. One of\nthose proposing a conceptualization of informal payments as\nan unregulated fee is WHO (2000), suggesting to define\ninformal payments as an act of corruption (i.e., bribery).\nGaal and McKee (2004) attempted to explain informal\npayments through a theory that takes its starting point from\nHirschman's (1970) work on \"Exit, Voice, and Loyalty.\" The\ntheory attempts to analyze peoples' reactions to a decline in\norganizations and states, which leave consumers (patients)\nBuch Mejsner and Eklund Karlsson 3\nand employees (doctors) unsatisfied. In this case, consumers\nand employees would either leave the organization (Exit) or\ncomplain to available channels (Voice). The latter option\nassumes \"Loyalty\" to the organization, as voice is usually\nless effective and more risky (Gaal & McKee, 2004).\nRegarding informal payments, other characteristics of Exit\nand Voice are present insofar as dissatisfied people do not\ncomplain (Voice) or leave the organization (Exit) but seek\nchange through informal methods such as payments or con-\nnections. The latter resemble an internal/informal Exit, hence\nthe term INXIT (Gaal & McKee, 2004). The theory explains\nsome possible reactions from patients and doctors when\nunsatisfied with the organization of health care. Lewis (2007)\nand Gaal and McKee (2005) emphasized that informal pay-\nments are symptoms of poor management, underfunding,\npoor control in health care, lack of accountability, and defi-\ncits in rule of law, that is, poor governance. Informal pay-\nments consequently appear to be linked to governance in\nhealth care, leading public and private spending in health\nVian (2008) illustrated the reasons and opportunities for\ninformal payments and suggested that civil servants abusing\npublic position and power for private gain do so because they\nfeel pressured to abuse, because they are able to rationalize\ntheir behavior (e.g., individuals' beliefs, attitudes, and social\nnorms influence informal payments, and to some individu-\nals, it may therefore be morally acceptable to give civil ser-\nvants money or gifts), or because they have the opportunity\nto abuse. Civil servants often act in a manner that maximizes\ntheir self-interest, weighing the costs and benefits of acting\ncorruptly against acting with integrity (Vian, 2008). The\nopportunities to act corruptly are influenced by six factors:\nmonopoly, which creates opportunities for informal pay-\nments by limiting the ability of citizens to choose other ser-\nvice providers; discretion, referring to the autonomous power\nof civil servants to make decisions; accountability, which is\ngovernments' obligation to demonstrate effectiveness in\nreducing informal payments; citizen voice, representing the\nchannels and means for active participation by stakeholders;\ntransparency, referring to the active disclosure of informa-\ntion relating to decision making and performance measures;\nand enforcement, which is the collection of evidence of\ninformal payments and the punishment of those engaging in\nsuch acts (Vian, 2008). These six factors are important in\ncapturing informal payments and should be considered in\nstrategies to tackle these.\nMethod\nEmpirical Part\nSampling.A purposive nonprobability sampling was per-\nformed (Bryman, 2008) meaning that individuals who were\nappropriate for answering the research questions were\napproached. The participants were expected to be educated\nwithin the health care field (i.e., doctor, nurse, nursing assis-\ntant) and fluent in English (due to the feasibility of the study\nit was not possible to include translators or other interna-\ntional or local researchers). Online websites were searched to\nfind participants at national and regional public health insti-\ntutions and primary care centers in Belgrade and Vojvodina.\nThe participants were sent an email, asking them to partici-\npate. The online selection of participants was necessary due\nto lacking network in the area and was a less time-consuming\napproach. Primary care centers were chosen, as they are pub-\nlic institutions where informal payments have been claimed\nto take place (Simic et al., 2012). The Public Health Insti-\ntutes in Belgrade and Vojvodina were selected, as they do\nresearch on population health and on performance and func-\ntioning of the health care system. Other institutions such as\nthe National Health Insurance Fund and the Ministry of\nHealth were not included due to difficulties in locating con-\ntact information on specific officials through the Internet.\nNetworking would have been an appropriate approach for\nlocating these officials, though time constraints made this\nunrealistic.\nIn Vojvodina, centers in the municipalities and cities of\nNovi Sad, Sombor, Pancevo, Zrenjanin, Kikinda, Subotica,\nVrsac, and Sremska Mitrovica were contacted. In Belgrade,\ncenters were contacted in the municipalities of Barajevo,\nCukarica, Grocka, Lazarevac, Mladenovac, Novi Beograd,\nObrenovac, Palilula, Rakovica, Savski Venac, Sopot, Stari\nGrad, Surcin, Vozdovac, Vracar, Zemun, and Zvezdara. Four\nparticipants from the Public Health Institute in Novi Sad and\na primary care facility in Stari Grad agreed to participate.\nData collection and study participants. The data collection was\nconducted in Belgrade and Vojvodina in the first week of\nAugust 2014. The data consisted of two semistructured group\ninterviews on-site and one follow-up interview through\nSkype (n = 4). Participants of the first interview were two\npublic health officials from Novi Sad (Vojvodina) and those\nin the second interview were two health care providers from\nBelgrade. The Skype interview was with one of the public\nhealth official from Novi Sad. The participants were female,\nmedical doctors, or specialists in social medicine and aged\nbetween 30 to 60 years. They worked as department heads at\nan institute of public health or as employees in a primary care\ncenter. The respondents of the on-site interviews were paired\n(two respondents in each interview) so that they could also\nassist each other with language difficulties, despite speaking\nfluent English, and to create better flow.\nInterview guide and conducting the interviews. The interview\nguide included questions on the respondents' beliefs about\ninformal payments and their views on the health care sys-\ntem and its governance, the functioning of the center, coor-\ndination between secondary and tertiary care, and service\ndelivery. The questions were based on Vian's (2008) frame-\nwork, theory on trust derived from the study of Aasland,\n4 SAGE Open\nGr\u00f8deland, and Pleines (2012). The themes of the guide\nwere \"perceptions on health care,\" \"corruption in the health\nsector,\" \"informal networks,\" \"trust,\" and \"equity.\" The\ninterview guide was pilot tested and revised twice before\nthe actual interviews. The interviews, conducted in English\nand recorded on a dictaphone, lasted approximately 1 hr.\nThe interviews were transcribed verbatim into Microsoft\nWord. Transcripts of the interviews were returned to the\nrespondents to confirm their statements and to allow them\nto add additional comments.\nData analysis method.The phenomenological hermeneutical\napproach adopted from Lindseth and Norberg (2004) was used\nto inductively develop emerging themes. To understand the\ninterviewees'approach to informal payments, it was necessary\nto first apply this method to investigate their common percep-\ntions of the term. To grasp the meaning as a whole, the text\nwas read through several times, and an overall understanding\nof the data was formulated. In Lindseth and Norberg's (2004)\nmethodological description, this is called a na\u00efve understand-\ning. This understanding guides the next steps in the analysis\nand must be validated through reading literature. The vali-\ndated understanding then further guides the subsequent the-\nmatic structural analysis, where themes were identified in the\ntext and separated into units of meaning. These units consisted\nof the respondents' quotations and were marked with the\nrespondent's participant number. The units of meaning were\nprinted out on paper to better manage the material and to iden-\ntify sections and quotations that were similar and thus formed\na pattern. Subsequently, these units of meaning were reflected\nagainst the validated na\u00efve understanding, condensed into\nneutral summaries, and abstracted into main themes and sub-\nthemes. After this categorization, the themes were once again\nreflected on, reorganized, and sorted into final themes and\nsubthemes. Finally, the findings from the data analysis were\nsent to the participants for feedback.\nEthical considerations.An application for ethical approval\nwas sent to the Ethical Committee at the Institute of Public\nHealth of Serbia including the informed consent form, the\nstudy protocol, and an explanation of the interview process\nand the interview guide. The Institute of Public Health of\nDespite applying for the Ethical clearance in a timely man-\nner, it was not possible to receive the final approval before\nconducting the interviews. Nevertheless, the researchers cor-\nresponded with a member of the committee during July\n2014, confirming the approval of the initial qualitative study,\nwith minor revisions. Before conducting the interviews, an\ninformed consent form was signed by the participants.\nLiterature Review\nA literature review was completed to complement the quali-\ntative data. An initial literature review was also conducted\nbefore the qualitative study, among other things, to narrow\nthe study of informal payments to only one country (Serbia).\nThe following literature review was focused on health sys-\ntem governance and informal payments in all Western Balkan\ncountries to get a broader view on informal payments in the\narea. The aim was to answer to the following question: What\nexisting evidence is available on informal payments and how\ndispersed are informal payments in Western Balkan?\nInclusion and exclusion of studies and search strategy.Inclusion\nand exclusion of studies was completed in an iterative man-\nner, where search terms were redefined when becoming\nfamiliar with the literature. In assuring the comprehensive-\nness of evidence, the steps of phrasing the research question\nand searching and selecting relevant published and gray lit-\nerature were repeated. The three overall search terms \"Health\nSystems Governance,\" \"Western Balkan,\" and \"Informal\nPayments\" were constructed, including 89 sub-keywords\nconnected with the Boolean operator OR. The three overall\nsearch terms were initially searched separately in the eight\ndatabases of PubMed, CINAHL, Social Sciences Citation\nIndex, Science Citation Index, Applied Social Sciences\nIndex and Abstracts, Worldwide Political Science Abstracts,\nConference Proceedings Citation Index Science, and Confer-\nence Proceedings Citation Index Social Science & Humani-\nties. Afterward, a combined search of the separate searches\nwas then completed with the Boolean operator AND.\nInclusion criteria were based on the number of Western\nBalkan countries included; whether concerning governance\nand informal payments in health care; sufficiency of quality\nand whether including primary evidence; studies from the\nExcluded studies were unable to fulfill inclusion criteria or\nwere duplicates. Both quantitative and qualitative studies\nwere included, making this a mixed studies review.\nA manual search was also conducted by looking through\nreference lists of relevant literature. Many articles were\nnot in English, did not regard Western Balkan countries,\ndid not meet all inclusion criteria, or were already identi-\nfied. Therefore, no additional articles were included from\nthis search.\nStudy selection.A total of 387 studies were identified from\nthe search after 40 duplicates had been removed. In total, 277\nstudies were excluded after screening titles and abstracts.\nMany of these had focused on the business sector or political\nor police corruption. 70 studies were examined more thor-\noughly, from which 64 did not meet the inclusion criteria.\nFinally, six studies were included in the review (Figure 1).\nData from the six studies were extracted to Microsoft Excel\nto organize the data. Information extracted from the studies\nwas completed with inspiration from Centre for Reviews and\nyear, author, study design, aim/objectives, age, gender, and\nethnicity of patients.\nBuch Mejsner and Eklund Karlsson 5\nAppraisal of included studies.The six included studies were\nassessed by using the Mixed MethodAppraisal Tool (MMAT;\nPluye et al., 2011), developed by McGill University in Can-\nada. The methodological quality was assessed using the cor-\nresponding criteria for qualitative, quantitative, or mixed\nmethod studies. A quality scoring system was performed giv-\nstudy. One included study scored 50% (moderate) whereas\nfive of the studies scored 75% (good), due to mainly lack of\ninformation in the reporting (Table 1).\nSynthesis methods.A thematic synthesis method was used to\ninterpret the data, to maintain consistency between the quali-\ntative study and the literature review. The analysis was com-\npleted with inspiration from Popay and colleagues (2006),\nwho also argue that thematic syntheses maybe used when\nsynthesizing qualitative, quantitative, and mixed method\nstudies. The quantitative variable labels that were included in\nthe individual studies were extracted as themes in the same\nway as conceptual themes were extracted from the qualitative\nstudies (Popay et al., 2006). These were then summarized\nnarratively and are reported in the literature findings section.\nFindings of the Empirical Part\nAccording to the main themes (italics) from the structural\nthematic analysis, the respondents emphasized primary\ncare as the main function of the health system. They also\nargued that primary health care is poorly governed by the\nstate, which creates low incentives for doctors to perform.\nThis poor motivation caused the doctors to not live up to\npeople's expectations for service provision. Furthermore,\nonly the public provision of health care services is avail-\nable in Serbia, but some larger cities have private benefi-\nciaries to support their health budget, causing an uneven\nbalance between cities. In general terms, some respondents\nbelieved that primary care functions well. However, respon-\ndents also stated that informal payments exist in health care\nand that poor communication caused informal rules to take\nover formal rules. Finally, transitioning into the EU was\nseen as a positive step, although the process of transition-\ning is perceived to move slowly. The main themes will be\nfurther elaborated in a narrative hermeneutic way.\nPerceptions on Health Care, Service Provision,\nand Governance in Transition\nThe respondents believed that primary care was important\nbecause of its closer patient\u00adprovider relationship compared\nwith secondary and tertiary care. They believed that health\ncare benefited economically from a focus on primary care.\nConcerning governance, the data indicated that health care\nwas poorly managed, which indicates poorly governed pri-\nmary care. This was drawn from statements, among others,\nthat there was poor communication between the three levels\nof health care.\nThe patient give[s] the paper to the nurse and she says \"OK\" and\nnothing; the doctor doesn't see my reference. They don't know\nwhat I have done before, and what is my suspicion, what I am\nthinking about the patient.\nGeneral practitioners were believed to be obsolete and inca-\npable of providing sufficient care to patients. This was related\nto poor communication between the three levels of health\ncare, as the respondents believed that specialists undermined\ngeneral practitioners, which caused inefficiency and mini-\nmized trust between health professionals. Therefore, discrep-\nancies between people's expectations of services and actual\nservice provision were reported. The interviewees argued\nthat trust in general practitioners had decreased primarily due\nto their low social status. However, the respondents felt that\nthe poor funding of primary care caused more damage than\nthis lack of trust. The respondents believed there were a lack\nof funding and an emphasis on specialist treatment within\nsecondary and tertiary care.\nThey do not have enough tools to work with. So it is very\ndifficult to work in primary health care because in general, we\nsaid that the most important part of the health care is the primary\nhealth care but when the Insurance Fund decided where to give\nthe money, they give the money for hospitals and other centers:\n25% [of] financial resources are going to the primary health care\nand they said they must solve 80% of the whole health problems\nand needs.\nDue to underfunding and poor resources in primary care, the\nrespondents believed that citizens perceived primary care\ndoctors to be incompetent. Specialist care was perceived as\nhigher quality. Doctors, in general, were also believed to be\nunfamiliar with general practice when graduating from school\nFigure 1. Diagram of included and excluded literature.\n6 SAGE Open\nbecause schools emphasize specialist medicine. All of the\nabove is believed to create an expensive health care system\nthat is based on treatment rather than prevention. These fac-\ntors were perceived to create low incentives for doctors' per-\nformance and poor motivation among primary care doctors,\ncausing more inefficient service provision. The data indicated\nthat poor resources in primary care were seen to be the reason\nwhy general practitioners referred patients to specialists.\nConsequently, general practitioners were perceived to have\nan obsolete function.\nThe main problem is, if the doctor wants to solve some problem\n(treat a patient in the primary care clinic), he doesn't have\nenough tools and resources. So he cannot do that. So it is the\nmain problem: it is easier to send him to the specialist.\nAnother example of poor incentives to perform, according to\nthe informants, was the low salaries of doctors.\n. . . one, they are not enough paid. Salary is disgracefully low.\nThey are not paid enough to do their work. Today, also, the\nsalaries are disgracefully low for that kind of quality\nprofessionals.\nLow salaries also indicate a low position in the society of\ngeneral practitioners. As a consequence of these factors, the\nrespondents believed that some doctors have left the country\nto find more favorable jobs elsewhere.\nThe informants believed that there was a difference\nbetween rural and urban primary care centers. For instance,\nNovi Sad, an urban city, reported having several private ben-\neficiaries assisting with health care; these are lacking in rural\nareas.\nSo NGOs together with health institutions are providing some\nhealth care programs for the citizens of Novi Sad. All other, as to\nmy knowledge, other municipalities, towns or cities in Vojvodina\ndo not have that kind of budget.\nPrivate practice was not included in service provision.\nInstead, patients who could afford to do so had the option to\nsupplement public services with private insurance services.\nPersons can also add private insurance. So, everyone is free to\npay contributions to private fund and then make some additional\nhealth services, etcetera, or better conditions in hospitals,\netcetera. So that is how it works in our country. Now.\nThe respondents believed that only a low percentage of citi-\nzens could afford additional private insurance and that pri-\nvate providers should not be included with public service\nprovision. They also stated that they believed that a future\nplan of the government is to include private practice in pub-\nlic service provision.\nThe informants felt that the transitioning into the EU\nwould benefit Serbia. However, one respondent believed that\nsome laws from the previous regime, Yugoslavia, were more\nfavorable than those from the EU. For example, the EU\nimmunization laws are believed to favor collective rights\nover individual rights.\nTable 1.

But in some way, they can\nlook in local legislative and see maybe it is better.\nCorresponding to the previous results on governance, two\nrespondents believed that Serbia still had long way to go\nbefore becoming a democratic European country but that it\nwas gradually transitioning into the EU.\nWell, we are learning. We are learning the hard way, I think. It's\nnot something that is natural for us, still. We are far from that,\nyou know. We do have it on paper, you know. We have a multi-\nparty system or something, but deep down, here and here [points\nto the heart and head] I don't feel that very much. I don't feel that.\nThere appeared to be a perception that traces of the previous\nYugoslavian regime remained in Serbia. The informants\nbelieved, for example, that politicians did not fulfill their\nduty to transition into democracy. It was also alluded that\ngeneral citizens did not regard solidarity and social capital\n(including informal and formal social networks) as common\nprinciples of society. Half of the informants believed that\nthere were different societal aspects to living in rural and\nurban areas, and therefore trust and democratic participation\nwere different between these areas.\nPerceptions on Informal Payments\nThe respondents expressed belief that informal payments\nwere present in the health system.\nYes, it exists, but in hospitals. Not in all hospitals, but partly.\nAnd hospitals in surgery department[s] and gynecologists.\nSome of the respondents believed that specialists and the\nbiggest branches of medicine were the most burdened, and\ntherefore additional payments for services occurred. Half\nof the respondents said that the public perceived primary\ncare to be transparent and open. They did not believe that\ninformal payments occurred in primary care, especially\ngiven the increased licensing and accreditation in the area.\nThis was, however, not the case for hospitals, as they were\ndifficult to monitor because they provide a wider range of\nservices.\nThey are trying to do that (monitor hospitals), but it is very hard.\nIt's hard to monitor their services because there is so wide [a]\nrange of services. And I think it will be some time before they\nhave to do like us.\nRespondents further claimed that primary care should be\nthe core of any health system, due to the positive patient\u00ad\nprovider relationship and the economic benefits. Although in\nSerbia, general practitioners were believed to be obsolete\nand incapable of providing sufficient care to patients. Also,\nthe poor funding in primary care and an emphasis on special-\nist treatments increased the discrepancies of people's expec-\ntations of services and the actual service provided.\nDue to underfunding and poor resources in primary care,\nthe respondents believed that citizens perceived primary care\ndoctors to be incompetent, perceiving specialist care as\nhigher quality. The data indicated that poor resources in pri-\nmary care were seen to be the reason why general practitio-\nners referred patients to specialists, indicating that informal\npayments may take place in this process.\nThe main problem is, if the doctor wants to solve some problem\n(treat a patient in the primary care clinic), he doesn't have\nenough tools and resources. So he cannot do that. So it is the\nmain problem: it is easier to send him to the specialist.\nLow salaries and poor resources in the health system were\nalso perceived as a reason for these informal payments for\nservices, because low salaries indicate a low position in the\nsociety of doctors. Although, the respondents believed that\nthe payments were based on patients' willingness to access\nhigher quality services and not on doctors asking for money.\nYou go to the operation and you want the best. Patients feel they\nhave to pay, for that. For the best service.\nSome respondents said that it was difficult to separate infor-\nmal payments from gratitude payments and gifts. Giving\ngratitude gifts, such as flowers and cakes to doctors, appears\nto be a common cultural phenomenon. Such gifts are not per-\nceived to be an informal payment in Serbia, according to the\nrespondents. Both paying additional cash informally and giv-\ning informal gifts were mostly to express gratitude for satis-\nfactory care, and the respondents felt that doctors would find\nit rude to deny such gratitude. It was also argued that these\ngifts create a positive patient\u00adprovider relationship. All\nrespondents believed that any payments for extra care\nthrough informal payments would be of such a small amount\nthat they were not significant. Therefore, they did not per-\nceive gratitude gifts as being unethical or informal payments\nas being a critical issue in health care. One of the respondents\nfurther believed that corruption was more dispersed in poli-\ntics and that this was the area where action would be needed.\nBigger corruption is within politicians, not with the doctors.\nBelieve me.\nThe media was also believed to exaggerate corruption,\nand the respondents perceived reality to be different.\nThey talk all the time, but they don't say that it is one percent,\nten percent or zero point one percent, of the health professional\nwho were given some money or something. I don't think it is fair\nto talk about that, because we are living in twenty-five years in\nvery bad condition[s], and they never tell that. That, for example,\na clinical doctor, they work for twenty-four hours for ten Euro.\nDo you know that, for example?\n8 SAGE Open\nRespondents also perceived that some informal rules took\nprecedence over formal rules in the health care system. They\ndescribed poor communication in health care as arising from\nthe low status of general practitioners. Poor communication\nand mistrust in the competency of general practitioners cre-\nated illegitimate informal practices. Consequently, informal\nprocedures took the place of formal rules, as general practi-\ntioners used their friendly relationships with other doctors to\nnavigate the health care system rather than their professional\nnetworks. It was evident that some general practitioners felt\ndisregarded and engaged in informal behavior as a coping\nstrategy. Therefore, when needing assistance or advice\nregarding treatments, general practitioners tended to contact\nfriends rather than a more appropriate specialist for advice.\nFindings of the Literature Review\nDescription of Included Studies\nFive of the six included studies were peer-reviewed articles\nand one a working paper, mostly concerning Albania. Two\nstudies considered informal payments in Serbia and the rest\nconcerned Bosnia Herzegovina, Montenegro, Kosovo, or\nCroatia. No Macedonian studies were in the included data.\nDesigns were typically quantitative, with only one qualita-\ntive and one mixed method study. Sample sizes also varied\nWhen examining the included studies, three overall\nthemes appeared: (a) effects of poor governance and fre-\nquency of informal payments in Western Balkan, (b) causes\nof informal payments in Western Balkan, and (c) informal\nnetworks in health care systems of Western Balkan. These\nthemes will be elaborated below.\nEffects of Poor Governance and Frequency of\nInformal Payments in Western Balkan\nIn their mixed method study from Serbia, Arsenijevic,\nPavlova, and Groot (A) found that women frequently report\npaying both quasi-formal payments and informal payments\nfor maternity services. Consequently, quasi-formal payments\nwere a result of discrepancy between official and hospital\nguidelines, highlighting the poor governance in the system.\nThe reported existence of informal payments varied a great\ndeal from 2% in what they identify as the \"pro-government\"\nbribe amounted to 500 Euro. Despite these payments, women\nstill reported problems with the quality of care they received.\nInformal payments were also reported in a cross-sequential\nstudy from Kosovo, Serbia, Bosnia Herzegovina, Montenegro,\nand Albania, conducted by Bredenkamp, Mendola, and\nGragnolati in 2011 (B). They found that informal payments rep-\nresent a relatively large share of total health expenditure, and\noften among the poor population. Accordingly, Albania had the\nhighest mean share of informal payments of all five countries.\nAlsoAlbanian household in the lowest and poorest quintile paid\non average 8% of their total health expenditure in the form of\ninformal payments, compared with 4% in the richest quintile. In\nKosovo, the share is more evenly distributed; however, the\npoorest still paid 2% of their total health expenditure in informal\npayments, whereas the richest paid 1%. In Serbia, however, the\nrichest quintile paid a slightly greater share of informal pay-\nments (3%), compared with the poorest (1%).\nIn addition to this study, one working paper (D) and one\nAlbanian Living Standard Measurement Survey, found simi-\nlar results. The former study (D) found that the incidence of\ninformal payments were fairly high in Albania; however,\nthese were less frequent in outpatient care than in inpatient\ncare. A general decline was also found in informal payments\nincrease in all health expenditure, including informal pay-\ninpatient and outpatient public and private services related to\nmedical fees, laboratory tests, drugs purchased, gifts paid to\nmedical staff, and transport).\nBoth studies (D, E) revealed that poorest groups in\nAlbania were those where a decline in informal payments\nwas least pronounced. In fact, the amount that the poorest\ngroup paid informally increased almost 5 times over the\nrichest groups, the increase were more moderate (E). This\nincrease in informal payments accordingly showed that the\npoorest group had an increased expenditure of informal pay-\n(of their total expenditure). Although, the increase was not\naccompanied by an increase in the relative per capita total\nexpenditure and, further, shows that policy measures through\ngroups in this study. Finally, in 2008, the poorest households\nhad a relatively less budget than the rich if compared with\n2002, and the poorest faced higher out-of-pocket payments.\nOlder people in general paid higher informal payments\nfor inpatient and outpatient care, maybe as they require\nmore care than others (D). Generally, working-age adults\nwere the ones that paid larger amounts of informal pay-\nments and patients in higher consumption quintiles spend\nmore on informal payments for both inpatient and outpa-\ntient services. However, they also found that health insur-\nance lowered the probability of paying informally for both\nhealth care services, but this factor did not affect the amount\npaid. Correspondingly, the results showed that generally\nvulnerable people having a smaller budget to pay for health\ncare were more likely to pay informally (D). These results\ndemonstrate an imbalance of informal payments and indi-\ncate that vulnerable groups are more prone to informal pay-\nments, and that people with more resources spend more on\ninformal payments.\nBuch Mejsner and Eklund Karlsson 9\nIn a Croatian study, Radin (C) found that in 2007, those\nwho experienced corruption and those that consider corrup-\ntion in health care to be the biggest problem (salience) also\ndid not prefer using public health care facilities. Although, a\npreference toward choosing these facilities increased in both\nindicators with age and settlement size. Also, an increase in\nage increased the odds of trusting public health facilities;\nhowever, in overall terms, corruption still lowered the odds\nof preferring public health facilities.\nFrom the opinion polls of 2009, the results were different.\nThose with experience of and salience toward corruption in\npublic health care were more likely to prefer public health\ncare. Although, this preference decreased when having a\ngreater degree of education, improvement in economic situ-\nation, and increase in settlement size. These results from\n2009 did not support the fact that health care corruption low-\ners trust in health care of the public sector. In fact, the effect\nof experiencing health care corruption had a positive effect\non trust in public sector health care.\nCauses of Informal Payments in the Health Care\nSystem in Western Balkan\nIn maternity care in Serbia (A), researchers discovered that\nwomen paying informal payments expressed dissatisfaction\nwith having to pay, and reported that they only did so for the\nsafety of their child. Among the women who did not pay and\nwho did not have connections, 14 reported that they regretted\nthis and would pay next time. These payments were in addition\nto the quasi-informal payments. Others paid informally due to\nthe low salaries of providers. Patients in Albania correspond-\ningly recognized low salaries and considered their informal\npayments as contributing salaries. Providers further rational-\nized their behavior and claimed a higher standard of living (F).\nRespondents of the just mentioned Albanian study recog-\nnized that some informal payments were given as gifts to\nexpress gratitude. Although, other members of the public\nwere, as in the study of Arsenijevic et al. (A), also upset to\npay informal payments. Respondents reported that patients\nwillingly paid informally to receive better attention, faster\ncare or for a fear of substandard care, and a feeling of secu-\nrity. Many respondents, both public and providers, also\nreported situations were no treatment was given if a payment\nwas not made (F). This corresponds to findings in the study\nof Arsenijevic and colleagues (A), where respondents\nreported, that is, obstetricians to most frequently be paid, to\nsecure his or her presence during childbirth, out of fear for\nsubstandard care and to secure better quality of care.\nInformal Networks in Health System of Western\nBalkan\nSeveral studies recognized that people in informal networks\n(i.e., friends with or related to a health care provider) are less\nlikely to pay informal payments. One study (A) found in their\nquestionnaires that 26 of the women who did not report bribes\nindicated that they had connections, such as friends, relatives,\nor colleagues, who helped them avoid informal payments by\nnot accepting payments from them and ensured special treat-\nment and adequate care. The sample indicated that during\nconnections increased, whereas reporting informal payments\ndecreased in the same time frame.Another study (F) similarly\nfound that providers described lack of social connection as an\nindicator for increased willingness of providers to ask for or\naccept informal payments. Some providers even indicated\nthat an informal payment was a way to \"warm-up\" or create\ncloser provider\u00adpatient relationship. Tomini and Groot (D)\ndescribed that rural residents paid less, but in general, they\npaid higher amounts of informal payments in outpatient care\ncompared with residents of urban areas. This indicate that\nthese rural residents do not pay in their own area due to social\nconnections, but pay higher amounts in urban areas where\nsuch network connections are lacking and higher opportunity\ncosts are involved. This is, for example, when needing care at\nlarger hospitals in urban areas. The fact that vulnerable people\nwere more likely to pay informally is attributed to the possi-\nbility that people with more social connections and informa-\ntion (social capital; for example, health care providers) are\nless likely to pay informal payments due to their network.\nDiscussion\nFindings from the study indicated that the present way of gover-\nnance of the Serbian health system might create negative effects\nfor the system's functioning. For example, the underfunding of\nhealth care and low salaries for doctors seemed to create imbal-\nances in the Serbian health care system, whereby informal pay-\nments were seen as a coping strategy. This is in line with the\nfindingsofpreviousstudiesonthesubject(Arsenijevic,Pavlova,\n2011) and which connect informal payments with poor manage-\nment, underfunding, or a lack of accountability (Gaal & McKee,\ndemocracy to hold civil servants responsible for inappropriate\nactions and to reduce the likelihood of informal payments\nruption and lack of transparency in the recruitment procedures\nwhen hiring for the public sector in Serbia. This may illustrate\npoor public management of the health care system that lacks\nintegrity and transparency. When investigating Serbian's per-\nception of transparency, United Nations Development\nProgramme (UNDP) and TNS Medium Gallup (2011) further\nfound that citizens regard transparency as being less important\nin the fight against corruption.According to Vian (2008), trans-\nparencyisakeyfactorinthefightagainstcorruption.Comparing\nthis with the INXIT theory of Gaal and Mckee (2004), the\ndeclining performance of health care in Serbia may leave\npatients and doctors' needs unsatisfied. Patients and doctors\nmay choose to leave the system (Exit); however, for patients in\nSerbia, private practice is expensive and not commonly avail-\nable and they may have no ability to Exit. This may foster the\npresence of informal payments, as patients secure themselves\nhigher quality care (INXIT).ThroughVoice, patients can choose\ncomplaint mechanisms. However, studies show that some\npatients in Serbia perceive reporting of informal payments to be\npointless, whereas others benefited from making informal pay-\npayments in Serbian health care appear to be a strategy to infor-\nmally \"Exit\" the system, violating the established rules and\ndiminishing democracy.\nDespite only describing others' experiences with paying\ninformally, the interviewed Serbians argued that informal pay-\nments were more pronounced in inpatient care services and\nthat such payments in outpatient care services were not possi-\nble as the centers were working toward becoming licensed,\nwhich required more monitoring. The monitoring of hospitals,\nhowever, was perceived difficult, and there were still no inten-\ntion on the part of policy-makers to start enforcing greater\ncontrol in these institutions. Even though the respondents may\nnot have experienced paying informally firsthand, this is wor-\nrying in contrast to the ideas of poor technical skills in primary\ncare providers, which facilitated high referral rates to special-\nist providers, and the informal networks between providers. It\ncould mean that providers, being perceived as having poor\nskills and not being included in an expert network, are passive\nabout recommending policies for health as stakeholders. These\nissues relate to accountability and citizen voice in Vian's\n(2008) framework and affect the success or failure of policies\n(Greer et al., 2016). The study by UNDP and TNS Medium\nGallup (2011) in Serbia similarly found public passivity and\nignorance concerning the fight against corruption. There was\nalso a perception among our respondents that corruption was\ngiven too much attention in the media and that the real prob-\nlem in health care was not corruption. This may stem from a\nlack of knowledge about informal payments and gift giving in\nhealth care. Providers in Serbia may, therefore, not be held\nproperly accountable for accepting informal payments.\nThere was a general perception in the findings that\npatients were aware of doctors' low salaries and poor work-\ning environment; hence, they gave them gifts and money out\nof gratitude or to receive (better) care. Providers further\nrationalized their behavior and claimed a higher standard of\nliving. Thompson and Witter (2000) found such low salaries\nto be an important reason why patients give both monetary\nand nonmonetary gifts to providers. In Vian's framework,\nthis is identified as rationalization and pressure to abuse.\nDoctors may feel a need to accept informal payments because\nthey have debt and need to make a living. Patients rationalize\ntheir behavior by regarding informal payments as being\nacceptable in the current situation despite free entitlement to\nhealth care. Although as several of the Albanian studies in\nthe literature review showed (D, E), such payments create\ninequity in access to services, as vulnerable groups have a\nhigher likelihood to pay informally.\nDoctors having the opportunity to accept informal pay-\nments (e.g., when a health system is poorly governed) will\noften act to maximize their self-interest. This may not be the\ncause of informal payments in some countries, although as\nBelloni and Strazzari (2014) described it, war can cause ille-\ngal informal practices and corruption from informal actors,\nwho exploit their influence in a transitioning country in an\neffort to maximize their self-interest, that is, due to high dis-\ncretion or monopoly in health care services. Corruption is,\naccording to these researchers, not a deviation caused by a\nfew public officials but rather a structural matter that becomes\nstandard operating procedure.\nIt is widely discussed whether informal payments are paid\nwillingly or out of fear of substandard care. Petrovic (2014)\nfound that people in Serbia bribe doctors for better treatment\n(providers identify an opportunity to abuse) and that corrupt\nofficials may thrive in a system with low salaries (pressure to\nabuse and rationalization), low health care funding, and high\nunemployment rates for doctors (providers feel pressure and\nhave an opportunity to abuse). When patients are ill-equipped\nto assess the quality and adequacy of physicians' decisions\nand actions, informal payments maybe given to secure fair\ntreatment. However, quality is often not maximized due to the\npatient's inability to judge medical quality (Thompson &\nWitter, 2000). The poor knowledge of patients and the domi-\nnance of public service provision (monopoly), as is the case\nin Serbia, limit the ability of patients to choose other provid-\ners for services, consequently facilitating informal payments.\nCivil servants of the qualitative interviews further\ndescribed that only a low percentage of doctors engaged in\ncorruption, but that gifts to medical professionals were\naccepted. Giving gifts to health care providers in gratitude\nwere only identified in one of the reviewed studies from\nAlbania (F). Other studies concerning Serbia (A, B), Kosovo\n(B), and Albania (B, D, E, F) found patients paying infor-\nmally for health care services, illustrating that these pay-\nments maybe more pronounced than the Serbian respondents\ninitially perceive. In Serbia, gifts are seen as a token of grati-\ntude to doctors (patients' rationalization). Doctors have dif-\nficulty refusing these gifts, as patients will feel offended and\nwill accordingly feel a pressure to abuse. Gift giving and\nfavors among family, friends, and local government officials\nin postcommunist European countries are commonly viewed\nas social logic (Gr\u00f8deland, 2013). The reciprocity of \"giving\nand taking\" is rooted in sociocultural factors, where patients\nmay express gratitude through gifts (Gaal & McKee, 2004;\nPolese, 2014). Informal payments may, therefore, be under-\nreported in Serbian health care, as gift giving is undeter-\nmined. From the same perspective, the present study\nillustrated that gift giving created a positive patient\u00adprovider\nrelationship, which maybe a rationalization by both patients\nand providers. However, some patients (A, F) were upset to\npay extra for services that they were entitled to. Polese\n(2014) believed that informal payments may not only create\na long-term relationship and social contacts but also produce\nBuch Mejsner and Eklund Karlsson 11\nobligations of reciprocity. Petrovic (2014) argued that many\ndoctors in Serbia are accustomed to receiving small gifts of\ngratitude but that up to 40% of doctors ask for such gifts, and\na number of these also charge informal cash payments. It\nbecomes a moral discussion then whether gifts are seen as\ngratitude or bribes. Petschnig (1983) denied the validity of\ngratitude gifts, exclusively believing that they are fees to\nobtain personal gain. Although WHO (2000) defined any\nform of informal patient payment (including gifts) as an act\nof corruption, in practice, it is difficult to determine whether\npayments or gifts are tips or bribes.\nDespite innocent and kind gestures to medical profession-\nals, both WHO (2000) and several researchers (i.e.,\nshowed that informal payments for health care can have neg-\native effects on health status, health care access, and equity,\nas people delay seeking care or sell assets to pay for care.\nWHO (2000) believed that co-payments and informal pay-\nments for services will reduce demand in lower socioeco-\nnomic groups. Some segments of society will not be able to\npay additional health care costs, whereas other groups may\nreceive additional care due to their higher socioeconomic\nstatus. It also becomes difficult for decision-makers to draw\na line between gratuities and bribes when legitimating gifts\nin the health care system. In Serbia, further confusion is seen\nin the charging of co-payments for services. Distinguishing\nbetween formal and informal payments becomes difficult,\naffecting the reporting and perception of informal payments.\nIn Serbia, it maybe uncertain to patients and providers\nwhether they are acting corruptly because there is no clear\nunderstanding in the general public of informal payments.\nMethodological Considerations\nSampling of the empirical part of the study was purposive to\nidentify civil servants working in the health system. A further\nintention was to include patients and/or the general public to\nidentify a broader perspective on informal payments, but this\nwas not feasible, as a translator or local researchers would have\nbeen needed and also given the limited time and resources\navailable for this research. For the same reason, only English-\nspeaking participants were included, potentially missing infor-\nmation that could have been valuable to the study. Sampling\nbias is, therefore, a potential limitation to the study, and the\npurposive sampling was sufficient to develop an initial under-\nstanding, but is not generalizable. The literature review was\nconducted to strengthen the evidence of these qualitative data,\nproviding a more solid understanding of the phenomenon of\ninterest. Inclusion of studies was, however, narrow and could\nhave provided a stronger evidence base with broader inclusion\ncriteria. The purposive sampling of the public health institutes\nand primary care centers included inclusion and exclusion cri-\nteria for doctors and public health officials within Belgrade and\nVojvodina. Other cities could have been included, and more\ninterviews could have been conducted. However, networking\nand additional calls would have been necessary for additional\nrecruiting, which was unrealistic in terms of time constraints. It\nwas also necessary to obtain approval from management before\nconducting interviews, which further limited recruiting.\nAlthough this is a pilot study, the included data are sufficient to\nsuggest research that is needed to fill the knowledge gaps.\nFurthermore, a wider variety of professionals would still have\nrepresented the same institutions as already included, as other\ninstitutions declined to participate. Nonetheless, the literature\nreview was conducted in a comprehensive manner, including\ndata from several Western Balkan countries and enabling a\ncomparison between the empirical findings and what is already\nknown on the subject.\nThree potential participants denied participating in the\nstudy when realizing the topic to be connected to corruption\nand in fear of consequences to the individual participants.\nBudak and Rajh (2012) argued that corruption maybe under-\nreported due to citizen's awareness that they live in a \"sur-\nveillance society,\" combined with their memories of an\nundemocratic regime. This might prevent the reporting of\ncorruption experiences. Some civil servants were also pro-\nvided an option to fill out a questionnaire rather than to pro-\nvide a live interview. Questionnaires were, therefore, sent to\nthese respondents and to all potential participants who did\nnot respond, to accommodate any reluctance to conduct a\nlive interview, but none were returned. Sampling bias in the\nqualitative study is therefore present, as only those subjects\nwho were willing and able to talk about health system gover-\nnance and informal payments were interviewed.\nConclusion\nPrimary care was not considered to currently be serving as the\ncore of health care and was perceived to be underfunded and\ninefficient. Underfunding and the poor motivation of doctors\nwere perceived as incentives for corruption and informal pay-\nments according to the literature from other Western Balkan\ncountries and the Serbian respondents of the empirical study.\nA related issue is the culture of gratitude gifts identified at all\nlevels of health care. Difficulties in terms of defining the dif-\nference between informal payments and gratitude gifts were\nobvious, and if informal payments are perceived as legitimate,\nit might lead to underreporting, making the prevention of\ninformal payments difficult. Moreover, a poor implementation\nof strategies tackling informal payments may worsen the situ-\nation, creating an increase in patients paying informally. Such\nconsequences may exist particularly for vulnerable groups, as\nthese were found in some studies to be more likely to pay\ninformally. It may also be difficult for patients and providers in\nSerbia and other Western Balkan countries to separate legiti-\nmate and illegitimate co-payments for health care. From the\nstatements of respondents, scientific research (Gaal & McKee,\nbetween poor governance of the health care system and\ninformal payments in Serbia. One of the most imperative\nissues identified was the value-laden and culture-bound per-\nception of what is considered an informal patient payment.\nImplications for Future Research\nA more comprehensive systematic review would be needed\nto examine research gaps such as the lacking scientific evi-\ndence on informal payments by some vulnerable groups, that\nis, migrants. This includes also governance of the health care\nsystems and implications of paying informally. More scien-\ntific research is needed on the nature of gifts as gratitude to\ndoctors and on patients' trust in health care providers (deter-\nmining, for example, their selection of health care facilities)\nand the quality of treatment that may lead them to pay doc-\ntors informally. Future research should further focus on the\nimplementation and effectiveness of interventions on infor-\nmal payments such as the effectiveness of policy measures.\nA more in-depth study through interviewing the general\npublic and civil servants of the health care system would also\nbe needed. The study maybe used to inform decision-makers\non positive and negative aspects of ongoing anticorruption\nstrategies. The aim should, therefore, focus on generating new\ntheories on ways to implement strategies to combat informal\npayments in the Western Balkan health care settings.\nAppendix\nPublications Included in the Review\nA.
