This study evaluates data from 215 U.K.-based small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) about the perceived\nvalue of 11 sources of information between planning (i.e., firms with a crisis management plan) and non-planning respondents.\nFor planning firms, the information sources considered to be useful are exclusively experience-based, and when information\nsources become less idiosyncratic and episodic, planning firms' evaluations of their value begin to approximate the ratings\ngiven by non-planning firms. Furthermore, the concepts of relative value distance and value distance from threshold are original\nfeatures of this study and offer new ways to evaluate the value of information sources for organizations wishing to provide\ninformation and support to improve business resilience and business continuity.\n",

Four consec-\nutive nights of rioting in a number of major English cities\naffected 48,000 businesses, the vast majority of which were\nSMEs (Moore, 2011). Alongside seemingly more mundane\nproblems such as the loss of electricity, mains water supply,\ntelecommunications, and postal services, small businesses in\nparticular face threats to their business continuity that can\nultimately threaten their survival. This article focuses on the\ninformation that could be used by managers during the pro-\ncess of planning for serious disruptions. In particular, the\nstudy examines the differences in the perceived usefulness of\n11 specific information sources and the variations that exist\nbetween SMEs with plans to respond to serious incidents and\ninterruptions (hereafter referred to as planning firms) and\nthose without such plans (non-planning firms).\nThe article provides a background to crisis management\nand the paucity of germane research about SMEs in this con-\ntext. In particular, the vulnerability of SMEs to business\ninterruptions and factors relating to the low uptake of formal\nplanning in this context are considered to provide a context\nfor the study and to undergird the importance of such plan-\nning within broader SMEs' risk management planning and\nresilience development. Following this, the article proceeds\nto consider how learning for crisis is contextualized within\nthe broader organizational learning from crisis literature.\nHaving established the contextual and conceptual boundaries\nof the study, the author formally articulates three research\nquestions and explains the research methodology used.\nFollowing presentation of the data and discussion, the article\ndraws a number of conclusions that have important implica-\ntions for SME owners wishing to adopt formal planning for\nbusiness interruptions, and for national and local policy mak-\ners, industry associations, and business support organiza-\ntions and agencies (such as enterprise agencies, chambers of\ncommerce, and local enterprise partnerships) wishing to pro-\nvide guidance and support that is deemed to be valuable and\nuseful by these end users.\nCrisis Management and SMEs\nCalling them \"an inevitable and permanent feature of mod-\nern societies,\" Mitroff and Anagnos (2001, p. 1) suggest that\ncrises present leaders and managers with situations that\nrequire an immediate response that is either planned or\n1De Montfort University, Leicester, UK\nCorresponding Author:\nBrahim Herbane, Leicester Business School, De Montfort University, The\nGateway, Leicester, LE1 9BH, UK.\nEmail: bhcor@dmu.ac.uk\nInformation Value Distance and Crisis\nManagement Planning\nBrahim Herbane1\n Keywords\ncrisis management, small- and medium-sized enterprises, incident management, business continuity planning, organizational\nlearning\n2 SAGE Open\nimprovised.

Here, we use the term crisis management planning to\nrefer to activities that may be formally implemented through\nprocesses such as emergency planning (Crichton, Ramsay, &\nor business continuity planning (Alesi, 2008; Lindstrom,\nSamuelsson, & Hagerfors, 2010). Whichever of these\napproaches is adopted, crisis management planning sets in\nplace predetermined plans and/or resources for the restora-\ntion of processes in the event of an acute and unexpected\ninterruption or incident.1\nIn the context of the United Kingdom, small- and medium-\nsized enterprises play a hugely significant economic role.\n(Department for Business Innovation and Skills, 2013), firms\nsector turnover and 59.3% of private sector employment.\nSMEs constitute 99.2% of all private enterprises in the\nUnited Kingdom. In general operational terms, small firms\nare more vulnerable to failure than larger corporate entities\nwith nearly one third failing within 3 years of start-up (DTI\nSmall Business Service, 2007). SMEs are particularly vul-\nnerable to large-scale crisis events. For instance, over 450\nbusinesses were affected by the Irish Republican Army's\nbombing of Manchester's Arndale shopping center in 1996.\nWithin 6 months of the attack, 250 firms had ceased trading,\nmost of which were SMEs (Herbane, 2010). More recently,\nDuncan, Yeager, Rucks, and Ginter (2011) have highlighted\nthe disproportionately high impact that natural and man-\nmade disasters in the United States have had on small- and\nmedium-sized firms, leading to their observation that given\nthe inevitability of a disaster striking, operational continuity\nplanning is essential for organizational survival.\nThere is evidence to support the assertion that small- and\nmedium-sized firms are more vulnerable to the effects of an\nacute crisis. One series of influences on an organization's\nvulnerability to crisis is the organizational components that\n(Pauchant & Mitroff, 1992) present as a layered \"onion\"\nmodel of crisis with an outer core of technology followed by\norganizational structure and human factors to the inner layers\nof organizational culture and top management psychology.\nFor SMEs, each of these components differ from larger firms\nin terms of their usage, complexity, and redundancy (surplus\nresources that can be marshaled for a crisis response). The\npresence of resource redundancy is considered an important\nprecursor to higher resilience to crisis (Boin & Schulman,\n(1999) argues than redundancy occasionally serves to pre-\nserve poorly designed systems in large firms that are vulner-\nable to failure. There is support for the role of such plans in\nsignificantly reducing recovery lead times (Fink, 1986) and\nSME managers have been found to strongly associate crisis\nmanagement planning with increased business resilience\nduring a crisis (Herbane, 2010). Despite this, however, a\nnumber of studies have found that SMEs are less likely to\nundertake formal crisis management planning than large\nfirms and that a small proportion of SMEs have formal plans\nto deal with business interruptions. Despite some method-\nological differences, a number of studies since 2003 have\nhighlighted these differentials in the presence of formalized\nplans and processes to deal with business interruptions (see\nSMEs have formal dedicated business continuity plans.\nFurthermore, in the U.K. context, resulting from the Civil\nContingencies Act of 2004, there is a recognition of the vul-\nnerability of, and support needed for, SMEs in the duties of\nlocal authorities and other bodies in providing advice and\nassistance about business continuity planning (Herbane,\nOrganizational Learning From Crisis\nVersus Organizational Learning for\nCrisis\nIn the timeline of a crisis with pre-, trans-, and post-crisis\nphases, this latter phase (at which point operational recovery\nfrom the crisis has been achieved and the organization is able\nto fulfill the majority of its pre-crisis contractual and com-\nmercial obligations) is the locale for organizational learning\nand process improvement (Karakasidis, 1997; Smith &\n2003). The main focus is to learn from the precursors, gene-\nsis, and manifestation of the crisis to identify opportunities to\nimprove the resilience of the firm to the reoccurrence of the\ncrisis, and to evaluate the preparations for, and responses to,\nthe crisis once it arose and the management team took the\nformal decision to implement the crisis management plan.\nOpportunities are also presented to learn about participants'\nsituational awareness and post-crisis stress (Paton, 2003).\nCrises may act as triggers to crisis-induced learning\n(Deverell, 2009), and learning can take place intra-crisis\nthrough incident command structures rather than simply\ninter- or post-crisis (Moynihan, 2009). Beyond the boundar-\nies of the organization that encountered the crisis, post-crisis\nlearning about crisis can take place through public inquiries\nand accident investigations (Elliott, 2009; Elliott &\ncrises may be characterized as \"ill-structured messes\" due to\nthe high interaction of problems within a complex system.\nThese traits mean that stakeholders differ in their under-\nstanding of the constituent problems of a crisis, making it\n\"inherently controversial\" (Mitroff, Alpaslan, & Green,\n(knowing) and active learning (knowing followed by correc-\ntive action), Toft and Reynolds (1997) propose that crisis\npreparedness is enhanced by transferring knowledge from\none setting to another where there are \"strong isomorphic\nsimilarities\" (p. 55) because of similarities in behavioral pat-\nterns. This isomorphic learning should promulgate changes\nboth to explicit plans/recovery processes and the assump-\ntions held by actors about their ability to response to an inci-\ndent. A consequence of this for SME owners is whether\ninformation about the impact of incidents on SMEs may\nform a type of \"iconic\" learning, which as Toft and Reynolds\nThe propensity for organizations to be exposed to a crisis\nhas occupied a large amount of attention in the literature (La\nPazzaglia, 2009), within which studies have also examined\ntheir resistance to change (Toft & Reynolds, 1997) and the\ninfluence of information asymmetries in crisis prevention\n(Fauchart, 2006) that are problematized when the crisis is\ndispersed across locations and points in time--in other\nwords, the crisis is not a single \"big-bang\" incident taking\nplace in a single location. Roux-Dufort (2009) refers to crisis\nproneness resulting from \"an undercurrent accumulation of\norganizational imperfections (anomalies, vulnerabilities [. .\n.]) that lay a favourable ground for crises to occur\" (p. 5)\ncoupled with management ignorance (deliberate or other-\nwise) of these imperfections. This processual view of crisis,\nRoux-Dufort suggests, highlights the importance of manag-\ners using knowledge of events to develop and enhance their\nunderstanding of how vulnerabilities foment. His account\nproposes that managers may fail to seek information and\nsupport to understand and address organizational vulnerabil-\nity because of the cognitive dissonance that would arise from\nreconciling \"business-as-usual\" with \"risk of failure.\" This\nfailure fuels anomalies, then vulnerabilities, and subsequent\ndisruptions. Set within the context of Turner's disaster incu-\nRoux-Dufort (2009) further reinforces the failures of fore-\nsight thesis and the critical role of maladaptive behaviors that\ninclude political dysfunctions and cognitive impediments to\neffective information collection and analysis. Limited cogni-\ntion through rigid adherence to simple assumptions about the\norganization and its environment has been associated with\ncrisis-prone organizations (Pauchant & Mitroff, 1992) and\ncrisis-prone managers who exhibit faulty assumptions due to\ndefense mechanisms and personality disorders (Mitroff &\nSmith and Elliott's (2007) meta-analysis of the organiza-\ntional learning from crisis literature identified eight barriers\nto learning: rigidity of core beliefs, values, and assumptions;\nineffective communication and information difficulties;\ndenial, centrality of expertise, and the disregard of outsiders;\nperipheral inquiry and decoy phenomenon; cognitive nar-\nrowing and fixation (reductionist); maladaptation, threat\nminimization and environmental shifts; lack of corporate\nresponsibility; and a focus on single-loop learning. These\nbarriers are said to hinder the use of information in subse-\nquent planning for crises and influence the degree of crisis\npreparedness that the organization possesses. Synthesizing\norganizational learning with a chronological view of crisis\n(pre-, trans-, and post-crisis stages), a valuable distinction is\nmade between learning for crisis, learning as crisis, and\nlearning from crisis, respectively. Learning for crisis involves\npre-crisis scenario planning, modeling, and simulation in\norder that managers can learn from past events (including\nthose affecting other organizations) to enhance their own\nprovisions for crisis recovery. This crisis phronsis--experi-\nence- and action-driven wisdom based on the experience of\ncrisis--is essential in the drive toward greater business resil-\nience and, ultimately, business survival.\nA further reason why managers may choose not to seek\ninformation from specific parties is informed by literature\nfocusing on risk perception. Assessments of risk are medi-\nated by the degree of trust placed in the source of information\nand knowledge. Trust in the information has been found to\nincrease where experiential, judgmental, or practiced activi-\nties are concerned, and where different constituencies in the\nproduction and use of knowledge share the same practices\nby whom the knowledge is produced and how this combina-\ntion of reputational and experiential factors determines the\ncredibility of the source and managers' volition toward the\nsources for support and guidance. Furthermore, Frewer,\nthat trust about information \"may as important a determinant\n. . . as the content of the risk information,\" and the neutrality\nof the source is essential in offsetting the potential for dis-\ntrust. Such literature cites disagreements between scientists,\ngovernments, and the public about the environmental haz-\nards set against the benefits of retaining or introducing new\ntechnologies. Within the context of the present study, trust\nand assessments of risk may be influenced by disagreements\nin the perceived value of the practices embedded within sup-\nport and guidance. Not only is trust central to social capital\nfor public engagement (Kapserson, Golding, & Kasperson,\n1999), thereby affecting the effectiveness and asymmetries\nof risk communication, the fragility of trust reflects the rela-\ntionships between parties (such as between information pro-\nvider and receiver) and thus risk diagnosis and management\nWhile attention has been given to the meaning of the\nexperience of crisis through the process of \"sense making\"\n4 SAGE Open\nduring the trans-crisis stage, and the roles of commitment,\ncapacity, and expectations in attenuating the crisis (Weick,\n1988), little attention has been given to how and whether\norganizations can learn about planning for serious disrup-\ntions prior to their occurrence other than learning for crisis in\nthe form of the study of antecedents and simulation of the\ncrisis response. Given the lower levels of adoption of formal\ncrisis management planning in the form of business continu-\nity planning in SMEs (Pearson & Woodman, 2012) and the\ndeterrent effect of complex planning guidance (Duncan et\nal., 2011) on its adoption, relatively little is known about\nhow they embark on the process of learning about an unfa-\nmiliar activity that is intended to guide an organization at the\ntime of its greatest potential vulnerability. As managers of\nSMEs scan the information environment for sources, which\nsources and information providers are used and perceived to\nbe useful, and what does this tell policy makers about SMEs\ninformation and support needs as they start their processes of\nlearning for crisis prevention and recovery? Moreover, stud-\nies of organization learning from crises are firmly rooted in a\nlarge firm perspective rather than the individual learning and\nbehavior processes (Kolb, 1984) of the owner manager as the\nprincipal (and often only) strategic decision maker that pre-\nvails in a small- and medium-sized enterprise context.\nInformation is a precursor to organizational learning and\nplanning processes, and can influence the bounded aware-\nness of decision makers (Bazerman & Chugh, 2006) and\nparadigm blindness (Wheatley, 2006), yet little is known\nabout attitudes to sources of information about crisis man-\nagement planning in SMEs. Accordingly, the study sets out\nto address the following questions:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 What are the sources of information that the managers\nof SMEs deem important for crisis management\nplanning?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 How do the perceptions of information sources differ\naccording to their source and nature?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 How do perceptions vary between SMEs with crisis\nmanagement planning in place and those without it?\nMethod\nThe data used in the study were collected through the use of\na postal questionnaire that was sent to a representative sam-\nple of 1,000 U.K. SMEs chosen randomly from the Bureau\ndefinition of a small- or medium-sized firm according to the\n(European Commission, 2010) specifies a small firm as hav-\ning a turnover per annum/balance sheet total less than 10\nmillion and less than 50 employees. A medium-sized firm\nhas a turnover per annum of no greater than 50 million, a\nbalance sheet total of not more than 43 million, and between\n51and250employees(inaddition,theEuropeanCommission\ndefines a \"micro\" firm as having turnover/balance sheet\ntotals less than 2 million and less than 10 employees). Data\nwere collected as part of a wider study in U.K. SMEs\n(Herbane, 2013) but the data are used and presented for the\nfirst time in this study (i.e., there is no data overlap with other\npublished work).\nThe data were derived from a questionnaire that com-\nprised of questions about the company's size, age, and the\npresence of formal crisis management plans. Respondents\nwere asked to indicate the company's experience of seven\ndifferent crisis types based on Mitroff and Alpaslan (2003)\nclassification of crises (physical, personnel, external crimi-\nnal, information, natural, economic, and reputational), which\nin turn echoes a number of other classifications in the extant\nShrivastava, 1988). The instrument was designed to elicit\nratings (using a five-point Likert-type scale ranging from\nstrongly agree to strongly disagree) for a variety of sources\nof information that were deemed to be useful to a manager\nfor crisis management planning. This study focuses on data\nrelating to the respondents' evaluations of the usefulness\n(actual in the case of planning firms and potentially in the\ncase of non-planning firms) of the following 11 information\nsources; businesses in the same economic sector, organiza-\ntions outside the firm's sector, the media, local authorities,\ncolleagues within the business, central government, business\nsupport agencies, important clients, industry associations,\nlegislation and regulations (including standards), and the\nfirm's experience of crisis.\nThe targeted respondent was the Managing Director of\nthe company, and each one was sent a personalized covering\nletter to accompany the questionnaire and postage-paid\nreturn envelope. The mailing resulted in 215 usable\nresponses, giving a response rate of 22.4% (in 42 of the\n1,000 firms in the sample, the addressee had left the com-\npany). To examine for potential non-response bias, mean\nscores for early and late responses were examined\n(Armstrong & Overton, 1977) with resulting t-tests no sig-\nnificant differences between early and late responders for\nthe variables used in this study. Furthermore, the response\nrate is argued to be acceptable given that other seminal and\nrecent studies with similar methodological characteristics\nsuch as senior managers as the target respondent (Hunt &\nChonko, 1987), sensitive subject matter (Mitroff et al.,\n1988), and respondent organization and sample frame size\n(Fraj-Andr\u00e9s, Martinez-Salinas, & Matute-Vallejo, 2009;\nHuurne & Gutteling, 2008). Respondent firms ranged in\ndents indicated that they had a formal crisis management\nplan with mean spending of \u00a310,181 per annum on crisis\nplanning activities. Testing for non-response bias, the mea-\nsures of company age, and the number of employees for a\nrandom selection of 50 respondent and 50 non-respondent\nfirms were tested using the Independent Samples\nKolmogorov\u00adSmirnov test with resulting p-values for age\nResults and Discussion\nContrasts Between Planning and Non-Planning\nFirms\nTable 1 presents respondents' ratings about the actual or\npotential usefulness of 11information sources for crisis man-\nagement planning. The independent-samples t-test was\nemployed to test for significant differences in the responses\nof SMEs with crisis plans (\"planning,\" n = 47) and SMEs\nwithout crisis plans (\"non-planning,\" n = 168). With the\nexception of the media, the mean scores of the 10 remaining\ninformation sources differed significantly at the .05 level.\nThe data show that planning and non-planning firms rank\nexperience-based information sources (colleagues, firm\nexperience of crisis, important clients, other firm's experi-\nence of crisis in their sector, other firm's experience of crisis\noutside their sector) among the most important in terms of\ntheir perceived usefulness for crisis management planning.\nFor planning firms, these experience sources constituted the\ntop five ranked information sources and for non-planning\nfirms, these sources occupied positions two to six in the rank\norder, with the highest ranking taken by a generic external\nsource--the media. This similarity in ranking is, however,\nmoderated by the observation that none of the ratings for\ninformation sources from non-planners rise above the mid-\nway point of the Likert-type scale. Only the experience of\ncrisis and the media had scores that were higher than the\narithmetical midway point (2.5). Thus, while the rankings\nsuggest only minor differences between planning and non-\nplanning firms, the ratings given to each information source\nreveal a lack of importance attached to all 11 information\nsources by non-planning firms as opposed to 6 information\nsources deemed to lack relative importance for planning\nfirms. The data suggest that the experience of crisis and\ninformation from the general media are the most likely to be\ninputs to crisis management planning for those current non-\nadopters. The similarity in rank order also supports the prop-\nosition that non-planning firms also consider experience to\nbe a potentially useful source of information; what differs is\nthat they currently attach a far lower importance to it than\ntheir planning counterparts (rather than such sources appear-\ning at the lower end of the ranking order for non-planners).\nIrrespective of the presence of a crisis management plan\nor otherwise, organizations in the study attached a low level\nof importance to information from government/public agen-\ncies such as central government, local authorities (city and\ncounty councils), and business support agencies such as with\nthese sources ranked as the three least important among both\ntypes of firms. Moreover, even for planning firms, the rank-\nings were distant from the midpoint on the measurement\nscale, making these sources by far the least important for\nthose SMEs that have undertaken the process of plan devel-\nopment. This triumvirate of government/public information\nsources is discernibly separated in importance to a mid-rank-\ning group of information sources that include the media,\nindustry associations, and legislation, regulations and stan-\ndards. The ratings for these sources mark a transition to those\nthat are deemed useful by respondents in the study.\nIndustry-level influence is stronger in terms of the value of\noperational information from other organizations in the sector\nand organizations downstream in the supply chain than with\nthe influence from industry-level formalities such as associa-\ntions, standards, regulations, and legislation. For planning\nfirms, the value of the media as an information source that\nmay highlight issues affecting specific industries has a rating\nthat sits between these industry-level formalities. Industry-\nlevel operational information sources are considered to be\nimportant for planning firms and are central to the predomi-\nnant group of important information sources that are based\naround the experience of crisis rather than formal industry-\nlevel influences on behavior. The greater value placed on\nexperiential rather than generic information and know-how\nculminates in the highest value placed on information arising\nfrom the organization's own experience of crisis, colleagues\nwithin the firm, and from other firms in the same sector.\nInformation Value Distances\nUsing data from the information sources valued by respon-\ndent firms in Table 1, examination of the differential between\nTable 1. Evaluations of Information Sources--Planning Versus Non-Planning SMEs.\nSource Planning (n = 47) Rank\nNon-planning\nSignificance\n(2-tailed)\nDiff (plan vs.\nnon-plan) Rank\nDiff (non-plan\nvs. midpoint)\n6 SAGE Open\nthe mean rating given by planning and non-planning firms for\neach information type (referred to as the relative value dis-\ntance [RVD]) along with the differential between the scores\nfor information types for non-planning firms and the mid-\npoint on the scale at which a rising score indicates an increas-\ning level of perceived usefulness (known as value distance\nfrom threshold), provide further insight into the perceived dif-\nferences between each information source (Table 2).\nThe data indicate that the largest RVDs between planning\nand non-planning firms for information sources tend to be\nthe experience-derived sources (colleagues, firm experience\nof crisis, important clients, other firm's experience of crisis\nin their sector, other firm's experience of crisis outside their\nsector), although legislation, regulation, and standards has\nthe fourth highest RVD. The organization's prior experience\nof a crisis had small value distances between planning and\nnon-planning firms, and between the non-planning firm\nscore and the midpoint. This corresponds with the associa-\ntion between experience of a crisis as a stimuli for the adop-\ntion of CM planning, after which the intention to avoid or\nprevent crises relegates the importance of this source of\ninformation given the formalized intention to avoid the\noccurrence/recurrence of interruptions (though recognizably\nuseful nonetheless).\nThe RVDs for information sources such a business sup-\nport agencies, general government, and local authorities are\nsmaller. Given these sources' comparatively lower ratings\nfor usefulness by planning firms (rated below the midpoint\non the rating scale), the smaller value distances should not be\ninterpreted as an indication that little is required to change\nnon-planning firms' views of the value of the information\nsource. Instead, it highlights the question of whether--in the\nlight of bounded rationality--managers in a small firm con-\ntext should prioritize the sources that planning firms value\nand value most. Table 2 also presents the difference for each\ninformation source against the midpoint of the scale for\nnon-planning firms to highlight which sources are perceived\nto be most and least distant from the point at which they are\ndeemed to be useful. This generates a measure of value dis-\ntance from threshold. Here, the data reveal that didactic\nsources have the greatest value distances from the threshold\nof information value (3) whereas experiential sources rank\n6th to 10th in value distance from threshold. Combined with\nour understanding that these experiential sources are consid-\nered the most useful information sources by planning firms,\nthere is little distance between the ratings assigned by non-\nplanning firms and the threshold of information value,\nwhereas didactic sources rank first to fifth in their distance\naway from the threshold of information value. This echoes\nthe findings in Herbane (2010) which, albeit a small sample\nstudy, highlighted small firms' negative views about infor-\nmation and guidance provided for small business support.\nFor planning firms, the information sources considered to\nbe useful are exclusively experience-based and derived from\nthe immediate or wider operational context in which the\norganization resides and this reinforces the importance of\niconic and isomorphic learning (Toft & Reynolds, 1997).\nOnce information sources become less idiosyncratic and epi-\nsodic to more generic and prescriptive in nature, planning\nfirms' evaluations of their value begin to approximate the\nratings that non-planning firms give to these less unimport-\nant sources. Only the experience of crisis as a source of\ninformation came close to being deemed useful for non-plan-\nners as it had for planning firms.\nWhy might experience-based information be preferred?\nOne explanation is that information about the technicalities\nof planning may no longer necessarily be a requirement for\nfirms with plans in place, and firms in this position no longer\nneed to be convinced of the need for planning. In addition,\nfirms may already have introduced crisis management plan-\nning because of need to comply with established industry\npractices, regulation, legislation, and standards. In such\nTable 2.

In contrast to the number 1 ranking for the media as a\nsource of information for non-planning firms, the media\nranked 7th of the 11 information sources for planning firms.\nAs noted above, this corresponds with a preference for expe-\nrience-based information sources. The different position of\nthe media in the ranking of sources provides a further indica-\ntion that firms with crisis management plans in place value\ninformation sources that are more context-specific whereas\nnon-planners, having not yet come to appreciate the value of\nexperiential information sources (once plans are in place)\nrate media as a useful information source. A further reason\nmay be found in the literature on trust and risk communica-\ntion cited earlier where experiential information is imbued\nwith higher levels of trust (and subsequent acceptance and\nuse) than other sources of information.\nPost-adoption, generic information is much less important\nsince planning firms already have an appreciation (or, at the\nvery least, an understanding) of the need for planning.\nExperience-oriented information sources such as the firm's\nown experiences of crises, insights from colleagues, impor-\ntant clients, and other firms within and beyond the industry\nmay present dynamic inputs to the process of recursive learn-\ning (Elliott & Macpherson, 2010), which allow for the adjust-\nment of provisions set within crisis management plans.\nExperiences also serve as reminders of the need for such\nplanning, the need for renewal of plans, and the hazards that\na business has faced or might encounter. Such experience-\nrelated information act as stimuli to the process of unlearning\nConclusion\nThe main contribution of this study is to highlight and\naddress a notable gap in the body of crisis management lit-\nerature, where post-crisis organizational and institutional\nlearning is long established, but consideration of how organi-\nzations can learn to introduce crisis management planning\n(and where new information sources are important) is largely\nignored. In adopting a learning for crisis perspective, this\nstudy has established that experiential information is per-\nceived by SME owner managers to be more important than\ngeneric advisory information.These preferences are observed\nbetween planning and non-planning firms. With planning in\nplace, these organizations indicated a strong preference to\nexperiential information sources as determined by the mea-\nsure of RVD. The additional measure of value distance from\nthreshold highlights the large distance that some sources are\nperceived to be from becoming useful for firms wishing to\nintroduce planning to deal with serious interruptions and\nincidents. Planning firms'preference for experience-oriented\ninformation about crisis management and business continu-\nity planning raises questions about how SMEs might be sup-\nported in both the initial development and renewal of their\nknowledge about these planning activities so that such feed-\nback and learning can improve their adaptive capacity\n(Staber & Sydow, 2002) as a continuous and dynamic learn-\ning process through which complexity and uncertainty are\nbetter understood. Support networks and forums for business\ncontinuity are well-established in a local government context\n(e.g., Local Resilience Forums) and for large firms in spe-\ncific sectors such as financial services (e.g., The Business\nContinuance Group), and the role of industry associations\nand business support agencies in bringing together SMEs to\nshare experiences and practices within and across areas of\neconomic activity would appear to be a valuable way to\nencourage greater firm-level and local economy business\nresilience.\nA number of directions for future research arise from this\nstudy. These include exploration and examination of why the\nvalued information sources for planning firms are distin-\nguished from the less valued ones--Is it the act of planning\nthat has shifted these perceptions or other factors? Could dis-\ntinctions be due to some sources being perceived to be more\nuseful as precursors to planning and others more useful as\nstimuli to maintain and develop crisis management plans\nwithin the organization? Second, what are the features of the\nsources of information that planning firms find useful and\nwhat is it that non-planning firms consider not useful, visi-\nble, or accessible? Examination of each information source\nin more detail (e.g., within media type, specific regulation,\nlegislation, and standards) will also illuminate our under-\nstanding of the comparative importance of these institutional\ninfluences for planning and non-planning firms. An emerg-\ning point of debate is whether agility (due to flexibility, rapid\ndecision making, and flatter structures) and resilience are\nmutually exclusive properties in SMEs that characterize their\npropensity for, and response to, serious interruptions and\nincidents (Gao, Sung, & Zhang, 2013; Sullivan-Taylor &\nBranicki, 2011). Are SMEs better able to respond to the del-\neterious effects of \"surprises\" that lead to improvisation and\nbricolage (Bechky & Ockhuysen, 2011) than to defend from\nor prevent such events using formal structures and knowl-\nedge? What role does information availability, type (experi-\nence versus didactic), and perceived value play in this\ncontext?\nAs the imperative for business resilience cascades across\nthe British economy and beyond, policy makers and business\nsupport agencies are increasingly seeking to engage with\nSMEs to support their resilience and enterprise growth.\nGiven the insights derived from this study, the dissonance\nbetween information provision and informational needs may\nreduce the value that such engagement could achieve.\nAccordingly, where business support agencies volunteer (or\n8 SAGE Open\nare compelled) to provide support to SMEs in relation to cri-\nsis management/business continuity planning, careful assess-\nment should be given to whether the information that they\nprovide loses relevance for firms with or without plans, and\nhow their information provision might be refined to provide\ninformation that is differentiated in terms of the transition of\nan SME between the absence and presence of formal pro-\ncesses to deal with crises.\nNote\n1. Readers will note that \"Crisis Management\" is used here as\nthe singular term for activities of interest in this article, but it\nis recognized that there can be differences in both the preferred\nform of reference and the scope of associated activities. For\ninstance, \"incident management\" is commonplace within civil\nemergencies, traffic control, construction, and health care set-\ntings (Ali Shah, Kim, Baek, Chang, &Ahn, 2008; McLennann,\n& Wu, 2012), whereas \"business continuity management\" is\ncommonplace in commercial and supply chain contexts (Clark,\ncrisis management may be considered an umbrella term rather\nthan the specific terms of reference used by and between orga-\nnizations in the context of an incident or interruption.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAlesi, P.
