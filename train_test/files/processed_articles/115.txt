Our 2002-\n2014 panel data set allows us to analyze the cross section and the dynamics of\nthe observed interbank exposures. Our findings suggest a genuine intermediation\nprocess within the banking system, with implications for allocative efficiency and\nfinancial stability. A typical bank in our sample holds a significant amount of term\nand overnight interbank positions on both sides of the balance sheet simultaneously,\nand at any point in time. The average contract length in the German interbank\nmarket is well above one year, which stands in contrast to the widely held view\nthat interbank exposures are largely overnight. Based on panel regressions, we\nfind the build-up of the interbank book to be driven by innovations in the client\nbook (i.e. non-bank deposit taking and lending). The resulting interbank book\naffects the bank's duration gap, the maturity disparity between bank assets and\nbank liabilities. A bank's duration gap is often seen as its major macroeconomic\nrisk factor. Overall our findings lend support to a theory of banking that involves\nleverage stacks, i.e intermediation among banks.\n",

A freeze of overnight\nlending among banks is one of the stylized facts that has allegedly characterized systemic\nrisk in the years since then. Despite its significance for the banking system, little is known\nabout the actual operation of the interbank market. This paper explores a data set cov-\nering exposures among banks in the largest European economy, Germany, for the period\n2002-2014, and it focuses on the economic role of interbank funding as a complement to\nbanks' client business. The panel data structure allows us to identify characteristics of\nexposures among banks in the cross-section, as well as their determinants over time.\nOur findings suggest that interbank markets play an important role in providing credit\nto the real economy, and for financial stability. We find three common features that\nprevail over the entire sample period. Interbank exposures are a significant part of a\ntypical bank's balance sheet, they are simultaneously held on both sides of the balance\nsheet, and they consist not only of overnight, but also of term exposures. An average\ncommercial bank in Germany holds 20-25 percent of its assets and liabilities in the form\nof interbank exposures, and the average maturity of its interbank book is well above one\nyear.\nMoreover, we study the dynamics of the interbank book (the sum of all interbank ex-\nposures at any moment in time) using panel regressions. We find that innovations in\nthe client book, i.e. the aggregate of all non-bank exposures (deposit inflows from, and\nlending outflows to retail and corporate clients) play a significant part in explaining the\ndynamics of the interbank book. The inflow of additional non-bank deposits to a particu-\nlar bank is correlated with the contemporaneous growth of its interbank lending exposure.\nSimilarly, the outflow of additional loans to non-bank corporate clients is correlated with\nan extension of that bank's interbank borrowing. Moreover, the build-up of the observed\ninterbank debt layer is roughly in the same maturity bucket as the underlying client\ntransactions. As a result, we observe an interbank book at the bank level that reflects\nthe underlying client book, in the sense of a mirror image.\nThe observation of a significant extent of interbank intermediation supports the recent\nsuggestion by Moore (2011) describing interbank markets as a way of stacking bank\nleverage. In his model, banks seek interbank exposures for inflows and outflows resulting\nfrom commercial banking business, i.e. deposit taking and lending. The bank book in\nhis model is derivative to the autonomous client book. This is largely consistent with our\nfindings, where marginal changes in the client book (deposit taking and lending) translate\nsignificantly into changes of the interbank book. Since these changes tend to be in the\nsame maturity bucket, the observed interbank book will have an impact on the bank's\nduration gap. This gap is defined as the difference between the weighted maturity of a\nbank's assets and liabilities, and it is seen as a major source of overall bank risk. More\nconcretely, the duration of a portfolio of assets allows us to forecast how its market value\nwill respond to a 1% change in the interest rate. The observed stacking of an interbank\nbook on top of a client book adds maturity transformation congruence to the balance\nsheet, thereby lowering the individual bank's overall interest rate risk. These results\npertain to the German commercial banking segment, and are robust if the entire banking\nsystem, including savings and cooperative banks, is considered.\nTaken together, our findings suggest a role for the interbank market beyond the provision\nof overnight liquidity for banks, which has been the essence of much of the theoretical\nliterature on the interbank market, notably Allen and Gale (2000), Freixas et al. (2000),\nand Freixas and Jorge (2008). Note that these liquidity insurance models of the interbank\nmarket suggest gross and net exposure vis-`\na-vis the interbank market are of comparable\nmagnitude, since, at any given moment in time, an interbank exposure tends to be only\non one side of the balance sheet. We find, however, that net and gross exposures differ\nto a significant degree, in line with the stacked leverage theory. While we find support\nfor a role as insurance provider, we also find that the interbank market allows banks to\nmanage their term structure risk. This explains the build-up of an interbank book, with\nexposures on both sides of the balance sheet. In this sense, the stacked leverage theory\ndeveloped in Moore (2011) is consistent with, and reaches beyond, Allen and Gale (2000).\nOur findings suggest active term structure management by banks through the interbank\nmarket.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe our data\nsources. Section 3 contains a descriptive analysis of these data, focusing on the extent\nand the duration of interbank exposures. Section 4 formulates the hypotheses, referring\nto theory and the stylized facts from the previous section, and it explains the empirical\nstrategy. Results are presented in section 5, while section 6 summarizes the findings and\ndiscusses further economic and macroeconomic implications of our observations.\nOur main data source is the balance sheet statistic (BISTA), which is collected at a\nmonthly frequency. Our data contain balance sheet variables for all German banks, in-\ncluding savings- and loans banks and cooperative banks, from February 2002 to December\n2014, i.e. for 155 months. We restrict ourselves to a balanced panel of commercial banks,\ni.e. to a sample where we have data for all variables of all banks in all months.1\n1Our results are robust if we use a larger sample containing all banks in Germany, including local\ncooperative banks (Genossenschaftsbanken), savings banks (Sparkassen) as well as their respective head\ninstitutions, the cooperative central banks (Genossenschaftszentralbanken) and the savings central banks\n(Landesbanken). For our main regressions, though, we exclude these banks in order to obtain a cleaner\nsample and results that are not driven by institutional details, in particular the two-tier structure found\nin part of the German banking sector.\n2.2 Variable Definitions\nOur main dependent variable is the normalized change in net interbank lending,  Net\nInterbank Lending, defined as the change in the difference between interbank assets and\nliabilities from the previous period to the current one, divided by the total asset size in\nthe previous period. In some of our specifications we use the change in gross interbank\nlending and borrowing from the previous period to the current period, divided by total\nasset size in the previous period, as the dependent variable. When no maturity segment\nis specified, we use the total of the dependent variable. For some regressions, however, we\ndistinguish between short- and longer-term segments. We define the short-term segment\nof the interbank market to be the overnight segment. Every interbank debenture with a\nmaturity longer than overnight is recorded in the term segment.2\nWe use four main independent variables. Loans are claims of banks (monetary financial\ninstitutions) on non-banks including firms, other financial intermediaries (e.g. insurance\ncompanies and pension funds), households, and the government (i.e. the domestic federal\ngovernment). Deposits are claims of non-banks including firms, other financial interme-\ndiaries, households, and the government on banks. We denote Loans with a maturity\nof up to one year as short-term, and all Loans with a longer maturity as long-term.\nOvernight Deposits are denoted overnight, while Deposits with a longer maturity are\ndenoted longer-term.3\nThe overnight interbank market is often described as the market for central bank reserves.\nLiquidity from the central bank has become increasingly important for commercial banks,\nin particular since the move to a full-allotment regime of monetary policy in October 2008.\nWe study the effects of unconventional monetary policy in some detail and therefore ex-\nplicitly include a bank's recourse to central bank liquidity in our regressions. Central\n2For interbank assets the maturity buckets are overnight, longer than overnight and up to one year,\nabove one year and up to five years, and above five years. For interbank liabilities, the maturity buckets\nare overnight, longer than overnight and up to one year, above one year and up to two years, and above\ntwo years.\n3The maturity buckets for Loans are up to one year, above one year, but below five years, and above\nfive years. The maturity buckets for Deposits are overnight, above overnight and up to one year, above\none year and up to two years, and above two years.\nBank Assets denotes all assets a bank holds at the Deutsche Bundesbank, i.e. mostly\nthe recourse to the deposit facility. However, Central Bank Assets also include assets\nwith a maturity more than overnight once the European Central Bank (ECB) starts its\nSecurities Market Programme. Central Bank Liabilities denote all claims the central\nbank has on a bank. The vast majority of these claims in normal times are the main\nconducted long-term refinancing operations with a maturity of one and three years, re-\nspectively. These operations are long-term liabilities of banks obtained from the Deutsche\nBundesbank.\nIn addition to our main dependent and independent variables, we use the change from the\nprevious to the current period in the amount of secured liabilities held by a bank, normal-\nized by the total assets of the bank as control variable. We saturate our main regression\nwith period fixed effects to account for changes, for example, in banks' accounting require-\nments, bank-fixed effects to account for constant cross-sectional heterogeneity, as well as\nyear times bank-fixed effects to capture further unobserved bank-specific time-varying\nheterogeneity.\n3 Descriptive Statistics of the German Interbank Mar-\nket\nWe will focus on four stylized facts about the German interbank market during the 2002-\n2014 period, which helps us to understand its role in the financial system. First, interbank\nlending accounts for a significant share of an average bank's balance sheet. Second, the\nnetwork of interbank loans is stable (persistent), even during the financial crisis years.\nThird, the average contract duration of interbank exposures exceeds one year; overnight\nexposures are only a fraction of the the overall positions held at any point in time. Fourth,\nbanks tend to hold significant interbank exposures on both sides of the balance sheet,\nmaking them intermediaries among banks. We discuss these stylized facts in turn.\nStylized fact no.1: Interbank lending accounts for a significant share of an average bank's\nbalance sheet. The German interbank market is the largest in the eurozone, and one of\nthe largest worldwide. It is notable not only in terms of its absolute size, but also because\ninterbank lending and borrowing account for a particularly large share of banks' balance\nsheets in Germany. Figure 1 shows the share of interbank borrowing to total assets for the\neuro area average, France, the United States, and Germany. Throughout the observation\nperiod, the size of the interbank market as measured by the share of interbank lending in\ntotal assets is significantly higher in the euro area (18%-21%) than in the US (1%-3%).\nAmong euro area countries, Germany has a relatively large interbank market; its average\ncorresponding values for France, for example, are lower, reaching 20% at the beginning of\nthe period and towards the end, with higher values in between, but are still much higher\nthan the values recorded for the US. The euro area share of interbank borrowing to total\nassets has been declining slightly since 2002, as has the value for the US. While the\nfigures for Germany have shrunk by more than one-third, they are still higher than the\neuro area average. The three-pillar structure of the German interbank market, with the\ncommercial bank sector, the cooperative bank sector, and the savings banks sector can\nonly partially explain this very high balance sheet share of interbank borrowing. Figure\n7 shows that domestic interbank lending and borrowing by commercial banks accounts\nsheet volume, which is still substantially larger than in the US.\nIf banks were to rely on the interbank market only for short-term liquidity needs, as is\nsuggested by the prevailing view of interbank markets, then the accumulating stock of in-\nterbank assets and liabilities should remain moderate and proportional to realized deposit\nand lending fluctuations. Figure 4 shows the average deposit fluctuations (measured by\nthe yearly standard deviation) relative to the average sum of interbank assets and liabili-\nties (measured by their yearly average), removing 2.5% of the smallest and largest values.\nEach point on the graph is based on a window ranging from t - 3 to t. Banks' interbank\nassets and liabilities are substantially larger than their average deposit and credit fluctu-\nations. These figures suggest that liquidity considerations relating to stochastic deposit\nflows alone cannot explain the size of the observed interbank exposures.\nStylized fact no.2: The network of interbank loans is stable (persistent), even during the\nfinancial crisis years.\nThe interbank market is an over-the-counter market and can best be characterized as a\nnetwork of credit relationships. A network is a set of nodes together with a set of links\nbetween these nodes. Being interested in the interbank market, the nodes in our network\nare banks and the links between them are credit relationships, i.e. interbank loans. One\nway to quantify how a network changes over time is to compute the Jaccard index of links,\nwhich is defined as the number of links that exist in two subsequent periods divided by\nthe number of links that exist in one period only. Figure 2 shows the Jaccard index for\nthe interbank network of all German commercial banks. With a time-averaged Jaccard\nindex of 0.84, the German interbank network is highly stable over our sample period\nfrom 2002 to 2014. A further metric for the stability of the network is the unconditional\nrelationship duration. For this, we calculate the fraction of time over the sample period in\nwhich there exists a particular lending relationship involving the same two counterparties,\ngiven its existence in at least one period. The value is called \"unconditional\" since it is an\naverage over all contract maturities. This unconditional average over all banks amounts\nto 0.44, implying its existence for almost half of the sample period. That is, if one bank\nstarts lending to another bank, the duration of that lending relationship lasts for roughly\n0.44 \u00d7 43 = 19 quarters. The long duration of interbank relationships is consistent with\nthe relatively sparse network architecture, which characterizes the German interbank\nmarket. Figure 3 shows an index of interconnectedness, defined as the number of existing\nlinks relative to the number of possible links, that is, Nt\n\u00d7(Nt\n-1) with Nt\nthe number of\nbanks observed in period t. The index shows that, on average, the network is relatively\nsparse with only 6% to 11% of the theoretically possible links existing. This is consistent\nwith a high degree of stability in the German interbank network.\nStylized fact no.3: The average contract duration of interbank exposures exceeds one\nyear; overnight exposures are only one part of the the overall positions held at any point\nin time.\nFigure 7 summarizes the consolidated maturity structure of both sides of the interbank\nbook, the assets side and the liability side. A look at the maturity structure of the German\ninterbank market can help to establish a rationale for all observed stylized facts. We\ndiscuss overnight market segments first, then longer term. In our dataset, four disjunct\nterm segments are used on the asset side. A: overnight, B: less than 1 year, C: less than\n5 years, D: more than 5 years. There are also four term segments on the liabilities side,\nalthough the classifications differ slightly: A: overnight, B: less than 1 year, C': less than\n2 years, D': more than 2 years. For the consolidated book of the banking sector, the\nfraction of overnight interbank lending and borrowing (the A-segment) remains roughly\noscillates around 4% of the aggregate bank balance sheet volume.\nFor the B segment, we also find a very similar development peaking in Q4/2007 at\nslightly above 10% (borrowing) and 13% (lending) and then steadily declining until 5%\nis reached in 2012. The lending graph is above the borrowing graph for most of the\nsample period. This indicates that, in the relevant term segment, the interbank market\nis not entirely restricted to Germany, with some net lending to banks in other countries.\nThe international interbank flows are particularly prominent in the years preceding 2008.\nThereafter, the wedge between aggregate borrowing and lending reverts to the level at\nthe beginning of the sample.\nThe size of the maturity segment C with initial contractual terms between 1 year and 5\nyears, and the corresponding segment C' with contractual terms between 1 year and 2\nyears, is of the same order of magnitude as the overnight segment. Market segments D\nand D', including interbank loans with at-issue maturities of more than five (two) years, is\nsubstantial, averaging slightly above 10% of balance sheet size. Here, borrowing exceeds\nlending over most of the sample period. The wedge amounts to one-tenth of aggregate\ninterbank lending, indicating a net inflow from abroad, i.e. from banking institutions\noutside our data set. Note that our data do not distinguish between secured and unse-\ncured interbank debentures. In particular since the financial crisis, market participants\nhave repeatedly reported that the unsecured term interbank market plays almost no role\nfor their refinancing and that most of interbank lending is only secured.\nStylized fact no.4: Banks tend to hold significant interbank exposures on both sides of\nthe balance sheet, making them intermediaries among banks.\nThe fourth stylized fact refers to the extent to which there is interbank intermediation in\nthe market.\nFigure 8 shows an estimate of interbank intermediation, the fraction of banks which\nhave, at the same time, significant interbank exposures on both sides of their balance\nsheet, assets and liabilities. Exposures are defined as being significant in volume if, at\na given point in time, the amount of interbank assets is larger than 25% of the amount\nof interbank liabilities, while, at the same time, the amount of interbank liabilities is\nlarger than 25% of the amount of interbank assets. On average, over 75% of all banks\nhold significant interbank positions simultaneously in any given year between 2002 and\n2014. The range of variation is less than 5 pecentage points over most of the sample\nperiod. Between mid-2007 and early 2009, the height of the financial crisis, the interbank\nintermediation index rises above 80%. Thus, and in contrast to the widely held view of a\nfrozen interbank market, we find an increase in reliance on intermediation among banks,\nas defined by simultaneous holdings of gross interbank exposures. The index falls back to\nits earlier level of around 75% in early 2009 and stays at that level for the remaining years.\nWhat can be observed, though, is that the intermediation index for the term interbank\nmarket decreases continuously, by over 15 percentage points between September 2008 and\nIn Figure 10 the sum of gross exposures vis-`\na-vis banks on both sides of the balance sheet\nis related to their difference, i.e. net exposure. Sums are taken without regard to the\nidentity of counterparties, i.e. netting is allowed within the balance sheet position even\nif the identity of counterparties is not necessarily the same. This is because we want to\nestimate the extent to which there is significant concurrent exposure on both sides of the\nbalance sheet. We label the ratio of gross interbank exposure to net interbank exposure\nthe 'funding gap'. For example, if a bank borrows large amounts from another bank\nand uses the funds for granting new loans rather than intermedition to other banks, the\nresulting interbank funding gap is large (well above +1). Similarly, if the bank uses funds\nfrom its deposit business for which is has no suitable loan demand for intermediation to\nsome other bank, the gap variable will once again be a high positive number, well above\n+1. If, however, most of the funds lent to banks were funded by borrowing from other\nbanks, the funding gap is small. In the limit, when both positions are equal, the gap\nvariable approaches 0.\n4 Hypotheses and Empirical Strategy\nThe observations reported in the previous section suggest that there is intermediation\nin the interbank market. Banks lend to banks and borrow from banks simultaneously,\nand do so persistently. This is not easy to reconcile with a pure short-term liquidity\ninsurance view of interbank markets, which posits that the interbank overnight market\nis predominantly used to buffer (i.e. go long or short) fluctuations in the cash account.\nNo longer term interbank exposures are needed in this case, nor is there a rationale for\nentering into long and short interbank position simultaneously.\nUltimately, a theory of the interbank market as an integral part of the finanial interme-\ndiation process is needed. The question to be answered is: \"What role does the interme-\ndiation among intermediaries play in bridging the informational and preferential funding\ngap between households (as ultimate lenders) and firms (as ultimate borrowers)?\" Here,\ninformational gaps refer to asymmetric information and moral hazard, and preferential\ngaps refer to liquidity and safety preferences. Banking theory in the spirit of Diamond\n(1984) and Diamond and Rajan (2001) does not have much to say about second-level fi-\nnancial intermediation. Even if the interbank market is explicitly considered, as in Allen\nand Gale (2000), and in Freixas and Jorge (2008), longer-term interbank relationships\nare difficult to explain. Further attempts to consider interbank markets can be found\nfirst explicit attempt to model interbank intermediation, commensurate with what we\nobserve in the German interbank market, is John Moore's Presidential Address at the\nEconometric Society in 2011 (Moore (2011)). He models a two-level intermediation pro-\ncess, called leverage stacks, in which longer-term interbank relationships create a peer\nmonitoring mechanism that allows uninformed depositors to trust in the screening and\nmonitoring capabilities of 'their' bank. In Moore's model, this mechanism permits an\nefficient channeling of funds from households to entrepreneurs.\nMoore's model is consistent with many of our stylized facts. In particular, it supports\nthe existence of an interbank book on top of the usual client book held by a bank. It\nalso explains why interbank relationships are large in absolute and relative terms, why\nthey are persistent, and why they gross-up on both sides of the balance sheet rather\nthan being netted continuously. However, what the leverage stacks model does not yet\ncapture is the importance of term structure characteristics we have identified in the data.\nIn other words, the large share of longer-term exposures in the interbank intermediation\nmechanics still needs explanation.\nWe want to advance the hypothesis that the interbank market is used by banks to manage\nthe duration gap inherent in their client book.\nRecall that the client book comprises the whole of loans outstanding, and deposits in-\ntake to/from customers (households and non-bank corporates). These exposures are\nautonomous from the point of view of the bank, because they are generated by inde-\npendent decisions of third parties. Households, for example, allocate their cash to bank\naccounts at their own discretion concerning timing (now or later) and term (overnight\ndeposit or long-term bond). The resulting balance sheet aggregates can be described by\ntheir weighted average contract length, called 'duration' (see Weil (1973)). The differ-\nence of asset duration minus liabilities duration is the 'duration gap', or 'duration risk';\nit captures the sensitivity of bank equity capital to a shift of the term structure of in-\nterest rates. In Hellwig (1994), the duration gap is widely seen as describing the main\ninterest rate risk of banks. Thus, duration risk stemming from the client book is largely\nexogenous to the bank. However, the duration risk stemming from the interbank book\nis fully endogenous, i.e. the portfolio to assets and liabilities in the interbank book, and\ntheir respective maturities are, by and large, autonomously set by bank management.\nThink of the interbank market as a common resource to which to lend when there is\nan unexpectedly large deposit inflow, and from which to borrow when there is an unex-\npectedly large credit draw-down. By carefully selecting the maturities for these derived\n(endogenous) transactions with other banks, the bank regains some autonomy over its\nduration risk. To give an extreme example, consider a bank with exogenous changes of\nits assets (credit draw-downs in the client book) and equally exogenous changes of its\nliabilities (deposits in the client book). If the bank chooses to offset each autonomous\nchange of exposure with an offsetting transaction of equal size and equal maturity in the\ninterbank market, then, effectively, the client book is augmented by an interbank book\nthat is an exact mirror image of the underlying client book. In this case, duration risk is\nzero.\nIn reality, several other considerations will be relevant for bank management when the\nduration gap of the interbank book is determined - however, we expect to find a tendency\nto lower the duration risk inherent in the client book. In our view, the client book is\nautonomous and the interbank book is a derivative book - derivative to the client book.\nThe duration gap is an important variable not only for bank risk management and profit\noptimization, but also for macroeconomic risks and macroprudential policies. Based on\nthe stylized facts, and the theory outlined above, we derive several hypotheses to be\ntested empirically.\nHypothesis 1 (Interbank exposures): At the bank level, total innovations in (changes\nof) net interbank exposure, after netting assets and liabilities, are driven by concurrent\nunderlying client business (the client book).\nThe client book in Hypothesis 1 refers to retail and wholesale non-bank lending and\ndeposit taking. The hypothesis states that transactions with the classical bank clients,\nhouseholds and firms, can explain, at least partially, the changes observed concurrently\nin the bank's interbank accounts (i.e., its interbank book).\nHypothesis 2 (Interbank maturities): At the bank level, innovations in interbank assets\nand interbank liabilities are driven by underlying client business, primarily in the same\nmaturity bucket.\nThe idea behind Hypothesis 2 is the management of bank duration risk. Assuming\nthe changes in the bank's client book to be largely autonomous from the point of view\nof the bank, it can respond to undesired changes in its duration gap by constructing\noffsetting transactions in the interbank book. This solves, at the same time, its desire for\nefficient use of funds (minimizing storing liquidity reserves as idle funds) and its desire\nfor controlling its overall duration risk. The fact that we do not know the bank's target\nduration risk is also the reason why the hypothesis refers to the same maturity bucket as\na primary, but not the sole, determinant of interbank lending decisions.\nHypothesis 3 (Interbank exposure accumulation): The interbank book, consisting of bor-\nrowing and lending positions, grows over time by accumulating gross interbank exposures\nvis-`\na-vis counterparties rather than netting exposures.\nHypothesis 3 focuses on the dynamics of the interbank book. It claims that autonomous\ntransactions in the client book trigger (to some extent, see Hypothesis 2) an offsetting\nof transactions in the interbank book on a transaction-by-transaction basis. Netting\npositions vis-`\na-vis the same counterparty, and/or within the same maturity bucket would\nbe feasible, say by recontracting, but this will not be done. The reason can be found in the\nprimary objective of the interbank book in providing low-cost access to liquid resources\n(i.e. being able to serve their retail and corporate clients at once), while simultaneously\nmanaging the overall duration risk that has to be borne by the bank's owners.\nHypotheses 1-3 establish the most important characteristics of interbank intermediation:\nlarge exposures on both sides of the balance sheet of a majority of banks, the dynamics of\nwhich are driven by the underlying client business, i.e. autonomous inflows and outflows\nfrom business relations with retail and non-bank corporate customers. The resulting\npattern \"stacks\" an interbank book on top of the underlying client book. The combined\nclient plus interbank book achieves (or helps to achieve) a bank's desired duration risk.\nThe mechanics of this interbank intermediation system is of interest not only from a\nbank management viewpoint, but also from a macroeconomic policy perspective. Sev-\neral questions suggest themselves. For example, what are the implications of interbank\nintermediation for the efficient allocation of funds in the economy? What implications\ndoes interbank intermediation have for effectiveness of monetary policy? And, perhaps\nmost importantly, what are the possible consequences for financial stabilty? We will defer\nthese and other questions for a follow-up paper, and wish now to limit our macroeconomic\nperspective to an issue that is implicit in much of the descriptives already presented and\ndiscussed in Section 2: the changing dimension and working of the interbank intermedia-\ntion model during the crisis years. For this purpose, we will distinguish between the first\nhalf of our data set, the pre-Lehman years 2002-2008, and the crisis years post-Lehman\nHypothesis 4 (Interbank intermediation pre- and post-Lehman): Abundant central bank\nliquidity supply serves as a partial substitute for the interbank market.\nThe argument leading to Hypothesis 4 relies on the double role of the interbank market\nin serving as a mutual liquidity reservoir for all banks in the system, and, at the same\ntime, as a tool for managing the duration risk. The former role can be substituted by\ncheap and abundant central bank liquidity provision.\nTo test H1, which conjectures that overall innovations in interbank exposure are driven\nby concurrent underlying client business, we estimate Equation (1)\n(Net Interbank Lending)it\nAssetsi,t-1\n=\n\nj\nDepositsi,t-j\nAssetsi,t-j-1\n+\n\nj\nLoansi,t-j\nAssetsi,t-j-1\n+Controls + i\n+ t\n+ iT\n+ it\nwhere all variables are aggregates across all maturities. For example, the explanatory\nvariable `Loans' which captures bank credit to the real economy includes all loans up\nto one year (which is the shortest available maturity for the variable in our data set)\nand beyond. Our hypothesis is confirmed if we find a statistically significant and positive\ncoefficient of the change in deposits (relative to total assets), 0\n, and a statistically signif-\nicant negative coefficient of the change in the loan supply (relative to total assets), 0\n. We\nexplicitly control for the amount of secured liabilities, but we control for most unobserved\nheterogeneity through fixed effects. In addition to period fixed-effects, which capture time\ntrends and changes in reporting standards (e.g. the Act Modernising Accounting Law in\nDecember 2010), we saturate our regressions with bank-fixed effects, and ultimately by\nusing bank times year-fixed effects to control for any unobserved heterogeneity at the\nbank level.\nNote that an important underlying assumption is that loans and deposits are contempora-\nneously exogenous with respect to banks' interbank lending and borrowing. First, deposit\nfluctuations depend largely on customers' preferences and are therefore outside the con-\ntrol of the bank (though they can be influenced in the long run, for example through\nan advertising campaign or by setting up a larger branch network). Second, loans are\njointly determined by demand and supply, that is, the variable is partially controlled by\nthe bank. However, when banks grant a loan, they create money `ex nihilo', that is,\nthey create the deposits that are subsequently used by the customer. It is only when\nthe customer draws on the deposits that the bank faces an outflow of liquidity which it\neventually has to replace. Therefore, loan creation takes place before any liquidity shock\ncan occur. If a bank wants to grant a profitable loan, but fears that it cannot refinance\nsubsequent liquidity outflows on the interbank market, it can always turn to the central\nbank's (frequent) main refinancing facility (such as the ECB's weekly tender). Therefore,\nwe argue that reverse causality issues do not arise in our regressions. In any case, all our\nresults are robust across specifications in which only lags of the explanatory variables are\nused.\nTo test our second hypothesis, which conjectures that innovations in net interbank expo-\nsure are driven by underlying client business, primarily in the same maturity bucket, we\nextend Equation (1) by a maturity dimension. Testing for the hypothesis in the overnight\nsegment is then carried out via estimating Equation (2)\n(Net Interbank Lending)ST\nit\nAssetsi,t-1\n=\n\nj\nDepositsST\ni,t-j\nAssetsi,t-j-1\n+\n\nj\nLoansST\ni,t-j\nAssetsi,t-j-1\n\nj\nDepositsLT\ni,t-j\nAssetsi,t-j-1\n+\n\nj\nLoansLT\ni,t-j\nAssetsi,t-j-1\n+Controls + i\n+ t\n+ iT\n+ it\nwhere variables are defined as previously and ST and LT denote short-term (overnight)\nand longer-term (>overnight), respectively. Our hypothesis is confirmed if in Equation\n(2) we find the coefficient of (i) changes in overnight deposits, 0\n, significantly positive\nand (ii) bigger than that of changes in longer-term deposits, 0\n, as well as (iii) changes\nin short-term loans, 0\n, significantly negative and (iv) smaller than that of changes in\nlong-term loans, 0\n.\nTesting for our second hypothesis in the longer-term segment is carried out with Equation\n(Net Interbank Lending)LT\nit\nAssetsi,t-1\n=\n\nj\nDepositsST\ni,t-j\nAssetsi,t-j-1\n+\n\nj\nLoansST\ni,t-j\nAssetsi,t-j-1\n\nj\nDepositsLT\ni,t-j\nAssetsi,t-j-1\n+\n\nj\nLoansLT\ni,t-j\nAssetsi,t-j-1\n+Controls + i\n+ t\n+ iT\n+ it\nwhere only the dependent variable has been replaced with respect to Equation (2). Our\nhypothesis is confirmed if in Equation (3) we find the coefficient of (i) changes in longer-\nterm deposits, 0\n, significantly positive and (ii) bigger than that of changes in overnight\ndeposits, 0\n, as well as (iii) changes in long-term loans, 0\n, significantly negative and (iv)\nsmaller than that of changes in short-term loans, 0\n.\nTo test our third hypothesis, which conjectures that the interbank book grows over time\nby accumulating gross interbank exposures towards counterparties rather than netting\nwith extant exposures, we estimate Equations (4) and (5) given below.\n(Gross Interbank Assets)LT\nit\nAssetsi,t-1\n=\n\nj\nDepositsLT\ni,t-j\nAssetsi,t-j-1\n+\n\nj\nLoansLT\ni,t-j\nAssetsi,t-j-1\n+Controls + i\n+ t\n+ iT\n+ it\n(Gross Interbank Liabilities)LT\nit\nAssetsi,t-1\n=\n\nj\nDepositsLT\ni,t-j\nAssetsi,t-j-1\n+\n\nj\nLoansLT\ni,t-j\nAssetsi,t-j-1\n+Controls + i\n+ t\n+ iT\n+ it\nwhere the dependent variables are now defined in individual gross terms as opposed to\ntheir joint net terms in previous regressions and, to save space, the main short-term\nexplanatory variables are included in our set of control variables. Note that our previous\nregressions to test Hypotheses 1 and 2 cannot by construction provide conclusive evidence\nin favor or against this hypothesis. For example, as will become clear below, an increase\nin the long-term loan supply results in a decreasing net longer-term liquidity supply to the\ninterbank market. However, this reduction can be due either to (i) increased borrowing\non the interbank market (which, as conjectured by our third hypothesis, leads to an\nincrease of the interbank book), (ii) a reduction of interbank lending (which leads to a\ndecrease in gross exposures), or (iii) both. Note that we focus only on the longer-term\nsegments here, because frequent lending and borrowing at long maturities can provide an\nexplanation for the gross interbank position being bigger than the net interbank position\nif banks \u00adinstead of canceling extant interbank positions\u00ad take on offsetting interbank\npositions. By contrast, in the overnight segment it is always possible to not roll over\nextant positions, resulting in less scope for building up larger gross positions than net\nones. Extending the above example, a bank featuring a longer-term deposit inflow could\nabsorb this shock to its balance sheet either by increasing its longer-term liquidity supply\nto the interbank market (its bank book grows) or by canceling an extant longer-term\ninterbank borrowing relation (its bank book shrinks).\nWe find evidence to support our third hypothesis if (i) the effect of changes in longer-\nterm deposits on gross longer-term interbank assets, 0\n, is significantly positive and,\n(ii) bigger than the effect of changes in longer-term deposits on the change in gross\nlonger-term interbank liabilities, 0\n, and if, (iii) the effect of long-term loans on gross\nlonger-term interbank liabilities, 0\n, is significantly negative and, (iv) smaller than the\neffect of changes in long-term loans on the change in gross longer-term interbank assets,\n. Note that testing Hypothesis 3 requires testing linear restrictions involving parameter\nestimates from Equations 4 and 5. Both equations therefore are estimated in a seemingly\nunrelated regressions framework.\nTo test our fourth hypothesis, which conjectures that central bank liquidity serves as\npartial substitute for the interbank market, we compare coefficient estimates in our re-\ngressions in a sample of data prior to the recent financial crisis and a sample which\nfeatures the financial crisis and period with abundant central bank liquidity support.\nOur fourth hypothesis is confirmed if coefficients are systematically smaller in absolute\nvalue in our sample comprising the financial crisis.\nTo test our four hypotheses we run three sets of regressions. In all following analyses\nthe Chow breakpoint test indicates a structural break in October 2008. Therefore, we\nsplit our sample regressions into three data sets, a full set covering February 2002 to\ncovering October 2008 to December 2014. Quite naturally, the sample has a pre-Lehman\nportion which is covered in the first subset and a post-Lehman portion featuring the acute\nphases of the financial and (European) sovereign debt crises, which are in the second\nsubset. We conjecture that, in the former period, the interbank market operates under\n`normal' conditions\u00adalthough we know that years running up to the crisis are special as\nwell\u00adwhile in the latter period the interbank market operates under `crisis' conditions,\nnot least indicated by the non-standard central bank interventions taking place during\nthat period. For investigating our first three hypotheses, we concentrate on the `normal'\nsample, while, for analyzing our fourth hypothesis, we compare results from our `normal'\nand `crisis' samples. Note that we also provide estimation results over the full sample in\nall analyses.\nTo investigate if banks' net liquidity supply to the interbank market is driven by client\nbusiness (Hypothesis 1), we estimate Equation (1). Remember that confirmation of\nto be positive and 0\nto be negative (tested individually). Estimation\nresults are displayed in Table 1, which is subdivided into results obtained from our full\nsample, the `normal' sample, and the `crisis' sample. For each sample we run three\nspecifications, which include different sets of dummy variables in addition to our main\nexplanatory variables (changes in banks' deposit and loan business), and a set of further\ncontrols (changes in securitized liabilities as well as central bank assets and liabilities):\nspecifications 1, 4, and 7 feature bank-fixed effects, specifications 2, 5, and 8 feature bank\nand month-fixed effects, and specifications 3, 6, and 9 feature bank, month and bank-year\nfixed effects.\nFirst we concentrate on estimation results from the `normal' sample (models 4 to 6 on\nTable 1). Note that, in all following regressions, we concentrate only on contemporaneous\nregressors, because their effects are much bigger than those of the lagged regressors. Fur-\nthermore, lagged effects, generally feature the same sign as the contemporaneous effects,\nbut mostly turn insignificant after more than three lags. In all three specifications, an\nincrease in the loan supply (relative to total assets) by 1 percentage point decreases the\nnet interbank supply (relative to total assets) by about 0.91 (model 4) to 0.93 (model\n6) percentage points (rounded to two decimal places). That is, faced with liquidity out-\nflows subsequent to assigning new loans to the real economy results in less net interbank\nlending (or equivalently, more net interbank borrowing). Note that effects are statisti-\ncally significant at the 1% significance level. Furthermore, an increase in deposits by 1\npercentage point increases net interbank lending by 0.91 percentage points. Effects are\nstatistically significant at the 1% significance level. These results show that banks facing\nliquidity inflows react by channeling part of these funds to the interbank market. The\nmodel fit is generally quite good \u00ad the adjusted R2 ranges from 0.83 (model 5) to 0.84\nNote that our findings remain robust when we focus on the `full' sample (models 1 to 3),\nthough remember that it contains a structural break. This is also reflected in a decreasing\nadjusted R2 by about 7 percentage points. Overall, our results provide strong evidence\nin favor of our first hypothesis. Banks' client business is indeed an important driver of\nbanks' net liquidity supply to the interbank market. Note that results turn out robust\nacross model specifications. In the following sets of regressions we concentrate only on a\nspecification with the full set of dummies.\nTo investigate if innovations in interbank assets and liabilities by maturity bracket are\ndriven by underlying client business in the same maturity bracket (Hypothesis 2), we\nestimate Equations (2) and (3) with the former featuring net overnight interbank lending\nand the latter net longer-term (with a maturity beyond overnight) interbank lending,\nrespectively. Both configurations feature banks short and longer-term client businesses\nas explanatory variables and a set of further control variables and dummies. Recall that\novernight deposits and loans feature a maturity of overnight and up to one year, respec-\ntively, while longer-term deposits and loans feature a maturity beyond these respective\nshort-term values. Differences in maturity brackets are primarily determined by the data\nset's partition.\nFirst, consider the overnight segment of the interbank market. Remember that for Equa-\ntion (2) confirmation of H2 requires obtaining a coefficient of (i) changes in overnight\ndeposits, 0\n, significantly positive and (ii) bigger than that of changes in longer-term\ndeposits, 0\n, as well as (iii) changes in short-term loans, 0\n, significantly negative and\n(iv) smaller than that of changes in long-term loans, 0\n. Note that, here and below, we\ncarry out tests for linear combinations of coefficient estimates using one-sided z-tests.\nTable 2 displays estimation results for Equation (2). Note that we include the change in\nnet longer-term interbank lending as an additional control variable in order to capture\nsubstitution effects between longer-term and overnight interbank segments. In the normal\nsample (model 2) an increase in short-term or long-term loans by 1 percentage point\nsignificantly decreases banks' net overnight interbank lending by 0.71 or 0.70 percentage\npoints, respectively. The effect of short-term loans is not significantly bigger (in absolute\nterms) than that of long-term loans (p-value of 0.12 indicates only marginal significance).\nAn increase in short or longer-term deposits by 1 percentage point significantly increases\nnet overnight interbank lending by 0.80 or 0.66 percentage points, respectively. The effect\nof overnight deposits is significantly stronger than that of longer-term deposits (p-value\nof 0.05). Notice that an adjusted R2 of 0.76 indicates a good model fit. Overall, we find\nsome statistical evidence in favor of our hypothesis for the overnight interbank market,\nin particular as regards effects of overnight deposits.\nSecond, consider investigating H2 for the longer-term segment of the interbank market.\nRemember that for Equation (3), confirmation of H2 requires the coefficient of (i) changes\nin longer-term deposits, 0\n, to be significantly positive and (ii) bigger than that of changes\nin overnight deposits, 0\n, as well as (iii) changes in long-term loans, 0\n, to be significantly\nnegative and (iv) smaller than that of changes in short-term loans, 0\n. Note that we\ninclude the change in net overnight interbank lending as an additional control variable in\norder to capture substitution effects between long and overnight interbank lending and\nborrowing.\nTable 3 displays estimation results for Equation (3). In the `normal' sample (model 2)\nan increase in long-term loans by 1 percentage point decreases net longer-term liquidity\nsupply to the interbank market by 0.84 percentage points, while an increase in longer-\nterm deposits increases the longer-term net liquidity supply to the interbank market by\n0.49 percentage points. Effects are significant at the 1% significance level. Note that\nboth changes in overnight deposits and loans also yield significant results (at the 1%\nlevel) featuring the expected sign. For example, an increase in overnight deposits by 1\npercentage point increases the net longer-term liquidity supply to the interbank market by\n0.49 percentage points. This provides evidence that banks with overnight liquidity inflows\ncarry out some maturity transformation. Furthermore, an increase in short-term loans\nby 1 percentage point lowers the net longer-term liquidity supply to the interbank market\nby 0.29 percentage points. Note that, while we find a significantly bigger coefficient in\nabsolute value for the long-term loan variable than for the short-run loan variable (p-\nvalue of 0.00), the coefficients for the deposit variable are of similar magnitude and not\nsignificantly different. Therefore, we also find partial evidence in favor of our second\nhypothesis, in particular as regards banks' client loan business. The effect of innovations\nin net overnight interbank lending indicates that the short and longer-term segments\nof the interbank market are, to some extent, substitutes \u00adan increase in net overnight\ninterbank lending by 1 percentage point causes a decline in net longer-term interbank\nlending of 0.23 percentage points. The adjusted R2 of 0.58 indicates a good model fit.\nAll results are also robust in the full sample (model 1).\nIn conjunction, results on Tables 3 and 2 adduce evidence that changes in net short and\nlonger-term interbank lending are driven by client business in the same maturity bracket.\nFurthermore, client business from different maturity brackets also features economical\nand statistical significance and can be explained by banks' maturity transformation.\nOur third hypothesis conjectures that the interbank book grows over time via the accu-\nmulation of longer-term interbank positions on both sides of the balance sheet driven by\nbanks longer-term client business. Remember that our third hypothesis is confirmed if (i)\nthe effect of changes in longer-term deposits on gross longer-term interbank assets, 0\n, is\nsignificantly positive and, (ii) bigger than the effect of changes in deposits on the change\nin gross longer-term interbank liabilities, 0\n, and if, (iii) the effect of long-term loans on\ngross longer-term interbank liabilities, 0\n, is significantly negative and, (iv) smaller than\nthe effect of loans on the change in gross longer-term interbank assets 0\n.\nTables 4 and 5 display estimation results for Equations (4) and (5), respectively. Both\nequations are jointly estimated in a seemingly unrelated regressions framework in order\nto carry out linear hypothesis tests across equations. To verify if H3 is confirmed, we\nagain focus on the normal sample, that is, model 2 in both tables. First, consider the\neffect of changes in long-term loans on gross longer-term interbank assets. In Table 4 the\neffect is insignificant. However,changes in short-term loans which feature a maturity of\nup to one year are significantly negative. An increase in short-term loans by 1 percentage\npoint lowers gross longer-term interbank assets by 0.45 percentage points. In Table 5\n(featuring results for changes in gross longer-term interbank liabilities as the dependent\nvariable) the effect of changes in long-term loans is significant and of (expected) positive\nsign. An increase in long-term loans by 1 percentage point results in an increase in gross\nlonger-term interbank liabilities of 0.84 percentage points. Also here, short-term loans\nare significant and of expected positive sign but much smaller magnitude. An increase\nin short-term loans by one percentage point results in an increase of gross longer-term\ninterbank liabilities by 0.05 perceantage points. Importantly, the effect of long-term loans\non gross longer-term interbank liabilities (Table 5) is significantly bigger in absolute value\n(p-value of 0.00) than its effect on gross longer-term interbank assets (Table 4), providing\nconfirmation of our third hypothesis.\nNext, consider the effect of changes in longer-term deposits on banks' gross longer-term\ninterbank assets. In Table 4, model 2, the effect is significantly positive. An increase\nin longer-term deposits by 1 percentage point results in an increase in gross longer-\nterm interbank assets of 0.35 percentage points. Changes in overnight deposits feature\na stronger effect (0.53), indicating that banks carry out some maturity transformation.\nIn both cases effects are of expected sign and significant at the 1% significance level. In\nTable 5 (change in gross longer-term interbank liabilities), the effect of changes in longer-\nterm deposits is also significant and of expected (negative) sign. An increase in longer-\nterm deposits by 1 percentage point leads to a decline in gross longer-term interbank\nliabilities of 0.10 percentage points. Note that here, too, we find confirmation of our\nthird hypothesis, that is, the effect of an increase in longer-term deposits on building\nup new interbank exposures (gross longer-term interbank assets) is significantly larger\nin absolute value (p-value of 0.00) than the effect of reducing extant positions (gross\nlonger-term interbank liabilities).\nIn conjunction, results from Tables 4 and 5 provide evidence in favor of our third hypoth-\nesis. That is, in the face of positive innovations in their longer-term client book, banks\nincrease their bank book, resulting in bigger gross interbank positions than net ones. Note\nhowever, that results in both tables also indicate that banks do not exclusively build up\nnew interbank positions to buffer shocks, but also reduce extant exposures, possibly not\nrolling over maturing debt positions.\nFinally, to investigate our fourth hypothesis, which conjectures that abundant central\nbank liquidity serves as partial substitute for the interbank market, we compare our\nprevious estimation results from the `normal' sample with those of the 'crisis' sample.\nRemember that the sample split is found by a Chow test, indicating a statistical break\nduring the Lehman bankruptcy. That is, there is already statistical evidence for a regime\nchange of the interbank market with the onset of the financial crisis.\nFirst, consider both samples on Table 1 and remember that this table provides results for\nour estimations on banks' change in net interbank lending as a function of innovations in\ntheir client business. For all three specifications, the magnitude of effects is significantly\nbigger in the `normal sample' (by roughly 20 %) for both loan and deposit innovations (p-\nvalues less than 0.05). For example, while an increase in loans by 1 percentage point leads\nto a decrease of net interbank lending by 0.93 percentage points in our normal sample\n(model 6), the same change in the explanatory variable leads only to a decline in net\ninterbank lending of 0.78 percentage points during our `crisis' sample (model 9). Second,\nconsider Table 2, which gives results for explaining changes in net overnight interbank\nlending by banks' client business in different maturity segments. For both, changes in\ndeposits and loans in both maturity segments the effects become significantly weaker (p-\nvalues less than 0.01) in the `crisis' sample (the effects of changes in short and long-term\nloans are reduced by about 60% and 70%, respectively, and the effects of short and longer-\nterm deposits are reduced by more than 50%). Third, the same picture emerges when\ninvestigating differences between effects in Table 3, which gives results for the change in\nnet longer-term interbank lending explained by changes in different maturity segments of\nbanks' client business. It also confirms that the magnitude of effects significantly shrinks\nin the `crisis' sample (p-values below 0.05). While the effects of innovations in short\nand longer-term deposits shrink by more than 50%, the effect of changes in short-term\nloan innovations is reduced by roughly 30%, and the effect of changes in long-term loans\nvanishes almost entirely. Fourth, consider Tables 4 and 5, which explain banks' changes\nin longer-term interbank assets and interbank liabilities, respectively, using banks' short-\nterm and longer-term client business. Here, too, effects become significantly smaller (in\nabsolute value) except for the effect of long-term loans on longer-term interbank assets\n(Equation 4, estimation results displayed on Table 4), which is insignificantly different\nfrom zero in the normal and the crisis samples. The effect of longer-term deposits on\nbanks' gross longer-term interbank assets shrinks by about 50%. The coefficient in the\nnormal sample is significantly bigger with a p-value of 0.01. Note that the effect of short-\nterm loans on gross interbank assets is also significantly bigger in absolute value during\nthe normal sample (p-value of 0.05) relative to the crisis sample. The coefficient shrinks\nOn Table 5, the effects of both long-term loans and deposits are significantly bigger (in\nabsolute value) relative to the crisis sample (p-value of 0.05). The magnitude of effects\nof long-term loans shrinks by about 95% and that of longer-term deposits by about 60%.\nOverall, in all regressions, the role of the interbank market as a liquidity reservoir and risk\nmanagement tool becomes significantly smaller during the `crisis' sample which features\nabundant central bank liquidity that might have partly substituted the role of the inter-\nbank market. Therefore, our results provide evidence in favor of our fourth hypothesis\nof a diminished role of the interbank market with the onset of the financial crisis and\ncentral banks' non-standard monetary policies.\n6 Conclusion\nUsing a complete data set of interbank exposures among German banks over the 2002-\n2014 period, we discover several features of interbank relationships that were not well\nknown before. First, interbank exposures are a significant part of bank assets, averaging\n20-25 %. Second, interbank exposures are not only of a short-term nature, as was widely\nbelieved. Rather, we find these exposures to have an average maturity of at least 1\nyear. This number is actually likely significantly larger, as our numerical estimate builds\non the maturity buckets reported in banking statistics, and are thus the lower bound\nof the true estimate. Third, most institutions have significant exposures vis-`\na-vis other\nbanks on both sides of the balance sheet - and thus become intermediaries among banks.\nWe have labeled this property interbank intermediation, to distinguish it from the more\ndirect and well-understood bank intermediation. The latter connects households and\nfirms, while the former connects banks and banks. Accountingwise, these exposures are\nrecorded in a client book and an interbank book, respectively. Fourth, we find interbank\nintermediation, as recorded in the interbank book, to be derivative to the bank's client\nbook. The autonomous transactions of bank clients (households and firms) determine the\nbuild-up of the interbank book. We find evidence that banks arrange the term structure\nof the interbank book such that it reflects the inverse of the client book, i.e. a overnight\ndeposit triggers an equally overnight interbank lending, while a long-term loan to non-\nbank clients triggers an equally longer-term interbank funding transaction.\nThus, the interbank book grows in parallel to the (autonomous) client book, and resem-\nbles, to some extent, its mirror image. The interbank book is a policy instrument of the\nbank, and it can be \u00adand effectively is- used to manage the overall interest risk embedded\nin maturity differences between a bank's assets and its liabilities. Our data suggest that\nbanks tend to lower this maturity difference, the so-called duration gap, and thus utilize\nthe interbank market to spread duration risk across banks. Fifth, and last, we look at the\ninterbank market in stress periods by comparing its operation pre- and post-Lehman, i.e.\nstronger role of the central bank as a supplier of cheap liquidity to banks, through its full\nallottment program in 2011, and its LTRO 1 and 2 facilities in subsequent years. Our\nanalysis reveals that the stronger role of central bank liquidity supply in the post-Lehman\nera has significantly affected the role of the interbank market.\nAppendix\nDate\nEuroarea Germany\nFrance United States\nFigure 1: Average share of interbank lending to total asset size for different countries and\nthe euro area.
