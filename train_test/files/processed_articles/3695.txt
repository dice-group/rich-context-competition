    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe 2007-2008 financial crisis caused not only a dramatic fall in global output and employment but also a serious deterioration\nof public indebtedness for many governments, forced to rescue the banking system from failure. The crisis showed that\nnational governments are not able to regulate the global market by means of the traditional instruments of political economy.\nThe aim of this article is to identify new supranational instruments of economic policy.As a first step, to avoid a new financial\ncrisis, it is necessary to understand the intimate connection between the international monetary system, founded on the\ndollar as key currency, and the international financial system. Only some economists were able to see the causes of the\nrecent crisis as a by-product of an asymmetric monetary system. In this article, after having discussed the monetary roots of\nthe financial crisis, the discussion is focused on monetary sovereignty, financial sovereignty, and fiscal sovereignty as the main\neconomic responsibilities of a national government, to show that, today, a supranational economic government should have\nsimilar powers.An appendix (disposable on the website of the author) on \"Global imbalances:A false objective of economic\npolicy\" shows how the balance of payments imposes wrong goals to national economic policies.The discussion is focused on\n(a) the neo-Ricardian theory of economic integration, (b) financial capital flows, and (c) the Keynesian equations of an open\neconomy.\n",

The crisis provoked a dramatic fall in\nworld international trade, world output, world employment,\nand a serious deterioration of public indebtedness for many\ngovernments, forced to rescue their banking system from\nbankruptcy. Charles Kindleberger (1973) considers the great\ndepression, following the crash of 1929, as caused by the\ndifficult transition from an international economic order led\nby Great Britain to a new international economic order led\nby the United States. The present crisis is of the same order\nof magnitude, but its evolution and outcome will be different\nbecause although the world leadership of the United States\nis declining, no other super-superpowers can replace it. The\ninternational institutions (United Nations [UN], International\nMonetary Fund [IMF], General Agreement on Tariffs and\nTrade\u00adWorld Trade Organization [GATT-WTO], etc.),\ncreated on the initiative of the United States after the Second\nWorld War, worked sufficiently well during the cold war and\nthe two decades following the breakdown of the Union of\nSoviet Socialist Republics, but the international political\nsystem has now changed profoundly. Not only are new big\npowers, like China, India, and Brazil, willing to share with\nthe old industrialized countries--the United States, Russia,\nEurope, and Japan--the power to lead the world economy\nbut also new dramatic challenges, such as the risk of an eco-\nlogical collapse of the biosphere, need to be faced. A new\nmultipolar world is taking shape.Anew political and economic\nthinking is required.\n1University of Pavia, Italy\nCorresponding Author:\nGuido Montani, University of Pavia (I),Via San Felice 5,\nEmail: gmontani@eco.unipv.it\nMoney and Finance as Global\nPublic Goods: Contribution to a\nSupranational MacroeconomicTheory\nGuido Montani1\n Keywords\ninternational economics, international finance, international money, international political economy, international relations,\npolitical economy\n2 SAGE Open\nBecause the epicenter of the financial crisis has been\nlocated in the United States, many studies and essays deal\nwith the U.S. economy and suggest reforms, which should\nbe adopted by the U.S. government to avoid a new crisis and\nguarantee sustainable development. The implicit assumption\nis that the recovery of the U.S. economy will give a substan-\ntial contribution to the recovery and stability of the world\neconomy; in other words, the United States is regarded as the\nstabilizer of global economy. Indeed, in the old hegemonic\nsystem, this was more or less the role of the United States--\nbut that is the past. The financial crisis of 2008 marks a turn-\ning point: In the new multipolar world, no single country, not\neven the United States, will have the hegemonic power to\nlead the world. National reforms are not enough. We need\na new world political and economic order. Only within\nthe framework of a cooperative multipolar order, national\nreforms can be conceived and can be successful.\nIt is encouraging that some leading American economists\nunderstand the new role that the United States should play in\ninternational politics. For instance, Joseph Stiglitz, after\nhaving reconstructed the events causing the financial crisis\nwith great accuracy, criticizes market fundamentalism--the\nnotion that unfettered markets by themselves can ensure\neconomic prosperity and growth--as the main cause of the\nUnited States's wrong policy and supports the idea that a bet-\nter balance between the market and government should be\nEnhancing economic performance requires improving\nboth markets and government. There is no basis to the\nargument that because governments sometimes fail,\nthey should not intervene in markets when the markets\nfail--just as there is no basis to the converse argument\nthat because markets sometimes fail they should be\nMoreover, Stiglitz (2010) recognizes that the United\nStates cannot promote the recovery alone but should cooper-\nate with other countries to build a new international order,\nfounded on a new reserve currency, as the Special Drawing\nRights (SDRs) issued by the IMF, because the dollar can no\nlonger play the role of key currency for the international\nmonetary system. Even Fred Bergsten (2009) is very clear\nabout the link between internal and external reforms, which\nshould be conceived as a new \"global rebalancing strategy.\"\nBergsten says,\nBy reducing the systemic role of the dollar and build-\ning up the international position of other currencies and\nSDRs, the United States would increase its own incen-\ntives to limit its deficits and enable other countries to\nadd to their reserves without running surpluses. The\ncumulative effect would be greater prospects for inter-\nnational monetary stability and a reduced likelihood of\nfuture crises. (p. 36)\nNevertheless, the most explicit "
