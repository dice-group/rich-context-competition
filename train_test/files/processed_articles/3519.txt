    "abstract": "Abstract\nBig Data's calculative ontology relies on and reproduces a form of hyperindividualism in which the ontological unit of\nanalysis is the discrete data point, the meaning and identity of which inheres in itself, preceding, separate, and inde-\npendent from its context or relation to any other data point. The practice of Big Data governed by an ontology of\nhyperindividualism is also constitutive of that ontology, naturalizing and diffusing it through practices of governance and,\nfrom there, throughout myriad dimensions of everyday life. In this paper, I explicate Big Data's ontology of hyperindi-\nvidualism by contrasting it to a coconstitutive ontology that prioritizes relationality, context, and interdependence. I then\nsituate the ontology of hyperindividualism in its genealogical context, drawing from Patrick Joyce's history of liberalism\nand John Dewey's pragmatist account of individualism, liberalism, and social action. True to its genealogical provenance,\nBig Data's ontological politics of hyperindividualism reduces governance to the management of atomistic behavior,\nundermines the contribution of urban complexity as a resource for governance, erodes the potential for urban dem-\nocracy, and eviscerates the possibility of collective resistance.\n",

Controversy erupted\nwhen a former Police Commissioner charged that the\ncity's method of collecting crime data underreported\nactual events. He cited as an example the NYPD's prac-\ntice of recording a ``shooting'' only if a bullet wounds a\nvictim. According to the New York Times account:\na shooting . . . is recorded only if someone is hit . . .. If a\nbullet tears a person's clothing but does not wound the\nvictim, the episode is not included in the Police\nDepartment's official tally of shootings . . . Gunfire at\na car in which the occupants are wounded by shattered\nglass but not by a bullet is not recorded as a shooting.\nAs the official in charge of the police department's\nCompStat (Computer Statistics) program explained:\n```We need the bullet to cause the injury . . . and we\nneed blood''' (Goodman, 2015). A follow-up article a\nfew weeks later reported that ``the number of murders\nrecorded by the (police) department is almost always\nlower than those counted as homicides by the city's\nmedical examiner'' (Goodman, 2016). The Police\nCommissioner defended such practices, saying that ``I\nstand by my crime statistics because they are factual,\nthey are the truth,'' while a civil liberties advocate\ncountered that ``the controversy highlights just how\nsoft and subjective police statistics can be''\nMeanwhile, some 100 miles to the south, in the eco-\nnomically devastated city of Camden, New Jersey,\npolice officials reported a large-scale expansion of that\ncity's ``ShotSpotter'' automated gunfire detection\nsystem (Adomaitis, 2015).

The expanded ShotSpotter system in Camden\nwas part of a larger strategy of augmented video sur-\nveillance and data collection designed to reassert the\nappearance of police control in a city that routinely\ntops national rankings in the incidence of violent\nWhat counts as a ``gunshot'' in Camden, in many\ncases, would not register as a ``shooting'' in New York\nCity. Whereas New York construes a ``shooting'' in the\nnarrowest possible terms requiring the presence of a\nshooter, a bullet, and a victim's blood, Camden's city-\nwide acoustic surveillance system automatically records\nevery ``digital alert'' of an ``actual gun discharge'' as a\n``gunshot crime in progress'' pinpointed in time and\nspace (ShotSpotter Fact Sheet, 2016). These differences\nbetween New York City and Camden cannot be sepa-\nrated from their political context. The outcome of may-\noral elections in New York City, as well as the city's\nattractiveness for residents, tourists, and investors,\ndepends on the public perception of safety and security,\nexerting downward pressure, in turn, on the practice of\ncollecting and documenting crime statistics. The\nNYPD's CompStat program tracks weekly crime data\nby precinct as a tool for managing organizational per-\nsonnel and resources but it is equally a tool for mana-\nging public opinion (Eterno and Silverman, 2010). In a\nsimilar manner but conveying a different message,\nCamden's expanded ShotSpotter detection system\ndeploying sensors and monitors in every neighborhood\nalso influences political opinion by establishing a visible\npolice presence throughout the city.\nA related controversy over categories, exclusions,\nand measurement erupted over data on New York\nCity's homeless population at a time when visible\nhomelessness, like crime, had become a political liabil-\nity for the city's mayor. The annual homelessness count\nreported by the U.S. Department of Housing and\nUrban Development (HUD) in late 2015 found\nthat number was quickly challenged by advocates for\nthe homeless and HUD acknowledged uncertainty in\nthe ``reliability and consistency'' of the data (Stewart,\n2015a; U.S. Department of Housing and Urban\nDevelopment, 2015). The ambiguities in the data were\nmanifold. Individuals and families who became home-\nless through eviction, fire, landlord harassment or other\nreasons, and were living doubled-up with friends or\nrelatives were not considered homeless by HUD's def-\ninition and were excluded from the count and HUD's\nreport listed as zero the number of chronically homeless\nfamilies in New York City not in homeless shelters.\nAlthough the city's Human Resources Administration\n(HRA) funds 45 emergency and transitional shelters for\nwomen and their children forced to flee their homes due\nto domestic violence, HUD also reported as zero the\nnumber of homeless domestic violence (DV) victims in\nshelters because the DV shelters operated by HRA were\nconsidered separate from the homeless shelters oper-\nated by the Department of Homeless Services (New\nYork City Department of Homeless Services, 2016).\nSimultaneously, the Mayor's Office announced an\n``unprecedented expansion'' in the number of shelter\nbeds for homeless victims of domestic violence to\naccommodate ``a 50 percent increase over the current\n8,800 individuals served yearly'' (New York City Office\nfounding HUD's data, HUD's count of 1706 homeless\nyouth almost certainly underestimated a significant\nsubgroup of the homeless who, advocates said, might\nwhere they could be counted for fear of referral to\nChild Protective Services and . . . avoid shelters out of\nThe selective practices of categorization and meas-\nurement illustrated in these examples might easily be\ndismissed as the intrusion of political agendas in the\notherwise objective and politically neutral construction\nof data as, in the words of the NYPD Commissioner,\n``factual'' and ``the truth.'' If this were the case, a solu-\ntion might lie in the rationalization and depoliticization\nof methods of data collection, categorization, and ana-\nlysis, bringing actual practices into closer alignment\nwith normative claims. The ubiquity of Big Data as a\ntechnique of governance, biopolitics, and bureaucratic\ncontrol, however, has expanded the scope of the prob-\nlem and amplified the challenge of delineating solu-\ntions. My argument in this paper is that the challenge\nof (and to) Big Data is not confined only to the politi-\ncization of its practices but rather is situated in its foun-\ndational ontological premises, involving the\nevisceration of context through an ontology of hyper-\nindividualism. An ontology of atomistic individualism\nunderlies the construction of calculative data in general\ninvolving the algorithmic production, manipulation,\nand application of very large datasets, has exacerbated\nand expanded the scope of the problem by obscuring\nfrom critical scrutiny its foundational hyperindividual-\nist ontology.\nThis paper aims at a partial corrective by examining\nBig Data's underlying calculative ontology. By ontol-\nogy I mean ``a set of contentions about the fundamental\ncharacter of human being and the world'' (Bennett,\n2 Big Data & Society\n(Theory and History of Ontology, 2016). Specifying Big\nanswers the question starkly posed by Wagner-Pacifici\net al. (2015: 5) who ask, with respect to Big Data: ``Just\nwhat is our basic `ontological unit?''' or, even more\nplainly, ``What is a thing?'' (see also Beauregard,\n161) can be briefly summarized in the premise that\nthe world is knowable via calculation and measurement\nand can be represented as the aggregation of discrete,\nindependent, empirically observable units. These units\nare the ``data points'' representing, to list only a few\nexamples, gunshots, homeless people, sociodemo-\ngraphic characteristics, credit card swipes, Internet\nsearches, or geo-tagged locational coordinates captured\ncalculative ontology both relies on and reproduces a\nform of atomistic individualism in which the onto-\nlogical unit of analysis is the discrete data point, the\nmeaning and identity of which inheres in itself, preced-\ning, separate, and independent from its context or its\nrelation to any other data point.\nBy the hyperindividualism of Big Data, I refer to the\npractice of disaggregation and reaggregation that pro-\nceeds through a multistep process of interconnected\nand interdependent constructions of the world. Big\nData's ontological imaginary involves (1) the division\nand disaggregation of data fields (``variables'') into\never-smaller units measured at ever finer-grained\nlevels of resolution, (2) the practice of counting each\nindividual observation as an autonomous unit--a\nthing-in-itself--extracted from and independent of its\ncontext, and (3) the reaggregation and recontextualiza-\ntion of the resultant data ``bits'' through the automated\nalgorithmic search for statistical patterns and correl-\nations hidden within the dataset. While an ontology\nof atomistic individualism underlies calculative prac-\ntices in general, the diffusion of Big Data both relies\non and produces a form of hyperindividualism of an\nunprecedented scope and scale. The hyperindividualiza-\ntion of Big Data results, first, from the hyperdisaggre-\ngation of data fields in what Kitchin (2014: 2) describes\nas the production of ``massive, dynamic flows of\ndiverse, fine-grained, relational data'' recording and\ncounting, for example, Internet transactions, selected\nwords within social media posts, demographic ``vari-\nables,'' real-time spatiotemporal registers, and so on,\nwhere the identity or meaning of each data point is\nself-evidently and inherently given as a thing-in-itself\ndivorced from its context. That hyperindividualization\npermits, second, the reaggregation and intercorrelation\nof data observations to construct new observations and\n``facts,'' the meaning of which is based on, imposed by,\nand imputed from the discursive categorical labels in\nthe data table rather than from the meaning residing\nin the lived experience of the original units of\nobservation.\nConsideration of Big Data's ontology of hyperindi-\nvidualism moves beyond epistemological debates over\ndefinitions, categorizations, data collection methods,\nand data accuracy. The interrogation of such matters\nderives from an internal critique of Big Data's onto-\nlogical framework while adopting and remaining\nwithin its ontological assumptions and focusing on\nproblems of operationalization and implementation,\nthat is, on problems of method (Lake, 2014).\nMotivating such internal critique is the belief that\nbetter (i.e. more accurate, consistent, objective, or com-\nprehensive) methods of data collection, aggregation,\nand analysis will produce better knowledge. Beyond\nmerely addressing internal operational mechanics, how-\never, internecine conflicts over the ``how'' of Big Data\nhave constitutive effects. By performing and naturaliz-\ning Big Data's ontological assumptions, debates over\nwhat gets counted, through what methods, via what\nalgorithms (Kwan, 2016), and despite what omissions\nand (mis)categorizations reproduce its foundational\npremises while deflecting attention away from a critical\nassessment of those underlying principles (Zaloom,\n2003). The practice of Big Data governed by an ontol-\nogy of hyperindividualism is also constitutive of that\nontology, naturalizing and diffusing it through prac-\ntices of governance and, from there, throughout\nmyriad dimensions of everyday life. The challenge for\ngovernance is that problems inherent in the ontology\nunderlying a practice cannot be resolved by altering the\npractice but must be addressed at the level of founda-\ntional ontological assumptions. Changing those onto-\nlogical assumptions, however, destabilizes the entire\nedifice of practice built up on the prior underlying foun-\ndation that allowed the politicization of data construc-\ntion to proceed in the first place. As Garfinkel\nobserved, there are often ```good' organizational rea-\nResistance to change on the part of interests invested in\nthose current practices (e.g. the police or the mayor) all\nbut guarantees the preservation of the status quo.\nMy purpose in this paper, accordingly, is to consider\nthe implications for governance of Big Data's ontology\nof hyperindividualism. Rather than taking Big Data's\nontological assumptions as the starting point of the\nanalysis, however, my concern is to sketch a brief\ngenealogical account of their emergence. A genealogical\nnarrative understands practices (and their conse-\nquences) as situated in the confluence of the circum-\nstances from which they emerged (Foucault, 1984;\ntory's search for origins or causes, a genealogical\napproach problematizes the given-ness of Big Data's\nontological premises by unraveling and exposing their\ncontingent emergence. Focusing on emergence rather\nto ``counter the teleological tendency of one's\nthoughts.'' For Colin Koopman:\nGenealogical problematization . . . provokes a question\nby rendering the inevitable contingent . . ..A genealogy\nalso shows us how that which we took to be inevitable\nwas contingently composed. A genealogy does not just\nshow us that our practices in the present are contingent\nrather than necessary, for it also shows how our prac-\ntices in the present contingently became what they are.\nThe history of that which was once presumed inevitable\nnot only makes us forget the inevitability, it also pro-\nvides us with the materials we would need to transfor-\nmatively work on that which we had taken to be a\nIn the remainder of this paper, therefore, I explicate Big\nData's ontology of hyperindividualism as a radical\nextension of atomistic liberal individualism and I con-\ntrast it to a coconstitutive ontology that prioritizes rela-\ntionality, context, and interdependence. I then situate the\nontology of hyperindividualism in the longue dure\u00b4e of its\ngenealogical emergence, drawing primarily from Patrick\nvidualism, liberalism, and social action. In the conclud-\ning section of the paper, I consider the implications for\ngovernance of Big Data's ontological politics of hyper-\nindividualism. While Big Data's hyperindividualist\nontology extends throughout its applications in informa-\ntion technology, I focus here on the ways in which that\nfoundational ontology affects the definition of urban\nproblems, the dynamics of urban politics, and the prac-\ntice of urban governance in the age of Big Data.\nBig Data's ontology of\nhyperindividualism\nClarifying Big Data's ontological imaginary and\nanswering the deceptively simple question ``What is a\nthing?'' reflects the centrality of what Latour (2005)\ncalls Dingpolitik or the politics of the thing. As\nexplained by Ignacio Farias:\nUrban politics is . . . not about subjects, subjectivities or\ndiscourses, but about things, complex entangled\nobjects, socio-material interminglings. This is what\nLatour (2005a) calls a Dingpolitik: the understanding\nthat urban politics can no longer be understood as con-\nflict between human or, better, class interests, but\ninvolves conflicts over different `cosmograms', that is,\nways of articulating the elements of the world and their\nUnderlying the ``bigness'' of Big Data's high volume of\nobservational units--``terabytes or petabytes of data''\nof those myriad observational units (i.e. each individual\ndata point) constitutes a discrete thing-in-itself, an\nindependently observable unit, the ontological identity\nof which precedes and thus channels its entry into the\n``correct'' category or field within the dataset. Identity\nin this individuated ontology inheres in the observa-\ntional unit: the data point is the ``Thing.'' That identity,\nfurthermore, remains intact as the individuated obser-\nvational unit--the data point--is extracted from its\ncontext in the world and transported to the dataset,\nentered in the spreadsheet or visually displayed on a\nmap. These are the dots on the map captured by\nCamden's ShotSpotter gunshot detection system.\nEach dot represents the imprint of a discrete auditory\nsignal that a certain acoustical frequency defines as a\n``gunshot,'' each individuated point identified by its\nunique locational coordinates of latitude and longitude\nthat fix its position on the gunshot map of Camden.\nLike the children's game of connect-the-dots, the pat-\ntern on the map, the shape of the data distribution, or\nthe parameters of the dataset derive from, and are con-\nstituted through, the aggregation and categorization of\nthe discrete, autonomous, individuated data points.\nThe identity of the whole is the aggregate of the indi-\nvidual identities inhering in the autonomous units of\nwhich it is comprised. E pluribus unum: out of many,\none.\nIn contrast to Big Data's individuated ontology of\nthe data point is a relational ontology in which meaning\ndevolves from the whole to its constituent parts and the\nidentity of the individual data point emerges from its\nrelationship to and membership in the whole. Kitchin\nnotes the highly relational character of Big Data's data\nin which ``common fields . . . enable the conjoining of\ndifferent data sets'' (2014: 2) through the ability to\noverlay; juxtapose; or correlate data layers, fields, or\ncategories at will. But this relationality is correlative\nrather than constitutive, a relationality of juxtaposition\nrather than of ontological cocreation and codepend-\nence. These ``relational databases'' construct an acci-\ndental relationality in which the meaning of the data\npoint is first abstracted and removed from its constitu-\ntive contextuality and then recontextualized through\nrelational juxtaposition with other data points that\nhave been similarly distanced from their contextually\nconstructed ontological identity. In Big Data's correla-\ntive, juxtapositional and accidental relationality, each\nfield, layer, or variable in the dataset can be associated\nwith any other, it can be contextualized or\n4 Big Data & Society\ndecontextualized, or it can be correlated with one data\nlayer today and a different one tomorrow--all without\naltering the inherent, immutable meaning, value, or\nidentity of each data point comprising the dataset.\nIn a coconstitutive ontology, in contrast, the meaning\nor identity of the individual data point does not preexist\nits context. If in the individuated ontology of Big Data the\nwhole is the aggregation of its individual parts, in a rela-\ntional ontology the individual parts derive their identity\nfrom and through their membership in the whole.\nBecause the meaning of the individual data point is estab-\nlished by its context, it cannot be removed from its con-\ntext without losing, altering, or obscuring its meaning.\nWhen the ontological meaning of the ``thing''--the indi-\nvidual data point--resides in its relationality within a con-\ntextual network or assemblage of things, ``everything is\nalready within the individual'' observational unit or data\nand ``there is no distinction between individual and envir-\nonment. There are no natural, pregiven boundaries.. ..\nEverything is connected and contained within everything\nViewed within a relational ontology, therefore, a dot\non the gunshot map of Camden no longer represents\nmerely the localized discharge of a firearm marked as\nan individuated ``thing.'' The dot instantiates the rec-\nording of a certain acoustical signal at a designated\nelectronic frequency but also so much more.\nContained in that dot is a set of political and economic\nstructures and processes producing a population differ-\nentiated by indicators of poverty and inequality; the\noperation of urban, suburban, and regional land-use\npractices of inclusion and exclusion that situate that\ndot here rather than there within a regional landscape;\na portfolio of legal, illegal, and extra-legal provisions\nand practices governing the availability, distribution,\nand cost of firearms; the design and implementation\nof law enforcement and surveillance practices and the\ntraining of personnel in their use; the technological cap-\nacity to design, construct, and operate gunshot detec-\ntion devices in a chaotic urban environment; a political\ndecision-making process allocating scarce financial\nresources in a cash-strapped city to acquire, install,\nand operate the detection system; and more. All this,\nas John Law notes, ``is already within the individual''\ngunshot pinpointed at a specific place and time but all\nof these layers of meaning fall away and disappear\nwhen the identity of the acoustic signal is reduced to\na ``digital alert . . . of a gunshot crime in progress.''\nAs the pragmatist philosopher Richard Rorty\nconcludes:\nit does not pay to be essentialist about tables, stars,\nelectrons, human beings, academic disciplines, social\ninstitutions, or anything else . . ..[T]here is nothing to\nbe known about (objects) except an initially large,\nand forever expanding, web of relations to other\nobjects. Everything that can serve as the term of a rela-\ntion can be dissolved into another set of relations, and\nso on for ever. There are, so to speak, relations all the\nway down, all the way up, and all the way out in every\ndirection: you never reach something which is not just\none more nexus of relations . . ..There is nothing to be\nknown about anything save its relations to other things.\nBig Data's hyperindividuated ontology extracts and\ndisplaces the data point--the ``thing''--from the cocon-\nstitutive, relational ontology of the assemblage.\nCamden's ShotSpotter system strips the gunshot from\nits relational context, reduces it to a common acoustical\nsignal, and categorizes all gunshots as identical\n``things.'' It does this by elevating the single criter-\nion--the register of an electronic signal on a detection\ndevice--and excluding all other contextual characteris-\ntics as defining criteria for the data category labeled\n``gunshots.'' Shots that hit their target, shots that\nmiss, shots fired with intentional malice and shots\nfrom the accidental discharge of a firearm, aggressive\nshots and defensive ones, shots from stolen firearms\nand shots from legally registered ones, shots emanating\nfrom drug-related violence and shots from law-enforce-\nment actions: these contextual complexities (and\nothers) make each of these very disparate types of\nshots a different category or type of ``thing'' but these\nontological differences are ignored and obscured in\nreducing the disparate meanings of these disparate\nevents to the singular category of ``gunshot'' denoted\nby a particular auditory signature picked up by an\nacoustical detection device.\nMeanwhile, a different but equally narrowly con-\nstrued criterion is constitutive of a ``shooting'' in\nNew York City. Here a gunshot that misses its target\nis not a shooting, nor is a gunshot that wounds its\ntarget by shattering the glass of a car window. The\nNYPD's narrowly construed definition excludes from\nthe category all but one of the multitude of contextual\nrelationalities comprising the multitude of different\n``things'' called gunshots. Gunshots whose identities\ncorrespond to those excluded categories are experi-\nenced in the world but do not exist in the dataset con-\nstituting the world of Big Data. A contextual, relational\nontology of homelessness fares no better in New York\nCity. Homeless youth are not counted as homeless and\nthus populate the ontological category of ``not home-\nless,'' not because they are in fact not homeless but\nbecause they have learned to evade HUD's count of\nthe city's homeless population. Doubled-up families\nare defined and categorized as ``not homeless'' despite\nhaving been rendered homeless by fire, eviction, domes-\ntic violence, or landlord harassment. The category ``not\nhomeless'' contains both homeless and not-homeless\nindividuals who, nonetheless, are ontologically con-\nstructed as identical within the decontextualized, hyper-\nindividuated dataset of homelessness. When the dataset\nof homelessness is then algorithmically correlated with\nsimilarly constructed datasets to reveal unexpected stat-\nistical patterns and associations, the apparent clarity\nenabled by Big Data's emergent relationality of juxta-\nposition conceals the incoherence of the data entered\ninto the analysis.\nThese practices of data collection, categorization,\nand correlation correspond to and reproduce an indi-\nviduated ontology in which identity inheres in the dis-\ncrete, autonomous observational unit irrespective of its\nconstitutive context. Big Data's characteristics of high\nvolume, high velocity, fine-grained resolution, and\ncomprehensive scope (Kitchin, 2013), coupled with its\nincreasing pervasiveness throughout more and more\nspheres of everyday life, have elevated the individuated\nontology to what may justifiably be considered an\nontology of hyperindividualism. Enabled by techno-\nlogical developments in data acquisition, storage, data-\nbase management, and analysis, hyperindividualism\nproceeds through the categorization of data fields at\never more finely grained levels of resolution and ever\nmore comprehensive levels of coverage. To cite only\ntwo examples, DNA barcoding that allows the defini-\ntive categorization of unique biological species\n(www.barcodeoflife.org) extends individuation across\nall living things while obscuring ecological interdepen-\ndencies and coconstitutive ontologies. The Open\nResearch and Contributor ID system that ``provides a\npersistent digital identifier that distinguishes you from\nevery other researcher'' (www.orcid.org) institutional-\nizes the individuation of knowledge while obscuring the\ndense network of influences and interdependencies\nwithin which any process of knowledge production is\nThe genealogy of hyperindividualism\nHow, then, did an ontology of hyperindividuation\nbecome possible and from where did it emerge? For\nTrevor Barnes: ``what is forgotten in the celebration\nsituates Big Data's assumptions and practices in the\nquantitative revolution in geography and the social sci-\nences in the mid-20th century. Those developments, of\ncourse, were themselves inscribed within a process of\nindividuation of much longer duration.

For the\n75,323 individuals comprising HUD's dataset of home-\nless individuals in New York City in 2015 (and the tens\nof thousands similarly categorized in other jurisdic-\ntions), the essentialized identity of homelessness derives\nfrom their inclusion in the dataset rather than from the\ncontextual dynamics that produce the condition and\nexperience of homelessness. In the circular logic of\nBig Data, the homeless are those who are counted as\nhomeless. The ontological identity of homelessness that\ninheres to those individualized and decontextualized\nbodies when the dataset of which they are constituents\nis correlated and recontextualized with other datasets,\nproducing new relationalities, may have little if any-\nthing in common with the original context-dependent\nmeaning of homelessness experience by the individuals\ncomprising the dataset.\nHyperindividualism and urban\ngovernance\nBig Data's ontology of hyperindividualism exerts a\ndebilitating influence on the conceptualization and\npractice of urban governance. Understanding the\nworld as an aggregation of individuated data points\nreduces governance to the management of atomistic\nbehavior, undermines the contribution of urban com-\nplexity as a resource for governance, erodes the poten-\ntial for urban democracy, and eviscerates the possibility\nof collective resistance.\nFirst, as Patrick Joyce observes: ``before populations\ncan be governed they must be known or identified''\ncompilation, and mapping have long been used and\nunderstood as techniques of governance (e.g.\n1991). An optimistic version of this claim is that when\nquantification and measurement make problems vis-\nible, governments are provoked to produce a solution\nor risk a crisis of governmental legitimacy (Habermas,\n1975). While the visibility of a problem may prompt\ngovernment action, however, the form of its represen-\ntation critically influences the form and substance of\nthe governmental response. By constituting urban\nproblems as the aggregation of individual empirical\nobservations, Big Data's ontology of hyperindividual-\nism reduces governance to the management of atomistic\nbehavior or characteristics. A problem represented as a\npattern of dots on a map--a concentration of subprime\nloans, poor test scores, low-income households, home-\nless individuals, or gunshots, for example--prompts a\nresponse aimed at altering the number or distribution\nof dots. A governance strategy that focuses on visible\nsymptoms deflects attention from underlying causes, at\nworst blaming the victim and at best addressing acute\nneeds of individuals at risk without preventing the con-\ntinuing (re)emergence of problems at their source.\nSecond, Big Data's relationship to urban complexity\npresents a paradoxical challenge to urban governance.\nWhile technological developments in data production,\ncollection, and management have yielded an exponen-\ntial increase in the number and variety of data cate-\ngories available for analysis, the decontextualization,\nhomogenization, and standardization of data within\ncategories reduce complexity that might otherwise\nserve as a resource for governance. The hyperindividu-\nalism of Big Data echoes the ascendancy of objectifica-\ntion in GIS more than two decades ago, in which\n``access to massive databases causes the analyst to\ntransform those to whom the data refer from subject-\nively differentiated individuals to an objectified `other'''\nsubjective viewpoint flattens complexity that could\nenrich governance by bringing multiple perspectives\nto bear on a problem.\nThird, Big Data undermines democracy in the prac-\ntice of urban governance. Nikolas Rose describes at\nlength the ``constitutive interrelationship between\nquantification and democratic government'' (1991:\n675) in which democratic participation requires a\npublic conversant with numbers and able to compre-\nhend the world in the statistical form through which it\nis presented for public deliberation. The ascendancy of\nBig Data, however, renders obsolete the public's polit-\nical numeracy as the chart and the map are replaced by\nthe black box of data management software and the\ncomplexity of the visible world is replaced by the\nhidden complexity of the algorithm (Wyly, 2014b).\nThe ontology of hyperindividualism, furthermore,\nreduces active political agents to the status of gener-\nators of data, whether through volunteering of data\ngets of data-scraping technology.\nFinally, Big Data's hyperindividuated ontology evis-\ncerates the possibility of collective resistance. The dis-\naggregating, objectifying, and decontextualizing\npractices informed by these ontological presuppositions\nundermine collective action by inculcating a worldview\ncomprised of atomistic individuals. These individualis-\ntic foundational premises correspond to and reproduce\nhegemonic commitments to a prevailing ideology of\nindividual responsibility and personal culpability.\nWhat Dewey observed in 1923 applies with equal or\ngreater force today:\nWhen the self is regarded as something complete within\nitself, then it is readily argued that only internal mor-\nalistic changes are of importance in general reform . . ..\nThe result is to throw the burden for social improve-\nment upon free-will in its most impossible form.\nMoreover, social and economic passivity are encour-\naged. Individuals are led to concentrate in moral intro-\nspection upon their own vices and virtues, and to\nneglect the character of the environment . . ..And while\nsaints are engaged in introspection, burly sinners run\nConclusion\nWith Big Data a ubiquitous presence in modern life,\ncritical reflection urges caution in adopting its tenets\nand practices to inform policy-making and urban gov-\nernance. Most discussion of Big Data and governance\nproceeds through internal critique; finding inconsisten-\ncies, ambiguities, and lacunae in the processes of data\ncollection, aggregation, and analysis comprising Big\nData's operating manual. I have argued in this paper\n8 Big Data & Society\nthat Big Data's challenge to urban governance cannot\nsufficiently be addressed at the level of internal critique\nand that its ontological presuppositions provide an\nunreliable foundation for the practice of urban govern-\nance in a democratic society.\n"
