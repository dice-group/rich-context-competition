According to Brand\nand Johnson (2001), the Soviet's feat led to the belief that the\nnation's schools were deficient in math, science, and tech-\nnology. Consequently, the National Defense Education Act\n(NDEA) was enacted in 1958 to fund and promote educa-\ntional activities to advance the use of technology, and teach-\ning and learning to strengthen national security. Similar to\nhow NDEA was established to address the problem of tech-\nnological readiness, the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB)\nwas established to address the increasing problem of poor\nschool performance. Its purpose was to initiate a launch\nsequence to boost the nation's sputtering schools out of the\nlow orbit of failure for far too many children to a higher\norbit--encompassing success for all children. This time,\nwith NCLB as the boosters, public school principals were to\nbe the thrusters that steered the ship.\nThe NCLB provided motivation to identify the most\nimportant factors contributing to school success or failure.\nIts mandate was driven, in part, by the need to address the\nfailure of Black students (U.S. Department of Education\n[U.S. DOE], 2005). There is now a significant concern over\nthe failure of male students (disproportionately Blacks),\nwhich is being blamed on the \"feminization of schools\"\nSteffenhagen, 2001). According to Bitterman, Goldring, and\nnation's 89,810 public school principals were females of\nschools.\nNoteworthy, it has been suggested that within the White\nmale (androcentric) establishment, which significantly con-\ntrols school superintendencies, there are sectors cultivating\nbias against female principals; such an exercise is not the\npurpose of this study. The rhetoric from both sides of the\ndebate is heated, situational, and personal. As such, Froese-\nGermain (2006) called for a dialogue informed by research.\nThe findings of such possible research, demonstrated by the\nresult in Figure 1, would provide empirical evidence reveal-\ning that in 18 years, females moved from 34.5% of nation's\noverall public school principalship to the most recent 52%, a\n17.5% gain. In the same time frame, Whites lost 4.2% of\nand Hispanics lost 1.1% (4.1%-3%). On the contrary,\n\"Other,\" which includes Asians, made a 2.2% gain.

Large schools are those with 1,000 or more\nMedium schools. By default, for this study, medium\nschools not within the range of small and large schools.\nSmall schools. Small schools are those with 450 or fewer\nstudents (New York City Department of Education\nModerator. \"Factors that affect the strength or the direction\nof the relationship between the intervention and student\neducation outcomes\" (Institute of Education Sciences,\n2014, p. iii). Such could be a function of students' demo-\ngraphic characteristic, or factors within schools, neighbor-\nhoods, or educators (Institute of Education Sciences, 2014).\nLiterature Review\nPrevious research has shown that gender-specific behaviors\naffect school principals'practices and may affect the individual\nperformance of students as well as the overall performance of\nschools. Females were shown to utilize a collaborative team\napproach that involves consensus-building in a system where\nmales represented the established and idealized concept of\nleadership (Durrah, 2009). The idealization of male character-\nistics emanated from an androcentric perspective, whereby\nmasculine values were elevated as superior and female values\nwere discounted to make them appear inferior (Bethel-Jackson,\n2005). Androcentrism has been described as a \"pervasive cul-\ntural bias that affects interpretations of both gender similarities\nand gender differences\" and is evident when maleness is the\ndefault value, resulting in \"masculine pronouns being used to\nrepresent women and men\" (Hegarty, 2006, p. 1).Addi-Raccah\n(2002) found that, under such conditions, female principals\nwere more likely to appoint males as assistant principals (APs).\nPrincipals appointing APs may be the case in Israel, on which\nAddi-Raccah's study focused, but it is not the case in NYC.\nHowever, it is believed that as the power of U.S. female\nprincipals increased with their growing number, they were\nmore likely to alter the gender composition of their schools'\npedagogical staff (Addi-Raccah, 2002). Nevertheless, sev-\neral other studies have reported that the success of female\nprincipals is dependent on access to resources that are more\nreadily available to male principals within their androcentric\nFreigruber (2009) reported that principals were a critical\nfactor in school success and that characteristics related to\ntheir gender and race influenced the achievement scores of\nurban schools and principal behavior. The significance of\nprincipal behavior is found in Winfrey's (2009) study \"How\nTeachers Perceive Their Job Satisfaction Is Influenced by\nTheir Principals' Behaviors and Attitudes Related to Race\nand Gender,\" wherein student academic performance was\nfound to be a function of teacher job satisfaction.\nNotwithstanding that principals do not regularly teach, they\nare held responsible for student performance (Eginli, 2009).\nWhile some studies found no difference in how male and\nfemale principals ran their schools (Lally, 2008), Durrah\n(2009) reported that teachers and principals perceived dif-\nferences in behavior between male and female principals.\nShe found that male principals exhibited leadership charac-\nteristics that were challenging in nature (i.e., nonsubmis-\nsive). Earlier studies also found that men were aggressive,\nassertive, and domineering (Eagly, Karau, & Johnson,\n1992), which led teachers to prefer them as principals of\nChen & Addi, 1992) also reported that females preferred\nmales as principals. Another study reported that male princi-\npals were more successful at long-term planning, which is\nan important component of annual school performance indi-\nthat more senior and higher ranked teachers worked more\nwith male principals than female principals, and both male\nand female teachers expressed greater satisfaction working\nwith male principals.\nFigure 1. Characteristics of the public and private school\nSource. National Center for Educational Statistics (2013a).\nFemale principals, on the contrary, were perceived as\nappealing to the heart, responsive, sensitive, and having a\nqualities more conducive to working with children and\nendearing to some teachers and parents (Brooks, 2009).\nFurthermore, female principals were reported to have an\naffinity for lower socioeconomic status (SES) students, to be\nmore engaging with teachers, and to be more effective at\nday-to-day running of the school, resulting in better daily\nperformance indicators such as attendance (Brooks, 2009).\nOther studies revealed that students performed better and\nteachers were more involved, collegial, and cooperative with\nadministration when the principals were females (Chen &\nAs the number of female principals increased, strong\nwomen principals could emerge to change the narrative that\npreviously described such school leaders as token women.\nToken women lacked power, requiring some to either act as\nmales to prove their competence, or be more prone to employ\nmales as APs (Addi-Raccah, 2002). As previously noted,\nNYC principals do not employ APs, and so I digress to elab-\norate. In NYC, the process of hiring APs (or other adminis-\ntrators) was compromised to ensure whomever the principals\nor the superintendents wanted was hired. Such nepotism was\nroutine, and it was for such and similar reasons that\nChancellor Fari\u00f1a issued new regulations mandating that all\nindividuals wishing to become school principals or APs have\nTo return to the previous discussion, Kanter (1997, as\ncited in Cognard-Black, 2004) described token women as\nthose few in an organization dominated by men. Such women\nwere made highly visible, were more scrutinized, and were\ntaxed with a higher expectation of success. Female Black\nprincipals reported being even more scrutinized and having\nto create a persona of authority and competence (Pollard,\nAs more females began to fill principal positions, a grow-\ning concern was the significant \"feminization of schools\" led\nby female principals compared with those led by males\n(Chen & Addi, 1992). Anecdotal reports depicting concerns\nabout school feminization have been found in countries such\nas Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. Three examples are\n(a) Bradley's (2004) publication \"Why Boys Drop Out: Few\nMale Teachers; Feminization of Our Schools Hurts Boys,\"\n(b) Steffenhagen's (2001) \"The `Feminization'of Elementary\nSchools: Absence of Male Teachers a `Worldwide Puzzle,'\nProfessor Says,\" and (c) Gray's (2004) \"Canty Boys Keen on\nSegregated Classes With More PhysicalAction.\" Meanwhile,\nNational Public Radio's (NPR; 2011) \"Are Single-Sex\nClassrooms Better for Kids?\" is indicative of U.S. public\ndebate on the matter.\nA question relevant to the above concerns was found in\nthe title of Chen and Addi's (1992) article \"Are Male\nTeachers in a Female-Dominated Workplace Gender\nTokens?\" Male teachers became opposed to the idea of being\ntoken males working in female-dominated schools, which\ndecreased the likelihood that schools led by female princi-\npals would have more male teachers (Chen & Addi, 1992).\nHowever, these findings were contradicted by Cognard-\nBlack's (2004) study, which found that male elementary\nschool teachers enjoyed more privileges and preferred work-\ning with female principals. Other studies have suggested that\nmen who occupy seats of power in school administrations\ntend to promote actions and narratives that sustain and sup-\nport the traditional patriarchal framework to maintain their\nactions could impede the success of female principals.\nWith the number of female principals steadily rising, prior\ndiscussions around token women may no longer be relevant.\nHowever, Black and Latino females comprise a small per-\ncentage of public school principals (National Center for\nEducational Statistics [NCES], 2013a) and, as the demo-\ngraphic shift elevates their significance, White males who\nare predominantly school superintendents may hire Blacks\nand Latinos as token principals. The implication is that the\nclosely guarded and hard-to-penetrate \"old boys' network\"\ncould deny Black, Latino, and other female principals,\nresources such as mentoring that they need to succeed at\nHowever, Carter (2009) found that schools with mentored\nprincipals did not achieve higher performance scores than\nschools with nonmentored principals. Still, Citty (2010)\nfound mentoring to be most effective at helping principals\nbecome successful school leaders. Based on the discrepancy,\nCitty revealed a list of other resources that will aid principal\nsuccess. They include authority and autonomy, start-up\nfunds, management teams, and access to advanced profes-\nsional development that teaches how to use data to drive\nschool improvement.\nAs asserted in numerous studies cited in M\u00e9ndez-Morse\n(2004), mentoring was an established and recommended\npractice in the androcentric culture of educational adminis-\ntration. According to Schwiebert (2000), mentors \"provide\nsupport to their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s in an effort to remove organiza-\ntional barriers, to assist prot\u00e9g\u00e9s in negotiating the `sys-\ntem,' and to provide prot\u00e9g\u00e9s with opportunities for upward\nmobility\" (as cited in M\u00e9ndez-Morse, 2004, p. 3). Because\nmentors were likely to choose similar and like-minded indi-\nviduals (i.e., White males) as prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, those of a different\nrace, ethnicity, or gender were generally overlooked\n(M\u00e9ndez-Morse, 2004). Consequently, Black and Latino\nfemale administrators, who are often placed as leaders of\ndifficult schools (NCES, 2013b), must contend with \"isms\"\nassociated with race, ethnicity, and gender while being\ndenied the needed help that mentoring could accord\nFlores (2011) coined the term racialized tokens to describe\nLatina administrators serving the same token roles under\nWhite female principals as the White female principals\nserved under male principals.\n4 SAGE Open\nIn Regents (1998), the New York State Education\nDepartment (NYSED) outlined the inextricable link between\nstudent performance and capable school leadership as well as\nthe Regents' calls for diversity in the state's school leadership\ncadre. Children in urban schools, especially those belonging to\nracial minorities, need to see in their leaders role models with\nwhich they could identify and emulate (Ett, 2008). It has been\nopined that \"administrators and staff should be accountable for\ntheir position as leaders and role models that students will\nstated that school superintendents should be similarly held\naccountable as role models for female and minority school\nleaders. The NYSED's plan to expand diversity in the state's\nschool administrative cadre was dictated by NCLB. An earlier\nmandate, Title IX, also addressed gender inequality in school\nAs noted above, the NYSED action has implications for\nthe success of NYC schools, especially those that are racially/\nethnically segregated. It could help the many NYC male and\nfemale Black and Hispanic teachers who aspire to leadership\npositions in their schools but cannot get their foot in the door\nbecause of the barriers they face (Green, 2012). As princi-\npals, such individuals could help address the issue of teach-\ners who, being oblivious to, or dismissive of, students'\nculture or lived experience, resort to disciplinary actions that\ninitiate students' school failure (Graham & Erwin, 2011;\nGreen, 2012). The school-to-prison pipeline is the common\nterm used to explain the causal effect of such action.\nOne unfortunate result has been the creation of a repressive\nenvironment in which young [Black] people are suspended,\nexpelled or even arrested over minor misbehaviors--like talking\nback or disrupting class--that would once have been handled by\nthe principal. (para. 1)\nApart from their fear of Black students (Green, 2012), the\nbasis for such action on the part of many White school\nadministrators is explained in Cohen (1973). She revealed\nthat many Whites may lack frequent encounter with experi-\nenced Black teachers of their own age, who made impressive\ndisplay of their skills and the role modeling of Black compe-\ntence. In addition, they infrequently met (Black) authority\nfigures who exuded confidence and an unequivocal and\njovial (nondefensive) attitude regarding their ability to\nimpart their skills to benefit Whites. Such Blacks would\nexhibit \"equal status behavior\" as opposed to the \"diffused\nstatus characteristics,\" whereas Whites expected them to\nassume an inferior role. Cohen reminds me of a White stu-\ndent-teacher colleague who, more than 25 years ago, revealed\nto the class that her first interaction with Blacks began with\nher tenure as a New York teacher. She revealed her opinion\nof them was informed by the media.\nIn 1997, Pollard, foreshadowing the demographic shift, dis-\ncussed the paltry number of Blacks in school administration,\nthe lack of research considering the interaction of race and gen-\nder, and the failure of researchers to illuminate the gender of\nparticipants referred to as minorities. (Of course, such state-\nment may have been made with or without the knowledge of\nCohen's seminal work.) She (Pollard) further revealed the\nshortcomings of the few studies on Black school leaders, which\nrendered invisible the historical pedigree of their involvement\nin school administration and their success as administrators\nunder the nation's earlier segregated school system.\nIn addressing her concerns, a later study outlined the dev-\nastation that Brown v. Board of Education (1954) wrought on\nwere summarily fired, forbidden to be administrators of\nWhite teachers or of schools with White children, made into\njanitors, or given menial tasks. Underlying this treatment\nwas the propagation of the narrative depicting Black princi-\npals as callous, ineffective, or unqualified (Gooden, 2012;\nThe removal of Black principals from prominence as role\nmodels for children and members of the Black community\ncertainly contributed to the current school failure of Black\nmales and the corresponding adverse impact on those seek-\ning career in education (Karpinski, 2006). The U.S. Secretary\nof Education, Arne Duncan, outlined the basis of the current\nproblem in Graham and Erwin (2011), where he stated, \"It is\nespecially troubling that less than 2 percent of our nation's\n3.2 million teachers are African American males. It is not\ngood for any of our country's children that only one in 50\nteachers is a Black man\" (p. 398). The evolving shortage of\nBlack male teachers resulted in fewer Black male principals\nand principals were similarly affected (Berry, 2005).\nFairchild (2009) found that Black female principals were\nnegatively correlated with White teachers' job satisfaction.\nIn contrast, Pollard (1997) found that Black principals used\nracial identification with Black students to bridge the barrier\nfor White teachers, helping them better educate those stu-\ndents. These findings highlighted the need for principals to\nadopt practices that bridge achievement gaps between vari-\nous student groups. According to Brown and Beckett (2007),\nthe failure of Black students in segregated schools led to the\nemployment of more Black administrators who were\nbuilding on a practice of school and community leadership in\nseparate Black education that involved extensive engagement\nwith White school district officials and other individuals and\ngroups, was able to facilitate communication between\ndisadvantaged Black families and middle-class White teachers\nand school district officials, with the result that all stakeholders\nworked together effectively to develop policies and programs\nthat improved student behavior and academic achievement. (p. 8)\nCooper (2006) described the pioneering work of a female\nprincipal, Leah Hasty, who established an all-Black class-\nroom with a male Black teacher to provide a role model for\nBlack Baltimore school boys, which resulted in a modifica-\ntion of NCLB. To advance Hasty's work, the U.S. DOE\nadopted new rules giving public schools the option to estab-\nlish single-sex schools and classes as long as equal opportu-\nnity and choice was available to all students (Cooper, 2006).\nThe modification of NCLB by three U.S. Senators, including\nHillary Clinton of New York, allowed principals in New\nYork and other states to experiment with all-male school\nimprovement initiatives (Cooper, 2006). In NYC, examples\nof such schools are the Eagle Academy, the Urban Assembly\nfor Law and Justice, and the Bedford Academy. These were\nreasonably high performing schools, with all-male Black and\nLatino students and male principals who focused on learning\nrather than raising test scores (Rios, 2012).\nThe counterpart is the all-female student, and female-\nprincipal-led and high performing Young Women's\nLeadership School. All-female schools generally outperform\nall-male schools (Cooper, 2006). While the NCLB modifica-\ntion is silent regarding the noted self-selected racial segrega-\ntion of the schools referenced, given the gravity of school\nfailure of Black and Hispanic students, the National\nAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People and\nother groups have also remained mute with respect to legal\nchallenges (Cooper, 2006), giving principals the leeway to\nexperiment.\nWhile some studies explain that urban students'success is\ninfluenced by principals who are role models by virtue of\nsharing gender and racial characteristics with students, other\nful Black and high-poverty urban schools led by White male\nadministrators. These studies outlined how some principals,\nwith the aid of Black APs, were able to advance culturally\nrelevant pedagogical practices described in Ladson-Billings\n(1995)1 and serve as a bulwark against White staff members\nwho would advance deficit-thinking theory to stereotype stu-\ndents and their families.\nDeficit-thinking theory ascribes various labels to urban\nstudents and blames school failure on students' unprepared-\nness to learn, parental disinterest in education, and family\nlifestyle (Ford, Moore, & Scott, 2011). In contrast, the litera-\nture contains several reports of high-poverty urban schools\nwhere both Black and White principals, male and female,\nwere successful (Gerhart, Harris, & Mixon, 2011; Gulbin,\nschools were their winning grant writers, embrace of paren-\ntal involvement, collective efficacy, data driven assessment\nto improve teaching and learning, and/or mindfulness--a\nfunction of transformative school leaders (Gulbin, 2008).\nWith respect to the relationship between principal behav-\nior and student gender, several studies reported that females'\ncollaborative and consensus-building style was being\nimposed on, and reinforced in, children from kindergarten to\napproach was reported to adversely affect the education of\nboys and was a factor in their academic lag behind girls\n(Johnson & Gooliaff, 2013). It was suggested that such a\nfeminine approach to teaching and learning was incompati-\nble with boys' socialization and learning styles (Martino &\nKehler, 2006). In addressing the problem with New Zealand\nboys, a principal revealed boys do not succeed \"in the sit\ndown, shut up and open your books environment\" they have\na kinesthetic (movement orientated) learning style that\nrequires more physical actions (Gray, 2004, p. 1). In a U.S.\nstudy, Chambers (2009) found that males tended to be louder,\nmore physically aggressive, and they exhibited classroom\nbehaviors that forced teachers to engage in more male-\ndominated classroom activities. Boys in that study received\n70% of the F grades. However, a solution may be found in\nHawley and Reichert (2010) found that what works well for\nboys were lessons that: * produce products; * are structured as\ngames; * involve vigorous motor activity; * give boys\nresponsibility for promoting learning of others; * challenge boys\nto address \"open\" unsolved problems; * require a combination\nof teamwork and competition; and * introduce dramatic\nnovelties and surprises. (p. 29)\nAs noted above, there is growing support for all-boys\nschools with males as teachers and administrators. However,\nsome have expressed concern and caution against pigeonhol-\ning and warehousing male students as low performers\n(Cooper, 2006). \"Despite the claim that male teachers are\nmore tolerant of `hands-on' learning, there is no available\nevidence that this actually produces better educational out-\n(VE) Curriculum to address students' school failure. Froese-\nGermain (2006) advised that attempts should be made to\nidentify which boys were failing, rather than categorizing\nthem all as failures based on their gender. Nevertheless, low\nSES boys generally do have poorer educational outcomes\nNotwithstanding, a solution is possible.\nPublic school educators and parents have expressed sup-\nport for single-gender schools (Chambers, 2009; Harris,\n2009). Such support could compel principals to address the\nconcern raised in Boys (\"Let Boys Be Boys,\" 2003), which\nreported,\nEducators are beginning to quantify an \"enthusiasm gap\"\nbetween girls and boys in co-ed public schools. The reason:\nSchools, especially elementary schools, have become feminized.\nElementary school teachers and administrators, who once\nunderstood that boys will be boys, now act, at least, as though\nthey expect boys to be more like girls. Their hostility to the male\ncharacter--intentional or not--is turning boys off learning. (p. 1)\nThe NCLB has offered principals the means to eliminate\nmaleness as an excuse for male student failure, just as Title 1\nwas earlier enacted to eliminate poverty as an excuse for the\n6 SAGE Open\nfailure of low SES students (Ett, 2008). A history of the prob-\nlem illuminates the issue. According to Ett (2008), way prior\nfailing, and the majority of the nation's northern students\nwere from prosperous families, because an influx of poor\nstudents began to enter northern schools, schools adopted a\nstance aimed at education of the majority. Thus, Ett (2008)\nrevealed, \"early attempt at `tracking' created special schools\nfor physically and mentally handicapped children\" (p. 29).\nThose schools\ncontained \"special classes\" filled with children who were\nconsidered \"backward\" or \"disruptive.\" These were unruly\nclasses filled with a majority of boys, most of who suffered from\nno physical or developmental problems. They simply did not fit\nthe profile of the normal child and were relegated to a limited\nGiven that NCLB requires success for all the nation's\nschools, principals are situated at the forefront of this chal-\nlenge, similar to how schools were similarly situated and\nchallenged to regain the nation's pride after the Soviet's\nspectacular space success. Principals have the power to\nshape school culture and the tools to make a difference (Deal\n& Peterson, 1999). Irrespective of the challenges presented\nby their gender and other characteristics, they must possess\nthe wisdom to guide change while navigating resistance\n(Evans, 2004). However, moderators and malleable factors\ninfluence school performance.\nSocioeconomic Integration\nintegration to correct the failure of Black (and Hispanic)\nurban students. He asserts that Blacks who attended (White)\nschools desegregated by socioeconomic integration attained\ngreater school success than their peers in urban segregated\nschools. He revealed that the assertion angered Black leaders\nbecause they misunderstood him. The 1960 Coleman Report\nadvanced similar argument (Mickelson & Greene, 2006).\nWhite suburban schools, Blacks (and Hispanics) were\nexposed to their peers' self-empowering linguistics, their\nmiddle-class values, and related social and cultural capitals.2\nHe asserts middle-class values, not students' color, was the\nmost significant factor behind Black (or Hispanic) success in\naforementioned schools. Such values included middle-class\nparents' in-school involvement--which was more highly\nregarded and respected by school administrators. Herein one\ncan understand the angst of Black leaders who challenged\nKahlenberg's assertion. They were being asked to accept that\ntheir children's success impinged on the devaluation of their\ncommunities and the embrace of \"Acting White\" advanced\nin Fordham and Ogbu (1986)--which caused many smart\nBlack youth to devalue achievement striving, not wanting to\nbe isolated from, or ostracized, by their peers in their neigh-\nborhoods. The phenomenon is a troubling problem that needs\nto be explored. Many smart NYC Black youth may not get\ninto the city's specialized high schools for the reasons\ndiscussed.\nIn Search of Framework for a Model to Counter\nBlaming the Victims of Miseducation\nindividuals (including educators) subscribe to deficit-think-\ning theory in blaming the victims (Blacks and Latinos) for\nschool failure (Ford etal., 2011). Some studies highlight\nthe dearth of Black role models in school leadership posi-\ntions who could (a) provide a counter narrative in culturally\nrelevant pedagogy advanced in Ladson-Billings (1995) or\n(b) the embrace of intercultural sensitivity wherein \"they\nare willing to modify their behavior as an indication of\nrespect for the people of other cultures\" (Bhawuk & Brislin,\nHowever, other studies provide a framework for improv-\ning NYC urban schools. Examples are works such as Larsen\nurban schools led by White and Black male administrators.\nAgain, the literature is informative, with studies (e.g., Gerhart\ncessful urban schools led by either Black or White adminis-\ntrators, or both groups coleading schools to successful\noutcomes for students.\nNotwithstanding the need for racial minorities to see role\nmodels in school leadership (Ett, 2008), the remedy must\nneither be underscored nor obviated with principals who are\nracialized tokens (Flores, 2011), token men, token females\nare not reflective practitioners. Token individuals, especially\ngiven the condition of some male teachers' reluctance to\nworking with female principals, are unlikely to be up to the\nchallenge, or possess the withitness (Barton, 2010) to edu-\ncate NYC (difficult) youth. For example, as a VE teacher, I\nwas subjected to the meet, greet, and discuss modus operandi\nof a White female AP; I thoroughly resented the process\nbecause I had never done such things before; I came out of a\nschool where such activities were never practiced, and I\nfrankly viewed it as feminine. Consequently, a charge of\ninsubordination was lodged against me, which the White\nmale principal overturned.\nIt is not that I lacked commitment to students. But inter-\nacting with male students who have been exposed to the\ncriminal justice system, who may both look up and down on\nme (I am 6 feet tall and many students are more than 6 feet),\nwho are street-wise, and who have been failed by traditional\nschool required that I develop a different persona or a withit-\nness to relate to them. The newly appointed AP lacked such\nwithitness regarding her staff.\nThe emerging problem NYC schools must address is to\navoid having administrators of either gender with no trade or\nindustry experience flaunting NYSED regulation and lead-\ning VE or Career and Technical Education (CTE) schools.\nThe problem has emerged because of the state's Career\nDevelopment and Occupational Studies (CDOS) require-\nments necessitating more CTE certified instructors and\nadministrators. It is a problem similar to that where, under\nthe Bloomberg administration, individuals with little or no\nteaching experience became school administrators, causing\nChancellor Fari\u00f1a's previously noted action.\nIt is an imperative to address the problem because VE was\nfound to encourage dropout-prone male students to complete\ntheir education (Green, 2012), and undermining the program\nwith unqualified administrators is counterproductive and in\nviolation of the NYSED laws and hurtful to students. Schools\ncannot grant CTE credits if the teachers are not certified, as\nsome NYC schools/programs are presently doing.\nVE\nChambers (2009) revealed how loud, boisterous, and physi-\ncal male students received significant number of Grade F.\nThose students' behavior could be frightening to teachers,\nand the resulting loss of class time due to office referrals or\nsuspensions could contribute to the number of F grades\ngiven. However, previously referenced studies, and some I\nam currently undertaking in NYC schools, confirm that male\nstudents received significantly more Grade F compared with\nfemale students. A noteworthy contradiction is that in NYC\ngifted high schools, there are more male students, implying\nmore gifted males received higher grades than gifted female\nstudents. According to the latest data, the majority of stu-\ndents in the city (and the nation's) gifted schools were Asians\n(NCES, 2008). Nonetheless, various studies (e.g., Gloria &\nsuccess and the problems Asians face with meeting the\nexpectations of being the \"model minority\" and the poster\nchild for academic success. The fact that students can be\nvocationally gifted (Green, 2012) warranted this line of dis-\ncussion. It is also noteworthy that throughout the nation,\nGray (2004) explained how male students need kinesthet-\nically enhanced (mobile) classrooms experience. An exam-\nple of such pedagogical practice/classroom facilities is\nprovided in the School of Cooperative Technical Education\n(Co-Op Tech). It is an alternative education VE program in\nNYC school performance is also assessed on college or\ncareer readiness performance scores. The career component\nis the assessment of CTE/VE subjects taught in schools.\nSome of the city's academic schools also offer CTE/VE.\nCo-Op Tech, established in 1946, is a model VE program\nthat attracts many interested students, especially males who\nfailed regular schools, or those sentenced by the courts to\nattend school as an alternative to incarceration. Students in\nthe program are not subjected to the high-stake tests they\nfaced in regular high schools. Many successful students\ncomplete their study with a high paying skill, and New York\nState (NYS) or industry licenses/certificates. Skills include\nplumbing, carpentry, computer repairs, welding, child care,\nvision care, building maintenance, and culinary arts. Male\nstudents enjoy the hands-on approach to learning, the com-\npetition, the interaction with male teachers and their no-non-\nsense approach--gained from their earlier experience as\nindustry tradesmen.3 Their interactions exemplify the vigor-\nous activities recommended in Johnson and Gooliaff (2013)\nto address male students' failure.\nHowever, in a manner demonstrating the devaluing of VE\nin NYC (as it was eliminated from NYC middle schools),\nCo-OpTech's school building was sold by Mayor Bloomberg.\nConsequently, some teachers were left floundering to find\nnew sites, while others were assigned to cold basements.\nDespite the problem, students attended the unsuitable classes.\nOther evidence of VE devaluation is its current use as pro-\ngrams to shunt/\"dump\" special need students.\nWhile Common Core State Standards (CCSS) is designed\nto eliminate curricula that are not rigorous, schools are\nrequired to educate students who can only be a tradesper-\nson's helper. According to NYSED (2013), disabled students\nwho are unable to earn a regular diploma may graduate with\nonly the NYS CDOS Commencement Credential, only as\nlong as the students are provided \"access to career and tech-\nnical education (CTE) coursework and opportunities to\nengage in school supervised work-based learning experi-\nences, either in school and/or in the community\" (paras. 4-5).\nSome such students cannot remember instruction without\nbeing continually told what to do, whereas others can master\na single skill and perform it repetitiously; thereby justifying\nmy earlier tradesperson helper reference.\nPreviously, such students were kept in academic schools\nand were issued a \"worthless\" Individualized Education\nProgram (IEP) diploma if they passed the state exam.\nCollege and the military did not accept the IEP diploma, but\nwould accept it in conjunction with the local high school\ndiploma. Said institutions do not accept the CDOS creden-\ntials, which some educators revealed is so worthless the\nstate does not call it a diploma. Its purpose is to certify to\nemployers that the holder possesses employability and\ntrainability skills. Because of the new state regulations,\nacademic schools without certified CTE personnel are inca-\npable of providing CTE/credits or certification. Therefore,\na once vibrant VE curriculum at Co-Op Tech is becoming\nwatered down as a very expensive way to accommodate\nspecial needs students, whom principals from other schools\nare happy to send. According to Lehr and Lange (2003),\n\"Use of alternative schools avoids addressing the systemic\nissue. Once we create an alternative school, the high school\nis off the hook. They don't have to change in order to serve\nthese kids\" (p. 10).\n8 SAGE Open\nAt Co-Op Tech, the principal revealed, it costs over\ncombined costs of any two Ivy League colleges. Still, Co-Op\nTech is a program and is not listed as one of the DOE's CTE\nschools. Currently, 38% of the city's 50 CTE schools are\nCTE schools are mostly led by males. However, the gender\nof the staff and the type of courses being offered were not\ndetermined.\nThe aforementioned undertaking is an expensive way to\ntrack students (assigned to certain classes based on real or\nperceived ability). Notwithstanding, tracking has a historical\npedigree in the U.S. educational system, wherein VE was\nused as a dumping ground for Blacks and those described as\nthe intellectually feeble-minded (Green, 2012). Historically,\nsuch actions caused many Black and other interested parents\nto shun VE for their children. It must be noted, nationwide,\nAsians do not take VE in any significant number (Green,\nAt Co-Op Tech, VE teachers are generally older males, but\nas they retire, and there is a problem with finding experienced\ntradesmen to become vocational instructors, more female\neducators are being hired. However, they are not entering as\nteachers of carpentry, welding, plumbing, bricklaying, elec-\ntricity, and other hard-hat VE trades more appealing to male\nstudents, but rather as special needs teacher, teachers of\ncourses such as medical billing, medical office assistants--\nmore appealing to female students. The problem here is while\nhard-hat and kinesthetically orientated VE courses encourage\nmale students to complete their education, CTE schools are\nnow offering more sit-down and less movement-orientated\ncourses, such as those previously described and others deal-\ning with some areas of information technology.\nA reason is many of the new teachers do not have the\nNYSED licensure requirements of 2 years industry experi-\nence. Consequently, because finding qualified CTE teacher\nis a widespread problem (Green, 2012), some principals hire\nuncertified individuals with work experience alluding to\nCTE. The problem of hiring is more pronounced when the\nprincipals have no CTE experience, as required by NYSED\nlaws.\nIt is less risky for principals to employ individuals claim-\ning to have medical office management or web design skills\nas opposed to employing those claiming to have carpentry or\nelectrical installation skills. Although the former individuals\ncan have students sit at a computer and learn, even if experi-\nenced carpenters were employed, without CTE credentials,\nthey cannot teach students how to use power saw and other\npower equipment. In fact, in NYS, a non-CTE certified\nteacher cannot legally cover a CTE shop class if the CTE\nteacher is absent, but a CTE teacher can cover an academic\nclass.\nThe overall fact is, though \"VE\" has been changed to\n\"CTE\" to provide more acceptability (and perhaps finesse),\nit is a viable option for all students (Green, 2012), and the\nvoluntary sabotaging described in the preceding may have\nimplications related to the feminization of VE courses, short-\nage of CTE teachers and administrators, and the attempts to\ncomply with NYSED law by trying to circumvent them.\nNotwithstanding, as advanced in Green (2012), there is a\nneed for NYC to establish VE schools for students who are\nalso gifted in that field. Therefore, more technically compe-\ntent, higher educated, and state-licensed VE teachers are\nneeded. Such requirements are a tenet of NCLB. According\nto NCLB, every public school teacher must be highly quali-\nfied. \"Under the law, `highly qualified' generally meant that\na teacher was certified and demonstrably proficient in his or\nher subject matter\" (\"No Child Left Behind,\" 2004, para. 7).\nThe establishment of a gifted vocational program is within\nthe purview of current District 79's superintendent, Dr. Tim\nLisante, who can make the recommendation to the current\nNYC school chancellor, Carmen Fari\u00f1a. The framework for\na gifted VE high school could be similar to the city's special-\nized high schools for linguistically and logically mathemati-\ncally gifted students. However, for that to happen, District 79\nmust embrace a Type I alternative education framework, as\nopposed to a Type II or III.\nAccording to Raywid (1994), Type I includes magnet\nschools with high quality programs. Type II offers programs\nfor students who are too disruptive for regular school and are\nbeing offered a last chance before expulsion. Type III is for\nremedial and rehabilitation to allow students to return to their\nhomeschool. For District 79 to adopt a Type I framework,\nstakeholders must apply pressure. The District was over-\nhauled in 2007 because many at-risk students--identified by\nmarkers such as poor grades, truancy, pregnancy, and disrup-\ntive behavior--were being abandoned in its programs\nMany NYC children from other parts of the world were\nexposed to strong VE programs, as I was exposed as a youth\nin Jamaica, West Indies (WI). Based on my 20 years teaching\nexperience in the United States, students who have previous\nVE experience are more likely to activate their prior knowl-\nedge and excel at the subject when reintroduced to it.\nTherefore, Green (2012) outlined the importance for students\nto be exposed to VE at an early age and not when they are 19\nyears old. At that age, they are mostly sent to be hidden in a\nVE program to get them out of academic schools, where the\nprincipals do not want those students'low-performing scores\nto negatively affect the (principals') schools' report card\ngrades. So students may be pushed out of traditional school\nin a subtle or overt manner (Lehr & Lange, 2003).\nSchool Size\n\"School size affects student participation and satisfaction\nindependent of the effects of SES and academic ability\"\n(Mickelson & Greene, 2006, para. 6). Most learning was\ngenerated in midsize schools of \"600 to 900 students,\" less in\nrelatively smaller schools, and the least in large schools (Lee\nrimental impact that large schools imposed on students, in\nparticular low SES students and students of color, were\ndelineated in numerous studies (Darling-Hammond, 2006;\nDarling-Hammond, Ross, & Milliken, 2007). On the con-\ntrary, small schools had positive impact on such students.\nIn NYC for example, Manpower Demonstration Research\nCorporation (MDRC, 2013) reported, \"Findings show that\nthe [small] schools, which serve mostly disadvantaged stu-\ndents of color, continue to produce sustained positive effects\n. . .\" (para. 1). However, small schools and success were not\nan absolute, as a school's success could be a function of the\nimpact of principal gender (Freigruber, 2009). Ornstein\n(1993) found students had higher achievement in larger\nlarge schools took more courses compared with those in\nsmall schools. Given the mixed results, this study is\nwarranted.\nThe literature justified the need for a study of principal\ngender, school performance, and related factors. This study\nwill contribute to the present body of knowledge by situating\nthe nation's largest school system in the literature regarding\nthe impact of principal and student gender on school perfor-\nmance. Its approach encourages the inclusion of the point of\nview of stakeholders who are fast becoming the new major-\nity, and who seek answers to their questions regarding NYC\nschool failure, especially the failure of male youth. In addi-\ntion, it lays the foundation for future studies to examine the\ninteractions of race and gender, concentrating on the experi-\nences of Black and Latina principals, as recommended in\nMethod\nThis study employed five research questions to determine\nwhether differences in performance/demographic scores\nexisted in NYC schools based on the interactions of principal\nand/or student, gender, or other factors. Publicly available\ndata were obtained from the NYCDOE (2013a) website con-\ning high schools, and NYCDOE (2013b) containing the\nmerging of data from both sites resulted in 459 high schools\nwith the requisite data set. To facilitate data analysis, the\nschools'performance grades (A, B, C, D, or F) were assigned\nnumerical values as follows (NCLB grade definitions are\nshown in brackets):\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 A = 4 (schools making excellent progress),\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 B = 3 (schools making above-average progress),\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 C = 2 (schools making satisfactory progress),\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 D = 1 (schools making less than satisfactory prog-\nress), and\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 F = 0 (schools failing to make adequate progress).\nIn addition, gender was also assigned a numerical value\n(female = 1, male = 2).\nMicrosoft Excel was used to perform sort functions, cal-\nculate mean, percentages for principal and student gender,\nand to filter data.\nData Analysis\nData were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statis-\ntics. Excel database was used to perform initial sorting and\nfiltering functions, while Predictive Analytics\nSoftware (PASW) facilitated statistical analyses. Tests\nincluded ANOVA, independent-sample t test, and a Kruskal\u00ad\nWallis.ANOVAs returning significance were further explored\nwith Levene's test of equality of variance and Tukey's post\nhoc. The Kruskal\u00adWallis was used to facilitate nonparametric\nand inferential statistical analysis. Kruskal\u00adWallis is not\nencumbered by strict requirements of mean and variance,\nrelative to sample size, that is required for parametric analyti-\ncal procedures (Green, 2012). Notwithstanding, it has its own\nstrict requirements. Its use was appropriate because some\nindependent variables had four or more outcomes, and Staten\nIsland introduced low sample sizes. The different tests\nnegated the possibly of Type I error. A Type I error can lead\nthe researcher to draw erroneous conclusions (Yockley, 2011).\nAnalysis for Research Question 2 was conducted in three\nphases. The first phase incorporated the A, B, C, D, and Fs of\nschool assessment more familiar to parents, educators, and\nother stakeholders. The second, with boxplots, checked\nassumptions and obtained a sense of the data, while the third\naccommodated in-depth statistical analysis. The approach\nwas undertaken to help advance the use and/or understanding\nof data analysis in stakeholders such as students, parents, and\neducators.\nResults\nResearch Question 1: Based on the NYC school perfor-\nmance scores (OS and college and career readiness scores\n[C&CRS]), is there a significant difference in the school\nboroughs' capacity to educate students?\nA Kruskal\u00adWallis explored the question. The result\ndepicted in Figure 2 indicates significant differences between\nhighest mean rank of 223.15 for Staten Island compared with\nthe lowest mean rank of 169.04 for Brooklyn. Significant\ndifferences were also found between the boroughs' C&CRS,\nof 251 for Staten Island compared with the lowest mean rank\nOverall, Staten Island's schools were the highest ranked\nfor (a) educating NYC students and (b) preparing them for\ncollege. Brooklyn's schools were the lowest rated in both\nregards.\nResearch Question 2: Based on principal gender and\nschool borough, is there a significant relation in the distri-\nbution of the C&CRS NYC schools received?\nTable 1 displays the result of a cross-tabulation of the factors\nunder study. It reveals that of the 100 schools that received\nGradeA, the majority had female principals and were located in\nManhattan. Of the schools that received Grades D and F, the\nmajority had male principals and were located in Bronx (n = 13)\nand Brooklyn (n = 18). Based on the data, Manhattan's female\nprincipals generated the most Grade A (n =19). In contrast,\nBrooklyn's male principals generated the most Grade F (n = 5).\nA boxplot (see Figure 3) reveals Brooklyn female principals\nreceived a few extremely low scores (outliers), but Bronx\nand Brooklyn male principals had higher frequencies of out-\nliers. Such low scores could indicate skewness and a viola-\ntion of the normal distribution and equal variance\nrequirements for analysis with two-way ANOVA (Weinberg\n& Abromowitz, 2008). However, a histogram (see Figure 4)\nreveals the appearance of normal distribution; thus, a threat\nto my ANOVA was mitigated. In sum, cursory analysis indi-\ncates that scores did not vary significantly as a function of\nprincipal gender, but they did as a function of borough.\nA two-way between-subject ANOVA with the C&CRS as the\ndependent variable and principal gender and NYC borough as\nthe independent variables (see Table 2) reveals that (a) princi-\nwas significant; and (c) the combination of principal gender\nOverall, principal gender did not make a borough-wide\nsignificant difference in the NYC schools' capacity to pre-\npare students for college or career. However, the data on\nNYC borough (p = .00) in Table 2 confirmed that individual\ndifferences existed between the boroughs. How the boroughs\ndiffered from one another was the subject of further\nanalysis.\nIn the appendix, pairwise comparison using the multiple\ncomparisontablegeneratedfromaTukeyHonestlySignificant\nDifference (HSD) post hoc reveals that Manhattan against\nBrooklyn's scores produce a mean difference of .54 and a p\nvalue of .001. As p is less than .05, Brooklyn's schools were\nsignificantly less capable of preparing students for college or\ncareer compared with Manhattan's schools.

The\ncomparison of Staten Island against Brooklyn's scores pro-\nduces a mean difference of .96 and a p value of .027. As p is\nless than .05, Brooklyn's schools were significantly less capa-\nble of preparing students for college or career compared with\nStaten Island's schools.\nOverall, as confirmed by the score (M = 2.44 = Grade C)\nin Figure 5, Brooklyn's schools taught by either male or\nfemale principals were the least successful at preparing NYC\nstudents for college or career. Staten Island's schools with\nscore amounting to Grade A, especially in schools taught by\nmale principals (no significant differences in principal gen-\nder withstanding; t = .552, p >.05), were the most successful\nat preparing NYC students for college and career.\nResearch Question 3: Is there a significant relation\nbetween the college and career readiness scores (C&CRS)\nof NYC male students based on percent mean enrollment\nand principal gender?\nFigure 6 indicates the majority of the city's male students\ngenerated Grade F irrespective of principal gender. In addi-\ntion, fewer male students received Grade A, especially those\nin schools led by female principals.\nA two-way between-subject ANOVA with the percent\nmale students as the dependent variable and principal gender\nand C&CRS as the independent variables facilitated in-depth\nanalysis.

As such, the schools led by\nBrooklyn male principals generated significantly higher\nELA and math tests scores compared with female-princi-\npal-led schools. In addition, Queens's female principals had\nsignificantly higher percentage of Black and Hispanic stu-\ndents compared with the borough's male principals. No\nother results were significant. Overall, while Staten Island's\nmale principals benefited from having the higher perform-\ning students, its female principals had the highest number\nof special needs students. The result is manifested in the\ndiscrepancy in scores where Staten Island male-principal-\nled schools, with fewer Black students and with fewer indi-\nces of poverty, returned higher scores than schools led by\nits female principals.\nDiscussion\nThis study used secondary NYC school report card data to\ndetermine whether there were differences in the boroughs'\ncapacity to educate students; if feminization was occurring,\nhow it possibly shaped school achievement scores and the\npossible implications for male students; whether there were\nmoderating variables that informed the performance of NYC\nschools; and how the characteristics of schools differed\nbased on principal gender. Overall, principal gender did not\nmake a borough-wide significant difference in the NYC\nschools' capacity to prepare students for college or career.\nHowever, it affected an individual borough. Therefore,\nStaten Island male principals were the most successful at\npreparing NYC students for college or career. Male or female\nprincipals in Brooklyn's schools were the least successful in\nthat regard. Female principals led the city's smallest schools,\nwhich concentrated poverty, had more female students, and\nwere the lowest performing schools.\nBoroughs' Capacity Based on Overall and College\nand Career Readiness Scores\nStaten Island's schools generated the highest rating for pre-\nparingNYCstudentsforcollegeorcareer,whereasBrooklyn's\nschools were rated the lowest.

In contrast, Brooklyn had a\nlower household income (US$46,085), and its schools had a\nmajority Black or Hispanic population (M = 86%).\nPrincipal Gender and School Borough, and\nRelation to School Performance\nFemale Manhattan principals generated the most Grade A\n(n = 19). In contrast, male principals in Brooklyn generated\nthe most Grade F (n = 5). In addition, as previously stated,\nStaten Island male-principal-led schools were rated the high-\nest compared with Brooklyn's male- and female-principal-led\nlowest rated schools. The discrepancy was explained by insti-\ntutional and situational segregation. In addition, Ett (2008),\nArnold and Doctoroff (2003), and Legewie and Diprete\n(2012) aligned school failure with the poverty of various stu-\ndents based on gender and other characteristics. This is a key\npoint because Staten Island schools had the lowest ELL,\nBlack, or Hispanic students; the lowest poverty levels; as well\nas the highest performing math/ELA students.\nIn regard to poverty, the difference in household income\n(US$26,474) between Staten Island and Brooklyn is stark.\nHowever, the lowest income among the boroughs was Bronx at\nUS$34,388. Such disparity illuminates the possible middle-\nhow socioeconomically integrated schools, irrespective of\nlocations, were more successful than segregated Black schools.\nStaten Island schools were fairly socioeconomically integrated,\nwhile Brooklyn's were highly Black or Hispanic segregated.\nParadoxically, if poverty was a major factor in school per-\nformance, Bronx with a household income of US$34,388,\ninstead of Brooklyn, should be the lowest performing bor-\nough. Coincidentally, Bronx's schools with Black or Hispanic\nstudent populations (M = 92.3%) were the most segregated\nof all the boroughs--predicting its failure as per the Coleman\nReport. However, the paradox in its better performance than\nBrooklyn's performance is explained by the fact that Bronx\nhad more than twice the percentage of Hispanic or Black and\nfewer male students compared with Brooklyn. Nationwide,\nHispanic students now generate higher achievement scores\nthan Blacks (U.S. DOE, 2014). In addition, male students\ngenerated lower academic scores (Chambers, 2009).\nCollege and Career Readiness Scores, Male\nStudents Enrollment, and Principal Gender\nPrincipal gender was not a significant factor in the college or\ncareer scores received by male students. However, male stu-\ndents received significantly lower number of Grade A college\nand career readiness scores compared with female students.\nIn addition, Brooklyn's male principals had significantly\nmore male students. Thus, Brooklyn results contradict the lit-\nfeminization and male students' failure. Still, it is no\nconsolation to parents, and the borough's political leadership,\nthat Brooklyn, a significant African American community,\nwas the worst performing school borough in the city. The\nbasis for the discrepancy may transcend principal gender and\npoints to other factors in the discussion. However, the numer-\nical majority of the city's schoolteachers were females.\nTherefore, if \"feminized\" pedagogical practices were a factor\nin male students'lower school performance, it would be inde-\npendent of principal gender (male and female principals will\nhave more female teachers compared with males).\nNotwithstanding, as previously noted, feminized pedagogical\npractices would be incompatible with boys' socialization and\nlearning styles (Martino & Kehler, 2006).\nBeyond feminization is the racial component, wherein the\nmajority of NYC principals were White middle-class\nfemales, and the majority of students were low SES Black\nand Hispanic and males. Pollard (1997) spoke of the need to\nexamine the interactions of race and gender as this is a criti-\ncal issue not covered well in the literature. Principals' role\nmodeling to, interaction with, and understanding of students\nand their cultures can enhance success for both groups\n2012). Importantly, the NYSED and the Regents identified\nthe need for diversity in the state's school leadership cadre.\nWe need to recruit from a more diverse talent pool when we look\nfor school leaders. At least that is the impression one gets in\nlooking over the crowd at many of the Leadership Forums. This\nis part of the problem, and part of the opportunity before us. It\nmust be made a high priority. (para. 8)\nGraham and Erwin (2011) supported Secretary of\nEducation Duncan's assessment implicating the pathology of\nemployment discrimination facing Black teachers as a root\ncause for the dearth of Black school administrators. Karpinski\n(2006) revealed how the dearth of Black principals contrib-\nuted to the current failure of Black males.\nPrincipal Gender, School Borough, and\nCharacteristics of Schools at the Highest and\nLowest Performance Levels\nThe findings here indicate that large male-principal-led\nschools (M = 2,180), with majority White and Asian student\npopulation of practically equal gender, in the majority White-\npopulated Staten Island school borough returned the highest\nscores for preparing the city's youth for college and careers.\nThis result is inconsistent with the findings of MDRC's\n(2013), linked to the Gates Foundation, that touted the higher\nsuccess of small NYC schools serving Black or Hispanic and\ndisabled students. It offers a rival hypothesis that asserts that\nthe city's small school initiative of shuttering large failed\nschools and converting them to smaller more expensive ones\nhighlight an issue of major significance to NYC schools.\nTo further refute other findings, medium size schools (M =\n516) led by female principals in the majority White-populated\nborough of Manhattan, with the third lowest Black and\nHispanic student population, were also found to be more\neffective at preparing NYC students for college or career.\nMickelson and Greene (2006) reported on the higher success\nof medium size schools. In contrast, small male- or female-\nprincipal-led majority Black or Hispanic schools in the city's\nlargest White-populated borough--Brooklyn (more than\ntwice the White population of Staten Island)--were the least\nsuccessful. Highlighting the racial/ethnic population of the\nboroughs is key because four of the five boroughs are major-\nity Whites, yet the most integrated one (Staten Island)--with\nmajority White students--attained the highest success. This\nwas also true for the second highest integrated borough,\nQueens, whose schools attained the second highest perform-\ning scores of all the boroughs. Therefore, socioeconomically\nintegrating NYC schools could improve their performance.\nSocioeconomically integrating NYC schools avoids the\ndilemma in desegregating the city's failing schools.\nmethods of forced desegregation, now being overturned by\nthe Supreme Court, were ineffective. Therefore, NYC alter-\nnative initiative to improve its schools by restructuring large\nfailed ones into smaller ones is supported by Kahlenberg.\nHowever, he asserts that the new schools must be socioeco-\nnomically integrated, which can also be achieved through the\ncreation of magnet schools to attract middle-class students.\nTherefore, merely converting large schools to smaller ones\nwould not assure success (Lee & Smith, 1997; Schneider,\nThe Select Characteristics of Schools Based on\nPrincipal Gender and School Borough\nThe city's smallest schools led by female principals in\nManhattan were the lowest rated for preparing students for col-\nlege or career. The schools enrolled 96% Black or Hispanic\nstudents, had significantly fewer male students (76.15% female\nstudents), and the majority of the students had disabilities. The\npathological outcomes of (a) school segregation, (b) concentra-\ntion of poverty, (c) the warehousing of students with special\nneeds, and those who received the lowest scores on NYS's\neighth-grade ELA and math tests were demonstrated. Those\nfactors were found to be significantly associated with failing\nNYC schools. The issue of the new state requirements for spe-\ncial needs student was thoroughly discussed, and the pathology\nof their warehousing was discussed in Lehr and Lange (2003).\nIn this study, female principals' wish to be associated with\nchallenged students is in keeping with Durrah (2009) and Eagly\netal. (1992). However, the failing schools they led here, with\nmajority Black or Hispanic female students, were almost like\nsingle-gender schools. Their dismal failure was not what stake-\nholders envisioned in their support for small single-gender\nThe question is whether female administrators, especially\nBlack and Latina, have a choice in accepting schools with chal-\nlenged students. Are such schools and students stepping stone\nfor experience and later move to better positions?\nTo ensure that NYC school failure is not being ascribed to\nfemale principals, it must be pointed out that male principals\nin similarly small schools in Bronx and Brooklyn had com-\nparable scores. In addition and in contrast, Staten Island male\nprincipals had insignificant number of ELL students.\nTherefore, failure could be attributed to the attitudes and per-\nceptions of educators, as it could be to factors in students'\nhomes or in their early education. The basis for such state-\nment is evident in the disparate scores generated when the\nstate's third-grade students are first exposed to high-stake\nELA and math test. The result shows Asians, Whites, Native\nAmericans, Latinos, and then Blacks in order of highest to\nConclusion\nPrincipal leadership, which entails guidance for administrative\nstaff, community outreach, and public relations, affects both\nteachers' effectiveness and students' performance. Therefore,\nit is critical that principals receive support and are provided\nwith needed resources. Principals must have the flexibility\nneeded to mediate between schools and their various public\nstakeholders such as parents, teachers, and students.\nAs our demographic shift unfolds, schools and their com-\nmunities will become more diverse. Therefore, principals\nmust act to include all vested members of the school com-\nmunity and to develop ways to address their concerns\n(Piraino, 2009). Similar to how the failure of the nation's\nschools is a pressing concern of NCLB, as reaffirmed by the\nObama administration (U.S. DOE, 2015), the failure of\nBlack male students is a pressing concern among many New\nYork residents, demanding attention from the city's high\nschool principals.4 This study provides a way for NYC prin-\ncipals to navigate the complexity of the problem and respond\nto their various communities with answers that are research\nbased. The following reiterates some important findings:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Staten Island's male-principal-led schools were the\nhighest rated at preparing NYC students for college or\ncareers. The schools were large and majority Whites;\nthey had the highest math and ELA scoring students.\nThe relevance of this result speaks to the impact of socio-\neconomic integration as a means to improve the city's\nschools.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Brooklyn's highly Black or Hispanic segregated schools\nled by either male or female principals were rated the\nlowest at preparing NYC students for college or careers.\nThe relevance of this result speaks to the need to address\na looming problem, where students comprising the\nnations' minority\u00admajority are not being properly edu-\ncated, especially in the areas of science, technology, engi-\nneering, and math (STEM). This pathology bespeaks a\nlooming national security crisis, wherein the groups his-\ntorically receive the least number of STEM degrees. The\nDepartment of Defense is concerned that, in the next\ndecade, there will not be enough STEM graduates to\nreplace its aging STEM workforce. In addition, to have\nBrooklyn, the de facto Black capital of the world (Shipp,\n1991), seen internationally as a borough of academically\nchallenged Blacks, is not befitting of the borough of kings.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The city's male students received significantly more\nGrade F for college or career preparedness. They also\nconstituted the lowest overall percentage of enrollees\nin the city's highest performing schools. The rele-\nvance of this result speaks to the need to address the\ncontinued failure of male students. VE can address the\nproblem, but its current misuse as a dumping ground\nis reminiscent of a past practice, where poor male stu-\ndents were housed in special schools for physically\nand mentally handicapped children (Ett, 2008). In\naddition, evidence of the feminization of VE courses\ndoes not augur well for male students who need the\ndynamic and mobile learning environment.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The city's large, followed by its medium, schools\nwere the highest performing, whereas its small schools\nwere the lowest performing.\nThe relevance of this result speaks to the need to reexam-\nine the city's small school policy, where large schools are\nbeen converted to smaller more expensive ones. Large\nfailing schools converted to small schools with the same\nfailed students will amount to the concentration of failure\nand poverty in more schools. For the conversion to work,\nschools must adopt socioeconomic integration, also\nachievable through magnet schools.\nOther important findings are stated below without elabo-\nration. They are stated to generate a conversation between\neducators, parents and their children, stakeholders, their\nschools, and their political leaders.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Queens' female principals had significantly more\nBlack or Hispanic students compared with the bor-\nough's male principals.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Brooklyn's male-principal-led schools generated sig-\nnificantly higher math/ELA scores compared with the\nborough's female-principal-led schools.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The city's female principals had more special needs\nstudents compared with male principals.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Staten Island's female principals had the highest per-\ncentage of students with disabilities, whereas Queens'\nmale principals had the lowest percentage.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Bronx's male principals had the highest percentage of\nBlack or Hispanic students, whereas Staten Island had\nthe lowest.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Queen's schools were the second highest performing\nand, like Staten Island's schools, were reasonably\nsocioeconomically integrated.\nA major finding generated from my qualitative analysis of\nthe school report card data used in this study is that schools\nwith more Asian students attained higher performance\nscores. In addition, Asians along with Whites were key com-\nponents of the success of the city's socioeconomically inte-\ngrated schools. Therefore, it is of great importance to\ncompare the third-grade ELA and math scores of all racial/\nethnic student groups to pinpoint where school success or\nschool failure begins. Third grade is where public school stu-\ndents take their first state assessment test.\nThis study emanated from Pollard's (1997) and Flores's\n(2011) recommendations for further studies on the topic, and\nit lays the foundation for the future examination of the expe-\nriences of Black, Hispanic, male, female, and other NYC\nprincipals. It illuminated issues of educational significance\nthat will be taking center stage as the race to improve the\nnation's schools to educate the emerging \"minority\u00admajor-\nity\" becomes a matter of national security. It informs the\nneed for stakeholders in the various boroughs, especially\nBrooklyn, to demand accountability, and for the state to scru-\ntinize alternative schools/programs, as it moves to effectively\nimplement the CDOS program.\nThe findings, in part, reveal a link between the capacity of\nNYC schools to prepare students for college or careers, prin-\ncipals and students' gender, poverty indices, how the bor-\noughs with their different socioeconomic levels performed,\nand how complex the problem is. It highlights the need for\nforward-thinking policy decisions also focused on improving\nthe educational outcome for both male and special needs stu-\ndents, as well as critically examining the effectiveness of the\ncity's small school initiative, and its VE programs. However,\na limitation is this study only elicited input from three school\nadministrators. One, Dr. Michael Wiltshire, related how his\nCaribbean roots and his shared culture with his students\nenabled his school to be highly successful. Another adminis-\ntrator highlighting the racism and discrimination he faces,\nand an administrator who is surreptitiously and overtly chang-\ning a prime VE school into a dumping ground for lower per-\nforming students, as a means to accommodate the dumping of\nstudents being undertaken by academic school principals.\nThe data the principal presented to staff at the commence-\nment of the 2015 school year revealed the significant increas-\ning number of special needs students from District 75, which\nis responsible for educating the city's special needs students.\nAdditional data he presented revealed that it cost the school\npared with the approximately US$16,000 a year it costs for\nthe average NYC school. Are taxpayers and students being\nadequately served? Such answers can be determined by\nNYSED scrutiny and future research.\nRecommendations\nThe findings of this study recommend mindful examination\nof NYC school staffing to gauge the impact of possible femi-\nnization of the educational opportunities of both male and\nfemale students and how the lack of male role models affects\nboth groups. In addition, it supports the call for more Black\nand Hispanic administrators, culturally relevant and respon-\nsive mentoring, and other resources to help principals\nimprove performance outcomes for underperforming stu-\ndents, especially Black and Hispanic youth. It also recom-\nmends the establishment of gifted and talented VE schools,\nand an examination to determine whether VE schools were\nbeing used as dumping grounds for special needs and other\nlow-performing students.\nGiven the difficulties associated with preparing the data, it\nis also recommended that principals' gender and the number\nof male and female teachers should be included in the schools'\ndemographic data, and that the enrollment data for high\nschools (9th-12th grades) should be disaggregated from the\nlower grades of schools that serve a K-12, or similar popula-\ntion. Finally, the findings indicate that future mixed-methods\nstudies explore variables such as educators' attitudes and per-\nception in a post majority White school, students' country of\norigin, especially in the light of literature revealing immigrant\nstudents, including those from countries such as Jamaica,\nTrinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Barbados, and some countries\nin Africa, outperform native Black students (Green, 2012).\nStatistics From Multiple Comparisons of NYC Schools Based on\nC&CRS and Borough.\n(I) NYC borough (J) NYC borough MD (I-J) SE p\nAppendix\nStatistics From Pairwise Comparison of New York\nCity (NYC) Boroughs\n(I) NYC borough (J) NYC borough MD (I-J) SE p\nNote.
