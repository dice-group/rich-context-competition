However, little is known about sleep disturbance in patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator.\nAims: We examined the prevalence and predictors of sleep disturbance and the impact on perceived health status in a\nDutch cohort of implantable cardioverter defibrillator patients.\nMethods: Patients (n=195) enrolled in the Web-based distress program for implantable cardioverter defibrillator\npatients (WEBCARE) trial completed questionnaires at the time of implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation,\nthree, six and 12 months afterwards. Sleep disturbance was assessed with the corresponding item #3 of the Patient\nHealth Questionnaire 9.\nResults: At baseline, 67% (n=130) reported sleep disturbance (cut off 1). One year later, the prevalence was 57%\nat 12 months in adjusted analyses. Sleep disturbance was not associated with health status at 12 months. Charlson\nComorbidity Index, anxiety, Type D personality and high negative affectivity/low social inhibition were associated with\nimpaired health status at follow-up.\nConclusions: Sleep disturbance was highly prevalent in patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator. Younger\nage and high negative affectivity predicted sleep disturbance 12 months post-implantation independent of other\ndemographic, clinical, intervention and psychological covariates.

A Danish study found\nclinically significant sleep problems in up to 67% of\npatients.12 One American study found that patients with\nICD and co-morbid sleep problems reported increased\nfatigue, decreased mood and poorer device acceptance,8\nwhile a small study using actigraphy that measures sleep\nefficiency by means of sleep/wake cycles found that ICD\npatients had better sleep efficiency than cardiac patients\nwithout an ICD.13 This is somewhat in line with a recent\nmeta-analysis revealing that sleep disordered breathing is\nassociated with an increased incidence of appropriate ICD\ntherapy only in patients with heart failure and reduced\nejection fraction.14 This might indicate that the underlying\ndisease (e.g. heart failure) is of importance when assessing\npatient-reported outcomes (PROs) and sleep disturbances\nTheAmerican HeartAssociation has advocated the assess-\nment of cardiovascular health by using PROs, which repre-\nsent patients' subjective evaluation of their functioning.16\nGiven the association of sleep disturbances and cardiac\nand metabolic diseases,1,14 it is of utmost importance to\nexamine which patients are at risk of experiencing self-\nreported sleep disturbance and whether this affects their\nperceived health status. The objective of the current study\nwas therefore (a) to examine the prevalence of sleep dis-\nturbance in an ICD population followed over a 12-month\nperiod; (b) to longitudinally relate demographic, clinical\nand psychological variables (i.e. depression, anxiety, Type\nD personality) to sleep disturbance; and (c) examine\nwhether sleep disturbance has a negative effect on per-\nceived health status, using a prospective study design.\nMethods\nStudy design\nData from the Web-based distress program for patients\nwithanimplantablecardioverterdefibrillator(WEBCARE)\ntrial was used in the current study. The study was regis-\ndetailed description of the WEBCARE trial has been pub-\nlished elsewhere.17 In brief, WEBCARE examined the\neffectiveness of a Web-based intervention based on the\nprinciples of cognitive behavioural therapy that targeted\nsymptoms of anxiety and depression in a randomised con-\ntrolled trial design. No statistically significant differences\nwere found between the intervention versus usual care\ngroup on the pre-specified primary and secondary\nParticipants\nPatients implanted with a first-time ICD between April\nNetherlands (Amphia Hospital, Breda; Canisius-\nWilhelmina Hospital, Nijmegen; Catharina Hospital,\nEindhoven; Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam; Onze\nLieve Vrouwe Gasthuis Hospital, Amsterdam; Vlietland\nHospital, Schiedam) comprised the study population.\nParticipants were eligible for inclusion if it was their first-\ntime ICD and they were between 18\u00ad75 years of age.\nExclusion criteria were other life-threatening comorbidi-\nties (e.g. cancer), significant cognitive impairments (e.g.\ndementia), history of psychiatric illness other than affec-\ntive or anxiety disorders, life expectancy less than one\nyear, and being on the waiting list for a heart transplant.\nParticipants lacking Internet or computer skills and partici-\npants with insufficient knowledge of the Dutch language\nwere also excluded.\nProcedure\nThe ICD nurse or technician approached patients about\nstudy participation in the hospital, prior to, or shortly after,\nthe ICD implantation.All patients were informed about the\nstudy both orally and in writing. Patients who met all of\nthe inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria and\nprovided written informed consent were included in the\nstudy. Patients completed a set of standardised and vali-\ndated questionnaires at baseline (prior to leaving the hos-\npital) and at three-, six- and 12 months post-implantation,\nand these were sent to their home address together with a\npre-addressed stamped envelope. Patients received up to\nthree reminder phone calls if the questionnaires were not\nreturned within two weeks. The study protocol was\napproved by the medical ethics committees of the partici-\npating hospitals. The study was performed in accordance\nto the Declaration of Helsinki principals.\nMeasures\nDemographic and clinical variables.Information on demo-\ngraphic (age, gender, marital status, education level, body\nmass index) and clinical variables (ICD indication \u00ad\nprimary: patients at risk of experiencing sudden cardiac\narrest vs secondary: patients who have previously experi-\nenced a sudden cardiac arrest-, heart failure, New York\nHeart Association Functional Class, left ventricular ejec-\ntion fraction, QRS-width, heart rate, diabetes, comorbidi-\nties, psychotropic and cardiac drugs) were captured from\nthe patients' medical records or by self-report.\nSleep disturbance.Sleep disturbance was assessed with\nitem #3 of the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9):\n`Trouble falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much'.19\nThis item is evaluated on a four-point Likert scale ranging\nfrom zero (not at all) to three (nearly every day) and indi-\ncates sleep problems in the last two weeks. Previous\nresearch has shown that a cut off of 1 on the PHQ item #3\nprovides the best balance between sensitivity (82.5%) and\nspecificity (84.5%) and that it can be used as a valid indi-\ncation of sleep disturbance.20\nPsychological variables\nAnxiety.Symptoms of anxiety were assessed with the\nseven-item General Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7).21\nItems of the GAD-7 are answered on a four-point Likert\nscale ranging from zero (not at all) to three (almost every\nday), with the total score ranging from 0\u00ad21. Higher scores\nindicate higher levels of anxiety. The GAD-7 has an excel-\nlent internal consistency with a Cronbach's  of 0.92 and\ngood test-retest reliability with an intraclass correlation of\nDepressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms were assessed\nwith the two-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2),\nas these two items represent the core symptoms of depres-\nsion.19 This was done in order to prevent overlap with the\npredictor variable (i.e. sleep) and outcome variable (i.e.\ndepressive symptoms) in the analyses. The two items rep-\nresent the frequency of depressed mood and anhedonia\nover the past two weeks and are answered on a four-point\nLikert scale ranging from zero (not at all) to three (nearly\nevery day), with a score which can range from 0\u00ad6.22 The\nPHQ-2 has a good validity and internal consistency with a\nType D personality.Type D (distressed) personality was\nItems are rated on a five-point Likert scale ranging from\nzero (false) to four (true). The 14 items can be divided into\ntwo seven-item subscales, negative affectivity (NA; 0\u00ad28)\nand social inhibition (SI; 0\u00ad28). A cut-off score of 10 on\nboth the NA and SI subscales is used to classify Type D\npersonality. Both subscales show a high level of internal\nconsistency with a Cronbach's  of 0.88 for the NA sub-\nscale and 0.86 for the SI subscale and a high level of struc-\ntural validity with test-retest correlations of r=0.72 for the\nNA subscale and an intraclass correlation of r=0.82 for the\nHealth status.Perceived health status was assessed\nwith the 12-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12).\nThis survey is a shorter version of the 36-item Short-\nForm Health Survey (SF-36) and is a good alternative to\nthe SF-36 because of the high degree of correspondence\ncan be divided into two subscales, the Physical and the\nMental Component Summary (PCS and MCS, respec-\ntively) scores. The scores range from 0\u00ad100 with a higher\nscore indicating better perceived health status. The test-\nStatistical analyses\nTo compare patients with sleep disturbance to those with-\nout on baseline variables, Chi-square tests were performed\nto compare discrete variables and Student's t-tests were\nused to compare continuous variables. Univariate and mul-\ntivariate (hierarchical) logistic regression analyses were\nused to identify the predictors of sleep disturbance at one\nyear after implantation and to identify predictors of health\nstatus. Patients were classified as having a disturbed sleep\nif they had a 1 score on #3 item of the PHQ-9 (0=no sleep\nproblems; 1=sleep problems). In multivariable analyses,\nwe adjusted for age, gender, ICD indication, Charlson\nComorbidity Index (CCI), use of psychotropic medication,\ndepression and anxiety, and Type D personality. These\nvariables were selected based on literature.25\u00ad28 To assess\nthe effects of Type D personality (high NA/high SI) on\nhealth status, three dummy variables were created: high\nNA/low SI, low NA/high SI, and low NA/low SI. Low\nNA/low SI served as the reference category. In the second-\nary analysis, (a) CCI and (b) psychotropic medication vari-\nable were replaced by heart failure (yes/no). If the\nquestionnaire was missing 20%, the missing data were\nimputed using the mean score of the patient on the availa-\nble completed items. For DS14, GAD-7, PHQ-2 and\nHealth Status, two, three, two and six patients needed\nimputation respectively. All statistical tests were two-\ntailed, and p<0.05 was used to indicate statistical signifi-\ncance. IBM SPSS Statistics version 23 was used for all\nstatistical analyses.\nResults\nSample characteristics\nA total of 195 patients were included in the current analy-\nsis (Figure 1).

However, after adjusting for psychologi-\ncal variables, they were no longer associated with health\nstatus. In the final multivariable model, comorbidities were\nassociated with impaired physical health status, while anxi-\nety and Type D personality were associated with impaired\nmental health status. The combination of high NA/low SI\nwas the only independent predictor of impairments in both\nmental and physical health status.\nCurrent finding with respect to prevalence rates are\ncomparable with a previous study reporting prevalence\nrates of up to 67% at baseline and 57% at the six-month\nfollow-up within the ICD population.12 Our findings\nextend current knowledge by providing prevalence rates\nover a prolonged period of 12 months post-ICD-implanta-\ntion. These findings indicate that sleep disturbance is not\nmerely caused by concerns associated with ICD implanta-\ntion itself or other short-term adjustment issues. Moreover,\nas they remain relatively stable over time, this might sug-\ngest that there is an underlying, stable construct that\naccounts for these prevalences (e.g. psychological or med-\nical profile). Hence, interventions that target sleep distur-\nbances in this population should perhaps target more stable\nconstructs that are associated with poor long-term\nadjustment.\nWith respect to predictors of sleep disturbances/lower\nsleep quality, others have shown that younger age, female\ngender, anxiety, depressive symptoms and underlying car-\ndiac disease predict lower sleep quality over time.1,12\u00ad14\nCurrent findings are mostly in contrast to previous findings\nwith the only similarity being that younger patients are\nidentified as having a higher risk of experiencing disturbed\nsleep. No evidence was found that gender, anxiety, depres-\nsion and underlying cardiac disease (heart failure) were\nassociated with disturbed sleep. This difference could be\nattributed to the fact that the previous studies focused more\non sleep quality as compared to sleep disturbances which\nwere the focus of the current study. In addition, previous\nstudies did not control for Type D personality or high NA/\nlow SI. The relationship between psychological distress\nand sleep disturbances/quality could possibly be explained\nby the presence of a more stable construct such as NA.\nA relationship between NA and impaired sleep has been\ndemonstrated several times in previous research.29\u00ad31 The\nTable 2.

A possible\nexplanation for the relation with sleep disturbance is that\nNA amplifies a person's reaction to, and perception of,\nstressful events. These individuals are likely to experience\nhigh levels of stress, tend to worry and often feel unhappy\nand irritated,23 which may result in impaired sleep quality/\nsleep disturbances. In addition, impaired sleep quality may\nincrease the patient's reaction to negative stimuli,32 result-\ning in more distress and thus leading to a vicious cycle.\nPrevious studies have shown that Type D personality is\nalso significantly associated with impaired sleep.29 In the\ncurrent study, Type D personality (the combination of high\nNA and high SI) was also associated with sleep distur-\nbance in univariate analyses, but not after adjusting for\ndemographic, clinical and psychological variables. In\naccordance with our findings, a previous study which\nfound an association between Type D personality and sleep\nproblems also showed that NA was more strongly related\nto sleep problems in adolescents, as compared to SI.29\nTo date, none of the studies have focused on the effects\nof sleep disturbance on health status at 12 months post-\nICD-implantation. Our findings showed that sleep distur-\nbance was associated with impaired health status, but that\nthis association was no longer significant after adjustment\nfor psychological variables. Here again, high NA/low SI\nwas the only predictor that was independently associated\nwith both impaired mental and physical health status.\nThese findings are in line with previous studies showing\nan association between NA and impaired health status.33 In\naddition, comorbidities, anxiety and Type D personality\nwere also associated with one of the components of health\nstatus, which is in line with previous findings.11,34\nA number of limitations must be acknowledged. First,\nthe WEBCARE trial was not designed to study sleep pat-\nterns in patients with an ICD and, hence, current findings\nshould be interpreted with caution as the sample might not\nbe representative for the general ICD population. Second,\nsleep disturbance was measured with one single item from\nthe PHQ-9. Nevertheless, PHQ-9 item #3 has been shown\nto be an effective screener for identifying sleep distur-\nbance and has been proven to significantly correlate with\nthe Insomnia Severity Index, a measure that adequately\nassesses diagnostic criteria for insomnia.20 Sleep distur-\nbance measured by PHQ-9 item #3 has also been associ-\nated with an increased occurrence of cardiovascular risk\nfactors and disease.2 However, using a one-item measure\nmight be associated with random measurement errors and\ninterpretation biases. In addition, reliability statistics can-\nnot be calculated with a one-item measure. Third, it was\nnot possible to diagnose and distinguish between different\nkinds of sleep disorders like insomnia, obstructive sleep\napnoea and hypersomnia in this study. Fourth, due to the\nrelatively small sample size and the risk of overfitting the\nregression models, it was not possible to adjust for all clin-\nical variables that might be of interest. Finally, only 37%\nof the eligible patients were included in current analysis.\nThis might have resulted in a bias in current findings.\nHence, the results may not be representative for the gen-\neral ICD population. However, this is the first study to\ndetermine the prevalence of sleep disturbance in patients\nwith an ICD during the course of 12 months post-implan-\ntation, the predictors and the impact of sleep disturbance\non health status at the 12-month follow-up. In addition, as\nadvocated by the American Heart Association this study\npresents the subjective, PROs which are considered as a\ngood measure of cardiovascular health.16\nFor clinical practice it would be recommended to iden-\ntify younger patients with high levels of NAand offer them\nsupport as needed to improve their sleep quality and poten-\ntially their health status. Also patients with a Type D per-\nsonality should be identified due to its impact on patients'\nhealth status. This could be done using the 14-item DS14\nquestionnaire23 which could be administered within min-\nutes. Patients could be identified at time of implantation\nand offered support as soon as possible in order to decrease\nlong-term adjustment problems. Future studies should\nfocus on examining the relationship between NA and dis-\nturbed sleep and also investigate whether the association\nbetween sleep disturbances and cardiovascular health is\nmediated by NA. In addition, larger studies with more\nobjective measures (e.g. daily monitoring with wearables)\nare needed to replicate current findings and inform the\nclinical practice.\nConclusions\nSleep disturbance is highly prevalent in patients with an ICD.\nCurrent findings show that particularly younger patients with\nhigh negative affectivity may experience disturbed sleep\npost-ICD implantation.
