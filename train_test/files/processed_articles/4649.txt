The practice of project man-\nagement has been proven in the traditional project-based\nindustries, such as aerospace and information technology\n(IT), and the demand is growing in the energy, health care,\nconstructions, and finance sectors (Hodgson & Cicmil, 2006;\nProject Management Institute [PMI], 2014, n.d.). It is pro-\nnew project management roles will be added globally across\nseven project intensive industries . . .

He further asked, \"How many of us could\nor would employ newly-graduated individuals in positions\nrelating to the design, development, and operation of project\nfollowed by Pinto and Kharbanda (1995) and others who\nwrote about the accidental profession. As an accidental pro-\nfession, the literature (Hauschildt, 2000; Sauer, Li, &\nJohnston, 2001) indicated that management selects project\nmanagers because they have potential as a project manager\nor a technical specialty. Rarely are project managers hired for\ntheir role. Furthermore, Darrell, Baccarini, and Love (2010)\ndiscussed what little preparation and training project manag-\ners get for their job, contributing to the notion of project\nmanagement as an accidental profession. Although research\nhas investigated the role of the accidental profession, there is\nstill work to be done. The accidental project manager is rel-\nevant today requiring more study and understanding in a\nvariety of industries and organizations (Darrell et al., 2010).\nTherefore, the current research study endeavors to find out\nwhere project managers come from and how they got into the\nrole. This is accomplished by interviewing 87 project man-\nagers about what types of career experiences led them to\nproject management.\nLiterature Review\nAs discussed by Pinto and Kharbanda (1995), project man-\nagers occupy a precarious situation in which they possess\nlittle authority and operate outside of the traditional hierar-\nchy.

Marion1\n Keywords\nproject manager career progression, project manager success factors, project manager career path framework\n2 SAGE Open\nacquires skills and knowledge to manage projects through a\ncombination of skills and experiences (Darrell et al., 2010).\nBut Darrell et al. (2010) commented that many project man-\nagers who fall outside of traditional project management\nindustries enter the profession by accident. In other words,\nthese project managers enter the profession without formal\ntraining. Often, project managers are picked because of tech-\nnical knowledge (Ranf, 2011), but they require other skills\nand knowledge as well.\nProject Manager Skills and Knowledge\nMany studies have been published about the characteristics,\nskills, and competencies of the serving project manager. In a\nstudy of IT project managers, necessary skills such as (a)\npersonal integrity, (b) team development, (c) client manage-\nment, (d) planning and control, and (e) problem solving\nwere found to be a requirement for success (Napier, Keil, &\nTan, 2007). That study also categorizes IT project manager\narchetypes, including (a) general manager, (b) problem\nsolver, (c) client representative, and (d) balanced manager.\nThe authors concluded by identifying several constructs\nrelated to the aforementioned skills category, including con-\nstructs such as (a) leadership, (b) team building, (c) com-\nmunication, (d) quality focus, and (e) managing complexity\namong others.\nThe requirements for IT project manager executives were\nstudied and reveal six critical core competencies necessary\nfor project managers, including (a) leadership, (b) communi-\ncation, (c) verbal and written skills, (d) attitude, (e) the abil-\nity to deal with ambiguity, and (f) change (Stevenson &\nStarkweather, 2009). These findings are consistent with\nNapier et al.'s (2007) study and point to a preference toward\nsoft skills of project managers.\nIn the ranking of the most critical skills for IT project\nmanagers, Keil, Lee, and Deng (2013) found a slightly dif-\nferent skill set with 19 critical skills necessary for project\nmanagers. Similar to the aforementioned studies, leader-\nship, communication, team building, and quality were\nimportant. Additional skills such as scope management and\nlistening were seen as critical skills as well (among others).\nInterestingly, in follow-up interviews, leadership, verbal\ncommunication, scope management, listening, and project\nplanning were seen as the top five skills for project\nmanagers.\nIn an article examining the role of project managers in\nhealth care, the authors concluded that a skilled project man-\nager would address the scope, risks, procurement, quality,\nand communication with the project (Hernandez, Aderton, &\nEidem, 2011). Project manager collaboration skills with all\nstakeholders was also found as important. More recently, in\na study across multiple sectors (health, technology, entertain-\nment, military, etc.), research showed that several competen-\ncies (and leadership styles) are needed depending upon the\nproject outcomes, and to be effective, a project manager\nmust be able to shift his or her style and competencies to\nmatch the project needs (Galvin, Gibbs, Sullivan, &Williams,\n2014). The authors further recommended that project manag-\ners needed to use critical thinking skills and adapt to the\never-changing environment.\nIn another study, results suggested that multiple-project\nmanagers possessed unique competencies, including (a)\norganizational experience, (b) interdependency manage-\nment, (c) multitasking, (d) simultaneous team management,\nand (e) management of interproject processes (Patanakul &\nMilosevic, 2007). This research acknowledged that multiple-\nproject managers need to have both individual technical\ncompetencies and competencies that can stimulate cross col-\nlaboration across multiple projects simultaneously. The top\ncritical competencies for multiple-project managers were\nmonitoring (administrative), problem solving (interper-\nsonal), business sense (business/strategic), and knowledge of\nproduct applications (technical). Holzle (2010) outlined sev-\neral components to the project manager's competency pro-\nfile, including (a) methods and expertise, (b) problem-solving\nskills, (c) cooperation and team skills, (d) communication\nskills, and (d) intercultural competence.\nExpertise and knowledge transfer are critical to the suc-\ncess of practicing project management and the organizations\nwithin which project managers work (Demartini & Paoloni,\nedge is a combination of experiences, values, insights, and\ninformation. They went on to say that the context is impor-\ntant in identification and transfer of knowledge in organiza-\ntions. Brown, Adams, and Amjad (2007) discussed that\nproject managers' knowledge and experience are important\ndeterminates in project outcomes. They further explained\nthat a combination of knowledge and experience would\nimprove project manager performance. Furthermore, Yasin\n(2000) found that the use of communication exceeded proj-\nect manager's knowledge, indicating that communication\nneeds to be an area of emphasis. Finally, Krane, Olsson, and\nRolstadas (2012) found that owners of a project need to rely\non and trust the project manager and his or her knowledge\nbecause, often, the project manager has more knowledge of\nthe particular project.\nOrganizational Support for the Project Manager\nOrganizational support is critical, as often, project manag-\ners have found much success in a technical field but are not\nfully aware of the management skills that are necessary for\nproject success (Darrell et al., 2010; Pinto & Kharbanda,\nassigned project manager roles because of their technical\nknowledge but that emphasis has shifted, as project manag-\ners must have knowledge of business operations as well.\nOften, project managers are thrown into an organization\nwithout the support from an organization (Darrell et al.,\n2010). This lack of human resource planning makes it\nRichardson et al. 3\ndifficult to prepare our future project managers for the\nimportant skills, knowledge, and competencies that are\ncritical for their success.\nProject manager support may be tied to project success,\nand it is important to prevent project managers from per-\nfound the importance of a project manager to be aligned to\nappropriate career path levels. Holzle further contended that\nan organization needs to engage and provide continuity for\nproject managers like they would any other career field in\ntheir organization. Furthermore, projects need to be classi-\nfied, and that needs to be factored into the project manager's\ncareer path as well. The project manager must receive sup-\nport from the organization and have a definition of roles.\nWithout an organizational support structure that defines the\nproject manager's roles and responsibilities, projects would\nlack functional manager support (Anantatmula, 2010). The\norganization needs to support the project manager, so that\nevery member of the chain of command will support the\nproject manager as well. Anantatmula (2010) observed that\nthe project manager has a role in supporting functional man-\nagers, but they need management support as well for project\nsuccess.\nProject success was more likely when related to a clearly\ndefined mission, a cohesive team and management support\nthat as one helps project managers and provides them with\nthe requisite organizational support, this can be accom-\nplished through a wide range of supportive mechanisms\nthat organizations can implement. The organization can\ntake other steps to assist project managers. Some of these\nsteps are through a strong organizational culture and\nleadership(Darrell et al., 2010). A mature project manage-\nment program is also important. Organizations need to\nengage in strategic staffing, have a strong training program,\nand have team autonomy on projects to improve team effec-\ntiveness and decision making (Drouin & Bourgault, 2013).\nDespite these recommendations, Drouin and Bourgault\nurge for more empirical studies of organizational support,\nas the subject has not received much attention in the litera-\nture. It is with this theoretical framework that the current\nstudy was undertaken.\nMethod\nThe methodological approach chosen for the present study is\nqualitative with the main objectives being to investigate\nproject managers and to understand the phenomena about\nwhere project managers came from and how they arrived at\nthe role. This was accomplished by interviewing project\nmanagers about what types of career experiences led them to\nproject management and then analyzing the participants'sto-\nries. Through this process, the researcher may take an active\nrole and \"restory\" the stories into a framework that makes\nsense (Creswell, 2013). Students in a graduate project man-\nagement degree program were assigned to interview a pro-\nfessional project manager and pose questions about\nassociated career experiences and career progression. A total\nof 87 project managers, from a variety of U.S.-based and\ninternational organizations, were interviewed. The students\nposted the interview summaries into an online learning man-\nagement system for evaluation and comment following a\ntopical protocol delineated in Table 1.\nThe interviews yielded nearly 130 pages of interview\nsummary data from project managers discussing career\nexperiences. Keeping with qualitative tradition, after con-\nducting the interviews and cleansing the data, the authors\nread all the interviews and took note of the emerging themes\nrelated to the following research question:\nResearch Question 1: Where do project manager come\nfrom and how did they get there?\nOnce all of the interviews were read in this first review of\nthe data, the next step was data entry into the qualitative\nsoftware.\nQualitative coding software, nVivo, is a software that aids\nwith the organization and analysis of unstructured data. The\nillustration below depicts the coding process (QSR\nInternational, 2014, p. 6). Each interview was imported inde-\npendently, and the list of emergent themes is loaded as cate-\ngories, or nodes, reflected as \"Import\" and \"Explore\" below.\nThe \"Code\" process involves reviewing of each individual\ninterview and then linking the individual comments from the\ninterview to themes. This begins a cataloging process of the\ndata.\nFurther analysis was conducted through keyword queries\nto ensure that all instances of specific keyword or phrase\nwere reviewed and coded, \"Query.\" Any item that was ini-\ntially missed was included and the coding was complete.\nThen, themes were collected and the frequency that each\ntheme appeared was documented. A word frequency analysis\nwas performed against each segment of coded text to gain an\nunderstanding of how closely each identified theme was\nrelated to others in terms of common words and expressions,\nallowing the authors to \"Reflect\" as to the implication.\nRelationships were established, and then themes were classi-\nfied into groups. Finally, the conceptual framework was built\nup from the themes, classifications, and relationship. This\n\"Visualize\" step allows this study's 87 interview results to be\na representation of career trajectory.\nTable 1. Topical Protocol.\nQuestion\nHow did he or she get started in the field?\nHow has his or her career progressed?\n4 SAGE Open\nLimitations\nAlthough this study offers a view of project managers as an\naccidental profession, the present study is not without limita-\ntions. One limitation to qualitative research is high internal\nvalidity and low external validity. The researchers attempted\nto mitigate this limitation through a high sample size (n =\n87). Furthermore, despite that the interviews were collected\nfrom graduate students in multiple different sections of a\nproject management fundamentals course with different pro-\nfessors, the results were consistent regardless of professor or\ninterviewer. The study had low external validity due to the\nlack of interviewer training and the lack of contact between\nthe authors and the interviewees. Another limitation is the\nlack of demographic information collected. This presents a\nproblem with generalizing the data with regard to his or her\nindustry, years of experience, and if he or she was a certified\nproject management professional. Despite the limitations,\nseveral conclusions applicable to the project manager were\nobtained and discussed above.\nAnalysis\nIn this analysis, two themes observed from \"Project Manager\nInsights: An Analysis of Career Progression\" (Marion,\nRichardson, & Earnhardt, 2014) were further analyzed to\nbetter understand the following:\n1. the career trajectory of project managers, and\n2. interview summary comments associated with the\nongoing observation that project management career\npaths are likely to be unintentional or evolutionary in\nnature.\nThe codes selected for further analysis are illustrated in\nThese two underlying themes appeared in 78 of the total\n87 interview summaries, and 50 instances of each theme\nwere coded. Leveraging nVivo's sorting feature, the two\nmajor themes were examined a second time, and a set of sub-\nthemes emerged. The sub-themes are illustrated in Table 3.\nThe sub-themes illustrate a repeatedly occurring pattern\nobserved throughout the analyzed interview summaries. This\npattern reveals an evolutionary career trajectory in project\nmanagement that is often unintended by the individual, and\nis realized as the employee builds on career disciplines over\ntime. The interview summaries often describe an increasing\nindividual influence in the organization as skills mature,\nmore frequent cross-functional interactions occur, and coor-\ndination increases. Brief descriptions of each sub-theme,\nalong with significant interview summary excerpts, provide\nsupport for this understanding of the \"typical\" project man-\nagement career trajectory.\nMaturing Skills and Interaction (47 Sources [54%\nor Respondents] / 54 References)\nThe project manager's evolution appears to mirror senior\nfunctional manager or general manager career paths. The\nproject manager, as reflected in the interview summary\nexcerpts, begins with a focus on a specific technical disci-\npline, but over time encounters opportunities to develop\nmanagement skills and to interact with other disciplines in\nthe organization:\nThe way that I got started in this field was through my\nexperiences in other positions I have had. I have been a scheduler,\na customer service agent and lead, a shipping specialist, a supply\nspecialist and lead . . . an inventory manager, a master scheduler,\na project manager, a portfolio manager, and now a program\nmanager.\nThere is no set career path for becoming a project manager,\nadvancement generally occurs incrementally, and project\nmanagement responsibilities expand as you move up the\norganization's hierarchy.\nIn each of these interview summaries, it is clear that there\nis no single-project management career path. Rather, the\nproject management role seems to emerge from employee\nexperiences in different roles within the company over a\nperiod of years. The more knowledge and experience gained,\nthe more likely it appears that the employee will be assigned\nan integrative role such as project management that touches\nall functional groups.\nEvolution (39 Sources [45% or Respondents] /\nAs is observed from the interview summary excerpts,\nindividuals are not likely to be assigned project\nTable 2.

Typical\nof the process of evolution, the arrival at the end result was\nnot planned but created by trial and error and circumstance.\nFocus on Technical Discipline (25 Sources [29%\nor Respondents] / 26 References)\nIn many observed interview summary excerpts, the project\nmanagers of today were the technical specialists of\nyesterday.\nHe got started in his current field when he was working\noperations as an engineer\nWhen I received my undergraduate degree . . . I started doing\nsoftware development.\nHe got started in the field working for the same company in\ndevelopment and testing parts for commercial aircraft ventilation\nsystems.\nAs can be seen in this theme, many project managers\nbegin their respective careers as technical specialists. Those\nwith soft skills in addition to technical skills are observed to\neventually gravitate toward management positions. Given\nthat many technical disciplines tend to produce unique deliv-\nerables, project management positions may well be natural\nmanagement destinations for such science, technology, engi-\nneering, and math professionals.\nWide Interaction and Responsibility (19 Sources\nIn some observed instances, the evolutionary process contin-\nues beyond the level of project manager and results in the\nattainment of significant additional responsibility. This sug-\ngests that the evolutionary process observed in the interview\nsummaries applies equally well to program managers and\nproject executives.\nWith many people who seek promotions he did the jobs required\nto climb the corporate ladder and now finds him in charge of the\nentire process.\nMy career has progressed steadily from being put in charge of\nsmall products, such as relocating a specific area of an aircraft\nengine production facility to a new location, to acting as the\nsingle point of contact for the annual fundraising efforts of a\nThis theme illustrates that career experience associated\nwith an increasing scope and span of control may provide a\ncareer trajectory toward project leadership opportunities. An\nincreased span of control is inherently cross-functional in\nnature and is therefore consistent with the organizational\nstructure of projects.\nPreparation Meets Opportunity (15 Sources\nSome project managers interviewed experienced a more\nrapid progression by seeking out opportunities either through\nvolunteering or taking the opportunity to demonstrate leader-\nship capability:\nThrough the honing of skills by experience and volunteering for\njob task opportunities, does recognition by hiring managers\narrive.\nOnce I was working for that company as a SME (subject matter\nexpert) I got pushed to a project lead within two months due to\nmy military background and leadership ability.\nAs evidenced by interview excerpts associated with this\ntheme, employees who find themselves prepared by a lengthy\ncareer experience may one day encounter an opportunity to\nmove into the realm of the project manager. This positive result\ncould be said to be a combination of both the natural experi-\nence developed as a career evolves, and the chance encounter\nwith an opportunity to take on a more extensive role.\nDiscovery (13 Sources [15% or Respondents] /\nSome successful project managers stated that they were\nunaware of project management as a profession until later in\nhis or her career: \" . . . It was then, that she discovered exactly\nwhat this new management style was a career field called\nproject management.\" \"I didn't think of project management\nat the time but now I know it was a project.\"\nIt is of interest to observe that some of today's project\nmanagers revealed a tendency to be unaware of the project\nmanagement profession prior to taking on the role. This is\nbecause project management lacks professional status and\nthe lack of focus on a specific career goal is consistent with\n6 SAGE Open\nthe evolutionary nature of the project management career\npath observed in the study.\nMistake (Five Sources [6% or Respondents] / Five\nReferences)\nThe fact that the project management profession can be a\ncareer path that emerges, rather than one that is specifically\nchosen by the employee, is highlighted by these revealing\ncomments. Some project managers who were interviewed\ncharacterized the career as an \"accident\" or a \"mistake\": \"In\nthe mid 90's, Donna said she sorta [sic] fell into her career by\naccident; really out of necessity.\" \". . . Well thank you for\nasking. I got started in Project Management by mistake . . .\"\nThe \"accidental profession\" phenomenon observed in the\ninterviews appears to be an artifact of the willingness of\nsome individuals to take on more responsibility and leader-\nship. Those who do and become effective in the role are\nobserved to eventually become project managers.\nConceptual Framework\nAn inductive approach to developing theory begins with the\ndata (interviews), seeks patterns in the data (themes), and\nthen seeks to build up a larger picture of the phenomena\nunder study (conceptual framework; Creswell, 2013). When\nthe themes are put in logical order based on career progres-\nsion, we arrive at the following conceptual framework:\nFigure 1 represents a typical career trajectory as repre-\nsented by this study's 87 interviewees. On the left side of the\ndiagram, \"organizational roles\" are depicted in bold. They\nbegin at the bottom, suggesting the beginning of a career, as\na discipline specialist. The interview results suggest that as\nthe discipline specialist becomes proficient, volunteers for\nadditional responsibility, and demonstrates potential, he or\nshe evolves into the role of supervisor or junior project man-\nager. It is at this point in one's career that our interview sub-\njects describe entry into project management roles by\naccident, through discovering a better understanding of how\nthe organization accomplishes work cross functionally. The\nprogression to a project manager role, and later a senior proj-\nect manager or program manager, is an evolutionary process.\nAs individuals are proven communicators and collaborators,\nthese individuals describe successful project management\nexperiences.\nOn the right side of the diagram, this continuum illustrates\nindividual awareness of project management as a practice\nand later as a profession. Participants in this study describe\n\"doing\" project management and becoming aware of project\nmanagement certification. Seeking the project management\nprofessional certification often became a byproduct of the\nindividual's career path evolving into project management\nroles and the certification provided external professional\ncredibility.\nThe center portion of the diagram represents the individu-\nals' personal growth and development over time, building a\nFigure 1. Project manager career path conceptual framework.\nRichardson et al. 7\ncareer. Starting at the bottom, an entry into the job market\nexpects a focus on a discipline. An individual is expected to\nbecome proficient at \"the job,\" which could require little to\nno interaction with the other parts of the organization. As\ntime passes and proficiency increases, the individual skill set\nmatures. He or she better understands the nature of how work\nis accomplished and the requirement for communications\nand collaboration. Moving up the professional development\nline, an individual has proven himself or herself as a techni-\ncal specialist, is successful in interorganization coordination,\nand may be serving in a managerial capacity. The top of the\nprofessional development timeline reflects full immersion in\nthe organization and is recognized as a subject matter expert\nwho has a broad understanding of the organization's enter-\nprise wide operations and has developed a strong leadership\nskill set.\nFigure 2 presents the project manager career path con-\nceptual framework in the organizational context. Under the\nheading \"Functional Organization,\" the columns represent\nthe different functional areas, such as operations, production,\nmarketing, and human resources. As described above, the\nproject manager career path conceptual framework has three\ndistinct concepts represented: (a) organizational roles, (b)\npersonal development, and (c) project management aware-\nness. Here, we see those three concepts embedded in the con-\ntext of a functional organization. In the center, the personal\ndevelopment process illustrates a career progression from\nthe bottom to the top, just as described above. To the right is\nthe project management awareness spectrum which at the\nbottom is colored red, indicating minimal or non-existent\nproject management awareness. The color code changes\nfrom orange to yellow as an individual becomes more aware\nof project management practices and then transitions to\ngreen, suggesting that an individual is fully immersed as a\nproject manager or a possible program manager. Up at the\ntop of Figure 2, \"organizational roles\" are identified.\nThe left hand of the diagram represents a typical func-\ntional organization. The column furthest to the right is where\nthe project manager resides. It is evident from this that as the\nindividual's skill set increases, and the communication and\ncollaboration across functional areas, he or she becomes\nmore aware of project management practices, our interview\nparticipants describe that intersection is where project man-\nagers succeed. As the communication and collaboration span\nthe entire organization, this may be a fully qualified project\nmanager who may be certified. A fully immersed project\nmanager, who may be certified, is mature in his or her techni-\ncal discipline, very aware of the project management\nprinciples.\nDiscussion\nThe themes that emerge from the interview summaries illus-\ntrate a career path that does not typically begin with the goal\nof becoming a project manager, but rather evolves over time\nas experience builds. The pattern is validated by selected\nFigure 2. Project manager career path conceptual framework in the organizational context.\n8 SAGE Open\nexcerpts from the interview summaries, and the number of\ninstances that each theme is observed. For example, nearly\n70% of all instances of coded themes occur in the top three\nnoted themes of \"maturing skills and interaction,\" \"evolu-\ntion,\" and \"focus on technical discipline.\"\nThis study suggests that what J. Gordon Davis asked in\n1971 may still need addressing the following: Are we still\ndepending on accidental education of our project managers?\nWhat is the role of PMI? What is the role of the organization?\n(Davis, 1971). Higher education seems to be providing\nample opportunities. There are more than 900 project man-\nagement degrees being offered by more than 450 colleges\nand institutions globally (Higham, 2014). The degrees are at\nthe bachelor, master, and doctoral levels residing in a variety\nof university disciplines: engineering, business, health care,\nand interdisciplinary studies to name a few. There is a sig-\nnificant growth compared with 1994 when there were only\n11 formal project management degrees, and most were in the\nWhen considering the role of the project management\nprofessional organizations, J. Rodney Turner (1999)\ndescribed the support that should be expected:\n1. Define the knowledge upon which the profession is based\n2. Contribute to the further development of that knowledge\n3. Define the minimum knowledge and competence in its use\nrequired to be a member of the profession\n4. Aid in the continuing professional development of members\nof the profession\n5. Welcome potential new entrants to the profession, and aid in\nthe development in the profession\n6. Assess individuals to determine whether they have achieved\nthe required minimum levels of knowledge and competence to\nbe professionals\n7. Certify individuals so that the public at large can be assured of\ntheir competence to practice as professional (p. 41).\nAs evidenced by the growth in membership of the PMI, the\nInternationalProjectManagementAssociation,theAssociation\nof Project Management, and others; the professional develop-\nment; and the multiple certifications offered by each, it appears\nthat the professional institutions are striving to solidify the\nprofession. In 2006, Morris, Crawford, Hodgson, Shepherd,\nand Thomas (2006) likened the project management profes-\nsion to occupations described as \"semi-professions,\" \"com-\nmercialized professions,\" and \"emerging professions.\" The\narticle further describes the importance of the Body of\nKnowledge in formalizing the profession. But, they caution,\n\"If we rely on the project management associations to tell the\nacademics what to think and teach, instead of having research\ntest the concepts theoretically and the issues practically, we get\nAnother interesting finding is that project managers inter-\nviewed began their project management careers with a strong\ntechnical background as a discipline specialist. The partici-\npants commented as they progressed in their careers; they\ndeveloped management skill sets. This finds congruence\nwith the literature review that found project managers need\nstrong soft skills (such as communication and critical think-\ning) in addition to technical skills. Specifically, the partici-\npants noted that the need for communication, collaboration,\nand leadership has necessary skills for the project manager.\nThese data continue to inform the growing literature on proj-\nect manager competencies.\nThis study analyzed 87 interviews of practicing project\nmanagers and the answers to questions about entry into the\nfield and career progression. What this study found is that\ndespite the efforts of higher education to provide a formal\npath to the profession, despite the very popular professional\nassociations and their professional development and certifi-\ncations, that project management still is a destination by\naccident.\nFuture Research\nFirst, the current study offers a conceptual framework for\nproject manager career paths. Although the study confirms\nearlier work (Davis, 1971), there is a need for additional\nstudies, particularly related to the proposed framework\n(Darrell et al., 2010). The proposed framework infers that the\ncareer path for project managers remains an informal process\nin many companies. The data indicate that project managers\narrive at their role through experience. Future studies can\nconfirm the proposed framework and further test the findings\nproposed in the current research study. In addition, future\nstudies could modify or add to the conceptual framework\noutlined in this study. Another research avenue for future\nstudies could include demographic data and interview proj-\nect managers in different countries and cultures to see\nwhether the results are consistent globally. Is project man-\nagement an accidental profession globally? This would be an\ninteresting question to answer. The question of project man-\nager career progression could be investigated on a global\nscale with multiple cultures and specific industries. Finally,\nfuture studies could investigate the role of leadership style in\nproject manager success. For example, does a servant leader\nhave more project success than a transactional leader? Does\na project manager's leadership style even matter in project\nexecution? This could be an interesting research avenue for\nfuture project management research.\nConclusion\nThe present study builds on Davis's (1971) challenge to the\nprofession and subsequent research describing the accidental\nRichardson et al. 9\nprofession, investigating the career progression of project\nmanagers. The research contributes to the topic of career pro-\ngression by offering a conceptual framework providing\ninsight into project managers' career progression. The study\nfound that despite the efforts of higher education to provide\na formal path to the profession, regardless of the very popu-\nlar professional associations and their professional develop-\nment and certifications, project management remains a\ndestination by accident and that professional project manag-\ners do not intend to be project managers but \"fall into\" the\nprofession. This has implications for project management\ntraining and mentoring in the future and contributes to the\ngrowing literature on the accidental profession.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAnantatmula, V.
