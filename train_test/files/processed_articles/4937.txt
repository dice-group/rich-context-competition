    "abstract": "Abstract\nAltruism plays a role in mate choice, particularly in women's preferences and in long-term (LT) relationships. The current study\nanalyzed how these preferences interacted with another important mate choice variable, physical attractiveness. Here, female\nparticipants were presented with photographs of men of varying levels of physical attractiveness, alongside descriptions of them\nbehaving either altruistically or not in different scenarios. The results showed women preferred altruistic men, particularly in LT\nrelationships and that this interacted with physical attractiveness such that being both attractive and altruistic made a man more\ndesirable than just the sum of the two desirable parts. Also, being altruistic made low attractive men more desirable but only for\nLT relationships. Finally, men who were just altruistic were rated more desirable than men who were just attractive, especially for\nLT relationships. Overall, these findings are discussed in terms of the role of altruism in mate choice, particularly in LT rela-\ntionships and directions of future research.\n",

For example, a number of studies\nhave shown that individuals behave more altruistically with or\nin the presence of potential mates (Farrelly, Lazarus, &\nBerticat, Raymond, & Faurie, 2012; Van Vugt & Iredale,\n2013). Similarly, other research has provided evidence that\nindividuals, in particular women, show a preference for part-\nMoore et al., 2013; Oda, Shibata, Kiyonari, Takeda, &\nMatsumoto-Oda, 2013; Phillips, Barnard, Ferguson, & Reader,\nFurthermore, previous research has sought to identify what\nqualities altruism may be signaling that makes it desirable in a\npotential mate. Both Farrelly (2011) and Oda, Okuda, Takeda,\nand Hiraishi (2014) explored whether altruism can better signal\nthe genetic quality of the altruist, due to the ``good genes'' that\nare perhaps necessary for them to afford the costs of altruistic\nbehavior (e.g. Miller, 2000) or good phenotypic quality, as the\nnature of such behaviors may indicate that the altruist will be a\nwas achieved by examining how women's preferences for\naltruistic men varied across the menstrual cycle, where signals\nof good genetic quality are expected to be more desirable dur-\ning the high fertile stage of the cycle, particularly for short-term\n(ST) mating (e.g. Gangestad & Haselton, 2015; Gangestad &\nthat not only were there no effects of menstrual cycle stage on\nwomen's preferences for altruistic traits in men but also that\nthere were increased preferences for men in long-term (LT)\n1 Institute of Health and Society, University of Worcester, Worcester, United\nKingdom\n2 Department of Psychology, University of Sunderland, Sunderland, United\nKingdom\nCorresponding Author:\nDaniel Farrelly, Institute of Health and Society, University of Worcester,\nWorcester, United Kingdom.\nEmail: d.farrelly@worc.ac.uk\nEvolutionary Psychology\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav\nevp.sagepub.com\nCreative Commons CC-BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 License\n(http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits non-commercial use, reproduction and distribution of the work without further\npermission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access page (https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\nrelationships who displayed in altruism in different contexts\n(Farrelly, 2011) and toward different recipients (Oda, Okuda,\nTakeda, & Hiraishi, 2014). Therefore, both studies conclude\nthat altruism functions in mate choice as a signal of phenotypic\nqualities, rather than predominantly a signal of genetic quality.\nFurther support for this is the consistent finding in research\nof altruism being more desirable in LT partners (Barclay, 2010;\nmore likely to enter LT relationships (Stavrova & Ehlebracht,\n2015) and assortative mating for altruistic characteristics\namong married couples in Senegal (Tognetti et al., 2012).\nHowever, caution needs to be exercised when examining\nwhether a specific trait is a signal of either genetic or pheno-\ntypic qualities based on relationship length alone. This is\nbecause this may not be a clear indication of what is being\nsignaled, as not all preferences in either ST or LT partners are\nfor traits that signal genetic or phenotypic quality, respectively\n(Buss & Shackelford, 2008). Similarly, any variation for a\ncomplex psychological trait such as altruism will be the prod-\nuct of both genetic and phenotypic/environmental causes.\nOverall, though, such findings highlight at least in what context\nwomen find altruistic men more desirable (which is LT rela-\ntionships) and as a result contributes to our understanding of\naltruism's role in human mate choice.\nThis role can be further understood by examining what hap-\npens to the desirability of men when signals of altruistic beha-\nvior vary concurrently with other desired traits in mate choice.\nKnowledge of this would help us to further understand the\ntrade-offs and signals associated with sexually selected altru-\nism. This study aimed to answer this, by building on the above\nfindings with an examination of how women's preferences for\naltruistic men in both ST and LT relationships were affected by\nthe latter's physical attractiveness. There exists a great deal of\nevidence that physical attractiveness can act as a reliable signal\nof genetic quality (e.g., Rhodes, 2006) and also that women\nhave greater preferences for physically attractive men in ST\nrelationships (Buunk, Dijkstra, Fetchenhauer, & Kenrick,\nhigh fertile stage of the menstrual cycle (Gangestad, Garver-\nApgar, Simpson, & Cousins, 2007; Gangestad, Thornhill, &\nGarver-Apgar, 2010). Therefore, the current study will further\nour understanding of how physical attractiveness interacts in\nwomen's mate preferences with altruism, which recent evi-\nof good partner/parenting qualities. As such, it will follow from\nprevious research, which has shown that in forced choice sce-\nnarios females prefer mates who display ``warmth/trustworthi-\nness'' (which will have parallels to altruistic behavior) than\nthose who are physically attractive, particularly for longer,\ncommitted relationships (Fletcher, Tither, O'Loughlin, Friesen,\nOverall, the current study examined how the physical attrac-\ntiveness and the level of altruism of men affected their desir-\nability to women for both ST and LT relationships. It also\nbuilds on the previous research of Barclay (2010) and Farrelly\n(2011) by using short individual profiles presented to\nparticipants and asking them to rate the desirability of each but\nwith the addition of photographs of these individuals portray-\ning them as either high or low in attractiveness. Based on these\nprevious findings and theory outlined earlier, it was predicted\nthat altruists will be rated more desirable than nonaltruists\n(Hypothesis 1) and that this preference will be greater for LT\nthan ST relationships (Hypothesis 2). Furthermore, as the intro-\nduction of physical attractiveness as an additional variable in\nthis study was novel, there is the exploratory hypothesis that\nthis may further affect the findings relating to these first two\nhypotheses. Finally, based on the previous findings of Fletcher,\nTither, O'Loughlin, Friesen, and Overall (2004), it was pre-\ndicted that women will show preferences for altruism over\nphysical attractiveness (Hypothesis 3) and that this preference\nwill be greater for LT relationships (Hypothesis 4).\nMaterial and Method\nParticipants\ntook part in the experiment. Participants completed the study\nonline using www.surveymonkey.com and were recruited via\nopportunistic sampling or received course credit for complet-\ning the study. This research was approved by the university\nethics committee.\nMaterials\nA series of male facial 2-D photographs were sourced from two\ndifferent databases, pics.stir.ac.uk and the Radboud Faces\nDatabase (Langner et al., 2010), and were then independently\nassessed by three judges (the three authors) who selected the 12\nhighest and 12 lowest physically attractive men to be included\nin the study. Further validation of these selections were from\nthe overall attractiveness ratings in the main study, whereby the\nhigh attractive men were rated overall as more attractive than\nPairs of photographs were presented alongside rubrics of\nparticular scenarios, with the person in each photo given a\nneutral label (e.g., ``Person A''). These scenarios described\nconditions where individuals could behave altruistically and\nare based on similar scenarios used elsewhere (Farthing,\nhow the two men behaved in response to this scenario, which\nwas either high in altruism or low in altruism. Apart from these,\nparticipants also viewed pairs of photographs alongside neutral\nscenarios, with both individuals described as behaving neither\naltruistically nor nonaltruistically (e.g. ``Person O and Person P\nboth go out clothes shopping, Person O decides to buy a green\njumper and Person P buys a pair of jeans''). Examples of the\ndifferent scenarios are provided in Table 1.\nDirectly underneath this were two questions that related to\neach of the individuals. These asked how attractive the person\nwas for two types of relationship, LT or ST. Definitions of\nthese two relationship types (ST: a person with whom you\n2 Evolutionary Psychology\nwould desire a brief affair or a one night stand. LT: a person\nwith whom you desire a committed LT romantic relationship)\nwere provided based on previous research (Farrelly, 2011).\nBoth questions required a response on a 5-point Likert-type\nscale from very unattractive to very attractive. All research\nmaterials relevant to this article can be accessed by contacting\nthe corresponding author.\nProcedure\nParticipants first read an information sheet that described the\nstudy as investigating female perceptions of attractiveness in\ndifferent scenarios and then provide informed consent. After\ngiving details of their age, participants were told that they\nwould be required to rate how attractive they found a number\nof different individuals for both ST and LT relationship and\nwere provided with the descriptions of both relationship\ntypes. Participants then went on to view the different men\nwith the accompanying scenarios and behaviors as outlined\nearlier.\nIn total, there were 12 scenarios that participants viewed, 8\nof which were altruism conditions and 4 of which were neutral.\nThe order in which participants saw these was randomly deter-\nmined, and there were two orders that participants were ran-\ndomly allocated to at the start of the study. As mentioned\nearlier, each scenario was presented with photographs of two\nindividuals with details of their behavior in relation to the\nscenario. In each scenario, participants saw a high attractive\nand a low attractive individual paired together. Across these\neight pairings in the ``altruism'' conditions, high attractive indi-\nviduals were presented 4 times as being low in altruism and\nalso 4 times as being high in altruism (the same was also true\nfor the low attractive individuals).\nAfter viewing all 12 scenarios and completing the attrac-\ntiveness ratings for each individual, participants were fully\ndebriefed as to the true aims of the study and thanked for their\nparticipation.\nResults\nTo test the hypotheses presented in the introduction, a repeated\nmeasures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted, with\nattractiveness of target individual (high vs. low), level of altru-\nism (high vs. low), and relationship length (ST vs. LT) as\nwithin-subjects variables. Subsequently are presented the main\nresults and interactions that are relevant to the hypotheses,\nincluding, where necessary, pairwise comparisons (paired\nt-tests).\nHypothesis 1: Altruistic men will be more desirable than\nnonaltruistic men.\nIndividuals who displayed high levels of altruism were rated\nsignificantly more desirable overall than those displaying low\nIn terms of whether there was a further influence of the\nphysical attractiveness on the desirability of altruism, a signif-\nicant interaction was found between target attractiveness and\nFigure 1. To further understand the nature of this interaction,\nthe proportional change in the desirability ratings from low\nattractive to high attractive men was calculated for both low\nand high altruism levels. A paired t-test then revealed that\nthe proportional increase in ratings from low to high attrac-\ntive men was greater when they also displayed high altruism\nFigure 1.

As a result, it was\nfound that the desirability of low attractive men who displayed\nhigh altruism was higher than that of high attractive men who\nHypothesis 4: Women will show a greater preference for\naltruistic men over physically attractive men for LT than ST\nrelationships.\nTo test this hypothesis, a similar analysis to that of Hypoth-\nesis 3 was conducted with relationship length (ST vs. LT)\nincluded as a further within-subjects measure alongside trait\ndisplayed (high altruism vs. high attractiveness) in a repeated\nmeasures ANOVA. This revealed a significant interaction, F(1,\npairwise comparisons revealed that women's ratings for men\ndisplaying altruism but not attractiveness were significantly\nhigher than for men displaying attractiveness but not altruism\nDiscussion\nAs predicted, women found men who behaved altruistically\nmore desirable than those who did not. This therefore supports\nHypothesis 1 and adds to the body of empirical evidence that\nshows altruism has an important role in human mate choice.\nFurthermore, women found altruistic men more desirable for\nLT relationships, which supports Hypothesis 2 and is in line\nysis, it was also found that nonaltruistic men were more desir-\nable for ST relationships, which suggests that rather than\naltruism not being important in ST relationships (as previous\nFigure 2. Graph of proportional change in desirability from short-\nterm to long-term (+standard error [SE]) of men by level of attrac-\ntiveness and level of altruism. Figure 3. Graph of desirability ratings (+standard error [SE]) of men\ndisplaying either high altruism or high attractiveness only by different\nrelationship lengths.\n4 Evolutionary Psychology\nresearch suggests), in the present study, it is actually undesir-\nable. This is a surprising finding, as little is known or\nresearched about what being un-altruistic means in terms of\nmate choice, and is worthy of further investigation. As such,\nit may be related to female mate choice for other, less socially\ndesirable traits that may have a role in male ST mating strate-\ngies such as the Dark Triad (e.g., Jonason, Li, Webster, &\nThe preference for altruistic men was also further influenced\nby their physical attractiveness, such that the increase in desir-\nability of men as attractiveness increased was significantly\ngreater when they were also altruistic. This suggests that altru-\nism can have an additive effect to other mate choice qualities\n(in this case, physical attractiveness), such that possessing both\nqualities has a greater effect on a man's desirability than just a\ncombination of their individual desirability. Also, the higher\npreference for LT over ST relationships with men low in attrac-\ntiveness when they were altruistic suggests that being altruistic\nmay act as a reliable mating strategy for acquiring LT partners\nfor such men. Further investigation, such as examining how\nmen of different attractiveness levels use altruistic acts as LT\ncourtship displays, would explore this possibility in more\ndepth.\nFurthermore, the finding that high altruistic/low attractive\nmen were rated more desirable than low altruistic/high attrac-\ntive men offers support for Hypothesis 3, and further analysis\nthat revealed that this was only significant for LT relationships\noffers support for Hypothesis 4. This suggests that if a man\npossesses only one of these traits, it is altruism that is more\nvaluable, particularly for LT relationships. This, together with\nthe above findings, provides further evidence of the importance\nof altruism in women's mate choice preferences, even when it\nis presented with other notable mate choice traits (such as\nphysical attractiveness). Furthermore, by showing that this\neffect is even greater for LT relationships, more evidence is\nprovided for altruism being a highly important characteristic\ntrait women look for in LT partners.\nTo properly interpret these findings, it is also important to\nconsider some limitations in the methods used. Firstly, both\nmen in some scenarios (i.e., the one who behaved altruistically\nand the one that did not) were presented together, such as in the\nfirst example in Table 1 (rescuing a child from a river). As a\nresult, this may mean that the nonaltruist in these scenarios may\nsignal other traits as well such as lack of awareness (empathy)\nor apathy. Although such traits will most likely relate to or be\npart of a low altruistic nature in such individuals, future\nresearch could examine profiles presented alone to avoid any\npossible confounding effect of comparing the altruism levels of\ntwo men simultaneously. Another consideration is that by using\na range of different scenarios in this study, possible character-\nistics may have been signaled other than just altruism. For\nexample, the moral consequences of behaving altruistically in\nsome scenarios were higher than others, for example, compar-\ning attempting to save a child from drowning with buying food\nfor a homeless person. Another example is that altruistic beha-\nvior in these two scenarios will also vary in the degree to which\nphysical strength/prowess is also signaled, which will be higher\nwhen jumping into a river to save a child than when buying a\nsandwich. Overall, though, all scenarios used in this study can\nbe considered to act as reliable signals of altruism, even if\nindividual scenarios may be able to signal other traits as well.\nThis therefore makes the findings in this study from women's\nratings of altruistic behavior across all scenarios still valid.\nFuture research however may wish to explore the different\ntypes of altruism signaled in these individual scenarios sepa-\nKelly & Dunbar, 2001) or charitable giving (e.g., Barclay,\nfor the extraneous variables that may also be signaled (e.g.,\nphysical strength across different heroic scenarios) to ensure\nthat only the value of that type of altruism in mate choice is\nreliably being examined.\nIt will be important for additional research to build on these\nfindings in certain directions to further aid our understanding.\nFirstly, an examination of menstrual cycle effects may shed\nsome light on the results obtained here. In particular, how they\nmay affect the potential weightings of altruism and physical\nattractiveness in women's ratings of men's desirability across\nthe cycle. Also, future research needs to examine the effects\nfound here in men's ratings of the desirability of altruistic\nwomen as well. This is because there is a lack of such research\nin this area, as most studies have concentrated on only women's\nratings. However, when both sexes are investigated, it has led\nthat altruism has been shaped by mutual mate choice in humans\n(Miller, 2000). It is therefore important to see whether this is\nalso the case when physical attractiveness is also explored\nalongside it. Also of value would be an exploration of the\ninteraction of the different variables used here in real-world\nmate choice settings. Experimentally derived findings on mate\nchoice decision making such as those outlined here can only\nbenefit from seeing if the same findings are present when look-\ning at actual relationships and interactions in the real world,\nwhich is a methodology successfully employed elsewhere (e.g.,\nTo conclude, these findings make a substantial contribution\nto our understanding of the role of altruistic behavior in human\nmate choice by including the previously unexplored additional\nvariables of physical attractiveness. Overall, the results provide\nfurther support for the view that altruism acts as an important\ntrait in mate choice, particularly for LT relationships. This has\nimportant implications for our understanding of how we under-\nstand the expression of altruism and other traits holistically by\ncasting further light on the rich tapestry that is human mating.\nThis is also evident in the fact that the current study also sug-\ngests that nonaltruism may have a role in mate choice, perhaps\naligning the spectrum of behavior explored here with research\non traits such as the Dark Triad. As such, the current study can\naid our understanding of altruism not only in mate choice but\nalso in different everyday occurrences of this ubiquitous but\nenigmatic trait.\nFarrelly et al. 5\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nBarclay, P.
