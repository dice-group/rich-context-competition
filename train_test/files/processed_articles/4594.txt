It also suggests that\nhackathons can be investigated as a `datalogical struc-\nture' (Clough et al., n.d., 2015) in terms of the events\nthemselves and as particular prototypes pertaining to\nhow innovation and creativity occurs \u00ad as increasingly\ndata driven and automated. In relation to hackathon\nevents, these normative and quotidian configurations\nalso highlight a real disjuncture between the way data\nis discursively constructed, and the way data is vari-\nously and unevenly operationalized in the material\nand embodied processes of the events themselves.\nInhabiting the hack\nHackathons are established methods and `spaces of\ninnovation' in the corporate sector (see Go\n\u00b4 mez Cruz\nand Thornham, 2016) but are also emerging in the\n1University of Leeds, UK\n2RMIT University, Australia\nCorresponding author:\nHelen Thornham, University of Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, UK.\nEmail: h.thornham@leeds.ac.uk\nBig Data & Society\nbds.sagepub.com\nCreative Commons CC-BY: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License (http://\nwww.creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits any use, reproduction and distribution of the work without further\npermission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-\nat-sage).\npublic and third sectors across the globe (see also Irani,\nfor histories of the hackathons). They have been\nwidely discussed and critiqued within academia and\nindustry2 and our aim for this paper is to draw on\nour experiences in order to critically discuss what we\nperceive as the underlying and connective thread across\nall the hackathons events we researched: the discursive,\ntechnological and material significance of data.\nFor our research, the hackathons we attended were\ndelineated along three axes: (1) Those within the arts\nand creative sectors, where programmers, coders, hack-\ners, digital artists used hack and `wreck' methods to\nexplore digital objects as new ways of `creative' and\npolitical disruption (Octopus, FoAM, Access Space,\nDigital Labs, MzTek, ODI and MadLab). (2) Those\nwithin the public sector, where the model of the hacka-\nthon and creative lab has been adopted as means of fast\ninnovation and public engagement (see also Gregg,\n2015). An extension of this also includes key user\ngroups (families, young people, disabled groups) who\nwork with coders, programmers and designers to `solve'\na social, health or cultural issue (`Leeds Hack', `Hack\nthe City', `Young Peoples Digital Innovation Lab',\n`Watch-It', `Leeds NHS Hack', `Leeds Data Mill\nhacks'). (3) Those within the corporate sectors where\nindividuals or groups are invited to develop prototypes\nor ideas into marketable commodities, usually competi-\ntively, through a range of established hackathons meth-\nods (Up London, Digital Shoreditch and USTWO \u00ad a\ndigital products studio). While these events varied enor-\nmously in terms of politics and aims, what was notable\nfor us was not only the reach of the hackathons across\nmany sectors but also the continual feeling of de\n\u00b4 ja\n` vu\nwe experienced regardless of the event.\nWe attended just over 20 hackathons in the UK\nwe also worked with hackathons organizers and digital\nartists as they organized and ran hackathons events in\norder to understand processes behind the events and\ntheir position within a wider spectrum of temporality\n(beyond the discrete event itself). The particular meth-\nodological approach we used in our fieldwork was\ndrawn from Pink et al.'s (2015) concept of `digital eth-\nnography', which is situated in the politics and prin-\nciples of reflexivity, participation and observation but\nis also attuned to the (digital) mediatory elements of\ndigital culture (2015: 3). Our aim was to understand\nthe event from the perspectives of those involved, and\nreflexively consider our own involvement, with a central\nquestion around the issue of innovation: who claimed it,\nwhen and how. Our methodological leanings were\ntowards ethnography and we drew on a wide corpus\nof research not only in feminist new media theory, eth-\nnography and digital anthropology but also in design,\ndigital humanities, organizational studies, business\nmanagement and science and technology studies to\nanchor our approach (see e.g., Hoholm and Araujo,\nalso aware of the unique temporal and spatial environ-\nment of hackathons and so were also informed by the\nnotion of `fast' digital ethnography following the work\nof Hoholm and Araujo (2011), which focuses on `an\nemerging object or practice from the inception of an\nidea to its successful realization (or indeed failure)'\nthe object and practice of our research was not innov-\nation, in fact, but data, and this posed different meth-\nodological and critical questions for us. It led us on two\npaths: the first was a discussion of the ethnographic\nmaterial and considerations of methods and practice\n(written about elsewhere).3 The second path \u00ad encapsu-\nlated in this article \u00ad was a critical interrogation of the\nsignificance of data within and beyond these events.\nAlthough we reference ethnographic material, then,\nthis paper is a reflective and critical interrogation and\nnot a presentation of the ethnographic material per se.\nIn what follows, we discuss three interwoven strands\nthat emerged from our research: data as discourse, data\nas datalogical and data as materiality. These three con-\nfigurations enable us to elucidate the multiple and oscil-\nlatory alignments of data. For example, on the one\nhand hackathons are only possible because of digital\ntechnologies and their underpinning datasets, and this\nis written into the discursive signifiers of the events\nthemselves.4 This means that data is both a discursive\ntrope with particular affordances and a material `con-\ndition' of the events (Suchman, 2007). At the same time\nand as we discuss in this paper, data is simultaneously\nobscured through the infrastructure of the hackathon\nevents where the emphasis is on creativity and innov-\nation. For us, this reconfigures certain power relations\nand undermines (we argue) the possibility for a deeper\ninterrogation of the politics of data as an operational or\nconditional force. Given this, hackathons are not just\nemergent and proliferating events and methods across a\nrange of sectors: they are also a useful lens to interro-\ngate contemporary issues around (big) data not least\nbecause they return us to issues around discursive and\nmaterial automation (see also Bassett, 2016; Clough\npolitics of data and a critical inquiry into `datalogical'\nData as discourse\nAs suggested above, `data' is a discursive trope with\nparticular affordances for the events themselves and\nwritten into the language of the events through an\nexplicit reference to the digital and to particular\n2 Big Data & Society\ncultural moments and politics of digital culture.5 The\nsecond issue is that these constructions of data also\nobscure a very real discriminatory politics in which\nnon-valuable data (`raw', `dirty', `waste' data) is not\nsimply negated, it is actively unsought, dismissed, dis-\nappeared. This means there is a politics at the heart of\nthese events that remains unacknowledgeable through\nthe discourse of data. At the same time, because data is\nconstructed as a malleable, benign tool for participants,\nidentifying the discriminatory politics that are mobi-\nlized is a difficult task and one that resonates the exist-\ning debates within big data about obscured data\naggregation, value and waste (see boyd and\nThese politics can be discussed in a number of ways,\nbut for the purposes of this article, we will focus on two\ninterrelated issues: the first seeks to interrogate how\nthat discursive construct actively glosses over material\nand lived inequalities such as age, gender, class, ethni-\ncity that are also particular metrics used in the forma-\ntion of the event (in terms of the demographics who are\ninvited). The second looks at the kinds of data that\nbecomes unavailable \u00ad the `waste' data; data that\ncannot be `cleaned' \u00ad and so continually fails to frame\nthis data in an operational capacity: not only can\n`waste' data not frame the subsequent prototypes or\nproducts that emerge during the hackathon, such data\nis also never referenced or acknowledged as potentially\nframing \u00ad they are written out of the process of cre-\nation, the discourse that underpins it and the subse-\nquent product that emerges.\nFor the hack events that were more consciously pol-\nitically orientated \u00ad such as those organized by\nMadLab or the ODI, the women only hack event, or\nthose run by the NHS that sought intervention into a\nsystem of care \u00ad participants were carefully invited\nalong key demographic lines. They were chosen because\nof their particular value: they were women, they repre-\nsented a certain set of disciplines, they were users of an\nexisting system that needed changing, they had particu-\nlar expertise or they were the ultimate users of the new\nsystem that was sought. To a certain extent then, it is\nworth noting that the demographic organization of a\nhack event is also, in a similar fashion to `clean data',\nwritten along a value system where key identity signi-\nfiers are aggregated and afforded particular value. In\nsaying this, we are not drawing a direct correlation\nbetween clean data and participant demographics.\nInstead we are simply noting that the processes cri-\ntiqued in relation to big data (see boyd and\nof aggregation in the formation of data and along the\ndata points and `variables that have the most utility'\nthan we might at first acknowledge. Similarly just as\nthe power relations behind these processes of aggrega-\ntion are sometimes obscure, so hack organizers write\nout their own intervention in their (later) narratives of\nthe socio-technical outcomes of the event and the spe-\ncific contribution that these chosen demographics con-\ntribute to the event.\nThe second point to make here is that many of these\ndemographics could neither find themselves in, nor\nidentify with, the datasets they were invited to use by\nthe organizers. We worked with obese families who\ncould not locate the complexities of their obesity\nwithin the datasets they were offered (the datasets\npulled together income, class and age for example,\nbut not other health and mental health issues, family\nrelations, debt or education). We worked with not in\neducation, employment or training (NEET) groups\nwho appeared as unemployed and female and in\nLeeds, but not (also) as being a primary carer or as\nhaving a mental or physical disability, for example. In\nother words, the datasets were always incomplete, yet\nwere presented as `clean' data to the participants. The\nissue here is not about the completeness of a dataset;\nthe issue is that certain datasets were valued over others\nwithin the parameters of the hackathon (presumably\nfor time, ease, cost, availability, aims of organizers,\netc.). At the same time the rationale for valuing certain\ndatasets over others was masked through a discourse of\n`cleanliness', which worked to construct those datasets\nas benign. The participants had to decide whether to\nactively seek different datasets thus taking up valuable\ntime from the event or to use the available datasets. If\nthey did the latter, the elements that mattered to those\ndemographics (such as being a primary carer or giving a\npercentage of income support routinely to another\nfamily member) remained obscured in whatever they\nbuilt, or had to be retrospectively and consciously\nadded, while the discourse of `clean' data remained\nrelatively unchallenged.\nOf course, participants have different stakes in the\nhackathons and indeed the data they use, they have\ntheir own politics and aims: the datasets were in no\nway evenly taken up, but neither were they benign in\nany way. As many researchers have noted, data is\nuneven and wrought along political and power rela-\ntions: data `depend on hierarchy' (Gitelman and\nJackson, 2013: 8); they are `correlated' in particular\nways to construct particular value (Mayer-\nScho\ndiscourse of cleanliness, malleability and openness,\nthe data was simultaneously constructed as the bedrock\nfor and of innovation or creativity (as fuel, a building\nblock, a terrain). We heard this kind of comment at\nnearly every hackathon we attended: `This is non-raw\ndata, and it's clean' (Ian Holt, Ordinance Survey.\nThornham and Cruz 3\nDigital Shoredich, 2014); `The data is clean, it's there\nfor you, its ready to use' (Leeds Data Mill Hack, 2013);\n`I have a lot of really, really clean data for you. So it's\nreally easy to use' (Bruce Darling, UP London\nHackathon, 2013). Seen here, data was constructed as\ncentral tools for the events, and better because data is\n`ready' to use, speedier and can be automatically and\ninteroperably (computationally) aggregated.\nThe data was also constructed as open and transpar-\nent \u00ad and available for anyone to use (`programming is\neasy, it's just a matter of `ifs' and where to put them'\n(Leeds Hack, 2014), or `all I need is the data, once I\nhave that, its easy' (UP London, 2013). By comparison,\n`raw' data required interpretation, sorting, translating:\nthey required human agency to make them useable. Our\nargument here is that the discursive construct of data\nwrites out the possibility of interrogating the silences\nwithin the datasets \u00ad the discriminations \u00ad and makes\nthe converse claim that, if anyone can use it, data actu-\nally promotes and enforces equality and openness.\nThese discursive constructions of data also reveal\nhuge investment in the creation of particular structures\nin which and through which data can emerge: if `clean'\ndata is more valuable (or only `clean' data is considered\ndata) this goes precisely against the notion of big data\nas `clean' representations of reality (see also Gitelman\n2014: 4). Discursively, then, there is as much investment\nin the cleaning of data as there is in trying to demon-\nstrate that data speaks to/for itself. Data as `clean' dem-\nonstrates the results of this investment, whilst also, of\ncourse, obscuring the processes behind it (see also\nDuring many of the hackathons we attended, par-\nticipants came up not only against data they could not\nidentify with, then, but they also came up against inac-\ncessible datasets such as land register data, social hous-\ning data. The women only hack event (Newcastle, 2015)\nfor example, had an implicit gender politics that had to\nbe forged through the human and material. There was\nalso a concerted effort to `find' data relating to women\nin the North East, but the data was unclean, patchy,\ntoo `raw' to use. Instead, the participants ended up\nusing digital archive material or university material\nthat obscured class, age or geographic location, for\nexample. For the subsequent prototypes, this meant\nthat the politics of the data had to be retrospectively\nand actively imposed through the material and human\ninterventions. In nearly every instance, participants did\none of three things: they turned to familiar data and\nAPIs (familiar through their own use \u00ad weather data,\ntravel data) or to social media data (twitter or scraping\ntools that drew on social media data such as Klout6 or\nKred7) or they used the APIs made available by organ-\nizations at the hackathon (ordinance survey data,\nmapping data). For us, this further contributes to a\nself-fulfilling cycle that perpetually reinforces the\nnotion of data as a priori, self-evident and truthful\nnot least because in these instances, then, it was\n`clean' data that shaped what they built, and whatever\nthe original human/machine intention, the data that\nwas not clean did not register either in the process of\ncreativity or the final project.\nThese issues also reconfigure `waste' or `non-repre-\nsentational' data (Clough et al., n.d.; Thrift, 2007) in\nnew ways. Indeed, even if we recognize that in the\nhackathons, data was generative and conditioned the\npossibilities for the activities and prototypes (Clough\nas well as the `absences of relations' (Kitchin, 2014b:\nData as datalogical\nMany of the hackathon processes described above are\nbuilt on a wider, long-standing and normative con-\nstruction of data. Indeed as suggested above, the cen-\ntral underpinning element that enables data to be\nvalued and operationalized in the ways described\nabove relates to the long-term construction of data as\n`transparent', `self-evident', `the fundamental stuff of\ntruth itself' (Gitelman and Jackson, 2013: 2). In this\nsection, we briefly elucidate some of these issues in\norder to suggest that this explains some of the power\nrelations and processes described above and their wider\niteration beyond data `itself'. We also suggest that, par-\nticularly with the advent of big data, the notion of self-\nlegitimating datalogical structures is gaining traction\nwith a number of implications not only for the subse-\nquent valuing of the human and material but also for\nwider issues such as expertise and knowledge which are\n(re)located into the data processes. The irony, of\ncourse, is that the conception of datalogical systems\nas self-legitimating requires a huge amount of complex\n(and ironically, external) discursive, human and mater-\nial elements to sustain it.\nThere are a number of accounts (see also boyd and\nCrawford, 2012; Clough et al., n.d.; Gitelman and\nstand the long-term social, political and technological\ntrend towards a valuing of a system over an individual,\nand the subsequent consequences for contemporary\nconstructions of (big) data as the foundation of that\nsystem and as something that precedes information,\nGraeber's (2015) work into bureaucratic systems\noffers one avenue through which we can begin to under-\nstand the long-term shift towards trust and value in\nboth the system per se and systems of metrification\n4 Big Data & Society\nand quantification on which and through which (big)\ndata emerges. Indeed, for Graeber, the history of bur-\nfollowing this, of big data; his work parallels Mayer-\nScho\n\u00a8 nberger and Cukier when the latter talk about how\ndatafication and metrification are age-old conceptual\norists have in common is a concern with detailing how\nhuman trust and value has shifted from people onto\nsystems, and how this shift has further contributed\nnot only to the contemporary value in/of data and\nbig data in particular, but also how this shift increas-\ningly disables us from interrogating the system, com-\nprehending it, or indeed, intervening in it (see also\nBerry, 2014). Graeber remarks on how bureaucratic\nsystems have become (like big data) both indispensible\nand incoherent. The difference is that bureaucratic sys-\ntems have been (relatively successfully) critiqued\nthrough (neo)liberalism and right wing politics of the\ntique into its logic as a modus operandi of the system.\nFollowing this, the central issue for the purposes of\nthis article is how this long-term valuing and construc-\ntion of data is operationalized into and conditions sub-\nsequent value systems within the hackathon events. As\nwe discussed above, such discursive constructions of\ndata have material consequences in terms of what\nbecomes possible to build, to imagine or to utilize.\nBut this discursive construction of data exacerbates a\nsecond critique levelled at hackathons around their pol-\nitics. Irani has noted, for example, that hackathons are\nexceptionally good at masking a neoliberal and entre-\npreneurial politics in a language of innovation and cre-\nativity with similar consequences to those noted above\n(in relation to data) in terms of the socio-technical and\nshe argues, this results not only in the active enforce-\nment of a kind of citizenship as entrepreneurialism, but\nalso that this is imagined and constructed as a positive\nand productive force for social change (Irani, 2015:\n2\u00ad3). For the purposes of this article, then such con-\nsiderations remind us that data operates within and\nalongside a range of other powerful material and dis-\ncursive signifiers that similarly `condition' and shape\nthe event; they also remind us that data is also becom-\ning enmeshed in a wider discourse not only of creativity\nand innovation but also in the elision of these concepts\nwith that of entrepreneurialism. All of these concepts\nwork to disappear or negate an overt politics under the\nguise of the hackathon event8 and its premise of\ncreativity.\nThe second issue, which perhaps draws a more direct\nparallel with contemporary concerns around data,\nrelates to how the construction of data configures the\nhuman or material elements within the hackathon.\nIndeed, if we consider the way the human and material\nare conceived by organizers of events, this becomes\nclearer. Hackathon events are carefully structured\nwith delineated challenges, discussions, scenarios and\nresearch and build times written into them (see also\nGo\nIrani (2015) describes the design of (particularly cor-\nporate) hackathons as wrought with the politics of\nalthough there may be an overt discussion of techno-\nlogical or material `play' or even `failure' (when ideas\ndon't work), in reality and because of the temporal\nconditions of the events (with strict and rapid times\nthat are conducive to the notion of fast innovation);\nfailure, experimentation, labour and play are very min-\nimal activities within the scope of the hack.9 Instead, as\nwe have observed again and again, discussion is rapidly\nfollowed by build \u00ad and the build is, because it is both\nmaterial and human, necessarily the slowest element of\nan event that prioritizes speed not only through the\ntemporal dimensions of the event itself, but also\nbecause of the construction of big data as framing the\nconditions of, and possibilities for, the event. While we\nexplore this in more detail below in terms of the pro-\ncesses of hack events, the issue we want to note here\nrelates to the way disruption, failure, compromise and\nfrustration are all constructed as wholly human, as\nslow, and as a kind of necessary evil of the events.\nPartly these conceptions emerge from the construction\nof the events themselves as temporally specific \u00ad and as\nnecessarily fast. But they also emerge from the condi-\ntions introduced by data (as the tool, the bedrock, the\ngrounds on which such events are possible). Data, by\ncomparison to the human and material is conceptua-\nlized not only as clean, open, transparent and a priori\nto inequality and discrimination but data is also fast.10\nThis is further conflated by what we referred to earlier\nas self-legitimating datalogical structures that not only\nposition the human and material as separate from such\nstructures, but also as increasingly unnecessary \u00ad at\nleast in terms of legitimation or in terms of the gener-\nation of meaning or agency. It is this issue, of course,\nthat has drawn the most criticism and concern from\ntheorists writing about big data (see boyd and\nScho\nIndeed, datalogical structures, by comparison with\nhumans, are constructed as dynamically adaptive \u00ad they\nare both in a constantly fluid state and adaptively\nresponsive. Datalogical structures generate information\nand have the capacity to build in response to that infor-\nmation. They are self-referential and self-legitimating\n(partly because of the necessary obfuscation of the\nThornham and Cruz 5\nthe human element responds to them, they respond to\n(through interaction with) the outside (human) envir-\nonment (see Clough et al., n.d.: 7). This means not only\nthat datalogical structures and systems are self-referen-\ntial and durable (to use Latour's term 1990) but it also\nmeans that the frameworks for measurement and value\nare forged in the system `itself'. It does not need legit-\nimation or take-up by human or material agents: and in\nfact, this process is never as good, as fast, as productive\nas the system.\nThe final point to make here is in relation to the\ndiscursive and material process of automation, then,\nparticularly in relation to knowledge and expertise.\nIndeed, we suggest that the construction of data not\nonly as `a priori' (Drucker, 2011: 1) to information,\nbias, value, but also as the underpinning element of\nself-legitimating datalogical structure, conditions\nknowledge and expertise in particular ways. If we add\nwider constructions of smart technology to the concep-\ntions of data already discussed in this article, we not\nonly have `clean' and `truthful' data, but we also have\nclean and truthful data within a system that is conceived\n(Shepard, 2011). These are all terms that carry ideo-\nlogical weight and seek to elucidate the way that auto-\nmation is shifting expertise and knowledge away from\nthe human and (back) into the system (Webster, 2014:\n244). At the same time, the `system' is also becoming\nSimilarly, if expertise, knowledge and legitimacy are\nincreasingly and normatively located within the digital\nsystem (rather than with the human), human capacity\nfor intervening into or critiquing it is also shifting \u00ad\nleaving us with a human (slower, less dynamic, less\nadequate) mode of expertise, that is less capable of,\namongst other things, future thinking or planning. In\nconsidering, then, the constructions of data as datalo-\ngical, then, we also have to grapple with a very real\npolitics of data that is not (only) bounded by the experi-\nence of the hackathon, but is a much wider phenom-\nenon that collapses our capacity not only of\nintervention, but of future thinking, imagining and\nplanning; of expertise and knowledge into (to borrow\nfrom Clough et al., n.d.) `the changing parameters of\ncomputational arrangements' (Clough et al., n.d.: 15,\nData as materiality\nThe final consideration of this article relates to the con-\ncept of data as materiality, which we understand in two\nkey ways. The first is through the transformation of\ndata into a tangible and literal material prototype\nthrough embodied socio-technical processes, which\nelucidate a range of tensions around what we call mun-\ndane and ritualized practices and the discourses of data\nalready discussed above. This offers a more ontological\nand embodied account of data reconfigured into the\nspecific parameters of a hackathon, as well as raising\nfurther critical questions for concepts like creativity,\ninnovation and automation. The second way we under-\nstand data as materiality relates to a more traditional\nconcept of technology as `disciplining' bodies\nCheney-Lippold (2011) and Nafus and Sherman\n(2014). Foucault's work explicitly connects metrics\nand measurement of populations with disciplining and\nmeasuring bodies (1997), which correlates if not elides\n(for the purposes of this article) participant demo-\ngraphics with socio-technical capital (see also\nGraeber, 2015). In the context of the hackathon with\nits temporal and spatial frameworks and clear delinea-\ntion of activities organized into specific events, this\nnotion of disciplining is a clear condition of the\nevents themselves that work to both enable and close\ndown certain embodied interactions and interventions.\nThese conditions, in turn, are centrally framed and con-\nditioned by data, in terms of the technical and material\nconditions for hackathon processes. In relation to this,\nwe suggest that there is a clear correlation between data\nand certain structures such as innovation and creative\nstructures like those pertaining to (and claimed by)\nhackathon events, as well as to wider issues such as\nresearch, knowledge and expertise. The convolution\nof the datalogical turn, of course, is that data is increas-\ningly positioned as the condition sine qua non so that\ndespite the socio-technical and material processes dis-\ncussed in this section, it is data that remains the power-\nful trope and condition of (and beyond) the hackathon\nevent.\nOn the one hand, data is transformed into a tangible\nand literal prototype through established and familiar\npractices that are enacted in the hackathon event as a\nprocess of innovation or creativity. Indeed, within the\nrelatively rigid structures of a hackathon, we found that\nparticipants necessarily arrived with established pro-\ncesses, ideas or products that were rolled out in a new\nenvironment, rather than entirely negotiated with other\nparticipants and arrived at during the event.12 Indeed,\nto create a new process of prototyping would be beyond\nthe usual temporal and organizational structures of the\nevent. This meant that social dynamics of the hacka-\nthon converge with the particular time pressures, result-\ning in a rapidly emergent dominant idea and process\nthat was conducive to the data available and the socio-\ntechnical conditions of the specific event (see Go\n\u00b4 mez\nCruz and Thornham, 2016). Most clearly, this was\ndemonstrated through participants arriving with their\nown kit: wires and systems, software, hardware,\n6 Big Data & Society\nspeakers, sensors or recording equipment, weaving\nlooms, projectors, amps. In our observations, this kit\nis adapted to the available data and the infrastructure\nof the hackathon to produce for example: knitting code\nthat can be translated into sound code within an estab-\nlished and created software (written by another partici-\npant) to be performed at the end of the event; sensors\nthat alter tonal register from male to female (or vice\nversa), using spoken recordings from available archival\ndata; Apps with established design principles that are\nmade to fit the particular requirements of the event.\nThere are a number of ways we could consider this.\nOne interpretation relates to how we conceive `innov-\nation' and `creativity' as something more in keeping\nwith what Shaun Moores has called `unreflective,\ntaken-for-granted' (digital) corporeal movement and\ndied actions occur in specific places and with specific\ninnovation and creativity are more about our mundane\nand ritualized practices or relationships with techno-\nlogical objects and processes that are enacted across a\nvariety of contexts (see also Kember and Zylinska,\ntiated socio-technical methods (Balsamo, 2011). To a\ncertain extent then, we might suggest that `innovation'\nis better conceptualized as a change of context and that\nthe processes (the infrastructures) of innovation actu-\nally remain relatively unchanged. Alternatively, we\ncould argue that innovation occurs in the spaces\nbetween the data and human \u00ad in the embodied prac-\ntices of participants \u00ad that may also recognize the pos-\nsibilities of human data agency within the structure of\nthe hackathon. From an organizational perspective, of\ncourse, participants arriving with their own kit, expert-\nise or methods further underpins the necessity of ensur-\ning a particular demographic presence at hackathon\nevents not least because there seems a clear correlation\nbetween participant demographics and socio-technical\ncapital as measured through the causal relationship of\nparticipant demographics and final prototype (see also\norganizers of hackathon events (particularly those\nworking with digital artists) reiterated the importance\nof the inclusion of particular skills and demographics\nbecause of how this related to `innovation' and `cre-\native' processes'13 as well as to a wider conception of\ntechnology and data as implicitly (through embodied\nsubjective process) human. Indeed as one organizer\ntold us:\nour hackathons have all been about treating technology\nas something that can be dissembled and reimagined\nnot as black boxes that can't be accessed. . . hackathons\nfor us are about humans reclaiming technology as\nhuman, taking it apart, claiming it for yourself.\nWhile we are not suggesting these processes or relations\nare transparent or causal, we are suggesting that within\na metrified and data-driven landscape, this interpret-\nation has particular traction. It also, in the wider con-\ntext of big data and self-legitimating structures,\nsuggests that we might be witnessing (as Clough et al.\n(n.d.) and Graeber (2015) suggest) a much wider appro-\npriation of bureaucratic and datalogical processes into\ndifferent contexts than we might otherwise note or\nacknowledge.\nA second interpretation of the data as materiality\nrelates to how we conceive processes of `innovation'\nand `creativity' (and even `imagination' see Go\n\u00b4 mez\nCruz and Thornham, 2016) as primarily data driven\n(through both the framework of the hackathon and\nthrough the methods and kit brought to the event by\nparticipants) and what this means for embodied and\nhuman subjectivities. Indeed, one argument we could\nmake within the specific temporal and spatial frame-\nworks of the hackathons relates to the ways embodied\nparticipation could be understood as a particular form\nof lived and embodied socio-technical action (even\nagency) that disrupts the disciplining power of the\ndata through embodied mediation. Indeed, some par-\nticipants actively used kits as disruptive methods in\norder to highlight the power relations, assumptions\nand politics at work within the hackathon. Their par-\nticipation was in and of itself a disruption to the pro-\ncesses, materialities, discourses and ideologies of the\nevents (see author). In this sense, we could argue that\nthe kits brought to events are disruptive digital\u00adhuman\nnegotiations that intervene into the process of the\nhackathon: they are familiar, routine and lived as well\nas digital, technological and datalogical.\nThese arguments draw on a range of literature\nwithin a longer trajectory of (feminist) STS studies\nthat investigates digital embodiment through concepts\nlike `intra-action' \u00ad entangled in and `intra' to the digi-\ntal, technological and discursive (Barad, 2009); digital\ndata\u00adhuman `assemblages' (Haraway, 2015; Lupton,\n2016: 4), or the `body multiple' as a site to explore\nlively data that is `ingested' or `emitted' (Mol, 2002,\ndied human subjectivity as data in relation to agency\nand power. Indeed in relation to the hackathon, they\noffer a powerful framework for enabling embodied\ndata\u00adhuman agency whereby the data is corporeally\nand discursively reconfigured through embodied\naction. But as Deborah Lupton has noted, these actions\nultimately generate more data that circulates in a wider\n`digital data economy' (2016: 4) beyond the initial cor-\nporeal and lived processes. This is not to undermine the\nThornham and Cruz 7\npotential of data\u00adhuman agency but to note its tem-\nporal and spatial contextuality. In the case of the\nhackathon, it seems that that ontological expertise,\nhuman everydayness and human\u00adtechnological pro-\ncesses of design are actually carefully and doubly\nframed and contextualized by not only the rigid infra-\nstructure of the event itself (and therefore only afforded\nbounded and embodied agency within the temporal and\nspatial frameworks of the event), but also by the vari-\nous conceptions of data discussed in this article (data as\ndiscourse, data as datalogical, data as materiality) that\ncontinually and ultimately try to (re)position data as\nthe powerful force that continue to operate beyond\nthese boundaries of the hackthon in a wider data econ-\nomy or datalogical system. This isn't always successful\n\u00ad in some cases the participants took their prototypes,\ncreated their own narratives of the events, circulated\ntheir activities in their own way after the event: they\nresisted these processes. But even as this occurred, the\nhackathons and their products were also being made to\nmean in other environments, where they became evi-\ndence of entrepreneurial success, claimed as innovation\nor innovative practice (see also Irani, 2015; Leckart,\n2012, author). Clough et al. understand this as this as\n(re)organizing embodied practices in relation to the\nvalues of the datalogical system, ultimately valuing\nthem (only) in terms of their capability of generating\ndata. Seen here the labour of the participants, their own\nnarratives of their activities and even their prototypes\nare surplus to, or an aside from, the final product:\n`bodily practices themselves instantiate as data, which\nin turn produces a surplus of bodily practices' (Clough\net al., n.d.: 11\u00ad12). Given this, and to reiterate our argu-\nment above, the convolution of the datalogical turn is\nthat data underpins, frames and generates `innovation'\nor `creative' practices. It is also ultimately positioned as\nthe condition sine qua non \u00ad beyond the spatial and\ntemporal lived conditions of a hackathon, and as the\ngenerator for such bounded activities within a hacka-\nthon event that can only ever minimally intervene into\nthe datalogical system which continues to be (drawing\non earlier arguments) faster, better, self-legitimating.\nOur argument for the purposes of this article, then, is\nthat despite the socio-technical and material processes\ndiscussed in this section, it is data that remains the\npowerful trope and condition of (and beyond) the\nhackathon event.\nConclusion\nThis article has explored data, discourse and materiality\nthrough the specific lens of the hackathon in order to\ninterrogate the socio-technical and political configur-\nations they engender. What we have demonstrated is\nthat data, as self-fulfilling prophecies and self-\nlegitimating structures is discursively, operationally\nand materially constructed as both the basis for, and\ncondition of, creative and innovative practices such as\nthose claimed within the discourses of the hackathon.\nPerhaps more importantly in the context of this article,\nthese discursive, operational and material constructions\nof data obscure and mask the enormous effort sur-\nrounding data that is necessary to position it as self-\nlegitimating and self-fulfilling.\nAt the same time, and as suggested at the start of this\narticle, data and datalogical structures already have an\nestablished presence in our lives. But what this article\nhas also attempted to demonstrate is that the claims\nmade in the relatively new field of big data \u00ad around\nmetrification, decision making, around infrastructure\nand processes of organization \u00ad have a long-term tra-\njectory in terms of wider value systems and discursive\nclaims. This means that we not only have to recognize\nevents like hackathons within the discursive, ideological\nand material parameters of (big) data, but also that\nhackathons reveal that many of those parameters pre-\nexist and condition the contemporary discourses of big\ndata as well. This highlights to us that the politics of big\ndata have a long term and normative base beyond data-\nlogical structures, and that the turn towards big data\nhas revealed these politics in new ways that similarly\nmake demands of us (see also Gitelman, 2006;\nThis last issue raises questions around the kinds of\ndemands that can be made around big data, not least\nwhen human interventions are normatively positioned\nas always already inferior. And our hope is that in\nrecognizing data as discursive, as datalogical and as\nmateriality we can open up a different space where\nnew demands of the digital can be made. But in relation\nto this, we also have to ask about our own complicity.\nIndeed, Caroline Bassett has recently critiqued our\n`post-digital desire to accept the presence of. . .technol-\nogy as a given, but also to put it aside' in the explan-\nalready figured within discursive and material power\nrelations (and vice versa) but routinely set aside in\nexplanations of them. Indeed our interrogation of\nhackathons reveals a very real discriminatory politics\nat work in the infrastructure of the event, in the valuing\nof data, in the participant demographics, in the claims\nmade about the value of such activities. At the same\ntime, these politics are simultaneously negated or dis-\nappeared in the datalogical system, or located expressly\nat the site of the human with lesser interventionist abil-\nity. In the end, then, the politics of data that are\nrevealed here as having much wider resonance beyond\na datalogical system demand that we consider and\nquestion our own roles in the long-term normative con-\nstitution of data. This is necessary if we are to move\n8 Big Data & Society\nbeyond a simple "
