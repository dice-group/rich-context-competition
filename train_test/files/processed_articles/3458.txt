    "abstract": "Abstract\nAlthough lifetime employment was once commonplace, the situation has changed dramatically over the last century. The\ngroup of precarious workers has increased, and with it, the size of the precariat. Although there is a body of research on how\nprecarious workers perceive the effect of their precarity on their social, psychological, and economic well-being, there is no\nresearch on the needs of precarious workers. In this article, we report the findings of an exploratory study about precarious\nworker's needs. The findings show that the precariat has a diversity of needs, ranging from the need for a higher income to\nthe need for a change in the discourse on self-reliance. Most of the needs are targeted toward the government and are not\nonly related to labor. This is, however, contradictory to the ideology of downsizing the welfare state, in which governments\nfocus on creating more temporary or steppingstone jobs. The needs show that the measures orientated toward the labor\nmarket are insufficient because they meet only a marginal part of the needs of the precariat.\n",

Social, economic, and polit-\nical forces have aligned to make labor more precarious\n(Kalleberg, 2009, p. 8). Phenomena such as the economic\ncrisis and the change from a manufacturing to a service and\nhigh-technology economy have resulted in the curtailment\nof salaries, downsized privileges, uncertain career expecta-\ntions, job losses, and job insecurity (see, for example,\nphenomena have increased the precarity of workers. The\ndemand for increased flexibility and the reduction of labor\ncosts have led employers to seek a more flexible workforce\ntemporary workers, employers gain organizational flexibil-\nity (Smith, 1997). This flexibility has resulted in precarious\nlabor relations in which people, especially those in the most\nvulnerable groups such as migrants, younger and older\nworkers, and less-educated workers, are at risk of slipping\ninto a permanent state of precarity.\nThe retrenchment of social security and the dominant\nneoliberal ideology in recent decades contributed to policies\nin which unemployment benefits are made unattractive and\nhard to qualify for. These policies promote paid labor as a\nfundamental need that makes us happy, defines us, and gives\nus satisfaction, suggesting that those who belong to the\nprecariat have only themselves to blame (Standing, 2011).\nResearch shows that precarious workers feel powerless to\nchange their work (Ashford, Lee, & Bobko, 1989) and their\ngovernmental relations (Standing, 2011). The above-men-\ntioned changes have far-reaching consequences for precari-\nous workers (see, for example, Standing, 2011), as they\nrestrain their social, economic, and psychological needs.\nA body of research has examined how precarious workers\nperceive their uncertainty (e.g., Schmidt, 1999) and obliga-\ntions (Robinson, Kraatz, & Rousseau, 1994) and the effects\nof their precarious labor situation on their social, psychologi-\ncal, and economic well-being (e.g., Benach, Vives, Tarafa,\nDelclos, & Muntaner, 2016; Bosmans, Hardonk, De Cuyper,\n& Vanroelen, 2016). There is also a body of research on how\na government's labor market and social security policies\ncontribute to precarity through precarious work relations\n(see, for example, Rodgers, 2004). There is, however, no\nresearch on the social, psychological, and economic needs of\nthose who belong to the precariat.\n1Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences, The Netherlands\nCorresponding Author:\nHafid Ballafkih, Centre for Applied Research on Economics &\nManagement, Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences, Wibautstraat 3b,\nEmail: A.H.Ballafkih@hva.nl\nA Job and a Sufficient Income Is Not\nEnough: The Needs of the Dutch\nPrecariat\nHafid Ballafkih1, Joop Zinsmeister1, and Martha Meerman1\n Keywords\nprecariat, precarious workers, needs, precariat needs\n2 SAGE Open\nWilthagen and Tros (2004) argued in the debate on flexi-\nbility and security that the needs of employers and workers\nshould be deliberately synchronized to enhance the flexibil-\nity of workers and the labor markets and enhance the security\nof workers in and outside the labor market (p. 169). To com-\nbine flexibility and security, a greater insight into the needs\nof the precariat is necessary. Understanding their needs is\nimportant because their needs reveal what workers want and\nwhat stops them from satisfying their needs.\nWe realized that an understanding of precarious workers'\nneeds would contribute to the debate on the labor flexibility\nand social security of the precariat and offer an insight into\nthe needs that the precariat and precarious workers have\ntoward the government and employers by focusing on their\nlabor-related needs. This study, therefore, addressed the fol-\nlowing research question: What are the social, economic, and\npsychological needs of the precariat regarding labor?\nThis exploratory research focused on the precariat in an\nurban area in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. In the following\nsections, we elaborate theoretically on the precariat, precari-\nous workers, and their needs. We end the section with a brief\noverview of the social security and legislation systems of the\nNetherlands to provide insight into the Dutch context.\nPrecariat, Precarity, and the Changed\nNeeds\nIdentifying a single factor or mechanism that explains the rise\nof the precariat and precarious labor is not easy, as work and\nwork relations are highly diversified and finely woven into\ndifferent social, political, and economic systems. Research\nfrom several disciplines on nonstandard employment, includ-\ning precarious work, shows that employment diversification,\nthe erosion of security that was embedded in labor laws and\ncollective labor agreements, and the changed status of work-\ners in general (Frade, Darmon, & Laparra, 2004) have\nincreased precarious work and the precariat (Standing, 1999).\nThe debate on precarious work, however, is dominated by\nglobalization, neoliberalism, efficiency, cutbacks in the wel-\nfare state, shifting responsibilities (from collective to indi-\nvidual responsibility), and commodification.All these aspects\nhave made the life of workers more insecure.\nResearch (see, for example, Siegmann & Schiphorst,\nthrough changing work and governmental relations. Some of\nthe new relations are perceived by researchers as permanent\nchanges, whereas others argue that the changes are not per-\nmanent and that they have adverse effects on employees'\nsecurity (see, for example, Vulkan, 2012).\nIn western societies, social security systems were devel-\noped to offer individuals different forms of security by\nsharing insecurities and risks as a society. The idea of soli-\ndarity--sharing risks and insecurities--has decreased over\ntime; these days, risks and insecurity are increasingly being\ntransferred to workers (Standing, 2011). A tremendous\nRodgers, 2004) shows that work has become much more\nprecarious, primarily in countries where dismissing perma-\nnent workers is subject to greater legal constraints (Rodgers,\nLabor rights, as argued by Standing (2014), resulted in a\nfictitious decommodification of labor that made workers\ndependent on wage labor (p. 967). In the resulting recom-\nmodification (i.e., treating labor power as a commodity that\ncan be bought and sold), governments played an ambiguous\nrole. Workers were exposed to the flexibility of employers'\nneeds and were expected by governments to market their\nown labor. Governments enforced self-responsibility by cut-\nting back and placing conditions on social benefits, reducing\nsocial protection and being anti-collective.\nThe combined effects of social and labor security retrench-\nment changed the relations between workers and employers\nand between workers and government. Theories on human\nneeds (e.g., Doyal & Gough, 1991) argue that environmental\nfactors affect the needs and the role in how needs are\nexpressed in behavior. One could contend that those who\nbelong to the precariat, as argued by Standing (2011), func-\ntion poorly because their needs are not fulfilled (see, for\nthat the precariat is able to identify what it wishes to combat\nand what it wants to construct, hinting at the changed needs.\nPrecariat and Precarious Workers1\nStanding (2011) argued that the precariat is a nascent class, if\nnot a settled and slowly increasing class.2 Others, such as\nAllen (2014), argue that the precariat is a bogus concept and\ndeny that it exists as a separate entity from the rest of the\nworking class. However, he does recognize the existence of\nthe precarity that results from new labor relations. The pre-\ncariat is defined by its members'economic opportunities and\nlife chances, which are mainly formed around employment-\nthe employment relation from the ordinary employment rela-\ntions of the working class (Erikson & Goldthorpe, 1992).\nDue to the insecurity of labor, which originates from unbal-\nanced labor contracts,3 specific exchanges become more dif-\nfuse, which results in experiences of hardship, insecurity,\nand unyielding material constraints for employees (Breen,\nPrecarious workers have existed for as long as paid labor\nhas existed, and in several countries around the world, precar-\nity is widespread. The debate about precarious work has re-\nemerged due to the growing awareness of the growth of\nnonstandard forms of work and the deterioration of labor rela-\nto Kalleberg (2009), the restructuring of work on a global\nscale, the centralization of the service sector, layoffs as a\nrestructuring strategy, and weak labor ideologies has made\nprecarity pervasive and generalized to all sectors and jobs.\nBallafkih et al. 3\nPrecarious workers who belong to the precariat are the\nflexi workers, the unemployed, and the detached (Standing,\n1999). These groups lack an occupational identity or narra-\ntive, as they are flexible in terms of the type of labor they\nperform, which results in them experiencing both employ-\nment and job insecurity (Standing, 2014). Precarious work\nin general refers to employment that falls below a standard\nnorm (atypical). This type of work leads to insecurity, eco-\nnomic and social inequality, and instability at both the\nindividual and the collective levels, in which the social and\neconomic risks are transferred to the individual worker\nThe heterogeneity of nonstandard forms of work--such\nas temporary, fixed-term, casual, self-employment, and on-\ncall and part-time work--does not necessarily imply precari-\nous work or the precarious character of work (Olsthoorn,\n2014). Insufficient income to ensure well-being is a more\nimportant factor in the experience of precarity (B\u00fcchtemann\n& Quack, 1989). The nonstandard forms of employment\nincreasingly go hand in hand with low wages (minimum\nwage), a lack of fringe benefits and protection from unfair\ndismissal (e.g., due to redundancy), and low-quality jobs.\nThe term \"working poor\" was initially used in non-west-\nern European countries. These days, the term is prominent in\nall countries (see, for example, Lansley & Reed, 2013). An\nincreasing proportion of paid workers in Europe who live on\nor marginally above the poverty threshold experience diffi-\nculties in making ends meet (Standing, 2011). The cutbacks\nin unemployment benefits, if they qualify for additional ben-\nefits at all, create difficulties for those who hold nonstandard\njobs. Although the \"working poor\" are highly correlated with\nthe precariat and precarity, it is incorrect to equate these\nBecause of the different definitions and measurement\n(see, for example, Olsthoorn, 2014), for this research, we\ndefined precarious workers as those who are paid a minimum\nwage, who perform temporary work with no prospect of a\nlong-term contract (2 years or more), or who are unemployed\nand looking for paid work.4\nNeeds of the Precariat\nThe precariat faces many uncertainties, as asserted by, for\nexample, Standing (2011). Psychological research shows\nthat certainty and security are two of the basic needs of\nhuman beings (see, for example, Doyal & Gough, 1991;\nHerzberg, Mausner, & Snyderman, 1993). In this study, we\nconsider needs to be the essential or very important require-\nments or requisites the precariat has regarding labor.\nResearch conducted over the last two decades leaves little\ndoubt about the effect of subjective insecurity on social, eco-\nnomic, physical, and psychological well-being (see, for\nVulkan, 2012). The most important latent aspects related to\nprecarity are the higher risk of unemployment, obtaining pre-\ncarious contracts, low wages (Schmid, 2010), economized\nsocial services, poverty, and alienation (Standing, 2011).\nThese aspects indicate that the precariat and precarious\nworkers score low on the satisfaction of such fundamental\nhuman needs5 as participation, protection, and security.\nThe recent debate on precarious work is mainly focused\non latent and manifest work-related job insecurity needs. Job\ninsecurity is experienced when job situations are threatened\ndue to the powerlessness of workers to keep a preferred job\nor a job that generates sufficient income to generate viable\noutcomes.\nexpected unemployment (job insecurity) is likely to be as\ndistressing as actual unemployment. Research has also\nshown that unemployment has a destructive effect on the\nsocial, economic, and psychological well-being of workers.\nUnemployed people have higher levels of psychological dis-\ntress (Henwood & Miles, 1987) and depression (see, for\nexample, Jahoda, 1982), as not all of their needs are satisfied\nor have reached an internal equilibrium.\nOne of the dominant theories on well-being is Jahoda's\n(1982) latent deprivation theory. This theory provides insight\ninto the benefits that people miss out on when they are unem-\nployed. The precariat is characterized by unemployment. As\nStanding (2011) puts it, it is a part of their life. Furthermore,\nperforming precarious work can be just as damaging in latent\ndeprivation terms as unemployment (see, for example,\nPrause & Dooley, 2001). This makes the theory useful\nbecause the benefits reflect the needs.\nBased on the theory, it can be argued that paid work pro-\nvides both manifest benefits (associated with needs related\nto income) and latent benefits (associated with meeting\nsocial and psychological needs). Both types of benefits fos-\nter manifest and latent needs. Jahoda (1984) stated that\nindividuals \". . . have deep-seated needs for structuring\ntheir time use and perspective, for enlarging their social\nhorizon, for participating in collective enterprises where\nthey can feel useful, for knowing they have a recognised\nplace in society, and for being active . . .\" (p. 298). The\nmanifest benefits are required to satisfy the basic needs,\nwhich make manifest benefits the main reason why people\nperform paid work. The latent benefits arise when people\nare engaged in paid work, and these benefits are needed to\nsatisfy social and psychological well-being. Jahoda (1981)\nargues that employment imposes a time structure, creates\nshared experiences and contacts, gives goals and purpose,\nprovides personal status and identity, and enforces activity.\nThese latent \"objective\" consequences of employment help\nexplain way paid work is socially and psychologically sup-\nportive. She argues that even when the unemployed are\npaid liberally, they do not enjoy their \"leisure\" because they\nlosetheirself-respectandtheirsenseoftime.Unemployment\nreduces individuals' control over their life situation and life\n4 SAGE Open\nThe precariat (which mostly consists of unemployed peo-\nple) and precarious workers (flexi workers) lack both mani-\nfest and latent benefits, which makes it harder for them to\nsatisfy certain needs that are related to and dependent on paid\nwork.\nJahoda (1982) has provided insight into the effects of\nunemployment on social psychology. She argued that employ-\nment fulfills manifest and latent functions that meet basic\nhuman needs. She also argued that manifest needs play a role\nbut that the latent factors explain the main effect on mental\nwell-being. The manifest factors are those that are related to\nthe employment terms associated with having a paid job, such\nas a salary, a contract, and fringe benefits. The latent need\nfactors are those that are experienced as a result of employ-\nment, such as time structure, social contact, sharing of com-\nmongoals,status,andactivity.Thisimpliesthatunemployment\nand job insecurity erode manifest and latent needs.\nOther theorists have studied several aspects of insecurity\nand developed theories to explain the motivation of people to\nwork (e.g., Herzberg et al., 1993). Herzberg's two-factor\ntheory is one of the most widely used theories regarding\nworkers' needs. The theory incorporates two need\u00adexperi-\nence dimensions that refer to first-level factors (objective\naspect) and second-level factors (subjective meaning of an\nindividual; Herzberg et al., 1993). The job satisfaction fac-\ntors are divided into hygiene and motivation factors. The\nhygiene factors relate to supervision, interpersonal relations,\nphysical working conditions, salary, company policy and\nadministration, and security. Herzberg et al. (1993) defined\njob security as \"those features of the job situation which lead\nto assurance for continued employment, either within the\nsame company or within the same type of work or profes-\nsion\" (p. 41). The motivation factors include achievement,\nrecognition, the work itself, responsibility, and advancement.\nThese factors lead to positive job attitudes, as they are needed\nfor self-actualization. Although these factors tell us some-\nthing about the needs of those who hold jobs, they also give\nus insight into the factors that are important to the precariat\nand those who perform precarious labor.\nOrganizational behaviorists and psychological theorists\non security have shown that humans face essential and exis-\ntential insecurities. A basic need provided by society or the\nopportunity to fulfill a basic need is essential for humans to\nimprove their security. Due to external events and pressures\nthat generate existential insecurities, the precariat and pre-\ncarious workers are likely to formulate needs that will reduce\nthe existential insecurities. Given the distinct forms of inse-\ncurity, the needs will also be related to improving collective,\ncorporate, and individual security.\nIn addition to these organizational behaviorists and psy-\nchological theorists, Standing (2011), a labor market theo-\nrist, contended that those who face precarity lack the seven\nforms of labor-related security (p. 10), namely, labor market\nsecurity (adequate income-earning opportunities), employ-\nment security (protection against arbitrary dismissal), job\nsecurity (ability and opportunity to retain a niche in employ-\nment), work security (protection against accidents and ill-\nness at work), skill reproduction security (opportunity to\nacquire skills), income security (assurance of an adequate\nand stable income), and representation security (possessing\na collective voice in the labor market).6 These forms of\nsecurity reveal the needs of the precariat. These security\nforms, supported by the motivation theories of Herzberg\nframework in this research.\nThe Dutch Context\nTo understand the needs, here we give a brief overview of the\nDutch social security and labor market systems.7 We focus\non the new Participation Act to understand the legal and\nlabor context of the precariat in the Netherlands.\nThe structural unemployment of the last decade has\nincreased the pressure on governmental spending on social\nbenefits in the Netherlands. The rising costs have led to a\ndebate about the tenability of the safety net that is offered to\nthose who receive social benefits. The debate resulted in a\ncutback in social benefits that led to \"workfare\" policies, in\nwhich a large proportion of those dependent on welfare\nassistance were required to perform paid or unpaid labor. The\nchanges also indicate a shift in public opinion on social ben-\nefits for those who are or become unemployed.\nThese workfare policies were supplemented by a retrench-\nment of employment protection laws. The retrenchment was\nmainly prompted by the dominant neoclassical economists'\nview that more employment could be created if employers\nwere subject to fewer such laws.\nThe government aims for a flexicurity model (see, for\nexample, Wilthagen & Tros, 2004) that primarily improves\nthe flexibility of the labor market using a \"reflexive\" labor\nlaw strategy. This strategy is obtained, defined, and modified\nin a constant dialogue with the stakeholders, namely, govern-\nment, trade unions, and employers' organizations. The dia-\nlogue, however, is dominated by a neoliberal ideology. The\nsocial welfare system still offers security but in a reduced\nform, leading to more precarity.\nThe Dutch government aims to achieve the participation\nof all citizens through its new \"flex law,\" which is intended\nto minimize the gap between those with flexible and those\nwith permanent contracts. After 2 years, a temporary con-\ntract must be converted into a permanent contract. The gov-\nernment hopes that this measure will improve labor market\neffects by improving the legal position of employees\n(strengthening the position of flex workers), simplifying dis-\nmissal and reforming unemployment benefits by reducing\ntheir maximum duration.\nAlong with the flex law, the government also introduced\nthe Participation Act,8 which promotes work for unem-\nployed, low-skilled, and disabled persons through subsidies\nto employers.9 It requires people to perform, according to\nBallafkih et al. 5\ntheir ability, either unpaid work (volunteer work) or socially\nuseful work (work in addition to labor that does not displace\nexisting labor) to receive or to apply for social benefits.\nIt is argued that although these policy initiatives are\nquickly phased-in as responses to the crisis, they reflect a\nmore fundamental reorientation in managing and dealing\nwith the risks of unemployment (see, for example, Van\nThe Act aims to recalibrate responsibilities between gov-\nernment and citizens. The line of thought in this Act is that\nlabor, care, and social support are first and foremost the\nresponsibility of citizens. In this responsibility discourse\n(social compulsion), citizens are prospected as individuals\nwho are self-responsible for their labor participation. This\nruns the risk that citizens respond with counter-responsibility\nclaims (Verhoeven & Tonkens, 2013) and an increase of dis-\ntrust in the government (Standing, 1999). Those who belong\nto the precariat are particularly likely to respond in this man-\nner because they have certain unmet social, psychological,\nand economic needs that diminish their self-responsibility.\nAlthough the effects of the flex law and the Participation\nAct have not yet been measured, anecdotal evidence sug-\ngests that employers terminate temporary contracts just\nbefore the 2 years are up, and that people are not eager to\nperform unpaid, socially useful work in return for the social\nbenefits they receive.\nMethod\nWe conducted this exploratory research in an urban area of\nAmsterdam. The area has higher levels of unemployment,\npoverty, and ethnic diversity than most other urban areas in\nthe Netherlands. We chose this area because of the increased\nlikelihood of finding people who belong to the precariat.\nHowever, getting them to participate in the research was dif-\nficult. They were suspicious because they did not see any\nbenefits for themselves. We often heard \"What's in it for\nme?\" or \"If you [the researcher] have a job for me, you're\nwelcome.\" The possibility that we were collaborating with\nthe local government also deterred people from participating\nin the research. Due to this suspicion, mainly of government\nand government-related organizations, we used existing\ngroups for focus group meetings. Using focus groups changes\nthe participants'role from an individual to a collective voice,\nwhich is likely to make them feel more comfortable about\ndiscussing their needs.\nBecause most of the participants in the groups knew each\nother, we thought it likely that some of them would feel\ninhibited about speaking freely due to group dynamics, hier-\narchy, and power. To reduce this possibility, the groups were\nled through an open discussion by a skilled researcher, who\nwas instructed to generate a rich discussion that involved all\nparticipants. However, not all participants and groups spoke\nfreely. Some participants showed signs of inhibition (e.g.,\nasking for confirmation from other members).\nDue to the distrust and the anticipated inhibition, we made\nthe focus groups as simple and as accessible as possible (free\nof obligations and no registration, because not all partici-\npants felt comfortable about giving their family names).\nParticipants and Procedures\nGiven the diversity and the broad definition of the precariat,\nseveral focus groups were needed to produce valid results.\nAll of the groups had different backgrounds, interests, and\nstorylines. The heterogeneity and exploratory character of\nthe research led to 29 focus groups, because saturation was\nhard to research. The 29 groups consisted of 343 participants,\n31 different nationalities. The groups consisted of 12 (SD =\n4.1) participants on average and were made up of employed\n(precarious workers) and unemployed workers, such as\ncleaners, artists, temporary workers, working students and\nhousewives, of different ages, ethnic backgrounds, legal resi-\ndency status, and education levels.\nThe focus groups were held in February and May 2015.\nEach meeting lasted 60\u00ad120 min, although not all of the time\nwas spent talking about the subject. After planning the focus\ngroups with the key figures, one researcher and one assistant\nresearcher conducted the groups.The researcher was instructed\nto use the prestructured open-ended questions and only to\nprobe during the discussion when clarity or focus was needed.\nThe majority of the focus groups were audio-recorded.\nUnfortunately, some of the participants did not give permis-\nsion to record the focus groups, mainly because of the vulner-\nabilityofrecordedvoices(e.g.,thefocusgroupwithMoroccan\nwomen argued that recorded voices are vulnerable in the age\nof the Internet). Therefore, we used the reports of and the\nnotes taken during those focus groups in our analysis. The\naudio-recordings of the other focus groups were transcribed.\nData Analysis Method\nWe used the concepts from the literature to code the tran-\nscripts to grasp the needs of the precariat in a grounded the-\nory approach (e.g., Charmaz, 2014). We tried to maximize\nthe reliability (stability, accuracy, and reproducibility) of this\nresearch by following the guidelines of Krippendorff (2012).\nWe attempted to maximize reproducibility by having the\ntranscripts coded and analyzed by two researchers sepa-\nrately. The codes and related quotations were analyzed and\norganized into needs. After coding, the researchers com-\npared and discussed the differences in findings and interpre-\ntations. The findings on which the researchers disagreed\nwere omitted. Ultimately, a picture of the needs emerged,\nand they were discussed by a group of researchers who par-\nticipated as moderators.\nHowever, it is important to note that the needs identified\nin this article were raised by the participants but were not\nmentioned in all of the focus groups. For some of the needs,\n6 SAGE Open\nthere was a high level of agreement within and across the\ngroups, and some of the needs were addressed by all groups\n(e.g., the need for a higher income), whereas other needs\nwere only expressed in a particular group. Because of the\nexploratory character of the research, we decided to report\nall of the needs in this article.\nResults Analysis\nThe Need for Transparency and Trust\nOne of the most striking needs discussed is the need for\ntransparency. The respondents said that they needed the gov-\nernment to be clear about what it expects from those who\nbelong to the precariat, how people can take care of them-\nselves without the support of the government, and what the\nparticipation society means besides cutting costs. A respon-\ndent who talked about the support of the government said,\nWe need the government. We cannot do everything by ourselves.\nWho is going to repair the asphalt [road], can you do it yourself?\nWho's going to pay the hospitals? . . . We pay [Taxes] for\neverything [but cannot realized by our self's].\nRespondent who talked about clarity said,\nBeing forced to take part in the \"participation society\" gives me\nthe feeling of cost cutting measures [because it is not clear way\nwe should participate] . . . Participation [society] is just a money\nissue.\nThe data show that it was not clear to the respondents\nwhat the reforms entail and why the responsibility for an\nincome and labor has been shifted to those who cannot find\nor hold a paid job. A respondent said,\nThe situation we are in now [without work in a participation\nsociety] is the result of bad government policy. What I hear is\nthat in a participation society, as citizen, I have not only to bear\nup the consequences of this policy [responsible for getting a job]\nbut also build-up this policy on my own without getting any\npenny [help] or getting something back for it.\nMost of the participants were skeptical about the transpar-\nency of the government; the results show widespread mis-\ntrust of the local government and politics in general. This\nmistrust is fed by the consequences of the regulations and the\nway the government checks up on those who receive social\nbenefits. The respondents said that they need a relationship\nwith the local government that is based on trust rather than\ndistrust. The new regulations were viewed by the respon-\ndentsasanindicationofdistrustratherthantrust.Furthermore,\nthe respondents'distrust of the government is fed by its strict\ndiscipline. The respondents experienced the strict discipline\nas a paralyzing force that causes counterproductive behavior\nregarding the participation society. A respondent who talked\nabout discipline and transparency said,\nIn the \"participatory society,\" the government appears to\nfunction on the basis of a business model based on money\nmaking, cost / benefit considerations . . . which again means\neven more control [policy]. It [policy/rules of the government]\nkills initiatives of citizens . . . initiatives aimed at meaningful/\nuseful work, that contribute to the neighborhood, are in conflict\nwith the government's vision.\nThe cutbacks in social benefits and the government's with-\ndrawal from public services in the Netherlands as a mean of\nreforming the welfare state into a \"participation society,\" in\nwhich the tasks and responsibilities are partly shifted to the\nmarket, society, and mainly the people themselves, seem to\nhave caused a lack of clarity. This made the role and the poli-\ncies of the government unclear to the respondents.\nThe Need for Help and Understanding\nThe respondents said that the local government does not know\nor understand their needs. They also said that governmental\nagencies are keener on applying inflexible rules than under-\nstanding their needs. Understanding would lead to a looser\ninterpretation of regulations. They emphasized that agencies\nshould turn a blind eye to some rules to make it possible for\npeople to become active rather than be paralyzed by regula-\ntions. This is necessary to give the precariat the opportunity to\nget out of the downward spiral they believe they are in. It was\nargued that the regulations and methods of enforcement pave\nthe way to the isolation of certain groups within the precariat.\nThere was, in general, a feeling that they (and their situation)\nwere not understood and could not make themselves under-\nstood, which gave them the feeling of powerlessness and alien-\nation. One of the participants who expressed a feeling of lack of\nunderstanding, frustration, powerlessness, and alienation\nregarding the government (politicians and politics)10 said,\nI intend to find a political party [because I'm not heard/\nunderstood] . . . I could be a member of or vote for the party, but\nit will do nothing for you now and it will do nothing for you in\nthe future [it will not listen to your needs when elected].\nThe respondents said that they need help from the govern-\nment to get out of socially and economically undesirable\nsituations. The need to solve the problems that cause the\nundesirable situations is considered by the respondents to be\na necessary condition to leaving the precariat. One of the par-\nticipants who wanted to be clear that help is needed to solve\nhis social situation to be able to look for a paid job, which\nwould probably get him out of his precarious situation, said,\nMy wife is very sick and she is no longer going to get better.\nNobody is going to care for her . . . Nobody will take care of her\n. . . I do everything that is needed. [That is the reason I'm not\nlooking for a paid job] . . . Yes, I have the feeling that I can do\neverything I want, but sometimes I do not know what to do.\nSometimes I want to go away from home, because it is very hard\n[to live in the situation I'm in].\nBallafkih et al. 7\nThe Need for a Higher and Stable Income\nThe participants stated that they need a higher income and\nmore tax benefits to make a \"normal\" living. The wages they\nreceive when performing paid work or the benefits they\nreceive from the state are considered insufficient to lead a\nnormal lifestyle. They also said that their wages are barely\nsufficient to pay their fixed expenses (rent, gas, water, elec-\ntricity, and health insurance). The need for a higher income\nwas driven by the desire to live without having to worry\nabout the basic necessities of life (e.g., food, clothes, and\nrent) and to also be able to afford to do things (e.g., visit an\namusement park) during their leisure time, to have a finan-\ncial buffer (to cover, for example, repairing home appliances\nor the car), and to save for the future (e.g., nest egg and\nretirement).\nThe respondents also needed a stable income. The income\nof respondents who had paid jobs depended mainly on the\nnumber of hours they worked. This caused fluctuations in\ntheir incomes, which gave them a feeling of insecurity since\nit is hard to plan a financial situation with a low and fluctuat-\ning income. They need stability to cope with daily expenses\nand thereby reduce their financial worries. One of the partici-\npants who made an argument about the need for a higher and\nmore stable income to be able to stop worrying about his\nfinancial situation, said,\nThe fixed income is important because we have a lot of expenses.\nEverything is expensive. With two children we cannot, for\nexample, go to the Efteling [an amusement park] during the\nschool holidays. A fixed income is needed to be sure that we\nhave security, and that we do not have to worry about them\n[expenses]. The amount we earn is never enough, but we have to\ncover our fixed costs plus a bonus to be able to do something\nduring leisure time and [save] for the future.\nThe Need for Realistic Job Demands and Equally\nDistributed Jobs\nThe participants also reported a need for more realistic job\ndemands. Employers demand more work experience and\nqualifications than are actually needed to cope with the jobs\nthey offer, according to the participants. These high demands\nreduce their likelihood of being hired since they have little to\nno experience or a lower qualification. Younger participants\nin particular said that they were not able to get jobs as they\nlacked work experience and that if they were not given\naccess to jobs, they were not likely to gain any experience in\nany one profession. This results in younger workers gaining\nfragmented work experience, which in the long run is likely\nto limit their labor market entry (see, for example, Standing,\n1999). A participant who talked about job demands said,\nEmployers want someone who is 17 years old, with several\nqualifications and a lot of work experience [not realistic]. A\ndecade ago this was not the case at all.\nBesides realistic demands, the participants also said that\nthey needed jobs that are equally distributed geographically\n(i.e., jobs that are not concentrated in one area) and that\nmatch their capabilities and needs. They argued that jobs that\nmatch their capabilities and needs are probably available\nsomewhere else in the Netherlands but not in the area in\nwhich they live. Applying for jobs in the surrounding areas\ninvolves costs (e.g., traveling expenses) and inconveniences\n(e.g., traveling time). This, in combination with a low\nincome, seems to prevent them from applying for jobs out-\nside the area they live in. A respondent said,\nThe problem is that there is not always work available in towns\npeople live in. [ . . . ]. The problem is that not all traveling\nexpenses are compensated. Some people have a lot of travel\nexpenses [high expense given the low income] that are not\ncompensated, so it is also not attractive [for people] to look for\nwork outside the home area [towns].\nThe Need for \"Real\" Jobs and Contracts\nThe participants stated their need for \"real\" labor contracts\nand jobs. A real contract offers a fixed and sufficient number\nof working hours to earn an adequate salary, according to the\nrespondents. Most of the respondents who received social\nbenefits said that they wanted a paid job but hesitated when\nreceiving an offer of a \"nonreal\" job. The local government\nhas several labor programs in which it offers jobs it considers\ngateways to real jobs. Those who receive social benefits\nmust participate in those programs or have their benefits cut.\nSacrificing the security of social benefits for a temporary job\n(e.g., a labor market reintegration job) causes insecurity and\nstress, because reapplying for social benefits takes time and\neffort. Temporary \"paid\" jobs are considered to be nonreal\njobs as they offer insufficient income (mostly equal to social\nbenefits) and insufficient career prospects and are, therefore,\nnot favored. It is, as one participant said, \"work for nothing.\"\nOne of the participants said that the jobs they get or have to\nperform are not \"real jobs\" in the sense that they only get a\nsmall reward compared with the social benefits:\nIn accordance with the social benefits office, since we all receive\nsocial benefits, we need to get started [attending the programme],\nbut we get very little money for it [to perform the job]. We work\nfor a packet of cigarettes. This means that we are not rewarded\nfor the work we do, so there is no motivation to do this work.\nThe Need for Equal Access\nThe participants need equal access to jobs with the same\namount of effort as those who are less likely to be discrimi-\nnated. There was a general feeling among both younger and\nolder respondents, but especially among younger immi-\ngrants, of not having equal opportunities to get a job. They\nface discrimination in the labor market when applying for\njobs. The feeling of unequal access and fewer opportunities\n8 SAGE Open\nseems to have discouraged most of the respondents from\napplying over and over again. One of the participants who\ndescribed the frustration and the inequality said,\nThere are many companies who only hire Dutch people instead\nof other people with a different background [such as immigrants].\nIf that changes, then we could find a job more easily.\nThe Need for Protection and Access to Good Jobs\nA group of participants who worked in the cleaning industry\nsaid that they felt exploited and needed more protection.\nTheir contracts, in their opinion, offer insufficient protection\nagainst exploitation. They said that they face work stress due\nto work tasks and the fear of having extra work hours cut.\nMost of them had part-time contracts because the employer\nhad not offered them full-time contracts. This, in combina-\ntion with a minimum wage, resulted in most participants,\nespecially those with only one household income, having\nseveral jobs. This increased the stress and reduced their lei-\nsure time (e.g., time lost during transitions). One of the par-\nticipants stated,\nI work in the hospital [doing housekeeping]. It is a part-time job,\nbesides my cleaning job [also part-time]. People [who work for\nthe cleaning company] work in different locations and different\njobs; sometimes they work here [the cleaning job on this\nlocation] for just two hours. We get a small contract [part-time\ncontract]. The employer spreads his risk. With these small\ncontracts we remain flexible [to the employer].\nThe respondents argued a need for access to good jobs.\nMost of the precarious workers, especially the immigrants,\nheld or were offered jobs that can be considered bad jobs\n(low income, low autonomy, hard work, low status).\nAccording to the participants, higher quality jobs are jobs\nthat offer pleasure, pay overtime and sick days,11 compensate\nfor seasonal work, and enable a good work\u00adlife balance. One\nof the participants, who saw how people in his immediate\nvicinity struggled a bad work\u00adlife balance in a low-quality\njob, said,\n[ . . . ] work also contributes to your happiness in life. Some\npeople are working so hard because they work for a minimum\nwage, they are almost completely wrecked. People return so\ntired to their homes that they almost cannot do anything after\nwork. Some people are so proud that they don't receive benefits.\nThat keeps them going: working. The toll they pay is high,\nbecause they wreck themselves. The work ethic of working hard\ndoes not always make you happy. People who are at the bottom\nsuffer heavily.\nEducational Needs\nOne of the needs the participants mentioned is the need for\neducation to develop themselves so that they can enter or\nre-enter the labor market, increase their labor market\nopportunities, increase their income, and improve their\ncareer prospects. The participants said that they wanted to\nlearn new skills, as well as update their skills and have\nthem certified, for example, by getting a diploma or certifi-\ncate for the work they have done (e.g., driving a forklift).\nMost of the participants performed activities, such as vol-\nuntary work, that contributed, in their opinion, to their\ndevelopment. They said that they believe that volunteer\nwork is necessary to build work experience and to learn the\nnew skills that employers are looking for. This is driven by\nthe need to build their resumes, as it is very important for\nresumes to be updated and upgraded. However, most of the\nparticipants, especially those belonging to minorities, face\ndifficulties getting an internship during their education.\nAmong the foreign participants, there was also a need for\nfree language education. They consider language lessons a\nnecessity to enable them to participate in the labor market to\nget out of the precariat. Language lessons are free of charge\nto those who receive social benefits but not to those who\nhave paid jobs, who, therefore, must pay for the training,\nwhich is a burden because most of them work for the mini-\nmum wage. One respondent said the following:\nWe need education. I'm obliged to take Dutch language lessons,\nand that is fine, but I have to pay for the lessons myself. We need\nfree education. I actually work for almost nothing [and thus\ncannot afford the lesson].\nThe need for free education concerns not only language\nlessons. Because of rising education costs, the participants,\nespecially the women, were concerned about the education\nof their children. They worried about the costs and the debts\ntheir spouses have to take on to be able to study and find\nmore labor market opportunities. One of the participants said\nthe following:\nIn the near future, children [from the precariat] who want to\nstudy will have a debt [to the government] of 50,000 euros after\ntheir study. In the near future, studying will only be affordable\nfor the elite and no longer for people who just have a low\nincome.\nSocial and Psychological Needs\nThe participants without paid jobs reported a need for social\ninteraction. Most of them were looking for work because they\nmissed social interaction. Paid work, in one respondent's\nopinion, gives them \"work power\" (strength from work), a\nroutine, a daily aim, access to social interaction, and sociabil-\nity. Some of the participants said that without work, they are\nbored, feel purposeless, and idle. Those with paid jobs noted\nthat they needed a good work\u00adlife balance, as most of them\nheld contracts that did not offer such a balance.\nIn one of the groups, a participant stated that psycho-\nlogical help is needed by those who lose their jobs, espe-\ncially those who have worked for several years. They said\nBallafkih et al. 9\nthat losing a job has serious psychological consequences\n(see, for example, Gallo, Bradley, Siegel, & Kasl, 2000).\nThe safety net should provide those who lose their jobs\nwith new aims and new social relations. One participant\ncommented on how losing a job had psychological\nconsequences:\nIt is also so depressing for the people who have become\nunemployed. Some people cannot handle the burden of\nunemployment, especially if they have always worked. Slowly,\nthey become depressed. And some people do crazy things\n[commit suicide]. Losing a job is depressing.\nThe Need for a Change in Discourse and\nRepresentation\nThe change to a participation society has changed the dis-\ncourse on citizens' reliance on the state. The discourse pro-\nmotes the idea that the precariat is sufficiently capable of\ngrasping opportunities that will lead to labor. The discourse\non the precariat's ability to fulfill its work- and labor-related\nneeds is based on false premises, according to the respon-\ndents. They said that the government has unrealistic (too\nmuch) faith in the abilities of the precariat to arrange its own\nlabor. The respondents said that a change in the discourse\nwill help to reframe the government's assumptions about the\nself-reliance of the precariat: therefore a need for a change in\nthe self-reliance discourse.\nMost of the participants also said that they need a positive\ndiscourse on unemployment and the receipt of social bene-\nfits. Their arguments revealed a feeling of inferiority that\nwas caused, in their opinion, by negative discourses. They\ngenerally felt that they were being disparaged by society, by\nthe tone of politicians, and by the way they were treated. In\nthe main, and especially in the populist discourse, people\nwho receive social benefits are portrayed as potential cheats,\nlazy citizens, and villains who take advantage of those who\nhave jobs. The precarious workers need the state and politi-\ncians to change this discourse:\nThe government aims for full employment as the standard [by\npromoting the participation in society and policy]; therefore\nthey [the authorities] are sending out a message that is related to\nthe work ethic. The ethic that you have to work otherwise you\nare piteous, or don't count [as a fully-fledged citizen] [ . . . ] That\nis the label that people [who don't have a job] get.\nAlong with the need for a change in the discourse, the\nrespondents also said that they need to be represented by the\ngovernment. Especially those who are not likely to find a\npaid job have a higher need for government representation.\nThis involves taking action with regard to the labor market\nby, for example, stimulating employers to hire people from\nthe precariat. The government, in their opinion, should repre-\nsent the precariat in the labor market by arranging and pro-\ntecting the precariat's interests.\nConclusion and Discussion\nThis exploratory research revealed a range of needs that are\nrelated to labor. Several needs are associated with the desire\nto have a sufficient and stable income to live an untroubled\nlife. The precariat needs an adequate salary from labor, full\nemployment according to one's means and needs, equal\naccess to jobs, equal distribution of jobs, and availability of\nsuitable jobs of acceptable quality. It also needs protection\nagainst exploitation (e.g., unsociable hours, insufficient\nhours to accomplish work tasks, and unpaid overtime) and\nshort-term \"empty\" contracts that do not offer any prospect\nof a career, a higher income, or personal growth.\nMost of the needs, including those regarding labor,\nincome, and education, are considered the responsibility of\nthe government. The emphasized needs contradict, to a cer-\ntain extent, the shift the Dutch government is aiming for:\nmore individual responsibilities and fewer responsibilities\nfor the government. The needs of the precariat show that the\nnew roles and responsibilities are not clear to them; in addi-\ntion, the government is blamed for not fulfilling several\nneeds. The precariat does not seem to consider that other\ninstitutions, for example, trade unions (see also Park, 2016),\ncould help them to satisfy some of their needs (e.g., the need\nfor protection, access to jobs, and representation).\nThe needs of precarious workers show that they are not\nable to create their own social and financial safety nets.\nThey do not seem to have the power to change their posi-\ntion toward employers and the government, that is, to\nchange the new relationship. Their needs also show that the\nprecariat is mentally insecure, stressed, un- and over-\nemployed, alienated, and motivated by fear (see also, for\nexample, Standing, 2011). Their needs point toward a com-\nplex role of the government: the role of facilitator and\nmediator at both the individual and the collective levels.\nThe mismatch of expectations, the strict enforcement of\nrules, and the shifting responsibilities seem to increase the\ndistrust and alienation of the precariat. This bolsters the\nargument of Standing (1999) that the precariat distrusts the\ngovernment and is alienated from society.\nThe respondents emphasized several manifest needs,\nalthough most of the needs are not directly related to labor.\nThe needs of the precariat and precarious workers are not the\nsame as the needs of people who do not belong to the pre-\ncariat (see, for example, Jahoda, 1982). However, some of\nthe needs of the precariat show similarities with the latent\nconsequences of unemployment described by Jahoda (1982).\nThe needs of the precariat clearly indicate that they particu-\nlarly lack the social and psychological consequences that are\nrelated to employment. These consequences are evident in\nthe needs for social and psychological help, a higher and\nstable income, \"real\" jobs and contracts, protection, and\naccess to good jobs. The needs of the precariat are unique in\nthat they involve more than the social and psychological con-\nsequences of unemployment described by Jahoda. The needs\nshow the economic (e.g., sufficient income), political (e.g.,\ntrust in the government), and institutional (e.g., unrepre-\nsented by nongovernmental institutions like the unions) con-\nsequences of belonging to the precariat. These consequences\nare clearly displayed in the need for change in the discourse,\ntransparency of the government, and the need for political\nrepresentation. Furthermore, the needs of the precariat are\nimbued with attempts to find an untroubled way of living.\nMost of the needs are related to escaping the poverty trap\nrather than the unemployment trap.\nThe needs show that political measures to reduce the pre-\ncariat as a social class must be tailored to the people in a\nparticular area (e.g., free language lessons in areas with a\nhigh density of immigrants or more jobs in areas blighted by\nstructural unemployment). The needs also show that mea-\nsures such as promoting self-employment, creating tempo-\nrary, steppingstone, and work-reintegration jobs are likely to\nbe insufficient, because these measures solve only a marginal\npart of the needs: these measures are mainly aimed at fulfill-\ning only one need. Furthermore, the social, psychological\nand economic related needs of those in the precariat are not\nlikely to be solved with a one-size-fits-all policy.\nAlthough employers are held accountable for some of the\nneeds, the precariat believes that the government should\nforce employers to change their employment policies through\nlabor market policies that are based on the needs of the pre-\ncariat. The propagated \"participatory society\" with its labor\nmarket flexibility and self-reliance could be improved by\nincorporating social and economic aimed needs into policies.\nThis will improve the flexibility of the modern labor market.\nBy protecting (e.g., rights, including workplace rights based\non the needs) and empowering (e.g., through free education\nto make them less vulnerable) them it is less likely that they\nwill be trapped in to precarity; they also will benefit from the\nflexibility. The governments need to satisfy the needs of the\nprecariat by supporting and investing in the needs.\nThe Dutch flexicurity model, however, mainly concerns\nthe flexibility of labor and the prevention of unemployment.\nGiven the needs, it can be argued that the current model\naccounts only marginally for the conditions and conse-\nquences of flexicurity. A pluralistic risk management strat-\negy in which responsibilities for all labor market groups are\nshared by government and social partners is needed to\nimprove the model, and thereby the conditions and conse-\nquences for the precariat who need new forms of security\n(see also Van Berkel & Van der Aa, 2015). In this strategy,\nunions are the most obvious social partner to defend the\nrights of the precariat in the broad sense (see also, for exam-\nple, Thornley, Jefferys, & Appay, 2010).\nDespite the effort of unions to reduce precarious work, and\nso precarity, the steady rise of such types of employment rela-\ntions shows that the union have not succeeded in curbing the\ntrend (Keune, 2013) by mainly represent and defend mainly\nthe interests of their members. They are not reaching those in\ninsecure work, including those who need representation and\nlocked into a more traditional model of supporting only the\norganized workforce. Given needs such as protection (e.g., the\nright to a sufficient living wage, degrading treatment, and pro-\ntection against unemployment) and representation (e.g., sup-\nport human and workplace rights despite the political discourse\nand climate), the unions also have a role to play in the improve-\nment of workplace right. As argued by Keune (2015), they\nalso need to oppose the existing system, represent, and protect\nthe interest of a society at large, foremost the weaker groups\nsuch as the precariat even if they are not a member of a union.\nLimitations and Suggestions for Further Research\nThis exploratory research was conducted in an urban area.\nThe findings indicate that the needs of the precariat are\naffected by the area they live in. To a certain extent, this lim-\nits the findings of this research. Research in different areas\nand in countries with higher and lower unemployment and\npoverty rates and different local government approaches\ncould improve on the findings reported in this article.\nThe drawback to making the focus groups accessible and\nfree of obligations was that several participants turned up\nlate and/or left the meetings early. Using the findings of this\narticle as a starting point could improve our understanding of\ntheir labor-related needs.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This\nproject is partly financed by the Department of Participation,\nLabour and Income of the Municipality of Amsterdam.\nNotes\n 1. To our knowledge, there are no general or European definitions\nof precarious workers. There are, however, several definitions\nof precarious workers that are based on empirical or norma-\ntive standards. There are, for several reasons (Frade et al.,\n2004), cross-national differences in the meaning of precarious\n 2. The \"working class\" is a term that has dominated the socio-\nlogical debate on labor (see, for example, Wright, 2002). This\nclassification has become too ambiguous--if it has ever been\nunambiguous--to describe labor-related classes nowadays.\nThe ambiguity can be attributed to the fading of categories in\nwhich people are less likely to be attributed to one of the exist-\ning classes.\n 3. An unbalanced labor contract is a contract in which the power\nis not equally distributed; in the worst case, it is a destructive\ncontract.\n 4. Unemployment is a state that many of the precarious workers\nenter and leave during their working lives.\n 5. The basic human needs are comparable to fundamental human\nrights.\n7. Because social security and labor market systems are com-\nplex, we only give a brief overview of the most recent changes\nand changes that have a high impact on the existence of the\nprecariat.\n 8. Performing paid labor according to one's ability.\n9. See OECD Employment Outlook 2014 at http://www.oecd.\norg/netherlands/EMO-NLD-EN.pdf\n10. The respondents tended to lump together politics, politicians,\ngovernment, and governmental agencies. During the focus\ngroups, we mostly talked about the local government since\nthe respondents have to deal with several local government\nagencies.\n11.
