In 1920s, matriliny was referred to as \"un-\nIslamic\" in the discourses of the courts, reform movements,\nand Mappila youngsters who received Western education.\nThese discourses on family practices emerged from\nmultiple sites like the court, the state, and orientalist texts. It\nwas also the time when ideas proliferated in Malabar\nthough print media. Books in English and Arabic were\ntranslated into vernacular after the advent of the print\ntechnology in South India. Christian missionaries as well as\nlocal Islamic scholars invariably engaged with their content.\nHence, in the context of Malabar, we will see that there was\nan advent of new forms of \"religious truth.\" With reference\nto Islam, there were new discussions on existing practices.\nThey always referred back to the contents of certain\nreligious texts (Razak, 2007). However, what one can see in\nMalabar is how in response to these debates matrilineal\nMappila Muslims negotiated with any unilateral\nconstruction of \"Islam.\" At that particular time, matrilineal\npractices were very widespread among Muslims, especially\namong cosmopolitan Muslims of coastal areas of the Indian\nOcean. In response to the emerging debates, they tried to\n\"re-articulate\" the matrilineal customs in the idioms of\n\"correct\" ways of practicing Islam. This was to retain the\nbasic structure of matrilineal customs. For this purpose,\nthey modified many aspects of gender relations and equally\nnegotiated with religious practices that were in coming to\nbe in vogue those days. They also attempted to read many\nof their customary practices in new ways to negotiate with\nidioms of patriarchy and textuality. Yet, the gender\nrelations underwent a shift. This article looks how \"re-\narticulation of matriliny\" resulted in the loss of power, and\nauthority for Mappila women in first decades of 20th\ncentury in the coastal regions of Malabar.\nMatriliny Among Muslims in Malabar,\nKerala\nFirst, let us briefly discuss on the matrilineal practices\namong Muslims in Malabar. The nomenclature \"Mappila\"\nin general is used for Muslims of Malabar, Kerala (Koya\n2004).1 Initially, it was used to denote a community born\nthrough the encounter between Arab merchants in the\nIndian Ocean and the local people. These Arab traders\ndominated the merchantile activity in the Indian Ocean\nbefore they lost out with the Dutch colonial endeavors\n(Pearson, 2003). During the colonial time, the term became\nassociated with the local people. Then onward, the term\n\"Mappila\" denotes a broader community consisting of\nvarious heterogeneous populations that practice Islam. The\norganization of family, kinship systems, and customs of\ninheritance are different among Mappilas to such an extent\nthat Mappilas of interior southern Malabar follow\npatrilineal kinship, whereas their Mappilas in the coastal\nregions ranging from South Malabar to North Malabar, and\nSouth Canara predominantly followed matrilineal descent\nand inheritance or marumakkathayam (D'souza, 1978;\nAbdurahiman 2004).2 These differences in practices can be\nunderstood in context of different phases of conversion to\nIslam. Our focus is on the matrilineal Muslims of Malabar\nwho converted to Islam with the influence of Arab trading\nmerchants in the Indian Ocean. The similarities between of\nMuslim customs and the Nayar matrilineal practices are\nstrikingly similar in term of kinship terms, and practices.\nBehind this, there is a history of conversion, political\ndynamics within small kingdoms, and trade in the Indian\nocean.\nMatriliny among Mappilas (henceforth, Mappila\nmatriliny) is specific in their practice of matriliny and\nmatrilocality. Matriliny implied that relationships were\ntraced through the mother, and inheritance is traced through\nwomen; while men of the household had rights to a share of\nthe family property only while living in it (cf. Arunima,\n2003). Matrilocality implies that puthiyapla (husband)\nwould visit a Mappila woman at night, in similar way to the\npractice in Lakshadweeps (Dube, 1969), or he would visit\nher at day time or night in her ara (bridal chamber) without\nThe fourth decade of the 20th century witnessed a great\nchurning in the history of matriliny in general, which is the\nfocus of our discussion. There were simultaneous changes in\nthe normative concept of family in the ambit of the court, and\nin the minds of educated elites who were at the helm of\nsocio-religious reform efforts. A shared norm was established\nas the \"correct\" and the \"true\" practice. The norm solidified\nto become normative. The norm influenced the empirical\npractices and led to structural changes. They set up what can\nbe called in Durkheim's (1964) terms as \"dogmas.\"\nTo understand matrilineal customs, let us begin with\nthe discussion of the institution of tharavadu or\nmatrilineal joint family. A tharavadu consists of\nindividuals who claim descent from a common female\nancestor. This entity in 20th century consisted of a female,\nher children, and her daughter's children. Mappila\ntharavadus functioned as an exogamous community held\ntogether by the relations of real or fictive kinship.\nMembers are related to each other through two ties called\nmudhalsambandham and pulasambandham ties.\nPulasambandham implied the observance of common\nrituals at the event of birth and death. The kin bound\nthrough pulasambandham are called attaladakkam heirs or\nthe heirs who inherit the property at last in the absence of\nimmediate female heirs. Mudhalsambandham implied\ncommon rights over property; and that consists of the\nkindred community. First, women were central to the\ninheritance in matrilineal families; and they did not sever\ntheir affective and economic ties with their natal homes.\nSecond, children irrespective of sex belonged to the\nmother's joint family. Third, women inherited the\nKottakkunnummal 3\nAs told in the beginning, there was a re-definition of\ntharavadu authority in terms of gender and generation by\nArunima (2003) in the case of Nayars, tharavadu became a\ncorporate and impartible structure among Muslims as well.\nWomen's importance and active role in the various ways of\nsocial reproduction, like in rituals, customary exchange of\ncooked food between families, and the management of the\ntharavadu was reduced to their role of sexual reproduction\nbecame the preserve of the karanavan--the male head of\nwhat Arunima (2003) called \"a corporate unit\" with\nimpartible property by early 20th century, it discredited the\nindividual properties of women. In the case of the Nayars,\nindividual properties of the women were mainly the land set\naside by lovers or husband for their maintenance and\nDisputes Over Land and Judicial\nInterventions in the Late 19th Century\nWe will discuss the Mappila Succession Act of 1918 and\nlook at the ways in which intervention of the judiciary had a\nstrong impact on marumakkathayam practices, especially to\nthose properties owned separately or exclusively by\nwomen. Before going into some of the court decisions of\nproperty, I will give a description of the ways in which\ncourt dealt with a late 20th century invention for the\ntransfer of property among matrilineal communities. It is\ncalled transfer by \"will.\" The majority of the property\namong matrilineal Muslims was joint family property. Both\nmen and women had right over the property and also for\nmaintenance out of that in their lifetime; while women only\ninherited the property. However, individuals could acquire\nprivate property of their own. Initial years women received\nlanded property as gifts to be owned individually at the time\nof marriage. Later, men increasingly started to acquire\nlanded individual property. Resultantly, the dissolution of\nthe individual property became a matter of dispute.\nAccording to the logic of matrilineal customs, the self-\nacquired property also reverted to the matrilineal joint\nproperty in the case of men being the owner, and to the\nbranch of the joint family in the case of women after their\ndeath; and nobody could alienate the property by sale, gift,\nto transfer the ownership of property to their children and\nwife after their death. One of the mechanisms for this was\ncarried out by employing the will.\nThe will implied the gifting of the property during the\nowner's lifetime. Malabar Wills Act of 1898 enabled\nindividuals following matriliny to gift their property by way\nof the will according to their wish (Kumari, 2003). The\nlegal back-up for the execution of the will was provided by\nthe Malabar Wills Act of 1898. It was general law for\nHindus as well as for Muslims. The history of \"will\" shows\nthe coming into being of the concept of self-acquired\nproperty.\nThis in itself could have carried the seeds for the demand\nfor a law which enabled the dissolution of the property to\nspouse and children (both male and female) of the owner\nleading to a threat to the integration of the joint family.\nHowever, the law per se did not cause a total ruin of the\njoint family, because the gifted property was mainly used\nfor the formation of a new branch of matrilineal family\nconsisting of mother and her children. Yet, the increase in\nprivate property gradually set up the male authority,\nespecially of the father. Colonial court failed to resolve the\ndisputes between male and female children. Over time, one\ncould see that the precepts of Anglo-Muhammadan law\ngaining momentum against the customary practices of\nmatriliny. While the lower courts recognized the custom in\nthe judgments, the higher court had an easy resort in the\ncodified Anglo-Muhammadan law. The court had an\nabstract idea of the \"correct\" Islamic familial practice. The\nnormative ideal of Anglo-Muhammadan law led to the\nlegislation of the Mappila Succession Act in 1918 (Kumari,\nLet us discuss some examples that demonstrate the\nambiguity that surfaced in the courts, and reveals the\ninterface of Anglo-Muhammadan law with matrilineal\ncustomary norms in the late 19th century. In Pathumma\nversus Abdulla Haji case, a patrilineal Mappila made a gift\nto his wife. The wording of the will ensured that wife held\nthe property in the same way as he held it. Court ruled that\nthe property gifted would take the incidents of tharavadu\nproperty and not as the private property of those who\nrepeated in Kunchacha versus Kutti Maami Hajee case in\nsecond husband of a matrilineal woman gave some property\nto her and his children by her. Husband wanted his children\nand wife to form a tavazhi (branch of tharavadu), so as to\nexclude children from the first husband. In the first\ninstance, the court agreed to this deed.4 However, in a\nsubsequent period, court held on Pathumma versus Abdulla\nHaji case that a gift of the property to mother and children\ndoes not enable mother and her children to form a separate\nthavazhi.5 Moreover, the court held that she could not\nestablish a tavazhi by excluding some of her children, to the\ninclusion of some; also that in the case of such a gift, the\nreceivers would become only as tenants in common and\neach have absolute rights equal to private property. Court\nstated that tavazhi or tharavadu as \"corporate unit\" could\nIn another case, court held that gift by complete transfer of\nproperty would become puthravakasam property or the\nproperty gifted by the husband to the wife.\nThe tharavadu as a \"corporate unit\" meant that it was\ntreated as a corporate, impartible, co-residential and\nproperty owning structure that rendered the tharavadu into\na manageable and cohesive unit. Puthravakasam is a kind\n4 SAGE Open\nof property that a man gives a tavazhi (branch) consisting of\nwife and children held jointly according to\nhusband's grant of property leads to the establishment of a\nsub-branch. It is beyond doubt that there was a rule against\ncompulsory partition of the property and hence formation of\nsub-branches was common. These judgments show shift in\nthe attitude of colonial courts toward joint family and how\nvarious branches were formed leading to the disintegration\nof joint family. The disintegration into branches\nconstituting a unit with wife and children followed the logic\nmatrilineal kinship, but it established the role of the\nhusband and his private property. They also illustrate the\ndisturbance in the early custom by which tharavadu\nappropriated the private properties of men and women as\ncommon property. The changes in the customs thus\nestablished the authority of the father; he then had a great\ninfluence in the determination of the structure of matrilineal\nfamily. The court, due to its lack of knowledge of\ncustomary rules, failed to understand and resolve the\ndisputes.\nTo elaborate on the ways in which the court dealt with\nthe category of \"gifted property\" in legal disputes, and it led\nto the ruin of female rights more specifically, I will discuss\nthe case of Sthrisothu tharavadus or families of exclusive\nfemale collective ownership and management of the\nproperty. Some Mappila tharavadus were strisothu\ntharavadus. The strisothu tharavadu have the eldest female\nmember as the karanavathi (head) of the tharavadu. The\nfemale members exclusively own and manage the property.\nMale members, however, had only the right to avail\nexpenses for maintenance. In other words, though both\nmale and female members have equal rights over property,\nthe later have exclusive rights of management over the\nIn a dispute over what is called as the strisothu nature of\nproperty, court held that a deed granted to the female\ndescendants alone could not find acceptance. In this\ninstance, a matrilineal man executed a deed of gift in favor\nof his wife and three daughters under which they and their\nfemale descendants could enjoy the properties hereditarily,\nto the exclusion of males. Subsequently, the last surviving\ndaughter made a gift of the properties to her own female\ndescendants; and the gift was objected by the other female\nmembers of the line through a suit as she excluded male\nmembers. The court held that the exclusion of males was\ninvalid. The observation was that the property does not vest\nwith wife and daughters as joint tenants. The court added\nthat the property have the incidents of tharavadu property,\nbecause males have the right of survivorship over\ntharavadu property, and they cannot be excluded from\nvalidated the above-mentioned practices of customs and\nheld that the descendants of the property to the female line,\nexcluding males and prohibiting partition, belongs to the\nclass of gifts known as strisothu or henumule and the\nintention of such a gift is to pass the property to a class of\nHowever, in a later dispute of the same nature, court held\nthat the institution of strisothu tharavadu is \"unknown\" to\nstrisothu became a non-existent institution by the third\ndecade of the 20th century. Even in the above-mentioned\nvariety of the matrilineal families, the male and female\nmembers got equal rights in erstwhile strisothu tharavadus.\nThere was, however, an exception that only the eldest\nfemale member had the right to manage the tharavadu, as\nMappila tharavadus in Malabar, such a right is reserved to\nfemales by a family karar signed by all the adult members\nof the tharavadu.6 Ali (1933) argues that the shifts in\nstrisothu explain the harmful intervention of judiciary to the\ncustomary practices of Mappilas. Strisothu did not\ncontradict customary law of Malabar. Yet, court intervened\nin the practices and invented new customs. According to\nthis institution, the eldest female had greatest authority and\nrights whereas male had only right to maintenance (Ali,\nIn this way, the court was one of sites from which\ndiscourse on a correct familial practice could proliferate.\nThe court, a secular institution, shared the similar notion of\nideal family and inheritance along with religious\ninterlocutors in that era. The court could not accept the fact\nthat Mappila women could exclusively hold property. For\nthe court as well as for educated modern Mappilas, the\ncustoms posed a threat. Matriliny existed in the zone in\nwhich everything \"dangerous\" of the \"impure\" past existed.\nAs shown in the case of strisothu taravadus, the judiciary\nadhered to an abstract idea of what constituted natural sex\nroles in the legal framework of Islam. The colonial state\nconstructed Hindus and Muslims as distinct and attempted\nto employ different legal procedures. The underlying\nassumptions were provided by the orientalist scholarship.7\nBy early 20th century, there could be no individual\nproperty and the entire earnings belong to tharavadu by\ncustom in matrilineal law. Yet, self-acquired properties\nother than tharavadu property were increasingly acquired by\nthe individuals. In customary marumakkathayam practice,\nespecially in North Malabar, the self-acquired property\ndevolved on to the tharavadu in the case of male. In the\ncase of female die without making a will, it goes to the\ntavazhi. It would contribute and additional income to the\npractice in a large majority of cases in the two northern\ntaluks of Chirakkal and Kottayam. And it was similar in\nplaces like Badagara and Quilandy, also in North Malabar.\nThere was no uniformity in the norms of succession in the\ninteriors of North Malabar where Mappilas were minority:\nwhile some families followed marumakkathayam custom\nthe other followed Muhammadan law (van der Veer, 1996,\np. 94). However, in South Malabar and Lakshadweep\nislands, there was dual system of inheritance. The private\nKottakkunnummal 5\nproperty of member of the tharavadu devolved according to\nthe Sharia line of inheritance. In Lakshadweep, private\nproperty is tingazhcha swoth or Monday property that\ndifferentiated from tharavadu property with the term Friday\nthinklazhcha property is divided according to the customary\nSharia law, while Friday property is impartible\nAs seen above, in the case of strisothu family property,\nthe courts had considerable ambiguity regarding the\nresolution of Mappila disputes. Lewis Moore (1905), who\ndealt with the laws governing inheritance by the Mappilas\nobserved that those who follow marumakkathayam treated\nthe \"self-acquisition\" of a man as transferred to his wife\nand children under the Muhammadan law in patrilineal\nline (pp. 323-351). He also held that it was not unusual for\na father and sons to have community of property and the\nproperty to be managed by the father, and after his death,\nthe eldest son. It can be argued that, this perception of\nallowing the Muhammadan law for inheritance was a\nproduct of longstanding debate. In 1851, the custom of\n\"double inheritance\" went before the consideration of the\nPrivy Council. The council judged that it was not\nsufficiently established.8 In 1855, a sudder court\nquestioned the prevalence of two laws of inheritance\nprevailing in the same family and in 1861, Tellicherry\njudge showed dissatisfaction over this law; he described it\nStill two decisions in 1880 sanctioned the existence of\nboth forms of laws of inheritance in one family. In a case\nin 1880, the issue was that a women belonging to a family\ngoverned by a marumakkathayam law had married to a\nman belonging to family governed by Muhammadan law;\nand after his wife's death, the husband declined to return\nthe property given to his wife on the occasion of her\nlower court decided that the property to revert to\ntharavadu and it therefore become unnecessary to divide\nit; it would have come under Muhammadan law if the\nproperty had been the self-acquisition of the wife\n(Wigram, 1882). These developments are exemplary of\nthe transformations and continuities happened in\nmatriliny.\nTransformations in the Structure of the\nMatrilineal Joint Family\nGough (1961) in her ethnography on Mappilas observed\nthat there happened what was called \"modern disintegration\nof matrilineal descent groups.\" She observed that long-term\nstructural changes in the economy induced by the British\ngovernment led to the changes in the pattern of matrilineal\nkinship. There were changes in technology and\ncommunication; and introduction of cash cropping.\nArunima (2003) in her study of the Nayar matriliny in\nMalabar observes the varying reasons ranging from the\nlegal re-definition of the family by the colonial court and\nthe state, to economic and ideological pressure in Malabar\nduring that period. She also underlines the interplay\nbetween colonial land revenue policies and legal measures,\nand cultural adaptation in response to colonial modernity in\nthe context of structural changes in the production relations.\nVijayakumar (2006) in the context of the transformation of\nMuslims matrilineal customs in Lakshadweep islands,\nIndia, argues that the interplay between the implanting of\nmainland law in the island, establishment of legal\ninstitutions, land reforms, and the emergence of the new\nideas of religious practices in the post-independent period,\nalong with the economic transformations lead to the\nchanges in customary law. In the case of Muslim matriliny\nin Minangkabau, Indonesia, Abdullah (1985) looks at the\nways which in the legalistic textual interpretations of Islam\ncontradicted adat (customary practices) from 19th century\nonward. He describes the ways in which the society\nattempted to re-examine the inherent greatness of adat law\nand to strengthen the validity of adat as a system of\nconduct. He calls this process \"Islamization\" to refer to the\nsituation in which the customs were defended by the\npractitioners, but the meaning of the practices underwent a\nshift. Holy (1996) observes that disintegration in matrilineal\ngroups starts with the tendency for matrilineal groups to\nbreakdown to small groups composed of uterine siblings\nand their immediate descents in the female line. He further\npostulates that the changes in matriliny account for the\nchange in the descent, changes in the conceptualization of\nthe descent, and changes in the ways of the transmission of\nthe property.\nWith reference to the transformation of Muslim\nmatriliny in Colonial Malabar, we will look at the interplay\nbetween the economic factors, ideological factors, legal\nmeasures, and the state policies in the realm of the Muslim\nfamily. As mentioned above, there were transformations in\nthe ownership of land among matrilineal Muslims. Advent\nof individual ownership of land, along with the\ntransformation in the hitherto existing modes of landholding\nby the tharavadu was visible.9 The interests over the\ncollective land of the matrilineal joint family were\nexpressed through an attack on the matrilineal practices\nwith religious undertone saying that it was \"un-Islamic\" in\nnature. Young junior members were at the forefront of the\ncampaign against matriliny. The reference point for the\ndemand for legislations for the transformation of the\nownership of land was the Anglo-Muhammadan law and\nthe ideological attack on Nayar matrilineal customs by the\ncaste-reform movements in Kerala. Anglo-Muhammadan\nlaw was the Islamic legal system formed in British India in\nthe 19th century. The law adapted the Sharia law into the\nframe of modern English jurisprudence. Sayed Rashid\nargues that the British courts relied upon the legal texts of\nthe distant past for the purpose of authentication, and also\nthat they ignored contemporary interpretations. Thus, the\n6 SAGE Open\nlaw was codified as a conservative law and rigid set of rules\nIn fact, various discursive practices happened during the\ndebates that contributed to the transformations in\nmatrilineal family. There were rise of nationalist\nsentiments, dissemination of colonial governance and\npower and the rise of the abstract idea of the \"individual.\"\nThese historical happenings presented Malabar with a new\nspatial, and political imagination. Yet, the most out-\nstanding and overt discourse on Mappila matriliny\nhappened with reference to religion: From the beginning of\n20th century, there was a sensibility that matriliny was \"un-\nIslamic\" by nature. This peculiar form of religious\nimagination, at least by the first half of the 20th century\ngained similarities of Islamic imagination in North India in\nterms of its quest for a political identity based on a notion\nof the ummah, a religious notion that has acquired a\nthis period, matrilineal tharavadu was a site of power, and a\nrealm of negotiations between men and women.\nThe relationship between matriliny and Islam lingered in\nthe limbo of ambiguity in the worldview of young Mappilas\nfrom 1910 onward. They wanted to locate the system with\nreference to what they understood as \"correct\" practices of\nIslam. Hence, one of the central ideological motivation\nbehind the legislation was to abolish matrilineal customs\nand bring in the \"correct Islamic practices.\" The demand\nalso enhanced effort toward community formation based on\nreligious and political identity among Muslims in Malabar\n(cf. Menon 2002). Now, we will look at the transformations\nin the meaning of religion among Muslims.\nAdvent of New Debates on Islam in\nMalabar\nAn idea of \"true Islam\" emerged in Malabar by the 20th\ncentury. The debates on Islamic practices and traditions\ninvariably informed the texts during the period. The abstract\nideas of religious truth became pertinent in the realm of the\nfamily; and the discussions on family were simultaneous\nwith the spread of Anglo-Muhammadan law as legal code.\nOne of the early instances of the expression of the idea of\n\"true\" Islamic practice can be found in the Colonial reports\nand narratives. C. A. Innes (1908), the author of Madras\nDistrict Gazetteers observed that Mappilas engage in\nheretic and corrupt practices, though he felt that they were\n\"strong\" observers of the religion. He observes that they\nengaged in witchcraft despite \"Quranic condemnation\";\n\"canonize\" Tangals (spiritual leaders or Sufis mainly\nconsist of Arab geneaology) and make shrines on their\ntombs (called as Meukham, Jaram). He also observes that\nthe Mappila notion of jins and shaitans (evil powers)\ncorrespond to the Hindu demons and were propitiated in the\nsame way; Mappilas use wooden figures in magic; and also\nbelieve in the evil eye and its bad effects (Innes, 1908, p.\n196); and the principal social ceremonies have similarities\nwith Hindu rituals. He draws shared cultural practices of\nMappilas as borrowings from Hindus, mainly those of\nlower castes' ritual tying of tali (symbol of marriage), use\nof music, tom-toms, and exchange of betals (tobacco) in\nceremonies. However, he also adds that there were certain\n\"orthodox sections\" who refrain from all these things\n(Innes, 1908). Barring the reference to Catholic beliefs like\n\"canonization,\" the author attributes the causality of\nadulteration to the acceptance of Hindu customs in the\ncultural fabric of Islam, and he is also harping on an\nabstract idea of \"the correct Islam.\"\nThis perspective or view has to be seen as a product\norientalist scholarship on Islam (van der Veer, 1996, p. 51).\nThere was a protestantization and therefore a greater\nsignificance given to the text after the emergence of\ntranslation and religious writings in the print and a\nsubsequent assimilation of these dialogues for the\narticulation of the daily life practices (van der Veer, 1996,\np. 220). \"The truth\" lied in the text; believers have to study\nreligious texts to lead a proper moral and spiritual life (van\nunderstanding of Islam is useful for the analysis of the\ninterface between Islam, matriliny, and gender relations\namong the Mappilas in Malabar. Talal Asad propounds the\nidea of Islam as \"a discursive tradition.\" The discursive\nnature of Islam means that every where Islam is concerned\nwith defining what is allowable (halal) and what is not\npractice of religion according to him incorporates the\nqualities of the specific events of speaking, commenting,\nand reflecting on the texts (Asad, 1986, p. 7). In a historical\ncontext, there can be divergent ways of talking about\nreligion. In the context of Malabar, one has to look at the\ninterplay between law, oriental texts, vernacular print,\npublic debates, socio-religious and caste reforms, public\nspeeches, songs, and transformation in the economy and the\ndevelopment of state apparatus to look at the articulations\nof Islam.\nThe new reading of the Islamic texts in the light of\ncolonial modernity set up new norms for the authentication\nof religious belief and familial norms among Mappilas in\nMalabar. Thus, power becomes central in the understanding\nof the construction of religious piety and moral practices. In\nthe coming sections, we will discuss the re-articulation of\nthe Mappila matrilineal customs with reference to the\nAnglo-Muhammadan law and the abstract idea of \"the\ncorrect Islam.\"\nEncounter Between Muslim Matrilineal\nCustoms and Anglo-Muhammadan Law\nNow, we will look at the social life of the encounter\nbetween Muslim matrilineal customs and the Anglo-\nMuhammadan law. We will focus on the event of the\nKottakkunnummal 7\nlegislation of Mappila Succession Act and the social\ndynamics around the passage of the Act. One of the central\nconcerns of junior members of the matrilineal joint family,\nwho were in the forefront demanding legislation, was the\nrights over property. They wanted to pass their self-\nacquired property, which was a separate from the joint\nfamily property to their spouse and children. As mentioned\nabove, in the beginning of the 20th century, even the self-\nacquired property of individuals reverted to their matrilineal\nproperty after their death; and thus became the part of the\ncollective property. Young men had interest in acquiring the\njoint family property being a junior member and his wife's\nproperty as the husband.\nThe first eruption of the demand for the abolition of\nMappila matrilineal customs of inheritance was with respect\nto the conceptualization of the succession of the collectively\nowned property by matrilineal joint family or tharavadu.\nAccording to Anglo-Muhammadan law, there is no joint\nfamily; thus, it was held that there was no provision for the\nexistence of matrilineal joint family property.10 As a result,\nthere was a worry about the mismatch between the\n\"Islamic\" notion of the inheritance of property and the\nexistence of tharavadu property. Young, educated Mappilas\nwanted bringing matrilineal inheritance in \"accordance with\nthe spirit and teaching of Islam\" to resolve this mismatch.\nThe second demand for abolition was explicitly in\nresponse to the newly emerged demand for the changes in\nthe customary rules regarding the inheritance of privately\nowned land according to the provisions of the Anglo-\nMuhammadan law. Anglo-Muhammadan law recognized\nindividual property, while in matrilineal customs, the\nindividually owned property reverted to the tharavadu after\nthe death of the individual. In response to this, there was\ngrowing demand for a legislation of an Act that legally set\nup the Anglo-Muhammadan law of inheritance over\ncustomary matrilineal customs. The Mappila Succession\nAct was passed in the year of 1918. The Act marked a shift\nin the conceptualization of inheritance of the property of\nmatrilineal Mappilas. The inheritance was conceptualized in\naccordance with Anglo-Muhammadan law.\nMappilas Succession Act was enacted in the year of\n1918. The central focus of the Act was a provision for the\ninheritance of self-acquired property by the provisions of\nAnglo-Muhammadan law. Muhammadan law enabled a\nMuslim to succeed, to gift, and to own individual property.\nThe Succession Act of 1918 brought those properties of\nwhich a Mappila who follow marumakkathayam or\naliyasanthanam law, and has not made any testamentary\ndisposition to devolve upon his heirs in the order and\naccording to the rules of Muhammadan law even if he dies\nwithout making a clear will.\nNow, we will look at the social life of the debates on\nmatriliny vis-a-vis Islam starting from the inception of the\nidea that matriliny as system of familial organization need\nto be abolished owing to its \"un-Islamic\" character. Second,\nwe will discuss the implication of the passage of the\nMappila Succession Act with reference to inheritance of\nproperty. Third, we will see how 1920s become a liminal\nperiod in which the gender relations among Mappilas were\nre-defined in the idiom of male domination.\nThe Demand for the Succession Act c.\nMale, educated members lead the demand for the passage\nof the Succession law. They stressed that matriliny was\n\"un-Islamic.\" However, it can be seen that the junior\nmembers expressed their vested interest to acquire the\nproperty of matrilineal joint family in the idioms of\nreligion. In one of the first incidents among the demand for\nthe bill, \"Mappila residents of Cannanore and its suburbs\"\nsubmitted a memorial to the collector. The letter explicitly\nmarked their quarrel on matrilineal inheritance in\njuxtaposition to the legal perspective. The litigators had a\nproblem with the fact that Mappilas transferred their\nproperty to the children of their sisters and not to their own\nchildren as enjoined by the holy Quran11 and expounded by\nthe Sharia.12 They also cited the example of Mappilas of\nSouth Malabar to argue that customs in North Malabar was\nan aberration from the normal:\nThe Mappilas of South Malabar did not follow\nMarumakkathayam customary law. Mappilas of South Malabar\nwere the brethren who \"strictly follow Muhammadan law of\nThe demand for the changes in the rules of inheritance of\nthe matrilineal property surfaced in front of the authorities\nMalabar sought opinions from the Mappilas in the district\nof Malabar. 13 The responses to the various provisions of the\nMappila Succession Bill, according to official record found\na \"general\" acceptance, especially in North Malabar and\nSouth Canara. The report of the Tahsildar of Chirakkal\nstates that in meetings that held at 13 places had local Kazi\nas president. In Cannanore, the number of people present in\nthat conclude the outcome of the meetings can be quoted\nhere:\nAt some meetings, the Kazis and the learned maulavis14 who\naddressed the meetings went so far as declaring that if any one\nwere to say that he does not want that his self-acquired\nproperty should devolve according to the Muhammadan Law,\nhe would turn a kafir (infidel).15\nThis statement, however, exaggerates the acceptance of\nthe bill and under-represents the reaction against the bill.\nFor instance, Tahsildar of Kurumbranad, North Malabar,\nreported that in many places in the taluk, the idea of\nlegislation found opposition from the common people. They\nhad the view that the provisions in the Succession Act were\n8 SAGE Open\n\"in the least interest of the Mappila tharavadu and that it\ncould cut the very root of existing system of\nmarumakkathayam.\"16 More interestingly, even those who\nagreed with the legislation did not want the abolition\nmatrilineal customs. While many of the Mappilas were\napprehensive about the repercussions of the bill, they were\nambivalent about the \"un-Islamic character\" of the customs.\nSocial Impacts of the Debates on Mappila\nSuccession Act\nThe debates on the bill on succession had a huge impact on\nthe customary practices of inheritance, and it did create a lot\nof reactions from the society. The bill instilled fear among\nMappila because one of the provisions in the bill took away\nthe right to succeed the indisposed properties of a deceased\nkaranavan (the eldest male member of the joint family) by\nthe joint family, as the right would \"invariably be contested\nby his sons.\" They anticipated that it would become a\nperennial source of litigation.25 Many even argued that the\nAct was unnecessary because a Mappila already had\nadequate time to gift their individual properties during their\nlifetime by way of executing a will. In fact, the reality till\nthat period was such that Mappilas did not take much\nadvantage of provisions of Malabar Bill to pass ownership\nof the property as gift to those heirs prescribed by the\nAnglo-Muhammadan law by writing a will.17\nIn the official compilation of various \"opinions\ncollected\" from the selected people, some of them\napprehended that the Act posed a threat to the very\nfoundations of the matrilineal system. Thus, they opposed\nthe legislation of the Act. Some sections of the educated\nmales could only officially express it. In fact, nobody could\neven imagine practically abolishing matriliny though many\nanadiravans or the junior members of the tharavadu wished\nso. It is worth to mention that, the Act left out those\nproperties that were jointly held; the acquisition by the\nkaranavan; and the property gifted by matrilineal father.\nThese properties devolved to the matrilineal joint property.\nFurthermore, the option of \"the gift\" by will was used by\nMappilas to transfer the ownership of their private property\nalso to the matrilineal kin even after the passage of the\nMappila Succession Act in 1918. For doing this, Mappilas\nused the provision in the Malabar Wills Act, which enabled\nthem to give away their property during their \"lifetime.\"\nEventually, Malabar Succession Bill was passed in the\nMadras Legislative Assembly. The Succession Act led to\nthe destruction of tharavadu-based economy because\ntharavadu did not receive any additional property by way of\navailing the private property of the male members; while\ntharavadu had to give maintenance for more number of\nmembers.18 The decline in trust or embeddedness granted\nby the ties of affective relations further ruined the economic\nstability of the tharavadu (see Granovetter, 1985).\nThird, the Succession Act in essence asserted that the\nfather\u00adson bond and the wife\u00adhusband bond were \"natural.\"\nThis sensibility was new for Mappilas. This idea established\nthat the spouse and children become the normative heirs to\nthe self-acquired property of Mappilas. The era, thus,\nwitnessed the emergence of the \"individual\" who give or\nreceive property over and above the control of the\nmatrilineal joint family. However, the construction of the\nindividuality was highly gendered. Male individual\nMappilas as junior members of the family were more\n\"individual\" than female members as sisters. Male\nMappilas acquired private property; attempted to pass them\nby using Muhammadan law; and looked forward for\nclaiming entry into the public sphere as an \"individual.\"\nThe individual invariably claimed to transgress the sphere\nof the private. However, the claim could have been rootless\nwithout the structural support of matrilineal joint family,\nwhich still survived much longer. Family gave economic,\nsocial, and cultural resources to imagine the \"being\" of a\nmodern Muslim individual. Now, we will look at the\nsurvival of matriliny among Muslims of Malabar. One of\nthe central aspects of the negotiation of Muslims with\ndominant discourse of family in 20th century was the re-\ndefinition of the familial customs in the idioms of newly\nemerged notions of the \"correct Islam.\"\nReligion, Law, and Family: Alteration of\nthe Mappila Matriliny in Malabar, c. 1910-\nThe alteration of the Mappila matrilineal customs meant\nthat there was a re-conceptualization of the customs for the\npurpose of defending them against the threat posed by the\nnew abstract idea of the \"correct Islamic\" practice of\ninheritance (cf. Abdullah, 1985). The first process in the\nalteration Mappila matrilineal customs of inheritance was\nwith respect to the conceptualization of the succession of\nthe collectively owned property by tharavadu.\nAccording to Muhammadan law, there is no joint family;\nthus, it was held that there was no provision for the\nexistence of a joint family property.19 As a result, there was\na worry about the mismatch between the \"Islamic\" notion\nof the inheritance of property and the existence of joint\nfamily property. As a solution to resolve the incompatibility\nof matriliny with the Muhammadan law and to rescue the\ndivision of joint family property, it was suggested that one\ncan bring in the customary practice of inheritance of\ncollective property in the female line in agreement with the\nMuhammadan law. For that purpose, one had to find out\nsome provisions in the Islamic jurisprudence, which\nallowed succession in the female line. As result of this\npursuit, it was agreed that the tharavadu property could\npartake \"the nature of properties known as `wakf.'\"\nThe provision of the \"wakf\" or charity in practice there\nwas that of \"wakf-alal-aulad\" or charity in succession either\nin male or female line. This provision was in accordance\nwith Islamic law, especially Shafi school of law that\nallowed a person to endow one's properties to children or\nKottakkunnummal 9\nrelatives to enjoy in perpetuity in a particular line of\ndescent.20 This provision was known as private charity. The\nprovision also had the condition that the property could\npotentially devolve to an institution of charity like mosque\nin the absence of a female member in a family to inherit the\nsame. Thus, we can see that the Succession Act on\ninheritance of collective joint family property did not\nreceive support from the society. Mappilas, especially\northodox landowning sections of the Mappilas, could not\nafford re-distribution of tharavadu property to individuals.\nAnd by altering the meaning of the customs local people\ndefended the customs and it happened that \"the tharavadu\nproperty will become impartible and inalienable and the\nwhole system could be brought in accordance with . . .\nreligion.\"21 The alteration rescued the tharavadu house from\nthe vested interest of the male members who demanded\npartition of the collective property (Shankaran, 1932).\nThe second process of alteration happened by the passage\nof Mappila Succession Act of 1918. It was explicitly in\nresponse to the newly emerged demand for the changes in the\ncustomary rules regarding the inheritance of privately owned\nland according to the provisions of the Anglo-Muhammadan\nlaw. Anglo-Muhammadan law recognized individual\nproperty; the Mappila Succession Bill stood for allowing the\nsame for the self-acquired property of matrilineal Mappilas.\nThe Act marked a shift in the conceptualization of\ninheritance of the property of Mappilas.\nThe alteration in the meaning of the matriliny tended to\n\"clarify\" the ambiguity around religious nature of the\npractice. Let us elaborate on what it meant by the ambiguity\nby giving a specific example. One of the early documents to\nlook at this factor is the letter in response to a suggestion\nfor the legislation of the Malabar Partition Bill of 1910,\nwritten by Ahmed Ali Rajah of Cannanore to the district\njoint family properties of the entire committees who\npractice matriliny in Malabar came under the discretion of\nthe Partition Bill. Ali Rajah opposed the Bill due to its\nreference to Mappila matrilineal tharavadu and its\nsuggestion for the partition of the tharavadu into branches.\nAccording to him, the conceptual pre-suppositions in the\nBill violated the principles laid down in the Quran and the\nMuhammadan law in their original form. However, his\nletter also shows the difficulties of making any easy\nargument as well:\nOf course, I am bound to admit that marumakkathayam law of\ninheritance observed by the Moplah Mahomedans of Malabar\nis opposed to the teachings of Islam, but at the same time I beg\nto point out that in the present days, no single Mapla\nMussalman leaves his self-acquisition to his nephews and\nnieces to form a tavazhi or tharavadu.\nHe felt that a practical resolution to this confusion will\nbe to regard these properties as wakf properties; and hence\nwould not be \"un-Islamic\" in nature. Thus, the re-\nconceptualization of matrilineal customs in accordance with\nthe principles of wakf in 1920s was a pragmatic solution to\ntake away the ambiguity regarding the Islamic sanction of\nthe customs. However, these debates with reference to\nIslam and family were produced particularly in the\ndiscursive field of South India. This re-definition was\ncentral to formation of Muslims as political community.\nThe imagination of a modern political community called\n\"Mappila\" community was found in concrete forms by the\nthird decade of the 20th century. Young Mappilas organized\nmeetings and public talks at various towns in Malabar.\nThey debated political, religious, and social issues in these\ngatherings (Kandiyil, 1992). The reverberation of Khilafat\nmovement in 1920s coupled with the occurrence of the\nbiggest riot in 1921 caused havoc in Malabar due to\nmassive incidents of the state repression (Panikkar 1989).\nThe atrocities of the suppression forced many Mappilas to\nflee and to live in exile; they had interface with the Muslims\nof North India and other parts of South Asia (Razak, 2007).\nKhilafat movement also engendered Mappilas to the fold of\n\"universal brotherhood\"--an underlying assumption of\nwhat is called \"Pan-Islamism.\" For instance, associations\nfor socio-religious reform and the well-being of the\ncommunity were formed among the Mappila diaspora\nlocated in the countries like Sri Lanka22 simultaneously\nwith the formation of youth associations in various part of\nMalabar (see Kandiyil, 1992). Imagination of Mappila\ncommunity underscored the reference to a \"correct Islamic\npractice\" and these sacred imaginations transgressed the\nlimitations of space and time (cf. Eliade, 1987) to claim\nentry into ummah, the universal community of Muslims\nthroughout the world. The community formation surfaces\ninto the debates on matriliny, because, notion of family and\ndebates around women central those imaginations. For\nsocial reformers, women were emblematic of the pride of\nthe community and family was the microcosm of the\ncommunity (cf. Chatterjee, 1999). It is, however, important\nto see that the imagination of Mappila \"community\" and the\nattack on matriliny calling them un-Islamic derived energy\nfrom same discursive field of late 19th century Kerala\nwhere matrilineal practices among Nayars (Arunima, 2003)\nand Ezhavas of Travancore (Velayudhan, 1998) were\nattacked as \"non-Hindu\" practices and were radically\ntransformed or ruined.\nContextualizing the Mappila Succession\nAct in the Discourse on Gender and Islam\nFrom Late 19th Century Onward\nMatrilineal family inherited even the self-acquired properties\nof individuals before the passage of the Succession Act of\n1918. The Malabar Wills Act further restricted the possibility\nof the transfer of property to daughters by putting limits on\nthe nature of the gift by way of making will. Finally, the\nMappila Marumakkathayam Act of 1939 was passed in the\nMadras Legislative Assembly. This Act marked the decline\nof the institution of \"karanavan\" (the male head) or\n\"karanavathi\" (the female head) in the matrilineal joint\nfamily. While in the early 20th century, the family by\nauthority possessed all movable and immovable property. He\nhad right to manage or mortgage them in the interest of the\ntharavadu and to lease Ottis--a contract to the tenants. Head\nof the family maintained the expenses of the joint family\nhouse, and distribute income for the maintenance of the\njunior male members of the family called melchilav (pocket\nof Arakkal family of Cannanore, where the eldest member\nirrespective of sex became the family head. The Act\nrestricted the powers of the head. By the early 20th century,\nmale and female members of the family become co-owners\nto the tharavadu property. karanavan or karanavathi had to\nshow the accounts of the expenses and income to the\nmembers. There was also a decline in the ritual, spiritual, and\ncustomary status of the family head. The alteration of the\nmatrilineal customs and the loss of affective relations\ncontributed to the subjugation women to their husband (Ali,\ndid not surface in the discourse on Muslim matriliny until\n1930s, despite the churning happened during the period of\ndebates only in 1930s, when Mappila men grew apprehensive\nabout the \"protection\" of women who were already alienated\nfrom the system. By then, socio-religious reform movements\nimagined men and women in the idioms of modern\nindividuality.\nConclusion\nThe collective ideas and norms lead to formation of law and\ncustoms in society. And in turn, law influences the\nconstructions of collective ideals (Durkheim, 1964). The\ninterplay between law and society can lead us to the\nexploration of the collective imaginations that set up\nworldviews. In the historical context of Malabar, one can\nobserve that the imaginations in the realm of the religion\npermeate to what is commonly understood to be the realm\nof the secular, the court, and the state. In other words, the\nboundary between what is generally understood as the\nsecular morality and the religious truth blur in the social\nmilieu, the state and the judiciary shares the norms and \"the\ntruth\" as if they also constitute a religion. The junior\nmember of the Mappila joint family expressed their interest\nover the landed property of joint family using these idioms.\nIt was an easy strategy, as that historical era was witnessing\nchurning among all matrilineal communities in Kerala, and\nthere were transformations in the economy that helped them\nto acquire private property. Yet, they were by and large\ndepended on the existing institutions of matrilineal kinship.\nIn that sense, only by using the idioms religion and\nmorality, they could severe the affective relationship and\nchallenge existing customary practices. However, the social\nhistory of this era also shows how Mappila elders and\nwomen retained matrilineal kinship structure and negotiated\nwith breakage of affective relations by using the provisions\nin the customary practices, and moral economy sanctioned\nby family and religion such as the institution of wakf and\nthe creation of branches through female line. The history of\nthe transformation of matriliny shows how Mappila\nMuslims of Malabar negotiated with colonial legal\nprinciples, and Islamic laws, and attempted to retain their\nmatrilineal familial customs. First, the legislations, and\ndirections of the courts, failed to impose transformation in\nthe familial practices. Second, the textual and legal notion\nof Islam could not dictate the articulation of Mappila\nrituals, beliefs, and customs in their daily life. It does not,\nhowever, mean that the customary matrilineal practices and\ngender relations seldom underwent transformations. There\nwere constant processes of re-articulations of the family, re-\nconstruction of the role of women, and re-conceptualization\nof religious concepts. The court, religious experts, and\ncommon Mappilas always encountered one another in the\nsite of the family. Thus, the history of matriliny also tells us\nabout the changes in Mappila daily life in the context of\ncolonial modernity; as indeed, the ways in which Mappilas\nnegotiated with threats on their customary practices by way\nof incorporation, alteration, and negation. Mappila matriliny\nescaped radical transformations unlike Nayar matriliny in\nKerala. Mappilas re-created their customs by re-locating\nthose practices within the fabric of \"correct\" Islamic\npractices.\n"
