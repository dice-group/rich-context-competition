The structure of the light field depends on the spatial and spectral characteristics of\nthe light sources, and on the shape, 3D texture (corrugation), and material reflectance properties of the\npatches in the light field that receive and re-emit the light. According to Gershun, if color and temporal\nvariations are neglected, the light field is a 5-dimensional function that describes the light traveling\nin every direction (, ) through any point (x,y,z) in space (Gershun, Moon, & Timoshenko, 1939).\nGershun's light field is essentially the radiance distribution over space and directions. The theory of\nthe light field developed by Gershun describes light physically (optically). It describes everything that\ncan potentially be seen and in psychology this concept was called the \"plenoptic function\" by Adelson\nOur interest mainly concerns the perception of the light field; are people able to discern all aspects\nof the optical light field? A detection study done by Ostrovsky (Ostrovsky, Cavanagh, & Sinha, 2005)\nshowed that observers were remarkably insensitive to inconsistencies of illumination direction. They\nused both computer renderings consisting of identical but randomly oriented cubes and photographs\nof real scenes in which local inconsistencies of illumination were created. Their results suggest that\nthe visual system does not verify the global consistency for locally derived estimates of illumination\ndirection. However, Koenderink et al. found that human observers have expectations of how an object\nwould look like when it was introduced at an arbitrary location in a scene (Koenderink, Pont, van\nDoorn, Kappers, & Todd, 2007). It means that human observers can infer the light field even in the\nempty space around them, which the authors called the \"visual light field.\" Later, Schirillo confirmed\nthis theory on the basis of a review study (Schirillo, 2013). In this study, Schirillo presented both direct\nand indirect evidence of our awareness of the light field.\nThe visual light field in real scenes\n614 Xia L, Pont SC, Heynderickx I\nWhich properties of the light field can human observers perceive? The light field can strongly\ninfluence the appearance of a scene and inversely, its properties can be reflected by the appearance\nof a scene. The light field in natural scenes is highly complicated due to intricate optical interactions,\ncontaining low and high frequencies in the radiance distribution function. Nonetheless, the human\nvisual system (HVS) is able to distinguish the intensity, the primary illumination direction, and the\ndiffuseness, which are basic (low-order) properties of a light field (Cuttle, 2003; Frandsen, 1989;\nKoenderink, van Doorn, Kappers, Pont, & Todd, 2005; Morgenstern, 2011; Morgenstern, Geisler,\nmathematical structure and physical meaning of the light field components, plus a manner to measure\nand visualize the light field. The intensity corresponding to \"radiant flux density\" in Gershun's theory\ndescribes a constant illumination from all directions, which is usually known as \"ambient light\" in\ncomputer graphics. The \"light vector\" describes the average illumination direction and strength. Dif-\nfuseness of light was not mathematically described by Gershun or Mury and it ranges from fully colli-\nmated via hemispherical diffuse to completely diffuse light. An overcast sky generates hemispherical\ndiffuse light, while direct sunlight is a typical example of collimated light and a polar whiteout of\ncompletely diffuse light.\nThe next question is how to reliably measure the perceived light field properties. Koenderink\net al.'s experiment (Koenderink et al., 2007) adopted a method based upon the generic notion of a\n\"gauge object.\" Their stimuli were stereo photographs of a scene consisting of matte white painted\npenguins facing each other. A suitable \"gauge object\" was introduced at various locations in the pho-\ntographic scenes and the observers were asked to adjust the appearance of the gauge object to visually\nfit the scene with respect to the lighting. Three properties of the light field (i.e., intensity, direction, and\ndiffuseness) could be adjusted simultaneously. The results suggested that observers could accurately\nmatch the illumination at arbitrary locations in a static scene. The high reliability of the observers on\ntheir settings also demonstrated the validity of the method of using a \"gauge object\" to measure the\nvisual fit with a scene. In our research, a similar experiment with the same method is conducted. How-\never, instead of using photographs, we perform our experiment in a real scene by optically mixing a\ngauge object into a group of scene objects.\nLooking at a real scene is totally different than looking at a picture of it, even when stereo pic-\ntures are used. There are a few reasons. First, there is a big difference in the dynamic range (DR) of\nluminance values between the real world and a computer screen. The real world has about 10 orders\nof dynamic range for luminance values spread across the spectrum from darkness to brightness while\na computer screen has only approximately two to three (Myszkowski, Mantiuk, & Krawczyk, 2008).\nSecond, some depth cues also induce differences between the real world and synthetic stereo images.\nThe depth cue \"motion parallax\" is one of them. Observers can't stay absolutely still. When they\nmove, the apparent relative motion of several stationary objects against a background gives hints about\ntheir relative distance, which can provide absolute depth information if the direction and velocity of\nthe movement are known (Ferris, 1972). Besides head movements, eye movements can also provide\nadditional information about the observed objects (Wismeijer, Erkelens, van Ee, & Wexler, 2010).\nIn this paper, we will implement a novel experimental setup to introduce a real gauge object into\na real scene (Xia, Pont, & Heynderickx, 2013). A similar setup was first used in a material perception\nstudy in which real objects with different materials were optically mixed together (Pont, Koenderink,\nVan Doorn, Wijntjes, & Te Pas, 2012). The key point of this setup lies in the use of a semitranspar-\nent mirror. The scene and probe are located inside two separated boxes and they are mixed together\noptically by a semitransparent mirror (see Figure 1). In this way, the properties of lighting for the\nprobe and scene can be changed separately without any mutual interference. We will focus on testing\nobservers' sensitivities for illumination direction, diffuseness, and intensity because former studies\ninto picture perception showed that observers are sensitive to these low-order characteristics of light.\nObservers have to judge the visual \"fit\" of the probe in the scene.\nIn the experiment, two types of probes will be used, a smooth sphere and a rough sphere (golf\nball). Theoretically, the illuminance flow or texture contrast gradients over the sphere due to the rough-\nness of the golf ball give cues about its illumination additional to shading (Koenderink & Pont, 2003;\nPont & Koenderink, 2004). It has been found that observers are sensitive to such gradient orientations\non flat rough surfaces (Koenderink et al., 2003), but to our knowledge this is the first systematic study\nof whether observers use such cues on 3D objects to judge specific illumination characteristics.\nThe visual light field in real scenes 615\n2 Experimental setup\nWe made a setup to optically mix the scene and probe object, as shown in Figure 1. Three 30 cm\n\u00d730 cm\u00d730 cm cubes formed the main framework of this setup. In cube B, there were five color-\nful geometrical shapes forming a simple scene. In the center of cube C, there was a white sphere,\nwhich served as the probe. Because a white object has a higher albedo than an object with any other\ncolor, one of the colorful geometrical shapes was painted white to provide an anchor. Inside cube A,\na semitransparent optical mirror was placed vertically at the diagonal, which was at 45\u00ba with respect\nto the viewing direction. Due to this mirror, the probe was seen through the mirror within the scene\nvia its reflection in the mirror. The edges of the mirror could not be seen through the viewing hole. All\ncubes'insides were covered with light absorbing blackout material (black flocked paper, from Edmund\nOptics) to avoid too much scattering from the background, optical cross-talk through, and haze on the\nmirror. Occlusions between the probe and the shapes in the scene were prevented. Thus, when observ-\ners looked through the viewing hole, they saw the optical mixture of the scene and probe as if they\nwere put together, as illustrated in Figure 2. The lighting of the scene and probe were provided by one\nLCD screen on top of cube B and one on top of cube C. Independent images were displayed on the two\nscreens to determine the individual lighting for the scene and for the probe.\nTo make sure that both the probe and scene contributed 50% to the final superpositioned scene, we\ncalibrated our setup. First, the relationship between the screens' luminance and their pixel values was\nmeasured. Then, we measured the reflectivity and transmission of the semitransparent mirror, being\n41% and 59%, respectively (adding up to 100%, since this was a high-quality semitransparent mirror).\nBy multiplying the luminance of screen B with the reflectivity of the mirror, we calculated the \"simu-\nlated luminance\" for screen B. In the same way, we calculated the \"simulated luminance\" for screen C\nby multiplying the luminance of screen C with the transmission of the mirror.\nFigure 1. Illustration of the setup. The setup consists of three 30 cm \u00d7 30 cm \u00d7 30cm cubes, of which the inside\nis covered with black velvet paper. In cube B, we made a simple scene with five geometrical shapes. In cube C, we\nplaced a white sphere, which served as the probe.Asemitransparent mirror was placed vertically at the diagonal of\nbox A. Two LCD screens, one covering the top of cube B and one the top of cube C, provided the lighting which\ncould thus be varied independently for the scene and probe.\nFigure 2. Optical mixture of scene and probe photographed from the viewing hole, with a smooth probe\n(left image), and a rough probe (right image).\n616 Xia L, Pont SC, Heynderickx I\nLighting stimuli\nTwo groups of images were used to simulate the light sources on the scene and probe, as depicted in\nFigure 3. The first group of stimuli was made to simulate intensity variations (group I) and a second\ngroup of stimuli was made to simulate variations in direction and diffuseness (group II).\nIn stimulus group I, we investigated whether human beings are sensitive to variations in lighting\nintensity over a scene. The lighting intensity variations were achieved by varying the pixel value of an\nimage consisting of a white disk in the center of the LCD screen. The diameter of the white disk was\nL/3 (L = 25 cm, which was the width of the cube's top window). Three levels of intensity were used,\nmarked as I\n, I\n, and I\n(with I\n>I\n> I\n). For each level of intensity, we selected pixel values such that\nthe \"simulated luminance\" of screen B and screen C were the same, as given in Table 1. It has long\nbeen known that the HVS has a nonlinear response to luminance. This nonlinearity can be quantified\nFigure 3. Lighting stimuli: Group I, variations in intensity which were achieved by changing the pixel values of\nthe image of a disk (diameter of L/3, L = 25 cm) in the center of the LCD screen; Group II, variations in direction\nand diffuseness which were achieved by changing the position and the size of the displayed white disks. The\ndisks were displayed in the center and in two opposite corners and had a diameter of L/3, 2L/3, and L (L = 25cm).\nThe visual light field in real scenes 617\nusing the concept of JND (Just Noticeable Difference), which represents the luminance difference\nbetween two patches that the average human observer can just perceive under given viewing condi-\ntions. Following the definition, the difference between two luminance levels on the perceptual scale is\nproportional to the number of JNDs between them (Xu, Saha, Guarnieri, Ramponi, & Badano, 2008).\nGrayscale Standard Display Function which describes the relationship between luminance and Just-\nNoticeable Differences. When selecting three intensity levels, we made sure that the difference in\nluminance between I\nand I\n, and between I\nand I\nhad the same number of JNDs. The I\nand I\nwere\nselected such that the difference when I\nilluminated the scene and I\nilluminated the probe, or vice\nversa, was obvious (based on a pilot experiment with seven observers). The difference in luminance\nbetween I\nand I\n, and between I\nand I\nIn stimulus group II, we varied the position and the size of the disk to investigate whether human\nbeings are sensitive to the average direction as defined by the light vector (Gershun et al., 1939;\nMury, 2009; Mury et al., 2007) and to the diffuseness as defined by the scale of light of a light source\n(Frandsen, 1989). We displayed white disks with a diameter of L/3 in the center and in two opposite\ncorners of the screen to vary the direction, and displayed white disks with diameters L/3, 2L/3, and L\nto investigate the sensitivity to diffuseness. The simulated luminance for screen B and screen C was set\nto their maximum of 77 cd/m2, corresponding to I\n. As we needed to keep the total emitted luminous\nflux for the three diameters of the white disk the same, we used the same number of white pixels as for\nL/3, but randomly distributed them over the disk when its diameter was larger than L/3. This created a\nnoise pattern in the LCD image mimicking the light source (as shown in Figure 3), but didn't impact\nthe light on the probe or scene objects. We also varied the position of the disk for the diameters L/3\nand 2L/3 to investigate the interaction between direction and diffuseness. We refer to the stimuli in\nGroup II by D\nto D\n.\nProbe\nThis experiment was performed with two different probe objects, i.e., a smooth sphere and a golf ball\n(see Figure 2), in order to check whether human beings are sensitive to illuminance flow over a rough\nprobe. The dimples on the golf ball resulted in 3D texture contrast gradients over the ball, which gener-\nated \"illuminance flow\" and provided cues additional to the shading.\nTask\nThe task of the observer was to judge whether the white probe fitted the scene with regard to its light-\ning. If the observer thought the lighting of the scene and probe was the same, they had to press \"Yes\"\non the keyboard. Otherwise, they had to press \"No.\" After they had given their answer, they had to\npress \"confirm\" to proceed to the next trial.\nAs illustrated in Figure 3, stimulus group I consisted of three lighting conditions, and so, resulted\nin nine combinations for scene and probe. Stimulus group II consisted of seven lighting conditions,\nand so, resulted in 49 combinations for scene and probe. So, among the total of 58 combinations, 48\nhad different lighting settings for scene and probe and 10 had the same lighting settings for scene and\nprobe. We repeated the 10 \"same combinations\" for three times to improve the balance between the\nnumber of same and different combinations, resulting in a total of 78 comparisons to be made for one\nprobe. As we used two probes, this resulted in 156 trials in total.\nBefore the formal experiment started, all participants were asked to do a few practice trials to\nbecome familiar with the procedure. The whole experiment was divided into two sessions, where a dif-\nferent type of probe was evaluated in each session. Since only one type of scene layout was used, there\ncould be learning effects. In order to minimize the effects on the outcome, all stimuli were randomly\nTable 1. Pixel values, simulated luminance values, and their\ncorresponding JND levels for three levels of intensity\n618 Xia L, Pont SC, Heynderickx I\ngiven within each session and the order of the two sessions was balanced across participants. Between\nthe first and second session, the observers took a break. The whole experiment took about half an hour\nfor each participant.\nParticipants\nTwenty observers participated in this experiment, 11 females and nine males, two of whom were\nthe first and second author. Observers ranged in age from 24 to 43 and the median age was 30. The\nparticipants were naive with respect to the setup of this experiment except for the two authors. All\nparticipants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. They all gave written, informed consent. All\nexperiments were done in agreement with local ethical guidelines, Dutch Law, and the Declaration of\nHelsinki.\nThis results section is organized as follows: first, we analyze the overall percentages of correct\nanswers; after that we use the data of Group I to investigate how sensitive our observers are to vari-\nations in lighting intensity; then the data of Group II are used to check how sensitive they are to the\nvariations of lighting direction and diffuseness. For all statistical tests applied below, we measured the\nsignificance at the 0.05 level.\nWhen examining the overall percentages of correct answers, we distinguish two options: for the\nstimuli with the same lighting on probe and scene, \"Yes\" was the correct answer, while for the stimuli\nwith different settings, \"No\" was the correct answer. Consequently, we split the data into two catego-\nries, one category \"stimuli with same lighting\" and another category \"stimuli with different lighting.\"\nThe percentages of correct answers are given in Table 2. We used one-sample binomial tests to check\nwhether these percentages were significantly different from 50%. The results showed that they all were\nsignificantly different from chance level.\nBefore we go into a more detailed analysis, we introduce the phenomenon of the \"swap effect.\"\nFor some combinations of the scene and probe lighting, participants judged the probe to fit the scene\nwell, yet swapping the lighting over the probe with that over the scene dramatically shifted partici-\npants' judgments. One example is given in Figure 4, where the optical mixture of a lower intensity I\non the probe and a higher intensity I\non the scene (Figure 4(a)) looks as a good fit between probe and\nscene (only 35% of the observers recognized a mismatch between probe and scene), while the optical\nmixture of a higher intensity I\non the probe and a lower intensity I\non the scene (Figure 4(b)) does\nnot look as a good fit between probe and scene (indeed 75% of the observers recognized the mismatch\nin illumination on probe and scene). Because of this asymmetry, we take this \"swap effect\" into con-\nsideration in the rest of our analysis. To quantify the combinations of lighting on probe and scene as\nsusceptible to the \"swap effect,\" we used the Pearson's Chi-square test on the percentages of correct\nanswers for the combinations of mirrored lighting on probe and scene. The lighting combinations\nthat resulted in a significant difference are marked with a red solid frame in the matrix graphs of\nGroup I results: intensity sensitivity\nThe percentages of correct answers to compare lighting intensity on probe and scene are visualized\nin Figure 5 for each possible combination. The gray level indicates the percentage of correct answers,\nwhere black means that 0% of answers is correct. One-sample binomial tests were performed to check\nTable 2. Percentages of correct answers split up for stimuli with the same lighting setting\non scene and probe and stimuli with different lighting setting on scene and probe (N =\ntotal number of answers, Percentage = percentage of correct answers)\nStimuli Type of probe\nStimuli with same lighting Stimuli with different lighting\nN Percentage N Percentage\nGroup I\nGroup II\nThe visual light field in real scenes 619\nwhether the percentage of right answers was significantly different from chance. Cells in the matrix\ngraph of Figure 5 for which this was the case are marked with red \"*.\"\nWe noticed that the data in Figure 5 are not symmetrical with respect to the black dashed diagonal\n(from upper left to bottom right), which is due to the \"swap effect.\" The lighting combinations where\nthe \"swap effect\" occurred are marked with a red solid frame. The cells in the upper right represent\nlighting with lower intensity on the probe than on the scene (see Figure 4(a)). The cells in the bottom\nleft represent lower intensity on the scene than on the probe (see Figure 4(b)). The combination \"I\n~I\n\"\nhad the largest difference in intensity (120 JNDs), and the observers were quite sensitive to it with\nmore than 85% of correct answers. For the combinations \"I\n~I\n\" and \"I\n~I\n\", the difference in inten-\nsity was much smaller (60 JNDs), but still rather well perceived if the lower intensity illuminated the\nscene and the higher intensity illuminated the probe (except for the combination \"I\n~I\n\" for the smooth\nprobe). However, when the lower intensity illuminated the probe and the higher intensity illuminated\nthe scene, the observers had difficulties seeing the mismatch (the percentage of correct answers was\nnot significantly different from the chance level).\nWe employed a binary logistic analysis of the generalized linear model to analyze the probability that\nthe observers could see the difference in lighting intensity between probe and scene. Only the combi-\nnations with different intensity levels of lighting for scene and probe were included in this analysis.\nThe predictable variables were the type of probe, the \"swap effect,\" and the difference in intensity\nlevel. The \"swap effect\" included two cases: (1) lower intensity on the probe than on the scene, and\nFigure 4. \"Swap effect\" for lighting settings with different intensity: (a) lower intensity on the probe and higher\nintensity on the scene (percentage of correct answers: 35%), (b) lower intensity on the scene and higher intensity\non the probe (percentage of correct answers: 75%)\nFigure 5. Matrix graphs representing the percentages of correct answers for stimulus group I. The columns\nrepresent the intensity level on the probe, while the rows represent the intensity level on the scene. The gray level\nindicates the percentage of right answers. Black means that 0% of the answers was correct. For the cells marked\nwith a red \"*,\"the proportion of correct answers was significantly different from 50%, according to the result of\na one-sample binomial test. The paired cells marked with a red solid frame show where the swap effect occurred\naccording to a Pearson's Chi-square test. The left graph represents the data for the smooth probe and the right\ngraph the data for the rough probe.\n620 Xia L, Pont SC, Heynderickx I\n(2) lower intensity on the scene than on the probe. Two-way interactions between probe type and inten-\nsity difference and between the \"swap effect\" and intensity difference were also included. The results\nare given in Table 3. There was no significant difference in percentage of correct answers between the\nsmooth and rough probe. Also, the interaction between probe type and intensity difference was not sig-\nnificant. The influence of the \"swap effect\" and intensity were both statistically significant (p<0.05), as\nwell as their interaction. The latter is consistent with what we described before: people are sensitive to\na small difference in intensity only when the scene is illuminated by the lower intensity and the probe\nby the higher intensity, but this \"swap effect\" disappears when the intensity difference is large enough.\nGroup II result: direction and diffuseness sensitivity\nTo give an overview of the data, the percentages of correct answers for different combinations of\ndirection and diffuseness are visualized as matrix graphs in Figure 6. Again, the gray level in the cell\nrepresents the percentage of correct answers, where black means that 0% of the answers was correct.\nIn Figure 6, it can be seen that the global patterns for the performance as a function of lighting direc-\ntion and diffuseness are quite robust. In both graphs, the grey levels are not symmetrically distributed\nwith respect to the diagonal (from upper left to bottom right) due to the \"swap effect.\" Where it occurs,\nthe corresponding cells are marked with a red solid frame.\nFor further analysis, Figure 7 illustrates the percentages of correct answers for lighting with differ-\nent directions or different diffuseness or both, for the smooth probe and the rough probe, respectively.\nWe did not consider the \"swap effect\" in Figure 7 because the \"swap effect\" for directions differs from\nthat for diffuseness. Later, we will discuss the \"swap effect\" for direction and diffuseness separately.\nThe bars labeled as \"same-direction\" represent cases with the same direction on the probe and the\nTable 3.

The paired cells marked with a red solid frame show where the swap effect\noccurred according to a Pearson's Chi-square test.

Since only the data for combinations with different lighting settings for scene and probe were\nconsidered here, the bar labeled as \"same-direction\" was absent from the diffuseness combination\nof \"same-diffuseness\" in Figure 7. Likewise, because the display disk with the largest diffuseness\nL could only be located in the center, the bars labeled as \"near ~farther,\" which represent direction\nvariation from the near corner to far corner, were absent from the diffuseness combinations \"2L/3~L\"\nand \"L/3~L.\" One-sample binomial tests were conducted to evaluate to what extent the percentages\ncorrect answers differed from a chance level of 50%. If the latter was the case, the corresponding bar\nin Figure 7 is marked with a red \"*.\" If the percentage was significantly lower than the chance level, it\nindicated that the observers consistently saw the lighting on the scene and probe to fit. If the percent-\nage was significantly higher than the chance level, it implied that the observers had no difficulty to\nperceive the mismatch in lighting on scene and probe.\nAgain, we used a binary logistic analysis of a generalized linear model to analyze the probability\nthat the observers could see the mismatch in lighting for the probe and the scene. The predictable\nvariables were the type of probe, the difference in direction, and the difference in diffuseness. All two-\nway interactions were included. Since the \"swap effect\" for direction and diffuseness was different\nand will be discussed separately later, we did not introduce the \"swap effect\" into this analysis. The\nresults in Table 4 reveal that the influence of probe type was statistically significant (P<0.05). Thus, as\nwe expected, the probe type did have an effect on the detection of combined direction and diffuseness\ndifferences while it had no effect on the detection of intensity differences. Overall, the percentage of\ncorrect answers was higher for the rough probe than for the smooth probe. The effects of differences\nin direction and in diffuseness were both highly significant. The first set of bars in Figure 7 (i.e., dif-\nferences in direction for the same diffuseness) illustrates that as the difference in direction increased,\nmore and more people could see that the directions did not fit. Generally, as the difference in diffuse-\nness became larger (i.e., illustrated by the same type of bars in different sets in Figure 7), more of\nthe observers could detect the mismatch. The percentage of correct answers was especially low for\nthe combination \"2L/3~L.\" We also found a significant interaction between direction and diffuseness\nFigure 7. Percentages of correct answers as a function of the difference in diffuseness for different pairs of\ndirections. The left graph represents the data for the smooth probe and the right graph for the rough probe. The\nbars marked with red \"*\" had a percentage of correct answers significantly different from 50%.

These results were in agreement with what Figure 7 showed. In general, observers were\nvery sensitive to differences in lighting direction, but this sensitivity was affected by the lighting dif-\nfuseness. When the diffuseness was relatively large, but different for probe and scene (i.e., for the\ncombination 2L/3~L), most of the observers tended to be uncertain whether the scene and probe fit\neach other (since both in Figure 7(a) for the smooth probe and in Figure 7(b) for the rough probe most\nof the bars were not significantly different from chance level).\nSwap effect\nThe influence of the \"swap effect\" for direction and diffuseness was analyzed separately to investi-\ngate what happened when the lighting with only different directions or only different diffuseness was\nswapped between probe and scene. We selected the data with only one kind of difference either in\ndirection or in diffuseness, to avoid mutual impact. The \"swap effect\" for direction included two con-\nditions: (1) farther lighting on the probe and closer on the scene, and (2) farther lighting on the scene\nand closer on the probe. Similarly, the \"swap effect\" for diffuseness included also two conditions: (1)\nlarger diffuseness on the probe and smaller on the scene, and (2) larger diffuseness on the scene and\nsmaller on the probe.\nFor lighting settings with different directions but same diffuseness, both stimuli with diffuseness\nof L/3 and 2L/3 were selected as shown in Figure 8. The cells right above the black dashed diagonal\n(from upper left to bottom right) in the matrix graph represent farther lighting on the probe than on the\nscene, while the cells left below the diagonal represent farther lighting on the scene than on the probe.\nGenerally speaking, both graphs in Figure 8 were symmetrically mirrored with respect to the black\ndashed diagonal except for the combination D\n-D\nwhen a smooth probe was used (as marked with a\nred solid frame in Figure 8 left graph). The result of a binomial test showed that when D\nwas on the\nprobe and D\non the scene (as illustrated in the left image of Figure 9), the observers were just guessing\nwhether both lighting conditions fitted. However, when D\nand D\nwere swapped (as illustrated in the\nright image of Figure 9), the observers were quite sure that the light on the probe did not fit the light on\nthe scene. We have no specific explanation for this observation, but just noticed (as can be seen from\nFigure 9) that the mixed scene looked more disharmonious with a brighter illumination on the probe\nwhen the center lighting was on the probe and the far lighting on the scene. A binary logistic analysis\nof a generalized linear model was performed using the probe type, the \"swap effect,\" the difference in\ndirection, as well as their two-way interactions as predictor variables. However, the result showed that\nFigure 8. Matrix graphs representing the percentages of correct answers for combinations of different directions\nbut same diffuseness on the probe and the scene.

In\neach group of cells, the ones right above the black dashed diagonal (from upper left to bottom right)\nhave a higher diffuseness on the probe than on the scene, while the ones left below the black dashed\ndiagonal have higher diffuseness on the scene than on the probe. In general, each group of cells is\npretty well mirrored with respect to its diagonal, suggesting that the \"swap effect\" was small, except\nfor the combination D\n-D\n. Again, a binary logistic analysis of a generalized linear model was per-\nformed, using the probe type, \"swap effect,\" and difference in diffuseness as main predictor variables,\nincluding their two-way interactions. We did not find a significant main effect of the \"swap effect\"\n(Chi2 = 2.991, p = 0.084), but we did find a significant interaction between \"swap effect\" and \"dif-\nference in diffuseness\" (Chi2 = 12.432, p = 0.002). The latter was already suggested by our observa-\ntions in Figure 10. With small \"difference in diffuseness\" between the probe and scene (L/3~2L/3:\nD\n-D\n,D\n-D\n,D\n-D\n-D\n), observers often had difficulties to see the mismatch in illumina-\ntion diffuseness and there was no significant \"swap effect\". However, when the \"difference in dif-\nfuseness\" was relatively large (L/3~L:D\n-D\n), the \"swap effect\" was significant. In the latter case, the\npercentage of correct answers was higher when the lighting on the scene was more diffuse than on the\nFigure 10.

One advantage of this setup is that it allows us to introduce a real\nprobe object into a real scene while the lighting of the scene and the probe can be varied separately\nwithout any mutual interference. Furthermore, the task to judge the visual \"fit\" of the illuminated\nprobe in a scene allows us to obtain a direct operational measure, which quantifies what the observer\nsees with a purely visual \"yardstick\" (Koenderink et al., 2007; Koenderink, van Doorn, & Wagemans,\n2012). During the experiment, observers had little trouble with the task and none of them doubted that\nthe probe and scene were actually not located in the same box.\npants to adjust the lighting on the (virtual) probe such that it fitted into the (virtual) scene, we here\nsimplified the task by asking observers only to indicate (with \"yes\" or \"no\") whether the lighting of the\nprobe fitted the scene. We repeated the stimuli with the same lighting on probe and scene three times\neach, so that the number of same combinations was 60, and the number of different combinations was\n96 (see also Section 2). Table 2, however, shows that the number of \"yes\" and \"no\" responses was\nbalanced. Indeed, for stimuli with the same lighting conditions (N = 60) participants on average had\n78% correct answers (and so, on average 47 \"yes\" and 13 \"no\" responses), whereas for stimuli with\ndifferent lighting conditions (N = 96) participants on average had 63% correct answers (and so, on\naverage 36 \"yes\" and 60 \"no\" responses). So, the sum of the \"yes\" responses and \"no\" responses was\nmuch more balanced than what could be expected from the number of stimuli with the same or differ-\nent lighting conditions. We don't think that this tendency of balancing the \"yes\" and \"no\" responses\nhas influenced our findings, since it in principle affected all stimuli in a similar way.\nWe found that the observers were sensitive to variations of the light intensity, direction, and dif-\nfuseness, which confirmed the results of former studies. A study conducted by Pont et al. found that\nobservers were able to match the direction and diffuseness of a light field (Pont & Koenderink, 2007).\nThe visual light field study by Koenderink et al. certified observers' ability on estimating the direction\nand diffuseness in natural scenes and found that the observers were also sensitive to the variations in\nlight field intensity (Koenderink et al., 2007). While their studies were all performed based on the use\nof images on computer screens, this study was conducted in real scenes. Hence, this study confirmed\nthat observers' sensitivity to intensity, direction, and diffuseness of the light field also holds for real\nscenes. As expected, we found that as the difference in intensity, direction, and diffuseness increased,\nthe observers were better aware of the mismatches between the scene and probe. Since the methods\nused in the former studies (adjustment to create visual fit) and in the current study (yes/no to visual fit)\nare so different, it is not possible to compare the results in terms of sensitivity.\nIt should be noted that the current study only used one particular, relatively simple real scene\nto demonstrate the measurement of the visual light field in a real scene. As participants assessed\n156 stimuli with this particular scene, we cannot exclude a learning or adaptation effect to this scene.\nHowever, all stimuli in the experiment were provided to each participant in a different random order,\nand so, possible learning/adaptation to the stimuli is not expected to affect our findings. Obviously,\nmore scenes need to be investigated to evaluate the generalizability of our findings to other scenes. We\ndo expect that also in other real scenes people will be sensitive to the intensity, direction, and diffuse-\nness of the light field, though possibly with different sensitivity.\nWe discovered in some cases a \"swap effect,\" which means that whether the mismatch in lighting\nbetween probe and scene was visible dependent on which of the two lighting conditions was on the\nscene and which on the probe. We listed the optical mixtures for all the cases where the \"swap effect\"\noccurred in Figure 11. For lighting conditions differing in intensity and diffuseness, the \"swap effect\"\noccurred with both the smooth probe and rough probe. The \"swap effect\" for one of the combinations\nof different directions of the lighting only occurred with the smooth probe.\nTo investigate why the \"swap effect\" happened, we examined all optical mixtures for which it\nhappened in Figure 11. The observers were significantly more aware of the mismatch between scene\nand probe for the conditions in the left column than for those in the right column according to the\npercentage of correct answers (PoCA). We noticed that the probes in the left column seemed to be\nbrighter with respect to their surrounding scene than in the right column. Therefore we calculated\nThe visual light field in real scenes 625\nFigure 11. Optical mixtures of scene and probe for all the cases where the \"swap effect\" occurred. The lighting\non the probe was marked as \"P\" (i.e., P:I2\nmeans the probe was illuminated with intensity I2\n) and the lighting on\nthe scene was marked as \"S.\" \"PoCA\" represents the percentage of correct answers. The higher the PoCA is, the\nmore observers were aware of the \"mismatch in lighting between scene and probe.\"\nthe ratios between the average luminance of the probe and the average luminance of the scene (R =\nLum_probe/Lum_scene) for the images of the optical mixtures in both the left and right columns, see\nFigure 12. Since we took the photographs using the same setting of the camera, the average luminance\ncould be estimated via the average pixel luminance. To exclude the dark areas and noise in the pho-\ntographs, only the pixels whose luminance was larger than 0.1 were considered. Figure 12 shows that\nthe luminance of the probe with respect to the scene was indeed higher for all the optical mixtures in\nthe left column. These results indicate that indeed the observers might have judged the mixes in the\n626 Xia L, Pont SC, Heynderickx I\nright column as a better fit because the average luminance of the visible parts of the probe were closer\nto the average luminance of the visible parts of the scene objects whereas in the left column the probe\nis clearly much higher in luminance.\nIn our experiment, the mean illuminance over the probe decreased as the diffuseness increased.\nFigure 13 illustrates the illumination over the probe under three diffuseness levels: from left to right,\nthe diameter of the disk changes from L/3 (8 cm) to 2L/3 (16 cm) and L (25 cm), and the correspond-\ning scale of light is 24%, 43%, and 59% according to the definition by Frandsen (Frandsen, 1989); so,\nthe mean illuminance over the probe decreases by a factor of 92% and 83% in the middle and right\nimage in comparison to the left image. This observation triggered another question, namely whether\nthe observers detected the difference of diffuseness by just comparing the mean illumination on the\nprobe and the scene. If so, they would have difficulties in judging where the inhomogeneity originated\nfrom: from the difference in intensity or from the difference in diffuseness, not to mention estimating\nthe diffuseness and intensity simultaneously. Therefore, our next study will focus on whether observ-\ners can simultaneously match the intensity, direction, and diffuseness in real scenes.\nFinally, our findings show that the use of a rough probe did not help the observers to detect the\nmismatch in intensity of the lighting between the scene and probe, but it helped them to find the mis-\nmatch in the combination of lighting direction and diffuseness between scene and probe. This proved\nour expectation that for real 3D objects, human observers can use the illuminance flow to judge illu-\nmination properties. In computational vision, the illuminance flow is derived from the roughness on\nthe mesoscale. The variation of illuminance on the macroscale is usually denoted as \"shading\" and the\nvariation of illuminance on the mesoscale as \"3D texture\" (Pont & Koenderink, 2004). In theory, the\nilluminance flow generated by 3D texture gradients can give additional cues about the illumination\nto the \"shading\" (Koenderink & Pont, 2003). This theory was confirmed for flat surfaces by asking\nFigure 12.

The bars labeled as\n\"left column\" and \"right column\" represent the optical mixtures in the left column and right column of Figure 11,\nrespectively. The label SP represents results for the smooth probe and RP for the rough probe.\nFigure 13.

In our experiment, the illuminance flow or texture\ncontrast gradients over the rough probe give information about the direction and diffuseness. However,\nit doesn't give information about the intensity because the texture gradient structure is invariant for\nintensity changes. So, as expected, the 3D texture on the rough probe did not improve judgments of\nthe mismatches in lighting intensity, but it did for diffuseness and direction. To our knowledge, this\nis the first systematic study proving that observers use the illuminance flow over 3D objects to judge\nspecific illumination characteristics.\n5 Conclusions\nIn summary, we implemented a novel experimental setup to investigate human sensitivity to low-order\nproperties of light fields in real scenes, namely the intensity, direction, and diffuseness. We found that\nobservers are able to detect whether a probe fits a scene with respect to these light qualities. However,\nin some cases with different lighting on the probe and scene, the awareness of the mismatch depended\non which lighting condition was on the scene and which on the probe, which we called the \"swap\neffect.\" For these cases, we found that observers judged the fit to be better if the average luminance\nof the visible parts of the probe were closer to the average luminance of the visible parts of the scene\nobjects. Finally, adding roughness to the spherical probe improved judgments of the mismatch in\ndirection and the diffuseness of the lighting, showing that human observers use illuminance flow as a\ncue to the light.\n"
