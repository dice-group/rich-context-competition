One\nof the best examples is shown in figure 1.\nFigure 1. The central building appears to move nonrigidly when the entire figure is scrolled up and\ndown.\nWhen observers gaze at points on the near corner of the central building (indicated\nby an arrow) during an up-and-down translation of the image(1) they perceive a nonrigid\ntransformation of the central building, unlike other parts of the scene. An animated version\nof figure 1 can be viewed in movie 1 (or see http://rci.rutgers.edu/ sungho4/movie1.mov).\nWhen the whole scene is moving up the near corner of the central building wiggles down,\nand vice versa. The novelty in this illusion is that the nonrigid transformation is experienced\nin 3-dimensional (3D) depth, rather than on the picture plane, making the 3D percept that\nis generated in the static image by the perspective projection even stronger. The illusion\nis persistent despite the knowledge of the physical implausibility of a nonrigidly moving\nbuilding.\nApparently, the lines of the building floors joining at the near corner--and converging\nat vanishing points on the horizon--seem to be related to the illusory nonrigid motion,\nbecause the rightmost small five-story building with nearly parallel floor lines appears to be\nrigidly translated up and down. One can argue that this illusory nonrigid 3D motion might be\nattributed to perspective projection. Some retinal projections of 3D objects introduce shape\ndistortions that result in illusory percepts of false 3D shape (eg Griffiths and Zaidi 1998, 2000).\nLet us imagine that an observer is right in front of the near corner of the central building in a\nreal scene during an earthquake that shakes the Earth up and down. The physical vertical\ndisplacement would be the same for all points in the scene; but, because of motion parallax,\nthe retinal displacement of points on the near corner would be larger than far parts of the\ncentral building. By contrast, for an up-and-down translation of the 2-dimensional (2D)\nimage in this illusion the retinal vertical displacements of all points are the same. Thus,\nwhen the whole 2D scene moves upward, points on the near corner move at the same retinal\nspeed as points away from the corner, whereas they would move faster for a 3D scene; this\ndifference might cause the near corner to appear to wiggle down, as confirmed by viewers of\nthe illusion.\nFigure 2. (a) Line drawing version of the central building in figure 1 where perspective projection\ninduces illusory percept of a convex 3-dimensional (3D) corner; (b) control version of line arrays where\na 3D interpretation is less likely due to the deletion of corner angles by a gap; (c) same as in (a) but for\na concave 3D corner.\nFigure 2a is a line drawing version of the building projected in two-point per-\nspective. Figure 2b is a control variant where corner angles are made invisible by\na gap, and figure 2c presents a version where line segments form a concave angle\n(1)This translation can be obtained by scrolling figure 1 up and down on a computer screen. To get the\nstrongest impression of this illusion we recommend readers to drag the vertical scroll bar slider up\nand down with a mouse, rather than scrolling via the mouse wheel. The animations are also available\nonline (see text for details).\nin 3D depth. An animated version of figure 2 can be viewed in movie 2 (or see\nhttp://rci.rutgers.edu/ sungho4/movie2.mov). The perspective projection explanation\nseems unlikely because nonrigid 3D motion is shown not only in figure 2a but also in figures\n2b and 2c where the line pattern loses the 3D shape of convex corner angles. One difference\namong these figures is that nonrigid motion is likely to be perceived in 3D depth in figures 2a\nand 2c but not as strongly in figure 2b. To examine whether the nonrigid motion contributes\nto an enhanced 3D percept we asked sixteen naive observers to judge the strength of their\n3D percept for both static and dynamic versions of each stimulus in figure 1 and figure 2.\nAs shown in figure 3, translational motion increased significantly the appearance of a 3D\npercept as compared with a static image (p < 0.05 for each paired t-test), except for the\nstimulus in which the corner angles were deleted by a gap (p > 0.1).\nFigure 3. Three-dimensional (3D) percept rating (range 1\u00ad7) by sixteen naive observers for both static\nand moving displays of a convex angle (figure 2a), hidden convex angle (figure 2b), concave angle\n(figure 2c), and real scene (figure 1). The rating of 1 (minimum 3D percept) was illustrated by simple\nparallel horizontal lines moving up and down; the rating 7 (strongest 3D percept) was illustrated by an\nanimation sequence of a smoothly rotating 3D cube that gave a strong impression of a solid 3D object.\nError bars represent \u00b1 one standard error. n.s. = nonsignificant; * statistically significant differences,\nThese demonstrations suggest that the nonrigid illusory motion is related to a low-level\nmotion correspondence process, rather than to the 3D interpretation of 2D pictures, similar\nto the aliasing experienced in the classical wagon-wheel effect. In complex shapes or patterns\nthe mismatch between the global and local motion signals leads to an apparent loss of shape\nrigidity and deformation of the global pattern (Anstis 2003; Cohen et al 2010; Fantoni and\nPinna 2008; Gori et al 2010). In the present illusion there are mismatches between line\nsegments of different orientations across frames, which result in local rotational motion\neven though the physical trajectory of each line segment is purely translational. In figures\n1, 2a, and 2c, because two columns of line segments are connected and form corners, their\nsimultaneous rotation is more likely to be perceived in 3D depth than on a 2D plane, which\nresults in a nonrigid deformation of the 3D surface.\nIf the nonrigid motion is based on illusory rotational apparent motion of line segments, it\nshould be stronger for an image comprising a radial pattern of line segments; this is precisely\nthe case shown in figure 4a and movie 3 (or see http://rci.rutgers.edu/ sungho4/movie3.mov).\nWhen the image in figure 4 moves up and down spoke line segments rotate in the\nopposite direction to the global motion, giving the impression that two gears, coupled\nFigure 4. (a) As the image is translated up and down, it appears that two gears, coupled by a chain,\nrotate in opposite directions; (b) rainbow-colored version of figure 4a (see text for details).\nby a chain, rotate in opposite directions (clockwise and counterclockwise); it must be\npointed out that this figure does not produce a 3D percept. Figure 4b (see movie 4 or\nhttp://rci.rutgers.edu/ sungho4/movie4.mov) was suggested by Stuart Anstis, and it is a\nvariant of figure 4a; each line segment (spoke) is painted with the same rainbow color in each\nframe of the animation sequence, yet the animation elicits the percept of moving spokes that\nare accompanied by color changes. This suggests that the visual system does not track each\nline segment correctly but solves the motion correspondence problem by pairing \"nearest\nneighbors\" (Ullman 1979), producing featural (orientation and color) mismatches.\nThe illusions presented here provide an interesting case of illusory nonrigid motion\ninduced by patterns of converging line segments undergoing translational apparent motion,\nwhere the mismatch between global and local motion signals results in illusory rotation of\nthe microstructure of line orientations.\n"
