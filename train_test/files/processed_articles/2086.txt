We compared current (past 30-day) smok-\ning among US eighth-grade adolescents with smoking in\npopular movies.\nwith highest US box-office gross revenues4 were content\ncoded for tobacco use by 2 coders. Only tobacco use was\ncoded (90% was cigarette or cigar smoking). A smoking\noccurrence was counted whenever a movie character handled\nor used tobacco or when tobacco use was depicted in the\nbackground. A 10% subsample of movies was double-\ncoded (interrater correlation=0.96 for this outcome).\nCurrent smoking was obtained from the Monitoring the\nFuture survey,5 which has assessed smoking among US eighth\ngraders since 1991, with a study sample that ranged from\neach year during the study period. Smoking among eighth\ngraders was chosen because most studies linking movies with\nadolescent smoking involve teens in this age group.\nFigure.

Smoking among eighth graders increased in the early\nanalysis indicated that current smoking declined by an av-\nComment. There has been a significant decline in both\nmovie smoking in top US box-office hits and annual assess-\nments of smoking among US eighth graders since 1996. These\ntrends are consistent with a causal hypothesis and reported\nattributable risk figures. During the first 6 years of the pe-\nriod, movie smoking declined but youth smoking in-\ncreased. This could be the result of a lagged effect for the\nrelation between newly released movie smoking and ado-\nlescent current smoking, a possibility we could not assess\nbecause our data on movie smoking only go back to 1989.\nAdditionally, movie smoking represents only one of several\nfactors that contribute to youth smoking trends, including\nthe marketing of tobacco, price of cigarettes, restrictions im-\nposed by the Master Settlement Agreement in 1999, and state\ntobacco prevention programs. The main limitation of this\nstudy is that it is an ecological analysis and can only dem-\nonstrate association. Nonetheless, the downward trend in\nmovie smoking is consistent with an influence on down-\nward trends in adolescent smoking.\nJames D.

The study used the original protocol from the\noffice gross revenues for a total sample size of 125 movies.6\nMovies or scenes were excluded if they were animated, were\nnot set in the present day (within 10 years of a movie's re-\nlease), or were documentaries. The coding unit was person-\nscene, defined as a scene in which 1 person was involved in\nan activity with a firearm. Possession or handling of fire-\narms was recorded only for characters with speaking roles.\nStandardized data-collection forms were used, and movies\nwere watched in DVD format. Each movie was viewed si-\nmultaneously by 1 of 2 pairs of reviewers. A pilot was con-\nducted to ensure consistency and interrater reliability. Com-\nanalyzed by 2-sided 2 test for trend using EpiInfo version\n6 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Geor-\ngia) and Wilcoxon rank sum test using SAS version 9.1 (SAS\nInstitute, Cary, North Carolina). Clustering of person-\nscenes within movies was controlled for using SAS version\n9.1; because this had minimal effect, unadjusted results are\npresented. Differences were considered significant if P.05.\nteria for the study with 5 G-rated movies (7%) and 62 PG-\nrated (93%). Eighteen movies (27%) depicted characters with\nfirearms (TABLE). One hundred six person-scenes depicted\ncharacters with firearms, with a median of 4.5 person-\nscenes per movie (range, 1-22). Median (interquartile range)\nof the person-scenes with firearms.\nOf characters with firearms, 105 (99%) were adults and\nters (53%) with firearms were involved in law enforcement\n(eg, police officers or security guards); 38 (36%) were crimi-\nnals; and 12 (11%) were other characters (eg, homeown-\ners). Seventy-two person-scenes (68%) depicted charac-\nters handling firearms, and 56 person-scenes (53%) depicted\ncharacters making a threatening gesture with a firearm.\nTable.
