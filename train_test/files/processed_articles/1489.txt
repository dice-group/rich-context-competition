The limited research on smoking in China\nhas painted a grim picture: Holden argues that `if\ncurrent smoking patterns persist, tobacco will\ncause more than a third of all deaths among\nmiddle-aged Chinese men over the next few\ndecades' (Holden, 2001). Yang et al. predict that\nas the world's largest producer and consumer of\ntobacco, 2 of the 7 million deaths related to\nsmoking will occur in China (Yang et al., 1999).\nThe widely cited research by Yang et al. reveals\nthat smoking in China continues to be more\nprevalent among men than women, although\nthe age of smoking initiation has declined by\n~3 years for both men and women, from 28 to\nthat there is an urgent need for smoking\nprevention and cessation efforts in China, and\ntobacco control initiatives are needed to\nmaintain or decrease the currently low smoking\nprevalence among women. Using descriptive\nstatistics, Gong et al. studied the prevalence,\ncharacteristics and attitudes surrounding\nsmoking in the Minhang district of Shanghai\n(Gong et al., 1995). Their research showed that\n88.4% of respondents believed smoking was\nharmful for both the smoker and those exposed\npassively to the smoke, but only 14.1% of male\nsmokers reported a desire to quit smoking. The\nresearchers believed that the low quit rate and\nthe low desire to quit were two of the most\nserious problems among smokers.\nSun and Shun are among the few academics to\nhave studied smoking behavior across different\nKey words: adult smoking; smoking; smoking behavior; urban China\nSUMMARY\nA number of previous studies have documented the\nworsening smoking problems in China. This paper\nidentifies several key socioeconomic variables associated\nwith smoking among urban working adults and calls\nresearchers' attention to the important function of cigarette\nsmoking as a social connection builder in China. This study\nargues that a smoking prevention and education program\nshould place more emphasis on making smoking socially\nunnecessary and/or unacceptable because of the continuing\nincrease in the number of smokers and the low desire to\nquit among smokers. The findings also suggest that while\nsocioeconomic characteristics are excellent in predicting\nwhether a person smokes or not, they are dismal in\npredicting smoking frequency among working adults.\nSocioeconomic predictors of smoking and smoking\nfrequency in urban China: evidence of smoking\nas a social function\nSchool of Urban and Public Affairs, University of Louisville, KY, USA\nsocioeconomic groups in the Chinese work-\nplace (Sun and Shun, 1995). Their analysis of\ndifferences in predisposing factors, enabling\nfactors, reinforcing factors and smoking behav-\nior among white- and blue-collar workers in\nGuangzhou suggested that significant differences\nexist between these two groups of workers. They\nreported that white-collar workers exhibit more\npositive predisposing factors towards smoking\nand consume more cigarettes than blue-collar\nworkers.\nOn the other hand, Hesketh et al. and Li et al.\nfound a very low prevalence of regular smoking\namong Chinese youths from 12 to 19 years of\nstrongest factors associated with smoking among\nyouths were maternal smoking, paternal smok-\ning, smoking peers or friends, low paternal\neducational level and a poor self-reported\nacademic record. One interesting result is that\n75% of respondents said that they obtained\ncigarettes from home, and only 10% of youths\nobtained cigarettes through self-purchase. The\nattitudes of these youths were encouraging, with\n10% of them thinking that young smokers\nhave a tough or glamorous image, although\nsignificantly more of the current smokers thought\nthat smoking improves mood and increases con-\nfidence or popularity. In a separate study of\nsmoking among secondary school students in\nHenan, Zhang et al. reported that the likelihood\nof tobacco use was significantly higher among\nthose with peers, teachers or mothers who\nsmoked (Zhang et al., 2000). They also found that\npositive smoking-related attitudes among students\nhad a significant association with their smoking\nstatus. Again, the authors argued for a compre-\nhensive smoking prevention program in the early\nteen years so that it can be effective.\nXiang et al. examined cigarette smoking\namong medical college students in Wuhan,\nChina (Xiang et al., 1999). None of the female\nrespondents reported smoking on a regular\nbasis. The major reasons for first smoking were\nstress, curiosity and loneliness. Multivariate\nanalysis also revealed that having a family\nmember who smoked was significantly associated\nwith cigarette smoking for the students. Xiang\net al. argued that their research suggested a need\nto initiate comprehensive tobacco-use pre-\nvention programs among medical students\nFrom a global perspective, Peto et al. predicted\nthat the sharpest increase in smoking would be in\nChina and in early middle age (Peto et al., 1996).\nAbout 5% of women and 75% men in China are\noccasional or daily smokers, which prompted\nRichard et al. to claim that although `Chinese\nmen number 10% of the adults in the world',\nthey `smoke about 30% of the world's cigarettes'.\nAlthough a number of researchers have\nstudied smoking behaviors in China, current\nresearch has several weaknesses: First, the\nresearch mostly concentrates on special segments\nof China's population in specific cities, possibly\ndue to a lack of representative samples of the\nwhole population. Secondly, some of the research\nis only descriptive in nature and does not analyze\nthe relationship between smoking and other\ncontributing factors. Thirdly, previous research\ntends to jump quickly to the conclusion that a\ncomprehensive, effective prevention/education\nprogram is needed without providing detailed\nstrategies. Finally, although the smoking\nbehavior of youth has drawn some attention\nfrom scholars, the smoking behavior of adults has\nnot been adequately studied in China. Even\nthough previous research has identified gender\nand occupation as important factors associated\nwith whether an adult smokes or not, the typical\nsocial and economic characteristics of adult\nsmokers have not been adequately identified\nand explained. This study attempts to identify\nthe typical socioeconomic characteristics associ-\nated with cigarette smoking and daily smoking\nfrequency of the urban working population\nin China.\nMETHODS\nData\nA nationally representative sample based on\nthe Household Income Project in 1995 in urban\nChina was used for this study. The principal\ninvestigators (Khan and Riskin, 2001, Riskin\net al., 2001) claim that the data set is one of the\nbest available to examine urban China\nnationwide. Only a few cases have missing values\nfor some of the key variables and the missing\nvalues are replaced with the mean of each\nvariable. It should be noted that the data set is\nonly representative of the official urban residents\nin urban China (Riskin et al., 2001). The so-called\n`floating' population, or migrants to the city from\nrural areas, were not included in the data\ncollection.\nDependent variables\nTwo dependent variables were used for this\nstudy: the first was smoking (the respondent\nsmokes regularly = 1, no = 0) and the second was\ndaily smoking frequency (number of cigarettes\nsmoked per day). Logistic regression was used to\nanalyze the predictors of whether the\nrespondents smoke or not, while ordinary least\nsquare regression was used to analyze the\nrelationships between socioeconomic predictors\nand daily smoking frequency.\nIndependent variables\n1. Continuous variables\nContinuous variables included in the analyses\nwere: age of the respondent, years of working\nexperience, years spent in present job (measure-\nment of work commitment), urban residence\ntenure (measuring the number of years since the\nrespondent obtained official urban residence, or\nHukou), Party membership tenure (a measure of\nseniority within the Party), number of persons in\nthe household (household size), total family\nfinancial assets (the total cash value in Yuan or\nRMB of the financial assets owned by each\nrespondent's family), total family disposable\nincome in Yuan, and the average income of\nincome variables were constructed so that the\neffects of individual and family income could be\nassessed. This study also considered the estimated\nminimum living standard, which was measured by\nestimating the amount of money in Yuan that the\nhousehold required to maintain a minimum\nstandard of living. This variable was included in\nthe model to adjust the regional differences in the\ncost of living, which may potentially affect\nsmoking behavior.\n2. Dummy variables\nDichotomous (dummy) variables included in this\nstudy were: female (yes = 1, no = 0); married\n(married = 1, no = 0); work unit owned by the\nstate (yes = 1, no = 0); permanent employee\n(permanent employee = 1, no = 0) (permanent\nemployees enjoyed a number of benefits and\nsome prestige that others could not obtain in the\nprevious planned economy); and educated youth\n(yes = 1, no = 0). With respect to this variable, a\nlarge number of young students was sent to\ncountry villages to help with agricultural\noperations during the Cultural Revolution from\ncame back to the city after the Cultural\nRevolution. These people experienced the\ndramatic event of the Cultural Revolution during\nthe Chairman Mao era and this variable was\nincluded to test if these people were more likely\nto smoke than others. Other dummy variables\nincluded in this study were: public-financed\nhealth care (health care financed by the state or\ngovernment = 1, other = 0) (recent health care\nreform has cut health care benefits for many\nemployees, therefore smoking behavior may\ndiffer along this variable); and work indoors\n(yes = 1, no = 0) (a simple measure of work\nenvironment).\n3. Scale variables\nThe first scale variable used in this study was\noccupational rank of primary employment.\nThis scale was a rank of primary employment\naccording to the Chinese Census Bureau\ndefinition. A score of 9 represented the head of a\nbusiness or major government or business\nbranch, and a score of 1 represented an unskilled\nworker. This variable was designed to examine\nthe relationship between occupational rank and\nwhether the respondent smoked or not. The\nsecond scale variable was an educational scale\nfor the respondents. This variable ranged from\n1\u00ad7, representing the different levels of educa-\ntion attained by the respondents (1 = illiterate/\nsemi-illiterate, 7 = college or better education).\nEach scale increase represented ~3 years increase\nin education. This approximate measure of\nrespondent education was used to test if educa-\ntion impacted significantly upon the probability\nof smoking.\nAnalysis\nAs mentioned before, logistic regression was\nused to analyze the dichotomized dependent\nvariable, while linear regression was used to\nanalyze daily smoking frequency. Since logistic\nregression analysis revealed that Communist\nParty membership had a powerful positive\ninfluence on whether the respondent smoked or\nnot, Communist Party members were selected\nfrom the sample and the predictors of smoking\nwere also analyzed and presented in Table 2. The\nDiscussion will focus on the Exp(B) coefficients\nbecause these coefficients are much easier to\nunderstand and give an intuitive understanding\nSocioeconomic predictors of smoking in China 311\nof not only the direction of impacts, but also the\nstrength of the impacts of the independent\nvariables. The impact of an independent variable\nis positive if the Exp(B) coefficient is 1 and\nnegative if it is 1.\nRESULTS\nFrom Table 1 we can see that only 8% of smokers\nwere female, 89.1% of smokers were married,\nhad public-financed health care and 90% were\npermanent employees rather than contracted\nworkers. In addition, 76% of smokers had\ngovernment-assigned jobs, which carry a number\nof benefits and some social prestige.\nIn Table 2, logistic regression for all working\nrespondents suggested that females were much\nless likely to smoke in urban China as indicated\nby the extremely small Exp(B) coefficient for the\nfemale variable. The older urban residents\ntended to be less likely to smoke, as indicated by\nthe negative impact of the age variable.\nThe large Exp(B) coefficient of the marital\nstatus variable suggested that being married\nsignificantly increased the likelihood of smoking\nby the respondent, as did Communist Party mem-\nbership. Those who were permanent employees,\nworked in state-owned enterprises, and had\ngovernment-assigned jobs were more likely to be\nsmokers than others. On the other hand, having\nmore education, a higher minimum living\nstandard and an indoor job tended to decrease\nthe likelihood of smoking by respondents.\nAmong the Communist Party members,\nfemales and older respondents had a smaller\nlikelihood of smoking than others. Interestingly,\nCommunist Party membership tenure, higher\nemployment rank and urban residence tenure\ndecreased the probability of smoking among the\nParty members, suggesting that the older Party\nmembers with greater seniority, either for health\nreasons or others, had a better lifestyle in terms\nof smoking. However, working in state-owned\nenterprises and having longer work experience\ntended to increase the probability of smoking.\nSimilar to the general working adults, a higher\nestimated living standard decreased the\nlikelihood of smoking among Party members.\nThe last statistical model examined the\nsocioeconomic factors associated with daily\nsmoking frequency among smokers in urban\nChina. The OLS regression results indicated that\nmarriage increased the number of cigarettes\nsmoked by the respondents. Greater education\nsignificantly reduced the number of cigarettes\nsmoked. Interestingly, although total financial\nTable 1: Means of all variables for different groups\nAll working respondents Party members Smokers\nassets and individual income were not significant\nfactors associated with whether the respondents\nsmoked or not, higher total family financial\nassets reduced the amount of smoking, while\naverage individual income increased the number\nof cigarettes smoked daily.\nDISCUSSION\nThe logistic regression results confirm previous\nresearch that men are much more likely to smoke\nthan women in China, but the findings also lead\nto several other interesting conclusions. First,\nsmokers are much more likely to belong to some\nspecial segments of the population. The\nsignificant effects of the variables suggest that\nsmokers are most likely to be male, married,\nCommunist Party members, permanent emplo-\nyees, and workers in state-owned enterprises.\nPrevious research (Pan, 2004) has suggested that\nthese socioeconomic characteristics are strongly\nassociated with various benefits such as house\nownership, better housing location and housing\nquality from employer or government in the\nplanned or transitional economy.\nSecondly, the contrast between the high `%\ncorrect' value of logistic regression and the\ndismally low adjusted r2 of the OLS regression\nmodel suggests that whether a person smokes or\nnot is strongly associated with socioeconomic\nfactors, while the amount smoked is probably\ndetermined by other factors, such as the length of\nsmoking history, the amount of pressure or stress\nin life, the affordability of smoking, etc.\nThirdly, some researchers may be tempted to\nconclude from the findings that those with\ncharacteristics associated with various benefits\nand prestige in the planned economy and/or\ntransition economy are more likely than others\nto smoke because they can afford to. Or they\nsmoke because they have better access to\ncigarettes since packs of expensive cigarettes are\nfrequently offered to them as gifts or bribery.\nThese explanations are certainly valid to some\nextent. But the statistically non-significant effects\nof total family financial assets, total family\ndisposable income and average individual\nSocioeconomic predictors of smoking in China 313\nTable 2: Logistic and OLS regression of factors affecting smoking and daily smoking frequency\nIndependent variables All working respondents Party members Smokers\nB Exp(B) B Exp(B) B \n(F value)\n(r2 value)\nincome in the logistic regression models imply\nthat whether a person smokes or not doesn't\ndiffer significantly along these `money' variables.\nThis study contends that smoking may be better\nattributed to the special social function it serves\nin Chinese culture. In China, smoking serves\nan important social function: the connection\nbuilder. When people meet each other, it is a\ncustom for everyone to offer cigarettes to signal\nrespect and hospitality. Among known friends or\nacquaintances, cigarette offering is equally\nprevalent and important, and serves the function\nof reinforcing friendships or relationships.\nFor a non-smoker, it is very easy to suffer the\nagony and even humiliation of not accepting\nsomeone's polite but pushy offer of a cigarette\nbecause Chinese culture accepts repeated\nofferings of cigarettes as a gesture of hospitality.\nIt is unknown how many Chinese adults choose\nnot to quit smoking because of the advantage\nsmoking brings directly or indirectly in their daily\ninteractions with bosses, friends and potential\nconnections. This study argues that the people\nwho are married, Communist Party members,\npermanent employees and state-owned enter-\nprise employees tend to be more likely to smoke\nbecause they are more heavily influenced by the\ntraditional culture of building and using\nconnections than others in the transitional\neconomy. Connections are much more important\nfor these people because most of the benefits\nthey receive, including housing benefits, are\nobtained through the influence of their connec-\ntions within their work units. Bian explained in\ndetail how connection (Guanxi) works in the job\nallocation process in the planned and transitional\neconomy in China, and the importance of\nconnection in daily life since, as Bian argues, the\nChinese live in a web of social relations that\noften determine the attainment and allocation of\nvarious resources (Bian, 1994). A byproduct of\nthe unique culture of using cigarettes as\nconnection builders is a group of adults that this\nstudy defines as `social smokers': those who only\nsmoke around their friends or others when\ncigarettes are offered because they feel they have\nto use smoking as a gesture of maintaining their\nfriendships so they don't hurt the `feelings' and\ndamage the delicate `relationships' among their\nfriends, even though they have decided to quit\nsmoking on any other occasion due to emerging\nsmoking-related health problems.\nSmoking prevention is a monumental task\nfacing the Chinese authorities unless they can\nmake cigarette offerings both socially unnec-\nessary and/or unacceptable. Researchers (Gong\nTomlinson, 1997) have called for smoking\nprevention programs in China; however, efforts\nso far have neither made smoking a social taboo\nnor convinced smokers to quit. This study argues\nthat future smoking prevention in China may use\ndifferent strategies for the two groups: on the\none hand, adult smoking prevention/reduction\nprograms should place a heavy emphasis on\neducating the public about the potential harm of\nthe cigarette offering `custom' and on making it\nsocially both unnecessary and unacceptable.\nSpecific efforts should be made to maintain the\nvery low prevalence of smoking among women.\nOn the other hand, the smoking prevention/\nreduction programs for Chinese youth should\nplace more emphasis on the bad image of\nsmokers, since previous research has identified\nlow rates of smoking among youth, alongside a\nlow proportion of young people thinking that\nsmokers have a tough and glamorous image (Li\nboth initiation at an early age and the necessity\nof smoking for adults, future tobacco use in\nChina may be much lower than it is today.\nImplication of this study\nIt is unknown how many Chinese adults started\nsmoking because they could not turn down the\nrepeated offer of cigarettes from friends or\nstrangers they met. It is also unknown to what\nextent the low desire to quit smoking is the result\nof the need to remain a regular or `social' smoker\nfor social reasons. The significance of this study is\nthat it brings our attention to the importance of\nculture and custom in strategy formulation to\nprevent smoking in China, where smoking serves\na crucial social function in daily interactions.\nBecause of the importance of culture in smok-\ning prevention, future research should try to\nexamine the underlying reasons for smoking\ninitiation and the low desire to quit among adults\nso that coping strategies can be more effective.\nAs Yang et al. point out, smoking-related\nillnesses and deaths will probably only occur in\nthe coming decades in China (Yang et al., 1999).\nUnless effective prevention and reduction\nprograms are implemented, the sheer size of\nChina's smoking population will create grave\nconsequences for the country's health care\nsystem.\n"
