This approach is\nfounded on 2 main assumptions: that adult body weight scales\napproximately as height2 (2, 3) and that once weight is adjusted\nfor height2, adults within each sex group have approximately the\nsame proportion of body weight as fat, independent of height (2,\n5, 6). This critical second assumption implies that fat and related\nfat-free mass (FFM) (ie, weight 2 fat) also scale similar to\nweight as approximately height2. Despite the importance of this\nhypothesis, few studies have examined how fat and fat-free mass\n(FFM) scale to height, particularly in a large well-defined\nsample with a broad range of characteristics as might apply in\nthe general population. In addition, new and improved methods\nare providing estimates of these 2 compartments among pop-\nulations and in individuals with the expanded use of body-\ncomposition indexes (fat/height2 and FFM/height2) aimed at con-\ntrolling for between-subject differences in height (7, 8).\nRecent small-scale studies suggest that FFM and related\nskeletal muscle and bone mineral mass scale to height with\npowers approximating 2 (2). Bone mineral, a measure of skeletal\nweight, tended to scale minimally higher to height than FFM and\nskeletal muscle mass in these studies (2), although the differ-\nences in power were not large (ie, height'2.3 compared with\nheight'2.0). In support of this observation, mammalian skeletal\nweight scales approximately as weight1.1 and predicts that hu-\nman bone mineral will scale to height with powers larger than\nthose for FFM and skeletal muscle mass (9). Fat mass in these\nsmall studies did not scale significantly to height, and there is no\nphysiologic basis for the presence of a significant association\nbetween percentage body weight as fat and stature (2, 5, 6). On\nthe assumption that percentage of body weight as fat is in-\ndependent of height, fat mass should then also scale as height2.\nThe 2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES) included body-composition measurements by dual-\nenergy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) on a large and diverse\nsample of noninstitutionalized US adults and children (10, 11).\nThese recently released observations provide the important op-\nportunity to critically test the hypothesis that fat, FFM, and bone\nmineral scale approximately as height2 in a large and diverse\nsample representative of the US population. Our focus was to\ntest this hypothesis in adult (age 18 y) NHANES participants.\nExperimental design\nDetails about the DXA system and the measurement procedure\nare provided elsewhere (7, 10, 11). The DXA body-composition\ndata were adjusted before release as previously reported (http://\n1 From the Pennington Biomedical Research Center, Baton Rouge, LA\n(SBH); the Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Albert Einstein\nCollege of Medicine, New York, NY (MH); the Department of Mathematical\nSciences, Montclair State University, Montclair, NJ (DT); and the Pediatric\nUnit, Verona University Medical School, Verona, Italy (AP).\n2 No external support was provided for the design, implementation, anal-\nysis, or interpretation of the data presented in the current study.\n3 Address correspondence to SB Heymsfield, Pennington Biomedical Re-\nheymsfield@pbrc.edu.\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nwww.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/dxx/dxa.htm; page 9). Adjustment of\nthe body-composition values, as was done for the NHANES data,\nhad no effect on the outcome of the height powers as reported in\nthe current study. The NHANES study group collected the whole-\nbody DXA data using 3 mobile examination centers between\nDisease Control and Prevention website (http://www.cdc.gov/\nnchs/nhanes.htm). The present study sample included all adults\naged 18 y who had complete demographic information (sex,\nage, weight, height, and race). Women were excluded from the\nDXA examination if they had a positive pregnancy test at the\ntime of the evaluation or were currently pregnant. Both men and\nwomen were excluded if their reported weight or height ex-\ninches (196 cm), respectively. The 3 largest NHANES race\ngroupings were analyzed and included non-Hispanic whites,\nnon-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican Americans. We analyzed the\nbody-composition scaling relations to height within each sex\nand race group with exclusion of the other smaller race cate-\ngories. Three components were evaluated in the current analysis\nin addition to body weight, fat mass, FFM, and bone mineral\ncontent. We also included an analysis of bone mineral density as\nmeasured by DXA.\nStatistical methods\nFor all statistical analyses, we took into account sampling\nstrata, primary sampling units, and sampling weights, which are\nelements of the multistage cluster sampling design of NHANES\nIII (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm). In particular, the\nwere reassessed in accordance with the NHANES data analysis\nguideline (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/nhanes_03_04/\nnhanes_analytic_guidelines_dec_2005.pdf). We applied SAS\nPROC SURVEYMEANS for descriptive statistics and SAS\nPROC SURVEYREG for the allometric modeling (SAS Institute,\nCary, NC). Furthermore, a large portion of the NHANES DXA\nmeasurement data were missing and were thus imputed 5 times\nby the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS; http://www.\ncdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/dxx/dxa.htm); we applied descriptive sta-\ntistics and the allometric modeling to each imputed data set,\nwhich yielded 5 results for each analysis. These 5 results were\npooled into a single final result for each analysis based on the\npooling method proposed by Rubin (12).\nThe age-adjusted association between body weight and body-\ncomposition measures with height can be described by the\nallometric model Y = aXbc, where Y is the outcome, X is the\npredictor variable (ie, height), b is the scaling exponent (ie,\npower), Z is the age covariate with power c, and a is the pro-\nportionality constant (13). The simple allometric model can be\nexpressed in logarithmic form as loge\nY = loge\na + bloge\nX + c\nloge\nZ + e, where e is the error term. Weight and body-\ncomposition measures, expressed in loge\nform, were set as\ndependent variables and height and age as independent varia-\nbles in the regression models. Five values are presented\nfor each developed multiple regression model: a (intercept), b\n(height), c (age), R2, and P value. We also present height\npowers 6 SE in the text for the evaluated measures within each\nsex and race group. Subject demographic characteristics are\npresented as means 6 SEMs. Statistical significance was de-\nclared when a 2-sided P value was ,0.05.\nRESULTS\nSubjects\nThe characteristics of the subjects at baseline are shown in\ncans. The non-Hispanic white men were older than the other 2\ngroups of men, whereas the Mexican American men were\nshorter than the other 2 groups of men. The 3 groups of men had\nMexican Americans. A similar age and height pattern was\npresent across the 3 race groups of women, as was observed in\nthe men. The non-Hispanic black women had the highest group\nmean BMI ('31), the Mexican American women had an in-\ntermediate BMI ('29), whereas the non-Hispanic white women\nhad a mean BMI similar to that of the men ('28). Although the\nactual number of included subjects depends on the outcome\nvariables because of missing data (for some subjects, even im-\nputation was not considered reasonable), only a small number of\nsubjects (,2%) were excluded from the analysis for every\ncombination of sex, race, and body-composition measure.\nSubject characteristics1\nAge Weight Height BMI Fat FFM BMC BMD\ny kg cm kg/m2 kg kg g g/cm2\nMen\nWomen\n1 All values are means 6 SEMs. BMC, bone mineral content; BMD, bone mineral density; FFM, fat-free mass; MEX, Mexican American; NHB, non-\nHispanic black; NHW, non-Hispanic white.

The powers of height for weight and the 3 body\ncompartments are shown in Figure 1 for the sex and race groups.\nMost of the measures, as is also evident in Table 2, scaled ap-\nproximately at or modestly above or below a height power of 2.\nOnly one height power reached 3: fat mass in Mexican Amer-\nican men.\nThe 95% CIs for the powers of height are also presented in\nFigure 1. The 95% CIs for 7 of 12 measures in women included\na height power of 2, whereas the 95% CI for 4 of the 12 measures\nin men included a height power of 2. The 95% CIs for bone\nmineral content ranged between 1.9 and 2.6 and had the smallest\n95% CI among the measures. Fat had the largest 95% CI for the\npower of height, ranging between 1.2 and 3.6. Of the 24 total\nmeasures, 22 rounded to 2 as the nearest integer. Of the 18 body-\ncomposition measures, 16 rounded to 2 as the nearest integer.\nThe powers observed for fat and FFM scaled to height tended\nto track with each other and, as expected, with powers of body\nweight scaled to height (Table 2). For example, the lowest power\nof weight scaled to height was observed for non-Hispanic white\nwomen (1.72) who also had the lowest model power of FFM\n(1.86) and the lowest power for fat (1.51).

All of the\nDISCUSSION\nThe current study explored the scaling of body weight and\ncomposition to height in a large, carefully collected database\nincluding 3 race groups of adult NHANES subjects. After\nadjusting for age and applying the simple allometric model, we\nfound that body weight and body composition for most sex and\nrace groups scaled to height, with powers at or modestly above\na value of 2. These observations confirm and extend the findings\nof several earlier smaller studies (2, 3, 6). Body composition--\nnotably fat, FFM, and bone mineral content--thus scale to height,\nwith powers approximately similar to those observed for body\nweight. As expected, the highly variable fat mass compartment\nhad the weakest model associations with height (R2 = 0.1\u00ad0.2)\nwhereas stronger model correlations were observed between\nFFM and bone mineral content with height (R2 = 0.2\u00ad0.4).\nWhereas these generalities prevail, notable exceptions were\nobserved within the 6 sex and race groups. The powers of height\nobserved for men across body weight and composition tended to\nscale somewhat higher than those for women--an observation\nmade earlier by others (2, 3, 14). Fat mass scaled to height in\nMexican American men with a power of '3, which strongly\ninfluenced the observed power of weight scaled to height (2.5).\nThe effect of fat scaling on body weight scaling occurs because\nthe power of weight scaled to height reflects the weighted\npowers of fat and FFM. Moreover, FFM is tethered with fat\nmass, and the 2 increase according to the \"companionship\" rule\nfirst described by Forbes (14). Thus, the powers of height for all\n3 measures (weight, fat, and FFM) tended to group together\nwithin each sex and race group as shown Table 2.\nThe scaling of weight and body composition to height as\nexamined in our report and earlier studies are based on empirical\ncorrelations (6, 15). A volumetric or \"isometric\" expansion of\nindividual body compartments and the sum of all compartments\nwith greater height would yield powers approximating 3 (15).\nInclusion of children older than '8 y with adults in these kinds\nof analyses provides powers in the range of 3 and several weight\nindexes other than BMI incorporate height3 elements (6).\nHowever, maximal correlations were observed between adult\nadiposity and weight/height2 compared with these other meas-\nures, as first reported by Keys et al (1) and largely confirmed in\nseveral other studies (2, 3). However, the height power of 2 is\nnot a hard-and-fast rule, as shown by the Mexican American\nmen in the current study. Within that group, optimal scaling of\nfat mass to height would approach powers closer to 3 than to 2.\nMoreover, fat/height2 would not be independent of height in the\nMexican American men; rather, tall Mexican American men in\nNHANES have a greater fat/height2 and percentage fat than do\ntheir short counterparts. The reason that percentage fat also\nscales positively to height in the Mexican American men is\nbecause percentage fat resolves to fat/weight and fat } H'3,\nweight } height'2.5, and thus percentage fat (ie, fat/weight) }\nAs with FFM as a whole, bone mineral content models were\nsignificantly associated with height and included height powers in\nthe narrow range of '2.1\u00ad2.4. Our original expectation, based\non an earlier study (2), was that bone mineral content would\nscale to height with powers greater than those for body weight\nand FFM. Whereas to some extent that was the case, bone\nmineral content height scaling powers appeared largely un-\nrelated to the larger FFM compartment and body weight as\na whole. The skeleton, of which bone mineral is a major and\nreasonably constant fractional component (16), may thus be the\nbody compartment with the strongest link to adult height and\na stable compartment with slow turnover compared with soft\ntissue compartments. For example, at least in the short term,\nbone mineral content remains largely unchanged, even with\nsubstantial voluntary loss of body weight (17).\nBone mineral density, while not a major focus of the current\nstudy, also was larger with greater adult height across all sex and\nrace groups. Areal bone mineral density, as measured by DXA, is\ncalculated as bone mineral content divided by bone area. Our\nfindings thus suggest that bone mineral content and bone mineral\narea scale differently to height, with the result that areal bone\nmineral density increases with greater stature. For example, our\nmodel for 50-y-old non-Hispanic white women predicts a bone\n(6 SD) bone mineral density in this group of women is 1.10 6\n0.10. Similar observations were reported by Kelley et al (7),\nwhich are also based on the NHANES database. If and how this\ncalculated bone mineral density relates to actual physical\nproperties of bone and fracture risk remains uncertain.\nWith respect to the validity of the regression model after the\nlog transformation, we visually inspected Studentized residual\nplots against both predicted values and loge\n(age). Although these\nresiduals were obtained ignoring the complex sampling design\nof the NHANES data, the linearity assumptions underlying the\nregression model appeared to be well supported for every out-\ncome variable of loge\n(Y) across sex and race. Furthermore,\nStudentized residual plots against loge\n(age) did not show any\nprominent nonlinear pattern supporting the linear relation be-\ntween ln(Y) and ln(age) in particular. In addition, although the\nregression models can be extended to test whether the exponents\nof height are significantly different across sex and race, this\ntesting was not the main objective of the present study. This test\nshould, however, be a separate future study topic.\nImplications\nIn a classic article, Benn (5) suggested adjusting weight for\nheight as weight/heightp, with the exponent value of p specific to\nthe population of interest. Whereas the powers of height shown in\nTable 2 could be used for this purpose when applied to body\ncompartments, the high variability of p values makes this ap-\nproach impractical on a large scale. Moreover, the values of\np may not always be known, as in the case of studying or clini-\ncally managing a small sample of non-US adults. A simple and\npractical alternative is to round powers to the nearest integer,\nwhich would be a value of 2 for 16 of 18 body-composition\nmeasures across sex and race groups based on the current study\nfindings (Figure 1). This assumption is the basis of BMI and,\nnotably, when weight is scaled to height not all powers are\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nexactly 2 as shown in Figure 1 and Table 2. The main penalty of\nassuming a power of 2 when the compartment of interest scales\nto heights . or ,2 is shown graphically in Figure 2 for the non-\nHispanic white men. The correlation coefficients for fat/Hp\n(unadjusted for age) compared with height were derived in in-\ncrements of 0.2 between powers of 1.4 and 4. The developed\nnonage-adjusted regression line crosses the horizontal axis at the\npower (ie, value of p) of '1.7, indicating the approximate value\nof p that makes fat/Hp independent of height. Values of p above\nor below this critical power will produce fat mass indexes that\ncorrelate positively or negatively with height. This effect would\nintroduce bias into body composition\u00adheight indexes, and the\nimportance of this effect would need to be considered with each\nspecific application. Similarly, BMI is significantly correlated\nwith height in these men, although only after adjustment for age\n(r for BMI compared with height: 0.025; NS; with age added to\ncovariate significant at 0.01). A balance could be struck between\nexpedience with rounding of powers to the nearest whole integer\nfor population use as with BMI (ie, height2) and accuracy by\nadjusting between-subject differences in body composition for\nheight in small-scale research studies by using statistical ap-\nproaches such as regression analysis.\nConclusions\nThe 2004 NHANES database provided, in the current study,\na unique opportunity to critically examine the scaling of 3 major\nbody compartments (fat, FFM, and bone mineral content) to\nheight. The 3 compartments generally scale similarly, with\nseveral exceptions, as body weight does to height with powers\nranging between '2 and 2.5. Powers within sex and race groups\ntended to rank similarly for fat and FFM, and thus body weight,\nas would be expected based on Forbes' companionship rule\n(14). Our findings have implications for developing height-\nnormalized body-composition indexes, with 2 main potential\noptions: divide body compartment mass by Hp, with population-\nspecific values of p applied as defined in Table 2; round powers\nfor practical application to the nearest whole number, which\nfor most (16 of 18) of the evaluated body-composition measures\nis a value of 2. Although the second approach is simple, it\nis limited by the introduction of height bias in the height-\nnormalized index of interest, the importance of which needs to\nbe judged on the specific application.\nThe authors' responsibilities were as follows--SBH (Principal Investiga-\ntor): design, analysis, and article preparation; MH: data collection, data anal-\nysis, and article preparation; DT: analysis and article preparation; and AP:\ndata collection, data analysis, and article preparation.
