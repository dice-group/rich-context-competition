Aliskiren was infused for two weeks. Human proximal tubular epi-\nthelial cell lines (HK-2) were cultured with gentamicin in the absence or presence of aliskiren. Inflammatory profibrotic\nand apoptotic markers were evaluated in vivo and in vitro. Aliskiren treatment attenuated the decreased creatinine\nclearance, increased fractional sodium excretion, glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis and counteracted the\nincreased ED-1 expression in gentamicin-treated rats. The levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-, IL-1 and IFN-)\nand adhesion molecules (MCP-1, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1) increased in the gentamicin-treated kidneys. These changes\nwere restored by aliskiren co-treatment. Aliskiren effectively reversed transforming growth factor--induced fibrotic\nresponses such as induction of -smooth muscle actin in gentamicin-treated rat kidneys. Along with these changes, aliski-\nren also attenuated the increase in nuclear factor B and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK 1/2)\nlevels in HK-2 cells cultured with gentamicin. In addition, aliskiren decreased the number of TUNEL-positive nuclei and\nreduced the expression of proapoptotic markers in gentamicin-treated HK-2 cells. These findings suggest that aliskiren\nattenuates gentamicin-induced nephropathy by suppression of inflammatory, profibrotic and apoptotic factors through\ninhibition of the nuclear factor B, Smads and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways.\n",

Furthermore, infiltrating\nmacrophages can produce profibrotic cytokines such as\ntransforming growth factor (TGF)-1, which plays a cru-\ncial role in progressive renal fibrosis.3,4\nMultiple signaling pathways are thought to mediate\nthese inflammatory and fibrotic processes in progressive\nrenal diseases. One of these pathways, the nuclear factor\nB (NF-B) pathway, is known to regulate the expression\nof numerous genes involved in inflammation and cell pro-\nliferation. Thus, it is thought to be a key transcription factor\nthat can mediate acute and chronic inflammation by regu-\nlating the gene expression of cytokines, chemokines and\nadhesion molecules and consequently cause apoptosis and\ninterstitial fibrosis in progressive renal disease.5,6\nAdditionally, in vitro studies have suggested that activa-\ntion of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)\npathway also plays a critical role in the proliferation of\ntubular epithelial and myofibroblast-like cells.7 Mitogen-\nactivated protein kinases (MAPKs) use three parallel signal\nRenoprotective effects of the direct renin\ninhibitor aliskiren on gentamicin-induced\nnephrotoxicity in rats\nEun Hui Bae1, In Jin Kim2, Soo Yeon Joo2, Eun Young Kim2,\nJoon Seok Choi1, Chang Seong Kim1, Seong Kwon Ma1,\nJongUn Lee2 and Soo Wan Kim1\n Keywords\nAliskiren, apoptosis, fibrosis, gentamicin, inflammation\nDepartment of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University\nMedical School, Gwangju, Korea\nPhysiology, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju,\nKorea\nCorresponding author:\nSoo Wan Kim, Department of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National\nEmail: skimw@chonnam.ac.kr\nOriginal Article\ntransduction pathways. Cell proliferation is triggered via\ntransient ERK activation and differentiation is triggered via\nsustained ERK activation; however, the exact role of the\nERK signaling pathway in progressive renal disease\nremains to be determined. GM also directly activates apop-\ntotic genes and increases apoptosis in tubular and intersti-\ntial cells, resulting in tubular atrophy.8\nThe autocrine and paracrine activities of the tissue\nrenin\u00adangiotensin system (RAS) are important modulators\nof the structure and function of a number of organs and\nsystems, including the heart, kidneys, vasculature and skel-\netal muscle.9 Aliskiren, a low molecular weight, nonpep-\ntide, direct renin inhibitor (DRI), which has demonstrated\ntargeted organ protection in various animal models,10,11 is\nnow available for treating human hypertension.12 However,\nit is not known whether aliskiren treatment in GM-induced\nnephropathy leads to organ protection.\nIn this study, we investigated the effects of aliskiren on\nGM-induced nephropathy; to elucidate its mechanism of\naction, we examined the effect of aliskiren on renal inflam-\nmation, fibrosis and apoptosis after GM-induced renal\ninjury.\nMaterials and methods\nAnimals\nused. The experimental procedure conformed to the\nInstitutional Guidelines for Experimental Animal Care and\nUse. The rats were treated with GM (100 mg/kg per day,\nintramuscularly (IM)) alone, GM with aliskiren (Novartis,\nUSA, 25 mg/kg per day) using osmotic minipumps (mod-\ndays. The rats were maintained individually in the meta-\nbolic cages for the last three days to allow urine collections\nfor the measurement of Na+ and creatinine. On the day of\nthe experiment, under anesthesia with isoflurane, blood\nsamples were collected from the inferior vena cava and\nanalyzed for Na+ and creatinine. The right kidney was rap-\nidly removed and processed for immunoblotting as\ndescribed below. The left kidney was fixed via retrograde\nperfusion for immunohistochemistry.\nIn another set of experiments, the rats were decapitated\nunder a conscious state and the kidneys were removed and\nkept at -70\u00b0C until assayed for mRNA expression by\nreverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)\nand real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR).\nMeasurement of GM concentration in whole\nkidney\nGM was extracted from renal tissues by using a sodium\nhydroxide (NaOH) extraction method. Briefly, 300 l of\nphosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was added to the tube, and\nthe contents were homogenized. The homogenizer was\nrinsed with another 300 l of PBS, which was pooled with\nthe original homogenate. An equal volume of 2M NaOH\nwas added to the homogenate, and the mixture was incu-\nbated at 70\u00b0C for 20 min. Samples were centrifuged at\nneutralized to pH 7.0 before GM concentration was meas-\nured. GM concentrations were determined using a fluores-\nCell culture and application of GM and\naliskiren to HK-2 cells\nAn immortalized proximal tubule epithelial cell line from\nHK-2 was purchased from the American Type Culture\nCollection (Manassas, VA, USA) and cultured. Briefly,\ncells were passaged every 3\u00ad4 days in 100-mm dishes\n(Falcon, Bedford, MA, USA) using Dulbecco's modified\nEagle's medium-F12 (Sigma Chemical Co., St Louis, MO,\nUSA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life\nTechnologies Inc., Gaithersburg, MD, USA), insulin-trans-\nferrin-sodium selenite media supplement (Sigma Chemical\nml streptomycin (Sigma Chemical Co., St Louis, MO,\nUSA). These cells were incubated in a humidified atmos-\nat 70\u00ad80% confluence. For experimental use, HK-2 cells\nwere plated onto 60-mm dishes in medium containing 10%\nfetal bovine serum for 24 h and cells were then switched to\nDulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-F12 with 2% fetal\nbovine serum for 16 h. These cells were treated with GM\n(0.5 and 1.0 mg/ml) in the presence or absence of aliskiren\n(50 and 100 nmol). Control cells received buffer only\ninstead of GM or aliskiren. The cells were harvested at the\nend of the treatment for further analysis.\nSemiquantitative immunoblotting\nThe dissected kidney was homogenized in ice-cold\nisolation solution containing 0.3 M sucrose, 25 mM\nimidazole, 1 mM EDTA, 8.5 \u00b5M leupeptin, 1 mM phe-\nnylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.2. The homogenates\nwhole cells, nuclei and mitochondria. The total protein\nconcentration was measured (Pierce BCA protein assay\nreagent kit, Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). All samples\nwere adjusted with isolation solution to reach the same\nfinal protein concentrations and solubilized at 65\u00b0C for\n15 min in SDS-containing sample buffer and then stored\nat \u00ad20\u00b0C. To confirm equal loading of protein, an initial\ngel was stained with Coomassie blue. Sodium dodecyl\nsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed\non 9 or 12% polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were\ntransferred by gel electrophoresis (Bio-Rad Mini Protean\nII, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) onto nitrocellulose\n350 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 15(4)\nmembranes (Hybond ECL RPN3032D, Amersham\nPharmacia Biotech, Little Chalfont, UK). The blots were\nblocked with 5% milk in PBS-T (80 mM Na2\n7.5) for 1 h and then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with\nprimary antibodies, followed by incubation with second-\nary anti-rabbit, anti-mouse or anti-goat horseradish per-\noxidase-conjugated antibodies. The labeling was\nvisualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence\nsystem.\nImmunohistochemistry\nA perfusion needle was inserted in the abdominal aorta\nand the vena cava was cut to establish an outlet. Blood\nwas flushed from the kidney with cold PBS (pH 7.4) for\n15 s before switching to cold 3% paraformaldehyde in\nPBS (pH 7.4) for 3 min. The kidney was removed and\nsectioned into 2\u00ad3 mm transverse sections and immer-\nsion fixed for 1 h, followed by 3 \u00d7 10 min washes in PBS.\nThe tissue was dehydrated in a graded ethanol series and\nleft overnight in xylene. After embedding in paraffin, 2\n\u00b5m sections were made on a rotary microtome.\nImmunoperoxidase labeling was performed as previously\nReal-time polymerase chain reaction (real-\ntime PCR)\nRenal cortex was homogenized in Trizol reagent\n(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).

The mRNA expression of\ninflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules was\ndetermined by real-time PCR. cDNA was made by\nreverse transcribing 5 g of total RNA using oligo(dT)\npriming and superscript reverse transcriptase II\n(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). cDNA was quantified\nusing Smart Cycler II System (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA,\nUSA) and SYBR Green was used for detection. Each\nPCR reaction was done in 10 M forward primer, 10 M\nreverse primer, 2X SYBR Green Premix Ex Taq (Takara\nBio Inc., Japan), 0.5 l cDNA and H2\nO to bring the final\nvolume to 20 l. Relative levels of mRNA were deter-\nmined by real-time PCR, using a Rotor-GeneTM 3000\nDetector System (Corbette Research, Mortlake, New\nSouth Wales, Australia).

The protein expres-\nsion of the renin receptor was not changed by GM or\naliskiren co-treatment in GM-treated rats compared with\ncontrol rats (Figure 1).\nEffects of aliskiren on pathological changes\nin GM-induced renal injury\nFigure 2 shows the morphological changes observed in the\nkidneys among the three groups of animals. Hematoxylin\nand eosin staining indicated the presence of tubular casts,\nobstructions and vessel dilatations in the rats with\nGM-induced renal injury. The GSI was higher in the rats\nwith GM-induced renal injury than in the control rats; treat-\nment with aliskiren was associated with a less pronounced\nincrease in GSI. In addition, interstitial expansion was also\na prominent component of the renal injuries in the rats with\nGM-induced renal injury, which was attenuated by aliskiren\ntreatment.\nEffects of aliskiren on inflammatory cell\ninfiltration in GM-induced renal injury\nFor determining the effects of aliskiren on renal inflamma-\ntory cell infiltration, the protein expression of ED-1 and\niNOS and the infiltration of ED-1-positive macrophages in\nrenal tissue were analyzed (Figure 3). The protein expres-\nsion of ED-1 and iNOS in the kidney was significantly\nhigher in GM-treated rats than in the controls and was ame-\nliorated by aliskiren treatment (Figure 3(a)). The infiltra-\ntion of ED-1-positive macrophages in GM-treated rats was\nsignificantly higher than that in the control rats. Aliskiren\nco-treatment abrogated inflammatory cell infiltration in\nGM-treated kidneys (Figure 3(b)).\nEffects of aliskiren on the expression of\ninflammatory cytokines and adhesion\nmolecules in GM-induced renal injury\nWe also investigated the expression of TNF-, IL-1 and\nIFN-, which are key inflammatory cytokines that are pro-\nduced by infiltrating cells. As shown in Figure 4, GM treat-\nment significantly induced renal TNF-, IL-1 and IFN-\nmRNA expression, while these changes were attenuated\nwith aliskiren co-treatment.\nIncreased expression of certain chemokines and adhe-\nsion molecules such as MCP-1, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1,\nwhich can activate, recruit or induce the transmigration of\ninflammatory cells into the site of renal injury, was also\nseen. The expression of these factors was induced by GM\ntreatment. Aliskiren co-treatment significantly reduced the\nexpression of these chemokines in the GM-treated rat kid-\nneys (Figure 4).\nEffects of aliskiren on NF-B expression in\nGM-induced renal injury\nFigure 5 shows the changes in the expression of the NF-B\np65 subunit in nuclear extracts of renal tubular HK-2 cells\nTable 3.

We also assessed the\nTGF-1-triggered Smad signaling pathway by evaluating\nthe total Smad-2/3 and Smad-4 levels and the level of\ninhibitory Smad-6. An increase in the total Smad-2/3\nlevel in GM-treated rats was accompanied by an increase\nin Smad-4 content and a decrease in the inhibitory\nSmad-6 content compared with those in the control group.\nThese GM-induced changes were again restored by\naliskiren co-treatment (Figure 7).\nEffects of aliskiren on renal fibrosis in GM-\ninduced renal injury\nWe next examined the expression of fibronectin and\n-smooth muscle actin (-SMA), the molecular marker\nof myofibroblasts. Figure 8 shows that GM treatment\nsignificantly increased the protein expression of fibronectin\nand -SMA. These changes were ameliorated by aliskiren\ntreatment (Figure 8(a)). In vitro studies showed that\naliskiren pretreatment also reduced fibronectin expression\ninduced by GM (Figure 8(b)).\nEffects of aliskiren on renal tubular cell\napoptosis in GM-induced renal injury\nGM treatment increased the expression of the proapoptotic\nmarker Bax and decreased that of the antiapoptotic protein\nBcl-2, resulting in an overall increase in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio.\nAliskiren treatment attenuated the increase in the Bax/Bcl-2\nratio in GM-treated rats (Figure 9(a)).

Furthermore, the Bax and cleaved\ncaspase-3 levels increased in GM-pretreated HK-2 cells,\nwhich was also attenuated by aliskiren treatment (Figure 10).\nDiscussion\nIn the present study, aliskiren treatment did not change\nthe GM concentration and renin receptor expression in\nthe kidney. This finding suggests that the effect of\naliskiren was attributed neither to the competitive inhibi-\ntion of GM accumulation in the kidney nor to the down-\nregulation of renin receptor expression. It has been\nreported that there was no difference between the affin-\nity of angiotensin II for its receptor between glomeruli\nfrom controls and those from rats treated with GM.19\nThese findings do not support the role of angiotensin II\nin the development and maintenance of GM-induced\nrenal injury. Therefore, the renoprotective effects of\naliskiren might be pleiotropic.\nA decline in renal function in chronic kidney disease\noften correlates with the extent of inflammation.20 GM,\nin particular, can accumulate in the renal cortex, pro-\nmoting the interstitial proliferation of fibroblast cells\nand focal infiltration by inflammatory cells.21 In this\nstudy, GM-treated rats showed a marked increase in\nmonocyte/macrophage infiltration into the renal cortex/\nmedulla, as indicated by the large number of ED-1-\npositive cells in the interstitium. These findings are\nconsistent with previous observations demonstrating\nthat GM can cause an increase in monocyte/macrophage\nFigure 4. Real-time polymerase chain reaction of tumor necrotic factor (TNF)-, interleukin (IL)-1 and interferon (IFN)-\n, which are proinflammatory cytokines participating in the pathogenesis of renal disease. Chemoattractants and adhesion\nmolecules such as monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 and vascular cell\nadhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 were also evaluated. Aliskiren co-treatment suppressed the overexpression of these inflammatory\ncytokines and adhesion molecules induced by gentamicin (GM).\n*p < 0.05 compared with the control animals.\n#p < 0.05 compared with the GM rats.\n356 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 15(4)\npopulations in the kidney.22 GM increased the expres-\nsion of proinflammatory markers such as TNF-, IL-1\nand IFN-. These inflammatory molecules participate\nin the pathogenesis of tubulointerstitial impairment via\nthe promotion of leukocyte attraction and adhesion to\ninflamed renal tubular cells. The expression of cell sur-\nface adhesion molecules such as MCP-1, ICAM-1 and\nVCAM-1, which are highly specific chemotactic fac-\ntors for macrophages, increased in the kidneys of\nGM-treated rats. These findings also indicate that the\ninflammatory process plays a significant role in the\npathogenesis of GM-induced renal injury. Furthermore,\nwe showed that aliskiren significantly reduced the\ninfiltration of ED-1-expressing macrophages in the kid-\nney and decreased the GM-induced renal expression of\nproinflammatory cytokines and cell surface adhesion\nmolecules. These findings suggest that aliskiren can\nattenuate the kidney damage by suppression of cell sur-\nface adhesion molecules as well as inflammatory\ncytokines.\nNF-B is thought to be a key transcription factor that\nunderlies the renal inflammatory process by regulating\nthe gene expression of cytokines, chemokines and adhe-\nsion molecules in progressive renal diseases. In the GM\nrat model, NF-B was activated by GM administration,\nand blockade of NF-B activation reduced apoptosis and\ninterstitial fibrosis.23 NF-B is released from an inhibi-\ntory subunit I-B and translocates into the nucleus, where\nit promotes the transcriptional activation of target genes.6\nIn our study, the expression of nuclear p65 subunits of\nNF-B increased after GM treatment in HK-2 cells,\nwhich suggests that GM induced NF-B activation and\ntranslocation via I-B degradation. A recent study also\nsuggested that aliskiren can repress NF-B expression in\nMultiple possible intracellular mechanisms are known\nto regulate inflammation and fibrosis cascades in dis-\neased kidneys. TGF-\u00df1 is a key molecule in these pro-\ncesses, and a comprehensive survey indicates that in\ntubular epithelial cells it is capable of activating several\nsignal transduction pathways such as those involving\nMAPKs.25 MAPKs are fundamental regulators of most\nimmune cell functions, including proliferation, differen-\ntiation, survival and apoptosis, chemoattraction and\ninflammatory mediator production. They use three paral-\nlel signal transduction pathways, that is, those involving\nERK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase and p38. One of these\npathways, the ERK signaling pathway, has been shown to\nbe activated by TGF-\u00df in mesangial cells.26 TGF-\u00df\nincreases ERK activity and fibronectin expression in rat\nmesangial cells.27 In addition, specific inhibition of ERK\nprevented TGF-\u00df-induced fibronectin expression. These\nresults indicate that the ERK pathway may play an impor-\ntant role in TGF-\u00df-mediated fibrosis. Other researchers\nhave suggested that activation of the ERK pathway also\nplays a critical role in the proliferation of tubular epithe-\nlial and myofibroblast-like cells.7 We also observed that\nERK 1/2 activation was induced within several hours of\nGM administration to HK-2 cells, and this increase was\nattenuated by aliskiren. These changes coincide with the\ninitiation of the fibrotic process, which has been shown to\ninclude overexpression of fibronectin and -SMA in vivo\nand in vitro.\nTGF-\u00df1 signals are transduced by transmembrane ser-\nine/threonine kinase type I and type II receptors and\nintracellular mediators known as Smads. On TGF-\u00df1\nstimulation, receptor-bound Smad proteins such as Smad-\n2/3 are phosphorylated. Phosphorylation induces the\nassociation of Smad-2/3 with Smad-4, a member of the\nco-Smad subfamily, and they form transcriptionally\nactive complexes that translocate into the nucleus and\nactivate the transcription of TGF-\u00df-induced target genes.\nSmad signaling can also be negatively controlled by the\ninhibitory Smad-6 and Smad-7 proteins. Therefore, TGF-\n\u00df1-induced fibrosis is thought to be mediated by Smad\nsignaling.4 In our study, GM induced the overexpression\nof Smad-2/3 and Smad-4, whereas inhibitory Smad-6\nFigure 5.

These changes\ncoincided with the in vivo and in vitro expression of renal\nfibrosis markers such as fibronectin and -SMA.\nTherefore, the ERK 1/2 and p38 signaling pathways acti-\nvated by TGF-\u00df1 appear to mediate GM-induced renal\nfibrosis, which is effectively inhibited by aliskiren.\nMasson's trichrome staining confirmed aliskiren-induced\nattenuation of collagen deposition and fibrosis in\nGM-induced nephropathy.\nIn progressive renal disease, tubular cell apoptosis\nprecedes the manifestations of tubular atrophy, tubular\ndilatation and perivascular inflammation.4 GM induces\nBax aggregation and translocation to the mitochondria,\ncausing activation of caspase-9, which then cleaves and\nactivates the effector caspase, caspase-3, leading to a\nloss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and to\napoptotic cell death.29 In this study, the number of\nTUNEL-positive cells increased after GM treatment.\nFigure 6. Mitogen-activated protein kinase expression was also analyzed in HK-2 cells incubated with gentamicin (GM) (1.0 mg/\nml) for 3 h in the absence and presence of aliskiren. Aliskiren (50 and 100 nmol/l) was pretreated in HK-2 cells 2 h before GM\nexposure. Note the significantly decreased pERK 1/2 and p38 expression in the GM with aliskiren (50 and 100 nmol/l) groups\ncompared with that for the GM group.\n*p < 0.05 compared with the control.\n#p < 0.05 compared with GM-treated HK-2 cells.\n358 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 15(4)\nAlong with these changes, GM increased the expression\nof the Bax protein and cleaved caspase-3, whereas it\ndownregulated the expression of the antiapoptotic pro-\ntein Bcl-2. These changes were reversed by aliskiren.\nSeveral reports have implicated MAPK pathways in\napoptotic signaling by TGF-\u00df. For example, activation\nof TGF-\u00df-activated kinase-1 (TAK-1), a protein of the\nMAP kinase family, activates p38 and JNK signaling in\nTGF-\u00df-family-induced apoptosis,30 and p38 signaling is\nrequired for TGF-\u00df-induced apoptosis in murine podo-\ncytes.31 Inhibition of TGF-\u00df1 and MAPK expression by\naliskiren suggests that aliskiren prevents apoptosis and\ntubular atrophy through the inhibition of TGF- \u00df1\nexpression.\nFigure 7. Semiquantitative immunoblotting for transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u00df1 and Smad-2/3, Smad-4 and Smad-6\nproteins. TGF-\u00df1 expression increased significantly in the kidneys of gentamicin (GM)-treated rats, and was markedly attenuated\nby aliskiren co-treatment. Consistent with the changes in TGF-\u00df1, increases in Smad-2/3 and Smad-4 protein expression suggest\nthat TGF-\u00df1 triggered the Smad signaling cascade. The expression of inhibitory Smad-6 was lower in GM-treated rats than in the\ncontrol group. These GM-induced changes were inhibited by aliskiren co-treatment. Magnification: \u00d7200.\n*p < 0.05 compared with the control animals.\n#p < 0.05 compared with the GM rats.\nFigure 8. (a) Semiquantitative immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry of fibronectin and -smooth muscle actin (SMA), a\nmolecular marker of myofibroblasts. Protein expression of fibronectin and SMA increased significantly in the kidney of gentamicin\n(GM)-treated rats, and was markedly attenuated by aliskiren co-treatment. *p < 0.05 compared with the control animals; #p <\n0.05 compared with the GM rats. Magnification: \u00d7200. (b) Fibronectin expression analyzed in HK-2 cells incubated with GM (1.0\nmg/ml) for 3 h in the absence and presence of aliskiren. Aliskiren (50 and 100 nmol) was pretreated in HK-2 cells 2 h before GM\nexposure. Note the significantly decreased fibronectin expression in the GM with aliskiren (50 and 100 nmol) groups compared\nwith that for the GM group. *p < 0.05 compared with the control; #p < 0.05 compared with GM-treated HK-2 cells.\nFigure 9. Expression of proapoptotic Bax and antiapoptotic Bcl-2. The Bax/Bcl-2 ratio increased in gentamicin (GM)-treated\nrats and was attenuated by aliskiren co-treatment. *p < 0.05 compared with the control animals; #p < 0.05 compared with\nthe GM rats. (b) Effects of aliskiren treatment on tubular cell apoptosis in rats. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-\nmediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay showed increased apoptosis in response to GM, whereas aliskiren co-treatment\nsignificantly reduced the number of TUNEL-positive cells. Magnification: \u00d7200.\n360 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 15(4)\nFigure 10. Effects of aliskiren on the expression of pro- and antiapoptotic markers. Semiquantitative immunoblotting indicated\nthat the level of the proapoptotic marker Bax increased in gentamicin (GM)-treated HK-2 cells. Significant increases in cleaved\ncaspase-3 expression were noted in GM-treated cells. Aliskiren also attenuated all of these changes.\n*p < 0.05 compared with the control.\n#p < 0.05 compared with GM-treated HK-2 cells.\nIn conclusion, the renin inhibitor aliskiren exerts anti-\ninflammatory effects through the inhibition of NF-B, result-\ning in reduction in TGF-\u00df1 expression and TGF-\u00df1-induced\nSmad-2/3 and MAPK signaling in GM-induced nephrotox-\nicity. This inhibition of TGF-\u00df1 signaling also attenuates\nGM-induced renal tubular cell apoptosis and fibrosis.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by the Korea Science and\nEngineering Foundation through the Medical Research Center\nChonnamNationalUniversityandKoreaResearchFoundation\nGrant funded by the Korean Government (MOEHRD, Basic\nby Chonnam National University Hospital Research Institute\nConflict of interest\nNone declared.\nReferences\n1.
