However, these patients are occasionally\nrefractory to conventional therapies, and the\nDirect hemoperfusion using polymyxin\nB-immobilized fiber column (PMX-DHP) ther-\napy as an extracorporeal blood filter has been\ndeveloped to remove blood endotoxin and is used\nfor the treatment of patients with endotoxemia\nand septic shock.7\u00ad9 PMX-DHP therapy has been\nreported to improve not only hemodynamic sta-\ntus, but also respiratory dysfunction in patients\nwith septic acute respiratory distress syndrome\n(ARDS).10\u00ad12 These studies also demonstrated\nthat PMX-DHP may adsorb and eliminate\nincreased levels of inflammatory cytokines and\nmediators and activated leukocytes, which are\nthought to have an essential role in the pathogen-\nesis of ARDS.\nThere have been several reports of case series in\nwhich a combination of hemoperfusion of PMX\nand conventional therapies was used for the\ntreatment of RPIPs, including IPF, connective\ntissue disease-associated interstitial pneumonia\n(CTD-IP), and drug-induced pneumonia.13\u00ad15\nRecently, a multicenter retrospective study,\nincluding acute exacerbation of IPF patients,\nrevealed that the PMX-DHP treatment of RPIPs\nwith acute respiratory failure might have a ben-\neficial effect on oxygenation and survival.16 We\nalso reported that a combination of PMX-DHP\nand conventional therapies was effective against\nfatal drug-induced interstitial pneumonia and\nRPIP due to clinically amyopathic dermatomy-\nositis (DM).15,17 However, the effects of PMX-\nDHP treatment on acute respiratory failure\nduring RPIPs have not been fully established.\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy\nof PMX-DHP as an add-on therapy for acute\nrespiratory failure in patients with RPIPs by ret-\nrospectively comparing the outcomes of patients\nwith RPIPs who were treated either with con-\nventional therapies plus PMX-DHP (PMX-\nDHP group) or with conventional therapies\nalone (historical control group).\nMethods\nStudy population\nWe performed a historical control study in a sin-\ngle institute, Kumamoto University Hospital.\nThe study population comprised 77 patients with\nRPIPs, including idiopathic interstitial pneumo-\nnias (IIPs) and CTD-IP, who were treated with a\ncombination of conventional therapies and PMX-\nDHP or conventional therapies alone from 2002\nto 2015. Patients with IIPs, including IPF, non-\nspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), and AIP\nwere diagnosed according to the international\nconsensus classification of the American Thoracic\nSociety/European Respiratory Society.18,19\nCTD-IP, including rheumatoid arthritis, DM,\npolymyositis (PM), systemic lupus erythematosus\n(SLE), systemic sclerosis (SSc), Sj\u00f6gren syndrome\n(SjS), mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD),\nand microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) were diag-\nnosed based on each established criteria.20 RPIPs\nincluding acute exacerbation of IPF were defined\nusing the criteria proposed by Collard and col-\nleagues,2 with slight modifications for adaptation\nto interstitial pneumonias other than IPF. Briefly,\nthe criteria for diagnosis of RPIPs were as fol-\nlows: (1) previous or concurrent diagnosis of\ninterstitial pneumonias; (2) unexplained worsen-\ning of dyspnea within 1 month; (3) evidence of\nhypoxemia as defined by the partial pressure of\narterial O2\n)/fraction of inspired O2\n)\n(P/F) ratio <300 mmHg; (4) high-resolution\ncomputed tomography (HRCT) findings with\nnewly developed ground-glass opacities and/or\nconsolidations; (5) no evidence of pulmonary\ninfection on bronchoalveolar lavage and sputum\nculture and negative results on blood tests for\nother potentially infectious pathogens; and (6)\nexclusion of left heart failure, pulmonary embo-\nlism, pneumothorax, and other possible causes of\nacute respiratory failure.14 For inclusion in this\nstudy, written informed consent was obtained\nfrom each patient. When an unconscious patient\nunder sedation for mechanical ventilation was not\nable to give consent, the consent was obtained\nfrom a family member. Blood endotoxin levels\nwere determined by the Endospecy test.\nwho met the inclusion criteria were eligible for\ntreatment with a combination of PMX-DHP and\nconventional therapies (PMX-DHP group).\nH Ichiyasu, Y Horio et al.\njournals.sagepub.com/home/tar 263\nwho met the inclusion criteria and who were\ntreated with conventional therapies alone were\nnominated as the historical comparison controls\n(historical control group). All patient records\nwere reviewed to obtain demographic data and\ndetails of initial presentation at the start of PMX-\nDHP and/or conventional therapies. In the his-\ntorical control, three of seven IPF and one of\neight idiopathic NSIP were pathologically con-\nfirmed by surgical lung biopsy. In the PMX-DHP\ngroup, two of five IPF and two of nine idiopathic\nNSIP were pathologically confirmed. This study\nfollowed the principles of the Declaration of\nHelsinki; the study protocol was approved by the\nHuman Ethics Review Committee of Kumamoto\nUniversity Hospital (No. 2034), and written\ninformed consent in the PMX-DHP group was\nobtained from all patients or their family mem-\nbers for the use of PMX-DHP.\nPMX-DHP and conventional therapies\nWe performed PMX-DHP therapy (Toraymyxin;\nToray Medical Co., Tokyo, Japan) in RPIPs\npatients with acute respiratory failure who were\nresistant to conventional therapies, including\nhigh-dose CS and/or immunosuppressive agents.\nThere were no pre-specified criteria for defining\nresistance to conventional therapy; however, in\nmost cases resistance to the therapy was judged\nby two or more of the following: (1) worsening of\ndyspnea; (2) increase of parenchymal abnormali-\nties on chest radiograph or HRCT; and (3) dete-\nrioration of P/F ratio. Inclusion criteria of\nPMX-DHP therapy for RPIPs patients were as\nfollows: (1) current diagnosis of RPIPs; (2)\nresistance to conventional therapy judged by an\nattending physician. Exclusion criteria of PMX-\nDHP were as follows: (1) >85 years old; (2)\nneeded continuous hemodiafiltration; (3) history\nof cerebrovascular disorder within 1 year; (4)\npregnancy or breastfeeding; (5) liver cirrhosis or\nother serious liver disorders; (6) severe hemor-\nrhagic diseases; (7) advanced cancer; and (8)\nconsidered ineligible for PMX-DHP by an\nattending physician. Direct hemoperfusion with\nPMX was performed using conventional equip-\nment for hemoperfusion and a circuit for hemo-\ndialysis. For venous access, a double-lumen\ncatheter was inserted into the femoral vein using\nSeldinger's method. Direct hemoperfusion was\nh twice, with a time interval of approximately 24\nh. Nafamostat mesylate (Torii Pharma Co. Ltd.,\nTokyo, Japan) was used as an anticoagulant.\nFor the conventional therapies, CS alone or in\ncombination with immunosuppressive agents,\nincluding cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, or\ntacrolimus, were administered to all patients with\nRPIPs in this study. All patients received 1\u00ad3\ncourses of high-dose CS pulse therapy (methyl-\ndays) followed by tapering doses of prednisolone\nwith or without cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2\nevery 3\u00ad4 weeks) or cyclosporine (2\u00ad3 mg/kg/\nday, followed by adjustment to trough levels of\nday, followed by adjustment to trough levels of\n5\u00ad10 ng/ml), instead of cyclosporine, was also\nadded to the regimen in some patients.\nRespiratory supports such as oxygen inhalation\ntherapy, noninvasive positive pressure ventila-\ntion, and invasive positive pressure ventilation\nwere provided to the patients with respiratory\nfailure at the attending physician's discretion in\neach case.\nData collection\nWe defined the day when PMX-DHP and/or\nconventional therapies were initiated as day 0.\nThe patients were followed for 90 days after the\ntherapies. All of the patients' backgrounds,\nincluding age, sex, smoking status, clinical diag-\nnosis, contents of previous treatments, peripheral\nblood counts, blood biochemistry, P/F ratio,\nAcute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation\n(APACHE) II score,21 and Sequential Organ\nFailure Assessment (SOFA) score,22 at the initial\ntreatments were compared between the two\ngroups. Blood samples were collected at diagno-\nsis, just before PMX-DHP therapy, and at 3 and\n5 days after the initial PMX-DHP. Survival time\nwas defined as days from initial treatment for\nRPIPs to death. We also evaluated 90-day mor-\ntality rates. The mortality rates were calculated\nbased on all causes of death, and the cumulative\nmortality rate was estimated using the Kaplan\u00ad\nMeier method; intergroup differences were tested\nusing the log-rank test. In the PMX-DHP group,\nthe enrolled patients were divided into the groups\nof survivors and non-survivors on day 90 to inves-\ntigate the effects of PMX-DHP therapy by identi-\nfying clinical and laboratory differences by\nrecording the clinical and physiological data just\nTherapeutic Advances in Respiratory Disease 11(7)\n264 journals.sagepub.com/home/tar\nbefore and at 3 and 5 days after the PMX-DHP\ntherapy.\nStatistical analysis\nClinical and laboratory data were collected from\nthe patients' medical records. Continuous varia-\nbles were expressed as the mean \u00b1 standard devia-\ntion unless otherwise stated and were compared\nusing the Mann\u00adWhitney U-test. Categorized\nvariables were analyzed using the chi-square test\nor Fisher's exact test as appropriate for the sample\nsize. Spearman's rank correlation (rs\n) test was\nused to assess the relationship between improved\nP/F ratio after PMX-DHP therapy and changes of\nneutrophil counts in blood. The Cox proportional\nhazards regression model was used for univariate\nand multivariate analyses to determine the signifi-\ncant predictors of survival. A p-value <0.05 was\nconsidered to indicate statistical significance.\nComparisons of the P/F ratio, SOFA score, serum\nlevels of C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehy-\ndrogenase (LDH), Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-\n6), and neutrophil counts in blood between the\ngroups of survivors and non-survivors over time\nafter PMX-DHP were analyzed by repeated meas-\nures analysis of variance (ANOVA) adjusted for\nthe baseline values as a covariate and by post-hoc\nBonferroni test. The last observation carried for-\nward method for missing data was used for the\nanalysis. Missing samples occurred because of\ndeath or samples not drawn. On the basis of the\nmortality in our retrospective study of acute exac-\nerbation of IPF,23 if a 50% reduction in the hazard\nratio (HR) could be achieved in the PMX-DHP\npower, a sample size of at least 72 subjects was\nneeded. All statistical analyses were performed\nusing the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences\nversion 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).\nResults\nBaseline characteristics\nDuring the study period, 77 patients fulfilled the\ninclusion criteria described above. Forty-one\npatients were eligible for the treatments with\nPMX-DHP (PMX-DHP group), and 36 patients\nwere eligible for the treatments without PMX-\nDHP (historical control group). The baseline\ncharacteristics of the study population are shown\nin Table 1. There were no significant differences\nin age, sex, smoking status, clinical diagnosis, and\nprevious therapy between the two groups. In the\nPMX-DHP group, four patients with DM were\npositive for anti-ARS antibody and the remaining\neight patients were positive for anti-MDA-5 anti-\nbody. In the historical control, all five patients\nwith DM were negative for anti-Jo-1 antibody. In\nthe PMX-DHP group, 17 patients received CS\ntherapy before the onset of RPIPs; eight of these\npatients underwent immunosuppressive therapy\nwith cyclosporine (n = 7) or tacrolimus (n = 1),\nand one patient received pirfenidone as an antifi-\nbrotic agent. In the control group, 16 patients\nreceived CS before onset; seven patients under-\nwent immunosuppressive therapy with cyclo-\nsporine (n = 6) or cyclophosphamide (n = 1).\nThe mean white blood cell counts, neutrophils,\nCRP, LDH, KL-6, and surfactant protein-D\nwere elevated in both groups, but were not signifi-\ncantly different. There was no significant differ-\nence in the respiratory failure indices between the\ngroups on admission (mean P/F ratio; PMX-\nAPACHE II and SOFA scores were not signifi-\ncantly different between the two groups.\nEndotoxin levels before initial treatment and\nPMX-DHP therapy were within the normal range\nin all patients.\nTreatment for RPIPs\nTherapeutic interventions performed during the\nstudy are shown in Table 2. After the diagnosis of\nRPIPs, all patients were treated with high-dose CS\npulse therapy alone or combination therapy with\nhigh-dose CS pulse therapy and immunosuppres-\nsive agents such as cyclophosphamide, cyclo-\nsporine, or tacrolimus, followed by maintenance\ntreatment with a tapered dose of CS. The combina-\ntion therapy was applied to 33 of the 41 patients\npatients (69%) in the control group. The number\nof patients receiving combination therapy with CS,\ncyclophosphamide, and cyclosporine or tacrolimus\nin the PMX-DHP group tended to be larger than\nthat in the historical control group; however, there\nwas no significant difference between the two\ngroups (p = 0.056).

Similarly, in the multivariate analysis,\nremained independent factors for reduced risk of\nmortality (after adjusting for age, sex, SOFA\nscore, LDH, and KL-6). Age, sex, diagnosis of\nIPF, P/F ratio, SOFA score, and serological tests\nexcept for CRP levels were not prognostic factors\nin this study.

The first clinical report on PMX-DHP for\nRPIPs patients was published in 2006 by Seo and\ncolleagues, who reported that six cases of acute\nexacerbation of IPF were safely and successfully\ntreated with PMX-DHP.13 Their study showed\nthat PMX-DHP in IPF with acute respiratory\nfailure may be helpful for life-threatening condi-\ntions refractory to conventional treatments such\nas high-dose CS pulse.

The\ntherapy showed a favorable outcome although\ncontrol subjects without PMX-DHP therapy had\nnot been set up. Recently, three retrospective\nstudies were conducted with comparative analy-\nses between PMX-DHP and control groups.27\u00ad30\nIn two of these three studies, PMX-DHP therapy\nshowed a significantly favorable prognosis, which\nwas similar to our results. Enomoto and col-\nleagues showed a significant improvement in the\n12-month survival rate with PMX-DHP therapy\nfor acute exacerbation of IPF,28 although intersti-\ntial lung diseases other than IPF were not exam-\nined. However, there are limitations in the\ninterpretation of these results because all of the\nabove studies, including ours, were not rand-\nomized. Further studies including randomized\ncontrolled trials are necessary to evaluate the effi-\ncacy of PMX-DHP in patients with RPIPs.\nIn the present study, we selected patients with\nIIPs including IPF and CTD-IP with acute res-\npiratory failure and compared the clinical features\nand outcomes between the patients treated with\nPMX-DHP and those with conventional therapy\nwithout PMX-DHP as a historical control.

The\nchange in the P/F ratio was inversely correlated with\nthe change in neutrophil counts in blood (rs\nH Ichiyasu, Y Horio et al.\njournals.sagepub.com/home/tar 271\nand control groups at baseline, although the ana-\nlyzed subjects had various types of underlying dis-\neases. Therefore, it was considered reasonable to\ncompare the two groups.\nIn the present study, the number of neutrophils in\nblood decreased 3 days after PMX-DHP therapy,\nand there was a significant difference in the time-\ndependent changes of peripheral blood neutro-\nphils between the survivor and non-survivor\ngroups (Figure 3). Furthermore, a reduction of\nneutrophil counts after PMX-DHP may lead to\nimproved pulmonary oxygenation (Figure 4).\nThe major pathological finding of RPIPs is dif-\nfuse alveolar damage (DAD).4,5 DAD with\nchronic fibrotic lung is found in patients with not\nonly IPF but also idiopathic fibrotic NSIP and\ninterstitial pneumonia related to CTD.5,6 Acute\nlung injury occurring in patients with AIP and\nCTD at initial presentation also shows a histo-\nlogical feature of DAD without pre-existing inter-\nstitial pneumonia.30 Although the mechanism of\nTable 5.

The\nremoval of circulating endotoxin dose has not\nbeen shown to be very effective because the blood\nlevel of endotoxin was within the normal range in\npatients with RPIPs of our study and in previous\nreports.13\u00ad17 We observed that blood neutrophil\ncounts were reduced after PMX-DHP and there\nwas a negative relationship between the reduced\nneutrophil counts and the increased P/F ratio\nafter PMX-DHP, suggesting that the adsorptive\nremoval of neutrophils by PMX-DHP may be a\npotential mechanism of action, as previously\nreported.33 Further studies are required to deter-\nmine the precise mechanism of PMX-DHP ther-\napy for RPIPs.\nIn our study, the elevated levels of CRP at diag-\nnosis were associated with a decreased hazard of\n90-day mortality (Table 3). This finding seems to\nconflict with previous study findings regarding\nthe role of CRP as an inflammatory marker of\npredicted risk.3,34 Song and colleagues demon-\nstrated that higher levels of CRP were a signifi-\ncant risk factor of acute exacerbation of IPF and\nother acute illnesses such as sepsis and pneumo-\nnia and were associated with adverse outcome.3\nConversely, a study among patients with ARDS\nshowed an association between higher CRP levels\nand decreased mortality.35 Thus, the clinical sig-\nnificance of CRP in interstitial lung diseases with\nacute respiratory failure has been controversial.\nThe significance of CRP as a mortality predictor\nshould be confirmed in future studies.\nAcute exacerbation of IPF has been known to be\na major risk factor for mortality in patients with\ninterstitial pneumonias. However, in our study,\nIPF was not associated with increased risk of\nmortality on univariate analysis. This may con-\ntribute to the fact that the majority of patients\nwere diagnosed based on radiographic patterns\nbecause of limited availability of histological find-\nings. The non-IPF patients, especially with idio-\npathic NSIP, may include some cases of\nmisclassified IPF. On the other hand, our results\nare similar to those of the previous study, which\nreported that survival rates after acute exacerba-\ntion treated by PMX-DHP were comparable\nbetween IPF and all interstitial pneumonias,\nincluding IPF, in a multicenter retrospective\nanalysis,16 although univariate analysis was not\nconducted. Taken together, PMX-DHP therapy\nmay have therapeutic benefits not only for acute\nexacerbation in IPF, but also for RPIPs other\nthan IPF.\nThe clinical importance of the timing and dura-\ntion of PMX-DHP therapy has been investigated.\nIn patients with ARDS and RPIPs, including\nacute exacerbation of IPF, early induction of\nPMX-DHP therapy gave better effects and was a\nvery important factor affecting survival.25,27\nFurthermore, a longer duration of PMX-DHP\n(12 h) was more effective for acute exacerbation of\nIP than a shorter duration (6 h).24 Although the\nstarting time and duration of PMX-DHP in our\nstudy was somewhat delayed and shorter in com-\nparison with previous studies, there was no differ-\nence between the survivor and non-survivor\ngroups (Table 4). Other clinical parameters,\nincluding the P/F ratio on admission and just\nbefore PMX-DHP therapy, also did not differ\nbetween the groups. The SOFA score is a reliable\nand useful means of classifying the severity of dis-\neases and estimating the outcome in ICU\npatients.22 Some authors have previously reported\nthat the serial evaluations of the SOFA score also\npredicted the outcome in critically ill patients.8,36\nRecently, Kao and colleagues reported that the\nsequential assessment of organ dysfunction within\nthe first 3 days of mechanical ventilation predicted\nthe outcome of patients with severe acute respira-\ntory failure.37 A recent randomized controlled\nstudy showed that PMX-DHP therapy improved\nthe SOFA scores and mortality rate of sepsis\npatients.8 In our study, as shown in Figure 3, the\nSOFA score on days 3 and 5 and the P/F ratio on\nday 5 after PMX-DHP therapy in the survivors\nwere significantly different from those in the non-\nsurvivors. From our results, the changes in the\nSOFA score after PMX-DHP rather than the ini-\ntial score may be useful for predicting the clinical\noutcome in patients with RPIPs, although Hara\nand colleagues showed that the SOFA score in\nRPIPs was not affected by PMX-DHP.14\nThis study had several limitations. First, this was a\nretrospective historical control and not a rand-\nomized controlled study. Temporal trends in the\nH Ichiyasu, Y Horio et al.\njournals.sagepub.com/home/tar 273\ndiagnosis and treatment may have affected the\nresults from the use of a historical control group,\nand there could have been a non-contemporane-\nous control bias. Because this study included\npatients from two different time frames within a\n13-year period, advances in supportive care such\nas mechanical ventilation and infection control\nduring the periods may also have influenced the\nresults. Second, this study was conducted in a sin-\ngle institution; therefore, the number of patients\nwas limited. The heterogeneity of underlying dis-\neases also made it difficult to examine prognostic\nvariables. Some negative or positive associations\nin the statistical analyses may have been due to\ninadequate power derived from the small sample\nsize. Third, not all the patients in this study were\ntreated according to the same protocol. Takada\nand colleagues reported that AIP associated with\nDM/PM patients who were started on immuno-\nsuppressive agents simultaneously with CS had\nsignificantly better survival than those to whom\nimmunosuppressive agents were added if CS\nalone did not result in a favorable response.38 In\nour study, all patients were treated with CS alone\nor the combination therapy of CS and immuno-\nsuppressive agents except for PMX-DHP therapy.\nThe decision regarding the choice of immunosup-\npressive agents was made by the attending physi-\ncians, and the types and amounts of the agents\nand timing of the administration varied by the\nindividual cases. Those variations in therapeutic\nregimen may have affected the responses to ther-\napy and outcomes. Finally, because of referral\nbias, our study group may have been composed of\npatients who had more severe or complicated dis-\neases; thus, the results of our study may not gener-\nally apply to patients in other settings.\nConclusions\nIn summary, the use of PMX-DHP therapy in\ncombination with conventional therapy, includ-\ning CS and immunosuppressive agents, gave a\nRPIPs, which was an improvement over the\n66.7% rate for conventional therapy. Nonetheless,\nit is more important to note that half of the\npatients still died of respiratory failure within a\nfew months, despite the use of aggressive combi-\nnation therapies, including PMX-DHP. Further\nstudies are needed in a large-scale, randomized,\ncontrolled study to confirm the effect of PMX-\nDHP treatment and to develop better therapeutic\nmanagement for patients with RPIPs.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nConflict of interest statement\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nReferences\n1.
