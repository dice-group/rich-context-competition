The volatile combination of\nthe two can be seen in the current political, com-\nmercial, and scientific activities surrounding the\nadoption of electronic health records (EHRs)\nin the United States (Wright et al., 2013), espe-\ncially the explorations and debates about EHR\nGreenhalgh, Potts, Wong, Bark, and Swingle-\nhurst (2009) describe several conceptualizations\nor \"meta-narratives\" about EHRs in the litera-\nture. The \"health information systems\" meta-\nnarrative frames EHRs as tools for systemati-\ncally managing clinical information, relieving\nhealth care workers of this burden, and thereby\nprotecting patients from the associated safety\nrisks. Technology is viewed primarily as a means\nof preventing mistakes by constraining human\nperformance. This approach corresponds to a\nview of human error and safety that sees acci-\ndents as products of a faulty (usually human)\nelement in proximity to the accident. Accord-\ningly, strategies to increase safety focus primar-\nily on the use of barriers (Dekker, 2006; Qureshi,\nIn contrast, the \"critical sociology\" meta-nar-\nrative (Greenhalgh et al., 2009) conceptualizes\nEHRs as tools for systematically managing the\nwork of clinical providers, imposing a model\nthat presumes optimal efficiency and consis-\ntency while constraining the ability of clinical\nproviders to respond to situated needs. This\napproach considers the underlying structure of\nthe organization as a possible risk factor for\nAddress correspondence to Michael W.

Similarly, some models of safety, such as\nthe \"Swiss cheese\" model (Reason, 1997), view\naccidents not simply as the fault of front-line\nworkers but as the result of multiple failures in a\nseries of barriers, including latent failures in the\norganizational environment (Dekker, 2006; Hol-\nThough these two meta-narratives reflect\nopposing perspectives, both contain valid\ninsights on how EHRs affect clinical work. EHRs\noffer many potential safety enhancements and\nother benefits to providers and other clinical staff\n(Jha & Classen, 2011). At the same time, EHRs\nserve in some ways as supervisory control sys-\ntems for the process of care delivery. For exam-\nple, EHRs may shape provider choices by pre-\nsenting certain options for tests and/or treatments\nfor selection, or they may discourage providers\nfrom ordering potentially dangerous drug combi-\nnations (Teich et al., 2000). In some systems,\ndeviations from computer-recommended treat-\nments require a justification (Hsieh et al., 2004).\nAlthough the two aforementioned perspec-\ntives highlight the impact of EHRs on clinical\nwork, both are oversimplifications. First, an EHR\nis not a homogenous entity. At its simplest, an\nEHR is a database containing the health informa-\ntion of patients under the care of a facility, but in\npractice, EHRs are sophisticated software appli-\ncations that contain and/or interact with other\napplications, including systems for computerized\nprovider order entry, clinical decision support,\ntest results management, pharmacy databases,\nand medication administration systems (i.e., bar-\ncoding systems; Committee on Data Standards\nfor Patient Safety, 2003). These software appli-\ncations require networked hardware and clinical\nknowledge structures, such as decision rules and\nvocabularies, to operate (Sittig & Singh, 2010).\nSecond, EHRs are not static; rather, they are\nsubject to change from other elements in the\nsociotechnical system, including providers\n(Hunte, Wears, & Schubert, 2013). For instance,\nEHRs evolve in response to changes in clinical\nknowledge structures and how providers encode\nmedical problems (Aarts, 2011). Thus, the front-\nline providers at the \"sharp end\" of patient care\n(Cook & Woods, 1994) are not simply passive\nrecipients but active agents in the ongoing devel-\nopment of the EHR. Being a technical system in\npeople-centric health care delivery organiza-\ntions, the EHR is a part of a multilevel network\nof pressures and influences. Patients, providers,\nmanagers, regulators, and many sociopolitical\nfactors influence, and are influenced by, EHRs\nThird, as dynamic systems embedded in\norganizations with quality, production, and\nresource pressures, EHRs need to be effectively\nmanaged, especially to maintain safety. Active\nmaintenance and oversight activities are needed\nfor adaptations in response to changes to health\nOtherwise, changes may lead health care sys-\ntems into unsafe states of \"brittleness\" in which\nadditional stress may lead to sudden failure\ninstead of smooth adaptation (Cook & Rasmus-\nThe \"systems approaches to risk management\nand integration\" meta-narrative (Greenhalgh et al.,\n2009) acknowledges the role of EHRs as compo-\nnents of complex and dynamic sociotechnical sys-\ntems, from whose interactions can emerge new\nmodes of safety and risk. This conceptualization\nviews safety as the product of complex interac-\ntions at multiple levels and the management of\nsafety as involving awareness of risk and ongoing\nuse of control processes. Thus it relates to a newer\napproach to safety where the focus is to ensure\nthat the complex system can detect and adapt to\nnew risks (Hale, Heming, Carthey, & Kirwan,\n1997; Rankin, Lundberg, Woltjer, Rollenhagen, &\nHollnagel, 2013; Saleh, Marais, Bakolas, & Cow-\nlagi, 2010; Woods, Dekker, Cook, Johannesen, &\nSarter, 2010). Resilience is a term that refers the\ncapability of a complex system to maintain safe\noperations and the ability to fulfill its objectives\ndespite new pressures or constraints. The resil-\nience engineering approach to safety therefore\nemphasizes the system's ability to respond to\nchanges in risk (Cook & Nemeth, 2006; Woods &\nFunctions identified as fundamental to resil-\nience include monitoring for changes and\nthreats, anticipating changes and being proac-\ntive, ensuring the capability to respond to dis-\nruptions, learning from past experiences (Holl-\nnagel, 2009), management commitment, flexi-\nbility, buffering capacity, awareness of risk\nResilience in Hit Management 267\n(Carthey, De Leval, & Reason, 2001; Costella,\nSaurin, & de Macedo Guimar\u00e3es, 2009; Woods,\n2006), and using control systems to maintain\nfunctioning in dynamic conditions (Hollnagel,\nMuch of the empirical research on resilience\nhas occurred in the energy, aerospace, petro-\nchemical, and transportation industries (Costella\net al., 2009; Hollnagel, Woods, & Leveson,\n2006). Compared to these domains, the system\ndynamics in health care can be considered to be\nmore influenced by the intentions of social\nactors (Pejtersen & Rasmussen, 1997). Another\ndifference is that preventable bad outcomes are\nrelatively common and often undetected in\nhealth care, unlike in these other domains\ngrowing literature on resilience in health care\n(e.g., Wears, Hollnagel, & Braithwaite, 2013),\nincluding health information technology (HIT;\nas yet no empirical studies of resilience in man-\nagement of EHRs.\nUnderstanding successful practices in the\nmanagement of EHR-related safety is critical\ngiven the inherent safety risks associated with\nEHRs (Ash, Sittig, Campbell, Guappone, &\nDykstra, 2007; Karsh, Weinger, Abbott, &\nof HIT in the United States (Coiera, Aarts, &\nKulikowski, 2012). In view of the dynamic\ncomplexity of EHR-enabled health care delivery\nsystems (Carayon et al., 2006; Kannampallil,\nSchauer, Cohen, & Patel, 2011; Sittig & Singh,\n2010), we propose that successful safety man-\nagement of EHRs entails the use of resilience-\nrelated practices. The primary goal of this study\nwas to identify the role of resilient safety prac-\ntices in the management of EHR safety. While\nthe specific practices are situated in the domain\nof health care, the patterns in how the practitio-\nners cope with complexity may reflect general\nstrategies used in other domains that, like health\ncare, are also trying to maintain resilience while\nintroducing automation into complex sociotech-\nnical systems where boundaries between safe\nand unsafe can often get fuzzy. Thus, a second-\nary goal of the study was to go beyond the spe-\ncific domain and see how these practices relate\nto more general, domain-independent patterns\nof dealing with challenges in complex systems\nTo collect evidence on practices to successfully\nmanage EHRs within complex sociotechnical\nsystems, we focused on safety practices used in\nlarge health care systems that have had many\nyears of experience successfully managing HIT\nquality and safety.\nMethod\nThis study was part of a larger project\non EHR safety (Singh, Ash, & Sittig, 2013)\nthat involved numerous interviews, each one\nfocused on one of the facets of HIT identified\nas key risk areas (Magrabi, Ong, Runciman,\nThese key risk areas were computerized physi-\ncian order entry, clinical decision support, test\nresults reporting, communication between pro-\nviders, patient identification, EHR downtime\nevents, EHR customization and configuration,\nsystem-system interface data transfer, and HIT\nsafety-related human skills. Our settings were\ntwo very large private health care systems in the\nUnited States regarded as successful pioneers in\nEHR implementation, each with over 20 years\nof experience using clinical IT systems. These\ntwo systems are Partners HealthCare (Teich\net al., 1999) and Geisinger Health Systems\nWe conducted interviews with 56 key infor-\nmants (36 from Partners, 20 from Geisinger).\nThe informants were identified by leadership\ncontacts at each facility, based on each infor-\nmant's expertise in one or more of the key risk\nareas listed above. Thus, the interviews were\nbroadly focused on EHR safety as it related to\nthe expertise of the key informant rather than\nonly on the use of resilient safety practices.\nInformants' roles included chief medical infor-\nmation officer, director of nursing informatics,\ndirector of pharmacy informatics, director of IT\noptimization/innovation, risk manager, and phy-\nsician project specialist. The interviews were\nsemistructured, consisting of questions pertain-\ning to that informant's unique expertise and\nresponsibilities, and included open-ended ques-\ntions inviting the informant to raise issues of his\nor her own. Hence a different set of questions\n268 September 2014 - Journal of Cognitive Engineering and Decision Making\nwas used for each participant. All interviews\nwere recorded and transcribed. Interview tran-\nscript lengths ranged from 2,000 words to\nwords.\nConceptually, we approached the analysis of\ninterview data using a systems resilience engi-\nneering framework (Costella et al., 2009; Holl-\nview transcripts using framework analysis\n(Ritchie & Spencer, 2002), a qualitative method-\nology that allows for both a \"top-down\" analysis\nusing an existing framework and a \"bottom-up\"\nanalysis for emergent themes or patterns. Thus,\nour analysis accounted for both anticipated\nresilience-related concepts, such as monitoring,\nanticipation, and sensitivity to risks, as well as\nnew information that did not readily fit within\nour framework.\nUsing an iterative process, the transcripts\nwere reviewed and statements relating to safety\npractices and any resilience-related concepts\nwere coded as such. Then the coded items were\nreviewed to more specifically identify in what\nways they reflected aspects of resilient safety\npractices. Afterward, these codes were reviewed\nand used in a process of iterative categorization\nin which coded items were grouped according to\nhow they reflected concepts related to resilience.\nAs various categorizations illuminated different\npatterns, items were recategorized accordingly.\nFrom this process, the final set of categories\nemerged. Then the literature was searched to\nconfirm that each of the category concepts had\nbeen identified independently in other research\non safety in complex domains (see Discussion).\nThe Atlas.ti software package (ATLAS.ti Scien-\ntific Software Development GmbH, Berlin, Ger-\nmany) was used for coding passages of tran-\nscripts. As part of the emphasis on domain-inde-\npendent patterns, the coding was performed by a\nresearch team member with a background in\ncognitive systems engineering rather than health\ncare operations or health information systems.\nTo enhance credibility of the analysis (Patton,\n2002), corroboration was performed by looking\nfor conflicts between our initial coding and cat-\negorization results versus coding on general HIT\nsafety issues and detailed interview summaries,\nall generated independently by other research\nteam members as part of the parent project\nResults\nInformants and Statements\nFrom the interview transcripts, we identified\n156 statements or references regarding resilient\npractices from 41 different informants. The\ninformants represented a diverse range of roles\nand included physicians, IT personnel, and qual-\nity and safety personnel (Table 1).\nCategorization\nOur analysis generated five main categories,\neach with two or more subcategories (Table\n2). The categories reflect the resilience func-\ntions of sensitivity to risks, monitoring, control\nTable 1: Facility and Roles of Key Informants\nInformants Interviewed Mentioned Resilient Practices\nFacility \nRole \n Other clinical operations 8 5\n Safety, quality, and security 7 6\nResilience in Hit Management 269\nsystems, responding, anticipation, and mindful-\nness. Examples and details for each category\nlevel and subcategory are in Table 2.\n1. Sensitivity to Fundamental Risks\nStatements in this category referred to the\norganization's awareness of basic threats to the\nsafe operation of HIT systems.\nWe absolutely have to test every one\nof them [monthly software patches from\nvendor]. . . . We may report an issue . . .\nand they [the vendor] work on it, and they\nhave a fix for it ready. . . . They say, \"OK,\nyeah, we have this ready. We can send you\nthe fix.\" But when we do that [implement\nthe fix], that fix also touches all these\nother things . . . and all those other things\nalso had fixes. So now this one fix you\nwant, you have to bring in 50 others.\nA. Awareness of the need for ongoing safety\nanalysis, including review and documenta-\ntion. Informants described the need for testing\nand post-implementation monitoring, even\nwhen software was off-the-shelf without any\nadd-ons (\"No one ever just puts it in place and\nlets it go\"). Informants also mentioned periodic\nTable 2: Levels of Resilient Practices\nLevel Summary of Practices\n1. Sensitivity to fundamental risks\nA. Awareness of need for monitoring\nB. \nSensitivity to dynamics and\ninterdependencies\nThe informants recognized the dynamic nature\nof the HIT systems and how they are used, and\nthe interdependencies between parts of the HIT\nsystems and the larger health care system and\nhow these can affect patient safety risks.\n2.

Furthermore, some were aware of\nlimitations and overly narrow system boundaries\nin the conceptual model of the system used to\nguide the quality control process.\nNote. HIT = health information technology.\n270 September 2014 - Journal of Cognitive Engineering and Decision Making\nreviews of policies and order sets and revisiting\ndecisions to disable particular EHR safety fea-\ntures. They mentioned the importance of docu-\nmenting the processes by which EHR\ncomponents are implemented and monitored,\nand documenting workflow because workflows\nchange. Two informants expressed sensitivity to\nthe risks faced by health care facilities that are\nnew to EHRs: \"They don't know what they\ndon't know.\"\nB. Sensitivity to dynamics and interdepen-\ndencies in these sociotechnical systems.Some\ncomments emphasized the volatility of both the\nEHR system and the larger context of the health\ncare industry. Informants mentioned several\nfactors that changed the risk profile of the sys-\ntem over time, including the increasing length\nof patient notes (\"note bloat\"), providers' alert\nfatigue, and customization of the EHR. One\ninformant pointed out how risks related to\npatient identification could affect a broad range\nof functions, from medication administration to\nfood delivery.\nSeveral comments referred to the interface\nbetween the EHR and other system components.\nFor instance, one informant recounted a problem\nthat resulted when another application vendor\nmadechangestoitsEHRsoftwarewithoutinform-\ning the facility, which led to problems with the\nintegration of the updated software with other\nsoftware in place. Another informant described\nthe complexity of adding a new drug into the order\nentry system; in order for the drug to be dispensed\ncorrectly, it also needed to be added to other parts\nof the system (pharmacy and bar-coding adminis-\ntration systems). These are examples of the infor-\nmants'sensitivity to the problem of asynchronous\nevolution of subsystems within integrated sys-\ntems, whereby changes in one subsystem lead it to\nbecome incompatible with the other subsystems\nFinally, informants were aware of how\nchanges in government policies, such as the\nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability\nAct of 1996 (HIPAA; Department of Health and\nHuman Services, n.d.) and \"meaningful use\" cri-\nteria (Blumenthal & Tavenner, 2010), affect\nworkflow and how these changes in workflow in\nturn affect software configuration and use\n(Campbell, Guappone, Sittig, Dykstra, & Ash,\n2009). The interdependency between software\nand workflow was also acknowledged in the\ninclusion of workflows into the software testing\nprocess and in a vendor-led process of require-\nments and specifications validation.\n2. Basic Monitoring and Responding\nPractices\nStatements in this category referred to ways\nin which facilities ensured that their EHRs con-\ntinued to operate as designed and fulfill their\nbasic functions.\nWe do a tremendous amount of testing\nbefore any release upgrade. The team reads\nall of the release notes. We do integrative\ntesting, unit testing. We do a dry run. We\ndo testing where we have two weeks where\nalmost all hands are on deck just the first two\nweeks that the new software is loaded into a\ntest system to see what we're breaking.\nA. Processes of testing and tracking.Infor-\nmants used various testing practices and other\nstrategies to assess the functioning of EHR sys-\ntems. These included testing in development plat-\nforms and in the live platforms using test patients.\nOne facility used the Leapfrog Group's safety\nassessment tool for computerized physician order\nentry systems (Classen, Avery, & Bates, 2007).\nSoftware upgrades were often mentioned as an\nimpetus for testing. The testing required by\nupgrades encompasses not only the upgrade itself\nbut also the ancillary systems that are integrated\nwith the upgraded software and the post-upgrade\npatches that are developed by the vendor as prob-\nlems are discovered. System configurations were\ntested to ensure compatibility with clinical work-\nflows. In addition, several informants mentioned\ntesting the integration between components. One\ninformant specifically described a test that\nincluded not only sending information to the\npharmacy but also calling the pharmacy to ask\nhow the information was displayed on the screen.\nInformants mentioned practices designed to\nencourage incident reporting and regular review\nof IT-related safety concerns. Other sources of\ninformation about risks included announce-\nments from the vendors and networking with\nother facilities that use the same EHR systems.\nResilience in Hit Management 271\nB. Processes for responding as part of qual-\nity and safety control feedback. Informants pre-\nsented many different ways they continually\nadjusted and corrected EHR systems. There\nwere processes and tools that facilitated rapid\nresponse to EHR issues by monitoring for acute\nproblems and alerting staff. For problems with a\nvendor's software, responses could involve\ninforming the vendor of problems discovered\nand sharing information about problems and\nsolutions with other facilities that use that ven-\ndor's EHR.\nReports of problems and incidents were\nreviewed with a focus on identifying potential\nareas for improvement and proposing solutions.\nResponses could be quite thorough in order to\nmaintain safety. In one case, when it was discov-\nered that many allergies had been entered into\nrecords not as coded data but as free text, which\nthe drug allergy checking algorithm could not\ndetect, the facility manually recoded the aller-\ngies in all the affected records.\nThe types of responses mentioned also\nincluded work-arounds. For example, because a\nsoftware system for managing dosing of antico-\nagulant medication did not integrate well with\nthe order entry system, there was a risk that\npatients would be prescribed the wrong dosage.\nIn response, the hospital developed software that\nprompted providers to double-check the dosages\nwhen discharging a patient on anticoagulants. A\nsimilar solution was developed to prompt pro-\nviders to double-check certain high-risk medica-\ntions during the medication reconciliation pro-\ncess performed when patients are discharged\nfrom the hospital. In addition to exploring work-\narounds as possible short-term solutions for\nrisks, facilities assessed the proposed work-\narounds for any risks they might introduce if\nthey were implemented.\n3. Management of Monitoring and\nResponding Practices\nStatements in this category referred to what\nthe facilities did to ensure they were able to\ncontinue to oversee and correct HIT operations.\nOne thing we try to stress, from a produc-\ntion support standpoint, is that when you\ndo your project life cycles, there should\nbe a line item there for an error [manage-\nment] process.\nA. Maintaining capability for testing and\ntracking. Informants stressed the importance of\nmaintaining resources for ongoing monitoring\nand review. They described staffing resources\nmade available for such functions, including\npeople to monitor logs of errors in information\ntransmission and people to perform various\nmanual testing operations. Organizational struc-\ntures were changed to use staffing resources\nmore effectively and efficiently. For example,\ngroups of informaticians and risk management\nspecialists were moved to integrate better with\nfront-line care staff.\nInformants mentioned resources dedicated to\nhelp people report safety risks or incidents.\nThese include incentives for physicians, systems\nto track the status of the facility's response to the\nissue, and specific tools to enable providers to\neasily comment on the appropriateness of deci-\nsion support recommendations.\nTo use testing resources efficiently, they were\napplied based on the likelihood of uncovering\nsomething important. The degree of testing was\nadjusted to the estimated impact of the imple-\nmentation on clinical processes. For example,\ninformants mentioned how a forthcoming major\nupdate to the EHR was undergoing rigorous test-\ning but that smaller changes to the system\nreceived less intensive testing. They also men-\ntioned how most problems were usually discov-\nered early on, in the pilot testing, which allowed\nfor corrections to be made before the software\nwas fully implemented.\nSoftware tools to support monitoring were\nalso mentioned. These included tools for auto-\nmatically monitoring the interfaces between\nsubsystems and a tool for tracking safety issues\n(Walker, Hassol, Bradshaw, & Rezaee, 2012).\nOne facility replaced periodic error reports with\ncontinuous error log monitoring. Another use of\ntechnology was the automation of a multistep\nsoftware testing process. Scripts were used to\nefficiently run a battery of standard tests. One\ninformant mentioned testing the accuracy and\npotential impact of decision support algorithms\nin a way that did not impact providers. The algo-\nrithms were run in \"stealth mode,\" without\n272 September 2014 - Journal of Cognitive Engineering and Decision Making\nshowing the alert messages to clinicians but\nstoring results in a log for review. In an addi-\ntional example of the use of tools to detect prob-\nlems early on, a thermal scanner was used to\ndetect unusually hot electrical connections\nbetween devices in the data center serving the IT\nsystem.\nAs the use and scale of the EHR evolved,\ntools were created in response to the accompa-\nnying risks. One evolving risk was from bad\ninformation accidently entered into charts due to\nimprecise copying and pasting from older notes\nin the EHR, instead of clinicians manually enter-\ning in all the text documentation (Hammond,\nHelbig, Benson, & Brathwaite-Sketoe, 2003).\nOne facility developed a tool to monitor the\nextent of copying and pasting in their charts.\nAnother tool was developed to identify instances\nof potential mismapping between a patient and a\nrecord. It detected unusual modifications made\nto patient identification information (e.g., updat-\ning birthday or full name), as would occur when\nPerson B's record was being altered under the\nfalse assumption that it belonged to Person A.\nAnother example of software developed in\nresponse to a problem was a tool that automati-\ncally checked for addressing and routing prob-\nlems that could prevent correct delivery of\npathology reports to the ordering providers.\nB. Maintaining capability for respond-\ning. Informants also stressed the importance of\nmaintaining the resources necessary for respond-\ning to problems that arise. Furthermore, one\nmentioned the value of a process for ensuring\nresolution of issues by escalating unresolved\nones to relevant leadership. Another informant\nemphasized preemptively validating particular\nerror management processes to ensure that the\nteam can fix any known problems with software\nshould they occur after the software is imple-\nmented on the live platform. In other words, a\nteam may set up an error on a test platform and\nsee if it is possible to repair it with the constraints\npresent on the live production platform.\nInformants mentioned a few specific examples\nofmaintainingresponsecapabilities.Asinstructed\nby the supervisor, a junior IT person performed a\nmaintenance operation on a live in-use (but\nredundant) part of the IT infrastructure in order to\nbecome more comfortable with working on live\nin-use IT systems should the need arise. To be\navailable in case of problems with a significant\nupgrade being installed on the live system, a large\nIT team remained on site the entire night. In order\nto implement changes more rapidly, some infor-\nmaticians were dedicated to and co-located with\nspecific front-line clinical operations.\nC. Enabling safety and quality control in an\neffective and efficient way.Some informants\nmentioned practices for securing resources for\nquality improvement. One informant used data\nfrom assessments and monitoring to facilitate\nbudget negotiations for resources for safety.\nOther practices mentioned were to use the\nresources more effectively and efficiently. One\nexample was embedding informatics staff with\nclinical groups in order to speed up the cycle of\nproblem detection and response. Many practices\ninvolved using IT tools to support the quality\nimprovement process, such as providing infor-\nmation to stakeholders via databases and report-\ning engines. Informants mentioned specific\nexamples of using IT to improve the process of\nmonitoring performance and implementing\nadaptations. In one example concerning the tool\nused by clinicians to view information on\npatients who had been transferred into that facil-\nity, software tracked the way clinicians custom-\nized the display of information fields. That data\nwere then used to identify which fields to priori-\ntize in the redesigns of the patient transfer forms.\nAnother example was a practice aimed at reduc-\ning alert fatigue. Pop-up warnings for drug-drug\ninteractions were monitored to see which ones\nwere overridden by providers on a consistent\nbasis; those warnings for which the providers\nhad found no value were removed in order to\nreduce alert fatigue (Phansalkar et al., 2010).\n4. Sensitivity to Risks Beyond the\nHorizon\nStatements in this category referred to facili-\nties' strategies of predicting and proactively\nmanaging problems that could occur in future\nHIT systems and in the larger sociotechnical\nsystem beyond the HIT system itself.\nWe have to be proactive here. . . . You\nknow why? Because if you're up at\n2 o'clock in the morning and trying to deal\nResilience in Hit Management 273\nwith a production problem where some-\none's life may be in danger, you want to\nbe proactive. You want to have the work\ndone ahead.\nA. Processes and mechanisms for being pro-\nactive. Several informants mentioned the role\nof testing and evaluation to proactively identify\nproblems. One informant stressed the close\nevaluation of software upgrades to facilitate\nresponding to potential problems during the\nupgrade process. Another mentioned that \"most\nof the bigger issues get found in pilot phase. . . .\nWe can . . . make corrections before it even gets\nrolled out anywhere else.\"\nInformants mentioned the use of reviews to\nidentify potential hazards with new EHR imple-\nmentations.Inpreparationforgoinglivewithanew\ninpatient system, one facility conducted a thorough\nprospectiveriskassessment,involvingawiderange\nof clinical staff (Hundt et al., 2013).Another type of\nprospective risk assessment mentioned was valida-\ntion sessions with the vendor of an EHR, to assess\nfit with workflows and identify gaps.\nAdditionally, one informant stressed the need\nfor resources and processes to make sure issues\nwere detected proactively and were acted upon.\nThis included having effective communication\nchannels with leadership to ensure that issues\nget addressed. Informants at both facilities men-\ntioned having governance committees that\nreviewed proposed additions or modifications to\nthe clinical IT systems and changes to clinical\nknowledge structures (e.g., decision rules, tem-\nplates). These committees included people from\nclinical, IT, operations, and risk management.\nAlso mentioned were efforts to ensure that rep-\nresentatives of various groups, including end\nusers, were involved in HIT decisions.\nInformants mentioned processes to keep lead-\nership and other stakeholders informed about the\nrisks in the system. This included reports to HIT\nand clinical steering committees, reviews of sig-\nnificant safety issues with the management team\nand the executive committee, and notifications to\nsenior leadership (Belmont et al., 2013). Another\npractice was a daily teleconference involving\nrepresentatives from various locations in the sys-\ntem, in which open issues including safety and\nEHR concerns were discussed.\nB. Controlling risk at governance\nlevel.Informants also shared examples con-\ncerning how knowledge of potential risks was\nused in decisions about IT implementation.\nThese examples included: deciding to not install\nsome software because of problems detected\nahead of time, disabling some EHR functional-\nity because of the associated risks, and install-\ning major version upgrades only after the\nsubsequent wave of software patches from the\nvendor had been issued.\nOne facility was migrating from a custom\nbest-of-breed system (using components from\nvarious developers) to an integrated off-the-\nshelf system in response to the risks posed by\ncontinued use of a \"fragmented\" and \"siloed\"\nsystem. Informants also mentioned instances\nwhere investments in new HIT-based safety\nprojects were made only after explicit assess-\nments of risks.\nInformants mentioned using anticipated risks\nto inform decisions about resource investments\nfor safety. One informant stressed how there\nwould still be a need for resources for EHR con-\nfiguration and evaluation even after the pending\nmigration to an off-the-shelf system. Another\nmentioned the need to expand the current IT\nbackup infrastructure to keep pace with the rapid\ngrowth of HIT in the facility.\nIdentifying future needs could also involve\nfactors outside the immediate focus of EHR\nsafety. One informant gave an example of this\ninvolving the meaningful-use EHR reimburse-\nment requirement (Blumenthal & Tavenner,\n2010) concerning greater use of patient portals.\nBecause recent lab results and current medica-\ntion lists were now more visible to patients, the\nclinicians became under pressure to make sure\nthose parts of the record were accurate and up-\nto-date. However, due to workforce distributions\nand rules regarding scopes of practice, nonphy-\nsicians were unable to offload the extra work\nnow required of the primary care physicians.\n5. Reflecting on Risks With the Safety\nand Quality Control Process Itself\nStatements in this category referred to meth-\nods by which the facilities recognized and\naddressed ways the safety and quality control\nprocess itself could fail.\n274 September 2014 - Journal of Cognitive Engineering and Decision Making\nWhat the [information systems] leader\nthinks is happening, in fact, isn't necessar-\nily what's happening.\nA. Limitations of monitoring methods.Infor-\nmants emphasized the importance of the quality\nand accuracy of the information in the system, one\nstating that \"the flow of information about poten-\ntial errors needs to be very high quality.\" The limi-\ntations of incident reports and verbal feedback\nwerementionedbytwoinformants,whodescribed\nthem as incomplete sources of information.\nInformants mentioned the limitations of test-\ning and how problems have been encountered in\nlive EHR systems despite thorough prior testing.\nThey suggested many reasons. Problems related\nto specific and infrequently encountered interac-\ntions or other circumstances would be more\nlikely to appear only during widespread regular\nuse, not during limited, pre-live testing. Auto-\nmated testing tools would not necessarily work\nfor a facility's particular customizations, nor\nwould testing environments necessarily capture\nall the relevant aspects of the real world system.\nTesting may not have encompassed the range of\nupstream and downstream components that\ncould be involved in a safety issue.\nInformants referred to alternative methods\nused to mitigate the limitations of current moni-\ntoring methods. Focus groups and surveys with\nend users were used to solicit feedback on\npatient transfer and handoff tools. After scripts\nand configurations of IT products were set up, a\nsecond IT person would review them before\nthey were implemented.\nThe way users performed tasks with the soft-\nware was monitored to see if they had to perform\nwork-arounds due to shortcomings with the soft-\nware and its fit with the users'workflows. Devel-\nopers used a similar approach to evaluate a hand-\noff tool designed to provide all the necessary\ninformation for clinical staff taking over respon-\nsibility of patients. Clinicians were asked if any\ninformation was missing and also what problems\narose or additional tasks were required as a result\nof information not being available.\nB. Sensitivity to failure in the quality control\nprocess. One informant mentioned some limi-\ntations with the quality control process itself\nrelated to software and workflow validation.\nOne aspect of this was how the introduction of\nnew software functionality almost always\noccurred in the context of other concurrent\nchanges, meaning that confounding factors\nmade it difficult to establish the particular role of\nthe EHR intervention in affecting outcomes. To\nimprove the quality control process itself, facili-\nties monitored the implementation of EHR inter-\nventions more closely and implemented tools to\nsupport collaboration across departments.\nSome informants raised questions about the\nunderlying assumptions regarding the function-\ning and scope of the EHR system. One pointed\nout that many patients move about the country\nbut still need continuity of care, thus requiring\nEHRs to support real-time health information\nexchange over a much wider geographic range\nof clinical partners than currently supported.\nAddressing the need for continuity and coordi-\nnation of care across different facilities, another\ninformant suggested that EHRs could and should\ndo more to support coordination beyond the cur-\nrent function of simply exchanging minimal\nclinical data.\nOne informant mentioned an effort illustrating\nhow IT managers were willing to acknowledge\nthe risk of problematic inaccuracies in their own\ninterpretations of the current state of the EHR.\nWork on mitigating these limitations included\nplans for software to automatically capture addi-\ntional data on the current state of the EHR.\nCredibility Assessment\nOur findings were evaluated against the\nindependently generated codes on HIT safety in\ngeneral and the independently authored detailed\nsummaries of the interviews for each of the\nfacilities, all generated as part of the parent proj-\nect (Singh et al., 2013). There were no conflicts\nbetween our findings and those coding results\nand detailed summaries.\nTo confirm that the categories reflect prac-\ntices at both facilities, we assessed the distribu-\ntion of the topics of the comments within and\nacross the two facilities. A chi-square test of the\nnumber of comments from Partners and Geis-\ninger for each of the five levels indicates no sig-\nnificant difference in proportions across facili-\nties and category levels (p = .310).\nResilience in Hit Management 275\nDiscussion\nCategorization of Statements About\nResilient Safety Practices\nWe conducted interviews with 56 key infor-\nmants from two large health care systems rec-\nognized as leaders in use of HIT and EHRs.\nThe interviews focused on HIT and EHR safety\nissues related to the various roles of the infor-\nmants, which included IT, informatics, clini-\ncal providers, and safety and quality manag-\ners. Forty-one participants mentioned practices\nthat reflected some element of the resilience\napproach to safety. Overall, there were 156\nreferences to resilient practices. The practices\ncovered a wide range of activities related to\nresilience in health care systems. For instance,\ntors of institutional resilience in health care\nsystems are reflected in the set of practices. The\nresults also show how these facilities engaged\nin practices that support different levels of\nHIT safety: the functioning of the HIT systems\nthemselves, the co-evolution of workflow and\nHIT systems to enhance performance, and the\napplication of IT to new ways for facilitating\nOur analysis generated a categorization of\nfive levels, each with two or more subcategories.\nThe levels reflect some primary resilience func-\ntions: sensitivity to risks (Costella et al., 2009;\ncontrol systems to track and modify perfor-\nmance of safety-related operations (Hollnagel,\nanticipating changes and being proactive (Holl-\nWoods, 2011), and mindfulness and reflection\non the risks related to the safety management\nWoods et al., 2010; Woods, Schenk, & Allen,\nThe practices that reflect resilience are cer-\ntainly not the only practices important for HIT\nsafety. The importance of best practices in soft-\nware design, usability testing, and implementa-\ntion have been stressed (Middleton et al., 2013;\nOffice of the National Coordinator, 2012). Other\ndevelopments in systems safety, such as high\nreliability theory (Roberts, 1990), can also offer\nsome contributions. However, the results here\nemphasize the need for facilities to practice\nactive monitoring and management beyond the\ninitial development and implementation stages.\nThey include practices regarding managing\nresource constraints and other trade-offs, which\nis not addressed by high reliability theory.\nGeneric Patterns That Facilitate\nResilience\nBecause we interviewed informants who\nwere engaged in the real-world work of manag-\ning HIT systems in large health care systems,\nwe have made certain that our findings are\necologically valid and grounded in real-world\npractice. In accordance with the research agenda\nof cognitive systems engineering (Woods &\nHollnagel, 2006), it is important to complement\nthis focus on a specific context by addressing\ngeneric, domain-independent patterns in how\nwork is accomplished in complex systems (i.e.,\nmacrocognitive functions; Cacciabue & Hol-\nlnagel, 1995). We look beyond the specific cat-\negories by exploring the commonalities among\nthem, establishing an interpretation of the find-\nings in terms of underlying functions that facili-\ntate resilience.\nReflection.\nThe relationship between the\nfive category levels can be seen in terms of how\na critical and reflective view of one level is nec-\nessary for the implementation of the subsequent\nlevel.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Level 1 (sensitivity to fundamental risks) is the\ncritical recognition of dynamic risks to which the\nsystem is vulnerable.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Even though the risks are ensconced in uncertainty,\nin Level 2 (basic monitoring and responding prac-\ntices), the risks are seen as subject to prediction\nand management via systematic measurement and\nintervention.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 In Level 3 (management of monitoring and\nresponding practices), these systematic measure-\nments and interventions are acknowledged as\noperations that require resources and oversight.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 This ongoing need--for resources and oversight\nto manage risk--presents pressures for efficiency\nand effectiveness. Thus in Level 4 (sensitivity to\nrisks beyond the horizon), there is the recognition\n276 September 2014 - Journal of Cognitive Engineering and Decision Making\nof the need for planning, anticipation of future\ndemands, and proactive management.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Because of the anticipation of future demands and\nplanning for them, there is in Level 5 (reflecting\non risks with the safety and quality control pro-\ncess itself) recognition of the potential problems\nowing to the limits of the current safety manage-\nment approach itself.\nReflection is related to a basic pattern in how\ncognitive systems manage complex work. The\ncapacity to shift and contrast perspectives is\nessential in exploring complex situations, gener-\nating alternate courses of action, and coordinat-\ning work with others (Woods et al., 2010; Woods\n& Hollnagel, 2006;). The presence of multiple\npotential points of view encourages reflection\nand critical evaluation of a given point of view\n(Hoffman & Woods, 2011). Reflection is also\nrelated to one of the basic functions required\nAs part of organizational learning (Argyris\n& Schon, 1996), reflective practice (Sch\u00f6n,\n1983) involves being able to detect problems\nwith and make corrections for one's current\nconceptual model or perspective. This practice\nis called \"double-loop\" learning, as it serves as\nan overarching control loop for improving one's\nperformance at one's normal control loop tasks\nTranscending boundaries. In all of the cate-\ngory levels, there are examples of organiza-\ntional or technical boundaries being crossed as\npart of efforts to support resilience. The bound-\naries of the IT system, as implied by standard\nHIT use cases (e.g., Cusack et al., 2009), are\ncrossed in the work of HIT systems safety. The\ninformants were sensitive to interactions and\nrisks from various sources, not just IT. They\nconsidered impacts to safety from diverse influ-\nences, such as external regulations (HIPAA and\nmeaningful use, and also scope of practice) and\nthe effect of patients' direct access to their\nrecords. As a means of learning about risks and\nresponding to them, it was a regular practice to\ncommunicate about problems with both the\nvendor and other health care facilities external\nto their own health care system. Furthermore, as\npresented in Level 5, Part B (sensitivity to fail-\nure in quality control process), a few informants\nexplicitly questioned the scope of the HIT sys-\ntem itself.\nOne definition of resilience is \"stretching at\nand beyond boundaries\" (Woods, Chan, &\nWreathall, 2013). This definition emphasizes\nhow fixation (De Keyser & Woods, 1990) on\npredefined boundaries or scopes of influence\ncan hamper safety management (Reiman & Rol-\nlenhagen, 2011). Important risks and opportuni-\nties may be overlooked if there is too narrow a\nview taken on the scope of activities to be moni-\ntored or leverage points to be utilized (Woods\net al., 2010). In contrast, the function of \"seeing\nthe bigger picture\" can facilitate resilience.\nSharp-end stakeholders.Across the category\nlevels, there are examples of sharp-end practitio-\nners (e.g., physicians, nurses) serving as active\nstakeholders in the safety management process,\nserving to establish a degree of distributed control\nof the operations of the HIT systems. This role is\nin contrast to the idea that sharp-end practitioners\nunder automated supervisory control can respond\nto the technology only through compliance or\nresistance (see Greenhalgh et al., 2009). Resil-\nience is enhanced by facilitating influence up the\nchain of command (Carthey et al., 2001) and by\nsharing some control with sharp-end practitioners\nthe function of distributing and coordinating the\ncontrol of safety across the blunt-end/sharp-end\nspectrum may facilitate resilience.\nThese two health care systems established\nand maintained practices and tools for the pur-\npose of obtaining input from the front-line pro-\nviders. Informatics and risk management staff\nwere moved to front-line clinical organizations\nto facilitate problem detection and solving. Tools\nwere developed for end users to report issues\nand track the organization's response. Evalua-\ntions of the IT system included identifying\nwhich parts were helpful and not helpful for end\nusers (e.g., drug-drug interaction alerts, fields in\npatient transfer templates). Of course, these\npractices constitute only a small range of the\npossible ways control of the HIT system can be\ndistributed. However, they do show the value of\ninvolving sharp-end practitioners as a part of\nongoing system management, versus only dur-\ning an initial requirements elicitation or usabil-\nity evaluation phase.\nResilience in Hit Management 277\nRecommendations and Future Work\nThe U.S. health care system is undergoing\na significant transformation as more and more\nhealth care facilities, including smaller clinics\nand private practices, adopt EHRs and other\nHIT. Proposals for enhancing EHR safety have\nemphasized user-centered design approaches\nand usability testing, and the use of incident\nreporting, collection, and analysis systems at\na large scale (Middleton et al., 2013; Office of\nthe National Coordinator, 2012). Although these\nare valuable and necessary methods for improv-\ning safety, the results of this study suggest that\nEHR safety also depends on persistent testing\nand monitoring (Sittig & Classen, 2010; Walker\net al., 2008), especially in terms of ongoing\nappraisal of sociotechnical factors that affect the\nuse and maintenance of the EHR.\nAlthough smaller clinics and private prac-\ntices have less overall complexity than large\nhealth care systems, they are still subject to\ndynamics and interdependencies that affect risk.\nVast numbers of the facilities now adopting HIT\nlack experience with and/or resources for safety\nassessment and management of HIT systems\n(Walker et al., 2008). There is a high demand for\nworkers with HIT operation skills (Furukawa,\nThese conditions will exacerbate the risks\nrelated to dynamics and interdependencies.\nBy identifying the resilient practices used in a\ndomain, requirements for training and tools to\nsupport those practices can be developed (Hale,\nGuldenmund, & Goossens, 2006; Smith, Davis\nGiardina, Murphy, Laxmisan, & Singh, 2013).\nThe training for HIT workforce development\nshould address post-implementation quality and\nsafety control, including practices for resilience\nin complex sociotechnical systems.\nThe tools available for IT system administra-\ntors are poor at supporting the tasks involved in\nongoing supervision and management of IT sys-\ntems (Barrett et al., 2004). Such deficiencies are\nexacerbated in complex sociotechnical systems,\nlike health care. However, by designing the tools\nand processes to support collaboration and sen-\nsemaking (e.g., Watts-Perotti & Woods, 2009),\nthey will better support safety management.\nResilience will be further enhanced by incorpo-\nrating ways for sharp-end practitioners to\nparticipate in safety and quality control of IT\nsystems.\nBecause of the large numbers of new EHR\nadopters lacking in relevant skills and resources,\nit is more critical to develop techniques to sup-\nport awareness of the risks (Level 1) and their\nmonitoring and management (Level 2). One\nmethod to support awareness of risks is to iden-\ntify risk indicators that are easily detectable\nfacilitate monitoring include the development of\neasy-to-use measures (Sittig, Campbell, Guap-\npone, Dykstra, & Ash, 2007) and safety audit\nThe utility of the information collected via\nmonitoring can be enhanced through cognitive\nengineering approaches aimed at facilitating\ninterpretation of and responses to the information\n1999). This approach includes designing the dis-\nplay of and interaction with the information such\nthat it does not induce cognitive fixation on sys-\ntem boundaries and instead helps the practitio-\nners understand and manage the safety issues as\nthey manifest across system boundaries.\nThere are also techniques to support the mac-\nrocognitive function of reflection, identified as a\nfacilitator of resilient practices across the cate-\ngorization levels. Methods include doing \"pre-\nmortem\" analyses of proposals (Klein, 2007)\nand generating scenarios to explore new poten-\ntial risks (Carroll, 2000). Another method is to\nmake explicit the trade-off decisions between\ngoals that organizations face (e.g., being both\nefficient and thorough), thereby encouraging\nstakeholders to reflect on how safety is being\nmanaged (Branlat & Woods, 2011; Hoffman &\nLimitations\nIn this study, we collected data from only two\nhealth care systems. However, because both are\nleaders in the strategic application of HIT, and\nthe focus of the study is on the practices used by\nhealth care systems with the greatest experience\nand success in HIT use, this limitation should\nnot be seen as a threat to appropriate generaliz-\nability (Lipshitz, 2010). The two facilities are\ndifferent: Partners HealthCare is a loosely con-\nnected system of hospitals and clinics in a dense\n278 September 2014 - Journal of Cognitive Engineering and Decision Making\nmetropolitan area, using various EHR tools,\nmany developed internally, whereas Geisinger\nHealth Systems is a tightly integrated system in\na nonmetropolitan area, using a leading com-\nmercial EHR. This difference in conjunction\nwith the overlap of resilient practices across the\ntwo different facilities strengthens the generaliz-\nability.\nThis study did not include analysis of con-\ntrasting cases to check if facilities with less\nexperience or success in HIT management also\nshowed evidence of these practices. However,\nwe suspect those with less success are not likely\nto use the same practices, as there are some indi-\ncations that differences in HIT safety outcomes\nare related to HIT implementation practices and\nmanagement. For example, Han et al. (2005)\nreported on the unexpected increase in mortality\nat one facility following implementation of a\ncommercially sold computerized order entry\nsystem, whereas Longhurst et al. (2010) found a\ndecrease in their facility's mortality rate follow-\ning implementation of the same vendor's EHR\nbut with the use of much improved processes\nand management techniques (Sittig,Ash, Zhang,\nAnother limitation is that the information\nabout the practices came from interviews. We\ndid not perform observations or otherwise eval-\nuate for independent evidence of the practices.\nHowever, almost all of the practices were men-\ntioned by more than one informant. Some of\nthese facilities' practices have been the subject\nof scientific publications (Hundt et al., 2013;\nthese resilient practices were volunteered during\ninterviews about HIT safety in general (as per-\ntaining to the informant's role); the interviews\nwere not conducted as cognitive task analysis\ninterviews designed to elicit specific types of\nstrategies. This suggests that these practices\nwere strongly associated with general HIT safety\nin the minds of the informants. A methodology\nfocused on eliciting resilience-specific practices\nmight have uncovered additional ones.\nConclusions\nOur study of quality and safety control pro-\ncesses used for HIT by two leading health care\nsystems shows that resilient safety practices are\nan important part of safety in complex socio-\ntechnical systems. The practices mentioned\nwere categorized into five areas: (a) awareness\nof dynamics and interdependencies affecting\nrisk, (b) established monitoring and respond-\ning practices, (c) management of resources and\nmethods, (d) anticipating risks, and (e) reflect-\ning on limitations of the safety management\nprocess itself. These practices were facilitated\nby the functions of reflective learning, the\ncapability to revise system boundaries, and\nsystematic sharing of control with sharp-end\npractitioners.\n"
