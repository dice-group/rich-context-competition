Under this hypothesis, depression promotes analysis\nand problem-solving by focusing attention on the problem and reducing distractibility. This\npredicts that attentionally demanding problems will elicit depressed affect in subjects. We\nalso propose two control-process mechanisms by which depression could focus attention\nand reduce distractibility. Under these mechanisms, depression exerts a force on attention\nlike that of a spring when it is pulled or like a magnet on a steel ball. These mechanisms\nmake different predictions about how depressed people respond emotionally to a task that\npulls attention away from their problems. We tested these predictions in a sample of 115\nundergraduate students. Consistent with our main prediction, initially non-depressed\nsubjects experienced an increase in their depressed affect when exposed to an attentionally\ndemanding task.

Specifically, the effect of negative emotions on attention is thought to\nbe analogous to the influence of physical pain on attention. Physical pain draws attention to\nproblems that are causing, or threatening to cause, physical damage to the body, such as the\npain that one feels when one inadvertently puts one's hand on a hot surface (Eccleston and\nCrombez, 1999; Wall, 2000). Similarly, negative emotions are thought to have evolved to\ndraw attention to important problems in the environment (often of a social nature) that had\nan important impact on fitness and could be fixed or ameliorated with attention (Alexander,\nControl-process views of emotion suggest that they are related to progress or\nfrustration in finding solutions to problems or meeting goals (Carver, Lawrence, and\nScheier, 1996; Carver and Scheier, 1990). Negative emotions are elicited when one has not\nfound a solution to a problem or one is not making satisfactory progress towards a goal,\nand the emotion draws attention to the task of finding a solution. Conversely, positive\nemotions are elicited when one has found a solution or is making satisfactory progress\ntowards a goal, and the emotion keeps attention focused on the adaptive course. For\ninstance, courtship is emotionally painful when unrequited, and attention is directed to\nsolving the problem of successfully wooing the desired partner. However, positive emotion\nis elicited when the partner responds positively to the courtship, and attention and behavior\nstays focused on the same course, at least until progress towards the mating goal becomes\nunsatisfactory. Thus, the valence of emotion reflects whether or not progress towards a goal\nor a solution is being frustrated (Carver et al., 1996; Carver and Scheier, 1990).\nThere are many different negative emotions--e.g., anger, anxiety, disgust, fear,\njealousy--and they presumably evolved to influence attention in different ways. In this\npaper, we focus on the attentional function of depression or depressed affect, which is an\nemotion characterized by negative affect and low arousal.\nAlthough clinical depression is often assumed to be qualitatively different than\nsubclinical forms, explicit tests of this assumption have found that depressed affect is better\ncharacterized by a single dimension that varies continuously in intensity and duration\n(Aggen, Neale, and Kendler, 2005; Krueger and Markon, 2006). For instance, depressive\nsymptoms vary continuously in epidemiological samples (Hankin, Fraley, Lahey, and\nWaldman, 2005), and the degree of psychosocial impairment covaries linearly with the\nnumber of depressive symptoms (Kessler, Zhao, Blazer, and Swartz, 1997; Sakashita,\nSlade, and Andrews, 2007). We therefore use the terms depressed affect and depression to\nrefer to a single continuum that varies from transient sadness to chronic, severe, clinical\ndepression.\nThere is abundant evidence that depression influences attention. People with\nclinical or subclinical depression tend to report persistent ruminations about important\nproblems in their lives (Lyubomirsky, Tucker, Caldwell, and Berg, 1999). Indeed, people\nThe functional design of depression's influence on attention\nwith greater levels of depression tend to ruminate more and are less easily distracted from\ntheir ruminations (Just and Alloy, 1997; Lam, Smith, Checkley, Rijsdijk, and Sham, 2003;\nNolen-Hoeksema and Morrow, 1991; Schmaling, Dimidjian, Katon, and Sullivan, 2002).\nAttention is a limited resource (Kahneman, 1973), with one implication being that as\nattention becomes more focused on one problem, fewer cognitive resources are available\nfor other problems. Further evidence of depression's influence on attention thus comes\nfrom the fact that depressives' ruminations interfere with their ability to concentrate on\nother things. For instance, when people come into a psychological testing situation with\nclinical or subclinical depression, their ruminations interfere with their ability to focus on\ncognitive tasks and reduce their performance (Lyubomirsky, Kasri, and Zehm, 2003;\nWatkins and Brown, 2002; Watkins and Teasdale, 2001; Watkins, Teasdale, and Williams,\n2000). Such research suggests that depression focuses attention on the problems that caused\nthe episode, so much so that it interferes with people's ability to focus on other things. Put\nanother way, one of depression's effects is to focus attention and reduce distractibility.\nDepressives' focused attentional state can affect how they process information.\nResearch on pre-existing and experimentally induced mood indicates that depressed affect\npromotes an analytical processing style (Ambady and Gray, 2002; Au, Chan, Wang, and\nVertinsky, 2003; Bless, Bohner, Schwarz, and Strack, 1990; Bless, Mackie, and Schwarz,\n2005; Yost and Weary, 1996). Analytical reasoning involves dividing a complex problem\ninto smaller, more manageable components, where each is studied in turn. To arrive at the\nsolution to the whole, the solution to each component must be maintained in memory while\nprocessing on the next component takes place. Analytical reasoning therefore requires the\nuse of working memory, which holds information in a highly active state because it is\ncrucial to ongoing processing (Baddeley, 1996).\nThe Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices (RAPM) is considered one of the best\nmeasures of nonverbal analytical reasoning ability (Carroll, 1993). Each item is a spatial\npattern completion task in which one of eight choices correctly completes a two-\ndimensional visual array, and test items become progressively more difficult. The difficulty\nof test items increases, in part, because the number of elements in the array increases and\nthe rules for how they vary across the array can be different for each element (Carpenter,\nJust, and Shell, 1990). The rule for each element must be ascertained independently, so\nonce subjects figure out the rule for how one element varies across the array, they must\nkeep the solution in their working memory while they figure out the rules for the remaining\nelements. The number of elements that must be analyzed and held in working memory\nvaries from 1 to 5, and the proportion of people getting a test item correct is negatively\nrelated to the number of elements that must be analyzed (Carpenter et al., 1990).\nCurrent research indicates that analytical tasks with high working memory loads,\nsuch as the RAPM, are attentionally demanding because they leave little room for attention\nto wander (Kane and Engle, 2002). For instance, performance on the RAPM is highly\ncorrelated with the ability to resist distractions under attentionally demanding conditions,\nand the relationship is mediated by differential activity in areas of the brain known to be\nThe functional design of depression's influence on attention\ninvolved in attentional control (Gray, Chabris, and Braver, 2003).\nIn summary, depressed affect focuses attention on problems, and it promotes an\nanalytical processing style. Because analytical reasoning requires focused attention, it\nseems reasonable to hypothesize that depressed affect may promote an analytical\nprocessing style by its attention-focusing effects.\nWe suggest that depressed affect evolved as a response to important, analytically\nchallenging problems that could only be solved, if they could be solved at all, with an\nattentional state that was highly focused for a sustained period of time (Watson and\nAndrews, 2002). Under this hypothesis, depressed affect promotes analysis and problem-\nsolving by focusing attention on the problem and reducing distractibility.\nIf depressed affect is a response to analytically challenging problems, then a task\nsuch as the RAPM should be able to induce depressed affect in people with low levels of\ndepression. Established methods for inducing depressed mood involve having subjects\nlisten to sad music or watch sad movies, giving them negative feedback about their\nperformance on tasks, having them apply self-referent statements to themselves (e.g., \"I\nfeel a little down today\", \"I wish I could be myself, but nobody likes me when I am\")\n(Seibert and Ellis, 1991), and so on (Westermann, Spies, Stahl, and Hesse, 1996). There is\nalso substantial evidence that stressful life events can induce depression (Kendler,\nKarkowski, and Prescott, 1999). While cognitively effortful tasks are often used in methods\nthat rely on negative feedback, the feedback is almost always fixed (i.e., even people who\nperform well on the task are given negative feedback) (Westermann et al., 1996).\nMoreover, it is failure itself, and not the nature of the task, that is assumed to elicit\ndepressed affect. Our prediction that an analytically and attentionally challenging task can\ninduce depressed affect, and not failure per se, is, to our knowledge, novel and untested.\nThere are two potential control-process mechanisms by which depressed affect\ncould focus attention and reduce distractibility. First, depressed affect may keep attention\nfocused on a problem in a way that is similar to the force exerted by a spring. In this\nanalogy, the problem could be thought of as being attached to one end of the spring and\nattention to the other end. When the spring is compressed and relaxed, attention is focused\non the problem, and the force exerted by the spring is minimized. When the spring is\npulled, attention is pulled away from the problem, and the spring's force increases. If\ndepression's mode of action is like the force exerted by a spring, then depressed affect\nshould increase as attention is pulled from a focal problem, which would tend to draw\nattention back to the problem. Validation of the spring metaphor would suggest that, at the\ntime of measurement, depressed affect is a marker of the degree to which attention is\ndiverted from the problem that elicited the episode.\nAlternatively, depression's influence on attention could be more like the attractive\nforce on a steel ball produced by a magnet. In this analogy, the \"magnet\" is a difficult\nproblem (e.g., marital troubles). The attractive force that the problem generates is depressed\naffect, and it draws attention to the problem just as the magnetic force draws a steel ball to\nthe magnet. Since the magnetic force is greatest when the steel ball is closest to the magnet,\ndepressed affect should be greatest when attention is fully focused on the problem, where it\ntends to keep attention focused. When attention is diverted to some other problem,\ndepressed affect will decrease, just as the attractive force on the steel ball lessens as it is\nThe functional design of depression's influence on attention\npulled from the magnet. Validation of the magnet metaphor would therefore suggest that, at\nthe time of measurement, depressed affect is a marker of the degree to which attention is\nfocused and distractibility is reduced.\nWe stress that the terms magnet and spring are merely metaphors to describe the\npossible ways depressed affect could exert force on attention. However, we use them\nbecause they help describe the different mechanisms of action that we are hypothesizing.\nAccording to the hypothesis, depressed affect is a response to analytically and\nattentionally demanding problems that may take a long time to solve. Consequently, the\norganism might occasionally need to interrupt processing to deal with pressing issues that\nrequire immediate attention (e.g., predators, important social problems). After the issue has\nbeen dealt with, attention must return to the core problem that caused the depressive\nepisode. Since attention must be pulled from the core problem to be focused on the pressing\nissue, processing the pressing problem would be very difficult with a spring-like\nmechanism because a great deal of force must be expended to keep attention focused there.\nHowever, under a magnet-like mechanism, once attention was pulled away from the core\nproblem and focused on the pressing problem, less force would be needed to keep it there.\nThus, a magnet-like mechanism would be better from an engineering perspective.\nTo test between these two mechanisms, we measured subjects' level of depressed\naffect twice. The first assessment (T1) was a baseline measure to assess the level of\ndepression that they brought with them into the laboratory. Since depressed affect is\ncontinuously distributed in populations, people come into a psychological testing situation\nwith varying levels of depressed affect unless pre-screening takes place. The causes of their\ndepressive symptoms are assumed to reflect important pre-existing life issues, and we refer\nto this as their pre-existing depression.\nSubjects completed the second assessment (T2) of depressed affect after they had\nbeen given intervention--in this case, practice questions from the RAPM. The hypothesis\nthat depressed affect arises in response to an analytically and attentionally challenging\nproblem predicts that subjects with low levels of pre-existing depression should experience\nan increase after exposure to the intervention. We were concerned that after the subjects\nhad completed the attentionally demanding intervention, their attention would immediately\nrelax and we would be unable to detect the emotional effect we were looking for when they\ntook the T2 measure. So we devised the intervention's effect to be prolonged.\nThe intervention was also designed to get subjects with high levels of pre-existing\ndepression to pull their attention away from their pre-existing problems. The spring and\nmagnet mechanisms make different predictions about how they will respond emotionally to\nthe intervention. According to the spring metaphor, this is like pulling a spring, and\ndepressed affect should increase. Under the magnet metaphor, however, the intervention is\nlike pulling a steel ball away from a magnet. This should cause the level of depressed affect\nto decrease just as the magnetic force exerted on the ball decreases.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nThe 115 participants were University of New Mexico students recruited from\nThe functional design of depression's influence on attention\npsychology courses and participated in exchange for extra credit. The intervention group\nin the control group did not provide information about their sex or age.\nInstruments\nScale for assessing depressed affect. Since our two mood-state measures were to be\ncompleted within a few minutes of each other, we were concerned that subjects might\nremember their T1 answers when filling out the scales at T2. Moreover, we wanted to be\nable to detect subtle changes in affect. No existing instruments were adequate for these\npurposes.\nTo accomplish these goals, we constructed two parallel instruments (forms A and\nB) from a pool of 26 adjectives designed to assess state depression. The pool was\ncomposed of 16 negative and 10 positive affect adjectives, with each adjective having one\nsynonym (i.e., there were 13 sets of synonyms). From each paired synonym set, one\nadjective was assigned to each scale so that there were 13 adjectives on each form (e.g.,\n\"sad\" was on form A and \"blue\" was the form B synonym). Each adjective was rated on a\n9-point Likert scale according to how one was feeling right then (1=extremely inaccurate\nas a self-description, 9=extremely accurate as a self-description). The construction of two\ndifferent instruments that were roughly equivalent allowed us to reduce memory effects,\nand the use of multiple adjectives that were rated on Likert scales (as opposed to checklists)\nallowed us to detect subtle changes in affect.\nTo test for equivalence, we tested the factor structure of the forms on the control\ngroup. All subjects took both forms, counterbalanced for order. We used Mx (Neale, Boker,\nXie, and Maes, 2003) to perform a series of latent variable analyses using structural\nequation modeling (SEM). In SEM, variables are connected by a series of arrows that\nrepresent the presumed direction of causation. The likelihood is the probability of obtaining\nthe observed data under the assumptions of the model (e.g., a multivariate normal\ndistribution), and it is influenced by the unknown parameters in the model (e.g., the\nregression coefficients of the variables connected by arrows). Mx searches through the\nparameter space for the regression coefficients that maximize the likelihood. The fit of the\nmodel is -2 times the natural logarithm of the likelihood (-2LL). For our latent variable\nmodels, the latent measure of state depression is assumed to influence the observed\nmeasure for each adjective, and Mx uses the variance that the observed measures share in\ncommon to estimate the regression coefficients to the latent factor. To our knowledge, this\nis the first attempt to use maximum likelihood estimation techniques to test the equivalence\nof two instruments for assessing affective states.\nWith maximum likelihood, significance testing is done by calculating the difference\nin the fits between nested models, -2LL, which is asymptotically distributed as chi-square.\n(One model is \"nested\" inside another if the parameters to be estimated in the former are a\nsubset of the parameters of the latter.) A common significance test is to compare the fit\nbetween a model and a submodel in which a parameter is dropped from the structural\nequation path or constrained in its value. For instance, in a latent factor model in which two\nThe functional design of depression's influence on attention\nparameters are constrained to have equal loadings onto the latent factor, an insignificant\nincrease in fit is evidence that the parameters do not have significantly different loadings.\nWe first tested whether the 26 items were better described by one or two latent\nfactors. The two-factor model fit significantly better (negative affect items loaded high on\nthe first factor and positive affect items loaded high on the second factor), -2LL=374.44,\ndf=27, p<.0001. We retained all the negative affect items from the first factor because\nthey appeared to be more closely related to depressed affect (e.g., sad, cheerless, somber,\nlonely). This reduced the forms from 13 items each to eight each. Then, we conducted eight\ntests (one for each synonym pair), in which we tested whether the items in the pair had\nsignificantly different loadings on the latent factor. Based on these tests, we deleted two\nmore pairs. The remaining six synonym pairs passed a strict test of factorial invariance in\nwhich each item and its synonym were simultaneously constrained to load equally onto the\nWe also gave subjects in both groups the Beck Depression Inventory, which is a\ncommonly used instrument for assessing depressed affect over the past two weeks (Beck,\nWard, Mendelson, Mock, and Erbaugh, 1961). It is not state-like enough for our purposes,\nand so we only used it to validate our constructed scales.\nTable 1.

We gave subjects in the intervention group\nquestions from the RAPM, which was described above. The full RAPM is considered one\nof the best measures of nonverbal analytical reasoning ability and fluid intelligence with an\ninternal consistency reliability of about 0.90 and a validity of about 0.80 in measuring\nThe functional design of depression's influence on attention\nProcedure\nThe protocols were completed in classroom settings. For the control protocol, each\nparticipant first read the instructions for either form A or form B (counterbalanced for\norder) for the T1 assessment of affect and then completed it. After completing the first\nform, they then read the instructions for the T2 assessment of affect and then completed it.\nConsequently, the time between the two measures was short. Subjects were also given the\nBDI and answered a short background questionnaire. After completing the protocol, the\nsubjects were debriefed and thanked.\nA key difference in the intervention protocol is that there was an intervention\nbetween the T1 and T2 measures of affect (Figure 1). At T1, subjects were also given the\nBDI, after which they were given the intervention. We were concerned that after the\nsubjects had completed the attentionally demanding intervention, their attention would\nimmediately relax and we would be unable to detect the emotional effect we were looking\nfor when they took the T2 measure. So we devised an intervention that was intended to\npromote a prolonged focusing effect. Specifically, participants read that they were about to\ntake a test, which involved questions that got progressively more difficult. They also read\nthat they would first be given some practice questions to familiarize them with the rules of\nthe test and give them some idea of the difficulty they would encounter in the test. Subjects\nwere then given five practice questions taken from the remaining 24 questions from the\nRAPM that were not used in the short form. One easy question was given to familiarize\nparticipants with the rules of the test, and the other four had high working memory loads to\nhelp them understand the difficult nature of the test they would be taking. After they had\nanswered each practice question, participants were given the correct answer and told to\nanalyze the question until they had satisfied themselves that they knew why it was the\ncorrect answer. This feature was deemed necessary because, without knowing the correct\nanswer, subjects might not have understood that the questions were difficult. The use of\nanalytically challenging questions for the intervention should have helped subjects focus\ntheir attention, and the fact that they were practice questions should have helped subjects\nremain in the focused state so that they were psychologically and emotionally prepared for\ntaking the test. Thus, the intervention was designed to prolong the focusing effect so we\ncould measure affect after subjects had completed the intervention. After the intervention,\nparticipants completed the T2 assessment of affect. Then, subjects completed the short-\nform of the RAPM, which was administered under a 15-minute time limit. Finally, subjects\nfilled out a short background questionnaire, and then were debriefed and thanked.\nFigure 1.

We ran a series of models in which we compared the fully saturated\nmodel to one in which a particular synonym pair was constrained to have equal loadings\nacross forms and times. Doing this for each of the six pairs, we found that one pair\n(miserable-awful) had a significantly worse fit across the two times, -2LL=18.973, df=3,\np<0.0005, so we deleted it from our constructs.

Both variables\nexhibited good spread, had roughly bell-shaped distributions and passed Shapiro-Wilk tests\nof normality. We therefore had no evidence that our population was emotionally unusual.\nTo test the validity of our instruments, we explored the relationship between the T1\nmeasures of depressed affect of both forms, which are state measures of pre-existing\ndepression, with the BDI, which is a more trait-like measure of pre-existing depression.\nAcross both the control and intervention groups, the baseline (T1) score on form A was\nstate measures of depressed affect, both forms were moderately good predictors of the BDI,\nwhich supports their validity as measures of depressed affect.\nThe effects of age, sex, and order\nAge was not significantly correlated with the T1 depression score, the T2\ndepression score, or the RAPM score in either the control group or the intervention group.\nThese variables also were not affected by the sex of subjects or the order in which they\ntook the two forms.\nThe baseline measure of depressed affect at T1 in the control and intervention groups\nThe control group's mean level of pre-existing depression at T1 was 0.29, SD=1.03\ndf=113, p=0.06.

Put simply, save for the outlier in the control group, the groups were similar in\ntheir baseline level of depression. All subsequent results that we report include the outlier,\nbut they do not change substantively if the outlier is excluded.\nThe functional design of depression's influence on attention\nThe change in depressed affect from T1 to T2\nWe predicted that the analytically challenging intervention would elicit depressed\naffect in subjects with low levels of pre-existing depression. We divided the control and\nintervention groups into three approximately equally sized subgroups, based on their T1\ndepression. Consistent with our prediction, intervention subjects in the low pre-existing\ndepression group tended to increase in depression at T2, mean change=+0.12, SD=0.22,\np=0.02, whereas control subjects with low pre-existing depression tended to decrease at T2,\nFigure 2.

We then calculated the depressive response as the difference\nbetween the T2 and T1 depression scores.

It is negatively related to RAPM score,\nDiscussion\nWe hypothesized that depression evolved, at least in part, as a response to\nimportant, analytically challenging problems in people's lives that focuses attention on the\nproblem and reduces distractibility. We suggested two control-process mechanisms by\nwhich depressed affect could focus attention and reduce distractibility. According to one\nmetaphor, depressed affect exerts a force on attention much like that produced by a spring\nwhen it is pulled. The spring metaphor predicts that as attention is pulled from the focal\nproblem, depressed affect increases and has the effect of drawing attention back to the\nproblem. The magnet metaphor, on the other hand, supposes that depressed affect exerts a\nforce on attention much like that produced by a magnet on a steel ball. As attention is\npulled from the focal problem, depressed affect decreases, just as the attractive force on the\nball decreases as it is pulled away from the magnet. The results of our experiment support\nthe magnet metaphor, and we organize our discussion around it.\nBoth metaphors predict that an analytically challenging problem will induce\ndepressed affect in subjects with low levels of pre-existing depression. To test this, we\ndevised an analytically challenging intervention--the practice questions from the RAPM\nthat were designed to help subjects prepare themselves for the short form of the RAPM.\nThe prediction was supported (see Figure 2). Subjects with low levels of pre-existing\ndepression showed an increase in depressed affect in the intervention group, but not in the\ncontrol group.\nBoth the spring and magnet metaphors assume that people with high levels of pre-\nexisting depression have important, analytically challenging problems in their lives. For\nthese subjects, the intervention was designed to pull their attention away from their pre-\nexisting problems, and the two mechanisms made different predictions about how they\nwould respond emotionally. According to the spring metaphor, people with high levels of\npre-existing depression should have experienced an increase in their depressed affect just as\nThe functional design of depression's influence on attention\nthe force exerted by a spring increases as it is pulled. The magnet metaphor, in contrast,\npredicts that depressed affect will decrease just as the magnetic force on a steel ball\ndecreases as it is pulled away from the magnet. The results supported the magnet metaphor\n(see Figure 2).\nThe overall depressive response pattern in the intervention group looks like\nregression to the mean (see Figure 3), with subjects with low levels of pre-existing\ndepression increasing in depressed affect and those with high levels of pre-existing\ndepression decreasing. However, if it were regression to the mean, the same pattern would\nhave been found in the control group. We conducted a formal test, and the interaction term\nwas significant, indicating that the response patterns were different in the two groups. In\ncontrast to the intervention group, the depressive response in the control group was\npositively related to the T1 measure (see Figure 3). Regression to the mean is not an\nadequate explanation for the results.\nThe response pattern of the control group also supports the magnet metaphor.\nControl subjects who came into the testing with substantial levels of depressed affect\nexperienced an intensification of their depression over the course of the experiment.\nLacking any intervention that would pull their attention away from their ruminations, the\nmagnet metaphor suggests that their attention would become increasingly focused on their\npre-existing life issues and intensifying their depression, just as the force on a steel ball\nincreases as it comes closer to the magnet. This interpretation is supported by other\nresearch. When people with pre-existing depression are experimentally induced to ruminate\nabout their depression and its causes, their level of depressed affect tends to increase (Park,\nGoodyer, and Teasdale, 2004; Vickers and Vogeltanz-Holm, 2003). According to the\nmagnet metaphor, depressed affect should increase as attention focuses more tightly on the\nproblem that elicited the episode, just as the magnetic force on the steel ball increases as it\ngets closer to the magnet.\nOther research supports the magnet metaphor as well. For instance, people with pre-\nexisting depression experience an alleviation of depressed affect when they are given tasks\nthat are designed to distract them from their ruminations (Nolen-Hoeksema and Morrow,\n1993). A distracting task pulls attention away from the core problem that elicited the\nepisode, and it is akin to pulling the steel ball away from the magnet. In short, depressed\naffect decreases as attention is pulled away from the problems that depressed people\nruminate about just as the force on the ball decreases as it is pulled from the magnet.\nA crucial point about the magnet metaphor is that the force exerted on a steel ball\ndecreases as it is pulled away from the magnet, but it is not eliminated. There is always\nsome residual magnetic force that will draw the ball back to the magnet unless some\ncountervailing force, such as friction, prevents it from doing so. If the magnet metaphor\nholds, then depressed affect will decrease when attention is pulled away from the core\nproblem that elicited the depressive episode. But there should be some residual level of\ndepressed affect that eventually draws attention back to the core problem. Depressed affect\ncan only be completely eliminated by solving the problem that elicited the episode, or by\ndisengaging from the goal represented by the problem. We did not explicitly test this in the\npresent experiment, but other evidence in the literature supports this prediction. People with\npre-existing depression who systematically try to cope with their depression by trying to\nThe functional design of depression's influence on attention\ndistract themselves from their ruminative thoughts either do not have shorter episodes\n(Kuehner and Weber, 1999; Nolen-Hoeksema, Morrow, and Fredrickson, 1993) or they\nhave longer episodes (Schmaling et al., 2002). Similarly, a recent longitudinal study\nsuggests that people who attempt to suppress the ruminative thoughts that they have in\nresponse to stress have longer or more severe depressive episodes, and their attempts to\nreduce their ruminations are unsuccessful (Wenzlaff and Luxton, 2003). Thus, attempts to\npull attention away from depressive ruminations may temporarily alleviate depressive\nsymptoms, but they do not make the symptoms go away. If anything, such attempts appear\nto lengthen depressive episodes, not shorten them.\nA magnet-like control process mechanism may be better designed than a spring-like\nmechanism for dealing with the inherent tradeoffs that organisms face when managing\nmultiple adaptive problems. Analytically challenging problems, by their very nature,\nrequire sustained processing, so the ability to resist distractions is very functional. At the\nsame time, the organism must be able to temporarily divert attention from the core\nanalytical problems that caused the depressive episode to attend to pressing matters that\nrequire immediate attention (e.g., predators, important social problems). The magnet\nmetaphor suggests that it may take some initial effort to pull attention away from the core\nproblem, but after it has been pulled away, it takes less effort to keep it away. The spring\nmetaphor, in contrast, suggests that increasingly greater effort is required to resist the\nspring's force as attention is pulled further away from the core problem, which would make\nit difficult to attend to anything other than the core problem, no matter how pressing other\nproblems are.\nThe magnet metaphor may seem paradoxical in the sense that depressed affect\nincreases as attention is focused more on the problem, and people should do things that\navoid causing them pain. However, analogous findings exist in the literature on physical\npain. Pain draws attention to an injury, or the threat of injury, and when attention is drawn\naway from an injury by a more pressing problem, pain alleviates (Eccleston and Crombez,\n1999; Wall, 2000). Thus, one may want to avoid pain by avoiding a wound. Or, given a\nwound, one may wish the pain to go away and take pain killers for that reason. But the\nreason for the pain is to focus attention on caring for the wound, which will happen in the\nabsence of distractions or pain killers. By analogy, it is the pain of depression that makes\none attend to the underlying problem that caused the episode. And the more pain that one\nfeels, the more one attends to the problem. In terms of the magnet metaphor, even if\nattention is focused on other things, residual depression will tend to keep drawing attention\nto the problem. As attention begins to focus on the problem, the depression increases and\nattention focuses even more.\nThe magnet metaphor leads to an important conclusion--depressed affect is a\nmarker of the degree to which attention is focused on a difficult problem. When depressed\naffect is high, attention is highly focused, just as the magnetic force on a steel ball is\ngreatest when it is closest to the magnet; when depressed affect is low, attention is\nunfocused, distracted, or divided between multiple problems.\nThe idea that depression is a marker of the degree to which attention is focused may\nhelp interpret the RAPM findings. The nature of this part of the discussion is necessarily\nmore speculative, but it could form the basis for future experiments. The RAPM is an\nThe functional design of depression's influence on attention\nanalytically and attentionally demanding task (Carpenter et al., 1990), and performance on\nthe RAPM is positively associated with the ability to maintain a focused attentional state in\nthe presence of distracting stimuli (Gray et al., 2003). High performers on the RAPM\ntended to have high T2 depression scores, after controlling for differences in their pre-\nexisting depression at T1. For high performers, the intervention may have made the RAPM\na salient problem that generated depressed affect and drew attention to it like a magnet.\nThis suggests that people with higher levels of pre-existing depression should have\nhad more difficulty performing well on the RAPM. The personal life problems that caused\ntheir depression served as a magnet that drew on their attention. They had to pull their\nattention away from their pre-existing life problems long enough for the RAPM to become\nanother magnet that could gain traction on their attention. But the higher their pre-existing\ndepression, the stronger the magnetic force exerted by their personal life problems, and the\nmore difficult it should be to pull attention away from them. This may explain why the T1\nmeasure of depressed affect was a significant negative predictor of RAPM score, after\ncontrolling for differences in the T2 measure.\nAs a single experiment, this is a preliminary test of our hypothesis that depressed\naffect evolved as a response to analytically challenging problems, and it needs to be\nreplicated.\nThe fact that subjects with low pre-existing depression in the intervention group\nexperienced a post-intervention increase in depression, but those in the control group did\nnot, suggests that the increase was attributable to something about the intervention. We\nused an evolutionarily novel intervention, which might be viewed as a limitation of the\nexperiment. However, people in modern, industrialized societies perform evolutionarily\nnovel tasks frequently, and they must do so with evolved mechanisms. The use of\nevolutionarily novel tasks to help determine the functional design of evolved mechanisms\ncan be very useful. In this case, we chose an analytically demanding task that was devoid of\nother evolutionarily important content. For instance, complex social problems often have\nan analytical component to them, but they might also have other content to them. The\nRAPM is a well-established test of analytical reasoning that lacks social content.\nAt the same time, the intervention's design is still not specific enough to isolate the\nprecise properties of the intervention that made it depressogenic. For instance, subjects not\nonly tried to answer the practice questions, they also read instructions about the practice\nquestions. We have no empirical or theoretical reason to believe that the instructions were\ncapable of eliciting depressed affect on their own. Still, we acknowledge this limitation in\nthe design.\nAnother possibility is that the intervention elicited depressed affect because it\ncaused subjects to be fatigued or frustrated by the practice questions, which were difficult\nand challenging. However, if the task was depressogenic because it was fatiguing or\nfrustrating, then we would have expected subjects who got more depressed in response to\nthe practice questions to perform worse on the subsequent RAPM. But subjects who got\nmore depressed in response to the practice questions actually performed better on the test.\nThe enhancement of performance suggests that depressed affect was not a response to\nfatigue or frustration.\nFinally, we consider the possibility that depressed affect was elicited by the\nThe functional design of depression's influence on attention\nintervention because subjects failed to correctly answer the practice questions. This would\nmake the intervention similar to negative feedback methods for eliciting depressed affect.\nBut, again, subjects who showed a higher depressive response to the intervention scored\nbetter on the RAPM short form that they took after the intervention, not worse. If failure\nwas a complete explanation for the elicitation of depressed affect, then who got the practice\nquestions correct would have come out of the intervention with lower levels of depressed\naffect, which would have made them do worse on the RAPM. But it seems unlikely that\npeople who got the intervention practice questions correct would systematically do worse\non the actual test. A more plausible explanation is that the intervention elicited depressed\naffect because the questions were analytically difficult and attentionally demanding.\nEven if failure did play a role in eliciting depressed affect, one can always ask why\nfailure elicits depressed affect. The usual explanation is that failure elicits depressed affect\nbecause it creates the perception of helplessness. But if some subjects did get more\ndepressed because they failed the practice questions, their better subsequent performance\non the RAPM short form means that they did not give up (i.e., they did not become\nhelpless). Indeed, failure might elicit depressed affect because it indicates that there is a\nproblem that requires more focused attention, which is consistent with our hypothesis.\nIn short, we don't think it likely that fatigue, frustration, failure, or the practice\nquestion instructions were responsible for the elicitation of depressed affect. The results are\nconsistent with our hypothesis that it was the analytically and attentionally demanding\nnature of the practice questions that elicited depressed affect. We therefore view the results\nas preliminary support for our hypothesis. Still, our ability to draw inferences about the\nprecise aspects of the intervention that elicited depressed affect, and why they did so, are\nsomewhat limited. This should be explored in future work.\nAnother limitation in our design is that the time between the two depression\nassessments was unequal for the control and intervention groups. While we did not measure\nthe intervening time, it is clear to us the time was shorter for the control group than the\nintervention group. This may partly explain why the depressive response was highly\ncorrelated with the measure of pre-existing depression at T1 in the control group. There are\ntwo potential problems with this. First, the time between the two measurements could have\nbeen so short that subjects remembered what they reported at T1 when filling out their T2\nassessment. We guarded against this problem by using two different, but roughly\nequivalent, instruments. It shouldn't matter if subjects remembered how they filled out the\nfirst instrument at T1 because the instrument at T2 used different adjectives. Subjects\nwould still have to read and think about how each adjective applied to them at the time they\nwere filling it out.\nSecond, the control group might have shown a different emotional response pattern\nif they had as much time between the T1 and T2 measurements as the intervention group.\nThe control group's emotional response was positively correlated with their baseline (T1)\nscore (Figure 3). In contrast, the intervention group's emotional response was negatively\ncorrelated with their baseline (T1) score (Figure 3). To say that the control group was\ninadequate for this reason is to argue that somehow their emotional response would have\nbeen more like that of the intervention group if they had been given more time between the\nT1 and T2 measurements. This would require time to have a non-linear effect on the\nThe functional design of depression's influence on attention\nemotional response of the control group: first showing a positive correlation with the\nbaseline shortly after the baseline was taken, and then changing to a negative correlation\nwith the baseline later on. In principle, this is possible, but we see no reason to believe that\nadditional time would have had such an unusual effect. Still, we recognize it as a limitation\nin our design.\nConclusion\nWe elicited depressed affect in subjects with low levels of pre-existing depression\nby giving them an analytically and attentionally challenging intervention. Moreover, the\noverall pattern of subjects' response to the intervention supports the idea that depressed\naffect exerts a force on attention much like a magnet does on a steel ball, which, in turn,\nsuggests that depressed affect is a marker of the degree to which attention is focused.\nFinally, subjects' depressive response to the intervention positively predicted their\nsubsequent performance on the RAPM, which provides further support for the idea that\ndepressed affect promotes an analytical processing style.\n"
