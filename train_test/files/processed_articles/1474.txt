A subsample of\nrespondents, selected at random with a specified sampling fraction,\nprovides a fasting blood sample as part of their MEC examination.26\nThis subsample has its own designated weight, which accounts for\nthe additional probability of selection into the subsample component,\nas well as the additional nonresponse. In 1999, NHANES transi-\ntioned from being a periodic cross-sectional survey to adopting a\ncontinuous data collection strategy, with data released every 2 years.\nFor the purposes of this study, we combined data from 3 NHANES\nStudy Sample\nConsistent with the sociodemographic characteristics of the JUPI-\nTER patient population, we restricted the analysis to men aged 50\nyears and women aged 60 years who were included in the fasting\nWe excluded 175 individuals who had missing data on statin\neligibility (as described below), fasting LDL, hs-CRP, or lipid-\nlowering medication use, extracted from the NHANES medication\nfile. Thus, the final sample size for this study was 2322.\nWe stratified the sample into 3 groups based on statin eligibility.\nFirst, we identified individuals who were currently taking a statin or\nindicated for statin therapy based on NCEP/ATPIII guidelines.8\nThen, among the remainder of the sample, we used hs-CRP and LDL\nvalues to identify individuals who would now be indicated for statin\ntherapy based on JUPITER's findings. Finally, the third group was\ncomprised of those without any NCEP/ATPIII or JUPITER indica-\ntion for statin therapy. These groups are defined, in turn, below.\nNCEP/ATPIII-Indicated Group\nIndividuals currently taking a statin were included in the NCEP/\nATPIII group regardless of their risk level or LDL value, as they\nwere assumed to have an established indication for statin therapy.\nAmong those not on a statin, NCEP/ATPIII indications for treatment\nwere determined by first stratifying individuals into 1 of 4 cardio-\nvascular risk categories (high, moderately high, intermediate, or low\nrisk) and then comparing one's measured LDL level to their\nrisk-group-specific LDL goal. We did not consider treatment with\nnonstatin, lipid-lowering medications in our eligibility stratification\nas such individuals may still be candidates for additional statin\ntherapy.27 Subjects were deemed to be at the highest risk level if they\nhad CHD or a CHD risk equivalent, which included diabetes,\nperipheral artery disease, symptomatic carotid artery disease, or\nabdominal aortic aneurysm. CHD was assessed through self-report\nof coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, or angina pecto-\nris.28 Diabetes was assessed by self-report of diabetes. Individuals\nwithout a diagnosis of diabetes but with a fasting blood glucose\n126 mg/dL were also coded as having diabetes.29 Peripheral artery\ndisease was defined as an ankle-brachial index 0.9 mm Hg; and\nself-report of stroke was used as a proxy for symptomatic carotid\nartery disease. Given the available data in NHANES, we were unable\nto determine the presence or absence of abdominal aortic aneurysm.\nPer NCEP/ATPIII guidelines, individuals without CHD or a CHD\nrisk equivalent were assessed for the presence of major risk factors\nof CHD (other than LDL), including age, smoking status, hyperten-\nsion, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level, and family history of\npremature CHD. Hypertension was defined as having a mean\nsystolic blood pressure (SBP) 140 mm Hg or a mean diastolic\nblood pressure (DBP) 90 mm Hg, or reporting taking an antihy-\npertensive medication. HDL cholesterol was considered low if 40\nmg/dL and deemed a negative risk factor if 60 mg/dL. Family\nhistory of premature CHD was defined by reporting having a\nfirst-degree relative who had had a heart attack or angina before the\nFor persons with 2 or more risk factors, we calculated their\nFramingham risk score (FRS).30 Individuals with an FRS greater\nthan 20% were included in the high risk group, those between 10%\nand 20% in the moderately high risk group, and those less than 10%\nin the intermediate risk group. Individuals with 0 or 1 major risk\nfactor were considered to be low risk. FRS was not calculated for\nindividuals aged 79 years, as the FRS is not validated in this group.\nTo determine LDL goals for each risk category, we used the lower\nLDL option for initiating lipid-lowering therapy recommended by\nNCEP/ATPIII.8 We decided to use the lower treatment threshold as\ncurrent clinical practice is moving toward the achievement of lower\nLDL values with medication therapy, more specifically with statin\nmedications.9 As such, eligibility for lipid-lowering therapy was\ndefined as follows: LDL100 mg/dL for the high risk group,\nhttp://circoutcomes.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nmg/dL for the intermediate and low risk groups. For those aged 79\nyears without known CHD or a CHD risk equivalent (and no FRS),\nwe set the LDL goal at 160 mg/dL.\nJUPITER-Indicated Group\nIndividuals with no current NCEP/ATPIII indication for lipid-\nlowering therapy were potentially eligible for inclusion in the\nJUPITER group. For these subjects, hs-CRP and LDL values were\nassessed. Those with hs-CRP2 mg/L and LDL130 mg/dL com-\nprised our \"strict\" JUPITER group. We additionally included indi-\nmg/dL, the \"extended\" JUPITER group, as any recommendation for\nhs-CRP screening based on JUPITER findings would likely be\nextended to this cohort, assuming they had no other indication for\nstatin therapy. Importantly, individuals with hs-CRP values 10\nmg/L were excluded from the JUPITER group and included in the\n\"Not Indicated\" group (below), as levels this high are thought to\nreflect systemic inflammatory processes other than cardiovascular\ndisease. Patients with inflammatory diseases such as systemic lupus\nerythematosus were excluded from the JUPITER trial and, at present,\nit is unclear whether such subjects would benefit from statin\nNot Indicated Group\nIndividuals without an NCEP/ATPIII or JUPITER indication for\nstatin therapy were included in the Not Indicated group. These\nindividuals had hs-CRP levels 2 mg/L (or 10 mg/L) and a\nSample Characteristics\nThe JUPITER group was compared to the other 2 statin-eligible\ngroups, the NCEP/ATPIII and Not Indicated groups, based on\nseveral sociodemographic and cardiovascular risk factors. Sociode-\nmographic characteristics included gender, age, race/ethnicity, and\npoverty income ratio, defined as the ratio of total family income to\nthe family's household size-adjusted poverty threshold.25 If a fami-\nly's total income is less than their threshold income value (deter-\nmined annually by the US Census Bureau), then the family, and\nevery individual in it, is considered poor. Poverty income ratio\nvalues 1.00 are below the official poverty threshold, whereas\npoverty income ratio values 1.00 indicate income at or above the\nfederal poverty level.\nCardiovascular risk factors included smoking status, body mass\nindex, abdominal obesity, presence of impaired glucose tolerance or\ndiabetes, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome. Abdominal obesity\nwas defined as a waist circumference 88 cm for women and 102\ncm for men. Individuals without a diagnosis of diabetes (as described\nearlier) were considered to have impaired glucose tolerance if the\ndid not report use of insulin or a hypoglycemic medication. Hyper-\ntension status was categorized into 3 levels: hypertension (SBP\n140 mm Hg, DBP 90 mm Hg, or self-reported use of antihyper-\ntensive medication), prehypertension (SBP 120 to 139 mm Hg or\nand DBP 80 mm Hg).31,32 Metabolic syndrome was defined as the\npresence of three or more of the following risk factors: abdominal\nobesity, triglycerides 150 mg/dL, HDL 40 mg/dL for men and\nreported antihypertensive medication use, and impaired glucose\ntolerance or self-reported diabetes medication use.32\nAdditionally assessed were global measures of cardiovascular\nrisk, including the Framingham and Reynolds risk scores.17,30 The\nReynolds risk score was calculated in all individuals using the\nfollowing variables: hemoglobin A1c, parental history of premature\nCHD, current smoking, SBP, HDL, total cholesterol, and hs-CRP.\nUse of hormone replacement therapy, defined as current use of\noral or transdermal estrogen in combination with progesterone or\nalone, is also reported, as estrogen has been shown to elevate hs-CRP\nlevels. Finally, we assessed median values for hs-CRP, mean values\nfor LDL and HDL, and the presence of elevated serum creatinine\n(2 mg/dL), aspartate aminotransferase (150 mg/dL), and alanine\naminotransferase (180 mg/dL) in each of the 3 groups.\nData Analysis\nAll analyses were performed using SAS-callable SUDAAN to take\ninto account the survey's complex sample design33; this allowed for\nappropriate variance estimation and weighting of the data. We began\nby determining the proportion of the middle-aged to elderly popu-\nlation (men aged 50 years and women aged 60 years) in each of\nthe 3 statin-eligible groups, specifically focusing on assessing the\nsize of the population that is currently eligible for statin therapy\naccording to NCEP/ATPIII guidelines and those that would be\nexpected to be newly eligible based on JUPITER's findings.\nWeighted prevalence estimates were multiplied by the 2000 US\nCensus figure to estimate the number of individuals in each group.\nPrevalence estimates and their associated 95% CI are rounded to the\nnearest thousand. We then compared the sociodemographic and\nclinical characteristics of the JUPITER group with each of the other\n2 statin-eligible groups using 2 tests for categorical variables and\nt-tests for continuous variables. Weighted percentages and means\nwith SEs are reported for each group, along with corresponding\nprobability values comparing JUPITER with the NCEP/ATPIII\ngroup, and JUPITER with the Not Indicated group. Statistical\nsignificance was set at the 0.05 level. For hs-CRP, median values\nwere calculated and group distributions compared using the Mann-\nWhitney test in SAS version 9.1.3.

The 2 groups were also comparable in terms of their\nprevalence of current smoking, abdominal obesity, and hy-\npertension. Although the prevalence of diabetes and FRS\nscores were significantly greater in the NCEP/ATPIII group\nthan in the JUPITER group, reflecting the centrality of the\nFRS in determining need for statin therapy according to the\ncurrent guidelines, the 2 groups were similar in their distri-\nbution of Reynolds risk scores. The JUPITER group had an\nincreased prevalence of class I and II obesity, and the\nNCEP/ATPIII group had more metabolic syndrome; both of\nthese differences were statistically significant. The median\nhs-CRP values in the NCEP/ATPIII and JUPITER groups\nwere elevated (2 mg/L), though the JUPITER group had\nsignificantly higher values. LDL was significantly higher and\nHDL was significantly lower in the NCEP/ATPIII group.\nComparison of JUPITER and Not\nIndicated Groups\nIn comparing the JUPITER group with the Not Indicated\ngroup, JUPITER subjects were significantly more likely to be\nfemale and older. Distributions of race/ethnicity, poverty\nstatus, and smoking status were similar between the 2 groups.\nAlthough the 2 groups were also similar with respect to FRS\nscores, individuals in the JUPITER group had significantly\ngreater Reynolds risk scores and were more likely to be obese\nand to have hypertension and the metabolic syndrome, as\ncompared with those in the Not Indicated group. The median\nhs-CRP value was significantly higher in the JUPITER group\nthan in the Not Indicated group, consistent with the stratifi-\ncation schema for the 2 groups, though HDL and LDL levels\nwere similar in the 2 groups.\nFinally, hormone replacement therapy use was signifi-\ncantly higher in the JUPITER group as compared with the\nNCEP/ATPIII and Not Indicated groups.

This group is in addition to the\n33.5 million older adults with an already established NCEP/\nATPIII indication for statin therapy, over half of whom are\nundertreated. Given our failure to reach current benchmarks,\nand the possibility that the recommendations for statin ther-\napy may expand to include approximately 80% of the\nmiddle-aged to elderly population, it is important to under-\nstand the characteristics of these groups to target future\nrisk-reduction strategies more effectively.\nAn aim of our study was to explore potential distinguishing\nfeatures of the JUPITER-indicated group. Compared with\nindividuals with at-goal LDL cholesterol and low hs-CRP\n(the Not Indicated group), JUPITER subjects were more\nlikely to be female and older. In addition, obesity (as measured\nby both body mass index and abdominal circumference),\nhypertension, and the metabolic syndrome were signifi-\ncantly more prevalent in the JUPITER group. Interestingly,\nJUPITER subjects shared many characteristics with NCEP/\nATPIII subjects, including sociodemographic factors and\nprevalence of smoking, abdominal obesity, and\nhypertension.\nJUPITER\nNot Indicated\nOn Statin\nUnder-treated\nHigh Risk\nModerately High Risk\nIntermediate Risk\nLow Risk\n\"Strict\" JUPITER\n\"Extended\" JUPITER\nNotes: Values in cells are unweighted Ns, weighted prevalence estimates and standard errors, and population estimates\nweighted to the 2000 U.S. Census.

The FRS was significantly higher in the\nNCEP/ATPIII group than in the other 2 groups. This was as\nexpected, because current NCEP/ATPIII guidelines identify\ntraditional risk factors from which the FRS is derived and\nfurther use the FRS to determine statin eligibility. However,\nin the remainder of the population, the FRS did not help\ndistinguish between the JUPITER and the Not Indicated\ngroups, which, despite having different cardiovascular risk\nprofiles, had similar FRS scores. The Reynolds risk score,\nwhich incorporates hs-CRP values, was similar for the\nNCEP/ATPIII and JUPITER groups but higher in the JUPI-\nTER group compared to the Not Indicated group. By defini-\ntion, the JUPITER group had higher hs-CRP levels than the\nother 2 groups. However, the Reynolds risk score is derived\nfrom additional risk factors, beyond hs-CRP, that would have\nbeen absent (eg, diabetes) or presumably more favorable in\nthe JUPITER group as compared to the NCEP/ATPIII group.\nFor this reason, the similarity in the scores between these 2\ngroups was not expected. There is some evidence to suggest\nthat the Reynolds risk score reflects not only elevated hs-CRP\nlevels, but also the increased cardiovascular risk not ac-\ncounted for with traditional risk measures such as the FRS. In\nthe Women's Health Study, approximately 20% of subjects\nreclassified using the Reynolds risk score into other risk\nlevels to predict more accurately actual event rates.34 Such\nfindings challenge our current understanding of individuals\ndeemed to be at low or intermediate risk, and may favor the\nuse of hs-CRP and the Reynolds risk score to better guide\ncardiovascular risk prediction and reduction strategies.16,35\nCurrent NCEP/ATPIII recommendations focus exclusively\non lowering LDL cholesterol and do not stipulate the class of\nTable 1.

As statins have demonstrated unparalleled efficacy in\nreducing primary and secondary cardiovascular events,27 it\nseems prudent to limit the discussion on risk reduction to\nstatin therapy. Statins have pleiotropic effects beyond LDL\nlowering. As a class, statins promote antiinflammatory and\nantioxidant effects via reducing metalloproteinase activity,\nincreasing nitric oxide availability, and decreasing thrombus\nproliferation.36 Statins have been shown to decrease hs-CRP\napproved statins, rosuvastatin and atorvastatin at high doses\nappear to have the greatest hs-CRP-lowering effects.13 Still,\nhowever, LDL has remained the main target of statin therapy.\nJUPITER is the first prospective study to demonstrate that\nstatin therapy lowers cardiovascular risk in patients with\nat-goal LDL cholesterol but elevated hs-CRP levels.\nOur study has the following limitations. There was likely\nsome degree of misclassification in our risk-group stratifica-\ntion, given the reliance on one-time laboratory measurements,\nself-reported data, and incomplete or imprecise risk factor\nassessments. For example, in defining our high risk group,\nassessments of symptomatic carotid artery disease and ab-\ndominal aortic aneurysm were suboptimal. We used history\nof stroke as a proxy for symptomatic carotid artery disease,\nacknowledging that strokes may result from other noncarotid\netiologies; in addition, this variable would not capture those\nwith carotid artery disease that did not result in stroke. We\nwere not able to attain information regarding abdominal\naortic aneurysms, as this was not asked or assessed in\nNHANES. Family history of premature CHD may have been\nunderestimated, as NHANES asks about disease in relatives\nunder the age of 50, whereas NCEP/ATPIII guidelines specify\nmale relatives under age 55 and female relatives under age 65 as\ntheir cutoffs in defining premature CHD. In estimating the\nFramingham risk levels for the 3 groups, we may have under-\nestimated the high risk group, as individuals over 79 were not\nscored. For each of these variables, however, we attempted to\nreplicate standard evaluation techniques and commonly used\nused to assign NCEP/ATPIII risk were intended to result in the\nmost conservative estimates for the JUPITER population. It is\nimportant to note that we included women on hormone replace-\nment therapy in the analysis of this study, acknowledging that\nestrogen is known to elevate hs-CRP levels. We repeated our\nanalysis excluding women on hormone replacement therapy and\nfound substantively similar results.\nIn conclusion, targeting elevated hs-CRP levels for risk-\nreduction therapy has the potential to impact approximately\n20% of the adult population of men aged 50 years and\nwomen aged 60 years who would otherwise not be recom-\nmended for statin therapy. This translates into an estimated\nmg/L and LDL 130 mg/dL (\"strict\" JUPITER criteria) and\nmight reasonably be extended. Thus, based on existing\nguidelines and JUPITER's findings, approximately 80% of\nthe middle-aged to elderly population in the United States\nmay now have an indication for statin therapy. Our study\nsuggests that JUPITER patients are largely similar to patients\nwho already meet NCEP/ATPIII criteria for statin therapy.\nJUPITER's findings question our current strategies for car-\ndiovascular risk reduction and use of statin medications\nexclusively in individuals with cardiovascular risk and LDL\ncholesterol above what is recommended. Expanding recom-\nmendations for statin therapy to include individuals with\nat-goal LDL cholesterol but elevated hs-CRP values will pose\nincreasing challenges for health care providers and systems\nalready struggling to reach individuals with an NCEP/ATPIII\nindication for statin therapy, but offers a potential opportunity\nfor advancing risk-reduction strategies.\nSources of Funding\nDr Spatz is supported by the Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholars\nProgram.\nDisclosures\nNone.\nReferences\n1.

Family history of diabetes or cardio-\nvascular disease and C-reactive protein concentration: findings from the\nCurrent strategies for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, based on guidelines from the National Cholesterol\nEducation Panel/Adult Treatment Panel III, focus on lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in individuals\nwith increased cardiovascular risk and above-goal LDL values. A new clinical trial, Justification for the Use of Statins in\nPrimary Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER), showed improved cardiovascular outcomes\nin patients without coronary heart disease who had at-goal LDL values but elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein\nvalues and were treated with a statin medication. We estimate that these findings have the potential to impact 20% of\nthe adult population of men aged 50 years and women aged 60 years who would otherwise not be recommended for\n2 mg/L and LDL between 130 and 160 mg/dL for whom the JUPITER findings might reasonably be extended. Thus,\nbased on existing guidelines and JUPITER's findings, 80% of the middle-aged to elderly population in the United States\nmay now have an indication for statin therapy. Expanding recommendations for statin therapy to include individuals with\nat-goal LDL cholesterol but elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein values will pose increasing challenges for health\ncare providers and systems already struggling to reach individuals with a National Cholesterol Education Program/Adult\nTreatment Panel III indication for statin therapy but offers a potential opportunity for advancing risk-reduction strategies.\nhttp://circoutcomes.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nErica S.
