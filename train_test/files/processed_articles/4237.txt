Some of the emergent\nthemes included planning and location, inclusion and public investment as well as those relating to notions of identity,\nheritage, otherness, and Islamification. Overt racist and Islamophobic reasons were also identified. The sense of political\ndisconnect of members is also considered. Concluding with a contextualization of the findings within the existing body of\nscholarly output, in particular the building of mosques and Islamophobia, having recognized how spaces such as Facebook\nhave potential to function as sites for research and method also, an extended methodological consideration is also included.\n",
    "reduced_content": "sgo.sagepub.com\nArticle\nA report published that explored Islamophobia in the West\nMidlands region of England highlighted two particularly\ninteresting findings (Allen, 2010b). First was the acknowl-\nedgment of a relatively widespread opposition being shown\ntoward the building and development of mosques. This was\nparticularly evident in the \"Black Country,\" a colloquial\nname given to the former industrialized area to the north of\nthe city of Birmingham comprising the towns of Dudley,\nWalsall, and Wolverhampton. Here, three mosques had been\nfirebombed in 2009 alone, two of which were completely\ndestroyed (Allen, 2010b). Second was how social media and\nnetworking sites, particularly Facebook, were being used to\nvoice and garner support for this opposition. More problem-\natic was the recognition that many of these sites were also\ndisseminating highly explicit and inciting Islamophobic con-\ntent. As the research highlighted, both had been catalyzed by\nthe unfolding situation in Dudley where since the late 1990s,\nsome of the town's Muslim communities had been engaged\nin an ongoing campaign to build what opponents describe as\nresearch paid considerable attention to the prevalence and\nmanifestation of Islamophobia across the West Midlands\nregion, the nature of the presentation--a civil society report\ntargeting policy audiences--meant that although these two\nextremely interesting findings were highlighted, they were\nnot fully investigated. As such, although opposition to\nmosques and the growing prevalence of social media were\nhighlighted as being distinct, little could be drawn from this\nor about the relationship that might exist between the two.\nOpposing Mosques in Public Spaces\nWhen considered more widely, the building of mosques has\nnot been without controversy or contestation elsewhere.\nAcross a number of Western European countries, the propo-\nsition as indeed the actual construction of mosques and\nother similar buildings has been seen to be increasingly\nproblematic; many providing a focus for hostility and oppo-\nsition as also social, political, and academic scrutiny\n(Allievi, 2009). This is true of Britain, in Birmingham (Gale,\nBeyond Britain, studies have shown similar opposition in\nBlancat & di Friedberg, 2005), and the Netherlands\n1University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, UK\nCorresponding Author:\nChris Allen, Lecturer, Institute of Applied Social Studies, University of\nBirmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK.\nEmail: c.allen.2@bham.ac.uk\nAnti-Social Networking: Findings From a\nPilot Study on Opposing Dudley Mosque\nUsing Facebook Groups as Both Site and\nMethod for Research\nChris Allen1\n Keywords\nIslamophobia, Facebook, mosques, Dudley mosque, social media, Islam, English Defence League, Muslims, politics, communities\n2 SAGE Open\n(Maussen, 2004). Such studies have also been undertaken in\nSwitzerland following the 2009 vote to ban the building of\nminarets. From further academic inquiry, Stussi (2008)\nfound that the overwhelming majority of those who voted to\nban minarets did so to make a public display of their wide-\nspread anxieties about Islam and the presence of Muslims\nrather than having a particular dislike for minarets or even\nmosques.\nLikewise, G\u00f6le's (2011) study found that public anxieties\nwere in fact being catalyzed by the visuality of minarets and\nmosques, increasingly seen to be symbolic of all that was\ndeemed problematic about Muslims and Islam. G\u00f6le\nexplained how this meant that mosques were being seen as\npublic manifestations of difference quite irrespective of\nwhether that difference was perceived or actual. For her, this\nwas consequential of the tumultuous transition underway in\ncontemporary Europe, where Muslims were moving from\ntemporary migrants to fully fledged European citizens,\nsomething that was affecting as much at the regional level as\nindeed at the national and local levels. Going beyond the\nsheer physicality of the structure, G\u00f6le set out to find how\nopposition was increasingly being justified on the basis of a\nwhole range of social, political, and cultural precepts. This\nmight have been evident in the United States too in response\nto the furore surrounding the proposed \"Ground Zero\"\nmosque in New York. As Kilde (2011) noted, what began as\nan application for the construction of the \"Park 51\" Islamic\ncommunity center in lower Manhattan in the summer of\n2010 was soon latched onto by a whole host of different indi-\nviduals and organizations that saw this as an opportunity to\nexpress their \"hatred for Islam and their opposition to the\ngrowing Muslim presence in the United States\" (p. 298). For\nopponents, Park 51 was symbolically transformed into the\nfar more emotively and discursively charged \"Ground Zero\nmosque.\" Polarizing thought and opinion--see Kilde (2011)\nfor a full exposition of these public debates and discursive\ntransitions--the site became one through which debates\nabout Islam, America, terrorism, belonging, patriotism, and\nsacredness among others were politically, publicly, and sym-\nbolically played out. As such, opposition to the building of\nmosques is a contemporarily complex matter, one that\nembodies social, political, and cultural relevancies that at\ntimes appear to have very little to do with the physical struc-\nture itself.\nOpposing Mosques in Online Spaces\nCharacteristic to the West Midlands region was the way in\nwhich opposition to the building and development of\nmosques was being disseminated and propagated through\nsocial media. Noting the ease with which new alliances,\ngroups, and networks are able to be established online\n(Shirky, 2009), the West Midlands research highlighted how\nmany of those creating these new online spaces were aligned\nor active within far-right and neo-Nazi organizations (Allen,\n2010b). A good example was the Facebook group, Say no to\nSolihull mosque, which was created and maintained by sup-\nporters of the British National Party (\"BNP\"). With more\nposted on the group's public wall in a fortnight (Allen,\n2010b). Other Facebook groups opposing mosques were\nalso emerging, many of which focused on Dudley. The larg-\nmembers. Some of these were deliberately offensive, in\nparticular the Facebook group, Fuk [sic] the Dudley\nmosque, let's build a big fat pig there instead. Although\nFacebook has since changed its policy--it has closed all of\nthe groups referred to in this article since mid-2012--most\nof the groups referred to maintained walls characterized by\nhighly offensive and explicit Islamophobic content. Maybe\nsomewhat surprising was how much of this content was\naccompanied by the names and photos of individuals. As\nresearch has shown, Islamophobic discourses are rarely so\novert (Allen, 2010a) so this is even more surprising because\nas Back et al. (2010) noted, the majority of Facebook users\nare genuine and have profiles to match. Explicit discourses\ntherefore become easily attributable. Noting Markham and\nBaym's (2009) findings, this could be because of the shift-\ning nature of the private and public online, where private\ncitizens are increasingly willing to share even the most per-\nsonal and private aspects of their lives to indiscriminate\nmass audiences.\nDespite Facebook having closed all of the groups\nreferred to here, some have transferred to other social net-\nworking platforms. Some however have just disappeared.\nThis is not to suggest however that Islamophobia online has\ndisappeared. Monitoring organizations such as Tell MAMA1\n(Measuring Anti-Muslim Attacks) suggest that levels of\nIslamophobic discourse online are ongoing and increasing,\nespecially through Twitter. Despite these more recent\nchanges, the West Midlands research presented two clear\nresearch opportunities: to explore the opposition being\nexpressed toward mosques--in particular Dudley mosque--\ntaking place online via Facebook groups; and to explore\nsocial media as a site as also a method of research.\nRecognizing this, a pilot study was initiated in late 2011\nAt the time, a pilot study was preferred as it was not envis-\naged that Facebook would change its policies and thereby\nclose all of the groups soon after the pilot study finished.\nThis article therefore presents a critical analysis of the find-\nings from this pilot study while also reflecting on the online\nmethods and approaches used and the challenges encoun-\ntered. Beginning with a contextual overview of the pro-\nposed Dudley mosque, the article follows with a section on\nmethods and approaches before setting out the findings\nfrom the pilot study. Thematically analyzed, the article con-\ncludes by contextualizing the findings within the broader\nbodies of scholarly evidence relating to opposing mosques\nand Islamophobia.\nDudley \"Super-Mosque\" in the Public\nand Political Spaces\nIn the late 1990s, the Dudley Muslim Association began\nexploring sites for a new, purpose-built mosque in Dudley.\nHaving purchased land on the outskirts of the town, the site\nwas identified as overlapping with the soon to be built\nDudley bypass. Negotiations between the local authority--\nDudley Metropolitan Borough Council (\"Dudley MBC\")--\nand the Dudley Muslim Association agreed a land-swap on\nthe proviso that significant building work be undertaken on\nMuslim Association submitted plans for a purpose-built\nmosque. Named the \"Pride of Dudley,\" the mosque included\na dome and minaret as well as a separate community center.\nInitial opposition was voiced by a handful of local people\nalthough things escalated quickly once local media and far-\nright political groups got involved. Focusing on the size of\nthe \"super mosque,\" opposition increasingly focused on alle-\ngations that the \"giant minaret\" would overshadow the\ntown's castle and \"Top Church,\" an iconic medieval church\nvisible from beyond the town. Opposition also focused on\nwhat was termed the \"Muslim village\" surrounding the\nmosque and how this was perceived as being against the\nChristian ethos of the area: as Councillor (\"Cllr\") Malcolm\nDavis put it, Dudley's Christian society (Reeves, Abbas, &\nSoon after, Simon Darby--deputy leader of the BNP at\nthe time--stood for local councillor in the town and won\nwith 43% of the vote. Despite losing the following year,\nDudley remained a key battlefield for the far-right BNP. On\nthe back of an increasingly vitriolic anti-mosque campaign,\nElection before being bolstered by its post-7/7, \"Islam out of\nBritain\" campaign. A feature in the national Observer news-\npaper at the time noted how the BNP were \"particularly\ndetermined to sound its knell in Dudley\" (Temko, 2006). The\nmost successful politically, as regard campaigning against\nthe mosque, was Cllr Davis. First elected as a Liberal\nDemocrat in 2000, Davis defected to the politically right\nUnited Kingdom Independence Party (\"UKIP\") in 2005\nwhere he lost his seat a year later. Nonetheless, Davis contin-\nued with a vigorous campaign against the mosque, present-\ning Dudley MBC's Development Control Committee with a\npetition signed by more than 22,000 people. That same year,\nDavis was re-elected.\nShortlyafterinFebruary2007,DudleyMBC'sDevelopment\nControl Committee unanimously rejected refused planning\npermission for the mosque on the basis that the land be used for\njob creation (\"Go-Ahead for Mega-Mosque in Dudley,\" 2008).\nThe Dudley Muslim Association (DMA) appealed against the\ndecision to the national government's Secretary of State who in\nturn called for a Planning Inspectorate inquiry in June 2008.\nOverturning Dudley MBC's decision, planning permission was\ngranted.DudleyMBCrespondedbyarguingthattheInspector's\ndecision granted outline planning permission only and that\nalong with the need to submit detailed plans, the original land-\nswap required substantial building work to have been under-\ntaken by the end of 2008. On this basis, Dudley MBC took its\ncase to the High Court to challenge the decision. Immediately\nrejected, local media reported how Dudley MBC's opposition\nhad cost \u00a316,000 in legal fees (\"Dudley Loses Mosque Battle,\"\nThe fallout from the planning debacle undoubtedly gave\nimpetus to the far-right as a mouthpiece for opposition\n(Allen, 2013a). Most prominent at the time was the newly\nestablished and rapidly growing English Defence League\n(\"EDL\"; Allen, 2011). Claiming to be the only group\nresponding to the frustration felt by \"ordinary people\" about\nthe ongoing mosque saga, the EDL took its opposition to the\nstreets of Dudley. Organizing a march in the town in April\nmarch to date at the time--to protest against the mosque\n(Casuals United, 2010). Two months later, the EDL returned,\nstaging a rooftop protest on the disused building currently\noccupying the proposed mosque site. Complete with banners\nproclaiming \"No to the burka [sic]\" and with a week's supply\nof food and water, protestors intended to broadcast the\nIslamic call to prayer 5 times a day in order that local people\nexperience how it would be once the mosque was built (EDL,\n2010). While the protestors were quickly removed, commu-\nnity relations in the town deteriorated.\nDespite Dudley MBC announcing that it had reached\nagreement with the DMA to develop an alternative site, the\nEDL continued to oppose the mosque. Announcing a sec-\nond march in the town in July 2010, Cllr Banks created\nfurther confusion by categorically stating that \"plans to\nbuild the mosque were no longer going ahead\" (\"Injuries as\nEDL Clash With Police,\" 2010). The second march was\nmarked by violent clashes including the BBC reporting that\nsix people had been seriously injured when a car hit pedes-\ntrians (\"Six Hurt as Car Hits Pedestrians in Dudley,\" 2010),\nan incident an EDL-run website reported as being a deliber-\nate attack on innocent \"White\" bystanders by local Muslims\n(Opinionator, 2010b). A week later, the local Dudley News\nnewspaper confirmed that violent disorder had broken out\nin the town including reports of gunshots (\"Violent Disorder\nBreaks Out in Dudley Last Night,\" 2010). Other sources\nreported how young Muslims--the Muslim Defence\nLeague--had attacked cars outside a bar in the town\nDespite outline plans having once again been submitted to\nDudley MBC, these too were rejected on the basis of \"techni-\ncal issues\" and the need to compulsorily purchase nearby\nland (Mudie, 2010). Although the DMA announced they\nwere prepared to exhaust all options to identify alternative\nlocations, there remains little agreement between them and\nDudley MBC. Despite alleged costs of millions, no site has\nbeen agreed yet, no planning permission granted, nor has one\nbrick been laid. Dudley mosque remains as distant a reality\n4 SAGE Open\ntoday as it did at the turn of the millennium. Yet it remains a\ncontroversial and contested issue. Not only has hostility\ntoward Muslims been on the increase in the town (Allen,\n2010b) but so too have there been firebomb attacks on\nmosques on the periphery of Dudley. And although the far-\nright has been active in the Black Country for some time, the\nproposed mosque has undoubtedly catalyzed them, not least\nthrough the exploitation of new spaces online through which\nit is able to voice opposition. It is here that social media as a\nvehicle becomes especially relevant.\nAnti-Muslim, Anti-Islam Expression in\nSocial Media Spaces\nAs mentioned previously, far-right groups had been using\nsocial media to oppose mosques and campaign against\nMuslims and Islam elsewhere in the West Midlands region.\nThe BNP had orchestrated a particularly polemical\nIslamophobic campaign via Facebook against the proposed\nThese [Muslim] bastards will not go away and until we kick\nthem all out and send them back to their own countries we will\nhave to continue fighting this war. But every time a Muslim\nblows himself up or abuses a white person or tries to take over a\nneighbourhood we gain more supporters. Time is actually on our\nside and all of Europe is itching to kick these useless perverts\nout of Europe. I do not know one person who wants Muslims in\nEurope . . . If Hitler hadn't gone and messed things up for\nnationalism we would never have let them in. Well the tables are\nturning and these guys are toast (p. 162).\nAs Lee (2000) explained, online spaces appear to afford\nindividuals a greater sense of security: \"the less involved\nface-to-face contact, the more likely respondents were to\nadmit to socially undesirable behaviour\" (p. 3). Consequently,\nit would seem that this \"sense of security\" gave space to\nsome to be more open with their discriminatory and prejudi-\ncial views. Likewise, Marham and Baym (2009) explained\nhow the online spaces continually invert and blur the bound-\naries between the private and the public where that which\nmight typically be restricted to the privatized spaces now\nbegin to permeate the public also, albeit those that exist\nonline. Online spaces therefore create environments where\nsocial disruption occurs: Where what is deemed acceptable\nand unacceptable, private and public, legitimate and illegiti-\nmate become increasingly blurred. As Markham and Baym\n(2009) noted in relation to this, the result is an ever increas-\ning \"willingness of private citizens to bare the most personal\nand private elements of their lives to mass audiences\" (p. xi).\nGiven that prejudices and discriminations are typically\nrestricted to the private, it is maybe unsurprising that given\nthe social disruption occurring, that such sentiment and\nexpression would appear to be beginning to emerge publicly\nonline.\nMethods and Approaches Using Online\nSpaces\nThe pilot study focused on the Facebook group opposing the\nmosque with the greatest number of followers. Identified as\nStop Dudley Super Mosque and Islamic Village (membership\nfile was used soon after to join the group. From a research\nethics point of view, it was decided that an open as opposed\nto closed or hidden approach to the undertaking would be\nmost appropriate. On joining the group, a personal statement\nwas posted on the group's wall giving information about the\nintentions for joining and which included full contact details\nas well as a link to an institutional webpage. This was ques-\ntioned by just one member of the group, someone who as\npart of an ongoing communication admitted to be using a\npseudonym to covertly monitor certain individuals affiliated\nto the group. While this open approach seemed appropriate,\nthe potential adverse consequences of doing so were\nacknowledged. At the individual level, this included causing\ndismay among existing Facebook \"friends\" as well as\nencountering hostility or abuse from group members, neither\nof which incidentally occurred. Instead, some members of\nthe group expressed genuine interest in the study.\nShortly after the initial introduction, a further statement\nwas posted inviting members to discuss their opposition to\nthe mosque. Doing so was potentially problematic. Such a\ndirect and overt approach could have been offputting to some\nmembers of the group, not least because of the sensitivity of\nthe subject matter. And indeed, this approach did fail to get\nany significant buy-in from group members with only a few\nresponding. In addition to being offputting, it is possible that\nsuch an approach might also have the potential to skew the\nfindings through the identification and subsequent engage-\nment with those holding stronger feelings of opposition or at\nleast to be more vociferous with them. Given the Facebook\ngroup was created with the sole intention of opposing the\nmosque, it was felt that approaching members to discuss this\nwould not necessarily be too problematic.\nIn trying to overcome the lack of buy-in from members,\nthe next approach was to send direct messages to those who\nwere most active. As before though, there was again a gen-\neral reluctance to engage. This was interesting because\ndespite the fact that many were willing to post personally\nattributable explicit messages on the group's wall, few\nappeared willing to personally discuss them. One explana-\ntion might relate back to Lee (2000) and his theories relating\nto unobtrusive research methods. In the context of Facebook,\nmight one-to-one contact be perceived as face-to-face con-\ntact? To try and overcome this, a new approach was devised\nbased on Back et al.'s (2010) observations about the need to\nclose the gap between the actual and self-idealized individual\non Facebook. In trying to ensure members felt a critical dis-\ntance was being maintained, anonymity was offered to those\nwishing to engage. Recalling Lee (2000), anonymity was\nclearly seen by members as affording them greater individual\nprotection. It would seem that expressing something to a\nknown and attributable individual was perceived quite dif-\nferently from expressing much the same to a mass and indis-\ncriminately unknown audience.\nThe Back et al. (2010) inspired approach required the cre-\nation of an anonymous online questionnaire. Comprising 10\nquestions, 3 quantitative and 6 qualitative were coupled with\nan additional question relating to consent. Targeting the 50\nmost active members, direct messages were again sent this\ntime including a link to the questionnaire and a statement\nabout anonymity should they choose to participate. Noting\nHewson, Yule, Laurent, and Vogel (2003), this non-probabi-\nlistic sampling method is not without problem. Most notably,\nrespondents would represent a dramatically skewed sample\nof the population at large, thereby lacking generalizability.\nWhile acknowledging this, this approach remained valuable\ngiven that the sample did not need to be representative of any\nwider population. Instead, the research was focused on the\nviews of a very specific group of individuals for whom\nopposing the mosque via Facebook was their common cause.\nSuch an approach is not without precedent. As Hewson et al.\n(2003) went on to note, social and behavioral science\nresearch routinely uses selective approaches to sampling\nwhen investigating special interests.\nAnonymity prompted unprecedented results. Having\nsent only 50 requests, 65 questionnaires were duly com-\npleted. Given some snowballing occurred, this presented\nfurther methodological problems not least because ano-\nnymity meant that it was impossible to differentiate\nbetween those invited and those gained through the snow-\nballing process. Equally problematic was that it was\nunclear whether those snowballed were members of the\nFacebook group. Future research would therefore need to\nincorporate safeguards in this respect, to confirm the mem-\nbership of respondents as a sample. In relation to the\nincreased levels of response following the incorporation of\nanonymity, most of the received questionnaires were com-\npleted to a high standard. Although arguments and ideas\nwere reasonably well articulated, a reasonably high per-\ncentage of completed questionnaires used a form of \"text-\nspeak.\" A significant number of others were completed\nwith the incorporation of a very strong Black Country dia-\nlect. Some combined the two. With this in mind, all\nresponses are reproduced verbatim including any local dia-\nlect or colloquialisms as also any typographical or gram-\nmatical errors or inconsistencies.\nFindings: Arguments, Themes, and\nAnalysis\nFrom analyzing the questionnaires, 61% of respondents\nidentified as male and 39% as female. The largest age group\nof respondents identified as being between the ages of 26 and\nThe remaining 5% of respondents identified as being above\n60 years of age. In terms of location, more than three quarters\nof respondents stated they lived in the West Midlands region.\nThe greatest number of respondents identified as living in the\ntown of Dudley (37%). A further 25% of respondents lived in\nareas adjoining the town, in Cradley Heath, Gornal,\nNetherton, and Tipton. A further 11% identified as living in\nthe Black Country more widely, in places such as Walsall and\nWolverhampton. Another 5% of respondents stated that they\nlived elsewhere in the West Midlands conurbation including\nthe city of Birmingham. Given the vast majority of respon-\ndents identified as living in the locale of Dudley, any find-\nings might challenge pre-existing notions about opposition\nto the mosque in the town. As the findings from the West\nMidlands case study noted (Allen, 2010b), many Muslim\ncommunity leaders believed that local people in Dudley and\nthe surrounding areas overwhelmingly supported the pro-\nposed mosque. Maybe somewhat misguidedly, they believed\nthat opposition emanated from \"outside agitators\" who were\nopportunistically promoting and voicing opposition as a\nmeans of creating divisions (Allen, 2013a). Because of the\nlimitations of the sample group, it cannot be categorically\nconcluded that this is not the case. However, given that a\nsignificant percentage of respondents claimed to live in the\nBlack Country and used highly localized dialects throughout,\nit might be right to at least question the \"outside agitators\"\nperception.\nFrom initial analyses, a clear resonance emerged for\nopposing the mosque in Dudley with those identified by Gale\n(2005) in nearby Birmingham. Most prominent was the\nnotion that England remained a Christian country, that Islam\nwas \"alien\" to England and its heritage, and that were the\nmosque to be built, there would be an exponential growth in\nthe numbers of Muslims living nearby. Some differences\nwere however apparent. For instance, although Gale noted\nhow opponents rarely challenged the decision making of the\nplanning authority, in Dudley, this emerged as a relatively\nwell articulated argument from a significant minority of\nrespondents. As one put it,\nI am opposed to the proposed building being constructed on the\nsite at Hall St as the site was designated as industrial land for the\ncreation of jobs. A mosque does not fit the criteria and was\nrightly (in my opinion) refused planning permission based on\nplanning rules. It does not help when the DMA [Dudley Muslim\nAssociation] say they will press on with the plans apparently\nwith no thought for anyone's legitimate objections.\nThe location was clearly problematic. For some, this was\nbecause of the perception that it would have a detrimental\nimpact on the area as well as the quality of life of those living\nthere. As another respondent put it,\nIt's being built the top of my street the cars am horrendous dow\nmy street I think they should just expand the other 1 and build\n6 SAGE Open\nsumthink for the kids of Dudley as they are bord n need sumthink\nto entertain them or build houses as we are cleanly in need of\nmore housing.\nGiven that such arguments go against the findings of\nGale's research in nearby Birmingham, it would be wrong to\nconclude that such opposition was anti-Muslim per se.\nInstead, what such arguments might highlight is the very\nreal anxiety that some in British society have about the\nbuilding of mosques and of the religion of Islam more\nwidely. This can be seen in the findings from the British\nnationally representative findings highlighted how more\nthan half the British population would be concerned if a\nlarge mosque was to be built near where they lived. The\nsurvey also highlighted how a significant proportion of the\npopulation expressed feeling \"cool\" toward Islam while also\nbelieving that \"religious diversity\"--largely equated with\nthe presence of Muslims and Islam--had detrimentally\naffected British society. It would seem fair to suggest that\nthese nationally identified concerns had resonance with\nwhat was occurring in Dudley. As such, respondents from\nthe Facebook group expressed their apparent anxieties about\nthe mosque, were decidedly \"cool\" about it--albeit never\nusing the term itself--and felt that the mosque, as also Islam\nand Muslims, were having a detrimental impact on the town.\nStill though, it is important--and indeed necessary--to add\nthat it was extremely difficult to disaggregate what might be\nlegitimate opposition and that which might have been rather\nmore driven by discriminatory views and ideas about\nMuslims and Islam.\nOne explanation for public anxiety was apparent in the\nview that both the mosque and the religion of Islam were\ninherently exclusive: excluding those who were not Muslim\nand thereby the majority of local people. A recurrent reaction\nto this was for the need to build something \"for all\" instead.\nSuch a reaction however overlooks the fact that this is a\nmosque, a building that would be as exclusive to worship-\npers as indeed all other places of worship are. However, the\nreaction is interesting, as an integral part of the original\n\"Pride of Dudley\" plans was the adjoining community center\nthat the DMAstated would be \"for all\" (Allen, 2013a). Given\nthat this did not specifically feature in any of the responses,\nmight this suggest that the original plans were poorly com-\nmunicated, that local residents simply did not believe it\nwould be \"for all,\" or was it that the views of respondents\nmerely reflected those of the wider British population?\nTrying to disaggregate responses in this way was problem-\natic. Further muddying the situation was the argument put\nforward by a handful of respondents which related to the\nissue of religion as opposed to Islam specifically:\nI don't want to see any new religious buildings being built when\nthe money and land could be used to build something more\nneeded and more productive for the whole community.\nSuch comments seemed to reflect the shift away from\npublic religiosity in today's Britain more so than anything\nthat was specifically anti-Muslim or anti-Islam. However, as\nwith the British Social Attitudes Survey (Park et al., 2010),\nwhen people spoke about \"religious diversity\" and its appar-\nent detrimental impact on British society, many were using\nthe term \"religious diversity\" as code for the presence of\nMuslim communities. As such, it is unclear to what extent\nsuch responses might be Islamophobic.\nRespondents also referred to the perceived cost of the\nmosque as justification for opposition. It is necessary to\nstress that it is unclear to what level, if indeed any, public\nfunds have or would be contributed toward construction and\nmaintenance, conclusive information has been difficult to\nobtain (Allen, 2013a). Although representatives from the\nDMA claim that the mosque is being funded entirely from\nwithin Dudley's Muslim communities, there have been con-\nflicting reports in local media claiming that the proposed\nmosque would require \u00a318 million of public funding in addi-\ntion to the legal costs referred to previously (Allen, 2013a).\nThis and the claims made by the DMA were tackled by one\nrespondent:\nThe Muslim community is way too small in Dudley to be able to\nraise \u00a318 million. It's too large a project but the capacity of the\nmillion. There are Mosques in Birmingham with capacities of\nmore densely populated Muslim areas making the collection of\nfunds easier. The people that fund Mosques are taxi drivers,\nrestaurant workers and those with everyday office jobs. No\nmillionaire is going to wade in with the money and no middle\neastern government would give any money unless it's to a\nMosque in London/ Manchester/Birmingham/Glasgow/\nEdinburgh, etc. with strong theological links back to the Middle\neast which this Mosque and small community does not have.\nAlthough competing claims have been routinely made\nabout public funding, it is necessary to acknowledge what\nappeared to be very real concerns by some respondents about\nthe potential or actual public cost of the mosque. When con-\nsidered against a backdrop of austerity cuts, an economic\ndownturn and the fact that some of Dudley's areas are in the\ntop 10% of those with the highest levels of poverty in the\ncountry (Dudley Children & Young People's Partnership,\n2011), it may be understandable why public investment is\nseen to be contentious. Given the public nature of the fallout\nfrom the mosque, despite the many refutations put forward\nby the DMA as also Dudley MBC, both would seem to have\nfailed to convince local people that public monies are not\nbeing invested nor that the mosque is being funded solely by\nDudley's Muslims. From interviews undertaken with those\nassociated with the DMA (Allen, 2010b), it was suggested\nthat additional funds were being sought overseas to enable\nthe building of the mosque, something that not only reso-\nnates with the comments of the previous respondent but that\ncould also lead to more public anxiety given what this might\nbe perceived to mean.\nSize was a significant and recurrent feature of respon-\ndents' opposition, both in relation to the size of Dudley's\nMuslim communities and of the mosque. These were largely\nvoiced through arguments that pitted the two against each\npopulation identified as Muslim, slightly less than the\nnational average of 3% at the time (Reeves, 2008). In line\nwith the national picture, the vast majority of those identify-\ning as Muslim in Dudley were of Pakistani, Bangladeshi, or\nIndian heritage. So although the Muslim population as a per-\ncentage of the town's population was slightly smaller than\nthe national average, it was not disproportionately so. Of\ncourse, it is necessary to stress the irrelevancy of seeking to\nconfer any legitimacy on arguments that seek to equate the\nnumber of Muslims with any resultant size or numbers of\nmosque. Not only are such arguments misleading but are also\nextremely problematic and highly dangerous. Size though\nwas a recurrent focus, something that respondents clearly\nlinked with notions of \"need\":\nWe have enough Mosque's already! Why build another one?\nAs a number of respondents pointed out, given the town\nalready had three established mosques, there was no \"need\"\nfor the new, significantly larger mosque. Reflecting on this,\nit was again apparent that the greatest challenge in analyzing\nthe responses was the issue of whether, and if so where,\nrespondents were covertly opposing the mosque on the sole\nbasis of being anti-Muslim or anti-Islam, if indeed they were.\nOne way of trying to navigate this is to consider the\nopposition in Dudley with that expressed elsewhere. What\nwas evident in Dudley was that the mosque was clearly\nbeing opposed on the basis of its visuality as the meaning\nattributed to it rather than as mere structural aesthetics\nall forms of opposition expressed in relation to the Dudley\nmosque had been routinely dismissed out of hand by both\nDudley MBC and the DMA, which undoubtedly created a\nhighly emotive and politicized landscape. Such a landscape\nis extremely problematic because as G\u00f6le (2011) noted, the\nconstruction of mosques have become inextricably bound\nto social and community constructions that not only reify\nsocial and cultural boundaries but also reinforce the stereo-\ntypes and meanings attributed to Muslims and Islam. This\nwas clearly evident in the comments of some of the respon-\ndents. For example, some posited the idea that the mosque--\nand by likely consequence, Islam and Muslims--was\nagainst the \"norm\" of Dudley. Notions of the \"norm\" were\nvariously expressed through markers of culture, value, and\nheritage:\n[the mosque] does not go with the heritage of Dudley it will\ndominate the towns picturesque skyline . . .\n. . . Dudley is in the Black Country, known for the Black Country\nmuseum and its history, also the Zoo and Castle. In years to\ncome it will be known for this proposed mosque . . .\nThe issue of size was also incorporated within this:\n. . . [the mosque is] planned to be higher than \"Top Church,\" is\nthis a statement?\nMuch of the early local political campaigning against the\nmosque featured this type of discursive argument. From the\nallegation that the mosque's minaret would overshadow the\nspire of the \"Top Church\" through to the opposition recently\nposited by the EDL about the mosque contravening the medi-\neval nature of the town, the idea that the mosque could never\nbe a part of Dudley was recurrent. It is interesting, especially\nin the light of Gale's findings, whether this manifestation of\nopposition first emerged in political campaigns or whether\npolitical actors duly picked up on it following engagement\nwith local residents. Nonetheless, as G\u00f6le (2011) rightly sug-\ngested, the visuality of the mosque--more so, what that visu-\nality was seen to represent--was clearly influential in the\nway in which opposition was voiced and justified.\nIt was particularly interesting how visuality and meaning\nwere combined with other arguments for opposition. For the\nrespondent who highlighted the idea that the mosque \" . . .\ndoes not go with [Dudley's] heritage . . . \" or \" . . . pictur-\nesque skyline . . . \" this was voiced in combination with\n. . . the Islamification of these shores is not acceptable!! No to\nsharia law.\nAnother suggested something similar but about Muslims\nand Islam rather more indiscriminately:\n. . . very violent actions promoted by the Muslim community,\nthis worries me about their intentions . . .\nAnother respondent associated ideas that were far more\nworrying in terms of the visuality and meaning of the\nmosque:\n. . . [the minarets resemble] look out posts (I know what they say\nthey are) . . . [the] design of the buildings seem more fortified\ncastles than spiritual houses . . .\nAnother gave an insight into how they attached meaning\nto the visual aspect of the mosque:\n. . . mosques currently in existence would appear to be hotbeds\nof extremism . . . media reports have produced what would seem\nto be conclusive proof that a great deal of what is preached by\nthe Imams is filled with hate and incitement to cause harm.\nClearly, the mosque as physical structure was interpreted\nas being more than a mere place of worship. Far removed\n8 SAGE Open\nfrom the aesthetics, therefore, were a number of different\nrepresentative and symbolic meanings that in turn were seen\nto require greater attention and urgency. Likewise, these\nsame meanings were those that created anxieties.\nIt might be that the culmination of these meanings about\nIslam and Muslims became most evident in the recurrent\nnotion of \"Islamification.\" Especially prominent in the dis-\ncourses of the far-right for much of the past half decade\n(Allen, 2011), the EDL has been one of the most prolific\nexponents of using \"Islamification\" as a means of justifying\nhostility and hatred toward Muslims and Islam on what it\nthe EDL, Islamification can be seen in \"a country besieged\nby Muslims, the erosion of Christmas, jihadist preachers,\nthe banning of nativity plays, halal-meat-only school din-\nners, the marginalization of Englishness, the removal of the\nthat EDL has regularly marched and protested in various\nlocations where mosques are being built or proposed, it\nmight be fair to conclude that for them at least, the building\nof more mosques is clearly evidence of this process of\nIslamification. This resonated with many of the responses:\n. . . this is England. We let them in without a problem, let them\nlive English lives seeing as they are in England and then they try\nand turn it into a Muslim Islamic place and that isn't the worst\npart, the worst is that after that and when the numbers grow, they\nwill attempt to overtake the country and win the general election\ndue to numbers and then imply sharia law and I don't care to see\nthat happen to my country.\nCoupled with the perceived need to defend against Islam\nand Muslims, these responses resonated with broader dis-\ncourses of Islamophobia where Islam and Muslims seen as\nposing a threat to who \"we\" are and what \"we\" are perceived\nof some, this was applied not only to Dudley but also beyond,\nto England and indeed Britain:\nIslam is taking over Britain. British people are becoming second\nclass citizens in their own community.\nThis response is extremely similar to one made by the\nEDL a few years ago: \"[the EDL will] not let our culture and\ntraditions be eroded . . . \" therefore justifying the need to \" .\n. . preserve English values\" (\"Six Hurt as Car Hits Pedestrians\nin Dudley,\" 2010). It is interesting how the EDL has rational-\nized this perceived need to resist Islamification not just as a\nmeans of preserving \"our\" way of life, values, and culture\nbut also to refute accusations of Islamophobia (Allen, 2011).\nQuite irrespective of whether they achieve this or not, clear\nresonance between the discourses of the EDL and the respon-\ndents was evident.\nIn line with Gale's (2005) study of mosque opposition in\nBirmingham, the need to oppose Islamification was also evi-\ndent in the way in which Islam--the mosque as physical\nmanifestation, Muslims as human manifestation--was\nrepeatedly differentiated from Christianity as a means of jus-\ntifying a \"them\" and \"us\" dichotomy. Although Reeves et al.\n(2009) noted how Dudley's Christian heritage had previ-\nously fed tensions between Muslims and non-Muslims in the\ntown, it was clear that the utilization and accentuation of\nChristianity and Christianness as an integral part of \"our\"\nidentity was ongoing. Seemingly irrespective of the actuality\nof Christian identity, doing so seemed to function by rein-\nforcing and codifying the otherness of Islam and Muslims,\nsomething that was evident in the responses. Again though,\nthis reflected local political discourses. Those such as Cllr\nDavis routinely stressed what he perceived to be the differ-\nences between Islam and Christianity. Unsurprisingly, there-\nfore, this notion of the mosque going against \"our\" Christian\nidentity and, as Davis put it, the Christian needs of Dudley\nwas recurrent.\nDemarcations of \"us\" and \"them\" were largely implicit,\nexpressed through what might best be termed as coded and\ncovert expressions. For some, however, this was much more\nexplicit. As one respondent stated, their opposition was\nfounded on the view that\n. . . Dudley use to belong to us White people not foreigners.\nOthers were more offensive. For them, the mosque would\n. . . mean more paki's will commute into the Dudley area, thus\ncreating a curry infested atmosphere and I for one despise the\ncunts.\nIt is worth stressing that such overtly discriminatory and\noffensive expressions were evident in only a minority of the\nresponses. So although many used markers of Islam or\nMuslimness to demarcate \"them\" from \"us,\" few explicitly\ndid so through the utilization of racist and racialized dis-\ncourses. Whether this reflects a shift away from the recogni-\ntion of skin color, ethnicity, nationality, and so on as markers\nof discrimination remains open to question. Indeed, it is pos-\nsible that people might have become rather more nuanced,\nrecognizing that the expression of anti-Muslim or anti-Islam\nsentiment has acquired a much greater social and political\ncivility than similar expressions against Black or other\nBritish Muslims & Islamophobia, 1997). Yet, as the respon-\ndent's comments highlight, in the minds of some at least,\nreligious and racial markers--Muslim and \"Paki\"--are\ninterchangeable if not entirely the same.\nDisconnected Publicly, Connected\nOnline\nA final theme to emerge from the analysis did not specifi-\ncally relate to mosques or even Islam or Muslims. For many\nrespondents, alongside various other arguments, there was\nthe expression of how they felt overlooked or excluded from\npublic and political debates about the mosque. Quite irre-\nspective of the main thrust of their opposition, few respon-\ndents expressed that they had been able to find a voice in the\nproceedings. So prominent was this sense of disconnect that\nalmost three quarters of respondents referred to it albeit\nthrough a combination of both explicit and implicit dis-\ncourses. Some of these are set out below:\nBecause the majority of people in Dudley don't want it but their\nprotests fall on deaf ears!\n. . . because the local community opposed it, but as per usual no\none listens.\n. . . because I support the people of Dudley who are clearly\nagainst it, and the council who also turned down the proposal,\nuntil intervention from the government who care nothing for the\npeople of Dudley.\nFrom analyzing the responses, clearly, the lack of opportu-\nnities arising to voice opposition to the construction of the\nmosque--whether legitimate or other--created something of\na vacuum. Although Dudley MBC and the DMA publicly\nopposed each other until the common enemy of the EDL\narrived, those wanting to voice opposition found their views\nbeing curtailed and dismissed as irrelevant and in some\nfew opportunities or spaces appear to have been made avail-\nable to them where voicing their opinions about the mosque\nmight have made local residents feel respected and valued.\nAnd as research has shown, the far-right has capitalized on\nthese vacuums (Allen, 2011). Exploiting the fact that many\nfeel they are not being heard, those who become desperate to\nhave their voice heard are increasingly drawn toward those\nwilling to listen. Given that this tends to be the far-right, indi-\nviduals become aligned with them more on the basis of them\nhaving listened as opposed to explicitly supporting or even\nunderstanding their campaigns or ideologies. By doing so, the\nfar-right valorize those marginalized voices whereas simulta-\nneously, those marginalized voices subsequently valorize the\nfar-right. This was succinctly put by one respondent:\n. . . as an EDL member I feel that the peeps off Dudley 'av just\nbeen ignord that's why we the EDL do wot as to be done.\nWhat should be neither overlooked nor underestimated is\nthat the EDL and indeed others are doing \"wot [has] to be\ndone\" not only in Dudley but also in many other places.\nContextualizing the Findings\nAs a pilot, this research sought to engage Facebook group\nmembers opposing the proposed Dudley mosque to explore\nthe causes and drivers underpinning their opposition. In\naddition, the pilot sought to share preliminary findings\nabout how social and political opposition functions in the\nvirtual spaces. As before, however, it is necessary to reiter-\nate the limitations of the pilot not least given the con-\nstraints of the methodologies adopted and that this was an\nopportunistic study. And as many of the groups referred to\nhere have since been closed, these findings might best be\nseen as being largely indicative. Nonetheless, the study\ngenerated significant qualitative data and used in conjunc-\ntion with the research undertaken on behalf of the European\nMuslim Research Centre, it is possible that the findings\nhave wider appeal and impact. Evidence of this can be seen\nin how the pilot provided new opportunities to re-consider\nand re-contextualize existing scholarly literature while\nalso providing a timely insight into the opposition\nexpressed toward the building of mosques. Likewise, the\npilot provided findings worthy of consideration and further\nquestioning as regard the relevance of social media, social\nnetworking, and online tools as both a method and site for\nresearch.\nFrom the findings alone, the opposition shown toward\nDudley mosque clearly resonates with opposition shown\ntoward the building of mosques elsewhere. Drawing on a\nwide range of different arguments and justifications, these\nreflected previously identified themes for opposition, in par-\nticular, those identified by Gale (2005): of Islam being\n\"alien\" to English heritage, its Christian identity, and fears of\nan expansion of Islam and Muslims in the surrounding area.\nReframing these within a contemporary context, it could be\nargued that the findings from the pilot went further than\nGale's study, highlighting a number of more pressing, con-\ntemporarily contextualized arguments. These included\nopposing the mosque through challenging the decision mak-\ning of the planning authority, something that the existing lit-\nerature only tentatively touches on. More substantially\nthough, the pilot highlighted how the mosque--and by con-\nsequence, Islam and Muslims--was perceived to be exclu-\nsive, a drain on limited public money and resources, as also\nbeing deemed unnecessary and far from \"needed\" by anyone\nin the town, Muslim or non-Muslim. The findings also\ntouched on the growing public antipathy toward all forms of\npublic religion in today's Britain, not just that being shown\ntoward Islam and Muslims alone.\nWithout doubt, the visuality and meaning attributed to\nmosques were extremely important. As G\u00f6le (2011) rightly\nnoted, the public signs and symbols of Islam and Muslims\nare increasingly becoming entities on which social, political,\nand cultural dissonance and dispute are being projected. As\nG\u00f6le adds, physical structures such as mosques not only cat-\nalyze this but also accentuate concerns about the re-territori-\nalization of space and the presence of difference, both visual\nand non-visual. The construction of mosques is therefore no\nlonger a matter for Muslim communities; unsurprising that\nmany of those who joined the Facebook group seemingly\nlived in close proximity to the proposed site of the mosque.\nAs G\u00f6le concludes, mosques are increasingly seen as more\nthan mere places of worship, instead functioning as cultural\nartifacts, representative and symbolic of all that is contempo-\nrarily known and understood about Muslims and Islam. And\nthis includes those meanings that are contemporarily seen as\ninforming what is wrong or problematic with Muslims and\nIslam. Mosques, therefore, not only become inextricably\nbound to social and community constructions about Muslims\nand Islam but also become visual and physical structures that\nseemingly evidence them.\nGiven the emphasis on the visuality of mosques--both in\nterms of physical and symbolic manifestations--a consider-\nation of Allen's (2010a) use of semiotics theory may be\nappropriate. While other theories might be relevant--includ-\ning social integration and social cognitive theory, particu-\nlarly in relation to the online public spheres--Allen's use of\nthis theoretical frame to interrogate other manifestations of\nIslamophobic and anti-Muslim expression would seem to\nlend itself to this particular context and associated con-\nstraints. Referring to \"visual identifiers,\" Allen set out how a\nvast array of different markers and characteristics of Islam\nand Muslims were being increasingly appropriated as\n\"signs.\" For him, these signs functioned by signaling what is\nperceived to be contemporarily known, received, and\naccepted as valid in terms of the meanings of Islam and\nMuslims somewhat irrespective of whether that be accurate\nor inaccurate, fair or unfair, and so on. It would seem that the\nmosque functions in accordance with this theoretical prem-\nise: as a \"visual identifier\" signaling that which is perceived\nto be known and subsequently accepted about Muslims and\nIslam. In the contemporary setting therefore, this becomes\nmanifested in meanings that perceive mosques to be, among\nothers, \"hotbeds of extremism\" where \"sharia law\" ferments.\nLikewise,theyarealsoperceivedtosignalthe\"Islamification\"\nof Dudley and beyond. None was more obvious than this in\nthe observation by the respondent who claimed the \"design\nof the buildings seem more fortified castles than spiritual\nhouses,\" especially given how the minarets resemble look-\nout towers.\nFor Allen, all those for whom the visual identifiers make\nknown such meanings have the potential themselves to be\nIslamophobic or at least interpret meaning within an ideo-\nlogical Islamophobic frame (Allen, 2010a). This requires\nfurther explanation and it is here that relevance of the mosque\nas not being a part of the \"norm\" becomes vitally important.\nAs noted previously, not only was the mosque--in its func-\ntion as visual identifier--not seen to be part of the norm but\nwas also seen to be never able. Instead, the mosque signaled\nthe perceived threat posed to Dudley and \"us\" more widely.\nUnderpinning this was the identification and demarcation of\n\"us\" and \"them.\" Opposition to the mosque \"makes sense\"\nbecause it is about preserving the self from the threatening\nother. As the Commission on British Muslims and\nIslamophobia (1997) put it, such processes function in ways\nthat appear to be \"commonsense\" despite being divisive and\nhighly discriminatory.\nTo what extent then might all opposition shown toward\nthe mosque be seen to be discriminatory or even\nIslamophobic? For Allen (2010a), Islamophobia has to be\nunderstood both singularly and variously in terms systems of\nthought, belief, and action that seek to actively reinforce\nIslam and Muslims as the \"other.\" Islamophobia is therefore\nnot necessarily restricted to any specific action, practice, dis-\ncrimination, or prejudice but can be found in the meaning\nthat is, at times, both critically and uncritically accepted as\nnatural and normative of Muslims, Islam, or both. Clarke\n(2003) argued that through such ideological processes, a\nsense of order is formulated, one that establishes and rein-\nforces notions of who we are, or more precisely, who we are\nnot. For him, this is achieved through processes of stigmati-\nzation, marginalization, and intolerance that are necessary to\nlegitimize \"us\" as \"norm.\" It would seem reasonable to sug-\ngest that underpinning many of the arguments expressed in\nopposing the mosque was a formulated sense of order.\nWithout any doubt, many of the arguments of opposition\nexpressed by respondents embodied a clear sense of who\n\"we\" are while clearly demarcating the \"us\" from \"them.\"\nTo what extent is it therefore legitimate to suggest that any\nopposition that accentuates difference might not necessarily be\nIslamophobic but might have the potential to be interpreted as\nsuch and thereby fuel the discrimination perpetuated by others?\nWhat the findings from this study suggest is that even where\nthere is some evidence of an \"us\" and \"them\" dichotomy exist-\ning, it would be extremely difficult and rather simplistic to sug-\ngest that all those voicing dichotomous discourses were\nIslamophobic: discriminatory probably, but Islamophobic not\nnecessarily, something that creates a series of very real dilem-\nmas. For instance, where do the boundaries of Islamophobia\nbegin and end? Similarly, when are the lines between valid and\ninvalid, legitimate and illegitimate opposition crossed?\nLikewise, how can one know when justified opposition trans-\ngresses into unjustified opposition? What the study in Dudley\nhighlights is that a good number of people--even those who\nare prepared to express their opposition in the blurred reality/\nunreality of the private/public online spaces--have many dif-\nferent oppositional viewpoints that they perceive to be legiti-\nmate, valid, or justified. The vast majority are not, one might\nsuggest, Islamophobic, anti-Muslim, or anti-Islamic per se; nor\nare they even likely to be explicitly prejudicial or discrimina-\ntory as indeed the findings might suggest. Yet, when those indi-\nviduals fail to acquire a voice and are left feeling excluded,\nignored, and marginalized, it is possible that their views harden,\nthereby requiring them to seek outlets--or conversely, \"out-\nlets\" such as the far-right to seek them--to find valorization.\nAny ensuing Islamophobia, therefore, may be the consequence\nof a transitional process of seeking valorization and not neces-\nsarily a start point for many, whether focusing on those joining\nFacebook groups or indeed voicing opposition elsewhere. The\nreasons for joining and being a member of an online Facebook\ngroup that opposes the building of a mosque, therefore, may\nnot be as simple as one might presume. More likely, the reasons\nare far more complex and multi-faceted and driven by social\nand political conditions as much as anything else.\nAnd this is where the irony becomes apparent: that which\nconnected all of those engaging through the Facebook group\nwas a sense of disconnect. This sense of disconnect may pro-\nvide some insight into why Facebook groups, social net-\nworks, and other online spaces are being used not only to\noppose mosques but also, more importantly, to encourage\nothers to do so. As Gurak and Logie (2003) put it,\nthe highly specialised virtual spaces on the internet make it easy\nto join a community and quickly understand and assume this\ncommunity ethos . . . often, participants do not have to spend\ntime making introductory remarks or defending the premises of\ntheir statements. This \"instant ethos\" makes it easy to reach\nmany individuals of similar values. (p. 31)\nIn conjunction with the lack or at least the perceived lack of\nopportunities to engage and find a voice in the offline \"real\"\nspaces, it would seem that social media increasingly provides\nthose immediate opportunities to not only find a voice but also\nto find valorization. This will, as Facebook has found since this\nresearch was undertaken, require a constant process of scrutiny\nand revision to try and ensure that those \"individuals of similar\nvalues\" have fewer opportunities to form communities that\nhave the potential to foster and promote discrimination, big-\notry, and hatred. And it is here that notions of opposition\nbecome relevant once more. As Shirky (2009) noted,\n. . . when it becomes simple to form groups, we get both the\ngood and the bad ones. This is going to force society from\nsimply preventing groups from forming to actively deciding\nwhich existing ones to try to oppose . . . (p. 21)\nIt is therefore likely that groups opposing others that\noppose will be undoubtedly necessary.\nNote\n1.
