To this end, five glossing conditions were adopted (i.e., inference-gloss-gloss, gloss-retrieval-\ngloss, inference-gloss-retrieval-gloss, gloss-retrieval-gloss-retrieval, and full glossing). The participants were 140 MA\nstudents of Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL). They were randomly assigned to one glossing condition to\nread an English reading passage. Five target words were glossed in different glossing conditions within a reading passage.\nTo ensure the participants' attention focused on the reading material, the participants were told that a multiple-choice\nreading comprehension test would be administrated. Afterward, two vocabulary tests (i.e., form recall and meaning recall)\nwere conducted. The results of one-way MANOVAs and the post hoc Scheff\u00e9 tests revealed that the full glossing condition\ngroup did significantly better than other glossing groups in vocabulary form recall, whereas the gloss-retrieval-gloss-retrieval\ncondition group outperformed other four groups in vocabulary meaning recall.\n",

Glossing in second language (L2) learning\nrefers to providing a summary of words' meaning in a text\nusually found as notes in the margin or between the lines of\nthe text (Richards & Schmidt, 2010). Glosses can be defini-\ntions, interpretations, explanations, or translations. They can\nhave positive effects on student's vocabulary learning due to\nconsciousness raising attained from their bolded form, their\navailability, shortening the time needed for searching for the\nword in the dictionary, and providing the appropriate mean-\ning for glossed words or vocabulary (Hashemian & Fadaei,\n2012). Taking into account the positive findings of the effec-\ntiveness of marginal glosses, researchers have recently\nattempted to determine what types of glosses or glossing\nconditions generate more positive effects on L2 learners'\nreading comprehension and vocabulary learning (e.g.,\nLaufer and Hulstijn (2001) proposed Involvement Load\nHypothesis based on which tasks activating need, search,\nand evaluation of the meaning of unfamiliar words will lead\nto higher vocabulary learning than those which do not trigger\nsuch processes. Moreover, Laufer and Hulstijn argued that\ncompared with other tasks, glossing does not trigger search\nor evaluation processes and encourages weak involvement\nload. Recently, Huang and Lin (2014) said that \"glossing can\nincrease the possibility of learning correct word meanings in\ncontext, but leaving words unglossed for learners to infer or\nretrieve their word meanings may increase the involvement\nload and mental effort, thus contributing to better retention\"\n(p. 128). Therefore, preceding glossing with inference (i.e.,\nguessing a new word's meaning from context) or following\nglossing with retrieval (i.e., the act of remembering words'\nmeaning) may complement vocabulary learning (Rott, 2007).\nRetrieval is defined as the ability to recall words or items\nafter an interval of time (Richards & Schmidt, 2010). It is\nalso suggested that repeated retrieval would decrease the\npossibility of forgetting an item (Nowzan & Baryaji, 2013).\nAmong studies done on glossing as a means of vocabu-\nlary learning, some found that marginal glossing has a posi-\ntive effect on vocabulary learning (e.g., Hashemian & Fadaei,\n1Department of ELT, Khouzestan Sience and Research Branch, Islamic\nAzad University, Ahvaz, Iran\n2Department of ELT, Ahvaz Branch, Islamic Azad University, Ahvaz, Iran\nCorresponding Author:\nMohammad Taghi Farvardin, Department of English Language Teaching, Ahvaz\nEmail: farvardin@iauahvaz.ac.ir\nA Comparative Study of the Effects of\nDifferent Glossing Conditions on EFL\nLearners' Vocabulary Recall\nTayebeh Danesh1,2 and Mohammad Taghi Farvardin2\n Keywords\nEFL learners, glossing conditions, vocabulary recall\n2 SAGE Open\n2002), whereas some argued that it does not necessarily lead\nto vocabulary learning as it does not encourage inferencing\nor word meaning retrieval (Huang & Lin, 2014).\nThe effects of combining inferencing with glossing,\nretrieval with glossing, or the effect of combining these three\nfactors together on L2 vocabulary learning constitute an\nimportant research gap. To help overcome and close this gap,\nthe present study has been designed to compare the effects of\nmanipulating three variables (i.e., glossing, inferencing, and\nword meaning retrieval) on vocabulary recall of English as a\nforeign language (EFL) learners.\nLiterature Review\nThere have been a number of studies examining the effect of\nglossing on L2 vocabulary recall. In some studies (e.g.,\nulated by increasing the number of word occurrences or pro-\nviding additional semantic clues for target words (e.g., first\nlanguage [L1] or L2 marginal glosses, appositives, and dic-\ntionary access). Table 1 shows a brief description of some\nprevious studies investigating the effect of glossing condi-\ntions and vocabulary recall.\nRott et al. (2002) conducted a study to examine the effect\nof L1 multiple-choice marginal glosses, L2 text reconstruc-\ntion with opportunities to recheck input, and combination of\nthese two treatments on vocabulary acquisition and reten-\ntion. Seventy-six learners of German were randomly assigned\nto one of the four conditions (three experimental and one\ncontrol). They were selected from fourth-semester language\nclasses. Productive and receptive word gains were tested\nimmediately after the treatment and again 5 weeks later.\nFindings revealed that the multiple-choice marginal gloss\ntreatment resulted in significantly better productive and\nreceptive word gains immediately after the treatment.\nHowever, 5 weeks later, a significant receptive word gain\nwas found for the combined treatment condition. Later, Rott\n(2007) examined the effect of increasing the frequency of\ntarget words as well as L1 (English) marginal glosses in a\nreading text on vocabulary learning. The participants were\n54 learners of German who were native speakers of English.\nThey were selected from four intact fourth-semester lan-\nguage classes. Three reading conditions were compared: In\nthe first condition, the target words were glossed 4 times in\nthe margin of the text in all word occurrences; in the second\ncondition, the target words were first glossed, then they were\nnot glossed (for meaning retention based on the previously\nseen gloss), and bolded twice in the third and fourth word\noccurrences; and in the third condition, the target words were\nglossed for the first occurrence, and then they were bold-\nfaced without glossing. Rott found that the first and second\nreading conditions resulted in more productive word gain\nthan the third condition where readers were presented with\nthe target words only once. She finally concluded that the\ncomprehension of main ideas was the highest when the target\nwords were glossed 4 times followed by the gloss-bolding\nreading condition and the gloss-retrieval task.\nIn another study, Peters (2014) investigated how form\nrecall is influenced by repetition (1, 3, or 5 number of occur-\nrences), type of target item (single words vs. collocations), and\ntime of posttest administration (immediately or 1 week after\nthe learning session) for EFL learners. The participants were\n35 first-year EFL business students from two parallel classes\nat a Flemish university. The participants' first language was\nDutch. A word list including 12 single words and 12 colloca-\ntions accompanied by their English (L2) definition was the\nlearning material. The participants were asked to do eight writ-\nten vocabulary exercises, in which they had to supply the cor-\nrect form (i.e., to provide synonyms, antonyms, hyponyms, or\nsuperordinates; to match collocations; to fill in the gap in sen-\ntences; to supply the correct item when given a definition) of\nthe target items. Except for the matching exercise, the partici-\npants always had to provide the target item's form. The\nTable 1.

EFL = English as a foreign language.\nDanesh and Farvardin 3\nparticipants' learning was measured via two form recall tests,\nwhich were administered immediately and 2 weeks after the\nexperimental session. The results showed a large effect of rep-\netition and also the durability of repetition effect in form recall\nof target words. Moreover, it was found that collocations were\nmore difficult to learn than single words.\nNowzan and Baryaji (2013) further examined the effective-\nness of a retrieval task on Iranian EFL learners' vocabulary\nlearning. They selected 40 EFL learners at the intermediate\nlevel based on their performance on a preliminary English\nplacement test. Then, a teacher-made vocabulary pretest was\nadministrated to extract participants' unknown words.\nAfterward, the participants were randomly assigned to two\ngroups: experimental and control groups. The experimental\ngroup was taught target words through a retrieval activity that\nconsisted of four steps: learning phase in which a list of target\nwords were presented to the participants with definitions and\nsynonyms; retrieval activity phase, in which participants were\nrequired to retrieve the target words according to clues con-\nsisting of the first letters of target vocabulary; retrieval interval\ntest phase in which participants were asked to provide the syn-\nonym of the target words according to the given clues consist-\ning of first two letters of target words; and posttest phase that\nwas provided for both controlled and experimental groups to\nassess their vocabulary learning. The participants in the con-\ntrol group received the same content without any retrieval\nactivity processes above. Finally, a posttest was given in both\ngroups at the end of the instruction. The results revealed that\nretrieval activity had a significant effect on Iranian EFL learn-\ners' vocabulary learning. It was also concluded that repeated\nretrieval can help vocabulary learning, and it can be helpful\nwhen long-term retention of information is the goal. They also\nsuggested that the act of retrieval can fix items in the memory,\nimprove memory traces, and increase the accessibility of\ninformation in the memory.\nIn the same vein, Goossens, Camp, Verkoeijen, and Tabbers\n(2014) conducted a study on the role of retrieval practice in\nDutch primary school vocabulary learning. To this end, 62\nparticipants were selected from three primary schools; they\nwere required to learn the meaning of 20 target English words.\nThe participants learned the meaning of 10 words, on one\nhand, by retrieval practice in which words and their synonyms\nwere shown for 8 s, and the participants were asked to read\nthem aloud and then try to retrieve their synonyms. The other\n10 words, on the other hand, were taught by restudy in which\nthe participants read the story or list of target words again and\ndid a puzzle book after a 2-min break. After 1 week, learners'\nrecall of the target words was measured. The results revealed\nthat words learned by retrieval practice were statistically\nrecalled better than words learned by restudy.\nRecently, Huang and Lin (2014) introduced a new approach\nto using L1 (Taiwanese) glosses. They agreed that glossing\nfacilitates the creation of correct form\u00admeaning connections\nbut does not encourage inference or retrieval of words' mean-\ning. Thus, they investigated the effects of combining inferring\nand word meaning retrieval on vocabulary learning. One hun-\ndred twenty-four freshmen at the high-intermediate proficiency\nlevel were selected from a university in Taiwan. A reading text\nwas created by combining multiple sources, including three\nonline articles and two articles from CNN English magazine,\nand eight target words judged to be difficult for upper-interme-\ndiate students were selected; each of them appeared 3 times in\nthe reading text. Then, the text was revised to reflect three dif-\nferent glossing conditions (i.e., inference-gloss-gloss, gloss-\nretrieval-gloss, and full glossing). Target words were either\nglossed in Chinese or unglossed depending on the different\nconditions. In the inference-gloss-gloss condition, the partici-\npants inferred the word meaning in the first word encounter and\nwere provided with glosses for the subsequent two word\nencounters; in the gloss-retrieval-gloss condition, the partici-\npants were provided with glosses for the first and last word\nencounters but were expected to retrieve the word meaning in\nthe second word encounter; and in the full glossing condition,\nthe participants were provided with glosses for all the word\nencounters. Participants were assigned randomly in different\nglossing conditions. Immediately after reading the text, they\nreceived a reading comprehension test and an immediate\nvocabulary test, and 2 weeks later, they received delayed\nvocabulary posttest. Results showed that the gloss-retrieval-\ngloss condition was statistically the most effective condition\nfor improving vocabulary learning.\nPrevious studies have examined the effects of textual\nglossing on L2 vocabulary learning and reading comprehen-\nsion. These studies have supported the effectiveness of tex-\ntual glosses in facilitating L2 vocabulary learning. Moreover,\nmost studies have investigated the role of different factors\nsuch as repeating target words in the text (Peters, 2014; Rott,\n2007) and promoting vocabulary recall (Goossens et al.,\nlary learning; however, the role of combining such interven-\ntions has been little examined so far (Huang & Lin, 2014).\nThe present study, therefore, aimed to fill this gap in the lit-\nerature by combining inference, retrieval, and glosses\ntogether in vocabulary learning and examining the effects of\nsuch glossing conditions on vocabulary recall. Thus, the fol-\nlowing research question was addressed:\nResearch Question: Do different glossing conditions\n(such as those investigated here, inference-gloss-gloss,\ngloss-retrieval-gloss, inference-gloss-retrieval-gloss, gloss-\nretrieval-gloss-retrieval, and full glossing) have different\neffects on EFL learners' vocabulary recall?\nMethods\nParticipants\nOne hundred forty (98 female and 42 male) MA students of\nTeaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL) in five intact\nclasses were selected to participate in this study. The reason\n4 SAGE Open\nbehind selecting MAstudents of TEFL was their accessibility.\nThe setting of the present study was Islamic Azad University\nof Ahvaz, Khouzestan, Iran. The participants' ages ranged\nrandomly assigned to one of the five glossing conditions (i.e.,\ninference-gloss-gloss, gloss-retrieval-gloss, inference-gloss-\nretrieval-gloss, gloss-retrieval-gloss-retrieval, and full gloss-\ning) with the same number of participants (n = 28) in each\ngroup.\nInstruments\nVocabulary pretest.To ensure that the target words to be\nglossed were unknown to the participants, a vocabulary pre-\ntest was given to them. The pretest included 20 words\nselected from the reading section of Barron's TOEFL iBT\n(Sharpe, 2010). The participants were required to provide the\nPersian translation of the words. Finally, five words unknown\nto all participants were chosen as the target words.\nReading passage and target words.The reading passage,\n`Thermoregulation', was adopted from Barron's TOEFL\niBT (Sharpe, 2010; see Appendix A). Despite the reading\npassage title, it did not have much technical vocabulary in\nit. This passage was selected based on different criteria:\ndifficulty level, text length, syntactic complexity, and con-\ntent. The reading passage had 784 words (including the\ntitle), six paragraphs, at a Flesch Reading Ease of 42.6 and\nFlesch\u00adKincaid Grade Level of 13 indicating that the pas-\nsage was suitable for the university students (Zamanian &\nHeydari, 2012). The passage was also given to two experi-\nenced EFL professors who taught MA courses, and they\njudged its difficulty appropriate for the participants. Thus,\nit was assumed that the participants were comfortable with\nthe difficulty level of the passage. Five target words,\nincluded three nouns and two verbs, were selected based\non the pretest's results. The five target words were terres-\ntrial, endotherms, blubber, insulation, and vasodilation.\nThe reading passage was modified in a way that each target\nword appeared 3 or 4 times in the reading passage based on\nthe intended glossing condition. Thus, the reading passage\ndiffered in terms of text length, target word occurrences,\nand number of paragraphs in different glossing conditions.\nA target word did not appear twice in the same paragraph.\nEach paragraph appeared on one page to ensure that par-\nticipants could not see the target gloss during inferring or\nretrieval (recall). Moreover, before moving to the next\nparagraph on the next page, the participants were told to\nput the previous paper on the ground and do not return to\nthe previous page.\nGlossing conditions. Target words were boldfaced in the pas-\nsage, and five different L1 (Persian) marginal gloss condi-\ntions were included to investigate whether they had different\neffects on L2 vocabulary recall.\nIn the inference-gloss-gloss condition, each target word\nappeared 3 times in the passage; the participants were\nexpected to infer the meanings of target words (based on\ntheir surrounding sentences) in the first word encounter in\nthe passage; then, target words were glossed in the second\nand the third word occurrence.\nIn the gloss-retrieval-gloss condition, each target word\nappeared 3 times in the passage; they were glossed in the first\nand the third occurrence, but in the second word occurrence,\nthe participants were expected to recall the word's meaning\n(based on the previously seen glosses in the first word\nencounter).\nIn the inference-gloss-retrieval-gloss condition, each tar-\nget word appeared 4 times in the passage; the participants\nwere expected to infer the word's meaning in the first occur-\nrence (based on the context); then the word's meaning was\npresented as a gloss in the second occurrence; in the third\nword's occurrence, the participants were expected to recall\nthe meaning again (based on the previously seen gloss in the\nsecond word encounter). Finally, for the last occurrence of\nthe words, the meaning of target words was presented as a\ngloss (see Appendix B).\nIn the gloss-retrieval-gloss-retrieval condition, each target\nword appeared 4 times in the passage; they were glossed in\nthe first occurrence; then participants were expected to recall\nthe word's meaning in the second occurrence; again, glosses\nwere presented in the third occurrence, and the participants\nwere expected to recall the word's meaning in the last\noccurrence.\nIn the full glossing condition, each target word appeared 3\ntimes in the passage; they were glossed in all occurrences,\nand so no inferencing or recalling had to be done by the\nreaders.\nMultiple-choice reading comprehension test.Immediately fol-\nlowing the reading, the participants were asked to answer a\nreading comprehension test including four multiple-choice\nquestions. For each question, the participants were asked to\nchoose the best answer from the four given choices. The\nquestions were selected from the original reading compre-\nhension test in Barron's TOEFL iBT (Sharpe, 2010).\nVocabulary posttests. The vocabulary posttests consisted of a\nform recall test and a meaning recall test. In cognitive psy-\nchology, recall test is a test of memory in which participants\nare presented with stimuli and then, after a delay, are asked\nto remember as many of the stimuli as possible (Goldstein,\nrecall test, on one hand, required the participants to translate\nL1 (Persian) words into their corresponding L2 (English) tar-\nget words in the passage (see Appendix C). On the other\nhand, the meaning recall test required the participants to\ntranslate the L2 (English) target words into L1 (Persian) (see\nAppendix D). Each test consisted of 10 items, the five target\nwords and five distractors in a mixed order. There were five\nDanesh and Farvardin 5\ntarget items in form recall and five target items in meaning\nrecall posttest. Distractors were neglected in scoring proce-\ndure. A correct answer received 1 point, and incorrect one\nreceived no point. Answers containing minor spelling mis-\ntakes such as \"imediatly\" (instead of \"immediately\") were\nscored as correct.\nProcedures\nThe study was conducted during the participants' regular\nclass times, and it required two sessions. In the first session,\na vocabulary pretest was administered to the participants. In\nthe second session, the participants read a passage and then\nanswered a reading comprehension test and a vocabulary\nposttest. Before the beginning of the study, the reading pas-\nsage was modified to ensure that the participants could not\nsee the glosses during inferring or retrieval.Atarget word did\nnot appear twice in the same paragraph, and once partici-\npants moved on to the next paragraph on the next page, they\ncould not return to the previous one.\nThe different glossing conditions were predefined, and\nthe reading passage was modified for each of the five differ-\nent glossing conditions. The participants were randomly\nassigned to one of the five glossing conditions. Each group\nwas asked to read one passage containing the target words\nthat had been adopted for the glossing conditions they were\nassigned to. The participants were instructed to read for com-\nprehension. After reading the passage, the participants com-\npletedthereadingcomprehensiontestandthenthevocabulary\nposttest. The whole intervention session required approxi-\nmately 30 min. The reading comprehension test was used to\nensure that the participants would not skim through the\npassage.\nData Analysis\nAll scores were recorded in SPSS, Version 21. To answer the\nresearch question, one-way MANOVA was conducted.\nResults\nIn this section, the statistical analyses are described. The dis-\ncussion of the results can be found in a following section.\nResults of Descriptive Statistics\nTable 2 shows the descriptive statistics of the five groups in\ntheir vocabulary form and meaning recall posttests.\nAs shown in Table 2, the study had five groups (n = 28\neach) with different glossing conditions (i.e., inference-\ngloss-gloss, gloss-retrieval-gloss, inference-gloss-retrieval-\ngloss, gloss-retrieval-gloss-retrieval, and full glossing). In\nthe form recall test, the lowest mean score belonged to\nthe full glossing group obtained the highest mean score\nthe form recall test was 3.59, and the total standard devia-\ntion was 1.229. In the meaning recall test, the lowest mean\nscore was related to gloss-retrieval-gloss group (M = 3.57,\nSD = 1.136). However, the gloss-retrieval-gloss-retrieval\ngroup obtained the highest mean score (M = 4.32, SD =\nthe total standard deviation was 0.812. The participants'\noverall mean score was higher in the meaning recall test\nResults of Inferential Statistics\nA one-way between-groups MANOVA was conducted to\ninvestigate the effects of different glossing conditions on\nvocabulary recall. The dependent variables were partici-\npants' scores on form and meaning recall tests. The indepen-\ndent variable was glossing conditions. Table 3 shows the\nresults of Levene's test of equality of variances across all\ngroups.\nAs shown in Table 3, the assumption for between-groups\nhomogeneity of variance across different glossing conditions\nin vocabulary form and meaning recall tests is met as each p\nvalue is greater than .05. Table 4 depicts the multivariate test\nof significance for the immediate posttest. This test indicates\nwhether there are statistically significant differences among\nthe gloss groups on a linear combination of vocabulary form\nand meaning recall tests.\nTable 2.

Table 5 displays the results of MANOVA\non different groups' performance on the form and meaning\nrecall tests.\nability value is less than .05, it can be concluded that results for\nboth vocabulary form and meaning recall immediate posttests\nare significant; thus, gloss conditions had significant effect on\nvocabulary recall. Scheff\u00e9 post hoc tests were used to find\nwhere the specific differences were located. Table 6 presents\nthe results of Scheff\u00e9 post hoc tests on vocabulary tests across\ngloss conditions.\nAs Table 6 shows, for the form recall test, the inference-\ngloss-gloss group outperformed the gloss-retrieval-gloss\nretrieval-gloss group did better than the gloss-retrieval-gloss\nretrieval group surpassed the gloss-retrieval-gloss group (MD\n= -1.46, p = .000).Also, the full glossing group outperformed\ndepicted in Table 5, for the meaning recall test, the inference-\ngloss-retrieval-gloss group did better than the gloss-retrieval-\ngloss-retrieval-gloss-retrieval group surpassed the gloss-\nretrieval-gloss group (MD = -0.75, p = .013). Also, the full\nglossing group outperformed the gloss-retrieval-gloss group\nDiscussion\nForm Recall Test\nThe results of the study revealed that all gloss conditions\nyielded different vocabulary recall scores. According to the\nresults of the form recall test, of the five interventions, the\nfull glossing condition most benefited vocabulary learning,\nfollowed by gloss-retrieval-gloss-retrieval, inference-gloss-\nretrieval-gloss, inference-gloss-gloss, and gloss-retrieval-\ngloss conditions. In addition, the difference between full\nglossing and gloss-retrieval-gloss conditions was significant\n(Table 6).\nThe results obtained for the full glossing condition contra-\ndict Huang and Lin's (2014) contention that repeated encoun-\nters with glosses may not necessarily lead to learners' active\nprocessing of glosses in the margin; their study revealed that\nthe full glossing condition generated the least vocabulary\nlearning in comparison with the other glossing conditions\n(gloss-retrieval-gloss and inference-gloss-gloss conditions).\nIn this study, the full glossing condition outperformed the\nother four glossing conditions on the vocabulary form recall\ntest. This confirms Rott's (2007) claim that repeated encoun-\nters with glosses could offer learners repeated opportunities\nto isolate the glossed word from its surrounding context to\nrehearse the word meanings in their working memory.\nThe results also showed that the gloss-retrieval-gloss-\nretrieval condition was the second best glossing arrangement\nfor a word that occurred in the passage according to the\nvocabulary form recall test. These findings support the claim\nTable 4. Multivariate Test of Immediate Vocabulary Posttests.\nEffect Value F Hypothesis df Error df Significance Partial 2\nDanesh and Farvardin 7\nthat retrieval can play a positive role in enhancing vocabu-\nlary learning (Goossens et al., 2014). Moreover, the gloss-\nretrieval-gloss-retrieval condition's significant mean\ndifference with the gloss-retrieval-gloss condition in the\nform recall test would be related to additional reviewing of\nThe inference-gloss-retrieval-gloss condition served as\nthe third most beneficial glossing condition on the vocabu-\nlary form recall test. The results of this study confirm Rott's\n(2007) claim that repeated visual enhancement itself seems\nto have no effect on extending word processing and vocabu-\nlary learning. Participants might ignore the first contextual\nclues provided in the first condition in the inference-gloss-\nretrieval-gloss condition, as they did not have any back-\nground knowledge about the topic of the reading text or even\nabout the test's goal which was vocabulary learning (Zaid,\n2009). On the other hand, the inference-gloss-retrieval-gloss\ncondition significantly outperformed the gloss-retrieval-\ngloss condition. This could be attributed to the participants'\nincreased attention because of increased target word occur-\nrence and providing a bolded form for the target words.\nAs for the form recall test, the inference-gloss-gloss condi-\ntion was the fourth best intervention condition in this study. It\ngenerated less word learning than the full glossing condition.\nThe lower vocabulary recall in the inference-gloss-gloss con-\ndition than in the full glossing condition could be linked to\nZaid's (2009) assumption that presenting target words with\ncontextual clues should help with inferencing meanings of\nnew items, but it depends heavily on the background knowl-\nedge. Thus, it may not lead to successful meaning guessing,\nwhereas providing the correct word meaning in accordance\nwith context would result in more vocabulary gain.\nVocabulary learning through the inference-gloss-gloss\nand gloss-retrieval-gloss conditions significantly differed\nfrom each other, and the inference-gloss-gloss condition had\na higher mean than the gloss-retrieval-gloss condition. This\nmay relate to the additional contextual clues accompanying\ninference situation in the inference-gloss-gloss condition,\nwhich gave the readers the opportunity to check their\nassumed meaning with the contextual clues.\nOf the five interventions, the gloss-retrieval-gloss condi-\ntion generated the least vocabulary learning in both form\nrecall and meaning recall tests. It was significantly inferior to\nfull glossing condition on the form recall test. Contrary to\nHuang and Lin's (2014) study where the participants had a\nbetter performance on the gloss-retrieval-gloss condition\nthan on the full glossing condition, the participants in this\nstudy focused more on glossed words than unglossed ones\nand relied on the accessible input for vocabulary learning\nthan activating the act of retrieval in the memory.\nMeaning Recall Test\nConcerning the meaning recall test, of the five interventions,\nthe gloss-retrieval-gloss-retrieval condition most benefited\nvocabulary learning, followed by inference-gloss-retrieval-\nTable 6.

This\nfinding supports the claim that retrieval can fix items in the\nmemory, improve the memory traces, and increase the accessi-\nbility of information in the memory (Nowzan & Baryaji, 2013).\nMoreover, it implies that retrieval can strengthen the link\nbetween form and meaning and hence enhance the recall of the\nwords'meaning (Rott, 2007). The involvement load of retrieval\nis assumed to be three because it triggers the need to understand\na word, search for its meaning in the mental lexicon, and evalu-\nation of whether the searched meaning is contextually correct\n(Rott, 2007). In addition, the gloss-retrieval-gloss-retrieval con-\ndition's significant mean difference with the gloss-retrieval-\ngloss condition in the meaning recall test would be related to the\nadditional word encounter's role in activating word processing\nin the mind.\nThe inference-gloss-retrieval-gloss condition performed\nas the second most beneficial glossing condition on the\nmeaning recall test. It was not significantly different from\nthe gloss-retrieval-gloss-retrieval condition (the best inter-\nvention condition on this test), but the existing difference\nwould be related to the presentation of the target word's\nmeaning in the first encounter in the gloss-retrieval-gloss\ncondition, which would increase the reader's attention to the\ntarget word in following word encounters and thus result to\nmore vocabulary gain (Rott, 2007). The inference-gloss-\nretrieval-gloss condition's statistically significant superior-\nity over the gloss-retrieval-gloss condition could arise from\nmore repeated opportunities for target word processing as\nThe full glossing condition served as the third most\nbeneficial gloss type based on meaning recall test scores;\nit outperformed inference-gloss-gloss and gloss-retrieval-\ngloss conditions in the vocabulary meaning recall test. As\nfor the meaning recall test, the inference-gloss-gloss con-\ndition was also the fourth best intervention condition\nfound in the study. The best glossing condition on mean-\ning recall test was the gloss-retrieval-gloss-retrieval con-\ndition, but it was not statistically better than the\ninference-gloss-gloss condition. One possible reason may\nbe due to the increased frequency of the target words in\nthe gloss-retrieval-gloss-retrieval condition compared\nwith the inference-gloss-gloss condition (Peters, 2014).\nOn this meaning recall test, the gloss-retrieval-gloss-\nretrieval condition showed the highest vocabulary learn-\ning results, and it significantly outperformed the\ngloss-retrieval-gloss condition. According to Barcroft\n(2015), providing opportunities for target word retrieval\ncan positively affect incidental L2 vocabulary learning,\none additional recall chance in the gloss-retrieval-gloss-\nretrieval condition would be the reason of gloss-retrieval-\ngloss-retrieval group's outperformance.\nConclusion\nFew studies on L2 learning have examined textual glosses\nin combination with meaning inferencing and retrieval as\nglossing condition models. This study focused on this\nissue by comparing five glossing conditions in their effects\non L2 vocabulary recall. The results of the study suggested\nthat full glossing was the best intervention condition for\nvocabulary form recall, and it was more effective than the\nother four conditions in promoting L2 vocabulary learning.\nThe gloss-retrieval-gloss-retrieval condition was the best\nintervention condition for vocabulary meaning recall, and\nit was more effective than inference-gloss-retrieval-gloss,\nfull glossing, inference-gloss-gloss, and gloss-retrieval-\ngloss conditions in promoting recalling the target words'\nmeaning. This study provides much-needed information\non the effects of different glossing conditions on L2 vocab-\nulary learning. By comparing five glossing conditions\ntogether, it sheds light on the use of different glossing con-\nditions for L2 vocabulary learning.\nThe findings of the present study are subject to a num-\nber of limitations. The participants were MA students of\nTEFL, selected from a university where all instruction is\ndone in English; accordingly, it is uncertain whether the\nfindings can be readily applied to other students at a differ-\nent educational level with different levels of language\nknowledge/proficiency. The difficulty of inferring each\ntarget word in the study might be different, so presenting\nthese words in different contexts or conducting the research\non different target words might generate different results.\nAs only five target words were included in the passage,\nchoosing a text with different lexical coverage may pro-\nduce different results.\nFuture studies could be carried out to explore the effects\nof these glossing conditions on the non-English major stu-\ndents at the tertiary level. Moreover, this study only investi-\ngated words that occurred 3 or 4 times in the text; other\nstudies could investigate words that occur less or more than\n3 or 4 times to determine whether other glossing conditions\ncan lead to more vocabulary learning.\nAppendix A\nThe Original Reading Passage\nThermoregulation. Mammals and birds generally maintain\nbody temperature within a narrow range (36 \u00b0C-38 \u00b0C for\nmost birds) that is usually considerably warmer than the\nenvironment. Because heat always flows from a warm\nobject to cooler surroundings, birds and mammals must\ncounteract the constant heat loss. This maintenance of\nwarm body temperature depends on several key adapta-\ntions. The most basic mechanism is the high metabolic\nrate of endothermy itself. Endotherms can produce large\namounts of metabolic heat that replace the flow of heat to\nDanesh and Farvardin 9\nthe environment, and they can vary heat production to\nmuch changing rates of heat loss. Heat production is\nincreased by such muscles activity as moving or shiver-\ning. In some mammals, certain hormones can cause\nmitochondria to increase their metabolic activity and\nproduce heat instead of ATP (energy that drives certain\nreactions in cells). This nonshivering thermogenesis\n(NST) takes place throughout the body, but some mam-\nmals also have a tissue called brown fat in the neck and\nbetween the shoulders that is specialized for rapid heat\nproduction. Through shivering and NST, mammals and\nbirds in cold environments can increase their metabolic\nheat production by as much as 5 to 10 times above the\nminimal levels those occur in warm conditions.\nAnother major thermoregulatory adaptation that\nevolved in mammals and birds is insulation (hair, feath-\ners, and fat layers that prevent transfer of heat), which\nreduces the flow of heat and lowers the energy cost of\nkeeping warm. Most land mammals and birds react to\ncold by raising their fur or feathers, thereby trapping a\nthicker layer of air. Humans rely more on a layer of fat\njust beneath the skin; goose bumps are a vestige of hair-\nraising left over from our furry ancestors. Vasodilation\nand vasoconstriction also regulate heat exchange and\nmay contribute to regional temperature differences within\nthe animal. For example, heat loss from a human is\nreduced when arms and legs cool to several degrees\nbelow the temperature of body core, where most vital\norgans are located.\nHair loses most of its insulation power when wet.\nMarine mammals such as whales and seals have a very\nthick layer of fat called blubber just under the skin.\nThese mammals swim in water colder than their body\ncore temperature, and many species spend at least part of\nthe year in nearly freezing polar seas. The loss of heat to\nwater occurs 50 to 100 times more rapidly than heat loss\nto air, and the skin temperature of a marine mammal is\nclose to water temperature. Even so, the blubber insula-\ntion is so effective that marine mammals maintain body\ncore temperatures of about 36 \u00b0C to 38 \u00b0C with meta-\nbolic rates about the same as those of land mammals of\nsimilar size. The flippers or tail of a whale or seal lack\nblubber, but countercurrent heat exchangers greatly\nreduce heat loss in these extremities, as they do in the\nlegs of many birds.\nThrough metabolic heat production, insulation, and vas-\ncular adjustments, birds and mammals are capable of aston-\nishing feats of thermoregulation. For example, small birds\ncalled chickadees, which weigh only 20 g, can remain active\nand hold body temperature nearly constant at 40 \u00b0C in envi-\nronmental temperatures as low as -40 \u00b0C--as long as they\nhave enough food to supply the large amount of energy nec-\nessary for heat production.\nMany mammals and birds live in places where thermo-\nregulation requires cooling off as well as warming. For\nexample, when a marine mammal moves into warm seas, as\nmany whales do when they reproduce, excess metabolic\nheat is removed by vasodilation of numerous blood vessels\nin the outer layer of the skin. In hot climates or when vigor-\nous exercise adds large amounts of metabolic heat in the\nbody, many terrestrial mammals and birds may allow body\ntemperature to rise by several degrees, which enhances heat\nloss by increasing the temperature gradient between the\nbody and a warm environment.\nEvaporative cooling often plays a key role in dissipat-\ning the body heat. If environmental temperature is above\nbody temperature, animals gain heat from the environ-\nment as well as from metabolism, and evaporation is the\nonly way to keep body temperature from rising rapidly.\nPanting is important in birds and many mammals. Some\nbirds have a pouch richly supplied with blood vessels in\nthe floor of the mouth; fluttering the pouch increases\nevaporation. Pigeons can use evaporative cooling to keep\nbody temperature close to 40 \u00b0C in air temperature as high\nas 60 \u00b0C, as long as they have sufficient water. Many ter-\nrestrial mammals have sweat glands controlled by the ner-\nvous system. Other mechanisms that promote evaporative\ncooling include spreading saliva on body surfaces, an\nadaptation of some kangaroos and rodents for combating\nsevere heat stress. Some bats use both saliva and urine to\nenhance evaporative cooling.\nAppendix B\nInference-Gloss-Retrieval-Gloss Condition\nAppendix C\nForm Recall Test\nPlease recall the English words that have the following\nPersian meanings in the reading and write them down:\nAppendix D\nMeaning Recall Test\nPlease translate the following words into Persian based on\ntheir meaning in the reading:\n1.
