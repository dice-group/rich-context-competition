For\neuro coins \u00ad in contrast to banknotes \u00ad it is relatively easy to distinguish the coins\nissued by the individual euro area countries, owing to their unique national side. The\nintroduction of euro coins offered the unique opportunity to analyse the cross \u00ad border\nmigration of coins.\nThe present paper analyses how many euro coins outflow from Germany and which\ncomposition of coins is to be expected in the long run. The flow of coins depends on the\nintensity of foreign travel and has consequences for the countries' seigniorage.\nThe paper exemplifies the mixing process with 1 coins. For those coins, consistent data\nfrom the online survey projects \"Eurodiff\" and \"Euromobil\" are available. Accordingly,\nsince their introduction until the end of 2008, the share of German 1 coins in Germany\ndropped to about 75%. We explain the flow of coins between Germany and the other\neuro area countries by a simple dynamic model. The parameters of that model, outflow\nrates and inflow rates, are calibrated based on actual empirical data. The results depend\non whether the total stock of coins is constant or growing over time. Assuming that the\ntotal stock of 1 coins is constant, the model predicts that the ratio of German coins in\nGermany to the coins issued by Germany would drop to merely 22% in the long run.\nEmpirically, however, since their introduction, the stock of euro coins was growing\nevery year, which slowed down the process of coin mixing. Extrapolating the growth\nrates observed in the past, the model predicts a decline of the share of German coins in\nGermany to 53%. Using an alternative model based on a Markov approach to explain\nthe coin mixing yields the same results.\nNicht technische Zusammenfassung\nSeit dem 1.

While, to the untrained\neye, it is difficult to distinguish between the banknotes issued by the individual euro-\narea countries, distinguishing between the various euro-area coins is relatively simple\nowing to their unique national side. As people can clearly see in their everyday cash\ntransactions, the national euro coins have become mixed over time. Nevertheless, it is\ndifficult to find any reliable data on the intensity of the cross-border flow of coins. The\nintroduction of euro coins did, however, present the unique opportunity to analyse the\ncross-border migration of euro coins and the mixing of coins in the various euro-area\ncountries.\nThere are a number of projects being carried out at universities relating to this\ncoin diffusion process. For example, the French project is based on representative\nsurveys (Grasland et al., 2002), whereas the other projects are based largely on\nvoluntary reporting. Examples of the latter are the \"Euromobil\" and \"Eurodiff\" projects\n\"Eurotracer\", which also includes the migration of banknotes, and \"Eurodiffusie\" in the\nalgorithm and data on travel statistics to try to determine when 50% of the coins\ncirculating in a country are of foreign origin. Furthermore, since 2002, the European\nCommission has been taking random samples of coins from major towns and cities at\nirregular intervals to gather data on the coin mixing process. All of these studies are\nfocused on establishing either the (net) number of foreign euro coins flowing into a\n* We thank N. Bartzsch, H. Herrmann and G.

This is also true in the\neuro area where the different member countries have the right to determine the amounts\nof coins to be issued. In Germany, this has to be done in coordination with the Deutsche\nBundesbank. Furthermore, the amounts have to be approved by the European Central\nBank for one year in advance. Except this approval, there is no upper limit to the\nissuance process. However, according to the EU Treaty, the maximum amount of coins\nin the stocks of the national central banks to be credited to the government must not\nexceed 10% of the total issue of the respective country. Therefore, if the cross-border\ncoin flows are not symmetric or national coin demands differ, this may have\nconsequences for the seigniorage revenues of the different countries.\nIn the following, we will focus on the \"indirect\" calculation of the flow variable\nwhich is behind the mixing process. For that purpose, we will apply a simple theoretical\nmodel to determine how many euro coins flow into other euro-area countries. Following\non from this, we are going to calculate the number of coins to be expected in the long\nterm. We will confine our calculation to Germany and 1 coins.3 For this case,\nconsistent data from the \"Euromobil\" and \"Eurodiff\" projects are available. Section 2\nbelow explains the formal models and results and also puts forward an alternative\napproach. We will then discuss the results in section 3. Section 4 summarises and draws\nsome conclusions.\n2 For different seigniorage concepts see Baltensperger and Jordan (1997).\n3 In the case of the smaller-denomination euro cent coins, the results would certainly be distorted owing\nto a considerable amount of lost coins, whereas in the case of 2 coins, special-issue coins would have\nto be considered as well. In the US, it was even observed up until recently that the demand for coins\nwent up perceptibly in the wake of surging commodity prices, creating an incentive to melt coins\n(Velde, 2007). Melting has since been prohibited by the US Treasury and does not seem to be an issue\nfor euro coins owing to their different metallic composition.\n2 The model\n2.1 Constant volume of coins\nIn the following, ( )\nt\nN\nDD\ndenotes the number of German 1 coins in Germany and\n( )\nt\nN\nDA\nthe number of German 1 coins abroad, both at time t. In this section, we\nassume that the total number of German 1 coins D\nN and the total number of foreign\nN remain constant. Thus, the inflow of coins to Germany and the outflow of\ncoins from Germany cancel each other out. As Deutsche Bundesbank (2003, 208f.)\nnotes, there is little to suggest that, despite a traditional foreign travel account deficit,\nGermany will encounter a net outflow of euro coins. Provided we are concerned with\ncoins for transaction purposes, it can be assumed that tourists take a similar amount of\ncoins with them when travelling both from and to their home country.\nAt time t, the German coins are either still in Germany (NDD\n(t)) or have migrated\nabroad (NDA\n(t)):\n(1) ( ) ( )\nN t N t N\n+ = .\nAs a result of foreign travel (tourism, business trips) a certain amount of German\n1 coins drifts to other countries. We assume that this amount is proportional to the\nvolume at the start of the period: NDD\n(t-1). Conversely, coins also flow from other\neuro-area countries to Germany. This includes German coins which already drifted\nabroad in previous periods. Here, too, we assume that this amount is proportional to the\nnumber of coins abroad at the beginning of the period: \u00dfNDA\n(t-1). This results in the\nfollowing dynamic equation for the number of German 1 coins in Germany:\nN t N t N t N t\n \n= - - - + - .\nSince we are primarily concerned with the share of German coins in Germany\n(3) ( ) ( ) /\nn t N t N\n ,\nusing (1) and (3), equation (2) is reformulated as follows:\nn t n t\n  \n= + - - - .\nAt the time of the first issue, all German coins were located in Germany.\nTherefore, the starting value is (0) 1\nDD\nn = . In the long run, the share of German coins in\nGermany converges towards\nDD\nn\n\n \n=\n+\n.\nIf no outflow occurs ( = 0), the share of German coins in Germany remains at\nDD\nn = . Conversely, if no backflow occurs (\u00df = 0), all German 1 coins will, in the\nlong run, migrate abroad *\nDD\nn = . Together, (4) and (5) yield an equation for the\nevolution of coin shares over time :\nt\nn t n n\n \n= + - - - .\n(6) shows a dynamic adjustment process whereby the share of German coins in\nGermany decreases monotonically and converges towards the equilibrium value *\n( )\nDD\nn .\nThe larger the outflow rate () and the backflow rate (\u00df), the quicker the coins are\nmixed.\nAn equivalent equation can also be derived for the share of foreign 1 coins\nabroad (nAA):\nt\nn t n n\n \n= + - - - , where *\nAA\nn\n\n \n=\n+\n.\nIn order to determine the flow rates  and , we take the number of 1 coins in\ncirculation in the euro area at the end of 2008 (t = 7) of around 6,000 million (see table\n1 coins.4 Statistical research carried out by Stoyan suggests that, at the end of 2008,\n75% of all German 1 coins were located in Germany (nDD = 75%), which is equivalent\nto 1,005 million coins, as around 25% of all the 1 coins observed in Germany at that\ntime were of foreign origin.5 This would mean that a total of 335 million coins have\nalready migrated abroad. This is equivalent to around 48 million coins per year, or\n4 In statistical terms, this corresponds to approximately 16 1 coins per capita of the German population\nand approximately 20 1 coins per capita in the rest of the euro area.\n5 See http://www.mathe.tu-freiberg.de/Stoyan/euro/en/euro.html\n131,000 coins per day. As the same amount of foreign 1 coins have also flowed to\nGermany, this implies that the share of foreign coins still abroad is nAA = 92.8%.\nTable 1 Coin volumes\n(in millions)\nIn Germany Abroad Total\nGerman coins NDD\nForeign coins NAD\nTotal ND\nSource: Deutsche Bundesbank, European Central Bank and Stoyan (see footnote 5)\nThese data can be used to empirically calibrate the flow rates  and  by solving\nequations (6) and (7) for  and  at t = 7. This yields ^\n \n= = .\nAccording to these estimates, per year 4.2% of German 1 coins flow to other countries,\nand 1.2% of foreign 1 coins flow to Germany. These estimates reflect the unequal\nnumber of issued coins in Germany compared to other EMU countries. Thus, the share\nof German coins in Germany, which currently stands at 75%, would fall to\nDD\nn = in the long run, whereas the share of foreign coins abroad would decline\nAA\nn = . This means that a perfect mixture of coins\nwould have been achieved as these shares correspond to the percentages of issued 1\ncoins. The key factors in this result are the unequal amounts of German and foreign 1\ncoins issued and the assumption that the total number of coins (ND\n, NA\n) does not grow.\n2.2 Growing volumes of coins\nOne of the fundamental assumptions in the above model, the constancy of the\ntotal number of coins A\nN and D\nN , is too restrictive and needs to be modified. Indeed,\nthe number of coins in circulation has increased since the euro was introduced, with the\nannually and the number of foreign 1 coins issued by as much as 10% per year.6 The\n6 The latter figure may be slightly overstated because it includes the new euro area members Slowenia,\nMalta and Cyprus.\nincrease in the number of coins in circulation affects the coin mixing process: the more\ncoins are newly circulated each year, the more slowly the coins become mixed. In order\nto take account of the effect of the increase in the volume of coins on the coin mixing\nprocess, we modify equation (2) as follows:\nN t N t N t N t g N t\n \n= - - - + - + - .\nFor the sake of simplification, we assume that the annual growth rate (gD) of German 1\ncoins remains constant. The last term in (8) is the quantitative increase of German 1\ncoins. Dividing (8) on both sides by ND\n(t-1), and using the definition\n( ) ( ) / ( )\nn t N t N t\n for the ratio of German coins in Germany to the total number of\ncoins issued by Germany, yields\nD\n\u00df g\nn t n t\ng g\n \n+ - -\n= + -\n+ +\n.\nNeglecting growth (gD\n=0) results in (4) as a special case. In the long run, the share of\nGerman coins in Germany converges towards:\nDD\nD\ng\nn\ng\n\n \n+\n=\n+ +\n.\nFor the share of German coins abroad, this gives us:\n= - =\n+ +\nD\nn n\ng\n\n \n.\nThese two shares depend on the flow rates  and  and on the growth rate gD.\nThe\nsmaller the flow rate () and the greater the backflow rate (\u00df) as well as the growth rate\nof German coins (gD\n)\n,\nthe greater is the share of German coins that will remain in\nGermany in the long run (and therefore the smaller the share of German coins abroad).\nThis yields the following dynamic equation for the share of German coins in Germany:\nt\nD\nn t n n\ng\n \n \n- -\n= + -\n \n+\n \n.\nIn turn, an analogous equation applies to the number of foreign coins in\ncirculation abroad:\nt\nA\nn t n n\ng\n \n \n- -\n= + -\n \n+\n \n, where * A\nAA\nA\ng\nn\ng\n\n \n+\n=\n+ +\n.\nOnce more, we revert to the \"observed\" coin volumes at the end of 2008 given in\nTable 1, now reflecting both, the original issue and the subsequent growth of coins. We\nuse the average growth rates gD = 4% and gA = 10% and for t = 7 (end of 2008) we\nagain set nDD = 75% and nAA = 92.8%. The flow rates  and  can be empirically\ncalibrated from equations (11) and (12). This yields ^\n \n= = . Not\nsurprisingly, the estimated flow rates with growth (5.0% and 1.8%) are larger than those\nobtained assuming constant volumes: When more coins are issued, the chance of a\nspecific coin to flow abroad falls, requiring higher flow rates to obtain the mixing given\nin Table 1.\nIf the above growth rates in the number of coins in circulation also hold in the\nfuture, the share of German coins in Germany would only fall to * 53.3%\nDD\nn = in the\nlong run (and not to 22.3% as in the case with constant volumes). Alternatively,\n=\nDD\nn . The share of\nforeign coins abroad would decline merely to * 89.5%\nAA\nn = . According to this\nestimation, in the long run, about one in two 1 coins issued in Germany is likely to stay\nin Germany. Figure 1 shows the forecasted share of German 1 coins in Germany for\nboth cases, i.e. without growth and assuming a growth rate of 4% which was recorded\nsince the introduction of euro coins in 2002.\nFigure 1: Share of German coins in Germany\nSo far, we focused on the ratio of German 1 coins in Germany to the total number of\n1 coins issued by Germany (nDD\n(t)). This ratio converges to a well defined equilibrium\n*\nDD\n( n ) and the same holds for the ratio of foreign 1 coins to the total number of coins\nissued abroad *\nAA\n( n ). However, with different growth rates, what happens to the ratio of\nGerman coins in Germany to the number of coins circulating in Germany?\nWith coin volumes growing at constant but different (positive) rates, the ratio of 1\ncoins issued abroad to those issued by Germany,\n \n+\n  =  \n+\n \nt\nN (t ) N (O ) g\n(t )\nN (t ) N (O ) g\n,\nconverges to a constant in the long run only for gA\n= gD\n. If gA\n> gD\n(gA\n< gD\n), the ratio\ntends to infinity (zero). This has important consequences for the ratio of German 1\ncoins in Germany to the total number of coins circulating in Germany:\nDD\nDD\nN (t ) N (t )\nh (t )\nN (t ) N (t ) N (t ) N (t ) N (t )\nn (t )\nn (t ) [ n (t )] (t )\n =\n+ + -\n=\n+ - \nThus, if gA\n gD\n. hDD\n(t) is different from nDD\n(t) and it either converges towards zero or\ntowards one (and not to *\nDD\nn ). Hence, if the growth rates of coins issued in Germany\nand abroad are different, German coins in Germany eventually relatively disappear or\ndominate.7 Figure 2 shows the development of German coins in Germany, both, as a\nratio of coins issued by Germany (nDD\n(t)) and as a ratio of coins circulating in Germany\n(hDD\n(t)), calculated for the growth rates gD = 4% and gA = 10%. With the ratio of\nGerman coins circulating in Germany converging towards zero (and the ratio of foreign\ncoins circulating abroad converging towards one), this graph suggests that substantially\ndifferent growth rates of euro coins are likely to be unsustainable in the long run.\nFigure 2: Share of German coins in Germany (nDD, hDD)\n7 Under conditions of balanced growth (gD\n=gA\n=g), hDD\n(t)=nDD\n(t) holds.\n2.3 A Markov chain approach\nAlternatively, using a Markov chain, the coin mixing process can be examined\nwithin one closed approach. To this end, we define the matrix of the number of coins as\n( ) ( )\n( )\n( ) ( )\nN t N t\nM t\nN t N t\n \n=  \n \nand assume the following matrix of transition probabilities\nZ\n\u00df \u00df\n \n-\n \n=  \n-\n \n,\nwhere  denotes the probability that a 1 coin located in Germany will drift abroad over\na given period (and 1- the probability that the coin will remain in Germany).\nFurthermore, \u00df denotes the probability that a coin located abroad will migrate to\nGermany. The exogenous growth in the number of coins is given by\n= - + -\nN t N t N t G , with\n \n=  \n \nD\nA\ng\nG\ng\nand\nD\nA\nN\nN\n \n= =  \n \n.\nThus, the dynamic process of coin circulation reads as\n= - + -\nM t M t Z N t G .\nIf, at t = 7 (end of 2008), we take the distribution of coins specified in table 1\nM\n \n=  \n \nand the average growth rates gD = 4% and gA = 10% observed in the past, we can use\nequation (15) to empirically calibrate the transition probabilities. This results in\n^\n \n= = . Thus, the probability that a 1 coin located in Germany\nwill flow abroad in the course of one year is 5%, and the probability that a coin located\nabroad will flow to Germany 1.8%. These values exactly match the flow rates that were\ncalculated in section 2.2.\n3 Discussion of the results: plausibility and robustness checks\nAccording to information from Fraport AG, 7.2 million passengers from other\neuro-area countries landed at Frankfurt International Airport in 2007. This amounts\nstatistically to around 20,000 passengers per day. Frankfurt is the biggest German\nairport which handles around one-third of all air passengers in Germany. Moreover,\nother means of transport are also used. And commuters travelling to and from Germany\non a daily basis also have to be taken into account. In 2006, a (net) daily average of\n90,000 persons commuted to Germany. The majority of these are likely to have\noriginated from other euro-area countries, primarily Austria and the Netherlands\nper day - do not seem to be unrealistic.\nBased on a small, yet non-representative, sample of 2,000 coins taken in Frankfurt\nam Main, the European Commission calculated that, for the year 2007, approximately\n13% of the 1 coins in circulation in Germany were of foreign origin. This was a\nsignificant decline compared with the samples taken in previous years, when, in some\ncases, the share of foreign 1 coins in circulation in Germany was over 50%. Therefore,\nthis figure is likely to have a severe downward bias. Furthermore, the results of this kind\nof random sampling vary substantially depending on the time of year and the place\nwhere the samples were taken. If we were to set =\nDD\ngrowth scenario would yield ^\n \n= = . Positive growth rates\n \n= = . In the former scenario, the\nlong-term coin volumes would converge to 22.3%, yet would settle at 38.7% in the\nlatter scenario.\nIf we assume that growth in the number of coins in Germany and abroad is 5%\n(gD=gA=0.05), the number of German coins that would migrate from Germany each year\nwould be 5.20%, and 1.49% of German coins located abroad would return to Germany.\nThe implied long-term equilibrium values of the coin shares would then be *\nDD\nn =\nAA\nn = 87.2%. Again, the German share would not fall below 50%.\nEquations (6) and (11) can also be used to estimate how the mixing process will\ndevelop over time. Larger values would simply have to be used for t . At 14\n=\nt (in\n2015) and assuming constant volumes, this would result in ( )\nn = , i.e. the share\nof German coins at the end of 2015 would be approximately 58%. The share of foreign\n1 coins in Germany is expected to reach the 50% threshold around 2020. This contrasts\nsignificantly with figures calculated by Bergman et al., who \u00ad based on 2002 knowledge\n\u00ad do not expect a 50% mixing of coins until the year 2040. These different results are\nespecially due to the assumption as to how high the volumes of German coins in\nGermany are at the starting point.\nOur analysis is flexible enough to be adapted when new countries join the euro\narea. We would only need to adjust the flow rates  and , with the other calculations\nleft unchanged.\n4 Summary and conclusions\nBy means of a simple model, we have tried to capture the mixing process of euro\ncoins and to determine the share of German euro coins in Germany. The model was\ncalibrated using data on 1 coins in Germany. This approach allows the above values to\nbe determined indirectly. According to our calculations, a total of between 4% and 5%\nof German coins are likely to flow abroad each year. We believe that the most plausible\nvalue for the long-term share of German 1 coins in Germany is likely to be around\n50%. The present analysis can be easily extended to other euro-area countries, provided\nthat the required data (on, for instance, the number of foreign coins at a given point in\ntime) are available.\nThe derived results are conditional on two assumptions: the growth rates of the\nnumber of German and foreign coins and the number of German coins in Germany at a\ngiven point in time. In this context, the plausibility of the various growth scenarios\nwould need to be examined. Although, at a first glance, the positive growth scenario\nappears to be more plausible, it does, however, present the problem that people would\nhave to walk around with increasingly large amounts of coins in their pockets.8 This\nwould probably lead to a decline in demand or to a replacement of the smaller-\ndenomination coins by issuing a greater amount of larger-denomination coins or even a\n8 Alternative scenarios include the loss or hoarding/collecting of a growing number of coins.\nchangeover to banknotes. Thus, from an economic standpoint, the assumption that, in\nthe very long term, national coin volumes will remain constant with an unchanged\ndenomination structure is not implausible. Nevertheless, this may take a very long time\nto unfold, which means that, during a transitional period, it would make sense to work\nwith positive growth rates. In any case, the effects of an increase in foreign travel would\nalso have to be taken into account. This would entail an increase in the cross-border\ncountries went up by an annual average of 4%-5%.\nAnother interesting route would be to abandon some of our simplifying\nassumptions and to review the sensitivity of the results accordingly. There are, for\nexample, repercussions on the mints and on seigniorage in those countries which record\na net outflow of coins.9 These countries would benefit, as they would issue more coins\nthan are actually required in their country. In the first few years following the\nintroduction of euro coins, the mixing process is also likely to have been influenced by\ncollectors of euro coins in the individual euro-area countries. This influence is likely to\ndiminish over time. Nevertheless, this process will be relaunched from time to time\nwhenever new members join the euro area. The cross-border flow of coins and\ncollection activities could lead to growing uncertainty when forecasting coin demand\n(Croushore and Stark, 2002). These issues should be the subject of future research.\n9 Historically, this kind of situation occurred time and time again and, in some cases, led to a coin\nshortage. A common response to this in the past was to impose a ban on coin exports. A theoretical\nanalysis of this relationship can be found in Wallace and Zhou (1997).\nReferences\nBaltensperger, E. and T.J.
