It\nseriously affects the activities of daily\nliving and often leads to disability.1 At pre-\nsent, joint replacement is the most effective\ntreatment for OA; no other method is effec-\ntive to improve subchondral bone and car-\ntilage structure.2 The majority of treatments\nare symptomatic, being designed to relieve\npain, but they do not stop or delay disease\nprogression, so ultimately, many patients\nrequire artificial joint replacement surgery.\nTherefore, early diagnosis of OA and accu-\nrate prediction of disease development is\nextremely important.\nWith the rapid development of molecu-\nlar biology, considerable research has been\nundertaken in the evaluation of biochemical\nmarkers for the early diagnosis of knee OA\nand disease prediction. To date, markers of\ncartilage metabolism, C-telopeptide of type\nII collagen (CTX-II)3\u00ad5 and type X collagen\n(ColX),6 have been identified. These\nmarkers are important for medical and\npharmaceutical research. CTX-II is a spe-\ncific degradation product of cartilage colla-\ngen type II catabolism that can be released\ninto the blood.7Research has found that\npatients with hip OA exhibit significantly\nincreased urine CTX-II levels than do\nhealthy individuals; and patients with\nrapid OA progression presented with urine\nCTX-II levels that were significantly higher\nthan those of patients with slow progres-\nsion.8 In addition, CTX-II was associated\nwith radiographic OA progression in dis-\neased knee and hip joints.9,10 The specific\nexpression of ColX in OA has attracted\nconsiderable attention from researchers in\nthis field as another potential serum bio-\nmarker for cartilage degradation.6 ColX,\na non-fibrillar collagen consisting of three\nidentical alpha 1 chains transcribed from\nthe COL10A1 gene, is a well-established\nmarker for hypertrophic chondrocyte dif-\nferentiation.11 Research has demonstrated\nthat ColX mRNA and protein levels are\nsignificantly increased in patients with\nOA.12 ColX is also a specific marker of\nThis evidence supports the theory that\nColX might have potential as a specific\ndiagnostic biochemical marker for OA.11\u00ad16\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is\nbeing increasingly used for the accurate\nevaluation of articular cartilage injury.\nLongitudinal and cross-sectional studies of\nknee OA have confirmed notable sensitivity\nand accuracy when using quantitative MRI\nanalysis of structural joint changes.17,18\nLong-term structural changes and associat-\ned morphological changes in knee OA can\nbe accurately assessed via an OA model\nthrough quantitative analysis using MRI\nsoftware.\nThis current longitudinal study aimed to\nevaluate the combined diagnostic value of\nthe serum levels of two biochemical\nmarkers (CTX-II and ColX) and the quan-\ntitative evaluation of tibial plateau cartilage\nvolume using MRI software in an anterior\ncruciate ligament transection (ACLT)\nanimal model of OA.\nMaterials and methods\nAnimal model induction\nThis longitudinal animal study was con-\nducted in the Department of Joint\nSurgery, First Affiliated Hospital of\nXinjiang Medical University, Urumqi,\nChina and it was approved by the Ethics\nCommittee of Xinjiang Medical University\nstrict accordance with the regulations out-\nlined by the Animal Protection Committee.\nAll procedures complied with the guidelines\nof the Association for Assessment and\nAccreditation of Laboratory Animal Care,\nand the protocol was approved by the\nInstitutional Animal Care and Use\nCommittee of the First Affiliated Hospital\nof Xinjiang Medical University (protocol\nA total of 18 male Beagle dogs, aged\nused in the study. The dogs were weighed\nand organised into increasing weight order\nfrom 1 to 18. They were then randomly\nassigned to either the experimental\n(n \u00bc 10) or control group (n \u00bc 8) using a\nrandom number table. The animals were\nwith free access to water and food. In the\nexperimental group, the 10 randomly\nassigned dogs underwent ACLT of the\nright knee joint under general anaesthesia\nfollowing induction of anaesthesia using\nan intramuscular injection of ZoletilV\n(0.5 ml/kg) mixed with Su-Mian-Xin\n(0.5 ml/kg) as described in brief here.\nAs dogs have spontaneous breathing,\nthere was no need for mechanical ventila-\ntion during surgery. Intravenous antibiotics\nwere administered to prevent infection.\nAlong the medial patella skin incision, the\nsubcutaneous tissue was opened, and the\ncapsule and fat pad were fully exposed in\norder to cut the anterior cruciate ligament\n(ACL) (Figure 1). Close attention was paid\nto ensure no damage was caused to the sur-\nrounding tissue when the ACL was cut.\nA medial lateral stress test and drawer test\nwere performed and the success of the\nACLT was confirmed by a positive result.\nThe articular capsule, subcutaneous tissue\nand the skin were sutured layer-by-layer,\npaying attention to haemostasis. A further\nFigure 1. Beagle dogs underwent unilateral anterior cruciate ligament transection in order to induce\nosteoarthritis in the right knee joint.

Sham\nsurgery involved opening the knee joint\ncapsule, fully exposing the ACL without\nany treatment, and closing the joint capsule\nbefore suturing the subcutaneous tissue and\nthe skin. Oxygen saturation, blood pres-\nsure, and heart rate were continuously\nmonitored during surgery. Postoperative\nfollow-up was performed to determine\nwhether infection or gastrointestinal com-\nplications occurred. Following surgery, the\ntwo groups of dogs underwent the same\nforced twice daily walk (1 h each time) for\nBiochemical marker measurements\nAt different time-points after surgery,\nvenous blood samples (approximately 5\nml) were collected from the necks of all\ndogs. The blood samples were labelled, set\naside for 1 h, and then centrifuged at room\n1-15K centrifuge (Sigma Laborzentrifugen\nGmbH, Osterode am Harz, Germany)\nprior to the storage of serum at \u00ad80\u00b0C.\nSerum levels of CTX-II and ColX were\ndetermined using enzyme-linked immuno-\nsorbent assay (ELISA) kits following the\nmanufacturer's instructions (Canine CTX-\nKit; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN,\nUSA). In brief, the microplates provided\nby these kits were precoated with anti-\ncanine CTX-II- and ColX-specific antibod-\nies. Using a purified polyclonal antibody to\nthe coat the microtiter plate wells, a solid-\nphase antibody was used, then the biochem-\nical marker was added to the wells and\ncombined with a horseradish peroxidase\n(HRP)-labelled polyclonal antibody. This\nformed an antibody-antigen-enzyme-\nantibody complex that, after washing\ncompletely, was supplemented with\nsolution that became blue as the HRP\nenzyme catalysed the reaction. The reaction\nwas terminated by the addition of a sulphu-\nric acid solution and the colour change was\nmeasured spectrophotometrically at a\nwavelength of 450 nm using a full wave-\nlength Benchmark Plus microplate reader\n(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The con-\ncentration of the two biochemical markers\nin the serum samples was determined by\ncomparing the optical density of the sam-\nples to the standard curve. The minimum\ndetectable concentrations were 6ng/ml for\nCTX-II and 0.1 pg/ml for ColX. Intra-\nand interassay coefficients of variation\nfor all ELISAs were<9% and <11%,\nrespectively.\nMRI protocol and image processing\nHigh resolution MRI using a wrist coil and\na Siemens 1.5 T scanner (MAGNETOMV\nR\nAvanto 1.5T; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany)\nwas undertaken preoperatively and at post-\noperative weeks 4, 8 and 16 to examine the\nright knee joints. After checking the stan-\ndard equipment used, the dog was placed in\nthe supine position, the right leg was\nstretched and fixed, and the knee joint was\nplaced in the wrist circle for scanning. In\naddition, a cushion was used to assist the\ndog in maintaining the supine position and\nthe right hind leg in a slightly internal rota-\ntion hold. MRI was undertaken under gen-\neral anaesthesia using ZoletilV\nkg) mixed with Su-Mian-Xin (0.5 ml/kg).\nAs dogs have spontaneous breathing,\nthere was no need for mechanical ventila-\ntion during the MRI. The dogs were mon-\nitored under the supervision of a\nveterinarian.\nThe MRI examination of the right knee\njoint included two image acquisition\nsequences. The left knee was not checked.\nA sagittal 3-dimensional volume interpola-\ntion T1-weighted (t1-vibe-we-sag) MRI\nms; flip angle, 10 u; slice thickness, 1mm)\nwas used for cartilage analysis (cartilage\nvolume and defects).

The\nfinal diagnosis was made by a consensus\nfollowing evaluation of the changes of the\narticular cartilage and subchondral bone\nstructure of the knee joint between the\noperation and sham-operation groups.\nThe presence and location of bone\nmarrow oedema and cartilage of tibial pla-\nteau alterations were used as the indicators\nfor MRI evaluation. The cartilage volume\nof the lateral and medial tibia was assessed\nby quantitative measurement, which was\nperformed using the 3-dimensional\nFLASH images and ImageJ software\n(National Institutes of Health) as previous-\nly described.19,20 The volume of the tibial\nplateau cartilage was measured using\nImageJ at different time-points after sur-\ngery.

At week 4, MRI revealed sub-\nchondral bone marrow oedema in the post-\neromedial tibia in three dogs (OA group),\ncausing a hyperintense signal on the t2-tse-\ncor sequences. No bone marrow oedema\nwas detected in the sham-operated knees.\nDiscussion\nArticular cartilage degeneration is the pri-\nmary concern in patients with OA, as the\nhomeostasis and integrity of the articular\ncartilage rely on its biochemical and\nbiomechanical interplay with the subchon-\ndral bone and other joint tissues.21\nSubchondral bone provides the mechanical\nsupport for the overlying articular cartilage\nduring the movement of load-bearing\njoints, and undergoes constant adaptation\nin response to changes in the mechanical\nenvironment through modelling or remod-\nelling.22 As a result of the instability of\nmechanical loading on such joints, the sub-\nchondral bone and calcified cartilage zone\nundergo changes.23During the progression\nof OA in its early stage, the abnormal pro-\nliferation of subchondral bone and the\noverlying articular cartilage are subjected\nto the combined effects of abnormal\nmechanical pressure, biochemical and\nother complex factors leading to the occur-\nrence of hypertrophic degeneration of chon-\ndrocytes.21 Hypertrophic degeneration of\nchondrocytes results in the secretion of\nlarge amounts of ColX when attempting\nto repair damaged chondrocytes.24\nFigure 4.

(a) A repre-\nsentative normal healthy knee tibial plateau from a dog in the control group, which is smooth with no\nobvious defects. (b) A representative tibial plateau from a dog with osteoarthritis, which shows that the\nsurface is no longer smooth and has surface thinning and subchondral bone exposure (rings).\nchains.28 Each chain has three domains: a\nshort triple helix domain flanked by a\nbigger globular domain (NC1 domain) at\nthe carboxyl end and a short non-\ncollagenous domain (NC2 domain) at the\namino end. ColX is thought to be specifi-\ncally synthesized by hypertrophic chondro-\ncytes of the growth plate during the\ndevelopment of long bones.23 Normal\nchondrocytes do not secrete ColX, but\narticular chondrocytes undergoing abnor-\nmal hypertrophic degeneration secrete\nlarge amounts of ColX.24 A previous\nstudy found that anti-ColX monoclonal\nantibody was produced by using the specific\npeptide (SFSGFLVAPM), the truncated\npeptide (SFSGFLVA) without the last two\namino acids and the nonsense peptide\n(DMDYLPRVPNQ), and through the\ndetection of serum ColX levels in 261\ncases of knee OA patients and 10 normal\nsubjects, it was found that the serum levels\nof ColX in the knee OA group were signif-\nicantly increased.6 This present study found\nthat the levels of serum ColX in the dogs\nwith the ACLT model of OA were signifi-\ncantly higher than those of the sham oper-\nation control group at weeks 8 and 12. At\nweek 16, the levels of serum ColX in the OA\ngroup were increased slightly compared\nwith the control group, but the difference\nwas not significant. These current findings\nsuggest that in the OA group at week 4, the\nearly stages of hypertrophic degeneration of\nthe chondrocytes resulted in the secretion of\nColX in an attempt to repair damaged\nchondrocytes, leading to a gradual increase\nin the secretion of ColX into the serum. By\nweeks 8 and 12, a large number of chondro-\ncytes exhibited hypertrophic degeneration\nand ColX secretion markedly increased.\nAt week 8, detection of ColX in the circu-\nlatory system was significantly increased\nand reached its peak. At week 16, as a\nresult of the persistent effect of the mechan-\nical instability of the articular cartilage, the\nnumber of chondrocytes that died due to\nthe hypertrophy and degeneration gradual-\nly increased. Similarly, the volume of artic-\nular cartilage gradually reduced, leading to\nFigure 6.

(d) Subchondral bone\nmarrow oedema in the posteromedial tibia causing a hyperintense signal on the t2-tse-cor sequences after\nsubchondral bone exposure and joint space\nnarrowing. Cartilage loss is a serious health\nrisk, thus the secretion of ColX began to\ndecline, and the level of ColX in the periph-\neral blood also decreased. Therefore, these\ncurrent findings support the use of ColX as\na potential marker of OA disease\nprogression.\nC-telopeptide of type II collagen is a\nmicro-molecule polypeptide produced by\nthe cleavage of type II collagen by activated\nprotease, which finally accumulates in the\nurine via the circulatory system.29,30 With\nthe aggravation of articular cartilage\ninjury, serum CTX-II levels may be\nincreased.31\u00ad34 Therefore, CTX-II is well-\nsuited as a quantitative biomarker of OA\ncartilage degeneration and is a sensitive\nmethod for the detection of type II collagen\ndegradation in patients with OA.35 A pre-\nvious study investigated the changes of\nserum CTX-II levels in OA induced by\nACLT for up to 5 months.3 The study\nfound that the CTX-II concentration first\npeaked at 3 weeks post-surgery; but from\nthe sixth week, a second peak in CTX-II\nconcentration was noted during week 12\nafter surgery, which was then followed by\na decline until the end of the study.3As a\nresult, the authors concluded that OA\nbegan to deteriorate from the sixth week\npost-surgery.3 Moreover, the peak value of\nCTX-II concentration may be significantly\ncorrelated with the aggravation of articular\ncartilage lesions.3 Another study found that\nthe CTX-II concentration in the synovial\nfluid of patients with knee joint injury is\nincreased.30 Other researchers have also\nreported a transient increase in CTX-II\nlevels in the rabbit model of OA.36,37 In a\ncanine OA model, serum CTX-II levels\nwere significantly higher than those of the\ncontrol group.38 The current investigation\ndemonstrated that serum CTX-II levels\nwere higher in the OA group compared\nwith the control group at week 4 but the\ndifference was not significant. At weeks 8,\n12 and 16, serum CTX-II levels in the OA\ngroup were significantly higher than those\nof the control group. These findings suggest\nthat, in the early stages of cartilage injury,\ntype II collagen undergoes no obvious deg-\nradation. In the early stages of articular car-\ntilage damage, compensatory hypertrophy\nof the chondrocytes occurs in an attempt\nto repair the damage, but with the increas-\ning severity of OA, hyperplastic chondro-\ncytes from the early stage undergo cell\ndeath and necrosis. As the chrondrocytes\ncontinue to die, there is also the continuous\ndegradation of type II collagen, so that\nincreasing amounts of CTX-II are released\ninto the blood leading to an increase in\nCTX-II levels between weeks 8 and 16.\nTherefore, CTX-II has potential as a bio-\nchemical marker of cartilage type II colla-\ngen degradation for monitoring the\nprogression of OA.\nIn recent years, with the improvements\nin the spatial resolution of MRI technology,\nthe software that can quantitatively evalu-\nate MRI cartilage volume has increased in\naccuracy. ImageJ software is a Java-based\npublic image processing and analysis pro-\ngram developed by Professor Wayne\nRasband at the National Institutes of\nHealth. It supports image stacks, a series\nof images that share a single window in\nimage processing, and is multithreaded.\nThis present study used lmageJ software\nto measure the cartilage volume of the\ntibial plateau of the knee joint in a canine\nMRI T1-vibe sequence. The results showed\nthat in the control sham operation group,\nthe cartilage volume of the tibial plateau\nwas similar before and after the sham sur-\ngery. In the OA group at week 4, the carti-\nlage volume of the tibial plateau increased\nby 1.4%compared with the preoperative\nbaseline values, although there was no sig-\nnificant difference between the two groups.\nAt weeks 8 and 16, the cartilage volume of\nthe tibial plateau in the OA group\ncompared with the preoperative baseline\nvalues; and the difference between the two\ngroups was significant. We hypothesize\nthat, at week 4, in the early stages of carti-\nlage injury, ACLT leads to mechanical\ninstability of the knee joint and injury to\nthe articular cartilage surface.\nSimultaneously, the articular chondrocytes\nundergo compensatory hypertrophy when\ntrying to repair the damaged chondrocytes.\nTherefore, the volume of the tibial plateau\ncartilage was slightly increased compared\nwith the preoperative values. However, as\ntime goes on, with the death of articular\nchondrocytes from compensatory hypertro-\nphy due to decompensation gradually\nincreasing, the thickness of the articular\ncartilage gradually reduced. Therefore, at\nweeks 8 and 16, the volume of the tibial\nplateau was significantly decreased com-\npared with the preoperative baseline\nvalues. However, at week 4, the differences\nwere not significant when compared with\npreoperative baseline values. The restricted\nsample size may be a limitation of the pre-\nsent study, so these conclusions require fur-\nther investigation.\nAlthough the ACLT model has been fre-\nquently used in the past, there are fewer\nstudies on the pathological mechanism of\ncartilage damage in OA from the viewpoint\nof serology and imaging. This present\nstudy, from the serological point of view,\nexplores the compensatory hypertrophic\ndegeneration of chondrocytes after injury,\nwhich attempts to repair damaged chondro-\ncytes. However, the continuous mechanical\ninstability acting on the articular cartilage\nalters the mechanism from compensatory\nhypertrophy to decompensated death and\nsubsequently leads to the degeneration of\narticular cartilage.39 The current quantita-\ntive MRI analysis of the tibial plateau car-\ntilage volume also found that the cartilage\nvolume increased lightly during the early\nstage of injury because of the compensatory\nhypertrophy of chondrocytes. However,\nunder the continuous pressure of mechani-\ncal instability, the death of cartilage cells\ngradually increased, eventually resulting in\na markedly decreased articular cartilage\nvolume compared with the preoperative\nvalues (baseline). The changes in articular\ncartilage volume were also consistent with\nthe serological test results. It should be\nnoted that a potential limitation of this\nstudy is the fact that subchondral bone\nmarrow oedema is not a common occur-\nrence detected using MRI in Beagles.\nAmong the dogs that exhibited bone\nmarrow oedema in the current study, the\noedema was not increased with the degen-\neration of the cartilage. Some dogs exhib-\nited obvious oedema after week 4 in the\nmedial tibial plateau. Although the\noedema was reduced by postoperative\nweek 8, the oedema markedly increased\nagain after week 16. One dog presented\nwith oedema at postoperative week 4 and\nthe oedema was resolved at the week 8 and\n16 scans, with no obvious presentation\nduring follow-up. A previous study found\nthat the degeneration of articular cartilage\nis closely related to bone marrow injury.40\nHowever, the present study found that\nthere was no universal prevalence of sub-\nchondral bone marrow oedema in this\ncanine model of cartilage degeneration\nOA. Furthermore, in the small number of\ndogs that exhibited oedema, the oedema did\nnot gradually increase with the deteriora-\ntion of OA disease. Therefore, the present\nstudy did not demonstrate an obvious syn-\nergistic relationship between bone marrow\noedema and OA cartilage degeneration.\nAdditional research is required to investi-\ngate the latter stages of OA in terms of\nbone marrow oedema.\nIn conclusion, these current results indi-\ncate that combined serum marker changes\nand quantitative MRI evaluation of the car-\ntilage volume of the tibial plateau in a\ncanine model of experimental OA may\npotentially be used to detect and monitor\nthe progression of OA. Moreover, the\nresults of this study suggest a novel direc-\ntion for follow-up analysis of the biochem-\nical pathogenesis of OA cartilage\ndegeneration.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by the National\nNatural Science Foundation of China (no.\nReferences\n1.
