The secondary products revolution is conventionally described in terms of agri-\ncultural intensification and a step towards urban development. This process marks a\nshift from a strategy in which most animals are culled when they reach an optimal\nweight, which for ruminants occurs relatively early in life, to one in which individual\nanimals are selected for their potential to yield one or more renewable products over\nthe course of life and raised until they can no longer produce secondary products,\nwhich tends to occur in adulthood. This new mode of practice placed individual mem-\nbers of two species on an intersubjective ontological plane and, moreover, spelled a shift\nin the temporality of human\u00adlivestock relations. This paper draws out the consequences\nof these ever-closer relationships in the course of human efforts to exploit renewable\nresources from domesticated animals. In particular, secondary products exploitation\nextended the lives of lactating female stock, sheep and goats desired for their fibres,\noxen engaged in ploughing and donkeys working as pack animals. In this paper, the\nimplications of these new long-term human\u00adanimal relationships, which originated\nand intensified sporadically in different regions of the Near East starting as early as\nthe Neolithic, are discussed in light of the new temporality that attended practices of\nlong-term stock-keeping.

Nasreddin could not fathom the crane as a bird because it had a\nseemingly unsuitable physicality for flight. His good intention of truncating the\ncrane's non-bird-like parts would have produced an animal that, although bearing\na semblance to more familiar birds, would have ceased to be a whole bird.\nNasreddin's mistake was in not recognising the crane as a unified organism con-\nstituted by interdependent anatomical parts, none of which functions without the\nothers. This allegory is apt for what follows, superficially because its subject is an\nanimal, but critically because it illustrates a normative attitude towards an animal.\nThe character in the tale carries with him a priori notions of how a bird should be\nstructured. He is either unable or unwilling to shed these assumptions when he\nencounters a species with which he is unfamiliar.\nIn a similar vein, the human perception of non-human animals in the modern\nurban environment is equally weak. Although scientists have gained profound\nknowledge of animals through developments in the fields of evolutionary biology,\nsystematics and ecology, the majority of urban denizens fail to notice, let alone\ninteract with, most of the animals that live among them (Waldau, 2013: 222). This\ndisengagement from animals has produced a set of ontological assumptions that\nhold humans in contradistinction to other animals. In fact, the entire anthropo-\nlogical enterprise is based on the premise that humans are exceptional among ani-\nmals and therefore merit a field of study devoted to understanding their unique role\nin the world.\nThis particular perspective on animals is a product of dualist ontology, itself an\noutgrowth of post-Enlightenment thought. People in the past and contemporary\npeople living at the margins of the Western world have conceptualised animals in a\nmyriad of forms. The ways that people relate to animals are as variable as the ways\nthat people relate to one another (Ingold, 1988: 1). As beings or objects, animals\nare employed as subsistence resources, capital, companions, predators, prey and\nkin. As ideas, animals are regarded as metaphors of social relations, morality,\nwealth, prestige, triumph and violence. The diversity of attitudes towards animals\nthat this short list exemplifies makes clear the difficulty of interpreting the behav-\niours towards and meanings of an animal species from the archaeological past. To\nunderstand how people in the past related to animals is an exercise in teasing out\nhistorically located logics. In cases for which communities represented animals in\ntext or art, this exercise is feasible. However, it is daunting for zooarchaeologists\nwho are tasked with gaining historically specific knowledge of animals from pre-\nhistoric communities that only left for posterity the biological remains of their\nanimals, since animal remains are conventionally thought to be silent on these\nmatters.\nFrom the outset, it is critical that I make clear my use of the word animal. On its\nface, the term is simple and familiar and should not be a source of debate.\nHowever, the anthropological and archaeological literature on human\u00adanimal rela-\ntions contains two categorically different, but often conflated, animal connotations:\none that refers to the physical organism (i.e. an animal being) and the other refers\nto a metaphysical representation of the organism (i.e. the Animal Spirit or Master\nof Animals known from Mesopotamian history and Amazonian ethnography). At\nthe risk of perpetuating a potentially false dichotomy between reality and repre-\nsentation, it is nonetheless essential to define the topic at hand. My concern is with\nthe flesh-and-blood animal, which produced an objective reality in the past, and\nmoreover, a posthumous expression suitable for archaeological enquiry.\nHuman\u00adanimal relations may be broadly understood as the interactions, both\nliteral and representational, between humans and other animals. Throughout its\nhistory, zooarchaeology has been principally concerned with questions of human\u00ad\nanimal relations, such as hunting strategy, domestication, animal husbandry and\nanimal sacrifice. Zooarchaeologists, however, have only recently embraced the\n`animal turn' that now pervades much cross-disciplinary research in the humanities\nand social sciences. In fact, zooarchaeology, as a largely methods-driven discipline,\nremains firmly rooted in addressing questions of basic subsistence with an expand-\ning and increasingly exacting repertoire of analytical techniques based in biological\nscience. The slow of reaction of zooarchaeology to engage with emerging research\nproduced in other disciplines, such as ethology, cognitive sciences, philosophy and\nanthropology, urges us to redress this long-standing insularity (for a notable excep-\nThis paper seeks to draw out the consequences of the ever-closer relationships\nthat developed between people and livestock in the course of human efforts to\nexploit renewable resources, such as milk, fibre and traction, from livestock. The\nemergence of these innovations, which occurred sporadically in different regions of\nthe Near East from the Neolithic to Early Bronze (EB) Age, has come to be known\ncollectively as the secondary products revolution (SPR). The phenomenon refers to\na series of agricultural subsistence changes that initially saw livestock exploited\nsolely or primarily for their primary products (i.e. meat, hide and bone) to a sub-\nsequently expanded set of practices for extracting renewable secondary products.\nWhile the SPR is conventionally couched in terms of agricultural intensification\nand a stage in the process of urban expansion in the Near East and Europe\nspective that discusses the implications of the new temporality that attended prac-\ntices of long-term stock-keeping.\nThe development of human\u00adlivestock co-dependence\nAnimal domestication\nDefinitions of animal domestication are numerous and diverse, but this is mostly a\nconsequence of individual researchers choosing to emphasise different aspects of\nthe domestication concept (see Russell, 2002; Zeder, 2012 for thorough reviews).\nAll agree that domestication was a redefining process for human\u00adanimal relations,\nbut difference of opinion rests on the significance of the locus of change, whether\nbiological or social. One popular view focuses on the apparent imbalance that\ncharacterises the relationship of masterful humans who control selection, taming,\nbreeding and feeding of submissive animal domesticates (Bo\n\u00a8 ko\nClutton-Brock, 1994; Ingold, 1996). Another perspective emphasises domestication\nas a marked shift in resource focus from products of dead animals to maintaining\nthe essential products of living animals: their progeny (Meadow, 1993: 296). Others\nprefer to emphasise that domestication was not a one-sided process. Rather,\nhumans and animals selected each other by entering into mutualistic relationships\nDiscussions of the social side of domestication tend to explain the phenomenon\nin terms of a shift in perception from animal categories (species) to individuals\n(Ducos, 1978). Still others hold the opposite view that a shift in perception from\nindividual prey to the entire herd occurred alongside the domestication process\n(Mlekuz\ndomesticate relationship as one of asymmetrical mutualism. Here, domestication\nis mutualistic since both humans and domesticates increase their reproductive fit-\nness, but asymmetrical because humans alone have the capacity for social learning\nthrough knowledge transmission.\nSecondary products\nSince the Neolithic, people living in temperate regions of the Near East primarily\nrelied upon four principal livestock species \u00ad sheep, goat, cattle and pig. Before the\nemergence of dairying, these animals were exploited for their meat and other pri-\nmary products. However, a decisive modification to human\u00adanimal relations\noccurred with the origin of dairying, as this critical innovation precipitated changes\nin food choices, storability, daily scheduling and many other related realms of\npractice (Sherratt, 1983). The earliest evidence for secondary products exploitation\nis found in milk fat residues from Neolithic (end of the seventh millennium BC)\nceramic vessels (Evershed et al., 2008). The critical question, however, is not the\norigin of secondary products exploitation, but the onset of intensive or systematic\n2006: 96). In other words, when did the scale of secondary products exploitation\nchange to the point of spelling the economic transformation that set the stage for\nurban development?\nucts as innovations that were collectively as `revolutionary' as Childe's Neolithic\nRevolution that entailed the initial domestication of plants and animals. He coined\nthe term `Secondary Products Revolution' to encapsulate what he inferred to be a\ndramatic subsistence shift from the use of livestock as providers of primary prod-\nucts to the use of livestock as providers of renewable secondary resources. While\nprimary products require the death of the animal for exploitation, secondary prod-\nucts are repeatedly exploited from an animal over the course of its life (Greenfield,\n1988: 573). Sherratt proposed that the intensive dairy, fibre and traction exploit-\nation practices in the Chalcolithic (mid-fifth to mid-fourth millennium BC) had a\nrevolutionary impact on economic, social and ideological developments in the Near\nEast, which collectively established the conditions for urbanisation in the EB Age\n(mid-fourth to mid-late third millennium BC).\nThirty years later, we now understand that the origin of dairying long predates\nthe origins of traction and wool exploitation (Evershed et al., 2008; Vigne and\nHelmer, 2007) and the timing and geographical spread of secondary products\nturned conventional wisdom is the juvenile male slaughtering regime for sheep and\ngoats, which was long thought to be Neolithic orthodoxy (Payne, 1973). This\nstrategy aimed to exploit meat from immature male individuals when they achieved\nan optimal weight (when the growth rate slowed and the labour and material\nresources required to keep them alive were counterbalanced by their value as\nmeat) and to keep a larger number of mature female individuals for breeding\npurposes. However, it is now apparent that early Neolithic livestock managers\nengaged in a variety of strategies designed to variously provision meat and propa-\ngate the herd. Demographic profiling based on biometric faunal data from pub-\nlished sources from across the Neolithic Near East found that the herd\nmanagement strategy of culling young male animals for meat provisioning only\nAlthough the individual innovations of the SPR did not rapidly emerge and\ndiffuse together as a package as Sherratt initially envisioned, the impact of second-\nary products was transformative for societies that relied upon them. Dairying\nprovided a means of procuring animal proteins without slaughtering the source.\nThe ox-drawn plough allowed new agricultural strategies through the cultivation of\npreviously uncultivable soil types, which expanded the amount of land devoted to\norchard and cereal crops. Equally critical in the Near East was the use of the\ndonkey as a pack animal, which allowed more intensive agricultural production\nthrough the mobilisation of agricultural tools, water and harvests.\nThe nature of human\u00adlivestock relations that was established with the advent of\ndomestication transformed when the scale of secondary products exploitation\nintensified. People would have formed distinctive relationships with specialised\nlivestock animals, as each of the secondary products developed independently in\ndifferent places and at different times. Ethnographic literature on pastoral systems\nshows that the nature of these relations would have been contingent upon any\nnumber of variables, including the economic and social values of the harvested\nproduct, product yield, and the type, sex, colour and fatness of the animal\nalso facilitated broad social transformations. While dairying is conventionally\nlauded as a breakthrough in the exploitation of nutrients and calories (Redding,\ndaily dairying schedule engenders physical proximity and a degree of trust between\nThe intensive application of animal traction in the late fourth millennium further\ntransformed human\u00adlivestock relations. While hoe agriculture entailed widespread\ncommunity involvement, the ox-drawn plough would have required a smaller\nnumber of specialists to feed and direct draught animals. Specialist handlers work-\ning closely with a limited number of draught livestock entail the formation of\nintimate and co-dependent partnerships. Thus, the technology to harness the\nstrength of cattle and donkeys represented an improvement upon and replacement\nof human labour. In economic terms, this innovation freed human labour for\nagricultural expansion, craft specialisation and large-scale building projects. In a\nsimilar economic vein, the advent of animal traction and transport produced a\nconceptual shift from animals as sources of nutrition to animals as capital assets\na course towards mutual dependence between livestock and people, but the emer-\ngence of intensive secondary animal products exploitation firmly established\nco-dependency.\nThe term `co-dependence', along with its permutations, is used repeatedly in this\narticle and serves three principal purposes: (1) as a linguistic way of transcending\nthe human\u00adanimal boundary; (2) to indicate the relational nature of humans and\nanimals that lived and worked together; and (3) to emphasise that members of two\nspecies came to rely upon each other to the point of inextricable interconnectedness\n(Hodder, 2011). These notions of co-dependency are loosely aligned with ideas\nfound in Actor\u00adNetwork Theory (Latour, 1993). In this sense, people and livestock\nas well as milk, traction, transport, fibres, ploughs, fields, crop harvests, agricul-\ntural tools, water and a host of other material and immaterial components acted in\na relational web of dependency. In the section that follows, I make a case for the\ndevelopment of co-dependent relationships between secondary products-yielding\nlivestock and their human keepers in the southern Levant during the Chalcolithic\nand EB Age.\nHuman\u00adlivestock relations in the Chalcolithic and EB Age\nof the southern Levant\nThe southern Levant in the period that spans the Late Chalcolithic (c. 4500\u00ad3700\ncal. BC) to Early Bronze I (EB I) (c. 3700\u00ad3100 cal. BC) witnessed key transform-\nations in urban settlement pattern, craft production, water management, land use,\nmortuary practice and long-distance exchange relations (Milevski, 2011; Philip,\nopments tend to locate their collective importance in providing the conditions\nnecessary for urban-scale settlement nucleation that developed in EB II\u00adIII\nand Tchernov, 1989; Joffe, 1993). One of the most dramatic and impactful changes\noccurred in the realm of food production. New agropastoral innovations and\nintensification of existing ones, such as water management technologies, olive\nand grape orchards, plough and pack animals, dairying, and wool production,\naltered the landscape and how people moved about this space (Philip, 2003).\nThese elements became inextricably connected starting in the Chalcolithic and\nEB periods, as intensified agropastoral production fostered the frequent commin-\ngling of people, livestock, crops and agropastoral technologies such that they\noccupied overlapping spatiotemporal contexts in settlements and hinterlands. An\nexposition of the pertinent southern Levantine evidence will demonstrate the con-\nvergence of these elements in the Chalcolithic and EB periods, and in particular,\nthe existence of the conditions for human\u00adanimal co-dependency.\nSupplying secondary products entails high maintenance costs and long-term\nrelationships with people. We know much from Near Eastern ethnographic litera-\nSweet, 1960). In terms of maintenance costs, dairy stock in hot climates such as the\nsouthern Levant may require foddering close to home in order to avoid the risk of\nmilk spoiling during transport. If kept within the settlement, even if only tempor-\narily, space must be reserved for livestock. Furthermore, enclosures must be built\naround this space in order to protect the stock against predators. This appears to\nhave been the case at the Chalcolithic village of Tel Tsaf in the Jordan Valley\n(Figure 1). Micromorphological thin sections from unpaved ground surfaces of\ntwo circular structures revealed clusters of dung spherulites (Hubbard, 2010).\nThese spherically shaped calcareous particles, formed in the stomachs of animals\nand excreted in their dung (Shahack-Gross et al., 2003), indicate that the circular\nstructures at Tel Tsaf were used as livestock enclosures. The evidence from dung\nspherulites shows that not only livestock were kept within the village but also their\npens were located within a few metres of the rectilinear dwellings occupied by\npeople. A similar form of micromorphological evidence from the Chalcolithic\nsite of Grar in the northern Negev suggests that animal dung was collected and\nused as fuel in a series of three superimposed hearths (Katz et al., 2007). Much like\nthe evidence from Tel Tsaf, it appears that livestock and people at Grar were living\nin sufficiently close proximity for this secondary product to be collected and burned\nN\nTell el-Far'ah N.\nYiftahel\nAzor\nTel Yarmut\nArad\nkilometres\nmiles\nTel Tsaf\nTel Bet Yerah\nTel Dan\nKh. ez-Zeraqon\nFeinan sites\nA\nI\nTell Rakan II\nGrar\nFigure 1.

While these examples of secondary products extraction entail a mode of\nexploitation, the daily feeding, watering and cleaning interactions between people\nand livestock kept at or near the home provide the conditions for intimate social\nrelations between people and their animals.\nDraught cattle that plough agricultural fields require fodder and a large water\nsupply when they are working, pasture when they are not working and an invest-\nment of several years of rearing and training (Halstead, 1995). Intersecting lines of\nzooarchaeological evidence, such as mortality profiles and pathology data, as well\nas rare ceramic representations of cattle at work, reflect the importance of cattle in\nthe Chalcolithic and EB and their likely deployment in traction activities.\nIconographic depictions of cattle are rare in the EB, but a bowl that contains a\nclay model of a pair of yoked oxen from a probable EB I context at Tell el-Far'ah\nNorth provides strong evidence that cattle were employed in heavy labour\n(Amiran, 1986: 12, Figure 3). Diachronic patterns that track age-at-death data\nfor cattle from the Neolithic through EB are uncommon. This is a consequence\nof at least two intersecting factors: faunal remains have been collected from few\nsouthern Levantine sites comprising more than one Neolithic through EB compo-\nnent, and of these few sites, dental and epiphyseal fusion data required to recon-\nstruct mortality patterns from cattle are so few that statistically sound culling\nprofiles are often precluded. Yiftahel in the Lower Galilee provides a rare view\nof cattle mortality from Pre-Pottery Neolithic (PPN) and early EB I levels,\nalthough the small sample of long bone epiphyses on which the data are based is\nsmall (Horwitz, 1997). Two additional caveats to consider are that epiphyseal\nfusion data are inherently biased in favour of fused bones that are more resilient\nagainst taphonomic attrition relative to low-density unfused bones, and fused long\nbones signal the minimum age at death, not the actual age at death. With these\nprovisos in mind, the Yiftahel data imply that cattle were slaughtered sometime\nbetween the ages of two and three years in the PPN, but their longevity increased\nslightly in EB I when they were maintained at least to the age of 3.5 years and\npossibly beyond (Horwitz, 1997: Figure 17.7). This pattern that emphasises mature\ncattle is consistent with milk or traction exploitation, but if one particular product\nwas emphasised in the PPN or EB I at Yiftahel, the answer is beyond reach of the\nevidence.\nThis diachronic pattern of cattle mortality viewed from a single site in the southern\nLevant is complemented in a broad geographic in a meta-analysis of sheep and\ngoat mortality profiles from the northern Levant and northern Mesopotamia\n(Helmer et al., 2007). This study found that most Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB)\nassemblages reflect a mixed strategy of meat and milk exploitation; Pottery Neolithic-\nChalcolithic assemblages showed high degree of intersite variability, with some\nfocused on meat and others focused on milk or fibres; and EB assemblages were\nfocused almost exclusively on secondary products. The results of Helmer et al.\n(2007) clearly show that, while a variety of stock management strategies were prac-\ntised from the Neolithic through Chalcolithic, by the turn of the EB Age, sheep and\ngoat across the northern half of the Near East were routinely raised into adulthood.\nWith regard to the duration of human\u00adanimal relationships, dairy stock must\nreach sexual maturity before lactation is possible and draught stock must be\ntrained for up to several years and males may be castrated before they can be\nput to work. Evidence from arthrotic palaeolpathologies is useful for identifying\nlivestock that reached an age sufficiently advanced to develop such lesions\nwith advanced age and these growth deformations are often attributed to long-term\nsurvey of pathologies reported from southern Levantine faunal assemblages span-\nning Neolithic though recent historical periods found that, from the EB onward,\npathologies are exclusively found on livestock species that produce secondary prod-\nucts (sheep, goat, cattle and donkey) (Sapir-Hen et al., 2008). Furthermore, the\nwork of Sapir-Hen et al. (2008) found that arthrotic pathologies (termed `induced\npathologies' by the authors) are only found on lower limb bones of cattle. While\nthe database that informs these results is sparse, the available evidence indicates\nthat cattle reached advanced age and likely incurred these lesions from repetitive\nwork activities.\nIn fact, the value of draught power is not entirely located in animal labour itself\nbut also in the crop harvests from the soils that the animals plough. For cereal\ncrops, this delayed return may be a matter of seasons, but newly planted orchards\nmay not produce fruit for several years. Thus, the return on investment for animal\ntraction is substantially delayed in the context of agricultural production, which\nwould have contributed to long-term dependencies between people and livestock.\nThe evidence of orchard crops is critical to a discussion of plough technology, as it\nwas the replacement of digging stick technology with the plough that allowed\nfarmers to till formerly uncultivable soil types in the hills of the Mediterranean\nforest zone (Finkelstein and Gophna, 1993). The southern Levant offers much\nevidence for the domestication and the subsequently swift intensification of\ngrapes and olives starting in the Chalcolithic. Olive production appears to be\nsmall in scale in the Chalcolithic, but by the EB, evidence for large-scale production\nsuch as storage jars, spouted vessels, querns and mortars is reported from several\nsites, including Tell Raka\ndomesticated as early as the Chalcolithic, but large-scale production is apparent in\nthe EB (Miller, 2008). Wine production on a mass scale is most evident in Tomb\nU-j at Abydos, Egypt, dated to Naqada IIIA in the Egyptian chronology, which is\ncoeval with late EB I in the Levantine sequence. This royal tomb contained\napproximately 700 southern Levantine-made wine jars, some of which contained\ntartaric acid residues, grape pips and preserved grapes (McGovern et al., 1997).\nLivestock traction and transport would have been essential to the production\nand mobilisation of these fruit crops. Pack donkeys in particular would have been\nuseful for transporting water, agricultural tools, harvests and various commodities\ncaravans may have been responsible for moving copper from Feinan and Sinai to a\nMediterranean port or perhaps as far as its foreign recipient (Milevski, 2011:\nin the EB is well documented in the material record. While equid remains tend to\ncomprise a minor component of faunal assemblages, their prominence as subjects\nin zoomorphic clay figurines suggests that they were highly regarded in EB society.\nEquid figurines, many of which are depicted carrying a pair of containers on their\nbacks along with a few that are depicted with saddles or harnesses from EB II\u00adIII\ncontexts, have been found over a wide swath of the southern Levant, from Tel Dan\nin the north to Arad in the south, and from Azor in the west to Khirbet ez-Zeraqon\ndonkey figurines from primary contexts, all but one are from burials. These fig-\nurative representations of donkeys and their burdens lend support to the premise\nthat people, donkeys and the goods they transported became co-dependent elem-\nents in a unified field of practice.\nThe new agricultural practices that accompanied the SPR would have created\ndramatic changes of the landscape and how people moved about this space.\nAgricultural fixtures, such as check dams, traction and pack animals, and fruit\norchards were new to Chalcolithic and EB Age landscapes. These new features\nof the landscape would have also created a shift in temporality, as ploughing,\nplanting, harvesting and processing tasks supplanted annual scheduling of smaller\nscale agricultural practices. Taken together, the intimate relationships formed with\nlivestock as a consequence of the new SPR temporalities would have spelled\nimportant changes in agricultural practices in terms of labour saving, higher\nyields, storable surpluses and valuations of agricultural staples (Philip, 2003: 108).\nDiscussion\nThe Chalcolithic\u00adEB Age of the southern Levant is interpreted as a cultural entity\nthat enacted human\u00adanimal co-dependence through the establishment of pro-\ntracted and systematic secondary products exploitation practices. While livestock\ndomestication brought humans and animals into overlapping spaces, it was the\nadvent of intensive secondary products exploitation that instigated a shift in annual\nscheduling of agropastoral activities and, in turn, fostered new temporalities based\non long-term milking, shearing, ploughing and transport regimes with individual\nanimals. Ultimately, enduring interpersonal relationships formed between second-\nary products-yielding livestock and their human keepers. It is the lived experience\nof these relationships, from human and non-human animal perspectives, to which\nthe discussion now turns.\nAnimal perceptions of humans\nEthological research is currently overturning the idea that humans are the only\nanimal species capable of complex social learning. Simple forms of social learning\nhave been observed in many mammal, bird, fish and invertebrate species\n(Whiten and Van Schaik, 2007). More complex forms of social learning have been\nfound in chimpanzees, elephants and dolphins, among other species. Proponents of\nanimal consciousness argue that non-human animals are active, sentient, wilful\nsubjects that are as much engaged with each other as people are with each other\ndemonstrated that several non-human animal species enact complex cognitive abil-\nities during competitive foraging events. For example, some animals have know-\nledge of what other competitors can and cannot see and they use this knowledge to\ngain success in foraging. Such behaviours have mostly been observed in non-\nhuman primates, but critically for the present discussion, these abilities have\nbeen observed in domestic goats. Results from experiments found that goats\nmake complex foraging choices that depend on factors such as position in the\ndominance hierarchy relative to conspecifics and the visual gaze of a competitor\n(Kaminski et al., 2006). Goats have also been found to follow the directional gaze\ncues from other species (in this case, humans) in order to find hidden food\n(Kaminski et al., 2005). These and other empirical results from animal behaviour\nresearch form a compelling case for extending attributions of self-awareness,\nagency and consciousness to certain non-human animals that include livestock\nshould compel zooarchaeologists to redress outmoded ideas of human exception-\nalism by taking seriously the possibility of non-human animal social intelligence\nand human\u00adanimal co-sociality (Waldau, 2013).\nBefore scientists found empirical support for a theory of animal consciousness,\nnon-Western indigenous people widely regarded animals as active agents, as they\ndo to this day. These indigenous ontologies almost certainly long predate the\nCartesian dualism of person/animal. These perspectives raise the question: If\nhumans and non-humans alike are conscious beings, then what, if anything, dis-\ntinguishes us from them? The anthropological answer to this question lies in the\nenigmatic realm of culture (Laland and Hoppitt, 2003). However, the more tan-\ngible answer is the uniquely human capacity for intellectual reason. A goat engaged\nin the purposive act of browsing may have intuitive thoughts and feelings with\nrespect to food and the social interactions with the herder and other goats in the\nherd (Kaminski et al., 2005, 2006). However, this goat and all other non-primate\nanimals do not possess a priori knowledge necessary for deductive reasoning\nHuman perceptions of animals\nWhile the issue of non-human animal consciousness inspires fierce debate among\nbiologists and, more recently, anthropologists, a rather more contentious assertion,\nand one with fewer adherents, is that non-human animals exist in an intersubjective\nworld of meaningful social relations. Ingold draws a categorical distinction\nbetween the hunter\u00adwild animal interaction, which is conceived as a relationship\nbased on trust, and the herder\u00adlivestock interaction, which he conceives as a\nrelationship based on domination (Ingold, 1994). The pastoralist acts as a provider,\nguardian and executioner and in this sense holds a mastery over the dependent\nherd. Ingold interprets the pastoralist's material culture, such as the whip, spur,\ntether and harness, as tools used to restrict or stimulate movement through super-\nior force. In effect, the relationship between humans and livestock, particularly\nthose that are subjugated in work, is rendered as one between master and slave.\nTapper (1988) also explores the theme of animal slavery. He identifies parallels\nbetween slavery and draught animals in terms of the human control of the feeding\nand reproduction of subservient animals. Tapper also finds similarities between\npastoralists who lead their herd across pastures and feudal lords who provide\nprotection in exchange for payment. A similar perspective draws an analogy\nbetween the pastoralist and the slave master (Tani, 1996). This analogy is sup-\nported by the example of the bellwether, a castrated sheep or goat employed to\nlead the flock. Castration serves to make otherwise aggressive animals obedient,\nbut it effectively removes the animal from the reproductive portion of the herd,\nthus creating an outcast that is neither a member of the herd nor one of the herders.\nRather, the bellwether serves the liminal role of mediator between the herder and\nthe flock. Since most of a dairy herd is composed of female animals, the wether is\nregarded as a guardian of the females, which makes it functionally analogous to the\nhuman eunuch. This characterisation may be extended to castrated draught ani-\nmals (Clutton-Brock, 1994: 31\u00ad32). Castration not only reduces aggression but also\ninduces weight gain, which is a helpful attribute for animals engaged in hauling and\nploughing. The consensus among these scholars is that coercive dominance char-\nacterises the relationship between people and their livestock.\nIngold's (1994) distinction of trust held between hunters and wild animals and\ndomination held between herders and domestic animals has been critiqued on a\nnumber of grounds. Armstrong Oma (2010) regards Ingold's thesis as untenable for\ncharacterising people who share a common mode of exploiting animals a common\nontology with respect to animals. She even objects to the term human\u00adanimal\ninteraction. Instead, she makes the case for human\u00adanimal intra-action, a term\nthat connotes mutuality and co-constitution of being. Her argument for intra-\naction is particularly satisfying in a discussion of the social contract between\ndairy stock and their managers. Although the two parties are not equal, their\nrelationship must be founded on trust rather than coercion in order for the animals\nto be sufficiently calm to let down their milk. Armstrong Oma, while challenging\nIngold's aphorism of the virtuous hunter and the oppressive herder, perpetuates a\ndifferent metanarrative: the Euro\u00adAmerican presumption of the existence of a\nduality between trust and domination in indigenous ontology.\nPa\n\u00b4 lsson (1996) presents a more forceful critique against the trust\u00addomination\ndualism, although not against Ingold's (1994) thesis in particular. Pa\n\u00b4 lsson argues\nthat to separate orientalism and paternalism (approximately equivalent to domin-\nation and trust, respectively) perpetuates the modernist duality of society and\nnature. Rather, Pa\n\u00b4 lsson offers a third paradigm, environmental communalism,\nwhich rejects the nature/society separation. This concept promotes a dialogue\namong people and environment, two spheres that constitute a unified totality.\nPa\n\u00b4 lsson's proposal to consider society and nature together as a total concept par-\nallels Bateson's (1972) `ecology of mind' model that views mind and nature as\nan indivisible whole, and Latour's (1993) theory of hybrids that blends society/\nnature and human/non-human. The environmental communalism paradigm, more-\nover, challenges assumptions of economic exploitation, indigenous protection and\nthe objectification of animals, which are the hallmarks of orientalism and\npaternalism.\nThe gnomic utterances used to describe the nature of human\u00adanimal relations,\nwhich have constituted the prevailing discourse, now appear outmoded. Notions\nof unity-in-opposition and environmental communalism present a welcome\nchallenge to the dualistic aphorisms of trust/domination and human-as-master/\nanimal-as-slave. Indeed, moral ambivalence and ontological fluidity with\nrespect to domesticated animals find empirical support in the archaeological\nrecord. The now pervasive `animal turn' in social science scholarship dissolves\nof human\u00adanimal relations studies, which has only recently gained traction in\narchaeological research, humans and animals are in a continuous state of mutual\nbecoming and are therefore co-constituted. Postulations of fluid interspecies\nboundaries and hybrid sociality are responses to long-standing anthropocentric\nconceptualisations of Homo sapiens as a species exclusive of all others\nIn keeping with these alternate perspectives on shifting human\u00adanimal relations\nis the work of Orton (2010), who argues that initial animal domestication in the\nEuropean Neolithic triggered an ontological shift from animals as commodities to\nanimals as `sentient property'. He proposes this neologism as a purposefully\ncontradictory term to capture the dual nature of domestic animals as possessions\nand social subjects. With respect to the Neolithic of southern Britain, where cattle\nremains are commonly found in association with human remains in mortuary\ncontexts, Ray and Thomas (2003: 40) contend that the partnership formed between\npeople and cattle was intimate to the point of ontological equivalency. The con-\nclusions drawn from these examples point to a transformation in human\u00adlivestock\nrelations as a consequence of the domestication process bringing livestock into the\nfold of human society.\nNotions of endurance and closeness form the central argument in an essay that\nat once argues against the premise of interpersonal relations between the hunter\nand his prey and for the possibility of intimate, interpersonal relationships between\nhumans and domesticated animals (Knight, 2012). Knight makes the pragmatic, if\nnot utilitarian, evaluation that hunting, as an act of stalking and killing prey that\noccurs in the course of a brief one-off encounter, is an implausible circumstance\nduring which members of two species can become sufficiently familiar with one\nanother such that their relation might be considered intimate. Instead, Knight\nmaintains that domesticated animals are far better candidates to enter into intimate\nrelationships with humans. He cites their tameness and captivity as qualities that\ncreate a spatiotemporal context of frequent and close interactions (Knight, 2012:\n343). Individual humans and animals build histories of repeated encounters, the\ncumulative effect of which is a depth of familiarity. While Knight's detractors find\nhis thesis instrumentalist in tone and reductionist in approach [see comments in\nKnight (2012)], he nevertheless makes a compelling argument against the hunting-\non the basis of the temporal durability of human\u00adanimal relations.\nA particularly clear example of enduring human\u00adlivestock relations, but one\nthat does not shy away from interspecific complexity and ambiguity, is found in\nthe oppositional ontologies held by commercial and hobbyist livestock breeders\nand slaughterers in modern northeastern Scotland (Wilkie, 2005). Workers in com-\nmercial livestock production, particularly those responsible for slaughter, regard\nanimals as deindividualised commodities, whereas those working in the hobbyist\nsector, particularly those who are responsible for breeding, decommodify livestock\nby recognising each animal as an individual. In the interstices between commercial\nslaughterers and hobbyist breeders are commercial breeders and hobbyist slaugh-\nterers who report ambiguous or ambivalent feelings about their animals. Wilkie\nfound that the closer workers are to the breeding side of the process, the easier it is\nfor them to acknowledge their emotional affect for their animals. Breeders, who\nspend long periods of time intimately nurturing animals from insemination to\nweaning, associate their work with the production of life rather than death.\nThese workers express an intersubjective affinity for individual animals.\nSlaughterers, on the other hand, have brief, indirect encounters with livestock in\nthe moments before their deaths. These workers do not form emotional bonds to\nindividual animals, but instead treat animals categorically as a herd or simply as\nmeat, perhaps as an effort to mollify the burden of the executioner.\nWilkie's case of divergent ontological positions among Scottish livestock\nproducers provides two important insights to consider when thinking about\nhuman\u00adlivestock relations in the past. First, the ontological position of domesti-\ncated animals is likely variable within a single culture, a point that should dissuade\nanyone from making monolithic statements about the nature of such relations.\nSecond, the longevity and directness of interaction between an individual human\nand an individual animal is the critical factor that establishes the degree to which\nindividual members from two species can become socially connected.\nAn ethnographic case that echoes the interspecific complexity found by Wilkie\nconcerns farmers in a Greek island community who hold multiple ontologies with\nrespect to their animals. Theodossopoulos (2005) describes the farmer's relation-\nship with his livestock as one based on both resource exploitation and kinship.\nGreek farmers initially regard individual livestock animals as useful instruments of\nfood and labour, but over time this relationship becomes more intimate as the\nanimal becomes a member of the household. Livestock are brought into the\nmoral sphere of the household because their keepers feel a sense of duty to animals\nthat diligently provide their secondary products and eventually, their primary\nproducts. Farmers are compelled through a moral obligation of reciprocity to\nreturn the favour by providing care and protection to their livestock. Over the two-\nto three-year period of rearing and training, a draught animal is cared for by its\nowner or guardian in a controlling, domineering fashion, just as a child is treated\n(Theodossopoulos, 2005: 22). But over the longer period during which that animal\nworks, its owner or guardian develops an affective, nurturing attitude that reflects a\nsense of kinship, just like a member of the family. The ontological shift that\ndevelops over the prolonged period of collaboration between animal and person\ndoes not entail the replacement of a domination ethos with a trust ethos. Rather,\nthe prior exploitative attitude is mediated by affective care for an animal that is\nregarded as a member of the household. These Greek farmers, who form enduring\nand close relationships with their livestock, ambiguously regard livestock as instru-\nmental and affective.\nA final example of the complexity and ambiguity found in human\u00adlivestock\nrelations is offered by a Mesopotamian cuneiform text from Nippur dating to\nthe early second millennium BC (Old Babylonian period). This tablet, which\ndescribes inheritance of property, lists cattle along with other household property\nsuch as a wagon, grindstone and door (Postgate, 1992: 97). However, the same text\ndescribes cattle with personified names much like a member of the family (Postgate,\n1992: 164). These dual connotations of property and persona suggest that\nBabylonians regarded cattle as both resources and kin.\nIn this section, I have attempted to reconcile animal domestication and SPR\nframeworks with perspectives from human\u00adanimal studies emphasising temporal-\nity as the critical factor leading to intimate co-sociality. The southern Levantine\nevidence, which shows that people, livestock and agricultural technology and prac-\ntice became spatially and temporally imbricated in the period that spans the\nChalcolithic to EB, supports the premise of a permeable human\u00adanimal boundary\napproaching ontological intersubjectivity for secondary products-yielding livestock\nand the humans that cared for them.\nConclusion\nThe theory advanced in this paper offers a grounded alternative to the transhis-\ntorical theories of human\u00adanimal relations that have dominated archaeological\ndiscussion. Initial ungulate domestication in the Neolithic was novel both in\nterms of its mode of exploitation and the nature of human\u00adanimal relations that\ndeveloped in its course. However, the potential for intimate human\u00adlivestock rela-\ntions was only made possible when the lives of animals were extended with the\nadvent of secondary products exploitation. While the energetic benefits of milk and\ntraction would not have been lost on people in the past, secondary products trans-\nformed several other facets of society. Over the course of the long-term process of\nbecoming domesticated and continuing through the development of intensive sec-\nondary products exploitation, people and their livestock developed varying degrees\nof intimate social relationships.\nThis theory holds temporality as the critical element that defines human\u00adlive-\nstock relations. Just as Knight (2012) argues that the brief encounter between\nhunter and prey does not provide an opportunity for members of two species to\nget acquainted, I have argued that animal domestication in and of itself is not a\nsufficient explanation for the spatiotemporal context of human\u00adlivestock relations\nof the Chalcolithic and EB of the southern Levant. Rather, I contend that intensive\nsecondary products exploitation merits recognition for fostering the ever closer and\nfrequent contact between humans and livestock that was required for routine\nextraction of milk, fibre, traction and transport. Exploitation of secondary prod-\nucts shifted focus away from primarily slaughtering young animals for meat and\ntowards long-term maintenance of livestock. The longevity of lives of animals that\nprovide secondary products afforded the opportunity for individual members of\ntwo species to achieve mutual familiarity and thereby enter into social relation-\nships. The emergence of intensive secondary products exploitation redefined\ndomestic animals to the extent that livestock and people formed a relational web\nof dependency (Hodder, 2011). This new set of practices created a human depend-\nency on healthy cows, ewes and does for regular and frequent milk production, and\nhealthy oxen and donkeys for labour, while livestock in turn depended upon people\nfor nothing less than their existence.\nThe model of human\u00adlivestock relations for the southern Levantine\nChalcolithic\u00adEB Age that is presented in this paper considers domestic animals\nto have been ontologically entangled within a world of agricultural practices that\nincluded material and immaterial constituents. Material constituents included live-\nstock, humans, agricultural fields, cereal and orchard crops, fodder, water, meat,\nmilk, fibres and labour, while immaterial constituents included perceptions of\nwealth, power, trust and domination, work and kinship. Although the lens of\nWestern thought would place some of these elements at odds with one another\n(e.g. human/animal, pastoralism/agriculture, trust/domination and power/kinship),\na relational ontology of human\u00adlivestock interactions reflected in the social and\neconomic conditions described for the Chalcolithic\u00adEB Age of the southern Levant\ndoes not find opposition between competing interests, but rather conceives of these\nconcepts as ambiguously held in tension. This world of contradictions, quite apart\nfrom our own, is conceived as a coherent reality.\n"
