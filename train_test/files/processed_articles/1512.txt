We subsequently\nexamine two mechanisms that contribute to the individual-level correlation. First, we\nfind that men in polygynous marriages have more extramarital sex than men in\nmonogamous unions (both in terms of self reports and in terms of spousal reports of the\nsuspicion of adultery). Second, we find evidence of adverse selection of HIV positive\nwomen into polygynous unions via an investigation of the relationship between\nmarriage order and polygyny status. We conclude with reflections about possible\nexplanations for the distinct individual and ecological correlations.\n1 University of Colorado at Boulder, Population Program, Institute of Behavioral Science.\n2 University of the Witwatersrand, School of Social Sciences and School of Public Health.\n3 Carleton University, Department of Sociology and Anthropology.\nReniers & Tfaily: Polygyny and HIV in Malawi\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org\n1. Background\nIn early scientific, policy, and popular discourses around HIV/AIDS, polygyny often\nfeatures as a cultural practice that facilitates the spread of the epidemic (Gausset 2001;\nOppong and Kalipeni 2003). The association between polygyny and HIV, however, is\nnot very often empirically verified. In theory, there are several plausible reasons why\npolygyny may contribute to the spread of HIV. First, polygynous marriages involve\nmultiple partners, each of whom might introduce HIV into the household. Once one of\nthe spouses is or becomes HIV positive, the others are also exposed to HIV. The\nsimultaneous nature of partnerships in polygynous unions is likely to have an\nindependent effect on the spread of the virus (net of the quantum of partnerships): under\nserial monogamy earlier partners are not at risk of being infected by later partners; in\nconcurrent relationships, the protective effect of the sequence is lost (Morris and\nKretzschmar 1997). Concurrency of partnerships is considered particularly important\nfor HIV because the probability of transmitting the virus is highest in the period\nimmediately following seroconversion (Morris and Kretzschmar 1997; Wawer, et al.\n2005).4 Second, men in societies where polygyny is practiced tend to marry at a later\nage and more often have casual sexual partnerships in early adulthood (Caldwell, et al.\nendorses the belief that men require more than one woman for sexual satisfaction\n(Caldwell, et al. 1993). Fourth, polygynous societies are often also characterized by\nhigh rates of marital dissolution and the easy remarriage of widows and divorcees\n1990). This may lead to an increase in the total number of sexual partners over a man's\nor a woman's lifetime.\nOn the other hand, it is sometimes argued that polygyny contains the spread of\nHIV because it limits the incidence of extra-marital sex (Caldwell, et al. 1993; Carael,\nThe empirical evidence for a concurrency effect on the spread of HIV and other STDs is, however, mixed.\nIn a study on the spread of Herpes Simplex, Halton and colleagues found that the risk of infection was as high\nin women whose husbands were polygynous as in those whose husbands had a prior marriage (Halton, et al.\n2003). This suggests that it is the number of partners one has had, and not necessarily the concurrency of\nthese relationship that affects the spread of STDs. This was also suggested by Lagarde and colleagues who\nwere not able to show that concurrency of sexual partnerships facilitates the spread of HIV (Lagarde, et al.\n2001). Convincing evidence for a concurrency effect on HIV incidence and prevalence in the Rakai district in\nrural Uganda could not be found either (Kelly 2001). In a study on Chlamydia transmission in Colorado,\nhowever, concurrency was identified as the most powerful predictor of transmission (Potterat, et al. 1999).\nA greater permissiveness of extra-marital sex is sometimes associated with the practice of prolonged post-\npartum abstinence (Cleland, et al. 1999; Orubuloye, et al. 1997). Men in polygynous unions, however, could\nchange partners within marriage, and thus have less of an incentive to engage in non-marital sex than\nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 53\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 1813\nstudies found partial evidence that men (and women) in polygynous unions have more\nextra-marital affairs than their counterparts in monogamous marriages (Carael, et al.\npartnerships are less common among polygynous men and more frequent among\nwomen in polygynous unions (Nnko, et al. 2004).\nIn this article, we study the relationship between polygyny and HIV infection in\nrural Malawi and try to disentangle the process that leads to different infection rates in\npolygynous and monogamous unions. We first describe the relationship between\npolygyny and HIV, and find that HIV prevalence is higher among those in polygynous\ncompared to monogamous unions. With that in mind, we investigate two mechanisms\nthat could lead to higher prevalence rates in men and women who are in polygynous\nunions: (1) partners in polygynous unions have more extra-marital relationships and\nthus increase each other's exposure to HIV; (2) women who are recruited into a\npolygynous union are more likely to be HIV positive than those who marry a\nmonogamous husband. In addition to these two mechanisms, variation in HIV\nprevalence rates by union type is also possibly due to a `polygyny-effect', or, in other\nwords, due to the fact that individuals in polygynous unions are part of a sexual\nnetwork with concurrent partnerships.\nWe study the first of these hypotheses using reports of spousal infidelity and assess\nwhether extra-marital sexual relationships are higher in polygynous compared to\nmonogamous unions. To test the second hypothesis we need to investigate selection of\nspouses into polygynous marriages based on their HIV status. Because the sample size\nand number of HIV positive cases is too small to permit such an analysis, we focus\ninstead on two risk factors of HIV, namely widowhood and marriage order. We thus\ninvestigate whether widows are more often selected into polygynous unions than\ndivorcees and analyze whether marriage order correlates with selection into a\npolygynous marriage. Both multiple marriages and widowhood are considered risk\nfactors for being HIV positive; an assumption for which we provide some evidence as\nwell.\nWe use data from the adult samples of the Malawi Diffusion and Ideational Change\nproject (MDICP). These are longitudinal survey data collected in the rural areas of three\ndistricts with approximately 1,500 ever-married women and their husbands who have\nReniers & Tfaily: Polygyny and HIV in Malawi\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org\n2004 respondents were counseled and tested for HIV.7 HIV prevalence in the sample is\nUnless stated otherwise, we rely on retrospectively reported marriage histories collected\nas part of MDICP2. For each respondent, these histories contain information on the\npresent (or most recent if not currently married), previous and first marriage. This\nmeans that the marriage histories are incomplete for those who married more than three\ntimes. This is not of great importance because only five and two percent of men and\nwomen, respectively, have incomplete marriage histories. The dataset has information\non the beginning, duration and outcome of marriages, as well as on a number of\nmarriage characteristics such as the residence pattern during marriage, the age\ndifference between spouses, whether or not the husband is or was polygynous, and\nwhether there was any suspicion of spousal adultery.8 From these histories, we created\na dataset of marriages that will be used in several of the analyses that are presented\nbelow. Compared to DHS surveys or censuses, which typically provide information on\ncurrent status, this is an exceptionally rich data source because it gives an insight into\nthe marriage trajectories rather than a snapshot in time. Retrospective reporting,\nhowever, may be subject to bias because of the problematic reporting of ages and dates,\nthe ex post facto rationalization of decision-making processes, and possibly because of\na greater propensity to omit short unsuccessful unions from marriage histories as time\npasses. Retrospective reporting also implies that the information is confined to those\nwho survived and were present at the time of the survey.\nThe sample is ethnically and religiously heterogeneous. Rumphi in the north is\ncharacterized by a predominantly patrilineal system of descent with patrilocal residence\nafter marriage. The ethnic groups in Balaka in the south follow a matrilineal system of\nfiliation, and residence after marriage is most often matrilocal. In Mchinji, in the center\nof the country, descent is less rigidly matrilineal, and residence may be either matrilocal\nor patrilocal. The southern district is predominantly Muslim; Christians are in the\nmajority in the other two areas. The Tumbuka are the main ethnic group in Rumphi, the\nA description of the project, survey instruments and data is available at http://www.malawi.pop.upenn.edu,\nand in a special collection of Demographic Research (Watkins, et al. 2003). Bignami et al (2003) report on\ndata quality and sample attrition.\nThe testing protocol is summarized in Bignami et al. (2004), response rates are discussed in Obare et al.\n(Forthcoming).\nMarriage outcome (if ended) is defined as either divorced or widowed. Separation is very rare and combined\nwith the category `divorced'. The measure of polygyny used in this article is based on two questions: (1)\nwhether or not the husband (or respondent if male) had any other wives at the time of marriage, and (2)\nwhether the husband (or respondent) married an additional wife (or wives) during the marriage under\nconsideration. A marriage is considered polygynous if any of those two questions was answered affirmatively.\nThe measure of suspected adultery is clarified in section 4.\nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 53\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 1815\nChewa in Mchinji, and the Yao in Balaka. Because of this cultural heterogeneity, we\ncontrol for district in most of our statistical models.\nMarriage in Malawi is quasi-universal but divorce rates are high, with some\nvariation across the three research sites: in the south, over 50 percent of first marriages\ndissolve within 15 years and in the two other districts, this figure is between 30 and 40\npercent. Part of this discrepancy is related to the matrilineal system of filiation that\npredominates in most southern ethnic groups wherein marriage dissolution is\n3. Polygyny and HIV prevalence in Malawi\nThere are quite important regional differences in the level of polygyny. The percentage\nof married women with one or more co-wives, and the percentage of married men with\nmore than one spouse are highest in the north and lowest in the southern region (Table\n1). For a number of reasons, the indices of polygyny in the sample are higher than\nthose reported in the 2004 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) (NSO and ORC\nMacro 2005). First, the MDICP sample is drawn from exclusively rural settings where\npolygyny levels are generally higher. Second, in MDCIP1 the sampling frame consisted\nof ever-married women and their husbands. In MDICP2 other and new spouses of\nalready sampled men and women were also interviewed, thereby increasing the share of\nwomen married to a polygynous husband. Third, the measure of polygyny in the DHS\nreflects current status, whereas the definition used here categorizes a marriage as\npolygynous when the husband had another wife at any time during the marriage under\nconsideration (see also footnote 5). Fourth, the MDICP data pertain to all (i.e., current,\nprevious and first) marriages of men and women in the sample. If polygyny levels have\ndeclined over time, the polygyny indices reported in Table 1 should be lower in the\nMalawi DHS compared to MDICP data because the DHS only contains information on\nthe current marriage.9 Rather than a nuisance, however, the over-representation of\npolygynous marriages in our sample is a convenient statistical feature because it\nincreases the power of statistical tests.\nAs shown in Table 1, the percentage of women with one or more co-wives declined between 1992 and 2004,\nwhile the decline in the percentage of polygynous men during the same period was modest or non-existent. In\nvan de Walle's (Van de Walle 1968) terminology this suggests a decline in the intensity of polygyny (i.e., a\ndecrease in the average number of wives of each polygynyst) rather than a decline in the incidence of\npolygyny (i.e., the proportion of married men with more than one wife). A decline in the fraction of women\nwith co-wives has been reported for several (not all) African countries (Antoine 2002; Westoff 2003).\nReniers & Tfaily: Polygyny and HIV in Malawi\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org\nTable 1: Prevalence of polygyny and HIV in the three regions of the DHS\nsurvey and sample districts of the MDICP (in percent)\nSouth Central North\nPercentage of currently married women with one or more co-wives\nPercentage of currently married men with more than one spouse\nMDICP\nBalaka Mchinji Rumphi\nPercentage of marriages in which the respondent (women's\nPercentage of marriages in which the respondent (men's reports)\nIn terms of HIV prevalence, the levels in the DHS sample are higher than those in\nthe MDICP. This is mainly because the latter pertain to an exclusively rural population.\nThe central region is an exception, and that is possibly due to the uncharacteristically\nhigh refusal rates in the DHS survey in the central region (particularly in Lilongwe\nwhere less than 40 percent of the respondents were tested) (NSO and ORC Macro\n2005). Polygyny is most common in the district (Rumphi) where HIV infection rates\nare the lowest. In Balaka, where HIV prevalence is the highest, polygyny is least\ncommon. At the aggregate level, polygyny thus negatively correlates with HIV\nprevalence. At the individual level the association is positive:10 the odds for being HIV\n10 A similar, albeit reversed, disparity has previously been identified for the relationship between polygyny\nand fertility (Ezeh 1997; Pebley and Mbugua 1989): these studies have found that women in polygynous\nunions tend to have lower fertility than women in monogamous unions, but populations that practice\npolygyny usually have higher fertility rates compared to populations where polygyny is uncommon.\nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 53\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 1817\na polygynous union than among men who have not had any concurrent spouses. The\nThese differences persist after controlling for district and age (Table 2, model 1).\nThis is particularly so for polygynous men who are about three times more likely to be\nHIV positive than monogamously married men. The odds for being HIV positive are\nsignificantly higher among women who have been \u00ador still are\u00ad married to polygynous\nhusbands compared to women who have been in unions with monogamous husbands\nonly. That relationship appears to be stronger for second and third wives than for first\nwives, but the differences are not statistically significant (p=0.18) and omitted from the\nfinal model.\nOne of the mechanisms that could produce a difference in HIV prevalence rates in\npolygynous and monogamous unions is a difference in the number of marriages. To test\nwhether this has an effect on HIV status and to verify whether it absorbs some of the\nvariance in HIV prevalence attributed to polygyny, we introduce marriage order as an\nadditional explanatory variable in the analyses. For women, having been married more\nthan once correlates significantly with HIV status, and reduces the effect of having ever\nbeen in a polygynous marriage. Controlling for marriage order entirely absorbs the\neffect \u00adif any\u00ad of wife's rank (not shown). The parameter estimates for the polygyny\nvariable, however, remain significant, and that implies that marriage order alone cannot\nexplain the variance in prevalence rates by polygyny status.12\nThe test is less straightforward for men because polygyny implies multiple\npartners by definition. In their case, we compare prevalence rates for those who are or\nhave been in precisely two formal unions and those who are or have been in at least\nthree marriages. The effects are of a similar magnitude as for women, but not\nstatistically significant; perhaps because the small sample size limits statistical power.\n11 This positive association is also reproduced for each of the three districts separately. For men the\nrelationship is only statistically significant for Mchinji. There are, however, only 40 HIV positive men in the\nsample and that contributes to the low statistical power of the tests. In the MDHS, the odds that a polygynous\nman (current status) tested positive are lower than those for a monogamous man, but these values are not\nstatistically significant (OR: 0.65, 95%-CI: 0.39 - 1.14). For women, the value is closer to what we find in the\n12 Marriage order is strongly associated with the probability of marrying a polygynous husband (which ranges\nfrom 34.81 percent for women in their first marriages to 76.60 percent for women in third or higher order\nmarriages). Marriage order is also correlated with the probability of becoming a second (or higher order-\nranked) wife of a polygynous husband (from 12.85 percent for women in first marriages to 56.03 percent for\nthose in second or higher order marriages) (not shown). This finding concurs with earlier reports that first and\nhigher order wives of polygynous husbands often have diverging characteristics (Tim\u00e6us and Reynar 1998).\nReniers & Tfaily: Polygyny and HIV in Malawi\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org\nTable 2: Risk factors of HIV+ status (odds ratios)\nWomen Men\nDistrict (vs Balaka)\nMarriage order (vs 1st marriage)\nSource: Malawi Diffusion and Ideational Change Project (MDICP2)\n* Significant at 10%; ** significant at 5%; *** significant at 1%. Absolute value of z statistics in parentheses\na For men, marriage order is defined irrespective of the outcome of the previous marriage. Analysis pertains to higher order\nmarriages only. The second marriage is the reference category.\nSo far, we have presented evidence that HIV prevalence rates are higher in\npolygynous unions, and this does not seem to be a simple function of the respondent's\nnumber of formal unions. In what follows we investigate two processes that could lead\nto higher HIV prevalence in men and women in polygynous unions, namely differences\nin (risky) sexual behavior between men and women in monogamous and polygynous\nunions and the adverse selection of HIV positive women into polygynous unions.\nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 53\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 1819\n4. Polygyny and adultery\nTo test the association between polygyny and risky sexual behavior, we compare the\nfrequency of extra-marital sex in monogamous and polygynous unions. To do so we\nrely on self reports of adultery and on spousal reports of \u00adthe suspicion of\u00ad adultery.\nThe suspicion of adultery was operationalized via the survey question: \"During your\ntime together, did/do you suspect or know that your husband/wife had/has sexual\nrelations with other women/men apart from you\". Women of polygynous men were\ntold that this did not include co-wives.13 The suspicion of spousal infidelity is reported\nby women in 33.2 percent of the marriages and by men in 14.5 percent of the marriages.\nSelf-reports of adultery are lower: men report extra-marital affairs in 19.5 percent of the\nmarriages and women only in 2.5 percent of the cases. These percentages are virtually\nthe same if the analysis is restricted to first marriages only.\nThe statistical model that we use to test the association between polygyny and\nadultery is a binary logistic regression where reported (suspicion of) adultery is the\noutcome. We do this for both men (Table 3) and women (Table 4). Men who are in\npolygynous marriages are 50 percent more likely to self-report extra-marital affairs than\nmen in monogamous unions, an effect that remains stable after controlling for\ndemographic, socioeconomic, and residence variables. The odds that women in\npolygynous marriages suspect their husband of infidelity are about three times the odds\nof women in monogamous unions. The effect becomes even stronger after controlling\nfor demographic and residency variables.\nIn terms of the control variables, we find that reports of male adultery decline with\nan increasing age at marriage. The effect of marriage period suggests that adultery has\ndecreased over time (Reniers 2008). Educated men are about 66 percent more likely to\nself-report infidelity than their uneducated counterparts, but education does not seem to\nmatter for spousal reports of adultery. Having a spouse who lives in the same village is\nnegatively associated with reports of adultery. This probably indicates that adultery is a\nmatter of opportunity and social control. Because its effect is only significant for\nspousal reports of adultery and not self-reports, it may also be due to women's\nuncertainty about the behavior of absent spouses. Regardless of the effects of these\ncontrols, the main conclusion from this analysis remains that polygynous men more\noften have extra-marital affairs (measured via self reports as well as reports by their\nspouses), which could contribute to the difference in HIV prevalence rates between\nindividuals in polygynous and monogamous unions.\n13 Unfortunately, the survey instructions did not include explicit guidelines for coding sex with women who\nwere to become future wives.\nReniers & Tfaily: Polygyny and HIV in Malawi\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org\nTable 3: Predictors of adultery (odds ratios), men\nSelf-reports Wife's suspicion\nDistrict (vs Balaka)\nSource: Malawi Diffusion and Ideational Change Project (MDICP2)\n* Significant at 10%; ** significant at 5%; *** significant at 1%. Robust z statistics in parentheses (adjusted for clustering on\nrespondent)\nVariable definitions: age at marriage: age at the beginning of the marriage (in the analysis of self-reports, the age at marriage refers\nto the husbands age at marriage; in the analysis where we use the wife's suspicion of the husband's adultery, the value of the\nage at marriage pertains to the wife. Because the ages of spouses are positively correlated, the interpretation of the effects in\nthe two cases is similar); spousal age difference: husband is more than five years older than his wife versus less than that\n(reference category); year of marriage: calendar year at the start of the marriages; education: a minimum of three years of\neducation versus less than that (reference category); ethnic homogenous marriages: unions where both spouses are of the\nsame ethnicity versus couples where the spouses are of a different ethnicity (reference category); spouse lives in same village\nor not (reference category).\nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 53\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 1821\nFor women there does not seem to be any substantial difference in extra-marital\nrelationships between those in polygynous and monogamous unions: although the\nparameter values point in the same direction as those for men, they are smaller and lack\nstatistical significance (Table 4). In Balaka, where the Yao follow a predominantly\nmatrilineal system of decent, the reports of female adultery are higher than in the other\ntwo districts. This is consistent with anthropological commentary that women in\nmatrilineal groups exercise greater control over their sexuality and offspring (Caldwell,\net al. 1992). The other factors influencing infidelity among women are quite similar to\nthose for men: educated women are more likely to self-report extra-marital affairs than\ntheir less educated counterparts, and reports of adultery are less common in recent\nmarriages, and when partners co-residence in the same village. Combined, Tables 3 and\n4 thus provide evidence that polygynous men (but not women) are more likely to\nengage in risky sexual behavior than monogamously married men and thus increase\ntheir own as well as their spouses' risk of HIV infection.\nTable 4: Predictors of adultery (odds ratios), women\nSelf-reports Husband's suspicion\nDistrict (vs Balaka)\nReniers & Tfaily: Polygyny and HIV in Malawi\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org\nTable 4: (continued)\nSelf-reports Husband's suspicion\nSource: Malawi Diffusion and Ideational Change Project (MDICP2)\n* Significant at 10%; ** significant at 5%; *** significant at 1%. Robust z statistics in parentheses (adjusted for clustering on\nrespondent)\nVariable definitions: see table 3\n5. Selection of HIV positive women into polygynous unions\nA direct assessment of the selection of HIV positive women into polygynous unions\nrequires a measure of HIV status for all women at the time of marriage. Unfortunately,\nthese data are not available. Instead, we examine selection processes with respect to\ncharacteristics that are measurable and that correlate with HIV status. One of them is\nwidowhood, and we therefore compare the likelihood that widows and divorcees\nbecome part of a polygynous union. The odds for being HIV positive are about 78\npercent higher (p=.12) for a widow than for a divorcee (controlling for district and\nage).14 Adding an additional control for having been in a polygynous union barely\nchanges that relationship. For adverse selection into polygynous marriages to account\nfor (part of) the difference in HIV prevalence rates between polygynous and\nmonogamous households, women whose previous husband(s) died should be\ndisproportionately found in marriages with a polygynous husband.15\nThe other predictor that we consider is marriage order. Here we postulate that\nmarriage order correlates with HIV status (see Table 2), and that women at higher order\nmarriages are disproportionately recruited into marriages with polygynous men. In\n15 In a different study, remarriage rates of widows were found to be lower than those of divorcees (particularly\nin the 1990s), most likely because an increasing share of widows are surviving spouses of AIDS victims and\ntherefore not very attractive marriage partners (Reniers 2008). In this article, we are merely interested in\nexplaining differences in HIV prevalence by marriage type. The analysis therefore conditions on remarriage.\nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 53\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 1823\nthese analyses we define a polygynous husband as someone who had at least one other\nspouse at the time of marriage. The tests for both of these selection processes are\ncarried out by means of a binary logistic regression model whereby the marriage type is\nthe outcome of interest and widowhood (versus divorced status, Table 5, model 1) and\nmarriage order (Table 5, model 2) are the predictors.\nIn addition to our earlier finding that the prevalence of polygyny varies by district,\nwe learn from Table 5 that the frequency of polygynous marriages increases with\nwomen's age at marriage: the older a woman, the more likely she is to marry a\npolygynist. The quadratic effect for age at marriage indicates that the odds of marrying\na polygynous husband follow a curvilinear pattern with an inflection point around age\n36. Widows are, as expected, more likely to remarry a polygynous husband, but the\neffect is relatively small and not statistically significant.16\nThe effect of marriage order is much stronger and highly significant: the odds that\na woman will marry a polygynous husband are about three times higher in a second\nmarriage than in a first marriage, and the association gains strength with marriage order.\nInterestingly, marriage order is also a better predictor of HIV status than widowhood\n(when compared to divorce). In these analyses, we thus find support for the proposition\nthat HIV positive women are more likely to be selected into polygynous marriages than\nmonogamous unions.\n16 The lack of a strong effect is also an indication that levirate or widow inheritance is probably not very\nimportant in Malawi (at least not to the extent that it would lead to noticeable differences between widows\nand divorcees in their likelihood of remarrying a polygynous husband). Because levirate is uncommon in\nethnic groups with matrilineal descent systems, we tested for an interaction (not statistically significant)\nbetween widowed and district.\nReniers & Tfaily: Polygyny and HIV in Malawi\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org\nTable 5: Characteristics affecting marriage to a polygynous husband\n(women only, odds ratios)\nDistrict (vs Balaka)\nMarriage order (vs 1st marriage)\nSource: Malawi Diffusion and Ideational Change Project (MDICP2)\n* Significant at 10%; ** significant at 5%; *** significant at 1%.

This effect, however, does not reach statistical significance either\n(z=1.04). Both interactions are omitted from the final model.\nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 53\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 1825\n6. Discussion\nWe began with the observation that HIV prevalence rates in Malawi are higher among\nthose who have been in a polygynous union compared to those who have been in\nmonogamous marriages only. We proposed and tested two mechanisms that could\nproduce such a difference and found evidence for each of those processes. First,\npolygynously married men more often engage in extra-marital affairs than monogamous\nmen, a result that holds for both self-reports and spousal suspicion of adultery. For\nwomen, the evidence points in a similar direction but does not reach the same level of\nstatistical significance. Our data do not allow us to investigate why polygynous men are\npresumably less faithful than monogamous men. Possible explanations are that these\nmen have a greater disposition for multiple partners, that they are searching for new\nspouses, or, that they experience less objection from their current wife or wives.\nSelection is another avenue that can produce higher HIV prevalence rates in polygynous\nunions. Although our evidence is indirect, women who are more likely to be HIV\npositive (e.g., women who have been married before) more often join polygynous\nunions. An alternative explanation for the relatively high HIV prevalence in members\nof polygynous unions, namely the concurrency of sexual relationships, can be neither\nrejected nor confirmed with the available data.\nA puzzling feature of the study site is that the highest HIV prevalence rates are\nfound in the district where polygyny is least common (and vice versa). Using the\nevidence at hand, it is not possible to explain the difference in individual and aggregate-\nlevel correlations between polygyny and HIV.17 Unobserved factors are a likely\ncandidate, but a more intriguing hypothesis is one that implies a strong selection of HIV\npositive individuals into polygynous households. As we have observed in this study,\nthis could contribute to a positive individual-level correlation between polygyny and\nHIV. However, if the selection is strong and the sexual networks of men and women\nwho are in polygynous unions are sufficiently distinct from those who are in\nmonogamous unions, they could have the potential to contain aggregate HIV prevalence\nrates in populations where polygyny is practiced compared to those that are more\nexclusively monogamous. Another factor that may help to contain the spread of HIV in\npopulations that practice polygyny is a reduction in the frequency of intercourse in\nconjugal units of polygynous marriages. Such a coital dilution effect has been\nrecognized early on in studies of differential fertility in polygynous and monogamous\nmarriages (Musham 1956), and it might as well affect HIV incidence in serodiscordant\ncouples with a polygynous husband.\nIncidentally, HIV prevalence is also much lower in western Africa where polygyny rates are usually much\nhigher than in the eastern and southeastern Africa. A similar observation has been made by Frank (1992).\nReniers & Tfaily: Polygyny and HIV in Malawi\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org\n7.
