Overall, 24.8% of participants\nhad evidence of H. pylori infection. Infection was strongly associated with increasing age Wtrend,\nP < .01) and being nonwhite (17.0% of non-Hispanic whites vs. 40.1% of non-Hispanic blacks and\n42.0%of Mexican Americans infected). In a multivariate logisticregression model, H. pylori infection\nwas significantly associated with increasing age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.07/year), being nonwhite (non-\nHispanic black OR = 2.6 or Mexican American OR = 1.8), poverty (OR = 1.5), crowding (OR =\n5.6), and- head of household education level (OR = 1.8). In Mexican Americans, infection was\nassociated with birth outside the United States or Canada in the univariate analyses but was not\nsignificantly associated after adjustment for age, poverty, crowding, and head of household education\nlevel.\nHelicobacter pylori is recognized to be a major cause of\ntype B gastritis and is strongly associated with duodenal and\ngastric ulcer disease and possibly with the development of\ngastric cancer [1, 2]. Over the past decade, a number of studies\nhave described the epidemiologic characteristics of this im-\nportant pathogen; however, methodologic shortcomings have\nlimited their interpretation. Only three population-based studies\nhave been done [3-5], one in children [3] and none in a US\npopulation. We examined the prevalence of H. pylori infection\nin a representative sample of children and adolescents in the\nUnited States and identified subgroups who may be at increased\nrisk for infection.\nMethods\nSurvey design.

NHANES III was conducted from 1988 through\npresented here are from phase 1 (October 1988 through October\nNHANES III is based on a multistage probability-sample design.\nChildren <5 years of age, persons ~60 years of age, Mexican\nAmericans, and non-Hispanic blacks are included in the survey at\na higher rate than other persons. To produce national estimates, the\nresults for each person are weighted to account for the differential\nprobabilities of selection and response [6]. Details of the sample\ndesign have been published elsewhere [7].\nLaboratory methods. H. pylori IgG concentrations were de-\ntermined using an ELISA according to the manufacturer's in-\nstructions (PYLORI STAT; Whittaker Bioproducts, Walk-\nersville, MD). A predictive index value was calculated, and if\nthe value was equivocal, that subject was excluded from the\nstudy (n = 131). In children, the PYLORI STAT ELISA has a\nreported sensitivity of 96% and a specificity of 94%, with posi-\ntive and negative predictive values of 92% and 97%, respec-\ntively [8].\nVariables. Three mutually exclusive racial and ethnic\ngroups were created on the basis of the NHANES III sample\ndesign; non-Hispanic whites (whites), non-Hispanic blacks\n(blacks), and Mexican Americans. Persons not included in one\nof these groups were included only in the estimates for the total\npopulation.\nThe level of education of the head of household was dichoto-\nmized to either less than a high school education or at least a\nhigh school education. The poverty-index ratio was calculated by\ndividing the total family income by the poverty threshold adjusted\nfor family size for the year of the interview [9, 10]. A poverty\nindex ratio < 1 was considered to indicate poverty. A crowding\nindex ratio was calculated by dividing the total number of persons\nin the household by the number of rooms in the household exclud-\ning bathrooms.\nUrbanicity was based on the subject's place of residence and\nwas categorizedas urban or nonurban by Bureau of Census defini-\ntions for size of place.\nThe variableUS/Canadian-bornwas created and limited to Mex-\nican-Americanparticipants, because the sample size for whites and\nblacks was too small to be included in the analysis.\nCurrent household exposure to pets, exposure to cats and dogs\nspecifically, and day care attendance (available for 6- to 16-year-\nolds) were examined. We were unable to evaluate water supply\nas a risk factor since the majority of participants used private or\npublic company water. Breast-feeding information was available\nonly for children <6 years of age and therefore could not be\nanalyzed in our study.\nStatistical analysis. All prevalence estimates were weighted\nto account for oversampling, lack of response to the household\ninterview, and lack of physical examination. Population estimates\nwere based on weights stratified according to the Census Bureau's\nStandard errors were calculated with SUDAAN, statistical soft-\nware designed for complex surveys [12]. Multivariate analyses\nwere done using logistic regression. The weighted odds ratios\n(ORs) and 95%confidenceintervals were based on SEs incorporat-\ning the complex sample design.\nThe possibility of any interaction between a potential risk factor\nand ethnicity was explored using logistic regression analysis. No\ninteraction terms reached significance at P ~ .10.\nIndependentpredictors for H. pylori infection for the combined\npopulation were determined using stepwise multivariate logistic\nregression modeling procedures with P ~ .05. Separate models\ncontaining these predictors were also done for each of the ethnic\ngroups.\nSince, often, there were multiple subjects from the same house-\nhold in our sample, the analyses were repeated on a subset con-\nsisting of one subject randomly selected from each household.\nResults\nantibodies to H. pylori (table 1). The prevalence of infection\ntest for trend, P < .01). There were no significant gender\ndifferences for any ethnic group. A significantly higher propor-\ntion of blacks (40.1%) and Mexican Americans (42%) had\nevidence of infection compared with whites (17.0%). Because\nof the strong effect of ethnicity on the prevalence of infection,\nthe analyses in table 1 were stratified by ethnicity. Table 1\nshows seroprevalence estimates for each variable in the total\npopulation and in each ethnic group.\nPoverty was associated with higher estimates of infection in\nthe total population (P < .01) and in each ethnic group, though\nthis variable was significant only in Mexican Americans (P <\n.01). Children living in households in which the head of house-\nhold had less than a high school education had a significantly\nhigher prevalence of infection in the total population and each\nethnic group. Crowding was significantly associated with\nhigher estimates ofinfection in the total population and among\nblacks and Mexican Americans (P < .01).\nMexican Americans born outside the United States or Can-\nada were found to have significantly higher estimates of infec-\ntion (58.4%) than those born in the United States or Canada\nThe presence of a pet in the household was associated with\na lower estimate of infection in the total population (P < .01),\nalthough not significant in any group. In addition, exposure to\ncats but not dogs was associated with a lower estimate in the\ntotal population (P < .01).\nFor the total population and each ethnic group, children who\nattended day care were less likely to be infected than those\nwho had not; however, only for the total population did the\nprevalence estimate reach statistical significance. For Mexican\nAmericans, those residing in nonurban areas had a significantly\nhigher estimate of H. pylori infection than those in urban areas.\nIndependent predictors of H. pylori infection were deter-\nmined by logistic regression (table 2). The following were all\nsignificant predictors: increasing age (OR = 1.07/year), being\nblack (OR = 2.6) or Mexican American (OR = 1.8), living in\npoverty (OR = 1.5), educational level (OR = 1.8), and the\nhighest level of crowding (OR = 5.6).\nOur analysis with one randomly selected subject from each\nhousehold yielded results similar to those presented.\nDiscussion\nWe used data from NHANES III to produce the first popula-\ntion-based estimates of the prevalence of H. pylori infection\nin the United States and explored relationships of various risk\nfactors for infection. The overall prevalence of infection in our\nstudy was higher than previously published estimates of 5%-\n15% for US children and adolescents [1]. In fact, prevalence\nestimates in blacks and Mexican Americans in NHANES III\nare closer to those in developing than developed countries [2].\nThis higher prevalence in the United States is most likely due\nto a more accurate measurement of risk in a representative\nsample of the US population rather than in persons in selected\ngroups.\nThe prevalence of H. pylori infection increased with age, as\nhas been seen in other studies. The design of the study is cross-\nsectional and it is therefore not possible to determine whether\nthis increased risk is due to a cohort effect. However, with the\nnarrow age range in our study population, a cohort effect seems\nunlikely as an explanation of this finding.\nAlthough previous reports of estimates in US children and\nadolescents have been lower than the estimates in our study,\ntwo studies examining H. pylori and ethnicity in US children\nfound slightly higher estimates of infection. A study in an\nArkansas hospital population found black children had more\ninfection (50%) than white children (25%) [13]. Similarly, in\na New Orleans study, 49% of black and 32% of white children\nreceiving medical care at two hospitals were infected [14].\nTable 1.

Independent predictors of H pylori infection determined\nby multivariate analysis.\nThese findings may be explained by selection factors such as\nage distribution, socioeconomic status, geography, and hospi-\ntal-based samples ofpersons who may be in poorer health than\nthe general population.\nOther studies, like ours, have shown H. pylori infection to\nbe more prevalent in groups with low socioeconomic status [4,\n13-15]. In the Arkansas study, H. pylori was more common\nin children from low-income than from high-income families,\neven within racial categories [13]. Two studies of adults in\nWales found age-specific prevalence of H. pylori to be highest\nin adults in the lowest social or manual classes [4, 15]. In\naddition to poverty, we found that the education level of the\nhead of household was an important predictor of H. pylori\ninfection.\nSeveral studies, like ours, have shown crowding to be a\nrisk factor for H. pylori infection. In Wales, adults sharing\na bedroom in childhood were more likely to be infected with\nH. pylori than those not sharing a bedroom [15]. Similarly,\nin London, domestic crowding in childhood was found to be\nan independent risk factor for current infection in adults\nVariable\nIncreasing age, years\nEthnicity\nNon-Hispanic white*\nNon-Hispanic black\nMexican American\nCrowding index (persons/room)\nPoverty index\nBelow poverty line\nAt or above poverty line*\nHead of household education level, years\n* Reference group.\nAdjusted 95% confidence\nodds ratio interval\nAmong Mexican Americans, birth outside the United States was\nan important risk factor for infection in the univariate analysis.\nHowever, in the multivariate analysis, this variable did not remain\nsignificant.To clarify whether foreign-born status had a modulating\ninfluence on the effects of crowding and poverty, the possibility of\ninteraction was examined. No interaction was found; however,\nsmall sample sizes precluded more detailed analysis.\nThe decreased estimates of infection in subjects attending day\ncare and insubjects exposed to pets most likely represent surrogate\nmeasures of higher socioeconomic status. Neither day care nor\npet ownership was significantly associated with infection in the\nmultivariate analysis.\nOur results support previous associations with socioeconomic\nfactors such as poverty and education level but add ethnicity and\ncrowding as additional important risk factors for infection. The\ndifferences between ethnic groups may be attributed to genetic,\nsocial, or cultural differences. There may be an increase in suscep-\ntibility among blacks and Mexican Americans or there may be\nmore intense exposure, possibly due to a higher prevalence of\ninfection in family members. Sanitation practices may also play\na role, since increased prevalence was consistently seen in groups\nwith a lower socioeconomic level and crowded living conditions.\nFurther exploration of the reasons for the dramatic differences\nbetween whites and nonwhites should be examined.\nWith the large numbers of children infected with H pylori,\nquestions arise with regard to screening and management of chil-\ndren for this infection. At this time the natural history ofinfection\nin children is unclear. Risk factors for development of symptom-\natic disease and the later consequences of infection have not yet\nbeen determined. The personal and economic costs of these dis-\neases in the United States and worldwide emphasize the need to\nunderstand the impact of early infection. An important finding of\nthis study is that even in developed countries such as the United\nStates, H pylori may be acquired very early in life. This informa-\ntion will aid researchers in determining whether and when to\nimmunize children once vaccines become available.\n"
