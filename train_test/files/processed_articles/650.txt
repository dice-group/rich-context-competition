NSFG, National Survey of Family Growth;\nOR, odds ratio.\nIn 1999 in the United States, approximately\nplacement on any given day.1 Many more have\nspent some portion of their lives in foster care. The\nmajority of these children are removed from the care\nof their biological parents because they have been\nor have a parent who is incarcerated or otherwise\nmately 25% of foster children will live in 3 or more\nfoster homes.7\nDuring the past decade, the most common type of\nplacement for these children shifted. Formal kinship\ncare, defined as placement by a child welfare agency\nwith relatives, is now the fastest-growing type of\nout-of-home placement.8 Nationally, the percentage\nof children who are in out-of-home placement and\nwere in formal kinship care increased from 18% in\n50%.10 Increased use of kinship care has resulted\nfrom an increase in the number of children who need\nplacement and a decreased availability of nonrelative\nfoster homes.11,12 However, a growing belief is that\nkinship care may decrease the child's separation anx-\niety because placement with familiar caregivers may\nbe a pathway toward family preservation.13,14\nThe growth in the reliance on formal kinship care\nhas outpaced research that assesses its value as an\nalternative to traditional foster care.15 The majority\nof studies on the health and well-being of children in\nout-of-home care have focused on children in tradi-\ntional foster care; few have evaluated children in\nformal kinship care,15\u00ad17 and very few have com-\npared the well-being and outcomes of children in\nformal kinship care.18 Sixty percent to 80% of young\nchildren in traditional foster care have at least 1\nmedical problem; 25% have 3 or more. Approxi-\nmately 60% have developmental delays on screening\n(J. Landsverk, unpublished data). The scant litera-\nture that specifically addresses children in formal\nkinship care suggests similar rates of health and\nbehavioral problems.15,16 Furthermore, children in\ntraditional foster care continue to have difficulties in\nadulthood, exhibiting greater educational, marital,\nand risk-taking behavior problems.21\u00ad24 However,\nthe majority of long-term studies have used small\nsamples and often lack comparison groups; thus,\nFrom the *Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado Health Sciences\nCenter (UCHSC); Kempe Children's Center and Department of Pediatrics\nand Psychiatry, UCHSC; \u00a7Department of Preventive Medicine and Biomet-\nrics, UCHSC; and Department of General Internal Medicine, UCHSC,\nDenver, Colorado.\nReprint requests to (S.C.C.) Department of Pediatrics, Kempe Children's\norg\nemy of Pediatrics.\nthey may not apply to broader populations of chil-\ndren in out-of-home care.\nLike formal kinship care, informal kinship care is\nincreasing. This type of living arrangement is not\nsanctioned by a child welfare agency and may occur\nfor reasons other than abuse and neglect. In 1970,\n1.4% of children who were younger than 18 years\nwere living with a relative without a parent; in 1997,\nmillion children were in kinship care, 72% of whom\nwere in an informal arrangement.26\nHigh-risk sexual behavior and early pregnancy\nhave an impact on the health and social well-being of\nadolescents and young adults. Teenage mothers are\nat greater risk for complications. They are less likely\nto receive early prenatal care and more likely to be\npoor.27 Irrespective of these risk factors, young ma-\nternal age itself is associated with greater risk of low\nbirth weight infants and of prematurity.27 In addi-\ntion, adolescent mothers may be less accessible and\nless sensitive to their toddlers and become engaged\nin negative verbal communication.28 The children of\nteenage mothers also are at higher risk for maltreat-\nment and for experiencing a change in their primary\ncaregiver, making teenage pregnancy itself a risk\nfactor for having children in out-of-home place-\nment.29 However, few studies have addressed this\nissue among teenagers who have lived in out-of-\nhome placement.30,31 Recognized predictors of ado-\nlescent pregnancy include membership in a racial/\nethnic minority group, poverty, younger age at\nmenarche, early initiation of sexual intercourse, his-\ntory of sexual abuse, having an older boyfriend, hav-\ning dropped out of school, or exhibiting other high-\nrisk behavior (eg, substance abuse).32,33 It remains\nmore controversial whether childhood physical\nabuse is associated with early sexual intercourse and\npregnancy.34,35 Community environments, parent\u00ad\nchild relationships, school connectedness, and peer\nbehaviors also seem to play a role in the teenager's\ndecision to initiate sexual behavior or become preg-\nkinship care as a risk factor for high-risk sexual be-\nhavior.\nUsing a nationally representative sample of\nwomen, we evaluated the association of foster or\nkinship care with high-risk sexual behavior and early\npregnancy. First, we hypothesized that women who\nlived in foster or kinship care would initiate sexual\nintercourse and become pregnant at a younger age\nand have more sexual partners than women who\nnever experienced out-of-home placement. Second,\ngiven the rapid shift toward placing children in kin-\nship care, we explored whether there was a differ-\nence in these outcomes between those who lived in\nfoster care and those who lived in kinship care.\nMETHODS\nStudy Design\nThis study was a cross-sectional study of the reproductive\noutcomes of women who lived in either foster or kinship care,\ncompared with women who had neither of these experiences.\nData Collection\nThe data used in these analyses were from Cycle 5 of the\nNational Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), a nationally represen-\ntative survey of 10 847 civilian, noninstitutionalized women aged\nidentified from the 1993 National Health Interview Survey. Par-\nticipation in the NSFG was voluntary. Data were collected from\nface-to-face interviews and self-administered audio question-\nnaires from January to October 1995. Black and Hispanic women\nwere oversampled in the survey. Details of the survey, sampling\ndesign, and implementation have been described.39,40\nStudy Population\nFrom the total number of survey respondents, we used the\nrespondents' self-report of their childhood living arrangements to\ndefine 3 subgroups: foster care, kinship care, and a comparison\ngroup. The foster group (n  89) was composed of respondents\nwho stated that they lived with a foster mother and/or a foster\nfather during at least 1 living situation. The kinship group (n \n513) consisted of respondents who lived with any relative and\nwithout either of their biological parents during at least 1 living\nsituation. If the respondent experienced both of the above arrange-\nments, then she was placed in the foster group because this was\nhypothesized to be the higher risk group. The comparison group\n(n  9018) was composed of the remainder of women surveyed.\nWomen were excluded from the analysis if they were foreign\nborn; if they were in the foster or kinship groups and had expe-\nrienced only 1 living situation, to exclude women who never lived\nwith their biological parents and never experienced a change in\ntheir primary caregiver; or if they lived in a group home at any\ntime during their childhood, because this population may differ\nfrom those in either foster or kinship care and is at risk for worse\nDependent Variables\nAge at first sexual intercourse was defined as the age that the\nrespondent reported having her first voluntary sexual intercourse.\nThe age at first conception was defined as the age at first preg-\nnancy. Number of sexual partners was identified using a variable\nrecoded by the staff at the NSFG to include information from both\nthe interviewer-administered and self-administered audio ques-\ntionnaires. Although this was a continuous variable, it was highly\nskewed and was, therefore, dichotomized at the level of the 50th\npercentile for the number of sexual partners in the comparison\ngroup (median number of sexual partners was 3).\nIndependent Variables\nDemographic variables included in the analyses were race/\nethnicity (self-reported), age at the time of interview, educational\nstatus, and whether respondent lived in a rural or an urban\nenvironment at the time of the interview. Maternal and paternal\neducation were defined using the variable for the educational\nstatus of the woman and man that the respondent perceived as\nhaving raised her. Mother's marital status refers to the status of\nthe respondent's mother at the time the respondent was born. This\nvariable and the parental education variables will be used as a\nproxy for household income during the respondent's childhood\nbecause no survey questions directly addressed economic factors\nduring her childhood. A measure of the desire for first sexual\nintercourse was derived from a rating of how much the respon-\ndent desired her first experience of sexual intercourse (not neces-\nsarily her first voluntary intercourse). Childhood sexual abuse was\nconsidered to have occurred in women whose first sexual encoun-\nter occurred before 18 years of age and who responded that they\ndid not want it to occur or that it was a rape.\nStatistical Analysis\nThe data were analyzed using SUDAAN Statistical Software\n(Release 7.5; Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park,\nNC) to account for the multistage, cluster sampling design in the\nNSFG. Bivariate analyses were performed using 2 and student's\nt tests. Differences in outcome and predictor variables were as-\nsessed between the comparison group and both foster and kinship\ngroups and between the foster and kinship groups.\nMultivariate analyses were performed using multiple linear\nregression for the age at first voluntary sex and age at first con-\nception, and multiple logistic regression was used for the median\nnumber of sexual partners. Separate models were constructed for\nthe foster and kinship groups, in relation to the comparison sam-\nple, for each dependent variable. The analyses for the age at first\nconception excluded women who had never been pregnant. The\nanalyses for the age at first voluntary sexual intercourse and for\nthe number of sexual partners excluded women who were not\nsexually active. Among the women who were excluded from the\nanalyses because they had not been sexually active or pregnant,\nthe differences among the foster, kinship, and comparison groups\nparalleled those presented in Table 1 for the group as a whole.\nTo control for potential confounding, we included demograph-\nics, respondent and parental education, maternal marital status,\nand desire for first sexual encounter variables in each model. In\naddition, the age at first voluntary sex was added to the model in\nwhich the number of sexual partners was the dependent variable.\nThe contribution of each variable in explaining the variance of the\nmodel was calculated in the multiple linear regression models. In\nthe multiple logistic regression model, the 2 log likelihood test\nwas performed to assess the significance of each independent\nvariable in the model. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals\nwere calculated for all significant variables.\nGiven the sample sizes of each subgroup and using the age at\nfirst conception as an example, we estimated that the study had\nthe power to detect a difference of 4.2 months in the foster group\nand 1.8 months in the kinship group, relative to the comparison\ngroup. When comparing the foster and kinship groups with each\nother, we estimated that the study could detect a difference of 4.5\nmonths.\nRESULTS\nThe results of the bivariate comparisons are pre-\nsented in Table 1. Although non-Hispanic white\nwomen composed the majority of all 3 groups, the\nkinship group was almost 30% black. In contrast, the\nblack, respectively. In addition, the percentage of\nwomen who were in the foster group and reported\nan unwanted first sexual experience before 18 years\nof age (the proxy variable for sexual abuse) was more\nthan double that in the comparison group (17.7% vs\nthis experience. Both foster and kinship groups dif-\nfered significantly from the comparison group. Re-\ngarding the outcomes of interest, a history of living\nin either foster or kinship care was associated with a\ngreater likelihood of being sexually active (foster vs\ncomparison group: P  .05; kinship vs comparison\ngroup: P  .01) and having been pregnant (foster vs\ncomparison group: P  .01; kinship vs comparison\ngroup: P  .01). Among the dependent variables,\nthere were no significant differences between the\nfoster and kinship groups. Because of this, multivar-\niate regressions comparing the foster and kinship\ngroups are not presented.\nPredictors of First Consensual Sexual Intercourse\nThe mean age of first intercourse in the foster\ngroup was 7.2 months younger and in the kinship\ngroup was 12 months younger than in the compari-\nson group (Table 1). After adjustment for known risk\nfactors (Table 2), having lived in foster care was not\na significant predictor of a younger age at first sex.\nHowever, kinship care was associated with initiation\nof consensual sex 6 months earlier (P  .001). The full\nregression model for the kinship group explained\n22.8% of the variance and for the foster group ex-\nplained 22.5% of the variance in the age at first\nvoluntary sexual intercourse.\nPredictors of Age at First Conception\nThe mean age of first conception in the foster\ngroup was 21.6 months younger and in the kinship\ngroup was 22.8 months younger than in the compar-\nison group (Table 1). After adjustment for the effects\nof the covariates (Table 3), foster care was associated\nwith an age at first conception that was 11.3 months\nyounger (P  .05). Similarly, kinship care was asso-\nciated with a reduction by 8.6 months (P  .001). The\nTABLE 1.

After adjustment for the covariates, foster\nand kinship care remained significant predictors of\nhaving had more than the median number of sexual\npartners (foster group OR: 1.7; kinship group OR:\n1.4) This pattern did not change substantially when\nother cutoffs (eg, the 75th and 95th percentiles) were\nused for the number of sexual partners (Table 4).\nDISCUSSION\nIn our study, living in either foster or kinship care\nwas significantly associated with high-risk reproduc-\ntive behaviors among this nationally representative\nsample of women. Foster care was associated with\nhaving a younger age at first conception and more\nthan the median number of sexual partners. Kinship\ncare was associated with a younger age at both first\nconsensual sex and first conception and with having\nmore than the median number of sexual partners.\nAdjusting for multiple variables that have been as-\nsociated with these outcomes did not negate the\nfindings. Of interest, there were no significant differ-\nences between the foster group and the kinship\ngroup for any of these outcomes. It must be noted,\nhowever, that our data cannot implicate placement\ninto foster and kinship care as the direct cause of\nthese high-risk behaviors. Rather, out-of-home place-\nTABLE 2.

However, preventive ser-\nvices for these youths may not be readily available. A\nrecent survey of all 50 states and the District of\nColumbia, performed by the Child Welfare League\nof America, revealed that child welfare agencies of-\nten lack programs that target sexuality among\nyouths in out-of-home care.42 This study found that\nonly 10 states had written policies that address sex-\nuality education or family planning. One third of the\nstates had caseworker training programs, whereas\nonly 11 states provided training for foster parents.\nAlthough it is crucial that child welfare agencies\naddress this need nationwide, health care providers\nmay be in the best position to identify these children\nand to initiate early intervention services.\nKinship care is gaining in use across the country as\nan alternative to traditional foster care, despite po-\ntential concerns. Kinship care can be viewed as a\nchild-centered, family-focused pathway to family\npreservation. Children who are placed with relatives\nare more likely to maintain a continuity of schools13\nand to know their caregiver. They also may experi-\nence fewer placements overall but often remain in\ncare longer than those who are placed in foster\nplacement of a child with family members who\nraised the parent from whom the child has been\ntaken away.13,44 In addition, kinship caregivers may\nbe less likely to enforce court-ordered restrictions on\nparental visitation.13 Across states, there are incon-\nsistent licensing criteria for kinship caregivers,9,13\nwho also may receive fewer support services and less\nsupervision than traditional foster parents.13,15 As-\nsessing the long-term outcomes of children who are\nraised in kinship care, relative to foster care, may\ngive greater insight into the effects of these different\ntypes of placements.\nIn our study, the women in the foster and kinship\ngroups did not differ from each other, clinically or\nstatistically, with regard to any of the outcomes that\nwe assessed. These findings suggest that living in\nkinship care rather than foster care does not decrease\nthe risk for a female child for adverse long-term\nsexual and reproductive outcomes. The survey does\nnot distinguish women in the kinship group who\nwere formally placed in out-of-home care by a child\nwelfare agency from those who changed caregivers\ninformally. Thus, the kinship group is heteroge-\nneous, including women who changed living situa-\ntions for reasons other than abuse and neglect.\nThis study has several limitations. First, this sur-\nvey was not designed to examine either foster or\nkinship care. There was no randomization to either\nthe foster or kinship groups, which could lead to a\nselection bias in placement. It is not possible to de-\ntermine whether children who experienced more se-\nvere abuse or exhibited worse behavior tended to\nexperience one type of out-of-home placement more\nfrequently than the other. Other variables that are\nrelevant to foster care, such as the duration and\nnumber of placements, were not addressed in this\nstudy. However, despite the lack of adjustment for\nthese placement variables, no differences were seen\nbetween the 2 groups.\nSecond, the NSFG did not collect information on\nthe specific reason that a woman lived in either foster\nor kinship care. Rates of physical or sexual abuse are\nunavailable. This is important because out-of-home\nplacement could be a proxy for sexual abuse in this\nstudy. The literature suggests a prevalence of child-\nhood sexual abuse between 15% and 32% in the\ngeneral population,45\u00ad48 which often is underre-\nported. It is likely that women in the comparison\ngroup also experienced some form of abuse. To ad-\ndress this issue, we examined how much each re-\nspondent desired her first sexual experience as a\nsurrogate for sexual abuse. Although this variable\nlikely underestimates the true prevalence of sexual\nabuse, substantial differences were evident between\nthe comparison and study groups, and this variable\nwas highly significant in all of the models. This sug-\ngests that this proxy variable captured much of the\ntrue sexual abuse.\nA third limitation is that this study represents\nplacement in foster care during the period 1951 to the\nearly 1990s. More recent developments in foster care\nsystems are not reflected here. In addition, secular\nchanges could have an effect on the outcomes eval-\nuated in this article. We attempted to control for this\n\"cohort effect\" by adjusting for the age of the respon-\ndent in the analyses. The effect of secular change\nmay be 1 reason that being an older respondent is\nprotective in the models.\nLast, the outcomes studied are based on the re-\nspondent's self-report; thus, they are subject to recall\nbias. However, the NSFG has been validated exten-\nsively and uses methods that are designed to mini-\nmize this bias as much as possible.39,40\nThe findings in this study have several important\nclinical ramifications. Most important, pediatric and\nadult health care providers should recognize that\nfemale patients who are currently in foster or kinship\ncare or have a history of such a living situation are at\ngreater risk for the earlier initiation of sexual activity\nand for the long-term ramifications of those behav-\niors. Second, this population of children and young\nadults may benefit from collaborative interventions\nand reproductive counseling from health care, edu-\ncation, and child welfare professionals. Last, kinship\ncare may not be more protective than traditional\nfoster care with regard to long-term sexual and re-\nproductive behaviors. Although the findings of this\nstudy do not examine other potential benefits of\nkinship care, more research on formal and informal\nkinship care, with a focus on long-term outcomes, is\nneeded to understand the effect of the shift toward\nfavoring kinship care for children in out-of-home\nplacement.\n"
