    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Mortality rates in the United States from coronary artery disease are higher among\nblacks than whites at younger ages, with a crossover to lower rates above the age of70. The factors that\ndetermine this crossover of age-specific death rates have not been elucidated. Selection from the black\npopulation of younger individuals who are sicker by virtue ofbeing more coronary prone might leave a\nrelatively healthier group ofolder persons. Support for this hypothesis would consist in part ofevidence\nthat coronary artery disease has an earlier onset in the black population. We examined data from the\nNational Hospital Discharge Survey for the years 1973-1984 to determine if age-related differences in\ncase-fatality rates existed between whites and nonwhites. In-hospital case fatality rates were 10% to\n70% higher for each of the 10 year age groups for nonwhites up to age 70, at which time a crossover\noccurred. The median age at death from myocardial infarction was approximately 5 years younger in\nnonwhites compared with whites. National estimates of hospitalization rates for myocardial infarction\nfrom these data likewise suggest that nonwhites receive less health care for coronary artery disease than\nwhites relative to recorded fatal events. The age-specific trends in case-fatality support the hypothesis\nthat a cohort selection effect in part determines the black/white differentials in coronary artery disease.\nRelative susceptibility of the black and white population is thus not appropriately estimated by age-\nadjusted rates, but should be examined on an age-specific basis within the framework of selection\neffects on a cohort.\nTHE EPIDEMIOLOGY of coronary artery disease\n(CAD) in the black population of the United States has\nbeen the subject of significant recent controversy. 1-3\nFrom the cohort studies that have been reported to date\nit is clear that the standard coronary risk factors influ-\nence the development of CAD among blacks to a rea-\nsonably similar degree to that described for U.S.\nwhites and other populations.7 Major inconsistencies\nhave arisen, however, when efforts have been made to\ncompare quantitatively the disease burden from CAD\nin whites and blacks. Given the twofold greater preva-\nlence of hypertension among U.S. blacks, and similar\nlevels of hypercholesterolemia and cigarette smok-\nFrom Servicio de Cardiologia, Hospital Clinico, Universidad de Bar-\ncelona, Spain, the Division of Adult Cardiology, Cook County Hospi-\ntal, Chicago, and the Department of Preventive Medicine and Commu-\nnity Health, University of Illinois College of Medicine, Chicago.\nAddress for correspondence: Dr. Richard Cooper, Division of Adult\nCardiology, Cook County Hospital, 1835 West Harrison St., Chicago,\ning,'3 it would be anticipated that blacks should suffer\nhigher rates of CAD. Comparison of vital statistics\ndata, however, suggest nearly equal age-adjusted\nCAD mortality in black and white men, with only\nmodestly higher rates among black women compared\nwith their white counterparts.\" 9 Data from several\ncommunity studies have further shown that the in-\nhospital death rates from CAD is lower among blacks\nthan whites, accompanied by an excess of out-of-hos-\npital deaths.\"'2 Death. certificate coding for out-of-\nhospital and sudden CAD death is not highly reliable\nand it has been suggested that the higher CAD rates\nreported among blacks in the vital records are an arti-\nfact, resulting primarily from misclassification of\nthese medically unattended events.'3' '4\nEstimated differentials in CAD mortality between\nthe black and white populations have generally been\nbased on only age-adjusted rates. Age adjustment\ntends to weight these comparisons toward deaths\namong the elderly and does not account for the poten-\ntial effects of selection and competing cause. These\nCIRCULATION\nhttp://circ.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nconsiderations led to the formulation of the following\nhypothesis as an explanation for the observed racial\ndifferentials presently observed in the United States\nwith respect to this disease: CAD is in fact more severe\namong blacks than whites, as would be anticipated\nfrom the distribution of coronary risk factors. Among\nblacks the disease would therefore be expected to have\nits onset at a younger age (i.e., a higher proportion of\ncases will occur \"prematurely\") and at any given age\nthe disease will be more severe relative to that in\nwhites. To test this hypothesis we examined racial\ndifferences in age-specific case fatality rates from\nmyocardial infarction in a representative sample of\nU.S. hospitals. In addition, the age trends in mortality\nfrom CAD from the two populations were further stud-\nied tirough use of vital statistics data.\nMethods\nData sources\nHospital discharge data. Hospital discharge data were pro-\nvided by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)\nthrough the National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS). De-\ntailed descriptions of the methods used for the NHDS have been\npublished elsewhere.5' 16 The NHDS is an ongoing sample\nsurvey drawn from a frame of 7500 short-stay hospitals in the\nUnited States, exclusive of military and Veterans Administra-\ntion facilities. Hospitals are stratified on the basis of size (num-\nber ofbeds) and geographic location, and within each hospital a\nrandom sample of discharges are selected. Data are abstracted\neither by local hospital staff or by representatives of the NCHS.\nselected to participate, and data were ultimately collected from\nmedical records were entered into the survey file that year.\nAll discharge diagnoses and procedures were listed on the\nabstract in the order of the principal one, or the first-listed one if\nthe principal one was not identified, followed by the order in\nwhich all diagnoses were entered on the discharge sheet. Coding\nwas then carried out by NCHS staff according to the Eighth\nRevision of the International Classification of Diseases, Adapt-\ndischarge summaries, was missing from 8.9% of records in\n1984; persons with race not stated were excluded from the\npresent study in all years. Procedures for identifying nonwhites\nvaried from year to year but consisted primarily of aggregating\nblacks and native Americans; Hispanics were coded \"white\".\nThe category of \"nonwhite\" is taken to represent \"black\" in this\nanalysis, as in all studies based on the national vital statistics\ncomputer tapes on which race was coded as black and nonwhite;\n88% of the individuals in the nonwhite category were identified\nas black. It is assumed, therefore, that the vast majority of\nindividuals in the nonwhite category in each year are black and\nthis segment of the population weights the outcome.\nAnalysis was restricted to persons over the age of 35, given\nthe low incidence of myocardial infarction before this age. In-\nhospital fatality rates were age-adjusted to a standard population\nof all cases. In the entire sample, including all 12 years of data,\n43,849 discharge forms contained the mention of myocardial\ninfarction (ICD Code 410) at any rank order (i.e., not restricted\nwere coded as race \"other.\" Because of those methodologic\nproblems the NCHS does not routinely report data from the\nNHDS by race, and the present findings must be interpreted\nwith caution for this reason. The survey did not differentiate\nacute myocardial infarction during the hospitalization being ex-\namined from any mention of a prior event; therefore the same\nindividual admitted more than once to a study hospital would be\ncounted as a case on each occasion if acute myocardial infarc-\ntion appeared on the discharge summary. To obtain data on a\nsufricient number of deaths in each age-sex-race cell, data from\ntion of the data in 4 year subgroups did not reveal any important\ntrends over time in the patterns of age or racial differentials. As\na result of the design of the NHDS, estimates of hospitalization\nrates based on the civilian noninstitutionalized population could\nbe obtained, and these were calculated for each age-sex-race\ngroup.\nMortality rates and vital statistics. Mortality data from acute\nmyocardial infarction for the resident U.S. population were\nobtained from the NCHS. Death rates from myocardial infarc-\nsubgroups, and the ratio of black to white deaths was calculated.\nPopulation estimates for 1980 were obtained from the Bureau of\nthe Census and used to estimate discharge rates for myocardial\ninfarction in conjunction with the NHDS data for the years 1978\nto 1982. Blacks were used as the population base to calculate\nnonwhite rates.\nStatistical analysis. In reporting data from the NHDS the\nNCHS advises that estimates based on a sample size less than 60\nbe regarded with caution. The smallest number of discharges for\nall 12 years combined was encountered in the age group 35 to 39\namong blacks, in which 77 patients were discharged and five\ndied. Estimates of sampling error used in statistical testing do\nnot account for weighing or sample design, providing additional\nreason to generalize beyond the sample with caution. Differ-\nences in case fatality rates were tested based on point estimates\nfor each 5 year age group with the chi-square test. Differences in\nthe relationship between case-fatality rates and age were exam-\nined by comparing the slopes of the rate between whites and\nnonwhites after fitting the curve to a linear regression line plot\nwith the use of programs available with SAS. Although the\nrelationship between fatality rates and age is curvilinear, the\npurpose of this analysis was not to estimate the shape of the\ncurve but to compare the slopes in the two groups; programs\nwere not available to compare two curvilinear relationships, so\nstraight line plots were estimated. Since the vital statistics repre-\nsent data from entire population, not a sample, no statistical\ntests were performed on those data.\nResults\nAs presented in table 1A and figure 1, the in-hospi-\ntal case fatality rates for whites and nonwhites were\ncalculated as a percentage by 5 year age groups from\n35 to 39 and over. Rates were higher for nonwhites\nthan whites until the age of 70, at which time a cross-\nover for the two oldest age categories was observed.\nFatality rates were significantly higher for nonwhites\ncompared with whites only among persons 35 to 39\nyears old (p = .03). At the same time, the age-adjust-\ned mortality was very slightly higher for whites for the\nentire age spectrum because of the greater number of\ndeaths among the elderly in the white population and\nthe higher fatality rate in this oldest age group.

For whites the beta coefficient ( +SE)\n\u00b1 0.065; the difference between these two slopes was\nhighly significant statistically (t = 24).\nAmong nonwhite men the in-hospital fatality rate\nwas higher than among whites for all but one of the 5\nyear age groups under 70, with a crossover observedat\nthat point (figure 1, B). Only sixteen nonwhite women\nunder40 were included in the sample, and in this group\nthree (19%) died in the hospital; except for higher rates\nin this youngest age group, age-specific death rates\nwere similar in women of both races until age 70, at\nwhich time nonwhite women experienced lower rates\n(figure 1, B). A somewhat higher proportion of non-\nwhite vs white patients were women - 43% vs 37%,\nrespectively. Overall in-hospital death rates were 16%\nfor white men, 15% for nonwhite men, 24% for white\nwomen, and 20% for nonwhite women. Women ex-\nperienced higher death rates than men in all age groups\nbelow 70. The ratio of total discharges, men to wom-\nen, was also highly age dependent; thus, at age 35 to 39\nthe mortality ratio for men to women was 6.1: 1.0 for\n* White\n* Non-White\nAGE\nNon-White-White Ratio\nFIGURE 1.

These data do not lend support to the\nhypothesis that differential fatality rates can be attrib-\nuted to the more frequent association of other medical\nillnesses among blacks.\nGiven the steeper relationship between age and\ncase-fatality for whites and the more youthful age\nstructure of the black populations, proportional mor-\ntality was distributed upward for whites compared with\nnonwhites (table 2); the median age at death from\nmyocardial infarction in this sample fell between 70\nwhites.\nIncidence rates based on hospital discharge rates\nafter myocardial infarction in the white and nonwhite\npopulations were estimated for the 5 years around\n1980. For both sexes incidence rates were virtually\nidentical for the two racial groups at all ages, with a\nslight excess among nonwhites during the age decade\nof the 40s (figure 2, A).

Population-based in-hospital\ndeath rates were estimated by combining the number of\ndischarges, the case-fatality rates and, the population\nestimates by age, sex, and race (table 3). Hospital data\nfor the five years around 1980 were again used, togeth-\ner with the 1980 census data. The actual rate of death\nfrom myocardial infarction in the hospital, given high-\ner case fatality and similar incidence, is twofold higher\nfor nonwhites under age 45, with the expected age\ntrend.\nAt least half of the deaths coded to myocardial in-\nfarction occur outside the hospital.'7 18 Trends in the\ndeath rate in 1983 for the entire United States by age\nand race are presented in figure 3, A.

In recent years increased attention\nhas been focused on the question ofthe relative rates of\nCAD in the black and white populations.2' 24 The data\nfrom the NHDS presented here, in combination with\nthe vital statistics, demonstrate that blacks suffer high-\ner rates of CAD at younger ages. From these findings\nwe conclude that CAD has an earlier onset among\nblacks and at any given age is more severe. The only\npotential explanation for the decrease with age relative\nto whites in both incidence and case-fatality would be\nthe effect of selection.'9'20 The paradox of lower age-\nIn-hospital mortality rates from myocardial infarction by race and\nAge group (yr) White Nonwhite\nadjusted CAD rates among blacks is therefore a statis-\ntical artifact yielded by the method of analysis. In\nevaluating the relative disease burden, two distinctly\ndifferent approaches should be taken, based respec-\ntively on the age-adjusted and age-specific data. While\nthe age-adjusted data provide an estimate of the overall\nburden for the population relative to other causes and\nthe age-structure of the population, age-specific rates\nmore accurately reflect the force of the disease-causing\nfactors to which the population is exposed.\nStudies of mortality crossover have been carried out\nManton and Stal-\nlard in particular have explored the effect of \"heteroge-\nneity of frailty\" on the age-related increase in mortal-\nity.25 While it could be assumed that the rate of\ndevelopment of a disease process with age for an indi-\nvidual could be imputed from the rates of increase for\nthe whole population, this assumption ignores the ef-\nfect of selection.25 This concept implies that suscept-\nible individuals will be removed from the cohort at a\nyounger age, leaving a group of relatively more robust\nsurvivors. A convergence of age-specific mortality\nrates -\nor in the special case an actual crossover is\ntherefore observed in the comparison of the black and\nwhite populations of the United States 26-28 and this has\nCIRCULATION\nW\nc-\nAGE\nhttp://circ.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nTotal\nMale\nAGE\nBlack/White Ratio\n_-_e\nO-\nFIGURE 3.

The increased population risk of CAD, a result\nprimarily of excess hypertension, leads to premature\natherosclerosis among blacks. Evidence for the earlier\nonset of CAD is derived from two sources, i.e., in-\ncreased death rates at younger ages, and a higher case-\nfatality rate among those admitted to the hospital with\nthe diagnosis of myocardial infarction. While it is pos-\nsible, as noted above, that increased mortality based on\nvital records could be an artifact of miscoding of out-\nof-hospital deaths, it is unlikely that this differential\napplies to hospitalized cases. The only plausible expla-\nnations of the increased case-fatality rates are more\nsevere CAD, the presence of other complicating medi-\ncal conditions, and/or poorer quality health care. Our\nestimate of complicating conditions suggested no race\ndifference in this sample; we were unable to evaluate\nquality of care. Neither of these latter two explana-\ntions, however, is consistent with a subsequent cross-\nover to lower rates among blacks. Since the develop-\nment of CAD is an age-related process, the onset of the\ndisease at an earlier age in a given population implies\nthat the average patient will have more serious disease\nat any given age. Invoking the explanation of more\nsevere disease to explain higher case-fatality among\nyounger blacks is likewise consistent with the vital\nstatistics data suggesting more deaths in the popula-\ntion. Selection against the more coronary-prone indi-\nviduals as a result of exposure to a greater force of\nmortality from atherosclerosis would leave a healthier\ncohort. At the same time, coronary-prone individuals\nwould be more likely to die from other cardiovascular\n_-\nFemale\nM White\n* Black\nhttp://circ.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nROIG et al.\ncauses, such as stroke, heart failure, and renal disease,\nand cancer associated with cigarette use31' 32; this latter\nphenomenon is probably more important quantitative-\nly. The effect of this high competing mortality from\ndiseases related to hypertension and smoking would\nfurther accentuate the selection of a cohort over 65 less\nsusceptible to CAD.\nBoth all-cause mortality rates and CAD rates are\nlower in elderly blacks compared with whites. With\nthe most straightforward approach of dividing the pop-\nulation at age 65, it is possible to account for only a\nfraction of the deficit in CAD deaths among elderly\nblacks by transfer of excess CAD deaths from persons\nunder 65.26 About half of the difference, however, can\nbe accounted for by excess deaths from the broader\ncategory ofcardiovascular diseases, and on the basis of\ncompeting cause it is reasonable to assume that prema-\nture stroke and heart failure have eliminated some of\nthe coronary-prone individuals. An additional 5% to\n30% of the deaths, however, must be assumed to have\nresulted from other, noncardiovascular, causes. While\nit is likely that lung cancer, which is twice as common\nin black as white men under age 65, may eliminate\npotential CAD victims, it is difficult to identify other\nspecific death categories that are of sufficient size to\ncompete with CAD. Furthermore, all such arguments\nmust remain theoretical since an individual can die\nonly once and all assumptions about competing cause\nmust remain unproven empirically.\nIn-hospital case fatality rates from myocardial in-\nfarction are generally reported to be in the range of\n10% to 20% and have changed little over the last two\ndecades.31' The lower limit ofrates based on recent\ndata were reported by the community surveillance pro-\ngram in Minneapolis, where 9% of men and 11% of\nwomen admitted with a documented myocardial in-\nfarction died before discharge.` Rates in the range of\n20% are more commonly reported, however. The 30\nday fatality from myocardial infarction in the Fram-\nincluding black patients demonstrated rates between\n20% and 25%, and these did not differ from those for\nwhites in the same geographic area or institu-\ntion. 12' 3 37 Comparisons by age group were not carried\nout, and the samples were too small individually to\npermit such an analysis, so it is not possible to deter-\nmine if the age-related racial differentials in case-fa-\ntality described here were present in these other stud-\nies. There are data suggesting that long-term survival\nafter myocardial infarction is shorter in blacks,38 39\nalthough this question requires further study.\nAs an attempt to gain insight into population-based\nevent rates the present data set is not without signifi-\ncant limitations. As noted in the Methods section, a\nsizable hospital nonresponse rate exists for each year,\nand data on race are missing for 5% to 10% of rec-\nords.`6 Separate analysis of discharge summaries in\nwhich race was not stated suggest that they follow the\npattern of all summaries combined, i.e., they are\ndrawn proportionally from white and nonwhite cate-\ngories, but this cannot be proven. Further bias may\nhave been introduced by exclusion of all nonhospital\ncases. There is evidence that out-of-hospital death\nrates are higher for blacks than whites` 10-12 and delay\nbefore arrival at the hospital is markedly prolonged.36\nWhether this phenomenon results in a mix of hospital-\nized cases with greater or lesser risk ofdying cannot be\ndetermined with the data presently available, however.\nLocal studies with direct population surveillance will\nbe required to answer these questions.\nIncidence rates for myocardial infarction in blacks\ncompared with those in whites have been difficult to\ndetermine and are the subject of some controversy.\nSeven population studies reviewed by Gillum2 report-\ned comparative data by race collected before 1978.\nBlacks were noted to have lower age-adjusted rates in\nall of these studies; the sample size of each study was\nnot large, however, and those from the rural South\nmay not be representative. The 5 year follow-up data\nof the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial screen-\nees demonstrate lower than expected CAD rates\namong blacks, with a lower risk associated with hyper-\ntension.5 Although based on a very large sample, the\nrepresentative character ofthese findings remains open\nto question. More recent data from the pilot phase of\nthe Community Cardiovascular Surveillance Program\n(CCSP) demonstrate higher age-adjusted death rates\nfrom myocardial infarction (ICD Code 410) for blacks\nof both sexes, and this differential is even more pro-\nnounced in the younger age groups,40 while age-adjust-\ned rates of nonfatal events are higher in whites than\nblacks. Interestingly, however, incidence rates are\nconsistently higher for blacks in the age groups under\n45, thus confirming the crossover pattern seen in our\ndata. Since all these estimates of incidence rely on\nhospitalization rates they must be viewed as an inexact\nreflection of the true population rate. The findings\nfrom the large data base reported here suggest that over\nthe last decade there have been comparable rates of\nadmission for myocardial infarction in blacks and\nwhites. The death rate from CAD has declined in both\nCIRCULATION\nhttp://circ.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nblacks and whites since the late 1960s, so it is unlikely\nthat lower incidence rates from the earlier studies re-\nflect secular trends.4` At the present time overall health\ncare utilization is similar for the two races, although\nthere may be some residual inequality if one corrects\nfor increased need, i.e., disease prevalence, among\nblacks.42' 43 At any rate, the present study and the pilot\nphase of CCSP represent the largest and most recent\nstudies, and both give evidence of higher rates of fatal\nCAD among younger blacks.\nThe population-based incidence rates derived in this\nanalysis are not directly comparable to those from oth-\ner studies since they are based only on hospital admis-\nsions and do not separate first from recurrent cases.\nBased on hospital admissions, Goldman et al.' report\nrates of myocardial infarction that increased from ap-\nrate of 650.34 The in-hospital population death rate was\nin the 70 + group.34 Despite differences in methods,\nthe rates reported here are in a very similar range.\nIn summary, based on the different age patterns of\nadmission to the hospital for myocardial infarction and\nthe case-fatality rates, we conclude that CAD onset is\nat an earlier average age in blacks than whites. The\nmost likely explanation of findings presented here\nwould thus be the presence of more severe atheroscle-\nrosis in the age groups under 70 years. Lower rates in\nthe elderly could be explained by selection. Consider-\nation of the relative rates of CAD in the black and\nwhite populations as they relate to cause or force of\nmortality should thus rely on age-specific disease\nrates, not those that are age-adjusted. Further data\nfrom well-designed surveys that apply standardized\ndiagnostic criteria will be needed to confirm the find-\nings of the present study and further clarify questions\nrelated to out-of-hospital mortality.\nWe express our appreciation to Robert Pokras of the National\nCenter for Health Statistics for performing the data analysis, and\nto Ms. Debra Leonard for assistance in preparation ofthe manu-\nscript.\nReferences\n1.
