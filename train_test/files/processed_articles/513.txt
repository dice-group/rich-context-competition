In this ecological study, we used linear regression techniques and recently available state-level mea-\nsures of suicide attempt rates to assess whether, and if so, to what extent, the well-established relationship between\nhousehold firearm ownership rates and suicide mortality persists after accounting for rates of underlying suicidal behav-\nior. After controlling for state-level suicide attempt rates (2008\u00ad2009), higher rates of firearm ownership (assessed in\n2004) were strongly associated with higher rates of overall suicide and firearm suicide, but not with nonfirearm suicide\n(2008\u00ad2009). Furthermore, suicide attempt rates were not significantly related to gun ownership levels. These findings\nsuggest that firearm ownership rates, independent of underlying rates of suicidal behavior, largely determine varia-\ntions in suicide mortality across the 50 states. Our results support the hypothesis that firearms in the home impose\nsuicide risk above and beyond the baseline risk and help explain why, year after year, several thousand more Ameri-\ncans die by suicide in states with higher than average household firearm ownership compared with states with lower\nthan average firearm ownership.\nfirearms; guns; suicidality; suicide; suicide attempts\nAbbreviation: BRFSS, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.\nOnanaveragedayintheUnitedStates,morethan100Amer-\nicans die by suicide; half of these suicides involve the use of\nfirearms (1). Suicide rates, both overall and by firearms, are\nhigher, in general, in places where household firearm owner-\nship is more common. By contrast, ratesof suicide by methods\nother than firearms are not significantly correlated with rates of\nhousehold firearm ownership (2, 3). This pattern of higher\nsuicide rates in places where firearms are more readily avail-\nable, driven by higher firearm suicide rates, has been reported\nin ecological studies that have adjusted for several potential\nconfounders, including aggregate measures of psychological\ndistress, degree of urbanization, alcohol and illicit drug use\nand abuse, poverty, education, and unemployment (2\u00ad6). House-\nhold firearm ownership has also consistently been found to be\na strong predictor of suicide risk in studies that use individual-\nlevel data. Every US case-control study, for example, has found\nthat the presence of a gun in the home is a risk factor for suicide\n(7\u00ad20). In addition, the only large US cohort study to examine\nthe firearm-suicide connection found that suicide rates among\nCalifornia residents who purchased handguns from licensed\ndealers were more than twice as likely to die by suicide as\nwere age- and sex-matched members of the general popula-\ntion, not only immediately after the purchase, but throughout\nthe 6-year study period (21).

The BRFSS, the world's largest\nannually), is an ongoing data collection program sponsored\nby the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with all\n50 states participating. A detailed description of the survey\nmethods used by BRFSS is available elsewhere (28\u00ad30).\nBriefly, trained interviewers collect data on a monthly basis\nby using an independent probability sample of households\nwith telephones among the noninstitutionalized US popula-\ntion aged 18 years or older. All BRFSS questionnaires and\ndata are available on the Internet (www.cdc.gov/brfss). Firearm\nownership information was obtained by interviewers who began\nthe firearm section of the survey by first informing respon-\ndents that \"the next three questions are about firearms. We\nare asking these in a health survey because of our interest in\nfirearm-related injuries. Please include weapons such as pistols,\nshotguns, and rifles; but not BB guns, starter pistols, or guns\nthat cannot fire. Include those kept in a garage, outdoor stor-\nage area, or motor vehicle.\" Presence of firearms in the home\nwas assessed by asking respondents, \"Are any firearms kept\nin or around your home?\" Firearm prevalence estimates\nexclude respondents who did not know or refused to answer\nthe BRFSS firearm questions.

In California, interviewers did not ask the household\nfirearms question in 2004; we substituted the firearm preva-\nlence estimate from the 2002 questionnaire.\nState-level measures of past-year suicide attempts were\nobtained from the 2008 National Survey on Drug Use and\nHealth (31). The National Survey on Drug Use and Health is\na national- and state-level survey of a representative sample\nof the noninstitutionalized US civilian population aged 12\nyears or older. The National Survey on Drug Use and Health\ncollects data on health risks related to the use of illicit drugs,\nalcohol, and tobacco; initiation of substance use; substance\nuse disorders and treatment; health care; and mental health. The\nreport from which suicide attempt data were obtained asked\nabout suicidal thoughts and behaviors among adults only\nnext few questions are about thoughts of suicide. At any time\nin the past 12 months, that is from [datefill] up to and includ-\ning today, did you seriously think about trying to kill your-\nself?\" If respondents answered that they had thought about\nsuicide, they were then asked, \"During the past 12 months,\ndid you try to kill yourself?\" Attempt data were also avail-\nable separately for males, females, and adults aged 18\u00ad29\nyears.\nOur primary outcomes were the rate of suicides per state\nduring the 2-year study period, the rate of suicides involving\nfirearms, and the rate of suicides involving methods other\nthan firearms. Standard linear regression analyses were under-\ntaken in conjunction with a bootstrapping process, in which\n10,000 artificial data sets were generated to account for vari-\nability in the point estimates (as specified by the accompany-\ning survey-based 95% confidence intervals). This was achieved\nby performing individual linear regressions in each artificial\ndata set and taking the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of effect\nestimates as the boundaries for 95% confidence intervals. The\ndata sets were created through sampling from Gaussian dis-\ntributions with means and standard errors provided by the\noriginal survey estimates. Both unweighted analyses and anal-\nyses weighted by the states' populations are shown. Subgroup\nanalyses are reported by using population-weighted regres-\nsion results. The rateofsuicidalacts,referredtohereinassuicide\nattempts unless otherwise noted, is the sum of suicidal acts that\nare fatal (i.e., suicides) plus the far larger number of suicidal\nacts that are nonfatal (i.e., past-year suicide attempts from the\nNational Survey on Drug Use and Health). Secondary strati-\nfied analyses were performed for adult men, adult women,\nTo illustrate our main findings more concretely, we com-\npared suicide deaths and suicide attempts during our study\nperiod in states that are the most extreme in their firearm prev-\nalence. The group of high-prevalence states and the group of\nlow-prevalence states are matched so that the numbers of\nperson-years in the 2 groupings are approximately equal (i.e.,\nthe 16 states with the highest firearm prevalence are com-\npared with the 6 states with the lowest firearm prevalence).\nSimilar mortality rate ratios were obtained when comparing\nthe 10 states that are most extreme in firearm prevalence (not\nshown).\nOur graphs depict the simultaneous effects of our 2 inde-\npendent variables of interest, firearm ownership and suicide\nattempt rates, on our outcomes of interest, mortality from\nsuicide overall (Figure 1A), from suicide involving firearms\n(Figure 1B), and from suicide involving all other methods\n(Figure 1C).Thevisualdiscrepancy betweena modelthatexam-\nines the crude relationship between household firearm own-\nership and suicide mortality (the solid regression line) and a\nmodel that examines the simultaneous influence of suicide\nattempt and firearm ownership rates on suicide mortality (a line\nvisualized through the cross marks) is a representation of how\nmuch the relationship between firearm ownership and suicide\nmortality is affected by the covarying contribution of suicide\nattempt rates. The state-level measures of suicide mortality,\nhousehold firearm ownership, and suicide attempt rates that were\nused in the primary analyses are provided in the Appendix.\nRESULTS\nHigher rates of firearm ownership are strongly associated\nwith higher rates of overall suicide and firearm suicide, but\nnot with nonfirearm suicide (Table 1).

By\ncontrast, suicide attempt rates, which range from 0.1% to\n1.5%, explain less than 1% of the variation in rates of overall\nsuicide, firearm suicide, and nonfirearm suicide. Indeed, suicide\nattempt rates are not significantly related to suicide mortality\nratesoverallorbymethod, evenincrudecomparisons.Adjust-\nment for suicide attempt data in regressions, therefore, has\nlittle influence on the magnitude of the associations between\nrates of firearm ownership and suicide mortality. For example,\nthe partial correlation coefficient relating rates of household\nfirearm ownership and suicide mortality in our primary anal-\nysis is 0.6 whether or not suicide attempts are included in\ntheregression(datanotshown).Likewise,regardlessofwhether\nsuicide attempt rates are included in regressions, the partial\ncorrelation coefficient relating household firearm ownership\nand firearm suicide is 0.8 (data not shown).\nRegression analyses further quantify these relationships.\nulation) higher in states where firearm ownership rates are 1\npercentagepointhigher(31).Therelationshipbetweenfirearm\nownership and suicide rates is entirely accounted for by the\nrelationship between firearm ownership and firearm suicides,\nas reflected in a  coefficient associated with firearm suicide\nally identical to that for overall suicide ( = 0.21, 95% confi-\ndence interval: 0.14, 0.28); the  coefficient relating firearm\nownership and nonfirearm suicide is essentially null ( = \u00ad0.02,\nlation) in states where rates of suicide attempts were 1 per-\ncentage point higher (Table 1).

Like-\nwise, the relationship between variation in suicide attempt rates\nand suicide mortality in both weighted and unweighted anal-\nyses is similar, nonsignificant, and materially trivial (Table 1).\nSecondary stratified analyses by sex and by age groupings for\nwhich suicide attempt data were available produce patterns\nsimilar to those in primary analyses (Table 2).\nAlthough the aggregate number of people residing in the\n16 high\u00adgun ownership states and the 6 low\u00adgun ownership\nstates is approximately equal, and the suicide attempt rates\nare similar, almost twice as many adults (11,428) completed\nin the United States by Method of Suicide\nMethod of\nSuicide\nPartial Correlation Coefficientd Regression Coefficientd\nHousehold\nFirearm\nOwnership\nSuicide Attempt\nRate\nHousehold Firearm\nOwnership\nSuicide Attempt\nRate\nHousehold Firearm\nOwnership\nSuicide Attempt\nRate\nCorrelation\nCoefficient\nP\nValue\nCorrelation\nCoefficient\nP\nValue\nRegression\nCoefficient\nRegression\nCoefficient\nRegression\nCoefficient\nWeighted by\nPopulation\nRegression\nCoefficient\nWeighted by\nPopulation\nAbbreviation: CI, confidence interval.\na Household firearm ownership prevalence ranges from 10% to 66% (standard deviation, 14%).\nb Suicide attempt rates range from 0.1% to 1.5% (standard deviation, 0.5%).

For example, adjustment for suicide attempt\nrates hardly moves the cross-hatches off the regression line\nlinking firearm ownership and firearm suicide rates (or off the\nregression line linking firearm ownership to overall suicide\nrates), providing avisual representation of how little the observed\nassociation between suicide mortality and firearm ownership\ndepends on confounding by suicide attempt rates. These\nvisual renderings directly mirror results from linear regression\nanalyses.\nDISCUSSION\nAs in previous empirical work from individual-level (7\u00ad\nrates of firearm ownership are associated with higher rates of\noverall suicide and firearm suicide, but not with nonfirearm\nsuicide. Our finding that the firearm-suicide association per-\nsists unabated after controlling for suicide attempt rates is\nconsistent with previous ecological work that controlled for\naggregate-level measures associated with suicidality, including\nrates of major depression, serious suicidal thoughts, serious\nmentalillness,alcoholanddrugdependenceandabuse,urban-\nization, poverty, and unemployment (3, 6, 32). Moreover,\nour finding that suicide attempt rates do not covary with either\nfirearmownership orwith ratesofsuicidesuggeststhat,although\nstates with higher rates of firearm ownership may differ from\nstates with lower rates of firearm ownership, these differences\ndo not appear to play an important role in determining the fre-\nquency with which people engage in suicidal behavior.\nIn the United States, where firearms are the method used\nin more than 50% of all suicides and where roughly 1 in 3\nhomes contains firearms, even small relative declines in the\nuse of firearms in suicide acts could result in large reductions\nin the number of suicides, depending on what, if any, method\nwould be substituted for firearms. Consider, for example, the\nfact that more than 90% of all suicidal acts with firearms are\nfatal, but suicidal acts with firearms constitute only 5% of all\ndeliberate self-harm episodes. In contrast, fewer than 3% of\nall suicidal acts with drugs or cutting are fatal but, as a group,\nsuch acts constitute approximately 90% of all attempts (33,\ndied and the approximately 2,000 who survived) substituted\ndrugs or cutting, there would have been approximately 1,900\nfewer suicide deaths. The potential for substantial reduction\nin suicide rates is apparent in our comparison of suicides in\nhigh\u00ad versus low\u00adgun ownership states, where suicide attempt\nrates are similar, but the rate of suicide is twice as high in high\u00ad\ngun ownership states (with differences in mortality attributable\nTable 3.

First, our measure of firearm availability is house-\nhold firearm ownership. This is a reasonable measure of expo-\nsure because most firearm suicides involve firearms from the\nvictims' homes (15), but this measure does not provide poten-\ntially important information about many characteristics of fire-\narm availability that may affect risk, such as how firearms are\nstored. Second, our measure of suicide attempt rates is based\nonsurveyresponses,andwewereunabletocontrolfortheseri-\nousness or persistence of the suicidal intent that accompa-\nnied the reported events. On the other hand, there is no a priori\nreason to expect that the suicidal intent among attempters in\nhigh\u00adgun ownership states would be different (higher) than\nthe intent among attempters in low\u00adgun ownership states.\nConsistent with this expectation, prior work has failed to find\nhigher rates of mental illness, substance abuse or dependence,\nor suicidal thoughts or attempts among people living in homes\nwith firearms compared with those living in homes without\nfirearms (22\u00ad25). Third, firearm prevalence data in primary\nanalyses come from the 2004BRFSS(thelatestyear forwhich\nnationally representative state-level data are available), whereas\neffect of this temporal discrepancy on our results is likely to\nbe small because guns are highly durable and, as has been\nobserved previously, the cross-sectional pattern of household\nfirearm ownership tends to be remarkably constant over time\nfindings identical to the second decimal place (and substan-\ntively indistinguishable from those reported by using mortality\nFourth, our study used aggregate data for our exposures and out-\ncomes of interest; as is always the case with analyses based on\naggregate data, drawing causal inferences about individual risk\nfactors can be problematic (36). However, our key finding--a\nstrong association between household firearm prevalence and\nsuicide by firearms (but not by other methods)--is likely to\nreflect associations observable at the individual level because\nfindings from individual-level studies (15) indicate that the\nmajorityofsuicidesby firearms occur inthedecedents'homes\nand involve firearms owned by the victims or other members\nof the households.\nDespite these limitations, our results support the hypothe-\nsis established in prior individual-level work (7\u00ad16, 21) that\nthe availability of lethal means is associated with risk of death\nby suicide above and beyond the baseline risk of suicidal behav-\nior. Our study suggests that this additional risk is large, operates\nacross sex and age groups, and plausibly accounts for thou-\nsands of deaths every year.\n"
