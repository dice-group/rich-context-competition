Compared\nwith people without dementia, community residents with dementia had higher average expenditures for hospital and ED\nservices; nursing home residents with dementia had lower average expenditures for all-cause hospitalizations.

For example, in 2006, beneficia-\nries with both chronic conditions and functional impairments\nhad average Medicare expenditures of $15833 compared with\n$2245 for beneficiaries with neither chronic conditions nor\nfunctional impairments.1 As a result, this population is respon-\nsible for a disproportionate share of Medicare and health\nspending, especially hospital spending. Many studies have\ndocumented that a substantial portion of this utilization and its\nrelated expenditures are avoidable or preventable.2-5 Several\ninitiatives are underway to address this problem, including the\ndevelopment of resource use measures (ie, measures that assess\npotentially preventable utilization or relative spending) for\nMedicare's public reporting programs6 and the Centers for\nMedicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Initiative to Reduce\nAvoidableHospitalizationsAmongNursingFacilityResidents.2\nPeople with dementia are an important subgroup of the\npopulation with functional impairments and multiple chronic\nconditions. Because most people with dementia are Medicare\nbeneficiaries due to age (65 years or older) and many are also\nMedicaid beneficiaries, the impact on public payers of their\nhospital and emergency department (ED) use is substantial.\nThese implications are likely to grow as the number of people\nolder than 65 with Alzheimer's disease (the most common\ntype of dementia) is projected to nearly triple by 2050.7\nUtilization and expenditures among older people with\ndementia have generally been found to be significantly\nhigher as a result of their more complicated medical and\nlong-term care needs.8-12 However, current understanding of\nexpenditure patterns associated with hospital and ED use by\npeople with dementia relative to those without dementia--\nparticularly with potentially avoidable use--remains limited.\nMany estimates of Medicare expenditures associated with\ndementia use data prior to 2000 and do not distinguish by\nMoreover, although a number of studies have estimated\nMedicare expenditures associated with dementia among cer-\ntain Medicare or Medicaid populations,9,12-19 and some studies\n1RTI International, Waltham, MA, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nLaura Coots Daras, Program Manager, Health Services Researcher,\nQuality Measurement and Health Policy, RTI International, 307 Waverley\nEmail: lcoots@rti.org\nhave assessed potentially avoidable hospitalizations,20,21 we\nidentified only a few studies that assessed both Medicare\nexpenditures and potentially avoidable hospitalizations among\npatients with dementia.9,17,19 One study by Bynum et al9 ana-\nlyzed nationally representative data prior to 2000 and found\nincreased Medicare expenditures and odds of hospitalization\nfor people with dementia, both overall and for ambulatory care\nsensitive conditions. Lin et al17 found higher Medicare expen-\nditures and increased odds for some but not all types of poten-\ntially avoidable hospitalizations among beneficiaries with\ndementia. The third study, Zhu et al,19 analyzed data for a pro-\nspective cohort of community-based Medicare beneficiaries\nand found significantly higher Medicare expenditures and\ninpatient utilization among people with dementia, but results\non hospitalizations for ambulatory care sensitive conditions\nwere mixed. None of these studies assessed whether there\nwere differences by residential setting.\nSome estimates of Medicare expenditures for nursing\nhome residents with dementia have shown higher costs as the\ndisease progresses,22 and other work has documented sub-\nstantial variation in costs.23 In both studies, expenditures for\nhospitalizations and hospice were major drivers of total\nspending.\nThis study aims to address these research gaps with recent\nand nationally representative data. The objective is to pro-\nvide estimates of Medicare expenditures for hospitalization\nand ED use, both overall and potentially avoidable, among\nfee-for-service (FFS) Medicare beneficiaries with dementia\nacross residential settings (community vs nursing home) and\nat end-of-life (EOL) compared with beneficiaries without\ndementia.\nMethods\nData and Study Population\nWe analyzed 5 waves of survey data from the Health and\nRetirement Study (HRS) merged with Medicare claims for\nmation on a nationally representative sample of older adults\naged 50 years and above. It contains data about respondents'\nhealth status including cognitive status, physical functioning,\nand chronic conditions, along with a broad set of sociodemo-\ngraphic, economic, and other characteristics.24\nMedicare enrollment and claims data from CMS are\nlinked for consenting HRS respondents. The claims provide\ndetailed information on health care utilization and expendi-\ntures, which is more reliable than the self-reported data in the\nHRS. Given our focus on Medicare expenditures, the study\npopulation includes HRS respondents aged 65 years or older\nenrolled in FFS Medicare.\nWe conducted stratified analyses on 4 subsamples: (1)\nvations), (2) nursing home residents (n = 1081 persons with\npersons), and (4) nursing home decedents (n = 615 persons).\nNursing home residence was defined as residing in a nursing\nhome at the time of the HRS interview at each wave.\nMeasure of Dementia\nPrevious research has shown that using 1 source for classify-\ning dementia leads to underreporting of prevalence25,26 and\nexpenditures.27 To address this problem, we measured\ndementia by combining diagnostic information from the\nMedicare claims and a cognitive impairment measure from\nthe HRS; the latter incorporates information on cognitive\nfunctioning from respondent and proxy reports. The HRS-\nbased cognitive measure was developed and validated with\ndiagnostic data from the Aging, Demographics, and Memory\nStudy, a subsample of HRS respondents aged 70 and\nolder.28,29 For self-respondents, cognitive performance was\nassessed using a modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive\nStatus, a 27-point index based on items for short-term mem-\nory, working memory, and speed of processing; scores of 0 to\n6 on this index are considered dementia. For respondents\nassessed by proxies, cognitive status was measured on an\n11-point index based on reports of memory deficiencies,\ninstrumental activities of daily living (ADL) limitations, and\nan interviewer assessment, with scores of 6 to 11 indicating\ndementia. From the linked Medicare claims, we used the\nChronic Condition Data Warehouse indicator for a diagnosis\nof Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD) or\nsenile dementia. We created a dichotomous variable to flag\nbeneficiaries who either met the HRS definition of dementia\nor had an ADRD diagnosis from Medicare claims.\nExpenditure Outcomes\nTwo sets of Medicare expenditure outcomes were defined for\nhospitalizations and ED visits, respectively: expenditures for\noverall utilization and expenditures for potentially avoidable\nutilization. For beneficiaries alive at the HRS interview, each\noutcome was defined annually over a calendar-year period\nduring the year of the HRS survey. For decedents, the out-\ncome was for the last year of life.\nHospitalization expenditures.We identified all hospitaliza-\ntions from the linked Medicare inpatient claims and further\ndistinguished those hospitalizations that were potentially\navoidable. For each beneficiary, we calculated yearly Medi-\ncare expenditures (ie, program payments) for all-cause and\npotentially avoidable hospitalizations. Following the defini-\ntion developed by Walsh and colleagues3 and refined by\nFeng and colleagues,20 we identified potentially avoidable\nhospitalizations using a list of conditions and diagnosis-\nrelated groups judged by an expert panel as either prevent-\nable or manageable outside of the acute care setting.\nConsistent with these studies, we used one set of poten-\ntially avoidable conditions--those deemed preventable or\nDaras et al 3\nmanageable in the community--to define potentially avoid-\nable hospitalizations in both the nursing home and commu-\nnity setting.3,20 The community list does not include all of the\nconditions in the nursing home list because fewer medical\nresources are available in the community, which means that\nsome conditions that are preventable in a nursing home may\nnot be preventable in the community; thus, our estimated\nexpenditures among the nursing home sample are likely\nconservative.\nED Visit Expenditures\nYearly expenditures for ED visits included total Medicare\npayments for outpatient ED visits that did not result in inpa-\ntient admissions, which were identified from hospital outpa-\ntient claims using either the Healthcare Common Procedure\nused method to identify potentially avoidable ED visits spe-\ncific to the elderly population. Therefore, we utilized the\nsame definition for potentially avoidable ED visits as that\nused for potentially avoidable hospitalizations. In addition,\nwe distinguished potentially avoidable ED utilization only\namong outpatient ED visits not resulting in inpatient admis-\nsions given these are more likely unavoidable despite the\nfact that the associated hospitalization may be classified as\npotentially avoidable. In these instances, a physician deter-\nmined whether to admit the patient. Therefore, our poten-\ntially avoidable ED utilization results may also be somewhat\nunderestimated.\nOther Variables\nIn multivariate models predicting annualized expenditures,\nwe controlled for a range of risk factors for hospital and ED\nuse, including beneficiary age, gender, race and ethnicity,\neducation, marital status, types of insurance coverage,\nnumber of limitations in ADL, chronic conditions, self-\nreported health status, income, urban residence, and geo-\ngraphic regions.\nStatistical Analysis\nWe calculated Medicare expenditures for each beneficiary\nper year for (1) all-cause hospitalizations, (2) potentially\navoidable hospitalizations, (3) all-cause outpatient ED visits,\nand (4) potentially avoidable outpatient ED visits. These\nexpenditure measures were annualized by adjusting for time\n\"at risk\" for service use during each year. We also inflation-\nadjusted expenditures in terms of 2008 dollars based on the\nConsumer Price Index (CPI) for medical care services devel-\noped by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nTo address the fact that Medicare expenditures often are\nskewed and not normally distributed--in this case as a result\nof beneficiaries with no utilization--we used a 2-part\ngeneralized linear model (GLM) which is a common\napproach used in health care expenditure studies.30-33\nIn the first part of the model, we estimated the probability\nof having any positive expenditure using generalized esti-\nmating equation (GEE) logistic regression for the subsam-\nples, to account for repeated observations, and regular\nlogistic regression for the subsamples of decedents. The sec-\nond part of the model predicts expenditures conditional on\nthe probability of having any positive expenditure. Next,\nusing predicted values from these models, we calculated the\npredicted expenditures per person by multiplying the proba-\nbility of having any positive expenditure (from the first part)\nby the expected expenditures (from the second part).\nSimilar to estimating the counterfactual, we recalculated\nthe predicted expenditures by recoding the dementia variable\nto 0 for the sample while holding constant their values for all\nother risk factors meaning that individuals with dementia\nwere modeled as if they did not have dementia. Finally, we\ncalculated the differential between the 2 sets of predicted\nexpenditures for each person, which can be considered the\nmarginal dollar amount of expenditures attributable to\ndementia, independent of all other risk factors. We report\nresults on the adjusted mean annual expenditures per benefi-\nciary by dementia status in each subsample.\nAll multivariate regression models adjusted for each per-\nson's exposure time or count of months survived and enrolled\nin FFS Medicare during the outcome measurement period.\nThe HRS survey year or year of death was also included to\naccount for time trends, which would pick up any unob-\nserved changes in Medicare policy or payment changes over\nthe time period. All analyses were further adjusted for sam-\npling weights. This study was approved by the institutional\nreview board (IRB) at RTI International. The Medicare\nclaims data analyzed in this research were authorized under\nResults\nTable 1 summarizes the characteristics of all 4 subsamples.\nIn all, 12% of community residents had dementia, compared\nwith 84% of nursing home residents. In contrast, 34% of\ncommunity decedents and 87% of nursing home decedents\nhad dementia. The community and nursing home subsam-\nples, both overall and for decedents, were significantly dif-\nferent across most characteristics.\nThe unadjusted and adjusted results of expenditures for\nthe overall HRS sample, separately for community and nurs-\ning home residents and by dementia status, are reported in\nTable 2. Unadjusted expenditures were significantly higher\nfor community residents with dementia than for community\nresidents without dementia; the average annual unadjusted\nexpenditures were $3489 higher for all-cause hospitaliza-\ntions, $960 higher for potentially avoidable hospitalizations,\n$97 higher for all-cause ED visits, and $20 higher for poten-\ntially avoidable ED visits. However, among nursing home\nresidents, the unadjusted mean expenditures did not differ by\ndementia status.\nMultivariate regression adjusted expenditure estimates\nshowed that among community residents, beneficiaries with\ndementia had adjusted expenditures that were $2121 higher,\non average, than those without dementia for all-cause hospi-\n$859). Community residents with dementia also had higher\nadjusted expenditures for all-cause and potentially avoidable\noutpatient ED visits than those without dementia. Although\nstatistically significant, both the absolute amounts and mar-\nginal differences in expenditures for both types of ED visits\nwere much smaller, compared with hospitalization-associ-\nated expenditures.\nAmong community residents, the differences in adjusted\nexpenditures by dementia were similar with those found in\nunadjusted expenditures: Average adjusted expenditures were\nhigher compared with unadjusted expenditures for all utiliza-\ntion categories regardless of dementia status. In addition, the\nTable 1.

Moreover,\nunadjusted marginal differences by dementia status were not\nsignificant for any type of utilization, whereas the adjusted\nexpenditures for all-cause hospitalizations were significantly\nlower ($2035 less) for those with dementia.\nResults of the unadjusted and multivariate regression\nadjusted expenditures for HRS decedents are reported in\nTable 3. Among decedents, only the unadjusted expenditures\nassociated with all-cause hospitalizations were significantly\nlower for beneficiaries with dementia compared with those\nwithout dementia, regardless of residence. The adjusted\nresults show that among community decedents, the adjusted\nexpenditures for all-cause hospitalizations in the last year of\nthan for those without dementia ($23\nhome decedents, the adjusted expenditures for all-cause hos-\npitalizations were $8808 lower, on average, for individuals\n688) than for those without dementia\n496). Similarly, the adjusted expenditures for poten-\ntially avoidable hospitalizations were lower for decedents\nwith dementia than for those without dementia, by $366 for\ncommunity decedents and $2497 for nursing home\ndecedents.\nDiscussion\nOur results indicate that Medicare expenditures associated\nwith hospital and ED use for people with and without\nTable 2.

Previous research\nusing the same data shows that in the community, individuals\nwith dementia are more likely to be hospitalized than those\nwithout dementia.20 That same research found no significant\ndifference in hospitalization rates by dementia status among\nnursing home residents or among decedents in the last year\nof life. Yet in the current study, our estimates of hospitaliza-\ntion-associated Medicare expenditures for hospitalizations\nare significantly lower for nursing home residents and\ndecedents with dementia than those without dementia. It is\npossible that when people with dementia are hospitalized,\nthey may be treated with less aggressive or less costly care\nrelative to others without dementia.\nThe finding of higher Medicare expenditures among ben-\neficiaries with dementia in the community is consistent with\nother studies.9,13 However, our study provides more current\nestimates and distinguishes potentially avoidable utilization\nand expenditure patterns by residential setting. Our results\nsuggest that the growing numbers of Medicare beneficiaries\nwith dementia will likely increase hospital expenditures,\nmore so than what may be expected among beneficiaries\nwithout dementia.\nLimitations of this work relate to study measures and\ndata. First, people were identified as having dementia\nthrough survey responses and Medicare claims rather than\nthrough individual physician diagnosis. We used a hybrid\ndefinition of dementia, taking advantage of both Medicare\nTable 3.

Given evidence that relying on 1\nsource for classifying Alzheimer's disease leads to underre-\nporting of prevalence25,26 and expenditure estimates,27 this\nhybrid approach likely represents an improvement over stud-\nies that only use survey or claims data. However, the possi-\nbility of under- or overidentification or misclassifications\nremains. Furthermore, our dichotomous dementia measure is\nnot sensitive to disease severity or progression\nIn addition, our definition of potentially avoidable hospi-\ntalization and ED visits is the product of expert opinion\nrather than an assessment of whether specific hospitaliza-\ntions actually are avoidable.3,34-36 Moreover, there is limited\nresearch on potentially avoidable ED visits and no standard\ndefinitions, especially for older people and nursing home\nresidents; however, our approach is consistent with other\nFinally, the generalizability of our results is limited to\nelderly FFS Medicare beneficiaries who responded to the\nHRS and consented to provide access to their Medicare\nrecords. Thus, our results are not necessarily generalizable to\nthe general elderly population. This study focused only on\nexpenditures for hospital and ED use, and did not estimate\ntotal health care expenditures.\nThe major study finding that Medicare expenditures asso-\nciated with hospital and ED use vary by dementia status,\nresidential setting, and proximity to death points to several\nareas for further investigation. In light of the policy attention\nto hospitalizations, including readmissions and potentially\navoidable hospitalizations among Medicare beneficiaries,\nassessing the impact of ongoing initiatives or developing\nnew ones to reduce hospitalizations and readmissions among\ncommunity and nursing home residents with dementia is an\nimportant area for future research. In addition, as suggested\nby Clevenger and colleagues,38 further research is needed to\ninform evidence-based practice for treating people with\ndementia who present in the ED. Although some research\nhas examined the prevalence of dementia and associated\nof it is quite old. Thus, another important policy question\npertains to understanding the Medicare managed care popu-\nlation with dementia, especially given that roughly one-quar-\nter of elderly Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in managed\ncare organizations.42 Finally, considering the known varia-\ntion in EOL expenditures,43 more in-depth study is needed to\nshed light on EOL expenditures for beneficiaries with\ndementia, including those associated with hospice use.\nOur results on hospital and ED-associated Medicare\nexpenditures highlight the importance of addressing the\nneeds specific to the population with dementia. There are\nmany Medicare and Medicaid initiatives to reduce hospital\nadmissions, but none focus on people with dementia, who\naccount for a large share of expenditures for potentially\navoidable hospitalizations and ED use. However, it is not\nobvious what strategies would be effective in reducing these\ninappropriate expenditures. A recent systematic review of 10\ninterventions designed to reduce hospitalizations among\ncommunity-dwelling individuals with dementia found only 1\nto be effective.44 The high hospitalization and ED-related\nexpenditures by people with dementia in the community\nstrongly suggest the need to strengthen primary care for peo-\nple with dementia in the community. Future policy and\nresearch efforts should focus on specific initiatives to address\npeople with dementia that have the potential to reduce unnec-\nessary Medicare expenditures and improve the quality of life\nof people with these conditions.\nAuthors' Note\nThe statements contained in this article are those of the authors and\ndo not necessarily reflect the policies and views of ASPE or RTI\nInternational.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This\nwork was supported by the US Department of Health and Human\nServices (HHS) Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and\ninternal funding by RTI International.\nReferences\n1.
