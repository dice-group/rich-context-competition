In waves\nIII and IV, all wave I respondents were followed regardless of wave II\nparticipation. Wave III included 15,197 eligible original wave I respond-\nrespondents with complete measured height and weight data at waves II,\nIII, and IV (early release data). Those excluded from the sample (preg-\nnant females, and individuals lost to follow-up or lacking complete data)\nwere more likely to be Asian, older and from the lowest parental income\ntertile based on wave I data. However, obesity prevalence based on wave\nI self-reported weight and height was not statistically different for those\nincluded (10.8%) vs. excluded (10.4%). The survey design and sampling\nframe have been described elsewhere (3,4).\nStudy variables\nHeight and weight were measured at waves II, III, and IV during in-\nhome surveys using standardized procedures.

Obesity was defined as a BMI 95th percentile of the 2000 Centers for Disease Control/National Center for\nof adolescents were obese. By 2008, obesity prevalence increased to 36.1%, and was highest among non-Hispanic black\nfemales (54.8%). Ninety percent of the obese adolescents remained obese in 2008.

This trend is likely to continue owing to high rates of pediatric obesity. Effective preventive and\ntreatment efforts are critically needed.\n1Carolina Population Center, University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, Department of Nutrition, Gillings School of Global Public Health University of North Carolina,\nChapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.

Age at last birthday was reported.\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was carried out using Stata Version 10.0 (6). For inci-\ndence and prevalence estimates, we used survey procedures to correct\nfor multiple stages of cluster sample design and unequal probability\nof selection to ensure that our results were nationally representative.\nLongitudinal sample weights for waves I\u00adIII were used in the analysis,\nto provide correction for nonresponse bias over time (7). Data limita-\ntions precluded the use of sample weights for wave IV, but the longitudi-\nnal sample weights are likely to provide acceptable estimates given that\nthe analytic sample includes individuals present across all measurement\noccasions. Because the time periods between survey waves were not the\ndence rates (new cases between survey waves/number of years between\nsurveys). This approach assumes a constant rate of increase across the\nobserved time period. We used an F-statistic and t-test to compare\ngroup means of obesity prevalence across the three measurement peri-\nods and incidence across the two time intervals. For race/ethnic differ-\nences within sex and within age, the Bonferroni correction for multiple\ncomparisons was applied. To explore possible cohort effects, we defined\nand tested age differences where there was overlap (e.g., obesity rates for\nindividuals aged 19 years at wave II vs. those 19 years at wave III) using\ntwo-sided t-tests.\nResults\nacross sex and ethnicity (persistent and incident obesity col-\numns, Table 1). The vast majority (90%) of obese adolescents\nof black females, and 88% of males remained obese. Obesity\nprevalence was highest in the oldest age groups across all race/\nethnic categories. Less than 10% of individuals who were ini-\ntially obese at wave II became nonobese by wave IV.\n(Table 2). Annual obesity incidence was highest among black\nfemales. There were no statistically significant differences by\nbaseline age group across any of the obesity transitions.\nIn Figure 1, we provide an example of the differences in\nblacks vs. whites across baseline age cohort.

The longitudinal and racial/\nethnically diverse Add Health cohort uniquely captures lon-\ngitudinal trends in the understudied period from adolescence\nin the 1990s to the third decade of life.

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\nGrowth and Health Study followed a multicenter biracial\nyears documenting doubling of obesity prevalence into adult-\nstable racial differences in prevalence (13). In the biracial\nfollowed over a mean of 17.1 years, annual BMI increases were\n~30\u00ad40% higher in black vs. white females (14). Our data show\nthat black females start off with higher proportion of obesity,\nhave higher annual incidence rates, but the ratio of obesity\nprevalence in black vs. white females reduces over time.\nOur longitudinal, nationally representative, and ethnically\ndiverse data capture the transition from adolescence to middle\nadulthood over multiple measurement occasions. We find that\nthe upward trend in obesity continues into the adult years and\nis evident in both males and females and in all major US eth-\nnic groups. The public health implications of this upward trend\nin obesity prevalence are substantial. This early development,\npersistence, and incidence of obesity foreshadows increased\nmortality and morbidity (and potentially earlier onset) related\nto a variety of chronic diseases later in life (15\u00ad17). Although\nall groups are affected, black and Hispanic females seem par-\nticularly at risk. Our findings emphasize the critical need for\nfocus on obesity prevention before adulthood.\n"
