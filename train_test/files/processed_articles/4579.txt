The majority of the\nnext section addresses what the \"Myth of the Given\" is, the\nways in which it was formulated by analytic philosophers\nand, briefly, how it relates to philosophical pragmatism. In the\nfollowing section \"The Experiential Givenism Debate,\" the\ndebate over experiential givenism--a debate mainly between\npragmatists--receives closer scrutiny, including accounts of\nthe two main positions. The section \"Dewey on Qualitative\nThought\" relies on a careful reading of Dewey's essay\n\"Qualitative Thought\" to suggest the possibility that experi-\nence is phenomenologically, not empirically, given. In the\nsection \"Johnson on Embodied Cognition,\" a more precise\nphenomenological account of Dewey's theory of experience\nsurfaces in Mark Johnson's notion of embodied cognition.\n\"Misunderstanding Dewey's Experiential Metaphysics\"\nreveals how several participants in the debate misunderstand\nDewey's theory of experience. The concluding section\naddresses the debate's implications and why we might wish to\ntake it more seriously.\nWhat is the Myth of the Given?\nWhile most (if not all) analytic philosophers believe that the\nMyth of the Given is a genuine philosophical problem, very\nfew continental philosophers and pragmatists share their\nconcern. Still, due to the ability of pragmatist ideas to cross,\nfuse, preserve, and influence multiple traditions--what\nJoseph Margolis (2010) calls \"pragmatism's advantage\"\n(p. 1)--it is perhaps unsurprising that analytic pragmatists\nwould attempt to square the Myth of the Given with pragma-\ntist theories of experience (Ralston, 2011). In this way, the\nexperiential givenism debate represents a vital link between\nthe parallel traditions of analytic philosophy and pragma-\ntism. I first briefly address the Myth of the Given exchange\nin the analytic philosophy literature before moving to the\nparallel debate in the pragmatist literature. My account of the\nMyth of the Given debates in analytic philosophy is not\nintended to be exhaustive. The extant literature on this topic\nis far too extensive to completely summarize here. Instead,\nmine is a synoptic account meant only to shed light on the\nexperiential givenism debate in the pragmatist literature.\nImagine you are standing in an amphitheater and sus-\npended above your head is a large green translucent cube.\nWhen you look up to observe the cube, you have a specific\nvisual experience. Call this experience E. For clarity, think of\nE as having a list of phenomenal properties that compose its\nsensible/perceptual (or if you are a Kantian, intuitional) con-\ntent: phenomenal property GREEN, phenomenal property\nLARGE, phenomenal property TRANSLUCENT, phenom-\nenal property CUBISH, and so on and so forth. Traditional\nempiricists appreciate experiences such as E as the ultimate\nfont of empirical knowledge. When a human observer has an\nE, she will typically form the belief that there exists a large\ntranslucent green cube above her. Why is this? There are two\nmental events and an inferential pattern at work here; experi-\nence E and belief B, such that an experience with the same\nset of phenomenal properties, that is, the same sensible/per-\nceptual content, results in the same belief about that content.\nIf the belief is put in form \"That is a large translucent green\ncube up there,\" then it has propositional content too.\nOne view (often ascribed to Donald Davidson) is that\nhaving some direct or nonconceptually mediated awareness\nof perceptual content, in this case E, simply causes a concep-\ntual belief, in this case B. However, this view is problematic,\nas \"it is a. . . Myth to think [that] sensibility by itself, without\nany involvement of capacities that belong to our rationality,\ncan make things available for our cognition\" (McDowell,\nwarrant for descriptive causation: \"[W]e are not giving an\nempirical description . . . [but] we are placing it [the percep-\ntual content] in the logical space of reasons, of justifying and\nbeing able to justify what one says\" (p. 169). Sellars con-\nceives the relation between experience E and belief B not as\none of causation, but of justification \"in the logical space of\nreasons\" (Calcaterra, 2011, p. xix). However, the objection\nto Sellars' account (often ascribed to John McDowell) is that\nperceptual experience is not thoroughly nonconceptual and\nnoninferential content, subsequently carved up in a \"space of\nreasons.\" Hence, it is not made ready to receive conceptual\ncontent vis-\u00e0-vis the observing agent's cognition; rather,\nexperience comes to the agent with conceptual content\nalready there. To appreciate the lesson of Immanuel Kant's\n(1929) Critique of Pure Reason, \"Thought without content is\nempty, intuitions without content are blind\" (p. 93).\nUnderstanding involves the synthesis of intuitions and con-\ncepts, not intuitions alone. To claim that perceptual content is\nnonconceptual and thus experientially given, McDowell\n(2004) asserts, is to accept that \"the space of reasons is . . .\nmore extensive than the space of concepts\" (p. 6). Surely this\nview is wrong, though, for concepts prefigure reasons. So, to\npreserve the reason-giving relation between E and B, experi-\nence must first be conceptually articulated, just as beliefs\nOne mistaken assumption is that givenism is identical to\nfoundationalism. However, the two, while related, are never-\ntheless distinguishable. Whereas foundationalism structures\nthe epistemic warrant for beliefs in terms of some noninfer-\nentially justified foundation (i.e., a basic or foundational\nbelief), givenism points to the origin of the warrant as non-\nconceptual, noninferential content offering an \"autonomous\nexperiential givenism, though perfectly consistent with\nempiricist foundationalism, does not necessarily entail that\nsame foundationalism.According to McDowell (2004), if we\nare to understand experience as \"a tribunal, mediating the\nway our thinking is answerable to how things area,\" then\nhow we determine the ways in which experience is tribunal-\nlike depends on what is meant by the term experience, not\nthough, the worry is that by appealing to experience as the\nultimate arbiter of epistemic claims, they are invoking expe-\nrience as a primordial given, grounding knowledge on expe-\nriential foundations. Thus, their appeals to experience qua\ngiven are incompatible with their professed antifoundation-\nThe Experiential Givenism Debate\nAlthough dispute over the Myth of the Given emerged in a\nvibrant exchange between analytic philosophers, including\ncrossed over to another philosophical tradition: American\npragmatism. In this new domain, what has ensued is a\nsmaller, though no less heated, debate between a select\ngroup of classical pragmatist and neo-pragmatist scholars.\nClassical pragmatists are those scholars who see them-\nselves as expounding and extending the views of pragma-\ntist figures such as William James, John Dewey and Charles\nSanders Peirce, while neo-pragmatists have developed\nmore syncretic forms of pragmatism (usually joined with\nstrands of continental, analytic, and postmodernist philoso-\nphy). In \"Pragmatism, Experience, and the Given,\" Scott\nAikin (2009) contends that Dewey's experiential metaphys-\nics invokes a noninferential, nonconceptual given, namely,\nthe notion of experience itself. He isolates a single passage\nin Dewey's oeuvre to demonstrate that the distinction\nbetween an empiricist and pragmatist theory of experience\nis one of degree, not kind:\nEmpiricism is conceived as tied up with what has been, or is\n\"given.\" But experience in its vital form is experimental, an\neffort to change the given; it is characterized by projection, by\nreaching forward into the unknown; connection with the future\nWhile empiricists such as David Hume focus on \"what we\ncan understand in terms of the given,\" pragmatists such as\nJohn Dewey emphasize \"how it [the given] can be put to use\"\n(Aikin, 2009, p. 24). The difference is between sensible con-\ntent that updates our beliefs and sensible content that updates\nour beliefs for a specific purpose. On the pragmatist account,\nthat purpose is use. Pragmatism is, then, only one step\nremoved from empiricism in its treatment of experience as\ninitially given. As Dewey denies that experience is \"exclu-\nsively a knowledge affair,\" Aikin (2009) reminds his reader\nthat it \"is at least partially a knowledge affair, and the DG\n[Doctrine of the Given] is an explanation of how that is so\"\n(p. 24). The pragmatist emulates the empiricist, assuming\nthat nonconceptual and noninferential perceptual content,\nthat is, givens, are raw material for an agent's cognition,\nfrom which she draws inferences and carves up experience\ninto increasingly complex conceptual and propositional con-\ntent. The claim that experience is shot through with givens in\nthis sense is, of course, a myth. As McDowell demonstrates,\nexperience already comes to us flush with its own conceptual\ncontent. So, Aikin (2009) concludes that Dewey and some\nDeweyans fall into the trap of experiential givenism and\nfoundationalism when they appeal to experience as ground-\ning further knowledge claims and beliefs (e.g., \"experience\nteaches us such-and-such\") as well as \"some non-inferential\ncognitive input . . . necessary for inquiry\" (p. 24).\nColin Koopman's version of the experiential givenism\nobjection, while similar to Aikin's, is more sweeping in its\nscope. Pragmatism scholars lean heavily on experience that\nis had or felt (precognitively) as a justification for epistemic\nand moral claims resulting from rigorous inquiry. By choos-\ning a nonconceptual ground (experience) for a knowledge-\ngenerating process (inquiry), they inadvertently succumb to\nthe Myth of the Given. According to Koopman (2009), this is\nunsurprising, as John Dewey was prone to the same mistake.\nThe essay that demonstrates Dewey's flirtation with experi-\nential givenism is his 1915 \"The Logic of Judgments of\nPractice\" (pp. 83-84). While Dewey initially argues against\nthe possibility of immediate perceptual experience, he even-\ntually lapses into talk of perceptual givens available for\nagents to take or select for use in cognition. Admittedly,\nDewey's notions of experience and inquiry were somewhat\ninchoate in this early essay. Still, Koopman warns, \"given-\nism could creep back into Dewey's theory of knowledge by\nway of his conception of those initial indeterminacies that in\nhis mature epistemology and logic play the role of motiva-\ntors for inquiry\" (p. 84). When classical pragmatists build\nDewey's metaphysics of experience on the stilts of experien-\ntial givens, it is nearly identical to placing it on empiricist\nfoundations. In Koopman's words, it involves \"put[ting]\nforth their metaphysics in the wrong kind of way, such that\ntheir metaphysics resembles first philosophy more than it\nresembles a postulated tool of inquiry\" (p. 83). Not only does\nthe positing of experiential givens conflict with classical\npragmatists' antifoundationalism, but it also, and more dev-\nastatingly, undermines the entire pragmatist project of recon-\nstructing philosophy as a historicist and meliorist enterprise.\nIn the shadow of experiential givenism and empiricist foun-\ndationalism, pragmatist philosophy reverts to the same\n\"quest for certainty\" that Dewey so staunchly opposed.\nTo date, only two Dewey scholars, David Hildebrand and\nGregory Pappas, have responded to Koopman's experiential\ngivenism objection. While it is far from complete, their\nreview of Koopman's book suggests some possible strategies\nfor articulating a more comprehensive response. Hildebrand\n4 SAGE Open\nand Pappas (2010) summarize Koopman's objection as fol-\nlows: \"The charge against CPs [Classic Pragmatists] like\nDewey was that their use . . . of experience . . . encouraged\nthem toward tacit acceptance of the trans-experiential\n`Given' which Wilfrid Sellars warned about.\" Instead of an\noriginal objection, they see it as a resuscitated or \"repurposed\n. . . charge\" that Richard Rorty made \"against Dewey\"\nbrought to bear \"against CP [Classical Pragmatism] in gen-\neral\" (p. 3).3 For Hildebrand and Pappas, the objection draws\nbattle-lines between classical pragmatists, who lean heavily\non Dewey's unifying notion of experience, and neo-pragma-\ntists, who are moved instead by more variegated appeals to\nlanguage, culture, and discourse. However, the experiential\ngivenism objection is clearly misdirected, they contend, as\nno conclusive textual proof of givenism or foundationalism\ncan be detected in Dewey's oeuvre. Moreover, Sellars's\nMyth of the Given implicates knowing (or in Aikin's words\n\"a knowing affair\"), not experiencing (in Dewey's more\ntotalizing sense):\n[T]he target of Sellar's [sic] critique is a certain conception of\nknowledge--experience in the modern sense; but this is not\n\"experience\" in Dewey's dominant sense, namely, the best\nmethodological starting point for a melioristic philosophy in a\nprocessual world. (p. 5)\nExperience (or lived experience) offers agents a practical\n\"starting point\" from which to launch inquiries, solve prob-\nlems, and improve life's conditions, as well as a point to\nreturn to in a \"processual world\" of what Dewey called\n\"doing and undergoing.\" While Hildebrand and Pappas's\nreply to Koopman clarifies the two positions in the experien-\ntial givenism debate, it only travels parts of the journey\ntoward offering a full account of Dewey's experiential meta-\nphysics, let alone one that repels the experiential givenism\nobjection.\nDewey on Qualitative Thought\nOne of the best single writings illustrating the technical nature\nthe empiricism espoused by many early analytic philoso-\nphers, human experience does not begin with the reception of\nsensible impressions, sense data, or other atomistic elements\nin the experienced world, but comes to us in full bloom as\nqualities initially felt or had in a \"situation\" and later selected\nand determined as \"objects in thought\" (Dewey, 1996, LW\n5:246). Throughout the history of philosophy, qualities have\nbeen relegated to a lower station relative to objects, concepts,\nand classes, whether properties of mind-independent objects\n(in realist metaphysics), predicates of actual or formal con-\ncepts (in Aristotelian and formal logic), or characteristics of\nclasses (in set theory). Objects, concepts, and classes are dis-\ntinctive and objectively quantifiable, whereas qualities are\nvague and only subjectively appreciated. However, as Dewey\n(1996) observes in his \"stoical red Indian\" example, the for-\nmer fail to capture the experiential richness of phenomena:\nTake the proposition: \"The red Indian is stoical.\" This is\ninterpreted either as signifying that the Indian in question is\ncharacterized by the property of stoicism in addition to that of\nredness, or that he belongs to the class of stoical objects. The\nordinary direct sense of the proposition escapes recognition in\neither case. For this sense expresses the fact that the indigenous\nAmerican was permeated throughout by a certain quality, instead\nof being an object possessing a certain quality along with others.\nHe lived, acted, endured stoically (LW 2:244).\nAccording to Dewey, the experience of the stoic Native\nAmerican is permeated through and through by a certain felt\nquality that is had prior to being selected, determined, and\ncognized. The experience occurs within the context of a situ-\nation, or \"a complex existence that is held together in spite of\nits internal complexity by the fact that it is dominated and\ncharacterized by a single quality\" (LW 5:246). The single\npervasive quality is a quality of the total situation, not of the\nselected object. In contrast, the analytic philosopher under-\nstands the agent as having experience E, of which its phe-\nnomenal properties are Red, Indian, and Stoical. As the\nproperties Indian and Stoical would, in all likelihood, be\nreducible to another set of more basic sensible properties, let\nus consider just the single phenomenal property of Red. In\nscientific parlance, the retinal and neuronal patterns indicate\nto the perceiver that the object is red. In the language of rep-\nresentationalist epistemology, the Red sense data or sense\nimpression inside my head corresponds to the red object in\nthe external world. However, the ordinary experience of the\nstoic Native American in its qualitative wholeness eludes\ndetection, as the decomposed or analyzed experience cannot\ndo justice to the experience that \"[h]e lived, acted, endured\nHow does Dewey's essay speak to the experiential given-\nism objection? In short, Dewey believes that the primary rea-\nson analytic philosophers mistake the quality of a situation\nfor a property of an object is that they subscribe to a very\nlimited \"subject-predicate theory of propositions\" (LW\n5:245). Critically important for this theory is the idea that the\n\"subject is `given'--ultimately apart from thinking--and\nthen thought adds to what is given a further determination or\nelse assigns it to a ready-made class of things\" (LW 5:245).\nPredication and classification are cognitive operations per-\nformed (or added) to a perceived object--once converted\ninto the subject of a proposition, but initially outside the\nbounds of thought (i.e., nonconceptual). The simplest cri-\ntique of this propositional theory of knowledge is that not all\nexperience involves cognition. Some experiences are felt or\nhad, not analyzed, or known. The more complex and forceful\ncriticism is that the attribution of properties to objects in the\nabsence any consideration for the quality of the total situa-\ntion mistakes propositional knowledge for the method by\nwhich it is obtained. The proposition is not given prior to\nthought (i.e., nonconceptually) as a sensible object of experi-\nence. Instead, the proposition is the outcome of inquiry, the\nresult of selecting, determining, attributing, predicating, and\nclassifying objects only after initially experiencing the situa-\ntion permeated throughout by a certain quality. Appreciating\nexperience as an assembly of preexisting objects to which\nagents attach phenomenal properties, as many analytic phi-\nlosophers do, involves positing a given (or subject of propo-\nsitional knowledge) and thereby ignoring the qualitatively\nrich background against which cognitive operations occur.\nthe selective determination and relation of objects is controlled\nby reference to a situation--to that which is constituted by a\npervasive and internally integrating quality, so that failure to\nacknowledge the situation leaves, in the end, the logical force of\nobjects and their relations inexplicable. (LW 5:246)\nThe problem of given-ness, according to Dewey (1996),\nlies not in the qualitatively rich experience that we initially\nfeel or have in a \"situation\" and later select and determine as\n\"objects in thought\" and inquiry (LW 5:246). Rather, it lies in\nthe faulty assumption that experience lacks these pervasive\nqualities, except insofar as we intellectually convert percep-\ntual content into propositional form, attribute properties, and\nthereby transform that content into proper objects of knowl-\nedge. Therefore, the way in which Sellars frames the Myth of\nthe Given, i.e., as a problem of how to ground knowledge in\nempirically present, nonconceptual content, falls prey to\nDewey's charge of given-ness (or version of the Myth of the\nGiven), for it neglects the felt quality of the total situation out\nof which sensible content is only later discriminated.\nJohnson on Embodied Cognition\nWhile the strength of Dewey's metaphysics resides in its\nability to capture the qualitative immediacy of what is gener-\nically referred to as experience, it might appear weak as a\nfactual-scientific explanation of embodied cognition. Mark\nJohnson addresses this shortcoming in his work on how cog-\nnitive science and neuroscience support Dewey's theory of\nexperience.\nIn Experience and Nature, Dewey argued for an emergent\nconcept of mind, or what he calls \"body-mind,\" whereby antic-\nipating future contingencies involves a reciprocal dance\nbetween brain, body, and nervous system, not merely conscious\ncontrol over actions. For Dewey (1996), \"body-mind\" is\nwhat actually takes place when a living body is implicated in\nsituations [. . . where] \"body\" designates the continued and\nconserved, the registered and cumulative operation of factors\ncontinuous with the rest of nature, inanimate as well as animate;\nwhile \"mind\" designates the characters and consequences which\nare differential, indicative of features which emerge when\n\"body\" is engaged in a wider, more complex and interdependent\nFurthermore, he claims that,\nwhen locomotor organs are accompanied by distance receptors,\nresponse to the distant in space becomes increasingly prepotent\nand equivalent in effect to response to the future in time. A\nresponse toward what is in the future is in effect a prediction of\nConsciousness for Dewey is the capacity for judgment\nformation. Dewey's emergent theory of mind was not the\nproduct of armchair philosophizing, but the result of care-\nfully translating research by members of theAmerican school\nof neurology, includingAdolf M. Child, C. L. Herrick, Henry\nDonaldson, and Frederick Tilney, into terms suitable for a lay\nadvances in neurological and cognitive science research\nhave superseded these findings. Nevertheless, Johnson\n(2007) argues that recent studies, especially on brain archi-\ntecture, \"make sense of Dewey's claim that our experience\nalways begins with a pervasive unifying quality of a whole\nsituation, within which we then discriminate objects, with\ntheir properties and relations to each other\" (p. 100).\nJohnson's best evidence that brain science supports\nDewey's theory of experience comes from the work of cog-\nnitive neuroscientist Don Tucker. Tucker examines the archi-\ntecture of the brain, noticing that there is a \"core-shell\nstructure\" that supports a \"higher\" level capacity to think\nconceptually as well as \"lower\" level abilities to feel and\nTo vastly oversimplify, our brain developed through evolution\nby adding new structures and layers on top of more primitive\nparts shared with some other animals. The present-day result is\na brain with core limbic structures (mostly responsible for\nbody monitoring, motivation, emotions, and feelings) that are\nconnected to \"higher\" cortical layers that have ever more\ndifferentiated functions, such as perception, body movement,\naction planning, and reasoning. One striking feature of this\ncore-shell organization is that structures in the core regions are\nmassively interconnected, whereas structures in the shell are\nsparsely interconnected. An important consequence of this is\nthat there is more functional differentiation and more\nmodularity of brain areas in the cortical shell than in the limbic\nOrganisms with this more evolved brain architecture can\nselect, distinguish, and analyze objects, signify the meanings\nof concepts, and make inferential leaps, relying on the brain's\ncortical shell, once they have felt (or had) an experience of\nthe qualitatively whole situation, relying on the brain's lim-\nbic core. Shifting between core limbic structures to shell cor-\ntical structures, the outcome is a two-level \"core-to-shell\nmovement of cognition\" from detecting a single pervasive\n6 SAGE Open\nquality in the situation to engaging in more advanced opera-\ntions, such as conceptual thinking and ratiocination (p. 101).\nAs an outgrowth of this highly evolved brain architec-\nture, sensorimotor trends structure the ways in which body-\nminds encounter environments, physically and conceptually.\nIn what Johnson (2007) calls \"image schemas,\" we can iden-\ntify \"dynamic, recurring pattern[s] of organism-environment\ninteractions\" (p. 136). Our bodily architecture allows us to\nview objects in certain ways and then to extend these into\nhigher level concepts and even inferences. For instance, the\n\"CONTAINER image schema\" permits us to conceive an\nobject as being in another object, whether a fly in a bottle or\na brain in a body (p. 139). Likewise, the \"SOURCE-PATH-\nGOAL\" schema allows agents to understand progression\nfrom an origin along a route as an advance toward the objec-\ntive.As image schemas press the limits of our combined brain\narchitecture and perceptual fields, they are neither restricted\nto the mind or the body; they implicate both. By synthesizing\nimage schemas, Johnson notes, it is possible to understand\nmore complex linguistic operations (e.g., into combines\nCONTAINER and SOURCE-PATH schema) and inferences\n(such as transitivity through double CONTAINMENT; pp.\nWhat Johnson offers is no less than credible scientific\nsupport for Dewey's theory of experience. Recent studies on\nbrain architecture and function substantiate Dewey's account\nof how experience ebbs and flow between its primary and\nsecondary phases.\nMisunderstanding Dewey's Experiential\nMetaphysics\nHaving presented the Myth of the Given, the experiential\ngivenism debate, one of Dewey's best explanations of his\ntheory of experience and Johnson's evidence that the theory\nis scientifically warranted, I would like to return to the expe-\nriential givenism debate with the express purpose of identi-\nfying some critical mistakes on both sides. My intention is\nnot to resolve the issue. Nor is it to defend classic pragma-\ntists or Deweyans against neo-pragmatists. Instead, it is to\nprovide a robust account of Dewey's metaphysics of experi-\nence and then pinpoint some of the difficulties encountered\nby the debate's participants. It is apropos that Dewey would\ndevise a \"metaphysics\" for describing the generic traits or\nqualities of experience, rather than (pace McDowell) merely\ndescribing what we mean by the term experience or (pace\nRorty) jettisoning the term metaphysics altogether.\nDewey's metaphysics divulges the generic qualities and\npatterns that underlie our experience of the felt and known\nworld. In the history of philosophy, brilliant figures, from\nPlato to Kant to Russell, were mistaken in claiming that cog-\nnition, knowing, or reasoning is either the predominant or the\nonly feature of so-called real or really real human experi-\nence. Rather, it is a small part of our experience of the natural\nworld and a single mode among many for appreciating what\nDewey terms the \"generic traits of existence.\" \"A naturalistic\nmetaphysics,\" Dewey notes, \"is bound to consider reflection\nas itself a natural event occurring within nature because of\nthe traits of the latter\" (LW 1:62). As they are bound up with\nthese generic traits, our experiences of natural events are\nobjective and cognitively rich. However, objectivity here\ndoes not mean purely factual, impartial, a God's-eye view or\ntranscending all perspectives. The tendency to bifurcate our\nexperience into categories of pure objectivity and plural,\nsubjective perspectives is one that Dewey eschews in his\nnaturalistic metaphysics. Instead, the cognitive foreground\nof analyzing and resolving problematic situations occurs\nagainst the noncognitive (or precognitive) background of a\nsituation, initially felt or had and pervaded by a single unify-\ning quality.\nThe degree of affectivity and qualitative wholeness versus\nobjectivity and cognitive-richness is reflected in Dewey's\ndistinction between two phases of experience: (a) primary\nand (b) secondary. Only when humans are confronted with\nan entirely novel and problematic situation do they shift from\n\"primary experience,\" which is habitually \"had\" and medi-\nated by previously formed habit, to \"secondary experience,\"\nwhich demands genuine reflection, \"knowing\" and inquiry.\n\"The distinction [between primary and secondary experi-\nence],\" Dewey (1996) explains, \"is one between what is\nexperienced as a result of a minimum of incidental refection\nand what is experienced in consequence of continued and\nregulated reflective inquiry\" (LW 1:3-4). While the dominant\nmode of experience for Dewey is what Lenore Langsdorf\n(2002) calls \"a complex affair of doing and undergoing . . .\nthat is `felt'rather than `known'\" (p. 151), experience is nev-\nertheless a cyclical, ebb-and-flow movement between pre-\ncognitive or felt havings and cognitive knowings (Ralston,\nThe outcome of each successful inquiry is that experience\ngrows in ordered richness. Dewey (1996) defines inquiry as\nthe \"controlled or directed transformation of an indeterminate\nsituation into a [determinate and unified] situation\" (LW\n12:55). \"The existence of inquiries,\" Dewey claims in the\nLogic, \"is not a matter of doubt. They enter into every area of\nlife and into every aspect of every area\" (LW 12:105). In\n\"secondary experience,\" inquirers ideally achieve the objec-\ntives of inquiry and, consequently, deliver the objects or out-\ncomes of inquiry to \"primary,\" practical, or everyday\nexperience as settled meanings. The net result is that experi-\nence becomes enriched with an ensemble of intelligent habits\nrience, or what Kenneth Chandler (1977) calls the \"alpha and\nomega of all theorizing,\" also renders ideational tools avail-\nRyan, 2004, p. 20). So, once learned through focused inquiry\nthese experiential lessons are stored or funded as resources in\nprimary experience for use in future inquiries. Henceforth,\nthey can be accessed and acted on easily, framing our ongoing\nexperiences in intelligent and habit-governed ways. In the\nlanguage of cognitive neuroscience, those neural connections\nresponsible for conceptual meaning at the shell cortical layers\ncan in turn impact structures at the limbic level responsible\nmotivation and emotional well-being, thereby producing\nwhat Johnson (2007) calls \"a never-ending dance of changing\nWhat this rendering of Dewey's experiential metaphysics\nreveals is that parties on both sides of the experiential given-\nism debate are clearly right on some points, but nearly as\nwrong on others. Aikin (2007) is correct that experience is\n\"at least partially a knowledge affair,\" though it is predomi-\nnantly about having or feeling (primary experience).\nHowever, he is only half-right in claiming that givens for\nDewey are \"non-inferential cognitive input . . . necessary for\ninquiry\" (p. 24). The resources funded in primary experience\n(habits, meanings, ideas, and concepts) do provide inputs for\nfuture inquiries. However, primary experience's resources\nare inferential, as they are themselves the products of prior\ninquiries (secondary experience) made available for subse-\nquent inquiries through the funding of experience (secondary\nexperience again) with habits, values, and concepts. As\nJohnson (2007) reminds us, many of our most reliable lin-\nguistic operations, metaphors, and habits of inference are\nbased on image schemas (such as CONTAINMENT and\nSOURCE-PATH-GOAL) that are made available to us as\nresources in primary experience (p. 139).\nTo recall Koopman's objection, it is that Dewey's theory\nof experience invokes the mythical notion of a Given.\nWhether the theory actually does is a point of contention\nbetween him and some classical pragmatists. Hildebrand and\nPappas respond that the Myth of the Given is tied up with\nproblems of traditional epistemology. As experience for\nDewey bears no relation to knowledge proper, he cannot be\nblamed for invoking foundational givens. Thus, Hildebrand\nand Pappas deny the charge of experiential givenism because\nprimary experience, at least for Dewey, is about having or\nfeeling, not knowing or cognizing. Whose position is stron-\nger? Hildebrand and Pappas are correct in asserting that pri-\nmary experience is not about knowledge if they mean that it\nis not exclusively about knowledge. However, they are wrong\nif they mean that primary experience is wholly noncognitive.\nPrimary experience funds secondary experience with cogni-\ntive resources (perhaps precognitive or transcognitive is a\nmore apt adjective). When secondary experience generates\ntools, habits, concepts, and logical forms as outcomes of\ninquiry, these are then funded (or re-funded) back into pri-\nmary experience so that they can serve as resources in future\ninquiries (marking the return of secondary experience). So,\nKoopman is correct if he means that primary experience\nloosely resembles an experiential given in the Sellarsian\nsense, at least insofar as it \"constitutes the ultimate court of\nappeals for all factual claims--particular and general--about\nhe intends to claim that primary experience must, therefore,\nbe a primordial given. Unlike a given, primary experience is\nthrough-and-through inferential (the resources available in\nprimary experience are inferred through inquiry or second-\nary experience) and at least partially conceptual (many,\nthough not all, of the resources in primary experience have\nconceptual content).\nFinally, Koopman and Aikin's inference from experiential\ngivenism to empiricist foundationalism is an illicit move of\nentailment or equivocation. In contrast, Sellars (1963) makes\nthe inference from experiential givenism to empiricist foun-\ndationalism, but on the sound basis of an elaborate theory\ntying verbal and nonverbal events and takings:\nThe idea of observation . . . constituted by certain self-\nauthenticating nonverbal episodes, the authority of which is\ntransmitted to verbal and quasi-verbal performances . . . is, of\ncourse, the heart of the Myth of the Given. For the given, in\nepistemological tradition, is what is taken by these self-\nauthenticating episodes. These \"takings\" are, so to speak, the\nunmoved movers of empirical knowledge, the \"knowings in\npresence\" which are presupposed by all other knowledge, both\nthe knowledge of general truth and the knowledge \"in absence\"\nof other particular matters of fact. Such is the framework in\nwhich traditional empiricism makes its characteristic claim that\nthe perceptually given is the foundation of empirical knowledge.\nNotwithstanding a sophisticated Sellarsian account, the\nrelationship between givenism and foundationalism is more\noften one of equivocation, not entailment. For the charges of\ngivenism and foundationalism to stick (and by implication,\nthe pragmatist's project of philosophical reconstruction to\nfail), the critic must first substantiate the presence of a non-\ninferential and nonconceptual content to the given (concern-\ning the origin of the warrant of belief) and, second,\ndemonstrate that the structure of the warrant is identical to\nprimary experience (hence foundational). Clearly, the critics\nhave been unable to accomplish either. Until they do, the\nexperiential givenism objection remains at best a dubious\ncharge. Although a fuller case would need to be made, it\nappears that the structure of the warrant of belief is found in\ninquiry or secondary (not primary) experience. It is only by\nexperimentally testing beliefs, on Dewey's (1996) account of\ninquiry, that they become \"warranted\" or \"warranted asser-\nempted by primary experience, this could lead to the\nconclusion that primary experience is the ultimate source of\nthe warrant of our beliefs, and thus a version of the given.\nOnce again, though, primary experience provides some of\nthe conceptual resources for that warrant, and so cannot be\nthe same nonconceptual given that worried Sellars, Davidson,\nand McDowell.\nConclusion\nThe experiential givenism debate still occupies a marginal\nplace in mainstream Philosophy and American pragmatism\n8 SAGE Open\nliterature. So, what moves might shift it away from the mar-\ngin and toward the center of concern? In the discipline of\nPublic Administration, a similar debate emerged, but with a\ngreater emphasis on the implications for the practice of gov-\nernance.5 At the very least, a more practical orientation could\nnudge the debate beyond the current state of impasse. Given\nJohn Dewey's concern for \"the problems of men\" (MW\n10:42), it is unsurprising that classic pragmatist would prefer\nthis route. However, it is also a suggestion that would likely\nplease neo-pragmatists who, following Richard Rorty's\n(1996) similar call, substitute \"idealizations of our practices\n. . . [for] foundations for those practices\" (p. 333). Likewise,\nRobert Brandom (2008) believes that a paramount concern\nfor practice binds classical pragmatists and neo-pragmatists,\nDeweyans and Rortyans:\nThe only question that remains [once we eliminate questions of\ntruth and objectivity] is one of social engineering: what shape do\nour practices need to take in order to institute this kind of\nnormative status? This is a Deweyian question that Rorty would\nhave welcomed. (p. 10)\nThe proposal to engage the practical side of experiential\ngivenism will strike some as odd, though, as the debate\noccurs at such a high level of abstraction, insulated from the\npractical concerns of most nonphilosophers (perhaps reflect-\ning its origins in analytic philosophy's obscure epistemology\nliterature).\nNevertheless, there is some practical value to the proposal--\nvalue that becomes evident once we view it through the prism\nof Ludwig Wittgenstein's (1922) aphorism of climbing a lad-\nder. We must climb the ladder of a philosophical problem to\neventually kick it away. In doing so, we therapeutically over-\ncome it (Colapietro, 2011). Therefore, classic pragmatists,\nneo-pragmatists, and nonpragmatists alike should take this\nheretofore marginal debate seriously for at least two reasons.\nFirst, it highlights critically important issues at the intersection\nbetween two major philosophical traditions (analytic philoso-\nphy and American pragmatism) as well as two prominent\nbranches of the same tradition (classic pragmatism and neo-\npragmatism). Resolving the debate could potentially bridge\ngaps and facilitate conversation between these diverse tradi-\ntions and branches, thereby making Philosophy as a discipline\nmore inclusive--or what Koopman (2009) calls a \"big-tent\"\n(p. 48). Second, and perhaps more importantly, working\nthrough or getting over this theoretical debate (following\nWittgenstein's aphorism) could empower contemporary prag-\nmatists, especially Deweyans, to return to what they arguably\ndo best: the practical business of pragmatic inquiry or testing\nphilosophical ideas for the sake of evaluating their concrete\nconsequences in lived experience.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNotes\n1.

Although Rorty (1979) extensively discussed the Myth of the\nGiven in his first book, he never used it to criticize Dewey's\ntheory of experience. He did worry that Dewey's experiential\nmetaphysics, just by virtue of it being called \"metaphysics,\"\nwould reinvigorate the foundationalist metaphysics of the past.\nThis is likely what Hildebrand and Pappas are referring to when\nthey claim that Koopman has \"repurposed Rorty's charge.\"\n4. This might be a slight overstatement in the case of Dewey's\ntheory of experience, as inquiry tests beliefs and thus is closer\nto what Sellars (1997) calls \"the ultimate court of appeals\"\n5. A parallel debate about experiential givenism, antifounda-\ntionalism, and pragmatism was waged by pragmatists--most\nnotably, Patricia Shields (2003)--and neo-pragmatists--espe-\ncially Hugh Miller (2005)--concerned about the relationship\nbetween public administration theory and practice.
