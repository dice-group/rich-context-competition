(2009),\nthat resilience connotes the ability to adapt positively to adversity.\nResilience scores have been demonstrated to be positively correlated with mental\nhealth and physical functioning of the elderly (Wagnild 2003; Hardy, Concato, and Gill\n2002), as well as with self-rated successful aging (Lamond et al. 2009) in developed\ncountries. Other studies have explored how resilience ameliorated the negative effect of\nadverse events on health and well-being. For instance, Windle, Woods, and Markland\n(2008) discovered that psychological resilience moderated the negative effect of chronic\nillness on subjective well-being among the elderly aged 60+ in England. Furthermore,\nseveral researchers have shown that resilient elderly people were more likely to\nwhich were found to promote health and longevity (Levy, Slade, and Kasl 2002; Giltay\nHowever, three aspects of the previous studies limited the development of research\non resilience in aging. Above all, most of the prior studies were based on small\nsamples, with especially limited numbers of the oldest-old subjects (Wagnild 2003;\nLamond et al. 2009), which restricted the estimation efficiency. Second, many studies\nwere cross-sectional (Hardy, Concato, and Gill 2002; Windle, Woods, and Markland\n2008; Lamond et al. 2009) and few were based on longitudinal survey data. The cross-\nsectional design could not provide time of death, which would be the key to exploring\nthe association between resilience and survival. Third, almost all previous studies on\nthis topic dealt with developed countries. However, the elderly populations in\ndeveloping countries such as China, South Korea, India, and Mexico are increasing at a\nmuch faster rate and on a much larger scale than that in the developed countries (U.N.\n2005). Our current study tried to make contributions in these three aspects to enhance\nresearch on resilience in aging.\n2. Data and measurements\nThe data used in this paper were from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity\n2009 in a randomly selected half of the counties, smaller cities at county level and\ndistricts under the large cities at prefecture or provincial level in 22 Chinese provinces,\nDemographic Research: Volume 23, Article 5\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 107\nyounger elderly individuals, aged 65-79, were also included in the sample.\nof resilience on survival among the elderly aged 65+ over a 3-year interval. The main\nadvantage of applying a longitudinal dataset in this study is to learn about the influence\nof the resilience on mortality among the elderly who participated in 2002 survey, while\ncontrolling for various confounding factors including initial health status. We excluded\nthose who were lost to follow-up in the 2005 survey (11.9% of the initial sample) and\nthe 61 deceased who had missing information on the time of death.3 The final sample\nAs CLHLS was a demographic survey rather than a specific psychological study,\nwe did not have as many indicators as the resilience scale typically used in the\npsychological studies, such as the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC)\nproposed by Connor and Davidson (2003). Furthermore, considering that few Chinese\nelderly people were Christians, and all of our subjects were not formally employed, the\nindicators such as \"sometimes fate or God can help\", \"you work to attain your goals\"\nand \"you prefer to take the lead in problem solving\", etc. in CD-RISC were not relevant\nin our application. Thus, we selected 7 available items in CLHLS to measure resilience\n(See Table 1). The respondents were asked whether the item statements fit them\n(denoted as 1) or not (denoted as 0). As questions concerning items 1-4 and item 7 were\nregarding feelings about self, and were required to be answered by the elderly person\nhim/herself in the survey, 13.5% of the respondents were unable to answer these\nquestions due to poor cognitive capacity. Simply excluding these cases might lead to\nsampling bias. Thus we conducted multiple imputations for the missing values of these\nfive resilience items based on the respondents' age, gender, race, education, physical\nand mental health measured by activities of daily living (ADL) and the Mini-Mental\nState Examination (MMSE) (Royston 2005). The total resilience scores ranged from 0\nto 7, with higher scores reflecting greater resilience.\n3 Gu and Zeng (2004) conducted careful evaluation and suggested that sample attrition in CLHLS did not\nyield significant bias.\nShen & Zeng: The association between resilience and survival among Chinese elderly\n108 http://www.demographic-research.org\nTable 1: Measures of resilience: statements concerning self-evaluated\nresilience\nItems Respondents were asked whether the statements fit with them Yes No\nItem 1 I don't feel the older I get, the more useless I am 4,558\nItem 4 I don't often feel lonely or isolated 9,425\nItem 5 I talk frequently to family members or friends in daily life 12,463\nItem 6 When I have problems, I can turn to my family or friends for\nhelp\nItem 7 I can make my own decisions concerning my personal affairs 11,794\nNote: (1) Percentages are presented in parentheses.\nAs shown in Table 2, age, race (Han or minority), current residence (urban or\nrural), primary occupation before age 60 (non-manual job or manual job), education\n(literate or illiterate), and marital status (currently married or not) were included as\nsocio-demographic controls. Because the follow-up mortality risk and resilience were\nboth correlated with the initial health status, we further controlled for physical and\nmental health status in 2002 (see Table 2). Physical health was measured by ADL,\nconsisting of eating, dressing, moving around the residence , using the toilet, bathing\nand continence. If the individual could complete all six activities without another's\nassistance, he/she was classified as \"ADL independent\"; if the individual needed help in\nat least one activity, he/she was classified as \"ADL dependent.\" Mental health was\nmeasured by the MMSE, which included 24 items regarding orientation, registration,\nattention, calculation, recall and language, with a total score ranging from 0 to 30. We\nused the same cutoff as the MMSE international standard to define a total score 24 as\n\"normal mental health\" and a score <24 as \"impaired mental health.\"\nDemographic Research: Volume 23, Article 5\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 109\nTable 2: Descriptive statistics of the potentially confounding variables\nConfounding variables Number Percent Confounding Variables Number Percent\nSocio-demographic characteristics Primary occupation before age 60\nNote: Variables are measured at the 2002 interview.\n3. Methods\nWe conducted item-total correlations to test the internal consistency of the resilience\nscale as well as principle component analysis to assess its factor composition. We\nestimated Cox proportional hazards regression models controlling for the potential\nconfounding variable to explore the association between resilience and survival of the\nelderly. Survival time from the 2002 interview to death (for those died) or to the 2005\ninterview (for those who survived who were considered as surveyed) was measured in\nmonths. We included the common factors of the resilience scale and the total score of\nresilience separately, to examine the impact of each factor and the overall effect of\nresilience. To better understand how the impact of resilience on mortality was\nmoderated by confounding variables, we adopted a step by step approach.\n4. Results\nThe item-total correlations ranged from 0.31 to 0.68, implying that none of the 7 items\nshould be dropped from the resilience scale (Field 2005). Principle component analysis\ngenerated 3 factors with eigenvalues 1. These 3 factors could be interpreted as\nfollows: Factor 1 contains 3 items reflecting self-approval, calmness and the social\nconnection; Factor 2 contains 3 items reflecting close relationship with family and\nfriends; Factor 3 contains 2 items reflecting optimism and control of own life (Table 3).\nShen & Zeng: The association between resilience and survival among Chinese elderly\n110 http://www.demographic-research.org\nTable 3: Factors and factor loading of the 7-item resilience scale\nItem Factors and item statements Eigenvalue Variance\nexplained (%)\nFactor\nloading\n1 I don't feel the older I get, the more useless I am -- -- 0.61\n3 I don't often feel fearful or anxious -- -- 0.77\n4 I don't often feel lonely or isolated 0.79\n5 I talk frequently to family members or friends in daily life -- -- 0.79\n6 when I have problems, I can turn to my family or friends for help -- -- 0.79\n2 I always look on the bright side of things -- -- 0.45\n7 I can make my own decisions concerning my personal affairs -- -- 0.87\nThe estimates in Tables 4 showed that, without controlling for any confounding\nfactors, the elderly who were more self-approving, calm and sociable had a 14% lower\nmortality risk (Model 1). The effect was ameliorated after adjusting for socio-\ndemographic characteristics and initial health status (Model 2 and 3), but remained\nsignificant at the P<0.01 level. Close relationship with family and friends significantly\nreduced the mortality risk by 13.5% (Model 1). After socio-demographic characteristics\nand initial health status were added to the model (Model 2 and 3), intimate relationship\nwith family and friends reduced the mortality risk by 4.0-7.0%, and both estimates were\nhighly significant. However, optimism and control of own life had no significant impact\non mortality risk with and without controlling for other covariates (Model 1-3).\nTable 4: Hazard ratios of the effects of 3 resilience factors on mortality risk\nResilience Measurements\nFactor1: self-approval, calmness and no loneliness\nFactor2 (close relationship with family and friends)\n(Containing item 5 and 6)\nFactor3 (optimism and control of own life)\n(Containing item 2 and 7)\nSocio-demographic characteristics\nInitial health status\nNotes: (1) The categories indicated in the parentheses are reference groups; (2) * p<0.1; **p<0.05; ***p<0.01.\nDemographic Research: Volume 23, Article 5\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 111\nAs shown in the Model 1 in Table 5, without controlling for any covariates, the\nelderly with a high total resilience score (6) were faced with 31.5% lower mortality\nrisk, as compared to those with a lower resilience score (<6). After adjusting for various\ncovariates including physical and mental health, higher resilience reduced mortality risk\nat old ages by 9.2% and the estimate was still highly significant (Model 3 in Table 5). It\nwas clear that a large part of the effect of resilience was moderated by socio-\ndemographic characteristics and initial health status.\nTable 5: Hazard ratios of the effects of total resilience scores on mortality risk\n(All elders)\n(All elders)\n(All elders)\n(Young-old)\n(Oldest-old)\nTotal resilience score\nNon-manual job\n(Manual job)\nADL Independent\n(Dependent)\nNotes: the same as in Table 4\nIn order to explore differences in relationship between resilience and survival\namong different age ranges, we further conducted survival analyses among the young-\nold aged 65-84 and oldest-old aged 85+ separately, while also controlling for single-\nyear-age (Model 4 and 5 in Table 5). As compared to the young-old, the positive effect\nof high resilience on mortality was somewhat smaller among the oldest-old, and it was\nhighly significant among both the young-old and oldest-old (P< 0.01).\n5. Discussion and conclusions\nThe present study was unique as it explored the association between resilience and\nlongevity at old ages based on the unique longitudinal data with a sufficiently large sub-\nsample of the oldest-old in a developing country. Survival analyses showed that the\ntotal resilience score and most factors of the resilience scale had significantly positive\nShen & Zeng: The association between resilience and survival among Chinese elderly\n112 http://www.demographic-research.org\nimpacts on longevity of the elderly, after controlling for socio-demographic\ncharacteristics and initial health status. The effect of resilience on survival among the\nyoung-old was somewhat larger than that among the oldest-old.\nAlthough to our knowledge, few published studies have explored the relationship\nbetween resilience and survival, previous studies obtained comparable findings that\nresilient elderly have better mental health and physical function in developed countries\nimportant attribute in recovery from illness and other stressful event (Hardy, Concato,\naccumulated negative conditions throughout the long process of aging, such as health\ndeterioration and the loss of loved family members, represent serious challenges. The\nelderly of better resilience may have stronger capacity and potential for dealing\nsuccessfully with constraints and adversity (Jopp and Rott 2006) to gain better health\nand longevity. The findings from the present study are in general consistent with the\nfindings from the western world, which indicates that resilience performs as a source of\nprotection for the elderly in both developing and developed countries.\nWhy was resilience positively associated with survival at old ages in China? One\npossible explanation was that resilience was positively correlated with better health, and\nbetter health lowered the mortality risk. This hypothesis was supported through our\nsurvival analyses, which showed that the effects of each resilience factor as well as the\ntotal resilience score on mortality risk shrank substantially after variables of initial\nhealth status entered the model. Prior investigations also lent support to this explanation\ndemonstrated that, even after controlling for the initial health status, the protective\neffects of the total resilience score and most of the resilience factors on mortality risk\nstill remained significant. These results indicated that resilience may have independent\neffects on mortality risk.\nThe findings presented in this paper should be interpreted with caution given the\nlimitations of our study. First, as the CLHLS was a demographic survey focusing on\ndemographic characteristics, socio-economic status, life style, health status and\nmortality risk of the elderly, we did not have as many resilience indicators as specific\npsychological surveys did. Second, we have only examined the association between\nresilience and mortality, but we were unable to explore the causal relationship and the\ndetailed mechanisms on how resilience works, due to data limitations. More detailed\ndata and advanced methods such as instrumental analysis are called for to explore the\ncausal relationship and the mechanisms in further studies.\nIn conclusion, the present study provided evidence to support the conclusion that\nbetter resilience was associated with reduced mortality risk among the young-old and\noldest-old in a developing country, China. Policies aiming to promote resilience such as\nDemographic Research: Volume 23, Article 5\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 113\norganizing group activities and encouraging individual expression (Waaktaar et al.\n2004) are likely to have long-reaching effects on longevity of the elderly.\n6.
