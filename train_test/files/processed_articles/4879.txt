First, although there are no generally accepted definitions for either\nthe business model or its building blocks, academics and practitioners agree that a business model is all about value. Second,\na business model is not the same as a strategy but it has an important role in strategy implementation. Third, sustainability\nis found to be a hot topic for business models and has been increasingly used in symbiosis with this concept.

Regarding companies, whenever a busi-\nness venture is established, it either explicitly or implicitly\nemploys a particular business model (Teece, 2010), and for a\nventure to become viable, a sound business model is required\n(Magretta, 2002). Also, business model design and innova-\ntion are of critical importance for a company's performance\nand success (Kesting & G\u00fcnzel-Jensen, 2015; Zott & Amit,\nThese claims may sound very clear and logical, but a\nquestion arises: Do we know how to build a sound and inno-\nvative business model? Put differently, what stands behind\nthis concept? Recently, many authors from various fields of\nresearch have been looking for appropriate answers (Arend,\nJohnson, Christensen, & Kagermann, 2008; Kesting &\nOsterwalder, Pigneur, & Tucci, 2005; Schaltegger, Hansen,\n2010, etc.) and it really seems that the business model is\nemerging as a new unit of analysis (Zott et al., 2011). These\nauthors offer a variety of definitions, but a general consensus\non the definition of the business model has not been reached.\nThe term has been frequently confused with other popular\nterms in the management literature such as strategy, business\nconcept, revenue model, economic model, or even business\nprocess modeling (DaSilva & Trkman, 2014; Morris,\nAs a generally accepted definition of the business model\ndoes not exist, it is not surprising that the constitute elements\nof the business model are not clearly defined too. Despite\nmany efforts (e.g., Demil & Lecocq, 2010; Mahadevan,\nstill allows for different interpretations. For that reason, aim-\ning to make the business model concept more transparent,\nsome authors have extensively explored extant literature and\nmeta-science databases (DaSilva & Trkman, 2014; Ghaziani\n& Ventresca, 2005; Kujala, Artto, Aaltonen, & Turkulainen,\n1University of Rijeka, Faculty of Tourism and Hospitality Management,\nOpatija, Croatia\nCorresponding Author:\nMarko Peric, University of Rijeka, Faculty of Tourism and Hospitality\nEmail: markop@fthm.hr\nThe Constructs of a Business Model\nRedefined: A Half-Century Journey\nMarko Peric1, Jelena Durkin1, and Vanja Vitezic1\n Keywords\nbusiness model, strategy, sustainability\n2 SAGE Open\nsimilar; the research on business models shows a high degree\nof complexity and is still an underresearched topic within the\nmanagement field.\nThis article builds on these recent works reviewing the\nstate of the art in business model research and has two main\nobjectives. First, it intends to provide a review of the most\ncommon themes used in defining business model elements.\nSecond, it discusses the relationship between the concept of\na business model, on one hand, and strategy and sustainabil-\nity, on the other. Providing new insights into the business\nmodel notion, the findings not only contribute to the devel-\nopment of management theory but could be also used by the\nmanagers and business practitioners of new entrants as well\nas incumbent firms to design business models capable of\naddressing direct competitive challenges.\nThe article proceeds as follows. The \"Literature Review\"\nsection provides a synthesized overview of the available lit-\nerature, focusing on the emergence and popularity of the\nbusiness model concept in academic literature as well as on\nbusiness model definition. The \"Method\" section describes\nthe methodology of research. The \"Results\" section details\nthe results obtained regarding business model elements and\ntwo issues usually associated with business models: strategy\nand sustainability. The article finishes with a discussion and\nsome concluding remarks.\nLiterature Review\nEmergence of the Business Model Concept in\nLiterature\nThe term business model has been present in academic litera-\nture for more than 60 years now. According to Markides\n(2013), its first use in the literature can be traced to Lang\nfor the first time in an academic paper in 1957 (in the context\nof business games for training purposes; Bellman, Clark,\nMalcolm, Craft, & Ricciardi, 1957) and in the title and\nabstract of a paper in 1960 (how college students from the\nbusiness field should be trained and how technologies should\nbe introduced to them; Jones, 1960). In the beginning, how-\never, the term was used in a very unspecific manner, reflect-\ning a simplification and simulation of reality aimed at\neducating future managers on technology (DaSilva &\nbeen associated regularly within the context of information\ntechnology and mainly used in the sense of business model-\ning (see Wirtz et al., 2016). This highlighted its operational\nand functional aspects necessary for system modeling. Still,\nuntil the 1990s, the term had been used only sporadically.\nThe advent of the Internet in the business world gave a boost\nto the usage of the term business model (see Amit & Zott,\ning business models to attract funding (Shafer et al., 2005).\nIn parallel, academics searched for more generic approaches\nin their researches, and the business model has developed\ninto an overall presentation of the company organization\ncontributing to managerial decision-making process (Wirtz\nDuring the \"new economy\" era (Morris et al., 2005), that\nis, the 1990s, we witnessed an explosion of the use of the\nterm in both nonacademic and academic literature. Only in\nthe last decade, at least five special issues were devoted to\nbusiness models (e.g., the Long Range Planning in 2010, the\nJournal of Cleaner Production in 2013, the Strategic\nEntrepreneurship Journal in 2015, and the Sustainability and\nthe Organization & Environment in 2016).\nThe rise to prominence of the term was also confirmed by\nmany authors who have extensively explored extant litera-\nture, by searching the term business model in the title,\nabstract, or full text of the articles (DaSilva & Trkman, 2014;\npeer-reviewed journals, the number of articles has grown\nfrom a single-digit number per year to more than several 100\narticles per year in the last 50 years. The rapid growth of\nreferences to the business model in the literature has cer-\ntainly contributed to the efforts to theoretically and opera-\ntionally define this concept. Despite the fact that research in\nbusiness models has matured over the years, the literature on\nbusiness models is divergent and heterogeneous.\nBusiness Model Definitions\nAnalyzing the evolution of the business model concept,\nOsterwalder et al. (2005) concluded that this evolution has\nentered its final phase, with the business model concept\nbeing applied in management and information systems (IS)\napplications. This implies that the previous four phases (defi-\nnition and classification of business models, listing business\nmodel components, describing business model components,\nand modeling business model components) have all been fin-\nished. However, just from a short glance at Table 1, which\npresents a synopsis of available perspectives regarding busi-\nness model definitions, one can see that it is still quite an\ninteresting topic for academics.\nAlso, it seems that the term is not clearly and unambigu-\nously defined. The business model has been referred to as a\nstatement, a description, a representation, an architecture, a\nconceptual tool or model, a plan, an assumption, a structural\ntemplate, a method, a framework, a pattern, and a set (see\n(2016) tried to bring some order to the various perspectives\nin the gathered definitions. Summarizing their findings, sev-\neral general approaches, perspectives, and/or categories of\nPeric et al. 3\ndefinitions could be distinguished: technological, economic,\noperational, and strategic. The technologically oriented busi-\nness model articles were very dominant during the earlier\nstages of business model evolution. It was at the turn of the\nnew millennium that many articles were published in the\ncontext of electronic business (Chen, 2003; Dai & Kauffman,\nthe business model concept became more generic, that is,\nmore universally applicable to other types of firm. The eco-\nnomic approach is concerned with the logic of profit genera-\ntion, that is, how to make money and sustain its profit stream\nTable 1.

This\narchitectural approach further involves firms' internal pro-\ncesses, resources, and their organization (Amit & Zott, 2001,\n2016). Finally, definitions also emphasize firms' strategies,\nwith particular interest on market positioning, organizational\nboundaries, stakeholder identification and networks, com-\npetitive advantage, and sustainability (Baden-Fuller &\nCasadesus-Masanell & Zhu, 2013; Cavalcante, Kesting, &\nmore strategy-oriented articles lie in efforts to understand\nbusiness by decomposing strategy into a system of interre-\nlated decisions, relationships, and organizational boundaries\nThe variety of perspectives become more comprehensible\nas one progressively moves from the technological and eco-\nnomic across the operational to the strategic levels (Morris\net al., 2005). However, the boundaries between basic theo-\nit would be very hard to draw a line between these dimen-\nsions as the majority of definitions encompass at least two or\nthree categories. In recent articles, authors mostly refer to the\nfundamental works and aspects of multiple basic perspec-\ntives (e.g., Johnson et al., 2008; Kesting & G\u00fcnzel-Jensen,\nThese broad definitions and approaches are sometimes\ndetailed through the identification of the components of the\nbusiness model. Indeed, after the definition phase, listing and\ndescribing business model elements (or components or\nunique building blocks or constitute attributes) are the next\nlogical steps in the evolution of the business model concept\n(Osterwalder et al., 2005). In fact, definitions of a business\nmodel quite often focus on structural aspects regarding its\nRegarding the content-related structural aspects of a busi-\nness model, extant literature indicates a separate develop-\nment and expansion of business model elements within these\ntwo distinctive phases of listing and describing. For instance,\nMorris et al. (2005) analyzed key words in definitions and\nfound 24 different items that are mentioned as possible ele-\nments, with 15 receiving multiple mentions. At the same\nfound more than 40 different items each. Recently, academ-\nics have been continually trying to gather and analyze the\nup-to-date state of the research (Nenonen & Storbacka, 2010;\nonly a few) and proposing their own theoretical conceptual-\nizations on what constitutes a business model (see Table 2).\nThe review in Table 2 indicates that most authors distin-\nguish between first- and second-order themes within the\nstructure of a business model. Many elements overlap and/or\nhave very similar names. Also, they have been alternately\nclassified into both categories. Hence, there are numerous\ndifferences in the definitions of elements implying the need\nfor clearer distinction.\nMethod\nIn this article, a comprehensive review and critical analysis\nof previous research on business models and their elements\nwere conducted in February and March 2016 as a part of the\nresearch design. In conducting the analysis, a multistep pro-\ncess was used.\nFor the analysis to be scientifically traceable, this study\nsearched for articles that contain the term business model in\nthe title or keywords published in leading academic and\npractitioner-oriented management journals (Academy of\nManagement Journal [AMJ], Academy of Management\nReview [AMR], Academy of Management Perspectives\n[AMP], Administrative Science Quarterly [ASQ], Journal of\nManagement [JOM], Journal of Management Studies [JMS],\nManagement Science [MS], MIS Quarterly, Organization\nScience [OS], Strategic Management Journal [SMJ],\nCalifornia Management Review [CMR], Harvard Business\nReview [HBR], and MIT Sloan Management Review [MSM]).\nThis search revealed 277 articles on business models from\nthe early publishing dates to December 2015, of which only\n21 had been published in academic journals, while 256 had\nappeared in practitioner-oriented journals (i.e., CMR, HBR,\nand MSM).\nThe research was further extended to the ABI/INFORM\ndatabase. Examining databases was confirmed as an appro-\npriate method for exploring extant literature on business\nmodels (DaSilva & Trkman, 2014; Ghaziani & Ventresca,\net al., 2011, etc.) while international coverage makes the\nABI/INFORM database one of the most complete sources on\nbusiness studies. The search was focused on academic arti-\ncles containing the term business model in the title or abstract,\npublished in peer-reviewed scholarly journals in the English\n4,028 articles were obtained. As 16 of the newly found arti-\ncles were already present in the initial sample of 277 articles,\nour overall sample contained 4,289 articles.\nAs an initial cursory analysis of these 4,289 publications\nrevealed that many of the selected publications would not be\nuseful for further analysis, three additional criteria were\nintroduced to identify articles relevant for this study: (a) an\narticle must deal with the business model concept in a non-\ntrivial and nonmarginal way, (b) an article also must refer to\nthe business model as a concept related to business firms (as\nPeric et al. 5\nopposed to economic cycles or models, for example), and\n(c) an article must directly refer to the constitute elements or\ncomponents of a business model. As a result, 102 articles fit\nthe suggested criteria. Through careful reading of these\npublications, a few additional publications on business\nmodels were found that appeared relevant for this review,\nprimarily books and working papers. The final sample,\ntherefore, contained 108 publications.\nTable 2.

Special attention\nwas devoted to searching for business model elements that\nare related to strategy and sustainability to analyze the rela-\ntionship between business models, on one hand, and strategy\nand sustainability, on the other.\nResults\nDomains Addressed in a Business Model\nelements or unique building blocks are found. A brief review\nof these adjacent literatures is presented in Table 3. It seems\nthat some of the elements are seen time and time again in the\ndefinitions. For instance, four elements (value proposition,\ncustomer, product, and resources) are mentioned in more\nmentioned at least 4 times. In addition, 16 elements are men-\nmentioned only once.\nRegardless of the large number of perspectives provided\nwhen business model elements are concerned, something\nconsistently recognized was that definitions often included\nthose elements that comprise the concept of value. More pre-\ncisely, value proposition is convincingly the most often men-\ntioned element of a business model (in one third of analyzed\npublications). However, many other elements also overlap\neach other while referring to value proposition. For instance,\nvalue, value offering, (customer) value proposition, or even\nproduct or service all refer to value that is first proposed and\nthen delivered to a customer. In other words, value proposi-\ntion is typically concerned with the product and service\noffering, that is, the value embedded in the offerings of the\nResource-based view (RBV) of the firm (e.g., see Amit &\nSepp\u00e4nen, 2009) also proved to be relevant for the business\nmodel concept. Besides the term resources (found in one\nfifth of publications), elements such as key resources, strate-\ngic resources, assets, competencies, information, or even\ntechnology or brand all indicate the tangible or intangible\nsubstance of a firm and its business model. On the contrary,\nMorris et al. (2005) argued that activity sets support each\nelement of a business model. Furthermore, Zott et al. (2011)\nfound that the received literature on business models mostly\nsupports an activity system perspective, that is, a set of inter-\ndependent organizational activities centered on a focal firm.\nIndeed, this research found that managerial, organizational,\nmanufacturing, marketing, and especially networking pro-\ncesses are frequently mentioned within the business model\nframework. As a link connecting a firm's infrastructure and\ncustomers, these activities are required to create and deliver\nthe value proposition to the targeted customer.\nThe last domain addressed is about considering how the\ncompany creates value for itself. Elements such as revenue\nmodel or revenue stream, value capture, cost, price, and\nprofit formula (all these elements are mentioned at least 5\ntimes in publications) reveal the financial aspect of a busi-\nness model. When considered in relation to other domains\nand elements, a business model is a specific combination of\nresources and transactions which generate value for both\ncustomers and the organization.\nBusiness Model Versus Strategy\nTransformation of resources into valuable products and ser-\nvices, and delivery of those to customers, occurs in a specific\nstrategic context. The previous review indicated that the\nstrategy literature stream has an essential influence on busi-\nness model development and that strategic elements are\nmentioned very often in the context of business models.\nStrategy or some other elements related to strategy like mis-\nsion, competitors, organization, or structure have often been\nincorporated in definitions (see again Casadesus-Masanell &\n2005). This is also reflected in the various approaches used\nwhen defining the main elements of a business model (see\nMany authors argue that strategy is essential when con-\nsidering elements of a business model. For instance, Hamel\n(2000) considered the core strategy as a central (first-order)\nelement of a business model. Also, a group of authors refer to\ncompetitive strategy (Chesbrough, 2007; Chesbrough &\nThey all agree it must delineate how the firm will gain and\nhold advantage over rivals. Richardson (2008) mostly agreed\nbut, from his point of view, basic strategy to win customers\nand gain competitive advantage is a second-order theme and\nbelongs to value proposition. Shafer et al. (2005) argued that\nstrategy is all about making choices (regarding customers,\nvalue proposition, pricing, competitors, branding, etc.), and\nstrategic choices are therefore considered as a separate ele-\nment of a business model. Voelpel et al. (2004) and Tikkanen\net al. (2005) see strategy as a second-order theme. According\nto Voelpel et al. (2004), strategy, vision, mission, and objec-\ntives are a part of a value network (re)configuration which\nhas to provide value for customers. Tikkanen et al. (2005)\nexplained that the business model of the firm is based on how\nthe material aspects of the business model interact with man-\nagerial belief systems. Within material aspects, they find\nstrategic intent (long-term organizational commitment), the\nstrategy process managed by a firm's managers, and the con-\ntent of strategy as part of the material aspects of a business\nmodel.\nOn the contrary, there are authors who do not explicitly\nembed the term strategy within the business model frame-\nwork. For some of them, Onetti et al. (2012) for instance, the\nPeric et al. 7\nTable 3.

(2012) deliberately excluded concepts such as\nmission and strategy (together with the components of value\nproposition, competition, differentiation, customer target\nmarket, and pricing) from the defining elements of the busi-\nness model.\nAccording to Wirtz et al. (2016), such a lack of consensus\nwith regard to the area of strategy as a building block of busi-\nness model could be explained by the fact that some authors\nusually integrate the implications of corporate strategy\nthrough a strategy model within the business model. Indeed,\nthe literature points to the importance of business models for\na firm's strategy and definitions of a business model at a stra-\ntegic level. However, a business model and a strategy are not\nthe same thing, and the two should not be confused. In fact,\nliterature tries to portray the business model as an indepen-\ndent concept but related to a number of other established\nmanagerial concepts such as strategy, organizational struc-\nture, or business planning (e.g., Casadesus-Masanell &\nIn this respect, much has been discussed about differenti-\nating between business models and strategy (Casadesus-\nRosenbloom (2002), the business model is \"more of a proto-\nstrategy, an initial hypothesis for how to deliver value to the\ncustomer . . .\" (p. 550). It describes the organization's activi-\nties and how to create and deliver value to the customer but\ndoes not consider competition as a critical dimension of per-\nformance (Magretta, 2002). Hence, the business model is\nfocused on value proposition and emphasizes the role of the\ncustomer (Zott et al., 2011). On the contrary, the strategy is\nconcerned more with value capturing and its sustainability\nthan with value creation (Chesbrough & Rosenbloom, 2002;\nM\u00e4kinen & Sepp\u00e4nen, 2007). This means strategy gives\nmeaning and direction on how the business model is utilized\n8 SAGE Open\ndepending on contingencies that might occur in a competi-\ntive environment (Casadesus-Masanell & Ricart, 2010;\nTikkanen et al., 2005), and in such a way, strategy stresses\nthe need for positioning (Magretta, 2002). Hence, strategy is\nall about making choices while a business model reflects the\nstrategic choices that have been made and their operating\nimplications (Shafer et al., 2005). However, Casadesus-\nMasanell and Ricart (2010) argued that strategy is not just\nthe mere selection of a business model (making some choices\nand suffering the consequences of these choices) because\nevery organization has some business model, but not every\norganization has a strategy. Some academics have even ques-\ntioned whether it would be possible to have more than one\nbusiness model at the same time (Arend, 2013; Casadesus-\nor to alter business models within one strategy (DaSilva &\nBusiness Models and Sustainability\nAnother theme that is becoming more and more present\nwithin the context of business models is sustainability.\nAlthough sustainability is almost always seen in terms of\nthree dimensions that must be in harmony, namely, social,\neconomic, and environmental (Kates, Parris, & Leiserowitz,\nmodels, the harmony of these dimensions was not always the\ncase. At first, sustainability was mentioned only from an eco-\nnomic perspective. Besides creating and delivering value,\nthe core of a business model was to create a sustainable com-\npetitive advantage in defined markets (Morris et al., 2005)\nand to generate profitable and sustainable revenue streams\nthat ensure the satisfaction of relevant stakeholders within a\nVoelpel et al., 2005). The focus was on how a firm can sus-\ntain itself, that is, how to be self-sustainable on the basis of\nthe income it generates (DaSilva & Trkman, 2014; Shafer\nelements of a business model (e.g., revenue model, revenue\nstream, value capture, profit formula) reflect this approach.\nObjectives and interests of the environment and community,\nas external stakeholders, were less relevant. For instance,\nenvironment is considered as an element of business model\nonly twice (see Hoque, 2002; Nair, Paulose, Palacios, &\nTafur, 2013) and has the meaning of a turbulent and competi-\ntive business setting that impacts firms' survival.\nMeanwhile, the overall competitive landscape has\nchanged in favor of the environment and wider community.\nability concepts (all three dimensions) should shape the driv-\ning force of the firm and its decision making. They coined\nthe term sustainability business model (SBM)--a model\nwhere a firm treats sustainability as a business strategy in\nitself, rather than as an add-on. For firms, sustainability is not\nonly the right thing to do but also the smart thing to do\n(Stubbs & Cocklin, 2008) because becoming environment-\nfriendly lowers costs, creates new businesses, and generates\nadditional revenues from better products (Nidumolu,\nPrahalad, & Rangaswami, 2009). In this way, sustainable\norganizations need profits to exist (i.e., survive) and to\nachieve sustainable outcomes but they do not just exist to\nThe concept of a SBM was well accepted by other aca-\ndemics and practitioners under slightly changed names--\nsustainable business model or business model for\nsustainability (BMfS; Abdelkafi & T\u00e4uscher, 2016; Bocken,\nunderstandings agree on the integration of a triple bottom\nline approach and consider a wide range of stakeholder inter-\nests. SBM is based on the principles of balancing the busi-\nness from a number of perspectives, and it is a kind of holistic\nand hybrid model (Jabloski, 2016). It generates therefore\nshared value creation for all stakeholders--it captures eco-\nnomic value for itself, while distributing value beyond its\norganizational boundaries by maintaining or regenerating\nnatural, social, and economic capital (Bocken et al., 2015;\nAccordingly, designing sustainability-oriented business\nmodels requires a long-term focus at both the organizational\nand socioeconomic levels (Stubbs & Cocklin, 2008) and the\nadoption of a systemic approach that seeks to integrate con-\nsiderations of the three dimensions of sustainability (Bocken\net al., 2015). Indeed, environment and community are\nacknowledged as true stakeholders. When it comes to attrib-\nuting to natural or ecological capital, Abdelkafi and T\u00e4uscher\n(2016) discussed environmental value proposition, which\nrepresents not the actual impact but the intended impact of a\nbusiness model on the environment, and how to integrate it\ninto a BMfS. When it comes to the community perspective,\nStubbs and Cocklin (2008) even mentioned community as a\nsubelement of a business model (together with customers,\nemployees, suppliers, and management). In addition, some\nauthors used the business model framework to explain how\nto create social businesses able to enhance social welfare\n(e.g., Seelos & Mair, 2005; Yunus, Moingeon, & Lehmann-\nbusiness model defines the desired social profits through a\ncomprehensive ecosystem view. This will result in a social\nprofit equation (one constitute element of a social business\nmodel) while an economic profit equation (another element)\ntargets only full recovery of cost and of capital, and not\nfinancial profit maximization. Despite the growing impor-\ntance of these issues (i.e., environment, environmental value\nproposition, community, and social profit equation) in\nPeric et al. 9\ncontemporary business, this research showed that they are\nrarely mentioned as elements of a business model. An expla-\nnation for this can be found in the core definition of the\nSBM--sustainability (involving also environment and soci-\nety) is treated as a business strategy in itself and there is no\nneed for it to be asserted as separate elements.\nHence, the quest for sustainability forces companies to\nchange the way they think about products, technologies, pro-\ncesses, and business models. Smart organizations now treat\nsustainability as innovation's new frontier (Nidumolu et al.,\n2009). Designing SBMs explicitly depicts how value is cre-\nated and appropriated by all involved. Thus, the creation and\nfurther development of businesses toward sustainability is\nchallenged by the cocreation of societal and economic profits\n(Boons & L\u00fcdeke-Freund, 2013), leaving plenty of space for\nfurther research.\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nThis overview has revealed that many practitioners and\nscholars treat the business model as a promising concept. On\nthe contrary, the validity of the business model concept and\nits long-term implications has been questioned over time.\nThis apparently popular concept receives intense criticism,\nwhich is quite paradoxical (Klang et al., 2014). It was argued\nthat the business model is defined vaguely, that there is con-\nfusion in terminology, and that the business model, as an\napproach to management, becomes an invitation for faulty\nZott et al., 2011). Several conclusions, which are to a large\nextent coherent with these inferences, can be drawn from this\noverview.\nFirst, although more than half a century has passed since\nthe first appearance of the term business model in the litera-\nture, this overview shows that its popularity is a relatively\nyoung phenomenon (see also Wirtz et al., 2016; Zott et al.,\n2011). The business model concept began to be increasingly\nused only during the 1990s, in parallel with the development\nand intensive evolution of e-commerce. Since then, research\nin business models has matured over the years, and numer-\nous definitions of business model and elements have\nappeared. The e-business and technology stream dominated\nthe early stage of business model evolution, after which time\na more generic approach emerged, focused on the strategic\nand operational dimensions of a firm and seeking to define\nthe concept as a more generalized representation of a firm.\nThe economic stream, emphasizing the logic of profit gen-\neration, is a constant throughout the whole period. This,\ntherefore, is in line with some of the previous arguments\non business models is fragmented and dispersed in several\nstreams with very loose boundaries between each other.\nThe heterogeneous nature of the extant literature gives\nsupport to other two conclusions--there are no generally\naccepted definitions for either the business model or its\nbuilding blocks. According to Shafer et al. (2005), the lack-\ning consensus on business model definition may be in part\nattributed to interdisciplinary scholarly perspectives (e.g.,\ntechnology, IS, strategy, organizational theory, etc.). Despite\nthe broadness and differences in definitions over the last two\nor three decades, one thing the academics and practitioners\nagree upon is that, when business models are concerned, it is\nSantos, Spector, & Van der Heyden, 2009; Shafer et al.,\ncommon theme in the authors'views is that a business model\nis a conceptual tool and an abstract representation of a com-\npany's core logic that describes how it creates, delivers, and\ncaptures value. To make this abstraction simpler, a business\nmodel is often expounded through the identification of its\nelements. The most frequently cited are a firm's value propo-\nsition, customers, products (and services), resources, value\ncreation, value capture, revenues, technology, processes, and\npartners. Still, there is no congruency--different items are\nused for similar concepts and their meanings sometimes\noverlap. What product or service is to one author, value prop-\nosition is to another. Within a number of elements, it looks\nlike these elements are crucial when business models are\nconcerned, and that value (i.e., a firm's value proposition,\nvalue creation, and value capture), as claimed by Johnson\ncore of a business model.\nAlthough consensus among the authors regarding the\ndimensions of value as components of a business model\nexists to some extent, there is little or no agreement with\nregard to the area of strategy. This review implies that there\nis both a relationship and distinction between business mod-\nels and strategy. A strong relationship between business\nmodels and strategy is manifested in two ways: Business\nmodels are often defined from a strategic point of view while\nstrategic issues are pointed out as important business model\nelements. Although there is a strong relationship between the\ntwo, the next conclusion is that a business model and a strat-\negy are not the same thing. The majority of the extant litera-\nture portrays the business model as an independent concept\n(Casadesus-Masanell & Ricart, 2010; DaSilva & Trkman,\ntinction should be made between strategy and business\nmodel. When a business venture is concerned, strategy can\nbe understood more as a kind of guide (Wirtz et al., 2016).\nOn the contrary, business models include a number of strat-\negy elements but build more on the creation of value for cus-\ntomers, and from a strategic view, the business model can be\na source of competitive advantage (Teece, 2010; Zott et al.,\n2011). This implies that a business model is typically devel-\noped from a more narrow perspective than a strategy (see\nWikstr\u00f6m et al., 2010). It seeks to integrate sustainable value\ncreation with capturing and appropriation while emphasizing\nthe role of the customer which appears to be less pronounced\nelsewhere in the strategy literature. In Addition, an organiza-\ntion's business model framework is usually approached from\na short-term perspective as the reflection of its realized strat-\negy (see also Casadesus-Masanell & Ricart, 2010; Dahan,\nDoh, Oetzel, & Yaziji, 2010), providing a link between strat-\negy and operations and between strategy formulation and\nimplementation. From this point of view, this conclusion is\nin line with previous findings (e.g., M\u00e4kinen & Sepp\u00e4nen,\nfacilitate operations, that is, the implementation of selected\nstrategy. Consequently, strategy reflects the long-term per-\nspective, that is, what a company aims to become, while a\nbusiness model is a description of a state, that is, what a com-\npany really is at a given time (Dahan et al., 2010; DaSilva &\nTrkman, 2014). For sure, business model and strategy are\nmore complements than substitutes.\nMoreover, sustainability is found to be a hot topic for\nbusiness models. Besides economic sustainability (DaSilva\nincreased interest in research is devoted to the social and\nenvironmental dimensions of sustainability. As a result, a\nnew stream of literature on sustainable business models has\nAccording to this approach, value is distributed to all stake-\nholders, including those within a firm as well as those beyond\nthe firm's organizational boundaries.\nTo summarize, this article reviewed the relevant literature\non business models to try gain a better understanding of the\nbusiness model concept and its content-related structural\naspects. It looks like 20 years of intensive development were\nnot enough for academics to agree on what a business model\nis and what its constitute elements are. Still, progress is evi-\ndent in other fields. Particular attention was therefore dedi-\ncated to the structural aspects of a business model and\ninterrelationship of business models, on one hand, and strat-\negy and sustainability, on the other. This article stipulates\nthat the business model has an important role in the imple-\nmentation of a firm's strategy. Although its elements are\nfocused on value proposed to customers, the business model\nhas increasingly been used in symbiosis with the sustainabil-\nity concept.\nThe contribution of this article is twofold. From a concep-\ntual viewpoint, more clarity is given to the definition of a\nbusiness model as an independent concept which has general\nvalidity. This overview would therefore facilitate research\ninto the theoretical foundations of the business model. From\na practical viewpoint, this overview may be particularly\nhelpful to practitioners whose firms are seeking how to deal\nwith complex market challenges and gain competitive advan-\ntage. Without a doubt, the design and management of busi-\nness models, especially within the sustainability context,\nleaves gaps for further research. Cocreation of environmen-\ntal, societal, and economic profits within and beyond the\nboundaries of a business model is surely a challenge for both\npractitioners and academics. In this regard, more work\nregarding business model terminology may certainly provide\ninsights into making business models more efficient.\nDespite the attempts to rigorously and objectively analyze\nthe selected literature on business models, this article comes\nwith several limitations. Besides strategy and sustainability,\nbusiness models have other, emerging common themes that\nshould be looked into. For instance, future overviews on busi-\nness models should seek to overcome this limitation by focus-\ning on business model types (see Kujala et al., 2010; McGrath,\nimpact of adopted business models on firm performance\net al., 2011). The research scope of future studies should also\nfocus on particular industries to build the theory and compare\nthe overall conclusions. More empirical findings (i.e., case stud-\nies) will help both practitioners and academics to put all the\npieces together and design competitive business models.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This\nwork was supported by the Croatian Science Foundation [grant\nReferences\nAbdelkafi, N., Makhotin, S., & Posselt, T.
