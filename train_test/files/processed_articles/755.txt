Thomas Juster, Principal Investigator.\nThe articles were first presented as papers at the \"Minority Perspectives in the Health\nand Retirement Study Workshop,\" held May 26-27, 1995 at the Institute for Social\nResearch, the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. The study is funded by a National\nInstitute of Aging Cooperative Agreement. Richard M.

Thomas Juster, PhD2\nThe purpose of the Minority Perspectives in the\nHealth and Retirement Study Workshop was to ex-\nplore issues related to the health and related retire-\nment experiences of ethnic and racial minorities (Af-\nrican Americans and Hispanic Americans). The goals\nwere to begin the empirical examination of the\nHealth and Retirement Study (HRS) data to stimulate\nfurther thinking and empirical research as this his-\ntoric study of health and retirement processes con-\ntinues over the next decade. This landmark prospec-\ntive longitudinal panel study is one of the largest and\n1As the general editors of this series of symposia, we would like to\nacknowledge that our task was made considerably easier by the contribu-\ntions of each of the section action .editors, Drs. Charlie Brown, Melissa\nHardy, and Robert Wallace. Our most difficult tasks were in conceiving of,\nand assisting in, the execution of the Minority Perspectives in the Health and\nRetirement Study Workshop. The Workshop would not have been possible\nwithout the financial and moral support of Dr. Richard Suzman of the\nNational Institute on Aging, and the Health and Retirement Study project\nstaff. We are extremely appreciative of the work of Ms. Liza Chase, Ms. Kelly\nConlin, Ms. Dale Jerome, and Ms. Sally Oswald, whose hard work made the\nWorkshop a reality. We would also like to give a special thanks to Ms. Dale\nJerome, whose communications with the action editors and authors contrib-\nuted to making the process proceed smoothly and efficiently.\nFinally, we would like to acknowledge and thank Dr. Rose C. Gibson,\nEditor-in-Chief of The Gerontologist, who provided direct support by work-\ning on and participating in the Workshop. Most importantly, she conceived\nof the idea of submitting a set of papers from the Workshop to the peer\nreview process. Ten excellent papers have emerged out of this process.\ninstitute for Social Research, University of Michigan. Address correspon-\ndence to James S.

While all older Americans are vulnerable to\nharsh and unequal treatment, certain demographic\nsubgroups, ethnic and racial minorities, and women\nprovide stark examples of the types of problems faced\nby all elderly. Members of the groups (women, mi-\nnorities, immigrants, etc.) that are especially vulnera-\nble will show the effects first, but ultimately, age-\nrelated biases and discrimination will affect all older\nindividuals.\nOne of the more remarkable facts of the 20th\ncentury has been the change in the quality of mate-\nrial life for older Americans. Social Security, Medi-\ncare, Medicaid, the Older Americans' Act, and anti-\nage discrimination legislation have produced major\nimprovements in the economic and social status of\nthe current generation of older Americans. The pov-\nerty rate among older Americans has been reduced\nby over 300%, and it is clear that the type of financial\nsecurity enjoyed by elders today is far greater than\nthat of their parents and grandparents. Thus, the\nmaterial, psychological, and social conditions of life\nfor older Americans has improved dramatically.\nThe unparalleled increase in the standard of living\nfor older Americans has not been enjoyed equally by\nall. Significant inequalities in the material and non-\nmaterial resources in the lives of millions of older\nAmericans persist, and it is even growing among\nsome major demographic groups, especially ethnic\nand racial minorities and women (Jackson, 1996).\nMany ethnic and racial minority group elderly con-\ntinue to lag behind whites in social and economic\nstatus (Chen, 1994). Indicators of income, education,\nand health status document the deprived position of\nthese groups relative to whites. For example, recent\nreports (e.g., Bennett, 1992) on the circumstances of\nblacks across the entire life course suggest that new\ncohorts of elderly minorities will continue to experi-\nence relative disadvantage. While more than a third\nof the black elderly continue to live below the pov-\nerty level, we know that many black elderly people\nare better fed, better housed, and in better health\nthan in earlier periods of time (Jackson, 1996). Most\nof this improvement is because of the introduction of\ngovernment assistance programs that provide the\nprime support for black Americans and many Latino\nand American Indians in older age. A larger propor-\ntion of ethnic minorities is heavily dependent upon\nthese government programs for subsistence in older\nage due to histories of poor occupational opportuni-\nties and lack of wealth and private retirement funds.\nRecent cutbacks of federal programs, a change in\nthe economy favoring job creation in highly special-\nized, technologically sophisticated, and education-\nally intensive sectors of the economy, global eco-\nnomic competitiveness, and simultaneous growth in\nlow-paying service positions provide few opportuni-\nties for many of today's minority young adult and\nmiddle-aged cohorts. It is foreseeable that without\nsignificant policy interventions, future cohorts of\nolder blacks and other racial and ethnic minorities of\ncolor will not be as well off as their white counter-\nparts, and it is unlikely that they will maintain the\nmaterial living standards of current minority elders\nContinuing research points to the negative differ-\nentials in health status and health services among\nwhites and groups of color (Jackson & Perry, 1989;\nJackson, Antonucci, & Gibson, 1990; Wykle & Kaskel,\n1994). At this point, the exact differences in the struc-\nture of health, the processes of health, and the influ-\nences of service use and health problems experi-\nenced among ethnic minority elders remains unclear\never, is that ethnic and racial minorities suffer poorer\nhealth status at each point of the life course and are\nmore likely than majority group elders to develop\ndebilitating chronic health conditions and suffer dis-\nabilities in older ages (Wykle & Kaskel, 1994).\nVery little empirical research had been devoted to\nthe study of work and retirement in ethnic and racial\nSome earlier work speculated that the entire retire-\nment process, viewed within a life-span context, may\nbe very different for blacks and other discriminated\nagainst groups (Jackson & Gibson, 1985). Many racial\nminorities, because of long histories of dead-end\njobs with poor benefits, have few retirement support\nopportunities in the traditional sense; inadequate\nincome, poor housing, and uncertain futures greet\nthese groups at retirement age (Chen, 1994). Faced\nwith limited retirement resources, many ethnic mi-\nnorities may out of necessity continue working past\ncustomary retirement ages, even when they are in\npoor health (Gibson & Burns, 1991). In fact, some\nresearch indicates that these individuals are physi-\ncally, psychologically, and socially worse off than\ntheir retired counterparts (Jackson, 1996; Gibson,\n1991a). Even the relatively poor but stable govern-\nment retirement benefits many groups receive may\nbe better than sporadic and poor jobs in the regular\nNew national data collection efforts, like the\nHealth and Retirement Study, are improving the\nquality and quantity of available data on the aging\nexperience of African American and other racial and\nethnic minority Americans. While we can always ask\nfor more and better data, especially data based upon\nlongitudinal and cross-sequential designs (Jackson,\n1996), the improvement in a few short years has been\nimpressive. Similarly, the approach to research on\nminority elderly has also shown greater recognition\nof the heterogeneity among ethnic minority elders\n(J. J. Jackson, 1985). Research like the HRS is now\nmore focused on the role of culture, socioeconomic\nstatus, and gender as important markers of potential\nprocess differences, especially health and retire-\nment, within and among aging groups of color. Re-\ncent research studies like the HRS are reversing his-\ntorical trends of poor data quantity and quality, and\ngeneralizable findings are beginning to emerge con-\ncerning health, work, and retirement for elderly\ngroups of color.\nThe HRS is not perfect. Adequate samples of non-\nblack and non-Mexican American ethnic and racial\ngroups are not available in the study. Greater empha-\nsis is needed in the future on social, psychological,\nand cultural factors, which play important mediating\nroles in health and retirement outcomes among\ngroups of color (Jackson, Antonucci, & Gibson,\n1995). Nevertheless, we believe that the articles in\nthis issue of The Gerontologist demonstrate the high\nquality of empirical social science research that is\npossible when quality data are available on health\nand retirement processes among nationally repre-\nsentative samples of ethnic and racial minorities. We\nare sure that you will agree.\nReferences\nAllen, K. R., & Chin-Sang, V. (1990). A lifetime of work: The context and\nmeanings of leisure for aging black women.
