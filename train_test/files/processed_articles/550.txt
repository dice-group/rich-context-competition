Gonnissen et al.20 reported that,\nin a sample of 13 adults who were experimentally induced into\neither phase advanced or phase delayed circadian misalign-\nment, eating and sleeping at unusual times of day resulted in a\ndisturbed glucose and insulin metabolism. A study by Spaeth\net al.,21 in a large sample of adults, provides direct experimental\nevidence that delaying bedtimes for 5 nights (and thereby re-\nducing sleep duration) results in significant weight gain within\na single week. Moreover, in a sample of 52 adults, Baron et al.22\nshowed that individuals with later bedtimes tended to consume\nObjectives: The aim of the current study was to examine the longitudinal relationship between bedtimes and body mass index (BMI) from\nadolescence to adulthood in a nationally representative sample.\nDesign: Three waves of data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health were used to assess the bedtimes and BMI of 3,342\nadolescents between 1994 and 2009.

Com-\npared to those with earlier bedtimes, individuals with later bed-\ntimes ate fewer fruits and vegetables and consumed an average\nof 248 more calories, most of which were consumed at dinner\nor after 20:00. Fleig and Randler23 found that later sleep timing\nin adolescents on non-school days was associated with greater\n\"fast food\" consumption. In a large sample of Australian ado-\nlescents, those with late bedtimes were 1.47 times more likely\nto be overweight or obese than those with early bedtimes and\nmore than twice as likely to be obese.24 Moreover, later bed-\ntimes are associated with more screen time,25 which is associ-\nated with obesity26 and increased daytime sleepiness, which is\nassociated with decreased physical activity. 27 The cross-sec-\ntional and experimental data indicate that bedtime is important\nto consider when identifying risks for obesity.\nRegular insufficient sleep and excessive daytime sleepi-\nness is another serious epidemic among adolescents. In several\nstudies with large samples of adolescents, researchers reported\nthat between 45% and 80% of adolescents experience insuf-\nAlthough the evidence is inconsistent, there is growing lit-\nerature indicating a relationship between risk for obesity and\nboth insufficient sleep in adults and children and too much\nsleep in adults. In a meta-analysis, Cappuccio et al.29 con-\ncluded that cross-sectional studies from around the world show\na consistent increased risk of obesity amongst children who\nare sleep deprived, and also a 60% to 80% increase in the odds\nof being sleep deprived for obese children. Other researchers\nhave found that the relationship between sleep and risk for obe-\nsity in adults holds to a curvilinear relationship, where both too\nmuch sleep and too little sleep is associated with adverse im-\npacts on metabolic health.30,31 Thus, sleep is a plausible partial\nmediator of the association between bedtime and weight gain.32\nTo the best of our knowledge, there have been no longitu-\ndinal observational studies examining the relationship between\nbedtime and change in body mass index (BMI). We endeavored\nto explore whether later bedtimes would be associated with an\nincrease in BMI from adolescence to adulthood and whether\nthe relationship would be partially mediated by sleep duration,\nfast-food consumption, screen time, and exercise frequency in\na longitudinal nationally representative data set.\nMETHODS\nSample\nThe National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add\nHealth) is a longitudinal study in the United States that con-\ntains data on the health and behavior of adolescents who were\nin grades 7 to 12 in the first two waves of the study and 18 to\n32 years of age in the third and fourth waves. Surveys were\nadministered at home and in school to adolescents and their\nwere three follow-up interviews: wave II in April-August 1996,\nfrom participants in waves II through IV of data collection. A\nstratified random sampling of US high schools was included\n(79% of targeted schools agreed to participate). The collection\nof data followed informed consent procedures approved by the\ninstitutional review board at the University of North Carolina,\nChapel Hill. The clustered sampling design was school based.\nSeveral eligible high schools were selected and stratified by\nregion, urbanicity, school type, ethnic mix, and size, which\nresulted in a final sample of 132 discrete schools. The current\nanalysis used the public-use data from the Add Health dataset.\nThe public-use dataset consists of one half of the core sample\nthat completed an in-home interview and includes an overs-\nample of African-American adolescents with a parent with a\ncollege degree.\nMeasures\nSleep/circadian variables were determined via self-report\nmeasures at all three waves. In wave II, all participants were\nin school. Therefore, workday bedtime in wave II was defined\nby response to the question \"During the school year, what time\ndo you usually go to bed on week nights?\" In waves III and\nIV, workday bedtime was defined by response to the question\n\"On days when you go to work, school, or similar activities,\nwhat time do you usually go to bed?\" Workday bedtime was a\ncontinuous variable; standard clock times were converted into\nvariables representing the number of hours and minutes from\nnoon, such that larger numbers indicate later bedtimes. For ex-\nSleep duration was investigated as a potential partial medi-\nator. Rise times were not available at wave II; therefore, wave\nII workday estimated total sleep time (TST) was defined by\nresponse to the question \"How many hours of sleep do you\nusually get?\" In waves III and IV workday TST was calculated\nbased on the workday bedtime and rise time reported at each\nwave. Workday TST was a continuous variable, formatted in\nhours with additional minutes as fractions of hours.\nInvestigators measured height and weight at each wave,\nfrom which BMI was calculated. BMI in adolescents and\nchildren is typically converted to a z-score because body fat\npercentage changes as a child develops and in growing chil-\ndren BMI also varies by sex. Therefore, BMI in children and\nadolescents is not age and sex adjusted and thereby does not\naccurately reflect norms unless converted to a z-score. How-\never, in the current study, we are interested in change in an\nindividuals' BMI over time, and the age-adjusted norms are\nless relevant. Moreover, in the current study age and sex have\nbeen included as covariates to account for age-related differ-\nences in BMI. Some previous studies that examined individual\nchanges in BMI across this developmental period also did not\nFast-food consumption, television viewing, and exercise were\nincluded as potential partial mediators. Fast-food consumption\nis a continuous variable, defined by the number of times the ad-\nolescent endorsed having consumed fast food in the past week.\nFast-food consumption was collected at all three waves. Screen\ntime per week is a continuous variable collected at each wave of\ndata collection and was determined by response to the question\n\"How many hours a week do you watch television?\" Exercise\nfrequency at wave II is a continuous variable and was defined\nby response to the question \"During the past week, how many\ntimes did you exercise, such as jogging, walking, doing ka-\nrate, jumping rope, doing gymnastics or dancing?\" Questions\nassessing exercise frequency were inconsistent across waves,\nposing a methodological challenge in assessing exercise fre-\nquency across waves. Therefore, exercise frequency was based\nonly on data from wave II in the current study.\nDemographic characteristics controlled for included age\n(continuous; collected at all three waves), race/ethnicity (Af-\nrican American, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, Native\nAmerican, or white), and welfare status (one parent receiving\npublic assistance or no parent receiving public assistance).\nA proxy for puberty was obtained via self-reported men-\narche for girls and levels of voice change for boys. Previous\nresearch has shown that voice change is a good indicator of pu-\nberty for boys.36\u00ad38 For voice change, boys were asked, \"Is your\nvoice lower now than it was when you were in grade school?\"\nWe combined some responses to create three categories for\nboys' voice change (none, a little/somewhat, a lot/a whole lot\nof change). For menarche, girls were asked the following yes/\nno question: \"Have you ever had a menstrual period (menstru-\nated)?\" Pubertal status data were only collected at wave II.\nStatistical Analyses\nWe tested whether later bedtimes would be associated with\nan increase in BMI from adolescence to adulthood with hier-\narchical linear models (HLM) using a two-level, random in-\ntercept and slopes model. The HLM analyses were completed\nusing maximum likelihood estimation with STATA 12 soft-\nware (StatCorp, College Station, TX, 2011), utilizing methods\nfor cluster design survey data. All measures were centered at\nthe individual mean. Preliminary analyses determined that\nthere was a linear trend in the repeated measures for BMI (in-\ntraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.75; 2 = 0; degrees of\nLongitudinal mediation analyses were conducted to explore\nwhether sleep duration, fast-food consumption, screen time,\nand exercise frequency acted as partial mediators of the re-\nlationship between bedtimes and BMI. The first multivariate\nmodel (model 1) included age, wave II BMI, race/ethnicity pu-\nbertal status, welfare status, and biological sex. The theorized\nmediating variables of sleep duration, fast-food consumption,\nscreen time, and exercise frequency were progressively added\nin subsequent models (models 2, 3, 4, and 5) to test whether\nthese variables acted as mediators of the relationship between\nbedtime and BMI. We considered an attenuation of 10% in the\nbeta between bedtimes and BMI after including TST as a co-\nvariate to be consistent with mediation on an a priori basis.\nRESULTS\nA total of 3,342 participants comprised the sample for the\ncurrent study.

Going to bed during the workweek\neach additional hour later is associated with an increase of 2.1\nBMI kg/m2 (calculated by multiplying the beta (0.035) from the\nfully adjusted model by 60 min/h). Indeed, a chronic pattern of\nlate sleep timing (over a period of 13\u00ad15 years) has been previ-\nously demonstrated to contribute to metabolic disturbance,20\nwhich in turn may contribute to the physiologic processes un-\nderlying the steeper increase in BMI observed in this study.\nOur results were not consistent with sleep duration, screen\ntime, or exercise acting as partial mediators of the relation-\nship between bedtimes and BMI longitudinally. Although sur-\nprising that these factors were not significant mediators, this\nfinding supports the importance of considering bedtime in\nfuture research regarding the relationship between sleep and\nBMI. Conversely, fast-food consumption was a significant par-\ntial mediator of the relationship between bedtimes and BMI\nlongitudinally. The effect of later bedtimes upon dietary habits\ntherefore represents a potential target for future research and\nintervention.\nThe results of the current study should be interpreted within\nthe confines of several limitations. First, \"gold standard\" mea-\nsures for sleep and circadian rhythms such as sleep diary, ac-\ntigraphy,39 and forced desynchrony protocols40 were not used.\nHowever, the Add Health questions used as proxies are often\nused as an index of TST and bedtime preference.41,42 Second,\nall of the sleep data included in this study are based on self-\nreport. Although adolescents appear to be largely accurate and\nreliable on self-report measures,43 it can be difficult to accu-\nrately estimate one's sleep duration, bedtime, and wake times.\nFor example, participants may have been influenced by biases\nsuch as most recent night or most salient night sleep44 and\nadolescents may have incorporated their weekend bedtimes\nand total sleep times into their assessment of what is \"usual.\"\nAlthough impractical in large epidemiological studies, future\nresearch in smaller samples should endeavor to use the \"gold\nstandard\" tools to improve the contribution to knowledge.45\nThird, measurements of waist circumference would have been\nvaluable. Unfortunately, waist circumference measurements\nwere not available at all three waves. Although BMI is a ra-\ntiometric measurement that accounts for variation in height\nover weight,46 it cannot distinguish between lean muscle and\nabdominal fat. Fourth, Add Health questions assessing exer-\ncise frequency were inconsistent across waves and therefore\nexercise frequency across waves was not available. Instead, ex-\nercise frequency at wave II was included as a covariate. Future\nresearch should investigate how exercise frequency over time\nmay contribute to the relationship between bedtime and BMI.\nLast, loss to follow-up (n = 52) was related to baseline levels\nof BMI in the current study (t = 3.62, P = 0). The reasons for\nthis pattern of findings are unknown. No other variables were\nrelated to loss to follow-up.\nIn conclusion, to our knowledge, this is the first study to\ninvestigate the relationship between bedtime and BMI lon-\ngitudinally in an observational study. Later average bedtime\nduring the workweek in the years from adolescence to adult-\nhood was associated with an increase in BMI across that pe-\nriod. These results remained significant even after controlling\nfor sleep duration, baseline BMI, demographic characteristics,\nscreen time, exercise frequency, and fast-food consumption.\nOur results highlight adolescent bedtimes as a potential target\nfor weight management concurrently and in the transition to\nadulthood.\nThis project was supported by a National Science Founda-\nto Dr. Asarnow, a National Institute of Mental Health\ntional Institute of Child Health and Human Development\nawarded to Dr. Harvey.
