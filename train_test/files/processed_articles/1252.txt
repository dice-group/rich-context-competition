To evaluate haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting glucose, serum C-peptide and insulin resistance in relation to serum uric acid\nlevels in a nationally representative sample of men and women.\nMethods. Using data from 14 664 participants aged 20 yrs and older in The US Third  \n(1988\u00ad1994), we examined the relation between the levels of HbA1c, other biomarkers and serum uric acid levels using multivariate linear\nregressions stratified by gender.\nResults. The serum uric acid levels increased with increasing serum HbA1c levels up to the category of 6\u00ad6.9%, and thereafter decreased\nwith further increasing HbA1c levels (a bell-shaped relation). Compared with a HbA1c level of <5%, the multivariate differences among\nfrom those among women (P-values for interaction by sex <0.001). Fasting glucose levels also showed a bell-shaped relation with serum uric\nacid levels. Individuals with diabetes showed lower serum uric acid levels and the association was larger among men (P-value for interaction,\n0.007). Serum uric acid levels increased linearly with increasing fasting serum C-peptide levels, serum insulin levels or insulin resistance\n(multivariate P-values for trend, <0.001).\nConclusions. Individuals with moderately elevated HbA1c levels (i.e. pre-diabetes) may be at a higher risk of hyperuricaemia and gout,\nparticularly in women, whereas individuals with diabetes or highly elevated HbA1c levels may be at a lower risk of these conditions,\nparticularly in men.\nKEY WORDS: Uric acid, Gout, Haemoglobin A1c, C-peptide, Insulin, Insulin resistance, NHANES III.\nIntroduction\nHyperuricaemia is considered the precursor of gout, which is the\nmost common inflammatory arthritis in adult men [1]. Several\nstudies have shown that a moderate degree of hyperglycaemia is\nassociated with higher serum uric acid levels, while a higher degree\nof hyperglycaemia (>10 mmol/l [180 mg/dl]) is associated with\nlower serum uric acid levels [2\u00ad5]. This bell-shaped relationship\nraises an interesting implication of the diverging risk of hyper-\nuricaemia or gout among pre-diabetic vs diabetic individuals.\nWhile the spot blood glucose test reflects glucose levels at the\nmoment of the test, glycated haemoglobin or haemoglobin A1c\n(HbA1c) reflects an average blood glucose level over the past 3\nmonths. Thus, HbA1c levels provide a longer-term picture of blood\nglucose status as an exposure variable. To date, no study has\ninvestigated the relation between HbA1c and serum uric acid levels.\nFurthermore, although several previous studies have described rela-\ntions between insulin levels, insulin resistance and serum uric acid\nlevels [6\u00ad10], we are not aware of any study that investigated the link\nwith C-peptide (a measure of endogenous insulin levels [11]).\nTo examine these issues, we analysed a nationally representa-\ntive sample of men and women (the US Third National Health\nand Nutritional Examination Survey, NHANES III) [12, 13].\nMaterials and methods\nStudy population\nrepresentative sample of the non-institutionalized civilian US\npopulation, which was selected by using a multistage, stratified\nsampling design [12]. After a home interview, participants were\ninvited to attend examination sessions where blood and urine\nspecimens were obtained. For participants unable to attend the\nexamination for health reasons, a blood sample was obtained\nduring the home interview. We limited our analysis for HbA1c\nlevels to participants 20 yrs or older who attended the medical\n7803 women) with complete information in our analyses. We\nrepeated our analyses among 14 223 participants after excluding\nthose who self-reported gout or were taking allopurinol or\nuricosuric agents (n \u00bc 441). For the blood tests that required\nfasting (i.e. fasting C-peptide, blood glucose, insulin levels), we\nwomen) who had fasted at least 8 h prior to the blood collection.\nThe NHANES III study underwent institutional review board\napproval, and written informed consent was obtained from\nparticipants prior to starting the study.\nMeasurements\nGlycosylated haemoglobin concentration was measured by ion-\nexchange HPLC with a glycosylated haemoglobin analyser\nsystem (DIAMAT; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA),\nC-peptide levels by use of a RIA (Bio-Rad Laboratories), plasma\nglucose levels by a hexokinase enzymatic reference method\n(COBAS MIRA; Roche Diagnostics Corporation, Laboratory\nSystems, Montclair, New Jersey, USA) and serum insulin levels\nby means of an RIA (Pharmacia Diagnostics, Uppsala, Sweden)\n[12, 13].

A Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA) was used to\nevaluate insulin resistance [15, 16]. Assuming that normal subjects\naged 35 with normal weight have an insulin resistance of 1, the\nvalues for a patient can be calculated from the fasting concentra-\ntions of insulin and glucose using the following formula: fasting\nserum insulin (U/ml) \u00c2 fasting plasma glucose (mmol/l)/22.5\nSerum uric acid was measured by oxidization with the specific\nenzyme uricase to form allantoin and H2\nMultichannel Analyzer, Boehringer Mannheim Diagnostics,\nIndianapolis, IN, USA). Details about quality-control procedures\nhave been published elsewhere [13]. Values are reported in\nmicromoles per litre; to convert to milligrams per decilitre,\nAssessment of co-variates\nThe average daily intakes of total meat, seafood and dairy foods\nwere derived from responses to a food frequency questionnaire.\nFood frequency questionnaire assessment of dietary intake has\nbeen shown to be a valid and reliable method for assessing average\ndietary consumption [17, 18]. The NHANES III collected\ninformation on body measurements (including height and\nweight), medication use (including diuretics, anti-hypertensives,\nallopurinol and uricosuric agents), medical conditions (including\nself-reported physician-diagnosed diabetes, hypertension and\ngout) and serum creatinine. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR)\nwas estimated by using the simplified Modification of Diet\nin Renal Disease study equation: GFR (ml/min/1.73 m2) \u00bc\ndividing the weight in kilograms by the square of the height in\nmetres.\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analyses were computed using survey commands\nof STATA (e.g. SVYMEAN and SVYREG) to incorporate\nsample weights and adjust for clusters and strata of the complex\nsample design (Version 8.2, STATA Corporation, College Station,\nWe used linear regression modelling to evaluate the relation\nbetween HbA1c levels, other glucose\u00adinsulin markers and uric\nacid levels. Percentage of HbA1c was categorized into six groups:\nand !2 nmol/l. Because previous reports suggested significant\ndifferences between sexes in the relation between glucose\u00adinsulin\nmarkers and serum uric acid levels [10], our analyses were\nstratified by sex. We evaluated the significance of the potential\ninteraction by sex by testing the significance of interaction\nterms added to our final multivariate models. These models\nwere adjusted for age, smoking status, BMI, use of diuretics,\n-blockers, allopurinol and uricosuric agents, self-reported\nhypertension, GFR, and intake of total energy, total meats,\nseafood, dairy foods, sugar-sweetened soft drinks and coffee.\nWhen categorical analyses suggested linear trends across cate-\ngories, statistical significance of trends were assessed in the final\nmultivariate linear regression models by using the median values\nof each category to minimize the influence of outliers. We also\nperformed logistic regression with a dichotomous outcome of\nhyperuricaemia (i.e. serum uric acid >416 mol/l [7 mg/dl] among\nmen and serum uric acid >339 mol/l among women [5.7 mg/dl]\n[13]), adjusting for the same covariates. We examined the potential\nimpact of an alternative definition of hyperuricaemia (serum\nuric acid >357 mol/l [6 mg/dl] regardless of sex) in these\nregression models. To graphically display the relation between\nHbA1c levels, fasting blood glucose levels, and serum uric acid\nlevels, we plotted the predicted values of quadratic models\n(using continuous values) and CIs, reflecting the relation\nsuggested by the categorical analyses. For serum C-peptide,\ninsulin and insulin resistance levels, we plotted the predicted\nvalues of linear regression models with CIs. For all difference\nestimates and odds ratios (ORs), we calculated 95% CIs. All\nP-values are two-sided.\nResults\nThe population's mean age was 45 yrs.

Similarly, serum insulin levels and insulin resistance by\nHOMA showed a linearly increasing association both with serum\nuric acid levels and odds of hyperuricaemia (both multivariate\nDiscussion\nIn this nationally representative sample of US men and women,\nwe found that the serum uric acid levels and the frequency\nof hyperuricaemia increased with moderately increasing levels\nof HbA1c (6\u00ad6.9%) and then decreased with further increasing\nlevels of HbA1c (a bell-shaped relation).

In comparison, serum uric acid levels and frequency of\nhyperuricaemia monotonically increased with increasing fasting\nC-peptide levels, as with increasing serum insulin levels and\ninsulin resistance. These associations were independent of other\nrisk factors for hyperuricaemia such as age, sex, BMI, dietary\nfactors, alcohol intake, renal function, hypertension and\ndiuretic use.\nA biological mechanism underlying the bell-shaped relation\nbetween blood glucose levels and serum uric acid levels is thought\nto be due to the uricosuric effect of glycosuria, which occurs when\nthe blood glucose level is greater than $10 mmol/l (180 mg/dl) [2].\nThis level of blood glucose was consistent with that of HbA1c that\ncorresponded to the peak of serum uric acid in our data, further\nFasting serum glucose\nHb A1c (%)\nSerum uric acid levels, mmol/l (mg/dl)\nSerum uric acid levels, mmol/l (mg/dl)\nWomen Men Women Men\nFIG. 1.

Correspondingly, history of diabetes was\nsignificantly associated with lower levels of serum uric acid in this\nstudy as well as in previous studies [2\u00ad5]. Our extended\nmultivariate analyses showed that this inverse association\nbecame larger and stronger after adjusting for C-peptide, but\nbecame smaller and insignificant after adjusting for HbA1c,\nsuggesting that the inverse link was due to average blood glucose\nlevels. Collectively, these results indicate that individuals with pre-\ndiabetes may be at a higher risk of developing gout, but once they\ndevelop diabetes their risk may drop to a lower level than that of\nnormal individuals. This potential impact on the eventual risk\nof gout was also supported by our results with hyperuricaemia as\na dichotomous outcome using various definitions.\nThe strong, linear and independent association between fasting\nserum C-peptide levels and serum uric acid levels in this nationally\nrepresentative sample further adds to the close link between\ninsulin levels, insulin resistance and serum uric acid levels found\nin previous studies [6\u00ad10] as well as in this study. Higher insulin\nlevels are known to reduce renal excretion of urate [7\u00ad9, 22].\nFor example, exogenous insulin can reduce the renal excretion\nof urate in both healthy and hypertensive subjects [7, 8, 23].\nInsulin may enhance renal urate reabsorption via stimulation of\npmol/l\nuu/l\nSerum uric acid levels, mmol/l (mg/dl)\nSerum uric acid levels , mmol/l (mg/dl)\nFasting insulin levels\nWomen Men\nWomen Men\nWomen Men\nFasting C-peptide (nmol/l)\nHOMA-insulin resistance\nSerum uric acid levels mmol/l (mg/dl)\nFIG. 2.

Collectively, these data provide a strong\nmechanism underlying the close link between the metabolic\nsyndrome, hyperuricaemia and gout [26\u00ad29]. The increased insulin\nlevels in individuals with insulin resistance syndrome could\nconceivably contribute to their elevated serum uric acid levels to\nthe point where the effect is offset by subsequent development of\ndiabetes, leading to glycosuria, uricosuria and lower uric acid\nlevels.\nWe found that the positive associations between HbA1c (levels\n<7%), serum C-peptide levels, and serum uric acid levels were\nlarger among women than men. These data closely agree with a\npopulation study of non-diabetic adults [10]. This Chinese\ncommunity-based study reported a stronger association between\nfasting plasma glucose, serum insulin levels and serum uric acid\nlevels among women than among men [10]. Furthermore, our\nresults revealed that the inverse association between diabetes (or a\nlevel of HbA1c !7%) and serum uric acid levels was significantly\nstronger among men than among women. The mechanism behind\nthese apparent gender differences remains unclear, although the\nrole of female sex hormones has been suspected [10]. It also\nremains to be studied whether these differences could translate\ninto a differential risk of gout between sexes.\nStrengths and limitations of our study deserve comment. This\nstudy was performed in a nationally representative sample of US\nwomen and men; thus, the findings are likely to be generalizable\nto US men and women. Although previous reports and biological\nplausibility consistently suggest that blood glucose and insulin\nlevels would affect the serum uric acid levels as observed [2\u00ad10],\na cross-sectional study design tends to leave uncertainty regarding\nthe temporal sequence of exposure\u00adoutcome relations. Thus,\nconfirming the relation with prospective longitudinal data (e.g.\nrelation between prior HbA1c, diabetes and incident hyperur-\nicaemia or gout) would be valuable. Furthermore, it would be\ninteresting to study whether controlling diabetes by reducing\nglycosuria would raise serum urate levels and increase the risk of\ngout in this high-risk group.\nIn conclusion, individuals with moderately elevated HbA1c\nlevels (i.e. pre-diabetes) may be at a higher risk of hyperuricaemia\nand gout, particularly in women, whereas individuals with highly\nelevated HbA1c levels or diabetes may be at a lower risk of these\nconditions, particularly in men.\nDisclosure statement: The authors have declared no conflicts of\ninterest.\nReferences\n1 Roubenoff R, Klag MJ, Mead LA, Liang KY, Seidler AJ, Hochberg MC.
