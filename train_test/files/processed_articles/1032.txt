Consequently, it is not particularly surprising that various surveys often\nshow that fear of becoming the victim of a crime is an issue of concern for most\nAmericans. However, it is most interesting that fear of crime is not evenly\ndistributed among the population, with levels of fear being greatest for elderly\nAmericans (Warr 1995). In fact, fear of victimization is of greater concern than\nworries about health, money, or loneliness (McCabe and Gregory 1998; Ortega\nand Myles 1987). As a growing proportion of the population is comprised of\nolder persons, interest has increased in the elderly and many of the problems\nthey encounter, including their risks regarding safety and criminal victimization.\nIn 1995, almost 13 percent of the population of the United States were aged\nof Americans will fall in that age range. In essence the aging of the baby\nboomers will result in the largest generation of elderly persons ever witnessed in\nrather dramatic demographic changes related to the elderly will likely influence\npublic policy, especially concerning health care issues and risks associated with\naging. Historically, violent crime against the elderly is a relatively rare event,\nbut by virtue of the sheer number of people entering that age group, that risk is\nlikely to increase.\nAlthough fear of crime among the elderly may be greater than the actual\nthreat of victimization, this fear may be explained in part by declines in physical\nstrength and in the senses, which yield increased feelings of vulnerability and\npowerlessness. Compared to younger victims of violence, recent research indi-\ncates that elderly victims are more likely to sustain serious injuries and even\nof violence, the effect on their lives is often more significant than for younger\npersons. Consequently, their fears can be more easily understood, even if the\nactual risk of victimization is lower than the perceived risk. Research by McCabe\nolder adults alike perceive the elderly as vulnerable to crimes.\nFear of crime is accentuated by the fact that many elderly persons live alone\nand are more likely to be isolated from neighborhood and community groups.\nResearch suggests that self-protective tendencies of the elderly, such as restrict-\ning their trips in the community to those that are essential, contribute to higher\nan inordinate amount of time and effort adapting to their increased frailty and\nperceived risk of victimization. In fact, fear of crime and victimization is seem-\ningly an integral part of the lives of many older people (McCabe and Gregory\n1998), which may account for the perception that the elderly are \"easy targets.\"\nDespite the rather extensive body of literature on fear of crime among the\nelderly, actual violence against older persons remains poorly understood. This is\nin part due to the fact that, until recently, not much attention has been given to\nFinkelhor 1988). This lack of attention, in turn, is probably due to the fact that\nthis type of homicide occurs on an infrequent basis (MacKellar and Yanagishita\n1995). In recent years, victimization of persons aged 65 and older constitutes\napproximately 5 percent of all homicides (Bureau of Justice Statistics 1994;\nportion of elderly in the United States increase, determining which factors influ-\nence the incidence of homicide of the elderly becomes critical for prevention\nand other policy reasons. The present study attempts to address these concerns.\nStructural and Cultural Influences\nTraditionally, aggregate-level research on homicide has sought to explain\nlevels of lethal violence across geographic units by examining a variety of eco-\nlogical characteristics thought to influence homicide. As Messner and Rosenfeld\n(1999, p. 27) have noted, the rationale behind this approach is that homicides are\nnot simply \"idiosyncratic individual acts of violence,\" but rather behavior which\nis distributed in a patterned manner. Typically, the ecological characteristics\nemployed in this type of research can be categorized into one of two types:\ncultural/subcultural, which involves the influence of values, norms, and beliefs;\nand structure, which involves the impact of social positions and the behavioral\nexpectations attached to them (Messner and Rosenfeld 1999).\nCulture, Religion, and Homicide of the Elderly\nAn important function of culture is to identify and specify appropriate\nrelations between people. While the meanings attached to culture are numerous,\nit can be generally described as a collection of resources or, as suggested by\nSwidler (1986), a \"tool kit\" that can be used in dealing with various social\nsituations. In that context, Wolfgang and Ferracuti (1967) further maintain\nthat within any culture, subcultures may develop. Possibly the most commonly\nutilized context is regional in basis, with particular emphasis on the so-called\n\"Southern\" culture. The earliest studies of violence in the United States sug-\ngested that homicide occurs more frequently in the South (Brearly 1932; Redfield\n1880). Since then, a number of studies have attempted to establish a link between\nculture and violence, and an expansive body of literature focuses on the notion\nthat rates of homicide are higher in the South because the culture promotes\nIn regard to the elderly, most cultures hold that elders are to be respected\nby others and are to be treated accordingly--at least in an ideal sense. Southern\nculture is no exception to this rule. As noted by Haber (1989), elderly people\nare elevated to a position of respect and honor. Research by Taylor and col-\nset of cultural values which encourages familial assistance to the elderly. To the\ncontrary, however, they are sometimes thought of as a burden because growing\nolder also results in a corresponding decline in productivity (Luborsky and\nWhen these attitudes toward the elderly are examined within the context of\nSouthern culture and violence, a number of interesting questions emerge:\nAre elderly persons less likely to become homicide victims because of their \"respected\" status,\nor are they at greater risk because they are viewed as a burden? Or, does their position have no\nimpact on potential victimization?\nIn short, assessing the influence of Southern culture will help to clarify\nwhether elderly persons are protected from victimization or if, on the other hand,\nelderly persons are thought of as vulnerable and burdensome, in which case they\nwould be less likely to enjoy the protection afforded by this status. One objective\nof this study is to examine the influence of a variable that has been identified as\nclosely related to, if not a proxy for, Southern culture--conservative Protestant\naffiliation. As will be discussed below, it has been suggested that religion and\nculture in the South are mutually reinforcing (Stump 1986).\nMessner and Rosenfeld (1999) suggest that social institutions can serve as\na conduit between structure and culture, depending on the degree of integration\nof those institutions within a culture/subculture. As noted earlier, religion seems\nto be particularly salient in the South. Several factors are responsible for the\nstrong connection between religion and culture in this region. For example,\nGastil (1975) notes that the South is the most religious region of the country,\nin terms of reported affiliation and in frequency of church attendance. Because\nthe church serves as a primary reference group for many, its influence on the\nsocialization process is increased.\nMore importantly, however, the distinctiveness of religious affiliation in\nthis region--Conservative Protestantism--accentuates this belief. While regional\ndifferences in terms of religious affiliation are eroding somewhat, Conservative\nProtestantism continues to dominate in the South (Corzine, Huff-Corzine, and\nWhitt 1999). Both conservative Protestant theology as it evolved in the South\nand the culture of the region were influenced greatly by circumstances and\nevents unique to the area. Conservative Protestant denominations were part-\nicularly resistant to liberalization of belief that occurred in more moderate and\nliberal denominations, especially in relation to issues such as slavery, modern-\nization, and the evolution/creation debate (Roof and McKinney 1987). In sum,\nwhat is referred to by Gastil (1971, 1975) as a \"siege mentality\" has resulted. No\ndoubt, cultural differences are important factors that influence the direction of\ncausal attributions (Whitt, Corzine, and Huff-Corzine 1995). Of key importance\nis the idea that external forces are responsible for negative situations. In particu-\nlar, two tenets of conservative Protestant belief are central to the nexus of\nreligion and culture: First, the Bible is the infallible word of God that should be\ninterpreted literally; and second, that salvation requires a conversion experience,\nthe legitimacy of which is ultimately determined by God. Just as the determina-\ntion of salvation is external so, too, are attributions for various life events and\nexperiences. In essence, culture and religion are key macro-level factors that\nprovide a lens of sorts through which individuals view, interpret, and react to\nlife events\u00adincluding negative ones. Accordingly, if culture promotes the notion\nthat others are to be blamed for misfortune, externally-directed violence is more\nlikely. Ellison (1991) links religious culture with attitudes toward violence by\nsuggesting that individuals who view the relationship between God and man as\nhierarchical also tend to hold attitudes tolerant of violence. The latter point is a\ncomponent of the nexus between culture and homicide as it relates to attribu-\ntions of situations (Lupfer, Hopkinson, and Kelley 1988).\nIn sum, these examples show the utility of attributions as a key element in\nthe linking of culture and homicide at the macro-level (Corzine et al. 1999). It is\nin this manner that Conservative Protestantism promotes notions of external\nOne should not misinterpret this statement as suggesting that Conservative\nProtestantism condones murder. To the contrary, these aspects of religious belief\nhelp to develop and reinforce external causality which, if present in a culture\ntolerant of violence in certain situations (as is suggested to be the case in the\nSouth), aggression and homicide may be more likely in certain situations if the\nability of religion to act as an agent of social control is weakened.\nRoutine Activities and Elderly Homicide\nStructural analyses of violent crime typically focus on the influence of corre-\nlates such as social class, race, gender, and age. However, Messner and Rosenfeld\n(1999) suggest that routine activities and opportunity are also important structural\ninfluences, in terms of how these factors facilitate the convergence of offenders,\nvictims, and guardians. Both Messner and Tardiff (1985) and Nelsen and Huff-\nCorzine (1998) suggest that elderly homicide can be a function of routine activit-\nies. As formulated by Cohen and Felson (1979), routine activities refers to the\nnotion that predatory crime results from the day-to-day activities--both legitimate\nand criminal--that take place in a community. More specifically, Cohen and\nFelson (1979, p. 589) maintain that direct contact predatory crime is influenced by\nthe convergence in time and space of motivated offenders, suitable targets, and a\nrelative lack of guardianship which would otherwise prevent such crime. This\napproach would suggest that homicide will occur when the activity patterns of\nthe victim intersects with those of potential offenders. For the aged, this would\nseem to imply that they would be more likely to be killed by a family member,\nsince the decreased mobility associated with aging often leads to a more restricted\nlifestyle, with fewer interpersonal contacts (Messner and Tardiff 1985).\nHowever, a number of other studies suggest that the relatively isolated life-\nstyle of the elderly may make them more prone to homicide victimization associ-\nated with robbery or burglary, particularly in urban areas (Falzon and Davis 1998;\nduring 1989\u00ad1991 (the years under consideration in the present study), robberies\naccounted for one in three homicides for persons aged 65 and older.\nSo while social isolation has generally been associated with lower levels of\nvictimization, in this case it may actually serve as a liability because an isolated\nolder person may be perceived as being a more convenient target by potential\noffenders. Moreover, while a younger person might recover from an attack, the\nelderly victim may be at greater risk of death. This higher risk of theft-related\nhomicide is likely related to their lifestyle and being perceived as convenient\ntargets (Nelsen and Huff-Corzine 1998). In that regard, one could argue that fear\nof crime among the elderly is reflected more accurately by the actual risks to\nwhich they as a group are exposed to than has generally been presumed.\nWhen viewed from the routine activities perspective, these seemingly\ndivergent findings suggest two potential offender pools. The first would suggest\nthat homicides of the elderly are more likely to occur at the hands of family\nmembers, particularly spouses and children--which would imply that offenders\nare older than what is typically seen for homicide in general. The second\noffender pool suggested by the research of Nelsen and Huff-Corzine (1998) would\nimplicate a younger age group, more consistent with the traditional profile for\npredatory homicide offenders. The present study will examine both in an attempt\nto clarify this apparent discrepancy.\nGoing Beyond Culture versus Structure\nThe previous sections provide examples of what has been in the eyes of\nsome a distraction in the study of homicide at the aggregate level: the culture\nversus structure debate. Specifically, much discussion has centered on whether\nregional variation is due to cultural forces, structural factors, or both. As men-\noccurs more frequently in the South as a consequence of a regional subculture\nthat is tolerant of or conducive to violence in particular situations (e.g., in\ndefense of property or when one's \"honor\" has been challenged).\nOn the other hand, Loftin and Hill (1974) revisited these studies and\nconcluded that by including variables for economic and educational deprivation,\nthe influence of a Southern regional variable (which should not be confused with\nSouthern culture) is reduced. A number of other studies have drawn similar\nconclusions. For example, using state-level data, Smith and Parker (1980) sug-\ngest that the influence of region on primary and secondary homicide is decreased\nwhen structural variables are included. Allen and Bankston (1981) draw similar\nconclusions based on their study of homicide in Louisiana, where distinct cul-\ntural differences between parishes having similar structural attributes are present.\nemphasize how controlling for economic inequality reduces the influence of the\nSouthern variable.\nSince then, numerous studies have supported arguments in favor of cul-\ntural, structural, or both sets of factors (see Land, McCall, and Cohen 1990;\naforementioned studies are but a few examples of the large body of research that\nhas contributed to the culture versus structure debate. The seminal work of Land\nand colleagues (1990) in some ways reframed this debate by suggesting that\nthese explanations are not mutually exclusive. Following an exhaustive review\nof research, the authors via principal components analysis identify two categories\nof variables consistently related to homicide at the aggregate level: population\ncomposition and resource affluence/deprivation. In doing so, a number of diver-\ngent findings are at least in part resolved, which illustrates the utility of not\nviewing one category as being more important than the other. This suggestion is\nconsistent with Messner (1983), who found South/Non-South differences when\nincluding race/region interaction terms. Furthermore, while not discussed here, a\nkey element of the integrated model of Whitt and colleagues (Unnithan et al.\ninfluence both the level and direction of lethal violence.\nMethods and Data\nThe previous discussion suggests at least two potential scenarios pertaining\nto homicide of the elderly: 1) Elderly persons may be vulnerable to attacks of a\npredatory nature, particularly in the context of a robbery. If elderly persons are\nviewed as a vulnerable target, the likelihood of homicide during a robbery may\nactually increase via the potential for physical injury. 2) However, to the extent\nthat elderly persons are viewed with respect and are treated accordingly, such\nattacks may be decreased. Attitudes toward the elderly can influence how older\npersons are treated by acquaintances, friends, and family members.\nThe present study seeks to clarify this potential discrepancy in the literature\nby identifying the influence of situational and cultural factors associated with\nhomicide of the elderly, controlling for those structural factors consistently\nfound to be related to homicide in general. Specifically, the relevance of cultural\nfactors (as expressed in conservative Protestant affiliation) will be explored,\ncontrolling for various contexts related to the victim/offender/guardian nexus.\nIn that regard, a key element exists in the nature of the relationship between\nreligion and the killing of older persons.\nAs homicide of the elderly is a relatively rare event, one concern is that a\nthe time period under consideration in the present study. As opposed to calculat-\ning an elderly homicide rate for each county, we instead elect to use the actual\nfrequency of homicide. There are several methodological concerns which led us\nto this decision. As Osgood has noted (Osgood 2000; Osgood and Chambers\n2001), ordinary least squares (OLS) regression techniques may be inappropriate\nwhen the rate of a phenomenon is calculated from a relatively small number of\nevents. Moreover, if the geographic unit being examined is relatively small (i.e.,\nwith a population of a few thousand), a single occurrence of an event can result\nin a large increase in the calculated rate. Of course, when matched with the rate\nof a larger geographic unit, the comparison could be misleading. Moreover, the\nvariability of population sizes across counties could result in violating the OLS\nassumption of homogeneity of error variance. There is also the possibility that as\npopulations decrease a rate of zero will occur with some frequency, thus violat-\ning the normality assumption (Osgood 2000).\nIn addressing the problem that homicide of the elderly is an infrequent\nevent, the present study will utilize negative binomial regression, a technique\nsuitable for rare events (Long 1997). Negative binomial regression is a form of\nPoisson regression, designed for the use of count data, and does not assume the\nhomogeneity of error variance. The negative binomial variant is better suited for\nthe overdispersion of the difference between fitted and observed data (Osgood\nthe appropriateness of this technique for the models discussed later.2\nDependent variable\nhomicide victimizations of persons aged 65 and older. This measure allows for a\nmore accurate representation of deaths in a given county, such as when in a\nsingle year, a location experiences an unusually high level of homicide. Like-\nwise, a county may uncharacteristically report no elderly homicides for a single\nIndependent variables\nThe primary measure of culture utilized in this study is percent of the\npopulation affiliated with a conservative Protestant denomination. Identification\nof conservative Protestant denominations follows the classification of Roof and\nMcKinney (1987), which includes belief in a literal interpretation of the Bible\nand the necessity of a conversion experience for salvation. Percent of the county\npopulation affiliated with any church is included, based on the finding of Stark,\nDoyle, and Kent (1980) who assert that overall level of religiosity/secularization\nin a given area influences conformity. In essence, the extent to which the church\nacts as a mechanism of social control is potentially greater in those counties where\nattendance is higher. Both religion variables are obtained from the 1990 Churches\nand Church Membership in the United States study (Bradley et al. 1992), to date\nthe most comprehensive survey of church membership in the United States.\nDefining what constitutes the region known as the South has proven rather\nelusive. Perhaps Garreau (1981) is correct in his assertion that its boundaries are\ndefined primarily by emotion. \"The South\" evokes images of not only a geo-\ngraphical area but of a regional subculture as well. In some respects, identifica-\ntion with Southern culture has replaced ethnic loyalties (Reed 1972; Roof and\nMcKinney 1987). Not surprisingly, a number of measures have been utilized in\nprevious studies. For example, dichotomous indicators for the Confederacy and\nthe US Census Bureau designation, or percent of the county population born in\nthe South have been utilized (Ellison 1991; Whitt et al. 1995). The present study\nincludes a dichotomous measure (coded 1 and 0, respectively) to indicate whether\nthe county is located in one of the former Confederate states.3\nIn many cases homicide of the elderly occurs in situations that begin as\nrobberies and, due to many of the issues outlined previously, the likelihood of\ndeath increases. Recall that studies by both Nelsen and Huff-Corzine (1998) and\nFalzon and Davis (1998) reveal the link between robbery and homicide of older\npersons--particularly in urban locations. Thus, the analyses that follow include\nthe 1990 robbery rate for each county. This information is derived from the\na dichotomous variable indicating whether or not the county is situated in a\nmetropolitan area (coded 1 and 0, respectively) is included.\nAdditional measures are included to assess key elements of the routine\nactivities theory in relation to the occurrence of homicide of the elderly, particu-\nlarly in relation to the presence (or absence) of offenders and guardians. As\nnoted previously, the issue of vulnerability is of extreme importance in homicide\nof the elderly, regardless of whether offenses occur in the context of felonies or\nin relation to increased interaction with others. Four separate models related to\npotential offenders, victims, and guardians will be examined in this study. The\nfirst measure utilized is percent of the county population aged 65 and older. The\nsecond model includes a measure for the percent of households headed by a\nsingle person who is 65 years or older. These two measures will be included in\nseparate equations to assess how the presence of vulnerable targets is related to\nelderly homicide. Data for both variables are obtained from the 1990 Census.\nAdditional models are included to assess the influence of the potential\noffender population and/or guardians. Recall that routine activities theory sug-\ngests two alternatives in regard to the nature of homicide of the elderly: On the\none hand, some studies have shown that homicide of this group often occurs in\nthe context of a robbery or other crime, whereas other research suggests that\nhomicide occurs at the hands of family members or other persons who provide\ncare or assistance. Consequently, interaction with others could either increase or\ndecrease the risk of homicide. This study includes two such measures: percent\nof the population between the ages of 15 and 29; and second, percent of the\ncounty population between 40 and 59 years of age. The former is included as a\nmeasure of potential offenders and the latter measure is employed as a means of\nassessing potential contact with persons younger than the offender (such as\nspouses, children, and other caregivers). These variables, also included in separ-\nate models, will assist in clarifying the situations in which these incidents occur.\nThat is, how does the presence of potential offenders and/or guardians influence\nthe occurrence of homicide of the elderly? According to the Supplemental Homi-\nfor 41.4 and 17.8 percent, respectively, of elderly homicides in which the age\nof the offender is known.\nAs stated previously, Land and colleagues (1990), in an exhaustive review\nand analysis of research focusing on structural correlates of homicide, identified\ntwo primary categories of variables that are consistently related to homicide:\npopulation composition and resource affluence/deprivation. Structural variables\nemployed in this study are based upon this research. Population measures con-\nsist of the 1990 county population and density, along with the percent of the\npopulation that is African American, each transformed into natural logarithm\nform and included as a summed scale. Resource affluence/deprivation variables\ninclude the percent of the county population in poverty in 1990, percent of\nchildren living in single-parent families headed by a female, and the Gini index\nof inequality. These data were obtained from the 1990 Census. Please note that\nthe states of Alaska and Hawaii are excluded from the following analyses.\nFindings\nTable 1 presents the analyses that separately employ the respective meas-\nures related to elderly population composition. Model A includes percent of the\ncounty population aged 65 and older which, although in the expected direction,\nis not significantly related to the dependent variable. However, Model A indi-\ncates that even when controlling for the 1990 robbery rate, metropolitan area\nand Southern location, both religion variables are significantly related to the\nelderly homicide count. Homicide of the elderly is associated with increased\nconservative Protestant and lower overall church affiliation. With the exception\nof percent in poverty, the remaining control variables are significant and are\nrelated to the dependent variable as anticipated. Model B of Table 1 employs the\nvariable that measures the proportion of households headed by a single person\naged 65 and older. Likewise, this variable is not significantly related to the\ndependent variable and furthermore, the direction of the association changes.\nWith the exception of the Confederate variable decreasing in influence, the\nfindings are virtually identical to that found in the previous model. Once again,\nthe key religion variables are related to homicide of the elderly as expected.\nThe Pseudo-R2 for A and B indicate that a moderate proportion of variance is\nexplained by the respective models.\nTable 2 presents those models focusing specifically on how the potential\npresence of offenders and/or guardians is related to homicide of the elderly.\nModel C includes the percent of the population aged 40 to 59. From the previous\ndiscussion, recall that various studies suggest the possibility that persons in this\nage group (be they acquaintances, children, or other caretakers) may comprise\neither potential offenders or guardians. In this instance, it appears that persons in\nthis age group serve neither function to a great degree. The fact that the relation-\nship is negative, however, suggests the possibility that members of this category\nare more likely to be potential guardians as opposed to offenders. Similar to\nthe previous findings, both religion variables are significant and in the expected\ndirection as is the case for the 1990 robbery rate, population index, and other\nkey control variables.\nModel A Model B\nVariable Coefficient Coefficient\nPseudo- Pseudo-\nModel C Model D\nVariable Coefficient Coefficient\nPseudo- Pseudo-\nModel D of Table 2 includes percent between the ages of 15 and 29.\nHomicide of the elderly is significantly and negatively related to this variable, a\nsomewhat surprising finding given the propensity of elder homicides to occur in\nthe context of a robbery and that offenders are more likely to be younger. While\ninclusion of this variable does not affect the overall model to a great extent, key\ndifferences are evident. In this instance percent in poverty becomes significant,\neven though it appears that across the four models, inequality as reflected in the\nGini index is more strongly related to elder homicide. That inequality, as opposed\nto absolute deprivation, is more consistently associated with homicide is consist-\nent with the findings of Blau and Blau (1982). Likewise, in this instance the\nConfederacy variable is positive and significant. As in the previous examples,\nboth religion variables remain significant and in the expected direction.\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nThis study examines two important issues related to homicide of the elderly--\nthe impact of Southern culture and religion, as well as elaborating the situational\ncontext of these events. In doing so, questions pertaining to the relationship\nbetween Southern culture/religion and homicide are addressed by assessing the\ninfluence of conservative Protestant and overall church affiliation. Secondly, this\nstudy attempts to reconcile the seemingly disparate findings of previous studies\nas to the victim/offender relationships associated with elderly homicide. Various\nstudies suggest that homicide of the elderly is associated with robbery or that\nit is more likely to occur at the hands of family members or other caregivers.\nBy addressing these questions simultaneously, the contribution of one category\ncan be assessed when controlling for others. In this instance, doing so reveals\nthat both cultural and structural factors are important considerations (similar to\nthe contention of Unnithan et al. [1994] that the respective arguments are not\nmutually exclusive).\nIt has been argued that Conservative Protestantism is an influence on and\nlikewise reflects key elements of Southern culture, one in which elderly persons\nare believed to be held in particular esteem. Does this culture, then, insulate or\nprotect the elderly from homicide? In a word, no. At the county level, elderly\nhomicide is positively related to percent affiliated with a conservative Protestant\ndenomination and Southern region suggesting, contrary to the suggestions of\nTaylor (1985) that even in a cultural setting that purports to hold these individu-\nals in high regard, they continue to be at a greater risk.\nHowever, clarification of this apparent relationship is necessary. While homi-\ncide of the elderly is positively related to conservative Protestant affiliation and\nSouthern region, it is also negatively related to percent affiliated with any reli-\ngion. This finding suggests that homicide of the elderly is more likely to occur in\ncounties--particularly urban ones--where the influence of Southern culture is\ngreater, coupled with the lack of a social control offered by religion generally. In\nshort, the overall lower levels of religious affiliation is evidence of weakened\nboundaries on behavior in a cultural setting that is more tolerant of violence in\nparticular situations. The consistency of this relationship between conservative\nProtestant affiliation and elderly homicide across all models tested is noteworthy,\ngiven that the influence of important contextual and structural factors is controlled.\nThe second area of emphasis focuses on the contextual factors associated\nwith homicide of the elderly. Given the aforementioned discussion as to the\nextent to which robbery is a key motive/circumstance, it is not surprising that\nthe relationship between the robbery rate and elderly homicide is positive and\nsignificant across all models tested. Furthermore, the analyses presented here\nsuggest that when robbery is compared with specific age distribution variables\nthat reflect the presence (or lack thereof) of potential offenders, victims, and\nguardians, the former is more relevant. Therefore, it appears that risk of victimiz-\nation is related to increased vulnerability associated with old age. While elderly\nhomicide is positively related to an older population, it appears that living alone\ndoes not increase the risk. That percent aged 40 to 59 is negatively (but not\nsignificantly) related to elderly homicide implies these individuals are more apt\nto act as guardians as opposed to potential offenders. Thus, these findings are\nconsistent with the conclusions drawn by a number of studies that illuminate the\nimportance of robbery and/or burglary (e.g., Falzon and Davis 1998; Fox and\nFrom a policy standpoint however, because isolation apparently does not in-\ncrease the likelihood of victimization, the issue of vulnerability as it relates to\nvictimization by relatives or other acquaintances is of utmost concern.\nIn some ways, the finding that homicide of the elderly is negatively related\nto percent of the population aged 15 to 29 is surprising. Ellison (1991) offers a\npotential explanation for this finding that is particularly relevant to the nexus\nbetween culture, religion, and homicide. According to Ellison, the influence\nof Southern culture is greater among older persons and the relationship between\nage and support for violence is positive. Therefore, it appears that homicide\nof the elderly is likewise a function of the association between victims and\npotential offenders--in many cases spouses, children, and other acquaintances\nwho are in closer proximity to the age of the victim. Regardless of the age of the\noffender, elderly victims are more vulnerable to serious injury that may result in\ndeath. Identifying the age distribution of offenders in relation to the age of the\nvictim would assist in clarifying this relationship. Specifically, is robbery of the\nelderly more likely to occur at the hands of an older (but not elderly) person or\nare elderly persons targeted by young persons?\nFuture research should focus on further specifying the situational dynamics\nrelated to lethal violence involving elderly victims, particularly in regard to\nexamining the age distribution of offenders. An additional area not pursued in\nthis study involves the question of whether firearm availability influences homi-\ncide of the elderly. This question is particularly intriguing, given that homicide\nof the elderly frequently occurs in the context of a robbery and that on average,\never, this task is complicated because existing measures of firearm availability,\nparticularly at the county level, are limited at best (Corzine, Huff-Corzine, and\nWeaver 2000). Nonetheless, addressing this question can assist in identifying\nthose measures that will potentially reduce the risk of victimization for this\nvulnerable group.\nENDNOTES\n*A much earlier version of this paper was presented at the 1998 annual meeting of the Mid-\nSouth Sociological Association in Lafayette, Louisiana.

However, because this study\nexamines percent of the county population aged 65 and older as an element of routine activities/\nopportunity, this variation of the negative binomial procedure is not employed.\n3As noted by Whitt et al. (1995) a Confederacy variable excludes from the South the states of\nKentucky, Oklahoma, and West Virginia, all of which are arguably similar, culturally speaking, to\nthe Southern region. Alternatively, the Census Bureau designation of the Southern region includes\nthe states of Maryland and Delaware, as well as the District of Columbia--areas whose respective\ncultures more closely resemble that of the Northeast than the South. These concerns notwithstand-\ning, we elected to incorporate the former measure, due in part to potential multicollinearity between\npercent of the county born in the South and percent of the county population affiliated with a\nconservative Protestant denomination.\nREFERENCES\nAllen, H.
