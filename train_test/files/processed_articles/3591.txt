Students\nlike the ideas of openings if they look beyond the closed space.\n--Maxine Greene, personal communication, March 2013\nIt was Day 2 of the dance activity. The ARtS (Aesthetic,\nReflexive thoughts, & Sharing) initiative team, comprised\nof teaching artists, teachers, and university faculty, asked\nchildren to articulate the ways in which group dancing was\nrelated to our ongoing discussion on active citizenship.\nDuring the poetry, clay art, and dance activities so far, chil-\ndren have imagined and conceptualized the meaning of\n\"open\" community with the same eagerness Greene high-\nlights in the above excerpt, stressing the importance of cre-\nating possibilities outside of a typical closed, exclusive\ncommunity. Although children seemed to be exhausted\nafter practicing gestures, they soon enthusiastically par-\nticipated in dance activities that were meant to represent\nwho they are and their concepts of active citizenship and\ncommunity. Children made connections between group\ndances and active citizenship by underscoring their open,\ninclusive components--that is, looking at community in a\ndifferent way by challenging any closed understanding\nof it (Greene, 1995). For example, Daniella said, \"Group\ndancing is related to active citizenship because everyone is\nworking as a group in a community. If we mess up, then\nsomebody might correct you nicely.\" Isabelle responded to\nDaniella's elaboration about active citizenship by employ-\ning the metaphor of a street dance to express her own con-\nception of the term. Isabelle mentioned, \"Group dancing is\nactive citizenship . . . you are like being active when you\nare dancing and maybe if there is a street dance, the whole\nstreet is hosting a dance, then you could join in.\" Isabelle's\nmetaphor of group dancing as active citizenship was cre-\native and engaging. She hoped that anyone could join in\nthe community as an active citizen regardless of his or her\ncultural background. Isabelle's metaphor of community as\n\"a street dance\" opened up space for participation in the\ncommunity's urgent issues without remaining within\nalready-restricted borders or being aware of existing\nlimitations.\n1Loyola University Chicago, IL, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nSeungho Moon, Lewis Towers, 11th floor, 820 N.

The ARtS initiative is an aesthetic-infused after-\nschool curriculum that goes beyond increasing artistic skills\nto foster student sharing of individual lived experience in the\ncommunity. Pedagogically, theARtS initiative team intended\nto promote children's imagination and to allow them to see\nthe world in new ways. This openness toward possibility is a\nmeans to release the social imagination, conceivable only if\nchildren are open to new ideas and are willing to revisit and\nshare their existing values (Greene, 1995). The team of\nteaching artists, classroom teachers, and professors cre-\natively imparted the difficult concept of active citizenship to\nchildren through the use of vivid metaphors, personal experi-\nence in making clay art, and bodily movement in small and\nlarge group activities during a 9-week afterschool program.\nIn imagining different versions of community, I apply the\nnotion of \"community without community\" (Derrida, 1997;\nNancy, 1991) in revisiting the ARtS children's exploration of\ncommunity, self-other, and active citizenship. The overarch-\ning question is, what possibilities exist in the field of multi-\nculturalism when I, as a researcher, apply poststructuralist\ntheories while analyzing children's experiences during the\nARtS initiative? Mainstream multicultural education prac-\ntices favor a universalized, collective voice that ironically\nexcludes other important voices within the group. I decon-\nstruct the meanings of community and solidarity by reflect-\ning on salient learning moments. I explore the possibility of\nimagining community that moves beyond emphasizing soli-\ndarity and a collective \"we\"-ness in the pursuit of social\ntransformation.\nConceptual Framework: Community\nWithout Community\nThe ARtS initiative aims to support the existing school com-\nmunities' efforts to establish a much healthier community. I\nconceptualize a community without community as one that\nunderscores the importance of imagining the multiplicities of\ncommunities that cannot be universalized by existing cul-\ntural norms, or by predetermined notions of cultural same-\ntheorization of \"community without community\" stems from\nDerrida's (1997) elaboration of proleptic eschatology--that\nis, challenging a linear, chronicle understanding of the past,\npresent, and future and anticipating its integral relationship\namong these three parts of time in order to create a space\nwith eternally open-ended possibilities. In his book The\nPolitics of Friendship, Jacques Derrida calls for a \"commu-\nnity without community of thinkers to come\" (p. 62). He\ndevelops this idea of community without community with an\nanalogy of friendship politics. Conventionally, \"good\"\nfriendship derives from a certain form of intimacy among\nfriends; these friends supporting each other because of their\nestablished genuine intimacy. Derrida, on the other hand,\nargues that actual and genuine intimacy of friendship is\nintangible, and the singularities between two friends are per-\nmutated without predictable, stable anticipation. The notion\nof \"good\" friendship is deferred in that relationship and is\nnot predetermined before these interactions have happened.\nAccording to Derrida, friendship (or enmity) operates inter-\ndependently and \"letting the other come\" for friendship is\nperhaps possible \"only if the other precedes and informs\nme--only if the other is the condition of my immanence\" (p.\n42). The predetermined understanding of friends (or enmi-\nties) becomes dangerously unstable in that good friendship\ndoes not operate by encouraging a typical understanding of a\ntrue friendship. Derrida paradoxically articulates that \"the\nfriends of truth are not in the truth\" (p. 43). He continues, it\nis not true friendship if friends are \"installed there as in the\npadlocked security of a dogma and the stable reliability of an\nopinion\" (p. 43). Due to its danger of establishing \"true\"\nfriendship with a dogma or stable prediction, the apex of\n\"good friendship\" is never reached, nor can its definition be\nconfined within a monolithic, universal meaning. Rather, the\nmeaning of \"friendship\" is always deliberately withheld and\ndelayed because actual interactions between friends, operat-\ning within a very particular sociocultural context, influence\nthe very construction of such unpredictable meanings.\nFurthermore, in the articulation of \"to-come,\" Derrida\nexplicates the notion of community yet to come [\u00e0 venir]. In\ndifferent writings, Derrida (2005) uses the term of \"yet to\ncome,\" such as \"democracy yet to come\" (p. 62). This pro-\nleptic component of hope resides in his expression of democ-\nracy as never existing as its current existing form; rather,\ndemocracy always remains aporias in its structure--aporias\nof uncertainty and mismatches between language and its\nmeaning. In other words, the democracy we experience is not\nyet democracy at all because it exists as a futuristic \"future\"\nhope relating from desire in the present. No fixed meaning is\npossible due to democracy's apophatic characteristics.\nSimilar to the elaboration on democracy yet to come, Derrida\nimagines the ontological meaning of community without\nclosing its \"is-ness\" within a fixed format. Thus, community\nwithout community imagines a community yet to come with-\nout normalizing it within the existing community (Derrida,\n1997). As democracy exists only by differing its meaning\nfrom a universalized definition of it, so does community in a\nstructure that community itself is kept open \"to the yet to\nIndeed, community without community is paradoxical\nand confusing. How can a community exist if it does not pre-\nsume its essential existence? In what ways does a community\npossibly exist, if any, when ontological negativism precludes\nthe being of community? Despite this ontological paradox, I\nelaborate upon this concept as a means to examine \"open\"\nspaces for creating community with unimagined possibili-\nties. I interpret taken-for-granted-ness about community and\ncitizens'roles in the community while reflecting on the ARtS\nactivities. What are the epistemology and practical implica-\ntions of community without community in current multicul-\ntural discourses? This question originates from ontological\nconcerns about current practice in mainstream multicultural-\nism drawn from establishing collective solidarity and nor-\nmalizing identity within the predetermined community. A\ncultural group cohesively advocates for its political rights,\nyet it ostracizes the \"other\" within the group that does not\nfollow a set of existing social norms. Butler (1999), for\nexample, argues that a universalized concept of \"women\"\nexcludes women of color, the lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans-\ngender, and questioning (LGBTQ) community, and those\nexperiencing ability issues. In this article, I offer two salient\nlearning moments that emerged throughout my data analysis\nin articulating counternarratives about community. Drawing\nfrom children's activities, I theorize the meanings of com-\nmunity without community that emerged from the ARtS ini-\ntiative and outline the resultant implications promoting the\npositive advancement of multicultural education discourses.\nMethodology\nThis current article is part of a larger, funded project to exam-\nine children's understanding of active citizenship and com-\nmunity through the use of art. The ARtS initiative supports\nexisting learning communities that place an emphasis on art-\nbased inquiry and the aesthetic experience through an after-\nliving in underrepresented communities in the United States\nparticipated in poetry, dance, and clay art classes. In 2014-\n2015, 20 fourth to sixth graders continued their participation\nin this initiative. We implemented the same program in three\ninstances over the 2 years. Painting was substituted for the\ndance component during the second year of implementation.\nThe participants in this initiative were from two elementary\nschools: 100% of the school population from Freedom\nElementary School received reduced/free lunch rates and\n84% of the school population were students of color; 98% of\nthe school population from Independent Elementary School\nreceived free/reduced lunch rates and 52% of the school pop-\nulation were students of color. University professors, teach-\ners from urban schools, and local artists collaborated to\ndesign an innovative afterschool curriculum that explored\nactive citizenship and children's participation in a commu-\nnity. Table 1 indicates cultural backgrounds and major roles\nof teaching artists, teachers, and professors during the ARtS\ninitiative.\nThe ARtS initiative was a 9-week afterschool program\nand Thursday). Each art genre was covered during a 3-week\nperiod. A total of 18 sessions were provided for children, and\nthe program concluded with a gallery night to display chil-\ndren's artwork and to celebrate their achievement with the\ncommunity members. In addition, clay artists, poets, paint-\ners, and a dancer participated in 6-hr professional develop-\nment for the ARtS initiatives and collaboratively developed\na curriculum with the support of classroom teachers and uni-\nversity professors.\nData Sources and Analysis\nThe implementation of the ARtS initiative was completed in\nJune 2015. The project team transcribed the whole class dis-\ntranscripts for poetry, clay art, and dance classes comprised\nticipated in a 1-hr interview during the program in order to\nreflect on their teaching and children's engagement with the\nproject. As a project director, I developed and conducted\nTable 1.

They were audio-taped and\nfully transcribed (60 pages). We also videotaped the gallery\nnight event in April 2014, an activity that ran for approxi-\nmately 2.5 hr. The data sources included the class discus-\nsions, student artifacts, semistructured teacher and artist\ninterviews, and videos from the gallery night and class\nactivities.\nHighly influenced by poststructuralist theories, I gener-\nally do not follow a linear approach to analyze qualitative\ndata: generating themes, testing emerging hypothesis,\nsearching for alternative explanations, and then writing a\nreport (Marshall & Rossman, 2006). Informed by Wolcott's\n(2008) qualitative research analytic tools, I instead describe,\nanalyze, and interpret research participants' discussions,\nartifacts, and interview data. With this project, I first ana-\nlyzed the written and visual texts that contained the chil-\ndren's experiences during the ARtS initiative. Reviewing\nchildren's lived experience formed the core of this analysis.\nThe frames of investigation included examining children's\nexperiences when the activities focused on the notions of\ncommunity and active citizenship. I inquired about the\nnature of the meanings created and interpreted by children\nduring the activities.\nIn addition to noting Wolcott's guidance for the data anal-\nysis, I partially adopted research strategies developed by\nCorbin and Strauss (2015). I categorized the data, applying\ncoding procedures in order to examine salient themes regard-\ning children's understanding of active citizenship and com-\nmunity (Corbin & Strauss, 2015). The children's artifacts\nrepresented the major portion of the analysis, which focused\non their interpretation of these important concepts. Rather\nthan reference coherent emerging themes to describe what\nhappened in these children's conceptualization of active citi-\nzenship and community, I examined the ways in which data\nsources are discursively generated within a specific sociopo-\nlitical, economic, and historical context, especially during\nthis afterschool program (Foucault, 1978). I investigated\nhow power operated, both in data representation and\nmy interpretation about data. This approach pushed the\nboundaries of not only \"what is included\" but also \"what is\nnot included\" in children's and educators' narratives.\nFurthermore, I asked myself in what ways were the ARtS\nchildren required to represent their learning and artifacts as\npart of their afterschool program. Some children were adept\nat \"pleasing\" educators by sharing knowledge that the educa-\ntors expected to hear, including positive elements focused on\ncommunity and personal actions that would change a com-\nmunity. Pitt and Britzman (2003) write, \"[w]hile a narrative\nis made from a specific context, the affective force of what\nprecisely is represented in narrative may derive from other\nscenes and from unresolved psychical conflicts\" (p. 759). By\naccepting Pitt and Britzman's methodological concerns, I\nacknowledged the possibility of psychological conflicts that\nthe ARtS children might experience throughout the after-\nschool program and data analysis.\nDuring the data analysis, I coded initial concepts that the\nchildren used to share their ideas about active citizenship and\ncommunity. Coding (Corbin & Strauss, 2015) and \"thematic\nanalysis\" (Riessmann, 2008) of brief, bound segments of\nchildren's artifacts, discussion notes, and interview data\nwere sources necessary to review data and to organize famil-\niar unfamiliar data. Delineated concepts encompassed (a)\nchildren's notions of active citizenship, (b) understanding of\ncommunity, (c) urgent issues in the community, and (d)\nactions that children take. Table 2 shows major themes gen-\nerated through data analysis.\nAmong these four major themes of (a) children's meta-\nphors of active citizenship and community, (b) understand-\ning of community, (c) urgent issues in the community, and\n(d) actions that children take, this article mainly focuses on\nthe second theme, \"understanding of community.\" This\ntheme demonstrates the complexity of community dis-\ncussed by children and educators. I selected the stories and\nexamples narrating the issue of \"community\" from multi-\nple perspectives. Grounded in the narratives, I include\nmore discussion of the theory, outcomes, and my reflec-\ntions on the children's lived experiences in their own com-\nmunities and actual class discussions about the issue of\ncommunity. During the data analysis process, I recognized\nmy subjectivity embedded in categorizing salient themes. I\nchallenged myself during the data analysis in order to\nrethink any foregone conclusions about the \"proper\" or\n\"romantic\" way of understanding community and teaching\nthis concept to children. I narrated children's engagement\nand/or disengagement with community, anchored in the\nconceptual framework of community without community.\nThus, I analyzed and represented two vignettes of rethink-\ning community highlighted during the ARtS activities: (a)\ncommunity of interrelationality and (b) multiplicities of\ncommunity.\nTwo vignettes represent the ways in which children dis-\nmantle preexisting notions of citizenship and active citizen-\nship,drawingfromcreativeideasandtheirownunderstanding\nof community. Many potentially meaningful discourses were\nalso generated during the project regarding leadership, loss\nand mourning, and collaboration with the community.\nParalleled with class engagement in the process of data anal-\nysis, I focused on two vignettes which provided circum-\nstances that aided both the production and the interpretation\nof ethnographic and narrative data (Riessmann, 2008). All\nthe names appearing in this article are pseudonyms, and I\nalso collected informed consents from children's parents/\nguardians and from all adults. Overall, by examining chil-\ndren's very specific learning moments to imagine different\napproaches to community, this article examines the ways in\nwhich children develop their views on active citizenship and\ncommunity. In the next section, I describe and analyze two\nsalient teaching-learning moments during which children\nwere active in learning and demonstrated their concepts of\nactive citizenship and community.\nVignettes of Rethinking Community 1:\nCommunity of Interrelationality\nThe ARtS team discussed the importance of community\nleadership by introducing citizenship and civic engagement\nin a community. Dance activities played major roles in artic-\nulating leadership and community. Most discussions during\nthe activity reiterated a conventional approach to leadership:\nthat is, a leader has a vision and community members follow\nhis or her guidance, although conventionally people high-\nlight \"shared\" leadership for those decisions that involve dis-\ntribution or allocation of resources. Unexpectedly, an\ninteresting conversation emerged during the leader\u00adfollower\nactivity and the subsequent shared reflection. The ARtS chil-\ndren and the team examined a complicated meaning of\nleader\u00adfollower during the activity. We challenged the\nleader\u00adfollower relationship as a predetermined concept\nwhen understanding different roles in a community. Below is\na brief overview of the activity.\nAngie, the dancer, grouped children in pairs and told them\nto decide who would lead movement. Then, the \"leader\"\nstarted gestures describing what leadership in a community\nwould look like. The basic rule was to be quiet when each\nperson initiated and the other person followed the gestures.\nAfter listening to this guidance, the two children in each group\nlooked at each other and one child slowly initiated a gesture\nand the partner followed the movement. Each child took turns\nto invent and follow the movements. After the activity, the\nchildren and teachers exchanged their reflections, an exercise\nthat exposed the children to a different version of leadership\u00ad\nfollowership. Having indicated the leader and the follower in\neach group, Peggy, a classroom teacher, reported what chil-\ndren in her group shared concerning an outstanding insight\nabout the leader\u00adfollower relationship. A child in her group\ndiscussed the notion that no leader existed in this activity.\nMs. Angie: The leaders! Did you guys notice if you move\ntoo fast then the person who's following steps behind?\nMs. Peggy: They told us there's no leader . . . It is hysteri-\ncal because we learn together where we're going . . .\nIt's actually a lot of fun where you stand and no one is\nleading. You do it as a group. You feel like you're con-\nnecting with the person standing in front of you.\nMs. Angie: I see. Did you hear what Ms. Peggy said?\nWhen you really get to do this, and you're really doing\nit correctly, and the signal is so clear: There is no leader\nany more. You give up control to be part of a group . .\n. When it works really well, you can't tell who the\nleader is . . . because if the follower doesn't follow, the\nleader stops leading, and then the leader starts follow-\ning the person.\nEva: When I was doing this . . . I felt like I knew what she\nwas going to do next . . . so I was like, following she\nwas doing something next.\nTable 2. Open and Axial Coding and Themes.\nMajor themes Codes Examples\nActive citizenship and\ncommunity metaphors\nTwo people dance together; heart-to-\nheart communication; a service dog; a\nweb; compassion; confidence; a flower;\na tree; mood rings; nutrition; a puzzle;\nshout-out; solidarity; Summer School;\nwind chimes; a rainbow\n\"There are different types of citizenship.

There are broken mood rings\nbecause there are people who have no money but the pink\nmood ring can help if people love to show love to others. When\nyou are angry, you can help, calm them down and make them\nhappy\" (fifth grader).\nUnderstanding of\ncommunity\nSafe environment; unsafe community;\nleader's roles; autonomous roles\nMs. Foster (teacher): \"For me community is a safe place where\nyou feel safe, where you can take risks, all of these other things\ntoo, but in addition, like a place where you feel comfortable.\"\nAngel (fifth grader): \"What if your community is not safe?\"\nUrgent issues in\ncommunity\nBullying issues; cyberbullying; lack of\npolice; gun violence; racial tensions at\nschool; the myth of meritocracy\n\"[The bully] was kind of racist like, `You shouldn't be going to this\nschool any more.

And the White people and the Black people\nhave the same freedom'\" (fifth grader).\nActions for the\ncommunity\nRequesting more police; supporting\nfriends, helping each other; celebrating\ndifferences; openness to others;\nstanding up for yourself and others;\nsolving problems together; taking a risk\n\"Sometimes when you're being an active citizen, you may be\nstanding up for something or helping in a way where it's the\nminority, and not the majority . . . Were there some good things\nabout being an active citizen? But then there can be some things\nthat might be a little bit scary or even seems challenging\" (a\npoet).\n6 SAGE Open\nThe above conversation among the dancer, classroom\nteacher, and a student illustrates the blurred boundaries that\nexist between leader\u00adfollower while taking actions and fol-\nlowing directions. While a space exists between these con-\ncepts, the division between leader and follower is conflated\nthrough taking actions and achieving close connectivity\nbetween the \"two\" parties. No leader exists without the fol-\nlower, and vice versa. Even the border between leader and\nfollower disappears when the leader does not have to con-\ntrol the others out of self-interest. This leader\u00adfollower\nmovement provided the insight that the bifurcation or hier-\narchy of leader\u00adfollower is irrelevant when each person\nfeels connected. No control is necessary when two suppos-\nedly different parties merge as one. As Angie indicated, this\nis the point when the leader stops leading, yet continues to\ncollaborate with other people. Shared leadership goes\nbeyond distributing different leadership roles in the com-\nmunity. Rather, the community members consider the\nimportance of active collaboration without requiring con-\ntrol, guaranteeing that no vertical hierarchy exists in creat-\ning a supportive community.\nVignettes of Rethinking Community 2:\nMultiplicities of Community\nDuring the ARtS initiative, the team learned that it was of\nbenefit to children to address the safety issues of living in a\nchallenging community. Most of the class discussions\nfocused on maintaining a safe community by illustrating the\npositive aspects of sustaining a caring, safe, and healthy\ncommunity. The grand narrative during the activity seemed\nto support an equity-oriented, multicultural curriculum that\nencourages children to enhance their critical consciousness\nfor addressing injustices and inequities in their community\n(Murray & Milner, 2015).Although I valued awakening chil-\ndren's consciousness toward social inequity and safety, I\nhoped to encourage children to think beyond a romanticized\nnotion of community, such as simply \"helping each other\" or\n\"keeping our community health.\" The poetry class provided\nstudents with a seminal moment in which to examine the\nspace between safe and unsafe while acknowledging the vio-\nlence and danger existing within their own community.\nChildren were realistic about violence and safety issues in\ntheir community, and the team used this aesthetic-inspired\nafterschool curriculum to discuss these issues within a safe,\nsupportive environment.\nDuring the poetry activities, the ARtS team maximized\nthe brainstorming process by having children imagine mul-\ntiple metaphors for representing active citizenship. Children\nwrote poetry and shared their ideas about community and\nactive citizenship. They used magazines to imagine and\nvisually express what active citizenship looks like in a\ncollage format, before completing an individual poem for\nthe gallery night. On Day 1 of the poetry activity, a poet\ninvited children to share what images they visualized when\npondering the concept of community. The poetry teacher\nencouraged children to start from a notion of friendship as\nthe beginning of the deeper conversation on community. A\npoet and classroom teacher, Chris, used the following\nexample: \"I usually think of friendship as two halves of a\nwhole. So, sometimes I think about twins, or conjoining\npeople . . . I just see friendship as being connected.\"\nChildren designed their name tags by using the images of a\nheart, a tree, a dog, a puzzle, a rainbow, and other objects to\ndisplay their notions of friendship.\nCreating a name tag was an opening exercise in order to\npractice metaphors in representing community with the use\nof poetry. Children were asked to interpret their chosen\nimage of friendship and specifically describe how it concep-\ntualized their notions of community. Tim, for example, con-\nnected the image of a tree and its leaves with citizens,\nexplaining that the leaves are like active members in a com-\nmunity. Another fourth grader, Keith, also used a tree meta-\nphor to emphasize that friendship which lasts forever is\nreminiscent of an evergreen tree. After the name tag activity,\nthe team asked the children to think about the core question:\n\"What does community mean to me?\" Below is a brief\nexcerpt from the class discussion:\nMs. Foster (a poetry teacher): What is the definition of\ncommunity to you?\nDaniella: Like a bunch of people come together to make a\nbig town . . .\nIsabelle: A community to me is like when people are\nworking together and actually making something.\nMs. Foster: Anybody else? For me community is a safe\nplace where you feel safe, where you can take risks, all\nof these other things too, but in addition, like a place\nwhere you feel comfortable.\nDuring the ARtS initiative, the team had time to share the\nidea of creating a much safer community in both schools\nand neighborhoods. While discussing the notion of commu-\nnity, educators have a tendency to imagine a romantic com-\nmunity that emphasizes collaboration and a supportive\nenvironment. However, the direction was shifted when\nAngel, a fifth grader, raised the issue of an \"unsafe\" envi-\nronment in her neighborhood.\nAngel: What if your community is not safe?\nMs. Foster: What if your community is not safe . . .\nDr. Letters (a professor): That is a great question. What if\nyour community is not safe?\nAngel: I have experience, I got chased by pit bulls.\nIsabelle: Somebody shot a house.\nMs. Foster: In your community?\nIsabelle: Yeah, it was my house, then another house, then\nit was the street lamp near the house.\nMs. Foster: Some people shot at it?\nIsabelle: Yeah, it's pretty dangerous.\nDannie: And what else you could do is that if there was\nsomething dangerous like a fire, you could call the\nIsabelle: And then you would help your community . . .\nMs. Foster: So, there are lots of people that can help out in\na community too when a community isn't necessarily\nsafe, right?\nThe ARtS children delved into the multiple aspects of\ncommunity through the various activities. Children raised\ntheir concerns about their own neighborhood's experience of\nviolence, safety, and lack of police presence. Angel's real\nconcern about the \"unsafe\" community made the conversa-\ntion multifaceted and authentic. Her question \"what if our\ncommunity is not safe?\" was supported by the poet and the\nprofessor, who shifted the class discussion to explore safety\nissues in the children's own communities.\nAs the poetry activities continued, the ARtS children\nshared their experiences of their school community, which\nincluded a cyberbullying issue. Included below is the tran-\nscript of the part of the class discussion when children\ndescribed taking a risk in their community and its costs in\norder to sustain a healthy community:\nJoan: Like this year, there was a situation like cyber-bully-\ning in our classroom. I was included like a suspect and\nthree other people were suspects. It was like a cyber-\nbullying on Facebook.Anthony [pseudonym] was cyber-\nbullying about [racism] . . . He was going to be telling\nabout us . . . , \"You shouldn't be going to this school any\nmore. This is only for the White and Black\" . . . [Oh . . .]\nand we [Hispanics] were like, \"We have this freedom,\ntoo. If you have read history books, you should have\nknown that Hispanics have freedom, too. And the White\npeople and the Black people have the same freedom.\"\nDr. Letters: Everybody has the equal right, no matter what\nskin color you have.\nBeth: I can't stand, when people get judged, because\nthey're White or they're Black, or like it doesn't really\nmatter if you're White or Black. Sometimes kids get\njudged because they don't have a phone, or their par-\nents don't have much money, or they don't have a\nFacebook [page] . . .\nDr. Letters: I wonder what we can do, when so many bad\nthings happen in our community.\nDaniella: Yeah, I was related to when people are cyber-\nbullied. When someone gets bullied right in front of\nyou, some people you just don't want to listen because\nyou feel like bad about not wanting to leave anybody\nwho is still getting bullied . . .\nAddressing the bullying particularly cyberbullying is cru-\ncial in order to gauge children's experience in schools and\nthe community. The poet, Foster, connects this issue with the\ndiscussion of active citizenship and our action plans for\ncreating a safe environment. When the idea of community\nbecomes vague and idealistic, as in \"a place where citizens\nfeel comfortable,\" it is important to explore the subtle border\nbetween safe and unsafe, just as Angel did when she shared\nher daily experiences in her own community. Angel wanted\nto explore how her community is neither absolutely safe nor\nunsafe. Rather, the community is a space and place where\nAngel and other children endeavor every day to feel at ease.\nSimilarly, as the above brief conversation indicates, cyber-\nbullying becomes an urgent issue for children when such\nbullying is racially motivated in a racially and ethnically\ndiverse community. Using media input and actual conversa-\ntions in schools, children can politically and discursively\nconstruct their personal understandings of what it means to\ninhabit a liminal space that is both safe and unsafe.\nAngel's curiosity, Joan's concern with cyberbullying, and\nthe ARtS team's elaboration on the safety issue provided an\nopportunity to review the meaning of community without\ncommunity. The poetry activity followed by sharing chil-\ndren's ideas became a launching pad for the children to chal-\nlenge a normalized approach to safe\u00adunsafe community,\nwhich has been particularly assigned to them by mainstream\nmedia using the term \"urban\" school to assuage fear of living\nwithin a city. The term of \"urban school,\" thus, is normalized\nby applying a populational reasoning to associate \"urban\"\nwith an unsafe and dangerous community (Popkewitz, 1998).\nThe idea of community without community avoids such ste-\nreotypical understanding about community. For example, the\nARtS team challenges the normalized understanding of\n\"urban\" community with the use of the safe\u00adunsafe dichot-\nomy. Multicultural educators encounter a plethora of issues\nwhen attempting to promote social justice and deal with\nsafety issues in the community. While working on these\nsocial justice issues, I argue that they should challenge any\nnormalized understanding of \"urban\" that reinforces nega-\ntive stereotypical images about children living in an under-\nresourced community. At the same time, educators should\nconsider creating an emotionally, intellectually, and spiritu-\nally \"safe\" environment when articulating the notion of com-\nmunity and active citizenship within the community. Drawing\nfrom the notion of community without community, I argue\nfor creating an in-between space of safety\u00adunsafety that\nchallenges a generalized understanding of an urban area as\nan \"unsafe\" place. In-between is the space where children\nactually imagine a different aspect of community, both over-\ncoming a negative image about \"urban\" community and rec-\nognizing the multiplicity of community as an ongoing\nprocess of creating a healthier environment.\nCommunity Without Community:\nWhere Our Conversation Is to Come\nReflecting on children's counternarratives, I further develop\nthe notion of community without community. Rather than\npursue the right answer, this community without community\n8 SAGE Open\naims to invoke more questions about the purpose of collabo-\nration, the practice of democratic values, and pursuit of\neducation advancement. Most notably, I emphasize the inter-\nrelationality of self\u00adother and the multiplicities of commu-\nnity in theorizing about community without community.\nI introduced Derrida's notion of community without com-\nmunity as a theoretical foregrounding for this article. I elabo-\nrate on this notion by drawing from other philosophers and\ndiscourse concerning politics. For example, in his book The\nInoperative Community, Nancy (1991) articulates the notion\nof community without community, clearly highly influenced\nby Derrida's ideas. He states,\nCommunity without community is to come, in the sense that it is\nalways coming, endlessly, at the heart of every collectivity . . . It\nis no more than this: to come to the limit of compearance, to that\nlimit to which we are in effect convoked, called, and sent . . . Its\nessence is composed only in the act that interrupts, with a single\nstroke--by an incision and/or an inscription--the shaping of the\nscene of myth (pp. 71-72, emphasis in original).\nIn this excerpt, Nancy (1991) underscores that commu-\nnity does not exist in the predetermined form of a common\nbeing. Rather, community exists as a provisionary form--a\nform that resides \"at the limit of the other\" where the subjects\npivot over one another (p. 76). Drawing from Derridian con-\ncepts, Nancy eloquently articulates this provisional and dif-\nf\u00e9rance aspect of community. He said, \"we communicate to\neach other not the meaning of community, but an infinite\nreserve of common and singular meanings\" (p. 79, emphasis\nin original). Community is important not because we create\nsolidarity within the community but because of its eternal\nopenness through not creating a universal agreement. This\nopen-ended, provisional element of community opens up\ndiscussion about subjectivity within the group. Like Nancy, I\nchallenge the danger of universalized solidarity and public\nuniting that highlights collective, monolithic identity without\nconsidering the multiplicity of community and community\nmembers. While underscoring community as a \"common\"\nentity, multicultural educators have a tendency to close the\npossibility to imagine multiple meanings of community and\nthus limit political actions responding to diverse needs within\nthe community.\nNancy's argument about community is often cited by\nother theorists, including Devadas and Mummery. In their\narticle \"Community Without Community,\" Devadas and\nMummery (2007) provide an overview of this concept,\nmainly drawing from Nancy. They argue that traditional\nunderstanding of community, which is a romanticized view\nof community, \"reproduces a collectivity that is built upon,\nengenders and fosters a sense of closure, continuity, unity\nand universalism\" (p. 1). In the critical theory tradition, soli-\ndarity among the \"underprivileged\" is considered to be a pre-\nrequisite in the fight against social injustice toward the\n\"oppressed\" group. Devadas and Mummery explicate the\npotential violence of an exclusionary community, borrowing\nfrom Nancy's notion of community without unity. An exclu-\nsion/inclusion version of community normalizes its citizen-\nship and ostracizes a community member who does not\nfollow such a set of social norms. They reject a community\nwith exclusionary solidarity, yet propose \"an alternative con-\ncept of community that produces new constitutions and net-\nworks of relationships that are not hinged upon predisposed\nnotions of community and identity\" (p. 2). Now new ques-\ntions emerge regarding this ontological confusion. How can\nthe community without essence (the community that is nei-\nther \"people\" nor \"nation,\" . . . etc.) be presented as such?\nThat is, what might the politics be that does not stem from\nthe will to realize this essence? These questions are crucial\nstarting points from which to rethink humanistic, enlighten-\nment versions of identity and community.\nOther philosophers and educators have participated in\nsimilar epistemological approaches to articulate community\nfrom multiple angles. By using the concepts of \"community\nwithout consensus\" and \"community with dissensus,\" Miller\ntiplicity of community and the impossibility of creating a uni-\nversalized community. Drawing from a feminist,\npoststructuralist tradition, Miller argues for a community that\n\"possibly enables representations of self, other, and the [edu-\ncational] field to be unfixed, mobilized, destabilized, and\nreleased as forces capable of recombining in as yet unimag-\nined and perhaps untraceable ways\" (Miller, 2010, pp.\n99-100). Communities without consensus are always in-the-\nmaking, where any boundaries are reconceived as contingent\nand yet intricately intertwined (Miller, 2010). When the soli-\ndarity of stable, collective community is mainly highlighted\nin the discussion of equity and diversity, Miller and other\npoststructuralists endeavor to minimize any normalized vio-\nlence by universalizing cultural identity in a collective man-\nner and ignoring the multiplicity of identities that constitute a\ncommunity member. Similarly, in his article \"The Thinking\nof Dissensus: Politics and Aesthetics,\" Ranci\u00e8re (2011) con-\nceptualizes \"dissensus\" as political, aesthetic discourse.\nNamely, politics cannot be reduced to a collective, essential-\nized version of community. \"Community with dissensus\" cre-\nates a space for making \"a difference within the same, a\nsameness of the opposite\" (p. 1). Similarly, Gere (2012) uti-\nlizes the notion of community without community by high-\nlighting a new community and relationality brought in by\ntechnology of the digital age. In his book Community Without\nCommunity in Digital Culture, Gere paradoxically under-\nscores the situation that technologies \"effect non-relation-\nships, and non-communities, community without community\"\n(p. 1). This idea dismisses an overarching, grand framework\nthat connects community members. Gere's argument is con-\nsistent with my articulation of community without commu-\nnity, although I do not apply it to digital technology, per se.\nBy subscribing to these notions of community without\nconsensus and community with dissensus, I theorize\ncommunities without communities as those in which multi-\ncultural educators challenge universalized \"solidarity\" in\norder to open up in-between spaces for imagining \"unex-\nplored\" possibilities about self, other, and the community.\nMy support of a \"just\" community stems from recognizing\nthe value of community without community in that it gener-\nously emphasizes the multiplicities of community and\ndiverse voices within a given community without bias. The\n\"emancipation\" project from mainstream multiculturalism\nunintentionally and unconsciously creates exclusivism in the\npursuit of social justice. Group solidarity, ironically, gener-\nates exclusionism of community, although such collective-\nness is a prerequisite for taking actions. Yet I argue that blind\nsolidarity is problematic in that it normalizes membership\nand belonging. Furthermore, the absolute duty of a citizen is\nto inflict violence upon the \"Other\"--which causes unethical\nconsequences in terms of fairness and justice. Because of\nthis potential problem of solidarity, poststructuralist theories\npay attention to subject construction as the effect of political,\nactive interactions among people. This new idea about inter-\nrelationality further encourages us to imagine community\nthat goes beyond, \"already constituted communities, already\nlogical groundings invite us to rethink the concepts of \"closed\ncommunity\" and \"solidarity in the pursuit of justice\" and the\ncreation of a new community.\nThe two themes articulated in this article indicate the pos-\nsibility of exploring \"openness\" in a community in which\nany binary opposition is not sufficient to fight against social\ninjustice and create a \"safe\" community. The leader\u00adfollower\nactivity shows the ways in which children rethink the bifur-\ncated notion of leader\u00adfollower. The blurred division\nbetween the leader\u00adfollower in the activity emphasizes that\nroles and responsibilities are operated by a power operation\noccurring between the leader\u00adfollower. No singular, univer-\nsal, or agreed-upon notions of selves, collectivity, or solidar-\nity exist. Nor does stable subjectivity exist before the subjects\ninteract with each other; instead, the self\u00adother or leader\u00ad\nfollower relation is linguistically and materially constructed\nwithin the proximity of self and other where power operates\nthrough multiple directions, depending on a very specific\nsociopolitical context (Todd, 2009). This structure is not pre-\ndetermined but it is constantly evolving, depending on spe-\ncific circumstances of the community. No dichotomous\nunderstanding is possible in understanding self\u00adother or\nleader\u00adfollower.\nSimilarly,Angel's crucial concern \"what if our community\nis not safe?\" initiated an important issue in sustaining a \"safe\"\nenvironment in an urban context while minimizing any ste-\nreotypical images discursively generated by urban/suburban\nand unsafe/safe dichotomies. Community without commu-\nnity requests examine the power operation in articulating\nsuch division and imagine the subjectivity and community\nfrom these in-between spaces that cannot be essentialized\nor normalized with the use of any dichotomous terms. By\nraising the concept of community without community, I\nargue for creating an open space of \"safe\" community where\neducators challenge existing normalized practice of urban\neducation, particularly informed by this \"unsafe\" rhetoric.\nCommunity without community is theoretically and peda-\ngogically in-the-making by highlighting interrelationality\namong the subjects rather than imposing existing, normalized\nunderstandings of \"urban\" community upon them. Overall,\nthe notion of community without community is a sociopoliti-\ncal and discursive endeavor that can be used to create an\nemotionally, intellectually, and spiritually \"safe\" environment\nand encourage children to imagine an \"open\" space while\nlooking beyond any closed space (Greene, 1995).\nToward Community Without\nCommunity and Social Transformation\nAccording to critical ethnography tradition, making the dis-\ntinction between the \"haves and have nots\" or \"leader and\nfollower\" is imperative in order to combat social injustice in\na racialized, classed, gendered, abled, and sexualized society.\nThe rhetoric of emancipation argues that power should be\nshared within a community and that shared leadership is a\nmeaningful democratic practice in decision making. In con-\nceptualizing the open-ness of community without commu-\nnity, Butler's (2009) challenge to current multiculturalism\ndiscourse is pertinent. Central to Butler's theory of recogni-\ntion is the claim that war and globalization construct a dif-\nferential apprehension and recognition of life. She calls for\ninterrogating the \"frames\" of recognition as an urgent task:\n\"The problem is not merely how to include more people\nwithin existing norms, but to consider how existing norms\nallocate recognition differentially\" (p. 6). What to put \"in\" or\n\"outside\" the frame is not the major concern. Rather, what\nmatters is to investigate a very specific frame in order to\nmake visible the rationale for recognizing a subject as griev-\nable or not, although the subject lost his or her life (Butler,\n2009). She also emphasizes analyzing social norms because\nsubjects are discursively constructed within and through a\nset of social norms. Butler (2015) conceptualizes the notion\nof \"subject\" from a different ontology. No subject exists with\na free will without actual interactions with others. It is inter-\nrelationality among subjects that constructs self and other. In\nher book Senses of the Subject, Butler (2015) argues,\nI do not arrive in the world separate from a set of norms that are\nlying in wait for me, already orchestrating my gender, race, and\nstatus, working on me, even as a pure potential, prior to my first\nwail. So norms, conventions, institutional forms of power, are\nalready acting prior to any action I may undertake, prior to there\nbeing an \"I\" who thinks of itself from time to time as the seat or\nsource of our actions (p. 6).\nAccording to Butler, identity is not the collection of an\nautonomous individual's choice and conscious performance\nin front of other people. Rather, Butler highlights a set of\nsocial norms that constructs the subject by reiterating such\nnorms constantly. The subject is not an agent with free will;\nrather, power-knowledge operating within a community dis-\ncursively constructs gender identity. Similar to Butler, Todd\n(2009) challenges existing understanding about cultural self\nand other without considering the discursive interactions\namong the subjects and its consequences for the subjectivity\nconstruction. Drawing from Levinas's notion of human and\nhumanity, Todd theorizes humanity that occurs as the conse-\nquence of interactions. Humanity is not a predetermined\nideal or a virtue of a shared value in humanity. Rather,\nhumanity is \"located in the proximity where self and other\nmeet\" impacted by the threat of violence (p. 19). Exploring\nthe power operation between self and other as well as the\nexplication of specific sociopolitical, economic contexts\nbecomes the crucial point for understanding supposedly dif-\nferent roles and power structures in a community. According\nthe subjects construct the very meaning of self\u00adother, rather\nthan imposing predetermined meanings on cultural sameness\nand difference.\nUsing feminist politics as an example, Butler (1999) asks,\n\"To what extent does the effort to locate a common identity\nas the foundation for a feminist politics preclude a radical\ninquiry into the political construction and regulation of iden-\ntity itself?\" (p. xxxii). In this context, Butler is concerned\nwith how feminist politics based on heterosexual normalcy\nhinders an open-ended search for a \"politics of recognition\"\ncitizens are recognized as equal to all others. Butler (2004)\ncontinues to challenge the single epistemological approach\nto gender that predominantly exists in identity politics,\nincluding an emphasis on \"women's ways\" of knowing,\nthinking, or behaving. She argues that these notions of\nwomen are already \"orchestrated by power precisely at that\nmoment in which the terms of `acceptable'categorization are\ninstituted\" (p. 215). In other words, the very ideas of wom-\nen's ways of knowing, thinking, or behaving are constructed\nby power and historical discourses.\nnormalized version of identity politics, I revisit the commu-\nnal effort to universalize collective cultural identity, or what\nEducators mainly influenced by identity politics assume\nseamless \"we-ness\" among a specific cultural group (e.g.,\nethnicity/race, gender, and class) before considering its dis-\ncursive and political constructions of identities (Moon,\n2011). Community without community encourages multicul-\ntural educators to examine the ways in which such concepts\nas race, gender, or class are discursively circulated, repro-\nduced, and changed with/in specific sociopolitical, cultural,\neconomic, and historical contexts. The point is that educators\nneed to explicate the ways in which such identity categories\nare discursively naturalized within a community. I challenge\nthe coherence of the categories, or collective \"we-ness\" of a\ncommunity with unanimous voice, in order to minimize any\nnormalization of people. The recognition of diverse voices\nwithin a community is a project of creating new vocabulary\nto specifically articulate what we mean by \"we\" in fighting\nThe ARtS Community Without\nCommunity: Questions for Further\nInquiry\nI utilized the concept of community without community as a\nmeans to rethink a potential problem of solidarity in defining\n\"normative\" community without considering the \"Other\"\nwithin the community. A normative version of community\nreproduces \"violence\" that applies the binary of \"us and them\"\nif the subject does not reiterate norms given to him or her.\nRather than confining identity within normative categories, I\nargue for community without community that underscores the\ninterrelationality of self\u00adother in considering cultural identity\nand its construction within a sociopolitical context. The learn-\ning moments illustrated in this article addressed the complex-\nity of leader\u00adfollower and safe\u00adunsafe issues.\nI raise questions about the notions of community, solidar-\nity, and collective identity in order to explore multiple aspects\nof community and active citizenship within the community. I\nexplicate children's rethinking about their community draw-\ning from their experience. There is no taken-for-grantedness\nin this learning and experimental space: Children revisit,\nrethink, and always reconsider their habitual ways of think-\ning about a community and their roles in the community.\nRather than affirming community with solidarity, commu-\nnity without community challenges the current practices in\nmulticulturalism--multiculturalism that normalizes cultural\nidentity with the use of collective \"we\"-ness and provides\nlittle space for examining a specific sociocultural, political,\nand economic context in subjectivity construction. The labels\nof \"marginalized,\" \"at-risk,\" or \"underrepresented\" are polit-\nical, strategic terms to fight against social oppressions recur-\nring historically toward people of color, women, and the\npoor. Yet the request to think of the ARtS initiative as a\n\"community without community\" shifts the major discourse\nin multicultural education. It challenges the reproduction of\nstereotypical images of a community by investigating power\noperations which construct the self\u00adother relationship.\nThus, community without community invites multicul-\ntural educators to investigate the complexities of identities\nthat move beyond highlighting the essence of cultural differ-\ninvitation can lead multicultural educators toward a di777f-\nferent way of looking at and thinking about racial/ethnic\nidentity and racism more broadly than would result from\nexploring social inequity based on the simple binary of\noppressor/oppressed, male/female, and us/them. As the ARtS\ninitiative implies through multiple constructions about self\u00ad\nother, I argue for creating and sustaining diverse epistemolo-\ngies in order to release children's imagination for the\npurposes of social transformation (Greene, 1995). Most\nnotably, the notion of community without community could\nallow for the possibility of reconceptualizing existing com-\nmunities and their vision for promoting justice in education\nby minimizing any normalized practices for children \"at\nrisk\" or \"underprivileged\" communities.\n"
