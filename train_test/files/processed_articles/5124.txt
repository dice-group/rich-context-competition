A qualitative case study method was used to investigate\nthe questions, which used in-depth interviews with teachers, classroom observation, and postobservation discussion with\nthe teachers, as main data collection tools.The key findings of the study allude to a huge gap between what is intended in the\nNational Curriculum in terms of students' learning in chemistry and what actually happens in the classroom where students\nlearn chemistry. Promoting in-depth learning appeared to be an uphill task for the teachers.The main hurdle lies in students'\ninability to demonstrate a good understanding of very basic concepts of the subject. Despite faced with such a challenge, the\nteachers appear to be committed to teaching their subject.The implications of the results of the study are explained in the\ncontext of schools,teachers,and other educational stakeholders by emphasizing the need for synchronization and integration\nof efforts on the part of schools.\n",

It\nforms parts of Pakistan's international borders with China to\nthe northeast, Afghanistan to the northwest, and Indian- and\nPakistan-administered Kashmir to the southeast.\nIn the last census (1998), the population of Gilgit-Baltistan\n2.8% and, according to a recent estimation, the population\nhas approached 1 million (Government of Pakistan, 2010).\nDespite some positive socioeconomic changes, the region\nremains one of the most disadvantaged in Pakistan. The geo-\ngraphical isolation, hard climatic conditions, mountainous\nenvironment, and scarcity of resources contribute to the\nregion's continuing socioeconomic backwardness. People\nhave very limited access to essential facilities such as health\ncare, education, communication, electricity, and transporta-\ntion. Most people (90%) live in sparsely scattered remote vil-\nlages. The annual per capita income is estimated at 60% of\nthe national standard of US$1,047 (Government of Pakistan,\n2009a). The communities depend for their livelihood on a\nvariety of sources such as substance farming, employment\nwith government and private sector organizations, and lim-\nited commercial activities (e.g., trade with China, tourism,\nretailing, transport, and running restaurants). The major\nsource of livelihood, however, remains subsistence farming\nof wheat, corn, barely, vegetables, fruits, and cattle.

Rote memorization\nand moral dictates go hand in hand with a punitive school\nenvironment\" (p. 24). It further points out that the quality of\neducation is particularly low in the rural areas because\nschools have insufficient material resources and staff, and\nteachers are either untrained or poorly trained. The report\nalso says that most teachers have little exposure to English\nand few opportunities to practice it and that, in many cases,\nteachers have inadequate content knowledge, particularly in\nmathematics and science.\nBackground of the Study\nThe National Education Policies in Pakistan including the\nrecent one (Government of Pakistan, 2009b) have consid-\nered quality education in general and science education in\nparticular as a means to achieving radical social develop-\nment. The Government of Pakistan (2009b) stressed that\ncomprehensive social development can be achieved by\ndeveloping a strong base of workforces that is equipped with\ncutting edge scientific and technological knowledge and\nskills. By and large, the education system in the country has\nfailed to ensure provision of quality and purposeful science\neducation for the young generation. This failure is mainly\nattributed to such factors as irrelevant science curriculum,\nschool milieu, and classroom practices to ignite the interest\nof students and inculcate in them positive attitude toward\nscience. A critical look at the status of science education in\nPakistan reveals a dismaying situation, which is reflected in\nstudents' low achievement in core science subjects such as\nchemistry, biology, mathematics, and physics, particularly at\nsecondary level, which is a critical stage for students to\ndecide about their field of study after Grade 10. Chemistry\nis taught as a compulsory subject to Grades 9 and 10 stu-\ndents who opt for science as their main field of study at\nsecondary level in high school in Gilgit-Baltistan. The\nchemistry curriculum prescribed for secondary classes\n(Grades 10 and 12) contains a wide spectrum of concepts\npertaining to organic, inorganic, and physical chemistry that\nare to be learnt and mastered by the students in a 2-year\nperiod. Nation Chemistry Curriculum of 2006 for Grades 9 and\n10 is a well-constructed document. The aims and objectives\nare comprehensive and well articulated, and standards and\nbenchmarks are well defined and aligned appropriately with\naims and objectives. The National Chemistry Curriculum\nstates:\nChemistry Curriculum builds on the vertical progres-\nsion of the K-VIII science curriculum. It offers a rela-\ntively in-depth study of chemistry as a major,\nindependent science. It focuses on content, process\nskill, problem solving, inquiry, and critical and ana-\nlytical thinking skills . . . The aim of the curriculum is\nto produce students who will be capable of doing\nindependent thinking, asking questions, and looking\nfor answers on their own. (p. 01)\nThe curriculum is based on three broad categories of\nactivities that define the critical abilities of scientifically lit-\nerate students in Pakistan. These are knowing and using sci-\nence knowledge (learning science), constructing new science\nknowledge (doing science), and reflecting on science knowl-\nedge (thinking science). These broad performance indicators\nare connected with standards and benchmarks that describe\nwhat knowledge and skills students should acquire in the\nsubject. These standards emphasize \"higher order thing,\"\n\"deep knowledge,\" \"substantive knowledge,\" and \"connec-\ntion to the world beyond the grade room\" (Government of\nThe ultimate learning outcomes intended in the National\nCurriculum are quite ambitious, requiring teachers to adopt a\ncomprehensive vision of pedagogies and engage in practices\npremised on constructivist philosophy of learning that empha-\nsizes centrality of students in the learning process. How this\nhappens in reality? My experiences allude to a wide gulf that\nexists between the ideal curricular goals and what actually\nhappens in most of chemistry classrooms in Pakistan in gen-\neral and in rural Gilgit-Baltistan in particular.\nThe spiral science curriculum followed in schools in\nPakistan includes a wide range of concepts; the number of\nconcepts and knowledge around these concepts grow com-\nplex with change of class (Grades 1-10). Like the curricula\nof social sciences, the school curriculum of natural science\nare also subject to criticism. The most common criticism of\nthe schools' science curricula is that the curricula are not\nnecessarily designed by taking into account the research in\nthe field of cognitive science and educational psychology.\nThis pitfall in the process of the development of curriculum\nhas resulted in a large gap between curricular learning targets\nand level of students' cognitive abilities; some of these abili-\nties develop with age. So the curriculum prescribed for vari-\nous grades is not pitched at the actual cognitive capacity of\ndifferent grade students to acquire and process knowledge\nand Shayer (1995) found visible gaps in between-curricular\ndemands and cognitive levels of middle grade students (aged\n11-13). The researcher, using the developmental stages pro-\nposed by the Jean Piaget as reference points, investigated the\nrelationship between curriculum demands and the cognitive\nlevels of Grades 6 to 8 students. The researchers found visi-\nble gaps between the demands of middle grades science cur-\nriculum and cognitive levels of students. The researchers\nconcluded, \"It becomes evident that there exists a gap--\nwhich becomes increasingly wider--between curricular\ndemand and the cognitive levels of middles school students\"\n(p. 48). This made it difficult for teachers to teach the cur-\nriculum for understanding, and as a result, students were\nforced to learn by rote. The teachers also need to adapt cur-\nriculum to students' level of cognitions and experiences by\nadjusting modifying instructions, adjusting materials, and\ndesigning tasks to engage students in process-based learning,\nand employing motivational techniques to increase students'\ninterest, confidence, and competence in science at secondary\nlevel.\nMost of the children who study chemistry at the secondary\nlevel are not satisfied with their experiences of learning, in\nschools in general and public system schools in particular. As\nmentioned above, curriculum standards emphasize acquisition\nof specialized knowledge that needs certain attitudes, frame of\nmind, and skills on the part of students. Teaching of chemistry\nin government as well as in private schools in Gilgit-Baltistan\ncontributes little to attainment of the critical knowledge, skills,\nand attitudes envisaged in the National Curriculum document.\nResultantly, students find it difficult to engage in in-depth\nlearning of content knowledge in chemistry. With a weak\nfoundation, students even after passing Secondary School\nCertificate (SSC) examination fail to make any strong connec-\ntion with the subject. According to Iqbal, Azam, and Rana\n(2009), \"The traditional approach starts from predetermined\nbody of knowledge . . . The traditional way of teaching science\nis strictly based on textbooks and teacher is believed to be a\ndispenser of knowledge\" (pp. 5-6).\nBased on my experiences and my reflections as a learner,\nas teacher, and lately as a teacher, I developed interest in the\nkind of research I have reported in this article. The experi-\nences I gained working with students and teachers in govern-\nment schools in different parts of Pakistan are reminiscent of\nmy early experiences as a student. I recall how much time\nand effort I needed to put into memorizing factual informa-\ntion from textbook. Teacher would force us to memorize\nsubject matter in chemistry (definitions, theories, principles,\nchemical equations, etc.) merely to be able to recall this\ninformation in the examination. I found my perceptions\nabout teaching and learning developed during student life\ninfluencing my practices as a teacher. Gradually, exposition\nto new experiences that came through formal training and\nongoing reflections, my perceptions about teaching and\nlearning science changed. I began to believe that there is no\nreal value in learning scientific knowledge through memori-\nzation; learning subject matter knowledge in science is pow-\nerful after going through certain cognitive processes such as\nconstructing hypothesis, test hypothesis, classifying infor-\nmation, controlling variables, making predictions, carrying\nout practical activities, doing observation, recording and\nanalyzing data, and making sense of the data. Until and\nunless a leaner practices or undergoes some of these cogni-\ntive process in the science classroom, gaining conceptual\nunderstanding into science concepts remains a utopian dream\nfor majority of students. Students' transition into secondary\nscience curriculum without having command over knowl-\nedge of subject matter in middle-level science curriculum\nbecomes really a challenge for the students as well as for the\nteachers. As a result, majority of students in high school\nstruggles with their science subjects, particularly chemistry\ncourse. More than 50% students would require to retake their\nexamination in the chemistry course. Even the students who\npass the course usually do not gain desired depth in under-\nstanding the knowledge of subject matter. There has been a\nlack of systematic and in-depth investigation into the situa-\ntions and issues that surround teaching and learning of chem-\nistry in high school in Gilgit-Baltistan. Research studies are\nneeded to better understand the problems as well as the pos-\nsibilities of improving teaching chemistry in high schools in\nGilgit-Baltistan and Pakistan at large.\nLiterature Review\nResearchers around the world have examined a wide range\nof issues and practices in chemistry classrooms from various\nangles. The findings from this body of research suggest\nways for improving teaching chemistry at the secondary\nlevel. However, research studies conducted in chemistry\nclassroom at the secondary level, both in Pakistani and inter-\nnational context, have predominantly focused on identifying\nstudents' misconceptions around a wide range of chemistry\nconcepts. Typically, the studies, interested in students' mis-\nconceptions, have used different diagnostic tools, such as\ntest instrument, checklist, and so on, or conducting diagnos-\ntic interviews with students or with teachers, to elicit their\nmisconceptions and its origin. There have been hardly any\nefforts on the part of researchers interested in misconception\nto situate them in the social context of the classroom. Studies\nof conceptual difficulties in chemistry more often than not\ntake place within an environment created by the researcher\nto serve the specific purpose of his or her study.\nThe complexity of classroom life is important to be con-\nsidered because students and teachers are expected to col-\nlaborate on every aspect of classroom life involving teachers\nrelating to students and students relating to each other\nthrough various ways such as discussion, debating, and com-\nmunicating ideas. The complex interaction between teacher\nand students and among students constitutes the social con-\ntext of classroom environment where teachers and students\nare engaged in a collective process of learning that produces\nshared understanding and generates new knowledge or per-\nspectives and helps students take responsibility of their own\nlearning (e.g., Brown & Campione, 1996; Tahir & Treagust,\n1999). This requires teachers to balance the tensions\n4 SAGE Open\nand discrepancies between students' ideas and scientific\nknowledge, and ensure that classroom activities are geared\ntoward in-depth understanding of important science ideas\nand practices (Crawford, Kelley, & Brown, 2000). This\nunderscores the need for investigating students' tensions and\ndifficulties by situating them in the social context of\nthe classroom where teachers and students are engaged in\ncollective process of constructing knowledge of scientific\nphenomena.\nMoreover, secondary-level chemistry course requires sig-\nnificant prerequisite knowledge and understanding of very\nbasic concepts. The researchers showing interest in students'\nor teachers' misconception have predominantly focused on\neliciting a sophisticated understating of advanced-level con-\ntent and thereby \"taking for granted\" the common difficul-\nties that arise from the lack of understanding of a range of\nvery basic concepts and terms that are commonly used in\nchemistry classroom as a base to understand advanced-level\nscientific knowledge. It is therefore pertinent to ask as how\nstudents, particularly students in rural settings, such as\nGilgit-Baltistan, where a variety of general and context-spe-\ncific challenges paint a poor picture of teaching and learning\nscience, grapple with such basic concepts in chemistry class-\nroom. The issues and challenges students confront at various\nlevels are complex and may not be grasped only through\nusing diagnostic test instruments; rather, they can be cap-\ntured in a more comprehensive way by studying them as they\noccur in the complex social environment of the classroom\nduring routine teaching.\n\"Misconception research\" has produced a great deal of\nknowledge about misconceptions or alternative frameworks\nthat hamper students' in-depth learning of concepts in chem-\nistry. A large number of studies in international context as\nwell as in Pakistan have investigated students' misconcep-\ntion around a wide range of concepts in secondary chemistry.\nSome of these concepts are atoms and molecules (e.g.,\nTeichert, Tien, Anthony, & Rickey, 2008); gases and related\nconcepts such as temperature, pressure, kinetic molecular\ntheory, diffusion (e.g., Benson, Wittrock, & Baur, 1993;\nKrnel, Watson, & Glazar, 1998); chemical bonding (e.g.,\nOthman, Treagust, & Chandrasegaran, 2008); solution, solu-\nbility, and solubility equilibrium (e.g., Ebenezer & Erickson,\nchemistry and related concepts (e.g., Coll & Treagust, 2003;\nproperties of molecular and ionic compounds (e.g., Butts &\nMursaleen, 1999); chemical equilibrium (e.g., Banerjee,\nThe studies cited above have revealed several misconcep-\ntions or alternative conceptions that serve as barriers to\nin-depth learning of concepts in chemistry. Some of these\nstudies have also investigated the origins of these miscon-\nceptions (e.g., Bano, 1998; Driver, Squires, Rushworth, &\n1994). A common but a key finding that cuts across the les-\nsons learnt in these studies is about the students' lack of\nunderstanding of the Particulate Theory because almost\nevery concept in chemistry depends on the particulate nature\nof matter, which lays the foundation for understanding of\nother concepts (Harrison & Treagust, 2002). As noted by\nTaber (1997), many students' problems in chemistry lie in\nnot understanding the relation between the molecular and\nmacroscopic representations because students have not\ngrasped the role of models in chemistry. Students' miscon-\nceptions regarding these concepts are based on the fact that\nthey live and operate within macroscopic world of matter\nand do not easily follow shifts between macroscopic and\nsubmacroscopic levels. Consequently, they tend to develop\nalternative conceptions and nonscientific mental models.\nAdding to the problem is the fact that the teachers tend to\nconsider the particulate nature of matter as one of the simpler\ntopics to be dealt with quickly at the beginning of the year.\nTo sum up, as indicated by the above-cited studies, stu-\ndents generally do not understand the fundamental ideas of\nthe Particulate Theory. Misunderstanding of basic ideas\nrelating to the Particulate Theory pervades other concepts, as\nit serves to establish an alternative conception in students'\nminds that causes them to misunderstand further content\nknowledge in chemistry presented to them. Much of research\nin science education has capitalized on the work of cognitive\npsychologists. Learning in science is viewed as a highly\ncomplex cognitive activity. Researchers have explored the\neffect of diverse cognitive and personality characteristic on\nchildren's learning science. However, the pioneering work\ndone by cognitive psychologists, Piaget and Vygotsky, the\ntwo renowned cognitive psychologists, have made signifi-\ncant contribution to learning science. In fact, their theories\nprovided a conceptual base to constructivism, one of the\nmajor contemporary theory of learning. Central to Piaget's\ncognitive constructivism and Vygotsky's social constructiv-\nism is the emphasis on the role of social world in the cogni-\ntive development of a child. Despite their agreement on the\ninseparable nature of the relationships between individual\nand the environment, the two cognitive psychologists differ\nin the way in which they conceive the role of social world\nand the individual. According to Piaget (1977, cited in\nAtherton, 2011), the development of the child is a result of\nan adaptation to the social and the physical milieu. Social life\nis a necessary condition for the development of logic (Piaget,\nthe premise that individual intellectual or cognitive develop-\nment can be better understood with reference to the social\nmilieu in which social support in the form of interaction with\nothers that also involve skills, which have developed in a\nsociohistorical context, mediate intellectual activity. Thus,\nindividual development, from Vygotsky's point of view,\nbecomes a high mental process that cannot be understood\nwithin the context of social interactions.\nYet another type of research within the genre of research\nin science education is attitude based or attitudinal research.\nThe attitudinal research is based on the premise that students'\nmeaningful engagement in learning science is primarily\ndetermined by their level of motivation and positive attitudes\nand optimism towards the subject (Osborne, Simon, &\nstudies conducted in Pakistan (e.g., Anwar & Bhutta, 2010;\nwhere in the world (e.g., Foley & McPhee, 2008; Haussler &\nHoffmann, 2003) typically have focused on students' atti-\ntudes toward learning science. In the attitude-based research,\nthe main focus has been on perceptions, experiences, emo-\ntions, thoughts, opinions, enthusiasm, likes and dislikes, and\nso on. In the attitudinal research, researchers have used a\nvariety of variables as units for attitude analysis such as age\nlevel or study grades, gender, social context, rural and urban\nsites, and so on. Overview of the various finding from attitu-\ndinal research literature can be summarized into three inter-\nrelated broad or general principles: first, students' attitude\ntoward science is an important determinant of how students\nrelate to the subject that in turn influences how they learn\nscience; second, students' attitude toward science is shaped\nby numerous factors from the sociocultural environment in\nwhich students live and undergo social experiences which in\nturn influence students' cognitive or intellectual abilities;\nand third, positive attitude towards science are inherently\nlinked with their social and life experiences and thereby stu-\ndents' level of success in learning science is attributed to the\nlevel of motivation they bring to learning the subject. These\nprinciples, emanating from attitudinal research, have impor-\ntant implications for efforts toward improving science edu-\ncation. These principles are further briefly examined with\nthe help from the researcher literature.\nIqbal et al. (2008), using an attitude scale used by research-\ners in the United Kingdom (Pell & Jarvis, 2001, cited in Iqbal\net al., 2008), explored primary and elementary school\n(Grades 4-8) children's attitude toward science, with particu-\nlar interest to see if there was a difference in the level of the\neffect of Islamic values on students' attitude compared with\nthe British secular societal values. The study used students'\ngender and schools' locations (urban and semiurban context)\nas important units of analysis. The findings suggested that\ndespite many sociocultural differences, no significant varia-\ntions in predetermined attitude indicators were found in the\nPakistani and the British study. Pakistani children, both from\nurban and semiurban locations, seemed to be in accord with\ntheir peers in British schools who considered exploratory and\ndiscovery-based learning as means to effective learning in\nscience. The overarching conclusion of the study is that\ndespite the acute lack of resources for science education in\nschools, boys and girls both from urban and semiurban\nschools hold positive views about learning science. Children\nin semiurban environment bring positive attitude toward sci-\nence despite the fact that they do not get opportunity in\nschools to do experimentation. The researchers infer, \"exper-\nimental approach to science is attractive to children regard-\nless of gender and geographical locations\" (Iqbal et al., 2008,\np. 281). It is interesting to note that children from semiurban\ncontext displayed more positive attitude toward becoming\nscientists compared with their peers in urban schools. This,\naccording to the researchers, is due to the fact that parents\nreinforce the perception among children that in underprivi-\nleged rural or semiurban context getting education in the\nfield of science is an easy way to finding reasonable employ-\nment and improving living conditions. Pakistani studies (e.g.,\nwith international studies that have reported the role of sex as\nbeing the most influential variable related toward children's\nattitudes to science. Boys have consistently shown positive\nattitude towards science than girls, although both Pakistan\nstudies did not see any significant influence of gender on stu-\ndents' attitude toward science.\nResearch in science education has established that stu-\ndents'level of success in learning science is inherently linked\nwith their positive attitude toward science that in turn is\nattributed to the level of motivation they bring to learning the\nsubject. Research has revealed that students' motivation in\nscience learning plays a pivotal role in promoting conceptual\nchange and engaging in deep and reflective thinking, which\nare instrumental in enhancing students'science achievement.\nThis suggests that stimulating students' motivation to learn\nscience becomes an intervention on the part of teachers.\nResearch in Pakistan and other countries on the role of\nfocused intervention in improving students' learning out-\ncomes in science have found positive correlation between\nthe two. The implication of attitude-based research is that\nteachers are not merely to focus on modifying their own\nclassroom practices rather they have to play a role in chang-\ning the conditions in the inextricably entwined contexts of\nclassroom, school, home, and the larger society. A study by\nIqbal and Shayer (2000) investigated the impact of a 2-year\nintervention program undertaken to accelerate students' cog-\nnitive development in selected public and private secondary\nschools in Pakistan. The intervention program, tested previ-\nously in a research study in the United Kingdom, involved\nteacher training and visit of experts to selected schools sites\nto provide on-the-spot guidance to teachers regarding con-\nducting lessons. To assess students' level of cognitive devel-\nopment, pre- and posttests were conducted using the\nPiagetian test. The analysis of the data showed notable dif-\nferences in the performance of students from control and\nexperimental schools; the intervention seemed to have visi-\nble impact on students' cognitive development manifested\nby their ability to construct meaning, engaging in metacogni-\ntion and logical reasoning. All these cognitive skills are\n6 SAGE Open\ncritically important for learning science with understanding.\nThe researchers concluded that factors such as quality of the\ninput (teacher skills and attitude), school philosophy, and\ngeneral cultural of the schools came to play to determine the\noverall impact of the intervention.\nEfforts on the part on individual teacher or schools to\nimprove secondary students' learning outcomes in science\nneed to be cognizant of the complex nature of the learning in\nscience. In-depth learning of science is influenced by multi-\nple interactive factors. To understand the impact of contex-\ntual factors on learning science, it is necessary to examine\nthe circumstances around teaching and learning of science\nand the meaning given to these by teachers and schools as\nwell as by parents and community members. Teachers and\nschool, trying to improve students' learning outcomes in sci-\nence, find themselves confined within a set of conditions that\nmay support or hinder effective learning in science. By creat-\ning those conditions that support effective learning, teachers,\nmanagers, and parents can enhance the opportunity for aca-\ndemic improvement to become a permanent part of the\nschool and the classroom environment. Those conditions\nthat hamper improvement in teaching and learning pro-\ncesses, if remain unrecognized, lead to failure despite all\nefforts on part of teachers and school.\nMethod\nThe Participants of the Study\nThis study involved four secondary school teachers (three\nmale, one female), teaching chemistry at the secondary\nlevel, who were selected through purposive sampling pro-\ncess, coming from three high schools (two associated with\ngovernment and one belonging to a private, not-for-profit\nschool system) characterized by their relatively good reputa-\ntion for imparting quality science education at the secondary\nlevel. To study science, students from other neighboring\nelementary or high schools would take admission in the\nsampled schools. The four participants drawn from these\nschools were selected as a representative of those surveyed\nin purposive sampling process, and all displayed a high level\nof commitment towards teaching their subject. The selection\ncriteria considered to include chemistry teachers in the\nsample who had at least 5 years of experience in teaching\nchemistry and were interested in improving their teaching\nmethods and modifying and adjusting their instruction for\nthe purpose of improved students'learning in chemistry. The\ninformation that helped to identify the schools and the teach-\ners within these schools was collected through visiting\nschools and district offices, meeting with headteachers,\nteachers and students, district officials, and reading through\ndocuments such as examination results.\nThrough written application, I obtained administrative con-\nsent from competent authorities of the schools and from the\nparticipants. I provided the authorities and the participants\nwith detailed information about my study: the purpose of\nthe study, its intended benefits, sampling criteria, the demands\non teachers' time, the timeline of the study, data collection\ntools and procedure, and assurance of confidentiality and\nanonymity.\nI did not directly interact with students. However, I\nobserved them learning chemistry in the classroom. In this\nway, they become secondary participants in my study.\nI observed teaching and learning process in three different\nclassrooms having students in chemistry class ranging from\n30 to 40 students. So, on average, I could collect data about\n100 students' learning chemistry during routine lessons in\nthe classroom.\nAs articulated above, primarily the study is not concerned\nwith exploration of students' misconception around certain\ntopics in chemistry; rather it aims to create a context for dis-\ncussion and reflection on common issues, tensions, and chal-\nlenges faced by students in chemistry classroom in high\nschools in Gilgit-Baltistan. The underlying purpose is simply\nto gain a better contextualized understanding into how the\nrhetoric of change (engaging students in variety of processes\nto foster scientific thinking and cognitive development)\nreflected in the National Curriculum interacts with the reali-\nties of practice in the context of students' learning of chem-\nistry in high schools in Gilgit-Baltistan.\nI employed qualitative case study method to generate\nrelevant data in the study. The case study method helped in\ncollecting rich qualitative data about classroom processes\nsuch as instructions, teacher\u00adstudent interaction, students'\nencounter with knowledge of subject matter, and teachers'\npedagogical tactics. Multiple data collection tools, such as\nin-depth interviews, classroom observations, and postobser-\nvation reflective discussion with the teachers were used to\ngathered qualitative data. Classroom observations helped\ndocument activities and processes, critical incidences, and\nanecdotal evidence about students' difficulties in learning\nconcepts and teacher's pedagogical moves to remedy these\ndifficulties. The postobservation reflective discussion with\nthe teachers and in-depth interview with the research partici-\npants helped access the participants' experiences, beliefs,\nand values that underpin their teaching practices. To facili-\ntate in-depth interviews with individual participants, open-\nended questions were used that allowed further probing.\nThe teachers were interviewed for about an hour regard-\ning their teaching of chemistry in general and about teaching\nprimary concepts in particular. They were asked to reflect on\nthe instructional strategies, instructional materials, class-\nroom activities, and home tasks, catering to individual stu-\ndents'learning needs. The interviews were recorded on audio\ncassettes and were transcribed and analyzed.\nI observed five routine lessons (35- to 40-min long\ninstruction time) of each teacher. The purpose of the obser-\nvations was to examine in depth how the teachers organize\nactivities around the topic under consideration, what chal-\nlenges confronted students in in-depth learning of subject\nmatter, and how the teachers helped them in the learning pro-\ncess and improved students' understanding of the subject\nmatter.\nThe in-depth interviews with teachers, classroom obser-\nvations, and postobservation reflective discussions with\nteachers were guided mainly by the following general\nquestions:\n\u00b7 What common difficulties do students experience\nduring routine chemistry lessons?\n\u00b7 What are the possible reasons for these difficulties?\n\u00b7 How do teachers, in their day-to-day teaching, help\nstudents overcome these difficulties?\nData Analysis\nThe above three questions represent together a framework\nfor collection and analysis of data provided. The data analy-\nsis was guided by three main categories: (a) teachers'experi-\nences about conceptual learning of subject matter; (b) the\nissues, tensions, and challenges associated with in-depth\nlearning of basic chemistry concepts; and (c) the manner in\nwhich teachers assist students to overcome conceptual dif-\nficulties and tensions.\nBased on the above categories, content analysis (Miles &\nHuberman, 1994) was carried out, which involved reading\nand rereading of transcripts, identification of small key ideas,\nand grouping and regrouping these ideas into key themes.\nThe key themes were compared across the four cases to iden-\ntify cross-cutting key themes. The broad cross-cutting themes\nwere formulated into key findings, which were further ana-\nlyzed and interpreted to reach plausible conclusions.\nFindings\nAnalysis of the data collected through classroom observa-\ntion, postobservation reflective discussion, and in-depth\ninterviews with the teachers helped identify certain critical\nincidences and anecdotal evidences that explain the common\ndifficulties faced by students in chemistry classrooms, the\ncauses underlying these difficulties, and teachers' responses\nto these difficulties. Triangulation of data from three differ-\nent sources helped identify key cross-cutting themes. These\nthemes are translated into the following key findings.\nFirst, there is a huge gap between what is intended in the\nNational Curriculum and what actually happens in the class-\nroom where students learn chemistry. The realities of prac-\ntice suggest that for chemistry teachers, fostering in-depth\nlearning in line with and in the true spirit of the aims and\nobjectives of the National Curriculum is a task easier said\nthan done. Realization of such curricular goals as develop-\nment of higher order thinking, knowing and using scientific\nknowledge, and constructing new science knowledge\nremains a utopian dream in high school in Gilgit-Baltistan.\nSecond, there are multiple reasons contributing to stu-\ndents' failure to engage in meaningful learning in chemistry\nclassrooms. However, the main hurdle lies in students'\ninability to demonstrate a good understanding of very basic\nconcepts of the subject. Due to huge gaps in students' under-\nstanding of fundamental concepts, they are unable to engage\nin in-depth learning of advanced level content. This finding\naccords with the lessons reported by other studies that\nemphasize the inherent link between students' prior knowl-\nedge and new knowledge (e.g., Gollub, Bertenthal, Labov, &\nThird, despite working against all odds, the teachers\nappear to be committed to teaching their subject. They do try\nto assist students to overcome the difficulties in their effort to\nmake a good sense of the subject matter presented to them.\nThe teachers do make deliberate efforts to value and explore\nstudents' prior knowledge and use it as a basis to help stu-\ndents construct an understanding of concepts under consid-\neration. They do try out their own unique remedial tactics\nand instructional strategies to engage students in meaningful\nlearning. These strategies include using examples, analogies,\nquestioning, cues and probing, and prompting; offering alter-\nnative explanation; supplying information to fill knowledge\ngaps; reinforcing key points; and backtracking. Backtracking,\nhowever, remains a dominant instructional strategy the\nteachers use to bridge the gaps that existed between students'\nprior knowledge and the content knowledge under consider-\nation. These pedagogical tactics are very much grounded in\nthe teachers' personal experiences as learners and resulting\nintuitive understandings of ways through which to help stu-\ndents grasp concepts by constructing their own meaning and\nmaking connections.\nThe teachers are familiar with the variety of challenges\nfaced by students in in-depth learning of subject matter. They\ndemonstrate awareness about the ways through which to\naddress these challenges or at least mitigate the adverse\neffect of these challenges on students'learning. Akram Khan\n(pseudonyms), for example, reflects on such a challenge and\nhis approach to dealing with it. He says,\nIn my view, Periodic Table of elements is the back-\nbone of chemistry. Understanding of the chemistry is\ncontingent upon understanding of the Periodic Table.\nHad I been the author of this book [Chemistry], I\nwould have kept the Periodic Table as the first chapter.\nIn chemistry, the Periodic Table should be taught first.\nStudents' learning about concepts such as valency is\ndependent on their understanding of the concepts of\n\"Groups\" and \"Periods\" [in the Periodic Table]. I\nwould say children who understand the Periodic Table\nwell can easily grasp the whole subject. (Excerpt from\nteacher's interview)\nAfzal Ali (pseudonyms), another participant, makes simi-\nlar observations when he says,\nThe textbook defines the concept of valency as \"the\nability of an element to combine with another element\n8 SAGE Open\nto form a compound.\" This is vague, and that is why it\ntakes us three days to make children understand the\nconcept of valency. We need to emphasize a deeper\nknowledge of Periodic Table first. (Excerpt from\nteacher's interview)\nHere the teachers criticize the chemistry textbooks\nbecause their sequencing of chapters and topics lacks inter-\nnal logic and coherence. The Periodic Table provides very\nbasic information about the characteristics of the elements.\nTherefore, their suggestion of resequencing textbook's chap-\nters and shifting the Periodic Table from Chapter 3 to Chapter\n1 may make a sense.\nFurthermore, the teachers consider learning as a develop-\nmental process in which earlier experiences provide the foun-\ndations for making sense of later ones. They believe that their\nstudents can construct knowledge through an interaction\nbetween what they know already and the new learning they\nexperience. Nargis Bano (pseudonyms), for example, consid-\ners linking students' prior understanding to a new concept as\ncentral to promoting conceptual learning. She argues, \"If stu-\ndents'prior understanding of a concept is probed in-depth and\nbreadth, it helps a great deal in fostering deeper understand-\ning of the subject matter\" (excerpt from teacher's interview).\nMuhammad Basheer (pseudonyms) also echoes Nargis\nBano's emphasis on prior knowledge when he says, \"For me\nit is highly desirable to consider how can I make connections\nbetween new learning and prior learning and how those con-\nnections can variously support or confound students' acquisi-\ntionofnewunderstanding\"(excerptfromteacher'sinterview).\nArguing in a similar vein, Afzal Ali (pseudonyms) says,\n\"Students possess a quite complex structure of ideas and\nexperiences; and, if motivated and provided with proper help,\nthey can gain deep understanding through interactions\nbetween new knowledge and previous knowledge of the con-\ncept\" (excerpt from teacher's interview). Akram Khan holds\nsimilar views about building students' understanding of sub-\nject matter on what they already know about the concept. For\nexample, reflecting on one of his instructional decisions dur-\ning a chemistry lesson, he explains:\nThe task I assigned to student was a little bit challeng-\ning because I believe that students possess the abilities\nfor doing everything. If we provide them with oppor-\ntunities they can do it [learn on their own]. Children\ncarry with them a rich collection of ideas and informa-\ntion. The only thing they need is guidance. (Excerpt\nfrom postobservation discussion)\nIn the above, the teachers'reflections underscore the need\nfor valuing students' ideas, conceptions, opinions, experi-\nences, and knowledge and linking them with a new knowl-\nedge or experiences.\nThe Situations Revealing Students'Tensions\nand Difficulties\nStudents' tensions and difficulties were manifested by the\nclose observation of the following situations in the class-\nroom: when the teacher introduced a new concept in a lesson\nand students could not cope with it; a lesson involving more\nadvance-level information pertaining to the subject matter\nunder consideration; students recalling factual information\n(word to word) instead of describing the ideas, information,\nor meaning in their own words; students' inability to linking\nideas or making conceptual connections; students' not offer-\ning explanation in support of their viewpoint; and students\nnot asking question. All these situations were recognized by\nthe triangulation of data from my field notes (classroom\nobservation), teachers' interviews, and teachers' reflection\non anecdotes and critical incidences.\nClassroom Anecdotes and Critical Incidences\nExample 1 (Atomic model/structure). In one of the chemis-\ntry lessons, Akram Khan was teaching chemical equation,\nbut given the situation he needed to revisit the atomic model.\nThe students confused the definition of atomic number with\nmass number, position, and characteristics of atomic parti-\ncles in the atom with each other (e.g., associating negativity\nwith proton and positivity with electron). Primarily, the dif-\nficulty in gaining in-depth understanding of the concept of\natomic model seems to be embedded in the complex and\nabstract nature of the concept, as noted by many studies con-\ncerned with the particulate theory of matter. The teacher\nexplained by using diagram of atomic model (labeling and\ndescribing parts of atom) and did backtracking (recalling\ninformation previously learnt).\nExample II (Ionic bonding). A lesson dealt with formation of\nthe ionic compound calcium chloride (CaCl\n). Students\nthought that in CaCl\n, Ca+2 combined with 2Cl-1. The mis-\nconception lied in the fact that Cl-1 + Cl-1 = 2Cl-1 instead of\nconceiving it as Cl-1 + Cl-1 = 2Cl-2. Students were also con-\nfused that why Ca+2 + (Cl-1 + Cl-1) is written as CaCl\nwhy\nnot 2CaCl. The teacher verbally explained the law of definite\nproportion and showed on the blackboard how it applied to\nthe example at hand: Ca carries two plus charges (Ca+2),\nwhereas Cl carries one minus charge. So to form ionic bond\nbetween Ca and Cl, two atoms of Cl are required. The total\ncharge on Cl atoms taking part in the reaction will be -2.\nExample III (Chemical equations). In one of the lessons\ninvolving chemical equations, students could not easily deal\nwith the question of balancing chemical equation, and sec-\nond could not explain to the teacher as why did they write 2\nwith H on the left-hand side and 2 with H\nO on the right-\nhand side of the equation, that is, 2H\n+ O\n+ Cl\n= 2NaCl. In fact, the teacher was preparing students for\na lesson about chemical bonds. The lesson began with teach-\ner's question: \"Who can tell me chemical formula of water?\"\nTwo students (29 students were present in the class) kept\nquiet, the rest raised their hands, indicating that they knew\nthe answer. The teacher chose one student to answer the\nquestion. Students correctly recalled the answer (H\nO).\nTeacher posed second question: \"Who can describe for me\nhow water (H\nO) forms?\" This time the number of raised\nhands decreased (23 students raised their hands) implying\nsome students' inability to recall or describe the process\ninvolved in the formation of water molecule. After a pause,\none student correctly recalled the information: \"Two mole-\ncules of hydrogen combine with one molecule of oxygen to\nform water.\" The teacher wrote the statement on the chalk-\nboard and invited students to represent it in the form of\nchemical equation (using symbols). This time, relatively a\nless proportion of students, showed their interest to come\nforward and write the chemical equation. One student came\nforward and, with trial and error, she wrote the equation: H\n+ O\n= H\nO. The teacher praised the student's effort and at\nthe same time challenged her that what she had produced\nwas not 100% correct. The teacher invited other students to\nrecognize what was lacking in the equation and then to add\nthe missing element so that a \"balanced equation\" was\nobtained. The teacher asked the class to complete the equa-\ntion on their notebooks. It appeared that only a few students\nseemed to have the ability to correctly answer the question\n(successfully attempted the question: 2H\nO\nO).\nFinally, teacher asked for justification (reasoning) as why it\nrequired them to add 2 with H\n(reactant) on the left-hand\nside and 2 with H\nO (product) on the right-hand side of the\nchemical equation. Hardly 2 students out of 29 present in the\nclass offered reason as why modification was required in the\nequation and how it was made.\nDiscussion\nTo reflect through the findings regarding the difficulties\nunderlying in-depth student learning, I briefly examined the\nnature and the causes of the difficulties students are faced\nwith in coping with the concepts cited above and teacher's\naction to remedy the situation.\nIn chemistry, the concept of \"atomic model\" and allied\nsubconcepts form the very foundation on which learning of\nthe entire discipline depends. It may not be an exaggeration\nto describe knowledge of atomic model combined with some\nof its primary allied concepts as a backbone of the under-\nstanding of the knowledge base of the whole discipline. Poor\nunderstanding of these fundamental concepts, therefore, has\ntremendous implications for the conceptual learning of\nnumerous concepts in the temporal chemistry curriculum.\nThe teachers' reflection combined with observation of a\ncouple of chemistry lessons revealed atomic model to be a\nproblematic area where students lacked depth and breadth of\nunderstanding. They often confused the definition of the\n\"atomic number\" with the definition of \"mass number\" and\nposition of the atomic particles and their characteristics with\neach other (e.g., associating positivity with electron and neg-\nativity with proton, locating proton in the orbit, and associat-\ning electron with nucleus). In normal learning setting (like in\nschools in Gilgit-Baltistan), students do not have the facility\nto do experimentation or physically observe phenomena to\nverify the information and ideas presented to them about the\nconcept through textbook or teacher's lecture. Usually anal-\nogies, models, diagrams, and imageries are used in the text-\nbooks and by the teachers to help facilitate the learning about\natomic model and its allied concepts. These strategies are\nimportant and effective on their own right; however, they\nmay not provide sufficient conditions to help develop con-\nceptual understanding of the topic. This necessities an ongo-\ning quest for instructional strategies and resources to\neffectively deal with the challenge of teaching atomic model\nand its allied concepts in the context of chemistry classroom.\nThe federal government has provided computers in many\nhigh schools under the national computer literacy program.\nTeachers in these schools can use computer simulation to\nhelp students better comprehend basic abstract scientific\nideas related to atomic structure.\nIn the above Example II, the difficulty lied in students'\npoor understanding of the primary knowledge in the back-\nground of the formation of ionic compounds or bonding rela-\ntionship between and among elements. They have already\nbeen introduced to the \"law of definite proportion\" in chem-\nistry, but they were unable to apply it to the situation at hand:\nformation of the ionic compound CaCl\nStudents thought\nthat in the CaCl\n, Ca+2 combined with 2Cl-1; the misconcep-\ntion lied in the fact that Cl-1 + Cl-1 = 2Cl-1 instead of con-\nceiving it as Cl-1 + Cl-1= Cl-2 (Cl\n: molecule of chlorine with\ntwo negative charges). Students were confused that why\nCa+2 + (Cl-1 + Cl-1) is written as CaCl\nwhy not 2CaCl. This\nmisconception must have different origins. The teacher\nbelieves that, may be thinking in a linear way, the students\napplied the rule of algebra, in which, x-1 + x-1 can be written\nThe teacher's remedial efforts appeared to be rigorous\nenough to help students overcome the conceptual confusion\nthey harbored and bridge the knowledge gap. The teacher\nverbally as well as diagrammatically explained the law of\ndefinite proportion and showed on the chalkboard how it\napplied to the example at hand. He explained that Ca carried\ntwo plus charges (Ca+2), whereas Cl carried one minus\ncharge. So to form ionic bond between Ca and Cl, two atoms\nof Cl were required. The total charge on Cl molecule taking\npart in the reaction would be -2, and the number of chlorine\natoms in the chemical formula of the ionic compound would\nbe represented by Cl\ninstead of 2Cl, which has an entirely\ndifferent meaning in the context of balancing chemical\nequations.\nIn the example at hand (2H\n+ O\nO), students were\nrequired to balance the chemical equation and explained the\nprocess (what was done and why?). Presumably, the students\nwho were reluctant to raise their hand might have had diffi-\nculty in recalling the information. For some students, it was\ndifficult to symbolically represent (H\n+ O\n= H\nO) the state-\nment about formation of the water molecule. Other students\nwere able to answer the question; nevertheless, they legged\nbehind in demonstrating yet another level of knowledge of\nthe topic, balancing the equation (2H\n+ O\nO). Fewer\nstudents even demonstrated the knowledge about balancing\nchemical equation (probably out of memory, not out of\nunderstanding), but they failed to explain why they added 2\nwith H on the left-hand side and 2 with the product on the\nright-hand side of the equation. In other words, they were\nunable to physically explain the phenomenon.\nThe conceptual hurdles students are faced with in learn-\ning subject-matter knowledge, such as balancing chemical\nequation, do not exist in isolation; rather, they are interlinked\nin complex ways. This implies that \"understanding\" concept\nsuch as chemical equation is a multilayered and dynamic\nphenomenon. As seen in the above example, student's recall-\ning or constructing equation of the formation of water mol-\necule does not necessarily amount to confirmation of their\nlearning the concept with understanding. A clear trend is\nreflected in this example, in which, as the concept grows\ncomplex, students' responses decrease sharply. This exem-\nplifies the multilayered and dynamic natures of the notion of\nin-depth learning of scientific concepts.\nThese various facts explain the complexity of the situa-\ntion teachers are faced with in dealing with the situations\nsuch as assessing students' prior knowledge of the subject\nmatter, catering to or dealing with individuals' level of\nunderstanding or learning needs and thereby achieving uni-\nformity in students' level of understanding of the topic.\nThe mediocre culture that prevails in science classroom in\npublic and private schools in Gilgit-Baltistan may be attrib-\nuted to the challenges faced at multiple levels ranging from\nlack of educational resources (laboratory equipment and\nlibrary resources) to poorly qualified or untrained teachers to\nteach science subjects. Students studying science course in\nsecondary schools in Gilgit-Baltistan are ill prepared to pur-\nsue higher studies in science. The study has provided insight\ninto some of the common factors that contribute toward the\ninvariable decline in the quality of science education\nimparted in schools in Gilgit-Baltistan. Various social fac-\ntors, contextual or cultural factors, and academic factors\ncombine to affect students' attitude, their ability to engage\nin science learning, and their achievement. Science curricu-\nlum cannot be developed and implemented in isolation.\nDevelopment and implementation of curriculum need to take\ninto account social structures and economic conditions of the\nlocal context into account.\nConclusions and Implications\nThe main learning objectives emphasized in the chemistry\ncurriculum not only stress the need for students to learn and\nmaster primary concepts of chemistry but also undergo intel-\nlectual development as scientifically literate citizen. These\nobjectives can only be achieved if students gain conceptual\nunderstanding in science knowledge. Not a single factor\ncontributes to conceptual learning but it occurs within a\nmilieu which in turn is a result of interplay of multiple fac-\ntors ranging from curriculum to teachers'ability to structural\nand human resources. Efforts toward promoting conceptual\nlearning in science classroom or development of students'\ncognitive skills need to be informed by the knowledge and\nunderstanding contributed by different genre of research\nsuch as a cognitive psychology, social psychology, and atti-\ntudinal and intervention-based research. It is now well estab-\nlished that what an individual learns is as a result of the\nlearner's actively relating what is already known to what is\nbeing taught or experienced.\nThe anecdotal evidence from the research participants'\nteaching context presented and discussed above exemplify\nthe challenges and the common conceptual difficulties stu-\ndents usually face in learning subject matter in chemistry\nclassroom in high schools in Gilgit-Baltistan. It appears that\nin the context of each situation presented above, the crux of\nthe matter lied in the poor background knowledge students\nbrought to the learning situation. It is evident from the above\nfailed to demonstrate very basic understanding of chemistry\nconcepts. Fundamentally, the challenges seem to arise from\nstudents' poor subject knowledge background, which appar-\nently is the consequence of the poor teaching, inadequate\nacademic support and guidance, and insufficient individual\nattention they received from their environment (subject\nteacher, school, parents, and peers). Lacking essential knowl-\nedge of the primary chemistry concepts, which needed to be\nlearnt and mustered at lower secondary levels, students\nseemed confused despite teacher's good efforts to communi-\ncate the concept using a variety of simple examples and\nexplanations. This suggests that until and unless students\nbring a good understanding of the very basic concepts to the\nlearning situation, they may not be able to cope with the\nadvanced level knowledge. This underscores the critical\nimportance of students' learning basic science concepts in\nthe early stages with understanding.\nThe insights offered and the concerns raised in the article\nseem to have important implications for understanding class-\nroom realties (imperatives and impediments of in-depth stu-\ndent learning) in Pakistan in general and in Gilgit-Baltistan\nin particular. Specifically, the implications of the results of\nthis study can be seen and explained in the context of schools,\nteachers, and other educational stakeholders.\nStudents' learning of subject matter with deeper under-\nstanding may not take place in the classroom in an isolated\nfashion. In-depth leaning is closely connected with various\nconditions inside and outside the classroom. This calls for\nsynchronization and integration of efforts on the part of\nschool. Schools need to create situations where teachers are\nencouraged to reflect on their own practices and engage in\nefforts to improve their general as well as subject-based ped-\nagogical skills. The high demands of conceptual learning\nrequire chemistry teachers to letting go of transmission-ori-\nented practices; they need to carefully prepare lesson plans,\nstudent worksheets, assignments, and assessment tasks to be\nable to think about and convey the subject matter in different\nways.\nRecognition of the teacher's vital facilitative role in in-\ndepth student learning necessitates equipment of teacher\nwith professional competencies (knowledge, skills, and dis-\nposition). Unfortunately, most traditional pre- and in-service\nteacher training program in Pakistani context do not provide\nnecessary conditions to help inculcate and nurture these criti-\ncal professional qualities in teachers. This entails a new\nvision of education and professional growth for teacher com-\npatible with a vision of pedagogy. So the efforts in the con-\ntextofreformingscienceteachereducationinGilgit-Baltistan\nas well as in the country need to be geared toward \"pedagogy\nof understanding\" (Perkins, 1993) to help science teachers\nacquire the requisite knowledge and skills. The \"pedagogy\nof understanding\" may be explained in terms of teachers\nknowing about creative ways of promoting in-depth student\nlearning. Teachers need to make instructional selections\nfrom among an array of choices comprising teaching meth-\nods and models, teaching acts and instructional strategies\nsuch as practical work, interactions through group work or\npair work, presentations, whole class discussion, application\nof knowledge, use of creative motivational techniques, ques-\ntioning, and applying problem solving or inquiry-oriented\ninstructional strategies. It is only thorough these action, the\ngoals of National Curriculum can be realized.\nAll of the above would require schools to recognize the\nvital importance of long-term planning, preparation, and\nwell-structured and well-thought strategies instead of\ndepending on incidental measures to deal with the difficul-\nties arising from teachers' inability to promote in-depth stu-\ndent learning in such important curriculum subjects as\nchemistry. Most of the high schools in Gilgit-Baltistan enroll\nstudents from Nursery to Grade 10. Science course is an inte-\ngral part of school curriculum. The schools need to pay heed\nto the fact that the way science course is taught in schools is\nnot helpful at all to nurture scientific thinking and develop a\nstrong base for advance studies in science. Schools need to\ntake all possible measures to create an environment in pri-\nmary science classroom where teachers and students engage\nin activities that help them enhance their cognitive skills and\ndevelop mastery of primary science concepts. Students tran-\nsiting to upper grades with adequate knowledge base and\ncognitive skills can easily cope with the demands of the mid-\ndle or secondary science curriculum. Moreover, schools,\nteachers, district education department, and the authorities\n(examinations boards) need to work together to help evolve\nan examination system that gives importance to learning and\ncognitive development instead of the traditional emphasis on\nsyllabus coverage, which has become almost a necessary\nevil. Teachers and schools need a certain degree of freedom\nin making decisions with regard to syllabus coverage and\npreparing students for internal and external test/exams.\nFinally, lessons learnt in this study have important impli-\ncations for all key stakeholders, including teachers, adminis-\ntrators, students, parents, practitioners, and policy makers.\nImprovement in science education in schools may not be\nachieved in schools, in general, and in government schools,\nin particular, without concerted and consistent efforts on the\npart of the above key stakeholders.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAnwar, N.
