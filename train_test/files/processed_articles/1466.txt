Excess weight among\nchildren and adolescents aged 2\nthrough 19 years is defined based on\nspecific BMI-for-age growth charts.9\nBody mass index is calculated as weight\nin kilograms divided by height in me-\nters squared, rounded to 1 decimal\nplace.\nThere have been recent changes in\nthe nomenclature for specific levels of\nhigh BMI for age in children. In the\nrecommended that children and ado-\nlescents aged 2 through 19 years at or\nabove the 95th percentile of BMI for age\nbe labeled \"overweight\" and children\nbe labeled \"at risk for overweight.\"10,11\nA more recent expert committee rec-\nommended that these groups of chil-\ndren be labeled \"obese\" and \"over-\nweight,\" respectively.12\nIn this article, we present estimates\nfor infants and toddlers at or above the\n95th percentile of weight for recum-\nbent length and for children and ado-\nlescents at 3 levels of high BMI: BMI for\nage at or above the 97th, at or above the\ntiles. For children and adolescents, be-\ncause of recent changes in terminol-\nogy and because we present an estimate\nfor at or above the 97th percentile,\nwhich does not have a recommended\nlabel, we use the phrase \"high BMI\" to\nrefer to all 3 BMI-for-age cut points. Be-\ncause the 95th percentiles of BMI for\nmales and 19-year-old males are above\n30, a teenager could be considered\nobese by the adult definition but not\nhave a high BMI based on the 95th per-\ncentile of BMI for age. Consequently,\nyears of age) at or above the adult defi-\nnition of obesity (BMI 30)2 was also\nestimated.\nParticipants reported their race and\nethnicity after being shown a list that\nincluded an open-ended response. Par-\nticipants aged 16 years and older\nreported their own race and ethnicity,\nand for children younger than 16 years,\na family member reported race and\nethnicity.Forthepurposesofthisanaly-\nsis, race/ethnic groups were catego-\nrized as non-Hispanic white, non-\nHispanic black, total Hispanic, and\nMexican American.

For example, to test a change\nquires a sample size of approximately\nseveral time periods, the statistical test\nfor trends requires fewer sample per-\nsons per time period. Sufficient power\nexists when combining the survey pe-\nriods to detect a change of 5%.\nStatistical analyses were done using\nSAS (version 9.2; SAS Institute Inc,\nCary, North Carolina) and SUDAAN\n(version 10; Research Triangle Insti-\ntute, Research Triangle Park, North\nCarolina). All analyses excluded preg-\nnant females. Sample weights were used\nto account for differential nonre-\nsponse and noncoverage and to adjust\nfor planned oversampling of some\ngroups. Standard errors were esti-\nmated with SUDAAN using Taylor se-\nries linearization, a design-based ap-\nproach. Differences between age groups\nand race/ethnic groups were tested\nusing logistic regression models. Be-\ncause significant interactions were\nfound between sex and race/ethnic\ngroup, sex-specific models were run.\nOverall and within each race/ethnic\ngroup, differences by sex were tested\nusing t tests with a Bonferroni correc-\ntion based on 4 comparisons (4 race/\nethnic groups); thus, a P value of .05\nnificant.\nLinear trends were tested over 5 time\nusing time period as both a continu-\nous and a categorical variable in logis-\ntic regression models. Time period was\nanalyzed as a categorical variable to ex-\namine the possibility that 1 or 2 time\nperiods were leading to any differ-\nences that were found significant when\ntime period was analyzed as a continu-\nous variable. Odds ratios (ORs) asso-\nciated with the trends and P values for\nthe Satterthwaite adjusted F statistic\nfrom models that contain time period\nas a continuous variable are presented\nin the text. A Bonferroni correction was\nmade based on 6 different compari-\nsons (2 sexes and 3 race/ethnic groups);\nis considered significant.\nAnalysis of trends was slightly dif-\nferent for different age groups given dif-\nferent definitions for excess weight and\ndifferences in prevalence between age\ngroups. Sex-specific trend analyses were\ndone separately for infants and chil-\ndren aged from birth to 2 years and for\npreschool children aged 2 through 5\nyears, based on multiple logistic regres-\nsion models adjusted for race/\nethnicity. Preliminary analyses showed\nno difference in prevalence between the\n19-year-old age groups, which is con-\nsistent with previous NHANES stud-\nies. Consequently, we combined these\nTable 1.

The decrease in prevalence was\ngreater in girls than in boys.20 In En-\ngland, an analysis of 3-year moving av-\nerages of obesity prevalence suggests\nthat the trend in obesity may be level-\ning off in the most recent 3 years\namong girls (but not boys), where there\nwas a significant decrease in preva-\namong 2- through 15-year-olds.

In 2007, there was\nno difference in prevalence between\nboys and girls,21 suggesting boys have\n\"caught up\" with girls. Because preva-\nlence estimates are relative to sex-\nspecific distributions from the past (eg,\nthe BMI-for-age CDC growth charts\n1970s), it is possible that there were dif-\nferences between boys and girls in the\nsex differences in prevalence seen to-\nday.\nInterpreting the prevalence of high\nBMI requires some caveats. Body mass\nindex does not measure adiposity di-\nrectly. In children, BMI is correlated\nwith adiposity and that correlation is\nhigher at higher levels of BMI for age\nthan at lower levels of BMI for age.\nMoreover, there are differences in adi-\nposity between black and white indi-\nviduals at the same BMI level.22 Be-\ncause BMI varies by age and sex in\nchildren, cut points relate to a refer-\nence population, in this case the CDC\ngrowth charts. These cut points are sta-\ntistical and are not based on health out-\nThere are currently many efforts un-\nder way aimed at preventing childhood\nobesity.
