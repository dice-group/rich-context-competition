We specify structural equation mod-\nels for extracting associations between the factors and outcomes for MVC deaths and com-\npute correlation functions of states' relative geographic and political positions to elucidate\nthe relative contribution of these factors.

For\nexample, public health problems (e.g., tobacco control and pandemic flu [10\u00ad14]), the spread\nof invasive species driven by the global shipping industry [15], models of energy flows evidenc-\ning climate [16], and analysis of cholera epidemics [17] have already benefitted from these ap-\nproaches. Complex systems tools may be particularly beneficial for the analysis of\npolicymaking among states, as they allow for a quantitative understanding of the complex in-\nteractions within a group of interconnected units (e.g., policymakers) who are responsible for\nthe production of an observable and emergent phenomenon (e.g., state health policy land-\nscape) [18], for example to study the relationship between adopting mandatory seat belt laws\nand preventing injury and death as a result of traffic accidents [19].\nA pressing public health problem is to understand and predict the relationship between al-\ncohol consumption, motor vehicle collisions (MVCs), and traffic fatalities. Although traffic fa-\ntality rates have been halved during the past thirty years, MVCs remain the second largest\ncontributor to years of life lost before age 75 in the US and are the single largest cause of death\namong youth aged fifteen to twenty-four [20, 21]. Moreover, MVC-related death rates vary\nwidely among states, from 0.84 deaths per 100 million vehicle miles of travel in Iowa to 4.35\ndeaths per 100 million vehicle miles of travel in New Jersey.\nAlcohol use is a major contributor to MVCs and was involved in nearly one-third of all fatal\ncrashes in 2009 [22]. Much of the decline in deaths over the past thirty years has been attribut-\ned to more effective state policies regulating motor vehicle safety and reducing drunk driving.\nYet, despite early progress, the rate of alcohol involvement in fatal collisions has remained near\nthis context, we posit that complex systems approaches may offer fundamental insight into\ntemporal and spatial processes underlying the persistence of this public health problem.\nIn this paper, we explore the dynamics of state MVC deaths and the factors associated with\nchanges in death rates over time. We investigate the extent to which a set of key state characteris-\ntics and geographical factors influence MVC deaths. MVC deaths are measured by total counts\nof deaths, rates of deaths per vehicle miles travelled, and the percentage of deaths that are alco-\nhol-related. Explanatory variables comprise the driving volume (the total amount of vehicle\nmiles travelled in each state and year), alcohol consumption (gallons per capita), legislation (the\nproportion of an ensemble of alcohol- and driving-related laws adopted), and political ideology.\nThe relationships between MVC deaths and explanatory variables are studied using structural\nequation models (SEMs) on data from all fifty states over a recent thirty year period. SEMs are se-\nlected as they enable the simultaneous measurement of relationships among multiple indepen-\ndent variables and a dependent variable, which allows for assessing potential confounders\nbetween the variables. Spatial and political measures are leveraged to determine how state geo-\ngraphic and ideological similarities contribute to such relationships. Based on the knowledge that\nthe interactions among states are able to inform their public policies, we expect to find significant\ndependencies between MVC deaths and the selected variables. We further anticipate that states\nthat are geographically closer and ideologically similar exhibit comparable patterns.\nResults\nMVC outcomes and relationship to alcohol\nWe find that MVC deaths, denoted D, have decreased at the national level from 51,050 in 1980\nto 32,788 in 2010. Most states experienced a decline over time, but overall rates varied largely\nInterstate Relationships and US Motor Vehicle Deaths\nby New York University under a SEED grant.

This variation is further demonstrated in Fig 1b, which shows D at three\nnormalized over all states with respect to the annual maximum value; thus, the state with larg-\nest D is shown with a value of 1 and the state with the smallest D is shown with a value of 0 for\neach map, where numerical values are given in the color bar. We consistently see that the large\nand populous states- CA, FL, and TX- have the highest number of MVC deaths. Interestingly,\nalthough NY is both large and populous, it fails to reach similarly high values of D.\nThe percentage of MVC deaths involving alcohol, denoted Da\n, shows similar nationwide\ntween states is generally narrow, see Fig 1c. However, considering Da\nnormalized over all states\nplex than the previous case, see Fig 1d. The patterns among the states do not appear to be con-\nstant over time, nor are they dependent on geographic location over time.\nAssociation between MVC outcomes and potential determinants of\nvariation among states\nWe analyze four state descriptors: vehicle miles travelled (M), per capita alcohol consumption\n(A), the proportion of selected laws related to reducing risky and drunk driving and increasing\ndriver and occupant protection (e.g. seatbelts) (L), and state ideology (I). The state ideology is\nbetween 0 and 1, with 1 indicating most liberal political ideology. The computation of these de-\nscriptors is described in detail in the Materials and Methods section. These quantities are re-\nported nationwide, normalized with respect to the annual maximum values over all states, in\nrized in network form in Fig 3.\nComparing the dependence of D on M, we find significant positive associations when the\nstates are partitioned into decades and when they are combined over the thirty years. From this\nanalysis, we notice that the regression coefficients are positive and decrease in time. Neverthe-\nless, such analysis using the raw number of MVC deaths does not allow for an objective com-\nparison between states of varying populations and geographic sizes. Thus, we consider D/M as\nthe focal outcome in the rest of the analyses, which eliminates the over-emphasis of states with\nhigher populations or more roads.\nStudying the dependence of Da\non the state characteristics, we find a significant association\nwith M over all decades and years and the regression coefficients change through the decades;\nthese negative coefficients increase towards zero over time. The association with A shows sig-\nnificant positive associations over all decades and all years combined. Here, the regression coef-\nficients vary non-monotonically over the decades. Significant negative associations are found\nbetween L and Da\nwhen the decades are considered separately and when all years are com-\nbined. The regression coefficients show a strong increase from the 1980s to the 1990s, after\nwhich they stay approximately constant. Considering Da\n's variation with I, we do not find sig-\nnificant association for any decade, nor when combining all years.\nConsidering the association between D/M and A, L, and I, we find a significant and positive\nassociation with A for all years combined and in the 1980s separately; for the 1990s and the\n2000s, we do not find any association for the regression coefficients. We further find significant\nnegative associations between L and I when the decades are considered separately and when all\nyears are combined. The regression coefficients are negative and increase toward zero with\ntime, by an approximate factor of 1.5 per decade.\nAmong the independent factors in these two SEMs, we find a complex pattern of depen-\ndence among factors and over time. Notably, we see that L has significant positive and negative\nInterstate Relationships and US Motor Vehicle Deaths\nFig 1.

The relationship between A and L is further mirrored in the SEM with D/M. For the\ncomputed errors, we find that the coefficients mitigating possible time-varying confounding\nfactors are relatively small compared to the coefficients between pairs of factors.\nFig 2.

[23], we compute a correlation function to identify trends\nbetween different state characteristics and the MVC outcomes for pairs of states separated by a\ncertain \"distance\". The distance between states is defined in two ways: the location of geograph-\nic state center and the political ideology of the state population. A correlation coefficient is eval-\nuated for all pairs of states separated by a given distance, computed in any of the previously\ndefined outcomes and characteristics.

Fig 4 shows the correlation function computed using geographic and\nideological distances versus D/M, Da\n, M, A, and L.\nConsidering the left column of Fig 4, we find that the outcome D/M and characteristics\nA and L show positive correlations for small geographic distances, indicating that nearby\nstates are more similar than states that are further apart. These short-distance correlations\nvary in time, whereby D/M tends to be more correlated as time increases (greater than\none standard deviation difference in the mean values) and A displays an opposite trend.\nCorrelations of the state characteristics and outcomes generally decrease with increasing\ngeographic distances, converging near zero. In a few cases, such correlations tend to\nnegative values, as for D/M which attains negative values for geographic distances larger\nWhen we use ideological differences to define distances, we uncover strikingly different pat-\nterns than in the previous case, see the right column of Fig 4. For no quantity except D/M do\nwe find any correlation among near neighbors, whereby states which are ideologically similar\ndisplay correlations near zero. Increasing the ideological distance does not produce noticeable\nvariations, except for D/M which attains nonnegligible negative values for distances larger than\n0.3. In contrast to our analysis of geographic distances, the data variation remarkably increases\nwith growing distance. Such wide variations are likely due to the smaller number of state pairs\nwhich are ideologically very dissimilar, see Fig 5.\nDiscussion\nThis study supports the hypothesis that MVC deaths are associated with a set of policy and en-\nvironmental factors, which explains a large proportion of state variations in outcomes. More-\nover, these factors (i.e., M, A, and L) are modified by state characteristics and are influenced by\ngeographic proximity and less so by ideological differences, as demonstrated through the\nSEM results.\nOur results confirm the notion that the main measure of risk of an MVC is the amount of\ntime spent driving and suggest that, in spite of increased driving volume, the risk of MVC\ndeaths has decreased over the past three decades. One explanation for this trend has been the\nincreased attention towards the design of safer vehicles [24]. However, our findings support\nthe importance of regulations promoting safer driving behavior in reducing MVC deaths. Spe-\ncifically, we find that MVC death rate and the proportion of those related to alcohol are nega-\ntively associated with the number of laws aimed at reducing drunk driving and promoting\ndriver and passenger safety. Similarly, we observe that MVC deaths per miles travelled de-\ncreases as the state political ideology grows more liberal, although liberal states do not necessar-\nily have a larger number of laws.\nWe also confirm that the percentage of alcohol-related MVC deaths increases with per\ncapita alcohol consumption [25] in line with intuitive expectations. Interestingly, we further\nobserve that the alcohol-related MVC deaths are negatively associated with driving volume,\nwhereby in states where the amount of driving is higher, the percentage of alcohol-related\nMVC deaths is lower. This evidence is unlikely to be explained by variations in the legisla-\ntion across states, since we find no association between the driving volume and the number\nof laws.\nConsidering results from the geographic analysis, we find that states' physical proximity\nis a predictor of MVC deaths, whereby states that are close by tend to have similar MVC\ndeaths per unit vehicle mile. Likely, this reflects the composition of the transportation infra-\nstructure in the US, where high density urban centers are connected through interstate high-\nways and smaller shared roads, while low traffic volume areas are connected to similar\nInterstate Relationships and US Motor Vehicle Deaths\nFig 4.

The largest four bins are combined to lessen the effect of\nsparse occupancy at large distances, and the value for the correlation function of the set of state pairs in the\ncombined bin is shown at 0.82 on the horizontal axis. Points indicate mean value and error bars one standard\ndeviation taken over selected decade.\nInterstate Relationships and US Motor Vehicle Deaths\nareas. However, the role of physical proximity appears to be secondary in explaining state\ndifferences in alcohol-related deaths. The negative correlation between alcohol-related MVC\ndeaths and traffic volume may be related to the lack of correlation we observe between traffic\nvolume in physically proximal states. It may indicate that alcohol-related MVC deaths are\nassociated with specific driving patterns involving smaller travel distances [26].\nAnother explanation for the importance of physical distances on MVC deaths is the finding\nthat proximal states have similar legal environments. The political science literature suggests\nthat, all else equal, states are more likely to adopt laws that have been successful in another\nstate because this simplifies policymakers' task of finding a solution to a given problem [27,\n28]. There are several reasons why states should cooperate on laws regarding traffic fatalities.\nFirst, roads and highways cross state borders, necessitating communication and coordination\namong law enforcement agencies and state departments of transportation. Second, policy-\nmakers and policy analysts in neighboring states may have opportunities to learn from one\nFig 5.

They may also be more willing to look to neighboring states for solutions\nto policy problems because of regional similarities in populations, geography, or economic cir-\ncumstances. We note that state proximity also predicts similar patterns of alcohol consump-\ntion, reflecting an underlying risk factor for MVC deaths. This could also be a result of the fact\nthat geographically contiguous states necessarily share some aspects of their legal environ-\nments, including alcohol, taxes, and sales restriction.\nIn contrast with our expectations, our results indicate that political ideology is less predic-\ntive of MVC deaths than geography and appears to exert an influence only for states which are\nideologically very different. Specifically, states with different ideologies tend to be negatively\ncorrelated in their MVC deaths, suggesting that differences in political ideology may be associ-\nated with additional risk or protective factors for MVC deaths. One specific pathway identified\nthrough the SEM is that more liberal ideology is positively associated with greater laws in-\ntended to regulate behaviors which may explain its indirect effect on outcomes in different\nstate contexts.\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated that MVC deaths in US are related to multiple factors,\nspanning citizens' and policy makers' behaviors as well as inherent geographical and ideologi-\ncal factors determining state relationships. Moreover, influencing factors are somewhat differ-\nent for MVC deaths overall compared to MVC deaths related to alcohol. This complexity hints\nat the need for stimulating further interdisciplinary research to elucidate the interplay between\nsimilarity and dissimilarity across states in shaping public health problems in the US.\nMaterials and Methods\nDatasets\nThe study uses data from the State Health Policy Research Dataset (SHePRD), which includes\nthrough ICPSR and includes data retrieved, validated, standardized, and merged from public\nuse datasets, as well as original legal research. The data included in analysis of vehicle miles\ntravelled, and state alcohol consumption are obtained from the NHTSA. MVC deaths per state\ncome from the Fatal Accident Reporting System (FARS). MVC deaths are taken as total counts\nof annual deaths per state and the percentage of deaths that are alcohol-related. Total vehicle\nmiles travelled is the statewide annual sum of the average amount of time motor vehicles are\non the road multiplied by the length of roadway. This measure takes into account both the\ntypes of vehicles and the types of roadways on which they typically drive and it is officially\ncomputed for each state by the NHTSA. Alcohol consumption is the annual gallons of alcohol\nsold per capita. Laws were selected for inclusion in the dataset if there was evidence of their ef-\nfectiveness in reducing morbidity and mortality in the literature. Binary variables in the dataset\nindicate the presence or absence of each law in each state and year during the study period and\nthe proportion of these laws adopted (ranging from zero to one) is taken as an annual\nstate descriptor.\nState ideology measures the average location of the elected officials in each state on a liberal-\nconservative continuum based on weighted ideology scores for the governor and the major\nparty delegations in each house of the state legislature derived from interest group ratings,\nopinion polls, and roll call data. The scale ranges from zero (representing the most conservative\nvalue) to one hundred (representing the most liberal position) and directly follows the proce-\ndure in [27]. However, this quantity is normalized between zero and one for the purposes of\nthis study. We used the haversine formula to compute the distances between state geographic\nInterstate Relationships and US Motor Vehicle Deaths\ncenters; Alaska and Hawaii were excluded from this calculation since they would result in arti-\nficially large distances. Statistics on the data used for the analysis are given in Table 2.\nAnalysis and statistics\nWe specify three structural equation models [30] to extract the associations between state char-\nacteristics and outcomes with p-values less than 0.01 and 0.05 used for significance; these mod-\nels are shown in Eqs (1), (2), and (3) below. To ensure the feasibility of this analysis, and in\nparticular that the covariance matrix of all variables is well-conditioned, we normalize each\nvariable (D, Da\n, M, A, L, and I) between zero and one by dividing each variable by its largest\nvalue over the thirty year interval. The normalization allows us to compare the relative highs\nand lows of the variables with each other and, as a result, we expect that the trends we find are\nvalid for both the scaled and unscaled data. The consistency of behavior in the raw and normal-\nized data can be seen by comparing rows in Table 2.\nThe three SEMs consider the state characteristics and outcomes as measured variables,\nwhich may be influenced by error terms defined as exogenous latent variables. This formu-\nlation is a special case of the general SEM called a simultaneous equation model [31]. In\naddition to the linear relationships between the measured variables, each model contains a\nconstant intercept term to account for a constant off-set between the variables in the re-\ngression analysis [32]. The models are specified as follows. The dependence of D on M is\ncomputed using a SEM with the following straightforward equation defined for each state:\nD\ni\n\u00bc aM\ni\ni\nwhere Di\nis the normalized raw number of MVC deaths in year i, Mi\nis the normalized vehi-\ncle miles travelled in year i, 2i\nis a time-varying error, and , , and  are the coefficients\ncomputed by the SEM. The dependence of Da\non all the state characteristics, and their in-\nterdependences, are computed using a SEM which simultaneously regresses the system of\nTable 2.

This analysis is performed using the statistics software R (ver-\nsion 3.1.2) [33] with both built-in functions [32] and the associated lavaan package for\nSEM [33, 34]. The models and statistical significances of the coefficients are reported in\nTable 1, along with network representations of the models in Fig 3.\nFollowing the analysis in Gallos et al. [23], we define the correlation function as\nC r\n\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc\nP\nij\n\u00f0x\ni\n\u00c0 x\u00c3\u00de\u00f0x\nj\n\u00c0 x\u00c3\u00ded\u00f0r\nij\n\u00c0 r\u00de\nP\nij\nd\u00f0r\nij\n\u00c0 r\u00de\nwhere xi\nis the outcome or characteristic of state i, x\u00c3 is the mean outcome or characteristic\nover all states, rij\nis the distance between state i and state j, 2 is the variance\nP\n\u00f0x\ni\n is the delta symbol taking the value one if its argument is zero and being zero otherwise, and\ni,j = 1,. . .,50. We note that the argument of the  function is equal to zero when the distance be-\ntween state i and state j is equal to the target distance set by the argument of the C function. As\nwith the correlation coefficient, large magnitude values indicate a strong correlation and values\nclose to zero indicate a weak correlation. However, C(r) may take values greater than one, since\nthe mean and variance are taken over all states, but the delta function selects only a subset of\nthese as summands. To facilitate comparison of results using both geographic and ideological\ndistances, we normalize the pairwise distances between 0 and 1 by dividing all distances by the\nlargest value in each case. The normalized distances are combined in eleven equal bins, and the\nlargest four bins are merged to lessen the effect of data sparseness at large distances. This analy-\nsis is performed with the computing software MATLAB, version 2013b. We note that this cor-\nrelation analysis is performed on the un-normalized values of each variable.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceived and designed the experiments: NA JM DS MP.
