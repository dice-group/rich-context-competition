Participants (N  532) aged 45\u00ad87 years from the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging\nwere assessed with a Swedish version of the National Geographic Smell Survey. Both detection and identification\nof olfactory information were impaired with age. Gender had no effect on detection or identification. Hierarchi-\ncal regressions revealed that proficiency in semantic memory, intensity perception, and personality style (i.e.,\nneuroticism, impulsivity, and lack of assertiveness) were potent predictors for successful odor identification, even\nwhen individual variations in chronological age, sex, education, and global cognitive functioning were taken into\naccount.\nGING is often accompanied by impairments in various\nsensory and cognitive aspects of olfactory functioning.\nOlder adults exhibit a lower sensitivity for odors, as re-\nflected in absolute threshold measurements (e.g., Cain &\nand in intensity measures of suprathreshold odors (Stevens\n& Cain, 1985). Likewise, older adults' recognition memory\nfor odors is poorer than that observed in young adults (Lars-\nson & B\u00e4ckman, 1993; Murphy, Cain, Gilmore, & Skinner,\n1991), as is their ability to name or identify olfactory infor-\nmation. The latter is true for both free identification mea-\nsures (Schemper, Voss, & Cain, 1981) and tasks where mul-\ntiple choices of possible odor names are available (Doty et\nAn important research issue has been to establish whether\nincreased sensory problems, cognitive changes, or both\ncause the observed age-related deficits in odor recognition\nmemory and odor identification.

By defini-\ntion, odor identification is a semantic memory task, in that it\nrefers to an individual's general knowledge or experience\ntherefore of interest to examine whether proficiency in odor\nidentification relates to performance in other tasks that tap\nsemantic memory (e.g., vocabulary and information). Of\nfurther interest is to determine whether odor identification is\nrelated to performance in other cognitive domains, such as\nperformance in short-term memory, episodic memory, and\nvisuospatial functioning. Finding reliable relationships be-\ntween measures of semantic memory and odor identification,\nand nonsignificant relationships between measures of other\ncognitive functions and odor identification, would strengthen\nthe hypothesis that complex verbal intellectual abilities and\nodor identification tap the same cognitive domain.\nIn addition to cognitive variables, research suggests a\npossible role for personality measures in the prediction of\nodor performance. Perceptual abilities are associated with\ncertain personality traits such as extraversion (Stelmack &\nMichaud-Achorn, 1985). Little is known as to whether vari-\nous personality styles influence olfactory functions, and the\nsparse evidence presents a mixed pattern of results. In an\nearly study, Koelega (1970) reported that participants who\nscored high in extraversion also exhibited a higher olfactory\nsensitivity, whereas neuroticism was unrelated to odor per-\nception. In a related study, which focused on subjective ex-\nperiences (i.e., intensity, pleasantness, and familiarity) of\nolfactory information, no relationship between perceptual\nexperience and degree of extraversion was found (Filsinger,\nFabes, & Hughston, 1987). In contrast, Pause, Ferstl, and\nFehm-Wolfsdorf (1998) reported that neuroticism was a\nstronger predictor for olfactory sensitivity than was extra-\nversion. This latter finding is in congruence with research\nfocused on emotional (personal) styles and olfactory sensi-\nA\ntivity. Olfactory sensitivity for octanol was examined in\nhigh- and low-anxiety women, and the results showed that\nhighly anxious women had reliably higher thresholds than\ndid women low in anxiety (Rovee, Harris, & Yopp, 1973).\nIn a similar vein, Herbener, Kagan, and Cohen (1989) re-\nported that level of shyness (introversion) was related to\nodor thresholds; participants high in shyness had lower ol-\nfactory thresholds for butanol than participants with low\nshyness scores.\nA number of studies have indicated that women perform\nbetter in olfactory tasks than do men and that the general fe-\nmale superiority is valid throughout the human adult life\nfenbach, 1993). However, Ship, Pearson, Cruise, Brant, and\nMetter (1996) found that men might show a more precipi-\ntous and earlier decline in smell identification than do\nwomen, implicating an age by gender interaction in olfac-\ntory performance. It is still unknown why women show this\nsuperiority, but gender-related differences in factors such\nas hormones (estrogens, progesterone), environmental back-\nground, and verbal fluency might play a role. Two of our pur-\nposes in the present study were to examine further whether\nwomen perform better than men in the second half of the life\nspan and also to investigate the possibility of age by gender\ninteractions in odor detection and odor identification.\nIn the present study we assessed a subsample of 532 par-\nticipants from the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging\n(SATSA; Pedersen et al., 1991) with a Swedish version of\nthe National Geographic Smell Survey (Wysocki & Gilbert,\n1989) with a particular focus on odor detection and odor\nidentification abilities. All participants were also provided\nwith a series of questionnaires concerning health, personal-\nity, and lifestyle variables (e.g., smoking behavior) and\nwere also tested across a number of cognitive domains.\nOn the basis of these data, we examined: (a) the influence\nof age and gender on odor detection and odor identification,\n(b) the relationship between odor identification ability and\nperformance in various cognitive tasks, (c) the influence of\npersonality on olfactory functioning and (d) the relative pre-\ndictive value of individual differences in demographic, cog-\nnitive, perceptual, and personality variables on odor identi-\nfication.\nMETHODS\nParticipants\nAs noted, the sample was a subset of twins from the pop-\nulation-based Swedish Twin Registry (Cederl\u00f6f & Lorich,\nboth questionnaire and in-person testing assessments (in-\nperson assessments also included a questionnaire). In the\ncurrent analyses, we used data collected during the third\nwave of questionnaires (in 1990) and the second wave of in-\nin a location convenient to the participants, such as district\nnurses' offices, health care schools, and long-term care clin-\nics. The testing session also incorporated a health examina-\ntion, and the visit lasted approximately 4 h.\nThe smell survey was mailed with the 1990 questionnaire\nto the subset of 606 participants who had completed the first\npleted surveys were returned. Because olfactory abilities are\nknown to be severely affected by dementia (e.g., Larsson et\nipants suffering from Alzheimer's disease, vascular demen-\ntia, or unspecified dementia were excluded (n  26). Thus,\nthe remaining sample involved 506 adults, ranging in age\nwere female. Characteristics of the sample are provided in\nTable 1. Education was rated on a 4-point scale (1  com-\npletion of elementary school, 2  completion of vocational\nhigh school, 3  \"gymnasium\" or academic high school, 4 \nuniversity studies or higher). To assess global level of cog-\nnitive functioning and screen for severe cognitive im-\npairment, all participants completed the Mini-Mental State\nExamination (MMSE; Folstein, Folstein, & McHugh, 1975).\nWe used the SUMILL scale, which surveys the number of\norgan systems reported to be affected by a chronic health\nproblem, to measure general health. The scale incorporates\nmeasures of 13 organ systems, including cardiovascular,\nrespiratory, musculoskeletal, and central nervous system\ndisorders. An individual's score is the summed total of or-\ngan systems reported to be affected by at least one chronic\nhealth problem (Harris, Pedersen, McClearn, Plomin, &\nsample with an average value of about 3. Use of cigarettes,\ncigars, and pipes was included in the calculation of pack-\nyears (Kendler, Karkowski, & Pedersen, in press). Cigar\nand pipe tobacco consumptions were converted to cigarette\nequivalents (e.g., one cigar was equivalent to four cigarettes).\nMeasures\nOlfactory test.--We used a Swedish version of the Na-\ntional Geographic Smell Survey to evaluate olfaction. The\noriginal smell survey was inserted into each copy of the\nSeptember 1986 issue of National Geographic magazine,\nand 1.42 million respondents were registered. The precise\nmethods, technical features (e.g., odor concentrations and\ncomplete questionnaire), and data from the respondents are\navailable elsewhere (Corwin, Loury, & Gilbert, 1995; Rus-\nversion, a translation of the questions was attached to the\noriginal National Geographic scratch-and-sniff forms.\nTable 1. Participant Characteristics\nCharacteristic M SD\nNote: MMSE = Mini-Mental State Examination (Folstein et al., 1975).\naEducation is rated on a scale from 1 (elementary school) to 4 (university or\nhigher).\nbSUMILL is a summary of illnesses incorporating measures of 13 organ sys-\ntems.\ncPack-years is an index of tobacco use, where cigarettes, cigars, and pipes are\nincluded.\nThe smell survey comprised six scratch-and-sniff mi-\ncroencapsulated odorants: androstenone, amyl acetate, Gal-\naxolideTM, eugenol, mercaptans, and rose. Two of these\nodorants are food related: amyl acetate, which has a banana-\nor pear-like fruity odor, and eugenol, a major constituent of\nclove oil. Mercaptans is a highly unpleasant sulfurous com-\npound that is added to natural gas as a warning odor. Syn-\nthetic rose is a pleasant, familiar non food odor. Galax-\nolideTM is a widely used synthetic musk that is often added\nto perfumes. Finally, the compound androstenone is a vola-\ntile steroid metabolite produced by many mammals, includ-\ning humans. Men produce more androstenone than women\ndo, but the compound may be extracted from the urine and\nsweat of both sexes.\nRespondents were asked to scratch and sniff each odor\npanel and to answer a number of questions, including: \"Did\nyou smell something (yes or no)?\" \"Did it smell good or bad\n(1  very unpleasant, 5  very pleasant)?\" \"How intense is\nthis odor (1  very weak, 5  very strong)?\" For odor iden-\ntification, respondents were instructed to select one of the\nfollowing alternatives: floral, musky, urine, foul, ink, spicy,\nwoody, fruity, burnt, sweet, other (if other: What?). Survey\ndesigners chose the descriptors to provide generic, nonover-\nlapping designations of odor quality (Russell et al., 1993;\nWysocki & Gilbert, 1989). In the present study, we used the\nstandards provided by Wysocki and Gilbert (1989) to score\nodor identification. If a respondent provided a veridical la-\nbel of the odor, the response was counted as correct. Also, if\na respondent chose a near-miss label such as banana candy\nfor amyl acetate, it was coded as correct. If a respondent de-\ntected an odorant but was unable to identify it, then the\nidentification response was scored incorrect.\nFor the analyses, data were summarized across odorants\nand four measures were obtained: number of odorants de-\ntected (odor detection), number of odorants correctly identi-\nfied (odor identification), mean pleasantness rating, and\nmean intensity rating.\nCognitive measures.--The cognitive battery in SATSA\nwas selected to provide representation of both the domains\nof fluid (figure logic, Koh's block design, card rotations)\nand crystallized (information, synonyms, analogies, Thur-\nstone's memory) intelligence (Horn, 1982). In addition, the\nbattery included measures tapping specific cognitive do-\nmains such as short-term memory (digit span forward and\nbackward), perceptual speed (digit symbol, figure identifi-\ncation), and episodic memory (names and faces). A more\ndetailed description of the cognitive tests included in\nSATSA is available in Pedersen, Plomin, Nesselroade, and\nPersonality tests.--Five scales taken from different per-\nsonality inventories were used in the SATSA battery: extra-\nversion, neuroticism, lack of assertiveness, impulsivity, and\nopenness to experience. The personality traits extraversion\nand neuroticism were measured with a short form of the\nEysenck Personality Inventory (Floderus, 1974). Each scale\nscore is based on the sum of 0 (no) and 1 (yes) responses to\nnine items. Two subscales from the Karolinska Scales of\nPersonality were also included in the SATSA battery: the\nLack of Assertiveness scale and the Impulsivity scale\nLack of Assertiveness scale is composed of 10 items (e.g.,\n\"If I'm treated badly at a restaurant I don't like to complain\"\nand \"When someone teases me I can never think of a good\nanswer until afterwards\"). The Impulsivity scale score con-\nsists of the sum of responses to each of 10 items on a\n5-point Likert scale. The impulsivity items mainly reflect\nacting on the spur of the moment and rapid decision making\n(e.g., \"I often rush into new things\" or \"When I make deci-\nsions I usually do it quickly\"). Finally, a shortened version\nof the Openness to Experience scale (25 of the original 48\nitems) from the NEO Personality Inventory was used (Costa\ndomain taps proactive seeking and appreciation of experi-\nence for its own sake, on the basis of characteristics such as\nopenness to feelings, new ideas, flexibility of thought, and\nreadiness to indulge in fantasy (McCrae & Costa, 1985).\nRESULTS\nAge and Olfactory Performance\nFor the analyses of overall age and gender effects on odor\ndetection and odor identification, the sample was divided\ninto two age groups: young-old adults (M  58.6, SD  5.3,\nrange 66\u00ad87 years). The total number of odors detected and\nthe total number of correct identifications for each individ-\nual were analyzed with separate 2 (Age: young-old, old) \n2 (Gender: male, female) analyses of variance.\nThe older age group detected fewer of the odorants,\ndetection (p  .40). The interaction between age and gender\nwas not significant (F  1). The oldest participants identi-\n.005, and men and women did not differ in identification\nperformance (p  .10). The interaction between age and\ngender also was not significant (F  1).\nSeparate correlations between age and odor detection for\neach odor, with gender and pack-years partialed out, indi-\ncated that increasing age was associated with an impaired\nability to detect mercaptans (r  .10, p  .05) and Galax-\nolideTM (r  .11, p  .01). No other correlations were sig-\nnificant. There were two significant correlations between\nage and odor identification across odor stimuli, suggesting\nthat aging may be associated with a better ability to identify\nthe smell of amyl acetate (r  .10, p  .05) and lesser abil-\nity to identify mercaptans or gas (r  .24, p  .001).\nDiseases and Olfactory Performance\nTo investigate the relationship between a number of dis-\neases and performance in the olfactory tasks, we performed\na series of correlations with age, sex, and pack-years par-\ntialed out. The general health measure--SUMILL--was un-\nrelated to both odor detection and odor identification. Sepa-\nrate analyses for a number of diseases (i.e., central nervous\nsystem (CNS) disorders, diabetes, epilepsy, metabolic dis-\norders, respiratory disorders, and stroke) revealed that only\nCNS disorders were reliably related to impairments in odor\ndetection ( p  .05) and that epilepsy was associated with an\nimpaired ability to identify olfactory information (p  .05),\nwhich is consistent with earlier observations (Savic, Book-\nCognitive Functioning and Olfactory Performance\nThe relationships between performance in the cognitive\nmeasures and the olfactory tasks, partialed by pack-years,\nare displayed in Table 2. None of the cognitive tests were\nrelated to odor detection performance. However, odor iden-\ntification was reliably and positively related to performance\nin tasks tapping crystallized intelligence and semantic mem-\nory functions (i.e., analogies, synonyms, information, Thur-\nstone's memory), and one measure of perceptual speed (i.e.,\ndigit symbol). No significant relationships were observed\nfor any of the measures of fluid intelligence, short-term\nmemory, and episodic memory.\nPersonality and Olfactory Performance\nPartial correlations between odor detection and odor\nidentification and the various personality measures are dis-\nplayed in Table 3. The correlations, corrected for pack-\nyears, indicated that none of the personality measures were\nsignificantly related to odor detection. However, odor iden-\ntification was reliably and negatively associated with impul-\nsivity, suggesting that individuals high in impulsivity score\nlower in odor identification (p  .001). Also, the personal-\nity scale measuring lack of assertiveness showed a negative\nassociation with odor identification (p  .001), implying\nthat individuals with a greater lack of assertiveness also per-\nform more poorly in odor identification. Individuals with high\nscores in the openness to experience domain identified more\nodors than did individuals low in openness to experience, as\nreflected by a significant positive relationship (p  .01).\nPredictors of Odor Identification\nTo examine the influence of individual differences in the\ndemographic, cognitive, perceptual, and personality vari-\nables on odor identification, we conducted a hierarchical re-\ngression analysis. Only those variables that were signifi-\ncantly correlated (p  .01) with the dependent measure at\nthe zero-order level were entered in the analysis. Also, we\nwanted to explore the relative importance of hedonic value\nand perceived intensity for successful odor identification.\nThe predictor variables were entered in the following order:\nage, sex, education, MMSE, semantic memory, hedonics,\nperceived intensity, and personality. In this way we could\ndetermine whether semantic memory proficiency, percep-\ntual experience, and personality style still made a significant\ncontribution to odor identification, even with individual\nvariation in demographic variables and MMSE scores taken\ninto account. The semantic memory variables and the per-\nsonality scales were entered as two separate blocks in the\nregression. Table 4 depicts the hierarchical regression for\nodor identification.\nAs can be seen in Table 4, the independent variables ac-\ncounted for 13% of the variance in odor identification. Of\nthe eight variables, four made a significant contribution to\nperformance in the criterion task: age, semantic memory\nproficiency, perceived intensity, and personality.\nThe shared variance between odor identification and the\nsemantic memory measures suggests that these measures\ntap the same cognitive domain. Also, all beta weights, ex-\ncept the one for synonyms, were positive, indicating that\nhigher proficiency in semantic memory tasks was related to\nbetter performance in odor identification.\nPerceived pleasantness of an odorant was unrelated to\nidentification, whereas the degree of perceived intensity\nwas strongly and positively related to identification perfor-\nmance (R2  .03). Interestingly, personality traits contrib-\nuted significantly to the variance (R2  .04) despite the pre-\nvious inclusion of demographic and cognitive variables.\nNeuroticism, impulsivity, and lack of assertiveness were reli-\nable predictors for odor identification, whereas extraversion\nand openness to experience were not.\nDISCUSSION\nOur purpose in this work was to further the understanding\nof the nature of age-related deficits in odor identification. In\nagreement with prior evidence, the results indicate substan-\ntial age-related impairments in both odor detection and odor\nimportant finding is the reliable positive relationship be-\ntween general semantic knowledge and proficiency in odor\nidentification. The observation that performance in fluid in-\ntelligence, short-term memory, and episodic memory was\nunrelated to odor identification provides a strengthening of\nthe view that odor identification and semantic memory pro-\nficiency in general tap the same cognitive domain (Larsson,\n1997). This finding is highlighted by the fact that semantic\nmemory proficiency still remained a significant predictor\nfor odor identification performance, despite statistical con-\ntrol for the effects of chronological age, sex, education, and\nTable 2.

Also,\nnone of the cognitive measures were related to proficiency\nin odor detection, suggesting that the two olfactory tasks\nmeasure two separate entities.\nIn contrast to earlier findings of gender differences in ol-\nfactory sensitivity and identification (e.g., Barber, 1997;\nable influence of gender on the two olfactory measures, al-\nthough women were slightly better at odor identification.\nFurthermore, contrary to the findings reported by Ship and\ncolleagues (1996), we did not find any evidence of age by\ngender interactions in odor detection or odor identification\nabilities. However, the observations by Ship were based on\nlongitudinal data, whereas our findings were cross-sec-\ntional, making it impossible to disentangle true aging effects\nfrom cohort membership.\nOne factor that has been proven to influence olfactory\nfunctioning is health status (Schiffman, 1992). Our results\nsuggest that general health, as measured by SUMILL, is un-\nrelated to both olfactory measures. However, separate anal-\nyses for the different diseases showed that CNS disorders\naffected odor detection negatively and that participants suf-\nfering from epilepsy exhibited greater difficulties in identi-\nfying the odorants, in accordance with a number of earlier\ntion that needs to be further explored in future research con-\ncerns pharmaceutical use and its potential impact on olfac-\ntory functioning.\nAge deficits in olfactory abilities were not uniform across\nodorants. Available knowledge on heterogeneous age ef-\nfects for different odors is sparse. However, Wysocki and\nGilbert (1989) reported that the shape of the age-response\ncurve in both odor detection and identification varied across\ndifferent odorants. Our data suggest that the ability to iden-\ntify amyl acetate improves with age; however, this finding\nis in contrast with earlier evidence (Wysocki & Gilbert,\n1989), and additional work is needed to clarify the validity\nof this finding. Nevertheless, replicating earlier findings, we\nfound evidence that age takes a particular toll in the ability\nboth to detect and to identify the smell of mercaptans, the\nwarning agent in natural gas (Cain, Gent, & Cometto-Muniz,\nrecent neurological data showing that brain responses for\nnatural gas odor, as measured by olfactory event-related po-\ntentials, change across the life span. Specifically, older\nadults display lower N1/P2 amplitudes, which suggest a di-\nminished sensitivity, and increased P3 latencies, which sug-\ngest a slower cognitive processing for gas odor (Madowitz\n& Geisler, 1998). Failure to perceive and to identify the\nsmell of mercaptans may be a potential public safety prob-\nlem, and the present data indicate that older householders\nare selectively affected.\nAs noted earlier, not much is known concerning relation-\nships between personality factors and olfactory abilities\n(Pause et al., 1998). Surprisingly, odor identification perfor-\nmance was associated with personality dimensions such as\nneuroticism, impulsivity, and lack of assertiveness. Control-\nling for individual variation in demographic and cognitive\nabilities did not negate the impact of these personality fac-\ntors on odor identification.\nParticipants with high scores in neuroticism (emotional-\nity) also identified more odors correctly. Olfactory neuroim-\naging research has revealed that olfactory information pro-\ncessing relies heavily on neuroanatomical structures within\nthe limbic system, such as the amygdala, enthorinal cortex,\nand insula (Levy et al., 1997; Zald, Donndelinger, & Pardo,\n1998). In a similar vein, it has been proposed that emotion-\nally highly reactive individuals show a higher activation\nwithin the limbic system and that anxious individuals show\nhigher reactivity of the Behavioral Inhibition System, which\nrelates to limbic structures (Eysenck & Eysenck, 1985;\nGray, 1990). Given the strong dependency between limbic\nstructures and olfactory functions, it is not surprising that\nindividuals high in emotional reactivity also would excel in\nThe predictive power of personality styles such as impul-\nsivity and lack of assertiveness on odor identification are in-\ntriguing. Both dimensions were negatively related to odor\nidentification. More impulsive individuals may be more\nnegligent in the task situation, whereas persons exhibiting\nlack of assertiveness may be indecisive in answering, which\nultimately may affect their level of performance. However,\nfull understanding of these findings remains unclear and\nneeds further exploration.\nThe strong influence of intensity perception on odor iden-\ntification (Stevens & Cain, 1985) is of note. Perceived in-\ntensity played a major role in predicting odor naming, even\nwhen age-related variation was accounted for. This outcome\nsuggests that individual variation in intensity perception is a\nmajor constituent for successful odor identification and\nshould be taken into account in studies evaluating profi-\nciency in odor identification.\nIn summary, this work has replicated and extended the\nunderstanding of age-related deficits in odor identification.\nIn agreement with earlier findings, the present results indi-\ncate an age-related deterioration in both odor detection and\nTable 4.

However, in contrast to odor identifica-\ntion, odor detection was unrelated to cognitive parameters\nand personality traits. Four potent factors for successful\nodor identification were identified: age, semantic memory\naptitude, intensity perception, and personality style. The\nfact that proficiency in odor identification was unrelated to\nfluid intelligence, short-term memory, and episodic memory\nstrengthens the notion that semantic memory (i.e., crystal-\nlized intelligence) and odor identification tap the same cog-\nnitive domain.\n"
