CAD was evaluated using multislice\ncomputed tomography. Intima\u00admedia thickness (IMT) of the carotid artery was evaluated via\nultrasonography.\nand three-vessel CAD, respectively. Diabetes mellitus, maximal IMT and hyperhomocysteinaemia\nwere independently related to the presence of CAD.\nConclusions: The prevalence of CAD was 32.3% in Chinese patients with PAF. Carotid stenosis\nand CAD co-occurred in 7.8% of patients, and the prevalence of carotid stenosis correlated with\nthe severity of CAD. Screening of carotid stenosis is recommended, especially in patients with PAF\nand multivessel CAD.\n",

PAF was defined as self-terminating\nepisodes of AF lasting 7 days. Patients\nwith previously diagnosed or previously\nexcluded CAD, dilated or hypertrophic\ncardiomyopathy or contraindications to\nMSCT were excluded, in addition to\npatients who were not in sinus rhythm\nduring MSCT examination.\nAll patients provided written informed\nconsent prior to enrolment and the study\nwas approved by the ethics committee of\nZhengzhou People's Hospital, Zhengzhou,\nHenan, China.\nProatherogenic risk factors\nData regarding proatherogenic risk factors\nwere collected before MSCT. These included\nsex, age, body mass index (BMI), hyperten-\nsion (systolic blood pressure ! 140 mmHg or\ndiastolic blood pressure ! 90 mmHg or\nreceiving antihypertensive medication), dia-\nbetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia (low-density\nlipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C]; triglycer-\nide [TG], high-density lipoprotein choles-\nterol [HDL-C]), smoking, family history of\nCAD, estimated glomerular Eltration rate\n(eGFR, calculated using the modification of\ndiet in renal disease formula),16 hyperhomo-\ncysteinaemia (HHcY; total plasma homo-\ncysteine [tHcy] !12.0 mmol/l), and previous\ntransient ischaemic attack or stroke.\nCoronary angiography\nMultislice computed tomography coronary\nangiograms were obtained with 64-slice\nscanners (LightSpeed VCT, GE Medical\nSystems, Slough, UK) to determine the\npresence of CAD. Both the original axial\ndataset and curved multiplanar reconstruc-\ntions were used. CAD was defined as lumen\ndiameter stenosis > 50% in ! 1 major cor-\nonary artery. Patients were classified accord-\ning to the number of diseased vessels\npresent: one-vessel disease; two-vessel dis-\nease (disease in two vessels or left main trunk\ndisease without right coronary artery sten-\nosis); three-vessel disease (disease in three\nvessels or left main trunk disease with right\ncoronary artery stenosis).\nCarotid atherosclerosis\nCarotid artery atherosclerosis was evaluated\nwithin one month before coronary MCST\nusing duplex ultrasonography with a 10-\nMHz linear array transducer. Scanning of\nthe extracranial common carotid artery\n(CCA), the carotid bulb (Bul), and the\ninternal carotid artery (ICA) in the neck\nwas performed bilaterally in three longitu-\ndinal and transverse projections, and the site\nof greatest intima\u00admedia thickness (IMT)\nincluding plaque lesions was sought along\nthe arterial walls using B-mode and colour\nDoppler ultrasound. Max-IMT was defined\nas the largest carotid IMT in the observed\nareas of the CCA, Bul and ICA.17 Carotid\nstenosis was defined as atherosclerotic area\nstenosis of > 50% or peak systolic velocity\nof > 200 cm/s on the above carotid arteries.\nAll scans were conducted by experienced\nlaboratory technicians and physicians who\nhad no prior knowledge of the patient's\nclinical characteristics.\nStatistical analyses\nData were expressed as mean \u00c6 SD for\ncontinuous variables and n (%) for categor-\nical variables. Normally distributed data\nwere analysed using unpaired Student's t-\ntest, 2-test or Fisher's exact test, as appro-\npriate. Mann\u00adWhitney U-test was used\nwhen data deviated from a Gaussian distri-\nbution (evaluated via Kolmogorov\u00adSmirnov\ntest). Multivariate stepwise logistic regres-\nsion analysis was applied to evaluate the\nrelationship between demographic and clin-\nical data and the presence of CAD. Data\nwere analysed using SPSS\u00d5 version 11.0\n(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for\nWindows\u00d5. P-values< 0.05 were considered\nstatistically significant.\nResults\nThe study included 192 patients with PAF\nyears; age range 55\u00ad81 years).

The\nprevalence of CAD in the present study was\n32.3%, consistent with that of Western\ncountries, and may be related to the inclu-\nsion of patients with suspected CAD ele-\nvated risk profiles (including a Western-type\nlifestyle). Of the 62 patients diagnosed with\nmultivessel disease that may require percu-\ntaneous coronary intervention or coronary\nartery bypass graft (CABG). Once diag-\nnosed with AF, the presence of CAD has\nbeen shown to be related to recurrent AF\nepisodes,21 presence of arrhythmia, heart\nfailure and angina,22 and increased risk of\ndeath.23,24 Epidemiological data have indi-\ncated that ischaemic heart disease is one of\nthe most common underlying causes of\ndeath among patients with AF.25\nFew studies have investigated the rela-\ntionship between AF and carotid athero-\nsurvey, subjects with carotid atheroscler-\nosis were more likely to develop AF than\nthose without the condition.11 Increased\nIMT and arterial stiffness have been found\nto be associated with lone AF,10 and\npatients with AF have a substantially\nhigher risk of stroke and death after\ncarotid endarterectomy.26 A prospective\nstudy reported that carotid stenosis (40\u00ad\n100%) and AF were signiEcant independ-\nent risk factors for new thromboembolic\npatients with PAF had carotid stenosis,\nand 24.2% of patients with PAF and CAD\nhad concomitant carotid stenosis. It is well\nestablished that patients with `significant'\ncarotid stenosis have an increased risk of\nstroke after CABG, and CAD is the most\ncommon cause of morbidity and mortality\nfollowing carotid artery endovascular\nDiabetes mellitus, IMT and HHcY were\nindependent predictors of CAD in the pre-\nsent study. Diabetes mellitus is known to be\nan independent predictor of CAD and is\nassociated with more advanced CAD.30\nCAD is a major cause of death and impaired\nHRQoL in patients with type 2 diabetes\nmellitus, and is generally detected at an\nadvanced, symptomatic stage.17 The early\ndetection of CAD is therefore critical in the\nmanagement of these patients. Carotid IMT\n(a marker of early atherosclerosis and vas-\ncular remodelling that can be assessed\nquickly, noninvasively, and cheaply with\nhigh-resolution ultrasonography) is corre-\nlated with conventional coronary risk fac-\ntors and is associated with cardiovascular\nevents and extent of CAD among patients\nwith known or suspected CAD or type 2\nistic curve analyses revealed that the area\nunder the curve was higher for max-IMT\nthan for mean-IMT.31 In type 2 diabetic\npatients without apparent cardiovascular\ndisease, the addition of max-IMT to con-\nventional risk factors substantially improves\nthe risk stratiEcation for CAD.17 Studies\nhave indicated that tHcy concentrations are\ncorrelated with coronary atherosclerosis and\nstroke, and can be used to predict mortality\nHHcY can predict the presence of CAD\nand tHcy levels are signiEcantly associated\nwith the extent of coronary atherosclerosis\nin patients with carotid stenosis.33\nThe present study has several limitations.\nFirst, the study population included con-\nsecutive patients with PAF alone, and our\nfindings may not be applicable to those with\nnonparoxysmal AF. Secondly, the nonran-\ndomized design of this single-centre investi-\ngation may have influenced the comparative\nanalysis. Thirdly, no prognostic data were\navailable. A larger study with follow-up\ndata may provide more conclusive informa-\ntion. While caution is therefore needed in the\ninterpretation of our data, we consider it\nimprobable that these limitations have influ-\nenced our main findings.\nIn conclusion, the prevalence of CAD\nwas 32.3% in Chinese patients with PAF\npresenting without previously diagnosed or\nexcluded CAD. Carotid stenosis and CAD\nco-occurred in 7.8% of patients, and the\nprevalence of carotid stenosis correlated\nwith the severity of CAD. Diabetes mellitus,\nIMT and HHcY were independently related\nto the presence of CAD. Screening of\ncarotid stenosis is recommended, especially\nin patients with PAF and multivessel CAD.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThe present study was supported by the Cutting-\nedge and Basic Research Project of Henan\nReferences\n1.
