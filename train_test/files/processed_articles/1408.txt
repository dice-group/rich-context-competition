Adjusting\nfor demographic attributes, parental monitoring, parental\ncurfews,andfamilyroutines,remaininginout-of-homecare\nor self-care was associated with a 2.5 times (95% confi-\ndence interval, 1.3-5.1 times) increase in the likelihood of\ninitiating sexual intercourse when compared with being at\nhome with an adult at both assessment times.\nConclusion: Policies and programs that enable young\nadolescents to spend their out-of-school hours at home\nwith an adult may help reduce the risk of early sex ini-\ntiation among youth in low-income urban areas.\ntion of adolescents initiat-\ning sex before they are in\nninth grade declined from\nreasons to continue to focus on early sex\ninitiation among adolescents. Adoles-\ncents who engage in sexual intercourse at\nan early age experience increased risks of\nhaving multiple sexual partners2,3 and us-\ning contraception irregularly4 and, in turn,\nface heightened risks of experiencing un-\nplanned pregnancies and acquiring sexu-\nally transmitted infections.5\nMuch of the research exploring social\ncontextual influences on early sex among\nadolescents has focused on risks related\nto parenting practices and neighborhood\nconditions.6,7 Virtually none of this con-\ntextual research has considered how care\narrangements during out-of-school hours\n(ie, after school and during the summer)\naffect the probability that a young person\nhas sex at an early age. This is despite the\nfact that many adolescents spend after-\nschool and summer hours away from par-\nents.8 Where and with whom adolescents\nspend their out-of-school hours provide\nimportant information about the nature of\nyouths' out-of-school social contexts. Out-\nof-school care is conceptually distinct from\nparenting practices such as monitoring and\ninvolvement, which represent explicit pa-\nrental efforts aimed at influencing adoles-\ncent behavior.\nKnowledge about how out-of-school\ncare affects adolescent problem behav-\niors such as substance use, delinquency,\nand deviant peer involvement may in-\nform our understanding of out-of-school\ncare's impact on early sex initiation be-\ncause early sex often co-occurs with these\nother adolescent health-compromising be-\nAuthor Affiliations:\nDepartment of Population and\nFamily Health Sciences, The\nJohns Hopkins Bloomberg\nSchool of Public Health\n(Drs Roche and Astone), and\nDepartment of Pediatrics,\nThe Johns Hopkins School\nof Medicine (Dr Ellen),\nBaltimore, Md.\n\u00a92005 American Medical Association.

Rather, these studies have shown that negative\nhealth outcomes increase as out-of-school-care arrange-\nments become further removed from adult supervision,\nsuch as moving from being at a neighbor's house, to being\nat school, to being at a job, and, especially, to \"hanging\nout\" with friends.11-13 There is some evidence that high\nlevels of parental supervision and involvement mitigate\nrisks associated with self-care.11,14 These studies did not\nfocus on low-income families and did not consider the\nextent to which parenting practices mediated associa-\ntions between out-of-school-care arrangements and ado-\nlescent behavior.\nIn the present study, we examine the relationship be-\ntween patterns of out-of-school care over time and the\nearly initiation of sex among low-income, primarily ra-\ncial or ethnic minority, adolescents living in poor, ur-\nban neighborhoods. There are several reasons to focus\non this population. First, when compared with their so-\ncioeconomically advantaged counterparts, these youth\nare more likely to initiate sex at an early age.15-17 Sec-\nond, because work mandates included in the Personal Re-\nsponsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act\nof 1996 have resulted in more poor mothers moving into\nthe workplace,18 issues of out-of-school supervision and\ncare have becoming increasingly relevant to poor fami-\nlies.19 Third,familiesinlow-incomeurbanareasfaceunique\nchallenges in caring for their adolescent youth during out-\nof-school hours. For example, neighborhood violence and\nother threats to safety have a heightened salience to fami-\nlies in low-income, urban areas such that self-care may be\na less desirable arrangement for these families. The fact\nthat self-care is less prevalent among families in central\ncity areas and among African American compared with\nwhite youth20 supports this possibility. Given that fami-\nlies with limited financial resources face constraints in ac-\ncessing high-quality after-school and summer programs,\nthey face limited options regarding after-school and sum-\nmer care for their youth. Possibly because of racial or eth-\nnic minority families' greater economic needs and lack of\nformal labor market opportunities, African American and\nLatin American families are more likely than white fami-\nlies to rely on extended kin to care for their adolescents.21\nThe research question addressed in this study is: \"What\nis the association between patterns of out-of-school care\nover time and sex initiation among young adolescents liv-\ning in low-income, urban neighborhoods?\" When com-\npared with youth who either remain in self-care over time\nor move into self-care at time 2, we expect that adoles-\ncents in adult-supervised forms of care will have a lower\nodds of initiating sex. Furthermore, it is expected that\npositive parenting practices will mediate some of the as-\nsociation between adult-supervised care and reduced sex\ninitiation.\nMETHODS\nSAMPLE\nThe data for this study derive from a household-based, stratified-\nfamilies living in low-income neighborhoods in 3 locations (Bos-\nton, Mass; Chicago, Ill; and San Antonio, Tex). Participants were\ninterviewed in 1999 and again an average of 16 months later.\nData were collected on demographics, family health and well-\nbeing, and parenting. A detailed description of the study's de-\nsign and methods is available elsewhere.23 Informed consent\nwas obtained from caregivers and youth before each inter-\nview. The institutional review boards of The Johns Hopkins Uni-\nversity, Baltimore; Northwestern University, Chicago; Har-\nvard University, Boston; The University of Texas at San Antonio;\nPenn State University, University Park, Pa; Boston College, Bos-\nton; and Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park,\nNC, approved all procedures.\nBecause of our interest in sex initiation among young ado-\nlescents (for whom the health risks associated with sexual in-\ntercourse are greatest4-6), we selected a sample of female care-\ngivers and their adolescents who were aged 11 to 13 years at\ntime 1. We refer to female caregivers as mothers in this study\nbecause 90% of them were the biological or adoptive mother\nof the adolescent. Of these 694 youth, we excluded youth who\ndid not participate at time 2 (74 [10.7%]), had already initi-\nated sex by the first time assessment (46 [6.6%]), and had miss-\ning or invalid data for study variables (96 [13.8%] of those who\nhad participated in both waves). This resulted in a sample of\nof adolescents in this age group).\nParticipants at Time 1*\nCharacteristic\nNo. (%) of\nParticipants\nRace/ethnicity\nSex\nFamily structure\nMother and stepfather or male partner 37 (7.5)\nParent education\nMother's work hours\nLocation of interview\nAbbreviation: GED, general equivalency diploma.\n*The mean (SD) age of the participants was 11.9 (0.8) years.\n\u00a92005 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.\nAs shown in Table 1, most adolescents were African Ameri-\ncan or Latino. Almost two thirds of the youth lived with a mother\nonly, and in more than a third of families, neither the parent\nnor spouse had finished high school or received a general equiva-\nlency diploma. Just over half of mothers in the sample did not\nhave a paying job; 25.7% worked full time.\nAdolescents excluded from the sample because they al-\nready had had sex at time 1 were more likely to be male (P.05)\nand reported lower levels of parental monitoring (P.001) and\nparental curfews (P.05) than did youth who had not had sex\nby time 1.\nMEASURES\nDependent Variable\nAdolescent sexual intercourse was measured by the question:\n\"Have you ever had sexual intercourse?\" (Response categories\nwere as follows: 0, no; and 1, yes.) The question was preceded\nby a statement that sexual intercourse is sometimes called \"hav-\ning sex,\" \"making love,\" or \"going all the way.\" Because ado-\nlescents were aged 11 to 13 years at the time of enrollment into\nthe study, we regard the initiation of sexual intercourse by the\ntime 2 interview (an average of 16 months after the time 1 in-\nterview) as early sex initiation.\nIndependent Variables\nOut-of-school care was measured using the mother's time 1 and\ntime 2 answers to the question: \"Aside from school, where would\nyou say [child] spent most of [his/her] time when [he/she] was\nnot with you last week?\" Original response categories in-\ncluded the following: 1, \"child always with respondent\"; 2, \"in\nrespondent's home with father or respondent's partner\"; 3, \"in\nrespondent's home with sibling(s)\"; 4, \"in respondent's home\nwith a relative\"; 5, \"in respondent's home with a nonrelative\";\n6, \"formal day care center\"; 7, \"organized/supervised activi-\nties (eg, sports or an after-school program)\"; 8, \"outside of home\nwith a relative\"; 9, \"outside the home with nonrelative\"; 10,\n\"home, playing outside\"; 11, \"home alone\"; and 12, \"other\n(specify).\" Because there were few youth in some of these care\narrangements, we categorized responses into the following\ngroups at times 1 and 2: 0, \"at home in maternal care\"; 1, \"at\nhome with father or mother's male partner or another adult\";\n2, \"in an organized/supervised activity\"; 3, \"outside the home\nin the care of a relative or nonrelative\"; and 4, \"self-care\" (in-\ncludes home without an adult and playing outside). Adoles-\ncents in the other category (n=7) were not included in the\nsample. (At time 1, we were only able to verify if the sibling at\nhome with the youth was an adult because a subsequent sur-\nvey item asked about the age of the sibling but not of the old-\nest person with the child at home. Our categorization of re-\nsponses at time 1 may, therefore, have some measurement error\nbecause we assume that the nonsibling or nonrelative at home\nis an adult.)\nMeasures of parenting included parental monitoring, pa-\nrental curfews, and family routines. Parental monitoring was\na 5-item measure indicating adolescent reports of the moth-\ner's knowledge of who the child's friends are, where the child\nis after school and at night, what the child does during free time,\nand how the child spends money. Response categories were as\nfollows: 1, \"doesn't know\"; 2, \"knows a little\"; and 3, \"knows\na lot.\" Parental curfews was a 2-item measure indicating ado-\nlescent reports of the latest time that the mother allows the youth\nto stay out on school and weekend nights. Original response\ncategories were as follows: 1, \"as late as I want\"; 2, \"before 8:00\";\nor later\"; and 7, \"I am not allowed out Sunday through Thurs-\nday [Friday or Saturday] nights.\" These data were recoded so\nthat higher values indicated stricter or earlier curfews. Family\nroutines was a 5-item measure indicating the mother's reports\nof the extent to which the family had daily routines for talking\nor playing quietly, for eating meals, and for children doing home-\nwork and going to bed. Response categories were as follows:\n1, \"almost never\"; 2, \"sometimes\"; 3, \"usually\"; and 4, \"al-\nways.\" Scales demonstrated adequate reliability (=.69 for cur-\nfews, =.71 for parental monitoring, and =.68 for family rou-\ntines). Mean (SD) scores were 0.65 (0.19) for parental curfews,\nily routines.\nBecause previous research indicates an increased risk of early\nsex initiation among male youth,24 older youth, African Ameri-\ncan and Latin American (vs white) youth,1 and youth from lower\nsocioeconomic status backgrounds,15 we included variables to\nindicate the adolescent's sex (0 indicates male; and 1, female),\nage, race/ethnicity (0 indicates African American; 1, Latino; and\n2, white), and parent education (0 indicates less than high school;\n1, high school degree or general equivalency diploma; and 2,\nmore than high school). Although early initiation of sex is as-\nsociated with living in a \"nonintact\" family structure,25 many\nracial and ethnic minority youth live in extended kin house-\nholds that potentially provide the same level of supervision found\nin 2-parent families. Thus, we created the following family struc-\nture categories: 0, 2 biological or adoptive parents; 1, mother\nplus stepfather or male partner; 2, mother plus extended kin;\n3, mother only; and 4, no biological or adoptive mother. We\nalso included a measure of maternal work hours (0, not work-\ncity in which the interview took place (dummy coded with Bos-\nton as the reference group).\nWe ran cross tabulations with 2 tests of significance and com-\nparisons of means with 1-way analysis of variance to examine\nbivariate associations between early sex initiation and the fol-\nlowing variables: times 1 and 2 measures of out-of-school care;\nand time 1 measures of adolescent age, adolescent sex, adoles-\ncent race or ethnicity, parental monitoring, parental curfews,\nfamily routines, family structure, parent education, maternal\nwork hours, and city of interview. We used findings from bi-\nvariate analyses of sex initiation by out-of-school-care arrange-\nments at both assessment times to develop a variable that de-\nscribes patterns of out-of-school care over time. We next ran a\nlogistic regression model in which sex initiation by time 2 was\nregressed on patterns of out-of-school care over time, all time\n1 parenting measures (because of their conceptual relevance\nto our model), and time 1 adolescent and family demographic\nvariables that were statistically significant at P.05 in bivari-\nate analyses. Analyses were conducted using a commercially\navailable software program (SPSS, version 11.0).26\nRESULTS\nin this study initiated sex by time 2. Significantly more ado-\nlescents initiated sex if, at the time 2 assessment, they were\nin an organized/supervised activity, outside the home with\na relative or nonrelative, or in self-care, compared with\nbeing at home in maternal care or at home with the father\nor mother's male partner or another adult. Although the\noverall 2 value did not reach statistical significance for\nthe time 1 assessment of out-of-school care, the pattern\n\u00a92005 American Medical Association.

When compared with those who did not\ninitiate sex at time 2, adolescents who did initiate sex were\nolder and more likely to be male.\nBased on findings for bivariate associations between sex\ninitiation and out-of-school-care arrangements at each as-\nsessment time, we developed a measure indicating 4 pat-\nterns of change in out-of-school care from time 1 to time\n2.Thesepatternswerecodedasfollows:0,remainedinadult\ncare at home; 1, moved from self-care or out-of-home care\ninto adult care at home; 2, moved from at-home adult care\nto self-care or out-of-home care; and 3, remained in self-\ncare or out-of-home care at both times.

Consistent with bivariate results, the likelihood of\nsex initiation was greater among older compared with\nyounger adolescents and was lower among females. There\nwere no statistically significant associations between sex\ninitiation and parenting variables or family structure.\nCOMMENT\nOur understanding of how social contexts affect adoles-\ncent sexual risk has emanated largely from studies of\nTable 2.

This\nstudy's results suggest that out-of-school care repre-\nsents an additional social context salient to the risk of\nearly sexual intercourse among young adolescents liv-\ning in low-income urban areas. Contrary to our expec-\ntation that latchkey adolescents would be at greater risk\nfor early sex initiation than adolescents in any form of\nadult-supervised care, results from our bivariate analy-\nses suggested that early sex initiation was similarly\nhigher among adolescents in out-of-home care and self-\ncare. Findings from prospective analyses indicated that\nyoung adolescents who spent their out-of-school hours\neither in self-care or outside their own home, such as at\na friend's house, in an organized activity, or at the home\nof a relative, at each assessment time were 2.5 times\nmore likely to initiate sex than those who remained at\nhome with an adult. We did not find support for the\nidea that positive parenting practices helped account for\nthe relationship between at-home adult care and\nreduced sex initiation.\nIn interpreting findings for out-of-school care, it is use-\nful to consider that families in this study were all low in-\ncome and lived in either poor or near-poor central city\nneighborhoods of Boston, Chicago, and San Antonio.\nBased on previous research, adolescents in this study likely\nfaced considerable neighborhood dangers and risks, such\nas violence, drug use, early childbearing, and jobless-\nness.27 In this way, being at home with an adult may have\nreduced a youth's opportunities for engaging in early sex\nby reducing their exposure to risky social contexts ex-\nternal to the family. These structural barriers seemed to\nrepresent a more effective means of deterring early sexual\nintercourse than did explicit parental efforts aimed at\nchanging the adolescent's behavior. Parents' knowledge\nof the youth's whereabouts and activities, having rules\nabout curfews, and maintaining familial routines showed\nno statistically significant relationships with early sex ini-\ntiation.\nOur study does not account for the possibility that ado-\nlescents manifesting more problem behavior (often cor-\nrelated with early sex initiation) elicit negative feelings\nand reactions by their families such that they are less likely\nto be cared for at home by an adult when compared with\nyouth exhibiting fewer problem behaviors. In this way,\nbeing cared for outside of the home might represent a\nconsequence rather than a predictor of early sex initia-\ntion. We were also unable to account for possible changes\nin the specific nature of out-of-school care occurring dur-\ning the 16-month period between assessment times. De-\nspite limitations regarding measures of out-of-school care\nand adolescent sex initiation over time, issues of reverse\ncausality (ie, mothers altering out-of-school care in re-\nsponse to the youth initiating sex after time 1) do not\naffect the validity of our findings regarding out-of-\nschool patterns and sex initiation. This is because changes\nin out-of-school care were unrelated to the likelihood of\nsex initiation. Only when youth remained in self-care or\nout-of-home care did they experience an increased like-\nlihood of sex initiation compared with those remaining\nin at-home adult care. It is unclear whether findings from\nthis study would generalize to more economically ad-\nvantaged families or to families living in suburban and\nrural areas.\nAs welfare reform legislation continues to mandate that\npoor mothers join the labor force, future research should\nconsider factors affecting low-income families' deci-\nsions regarding out-of-school care for adolescents and,\nin turn, the health of adolescents. It may be useful, for\nexample, to understand how low-income mothers' de-\ncisions regarding out-of-school care are influenced by the\navailability of kin and adult support networks, by per-\nceived neighborhood conditions, and by the structure and\nnature of the job market. In this way, it may be possible\nto develop policies and programs that can support low-\nincome families' efforts in raising their adolescent youth\nand, in turn, potentially help reduce rates of early sexual\nintercourse.\nCorrespondence: Kathleen M.
