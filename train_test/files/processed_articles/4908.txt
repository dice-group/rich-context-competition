I approach this question in\nconversation with the German and with that of North-American versions of critical\npedagogy, with the work of Paulo Freire and Jacques Rancie\n` re. In each case, we cannot\nonly find a strong argument for emancipatory education, but also a distinctive view about the\nrole of the teacher. My aim is partly to show the different ways in which the role of the teacher\nin emancipatory education can be conceived and to make clear how this role is related to\ndifferent understandings of emancipation and the dynamics of emancipatory education. But\nthe motivation for writing this article also stems from what I see as a rather problematic\ninterpretation of the work of Rancie\n` re in recent educational scholarship, one where the key\nmessage of The Ignorant Schoolmaster (Rancie\n` re, 1991) is taken to be that anyone can learn\nwithout a teacher and that this alleged `freedom to learn' would constitute a, or perhaps even\nthe, `moment' of emancipation (for a discussion on this, see Biesta and Bingham, 2012;\nIn this article I seek to challenge this interpretation of Rancie\n` re's work and will argue that\nthe key message of The Ignorant Schoolmaster is rather that emancipatory education is not a\nmatter of transfer of knowledge from a teacher who knows to a student who does not (yet)\nknow, but nonetheless is a process in which teachers and their teaching are indispensable.\nWhat complicates the discussion is the fact that in his later work \u00ad and here I will particularly\nfocus on Rancie\n` re's essay `The emancipated spectator' (Rancie\nRancie\n` re seems to have `forgotten' this message himself and seems to be turning the\nargument for emancipatory teaching into an argument about emancipatory learning, in\nother words, focusing on the freedom of students and other `spectators' to construct their\nown meanings and understandings (for a similar `problem' in Rancie\n` re's engagement with\nthe work of Althusser, see Lewis, 2012: 31).2 By showing how such a constructivist\ninterpretation goes against what I consider to be Rancie\n` re's unique contribution to the\ndiscussion about educational emancipation, I will also be able to articulate with more\nprecision why and how teaching is indispensable for emancipatory education and why we\nshould therefore not be fooled into thinking that ignorant schoolmasters, because they have\nno knowledge to give, have therefore nothing to teach and can be done away with.\nEducation as a matter of emancipation3\nThe idea that education is not just about the perfection of individuals through their\nengagement with culture and history \u00ad a line of thought particularly prominent in the\nGreek idea of paideia (paid\"0a) and in some conceptions of the idea of Bildung (for a\ncritical discussion, see Heydorn, 1972; Klafki, 1986) \u00ad but ultimately has to do with their\nexistence as autonomous subjects (Drerup, 2015) and thus with their emancipation, has been\npart of the modern educational experience at least since Rousseau (L\u00f8vlie, 2002). If paideia\nwas an education for free men to further their freedom as citizens and in this regard stood in\nopposition to the education meant for manual labourers and artisans, the banausoi\n(b0nausoi) (Jaeger, 1945), the modern experience came to see education as a process that\nshould bring about freedom. It thus conceived of education as a process of liberation.\nWhile some authors were interested in the ways in which education might contribute to\nsuch liberation, others made the stronger claim that education is necessary for such\nliberation. The often quoted opening sentence of Kant's essay `An answer to the question\n``What is Enlightenment?''' in which he defines enlightenment as the human being's `release\nfrom his self-incurred tutelage' and saw tutelage or immaturity as `man's inability to make\nprovides a telling example of the latter approach, particularly when combined with the\nclaim from his essay on education that human beings can only become human through\neducation and are nothing but for what education makes of them (see Kant, 1982: 701).4\nFrom here the emancipatory impetus developed along two lines, one which we might call\nchild-centred or psychological, and another which we might call society-centred or\nsociological. The first followed Rousseau's insight that adaptation of the child to the\nexternal societal order would corrupt the child, which led to the idea that a choice for the\nchild could only mean a choice against society. This line of thought not only played an\nimportant role in the establishment of education as an independent academic discipline in\nGermany towards the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century (see Biesta,\n2011). It was also central to child-centred forms of education that emerged around the time\nunder such names as `progressive education', `Reformpa\n\u00a8 dagogik' or `e\n\u00b4 ducation nouvelle'.\nThese developments were further supported by theories that conceived of the child as a\nnatural category and a `given', and not as something that had to be understood in social,\nhistorical or political terms.\nIn the German context, the limitations of this understanding of emancipatory education\nbecame painfully clear when it turned out that theories and practices that focused exclusively\non `the child' could easily be inserted into a wide range of different ideological systems,\nincluding Nazism and fascism (see, for example, Klafki and Brockmann, 2003). This is why\nafter the Second World War, educators and educationalists in Germany such as Herwig\nBlankertz and Klaus Mollenhauer turned to Marxist and neo-Marxist thought, including the\nearly work of Ju\n\u00a8 rgen Habermas, in order to develop what in Germany became known as\n`kritische Pa\n\u00a8 dagogik' (for example, Mollenhauer, 1976 [1968]). About two decades later, but\nwith precursors in the work of `social reconstructionist' educationalists such as George\nCounts (see Stanley, 1992), a similar strand of work emerged in North America through\nthe work of authors such as Michael Apple, Henry Giroux and Peter McLaren under the\nname of `critical pedagogy'. As a critical theory of and for education, the emancipatory\ninterests of these forms of critical pedagogy focused on the analysis of oppressive structures,\npractices and theories with the ambition to bring about `demystification' and `liberation\nfrom dogmatism' (phrases used by both McLaren and Mollenhauer; see McLaren, 1997:\nThe modern logic of emancipation and its contradictions\nThe concept of emancipation that emerges from this line of thinking is one that conceives of\nemancipation as liberation from the oppressive workings of power. A crucial step in the\nprocess of emancipation therefore consists of exposing the workings of power \u00ad\ndemystification \u00ad because it is assumed that only when we know how power works and\nhow it works upon us that we can begin to liberate ourselves and others from it. What the\nMarxist tradition added to this \u00ad and this, in turn, has had a crucial influence on critical and\nemancipatory pedagogies \u00ad is the notion of ideology. Although the question of the exact\nmeaning of this concept is a topic of ongoing debates (see Eagleton, 2007), one of the key\ninsights expressed in the concept of ideology is not only that all thought is socially\ndetermined \u00ad following Marx's dictum that `it is not the consciousness of man that\ndetermines their being but, on the contrary, their social being that determines their\nconsciousness' (Marx, quoted in Eagleton, 2007: 80) \u00ad but also, and more importantly,\nthat ideology is thought `which denies this determination' (Eagleton, 2007: 89).\nThe latter claim is linked to Friedrich Engels' notion of false consciousness: the idea that\n`the real motives impelling [the agent] remain unknown to him' (Engels, quoted in Eagleton,\n2007: 89). The predicament of ideology lies in the claim that it is precisely because of the way\nin which power works upon our consciousness that we are unable to see how power works\nupon our consciousness. This not only implies that in order to free ourselves from the\nworkings of power we need to expose how power works upon our consciousness. It also\nmeans that in order for us to achieve emancipation, someone else, whose consciousness is not\nsubjected to the workings of power, needs to provide us with an account of our objective\ncondition (on this theme see also Honig, 2003). According to this line of thought, therefore,\nemancipation is ultimately contingent upon the truth about our objective condition, a truth\nthat can only be generated by someone who is positioned outside of the influence of ideology\n\u00ad and in the Marxist tradition, this position is considered to be occupied either by science or\nby philosophy.\nThis line of thought not only provides us with a particular `logic' of emancipation \u00ad one\nthat sees emancipation as a liberation from oppressive power structures and processes \u00ad but\nalso provides us with a particular `logic' of emancipatory education, one that seeks to bring\nabout such liberation through acts of `demystification' and `liberation from dogmatism', as\nmentioned above. Key to the modern `logic' of emancipation is the idea that emancipation\nrequires a particular intervention from the `outside' by emancipators who themselves are not\nsubjected to the power that needs to be overcome. This intervention takes the form of\ndemystification, that is, of revealing to the ones to be emancipated what their objective\ncondition is. This not only makes emancipation into something that is done to someone\nbut also reveals that emancipation is based upon an assumed inequality between the\nemancipator and the one being emancipated, an inequality that will only be resolved in\nthe future when emancipation has been achieved or brought about.\nIt is presumably not too difficult to recognise a particular pedagogy in this depiction of\nthe modern `logic' of emancipation. This is a pedagogy where the teacher knows and, more\nspecifically, knows something about the objective condition of the student, and where it is,\ntherefore, the task of the teacher to explain this condition to the student with the ambition\nthat the student ultimately becomes like the teacher or, to be more precise, that the student\nmoves from a situation of ignorance about his or her objective position to one of knowledge\nand understanding, similar to the knowledge and understanding the teacher already\npossesses. Such a situation may be described as one of equality.\nAs I have discussed elsewhere in more detail (Biesta, 2010a), the modern `logic' of\nemancipation is not without problems and not without contradictions. One problem is the\nfact that although emancipation is aimed at liberation of the one to be emancipated, it actually\ninstalls dependency at the very heart of the act of emancipation. After all, the one to be\nemancipated is dependent upon a `powerful intervention' by the emancipator in order to\ngain his or her freedom. More importantly for the argument in this article, this intervention\nis based on knowledge the emancipator claims to have about the objective condition of the one\nto be emancipated; knowledge which, before emancipation `arrives', is hidden from the one to\nbe emancipated. This means that the modern `logic' of emancipation starts from a distrust in\nthe experiences of the one to be emancipated, suggesting that we cannot really trust what we\nsee or feel but need someone else to tell us what is really going on.\nWhereas in classical Marxism the Marxist philosopher was supposed to be able to occupy\nthis position, in our times we often find psychology and sociology in this position, asserting\nthat they can reveal to us what is really going on in our heads \u00ad or more often nowadays: our\nbrains \u00ad and in our social lives. Rancie\n` re captures well what is going on here by highlighting\nthat under this logic of emancipation we need someone who `lifts a veil off the obscurity of\nthings', who `carries obscure depth to the clear surface, and who, conversely, brings the false\nappearance of the surface back to the secret depths of reason' (Rancie\nWe should not immediately reject the modern `logic' of emancipation, but should at least\ntry to understand the particular issues it sought to address and the particular `frame' from\nwhich it attempted to do so. Nonetheless, the clear tension between the ambition to liberate\nand the claim that this requires someone telling you what is really going on in your head,\nmay help to see why an encounter with the modern `logic' of emancipation may not\nimmediately `feel empowering' (Ellsworth, 1989).\nPaulo Freire, emancipation and the pedagogy of the oppressed\nThe contradictions of the modern `logic' of emancipation resonate strongly with what Paulo\nFreire has referred to as `banking education', a mode of education where students are turned\ninto ```receptacles'' to be ``filled'' by the teacher' and where teaching becomes an `act of\ndepositing, in which the students are the depositories and the teacher the depositor' (Freire,\n1993: 53). The fact that banking education appears to be central to the modern `logic' of\nemancipation and emancipatory education raises the interesting question of how Freire's\nown conception differs from this \u00ad a question that is particularly important given Freire's\nplace in the `canon' of modern critical pedagogy (see, for example, Lankshear and McLaren,\n1994). The critical difference, I suggest, has to do with Freire's understanding of oppression,\nthat is, of that from which we need to be emancipated.\nFor Freire, oppression is not a matter of one person or group exerting (unwarranted)\npower over another person or group, but rather concerns a situation of alienation. Although\nalienation may well be the result of one person or group exerting unwarranted power over\nanother person or group, the exercise of unwarranted power as such does not constitute the\nkind of oppression Freire seeks to overcome. Freire rather defines oppression as the situation\nwhere human beings are prevented from being human \u00ad or as he tends to put it: where human\nbeings are prevented from being `more fully human' (Freire, 1993: 39).\nThis not only explains why Freire characterises liberation as a process of humanization,\nthat is, of becoming more fully human. It also shows why Freire is not after the liberation of\nthe oppressed from the power of the oppressors, but after liberating them both from the\ninauthentic and alienated way of being in their linked identities of oppressor and oppressed,\nso that they can `enter the historical process as responsible Subjects' (Freire, 1993: 18). This\nalso makes clear why Freire's pedagogy is not a pedagogy for the oppressed where, through a\npowerful intervention the oppressed are set free, but a pedagogy of the oppressed. Freire\nemphasises again and again that `the great humanistic and historical task of the oppressed\n[is] to liberate themselves and their oppressors as well' (Freire, 1993: 26).5\nFor Freire, authentic existence is a way of existing as a subject of one's own actions rather\nthan as the object of someone else's actions. Authentic existence is therefore a matter of\nfreedom. Yet freedom for Freire is not a matter of just doing what one wants to do, but\nMoreover, to exist as subject rather than object does not mean that one exists purely for and\nwith oneself. Freire stresses that `world and human beings do not exist apart from each\nother, [but] exist in constant interaction' (Freire, 1993: 32). For Freire, the interaction\nbetween human subjects and the world requires both action and reflection. The `action\nand reflection of men and women upon their world in order to transform it' is what he\ncalls praxis (see Freire, 1993: 60). Praxis thus characterises the authentic existence as subject,\nwhich is why Freire sees it as `the new raison d'e\nis, after they have overcome their alienated way of being.\nFreire's understanding of oppression as alienation provides the reason why his critique of\nbanking education is different from common complaints about the transmission conception\nof education as a conception informed by a deficient theory of learning. Although Freire\ndoes argue that banking education leads to superficial forms of learning where `words are\nemptied of their concreteness and become a hollow, alienated, and alienating verbosity'\nleading to memorisation but not to real understanding (Freire, 1993: 52), his critique is\nnot that banking education relies on a misguided learning theory so that all problems are\nresolved if we were to allow students to be active constructors rather than passive recipients.\nHe rather hints at the deeper point that in banking education students can only appear as\nobjects of the acts of the teacher and not as human subjects in their own right. In banking\neducation, `the teacher is the Subject of the learning process, while the pupils are merely\nobjects' (Freire, 1993: 54). Emancipatory education therefore needs to begin with addressing\n`the teacher-student contradiction' which in his view can only be done `by reconciling the\npoles of the contradiction so that both teachers and students are simultaneously teachers and\nThe roles of the teacher in Freire's Pedagogy of the Oppressed\nFreire's `response' to the problems of the modern `logic' of emancipation thus seems to be\none that heralds the end of the teacher. After all, in order to overcome the `teacher-student\ncontradiction' characteristic of banking education, both the teacher and the student need to\ngive up the very identity that keeps them in an oppressive and dehumanising relationship.\nInstead they need to engage in a relationship which Freire calls dialogue.\nThrough dialogue, the teacher-of-the-students and the students-of-the-teacher cease to exist and\na new term emerges: teacher-student with student-teachers. The teacher is no longer merely the-\none-who-teaches, but one who is himself taught in dialogue with the students, who in turn while\nbeing taught also teach. They become jointly responsible for a process in which all grow.\nOne could say that Freire here dissolves the (oppressive) teacher-student relationship of\nbanking education by turning it into a process of joint learning, joint discovery, of joint\ncreation of knowledge, although in Freire's vocabulary it is more accurate to say that\nbanking education is transformed into joint praxis, that is, into an authentic human\nexistence for both the (former) oppressor and the (former) oppressed. This is no longer a\nsituation in which the teacher is the one who has knowledge and the students just memorise\nthe content narrated by the teacher. Instead both are involved in collective acts of inquiry,\ninquiry in `fellowship and solidarity' which are `directed towards humanization' (Freire,\nIn Freire's hands, the teacher is transformed into a fellow-inquirer, that is, someone\nwho, always together with their students, is involved in praxis, that is, in transformational\naction-reflection. Here the teacher is a subject with other subjects, rather than a subject\ndepositing knowledge into objects. In one and the same move, students cease to be `docile\nlisteners' and become `critical co-investigators in dialogue with the teacher' (Freire, 1993:\n62). In this situation, Freire argues, `no one teaches another, nor is anyone self-taught'\nWhile at this level the `banking-teacher' disappears and the teacher-as-fellow-inquirer\nemerges, it is important to acknowledge that this is not the only figure of the teacher\npresent in Freire's work. There are at least two more `teachers' to be found in Freire's\nwritings. This raises the interesting question of how these different identities can be\nreconciled. The key here is to see that the image of the teacher-as-fellow-inquirer, as\nsubject involved in praxis with other subjects, describes the situation where the teacher-\nstudent contradiction has been resolved. It describes, in other words, the situation after\nalienation. But the important question for emancipatory education is not so much what\nthis situation looks like, but how we might get there and whether teachers have anything to do\nwith moving towards the situation where the teacher-student contradiction has been\nresolved.\nThe first point Freire repeatedly makes in relation to this question is that oppression\ncannot be overcome through banking education. `The pedagogy of the oppressed cannot be\ndeveloped or practiced by the oppressors' (Freire, 1993: 36), because such a `gesture' \u00ad which\ncan take the form, for example, of `false generosity' or `paternalism' \u00ad `itself maintains and\nembodies oppression' (Freire, 1993: 36). This reveals that Freire is well aware of the\ncontradictions that characterise the modern `logic' of emancipation and their enactment in\neducational settings and why he maintains that `the great humanistic and historical task' of\nliberation of both the oppressed and the oppressors lies with the oppressed and has to lie with\nBut Freire immediately adds that `if the implementation of a liberating education requires\npolitical power and the oppressed have none', this raises the problem of how the oppressed\ncan carry out a liberating pedagogy `prior to the revolution' (Freire, 1993: 36). Freire's\nresponse to this predicament is twofold. First, he makes a distinction between two stages\nwithin `libertarian pedagogy', the first in which `the oppressed unveil the world of oppression\nand through praxis commit themselves to its transformation', and the second `in which the\nreality of oppression has already been transformed, [so that] this pedagogy ceases to belong\nto the oppressed and becomes a pedagogy of all people in the process of permanent\nBut \u00ad and this is the second part of Freire's response \u00ad the `pedagogy of the first stage'\nmust deal with another problem too, which is `the problem of the oppressed consciousness'\n(Freire, 1993: 37), a consciousness shaped by the very relationship of oppression that needs\nto be overcome. While Freire highlights that this `does not necessarily mean that the\noppressed are unaware that they are downtrodden. . . their perception of themselves as\noppressed is [nonetheless] impaired by their submission in the reality of oppression'\n(Freire, 1993: 27). `Submerged in this reality', Freire writes, `the oppressed cannot\nperceive clearly the ``order'' which serves the interests of the oppressors whose image they\nSo how is it possible to change this situation? This is perhaps the most delicate aspect of\nFreire's theory, because on the one hand, he wants to resist the idea that the oppressed must\nbe told to become subjects of their own history. Yet on the other, because the `oppressed\nconsciousness' prevents the oppressed from seeing themselves as subjects of their own\nhistory, the oppressed need in some way to be `prompted' to become engaged `in the\nontological and historical vocation of becoming more fully human' (Freire, 1993: 48);\nthey must be `prompted' to `engage in reflection on their concrete situation' on the\nassumption that `reflection \u00ad true reflection \u00ad leads to action' so that this is not a matter\nFreire adds two points to this. One is that `action will constitute authentic praxis only if its\nconsequences become the object of critical reflection', that is, if they bring about `critical\nconsciousness' (Freire, 1993: 48). The other is that Freire does give a specific name to\nthose who do the prompting \u00ad he calls them `revolutionary leaders' (see, for example,\nFreire, 1993: 49) \u00ad though he does emphasise that these are not leaders who lead the\noppressed out of their oppression, but leaders who are involved, alongside the oppressed,\nin transformational action-reflection, that is, in praxis. This is why Freire writes that a\nprocess through which they discover themselves as the `permanent re-creators' of reality,\nand thus as subjects of their own history can only come about if:\n[r]evolutionary leadership . . . practice[s] co-intentional education [where] teachers and students\n(leadership and people) co-intent on reality, are both Subjects, not only in the task of unveiling\nthat reality, and thereby coming to know it critically, but in the task of re-creating that\nknowledge.\nIn the idea of the `revolutionary leader' we can see a different figure of the teacher at work in\nFreire's thought, namely of the teacher as the one who instigates praxis, not as a powerful act\nthrough which the oppressed are liberated from their delusions but by starting up, in a kind\nof boot-strapping way, the very transformational action-reflection that characterises the\nhuman way of being in the world. While the `revolutionary leader' is close to the teacher-\nstudent who works with the student-teachers after the revolution, the work of the teacher\nbefore the revolution is at least different in its orientation, as it aims to engage the oppressed\nin transformational action-reflection \u00ad and in his discussion of problem-posing education\n(see Freire, 1993: chapter 4) Freire describes in much detail how such engaging of the\noppressed in praxis might be carried out.\nWhile in this way Freire seems to make an interesting case for a form of emancipatory\nteaching that does not fall back onto the monological mode of banking education, there is\none further level in Freire's work and hence a third figure of the teacher where Freire is\nless successful in resolving the predicament of emancipatory teaching without banking.\nThis comes into view when we see that in such books as Pedagogy of the Oppressed, Freire\nhimself operates as a teacher, not only by telling (other) teachers what they should and\nshould not do, but also by expressing strong claims about the allegedly true nature of\nhuman beings. After all, as discussed above, Freire defines oppression as the situation\nwhere human beings are prevented from being `more fully human', thus implying that\nto overcome alienation means to be closer to what it means to exist in a (more) fully\nhuman way. While Freire's depiction of what it means to be human is not entirely without\nreason, it is nonetheless a very particular vision of what it means to be human, and\ntherefore perhaps one that not everyone will accept or recognise as what all human\nbeings ought to strive for.\nAlthough Freire's critique of the logic of oppression is original and important, and\nalthough the metaphor of banking education, particularly in the way in which Freire uses\nand develops this idea, provides a powerful reference point for the critique of monological\neducational practices in which students can only appear as objects, the way in which Freire\nhimself appears as a teacher shows that it is perhaps more difficult to escape from a banking\nmode of emancipatory education than Freire seems to believe. It is here that Rancie\n` re's\naccount of Joseph Jacotot, the `ignorant schoolmaster', seeks to articulate a different\nresponse to the contradictions of the modern `logic' of emancipation and emancipatory\neducation.\nRancie\n`re, Jacotot and the ignorant schoolmaster\nIn The Ignorant Schoolmaster: Five Lessons in Intellectual Emancipation (Rancie\nRancie\n` re recounts the story of Joseph Jacotot (1770\u00ad1840), a French schoolteacher who\nduring his exile in Belgium in the first decades of the 19th century developed an\neducational approach, which he called `universal teaching'. Jacotot's approach stemmed\nfrom a discovery he made when he was invited to teach French to Flemish students\nwhose language he didn't speak. What was peculiar about this situation was that there\nwas `no language in which he could teach what they [his students] sought from him'\n(Rancie\n` re, 1991: 1). Nonetheless, his students did manage to learn to speak and write\nFrench, which they accomplished through studying a bilingual edition of Fe\n\u00b4 nelon's novel\nTe\u00b4le\u00b4maque.\nRancie\n` re's exploration of the `case' of Jacotot is interesting for two reasons, which are\nboth connected to the discussion of Freire. One has to do with the fact that Jacotot and his\nstudents did not share a language, so that there was no possibility for Jacotot to deposit any\ncontent in the minds of the students. There was, in other words, no possibility for banking\neducation. Yet, while in this regard \u00ad that is in terms of the transmission of knowledge \u00ad\nJacotot wasn't able to teach his students anything, Rancie\n` re insists that this doesn't mean\nthat Jacotot's students learned without a schoolmaster. This means that, in another sense,\nJacotot did teach and did act as a schoolmaster. And it is precisely in relation to this point\nthat Jacotot \u00ad at least in the hands of Rancie\n` re7 \u00ad provides a way of overcoming the Freirean\n`teacher-student contradiction' that does not result in the dissolution of the teacher in the\nway in which I have shown this to be the case in Freire. Let me briefly try to explain how this\nis achieved.\nWhereas Freire focused his critique on education as a process of banking, Rancie\n` re's\ncritique has a slightly different target as it focuses of the role of explanation. Rancie\n` re\ncontends that in educational settings, explanation offers itself `as a means to reduce the\nsituation of inequality where those who know nothing are in relation with those who\nknow' (Rancie\n` re, 2010: 3). When teachers explain something to their students, they do\nso with the intention of giving their students the knowledge and understanding they do not\nyet have. In this sense, it looks reasonable to think of explanation as the way to overcome\nthe inequality between the teacher who knows and the student who doesn't know yet.\nRancie\n` re argues, however, that whereas this may be true when we look at the content\nbeing transmitted from the teacher to the student, the way in which the `act' of explanation is\nitself performed communicates something different, namely that explanation is indispensable\nfor learning and understanding, that is, that students are thought to be unable to understand\nwithout explanation. This is the point Rancie\n` re makes when he suggests that `to explain\nsomething to someone is first of all to show him [that] he cannot understand it by himself'\n(Rancie\n` re, 1991: 6), which means that to explain is `to demonstrate an incapacity' (Rancie\n` re,\n2010: 3; emphasis added). Explanation then turns education into what Rancie\n` re refers to as\nstultification \u00ad a process that keeps students `in their place', that literally keeps them stupid\nand without a voice \u00ad rather than as a process of emancipation.\nRancie\n` re thus suggests that explanation actually enacts and in a sense inaugurates and\nthen perpetually confirms the inequality of teacher and student. In this set-up it is not so\nmuch that a student is the one who needs explanation. It is rather that the act of explanation\nconstitutes the student as the one who is unable to learn without explanation, without the\nintervention of a `master-explicator'. This leads Rancie\n` re to the conclusion that the student\nso conceived is actually the product of the `explicative order' (Rancie\ncondition. The explicative order is founded upon what Rancie\n` re calls the `myth of\npedagogy', which is `the parable of a world divided into knowing minds and ignorant\nones, the capable and the incapable, the intelligent and the stupid' (Rancie\nThe explicator's `special trick' here consists of a `double inaugural gesture' (Rancie\n` re,\nOn the one hand, he decrees the absolute beginning: it is only now that the act of learning will\nbegin. On the other, having thrown a veil of ignorance over everything that is to be learned, he\nappoints himself to the task of lifting it.\n(Rancie\nThe intention behind this approach to teaching is generally a laudable one, as the teacher\naims `to transmit his knowledge to his students so as to bring them, by degrees, to his own\nlevel of expertise' (Rancie\n` re, 1991: 3). The `art' of the schoolmaster, `who methodically lifts\nthe veil from that which the student could not understand alone, is the art that promises the\nstudent will one day be the equal of the schoolmaster' (Rancie\npromise ever be delivered? Is it ever possible to escape from the circle of explanation? Or is it\nthe case that as soon as one starts out on a trajectory of explanation, one will be there\nforever, always trying to catch up, always trying to understand what the explicator already\nunderstands, but always in need of the explicator's explanation in order to understand?8\nViewed in this way explanation is actually `something completely different from a practical\nmeans of reaching some end' and rather appears to be an end in itself. Explanation is `the\ninfinite verification of a fundamental axiom: the axiom of inequality' (Rancie\nRancie\n`re's emancipatory teacher\nThe question this raises is whether it is possible to break away from the circle of powerlessness\n`that ties the student to the explicator' (Rancie\n` re suggests that this may\nindeed be possible, but not through the introduction of more `refined' or more `progressive'\nforms of explanation. Here, Rancie\n` re clearly diverges from the path of modern `logic' of\nemancipatory education by arguing against the idea that emancipation results from an\nexplanation of the objective condition of the student. He writes:\nThe distinction between `stultification' and `emancipation' is not a distinction between methods\nof instruction. It is not a distinction between traditional or authoritarian methods, on the one\nhand, and new or active methods, on the other: stultification can and does happen in all kinds of\nactive and modern ways.\n(Rancie\nThe more fundamental question that emerges from this discussion is therefore whether it is\npossible to teach without explanation, and it is here that the case of Jacotot is relevant,\nbecause it provides us precisely with an example of this.\nYet what is important about the `case' of Jacotot \u00ad and it is here that Rancie\n` re and Freire\ndiverge \u00ad is that the case of Jacotot is not one where the teacher had completely withdrawn\nand education had turned into collective learning or collaborative inquiry. It rather provides\nus with an example of an educational `dynamic' where students learned without a `master-\nexplicator' (Rancie\n` re summarises this by saying that\n`Jacotot had taught them something [but] he had communicated nothing to them' (Rancie\n` re,\n1991: 13). The dissociation of teaching from communication is central to Rancie\n` re's\nargument and provides one way to understand the idea of the ignorant schoolmaster, as\nthe educational dynamic that is at stake here is one that no longer relies on the (superior)\nknowledge of the schoolmaster. But in what way, then, is the ignorant schoolmaster involved\nin teaching?\nRancie\n` re characterises the shift that is at stake here with the help of the distinction\nbetween intelligence and will, in that what Jacotot did was not to replace the intelligence\nof his students with his own intelligence, but rather to summon his students to use their own\nintelligence. The relationship between Jacotot and his students is therefore not a relationship\nof intelligence to intelligence but of `will to will' (Rancie\n` re\nconcludes that whereas stultification takes place `whenever one intelligence is subordinated\nto another', emancipation takes place when an intelligence obeys only itself `even while the\nwill obeys another will' (Rancie\n` re, 1991: 13). What therefore is at the heart of the conception\nof emancipatory education that emerges from this, is what Rancie\n` re describes as the act of\nrevealing `an intelligence to itself' (Rancie\nRancie\n` re highlights that the route students will take when summoned to use their\nintelligence is unknown, but what the student cannot escape is `the exercise of his liberty'\n(Rancie\n` re concludes that there are only two `fundamental\nacts' for the schoolmaster: `He interrogates, he demands speech, that is to say, the\nmanifestation of an intelligence that wasn't aware of itself or that had given up' and `he\nverifies that the work of the intelligence is done with attention' (Rancie\nin original). What is verified here is not the outcome of the use of intelligence, as this would\nreturn the process to that of explanation, but only the use of intelligence, in other words, that\nthe `work' of intelligence is done with attention. Rancie\n` re emphasises that this interrogation\nshould not be understood in the Socratic way where the purpose of the interrogation seems\nto be that of leading the student to a point that is already known by the master. While\nthis `may be the path to learning', it is `in no way a path to emancipation' (Rancie\n29). Central to emancipation, then, is the consciousness `of what an intelligence can do\nwhen it considers itself equal to any other and considers any other equal to itself'\n(Rancie\nRancie\n` re highlights that to start from the assumption of the equality of all speaking\nbeings is not to assume, naively, that equality exists. It is not to assume that he has a\nspecial insight into how inequality exists and how it can be transformed into equality.\nRancie\n` re actually writes that about inequality `there is nothing to know' (Rancie\n` re,\n2010: 4) \u00ad which adds another layer of meaning to the idea of the ignorant schoolmaster.\nInequality is no more a given to be transformed by knowledge than equality is an end to be\ntransmitted through knowledge. Equality and inequality are not two states. They are two\n`opinions', that is to say two distinct axioms, by which educational training can operate, two\naxioms that have nothing in common. All that one can do is verify the axiom one is given. The\nschoolmaster's explanatory logic presents inequality axiomatically . . . The ignorant\nschoolmaster's logic poses equality as an axiom to be verified. It relates the state of inequality\nin the teacher-student relation not to the promise of an equality-to-come that will never come,\nbut to the reality of a basic equality.\n(Rancie\nThe point for Rancie\n` re, in short, is not to prove the equality of intelligence, `It's seeing what\ncan be done under that supposition' (Rancie\nThe figure of the ignorant schoolmaster that emerges from Rancie\n` re's discussion of\nJacotot \u00ad and I wish to emphasise one more time that what we are looking at is\nRancie\n` re's `use' of the case of Jacotot, not Jacotot himself \u00ad is important in the context of\nthe question of whether teaching has a role to play in education that aims at emancipation. It\nis important to keep this focus in mind, that is, to see the figure of the ignorant schoolmaster\nas having to do with the question of emancipatory education, and not to see it as a paradigm\nfor all dimensions of education.\nRancie\n` re's `intervention' is clearly orientated towards the question of how in educational\nrelationships and settings students can appear and exist as subjects rather than objects and\ntowards the question of what this requires from the teacher. Rancie\n` re's argument is therefore\nneither an argument against education as the transmission of knowledge or education as\nexplanation \u00ad those `modes' of education are perfectly acceptable if the ambition is to\ntransmit knowledge or to bring about understanding \u00ad nor an argument for a kind of\nconstructivist classroom in which the teacher is only present as a facilitator of learning,\nbut no longer has something to teach and is no longer allowed to teach something (on the\nThe point I wish to make here \u00ad and this is crucial for what I seek to do in this article \u00ad\nis that Rancie`re's argument is an argument about emancipation and the role of the teacher in\nemancipatory education, and not a general theory of education or schooling or the dynamics\nof instruction (didactics) (which is why Jacotot's notion of `universal teaching' is\nmisleading where it concerns the way in which Rancie\n` re makes use of Jacotot). At a\nvery basic level, Rancie\n` re's argument is a critique of the idea that emancipation relies\nupon some deeper insight about our true human existence which, through an act of\nexplanation, needs to be transmitted from the emancipator to the one to be\nemancipated. In this sense, he appears to be in agreement with Freire's insight that\nbanking education can never be the method of emancipation. Both Freire and Rancie\n` re\ndisagree with a basic tenet of the modern `logic' of emancipation and emancipatory\neducation, namely the idea that emancipation rests on providing an explanation of the\nobjective condition of the one to be emancipated. But there are three ways in which\nRancie\n` re's approach differs from Freire's.11\nOne is that Rancie\n` re's approach retains a very explicit and precise task for the teacher and\ntherefore also retains a very specific identity for the teacher, albeit not in terms of the\ntransmission of knowledge, but in terms of a relationship at the level of will. Rancie\n` re\ndescribes the `logic' of emancipatory teaching in the following way: `The emancipatory\nteacher's call forbids the supposed ignorant one the satisfaction of what is known,\nthe satisfaction of admitting that one is incapable of knowing more' (Rancie\nThe second difference is that for Rancie\n` re equality is not some kind of deeper truth about the\nhuman being which would, as I have shown to be the case with Freire, turn emancipatory\nteaching back to the transmission of a truth about the true and objective condition of the one\nto be emancipated. For Rancie\n` re, equality functions as an assumption, as something that\ngives direction to emancipatory teaching; not as a truth upon which it is founded but as a\npossibility that constantly asks for what Rancie\n` re terms verification; not to be understood as\nproviding evidence for its truth, but understood in the literal sense of making true, that is,\nacting as if it were true in order to see what follows from it. This also means, and this is the\nthird point where Rancie\n` re's approach differs, that equality is not projected into the future as\na state that will only come into existence `after the revolution' (see Thompson, 1997), but is\nsituated in the here and now.\nThree conceptions of emancipatory education:\nLiberation, truth and teaching\nComparing the modern `logic' of emancipation with the views of Freire and Rancie\n` re reveals\na number of important differences in how emancipation is conceived and how the role of\neducation \u00ad and more specifically the role of the teacher \u00ad is understood. According to the\nmodern `logic', emancipation is understood as liberation from power. As oppression is not\njust understood in material terms but also in what we might call discursive terms \u00ad the idea of\nideology \u00ad liberation relies on a teacher who provides the one to be emancipated with the\nnon-distorted truth about their objective condition.\nFreire and Rancie\n` re are both critical of the modern `logic' of emancipation, but for different\nreasons and with different outcomes. For Freire the main problem seems to be the powerful\nposition of the teacher, hence he conceives of emancipatory education as a process where the\nteacher becomes a fellow-inquirer together with other fellow-inquirers collectively involved in\nthe action-reflection process called praxis. Freire thus takes the teacher out of the equation\n(albeit that he struggles to do so entirely as he still has a role for the revolutionary leader and\nultimately appears as a teacher himself, making claims about the authentic condition of the\nhuman being). This is the reason why he defines oppression as alienation from this authentic\ncondition and emancipation as a return to this condition.\nAgainst this background we can see that Rancie\n` re goes exactly in the opposite direction,\nas he gives up on the idea that it is possible or necessary to base emancipation on a truth\nabout the objective or authentic condition of the human being. But unlike Freire he does\nretain a key role for the teacher; not, however, as the one who provides the ones to be\nemancipated with knowledge about their objective or authentic condition \u00ad which is the\nreason why the emancipatory schoolmaster is ignorant \u00ad but by enacting a particular\nintervention or `interruption' (see Biesta, 2009), one that, as he puts it, forbids the one to\nbe emancipated the satisfaction of claiming that one is incapable of learning, thinking and\nacting for oneself. Oppression thus appears as the belief that one is unable to learn, think\nand act for oneself \u00ad a rejection of one's freedom \u00ad and emancipation concerns revealing `an\nintelligence to itself' (Rancie\n` re, 1991: 28) or, in a more precise formulation, interrupting and\nrefusing the student's denial of their own freedom.\nSimply put, then, the modern logic of emancipation relies on a teacher and truth. Freire\nremoves the teacher and ultimately retains the role of truth, whereas Rancie\n` re retains the\nteacher but removes truth. For Rancie\n` re emancipation doesn't run on a truth to be\nconveyed from the teacher to the student and therefore the emancipatory teacher appears\nas ignorant.\nConstructivist enthusiasm: The uptake of Rancie\n`re\nIn the foregoing pages I have provided a reconstruction of three different conceptions of\nemancipation and three different approaches to emancipatory education. Starting from the\ncontradictions that are present in the modern `logic' of emancipation, I have presented Freire\nand Rancie\n` re as providing two different responses to these contradictions. Each takes a\ndifferent `horn' of the dilemma posed by the modern logic of emancipation. Whereas\nFreire tries to get rid of the authoritarian teacher who prevents students from appearing as\nsubjects in the educational relationship, we could say that Rancie\n` re gets rid of the role of\nauthoritarian knowledge that prevents students from being different from how they are being\ndefined by that knowledge and how they come to define themselves by it, namely as incapable.\nI have also highlighted that Freire and Rancie\n` re introduce different understandings of\noppression and that their views about emancipation respond to those understandings.\nMy particular interest in this article, however, has been the role, position and identity of the\nteacher in emancipatory education, and it is here that I wish to locate the unique contribution\nRancie\n` re has made to the discussion, as he has managed to introduce a `third option': This is\nthe option where teachers actually have something important to do vis-a\n`-vis emancipation and are\nnot seen, as was the case in Freire, as part of the problem. But unlike the idea that teachers\nshould supplant false consciousness in their students with true consciousness \u00ad a manoeuvre\nthat Freire rightly objects to \u00ad Rancie\n` re takes the question of emancipation away from matters\nof knowledge and truth. We can see this in the two formulations he provides for the role of the\nemancipatory schoolmaster. One formulation is `positive' in the sense that it indicates what\nthe emancipatory teacher should do, namely `revealing an intelligence to itself'. The other\nformulation is `negative' in that it is about forbidding the supposed ignorant one `the\nsatisfaction of admitting that one is incapable of knowing more'.12\nWhat is remarkable about the uptake of Rancie\n` re's work in the field of education is that\nmany seem to have missed the particular `edge' of Rancie\n` re's argument \u00ad that is, that it's an\nargument about the role of knowledge in emancipatory education (and, more specifically, a\nrejection of the idea that emancipation `runs' on demystifying knowledge) \u00ad and have read it\nas a general discussion about education-as-instruction rather than a specific discussion of\neducation-as-emancipation. Moreover, the idea of the ignorant schoolmaster has been read\nalong the lines of contemporary constructivism, where it seems to have become `common\nsense' to claim that in education everything centres around student learning \u00ad their acts of\nsense making \u00ad and the only thing teachers can do is to facilitate such sense making, but they\ncannot \u00ad and according to some ought not \u00ad try to transfer knowledge from themselves to\nthe student.\nPelletier (2012: 615), for example, refers to this view when she writes that `teaching, as all\ngood, progressive teachers know, is not about transmitting knowledge, but enabling another\nRancie\n` re, when she writes that `it is now widely accepted that learning is not based on\nthe unilateral conveyance of knowledge from teacher to student', but rather that it is\n`more effective when students take an active part in knowledge building'. Against this\nbackground, she takes the key message of Rancie\n` re's The Ignorant Schoolmaster to be one\nof `[encouraging] learning through the use of one's own intelligence, experiment and\nThere is a similar tendency in the account Chambers (2013) gives of Rancie\n` re's\neducational theory. Although strongly focusing on political questions, Chambers, where it\nconcerns matters of education, comes close to a constructivist reading of Rancie\n` re as well,\nsuggesting that Rancie\n` re `advocates an utterly radical pedagogy' centred around a `rejection\nof mastery. . . of schoolmasters who know it all, and convey this knowing to their students'\n` re's `new pedagogy [as] a reversal of\nthe explicative order's primary assumption', suggesting that what is central to this new\npedagogy is students' `ability' to come to their own understanding (for example of a text)\n`without the explanations of a master' (Chambers, 2013: 644). He writes:\nWhen a student picks up a book and reads it for herself (even, as in the case of Jacotot's teaching\nexperiments, a book written in a language other than her mother tongue), then she is using the\nmethod of equality. This capacity for anyone to read the book without having someone else\ntelling them what it means \u00ad this is the power of equality, and this is all there is to equality.\nAgainst readings such as these \u00ad which don't promote a full-blown constructivism but do\ntend to take Rancie\n` re's argument as a general theory of education that should put the\nlearning and sense making of students at the centre \u00ad I wish to maintain that Rancie\n` re's\nwork provides us with an argument about teaching rather than learning and that the\n`location' of this argument is in the discussion about educational emancipation.\nWith regard to the first point \u00ad that Rancie\n` re is presenting an argument for teaching not\nfor learning \u00ad the claim Rancie\n` re makes in The Ignorant Schoolmaster is therefore not that\nanyone can learn without a teacher. This is not because Rancie\n` re would disagree with this\nclaim \u00ad as it stands, it simply is true \u00ad but because this is not what the discussion is about.\nThe claim Rancie\n` re rather makes (and here he distinguishes himself both from the modern\n`logic' of emancipation and from Freire) is that emancipation doesn't `run' on knowledge\n(which is why the argument should be read within the confines of the discussion about\neducational emancipation). It neither runs on a truth about the nature of the human\nbeing, nor on a truth about the objective condition of the one to be emancipated. It is for\nthis reason that an emancipatory teacher should not be understood as a teacher who\npossesses such knowledge, which is why the emancipatory teacher is characterised as\n`ignorant' (see also Rancie\nBut, to make the point one more time, this is not because the emancipatory teacher lacks\nknowledge, but because knowledge is not the `way' of emancipation. Here also lies the\nsignificance of Rancie\n` re's claim of equality as an assumption. Unlike Freire, Rancie\n` re\ndoesn't put a strong claim about the authentic existence of the human being on the table \u00ad\nand in this sense he is also explicitly un-Kantian \u00ad but articulates an explicitly political\n`interest' and an explicitly political `project'.13\nWhen Rancie\n` re writes, therefore, that `learning also takes place in the stultifiers' school'\n(Rancie\n` re, 1991: 102), it is precisely to show that emancipation is not about learning. There is\nnot only the point that learning can happen anywhere, with or without a teacher. There is\nalso the point that to `become' emancipated \u00ad and it is actually more accurate to say: to be\nemancipated \u00ad is not something that requires learning, but is about using one's intelligence\nunder the assumption of equality. Doing so is not to reveal a particular capacity \u00ad\nparticularly not the capacity to learn, interpret or make sense \u00ad but is rather to inscribe\noneself in the political project of equality (see also Biesta, 2010b). Of course, in order to\nuse one's intelligence in such a way, no teacher is needed; that is the whole point of using\none's own intelligence. Yet where the emancipatory teacher has a role is in those cases where\nstudents \u00ad and I would like to add: of any age \u00ad deny or refuse this option, either by claiming\nthat they are unable to think and act for themselves or by expressing that they are unwilling\nto think and act for themselves. The emancipatory teacher thus has a role in those situations\nwhere students deny or refuse their possibility for being a subject and prefer to be or remain\nan object. The particular intervention of the emancipatory teacher is aimed at this `attitude',\nif that's the appropriate term here.14\nRancie\n`re reading Rancie\n`re\nThere are two more points to add to the discussion, and they both have to do with\nRancie\n` re's own reflections on his work, also in response to the ways others have engaged\nwith it. One has to do with the question and status of explanation, as there seems to be a\ntendency in those commenting on Rancie\n` re's work to highlight the irony of trying to explain\nwhat the work is about when it seems to be quite critical of the logic of explanation.\nHowever, as I have tried to indicate in the preceding pages, we should not read\nRancie\n` re's argument as a case for the prohibition of explanation (on this, see also Stamp,\n` re is helpfully clear about this himself when he writes that `we can certainly use\nour status as legitimate ``transmitters'' to put our knowledge at others' disposal' and that this\nis actually what he himself is `constantly doing' (Rancie\nis that explanation \u00ad and particularly the attempt to explain what's really going on in\nanother person's head or life \u00ad is not the way of emancipation.\nThe second point, however, is more problematic from my perspective, as in later work\nRancie\n` re seems to be veering towards a constructivist reading of his own work, one where\nemancipation becomes understood as the freedom to learn and, more specific, the freedom to\ninterpret and make sense. In the line just quoted about legitimate transmitters, Rancie\n` re\nactually continues by saying that `what is ``stultifying'' from a Jacotist perspective is the will\nto anticipate the way in which they will grasp what we put at their disposal' (Rancie\n245). This becomes a bigger theme in The Emancipated Spectator, originally given as a talk in\n2004 and subsequently published as chapter 1 in a book with the same title (Rancie\nAlthough the discussion in this essay is on questions of theatre and the position of\nspectators, Rancie\n` re discusses this as an educational problematic as well, making explicit\nreference to The Ignorant Schoolmaster.16\nIn the rendition of the dynamics of education that Rancie\n` re provides in this discussion, he\nseems to have shifted from a focus on emancipatory teaching to a more general account of\neducation as a teaching-learning situation \u00ad or, as I have called it above, a general theory of\ninstruction. And the account Rancie\n` re gives here is one that comes close to a constructivist\nreading, where the dynamics of education are not that of transmission of knowledge from\nthe teacher to the student, but one where students learn through what we might term `trial\nand error' \u00ad in Rancie\n` re's words `the path from what she [the student] already knows to what\nshe does not yet know, but which she can learn just as she has learnt the rest' (Rancie\n` re,\n` re calls this `the poetic labour of translation', which he claims is `at the\nheart of all learning' (Rancie\n` re, 2009: 10). It is translation because it is a process where the\nstudent moves from what he or she already knows to what he or she does not yet know; and\nit is poetic because the student does not repeat what is already there, but invests his or her\nown understanding. As Rancie\n` re puts it:\nFrom this ignoramus, spelling out signs, to the scientist who constructs hypotheses, the same\nintelligence is always at work \u00ad an intelligence that translates signs into other signs and proceeds\nby comparisons and illustrations in order to communicate its intellectual adventures and\nunderstand what another intelligence is endeavouring to communicate to it.\n(Rancie\nIn this account, the teacher also appears in a different way from how I have discussed this\nabove, namely as a facilitator.\nHe does not teach his pupils his knowledge, but orders them to venture into the forest of things\nand signs, to say what they have seen want what they think of what they have seen, to verify it\nand have it verified.\n(Rancie\nWhat Rancie\n` re is describing here, then, is very much an account of learning rather than\nan account of teaching. Moreover, it is an account of learning in the general sense of\nmaking sense. And it could be read in constructivist terms, in that each individual \u00ad we\nmight even say each individual learner \u00ad constructs his or her own `story', or with the\nphrase Rancie\n` re uses: each individual `composes her own poem' (Rancie\nthing Rancie\n` re highlights in his account of this dynamic is that there is no direct\nrelationship between the teacher/performer and student/spectator and therefore neither\nthe ambition (Rancie\n` re, 2009: 14) nor the possibility for `uniform transmission'\n(Rancie\n` re, 2009: 15). There rather is always a `third thing' \u00ad the work of art, the\ntheatre performance, a book `or some other piece of writing' (Rancie\nthat is `alien to both' but to which they can refer `to verify in common what the pupil has\nseen, what she says about it and what she thinks of it' (Rancie\ntherefore, a radical openness of interpretation in relation to this `thing', and Rancie\n` re\ndoes indeed affirm that `in a theatre, in front of a performance, just as in a museum,\nschool or street, there are only ever individuals plotting their own paths in the forest of\nthings, acts and signs that confront and surround them' (Rancie\nprovides `starting points, intersections and junctions that enable us to learn something\nnew' (Rancie\nWhat is most remarkable about The Emancipated Spectator (Rancie\nfrom the perspective that I have been pursuing in the previous pages, is that Rancie\n` re\nseems to locate the emancipatory `moment' precisely in the acts of interpretation of\nspectators \u00ad and by implication in the acts of interpretation of students. In relation to the\n`new idiom' that emerges when artists `construct the stages where the manifestation and\neffect of their skills are exhibited', Rancie\n` re argues that `the effect of the idiom cannot be\nanticipated' and that it `requires spectators who play the role of active interpreters, who\ndevelop their own translation in order to appropriate the ``story'' and make it their own\nstory', from which he concludes that `an emancipated community is a community of\nnarrators and translators' (Rancie\nThere are two reasons why Rancie\n` re seems to end up here is problematic \u00ad one has to do\nwith the role of the teacher, the other with the status of emancipation. The first problem with\nthe constructivist `uptake' of Rancie\n` re's work \u00ad ironically, also by Rancie\n` re himself \u00ad is that\nthe unique position he had carved out for the teacher in emancipatory education seems to\nhave disappeared again. Rancie\n` re rather seems to be `back' where Freire already was, that is,\nwith the teacher as a facilitator of learning, a facilitator of students constructing their own\nstories. The second problem has to do with the question of whether everyone's freedom to\nconstruct their own story, a freedom which I have referred to elsewhere as the `freedom of\nsignification' (see Biesta, 2016), is a meaningful notion of freedom and hence a meaningful\nnotion of emancipation.\nI doubt that this is the case (for a detailed argument, see Biesta, 2016), because the\nquestion that immediately arises is what the criterion would be upon which we were to\njudge the different interpretations, significations or poems that people would come up\nwith. The freedom of signification thus appears as a kind of neo-liberal freedom, where\neveryone is free to articulate their own `story', rather than a political let alone a\ndemocratic freedom where there would always be a question about how the different\n`poems' would impact on the ways in which we live our lives together-in-equality, rather\nthan each of us being enclosed in our own story. This is not only remarkable given the fact\nthat the idea of equality plays such a key role in Rancie\n` re's writings. It is also remarkable\nbecause the figure of the emancipatory teacher that emerges from the reconstruction\nprovided above precisely depicts emancipatory teaching as an interruption of such a\nrelativistic set-up where students would only spin around in their own universe \u00ad\nemancipatory teaching as an interruption of the refusal to exist as subject.\nConclusions: Don't be fooled by ignorant schoolmasters\nIn this article I have tried to highlight Rancie\n` re's unique contribution to the discussion of\nemancipatory education by showing that, unlike what seems to be the thrust of Freire's\nview on emancipatory education, there is a clear role, task and identity for the teacher.\nUnlike in the case of critical pedagogy, this task is not to be understood as that of\nsupplanting false consciousness with true consciousness. But unlike Freire, Rancie\n` re\ndoesn't conclude from this that we should do away with the teacher. He rather\nhighlights the problems with the idea that emancipation `runs' on knowledge. This is\none sense in which the emancipatory teacher can be called ignorant. The other way in\nwhich the emancipatory teacher is ignorant is because this teacher does not start from\nknowledge about the alleged incapacity of the student, but rather from the assumption of\nthe equality of intelligence which, as I have shown, is precisely not a matter of knowledge\nor truth (and here again Rancie\n` re takes an approach that is fundamentally different from\nFreire's).\nThis, as I have tried to argue, has nothing to do with one way in which Rancie\n` re's work\nhas been interpreted, which is in terms of the idea that everything in education depends on\nthe meaning making by students, and that teachers can only be facilitators of this process\nand actually have nothing to give or anything to add.17 We should therefore not be fooled by\nthe figure of the ignorant schoolmaster by assuming that schoolmasters who have no\nknowledge to give also have no teaching to do and should therefore move to the side of\nthe classroom to become facilitators of learning. For Rancie\n` re the emancipatory\nschoolmaster is precisely that: a schoolmaster involved in the act of teaching. And\nsimilarly we should not be fooled by the idea that the freedom to learn and, more\nspecifically, the freedom of interpretation and signification, is the way in which we\ninscribe ourselves in the political project of equality.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nNotes\n1.

I would like to\nthank Alex Guilherme for the invitation to present at the conference and for his support in\ntransforming the presentation into an article. I am also grateful to three anonymous reviewers\nfor their helpful comments.\n2. There are also problems with Rancie\nA discussion of this aspect of Rancie\n` re's work lies beyond the scope of this article.\n3. In this and the following section I summarise a main line of thought develop in more detail in\n4. In German: `Der Mensch kann nur Mensch werden durch Erziehung. Er ist nichts, als was die\n5. In his detailed reading of Freire, Lewis (2012) seems to underplay this particular aspect of Freire's\nwork and keeps him closer to the neo-Marxist understanding of oppression as the exertion of\nunwarranted power by the oppressor(s) over the oppressed, so that the main emancipatory `act' is\nthat of demystification (see, for example, Lewis, 2012: 104). Although, as I will argue below,\ndemystification does play a role in Freire's overall conception of emancipatory education, the\nbasic `logic' of emancipation is conceived in terms of overcoming alienation, not oppressive power.\n6. Although here Freire comes closer to the idea of false consciousness, and thus to an understanding\nof oppression that is closer to neo-Marxist critical theory, his `solution' at this point is not to revert\nto explanation, but rather to joint action (co-intending, in Freire's vocabulary).\n7. This is an important point, because many readers of The Ignorant Schoolmaster seem to assume\nthat Rancie\n` re simply provides a description of Jacotot's theory and simply endorses this theory.\nWhile it is sometimes difficult to see where Jacotot ends and Rancie\n` re begins, I nonetheless wish to\nmake a radical distinction between the two and wish to suggest a reading of The Ignorant\nSchoolmaster that focuses on the argument Rancie\n` re makes `through' the story of Jacotot. It is\nof course legitimate to refer to Jacotot's ideas themselves, but in that case I would argue that The\nIgnorant Schoolmaster is an unreliable source for this and readers should rather engage with\nJacotot's own writings.\n8. What here appears as a set of (rhetorical) questions about teaching, can also be read as a critique of\nBourdieu and particularly of the application of Bourdieu's ideas about cultural (and increasingly\nalso, social) capital to education \u00ad see the introduction by Kristin Ross in Rancie\n9. To refer to this as an act of revelation is slightly misleading, as it may reduce Rancie\n` re's\nemancipatory logic to that of explanation. Below, I will provide a different and in my view\nmore accurate formulation of emancipatory teaching, one where the act of emancipatory\nteaching appears as that of forbidding the student the apparent satisfaction of claiming that one\nis unable to learn and know without the help of a teacher-explicator.\n10. In comparing Freire and Rancie\n` re, Lewis (2012) suggests that in Freire we find a focus on freedom\nwith little attention to the question of equality; whereas in Rancie\n` re, we find a focus on equality\nwith little attention to the question of freedom. Although it is true that Rancie\n` re seeks to articulate\na logic of emancipation that starts from the assumption of equality rather than the assumption of\ninequality, Rancie\n` re's observation that students cannot escape the exercise of their liberty indicates\nthat Lewis's claim that `universal teaching remains silent on the question of freedom' (Lewis, 2012:\n73) is perhaps not entirely accurate. After all, as I will discuss below, central to the emancipatory\n`act' of the teacher is the interruption of the students' denial or rejection of their freedom.\n11. For a further discussion of differences and similarities between Freire and Rancie\n` re, see Galloway\n12. Both formulations sound in a sense remarkably Kantian, as one could imagine that one way in\nwhich the emancipatory teacher might enact this is by telling students that they should have the\ncourage to use their own intelligence, which is in line with Kant's formulation of the `motto' of\nEnlightenment as Sapere aude! \u00ad have the courage to use your own understanding. On the\ndimension of encouragement, see also Sonderegger (2014). While I agree therefore with Lewis\nthat there is a strong Kantian `streak' in Rancie\n` re's work, I would not locate this in the alleged\ncentrality of the emancipatory teacher's `command' to the students that they should follow their\nown path (see Lewis, 2012: 78-79), but with the interruption of the students' denial of their ability\nto use their own understanding, that is, a denial of their freedom.\n13. In terms of the `uptake' of Rancie\n` re's work in the field of education, it is probably also important\nto mention that his argument may not be first and foremost directed at a particular configuration\nof the school, but rather that it is first and foremost a critique of society in so far as it operates on a\nparticular logic of schooling \u00ad a thesis discussed in more detail in Bingham and Biesta (2010),\nparticularly the concluding chapter, `The world is not a school'.\n14. One way in which this `intervention' can be enacted, as I have shown, is `negative', that is by\ndenying the student the alleged satisfaction of their inability to think and know for themselves. But\nthere is also a more `positive' enactment of this emancipatory gesture, which is where teachers\napproach students as subjects even if all the `evidence' suggests the opposite. On this dynamic, see\n15. See also chapter 1 in Lewis (2012), which provides a compelling account of the differences and\nsimilarities between Rancie\n` re and Althusser.\n16. I agree with a comment made by one of the reviewers of this manuscript that the question of\neducational emancipation is to be distinguished from the question of emancipation in the context\nof art. After all, we should not automatically assume that art is educational, or that education is\n`artistic'. I use the word `artistic' in order to distinguish the argument here from the discussion\nabout the aesthetics of education, about which Lewis (2012) has provided a highly original and, to\na large degree, compelling argument. The reason for raising the issue of the relationship between\nart and education in my argument is because Rancie\n` re himself draws the two closely together in\nThe Emancipated Spectator.\n17. The `stronger' version of this line of thought argues that teachers ought not give anything to their\nstudents, as doing so would limit their freedom, which is the mistake upon which extreme forms of\nchild-centred education are based.\nReferences\nBiesta GJJ (2009) What is at stake in a pedagogy of interruption?
