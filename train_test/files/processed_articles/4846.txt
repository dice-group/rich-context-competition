Concisely stated,\nindividuals with higher status have increased access to mating opportunities (be it potential\nor actual mates), potentially leading to higher reproductive success (Betzig, 1986;\ninvestigate this central thesis in middle adolescence. We propose that middle adolescence\npresents an interesting phase in human ontogeny to test this thesis for two reasons. First, in\nmiddle adolescence, status hierarchies based on social dominance, reputation, and\nconsensual popularity are ubiquitous, highly stable, and firmly embedded (Cillessen and\nHierarchies and sexual activity\nWeisfeld, 1987). Second, emerging sexuality is fundamental to adolescence (Schlegel,\n(14-15 years), access to mating opportunities is still a scarce resource, with mating\nopportunities for some but not for others. We therefore hypothesized that high-status\nmiddle adolescent individuals would be more sexually active than low-status middle\nadolescent individuals.\nEvolutionary Psychology: Status and Reproductive Success\nBehavioral theories concerning sexual behavior, such as Sexual Selection Theory\nStrategies Theory (e.g., Buss, 2003) are firmly embedded in an evolutionary framework\nand have successfully predicted one important reward that is bestowed on high-status\nindividuals: more mating opportunities and thus increased reproductive success (Barkow,\n1989), particularly for males of most species. According to Betzig (1986), \"hierarchical\npower should predict a biased outcome in conflict resolution, which should in turn predict\nsize of the winner's harem, for men, a measure of success in reproduction\" (p. 9). This is\ntrue for human adults in many cultures, both `modern' as well as `primitive' (Betzig, 1986).\nIn fact, this theory seems to be confirmed for non-human primates (Cheney, 1983;\nanimals from widely differing ecologies (Ellis, 1995) such as squirrels (Farentinos, 1972),\ncockerels (Kratzer and Craig, 1980), and cockroaches (Breed, Smith, and Gall, 1980).\nFor females, it is generally argued that dominance is not necessarily a path to more\ncopulations, as it is for males. It appears that important benefits bestowed upon dominant\nwomen are access to resources and less harassment from rivals (Campbell, 2002). Thus,\ndominant females tend to have higher offspring survival rates, at least among simians\n(Pusey, Williams, and Goodall, 1997); thus, dominance among females also appears to be\nlinked to reproductive success.\nIn humans, status hierarchies are continuously present across ontogeny, starting at\nthe age at which children first interact in small groups. Consequently, hierarchies based on\ndominance, prestige, or consensual popularity are found among preschoolers (e.g., Hawley,\nJohnson, Mize, and McNamara, 2007; Hawley and Little, 1999; Pellegrini, Roseth, Milner,\nBohn, Van Ryzin, Vance, Cheatham, and Tarullo, 2007; Strayer and Strayer, 1976), in\nchildhood (Omark, Omark, and Edelman, 1975; Zeller, Vannatta, Shafer, and Noll, 2003),\n2005; Hawley, 1999). From a Darwinian view, high status should carry some kind of\nreward or privilege (Henrich and Gil-White, 2001). These rewards range from toys in\ntoddlerhood to an increase in quality and quantity of mates in adulthood.\nStatus Hierarchies in Middle Adolescence\nSchool systems in Western society place individuals from the age of toddlerhood up\ninto late adolescence in small groups (classrooms of up to 30 students) of same-aged peers\nfor long periods of time (8 hours daily, 5 days a week). This educational organization is\nfertile ground for the formation of status hierarchies and developmental psychologists are\nincreasingly identifying the behaviors that determine the emergence of peer status in\nHierarchies and sexual activity\nmiddle adolescence. The main status hierarchy in middle adolescence is based on\ndominance, prestige, and reputation, often referred to as perceived popularity (Cillessen\nreputational popularity (Prinstein and Cillessen, 2003), or consensual popularity (De\nBruyn and Van den Boom, 2005; De Bruyn and Cillessen, 2006a). The last term reflects the\nfact that this type of popularity does not measure personal liking but the shared view of the\npeer group of who is socially dominant or socially central. The terms social dominance and\nconsensual popularity are both in common usage in the child and adolescent psychological\nliterature. However, the term popularity never applies to non-humans, and considering that\nthe present article intends to provide an evolutionarily framed explanation of adolescent\nbehavior by drawing on information from both animal and human research, we decided to\nuse the term dominant-popular to indicate adolescent individuals who are at the top of the\nsocial dominance cum reputation-based popularity hierarchy.\nDominant-popular middle adolescents tend to be attractive, fashionable, athletic\n(especially in the US, but less so in, for instance, China, e.g., Dong, et al., 1996), and\naggressive and high in bullying (Cillessen and Mayeux, 2004; Cillessen and Rose, 2005;\nmost modern Western societies, the dominance-popularity hierarchy in middle adolescence\nis a well-described hierarchical organization of which individuals at the high end exhibit an\nidiosyncratic behavioral profile based on a combination of attractiveness, sartorial finesse,\nand aggression or fighting ability.\nSex as a Scarce Resource in Middle Adolescence\nIn Western societies, most middle adolescence children enter pubescence.\nPubescence is sexual maturation and, not surprisingly, an important main motivational\nchange takes place in middle adolescence around sexual behavior (Jones and Bayley, 1950;\nWeisfeld, 1999). In middle adolescence, sexual relationships are becoming an important,\nyet scarce, resource for both boys and girls (Pellegrini and Bartini, 2001). Thus, it appears\nthat some adolescents have many partners, some have one, but the majority has none\nadolescence a time of great competitiveness for the same sexually active peers. Cultural\nvariability between Western and tribal societies does exist, where in the majority of tribal\nsocieties, premarital sex during puberty is typical for boys and girls (Broude and Greene,\n1976). However, the present article is concerned with a typical modern society in Western\nEurope.\nAlthough the idea of sexual relationships has firmly inundated the adolescent mind,\ntaking the first step of approach or flirtation towards someone else is risky. By doing so, an\nadolescent crosses the boundary of sex-segregation that has been in place since middle\nchildhood (Maccoby 1998; Pellegrini and Long, 2003). Any initiative towards a member of\nthe opposite sex may end in rejection and public humiliation. Thus, it is hypothesized that it\ntakes an adolescent with a certain behavioral repertoire and status to cross that boundary. It\nis unlikely that this type of middle adolescent is at the bottom of the peer group hierarchy,\nbut is more likely to be a high-status, dominant-popular peer.\nThe notion of sex as a resource, for which adolescents compete intensely, is not\nnew. Several developmental psychologists have postulated this notion (e.g., Pellegrini,\nHierarchies and sexual activity\nSeveral studies point towards the notion that adolescents who display behaviors typical of\ndominant-popular peers are more sexually active than low-ranking ones. For instance,\nMazur, Halpern, and Udry (1994) revealed that dominant looking males had more coital\nopportunities than submissive looking ones. Adolescent boys high in toughness and\nfighting ability appeared popular with girls (Feldman and Weisfeld, 1973) and bullies have\nbeen found to date relatively early (Connolly, Pepler, Craig, and Taradash, 2000). More\nrecent studies in the US have reported a positive association between dominance-popularity\nstatus and sexual activity (Mayeux, Sandstrom, and Cillessen, 2008) and the practice of\noral sex (Prinstein, Meade and Cohen, 2003), both studies conducted among older\nadolescents. However, we were unable to find studies of the relationship between\ndominance-popularity status and actual sexual activity in middle adolescence. Pellegrini\nconfirming this relationship by using dating popularity as a proxy for sexual activity. The\npresent study was designed to fill this lacuna by asking middle adolescents about their\nactual sexual activity. Therefore:\nHypothesis 1: High dominant-popular adolescents report higher sexual activity levels than\ntheir low dominant-popular peers.\nDominance-Popularity and Gender Differences in Behavior\nAn important question is whether we should expect gender differences in the\nbehavioral repertoire associated with dominance and sexual activity. Barkow (1989)\npredicted that intersexual (mate choice) selection by females depends on three criteria.\nFirst, desirable males should possess an agonistic quality based on physique; second,\ndesirable males should show willingness to provide parental investment; and third, they\nshould display the ability for parental investment. However, parental investment should\nmatter less in middle adolescence than in adulthood, considering the fluidity of dating in\nmiddle adolescence and the preponderance of short-term relationships (Laumann, et al.,\n1994; Sorensen, 1973). Relevant to this line of reasoning is that adult women, when\nseeking short-term relationships, placed great emphasis on adult male physical prowess\naggression found in early adolescence (e.g., Bj\u00f6rkvist, Lagerspetz, and Kaukianen, 1992)\nwas likely due to both intrasexual competition with the aim of subduing rivals, and\nintersexual competition with the aim of displaying attributes that attract females (Campbell,\n1999). In the case of middle adolescent males, both strategies are greatly abetted by\nphysical strength and agonistic behavior. Pellegrini and colleagues (Pellegrini and Bartini,\n2001; Pellegrini and Long, 2003) also showed that aggression to gain dominance was\npositively related to hypothetical dating preference. The present research will look at sexual\nactivity level instead of hypothetical dating preferences. Therefore, we expected a strong\nassociation among middle adolescent males between aggression and sexual activity. Hence:\nHypothesis 2: Sexually active middle adolescent boys are high in fighting and bullying\nbehaviors.\nA different behavioral profile was expected of sexually precocious middle\nadolescent girls. Based on principles derived from evolutionary psychology, Campbell\nHierarchies and sexual activity\ntowards intersexual mate attraction and intrasexual competition. The passive strategy is a\ndemonstration of attributes that are valued highly by males, such as youth and beauty.\nSeveral studies among adults have demonstrated this strategy (Buss and Barnes, 1986;\nRhodes, 2006; Rhodes, Simmons, and Peters, 2005). In fact, physical attractiveness among\ngirls probably serves as a two-sided sword: attracting interesting males and also\nintimidating other girls (Campbell, 2002). The active strategy is aimed at subduing rivals,\nand girls thereby gain access to valuable resources and the best mates. Although it is\ncorrect to say that women do not really have to fight each other in order to mate (because\nthey can always find a willing male), it makes sense for them to vie for the highest quality\nmates available. In fact, research has shown that antagonism is as rife among girls as it is\namong boys, with a similar peak in middle adolescence (e.g., Bj\u00f6rkvist et al., 1992).\nHowever, due to the greater risk to their reproductive fitness and the fact that females gain\nless from multiple matings secured by fighting than do males, females tend to avoid direct\nridicule, defamation, shunning, and malicious gossip (Bj\u00f6rkvist et al., 1992; Hess and\nmiddle adolescent girls' success at dating was associated with indirect aggression such as\ngossip. Also, a link has been found between aggression among girls and their subsequent\nnumber of children (Underwood, Kupersmidt, and Coie, 1996), indicating a reproductive\nfitness payoff, even for females. Thus:\nHypothesis 3: Sexually active middle adolescent girls are physically attractive and high in\nrelational aggression such as gossip.\nResearch Goals of the Present Study\nThis study examined different types of middle adolescents through an individual\ndifferences approach by examining status and behavioral profiles consisting of dominance-\npopularity status, behavioral repertoire, and sexual activity in middle adolescence. It was\nhypothesized that highly dominant-popular middle adolescents who display high levels of\naggression (physical for boys, relational for girls) and attractiveness (in particular for girls),\nare relatively sexually precocious at the age of 14 years.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants and Procedure\ntwo secondary schools in The Netherlands. Because a few students were absent during\ntesting due to illness or other reasons, the actual sample consisted of 354 students (177\nThe data came from an ongoing project on school behavior and achievement across\nadolescence, and were collected in early spring at two high schools in two different cities in\nThe Netherlands. Prior to data collection, the school board sent a letter to all parents\ncontaining detailed information about the study. Parents were informed that students would\nbe asked about their behaviors (e.g., interpersonal and sexual) and their peers' behaviors.\nHierarchies and sexual activity\nThe letter indicated that student participation was voluntary. Parents could return the letter\nif they did not wish their child to participate. According to Dutch law, IRB approval was\nnot needed for this study due to its non-experimental nature. None of the parents refused\nparticipation.\nResearch assistants administered the computer-based questionnaire to students\nindividually during quiet study periods at school. Students had been informed that\nparticipation was voluntary and that their answers would be kept confidential. In addition,\nstudent assent was obtained on the day of data collection. Immediately prior to testing,\nstudents were reminded of the goals of the study and the voluntary nature of their\nparticipation. All students present at the time of data collection agreed to participate and\ncompleted the questionnaire. It was not possible to hold makeup sessions at a later date for\nstudents who were absent on the day of testing (13 boys and 14 girls)\nMeasures\nPeer nominations. In order to collect data regarding participants' social status and\nsocial behaviors, sociometric methods were used. Students were presented with a list of\nnames of all classmates in which the first names were in alphabetical order. A computer\nprogram ensured that a student's own name did not appear in this list. Although students in\nthe participating schools share breaks in common areas, the majority of school time (7 to 8\nhours daily) was spent with students from their own classroom. Therefore, nominations\nwere restricted to the student's own classroom. Cross-gender voting was permitted.\nDominance-popularity, social behavior, and appearance. Positive and negative\nnominations were solicited for ten constructs. These constructs fell into four groups: social\ndominance-popularity, antisocial behavior, prosocial behavior, and physical appearance.\nFor each construct, participants were again asked to name three classmates who displayed it\nthe most and three who displayed it the least. By using both positive and negative\nnominations, a broad picture of adolescents' traits and behaviors was obtained. Dominance-\npopularity was assessed by two separate constructs, social dominance and consensual\npopularity. Social dominance was assessed by asking participants to nominate three\nclassmates who \"played the boss\" most and three classmates who \"played the boss\" least.\nIn Dutch \"Playing the boss\" corresponds most closely to the concept of being dominant.\nAsking directly who is most and least dominant was not comprehended well by\nrespondents in pilot studies. In addition to social dominance, a traditional measure of\nadolescent peer group status was assessed: consensual popularity. Participants were asked\nto indicate three classmates who were most popular and three classmates who were least\npopular. Antisocial behavior was measured by nominating three classmates who displayed\nthe following behaviors most and three who displayed these behaviors least: \"is mean,\" and\n\"bullies.\" Two other types of antisocial behavior were investigated, physical and relational\naggression. Physical aggression was assessed by nominations of three classmates who\n\"fight\" most and three who \"fight\" least. Relational aggression was assessed by\nnominations of three classmates who \"gossip\" most and three who do this least. Prosocial\nbehavior was measured with three most and three least nominations of \"keeps promises\"\nand three most and three least nominations of being \"friendly\". The former has been shown\nto be correlated with being considered friendly (e.g., De Bruyn and Van den Boom, 2005).\nAlso, keeping promises has been argued to be the cornerstone of the evolution of reciprocal\naltruism, or `tit-for-tat' behavior (Axelrod, 1984). Finally, physical attractiveness was\nHierarchies and sexual activity\nmeasured by most and least nominations of \"attractive\" and \"dressing hip\".\nIn addition, five constructs were included for cluster analysis validating purposes\n(e.g., De Bruyn and Cillessen, 2006a): leadership, friendships, academic behaviors, being\nvictimized, and being considered boring. The first was assessed by asking participants to\nnominate three classmates they consider most like a leader and three they consider least\nlike a leader. The second was assessed by asking participants to nominate three classmates\nwhom they consider their best friends and three classmates with whom they would never\nwant to be friends. Academic behavior was assessed by asking participants to nominate\nthree classmates who \"showed disrespect to teachers\" most and three who showed\ndisrespect to teachers least, and three classmates who \"are attentive in class\" most and three\nwho were least attentive in class. For victimization, participants were asked to nominate\nclassmates who were victimized most. For being considered boring, participants were\nasked to nominate three classmates who were most, and three classmates who were least\nboring. Each validating construct was chosen because past research had shown high\nassociations with the clustering variables used in the cluster analysis. For instance, being\nconsidered a leader is closely related to dominance-popularity; the number of nominated\nfriendships is highly associated with being considered friendly; academic behavior is\nassociated with dominance-popularity, in particular for a subgroup of dominant-popular\nstudents (see, e.g., De Bruyn and Cillessen, 2006a; Farmer, Estell, Bishop, O'Neal, and\nCairns, 2003; Jonkmann, Trautwein, and L\u00fcdtke, 2009); and being considered boring has\nbeen shown to be highly correlated with low dominance-popularity (e.g., De Bruyn and\nFor all of the above nomination constructs, the difference between the number of\npositive and negative nominations received was computed for each student and\nstandardized within classrooms.\nSexual activity. Middle adolescent sexual activity was assessed by two methods,\nself-report and a report by a designated \"social expert\". The first method consisted of\nasking each participant whether or not they had engaged in (1) kissing, (2) heavy petting\n(defined as genital touching and/or oral sex), and (3) sexual intercourse. The phrasing of\nthese questions followed procedures from a nationwide Dutch questionnaire on sexuality in\nadolescence conducted by the Dutch Ministry of Health (De Graaf, Meijer, Poelman, and\nVanwesenbeeck, 2005). Subsequently, participants were categorized into three groups:\nthose who had done \"nothing,\" those who had \"only kissed,\" and those who had engaged in\n\"heavy petting and/or intercourse.\"\nThe second method consisted of interviewing social experts about the sexual\nactivity of classmates. Social experts were appointed by the headmaster of each class in\nresponse to the question `which two boys and two girls in your class are the most\nknowledgeable about their classmates' social lives?' The social experts were interviewed\nprivately and were asked to indicate each classmate's sexual activity level in the same\nwording as the self-report. If they had no knowledge about a classmate's sexual activity,\nthey left their answer blank. The rank-order correlation between self-reports and social\nexperts was .78 (P < .01), validating the self-report of sexual activity. Subsequently, the\nself-reported data were used in the analyses.\nResults\nHierarchies and sexual activity\nResults are presented in four sections. First, descriptive statistics of all variables are\npresented. Second, cluster analyses were conducted as an individual differences person-\ncentered method in order to identify groups of adolescents with idiosyncratic patterns of\nstatus and behavior (e.g., De Bruyn and Cillessen, 2006a). Third, the clusters were\ncompared in terms of their sexual activity level. And fourth, a variable-centered approach\nwas applied, in which an ANOVA was used to identify differences in behavior and sexual\nactivity level at the univariate level. In order to investigate multivariate associations\nbetween status, behavior, and sexual activity, a discriminant function analysis was\nconducted. This multiple-method approach is very pertinent to identifying subgroups of\nadolescents as well as the specific behaviors associated with differing levels of sexual\nactivity. A good example of this kind of multi-method approach is Jonkmann, et al.'s\n(2009) study on the heterogeneity of social dominance behaviors. Gender was included in\nall analyses.\nDescriptive Statistics of Status and Behaviors by Gender\nA 2 (Gender) MANOVA on clustering and validating variables used in this study\nyielded a multivariate effect of gender, F9, 344\ntests (see Table 1) revealed a small gender difference in favor of girls for being dominant-\npopular (.01; the effect size, partial 2\nGender Differences in Status and Behaviors in Early Adolescence\nBoys Girls Effect Size\nValidating variables\n, in parentheses), being friendly (.02), keeping\npromises (.02), being attractive (.01) and being attentive in class (.02). A small gender\ndifference in favor of boys was found for being victimized (.02). An intermediate gender\ndifference in favor of boys was found for bullying (.03). Large gender differences were\nfound for being a gossip (.11), hip dress (.04) (both in favor of girls), and fighting (.12) (in\nfavor of boys). No other gender differences were encountered.\nHierarchies and sexual activity\nIdentification and Description of Clusters\nWe chose cluster analysis as the first method of analysis because of the person-\ncentered approach. This approach has been very fruitful in the past in discovering subtypes\nof individuals who may be high on one dimension (e.g., dominance-popularity) but who\nmay differ widely on other dimensions, such as aggression and likeability (e.g., De Bruyn\nHierarchical cluster analysis was used to classify boys and girls on the basis of\ndominance-popularity status, friendliness, and the behavioral dimensions. In order to\nminimize within-cluster variance, Ward's method of clustering was used (Aldenderfer and\nBlashfield, 1984). This resulted in a three-cluster solution for both genders. Because cluster\nsolution is affected by sample size, membership stability was tested by applying the same\ncluster technique to a two-thirds random selection of the original sample. This new cluster\nanalysis revealed a stable pattern with 87% of the participants maintaining their original\ncluster membership.\nBoys. A 3 (Cluster) MANOVA was conducted on the scores for dominance-\npopularity, friendliness, and the behavioral dimensions.

Based on these\ncomparisons, the clusters were described as follows: High Dominant-Popular (N = 32,\n18%), boys were characterized as very dominant-popular, playing the boss, fighting a lot,\nbeing mean, bullies, attractive, and dressing hip. They were judged low on friendliness and\nlow on keeping promises. The second cluster was named Average Boys (N = 117, 62%),\nconsidering that as a group, these boys were judged average in dominance-popularity and\nthey did not display extreme behaviors. The third cluster was named Low Dominant-\nPopular (N = 28, 15%). The latter group's behavioral profile was characterized by very low\nscores on dominance-popularity, friendliness, playing the boss, fighting, gossip, mean,\nattractive, and hip dress.\nGirls. A 3 (Cluster) MANOVA was also conducted on the clustering variables for\ngirls, again yielding a significant multivariate effect for cluster, F20, 330\npartial 2 = .61.

Cluster means with different subscripts are significantly different from one another at P < .01.\nHierarchies and sexual activity\nPost-hoc comparisons with Bonferonni corrections demonstrated how the three\nclusters of girls differed on the clustering variables (see Table 3). This led to the following\ncluster descriptions. High Dominant-Popular (N = 28, 17%). Girls in this cluster were\njudged as highly dominant-popular, playing the boss, gossips, mean, bully, attractive, and\nhip dressed. They were judged low on friendliness and keeping promises. The second\ncluster was named Average Girls (N = 88, 46%). The third cluster was called Low\nDominant-Popular (N = 61, 32%) based on their behavioral profile. The profile of girls in\nthis cluster was characterized by low scores on dominance-popularity, playing the boss,\nfighting, gossiping, being mean, bullying, attractiveness, and dressing hip.\nValidation of Clusters\nThe clusters were further validated by comparing them on six variables not used to\ngenerate the clusters: leadership nominations, number of friendship nominations, being\nvictimized, being disrespectful to teachers, being attentive in class, and being considered\nboring (for an example of this type of validation, see De Bruyn and Cillessen, 2006a).\nThese variables have all been found to be highly associated with social dominance and\npopularity in previous studies. For both boys and girls, a 3 (Cluster) MANOVA was\nconducted on these variables. The multivariate effect of cluster was significant for both\nboys and girls. For boys, the multivariate effect was F12, 338\n.53. Univariate effects were significant for each variable. For leadership nominations, F2,\n=\nFor girls, the multivariate effect was F\ncorrected paired comparisons (see Table 2) indicated that High Dominant-Popular boys\nwere chosen more often as leader than Average Boys and Low Dominant-Popular boys.\nHigh Dominant-Popular boys were nominated less often as a friend than Average Boys, but\ndid not differ from Low Dominant-Popular boys on this dimension. High Dominant-\nPopular boys were highest in disrespect to teachers and lowest in attentiveness in class.\nAlso, High Dominant-Popular boys were considered least boring. Low Dominant-Popular\nboys were victimized most and were most respectful to teachers. Low Dominant-Popular\nboys were also considered very boring.\nUnivariate effects were significant for all variables. For leadership nominations, F2, 174\n=\ncorrected paired comparisons indicated that High Dominant-Popular girls received more\nleadership nominations than either Average Girls or Low Dominant-Popular girls (see\nTable 3). High Dominant-Popular girls received fewer friendship nominations than\nAverage Girls, but equal to Low Dominant-Popular girls. High Dominant-Popular girls\nwere very disrespectful to teachers and low in attentiveness in class. Low Dominant-\nPopular girls were considered very boring, very attentive in class, and they were not\ndisrespectful to teachers. Also, Low Dominant-Popular girls were victimized most.\nHierarchies and sexual activity\nSexual Activity by Gender\nThe self-report measures of sexual activity indicated that for boys, 24% (n = 42)\nhad done `nothing', 46% (n = 82) had `only kissed', and 30% (n = 53) had engaged in\n`heavy petting and/or intercourse'. For girls, 24% (n = 42) had done `nothing', 51% (n =\n90) had `only kissed', and 25% (n = 45) had engaged in `heavy petting and/or intercourse'.\nThese numbers are comparable to national average estimates reported by De Graaf et al.\nboys had had sexual intercourse. For girls, these national average estimates were 11% at\nSexual Activity by Cluster\nTo address the main research question of this study, the three clusters were\ncompared on sexual activity. Boys in the High Dominant-Popular cluster reported the\nhighest level of sexual activity: 69% reported having engaged in heavy petting and/or\nintercourse. The percentages for the other clusters were: Average Boys, 25%; and Low\nDominant-Popular boys, 7.1% (see Figure 1).\nFigure 1. Sexual activity level by cluster membership for middle adolescent boys.\nPlanned comparisons indicated a significant difference in the level of sexual activity\nbetween the High Dominant-Popular cluster and the other two clusters.

Also confirmed was the fact that these boys were very\naggressive, bossy and bullies. They were also considered very attractive. As expected, the\nhighly dominant-popular girls were considered very attractive and high in relational\naggression.\nUnivariate Analyses of Behavior and Sexual Activity Level\nIn addition to the person-centered method of cluster analysis, we chose to also\nperform a variable-centered approach, namely ANOVA. The ANOVA's showed that\nmiddle adolescents who had performed heavy petting and/or intercourse differed\nremarkably from peers who had done `nothing' or merely kissed. In fact, they differed\nsignificantly on all behavioral aspects except being friendly and being nominated as best\nfriend (see Table 4).\nHigh Dominant-Popular Average Low Dominant-Popular\nHeavy Petting/ Intercourse\nKiss Only\nNothing\nHierarchies and sexual activity\nMeans of all Variables by Sexual Activity Level\nBoys Girls\nNothing Kissed Intercourse 2 Nothing Kissed Intercourse 2\nNote.

Some gender differences were also apparent. A comparison of sexually active\nadolescent boys and girls revealed that sexually active boys fought far more than sexually\nconsidered slightly more attractive, more fashionable, and far more gossipy than sexually\nMultivariate Analysis of Behavior and Sexual Activity Level\nIn order to assess the relative contributions of the individual behaviors as assessed\nby univariate analyses (see the above section), a Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA;\nTabachnik and Fidell, 2007) was performed for boys and girls separately. After inspection\nof the univariate analyses (see Table 4), it appeared that the largest group differences\nencountered were between adolescents who had intercourse versus the rest. Based on this\ninspection, we decided to combine adolescents who had done nothing with those who had\nmerely kissed, thereby creating two groups, non-sex versus sex. All variables were then\nHierarchies and sexual activity\nentered into the DFA in order to predict the respective group membership.\nStructure Matrix for the Discriminant Function Analysis of Status and Behavioral Variables\nBoys Girls\nStarts fights .67 Disrespects teacher .69\nDominant-Popular .57 Keeps promises -.50\nNote: Loadings less than .50 are not shown\nThe DFA for boys yielded one discriminant function, with Wilks' Lambda = 0.75\nshown in Table 5.

Also, they were considered more of a leader, more dominant-popular, and hip\ndressed. For girls, 85.3% of the original cases were classified correctly, with most\nmisclassifications due to girls who had had sex classified as not having had sex.\nHierarchies and sexual activity\nnegative peer-directed and teacher-directed behaviors, and were considered far more\ndominant-popular than adolescents who had not yet had sex.\nDiscussion\nThe present study confirmed the three hypotheses stated in the introduction. That is,\nmiddle adolescents who are highly dominant-popular and who also display high levels of\nbullying and (relational) aggression are sexually precocious. Individuals at the other end of\nthe status and behavior spectrum, i.e., low dominant-popular, withdrawn, and victimized\nmiddle adolescents, are the least sexually precocious. The hypothesized gender differences\nin behavioral profile of sexually precocious adolescents were also confirmed. That is,\nsexually active middle adolescent boys were highly dominant-popular and physically\naggressive (and also attractive), and sexually active middle adolescent girls were highly\ndominant-popular, attractive and relationally aggressive.\nAdolescence marks the beginning of sexual maturation, and is thus a time when\nwithin-sex competition should rise. Sexual strategies theory (Buss, 2003; Campbell, 2002)\npredicts that both sexes set out to win this competition: boys through overt aggression and\nbullying, girls through being attractive and using relational aggression. By using\naggression, middle adolescent boys can show off their strength and dominance to their male\nrivals and to potential female mates (Pellegrini, 2002). Bullying may be a successful way\nfor them to lower their rivals' chances of romantic success. It is also a signal to the opposite\nsex that they are interesting and should be given attention. In fact, intra-sexual competition\nprobably evolved through the process of sexual selection (Buss, 1996; Darwin, 1871). That\nis, what predicts a top ranking among sex-mates (intra-sexual competition) is also what\nmembers of the opposite sex look for in potential mates (inter-sexual competition). Thus,\nthere is just one hierarchy for each sex (e.g., Weisfeld, Bloch, and Ivers, 1983; 1984).\nFor girls and boys, physical attractiveness was positively associated with a high\npeer group status and sexual activity. The positive association between attractiveness and\nstatus in middle adolescence has been shown before, but the current study also shows\nconnections with sexual behavior. Also, Udry and Billy (1987) found that US adolescent\ngirls (ages 14-17) with high testosterone and high attractiveness had the strongest sex\ndrives. It is no surprise that intra-sex competition among girls is aimed at lowering rivals'\nstatus (derived from their attractiveness) through derogation. Buss and Dedden (1990)\nshowed that in the US, reputation-hurting through gossip is common among girls. In a UK\nstudy, Duncan (2004) also showed that this derogation is often aimed at humiliating a girl\nfor her sexual success, for example, through name calling. Also, Campbell (2002), studying\nfemale gangs in the UK and the US, has cogently argued that reputation-bashing among\ngirls is most likely aimed at sexual promiscuity, that is, calling a girl a `whore' or `slut' is\nthe most effective way of destroying a girl's reputation among peers. Other studies\nconducted in Mexico (Fry, 1992), Bolivia (Holmberg, 1969), Argentina (Hines and Fry,\n1994) and the US (Campbell, 1994) showed that intra-female competition is rife, fierce,\nand invariably involves a sexual partner.\nWe suggest that highly dominant-popular adolescent boys have Resource Holding\nPower (RHP), whereas highly dominant-popular adolescent girls have some RHP, but rely\nalso and perhaps more heavily on Social Attention Holding Power (SAHP; Gilbert, Price,\nand Allan, 1995). Gilbert et al. typified RHP as a `threat' display (i.e., the individual gains\nHierarchies and sexual activity\npower through direct aggression), and SAHP as an `attractive' display (the individual gains\npower through attractive personal qualities). Both types of power, however, make the\nindividual feel esteemed. In fact, a positive association has been found between self-esteem\nand status (De Bruyn and Van den Boom, 2005). Also, self-esteem takes a prominent place\nin Barkow's (1989) theorizing about status and reproductive success. He postulated that\nself-esteem consists mainly of \"an ongoing comparison of the self-representation with the\nrepresentation of others\" (p. 180). This comparison process takes place whenever people\nare in groups. Barkow invoked Chance's concept of attention structure (Chance, 1967) to\nindicate that most comparison encounters need not be physically agonistic, which would\nindicate a RHP strategy, but may simply consist of who attends to whom, which indicates a\nSAHP strategy. However, the notion of attention structure being the primary dimension of\nprimate dominance-popularity hierarchies has been criticized by Hinde (1974; see also\nSchubert, 1983). Hinde agreed that dominant males in primate groups are attention-catchers\nthrough displays of dominant behavior. But, he argues, these displays invariably show off\nphysical prowess and frighten others. Also, subordinates tend to monitor or pay attention to\ndangerous dominant troop members. Thus, attention seems to be a byproduct of dominance\ndisplays--at least among simians--and male dominant primates attract attention through\ndominance displays that are in turn evidence to rivals and potential mates of a high RHP.\nTo rivals, the displays convey the message to back down, while to potential mates, they are\na sign of good genes.\nHow do our findings contribute to the understanding of dominance-popularity\nbehaviors among (adolescent) humans? Human ontogeny is marked by dominant bullying\nbehavior and resource control: toddlers vie for the most interesting toys; adolescents (and\nadults) vie for the most interesting partners. Also, being successful in gaining control over\nresources early in life may actually have lasting consequences later in ontogeny (e.g.,\nWeisfeld, 1987). Gaining resources through dominant behaviors such as bullying is thus\nreinforced through rewards (resource acquisition) and perhaps this learning mechanism\nmay help explain the tenacity and ubiquity of bullying. It may not be a coincidence that\nbullying increases at this age (Bj\u00f6rkvist et al., 1992; Cairns and Cairns, 1986). Adolescence\nis, after all, a developmental period marked by the crossing of gender boundaries in search\nfor sexual opportunities. Intra-sex competition for these opportunities is high and recent\nretrospective research confirms that bullying and victimization may be linked to\nreproductive behavior (Gallup, O'Brien, White, and Sloan Wilson, 2009; White, Gallup,\nand Gallup, 2010). Thus, the struggle for sexual opportunities may be a factor in the\nprevalence of bullying and victimization in secondary schools.\nIn addition to bullying, anti-authority displays (e.g., receiving low grades and being\ndisrespectful to teachers) are very typical for dominant-popular boys as well as girls (e.g.,\n2006b; Rodkin, Farmer, Pearl, and Van Acker, 2000). Perhaps these anti-authority displays\nare part and parcel of the dominant-popular behavioral profile. They may benefit the\ndisplayer in several ways: by impressing classmates (\"oh, look how cool I am to defy this\nteacher!\") or by acting the class-clown they show defiance and humor (in particular\nreducing the low dominant classmates to a laughing stock). Also, by defying and\nchallenging authority they show their strength, fortitude, courage, leadership, and raw\npower, all of which probably serve a two-pronged goal: impress the opposite sex and scare\noff rivals. Could these behaviors capture the essence of a newly discussed construct called\nHierarchies and sexual activity\nMating Intelligence (Geher and Miller, 2008)? Future research should concentrate on\ndelineating the behavioral factors underlying successful (and unsuccessful) adolescent\nsexual mating mechanisms.\nThere were some limitations to this study. The first is the `implicit' fact-finding\nnature of cluster analysis. This method relies solely on statistical criteria to find subgroups.\nOther methods to identify subgroups should also be used in future studies, such as\nethnography, interviews, or observations. Second, an important question regarding the\npositive association between dominance-popularity and sexual activity centers on\ndirectionality. Sexual selection theory suggests that status precedes and predicts sexual\nactivity. The present study, however, is correlational and statements about causality should\nbe avoided. Thus, the statement being dominant-popular in a group and behaving\naggressively leads to sex is just as probable as sex leads to being considered dominant-\npopular and behaving aggressively. However, this line of reasoning becomes harder to\nmaintain when we consider the strong association between dominance, behavior, and\nsexual activity. Remember, it was the dominant-aggressive boys and girls who were\nsexually most active, and the proposition that sexual activity should lead to dominant-\naggressive behavior is harder to maintain than the reverse, i.e., dominant-aggressive\nbehavior leads to increased sexual activity. Why would an individual who gained access to\na sexual mate become more aggressive? That makes much less sense than an aggressive\nindividual securing sole access to a willing mate. Longitudinal studies will help to address\nthese questions of directionality and causality. Also, an alternative explanation is plausible,\nsuch that both sexual activity and dominance behavior are somehow `driven' by a third\nvariable, perhaps a personality type akin to a Machiavellian profile: cunning, smart, savvy,\nand high in opportunistic aggression (Byrne and Whiten, 1988; Whiten and Byrne, 1997).\nIf so, then the behavioral profiles of attractive-dominant girls and aggressive-dominant\nboys uncovered in the current study seem to fit the bill to a certain degree. Further studies\nshould investigate this hypothesis. Also, the findings of the current research apply to\nadolescents in a modern Western society, in this case The Netherlands. One must always be\nvery cautious in extending findings from one culture to the human species as a whole.\nFuture studies should look into cultures that are vastly different in, for instance, school\norganization and sexual permissiveness.\nIn spite of these limitations, this study provides an important step towards\nunderstanding the association between middle adolescent peer status, interpersonal\nbehavior, and sexual activity. This study showed that middle adolescents' sexual behavior\nis related to dominant-popularity status, in combination with certain idiosyncratic behaviors\nof boys and girls that enhance their competitiveness within their own gender, in particular,\naggression and appearance. This study also shows that sexual strategies theory and the\nevolutionary perspective provide a framework to understand these associations.\n"
