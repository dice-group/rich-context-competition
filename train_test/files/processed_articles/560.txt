A\ncontract can be enforced by the formal legal court or by informal community courts, for\ninstance panchayats in South Asia. In less developed societies both types of institutions\nco-exist, often coming in each others way. These conflicts are well documented in the\ncontext of the marriage market and common property management (Chowdhry 2004;\nnot been any study that analyzes and estimates the effect of such interactions on economic\ndecision making. In this paper we look at the effect of the interaction between the infor-\nmal loan network and formal court system on the decision to run a business using both\nanalytical and quantitative methods. We find that the informal network helps in busi-\nness proliferation when the formal court system is weak. However, when the formal court\nsystem improves sufficiently, business might fall in areas with strong informal networks.\nOur paper is related to a vast body of literature that studies the effect of institutions\non economic development. There is a consensus among economists that better institu-\ntions encourage capital accumulation and subsequent growth (Acemoglu et al. 2001, 2002;\nRajan and Zingales 1998).

One exception is Acemoglu and Johnson (2003), who distinguish\nbetween the effects of property rights institutions and contracting institutions on growth.\nUsing a cross country data set, they find that while good property rights institutions have\na positive effect on growth, the effect of contracting institutions is not robust. This result\nis counter intuitive, and one possible reason could be that their data, which only measures\nthe quality of formal contracting institutions, fails to account for the role of informal net-\nwork based institutions, ubiquitous in many developing countries. Evidence shows that\nin the absence of effective formal courts of law, business often thrives under the infor-\nmal institutions (Biggs and Shah 2006; McMillan and Woodruff 1999). In a related paper,\nHarriss-White (2010) finds that in absence of effective formal institutions, Indian SMEs\nare largely regulated by what she calls \"social regulation.\" This is nothing but informal\ninstitutions working through community networks and reputation mechanisms. The caste\nsystem prevailing in India can also be seen as a grand framework of contract enforcement\nusing the reputation mechanism (Freitas 2006). The key to the success of such reputation\nbased mechanisms is information about one's past action (therefore reputation) flowing\nin the community network (Ghosh and Ray 1996; Rosenthal and Landau 1979; Kandori\n1992). Many credit institutions in less developed countries, such as ROSCA in East Asia\n(Besley et al. 1993) and Grameen Bank in Bangladesh (Ghatak 1991), crucially depend on\nsuch information flow within communities. The use of community level information for\nenforcing contracts was also ubiquitous in medieval Europe (Greif et al. 1994; Greif 1993;\nBesides the general literature on institutions and its impact on economic growth, this\npaper is also related to the role of networks in credit provisioning. Network membership,\nwhich is often characterized by caste or ethnicity, may work both in positive and negative\nways. A number of studies found in the African context that community membership can\nincrease the probabilityof getting a loan if one's own community controls the supply of loans\nOn the other hand, it may decrease the probability of getting loans if the credit granting\nauthority has any negative bias towards the credit applicants ethnicity. This result has\nbeen confirmed by various studies in the context of the United States (Blanchflower et al.\nHowever, most of the literature on institutions look at formal and informal institutions\nas separate phases of development \u00ad the informal system getting replaced by the formal\nones in due course of development (La Porta and Shleifer 2014). At best, some authors\nhave adopted a dual sector approach \u00ad making formal and informal two parallel sets of\nrules without interfering with one another (Straub 2005). But in reality, formal and infor-\nmal institutions interact and mutually constitute each other. Evidence suggests that social\ncapital affects formal economic behavior like financial decisions. Luigi et al. (2004) find\nthat in Italy people are more likely to use formal checks, invest less in cash and more in\nstocks, have higher access to institutional credit and make less use of informal credit in\nareas of high social capital. The effect of social capital is stronger in areas with weaker legal\nenforcements. In a similar line of research, Karlan (2005) uses an experimental approach\nto find the effect of social capital on financial decisions. The interaction between formal\ninstitutions and informal norms also plays a role in the management of common prop-\nerty resources. For example, Sandner (2003) looked at the interaction between formal\ninstitutions and norms of the Kuna community in Central America for preservation of\nmarine resources. He shows that erosion of norms and insufficient development of formal\ninstitutions can lead to over exploitation of marine resources.\nThe interaction between formal and informal institutions is particularly important in\nless developed countries. In these countries de facto practices are quite different from de\njure rules \u00ad and these differences are often shaped by the interaction between formal and\ninformal institutions. The only theoretical exposition of such interactions that we have\ncome across is Dixit (2004) where he argues that the development of the formal may have\na detrimental effect on the informal mechanisms. The informal system relies heavily on\nthe reputation mechanism, where someone with a reputation of cheating does not get a\njob within his/her community. People using formal contracts however do not care about\nreputation \u00ad punishment under formal contracting is direct and enforced by a third party\n(fine, imprisonment). Hence one can always cheat someone using the informal contract\nand then find their next employment with another employer using a formal contract.\nOn the empirical front there has been much less research on this issue. One of the\nfew papers related to relevance of institutions in affecting business decisions is Chemin\n(2012). He finds that reforms in the civil court procedureleads to lower breaches of contract,\nhigher access to capital and building of new capacity in India. However, what Chemin\nfinds is an average effect of more efficient courts. His research does not answer whether\nthe effect is different for areas with different initial conditions in terms of informal insti-\ntutions (such as the presence of caste panchayat). We claim that the effect of better\nlegislation on business decisions will critically depend on these initial conditions. Another\nclosely related paper is Klapper et al. (2006). Their study, based on 34 Eastern and Western\nEuropean countries, find that higher requirements to comply with formal bureaucratic\nregulation prevents new businesses from entering the industry by increasing entry cost.\nThe main contention of our paper is that formal and informal institutions might come\nin the way of each other, producing undesired results in places where traditional, com-\nmunity based dispute resolving systems are widespread. We define a business in terms\nof a contract where a contractor agrees to supply certain inputs to an entrepreneur. The\nquality of the input cannot be verified beforehand or by any third party, creating a pos-\nsible moral hazard problem. The only way to punish a cheater contractor is to fire him\nand deny him any future employment opportunity. Hence, we have a structure similar to\nShapiro and Stiglitz (1984) and Greif (1993), where the only way to prevent cheating is to\npay the cheater contractor an honesty-inducing price for his input so that he finds that\ncheating pays off is less than the honesty pay-off.\nThe entrepreneurs can come from a traditional producer community or someone com-\ning from outside the community. The latter group can only enter the market if the formal\ncontracting institutions are of sufficiently good quality. For entrepreneurs belonging to\nthe traditional community, the community norm requires them to boycott a contractor\nwho cheated any community member. This makes the cost of cheating someone very high\nfor the contractor, depressing the honesty inducing price of his input supplies.\nWe argue that in the presence of an effective formal system, the capacity to pun-\nish declines in the informal system. This is precisely because a strong formal system\nallows entrepreneurs from outside the community to enter the market who do not abide\nby the community norm of not hiring a past cheater. This makes it easy for a cheater\ncontractor (who cheated a community member in the past) to find employment with\nan entrepreneur who does not belong to the community. This increases the honesty\ninducing price for the input, pushing the entrepreneurs with small capital stock out of\nthe market.\nOur theoretical model suggests that in areas with strong networks, an honesty inducing\ninput price is low, accommodating small entrepreneurs in the system. But as formal systems\nimprove (and consequently the input price rises), these areas are the worst hit as facing\nthe rising input prices, the entrepreneurs are forced to quit the market.\nWe use the India Human Development Survey (IHDS) 2004-2005 to test our theoretical\npredictions. In accordance with the theoretical predictions, our empirical evidence sug-\ngests that business is affected by the interplay of formal institutions and informal norms.\nSpecifically, when formal institutions are strong enough, we find that the probability of\ndoing businessis lower in the presenceof a large informal network. Given the cross-sectional\nnature of the data, we should be careful in interpreting our results as causal.\nHowever, this inference does not suggest the preservation of the informal institutions\nby limiting the power of the formal courts. It rather emphasizes the possibility of jeopar-\ndizing the expansion of business by imposing a rapid expansion of the formal contracting\nsystem. There is no point in denying that improvement in formal contracting enhances\nefficiency and social mobility by allowing contractors without any family/community con-\nnection to enter the market. However, the preexistence of a strong informal institutional\nframework, captured by large community networks, makes the rapid institutional switch\nsocially costly as it may exclude people from participating in the market. Most impor-\ntantly, the exclusion comes from the high cost of accessing the formal institutions. Given\nthe efficiency property of formal institutions, the most logical implication of our research\nis to reduce the cost of formal contracting.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the analytical model,\nSection 3 outlines the empirical framework, Section 4 summarizes the data used to\ntest the implications of our model, Section 5 reports the empirical findings and, finally,\nSection 6 concludes.\n2.1 Agents: contractors and entrepreneurs\nThere is a pool of potential entrepreneurs who produce a good G. For producing the\ngood G, they need an input X, which is supplied by a set of contractors who come from a\ntraditional X producing community C. The entrepreneurs however may come from both\nthe traditional community (C) and outside community (NC). The production of the input\nrequires high skill, but only a fraction of the community C has the skill \u00ad we call them\nHigh type contractors. The rest of the contractors, who we call Low type, do not have the\nnecessary skill to supply the input. Therefore, if a low type is chosen, the entrepreneur\nmakes zero profit. Whether a contractor is High type is common knowledge within the\nC community but not outside. So when a contractor from C community asks for work, a\ntypical NC entrepreneur cannot tell whether the contractor has the appropriate skill. This\nhowever is common knowledge for a C entrepreneur For an NC entrepreneur, the first\nproblem is that of adverse selection \u00ad to be able to distinguish between the High and the\nLow type.\nHowever, there is a second level problem as well \u00ad the problem of moral hazard. Even\nafter a High type contractor is selected, he may supply bad quality input as it saves effort\nfor the contractor. Note that using a bad quality input for producing G is better than\nhiring a Low type contractor. A Low type contractor is a fraud who does not have the\nskill to produce the input even of bad quality. Hence, from an entrepreneur's perspective,\na High type supplying bad quality input yields a better outcome than hiring a Low type\ncontractor who cannot supply any input. We write the condition as follows:\nwhere  is the reservation income of the entrepreneur. j is his income by hiring the\nhigh type contractor, where the contractor supplies quality j input (j = B, G). If the\nentrepreneur hires the Low type contractor, he gets 0 profit, which is less than his reser-\nvation pay-off. Hence, while choosing a contractor faces two types of problems, the first\none is a typical problem of adverse selection, and the second one is of moral hazard.\nBefore proceeding further let us discuss why both the moral hazard and adverse\nselection problems are necessary for the formulation of our model.\nThe moral hazard and the adverse selection problems bring out the role that two types\nof institutions \u00ad formal and informal \u00ad play. Let us first take the case of the moral haz-\nard problem where a contractor can shirk. The only punishment for cheating is not\nhiring a cheater again. For entrepreneurs belonging to the entrepreneurial caste, if one\nentrepreneur is cheated, all entrepreneurs belonging to the caste boycott the cheater con-\ntractor. This makes the punishment cost of cheating a caste entrepreneur more than\ncheating a non-caste member. The informal institutions in this case take the form of\ninformation flow within the community. This information advantage allows the caste\nentrepreneurs to impose the punishment on a cheating contractor. This is not possible\nin the case of non-caste entrepreneurs due to the lack of credible information. Instead,\nthe non-caste members who cannot go to informal institutions solve the moral haz-\nard problem simply by paying a higher honesty-inducing wage than their caste member\ncounterpart. Note that this analysis does not require modeling of formal institutions.\nThe adverse selection problem, on the other hand, arises in the model because, ex-ante,\nit is not possible to distinguish between the Low and the High type. Here comes the role of\nformal institutions. The formal institutions of contract enforcement are essentially third\nparty enforcement (court, police etc). They solve this problem by punishing a Low type\ncontractor who poses as the High type contractor. The higher is the quality of the formal\ninstitutions, the higher is the probability of catching and punishing a Low type mimicking\na High type. Therefore, the quality of formal institutions enters our analysis through the\nchannel of the adverse selection problem, making the adverse selection problem crucial\nto our theory. Both the moral hazard and adverse selection problems are important in our\nanalysis because they are solved by the informal and formal institutions respectively.\nThe entrepreneurs can be characterized in two dimensions: community identity and\nendowment. An entrepreneur i is endowed with business skill, or capital, i, and the\nendowment is distributed according to the distribution . An entrepreneur i's output yi\nis positively related to his endowment. There is another dimension of any entrepreneur\n\u00ad either he belongs to a traditional business community (C) or does not belong to\nthat community (NC). However, the distributions for  are the same for C and NC\ntype entrepreneurs. The main difference between C and NC types is in terms of\naccessing informal institutions. Only C type entrepreneurs can access the informal net-\nwork for adjudicating any dispute with the contractors. However, both C and NC type\nentrepreneurs can access the formal court. Note that the quality of an input (good or bad)\ncannot be verified by the court. Hence, the court is only useful if a Low type contractor\nmisrepresented himself as a High type and took money for supplying the input.\nThe entrepreneur faces two levels of problems. Finding a High type is the first level of\nthe problem. In the second level, the entrepreneur has to ensure that the High type is not\nbehaving opportunistically \u00ad i.e., not supplying bad input after being hired.\nLet us now elaborate the role of institutions in solving the problems faced by the\nentrepreneurs. There are two types of contracting institutions available in the economy.\nOne is formal courts characterized by third party enforcement and the second is informal\nnetworks characterized by reputation based mechanisms. In what follows, we discuss the\ndifferent roles played by the formal versus informal institutions in solving the problem of\nasymmetric information faced by the entrepreneurs.\n2.3 Adverse selection problem: the role of court\nWe have already mentioned that there are two types of problems that an entrepreneur\nfaces: Low type posing as High type, and after recruitment, high type supplying bad quality\ninput. From the entrepreneur's point of view, a low type contractor (who can only supply\nzero input) is worse than hiring a high type who supplies bad quality. There are two ways\nof catching and punishing a Low type.\nThe informal network of C members possesses the information regarding its member's\nskillfulness, i.e., everybody in the community knows which member in the community\ndoes not have the necessary training to produce X. Hence, no Low type contractor is\nhired by a C type entrepreneur. In other words, belonging to the community network\nsolves the problem of adverse selection for a C entrepreneur. But NC entrepreneurs can-\nnot access this information about the true type of the contractor, ex-ante. Instead, the NC\nentrepreneurs can sign a formal contract with a potential contractor, and if he turns out to\nbe the Low type, they can file a lawsuit against the Low type posing as High and get the Low\ntype punished with probability , where,  is the quality of the formal court. Hence, with\na sufficiently strong formal court, Low type community members will not pose as a High\ntype member. In general, mimicking the High type is not worthwhile for the Low type if\nwhere P is the price that the low type gets by posing as the High type, and M is the penalty\nhe pays if he gets caught. The reservation pay-off of the Low type is 0. The condition tells\nus that there will be no Low type posing as High type if\n >\nP\nM\nFor  < the quality of formal institutions is so bad that Low types can mimic High types\nand get away with it. This makes the NC type entrepreneurs find that it is not worthwhile\nto join the market. For low enough sigma, all Low types mimic as high types, and given\nthat C type entrepreneurs already know who is Low type, there is a very high probability\nthat NC type entrepreneurs are matched with Low type. This leads to our first theorem:\nTheorem 2.1. For a sufficiently high quality of formal institutions (), Low types do\nnot find it worthwhile to mimic the High type, and as a result, NC entrepreneurs enter the\nmarket.\n2.4 The moral hazard problem\nUnlike adverse selection, the moral hazard problem however cannot be solved by any\nthird party as the quality of the input is not verifiable by the third party. Only the\nentrepreneur can find out the quality of the input, and the punishment she can inflict\nis not hiring a cheater contractor for subsequent periods. The monetary value of the\npunishment can be measured by a wage that a contractor loses if he is fired. We follow\nthe efficiency wage theory framework proposed by Shapiro and Stiglitz (1984) and Greif\n(1993) for analyzing the solution to the moral hazard problem.\nWe start with the case where ( < ), and only C type entrepreneurs operate. C\nentrepreneurs solve the adverse selection problem of selecting the High type through the\ninformation network. Hence, they face the moral hazard problem only \u00ad the problem\nof ensuring that High type supplies good quality input. The entrepreneur can solve the\nproblem by offering a payment to the contractor so that the cheating pay-off is less than\nthe honesty pay-off. This section is modeled after Greif (1993).\nThe contractor supplies one unit of the input to the entrepreneur and gets a payment\n. If he supplies bad quality input, he saves some cost  but at the end of the period gets\nfired. However, there is an exogenous probability of terminating the contract given by q.\nIn that case, if the contractor is honest, he is hired again. For characterizing the honesty\ninducing equilibrium, we define the following expressions:\nThe pay-off for an honest agent is given by\nVh\n=  + (1 - q)Vh\n+ qVu\nh\nThis shows that the lifetime payoff of an honest contractor can be divided in to current\nand future pay-offs. In the current period an honest agent gets factor payment . In the\nnext period, however, she might get fired for an exogenous reason with probability q and\ncontinue to get Vu\nh\n\u00ad the lifetime pay off of an honest unemployed agent. On the other\nhand, the agent may stay in the job with probability 1 - q and continue to earn an honest\nemployed agent's pay-off \u00ad Vh. The future pay offs are discounted by the discount rate .\nBy cheating, an agent gets a one time pay-off  in the current period. However, this one\ntime payment comes at the cost of losing his job at the end of the current period. From\nthe next period onwards he gets the pay-off of an unemployed cheater. An unemployed\ncheater can be rehired with probability pc in the next period and get Vh. With probability\n) a cheater is not re-hired, and he gets reservation wage (). The pay-off for an\nunemployed cheater, Vu\nc\n, is summarized by the following equation:\nVu\nc\n= pcVh\n+  (1 - pc)  + Vu\nc\nAn honest agent can also lose her job for exogenous reasons. However, she may be rehired\nwith probability ph in the next period and get Vh. On the other hand, with probability\n) she may remain unemployed and get  + Vu\nh\n\u00ad reservation pay-off plus life\ntime utility of an honest unemployed agent.\nVu\nh\n= phVh\n+  (1 - ph\n)  + Vu\nh\nThe payment to a contractor () that prevents her from cheating must satisfy the\ncondition\nVh\n  + Vu\nc\nIt is easy to understand that no entrepreneur has any incentive to pay a  more than the\nminimum honesty-inducing payment.\nTheorem 2.2. A contractor's honesty inducing payment is rising in the probability of\nrehiring a cheater agent.\nWe provide the formal proof in the appendix. But the intuition of this theorem is quite\nstraight forward. The only punishment an entrepreneur can inflict is firing the agent,\nwhich involves the monetary cost of the forgone payment. If the cheater agents can eas-\nily be rehired, the cost of losing the current job is low. In that case the input price (that\nhe misses because of getting fired) needs to be big enough to prevent one from cheating.\nSo we have  = (pc\n),  > 0. We assume that community members will not appoint a\ncontractor who has cheated another community member, i.e., in the environment where\nall the entrepreneurs are type C, we get pc\n= 0. This is possible due to the flow of infor-\nmation within the community of a C type entrepreneur. However, an NC type contractor\ncannot access any such information. Hence, she cannot distinguish between an agent who\ncheated in the past and the one who did not. For her pc\n= ph\n> 0, this leads to the next\ncorollary:\nCorollary 2.3. The honesty inducing payment for the contractors hired by NC\nentrepreneurs is higher than that for the ones hired by the C entrepreneurs.\n2.5 The interaction effect\nFirst we analyze how the improvements in the formal court system affects the C type\nentrepreneurs. The improvements in the formal court system do not directly affect C\ntype entrepreneurs. It affects the C type by facilitating the entry of the NC type. NC type\nentrepreneurs can only enter the market if the formal institutions are good enough to\nsolve the adverse selection problem. Hence, a good court allows the NC entrepreneurs\nto enter the market. Once in the market, the NC entrepreneurs solve the moral hazard\nproblem the same way the C entrepreneurs solve the problem, i.e., paying the honesty-\ninducing price. But the entry of NC entrepreneurs will have an indirect impact on the C\nentrepreneurs as the equilibrium price for the input will go up, reducing the profit margin\nof the existing C entrepreneurs. This determines the number of C entrepreneurs. Who\nare the C entrepreneurs running businesses? The entrepreneurs with endowment i will\nbe in business such that\ni\n(i\nwhere  is the equilibrium price for the input. Solving (8) for equality, we get the lowest\nendowment entrepreneur that can be in the business  = (), where  is rising in .\nFrom this we get our next proposition\nTheorem 2.4. The cut-off endowment level of the entrepreneurs is a function of the input\nprice, and the cut-off goes up as the input price goes up\nIf the equilibrium input price () goes up, only the entrepreneurs with sufficiently high\nendowment can stay in the market. As the input price goes up following the entry of\nthe NC type entrepreneurs, the cut-off endowment level goes up. Let us now look at\nthe volume of business following the entry of the NC entrepreneurs. Entry of the NC\nentrepreneurs increases the number of NC business, but it decreases the number of the C\nentrepreneurs as the cut-off endowment level gets revised upwards. Hence, theoretically,\nthe net effect is ambiguous, making the empirical investigation important.\nSuppose the number of possible community entrepreneurs is Mc. In period 0 we do\nnot have any NC entrepreneur in the market. So the number of businesses is equal to\nthe probability that a potential C entrepreneur will start a business times MC. Suppose\nin period 0 the cut off endowment level was 0. Hence the total number of businesses is\ngiven by\n= MC\nIn period 1, NC entrepreneurs enter, and as a result, input price goes up, moving the cut-\noff endowment level to 1\n> 0 for both C and NC entrepreneurs as they both face the\nsame input price. Hence, while new entrants (NC entrepreneurs) add to the volume of\nbusiness, the quitting community entrepreneurs reduce it, making the net effect ambigu-\nous. Assume that the pool of potential NC entrepreneurs is MN . The volume of NC\nbusinesses is given by\nBN\n= MN\nThe number of community businesses in period 1 is given by\nBC\n= MC\nHence, total business in period 1 is given by\n= MN\nThe change in business is given by\nFrom this we get B0 B1 according to\nMN\nMC\nTheoretically we do not have any clear cut answer as to whether entry of NC\nentrepreneurs will lead to an increase or decrease in the number of businesses. This\ndepends on the relative size of the pool of C and NC entrepreneurs and the shape of\nthe endowment distribution. The larger is the value of MC compared to MN , the more\nlikely it is that with the improvement in the formal institutions (and consequently entry\nof the NC entrepreneurs), total number of businesses will fall. This will happen when the\nnew entry will not be sufficient to cover for the exit of the community entrepreneurs.\nIn other words, the entrants come from the upper tail of the endowment distribution,\nwhile the quitters come from the lower tail. Hence, total business will shrink if the lower\ntail is denser than the upper tail. This should be the case for a less developed country\ncharacterized by inequality, where the number of people belonging to the upper wealth\npercentile is less than that in the lower percentile.\nNext we review the interaction effect between the formal and the informal institutions\nand its effect on the volume of business. In the previous sections we have assumed that\nthere is one homogeneous community network where the probability of rehiring a cheater\nis zero. We now extend this set up by introducing heterogeneity in terms of commu-\nnity network. We assume that there are n districts, and each district j is characterized by\nnetwork size j. We further assume that the probability of rehiring a cheater is a falling\nfunction of the network size\npj\nc\n= g(j\nwhere g < 0. This assumption implies that in a district characterized by big network, a\nlarge number of people know about one's cheating history, and the cheater finds it difficult\nto get a job. Let us now elaborate how the improvements in the formal court system affects\ndistricts with different degrees of networks differently.\nIn other words, we examine the role of interaction between the existing informal net-\nwork mechanism and the formal institutions in determining the volume of business. In\nperiod 0, the larger the network, lower is the probability for a cheater contractor to be\nrehired, and lower is the input price. Hence, in a district characterized by a larger net-\nwork, the cutoff endowment level for the C entrepreneurs is lower than that in a district\nwith a smaller network. This means\nwhere  represents the size of the network and  () < 0. This means that the value of\n0 is low in high network districts. Given that 1 is determined by the cut-off level of the\nNC entrepreneurs, which has nothing to do with the existing network size, the expression\n)) is rising in the network size. Since the size of the quitting businesses is\nrising in ( (1\n), we get the following theorem\nTheorem 2.5. If formal institutions improve, sufficiently allowing the NC entrepreneurs\nto set up business, the reduction in the community businesses will be higher in high network\ndistricts than that in the low network districts. If the negative impact of the quitting C\nentrepreneurs is strong enough, this will lead to greater reduction in the total volume of\nbusiness in the districts with higher networks.\nWe next turn to the empirical section to test the implications of our model using data\nfrom India.\n3 Empirical specification\nEmpirically, a way to test the theoretical predictions would be to estimate a regression\nof the probability of doing business on the the interaction between formal and infor-\nmal institutions using panel data. A panel setting would enable us to estimate the effect\nof introducing formal institutions in an economy with pre-existing informal institutions.\nHowever, in the absence of any longitudinal information, we only provide suggestive\nevidence on our theoretical predictions. Specifically, we compare districts with varying\ndegrees of informal and formal institutions using cross sectional data. In particular, we\nestimate the following specification:\nP(SE)id\n FCd\n+ Xid\nwhere P(SE)id reflects the probability with which a household i in district d chooses to\nbe self-employed over being wage employed. INd is a proxy for the quality of informal\ninstitutions in district d. FCd is a proxy for the quality of formal institutions in district d.\nThe interaction between INd and FCd is our main variable of interest. According to the-\noretical predictions of our model, a positive 2 would imply that a higher proportion of\nhouseholds choose to do business when the informal network is large, which thereby helps to\nfacilitate information flow within the network. Additionally, 1 captures the impact of for-\nmal institutions on the relationship between informal institutions and self-employment.\nSpecifically, a negative 1 would imply that when the quality of formal institutions increasess\nbusinesses would exit from areas with a greater prevalence of informal institutions. Similarly,\n3 captures the independent effect of the quality of formal institutions on probability of self\nemployment. A positive 3 implies that as the quality of formal institution improves,\nbusinesses would flourish as it enables some new entrepreneurs to enter the market.\nNote however that informal and formal institutions might evolve endogenously at the\ndistrict level. One way to deal with this could be to use historical data to capture the intro-\nduction of the formal court system.1 However, we cannot adopt this approach due to the\npaucity of such data. Instead, we try to control for a range of household and district level\ncontrols captured in Xid. Specifically, we include religion, caste, education, amount of loan\ntaken, any caste-group membership at the household level and availability of formal loans\nat the district level.\nWe use data from the India Human Development Survey (IHDS) for this study. The IHDS\nOur study covers households which are either self-employed, wage employed or unem-\nployed. This leads to a sample size of 34,521 households across 373 districts in our study.\nFor our dependent variable we use the information on employment status of different\nmembers of a household to create a household level variable of self-employment status.\nWe define a household to be self employed if at least one member in the household owns a\nbusiness in the non-agricultural sector. A household is defined to be wage-employed if at\nleast one member is wage-employed, and no one is self-employed. A household is defined\nto be unemployed if no one in the household is employed.2\nOur main variables of interest are informal and formal institutional quality. In\nequation 17, we proxy informal institutions, INd, by the fraction of households in a dis-\ntrict d that takes loans from informal sources, viz., friends, relatives and community\ncredit groups.3 In general, an informal loan network not only captures the extent of loans\navailable in a district, but it also reflects the close association between members of the\nnetwork. A larger size of the informal network facilitates flow of information within the\nnetwork and helps in enforcing the reputation mechanism.\nThe quality of formal institutions is captured by the perceived quality of formal courts\nof law. We measure FCd as the fraction of households in a district d which perceives the\njudiciary to be strong.4 Specifically, the survey asks households to rank different institu-\ntions on a scale of one to three, where three signifies the least confidence in a particular\ninstitution, and one signifies the highest confidence. We consider the perceived court\nquality to be strong when a household's ranking of court efficiency is one.\nTable 1 provides the summary of our estimation sample. About 23% of our full sample\nis self employed. However, when we disaggregate by sector, we find a much higher preva-\nlence of self employment in the urban sector \u00ad about 29% of the sample is self-employed\nin urban as opposed to 19% in the rural sector. This has implications for the importance\nof the relationship between self-employment and institutional quality, which we revisit in\nSection 5.1. When we look at the prevalence of informal networks, we find that about 12%\nof the full sample has borrowed from informal sources. Moreover, the extent of informal-\nity is not very different between urban and rural sectors. With respect to the quality of\nformal courts, 53% of our full sample perceive the court to be efficient. Once again, the\ndifference in perception is small between urban and rural sectors. The availability of for-\nmal loans is higher in rural areas, possibly reflecting the higher prevalence of government\nrural banks providing agricultural loans. However, as expected, the average size of loans\nis much higher in urban regions. Table 1 additionally reports the means for the other\ncontrol variables that we use in our empirical specification.\nTable 1 Summary\nAll Rural Urban\nTable 2 reports the results from a linear estimation of equation 1. The outcome vari-\nable reflects the probability of a household being self-employed compared to being wage\nemployed. Column 1 includes a measure of informality at the district level (IId), an indi-\ncator for strong institutions(SId), and an interaction between the two. Since our variables\nof interest vary only at the district level, we report clustered standard errors at the district\nlevel in all specifications.\nThe results in column 1 indicate a nonlinear relationship between the degree of infor-\nmality and self employment. The coefficient on informal networks by itself suggests that a\ngreater extent of informality in a district predicts a higher probability of self-employment.\nHowever, this relationship depends on the strength of formal institutions. Specifically, the\nnegative coefficient on the interaction term implies a nonlinear relationship. This can be\nseen from the following equation.\nPr(SE)\nOur result implies Pr(SE)\n0, according to SId SId\n. This means that greater\ninformal networks positively affect the probability of starting a business as long as the\nquality of the formal court is below a certain threshold. However as the formal institutions\nbecome sufficiently strong, a higher number of business would quit in areas with larger\ninformal networks.\nTable 2 Probability of self employment vs wage employment\nNotes: Linear probability models. Standard errors in parentheses, adjusted for clustering at village level.\n*** significant at 1%; ** significant at 5%; * significant at 10%.\nMore specifically the coefficients can be interpreted in the following way. In column 1,\nthe estimates imply that the threshold level of formal institutions is given by 0.54 (2\n).\nHence, districts where more than 54% of the households perceive the judiciary to be\nstrong are above the threshold level of formal institutions. Now consider two districts\nwithin this group \u00ad one with a low prevalence of informal networks (DLI\n) and another\nwith a high prevalence of informal networks (DHI\n). Then our coefficients imply that the\nprobability of self employment is lower in DHI compared to DLI.5 Specifically, if 60% of\nhouseholds perceive the court to be efficient, then a one unit difference in the extent of\ninformal networks between DHI and DLI leads to a 10 percentage point lower probability\nof self employment in DHI compared to DLI districts.\nConversely, now consider the situation where the level of formal institutions is less than\nthe threshold level of 0.5. Consider the same two districts, DHI and DLI. Here our coeffi-\ncients imply that the the probability of self employment is higher in DHI compared to DLI.\nSpecifically, if only 40% of the households in a district perceive the court to be strong, a\none unit higher level of informal networks leads to a 10 percentage point higher likelihood\nof doing business.\nNext we add a number of control variables to the above basic specification. It is possible\nthat districts with greater availability of informal loans also have a higher availability of\nany loan so that `IN' simply captures the extent of the total loan availability in the district\ninstead of the extent of informality. Hence, we control for the availability of formal loans\nin the district in column 2. The coefficients indicate similar effects of informality.\nColumn 3 includes a proxy for the credit worthiness of a household indicated by the\nmaximum amount of loan taken. Results remain unchanged here as well. The coefficient\non the control variable suggests the obvious that if a household has taken a larger amount\nof loan, it is more likely to start a business.\nColumn 4 controls for other household level characteristics like religion, caste and an\nindicator whether a household has any literate member. The results are in the same spirit\nas before. The coefficients on High Caste and Education are as expected. More educated\nhouseholds and traditionally higher castes are more likely to be self employed. Hindu\nhouseholds, on the contrary, are less likely to self employed compared to households from\nother religious backgrounds.\nFinally, in column 5 we also control for household participation in a caste network since\nthat might increase both a household's probability of getting a loan and starting a business.\nResults remain the same as before. Moreover, as expected, household participation in a\ncaste network increases the probability of self-employment.\nTo further verify that our results are not sensitive to varied specifications, we carry out\nthe following robustness check. In Table 3 we include unemployment in the reference\ncategory. We now compare the probability of self employment with wage employment\nand unemployment. The results remain unaffected by the inclusion of unemployment in\nthe reference category. The coefficients on the interaction term and informal institutions\nshow similar nonlinear effects of informal networks on business decision, depending on\nthe extent of formal institutions.\n5.1 Heterogeneity analysis\nIn Table 1 we observe that the incidence of self-employment is much higher in urban\nareas compared to rural areas. Hence, in Table 4, we estimate the relationship separately\nTable 3 Probability of self employment vs wage employment & unemployment\nNotes: Linear probability models. Standard errors in parentheses, adjusted for clustering at village level.\n***significant at 1%; **significant at 5%; *significant at 10%.\nfor rural and urban regions.6 The results discussed in Table 2 are primarily driven by the\nurban region. Informality by itself or its interaction with formal institutions doesn't play\na significant role in predicting self employment for the rural region. It is possible that the\nlink between informality and self employment is more relevant for the urban region which\nis characterized by a higher prevalence of self-employment.\nIn general, it should be easier to start a new business in the presence of a large infor-\nmal network because it facilitates the flow of information and provides easy access to\nloans. However, according to our theoretical predictions, the presence of a large informal\nnetwork would also lead to a greater exodus of businesses when the quality of formal insti-\ntutions crosses a threshold. To re-examine these possibilities we conduct a heterogeneity\nanalysis by estimating our model separately for the extent of association of households\nin various caste organizations. In districts where a large fraction of households partici-\npate in caste networks, there would be a greater flow of information within the network.\nConsequently, it would be easier to enforce contracts using the informal system of the\nreputation mechanism and facilitate business opportunities. We define a district to have a\nstrong caste network if a larger share of households in a district participate in caste organi-\nzations.7 Table 5 reports the results from this analysis. A one percentage point increase in\nthe size of informal networks leads to a 0.52 percentage point higher probability of doing\nbusiness in districts with large caste networks. In comparison, a one percentage point\nincrease in the size of informal networks leads to a 0.32 percentage point higher probabil-\nity of doing business in districts with small caste networks. Additionally, the coefficient\nTable 4 Probability of self employment vs wage employment: Rural & Urban\nRural Urban\nNotes: Linear probability models. Standard errors in parentheses, adjusted for clustering at village level.\n***significant at 1%; **significant at 5%; *significant at 10%.\non the interaction term shows that the fall in business opportunities is higher in districts\nwith large caste networks when the quality of the formal court is above a threshold.\nFinally, we also investigate how a greater influx of NC entrepreneurs affects our base-\nline relationship. Specifically, we look at the extent of migration into and out of a\ndistrict as it determines the composition of the pool of entrepreneurs within a dis-\ntrict. A higher number of out-of-community entrepreneurs is likely to be present in\nhigh-migration compared to low-migration districts.8 Analogously, a higher number of\nlow-endowment community entrepreneurs will operate in low migration districts. In\nthis situation when the formal institutions become sufficiently strong, there would be a\ngreater exit of low-endowment entrepreneurs from the low-migration districts. In other\nwords, since high-migration districts would have a larger number of high-endowment\nout-of-community entrepreneurs to begin with, the interaction between informal net-\nwork and formal courts will have a much weaker effect than the low-migration districts,\nwhich are populated by low-endowment entrepreneurs. Therefore, we conduct a hetero-\ngeneity analysis separately for districts with high and low migration in the urban region\nas presented in Table 6. We define a district to have high migration if the fraction of\nmigrants in that district is greater than the median. In accordance with our theoretical\npredictions, the informal network and its interaction with the formal court matters for\nself-employment in districts with low-migration, possibly due to a greater prevalence of\ncommunity entrepreneurs. We do not find any significant relationship for the districts\nwith high-migration.\nTable 5 Heterogeneity analysis: network size\nLarge Network Small Network\nNotes: Linear probability models. Standard errors in parentheses, adjusted for clustering at village level.\n***significant at 1%; **significant at 5%; *significant at 10%.\n6 Conclusion\nThe relation between the informal and formal institutions of contract enforcement is\nusually seen as substitutional \u00ad the former being replaced by the latter in the course\nof economic development. The experiences of developing countries, however, show that\nthese two type of institutions co-exist. Understanding the nature of their interaction\ntherefore becomes crucial for designing optimal institutions. In this paper we model the\ninteraction between these two types of institutions and its effect on the prospect of running\na business. We test the implications of the model using household level data for India.\nThe informal institutions of contract enforcement, which works on a reputation based\nmechanism, are critical for the operations of micro-entrepreneurs who cannot access\ncostly formal institutions for enforcing the contracts. Unlike the formal institutions which\ndepend on the legal system for enforcing contracts, the informal institutions punish a\ncheater by denying him any future employment. However, such mechanisms are limited to\ncertain communities where members abide by the community norm of not employing one\nwho has cheated someone from that community. The system gets weaker if entrepreneurs\nstart violating this norm. The rise of formal institutions allows non-community members\nto enter the market who do not follow such norms. This, in our analysis, significantly\nweakens the effectiveness of the informal institutions.\nOur theoretical result shows that as long as the quality of formal institutions is below a\nthreshold level, strong informal networks help in business proliferation. However, when\nthe formal institutions get sufficiently strong, they come in the way of the informal ones\nTable 6 Heterogeneity analysis: migration\nHigh Migration Low Migration\nNotes: Linear probability models. Standard errors in parentheses, adjusted for clustering at village level.\n***significant at 1%; **significant at 5%; *significant at 10%.\n(following the mechanism we detailed above) and increase the cost of running businesses.\nThis affects the poorer entrepreneurs more adversely than their more well off coun-\nterparts because it is the small capitalists who find running business using the formal\nmechanism not profitable enough. We test our theoretical predictions using IHDS data\nand find support for our theoretical results. We plan to extend our analysis in the future\nby constructing a panel using administrative data on court quality. Additionally, future\nwaves of IHDS data would allow us to observe the evolution of informal institutions over\ntime. This will help us to provide more convincing evidence.\nThe main result of our paper apparently warns against the possible backlash of strength-\nening the formal institutions in a less developed country that is characterized by strong\ninformal institutions. Our position, however, does not endorse maintenance of informal\nmechanisms. Instead, we emphasize that informal institutions, even though inefficient,\nare crucial for the micro-entrepreneurs to run their businesses. The implications of our\npaper are two fold: first, strong formal and strong informal institutions create a negative\nimpact on the probability of doing business; more importantly, such negative impacts typ-\nically force the capital poor section of the entrepreneurs to quit the market. Hence, even if\nthe strengthening of formal institutions may lead to efficient outcomes in the long run, it\nincreases inequality in the short run. The main contribution of our paper is to emphasiz-\ning this trade off which is often neglected in the institutions-entrepreneurship literature.\nThe policy implication should lead to a better designing of formal institutions so that the\nexclusion of micro-entrepreneurs can be prevented.\nEndnotes\n1One such study is done by Kranton and Swamy (1999) who conduct a descriptive\nanalysis of the effect of court systems on agricultural credit markets using historical data\nfrom British India.\n2We also define a separate category as agricultural household if at least one member\nowns agricultural land or is employed in agriculture and no one is self-employed or\nwage-employed. However, we did not include this reference category in our analysis\nbecause they form a very small fraction of the total number of households.\n3All our district level estimates are computed as a fraction of the total number of\nhouseholds in a district.\n4Note that the formal court quality measure might suffer from measurement error\nproblems as it is based on household perception, implying that our estimates form a\nlower bound. We plan to collect administrative data related to court quality to construct\na more precise measure.\n6These results are robust to all the specifications reported in Table 2. However, we\nonly report the specification with full set of controls.\n7Moreover since the baseline relationship is driven primarily by the urban sector, we\nrestrict this analysis to the urban sector.\n8Out-of-community entrepreneurs represent the NC entrepreneurs in our theoretical\nmodel.\nAppendix\nVh 1 - (1 - q) =  + qVu\nh\nVu\nh\n= phVh\n) w + Vu\nh\nVu\nc\n= pcVh\n+  (1 - pc) w + Vu\nc\nVh\n  + Vu\nc\nDefine T = 1\n.
