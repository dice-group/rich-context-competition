    "abstract": "Abstract\nThere are more Chinese student-scholars than any other group of international students studying in the United States. Despite\nthis, there are relatively few studies that have focused on specific educational needs and required career support services\nfor Chinese international students. This exploratory study was conducted to determine the relationship between career\naspirations and emotional adjustment of Chinese international students. Results from Chinese students were compared with\nthose of students from the United States. Relationships between the career aspirations and emotional adjustment of Chinese\nand U.S. students did not reveal statistically significant differences. However, regression analysis indicated that social stress\nwas a statistically significant predictor of career aspirations for U.S. students. Chinese and U.S. students were more alike than\ndifferent on career aspirations and emotional adjustment, and observed educational similarities appeared to outweigh any\ncultural differences that existed when determining these outcomes.\n",

Within this\ngroup, China sends more students than any other country to\nstudy in English-speaking countries including the United\nStates, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada\nChinese international students in the United States coming\nfrom Mainland China and 13% from Taiwan (Institute of\nInternational Education [IIE], 2014). In addition, because\nstudents from Mainland China and Taiwan share many cul-\ntural similarities, including values and language, they are\noften grouped together for research purposes (Lin & Betz,\nAcademically, there are more Chinese student-scholars,\nincluding those from Mainland China and Taiwan, than any\nother group of international students studying in the United\nStates (IIE, 2014). However, despite large and growing num-\nbers of Chinese students studying in the United States, there\nare relatively few studies that have focused on their specific\neducational needs and required career support services. The\npurpose of this study was to begin an exploration of the rela-\ntionship between career goals and emotional adjustment in\nChinese international students.\nReview of Literature\nAcculturation and Other Challenges\nThere have been a number of studies examining the emo-\ntional and psychological experiences of Chinese interna-\ntional students. Many of these have focused on the idea of\nacculturation and surrounding mental health issues.\nAcculturation refers to the process of adopting the values and\nbehaviors of a new culture, often resulting in an internal bat-\ntle between the heritage of their country of origin and the pull\n1The University of Georgia, Athens, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nDeanna L.

Cozart1 and Jay W. Rojewski1\n Keywords\nChinese, emotional adjustment, career aspirations, higher education\n2 SAGE Open\nEach person must decide whether to accept or reject the host\ncommunity's cultural values and practices, while making\nthose same decisions about their home country's cultural val-\nues and practices (Yakushko, Backhaus, Watson, Ngaruiya,\nused models that highlights possible acculturation outcomes.\nThe model lists four possible outcomes: integration, assimi-\nlation, separation/segregation, and marginalization based on\nhow a person responds to two questions: \"Is it considered to\nbe of value to maintain one's identity and characteristics?\"\nand \"Is it considered to be of value to maintain relationship\nwith larger society?\" Separation/segregation refers to an\nindividual decision to withdraw from norms of larger soci-\nety; a cultural identity from the home country is retained, but\nwithin terms of a less value given to maintaining a relation-\nship to dominant society. For example, a Chinese immigrant\nwho moves into a Chinese neighborhood and continues only\nspeaking Chinese and interacting only with other Chinese in\nthe immediate vicinity could be viewed as experiencing sep-\naration/segregation. Marginalization is fixed upon individual\nconfusion and anxiety about personal cultural identity and\nrelationships to larger society. This is the most negative out-\ncome possible, where there is no retention of cultural identity\nand there is no positive relationship with dominant society.\nAssimilation on its own is similar to the old melting pot idea\nthat new immigrants should give up their personal cultural\nidentities in favor of greater, more dominant societal norms.\nImmigrants who changed their names upon arriving in the\nUnited States would be acting within the assimilation out-\ncome of acculturation. Thus, individual cultural identity is\nlost, but a positive relationship to the dominant society is\nestablished. The final outcome of assimilation is the most\npositive and is referred to as integration. This type of accul-\nturation results in the retention of cultural identity and a posi-\ntive relationship to dominant society. Using this model,\nintegration is the best acculturation outcome for psychologi-\ncal well-being because of the balance struck between the cul-\nture of the home country and that of the new one. Studies\nhave revealed acculturation as a predictor of mental health\nscores, where the more positive an acculturation outcome,\nthe better the psychological well-being (Ogbu, 1992; Portes\nWhen acculturation studies have examined Chinese inter-\nnational students, the results have been relatively similar and\nconclusive. As with other international groups, the more\nChinese international students integrate into U.S. culture, the\nmore positive the mental health and social outcomes\n(Lowinger, He, Lin, & Chang, 2014; Zhang & Goodson,\n2011). Conversely, the more isolated Chinese international\nstudents are and the less social support they receive, the more\ndifficulty they will have adjusting to life in the United States\nChinese international students believe they are as intelligent\nas their United States counterparts (Lowinger et al., 2014; T.\nTan & Weidman, 2013), qualitative studies have revealed\nChinese students do experience concerns about becoming\n\"too Americanized\" during the course of their international\ntration of the acculturative stress Chinese international stu-\ndents can experience.\nFurther research investigating Chinese international stu-\ndents has revealed other pervasive issues in addition to\nacculturative ones. Attending school exclusively in the\nEnglish language can be particularly challenging for Chinese\ninternational students, who may feel comfortable reading\nand writing, but find listening and speaking increasingly\ncompound stress in social and classroom interactions with\nnon-Chinese; the stress of such interactions have been well\ndocumented for Chinese international students in both the\nUnited States and the United Kingdom (Smith & Khawaja,\ntions and difficulty interacting with non-Chinese culminates\nin the classroom experience, where Chinese students have\nreported experiencing culturally insensitive activities, such\nas a choose your favorite U.S. celebrity game, and reported a\nbelief that U.S. faculty and students have a negative percep-\ntion of Chinese students (Smith & Khawaja, 2011; T. Tan &\nsomewhat confirmed as Li and Wang (2008) reported Asian\nstudents in general receive less classroom attention from fac-\nulty and peers.\nCareer Decision Making of Chinese Students\nIn regard to career decisions of international students, the\nliterature is fairly consistent noting a lack of research on the\ncareer development needs of minorities in general andAsians\nin particular (Chang, Chen, Greenberger, Dooley, &\nSuzuki, 1994). The studies conducted with students across\nrace/ethnicity typically find that self-efficacy and parental\nexpectations play the largest roles in shaping career aspira-\ntions, especially in Chinese students (Y. B. Chung, 2002;\nstudies have failed to examine is the intersection of two\nissues--that is, what happens when Chinese international\nstudents must navigate their career aspirations while han-\ndling the emotional challenges associated with international\nstudy? Leong and Serafica (1995) noted that a solid theory\nhas yet to be advanced about how outside pressure affects\ncareer goals and, ultimately, career decisions for Asian work-\ners. Furthermore, research has not examined how emotional\nadjustment, which is defined as collective social stress,\nCozart and Rojewski 3\nanxiety, depression, sense of inadequacy, self-esteem, and\nself-reliance, affects the career aspirations of Asian students,\nand specifically, Chinese international students (Reynolds &\nCareer aspirations, meaning an individual's career-related\nambitions or decisions under perfect circumstances, have\nconsistently shown over time to be strong predictors of occu-\npational attainment (Rojewski, 2005). Although we may\nnever understand fully the impact of emotional experiences\nat school on Chinese students' career aspirations, we can\ngain insights and look for patterns to better understand this\nphenomenon. Therefore, exploring how Chinese students\nbalance the emotional issues surrounding acculturation with\nthe career pressure of international graduate study can help\neducators and counselors better know how to support and\nguide these students regarding future career decisions.\nThe purpose of this analysis was to determine the rela-\ntionship between career aspirations and emotional adjust-\nment of Chinese international graduate students. To\nunderstand whether the scores for these constructs and sub-\nsequent analysis were unique to this population, it was also\nimportant to evaluate United States students, meaning stu-\ndents of different racial and ethnic backgrounds who were\nborn and maintain citizenship in the United States, on the\nsame measures. This group did not include any other interna-\ntional students or Chinese American students. Chinese inter-\nnational graduate student or U.S. graduate student was an\nindividual enrolled for a minimum of three graduate credit\nhours at a large public university in the southeastern United\nSymptoms Index (ESI) of the Behavior Assessment System\nfor Children, 2nd Edition (BASC-2; Reynolds & Kamphaus,\n2004) measured emotional adjustment, which included mea-\nsures of social stress, anxiety, depression, sense of inade-\nquacy, self-esteem, and self-reliance. The dependent variable,\ncareer aspirations, referred to an individual's career-related\nambitions or decisions under ideal conditions (Rojewski,\n2005). The primary research question framed the design and\nanalysis for this study as a regression analysis as we sought\nto determine the best set of emotional adjustment variables to\nexplain the career aspirations of Chinese international and\nU.S. graduate students.\nTheoretical Framework\nSocial cognitive career theory (SCCT; Lent, Brown, &\nHackett, 1994) emphasizes that self-efficacy, outcome expec-\ntations, and goals work in conjunction with other aspects of\neach person, such as family background, socioeconomic sta-\ntus, immigrant status, and ethnicity, to shape career goals. This\nmeans that career development is ultimately a series of inter-\nlocking processes of interest development, choice, and perfor-\nmance. SCCT is largely a derivative of Bandura's (1986)\nsocial cognitive theory, which features the importance of indi-\nviduals in facilitating their own occupations, interests, and\naspirations, as well as the factors that can enhance or detract\nthis facilitation. SCCT further postulates that positive career\ndevelopment depends on individual experiences resulting\nfrom interactions with the environment and personal factors\nIn the SCCT framework, self-efficacy refers to individual\nappraisals of capabilities to take action and succeed toward a\nspecific goal, and it is a dynamic attribute that is always\none that best fits with the idea of emotional adjustment in\nSCCT, as emotional well-being is likely to influence indi-\nvidual perceptions of their ability to work toward and achieve\npersonal goals. The second major component of SCCT is\noutcome expectations, and it refers to the question \"If I do\nthis, what will happen?\" In other words, outcome expecta-\ntions are the \"imagined consequences of particular behav-\niors\" (Lent et al., 1994, p. 83). In the case of this study,\noutcome expectations are viewed as a manifestation of inter-\nnal behavior factors, such as parents, peers, and the cross-\ncultural experience influencing Chinese international\nstudents. The final construct of SCCT asserts that goals are\nan important piece of the self-regulation of behavior (Lent\noutcomes of goals: They organize and guide behavior; they\ncan sustain behavior over long periods of time, even without\nexternal reinforcement; and their presence increases the like-\nlihood that the individual will attain the desired outcomes.\nSCCT (Lent et al., 1994) was applied in this study of\nChinese international students to provide a theoretical frame-\nwork for organizing variables such as career aspirations and\nemotional adjustment in relationships (Mau & Bikos, 2000).\nThe three main components of SCCT--self-efficacy, out-\ncome expectations, and goal expectations--align well with\nthe constructs associated with this study. Self-efficacy relates\nto emotional adjustment, outcome expectations relate to inter-\nnal behavior factors that will be in play with emotional adjust-\nment, and goal expectations relate to career aspirations. A\nmodel showing this alignment appears in Figure 1, where the\nmajor constructs of SCCT each have an associated factor.\nAnother important consideration in the selection of a the-\noretical framework is its application to use with students\nfrom ethnic or racial minorities in the United States. SCCT is\none of the only theories of career development that ade-\nquately accounts for the role of the individual, which means\nthis theory allows and expects variation based on ethnicity.\nFor this reason, SCCT is the theoretical framework of choice\nfor many career-related studies involving students from eth-\nnic or racial minorities in the United States (Kiang, Yip,\nGonzales-Backen, Witkow, & Fuligni, 2006; Mau & Bikos,\napplied in a completed study of Chinese international stu-\ndents to provide a theoretical framework for organizing vari-\nables such as career aspirations and emotional adjustment in\nrelationships.\n4 SAGE Open\nMethod\nResearch Design\nA comparative correlational research design, using a group-\nadministered survey, was utilized for this study. Correlational\nresearch identifies the relationship between two or more\nvariables from the same sample (Huberty & Petoskey, 1999).\nBecause this study was focused on determining the relation-\nship between career aspirations and emotional adjustment\nfor Chinese international graduate students, a correlational\nresearch design was chosen where data were analyzed using\nregression analysis.\nPopulation and Sample\nThe abstract population for this study was composed of\nChinese international students attending institutions of\nhigher education in the United States. Chinese international\nstudents refer to students pursuing graduate study in the\nUnited States, but who maintain citizenship in China.\nGraduate students were selected for this study, as the univer-\nsity used for the sample included significantly more Chinese\ninternational graduate students than undergraduate. To\nunderstand differences experienced by international students\nfrom U.S. ones, a comparison sample of U.S. graduate stu-\ndents was also collected. U.S. students refer to students of\ndifferent ethnic and racial backgrounds, but who were born\nand maintain citizenship in the United States. This group did\nnot include any additional international or Chinese American\nstudents. Because of the cost and time challenges associated\nwith contacting all members of the abstract population, a\nconvenience sample of Chinese international students and\nU.S. students enrolled at a large, southeastern university was\nsurveyed. Using Olejnik's (1984) guidelines, a sample size\nof 66 participants was needed based on an estimated medium\neffect size, an alpha level of .05, and statistical power of .70.\nThe two questionnaires used for this study were adminis-\ntered to both Chinese and U.S. college students enrolled in\ngraduate degree programs at the university. Participants\ncompleted the questionnaires in five different group admin-\nwere administered to U.S. graduate students in a graduate\nstatistics course and a graduate political science course, and\nto Chinese international students at international coffee hour,\na dinner through university housing, and an open-call survey\nevent on campus. Each participant only attended one admin-\nistration. The final sample size of Chinese students was\nn = 24 and U.S. students was n = 46, for a total of 70 partici-\npants, once questionnaires containing incomplete responses,\nextraneous international student responses, and outliers were\nremoved.\nThe gender distribution of participants from both Chinese\nand U.S. student groups was similar, with each group of stu-\ndents including half males and half females, even though this\nis not representative of the university as a whole. This differ-\nence may be a result of the convenience sampling strategy\nemployed for this study. However, there was more variation\nbetween the groups in terms of age, department of study, and\ntime at the university. The average age for Chinese students\nmore than one third (n = 9) were students within the College\nof Arts and Sciences. Other majors represented in Chinese\nparticipants included, College of Education (n = 2), College\nof Pharmacy (n = 2), School of Public and International\nAffairs (n = 2), College of Agriculture and Environmental\nSciences (n = 3), College of Family and Consumer Science\n(n = 1), College of Journalism (n = 3), School of Law (n = 1),\nand the College of Veterinary Medicine (n = 1). Furthermore,\n67% (n = 16) of participants had been in the United States for\nless than 1 year. All Chinese students participating in the sur-\nvey, except for one, had been studying at the university for\nless than 3 years.\nOf the U.S. students who completed surveys, the com-\nolder group than the Chinese students. In terms of department\nof study, U.S. students were more homogeneous than the\nChinese students. U.S. students who participated in the study\nwere mainly students within the College of Education and the\nFigure 1. Elements of social cognitive career theory (Lent, Brown, & Hackett, 1994) and associated factors of emotional adjustment\nand career aspirations applied to the study of Chinese international and U.S. graduate students.\nCozart and Rojewski 5\nSchool of Public and International Affairs (n = 44), a result\nof sampling program-specific courses for that group.\nInstrument\nThis study required instruments that measured two different\nvariables--emotional adjustment and career aspirations.\nThere was not a single instrument that addressed both these\nissues; therefore, multiple instruments were used. The\nBASC-2 (Reynolds & Kamphaus, 2004) was used to mea-\nsure emotional adjustment. The BASC-2 is comprised of five\ndifferent measures of behavior, including the Teacher Rating\nscale (TRS), Parent Rating scale (PRS), Self-Report of\nPersonality (SRP), Structured Developmental History\n(SDH), and Student Observation System (SOS). The mea-\nsures can be used collectively or independently, and the SRP\nhas been used in many studies as a reliable method for deter-\nmining the emotional condition of foreign students (Demaray,\nMalecki, Davidson, Hodgson, & Rebus, 2005; Jung &\nStinnett, 2005; Z. Zhou, Peverly, Xin, Huang, & Wang,\n2003). There are three different versions of the SRP specific\nto children, adolescents, and college students. Only the SRP\nfor college-aged students was used because it included a spe-\ncific form to measure emotional disturbance/adjustment,\nwhich was the interest for this study. The SRP took about 20\nto 30 min to complete, and included True/False and 4-point\nLikert-type items with never, sometimes, often, or almost\nalways response options. Once completed, the college form\nyielded four different composite scores: Internalizing\nProblems, Inattention/Hyperactivity, Personal Adjustment,\nand the ESI. Whereas all scores were tabulated, only the ESI\nscores were analyzed, as they were the most directly related\nto this study. The ESI is composed of the summative scores\nfrom six different scales including social stress, anxiety,\ndepression, sense of inadequacy, self-esteem, and self-reli-\nance. The BASC-2 manual (Reynolds & Kamphaus, 2004)\nprovided reliability estimates for internal consistency and\ntest\u00adretest reliability. Overall, internal consistency coeffi-\ncients calculated by age range and gender for SRP scores\nwere reported in the middle .90s for the ESI, indicating the\ncoefficient was sufficiently reliable for testing emotional\nadjustment (C. S. Tan, 2007). The SRP included three differ-\nent indexes to evaluate the validity of individual responses,\nF, V, and L, each of which identified unlikely response pat-\nterns by participants and questionably valid results. None of\nthe participants in this study had scores outside of the normal\nrange on any of these indexes. Cronbach's alpha values were\nalso calculated to show internal consistency of scores. These\nvalues were .809 for all students together, .795 for Chinese\nstudents, and .821 for U.S. students. Values greater than .70\nare considered acceptable for social science research (Gall,\nGall, & Borg, 2007). Finally, the ESI from the SRP has suc-\ncessfully been used in other studies to evaluate the emotional\nwell-being of foreign-born students from a non-diagnostic\napproach, even though the instrument was normed using the\ngeneral U.S. population (Demaray et al., 2005; Jung &\nIn addition to evaluating emotional adjustment, we also\nexamined career aspirations. Career aspirations were mea-\nsured by an open-ended question included in the demo-\ngraphic questionnaire. Specifically, the question asked, \"If\nyou were completely free to choose any job in any setting,\nwhat job would you most like to have 10 years from now?\"\nwithout using any specific prompts or job lists. This question\nallowed each participant to record a single career aspiration.\nTo quantify the open-ended responses about desired career,\nanswers were categorized as a continuous variable using\nfour-digit prestige codes from the Socioeconomic Index\noccupational groups that are further broken down into 504\nseparate occupations. The four-digit prestige codes range\nwith higher codes reflecting higher prestige occupations and\nlower codes less prestigious ones. Reliability and validity\nwere addressed for the career aspirations instrument by con-\nducting a pilot study of eight international students who did\nnot overlap with the sample in the main study. The pilot\nstudy served two purposes--one, it allowed for testing of the\ncareer aspirations question, and two, it provided an opportu-\nnity to become familiar with the coding and recording of\nresponses using the SEI and the BASC-2.\nThe student questionnaire also included questions regard-\ning degree level, age, major, length of time in the United\nStates, educational and occupational information for both\nparents, and parental career aspirations. Although these\nwere not the focus of this study, the literature showed these\nwere important factors to consider when evaluating Chinese\nto provide additional context for understanding and inter-\npreting results.\nResearch Procedures\nPermission to conduct this research was granted through the\ninstitutional review board (IRB) at the university, and data\ncollection began in October of 2010. There were three survey\ntimes for Chinese international students and two survey\ntimes for U.S. students for a total of five different administra-\ntions. Participants were recruited throughout this time period\nand only participated in one administration. Data collection\nwas completed in February of 2011. Both groups of partici-\npants anonymously completed the BASC-2 and demographic\nquestionnaire, which included the career aspirations ques-\ntion. A translator was available for Chinese students during\neach survey administration to help with any language-based\nquestions, and all participants were reminded that if they\nwere uncomfortable or wanted to cease participation, they\ncould at any time.\n6 SAGE Open\nData Analysis\nDescriptive and inferential statistics were used to evaluate\neach of the research questions. Analyses were completed\nusing the SPSS. Means and standard deviations were tabu-\nlated to compare the career aspirations and emotional adjust-\nment between Chinese international and U.S. students.\nMultiple regression analysis was also used to determine the\nrelationship between career aspirations and emotional adjust-\nment, as well as to determine which emotional adjustment\nvariables best explain career choice.\nResults\nPrestige scores for Chinese international students' career\ncian), whereas U.S. students ranged from 34.44 (housewife)\nto 87.49 (biological science teacher). A majority of students\nfrom both groups aspired to high prestige occupations. The\nmost common response across both groups was professor,\nwhich has a prestige score of 86.98 when a specific field is\nnot identified. Chinese international students had a mean\nsamples t test for group mean difference showed no statisti-\ncally significant difference between Chinese international\nand U.S. students' career aspirations.\nEmotional adjustment scores were obtained by calculat-\ning a score for the ESI within the SRP form from the BASC-2\n(Reynolds & Kamphaus, 2004); possible ESI scores range\nfrom 22 to 100. Chinese international students scored an\naverage ESI score of 47.5 (SD = 6.3), whereas U.S. students\nreported an average score of 45.9 (SD = 6.8). Scores falling\nbetween 41 and 59 are considered average within the general\npopulation. An independent samples t test for group mean\ndifference showed there was no statistically significant dif-\nference between Chinese and U.S. students' emotional\nadjustment.\nTo determine the nature of the relationship between career\naspirations and ESI subscales, individual correlations were\ncalculated for each of the ESI subscales with each other and\nthen with career aspirations. Statistically significant relation-\nships were present for almost all of the emotional adjustment\nsubscales with each other in all three analyses. However,\nthere were no significant relationships found between each\nof these variables and career aspirations. Social stress had\nthe highest correlation with career aspirations for U.S. stu-\ndents (r = .251), whereas depression had the highest correla-\ntion (r = .241) for Chinese international students.\nThe completed regression model for Chinese international\nstudents of all the variables revealed an R2 = .210 and\nadjusted R2 = -.068, indicating a minimal relationship\nbetween emotional adjustment components and career aspi-\nrations. The negative adjusted R2 value also indicated the\nmodel included variables that were not helpful in predicting\ncareer outcomes. The omnibus test of all independent vari-\np = .614 with  = .05. Calculated p values for the indepen-\ndent variables to test their predictive value on career aspira-\ntions showed that no ESI components were statistically\nsignificant predictors of career aspirations. The completed\nregression model for U.S. students of all the variables\na minimal relationship, but higher than the relationship seen\nwith Chinese international students. In addition, the omnibus\ntest of all independent variables was not statistically signifi-\np values for the independent variables revealed that social\nstress (p = .011) was a statistically significant predictor of\ncareer aspirations. Therefore, multiple regression analysis\nfor Chinese international and U.S. students together and sep-\narately found a minimal relationship between emotional\nadjustment and career aspirations for this sample, but did\nshow social stress as a statistically significant predictor of\ncareer aspirations for U.S. students. Complete regression sta-\ntistics for both groups are presented in Table 1.\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nNot unexpectedly, both Chinese international and U.S. grad-\nuate students aspired to high prestige occupations, with most\nstudents aspiring to be college professors in various subjects.\nThe emotional adjustment scores of both groups were con-\nsistent with scores typically from the general population.\nStatistically significant differences did not exist between\nthese groups on either career aspirations or emotional adjust-\nment; rather, both groups displayed striking similarities\ngiven their divergent backgrounds and cultures. A strong\nrelationship was not present between career aspirations and\nemotional adjustment, though Social Stress, one of the emo-\ntional adjustment subscales, did have a small but statistically\nsignificant predictive value on career aspirations for U.S.\nstudents.\nGiven that previous studies have documented unique\nemotional challenges faced by Chinese international stu-\ndents, particularly in navigating a new culture (Tan &\nnational students in this study did not demonstrate any emo-\ntional adjustment group differences when compared with\nU.S. students. Although speculative, this lack of difference\nmay be attributed to the fact that all students were graduate\nstudents with similar career goals, and as a result, any differ-\nences were mitigated. Undergraduate or high school students\nmay exhibit emotional adjustment differences simply due to\nimmaturity or lack of development whereas graduate stu-\ndents have learned how to overcome or cope with emotional\nissues through additional life experience (Luzzo, 2000). It is\nalso possible, as Hsu (2010) reported, that Chinese who\nmake the decision to attend school in the United States may\nCozart and Rojewski 7\nbe more \"extroverted and open to experience\" (p. 422) than\nthose students who choose to pursue graduate study within\nChina. If true, then those Chinese students included in this\nsample may be closer to U.S. students in emotional adjust-\nment and career aspirations than expected.\nA few studies have reported that the graduate school\nexperience can transcend other factors, such as socioeco-\nnomic or immigrant status. Moss (2005) found socioeco-\nnomic status and cultural capital were not statistically\nsignificant predictors of graduate student achievement.\nFuligni and Witkow (2004) found that immigrant students\nperformed as well as United States-born students in postsec-\nondary settings regardless of type of degree pursued or grade\npoint average, with East Asian students having the most pos-\nitive academic achievement. This is particularly interesting\ngiven graduate school in and of itself is a stressful experi-\nence, particularly regarding academic performance, work,\nand finances (Oswalt & Riddock, 2007)--stressors that cer-\ntainly transcend cultural barriers. In any event, it appears that\nthe select groups of Chinese and U.S. students in this study\nwere more alike than different on the factors examined, and\nfor graduate students, educational similarities appear to out-\nweigh cultural differences. This outcome is especially inter-\nesting when considering the role of culture and education on\nthe development and implementation of career aspirations.\nThe lack of difference is also interesting given that a\nmajority of Chinese students in this study (66.7%, n = 16)\nhad been in the United States and at this specific university\nfor less than 1 year. Acculturation studies have revealed that\nthe first year is often the most difficult for an immigrant\nadjusting to a new country and culture (Lo, 2010; Tong,\nficulties finding a strong friendship community are further\nchallenges to the early immigrant experience (Chae & Foley,\nhardship of being away from family and friends. Other stud-\nies that have examined the experiences of Chinese interna-\ntional students have also found \"culture shock,\" language\ndifferences, and interactions with non-Chinese students as\nadditional hurdles (Spencer-Oatey & Xiong, 2006; T. Tan &\nThe challenges associated with the immigrant experience\nwould subsequently lead to the conclusion that members of\nthis group would have shown heightened emotional issues\nsimply given the nature of their current life stage and limited\ntime living in the United States. However, the results of this\nstudy are consistent with the results of K. T. Wang et al.\n(2012), who found the majority of Chinese international stu-\ndents did not experience strong levels of mental stress during\ntheir cultural transition into the United States.\nThe limitations of this study should also be acknowl-\nedged, perhaps the greatest of which is the sample of stu-\ndents. This was not a random sample, and the sample size\nwas smaller than one would expect in a regression analysis.\nFurthermore, by only sampling one southeastern university\npopulation, the study is limited by the responses from this\ngroup and is less generalizable. The responses from students\nat smaller colleges could be drastically different and more\nstressful, in the same way student experiences in larger\nChinese communities may have been better due to more\ncommunity support. There is also the chance for bias given\nthat even though the instruments were tested with interna-\ntional populations, they were not normed for use with\nChinese students. Chinese undergraduate students could also\noffer greater variance in career goals than graduate students,\nwho often have more similar occupational ambitions.\nFurthermore, it is possible that the lack of observable dif-\nference may have resulted from the low Chinese sample size\nand sampling strategy. Because most participants were con-\ntacted personally, the sample may have neglected to include\nTable 1. Regression Statistics by Group.\nVariable B SE B  R2 Adjusted R2 p\n8 SAGE Open\nChinese students who were more socially isolated, thus\nskewing results to represent only more outgoing, well-\nadjusted students (i.e., Chinese students having a more dif-\nficult time adjusting would not be as likely to attend an open\nsurvey call). This would be consistent with the findings of\nZhang and Goodson (2011), who found no depressive or psy-\nchological issues in Chinese international students who felt\nthey could successfully navigate U.S. culture and remained\nconnected in a community of other Chinese. Another possi-\nble explanation for Chinese responses is positive outreach\nprograms sponsored by the university that are designed to\nhelp students make the transition to study in the United\nStates. For example, there are six different student organiza-\ntions specifically dedicated to the needs of Chinese students\non campus, not to mention other services available to all\ninternational students through the Office of International\nEducation and International Student Life, such as socials,\ninformation sessions, and trips. However, because the\nChinese international students did not demonstrate any prob-\nlems and inquiries to students' specific experiences were not\na part of this study, it certainly makes a compelling case for\nfuture research to provide in-depth study of the experiences\nthese students have while studying in the United States.\nIn terms of career aspirations, the literature is fairly con-\nsistent in noting that little research has been conducted on the\ncareer development needs of minorities andAsians in particu-\nThe studies that have been conducted with students across\nrace/ethnicity typically find that self-efficacy and parental\nexpectations play the largest role in shaping aspirations (Y. B.\nFurthermore, Liu (2009) reported acculturation was a statisti-\ncally significant predictor of career self-efficacy for interna-\ntional graduate students. Self-efficacy refers to individual\nappraisals of capabilities to take action and succeed toward a\nspecific goal, and it is a dynamic attribute that is always\nto the idea of emotional adjustment, as emotional well-being\nis likely to influence individual perceptions of their ability to\nwork toward and achieve personal goals.\nSubsequently, given the results of other studies and the\nnature of SCCT (Lent et al., 1994), we expected to find some\nrelationship between career aspirations and emotional adjust-\nment. The regression model found a minimal relationship\nbetween these variables, showing that the aspects of emo-\ntional adjustment accounted for roughly 10% of career aspira-\ntions for domestic students and did not account for career\naspirations of Chinese students. This opens many more ques-\ntions about what factors contribute to how these students\nmake career decisions. For example, what is the role of par-\nents in career decision making, particularly for Chinese inter-\nnational students? If parents were guiding students' career\naspirations, then career aspirations could lead to emotional\nadjustment issues, ultimately making emotional adjustment\ndependent on career aspirations--the inverse of how these\nvariables were explored in this study.\nThe supplemental information collected on the demo-\ngraphic questionnaire showed Chinese international stu-\ndents' parents had higher than average occupational levels\nthan U.S. students, but U.S. students' parents had higher\neducational attainment. Therefore, it is difficult to know\nexactly how much influence parents were exerting in stu-\ndents' decisions because parental relationships were not sig-\nnificantly explored. This lack of information could cloud\nresults given parent\u00adchild relationships have been strong\ncareer predictors in other studies (Chung, 2002; Y. B. Fuligni\nconfirm little about the group of students itself, whereby the\nentire population of this study acts perhaps as an outlier\nbecause of the homogeneous nature of graduate students.\nThus, whereas some career theories (e.g., Lent et al., 1994;\nSuper, 1990) suggest culture and emotional well-being should\nplay a significant role in career decision making, this study\nshowed that the educational similarities of graduate students\nseemed to overshadow the influence of cultural and psycho-\nlogical differences.\nAlthough this study was more exploratory than explana-\ntory in terms of better understanding the relationship between\nemotional adjustment and career decision making in Chinese\ninternational students, it does open interesting avenues to\nguide future research and practice. Because of the impor-\ntance of personal relationships in recruiting participants, it\nwould be interesting to see similar questions about the expe-\nriences of Chinese international graduate students through\nqualitative research and focus on in-depth interviews with a\nfew students. This study would also be interesting to see\nevaluating all international students, not just Chinese. In\nterms of practice, it is important for career counselors and\neducators to make sure Chinese students are not being over-\nlooked in terms of counseling and educational services that\nare currently available. Literature has shown Asian students\nreceive less classroom attention from teachers and peers and\nhave less access to resources for psychological and career\nneeds, as well as face potentially negative perceptions by fac-\nulty and other university students (Kim & Yeh, 2002; Li &\nChinese students on college campuses have equal access to\nservices as their U.S. peers. Because social stress was a sig-\nnificant predictor of career aspirations for all of the students\nin this study, it is important for college administrators to be\naware of the social stress associated with graduate school and\nto provide necessary resources to help mitigate any negative\neffects this may have on graduate student performance.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nCozart and Rojewski 9\nReferences\nBandura, A.
