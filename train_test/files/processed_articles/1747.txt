In two key longitudinal stu-\ndies [7,8], investigators used \"first difference\" models to\nestimate the influence of urban form on travel behavior\nor obesity. First difference models and a similar method,\n\"fixed effects\" models, use within-person estimators to\ncontrol for unmeasured characteristics that remain con-\nstant throughout the study period [6,9] (e.g., genetics or\nresilient attitudes toward exercise) by analyzing variation\nin the exposure and outcome within person, over time.\nWithin-person estimation is especially valuable when\nconfounders are difficult to measure (e.g., residential\nselection factors), and is most appropriate for exposure-\noutcome relationships with short lag times [10] (e.g.,\ntheorized built environment influences on PA). Recent\nlongitudinal studies [11-14] investigating built environ-\nment effects on PA do not use within-person estimation\nto control for unmeasured characteristics.\nFurthermore, the few relevant existing studies which\nuse within-person estimation [2,7,8,15] examine changes\nin behavior or body weight related to changes in urban\nform resulting from residential relocation. However, the\nenvironment can change around stationary residents.\nFurthermore, residential relocation is often triggered by\nevents such as marriage or employment changes [16],\nwhich may also influence health-related behaviors.\nTherefore, restricting to those who move residences\nmay induce selection bias [17].\nOur primary objective was to estimate within-person\neffects of time-varying, objectively measured built and\nsocioeconomic environment characteristics on moderate\nto vigorous PA (MVPA) in a nationally representative\nsample. Secondary objectives were to (a) assess the\ninfluence of time invariant, unmeasured characteristics\non environment-PA associations by comparing within-\nperson estimates to na\u00efve estimates which do not\naddress unmeasured characteristics, and (b) explore\nselectivity related to residential relocation. This paper\nreports the results of these objectives, followed by a dis-\ncussion of the complexities of adjusting for residential\nself-selection and residential relocation, particularly dur-\ning the adolescent to young adult transition.\nMethods\nStudy population and data sources\nThe National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health\n(Add Health), a cohort study of 20,745 adolescents\nrepresentative of the U.S. school-based population in\ninto adulthood (18-26 years at Wave III).

Of the remain-\ning sample (n = 13,546), those missing individual-level\nor both (n = 11) were excluded. Those excluded due to\nmissing data (n = 845) were generally similar to the ana-\nlytical sample (n = 12,701) with regard to Wave I and\nIII individual sociodemographics, MVPA, and environ-\nmental variables.

We selected census tracts for census variables\nbased on similar sensitivity analysis (unpublished data),\nwhile crime data were available only at the county level.\nBuilt and socioeconomic environment measures We\nselected built and socioeconomic environment measures\nshown to adequately represent multidimensional envir-\nonmental constructs [20]. Table 1 presents variable\ndescriptions, data sources, and geographic unit. Briefly,\npay and public PA facilities counts were obtained\nfrom Dun and Bradstreet, a dataset of U.S. businesses\nvalidated against a field-based census [21]. We then cal-\nculated PA facility availability (counts per 10,000 popu-\nlation).

Socioeco-\nnomic position in young adulthood involves a complex\narray of behaviors and achievements [30,31] which are\npotential predictors of residential relocation, so we used\nparent income and education to indicate socioeconomic\nposition in both waves.\nStatistical analysis\nDescriptive analysis\nIndividual-level and environment variables were com-\npared by residential relocation status using adjusted\nWald tests and design-based F-tests (95% confidence\nlevel) for continuous and categorical variables, respec-\ntively. Analyses were weighted for national representa-\ntion and corrected for complex survey design using\nStata 10.1 survey commands. To address skewness, we\nreport median and interquartile range and performed\nstatistical tests on natural-log transformed pay and pub-\nlic facility availability and median household income.\nRegression analysis\nWithin-person effects of environment measures on\nMVPA bouts from adolescence (Wave I) to young adult-\nhood (Wave III) were estimated using fixed effects Pois-\nson regression (Objective 1). Fixed effects (versus first\ndifferences) accommodate our nonlinear dependent vari-\nable. By analyzing deviations of the outcome and expo-\nsures from person-specific means, fixed effects models\nremove person-specific error and are therefore not\nbiased by time invariant unmeasured characteristics. As\ndemonstrated elsewhere [6,8,32] and in additional file 1,\nappendix A, interpretation of the coefficients is\nunchanged from traditional regression models. In con-\ntrast, \"random effects\" estimates incorporate both\nbetween- and within-person variation and thus do not\ncontrol for unmeasured characteristics that vary or\nremain constant over time (na\u00efve estimation; Objective\nThe Hausman specification test formally compared\nfixed and random effects estimates. All models were fit\nusing the Stata 10.1 xtpoisson function [34], which pro-\nvided comparable estimates but does not accommodate\nprobability weights. Sample weighted, school cluster-cor-\nrected, within-person estimates obtained using an alter-\nnative method [32] were substantively similar, but\ncomparable random effects estimates were not possible\ngiven the available software. Random effects models cor-\nrected for school-level clustering by including school\nindicator variables [35]; higher-level clustering is sub-\nsumed into between-person variation which does not\ninfluence fixed effects regression models.\nThe MVPA distribution was overdispersed (the stan-\ndard deviation was larger than assumed by the Poisson\ndistribution), but the conditional likelihood for the nega-\ntive binomial distribution required for fixed effects mod-\nels is problematic [32]. However, additional error terms\nin random and fixed effects models [36] and correction\nfor school-level variation may help to address overdis-\npersion by allowing for sources of variability not\nincluded in a standard Poisson model. Estimates from\ncross-sectional Poisson and negative binomial models\nare virtually identical.\nBuffer-based environment measures were individual-\nlevel variables. While census tracts or counties could\ncomprise a third level in multilevel analysis, they are not\nnested within schools, our primary sampling unit and\nmore important source of clustering. Additionally, our\ndata were sparse (average 8 and 2.3 respondents per\ncensus tract in Wave I and III, respectively) and unba-\nWave I and III, respectively), so multilevel analysis may\nhave produced biased estimates [37]. Intraclass correla-\ntions for ln(MVPA) were minimal (0.03 in both Waves;\nICC's are not definable for Poisson distributed\noutcomes).\nNatural log transformations of environment measures\nlinearized relationships with MVPA bouts in preliminary\nanalysis. Because both the dependent and independent\nvariables were logged, model coefficients were inter-\npreted as elasticities, or the percent change in MVPA\nbouts predicted from a 1% change in the independent\nvariable. Time invariant individual-level variables were\nincluded in random effects models but are not estimated\nin fixed effects models. Time varying age was included\nin both models. Sex interactions with each environmen-\ntal variable were tested; for comparability, interaction\nterms were retained if significant (Wald p < 0.10) in the\nrandom or fixed effects model. Further interaction with\nresidential relocation status (Objective 2b) in fixed\neffects models was examined by including significant\n(Wald p < 0.10; lower order terms were retained) two-\nand three-way interactions between residential reloca-\ntion status, sex, and each environment measure. When\none or more interactions were included in the model,\ngroup-specific associations were reported.\nResults\nIndividual-level characteristics are presented in Table 2.\n68.5% (SE 1.2%) of the analytical sample moved between\nWaves I and III (data not shown), and changes in envir-\nonmental measures observed between Waves I and III\n(Table 3) provided sufficient variability for estimation of\nwithin-person effects, even for non-movers.\nWithin-person estimates indicated that with 1%\ngreater pay facilities in the neighborhood, MVPA bouts\nwere 0.024% higher in males; corresponding associations\nwere negative but not significant in females (Table 4).\nBoone-Heinonen et al.

Landscape diversity, public facility\navailability, and alpha index were unrelated to MVPA.\nThe Hausman specification test rejected the null\nhypotheses (p < 0.001) that there is no correlation\nbetween unexplained person-specific variation and the\nindependent variables. That is, changes in estimates after\ncontrolling for time invariant, unmeasured characteristics\nby applying the within-person estimator were statistically\nsignificant. Compared to random effect estimates, within-\nperson elasticities were larger for pay facility availability\nand, in males, almost two times larger for crime rate. In\nfemales, the within-person estimator attenuated negative\nrandom effects estimates for crime and reversed the asso-\nciation to the counter-intuitive direction (marginally sig-\nnificant) for median household income (Table 4).\nSeveral associations varied by residential relocation\nstatus and sex (Table 5). Elasticities between MVPA\nbouts and crime were substantially larger in non-movers\nthan movers, and landscape diversity was negatively\nassociated with MVPA only in non-movers. Public facil-\nity availability was positively associated with MVPA in\nfemale movers only, with variation in magnitude and\ndirection by sex- and relocation status.

To our knowledge, ours is the first\nstudy to examine built environment changes resulting\nfrom either residential relocation or changes around sta-\ntionary residents. After adjusting for unmeasured time\ninvariant characteristics, MVPA bouts were higher with\ngreater availability of pay facilities in males, and lower\nwith higher crime in males and females. Other associa-\ntions were null or in the counter-intuitive direction.\nHowever, we discuss several methodological considera-\ntions in the following sections.\nBuilt environment findings in the Add Health population\nIn contrast to relatively consistent cross-sectional associa-\ntions between the built environment and PA in the extant\neffects associations were weak or null in the Add Health\npopulation. Possible methodological explanations for these\ndifferences include our buffer-based environment mea-\nsures and complications related to broad geographic varia-\ntion and measurement of complex environments [20].\nIn another longitudinal, national study, urban sprawl was\nweakly related to obesity [8]; however, we expected a\nstronger, more robust relationship with PA, a more\nTable 5 Variation in within-person effect estimates of built and socioeconomic environment characteristics on MVPA\nMovers2 Non-movers2 Total sample2\nPay facility availability (count/10,000 population)\nPublic facility availability (count/10,000 population)\nMedian household income\nCrime\n1National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (U.S.; n = 12,701).

Residential relocation was defined as\ngreater than 1/4 mile Euclidean distance (Mover (n = 8,525) and Non-mover (n = 4,176)) between Wave I and III respondent locations. 3- and 2-way interactions\nbetween sex, residential relocation status, and environment measures were included if statistically significant (p < 0.1); if a 3-way interaction was significant, all\ncorresponding 2-way interactions were retained.\n*Statistically significant elasticity (2-sided p < 0.05)\nCI, Confidence Interval; MVPA, moderate-vigorous physical activity (bouts per week)\nBoone-Heinonen et al.

Additionally, theorized behavior-speci-\nfic relationships [41] such as promotion of walking for\ntransit by highly connected streets could not be examined\nwith our total leisure-time MVPA measure. Of course,\nnull associations may reflect a lack of causal effects. Ulti-\nmately, several na\u00efve estimates (cross-sectional and ran-\ndom effects) were null or counterintuitive, so\ncorresponding within-person estimates cannot be attribu-\nted solely to adjustment for unmeasured time invariant\ncharacteristics.\nResidential self-selection bias: upward, downward, or\nmore complex?\nResidential self-selection is typically presented as a posi-\ntive confounder which may create or magnify associations\nbetween the built environment and PA [5,6,42]. This\ncharacterization assumes that hypothesized built environ-\nment PA supports are: (1) preferred by or correlated with\nother neighborhood characteristics selected by people\nwith higher PA (e.g., high performing schools), or (2)\nuncommon in areas selected by people with generally\nlower PA (e.g., lack of resources in affordable neighbor-\nhoods). These assumptions are supported by dispropor-\ntionate allocation of recreation resources to more affluent\nneighborhoods [3,43-45] and by attenuation of relation-\nships between urban form and health-related outcomes\nby first difference models [8] and other adjustment meth-\nHowever, some PA-promoting features may be less\ncommon in advantaged areas. For example, pay facilities\nmay encourage PA but may be more common in com-\nmercial centers potentially selected less often by advan-\ntaged families (with higher PA levels). In this scenario,\nresidential self-selection factors are negative confoun-\nders, consistent with stronger positive estimated within-\nperson (versus random) effects of pay facilities on\nMVPA in males.\nIn contrast, within-person (versus random effects)\nestimates of higher crime effects on lower MVPA were\nattenuated in females, suggesting that self-selection fac-\ntors related to crime may operate differently in females\nversus males. That is, crime and safety may play a stron-\nger role in not only MVPA but also selection of a neigh-\nborhood in females than in males. Overall, these results\nsuggest that residential self-selection may magnify or\nattenuate built environment-PA associations and\ninvolves multifaceted relationships among complex\nenvironments and sex-specific determinants of residen-\ntial selection and PA.\nFurthermore, concerns that selection of neighbor-\nhoods based on activity-related amenities can explain\npositive environment-PA associations [5] suggests posi-\ntive confounding but not necessarily absence of causal\neffects. That is, selected amenities may help active\nindividuals to maintain or increase their activity levels,\nformally defined as \"effect in the treated\" [48]. Alterna-\ntively, \"effect in the untreated\" would support placement\nof activity-related amenities in areas of greatest need.\nInvestigation of heterogeneous effects may clarify the\npotential value of various built environment modifica-\ntion strategies.\nWithin-person estimators applied to a life transition\nperiod\nWithin-person estimators control for unmeasured char-\nacteristics that remain constant over time, a major\nstrength for addressing residential selection factors,\nwhich are challenging, if not impossible, to measure\naccurately [6]. However, examination of neighborhood\neffects during the adolescence to young adulthood tran-\nsition raises several complications:\nTime varying characteristics\nWithin-person estimators do not control for unmeasured\ncharacteristics which change over time. Residential relo-\ncation is typically triggered by marriage, childbearing,\nemployment opportunities [16], or other events which\ncharacterize the adolescent to young adulthood transition\n[49] and may lead to changes PA. Sedentary employment\nor intensive schooling in young adulthood may reduce\nPA levels, overwhelming any built environment effects on\nPA. Such events may also influence the type of neighbor-\nhood selected, thus comprising time varying, potentially\nunmeasured confounders.\nBecause these events are rare in adolescence, there\nwas insufficient variability in Wave I for analysis as time\nvarying measures. For example, magnification of nega-\ntive crime-MVPA associations by within-person estima-\ntion in males could be explained by movement into\nurban centers (with higher crime) for employment,\nwhich may limit leisure time for PA. Employment may\ntherefore be a time varying confounder which is unmea-\nsured in our study.\nImportantly, similar residential relocation triggers may\noccur throughout middle and later adulthood, with simi-\nlar implications for bias if they are not sufficiently mea-\nsured. Further, because residential self-selection may\nattenuate estimated relationships, null associations do\nnot necessarily imply that bias has been fully addressed.\nExploration and development of approaches for addres-\nsing time-varying characteristics that are unmeasured is\nclearly an important area for future work. Possible stra-\ntegies include instrumental variables methods or other\nsimultaneous equation strategies which model predictors\nof residential selection and neighborhood predictors of\nbehavior or health in two or more stages [6].\nAge-specific effects\nOur longitudinal models assume constant causal effects\nbetween time points [10], a questionable assumption\nBoone-Heinonen et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity 2010, 7:70\nduring periods of shifting PA determinants. However,\ndifferences in published cross-sectional associations\nbetween Wave I and III were not statistically significant\n[40]. Nevertheless, estimated causal effects in adoles-\ncents versus young adults should be further investigated\nusing longitudinal data and innovative adjustment\nstrategies.\nResidential selection by parents\nResidential location was likely determined by parents in\nWave I but respondents in Wave III. Therefore, the source\nof unmeasured residential selection factors varied across\nwaves and may contribute additional bias. However, pre-\nvious neighborhood characteristics are the most powerful\npredictors of subsequent neighborhood characteristics\n[50,51], suggesting that key unmeasured characteristics\nmay remain constant and carry across generations.\nSummary\nWithin-person estimation has limitations but is particu-\nlarly relevant for capturing short-term effects theorized\nfor behavioral outcomes such as PA [10] and is overall a\nvaluable approach for addressing residential self-selec-\ntion bias.\nRestriction by residential relocation status: an additional\nsource of bias?\nBiases related to residential stability may be at least as\nstrong as residential relocation: in the adolescent to young\nadulthood transition, individuals may remain in the par-\nent's home for reasons (e.g., care for young children,\nunemployment, or attendance at a local college) associated\nwith health behaviors (outcomes), and neighborhoods\n(exposures) change systematically (e.g., disadvantaged\ngroups more often live in neighborhoods with less advan-\ntageous environment trajectories [51]). Thus, conditioning\non residential relocation may induce selection bias.\nIndeed, movers and non-movers differ with regard to\nindividual characteristics in this and prior studies [52]\nand to estimated environment-MVPA associations. With\nthe exception of public facilities, associations were\nweaker or equivalent in movers than non-movers, but\nthese patterns could be reversed in adulthood when\nresidential stability is the norm.\nDifferential associations could also reflect different sets\nof unmeasured factors that influence residential selec-\ntion (in movers) versus changes in neighborhoods\naround stationary residents (non-movers). In the full\nsample, we expect residential selection factors to domi-\nnate because the majority of the sample moved between\nWaves I and III. However, distinguishing between selec-\ntion bias and differential confounding is complex and\nrequires future research using analytical methods such\nas marginal structural models that can address reloca-\ntion status without inducing selection bias through cov-\nariate adjustment or stratification [17].\nStrengths and limitations\nLimitations of this study include the methodological\nconcerns raised above. Additionally, our definition of\nresidential relocation did not capture duration of resi-\ndence and may have misclassified respondents who\nmoved short distances or moved but returned to the\nsame location by Wave III. Second, changes in socioeco-\nnomic environment variables around a given location\nmay reflect shifts in census boundaries between 1990\nand 2000. Also, there was temporal mismatch between\ninterview data and census and street connectivity data;\nin particular, temporal mismatch in Wave I was a trade-\noff for greater accuracy of a more current street data-\nbase. Third, neighborhood buffers delineated by street\nnetwork distance may yield different results; however,\npopulation counts needed for our facility availability\nmeasures were not available within network buffer\nareas, and environment measures are similar for\nEuclidean versus network distance-based buffers. Addi-\ntionally, conversion of population within buffers from\npopulation within block groups (Table 1) may have\nresulted in measurement error in our facilities availabil-\nity measures and bias of unpredictable direction and\nmagnitude in corresponding associations with MVPA,\nparticularly in heterogenous areas. Fourth, our data\nsources may have captured relevant neighborhood char-\nacteristics more completely in some subgroups (e.g., our\ndatabase does not capture PA resources on college cam-\npuses), potentially resulting in differential measurement\nerror by study wave or sociodemographic group. Fifth,\nthe PA environments at school, workplace, or other\nlocations were not addressed in this study.\nLoss to follow-up and missing individual-level data\ncould have led to biased estimates. Our leisure time\nMVPA frequency measure does not distinguish between\npossible behavior-specific effects [41] (e.g. promotion of\nactive transit versus exercise); incorporate physical activ-\nity duration or intensity; and may have systematically\nomitted important activities which could account for the\nobserved sex differences. Also, while our Wave I MVPA\nmeasure was based on instruments validated in other\nepidemiologic child and adolescent studies, modifica-\ntions made for Wave III (addition of age-appropriate\nactivities) has not been validated in young adults. How-\never, these are tradeoffs for the size and scope of the\nAdd Health study. Finally, the direction of effect\nremains ambiguous, as we examined simultaneous\nchanges in the environment and in MVPA bouts.\nHowever, our unique time-varying environment data-\nbase captures residential locations of a large, nationally\nrepresentative population followed through a critical life\nstage. By including six built and socioeconomic environ-\nment measures shown to adequately represent key\nenvironmental constructs, we addressed environmental\nBoone-Heinonen et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity 2010, 7:70\nconfounders while avoiding collinearity. Our longitudi-\nnal data was used to address residential self-selection\nbias and explore bias related to residential relocation.\nConclusions\nAfter controlling for residential self-selection bias using\nwithin-person estimators, MVPA bouts were related\nonly to pay facility availability in males and crime in\nmales and females in the expected directions. Our\nresults suggest that the magnitude and direction of resi-\ndential self-selection bias can vary across environmental\nand individual characteristics. Within-person estimators\nare valuable for controlling for residential self-selection\nbias, but their application to the adolescence to young\nadulthood transition or other major life transitions is\ncomplex. Further research and development of methods\nthat can address predictors of residential relocation\nwhile simultaneously controlling for unobserved mea-\nsures is needed.\nAdditional material\nAdditional file 1: Appendix A, Unmeasured variables in fixed effects\nmodels.
