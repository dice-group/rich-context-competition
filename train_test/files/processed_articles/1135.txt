This interest was ultimately\nrelated to the validity concerns that measurement raises in the social sciences, that is,\nthe degree to which a set of indicators measures the concept it is intended to measure\nIn the 1960s, the increasingly widespread use of the survey interview method for\nfertility studies in developing countries highlighted the need to assess the results of\nthese studies in terms of the reliability and stability of the responses obtained.\nFollowing the pioneer work of Westoff, Potter and Sagi (1961) in the US, reinterview\nstudies were done on the reliability and stability of questions about knowledge, attitude\nand practice of contraception (Poti, Chakraborti and Malaker 1962; Mauldin 1965;\nPiampiti 1977). These studies shared several conclusions about survey response error in\ndemographic surveys carried out in developing countries. First, response error varies\naccording to respondent characteristics, and to the content and psychological nature of\nthe questions asked. More personal, sensitive questions tend to be less reliable than\nquestions pertaining to relatively concrete factual matters (Knodel and Piampiti 1977).\nSecond, although reporting at the aggregate level may appear to be relatively reliable, it\noften masks a high level of individual-level inconsistency. There is contradictory\nevidence, however, about whether these individual errors are randomly or\nsystematically distributed (Coombs 1977: 255). Third, response error is high enough for\nsome variables (even in factual data) to give reasons for concern (Muckerjee 1975: 142;\nKnodel and Piampiti 1977: 65). Fourth, response error might be seriously affected by\ndifferences in the willingness of respondents to participate in the survey process and to\nanswer questions truthfully, and the respondents vary in the tendency to distort their\nresponses (Stycos and Back 1964). Finally, reports of female respondents on factual\nitems (such as age, number of pregnancies, number of children ever born) are as stable\nas male reports, but reports on behavioral items (such as ideal family size and\ncontraceptive use) are more stable for males than for females, and reports on attitudinal\nThis spate of studies culminated in the Response Error Project of the World\nFertility Survey (WFS) that, right from the start, placed great emphasis on the need for\nassessing non-sampling error in survey data (O'Muircheartaigh 1982:5). The Response\nError Project comprised studies in Peru (O'Muircheartaigh 1984a), Lesotho\n(O'Muircheartaigh 1984b), the Dominican Republic and Turkey (Note 2), and used\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 3\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 79\nreinterview designs to determine response reliability of key measures, such as children\never born, birth intervals and ever-use of contraception. The Response Error Project,\nand a separate evaluation of the data collected by the WFS in Indonesia (MacDonald,\nSimpson and Whitfield 1978), obtained encouraging results on the quality of the WFS\ndata, most often confirming the conclusions reached by previous analyses on the\nreliability of demographic surveys. For this reason, when the Demographic and Health\nSurveys (DHS) succeeded the WFS and became the most widely used demographic\nsurveys in developing countries, there were fewer reinterview studies to assess the\nreliability and stability of demographic data collected. As it can be seen in Table 1,\nthe most recent demographic literature contains only sparse attempts in that direction\nTable 1: A selection of studies addressing individual consistency of survey\nresponse in developing countries by means of re-interviews\nAuthors Data source(s) Sample\nsize\nType of reliability\nassessment\nRe-interview\nperiod\nScope/Focus\nWFS Response error\nproject:\n- O'Muircheartaigh\nround\n- O'Muircheartaigh\nround\n1-4 months Reporting on birth\nspacing and ever-\n- O'Muircheartaigh\nround\n?* use of contraception\n- O'Muircheartaigh\nDominican Republic\nround\nrounds\n4-8 months Reporting on\nbreastfeeding duration\nWestoff, Goldman\nDominican Republic\nround\n2-3 months Evaluation of\ncontraceptive\ncalendars\nCurtis and Arnold\nround\n5-11 months Reporting on fertility\nand FP\nHealth Services\nround\n3 months Effect of interviewers'\nsex on data quality\nrounds\n3 years Evaluation of\ncontraceptive\ncalendars\nJackson et al.

This circumstance is particularly relevant for survey questions on HIV/AIDS. Most\nof the currently available information on attitudes and behaviors towards HIV/AIDS\nand on patterns and trends in HIV/AIDS in developing countries comes from reports in\nsample surveys: the DHS, the Behavioral Surveillance Surveys, and the Multiple\nIndicator Cluster Surveys (Note 4). The questions asked in these surveys are extremely\nsensitive, and thus prone to high response error (Bignami et al., this volume). However,\na thorough examination of the survey literature reveals that the reliability and stability\nof questions on HIV/AIDS has never been evaluated. Besides, in the literature little\nattention is paid to evaluate the implications of individual inconsistency not only for\nunivariate distributions and means, but also for multivariate estimates. This might be an\nimportant problem for analyses that use the DHS data or data from similar surveys.\nIn addition, the studies shown in Table 1 adopt survey designs that differ from the\nmain survey in both the choice of the interviewers, the respondents, and the length (and\nsometimes even wording) of the questionnaire (Note 5). Existing studies on the\nreliability and stability of survey data generally use a shortened version of the original\nquestionnaire in the reinterviews (with few exceptions, e.g. Westoff, Goldman and\nMoreno 1990), so that the questions that are repeated are necessarily taken out of the\nquestionnaire context in which they had been asked originally. Besides, the interviewers\nwho carry out the reinterviews have normally undergone different selection procedures\nthan the interviewers employed in the main survey. For example, it is not uncommon\nthat only the best interviewers (Curtis and Arnold 1994) or the interviewer supervisory\nstaff (Coombs 1977) are chosen to carry out the reinterviews, so that the general\nreliability of the data are likely to be overestimated. Finally, existing studies that have\nevaluated response reliability have sometimes been based on specialized samples (e.g.\nreduces the generalizability of the results to the whole sample included in the original\nsurvey.\nThe 2001 wave of the Malawi Diffusion and Ideational Change Project collected\nreinterview data for a small subsample of respondents in the southern region of Malawi,\nbecause an initial error in drawing the sample for the survey led to the duplication of\nsome respondents' names on the lists used by the interviewers, so that some\nrespondents were accidentally selected twice to participate in the survey. This\nunplanned selection procedure guaranteed that respondents were reinterviewed under\nthe exact same survey conditions of the first interview. The reinterview data permit\nmeasuring individual consistency in response to survey questions on HIV/AIDS, as\nwell as other topics. In addition, it is possible to evaluate the impact of individual\ninconsistency in univariate as well as multivariate estimates.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 3\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 81\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data and methods used\nfor the analysis. The evidence concerning the individual consistency in survey response\nof the respondents in the selected sample (with particular focus on questions on\nHIV/AIDS) is then presented in Section 3. In Section 4 and 5, respectively, the\ncovariates and implications of individual inconsistency in survey response are analyzed.\nFinally, the results are discussed and a brief conclusion is provided.\n2. Data and methods\nThe data for the analysis come from reinterviews carried out in the context of the\nsecond wave of the Malawi Diffusion and Ideational Change Project (MDICP), a\nhousehold panel survey that examines the role of social networks in changing attitudes\nand behavior regarding family size, family planning, and HIV/AIDS in rural Malawi.\nThe first round of the MDICP (Malawi 1) was carried out in the summer of 1998, and\ninterviewed 1541 ever-married women of childbearing age and 1065 husbands of the\ncurrently married women in three Malawi districts: Balaka in South, Mchinji in the\nCentre and Rumphi in the North. In the summer of 2001, the second round of the\nsurvey (Malawi 2) followed-up the same respondents (if still eligible), and also\ninterviewed all their new spouses (Watkins et al., this volume).\nThe focus of the MDICP questionnaire is on family planning, AIDS and social\nnetworks, with other questions about basic socio-economic information (age, education,\nincome and wealth), and about women's autonomy, children, contraception and\nmarriage. Most questions on background characteristics, family planning and attitudes\nand behaviors towards HIV/AIDS are modeled on WHS/DHS questions (Note 6). The\nquestionnaire for Malawi 2 also included a section on sexual partnerships, which was\nexpected to be a sensitive issue given the magnitude of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the\ncountry and the emphasis of prevention programs on marital fidelity (Table 2). All\nquestions are fixed-coded, and there are no open-ended questions asked to the\nrespondents. The questionnaire was first designed in English, by drawing on qualitative\nresearch (semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and field-testing) that had been\ncarried out in the research areas to refine the questions' content and wording. The\nquestionnaire was then translated in the local languages (Yao, Chichewa, and\nTumbuka) from the original English-language model by a group of university-educated\nEnglish-speaking supervisors who had first been extensively trained with respect to the\nobjectives of the project and the meanings of the questions.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 3\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n82 http://www.demographic-research.org\nTable 2: Malawi 2 questionnaire's structure\nSection Topic Type Number of questions\nMales Females\nBackground Background characteristics: age,\nreligion, education, residence\nEconomic questions Household possessions; respondents'\noccupation and earnings\nMarriage History Marriage history for the current,\nprevious and first spouse\nChildren Number of CEB and CES; birth\nspacing; orphans\nFamily planning* &\nsocial networks\nAttitudes towards FP; social networks\non FP\nGender Attitudes towards gender roles Attitudinal 3 7\nPartnerships* Age at first sex; partnerships history Factual 29 29\nSexually Transmitted\nDiseases*\nKnowledge and attitudes towards\nsexually transmitted diseases\nAttitudinal/Behavioral 9 n.a.\nAIDS* AIDS knowledge and worry; social\nnetworks on AIDS\n* The section contains sensitive questions.\na For both males and females, the number of questions in the marriage history section is 31, which can all refer to up to three\nspouses. The total number of questions in this section thus might range from 31 (one spouse) to 93 (three spouses).\nb In 2001, for both males and females the total number of questions in the family planning section is 33, which includes a subset of\nquestions (14) that could refer up to four network partners. The total number of questions in this section thus ranges from 33\n(one network partner) to 75 (four network partners).\nc The total number of questions in the AIDS section is 34, which includes a subset of questions (16) that could refer up to four\nnetwork partners. Within this subset of questions, however, 13 questions were not asked if the network partners were the same\nas those in the family planning section. The total number of questions for the AIDS section thus ranges from 34 (one network\npartner, same as that in the family planning section) to 95 (four network partners, all different from those in the family planning\nsection).\nThe interviewers were males and females hired locally, so that they were generally of\nthe same ethnic group and engaged in the same type of occupation of the respondents\n(e.g. farming, small businesses). Before fieldwork started in each region, the\ninterviewers were given formal training conducted in the local language of the\nquestionnaires (Chichewa and Yao in the Southern region; Chichewa in the Central\nRegion; and Tumbuka in the Northern region). Because of these linguistic differences\nacross the three Malawian regions, the interviewing teams were not the same for the\ntwo rounds or even for the three districts in each round, although some interviewers\nparticipated in more than one district (if they were able to speak more than one\nlanguage) and/or in more than one round.\nThe questionnaires were closely checked for missing responses, first in the field by\nsupervisors, then by the home office at the end of each day of fieldwork. The data entry\nteam had been instructed to carry on an additional quality check on the questionnaires\nbefore they were entered in electronic form, and automatic checks for errors had been\nbuilt into the data entry program. The multiple checks permitted sending the interviewer\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 3\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 83\nback to the respondent if missing or inconsistent answers were discovered at any stage\nof the quality-check process and, ultimately, ensured a high quality of the data collected\n(Watkins et al., this volume).\nThe primary data for this paper consist of a set of reinterviews carried out between June\nquestionnaire to 96 women and 38 men in Balaka District, the first of the three sites to\nbe surveyed (Table 3).\nTable 3: Reinterviews: descriptive statistics\nRespondents\nMales Females\nRe-interview period (days):\n*Sample sizes refer to respondents interviewed in Balaka District.\nThe reinterviews were not planned--rather, they were carried out as a result of one\nof the problems that may arise while doing survey research. At the beginning of\nfieldwork, a glitch in the software used to draw the sampling frame led to a duplication\nof respondents' names on the lists used by the interviewers in Balaka District (Note 8).\nAs a result, some male respondents were re-interviewed in 11 villages of the 22\nsampled, and some female respondents were re-interviewed in 15 villages of the 32\nsampled (Note 9). The problem was eventually identified and solved during the initial\nweeks of fieldwork (Note 10). Since the reinterviews were unplanned, their study\ndesign was the same as that of the main survey in the choice of the respondents and the\ninterviewers, and in the length and wording of the questionnaire.\nTo verify that interviews were carried out with the same person, five identifying\ncharacteristics had to be the same in the main interview and in the reinterview:\nrespondent's name, father's name, spouse's name, residence and birthplace. On the\nbasis of these criteria, the reinterviews carried out with 11 women and 11 men were\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 3\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n84 http://www.demographic-research.org\ndeleted because they appeared, despite the same claimed name, not to be the same\nindividual.\nBackground characteristics for respondents interviewed once in the Malawi 2\nsample for Balaka District and for the final sample of respondents interviewed twice in\n2001 are displayed in Table 4. It can be noticed that male and female reinterviewed\nrespondents tend to be less educated and poorer (as measured by the possession of a\nradio) than the respondents who were interviewed only once. Re-interviewed male\nrespondents are also slightly older and re-interviewed females slightly younger than\nrespondents interviewed once. Similar selectivity effects among the reinterviewed\nrespondents are found by most reinterview studies (e.g. O'Muircheartaigh 1984a,\nGiven the unplanned design of the experiment the reinterview period for the\nduplicate interviews varied, being on average 9.7 days for males and 9.2 days for\nfemales (see Table 3). By minimizing the chances for genuine change to occur in\nattitudes and in behavioral characteristics between interviews (Note 12), such a short\ntime interval approximates quite well the \"instant replay\" of the original survey\nconditions, which provides the best indicator of reliability but is rarely possible to\nachieve outside the laboratory (Coombs 1977: 218). However, such a short interval\nbetween interviews increases the chance that the respondent (or the interviewer, if the\nsame) will remember the responses given in the original interview and simply repeat\nthem in the duplicate interview.\nAnother consequence of the unplanned design of the reinterview was that the\ninterviewers were not aware if a certain respondent had already been interviewed,\nunless the interviewer was the same in both interviews or the respondents themselves\ntold the interviewer they had already been interviewed. This happened only in few\ncases, however. The interviewer was the same in 9 cases; in only 26 cases did the\nrespondents explicitly state they had already been interviewed when the interviewer\nwent to reinterview them (these were generally the more educated and richer\nrespondents). Interestingly enough, in only one case an interviewer who reinterviewed\nthe same respondent mentioned the first interview in a comment at the end of the\nquestionnaire (\"The interview was good, as it was a revision for what we did a week\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 3\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 85\nTable 4: Percentage distribution of respondents interviewed once and twice in\nMales Females\nInterviewed once\nInterviewed twice\nInterviewed once\nInterviewed twice\nAge group\nEducation\nChildren ever born\nAge at first sex\n* See footnote 9 in the text.\nNote.

The survey items are grouped according to\nquestionnaire section (Note 13) and, for each section, the maximum consistency score is\nset equal to the total number of survey items in that section. From this maximum value,\na \"point\" is deducted for each inconsistent (Note 14) answer. For each section, the\nminimum consistency score that can be achieved is thus zero, if the respondent answers\ninconsistently to all survey items in the section. The sum of the score totals within each\nsection and across all sections gives the individual's total consistency score, and allows\nsorting respondents by their level of inconsistency and type of questions. Ultimately,\nthis scoring system allows assessing individual consistency with reference to the\n`whole' survey experience, rather than for isolated questions as it is normally done in\nthe literature. However, in order to contrast the results of this study with those of other\nstudies, the percentages of inconsistent respondents for a selected number of\ncomparable survey items are also calculated.\nThen, special attention is devoted to assessing the reliability and stability of\nquestions about attitudes and behaviors towards HIV/AIDS. In order to do so, I\ncalculate the crude index of disagreement (Note 15) for a set of ten questions asked in\nthe Malawi 2 questionnaire, which include three questions asked in DHS surveys.\nFinally, in order to gain a deeper understanding of the nature and implications of\nindividual inconsistencies in survey response, some covariates of individual consistency\n(the reinterview period, individual item non-response, and the questions' content) are\nanalyzed, and the implications of inconsistencies for univariate and multivariate data\nanalyses are evaluated\n3. Are the MDICP respondents consistent in their answers?\n3.1 Consistency scores\nDescriptive statistics for the consistency scores are presented in Table 5. The minimum\nconsistency score is slightly lower for males than for females whereas the opposite is\ntrue for the maximum score, thus indicating that males exhibit higher variability in\nresponse than females.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 3\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 87\nTable 5: Consistency scores of reinterviewed respondents, by sex and\nquestionnaire section: Descriptive statistics\nTotal number of Males (N=38) Females (N=96)\nsurvey items Min\nscore\nMax\nscore\nMean\nscore S.D.\nMin\nscore\nMax\nscore\nMean\nscore S.D.\nNote. The total number of survey items coincides with the maximum achievable consistency score for each questionnaire section.\nIn Table 6, individual consistency scores for each questionnaire section are\ngrouped into score quintiles, thus allowing identifying the percentage of respondents\nTable 6: Percentage distribution of reinterviewed respondents by consistency\nscore quintile, sex and questionnaire section\nFirst\nQuintile\nSecond\nQuintile\nThird\nQuintile\nFourth\nQuintile\nFifth\nQuintile\nFirst\nQuintile\nSecond\nQuintile\nThird\nQuintile\nFourth\nQuintile\nFifth\nQuintile\nNote. The total number of survey items coincides with the maximum achievable consistency score for each questionnaire section.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 3\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n88 http://www.demographic-research.org\nThe table shows that overall respondents interviewed twice in 2001 tend to be\nfairly consistent in their answers. Across all questionnaire sections, for both men and\nwomen there are no respondents with less than 40% of consistent answers.\nCorrespondingly, between 60% and 80% of the answers given by the greatest majority\nof respondents interviewed twice in 2001 are consistent. Only for questions on\npartnerships does the percentage of respondents in the first quintile exceed 10% of the\ntotal number of reinterviewed respondents; and only for questions on HIV/AIDS the\npercentage of individuals in the top quintile is close to zero. The lowest consistency is\ntherefore observed for the most sensitive questions, namely those on partnerships and\nIt can also be seen in Table 6 that the level of individual consistency exhibits\nsignificant differences by gender. Comparing the bottom, intermediate and top score\nquintiles, shows that males are less consistent than females in reporting about family\nplanning, gender and partnerships, but more consistent in reporting about children.\nHowever, when the data in Table 6 are graphed (Figure 1), the pattern of individual\nconsistency is quite similar for men and women, with the exception of questions on\nfamily planning, children and HIV/AIDS.\nTo compare individual consistency in rural Malawi with the results of other\nstudies, Table 7 presents the crude index of disagreement for selected survey items for\nMalawi together with those obtained from the WFS reinterview studies in Indonesia,\nPeru and Lesotho, and from the DHS reinterview study carried out in Pakistan. The\ncomparison is limited to women, since the indicated WFS and DHS did not sample\nmen. The table shows that the percentage of discrepant cases is equivalent in Malawi\nand in the other countries considered for family planning variables. Discrepant\nresponses on ages and dates of birth are fewer in Indonesia and in Malawi than in any\nother country, thus suggesting that a low level of female education and literacy in\nMalawi is not associated with poor date reporting, as it happens in Pakistan (Curtis and\nArnold 1994: 17). In contrast, reporting of dates of marriage in Malawi is worse only in\nPakistan. This is most likely due to the high marital mobility in Malawi (Reniers, this\nvolume) as compared to the other countries considered, which is supported by the fact\nthat the percentage of discrepant cases on current marital status and number of times\nmarried is consistently higher in Malawi than in the other studies. Finally, the reporting\non the number of children ever born tends to be worse in Malawi, although the\nreporting on the number of living children is identical in Malawi and in Pakistan. This\nsuggests that underreporting of dead children might be particularly serious in Malawi.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 3\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 89\n------------------ Males - - - - - - - - Females\nFigure 1: Percentage distribution of reinterviewed respondents by consistency\nscore quintile, sex and questionnaire section\nEco no mic questio ns\nQuintile\nB ackground questio ns\nQuintile\nQuestio ns abo ut children\nQuintile\nGender questio ns\nQuintile\nQuestio ns o n family planning\nQuintile\nP artnerships questio ns\nQuintile\nHIV/A IDS questio ns\nQuintile\nA ll questio ns\nQuintile\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 3\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n90 http://www.demographic-research.org\nTable 7: Percentages of women with inconsistent answers to the indicated\nquestions for Malawi, Indonesia, Peru, Lesotho and Pakistan\nMalawi Indonesia Peru Lesotho Pakistan\nAge and dates\nChildren\nMarital status\nFamily Planning\n* Refers to responses on current age.\n3.2 Consistency in reporting on HIV/AIDS\nThe crude index of disagreement for questions on HIV/AIDS is presented in Table 8. It\ncan first be noticed that individual inconsistency is always higher for females than for\nmales, with the exception of two questions. However, the pattern of inconsistencies is\nsimilar for both sexes. Questions on the respondent's sources of information about\nAIDS (clinic/radio) are the most reliable, with more than 95 per cent of respondents\nanswering they had heard about AIDS from at least one of these sources. Respondents\nare also highly consistent in responding to the question on whether they think a healthy-\nlooking person can be infected with AIDS. The percentage of inconsistent responses is\nhighest for questions about the respondent's own chance of being currently infected\nwith AIDS, or becoming infected in the future. For both sexes, the main cause for the\nhigh inconsistency rate is the shift of \"don't know\" answers to \"no likelihood\" or \"some\nlikelihood\" answers in the reinterview (not shown). Since there is no evidence that the\ninterviewers were better trained in the reinterview survey, it is difficult to interpret this\nresult. The percentage of respondents with discrepant responses on worry about getting\nAIDS is also high. The inconsistencies are mostly due to the fact that, in the\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 3\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 91\nreinterview, respondents' worry changes towards more extreme categories; those who\nwere worried a little move towards being not worried at all or worried a lot (not shown).\nThis trend to extremes parallels that of the question on becoming infected with AIDS in\nthe future, and it is difficult to interpret since there is no systematic tendency for the\nrespondents in the aggregate to be more (or less) worried in the reinterview. Finally,\nmen are more consistent than women in answering whether STDs increase chances of\ngetting AIDS, and whether it is acceptable to use a condom with the spouse. In Section\n5, the implications of these discrepancies for the aggregate distribution of the survey\nitems considered are discussed.\nTable 8: Percentage of respondents with discrepant responses on HIV/AIDS, by\nsex\nMales Females\nSources of information on AIDS\n- Ever heard at clinic about AIDS 7.9 9.4\n- Ever heard from radio about AIDS* 0.0 6.3\nCan get AIDS from healthy-looking person** 5.3 14.6\nChances of getting AIDS\nSafe sex\n** Question asked in DHS-III core questionnaire.\n4. Covariates of individual consistency\nTo identify covariates of individual consistency net of the bias introduced by the choice\nof the relevant individual characteristics to include for the analysis (those reported in\nthe first interview, rather than in the reinterview), I focus on three variables independent\nof the choice of the relevant interview: the reinterview period, individual item non-\nresponse, and the questions' content (if the question asks the respondents to report\nabout themselves or about third parties).\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 3\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n92 http://www.demographic-research.org\nFor both males and females, the length of the reinterview period does not seem to\nbe an important covariate of individual consistency. Indeed, the average consistency\nscore does not vary much with the length of the reinterview period (Table 9a), and the\nindividual scores of most reinterviewed respondents fall into the fourth quintile,\nregardless of the reinterview period (Table 9b).\nTable 9a: Average consistency score (and standard deviation) of reinterviewed\nrespondents, by length of re-interview period and sex\nMales Females\nLength of re-interview period Mean SD N Mean SD N\nTable 9b: Percentage distribution of reinterviewed respondents by consistency\nscore quintile, sex and re-interview period\nLength of re-\ninterview period\nFirst\nQuintile\nSecond\nQuintile\nThird\nQuintile\nFourth\nQuintile\nFifth\nQuintile\nFirst\nQuintile\nSecond\nQuintile\nThird\nQuintile\nFourth\nQuintile\nFifth\nQuintile\nItem non-response differs between reinterviewed respondents and respondents\ninterviewed only once in 2001, although item non-response is overall quite low (less\nthan 1%, Note 16). Reinterviewed respondents (and, especially, females) give in fact\nless complete answers than respondents interviewed only once in 2001 (Table 10).\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 3\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 93\nTable 10: Pattern of nonresponse for respondents interviewed once and twice in\nInterviewed once Interviewed twice in 2001\nin 2001 Main Interview Duplicate Interview\nMales\nFemales\nNote. The percentages illustrate above are standardized for the number of respondents with whom a complete interview was carried\nout and the number of questions within each section (or in the whole questionnaire).\nOn the one hand, this might be due to a genuine difference in non-response, and\nthus ultimately be related to the different willingness of respondents to answer the\nquestions a second time. If this is the case, non-response should be associated with\nindividual inconsistency. On the other hand, the observed differences in non-response\nmight be random, or be generated by the different effectiveness of the checking of\nquestionnaires for errors that was done in the field. In this case, non-response should\nshow no association with individual consistency. A close analysis reveals that the first\nhypothesis is the correct one (Table 11). The greatest percentage of inconsistent\nanswers (between 20 and 40%) is, in fact, concentrated among respondents with less\nthan 2% of missing answers in main and/or duplicate interview--these percentage of\nmissing answers being the highest recorded in the sample (see Table 10). Item non-\nresponse it thus an importance covariate of individual consistency.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 3\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n94 http://www.demographic-research.org\nTable 11: Percentage distribution of inconsistent answers, by number of missing\nanswers in main survey and reinterview\nMales\n% of inconsistent answers % of inconsistent answers\n% of answers missing\nin main interview:\n% of answers missing in\nreinterview\nFemales\n% of inconsistent answers % of inconsistent answers\n% of answers missing\nin main interview:\n% of answers missing in\nreinterview\nIn the Malawi 2 questionnaire respondents were asked questions about their best\nfriends' extramarital relationships, use of family planning and worry about AIDS. In\norder to assess if respondents tend to be more consistent in reports about their own\ncharacteristics rather than others' characteristics, I focus on a set of three fixed-coded\nquestions about extramarital relationships and worry of AIDS that were asked to each\nrespondent, with the same wording, in reference to themselves and their best married\nAs can be seen in Table 12, the questions' content is an important covariate of\nindividual consistency. When reinterviewed, more than 90% of respondents provide the\nsame answer when questioned whether or not they had an extramarital relationship;\nwhereas only 60% of females and 32% of males provides the same answer when\nquestioned whether or not their best married friend had an extramarital relationship. In\naddition, more males than females assess consistently their own and their best married\nfriend's chance of being infected with AIDS; although overall consistency about the\npresent and future chance of being infected with AIDS is quite low (as discussed\nearlier). Lower consistency in reporting about others can be related to the fact that the\n\"best married\" friend identified in the two interviews was different; or to the fact that\nthe respondents are genuinely uncertain about the AIDS worry of their friends.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 3\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 95\nTable 12: Percentages of reinterviewed respondents who gave the same answer to\nthe indicated questions, by sex\nMales Females\nQuestions about best married friend:\nHas he/she had sex with anyone other than her husband/his wife in the last 12\nmonths?\nWhat does he/she think is the likelihood (chance) that he/she is infected with\nWhat does he/she think is the likelihood (chance) that he/she will become infected\nwith AIDS in the future?\nQuestions about self:\nHave you yourself slept with anyone other than your wife/husband in the last 12\nmonths?\nIn your opinion, what is the likelihood (chance) that you are infected with HIV/AIDS\nnow?\nIn your opinion, what is the likelihood (chance) that you will become infected with\nAIDS in the future?\n5. Implications of individual inconsistency for data analysis\nEven if most Malawi 2 reinterviewed respondents are consistent in their answers,\nwhat are the implications of inconsistency for the conclusions that can be drawn from\nthe data? In order to answer this question, I focus on reporting of selected outcome and\ncontrol variables. I begin with univariate comparisons of distributions and means. Then,\nI also test whether multivariate regression coefficients are affected by the degree of\nconsistency in the duplicate interview.\n5.1 Comparison of distributions and means for selected outcome and control\nvariables\nFor respondent's age, number of children ever born and age at first sex intercourse, the\ncomparison of reports given in the main and the duplicate interview presented in Figure\n2 shows that the difference in the selected characteristics is very symmetrical around\nthe central peak: this suggests that, if there is misreporting, it is random rather than\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 3\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n96 http://www.demographic-research.org\nFigure 2: Comparison of distributions for selected survey items between\nreinterview and main survey, Males\n%\nDifference in age (Reinterview Survey - Main Survey)\nPercentage distribution of matched men by difference in reported\nage between reinterview survey and main survey\n%\nDifference in number of children ever born (Reinterview Survey - Main Survey)\nPercentage distribution of matched men by difference in reported numbe\nof children between reinterview survey and main survey\n%\nDifference in age at first sex (Reinterview Survey - Main Survey)\nPercentage distribution of matched men by difference in reported age a\nfirst sex between reinterview survey and main survey\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 3\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 97\nFigure 2: Continued, Females\n%\nDifference in age (Reinterview Survey - Main Survey)\nPercentage distribution of matched women by difference in reported\nage between reinterview survey and main survey\n%\nDifference in number of children ever born (Reinterview Survey - Main Survey)\nPercentage distribution of matched women by difference in reported\nnumber of children between reinterview survey and main survey\n%\nDifference in age at first sex (Reinterview Survey - Main Survey)\nPercentage distribution of matched women by difference in reported ag\nat first sex between reinterview survey and main survey\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 3\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n98 http://www.demographic-research.org\nIn addition, the means of the control variables whose distribution is graphed in\nFigure 2 do not differ significantly between the main survey and the reinterview (Table\n13). The same consideration applies to the means of all other variables considered in\nTable 13 with the exception of some questions on HIV/AIDS, which, for females, differ\nsignificantly between the main interview and the reinterview. These questions are those\nfor which the percentage of inconsistent responses is highest (see Table 8).\nTable 13: Difference in means for selected control and outcome variables between\nmain survey and reinterview, by sex of the respondent*\nMales Females\nMain\ninterview\nReinterview\nDifference\n(M-R)\nMain\ninterview\nReinterview\nDifference\n(M-R)\nControl variables\nEducation\nHousehold characteristics\nOutcome variables\nChances you have AIDS now\nChances you will get AIDS\nWorry to get AIDS\n* Standard deviations (for means) and two-sample t-tests with unequal variances (for differences) in parentheses.\nNotes: * indicates significance at the 10 percent level, ** at the 5 percent level, and *** at the 1 percent level.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 3\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 99\n5.2 Effects on multivariate regression coefficients\nTo test whether multivariate regression coefficients are affected by inconsistency I\nconducted a series of BGLW tests, in which the value of an outcome variable in the\nmain survey was regressed on predetermined control variables for the main survey and\nindividual inconsistency on the outcome variable considered (Note 18). In other terms,\nthe test is whether the slope coefficients of the outcome variable and the constant differ\nwhen the value of the outcome variable is reported inconsistently between the main\ninterview and the reinterview (Note 19). The analysis is limited to women, since the\nmain aim is to investigate whether the univariate difference in means observed above\n(see Table 13) is associated with significant difference in multivariate estimates.\nTable 14: Multivariate probits and OLS regressions for testing impact of\ninconsistency on three outcome variables, Women*\nProbits OLS regression\nControl variables\nCurrently using\ncontraceptives\nWorried of getting\nAIDS\nNumber of surviving\nchildren\nEducation (relative to none)\nHousehold characteristics\n[prob > 2]\n[probability > F]\n2 test for joint effect of\ninconsistency on [prob > 2]:\n*Values of t-tests (for regressions) and z-tests (for probits) are in parentheses beneath the point estimates.\nNotes: * indicates significance at the 10 percent level, ** at the 5 percent level, and *** at the 1 percent level.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 3\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n100 http://www.demographic-research.org\nMultivariate probits and OLS regressions for testing impact of inconsistency on\ncurrently using contraceptives, being worried of getting AIDS and the number of\nchildren surviving are displayed in Table 14. It can be noticed that no BGLW test is\nsignificant: individual inconsistency on the outcome variable of interest does not bias\nmultivariate regression coefficients for the variables considered.\n6. Conclusion\nThere is considerable consistency in the answers of the respondents interviewed twice\nin the 2001 Malawi Diffusion and Ideational Change Project: for most of them, between\n60% and 80% of their responses are consistent. Consistency shows significant\ndifferences by gender: males are less consistent than females in reporting about family\nplanning, gender and partnerships, but they are more consistent in reporting about\nchildren.\nThe level of inconsistencies found in Malawi for family planning variables is\nwithin the same range of that calculated by other reinterview studies in developing\ncountries. In addition, discrepancies on ages and dates of birth suggest that a low level\nof female education and literacy in Malawi is not associated with poor date reporting in\nMalawi 2, as it happens in other cases (such as in the Pakistan DHS). However,\ninconsistency in reporting of dates of marriage is more serious for Malawi 2 than for\nother studies, which is most likely due to higher marital mobility in Malawi.\nIn the Malawi 2 reinterview data, the lowest consistency is observed for the most\nsensitive questions, namely those on HIV/AIDS. The percentage of inconsistent\nresponses is highest for questions about the respondent's own chance of being currently\ninfected with AIDS or becoming infected in the future, and the question on\nrespondent's worry of getting AIDS. Individual inconsistency is always higher for\nfemales than for males, but the pattern of inconsistencies is similar for both sexes.\nSeveral of the AIDS questions were taken from the core questionnaire of the DHS,\nwhich have been asked in many African countries. Although to my knowledge the DHS\nhas not conducted reinterview studies to evaluate the consistency of these questions, the\nresults of the present analysis suggest that analysts of AIDS questions in the DHS need\nto be cautious in the interpretation of their descriptive results (especially for females).\nClearly, consistency cannot be taken as a guarantee of accuracy (to give answers\nthat reflect the \"true\" value of a certain variable), because stereotypical responses and\nintentional misstatements could be repeated, and because some individuals who gave\nconsistent reports may have remembered the answers they gave in the first interview\n(Knodel and Piampiti 1977:55). The latter possibility can reasonably be excluded,\nhowever, since the length of the reinterview period is virtually uncorrelated with\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 3\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 101\nindividual consistency. In the majority of cases, respondents are inconsistent on\nquestions they are probably genuinely ambivalent or anxious about, or for which they\ndo not have a firm answer: for example, sensitive questions and reports about\ncharacteristics of others. In addition, only a small percentage of inconsistent individuals\n(less than 2%) show also higher item non-response, or a lower willingness to answer the\nquestions altogether.\nAn important results of the analysis presented in this paper is that inconsistency\ndoes not affect the conclusions that can be drawn from the survey data, since: (a) the\ndistribution and means of a number of outcome and control variables do not differ\nsignificantly between the main interview and the reinterview, with the exception of\nsome questions on HIV/AIDS for which the percentage of discrepant responses is\nhighest; and (b) even when the means differ, the coefficients estimates for standard\nfamily background variables in regression and probit equations are not biased by\nindividual inconsistency.\n7.
