In addition, more than\nhalf of the breast cancer deaths in the state occur in for\nDallas\u00adFort Worth area, San Antonio, and Houston (Harris\nCounty). This highlights the disparities in urban locations,\nrather than rural, within the state (CPRIT, 2010). As noted by\nage-adjusted incidence rate of breast cancer was 1.16 times\nhigher among non-Hispanic White women in Harris County,\ncompared with African Americans. However, the age-\nadjusted mortality rate was nearly 1.7 times higher among\nAfrican American women in the county, compared to their\nWhite counterparts.\nThe Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)\ndata in 2010 noted among those completing the questionnaire\nacross the state, approximately 74% of African American\nwomen aged 40 and above stated they had a mammogram\nwithin the past 2 years (Center for Health Statistics [CHS],\ntaking into account the level of income only, all women making\nrange (CHS, 2010). Based on these statistics and the historical\nmarginalization of African American women in society and\nthere is a need to address the cultural nuances (i.e., traditions,\nhistory, language) of African American women.\nAfrican American Women and Cultural\nCompetence\nIn the context of race and ethnicity stratification, it is impor-\ntant to address the cultural nuances for not only African\nAmericans, but for all people of color through the employment\n1East Carolina University, Greenville, NC, USA\n2Texas A&M University, College Station, USA\n3Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA\n4Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, TX, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nMarla B.

In health care settings, cultural\ncompetence is defined as the ability of systems to provide care\nto patients with diverse values, beliefs, and behaviors\n(Betancourt et al., 2005). This includes tailoring delivery to\nmeet patients' social, cultural, and linguistic needs. Cultural\ncompetence is both a vehicle to increase access to quality care\nfor all patients and as a business strategy to attract new patients\nthrough effective communication (Betancourt et al., 2005).\nCulture influences the community's views toward health, pov-\nerty, welfare, crime, and other social and human services\nareas, in addition to outcomes of public agency services and\ninterventions (Rice, 2007). Understanding these concepts\nenables public service delivery providers to avoid stereotypes\nand biases, as well as promote positive characteristics of par-\nIn addition, the notion of trust is also a factor in the delivery\nof health services. Researchers conducted telephone surveys\nto explore the correlation between preventive health service\nengagement and trust in the competence of physicians' care\n(Musa, Schulz, Harris, Silverman, & Thomas, 2009). African\nAmericans reported being less trustful of their physician com-\npared with Whites. Subsequently, this lack of trust was associ-\nated with decreased adherence to routine examinations,\nincluding mammograms (Musa et al., 2009). It was also deter-\nmined that an individual's level of distrust of the health care\nsystem can be used to predict her breast cancer screening\nschedule adherence (Katapodi, Pierce, & Facione, 2010).\nResearch suggests cultural competence training directly\naffects the attitudes of health care providers (Beach et al.,\n2005). Organizations and institutions have addressed this by\nproviding academic course instruction to students and\nemployer-sponsored training for practitioners (Hall, Guidry,\nMcKyer, Outley, & Ballard, 2014). Improving patient\u00adpro-\nvider communication may eliminate the disconnect between\nthe two, thus improving health outcomes. Although there has\nbeen extensive review and subsequent recommendations\noffered for the development of a universal, interdisciplinary\ncurriculum to build the capacity of providers, there is not a\nconsensus on the approach (Smith et al., 2007). The purpose\nof this research study was to understand African American\nwomen's perceptions of health care providers' delivery of\nculturally competent services, and how delivery contributes\nto barriers to and receipt of mammograms. The information\nobtained can be used to develop a comprehensive curriculum\nfor those working in the health care field and providing care\nto African American women in this region.\nTheoretical/Conceptual Framework\nFor this study, researchers used the PEN-3 model. Introduced\nas an alternative to the traditional medical model, it is based on\nvarious components, including reasoned action, PRECEDE,\nand health belief models (Airhihenbuwa, 1995). Its premise is\nto identify and address individual, family, community, and\nsystemic influential factors of health behavior modification\n(Ka'Opua, 2008). Regarding intervention development, the\nframework identifies and organizes the cultural components of\nthe target population within the planning phase to ensure\neffectiveness (Cowdery, Parker, & Thompson, 2012).\nThe model is composed of three dimensions: cultural\nidentity, cultural empowerment, and relationships and expec-\ntations. Cultural identity focuses on the person, the extended\nfamily, and the neighborhood. Cultural empowerment\nexplores beliefs about health that are positive, existential, or\nnegative in nature (Iwelunmor, Newsome, & Airhihenbuwa,\n2014). The final dimension of relationships and expectations\ninvolves three variables, which are perceptions, enablers,\nPEN-3 model is highly applicable to specific populations,\nparticularly to subgroups within the African American com-\nmunity (Airhihenbuwa, 1995). Research indicates that the\nPEN-3 model has been used to explore the cultural and com-\nmunity-related impact on African Americans' food choices,\ndietary intake, and nutritional attitudes (James, 2004).\nSuccessful outcomes of this effort included the development\nof effective components of nutrition education programs and\nhealth communication strategies (James, 2004). The PEN-3\nmodel was also used to address cultural issues related to psy-\nchosocial barriers and factors of prostate cancer screening\n(Abernethy et al., 2005). The findings from these studies\nsuggested building partnerships with the community in\nhealth promotion efforts is a key factor of recruitment and\nsubsequent behavior adoption (Abernethy et al., 2005).\nResearchers also have incorporated dimensions of PEN-3\nmodel to adapt breast cancer education materials to achieve\nthe inclusion of culturally sensitive messages focusing on\nmedical mistrust, self-reliance, spirituality, and community\ninfluences (Kline, 2007). However, a systematic review of\nthe application of the PEN-3 model revealed there are very\nfew studies aimed at breast cancer in minority women that\nincorporate all dimensions of the PEN-3 model (Iwelunmor\net al., 2014). Within the current study, the relationships and\nexpectations dimension was utilized to assess the lack of cul-\nturally relevant/appropriate services and improve health\ncommunication, as well as messaging. In turn, this will facil-\nitate the efforts of developing a supportive health care envi-\nronment conducive to increasing healthy outcomes for\nminority populations.\nSimilarly, Sheppard et al. (2010) explored the relation-\nships and expectations dimension of the PEN-3 model in\ndeveloping a decision\u00adsupport intervention for African\nAmerican breast cancer survivors. The findings assisted in\nthe development of strategies to promote improved patient\u00ad\nprovider communication. In addition, the dimension has\nguided studies conducted through focus groups and in-depth\ninterviews among Latinas to create culturally competent\nbreast and cervical cancer screening programs, and treatment\nHall et al. 3\ndecision making (Erwin, Johnson, Feliciano-Libid, Zamora,\nThe current study sought to expand on the utilization of\nthis culturally appropriate research model to assist with pro-\ngram development, designed specifically for African\nAmerican women in Harris County, Texas. As indicative of\ntrue community-based participatory research strategies,\nresearchers must actively seek information to gain insights\nregarding the cultural, demographic, and geographic nuances\nof those targeted for health interventions/programs. By doing\nthis, the likelihood of an increase in healthful outcomes and\nlifestyle change is strengthened (Horowitz, Robinson, &\nMaterials and Method\nParticipants\nStudy inclusion criteria included: (a) female, (b) between 35\nand 65 years of age, (c) current resident of Harris County, (d)\nself-identified African American, (e) English speaker, and (f)\nno previous history of cancer. There were a total of six focus\ngroups conducted with 61 African American women across\nthe Houston/Harris County, Texas area.\nRecruitment\nTo recruit participants, researchers first identified regions of\nlarge proportions of African American persons that were\nwithin a 10-mile radius of each service center. This included\n145 grocery stores, local community centers, multiservice,\nchurches, centers, shopping centers, hair salons, and restau-\nrants. At each location, significant efforts were made to per-\nsonally interact with potential participants, or with any\nperson willing to speak with the designated staffer. Personal\ninteraction included, as often as possible, matching the\nracial/ethnic identity of the staffer with the potential partici-\npant. The staffer then would greet the person, introduce him\nor herself, and proceed to hand the person a flyer which\nincluded focus group information and begin to inform them\nof the study purpose. Questions were answered immediately\nif the person had any, and if they were interested in partici-\npating, the person's name and phone number were collected\nfor follow-up.\nWhen personal interaction was not appropriate, allowed,\nor available, a flyer was left on cars, in windows, on tables,\nor wherever the establishment would allow us to leave them.\nAt the end of each recruitment activity, all interested parties'\nnames and contact information were placed in an Excel file\non an institution-provided, encrypted, password-protected\ncomputer. Follow-up calls to potential participants would\nbegin at least 48 hrs before the scheduled date of the focus\ngroup. In the event contact was not made, follow-up would\ncontinue until 3 hrs prior to the starting time.\nProcedure\nOf the 11 available multiservice centers, all were contacted,\nbut due to scheduling conflicts, closings due to construction,\nand available space constraints, 5 city service centers were\navailable to host the focus groups. An additional sixth loca-\ntion was included to better accommodate potential partici-\npants in the far northwest locations of the county. One focus\ngroup was conducted at each location. These locations were\nselected because they are representative of the geographic\ndistricts within the city/county. Due to the high population,\nresearchers sought to maximize the variety of representation\namong the target population by offering the assessments in\neasily accessible settings within close residential proximity.\nThere were a total of six facilitators, with one being\nassigned to each focus group. The background of the facilita-\ntors included graduate training in public health, health\nadministration, health care management, and social work.\nAll facilitators participated in a single training session to\nfamiliarize them with the focus group facilitator guide and\nappropriate facilitation techniques.\nAt the beginning of every focus group, all attendees were\nreminded that participation in the focus group was strictly\nvoluntary and they could choose not to continue participating\nat any time. Participants were then walked through the\ninformed consent process, which included a few designated\nminutes for the focus group facilitator to read aloud the con-\nsent documentation and to answer any questions. Afterward,\nadditional time was allotted to allow participants to reread the\ndocumentation for themselves and to ask the facilitator any\nadditional questions privately. Once participants were ade-\nquately informed and felt comfortable consenting to partici-\npate in the focus group, they were then asked to complete a\nbasic demographic questionnaire. Participants were also\ninformed they would receive a US$25 gift card to a national\ndepartment store chain for participating in the focus group.\nEach focus group was recorded with a digital recorder.\nParticipants were instructed to not use their names at any time\nduring the focus group to further ensure anonymity. The\nresearch was approved by the Institutional Review Board of\nthe University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.\nInterview Guide\nTo guide the focus group and to ensure consistency and accu-\nracy between the different groups, each facilitator utilized a\ndesignated interview guide. Each focus group ranged between\n60 and 90 mins, in which the African American women were\nasked about their understanding and beliefs of breast cancer\nhealth and perceptions toward breast cancer services. More\nspecifically, the women were asked to address their (a) knowl-\nedge of breast health (e.g., need for routine breast cancer\nexaminations through the combination of self-examinations\nand doctor examinations), (b) availability and accessibility of\nbreast health services (e.g., ideal locations to receive\n4 SAGE Open\na mammogram; health services info dissemination), and (c)\nutilization of breast health services (e.g., understanding how\nbreast health services could be utilized more effectively; bar-\nriers to service). These areas included specific questions such\nas the following: (a) \"What would be the most effective way\nto let African American women know about breast cancer and\navailable breast health services?\", (b) \"What are some ways\nthat we may be able to reduce some of the barriers/challenges\nthat African American women face to getting a mammo-\ngram?\" and (c) \"Why do you think some African American\nwomen go for mammograms and why some do not?\". The\ninformation provided was indicative of research-based, cul-\nture-based, and individual experiential knowledge that incor-\nporates the components of the PEN-3 framework.\nData Analysis\nEach of the focus groups were transcribed verbatim. Following\nthis, and to avoid researcher biases, a team of three researchers\nindependently analyzed, categorized, and coded participants'\nresponses into themes utilizing inductive\u00addeductive content\nanalysis method (Strauss & Corbin, 1990). Inductive analysis\nallowed the researchers to immerse themselves in the tran-\nscripts and determine relevant themes, whereas deductive\nanalysis allowed the researchers to explore the categories\nbased on the theoretical components of the PEN-3 model.\nNVivo qualitative analysis computer software enabled this\nprocess. Specifically, key participant responses were selected\nand given a color code using the software (McIlfatrick,\nTaggart, & Truesdale-Kennedy, 2011). Codes were then gath-\nered into specific themes and analyzed individually. On com-\npletion, researchers came together to compare and contrast\nanalyses and determine final categories and themes.\nResults\nFrom the demographic questionnaire, it was determined the\naverage age of the women in the focus groups was approxi-\ncees with an average number of 2 children. Thirteen percent\nof the participants (n = 8) had a high school diploma or gen-\neral educational development (GED) certificate, and 15%\n(n = 9) reported having vocational training after high school\ncompletion. Forty-one percent (n = 25) had some college or\nan associate's degree, 13% (n = 8) had a baccalaureate\ndegree, and 2% (n = 1) reported completing a master's pro-\ngram. Fifty-one percent of the women (n = 31) were unem-\nployed, yet 38% (n = 23) reported having private insurance,\nand 43% (n = 26) reported an annual income of less than\nreported not having a family history of breast cancer, with\n79% (n = 48) having ever received a mammogram.\nThe purpose of this research study was to understand\nAfrican American women's perceptions of health care pro-\nviders' delivery of culturally competent services, and how\ndelivery contributes to barriers to and receipt of mammo-\ngrams. Through the focus groups, the 61 African American\nwomen articulated their perceptions and experiences with\nhealth care workers. The findings revealed perceptions of the\n(a) interactions with clinicians, (b) attitudes of insensitivity\nby the physicians and nurse practitioners, and (c) inequitable\ntreatment for sickness and diseases.\nTherefore, the women revealed that prior to an interaction\nwith a clinician,AfricanAmerican women are intimidated by\nclerical workers' perceived indignant attitudes and lack of\nrespect toward them. This initial interaction sets the tone for\nthe entire visit, often times hindering communication efforts\nand return for services (Kaplan et al., 2006).\nThey are intimidated by the people who initiated the services.\nThey don't necessarily get into the doctor's office being\nintimidated; it is the people before you get in the door. It is the\nattitude of the service care providers that turn away a lot of the\npeople that come that use a lot of energy. They take the time to\neither car-ride with someone, and pay that person and then to\nfind a way back and then they get there and they get this person\nwith an attitude, you know? As if you are nobody.\nIt is when they are trying to get the application, trying to get the\ninformation, trying to say why you are there. The person is telling\nyou what they want to tell you and it is kind of indignant . . .\nWhen I first started coming over here to the Health Center, I\nneeded a mammogram, I just almost fought with the lady over\nthere, from that day on I promised myself: \"I'm never going to a\ncity health clinic again.\" And I've never been back in there,\nbecause they act around like they have authority over there; they\nact like it is their building, as a matter of fact, the whole system\nhas got a problem with the attitude. It does not matter how poor\nyou are or what you got 'cuz we don't know what the people that\nwork there have either. But they still need to respect the people\nthat come here.\nBased on the responses, the participants' initial interac-\ntions consisted of negative attitudes in the form of intimida-\ntion, confrontation, and indignant/offensive treatment by\nclerical staff at the clinics and personnel who work with\npatients (e.g., facilitating transportation, completion of patient\napplications). The negative attitudes affected the participants\nand situated their perception of future interactions with the\nclinic and its personnel (e.g., nurse practitioner, physician).\nAlthough the initial interactions set the tone for future vis-\nits to the clinician, some of the women experienced similar\ninteractions with the primary physician/clinician and the\nnurse practitioner. As such, the issue of physician and nurse\ninsensitivity was also raised during the discussion. The par-\nticipants noted their discontent with the clinicians' and nurse\npractitioners' insensitivity that consisted of a perceived lack\nof warmth and care.\nWell you asked me if the doctors were not paying attention, they\nneed to be more professional. Not only the doctors and the staff,\nHall et al. 5\nthe nurses, you know some people are very insensitive and make\nus feel, you know, less than what we are, you know. Because I'm\ncoming here to you, I am putting my life in your hands, if I can't\ncommunicate with you and you just throw me off.\n. . . he started not listening but like he didn't really want to touch\nme. And the worst thing that he did was do a, I let him do a well\nwoman's Pap one time. Then I said to myself I won't ever, ever\ncome back to another man doctor first of all and especially a\nwhite doctor because he was not sensitive at all.\nThe participants conveyed that the clinicians' (e.g., doc-\ntors, physicians) and nurses' perceived lack of warmth and\ncare was based on their inability to communicate in a \"pro-\nfessional\" manner. One participant conveyed the signifi-\ncance of her interaction as it pertained to her \"putting my life\nin your hands,\" and thus, felt a certain level of sensitivity was\nnecessary for diagnosis and effective communication\nbetween her, the clinician, and nurse practitioner. Although\nanother participant conveyed poor verbal communication\nwas received, the non-verbal communication was perceived\nas more insensitive. This participant's physical interaction\nwith the physician was negatively perceived when she felt\nthat \"he didn't really want to touch me\" during her intimate\nand invasive examination. Therefore, verbal and non-verbal\ncommunications are both deemed important to these partici-\npants during the doctor\u00adpatient interactions.\nThe interactions and perceived attitudes contributed to the\nfinal area of concern for these participants. Through the\nfocus groups, the participants conveyed their beliefs that the\nclinicians were not providing equitable treatment for all\ngroups of patients due to a lack of treating sickness and dis-\neases within the African American community.\nI don't trust them because I believe that they are not treating\nAfrican Americans aggressively with sickness and disease as\nthey do with the white people and there are a lot of the seniors\nwho distrust them. I can name a group of people that are right in\nthis area, y'all would know who they are, and they said they let\nthem cut them or experiment on them, because I believe that is\nhappening, these woman with fibroids and they are allowing\nthose things to grow in these women.\nThey let it get out of whack. They are letting things grow on\nwomen. But I find that a lot of minorities are going through . . .\nbecause it is not aggressively addressed while that person is\ngoing to the doctor, it is not.And people have just stopped going.\nThe culminating affect of the perceived lack of treating\nAfrican Americans who are sick or stricken with diseases\nfueled one participant's sense of mistrust and willingness to\nconsult with a physician for future health concerns and/or to\nadhere to health screening recommendations, while another\nparticipant presented that African Americans, and other peo-\nple of color, are experiencing similar levels of treatment or\nnon-treatment. She concludes that the low levels of treatment\nor non-treatment cultivate an environment in which African\nAmericans choose not to go to doctors.\nDiscussion\nThis article proposed to examine the influence of perceived\nhealth professionals' cultural competence on barriers to and\nreceipt of mammograms among African American women.\nUsing the relationships and expectations dimension of the\nPEN-3 model was highly applicable in examining the influ-\nential factors associated with the health care system in mam-\nmography adherence choices. Again, this dimension\nencompasses three variables to include perceptions, enablers,\nand nurturers. The findings revealed that (a) African\nAmerican women's perceptions reaffirmed notions of his-\ntorical mistrust, (b) lack of sensitivity and respect by person-\nnel acted as a negative enabler of health care services\nutilization decision making, and (c) health care providers and\nstaff can act as nurturers in this setting, enabling screening\nand follow-up adherence.\nThe perception variable asserts that culturally influenced\nattitudes and beliefs can either encourage or impede healthy\nbehaviors (Abernethy et al., 2005). Hence, the noted percep-\ntion among focus group participants included medical mis-\ntrust due to lack of respect from medical professionals. This\ncould be contributed to sociodemographic factors such as\nsocioeconomic status, educational attainment, and health lit-\neracy (Davis, Bynum, Katz, Buchanan, & Green, 2012). For\nexample, the perception that medical practitioners do not\nwant to touch the participants may be a derivative of per-\nsonal and cultural preconceptions about how people of color\nwith low social class status address personal hygiene or other\nhealth-related care. Concomitantly, other factors contribut-\ning to participant perceptions could consist of the experience\nand tenure of medical professionals. Medical professionals\nwho are nervous working with the underserved populations\n(i.e., people of color, low income) and/or are new in their\ncareers and lack experience interacting with these individu-\nals may exhibit behaviors (i.e., verbal, non-verbal) that could\nbe viewed as intentional. The verbal and non-verbal behavior\ncommunication cues act as negative enablers of health infor-\nmation and treatment seeking among underserved popula-\ntions (Perloff, Bonder, Ray, Ray, & Siminoff, 2006).\nThe findings illuminated how medical professionals'\nbehaviors could act as enablers. Enablers are positive or\nnegative systematic, social, and/or cultural forces, which\ninfluence health behaviors (Abernethy et al., 2005). Thus,\nthe voices of the participants conveyed that improvement,\nperhaps in the forms of education and training, could aid\nmedical professionals with culturally competent knowledge,\nunderstanding, and interactions. Such improvements may\nmodify the cultural perceptions of underserved populations\nand could diminish distrust for the medical system (Hall,\nGuidry, McKyer, Outley, & Ballard, 2013). This can be\nachieved through organization-led continuing education to\nimprove effectiveness in working with diverse patients (Hall\net al., 2013). Failure to address cultural incompetence of\nmedical professionals can result in decreased utilization of\nmedical and health care services, thereby contributing to\n6 SAGE Open\nhealth inequities and disparities among minority popula-\nSecond, because of the strong spiritual foundation men-\ntioned by the focus group participants, medical practitioners\nand researchers should partner with faith-based organiza-\ntions, to act as nurturing settings to implement education and\ncultural awareness strategies to promote beneficial interac-\ntions (Abernethy et al., 2005). The variable of nurturing is\ndefined as members of one's social network who assist in\nmediating health behaviors, beliefs, and attitudes (Abernethy\net al., 2005). Thus, faith-based organizations, such as\nchurches, are beneficial sites or safe spaces (Collins, 2000)\nfor conducting interventions with underserved populations to\nbuild their capacity to effectively communicate with medical\nprofessionals for health information and treatment seeking\n(Matthews, Sellergren, Manfredi, & Williams, 2002). In\naddition, the findings suggested that health care providers\ncan act as nurturers in health settings by being sensitive to\nthe needs, questions, and concerns of patients.\nStrengths and Limitations\nThere are notable strengths of the study, which include\ndetailed recruitment and consent protocols, as well as find-\nings analysis incorporating evidence-based transcription and\ncoding methods. Although the research team proactively\naddressed potential barriers to data collection procedures,\nmore extensive and precise strategies of moderator training\nwill be implemented in future projects. These include evi-\ndence-based training materials addressing the avoidance of\ninterjecting personal opinions by moderators, as well as\napproaches to keep participants focused on the questions\nstated in the moderator guide. The research team will also\nconduct a series of mock focus groups with moderators to\nprovide them with application experience prior to data col-\nlection activities.\nConclusion\nConsistent with published research, focus group participants\nconveyed various negative experiences with health care pro-\nfessionals. These included insensitivity, lack of professional-\nism, and poor communication. Possessing compassion and\nbeing personable are qualities conducive to increasing health\nservices utilization and adherence to recommended guideline\nschedules within minority populations. As expressed within\nthe PEN-3 framework, this study adds to the literature of cul-\ntural exploration of influential factors of individual and com-\nmunity-based behavior modification needing to be addressed\nto ensure effective minority-focused program/intervention\nplanning and implementation activities.\n"
