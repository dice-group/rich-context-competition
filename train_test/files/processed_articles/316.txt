Our\npurpose was to determine whether the prevalence of this syndrome has changed since 1988\u00ad\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- A total of 6,436 men and women aged 20\nyears from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III (1988\u00ad1994)\ndefinition of the metabolic syndrome developed by the Third Report of the National Cholesterol\nEducation Program Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cho-\nlesterol in Adults.\nRESULTS -- The unadjusted prevalence of the metabolic syndrome was 23.1% in NHANES\ncircumference, and hypertriglyceridemia accounted for much of the increase in the prevalence of\nthe metabolic syndrome, particularly among women.\nCONCLUSIONS -- The increased prevalence of the metabolic syndrome is likely to lead to\nfuture increases in diabetes and cardiovascular disease.\ntional Cholesterol Education Program\nExpert Panel on Detection, Evaluation,\nand Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol\nin Adults (NCEP/ATP III) provided a\nworking definition of the metabolic syn-\ndrome based on five commonly measured\nclinical criteria that clinicians could im-\nplement in their practices (1). Using these\ncriteria, we estimated that the unadjusted\nprevalence of the metabolic syndrome\namong U.S. adults was 21.7% during\nlence of the metabolic syndrome using\nNCEP/ATP III criteria has been described\nfor other study populations. The preva-\nlence of the metabolic syndrome among\nparticipants of the Framingham Offspring\nStudy and San Antonio Heart Study\nhave been noted among patients infected\nwith the human immunodeficiency virus\n(4), Filipina women (5), and Native\nAmericans (6). In addition, the NCEP/\nATP III criteria have been applied in other\ncountries (7\u00ad9). Recent work has shown\nthat people with the metabolic syndrome\nbased on the NCEP/ATP III criteria are at\nincreased risk for diabetes and cardiovas-\nObesity and physical activity are two\nimportant determinants of the metabolic\nlence of obesity has continued to increase\ntheorized that the prevalence of the met-\nabolic syndrome among adults had in-\ncreased as well. To test this hypothesis,\nwe used data from two national surveys:\nthe National Health and Nutrition Exam-\nination Survey (NHANES) III and\nMETHODS -- According to the\nNCEP/ATP III report, participants who\nhad three or more of the following criteria\nwere defined as having the metabolic\nsyndrome: abdominal obesity: waist cir-\ncm in women; hypertriglyceridemia:\nmmHg; and high fasting glucose: 110\nmg/dl (6.1 mmol/l). Because a revision\nof the glucose criterion of the metabolic\nsyndrome was recently announced (18),\nwe also report the prevalence of the met-\nabolic syndrome using a glucose cut point\nwas recruited using a multistage stratified\nsampling design. Both surveys were spe-\ncifically designed to produce results that\nare representative of the civilian noninsti-\ntutionalized U.S. population. Participants\nwere interviewed at home and were in-\nvited to attend the mobile examination\ncenter, where they were asked to com-\nplete additional questionnaires, undergo\nvarious examinations, and provide a\nblood sample. Details about the surveys\nIn both surveys, the waist circumfer-\nence was measured at the high point of\nthe iliac crest at minimal respiration to the\nnearest 0.1 cm. Serum triglyceride con-\ncentration was measured enzymatically\n                                                \nFrom the Division of Adult and Community Health, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and\nHealth Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.\nAddress correspondence and reprint requests to Earl Ford, MD, MPH, Centers for Disease Control and\nAbbreviations: NCEP/ATP III, Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel\non Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults; NHANES, National Health\nand Nutrition Examination Survey.\nA table elsewhere in this issue shows conventional and Syste\n`me International (SI) units and conversion\nfactors for many substances.\n\u00a9 2004 by the American Diabetes Association.\nM e t a b o l i c S y n d r o m e / I n s u l i n R e s i s t a n c e S y n d r o m e / P r e - D i a b e t e s\nafter hydrolyzation to glycerol, and HDL\ncholesterol was measured after the pre-\ncipitation of other lipoproteins with a he-\nparin-manganese chloride mixture.\nPlasma glucose concentration was mea-\nsured using an enzymatic reaction.\nUp to three blood pressure readings\nwere obtained in the mobile examination\ncenter in NHANES III and up to four such\nmaintain consistency between the two\nsurveys, we used the average of the last\ntwo measurements of blood pressure for\nparticipants who had three or four mea-\nsurements, the last measurement for par-\nticipants with only two measurements,\nand the only measurement for partici-\npants who had one measurement to estab-\nlish high blood pressure status. For both\nsurveys, we counted participants who re-\nported currently using antihypertensive\nor antidiabetic medication (insulin or oral\nagents) as participants with high blood\npressure or diabetes, respectively. Be-\ncause of increases in the percentage of\nparticipants who reported using choles-\nterol-lowering medications between the\ntwo surveys (22) and because these med-\nications can also reduce triglyceride con-\ncentration, we calculated the prevalence\nof the metabolic syndrome using hyper-\ntriglyceridemia once based on serum tri-\nglyceride concentration alone and again\nbased on serum triglyceride concentra-\ntion or the use of cholesterol-lowering\nmedications.\nConcentrations of plasma glucose\nand serum triglycerides were measured\nusing reference analytic methods only for\nattended the morning examination.\nTherefore, we limited the analyses of both\nsurveys to men and nonpregnant women\naged 20 years who attended the morn-\ning medical examination and who had\nfasted 8 h. We calculated the prevalence\nof the metabolic syndrome by age and sex.\nBecause of the limited sample size for the\nracial or ethnic groups in NHANES\nthese subgroups. To age-adjust statistics,\nwe directly adjusted to the U.S. popula-\ntest the statistical significance of the\nchanges in the prevalence of the meta-\nbolic syndrome between the two surveys,\nwe performed a t test. The pooled stan-\ndard error for the difference in means was\ncalculated by taking the square root of the\nsum of the squared standard errors. We\nused Software for the Statistical Analysis\nof Correlated Data (SUDAAN) for analy-\nses to account for the complex sampling\ndesign. Prevalence estimates were calcu-\nlated using the sampling weights so that\nthe estimates are representative of the ci-\nvilian noninstitutionalized U.S. popula-\ntion.

First, after eliminating waist cir-\ncumference as one of the criteria of the\nmetabolic syndrome, the age-adjusted\nprevalence of having three or four of the\nremaining four criteria was 13.5% in\nNHANES III and 13.0% in NHANES\nprevalence of the metabolic syndrome\ncalculated the prevalence adjusted for the\nBMI distribution from NHANES III. In\nNHANES III, the prevalence adjusted for\nthe four categories of BMI was 23.1%\namong all participants, 22.8% among\nmen, and 23.8% among women. In\nBecause it is unclear how commonly\nhealth care professionals measure waist\ncircumference on their patients and be-\ncause the use of BMI to assess obesity has\nbeen heavily promoted, we examined\nwhat cut points for BMI would generate\nequivalent prevalences of the metabolic\nvided very close agreement in prevalence\nestimates using BMI instead of waist cir-\ncumference. Although the cut points we\nidentified for BMI may result in similar\nprevalence estimates for the population,\nusing BMI instead of waist circumference\nto identify the metabolic syndrome in an\nindividual may result in wrongly classify-\ning that individual as having or not having\nthe metabolic syndrome according to the\nNCEP/ATP III criteria.\ncrease in the prevalence of the metabolic\nsyndrome occurred among U.S. adults\naged 20 years, particularly women.\nAmong people without diabetes, the rela-\ntive increase exceeded that among all par-\nticipants. Increases in the prevalence of\nabdominal obesity and high blood pres-\nsure, and to a lesser degree hypertriglyc-\neridemia and low HDL cholesterol\nconcentration, most likely accounted for\nmuch of this increase.\nRecently, the American Diabetes As-\nsociation changed the definition of im-\npaired fasting glucose by lowering the\nmg/dl (23). This change, which was in-\ncorporated into the NCEP/ATP III defini-\ntion of the metabolic syndrome (18),\nraised the prevalence of this syndrome by\nabout an absolute 5%. Under the original\nNCEP/ATP III definition, the unadjusted\nprevalence in this analysis was 23.1% in\nNHANES III and 26.7% in NHANES\nglucose threshold, the prevalence in-\nbers for U.S. adults aged 20 years\n(177 million) and the prevalence of the\nmetabolic syndrome based on the original\ndefinition calculated from NHANES III\ndata, about 41 million people had the\ngrowth of the population (201 million\nthe increase in the prevalence of the met-\nabolic syndrome, 55 million people had\nprevalence estimates of the metabolic syn-\ndrome based on the revised definition, we\nestimate that 50 million people had the\nThe five components of the metabolic\nsyndrome were measured similarly in the\ntwo surveys. Thus, the changes in the\nprevalence of the metabolic syndrome\nwere not due to methodological changes.\nBecause we only included participants\nwho attended the morning examination\nin this analysis, the estimates of the prev-\nalence of the metabolic syndrome differ\nslightly from those of our previous analy-\nsis of NHANES III data. The smaller sam-\nreduced the statistical power to detect sig-\nnificant changes in many demographic\nsubgroups.\nA noteworthy finding was the large\nincreases in the prevalence of the meta-\nbolic syndrome among women compared\nwith men. In particular, the prevalence of\nthis syndrome escalated rapidly among\nin the prevalences of hypertriglyceride-\nmia and high blood pressure were largely\nresponsible for the increase among\nwomen.\nTwo important determinants of the\nmetabolic syndrome are obesity and\nphysical activity. The prevalence of obe-\nU.S. between NHANES III and NHANES\nthe increase in BMI accounted for much of\nthe increase in the prevalence of the met-\nabolic syndrome. Leisure-time physical\nactivity levels have been relatively stable\nabout trends in other components of\nphysical activity such as occupational\nphysical activity and transportation-\nrelated physical activity.

The etiology of the metabolic syn-\ndrome is also controversial, with obesity,\ninsulin resistance, and other etiologies be-\ning advocated. By focusing on the meta-\nbolic syndrome, the NCEP/ATP III\nreinforced the need for health care profes-\nsionals to take a more comprehensive ap-\nproach to their patients and to address all\nFord, Giles, and Mokdad\nrelevant risk factors that increase the risk\nfor type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular\nevents. The metabolic syndrome may be\nviewed as a useful window on the health\nof the U.S. population. Consequently, the\nincrease in the prevalence of this syn-\ndrome is a worrisome indicator of future\nincreases in diabetes and cardiovascular\ndisease.\nBecause the metabolic syndrome is\nextremely common in the U.S. popula-\ntion and its prevalence is increasing,\nhealth care professionals are likely to en-\ncounter patients with this syndrome in\ntheir practice. It remains unknown to\nwhat extent health care professionals have\nadopted the recommendations concern-\ning the metabolic syndrome made by the\nNCEP/ATP III and are screening their pa-\ntients for this syndrome. Measurements of\nblood pressure and concentrations of trig-\nlycerides, HDL cholesterol, and glucose\nare commonly collected in clinical prac-\ntice. Whether waist circumference is rou-\ntinely measured at present is unknown.\nTo stem the rising tides of obesity and\nthe metabolic syndrome, comprehensive\napproaches for improving nutrition and\nphysical activity habits that target both in-\ndividuals and the population are required\n(27). Health care professionals have a crit-\nical role in preventing the development of\nthe metabolic syndrome in their patients\nthrough weight management and the\nachievement of proper physical activity\nlevels. Because the syndrome is reversible,\nhealth care professionals can help their\npatients with this syndrome adopt pre-\nventive lifestyles that are conducive to de-\nveloping and reversing this syndrome. In\naddition, health care professionals must\nassist patients with the metabolic syn-\ndrome in averting or delaying progression\nto diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and\nother complications. Although pharma-\ncological therapy for each of the compo-\nnents of this syndrome is available, the\nrole of such therapy in the absence of life-\nstyle changes deserves clarification.
