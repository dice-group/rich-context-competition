Conceptually, frailty is more than an association\nwith specific diseases or disabilities, but rather a systemic\nmanifestation of physical and cognitive deficits--including\nsigns, symptoms, illnesses, and impairments--that accumu-\nlate over the life course (Fried et al., 2004; Kulminski et al.,\nMorley, Perry, & Miller, 2002; Rockwood, Mogilner, &\nmethods have been used to operationalize frailty, although the\nmost common applications are perhaps the phenotypic ap-\nproach and the frailty index (FI) (Bergman et al., 2007;\nKulminski et al., 2008; Levers, Estabrooks, & Ross Kerr,\ntypic approach defines frailty based on several items, such as\nweight loss, exhaustion, weakness, slowness, or low physical\nactivity, and considers any three conditions as an indication of\nfrailty (see Fried et al., 2001).Alternatively, the FI focuses less\non the specific deficits of individuals and focuses instead on\nthe cumulative number of health deficiencies (Kulminski\ntween these two approaches, the choice of measurement is\noften dictated by the outcome under investigation.\nAccordingly, recent research shows that FI is more appli-\ncable for predicting mortality than is the phenotypic method\ntice, most studies compute FI as the proportion of cumulative\nhealth deficits to all possible deficits for a given individual\n(Rockwood, 2005). Thus, FI quantifies the general concept of\nfrailty by incorporating a variety of psychological, physiologi-\ncal, and functional conditions and abilities that represent an\nindividual's balance of health assets to deficits (Fisher, 2005;\nRockwood, Fox, Stolee, Robertson, & Beattie, 1994). In other\nwords, FIs characterize basic human functioning by emphasiz-\ning the aggregate (or systemic) deterioration in psychophysi-\nological performance (Kulminski et al., 2006) rather than\nfocusing on the substance of the specific conditions that define\nthe index. The validity of the FI has been demonstrated in var-\nious populations as a proxy for biological age, as a robust pre-\ndictor of health change, health care utilization, and death, and\nas an effective tool among geriatricians and others for studying\nthe determinants of aging and its implications for public health\nmonitoring and intervention (Goggins, Woo, Sham, & Ho,\nKulminski et al., 2006; Mitnitski, Graham, Mogilner, &\nMitnitski, MacKnight, & Rockwood, 2004; Yashin et al.,\nFrailty and Mortality Among Chinese at Advanced Ages\nDanan Gu,1 Matthew E.

This study investigates the factors associated with frailty and the association of frailty with mortality in a\nMethods. Using the 2002 wave of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey, we construct a frailty index (FI)\nbased on 39 measures available in the data set. We use ordinal logistic regressions to examine the factors associated with the\nFI and use Weibull hazard regression to examine the association between frailty and 3-year mortality from 2002 to 2005.\nResults. Age, sex, ethnicity, urban\u00adrural residence, economic condition, religious involvement, and daily exercise are\nsignificantly associated with levels of frailty. Hazard analyses further reveal that the FI is a robust predictor of mortality\nat advanced ages and that the relationship between frailty and mortality is independent of various covariates.\nDiscussion. The measurement and analysis of frailty have broad implications for public health initiatives designed to\ntarget individuals with the diminished capacity to effectively compensate for external stressors and to prevent further\ndeclines associated with aging and mortality. A key to healthy longevity is the prevention, postponement, and potential\nrecovery from physical and cognitive deficits at advanced ages through enhanced medical interventions and treatments.\nKey Words: China--Old adults--Frailty index--Mortality.\n2007). We argue that FIs also provide unique insight into\nage-related processes such as mortality because frailty is inde-\npendent of chronological age and incorporates so-called\n\"mild-effect traits\" that are typically ignored due to their lim-\nited individual effects (Kulminski,Yashin, et al., 2007).\nAlthough there is a growing body of literature on frailty\nin developed countries, research is scarce in developing\ncountries. Perhaps the most apparent lack of research on\nfrailty is in mainland China (hereafter China), which has the\nworld's largest oldest-old population. Compared with many\nWestern nations, China has a rapidly aging population and a\nburgeoning health care system that has recently weakened\ndespite the nation's economic growth (Yip & Hsiao, 2008).\nIn the coming decades, China will face dramatic population\naging; it remains unknown how China's unique social and\ncultural makeup will respond to the challenges of caring for\nfrail elders and enhancing healthy longevity.\nTo our knowledge, the associations among frailty, its risk\nfactors, and mortality have not been examined in China. Also\nunclear is how mortality risks are associated with levels of\nthe Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS)\nto examine the factors associated with age-related frailty\nand its association with prospective mortality. Unlike most\nstudies, which lack adequate samples of older adults (for\nwe employ longitudinal data from a large national sample of\nWe conclude by discussing the implications of our results and\nwhat they mean for China's unique sociopolitical landscape\nand the promotion of exceptional aging for all populations.\nData and Measurement\nData\nInitiated in 1998 as a multidisciplinary study, the CLHLS is the\nfirst nationwide longitudinal survey on the determinants of\nhealthy longevity with the largest sample of oldest old from a\ndeveloping country. The survey was conducted in half of the\nrandomly selected counties/cities in 22 out of 31 provinces in\nChina and interviewed all known centenarians in the sampled\ncounties/cities with informed consent. For every centenarian\nwith a predesignated random code, interviews were conducted\nfor nearby adults with a predesignated age and sex who were\n89, and 90\u00ad99. The term \"nearby\" refers to the same village or\nstreet or the same town, county, or city, where applicable. The\nsampling strategy is designed to include comparable numbers\nof randomly selected men and women at ages 65\u00ad99. Our\nanalyses are restricted to the third and fourth waves of the CL-\nans and 3,088 centenarians. Of the total participants (N =\nto follow-up.\nExtensive data were collected on demographic characteris-\ntics, family and household characteristics, lifestyle, diet, psy-\nchological characteristics, economic resources, family\nsupport, self-reported health, self-reported life satisfaction,\nlower and upper extremities performance, instrumental ac-\ntivities of daily living (IADL), activities of daily (ADL), cog-\nnitive functioning, and chronic diseases suffered and their\nimpacts on daily life. All information was obtained through\nin-home interviews. The dates of death for deceased respon-\ndents were collected from various sources including death\ncertificates, next of kin, and neighborhood committees. All\ndates were validated, and the dates reported on death certifi-\ncates were ultimately used when available--otherwise the\nnext of kin's report was used, followed by neighborhood reg-\nistries. Systematic assessments of the CLHLS regarding the\naccuracy of age reporting, the randomness of attrition, and\nthe reliability, validity, and consistency of numerous mea-\nsures show that data quality in the CLHLS is high (Gu, 2008;\nFrailty Index and Covariates\nTo capture the cumulative health deficits of an individual\nstudies calculate FI using multiple variables that encompass\nvarious dimensions of health and limitations (Kulminski,\net al., 2005).Although studies using this approach often do not\ninclude the same number or type of indicators to estimate\nrandom selection of variables yields comparable results\n(Rockwood, Mitnitski, Song, Steen, & Skoog, 2006); however,\nit is necessary to include the same indicators over time to\nevaluate individual change (Mitnitski et al., 2005; Rockwood\nFollowing established research (Kulminski, Yashin, et al.,\ncount of the number of deficits divided by the total number of\npossible deficits for a given person. We used 39 indicators of\nvarious dimensions of self-reported health status, cognitive\nfunctioning, disability, auditory and visual ability, depres-\nsion, heart rhythm, and numerous chronic diseases that were\ncollected in the 2002 CLHLS (see Appendix for all items).\nThe items comprising our FI are similar to those used in stud-\nies from Canada (Mitnitski et al., 2005), the United States\n(Kulminski et al., 2006), and Hong Kong (Goggins et al.,\n2005). Individual items were dichotomized and coded 1 when\na deficit is present. Consistent with prior research (Goggins\net al., 2005), we assigned a score of 2 if the respondent had a\nserious illness that caused him/her to be hospitalized or\nbedridden two or more times. The FI was then computed by\nsumming all deficits and then dividing by the total number of\npossible deficits (range = 0\u00ad1). To assess the validity and sen-\nsitivity of our FI, we also analyzed FIs based on different\ncombinations of the individual indicators. We found that the\nresults are consistent as long as the major domains of health\nare included in the index (i.e., ADLs, IADLs, chronic dis-\neases, and cognitive functioning). For analytical purposes,\nthe FI is categorized into quartiles to minimize skewness.\nTable 1 lists the covariates and their frequency distribu-\ntions. Based on the well-established literature on the health\nand mortality of older adults, we include covariates for\nbasic demographic factors (ethnicity and urbanicity), socio-\neconomic status (SES) (education, primary lifetime occupa-\ntion, economic independence, and family economic\ncondition), family/social support (marital status, proximity\nto children, and religious participation), and health practices\n(regular exercise and smoking in the past five years) (see\nFerrucci et al., 2003; Liang, Bennett, Sugisawa, Kobayashi,\n& Fukaya, 2003; Strawbridge, Shema, Cohen, & Kaplan,\nmously and include non-Han ethnicity (vs. Han), urban\nresidence (vs. rural), one or more years of education (vs. no\nschooling), white-collar occupation (vs. all other occupa-\ntions), economic independence (coded 1 if the primary\nfinancial source for daily expenses, excluding medical\ncosts, comes from the respondent's own work income or\npension, as opposed to children, government subsidies, or\nother sources), good family economic standing (coded 1 if\nthe familial economic status is reported to be \"rich\" or \"very\nrich\" compared with others in their community), currently\nmarried (vs. no), high proximity to children (coded 1 if co-\nresiding or in the same neighborhood, town, or village),\nreligious involvement (vs. no), regularly exercise (vs. no),\nand whether the respondent smoked in the past five years\n(vs. no). Although associations between these covariates\nand health are well established in the literature, there is the\npossibility of endogeneity between some covariates and the\nFI. For example, frailty can lead to reduced economic inde-\npendence, exercise, and religious participation; therefore,\ninterpretations of these associations should be cautious.\nAll measures come from the 2002 interview, and less\nthan 2% of data are missing for all variables. Following rec-\nommendations by Landerman, Land, & Pieper (1997), we\nuse modal and mean values to impute missing data for the\ncategorical and continuous variables, respectively. Further\ndetails of the variable coding are available upon request.\nMethods\nThe analyses involve two sets and are stratified by age\nand sex due to the well-documented sex differences in dis-\nability and mortality (e.g., Crimmins, Hayward, & Saito,\nTable 1. Relative Frequency Distributions of the 2002 Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey Variables\nAge\nMen\nWomen\nin frailty (Yashin et al., 2007). First, we estimate ordinal\nlogistic models to examine the factors associated with\nfrailty. A test of the proportional odds assumption--that\nthe odds ratios are proportional across the FI quartiles--\nindicated a violation for age and exercise variables. Al-\nthough these two variables had small p values in the\nsensitivity testing, there was evidence to suggest that the\nproportional odds assumption was not necessarily invalid\nIn practice, the assumption is frequently violated, and alter-\nnative models often induce more stringent assumptions\n(Long & Freese, 2006). To be sure, we used quintile regres-\nsion methods (Buchinsky, 1998) to compare estimates from\nvarious quintile intervals, and we found similar results; we\nalso found consistent results from binary logistic models\nIn the second set of analyses, we use hazard regression\nmodels to examine the relationship between frailty and\nmortality. A Weibull model is selected for the hazard analy-\nses based on model fit and because the estimates are consis-\ntent with other full- and semiparametric hazard functions\n(e.g., Gompertz and Cox). To account for nonlinearity\nbetween the FI and mortality (Yashin et al., 2007), we again\nuse FI quartiles and include two groups of covariate adjust-\nments. Because all analyses are stratified by age group and\nsex, the first group of purely demographic controls includes\nsingle year of age and ethnicity (Model I); the second group\nfurther adds the remaining covariates described above\n(Model II). Survival time in the regression analyses is mea-\nsured in days from the 2002 interview until death or the\ntime of the 2005 interview. Additional sensitivity analyses\nusing other percentile cut-points of the FI were conducted\nand the results were essentially identical. Those who were\nlost to follow-up in the 2005 survey were dropped from the\nhazard analyses because their survival status (dead or alive)\nwas not known.Although persons lost to follow-up are more\nlikely to be women, urban residents, have higher SES, live\nalone, and be in poor health (Gu, 2007), the inclusion of\nthese individuals' estimated survival status using multiple\nimputation--based on their characteristics--yielded minor\ndifferences and suggested that the exclusion of those lost to\nfollow-up introduced little bias in the estimates. Therefore,\ndecedents.\nAll analyses are performed using Stata version 10.1\n(StataCorp, 2007). The sampling weight in the publicly\nreleased CLHLS data set is calculated based on the age\u00adsex\u00ad\nurban/rural residence-specific distribution of the population\nand does not capture other important compositional variables\n(e.g., marital status, economic status); therefore, we do not\nuse weights in our multivariate analysis. Previous research\nshows that results from unweighted regression models pro-\nduce unbiased coefficients when including variables related\nto sample selection (i.e., age, sex, and urbanicity) (Winship &\nRadbill, 1994) and that weighted regressions will unnecessar-\nily increase standard errors (see http://www.sociology.ohio-\nstate.edu/people/ptv/faq/weights.htm). Preliminary analyses\nconfirmed that the overall patterns and conclusions were sim-\nilar between the weighted and unweighted data.\nResults\nTable 1 presents sample distributions by age and sex.\nSeveral distinguishing features are evident; for instance,\nfrailty increases with age for both women and men, and\nwomen are frailer than men at all ages. Men tend to have\nhigher SES than women, and with the exception of family\neconomic condition, SES declines steadily with age. As\nexpected, the proportion of respondents who are currently\nmarried is higher for men than women but decreases\ndramatically with age for both sexes. The proportion of\nrespondents with a high proximity to children is relatively\nstable across age, and the difference between older men and\nwomen is marginal. More women are involved in religious\nactivities than men, although religious activity and the sex\ndifference decrease with age. Not surprisingly, the preva-\nlence of regular exercise and smoking in the past five years\nis much higher among men than women and declines\nsteadily with age.\nFigure 1 presents the observed and fitted logistic curves\nof the mean FI by age from 65 to 109 for men and women\nin 2002.

Figure 2 illus-\ntrates the density distributions of the FI by sex and shows\nthat frailty levels become less skewed across age. This\nsuggests that the absolute heterogeneity in frailty (i.e.,\nstandard deviation of the FI) increases with age, and the\nrelative heterogeneity in frailty (i.e., the inversion of the\nsquare root of the shape parameter of the curve) decreases\nwith age. This age pattern is not unexpected given that\nyounger elders on average are healthier than their older\ncounterparts--a pattern similar to that observed in the\nU.S. and Canada (Kulminski, Ukraintseva et al., 2007;\nTable 2 presents the results from the ordinal logistic mod-\nels. Consistent with Table 1, age is strongly related with\nincreased levels of frailty for both men and women.

With few excep-\ntions, the effects of education and occupation on frailty are\ngenerally weak; however, economic independence and good\nfamily economic conditions reduce frailty for men and even\nmore so for women. The effects of having a spouse and high\nproximity to children on the FI also are marginal, whereas\nthe association between religious participation and frailty\nis negative and significant. We also find a robust negative\nassociation between regular exercise and frailty across age\nfor both women and men. The relationship between smok-\ning and frailty is not significant.\nFigure 3 presents the observed proportion of deaths over\nexpected, the oldest old have a much higher rate of death\nthan their younger counterparts, and elderly men are more\nlikely to die than women at comparable levels of frailty.\nHowever, the difference in mortality across frailty quartiles\nis especially large within the same age groups for men and\nwomen. For example, persons aged 65\u00ad79 in the third and\nfourth FI quartiles have the same (or higher) proportions of\ndeath than those aged 80\u00ad89 in the first or second quartiles.\nIn other words, healthy individuals aged 80\u00ad89 appear to\nexhibit mortality risks as low as persons less than age 80.\nThe age-graded findings between frailty and mortality,\nthough not surprising, are consistent with previous evidence\nTable 3 presents the relative risks of mortality from the\nWeibull hazard models. For both men and women, Model I\nshows that frailty levels in the upper two quartiles are re-\nlated to higher mortality across all age groups. This pattern\nis also found in the lower two FI quartiles, with exceptions\namong young elders aged 65\u00ad79 and a few cases for the\noldest old. Although the differences in relative hazards\nacross frailty levels vary by sex and age, these differences\nincrease substantially across each quartile. For example, the\nrelative risks for the fourth FI quartile are about five times\ngreater among men and four times greater among women\ncompared with the first quartile. Model II shows that con-\ntrolling for SES, family/social support, and health practices\nreduces the relative risks only slightly and suggests only a\nmodest mediating effect of the covariates on the associa-\ntions between frailty and mortality. Thus, Models I and II\nboth show that the FI is a strong predictor of mortality at\nlate ages and is independent of chronological age and other\ncovariates.\nDiscussion\nFrailty is an important concept for both scholars and\nhealth practitioners studying morbidity and mortality at ad-\nvanced ages. However, there are few studies of the distribu-\ntional patterns of frailty among the oldest old, particularly\nin developing countries. The lack of research is primarily\ndue to limited data representing older populations and com-\nprehensive measures of psychophysiological functioning.\nDrawing from the world's largest aging population, we use\ndata from a nationwide longitudinal survey in China to ex-\namine a 39-item index of frailty and its associations with\nage- and sex-specific mortality. Consistent with studies\nfrom other countries (Kulminski et al., 2006; Mitnitski\net al., 2005), our data show that the nonlinear relationship\nbetween frailty and chronological age also is observed\namong older adults in China. Overall, we find that these\nnonlinear changes in frailty across age mark the inherent\nvalue of a valid and systemic indicator of the cumulative\naspects of aging (Kulminski et al., 2006).\nResults from the density distributions of the FI demon-\nstrate significantly increasing levels of frailty across age\nthat generally plateau at later ages among men and women.\nAlthough intuitive, these findings also shed light on the het-\nerogeneity of health in older populations who face an ac-\ncumulation of functional deficits and organ decline with\nadvancing age (Kulminski et al., 2006). For example, our\nfindings suggest that chronological age does not necessarily\nlead to an accumulation of deficits and that low FI values\nare not exclusive to younger elders. Rather, we find evi-\ndence that concurs with existing research showing the di-\nversity of individuals within and across age groups\nFrailty index by quartile\n%\nfirst second third fourth\nMen Women\n%\nfirst second third fourth\nFrailty index by quartile\n(b)\n(a)\nFigure 3. Observed proportion of deaths and 95% confidence intervals over a 3-year period by frailty, sex, and age.\n(Kulminski,Yashin, et al., 2007), suggesting that frailty and\nbodily damage are not inevitable features of aging and that\nhealthy longevity is an achievable goal for many older\nadults (Evert, Lawler, Bogan, & Perls, 2003). In fact, a re-\ncent study by Yashin et al. (2007) showed that U.S. life ex-\npectancy at age 65 would increase by nearly 10 years for\nmen and women respectively if every individual were given\nthe same fixed level (i.e., average population level) of frailty\nand spent the rest of their lives with that fixed frailty level.\nWe show significant differences in frailty according to eth-\nnicity, urban\u00adrural residence, SES, participation in religious\nactivities, and regular exercise. Ethnic minorities exhibit\nrelatively lower FI levels compared with the Han majority.\nWe speculate that this finding is due to higher mortality\namong minorities before reaching older ages (i.e., selection),\nleaving more robust minorities among those surviving to ad-\nvanced ages. According to Chinese census data (National\nBureau of Statistics of China [NBSC], 2003), the mortality\nrate of minorities is higher than Han adults before age 80\nbut reverses thereafter.\nThe finding that urban elders have more frailty than rural\nelders also can be attributed to mortality selection, as well\nas different lifestyles, support networks, and other environ-\nmental factors (see Dupre, Liu, & Gu, 2008; Gu & Zeng,\n2004). Indeed, research suggests that older adults in devel-\noping countries--who predominantly live in rural areas--\nhave increased levels of ADL functioning compared with\nolder adults in developed nations (Lamb, 1999). We also\nidentify other psychosocial factors that are associated with\nfrailty that are presumably not due to mortality selection.\nCongruent with the previous findings related to physical\nfunctioning and self-reported health, we find that the as-\nsociation between economic condition and frailty is stron-\nger than the associations between education and occupation\nand frailty (Nordstrom, Diez Roux, Jackson, & Gardin,\n2004; von dem Knesebeck, L\u00fcschen, Cockerham, &\nSiegrist, 2000). This suggests that older adults with greater\neconomic resources can purchase treatments and other\nmedical services that benefit health and delay or alleviate\nsymptoms of frailty. We also find that religious participation\nappears to protect against frailty perhaps because of reduced\npsychological distress and improved spiritual coping, social\nsupport, or a more generalized and positive belief system\n(see Maselko & Kubzansky, 2006). Regular exercise likely\nmaintains good physical mobility and organ functioning\nthat also help postpone or relieve health deficits (Bortz,\n2002). However, these speculations, as well as issues of en-\ndogeneity and causal order, should be evaluated with longer\nfollow-up data. For example, it is possible that increased\nfrailty reduces individuals' economic independence and\nkeeps them from exercising or participating in religious ac-\ntivities, whereas low levels of frailty help maintain and en-\ncourage economic independence, exercise, and religious\nparticipation. Nonetheless, we believe that endogeneity is\nlikely minor given the context of our measures. For exam-\nple, economic independence as measured in this study (i.e.,\nthe primary financial source for daily expenses comes from\nthe respondent's own work income or pension) is less likely\nto be influenced by health conditions than medical costs or\nfamily economic conditions. Furthermore, many religious\nTable 3.

Numbers in the parentheses are standard errors.\nreligious involvement is not necessarily determined by\nhealth conditions.\nProximate mechanisms notwithstanding, our findings\ndemonstrate that psychosocial factors play some signifi-\ncant role in the severity of frailty and should remain an\nimportant consideration in medical practice and public\nhealth interventions. Moreover, this knowledge will be-\ncome especially useful for initiating and evaluating pub-\nlic health efforts to promote healthy longevity and\nameliorate frailty in China, a country which is facing\ndramatic population aging in a context of fewer family\ncaregivers, greater mobility, rising health care expendi-\ntures, and lack of a national social security system (Yip\nOur analyses corroborate the finding that frailty is\nhighly correlated with the risk of death. Not surprisingly,\nfrail older adults are more likely to die, and the patterns\nare similar for men and women across age. These find-\nings are consistent with the general argument that frailty\nrepresents accumulated deficits that deplete redundant\nsystems and make individuals more vulnerable to dis-\nability and death (Gavrilov & Gavrilova, 2001; Mitnitski\nstrong predictor of mortality; the relationship between\nfrailty and mortality is independent of chronological age\nand differs little when adjusting for various covariates.\nThis suggests that the association between adaptive regu-\nlation (e.g., exercise, lifestyle change) and mortality at\nadvanced ages is largely reduced at higher frailty levels\nand eventually reaches levels that are clinically inconse-\nquential. To some extent, these results also reinforce the\nvalidity and utility of our frailty measure based on the\nassessments of accumulated health deficits among the\nChinese elderly. Our findings also replicate the age- and sex-\ngraded associations between frailty and mortality found\nin previous research (Mitnitski et al., 2005; Rockwood\nAn interesting finding is that although women exhibit\nhigher FI levels than men at all ages, women have lower\nage-specific mortality than men for every given FI level.\nIn other words, women appear to accumulate more defi-\ncits over their life course than men of the same age, but\nmen are also dying at a higher rate. We suspect that the more\npronounced levels of frailty among women might be due to\na combination of higher incidence, longer durations (i.e.,\nlow recovery), and lower severity of illnesses (Hardy, Al-\nlore, Guo, & Gill, 2008). This seemingly contradictory\nfinding is similar to findings in previous studies from\nother populations (Kulminski, Ukraintseva et al., 2007;\nture has long recognized a gender paradox in health and\nmortality, and it is argued that gender differences in genetic\nand acquired risks, immune system responses, hormones,\ndisease patterns and prevention, and health-reporting be-\nhaviors may explain the lower mortality of women (Bath,\nJuel, Vaupel, Christensen, 2008; Spiers, Jagger, Clarke, &\nArthur, 2003). For example, some studies show that men\nexhibit higher baseline levels of muscle mass and neu-\nroendocrine and hormonal measurements (testosterone)\nthat may delay the onset and/or accumulation of frailty\n(Walston & Fried, 1999). Similarly, men are shown to\npossess greater positive affect than women (Nolen-Hoek-\nsema, Larson, & Grayson, 1999), which also is shown to\nsignificantly lower the risks of frailty (Ostir, Ottenbacher,\n& Markides, 2004). Moreover, research shows that men\nare more likely to die suddenly, whereas women are more\nlikely to experience a gradual progression of physical de-\ngeneration (Puts et al., 2005). Taken together, our find-\nings provide further evidence of the fundamental processes\nassociated with sex differences in frailty and its associa-\ntion with mortality (Kulminski, Yashin et al., 2007).\nOur study identifies several avenues for future research\nand highlights some important implications. Limited\nsamples of the very old are a critical obstacle for re-\nsearchers studying healthy longevity. To date, there are\nfew surveys with samples of centenarians that exceed\nthis limitation by utilizing a large-scale sample of oldest-\nold adults to investigate patterns of frailty across age for\nmen and women. We believe that our analysis provides\nsome of the strongest evidence of the distribution of\nhealth deficits among exceptionally old adults. However,\nwe also acknowledge that more research on this topic\nfrom other population-based studies is clearly warranted.\nUndoubtedly, as our understanding of physiological path-\nways increases, future studies will continue to refine\nmeasures of frailty and move beyond the limitations of\nthe current research that assumes equal item weight and\nexcludes important indicators of immune function and\nbiomarkers.\nIn addition to determining risks of mortality, frailty\nalso reflects individual risks of functional loss and vul-\nnerability (Campbell & Buchner, 1997) and is a useful\nindicator of the general health burden within the elderly\npopulation (Goggins et al., 2005). Furthermore, signifi-\ncant differences in frailty across a variety of sociodemo-\ngraphic characteristics indicate that numerous factors\nplay a role in determining cumulative deficits at old ages.\nTherefore, the measurement and analysis of frailty have\nbroad implications for public health initiatives designed\nto target individuals with diminished capacity to effec-\ntively compensate for external stressors and prevent fur-\nther declines associated with aging and mortality\nthat individuals may live to age 100 and older and remain\nrelatively healthy by adhering to healthy lifestyles and\navoiding identifiable risks (Zeng, Crimmins, Carriere, &\nT32 Traineeship in the Social, Economic, and Medical Demography of\nConflict of interest: None.\n"
