This study helps us ex-\namine whether the association found by\nErickson et al8 in northern California\nschools holds across the nation. Specifi-\ncally, we examine the following: (1)\nwhether overweight status is associated\nwith greater behavior problems at the be-\nginning of kindergarten and (2) whether\noverweight status at the beginning of kin-\ndergarten is a significant predictor of be-\nhavior problems after 2 years in school\namong children with no significant be-\nhavior problems when they entered kin-\ndergarten.\nARTICLE\nFrom RAND, Santa Monica,\nCalif.\n\u00a92004 American Medical Association.

The ECLS-K surveyed a nation-\nally representative cohort of kindergartners from about 1000\nkindergarten programs in the United States in the fall and spring\nthrough grade 5, with data collection on the full sample in the\nspring of grades 1, 3, and 5. At this point, the first 2 years of\ndata are available. The ECLS-K sample was collected using a\ndual-frame multistage sampling design with oversampling of\nAsians and children with a disability. The National Center for\nEducational Statistics9 has more information on the survey de-\nsign and instruments.\nWe use data collected in the fall of kindergarten and the\nspring of first grade in our analysis. The behavior problem vari-\nables came from the parent and teacher questionnaires. Typi-\ncally, the respondent for parent interviews was the child's\nmother. If the mother was not available, then the next selected\nrespondent was another parent or guardian, followed by an-\nother household member. The response rates for the fall kin-\ndergarten teacher and parent questionnaires were 91.4% and\n85.3%, respectively. There were no significant differences in\nthe characteristics (race, sex, mother's educational level, and\nfamily income) of children with and without teacher data, al-\nthough nonresponse on the parent questionnaire was more\nprevalent among nonwhites. However, nonresponse on the\nteacher and parent questionnaires was not associated with child's\noverweight status. Follow-up data in the spring of first grade\non behavior problems were only available for 82.1% of these\nchildren. Children with no follow-up data between kindergar-\nten and first grade were those who changed schools. The ECLS-K\nfollowed up all movers from a random 50% of schools in the\nsample. Therefore, most of the children with no follow-up data\nwere those randomly selected for no follow-up and would be\nunlikely to bias the results. Our analysis sample consists of 9949\nkindergartners with data on parent- and teacher-reported be-\nhavior problems in the fall of kindergarten and the spring of\nfirst grade. Because our study uses public use data, it has been\nexempted from institutional review board approval.\nMEASURES\nThe key variables in this study are child overweight status and\nteacher- and parent-reported behavior problems. The ECLS-K\nincludes 3 behavior problem scales based on the teacher- or\nparent-reported Social Rating Scale (SRS), which we use to con-\nstruct our outcome measures. These scales were adapted from\nthe Social Skills Rating System instrument developed by Gre-\nsham and Elliot.10 The Social Skills Rating System is a well-\nestablished and useful tool for assessing and targeting social\nskills deficits and competing problem behaviors.\n \nThe teacher SRS is a self-administered questionnaire and pro-\nvides 2 scales--externalizing and internalizing behavior prob-\nlems. The externalizing scale includes information on the act-\ning out behaviors of children and is based on 5 items that rate\nthe frequency with which a child argues, fights, gets angry, acts\nimpulsively, and disturbs ongoing activities. The internalizing\nscale consists of 4 items that ask about the apparent presence\nof anxiety, loneliness, low self-esteem, and sadness in the child.\nTeachers used a response scale to report how often the child\ndemonstrated the behavior described: 1, never; 2, occasion-\nally or sometimes; 3, regularly, but not all the time; and 4, most\nof the time. The scores on both scales are the mean rating on\nthe items included in the scale. The split half reliabilities for\nthe teacher SRS are high: 0.90 for externalizing problems and\n0.80 for internalizing problems. We create dichotomous vari-\nables for externalizing and internalizing problems to simplify\nthe presentation. Children who scored at the 95th percentile\nor higher on each scale were classified as having substantial be-\nhavior problems. The scales are not fully continuous and, there-\nfore, slightly more than 5% of children will be identified as hav-\ning either substantial internalizing or substantial externalizing\nproblems. These scales do not provide clinical diagnoses, and\nthe choice of a cut point on a scale is always somewhat arbi-\ntrary. By using the 95th percentile on each scale, we can be con-\nfident that children classified as having substantial problems\nare sufficiently symptomatic to warrant at least a psychologi-\ncal examination. To put these numbers into perspective, the\ntreated prevalence of mental health disorders based on pedi-\natric primary care diagnosis tends to be in the 5% range.11 The\nexact cut points and their interpretation are not central to our\nanalysis because we only want to compare the relative preva-\nlence in different populations, not provide an absolute esti-\nmate of need. As a sensitivity analysis, we also used the 90th\nand 97.5th percentile points as alternate cutoff points.\nParent-Reported Internalizing Behavior Problems\nThis scale is derived from the parent SRS and consists of 4 items\nthat ask parents about children's problems with being ac-\ncepted and liked by others, sadness, loneliness, and low self-\nesteem. Parents used the same 4-point response scale used in\nthe teacher SRS previously described. The reliability for the par-\nent SRS is lower than those for the teacher SRS (0.60). We di-\nchotomize the scale similarly. Because of the way responses are\nclustered on this scale, about 7% of the children display the\nsame or more symptoms as the child at the 95th percentile. Par-\nents were also asked about externalizing behavior problems in\ntheir children. The reliability of this scale was rather low (0.47),\nand we, therefore, did not include it in our analysis.\nOverweight Status\nWe use the body mass index to classify children. Height and\nweight were measured twice in the ECLS-K study at each pe-\nriod. Children who had a body mass index, calculated as weight\nin kilograms divided by the square of height in meters, at the\n95th percentile or higher for their age and sex were classified\nOther Explanatory Variables\nAdditional explanatory variables included in the multivariate\nregression models included race-ethnicity, annual family in-\ncome, whether the child belongs to a single-parent house-\nhold, maternal depression, parent-child interaction, and child's\nbirth weight. These variables are discussed in detail in the \"Data\nAnalysis\" subsection of the \"Methods\" section.\nWe first study the association between overweight status and\nbehavior problems cross-sectionally at the beginning of kin-\ndergarten. We provide descriptive statistics and associations ad-\njusted for potentially confounding factors that may be corre-\nlated with childhood overweight and children's mental health.\nFor the multivariate analysis, we estimate a logit model\nwith behavior problem as the dependent variable and baseline\noverweight status as the right-hand side predictor variable. The\nfirst set of variables to control for confounding effects are stan-\n\u00a92004 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.\ndard sociodemographic variables: race-ethnicity (white, black,\nHispanic, Asian, and others), mother's educational level (high\nschool diploma, high school diploma, some college, bach-\nelor's degree, and a bachelor's degree), annual family in-\ncome, whether the child belongs to a single-parent family, and\nthe number of siblings. The second set includes measures that\nmay be directly related to psychological functioning: parent-\nchild interaction, birth weight, and maternal depressive symp-\ntoms. The ECLS-K asked parents how often they participated\nin 8 different activities with their child, such as reading books\nto their children, telling stories, playing sports, and singing songs.\nOur measure of parent-child interaction is defined as the num-\nber of activities that the parent participates in with the child at\nleast once a week. We include the child's birth weight because\nthere is evidence that low-birth-weight children may be at a\ngreater risk for psychological problems.14-16 In addition, paren-\ntal depression has been shown to be a strong predictor of chil-\ndren's psychological problems.17-21 The ECLS-K asked the par-\nent respondent 12 items from the Center for Epidemiological\nStudies Depression Scale.22 The full Center for Epidemiologi-\ncal Studies Depression Scale consists of 20 items, with scores\nranging between 0 and 60, on which scoring at 16 or higher is\nconsidered to indicate elevated levels of depression. However,\nbecause the ECLS-K survey did not consist of all 20 items, we\nwere unable to use the suggested cutoff. Instead, we use a con-\ntinuous depression scale with scores from 0 to 36, with higher\nscores indicating more depressive symptoms. We convert the\nraw scores into standardized scores by dividing them by the\nstandard deviation (5.31) of these scores.\nOur second analysis approach exploits the longitudinal na-\nture of the ECLS-K data to examine whether overweight sta-\ntus at baseline is an important predictor of the onset of behav-\nior problems during the first 2 years in school. This prospective\ndesign allows us to examine the direction of the relationship\nbetween overweight and behavior problems. A logit regres-\nsion model is estimated, in which the dependent variable is the\npresence of behavior problems at the end of first grade. We used\nthe subset of children who were not described as having any\nsubstantial behavior problems by the mother or teacher at base-\nline. We estimate separate regression models for the 3 behav-\nior problem measures. We also estimate separate models for\nboys and girls, using the same explanatory variables as in the\ncross-sectional analysis.\nStandard errors are corrected using the Huber-White cor-\nrection to account for the correlation between children from\nthe same school.\nRESULTS\nThe ECLS-K data show that about 1 in 10 kindergart-\nners (11.1%) was overweight when he or she entered kin-\ndergarten in 1998; the percentage was slightly higher\nscriptively, the prevalence of teacher-reported substan-\ntial externalizing behavior problems was more than twice\nas high among boys (8.3%) compared with girls (3.5%).\nThe prevalence of substantial internalizing behavior prob-\nlems did not differ significantly for boys vs girls (5.8%\nparent report [P=.17]).\nTable 1 presents descriptive statistics for boys and\ngirls separately, by overweight status. Overweight boys\nwere no more likely to have parent- or teacher-reported\nbehavior problems in the beginning of kindergarten com-\npared with boys who were not overweight. However, over-\nweight girls were significantly more likely to have any\nbehavior problems at the beginning of kindergarten com-\npared with girls who were not overweight. These de-\nscriptive statistics obviously include the effect of other\nTable 1.

For example, Table 1 indi-\ncates that overweight girls were less likely to be white\nand more likely to have a family annual income of less\nthan $25000, mothers with a high school diploma or less,\nfewer siblings, come from single-parent families, and a\nhigher birth weight compared with their peers who were\nnot overweight.\nTable 2 shows the odds ratio of behavior problems be-\ntween overweight and non-overweight children, ad-\njusted for sociodemographic characteristics, parent-\nchild interaction, birth weight, and maternal depression.\nOverweight girls have about 81% greater odds of having\nsubstantial teacher-reported externalizing behavior prob-\nlems, 54% greater odds of having teacher-reported in-\nternalizing behavior problems, and 49% greater odds of\nhaving parent-reported internalizing behavior prob-\nlems compared with girls who are not overweight.

The outcome vari-\nable is whether a child displays substantial behavior\nproblems at the end of first grade. Results from adjusted\nmodels are reported in Table 4 for girls and in\nTable 5 for boys.

For example,\nthe odds of developing externalizing behavior problems\nduring the first 2 years in school are more than 3 times\ngreater for girls in the lowest income quartile compared\nwith girls in the highest income quartile. Not surpris-\ningly, maternal depression had the strongest association\nwith parent-reported internalizing behavior problems,\nbut it may not be a reliable indicator of child health.\nMaternal educational level was not a significant predic-\ntor of the onset of behavior problems, with one excep-\ntion. Boys with mothers who have a bachelor's degree\nor more have about half the odds of developing teacher-\nreported externalizing behavior problems compared\nwith boys with mothers who have a high school\ndiploma or less. We also tested whether there are inter-\nactions of overweight status with race-ethnicity, but\nfound no significant effects. In addition, the results\nfrom unadjusted models are similar to those from the\nadjusted regression models.\nIn addition, boys and girls whose mothers scored 1\nSD higher on the maternal depression scale were 15% and\n14% more likely to exhibit teacher-reported internaliz-\ning behavior problems, respectively.\nCOMMENT\nWhile there is much concern about a possible relation-\nship between overweight status and mental health prob-\nlems, especially if the latter affects readiness to learn, there\nare few data for younger children. The ECLS-K is the first\nlarge and nationally representative data set to study chil-\ndren in kindergarten and first grade. Beginning elemen-\ntary schoolchildren are an important group because ad-\nverse events could permanently lower educational\nachievement. At the same time, elementary school is the\nfirst time all children are exposed to possible interven-\ntions or to screening for health risks that could precipi-\ntate referrals to health care.\nOur cross-sectional results confirm the findings of\none cross-sectional study8 of third-grade students in north-\nern California that associated overweight status with in-\ncreased depressive symptoms among girls, but not among\nboys, after controlling for socioeconomic differences.\nThese findings suggest that overweight girls start school\nwith significant parent- and teacher-reported behavior\nproblems. In addition, the longitudinal aspect of the\nECLS-K data allowed us to identify risk factors for the\nonset of behavior problems during the first 2 years of el-\nementary school among children who did not exhibit any\nbehavior problems at baseline. The longitudinal analy-\nsis is important for understanding cause-effect relation-\nships between these 2 factors, and we are not aware of\nany similar published data. In light of the literature em-\nphasizing the adverse psychosocial effects of obesity, we\nhave focused on the temporal effects from overweight to\nthe onset of new (previously not reported) behavior prob-\nlems. While family income and maternal depression were\nstrong predictors of the onset of behavior problems for\ngirls and boys, we found no evidence that overweight sta-\ntus is a risk factor. These findings are similar to those in\none recent study23 among adolescents that found base-\nline obesity was not a predictor of follow-up depres-\nsion.\nWe also conducted sensitivity analyses by using\ndifferent cut points (90th and 97.5th percentiles) on\nthe behavior problem scales or by determining over-\nweight status relative to a child's classmates rather\nthan using a national (age- and sex-specific) cut point.\nHowever, none of the conclusions about the associa-\ntions between overweight status and behavior prob-\nlems are affected.\nOur study findings should be interpreted in light of\nseveral caveats. First, we focused on the onset of new sig-\nnificant behavior problems, but there may also be dete-\nrioration of emotional health among overweight chil-\ndren who already had significant problems at baseline.\nSecond, including measures of parent-child interaction,\nbirth weight, and maternal depression in our multivar-\niate regression analyses may overcontrol for differences\nbetween overweight and not overweight children if the\npurpose is to identify children at risk of developing be-\nhavior problems. Finally, overweight status measured at\none point may not be a significant risk factor for subse-\nquent behavior problems among children, but persis-\ntent or long-term overweight may result in later mental\nhealth problems, as suggested by one study.24 Future\nwaves of the ECLS-K data will provide opportunities to\ntest this hypothesis.\nWe also do not show results for the opposite causal\npathway, namely, that behavior problems predict later\nassociation between depression and later obesity, espe-\ncially among women. The same pattern seems to hold in\nthese data. Among overweight girls, the presence of in-\nternalizing behavior problems predicted large addi-\ntional body mass index gains, but no similar effects ex-\nisted for boys. Further exploration of these preliminary\nfindings is recommended for future research.\nThere has been considerable attention on over-\nweight status recently, often under the assumption that\nthis can cause psychosocial problems for children and\nprevent learning. However, our results show that over-\nweight girls already have more behavior problems be-\nfore kindergarten; therefore, focusing on mental health\nand overweight is important in the early years.\nWhat This Study Adds\nTo our knowledge, there are no nationally representa-\ntive data on the association between overweight and men-\ntal health outcomes among young children despite grow-\ning concerns regarding increasing obesity and its likely\npsychosocial effects.\nTo our knowledge, our study is the first to exam-\nine this relationship prospectively among a large sample\nof kindergartners in the United States. We confirm that\nthere exists a significant association between over-\nweight and behavioral health problems as early as start-\ning kindergarten. However, we find no evidence that over-\nweight status at the beginning of kindergarten is a risk\nfactor for behavior problems after 2 years in school among\nchildren with no behavior problems at baseline.\n\u00a92004 American Medical Association.
