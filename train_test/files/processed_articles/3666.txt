Caswell, PhD1 and Sharon K. Long, PhD1\n Keywords\nMedicaid, managed care, access to health care, health care utilization, health care costs\nOriginal Research\nIntroduction\nStates have turned to managed care as a strategy to control\nhealth care expenditures and improve the quality of care in\nthe Medicaid program, with the role of managed care\nexpected to increase with the 2014 Medicaid expansion\nunder the Affordable Care Act (ACA).1-3 By focusing on effi-\ncient and effective care delivery, Medicaid managed care\n(MMC) is expected to lower expenditures and provide\ngreater administrative simplicity and budget predictability\nfor states and, potentially, improve access to care and health\noutcomes for program enrollees. The risk, however, is that\nthe incentives for reduced expenditures under managed care\nlead to restrictions on access and lower quality of care for\nColumbia had implemented some level of fully capitated\nmanaged care in their Medicaid programs.4 The scope of\nMMC penetration varied across states, as did the population\ngroups affected. In general, MMC penetration is greater for\nchildren and parents, although states are increasingly turning\nto managed care for aged and disabled populations.2\nThe growing use of managed care by states for their\nMedicaid populations has continued despite a lack of consis-\ntent evidence that managed care has reduced expenditures or\nimproved access to care for enrollees.i Existing research\nfinds little evidence that managed care substantially reduces\nhealth care expenditures, if at all, among nonelderly Medicaid\nenrollees overall,5-7 or among nonelderly adults with dis-\nabilities.8 Recent work by Marton et al. is one exception,\nwhich focused on all children with Medicaid in 2 distinct\nmanaged care programs in Kentucky during the late 1990s.9\nThat study found that managed care results in spending\nreductions, albeit the reductions vary with different types of\nmanaged care programs. Conversely, there is some evidence\nthat overall expenditures may actually have increased with\nthe expansion of MMC among welfare-eligible enrollees\n(adults and children) in California.10\nThe evidence on the association between managed care and\nMedicaid enrollees'access to care is also mixed. For example,\nHerring and Adams found that, among nonelderly Medicaid\nenrollees overall (including children), increased managed care\npenetration is associated with an increase in the number of\nemergency department (ED) and medical practitioner visits,\nand a decrease in the number of inpatient stays and surgeries.5\nThey also find that higher MMC penetration increased reli-\nance of the ED as a usual source of care. In contrast, work by\nGarrett and Zuckerman, who study an earlier time period,\n1The Urban Institute, Washington, DC, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nKyle J. Caswell, Research Associate, The Urban Institute, 2100 M Street\nEmail: kcaswell@urban.org\nfound that mandatory health maintenance organization\n(HMO) programs decreased the probability of an ED visit\namong nonelderly adult Medicaid enrollees.11 The work by\nMarton et al. for children discussed above finds that MMC\ndecreased outpatient utilization, while increasing child well-\nness visits.9 The findings for professional provider utiliza-\ntion, which did not occur in a hospital outpatient or inpatient\nsetting, were mixed--increasing under 1 MMC model and\ndecreasing under the other. Among disabled adults, Burns\nfound that mandatory MMC enrollees did not experience\nimprovements in access to care,12 whereas Coughlin et al.\nfound that MMC led to some improvements in access to\nThis study builds on prior work to examine the impacts of\nincreasing managed care penetration on health care access,\nuse, and expenditures for nonelderly adults within the\nMedicaid program, taking advantage of the variation in fully\ncapitated MMC enrollment within and across states.ii In its\napproach, this work is closest to that of Herring and Adams,5\nyet it is distinct along several dimensions. First, the main\nindependent variable in this analysis, the proportion of\nMedicaid enrollees in fully capitated managed care (ie,\nMMC penetration), is defined at the county level rather than\nthe Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) as in the work by\nHerring and Adams.5 This difference is important as MMC is\ngenerally implemented at the county level when states\nexpand their managed care delivery systems. Consequently,\nthere can be variation in managed care across counties within\na given MSA. Second, our work covers a more recent period\nmore recent time period is important insofar as more time\nhas passed since many counties implemented MMC and the\nimpacts of MMC may take time to materialize, and health\ncare markets change over time. Third, our work distinguishes\nbetween nonelderly Medicaid adults receiving Supplemental\nSecurity Income (SSI), who are, by definition, severely\ndisabled,iii and the non-SSI Medicaid population, whereas\nthe work by Herring and Adams combines the two popula-\ntions and adults and children. The ability to identify SSI\nenrollees is important because they have different medical\nneeds than the non-SSI population and face different man-\naged care options under Medicaid. Finally, our work utilizes\nactual medical spending data, rather than imputed expendi-\ntures. In short, our study offers a more timely and stronger\nassessment of the impacts of expanding MMC than has pre-\nviously been available.\nResults show that a higher level of county MMC penetra-\ntion was associated with an increase in non-SSI enrollees'\nprobability of an outpatient ED visit, reported difficulty see-\ning a specialist, and reported unmet need for prescription\ndrugs. We also observe no evidence of reduced expenditures\nassociated with higher MMC penetration for this population.\nResults specific to the SSI population reveal little association\nbetween MMC and health outcomes. We find no evidence\nthat MMC is related to changes in access to care, use of med-\nical services, or reduced expenditures for the SSI population;\nhowever, small sample sizes make those estimates imprecise.\nOverall, the results for the non-SSI population generally cor-\nroborate those from Herring and Adams of some evidence of\npoorer access and no evidence of reduced expenditures. This\nimplies that policy makers considering expanding managed\ncare for their current Medicaid population, or new enrollees\nin states that expand Medicaid under the ACA, should not\nnecessarily expect reduced expenditures or improvements to\naccess to health care. The primary gain from MMC for the\nstates may be administrative simplicity and budget predict-\nability rather than either reduced expenditures or improved\naccess.\nMethods\nData and Sample\nSeveral sources of data are used in this study. First, house-\nhold survey data are from the Medical Expenditure Panel\nSurvey\u00adHousehold Component (MEPS-HC), which is repre-\nsentative of the US civilian noninstitutionalized population.\nWe pool 4 data files representing calendar years 2006 through\n2009. From the MEPS-HC, we utilize detailed information\non enrollees' health care access, use, and expenditures, as\nwell as health insurance, disability status, and demographic\ncharacteristics (discussed in detail below). The MEPS has a\ncomplex survey design and sampling weights, and all point\nestimates, standard errors, and significance tests reported in\nthis study incorporate these features of the data.\nThe MEPS data are supplemented with county-level\nMMC penetration rates constructed from the Medicaid\nStatistical Information System (MSIS) person summary files\nvariable of interest. The MSIS is a source of administrative\ndata, provided by each state and the District of Columbia to\nthe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).14\nFrom the MSIS data, we utilize information on monthly\nMedicaid enrollment status among all Medicaid enrollees by\ntype of Medicaid (e.g., comprehensive managed care) and\nbasis of enrollment (e.g., disability). These penetration rates\nare our key independent variable of interest (discussed in\ndetail below). These data were merged with the MEPS data\nfor individuals by county of residence and calendar year.v\nIn addition, we supplement the MEPS and MSIS data\nwith county- and state-level information culled from multi-\nple sources. These data, which are discussed in more detail\nbelow, were used to control for important characteristics cor-\nrelated with both the outcomes of interest and county MMC\npenetration. These data are from the Behavioral Risk Factor\nSurveillance System,15 Area Health Resources Files,16\nFederal Reserve Economic Data,17 US Census Bureau State\nGovernment Finances,18 Kaiser Family Foundation,19 US\nCensus Bureau Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates,20\nCMS, National Summary of State Medicaid Managed Care\nPrograms, and Medicaid Managed Care Enrollment\nCaswell and Long 3\nWe imposed several restrictions on the MEPS sample\ngiven the focus of this study. First, we limit the sample to\nnonelderly Medicaid enrollees aged 19 to 64 years. Second,\nwe exclude dual Medicaid-Medicare enrollees given that\nthey face very different managed care choices. Third, we\nexclude enrollees with less than full-year coverage given our\nfocus on health care access and expenditures over the prior\nyear. This insures that the access, use, and expenditure mea-\nsures correspond to an equivalent period of Medicaid cover-\nage. Finally, we distinguish between severely disabled\nenrollees, defined as those who received SSI at any point\nduring the year, and nondisabled enrollees.\nvidual records, 124 511 of which are out of the age range for\nthis study or did not have Medicaid coverage at any point\nduring the year (restriction 1). An additional 1274 enrollees\nwere dual eligibles (restriction 2) and 4200 had less than full-\nyear coverage (restriction 3). Finally, we exclude an addi-\ntional 225 records due to missing data for the control\nvariables included in the analysis (74) or a sampling weight\nequal to 0 (151). The final sample for the analysis includes\nreceiving SSI benefits.\nEmpirical Model\nManaged care can have both direct and indirect effects on\nhealth care access and expenditures for Medicaid enrollees.\nFor Medicaid enrollees in managed care plans, we would\nexpect direct effects on health care use and expenditures due\nto changes in provider incentives. Changing incentives under\nmanaged care can affect both the price of care and the quan-\ntity of care provided to enrollees,23 although given the low\nprovider reimbursement rates under Medicaid there may be\nlittle room to lower prices to providers under managed care.6\nFor Medicaid enrollees who remain in fee-for-service\nMedicaid, there is the potential for spillover effects from\nchanges in the market and care delivery patterns as managed\ncare expands. Examples include Medicaid delivery system\nconsolidation, changes in provider practice style, and pres-\nIn this study, we estimate reduced form models of the\noverall association between MMC penetration and enrollees'\nhealth care access, use, and expenditures, controlling for\ncharacteristics of the enrollee and his or her county and state.\nIn cases where an outcome is continuous--counts of medical\nuse and expenditures--we estimate 2-part models where the\nfirst part estimates the probability of any medical use or\nexpenditures, and the second part estimates the level of use\nor expenditures conditional on nonzero use or expenditures.\nOur general specification takes the following form:\nY g P\nicst ct it ct st t icst\n= + + + + +\n- -\n( , )\n   \n' ' '\n\n \n \n\nwhere Yicst represents a given outcome of interest for indi-\nvidual i in county c in state s in year t, P\nct\nequals the MMC\npenetration rate in county c in year t, X\nit\nincludes individual-\nand family-level characteristics associated with individual i,\nC\nincludes county-level controls, S\nincludes state-level\ncontrols, t are year fixed effects, 0 is the constant term,\nand icst is an error term. Exact definitions are discussed in\ndetail below. The parameter estimate of interest is \n , which\nmeasures the direct and indirect association of MMC pene-\ntration with the outcomes of interest. Models are estimated\nfor the non-SSI and SSI populations in turn. This is because\nthe medical needs of the 2 populations are likely to differ in\nways that we cannot control for in the analysis (discussed\nbelow) and, consequently, the impacts of managed care may\nalso differ for the 2 groups. Furthermore, as managed care\nenrollment is higher for the non-SSI population, the param-\neter estimate \n is likely to capture more of the direct effects\nof managed care for non-SSI enrollees.\nTo measure the association between MMC penetration\nand health care access, and any health care use or any expen-\nditures--measured as any use of particular medical services\nand any medical expenditure--the function g in Equation 1\nis defined as the logistic function. This is appropriate as these\noutcomes are all binary. The associations between MMC\npenetration and positive medical use are estimated as zero-\ntruncated Poisson models, and the associations with positive\nmedical expenditures are estimated as gamma generalized\nlinear models (GLMs) with a log link.\nDependent Variables (Yicst\n)\nThe dependent variables in this analysis cover 3 broad cate-\ngories: health care access, use, and expenditures. Specifically,\nwe study 5 access to care outcomes, where enrollees indi-\ncated whether in the past year they had (1) a usual source of\ncare, excluding the ED; (2) any unmet need for medical care,\ntests, or treatments; (3) any unmet need for prescription\ndrugs; (4) difficulty seeing a specialist; and (5) difficulty see-\ning a specialist, among those who reported the need to visit a\nspecialist.vi\nSimilarly, we study 4 types of medical care use. For each,\nwe study whether a respondent reported any use of a given\ntype during the last year, and among those who reported use\nwe study the quantity of use over the year. Types of medical\ncare use include inpatient stays, outpatient ED visits,vii gen-\neral doctor visits, and specialist visits. Doctor and specialist\nvisits include those that take place in either an outpatient- or\noffice-based setting.\nFinally, we examine 3 different measures of medical\nexpenditures: total medical expenditures (all payers com-\nbined, including out-of-pocket expenditures), total out-of-\npocket expenditures, and total expenditures by the Medicaid\nprogram. As our data span several calendar years, we inflate\ndollars. Total expenditures and Medicaid expenditures were\ninflated using the National Income and Product Accounts,\nprice index for gross domestic product (GDP).27 Out-of-\npocket expenditures were inflated using the all urban con-\nsumers, Consumer Price Index.28 The results are not sensitive\nto the choice of deflator.\nMMC Penetration ( )\nPct\nCounty MMC penetration, the main independent variable of\ninterest, is defined as the share of a given county's nondual\nMedicaid population aged 19 to 64 enrolled in fully capitated\nmanaged care in a given year. As noted above, the penetra-\ntion rates were calculated from the MSIS data by enrollee\ntype (SSI and non-SSI) and account for less than full-year\nenrollment status.viii In presenting the results, we focus on\nthe average marginal effect (AME) of these penetration rates\nfrom the relevant logistic models, zero-truncated Poisson\nmodels or GLM models .\nAs discussed above, MMC penetration captures both\ndirect and indirect effects of managed care on the outcomes\nof interest, compared with the direct effects of individual\nMMC enrollment. MMC penetration also has the advantage\nof moving away from the individual enrollment decision,\nwhich likely results in nonrandom take-up of managed care\nand, thus, the potential of biased estimates of the link between\nMMC enrollment and the outcomes of interest.ix Using the\npenetration rates, however, may also result in biased esti-\nmates if counties or states shifted from fee-for-service to\nMMC in reaction to factors that also affect the health care\noutcomes (such as limited provider availability). To address\nthis latter concern, we include an array of relevant county-\nand state-level characteristics in the model (discussed\nbelow).\nOther Independent Variables X C S\n, ,\n( )\nWe control for a rich array of individual characteristics asso-\nciated with the outcomes of interest ( )\nXit . Demographic\nrace/ethnicity (white/non-Hispanic, black/non-Hispanic,\nHispanic, and other/non-Hispanic), marital status (married,\nnever married, widowed/divorced/separated), US citizenship\nstatus, and highest educational attainment (less than high\nschool, high school graduate, greater than high school).\nHealth characteristics include both physical and mental\nhealth status (excellent or very good, good, fair or poor) and\nthe number of chronic and nonchronic health conditions.\nFamily-level controls (defined over health insurance eligibil-\nity units [HIEUs])x include family income with respect to the\ndependent family members,xi and whether there was some-\none in the family with a chronic condition other than the\nsample member.\nTo further isolate the link between county MMC penetra-\ntion and the outcomes of interest, we include lagged county-\nand state-level variables to address the potential of MMC\npolicy endogeneity and to control for important environmen-\ntal factors that are likely to affect the outcomes, such as pro-\nvider supply ( ).\nC ,S\nct- st-\n1 1 Policy endogeneity would arise if\nthere were characteristics of a state (or its counties) that\naffected both the outcomes of interest and the state's policy\ndecisions with respect to MMC, such as whether to imple-\nment or expand MMC. Failing to control for such factors in\nthe analysis would lead to biased estimates.xii\nThe county and state measures come from multiple\nsources and were merged with the MEPS data by the indi-\nviduals' county/state of residence by year. To account for the\nstate policy environment, we include 3 state-level variables.\nThe first 2 are state expenditures as percent of revenues,18\nand state GDP per capita,16,17 which serve as proxies for bud-\ngetary pressures in the state. Increased pressure may influ-\nence the decision to shift from fee-for-service to managed\ncare if it is perceived to result in savings. The third state\npolicy environment variable is state Medicaid income eligi-\nbility as percent of FPL for a working-parent family of 3,19\nwhich is a proxy for the state's Medicaid eligibility generos-\nity. States with more generous programs will have more eli-\ngibles, all else equal, and are possibly more motivated to\nseek savings by shifting to managed care.\nLocal (county level) health care market characteristics\nwill affect the Medicaid enrollees' access to and use of care,\nand may also affect decisions on the implementation of\nMMC across geographic areas in a state. We include 4\ncounty-level controls to capture the supply side of the local\nenvironment: the number of hospital beds per 1000 individu-\nals, the number of primary care physicians per 1000 indi-\nviduals, whether the county has 1 or more Federally Qualified\nHealth Centers, and the number of hospitals with an ED per\n1000 individuals.16 A relatively low capacity to provide med-\nical care may impact enrollees' access to care, treatment set-\nting, and expenditures, which in turn may influence decisions\nto shift to managed care. We also include the Medicare +\nChoice Hospital Insurance aged payment rate as a proxy for\nthe price of medical services in the county.16 Higher prices\nfor services, holding quantity and other factors constant,\ninfluence expenditures on services, which is important to\ncontrol for by itself. Nonetheless, higher prices could influ-\nence counties' decisions to shift to managed care for per-\nceived savings.\nTo capture health care needs in the local market, we\ninclude the share of adults diagnosed with diabetes15 and\nmedian household income per capita at the county level.20\nThese are rough proxies for population health that in turn\ninfluences the quantity of medical services demanded in the\nlocal market. And depending on the capacity of the local\nhealth care market, it may impact access and use of services,\nexpenditures, and county decisions to shift to managed care.\nWe also include county population per square mile,16 as\nCaswell and Long 5\nurban areas, with their larger population bases, are more con-\nducive to managed care. Finally, we include a binary variable\nthat indicates whether the county participates in Primary\nCare Case Management (PCCM) for its Medicaid enrollees,\ncalculated from the MSIS administrative data.xiii This is\nimportant as PCCM is distinct from capitated managed care,\nand PCCM penetration is correlated with capitated managed\ncare penetration as PCCM is often a first step toward capi-\ntated managed care. Likewise, though similar, PCCM health\ncare delivery systems produce different incentives for pro-\nviders than capitated programs that may influence the out-\ncomes studied here.\nAdditional Specifications\nAlthough the MMC penetration rate is our primary indepen-\ndent variable of interest, we supplement these findings with\n5 alternative specifications to evaluate the robustness of our\nresults. First we estimate models where the penetration rate\nis lagged 1 year, as lagged penetration is arguably more\nexogenous than contemporary penetration.xiv Second, we\nestimate models where the penetration rate corresponds only\nto counties with mandatory MMC, where the rate equals 0 in\nnonmandatory counties. Data on mandatory MMC come\nfrom CMS, National Summary of State Medicaid Managed\nCare Programs, and Medicaid Managed Care Enrollment\nReport.21,22 Third, models are estimated with a binary vari-\nable indicating whether the county has mandatory MMC\nprogram by subpopulation,xv and a fourth specification with\na binary indicator for whether there is any MMC in the\ncounty for a given subpopulation. The final specification\nincludes a binary indicator from the MEPS data, where\nrespondents reported that they are enrolled in a MMC plan.\nLimitations\nOur estimates of the link between county MMC penetration\nand health care access, use, and expenditures do not neces-\nsarily identify causal effects. Although we estimate rich\nmodels, there may be important omitted variables that affect\nboth county MMC penetration and the study outcomes that\ncould bias our estimates of the effect of MMC. For example,\nalthough we attempt to control for MMC policy endogeneity,\nfactors influencing state policy decisions do so with a lag\nthat is likely to be longer than that which we are able to con-\ntrol for. Thus, it is likely that we reduce but do not eliminate\nsuch bias. Second, we focus on adults with full-year Medicaid\nto link access, use, and expenditures over the year to\nMedicaid coverage for the same time period. However, as a\nsubstantial share of non-SSI Medicaid enrollees cycle in and\nout of coverage, the results reported here may not be gener-\nalizable to the full Medicaid population. Third, we focus on\nnational estimates, knowing that Medicaid and MMC vary\nconsiderably across the states. The results reported here pro-\nvide the average effects across the nation and are not neces-\nsarily applicable to individual states or counties. That is, our\nsample is too small to control for state (or county) fixed\neffects, which is a limitation of the data. Finally, we focus on\npayments for health care services in this analysis and so do\nnot capture the full expenditures of administering the\nMedicaid program under managed care and fee-for-service\nMedicaid.\nResults\nSummary Statistics\nTable 1 reports on the distribution of county MMC penetra-\ntion faced by non-SSI and SSI Medicaid enrollees in the\ntion was generally greater among non-SSI enrollees than SSI\nenrollees. For example, average MMC penetration among\nrespondents in the MEPS subsample equals 33.4% for SSI\nenrollees and 64.1% among non-SSI enrollees (see Table 1).\nLikewise, one-half of non-SSI enrollees resided in counties\nwith MMC penetration equal to 80.8% or higher, whereas\nhalf of SSI enrollees resided in counties with MMC penetra-\ntion at 21.1% or higher. In addition to MMC penetration,\nthree-quarters of non-SSI respondents reported they were\nenrolled in a managed care plan, as did approximately 63%\nof SSI enrollees (see Table A1 of the appendix). Finally,\n82.4% of non-SSI enrollees resided in an area with manda-\ntory MMC, whereas less than half (45.9%) of SSI respon-\ndents resided in mandatory MMC areas over the period\n(Table A1).\nTable 2 reports summary statistics on health care access,\nuse, and expenditures--the dependent variables in this anal-\nysis--by SSI status. Nearly 90% of the SSI and 80% of the\nTable 1. County Medicaid Managed Care Penetration Rates Corresponding to MEPS Respondents by SSI/non-SSI Status, 2006-2009.\nPercentile\nNote. Dual Medicare-Medicaid enrollees were excluded in the penetration rate calculations, as were beneficiaries with less than fully capitated plans. MEPS =\nMedical Expenditure Panel Survey; SSI = Supplemental Security Income.\nnon-SSI enrollees reported that they had a usual source of\ncare other than the ED during the year. Less than 8% of SSI\nenrollees and less than 4% of non-SSI enrollees reported\nunmet need for medical care or prescription drugs during the\nyear. Reflecting their higher health care needs, health care\nuse and expenditures were greater among SSI enrollees,\nalthough the majorities of both groups have some medical\nspending during the year. For example, nearly 95% of SSI\nenrollees, and 85% of non-SSI enrollees, reported nonzero\nmedical spending during the year. Table A1 reports summary\nstatistics for the control variables used in this analysis by SSI\nstatus.\nAverage Marginal Effects\nTable 3 reports estimates of the Average Marginal Effect\n(AME) associated with changes in county MMC penetration\nfrom the health care access, use, and expenditures models.\nThese are estimates of the change in the probability of a\ngiven event, unit of service, or change in medical spending,\ncorresponding (approximately) to a 1 percentage point\nchange in county MMC penetration.xvi Table A2 of the\nappendix provides an example of the complete estimation\nresults for whether non-SSI enrollees reported an outpatient\nED visit (logit model), and Tables A3 and A4 provide the full\nrange of alternative modelspecifications.\nAmong non-SSI enrollees (left, Panel A, Table 3), who are\nmore likely to be enrolled in MMC, we find that an increase in\ncounty MMC penetration is associated with an increase in the\nprobability of reporting unmet need for prescription drugs\n(P < .10) and difficulty seeing a specialist (P < .10 among all\nnon-SSI enrollees, and P < .05 for those who reported need to\nsee a specialist). Furthermore, increasing county MMC pene-\ntration increases the probability of reporting an ED visit (P <\n.01) among non-SSI enrollees. (Below we report results over\nthe entire range of county MMC penetration to illustrate the\nmagnitude of the main findings.) Results from the additional\nspecifications, reported in Table A3, generally corroborate the\nresults discussed here.xvii Despite the finding of increased dif-\nficulty seeing a specialist, we find no evidence that increased\nMMC penetration decreased the probability of visiting a spe-\ncialist (Panel A), or the number of specialist visits among\nthose who visited one (Panel B). We also find no evidence of a\nsignificant change in the probability of positive medical\nexpenditures. Nor do we find any evidence that MMC penetra-\ntion is associated with the quantity of medical use more gener-\nally among those who use services, or medical expenditures\namong those with positive expenditures (Panel B, Table 3).\nResults for the SSI population are generally insignificant\n(right, Table 3). Although there appears to be some evidence\nof a positive association between MMC penetration and the\nnumber of inpatient visits, results appear sensitive alternative\nTable 2.

That is, an increase in MMC pene-\ntration from a relatively low level to MMC as the dominant\ncare delivery system increases the probability of any outpa-\ntient ED visit by 4.9 percentage points for non-SSI enrollees,\nFigure 1 also plots the predicted probabilities for reported\ndifficulty seeing a specialist among those who reported the\nneed to see one (Panel B) and among all non-SSI enrollees\n(Panel D), and unmet need for prescription drugs (Panel C) at\ndifferent levels of county MMC penetration. As shown, the\nestimated probability of reported difficulty seeing a special-\nist, among those who reported need to see one, increases 9.5\nproportional increase for reported difficulty seeing a special-\nist is similar, from 10% to 80% penetration, among the entire\nnon-SSI population (Panel D): 27.5% or 2.8 percentage\nreported unmet need for prescription drugs (Panel C)\n3.4%) with the same shift in MMC penetration.\nDiscussion\nThis study finds that increased MMC penetration in a county\nis associated with an increase in the probability of an ED\nvisit, and reported difficulty seeing a specialist and unmet\nneed for prescription drugs among nonelderly non-SSI\nMedicaid adults. Furthermore, we find no evidence of\nreduced expenditures associated with increased MMC pene-\ntration for the non-SSI population. For nonelderly SSI\nMedicaid adults, we observe no consistent evidence that\nMMC penetration influences medical care access, use, or\nexpenditures. We do not, however, interpret this as evidence\nthat MMC has no impact on the outcomes examined.

Results are estimates of average predicted probabilities of a given outcome over the range of Medicaid managed care penetration from logistic\nmodels. See the \"Methods\" section for details on model specification. SSI = Supplemental Security Income.\nCaswell and Long 9\nSSI sample is small, raising concerns about the precision of\nour estimates for this subpopulation, a limitation of the\nMEPS sample size.\nOverall these results, especially among non-SSI Medicaid\nenrollees, seemingly contradict conventional theories on the\nexpenditures and benefits of managed care. That is, man-\naged care is generally intended to provide access to appro-\npriate care in a timely, efficient, and cost-effective way by\nshifting the locus of care from higher cost settings to pri-\nmary care. If successful, one would expect higher levels of\nprimary care use, lower levels of specialist use that could be\nprovided in primary care settings, lower levels of unmet\nneed for care, and lower levels of inpatient stays and ED\nvisits for ambulatory care sensitive conditions, and, as a\nresult, reduced expenditures associated with those changes.\nNonetheless, incentive structures created by managed care\norganizations may not always result in intended/desired\noutcomes.\nThere are characteristics of states' Medicaid programs\nthat may lead to outcomes that are inconsistent with conven-\ntional managed care theory. The largest factor, perhaps, is\nthe programs' low reimbursement rates. Low rates, com-\nbined with incentives to reduce expenditures within man-\naged care organizations, could lead to reductions in\nappropriate access to care and/or quality of care should it\nlimit the number and/or quality of providers available (e.g.,\nnarrow limits on number or type of prescription drugs or\nspecialist care). Furthermore, reductions in appropriate care\ncould eventually lead to more high-cost care (e.g., inpatient\nand/or ED care). Furthermore, the opportunities for both\nmore cost-effective and lower cost care delivery will depend\non a given state's starting point. That is, states with low\nreimbursement rates and/or efficient care delivery systems\nwill offer fewer opportunities for changes that generate\nreduced expenditures. Finally, specific incentives faced by\nproviders and hospitals, defined by managed care organiza-\ntions, are not the same across organizations and may impact\npopulations in different ways as demonstrated in the work\nby Marton et al.9\nResults in this study for non-SSI adult enrollees are quali-\ntatively consistent with those in the work by Herring and\nAdams.5 If enrollees are more likely to utilize the outpatient\nED, along with no perceptible decrease in general doctor\nand/or specialist visits as MMC penetration increases, enroll-\nees may not necessarily experience less access to care.\nHowever, it is not clear that this would improve the welfare\nof enrollees. Herring and Adams,5 who studied the SSI and\nnon-SSI nonelderly populations together (including chil-\ndren), found that increased MMC penetration associates with\nmedical care use patterns which the authors interpret as not\nwelfare improving--such as increased reliance on the ED for\na usual source of care, and increased number of ED visits.\nFinally, the lack of effect of MMC on Medicaid expenditures\nin our work is also consistent with these authors' research, as\nwell as more recent work by Duggan and Hayford.6\nTaken together, these results raise concerns about the fea-\nsibility of states achieving their goals of controlling health\ncare expenditures and improving care by expanding use of\nMMC. The greatest gains for states may be administrative\ngains and budget predictability rather than either reduced\nexpenditures or improved access.\nThe implication of these findings are of particular concern\nfor the SSI population, given their greater health care needs\nand higher health care expenditures; however, more research\nwith larger sample sizes is needed to more fully address the\nimplications of MMC for this subpopulation. Given the limi-\ntations of national data sources for the SSI population, this\nwork highlights the need for state-specific studies that could\nprovide the sample size needed to better assess the implica-\ntions of MMC for these vulnerable adults. Recent work by\nMarton et al.,9 who study children in 2 managed care plans in\nKentucky, is a step in this direction. However, further work\nthat focuses on the disabled, adults, and additional states is\nneeded. In addition, future work would benefit from going\nbeyond the general measures available in MEPS to consider\nadditional dimensions of care. For example, quality of care\nand patient experiences based on the Healthcare Effectiveness\nData and Information Set (HEDIS), or the Consumer\nAssessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS),\ncould be insightful.\nOur findings for the non-SSI population will help to\ninform the trend toward medical homes and accountable care\norganizations (ACOs). That is, to the extent that medical\nhomes and ACOs in Medicaid are based on the MMC model,\nthe benefits generated from these alternatives may also be\nlimited. Silow-Carroll et al.,3 however, highlight that the\nACO model with its focus on greater integration and coordi-\nnation of care, and greater emphasis on high-risk individuals,\ncould offer greater improvements in care than have been\ngenerated by the traditional MMC model to date. These\nauthors also note that many managed care organizations,\nincluding MMC organizations, are shifting toward the ACO\nmodel. Consequently, if the ACO model is more successful\nin achieving its intended benefits than the current MMC\nmodel, such a move could improve MMC. Going forward, it\nwill be important to study whetherACOs and medical homes,\nwhether stand-alone models or models developed as part of\nMMC plans, can produce the improvements over fee-for-\nservice Medicaid that to date have largely proven elusive\nwith MMC.\nAppendix\nTable A1.
