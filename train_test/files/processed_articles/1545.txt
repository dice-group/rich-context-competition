The purpose of this study was to examine the epide-\nmiologic patterns of anesthesia-related deaths at the national\nlevel.\nMethods: The authors searched the International Classifica-\ntion of Diseases, 10th Revision manuals for codes specifically\nrelated to anesthesia/anesthetics. These codes were used to\nidentify anesthesia-related deaths from the US multiple-cause-\nsia-related deaths were calculated based on population and hos-\npital surgical discharge data.\nResults: The authors identified 46 anesthesia/anesthetic\ncodes, including complications of anesthesia during preg-\nable to overdose of anesthetics; 42.5% were attributable to\nadverse effects of anesthetics in therapeutic use; 3.6% were\nattributable to complications of anesthesia during preg-\nnancy, labor, and puerperium; and 7.3% were attributable to\nother complications of anesthesia. Anesthesia complications\nThe estimated rates from anesthesia-related deaths were 1.1\nper million population per year (1.45 for males and 0.77 for\nfemales) and 8.2 per million hospital surgical discharges\n(11.7 for men and 6.5 for women). The highest death rates\nwere found in persons aged 85 yr and older.\nConclusion: Each year in the United States, anesthesia/anes-\nthetics are reported as the underlying cause in approximately\n34 deaths and contributing factors in another 281 deaths, with\nexcess mortality risk in the elderly and men.\nMORTALITY risk associated with anesthesia has been the\nsubject of extensive research for many decades.1\u00ad5 In a\nlandmark study involving 10 academic medical centers and\n1952, Beecher and Todd6 found that the anesthesia-related\nmarkedly by anesthetic agents, types of providers, and\npatient characteristics. Based on their study results,\nBeecher and Todd estimated that the annual number of\nanesthesia-related deaths in the United States was more\nwas more than twice the mortality attributable to poliomy-\nelitis at that time. The report by Beecher and Todd helped\nto identify anesthesia safety as a public health problem and\nspawned many follow-up studies in the United States7\u00ad10\nand other countries.11\u00ad14 This intense research effort has\nplayed an important role in the continuing improvement of\nanesthesia safety. In the advent of new anesthesia tech-\nniques, drugs, and enhanced training, anesthesia mortality\nrisk has declined from approximately 1 death in 1000\nIt is noteworthy that contemporary estimates of anesthe-\nsia mortality risk are based on studies conducted in Europe,\nJapan, and Australia.17\u00ad20 The paucity of anesthesia mortal-\nity studies in the United States in recent years is com-\npounded by several factors. First, improvement in anesthe-\nsia safety has made anesthesia-related deaths rare events,\nand studying rare events usually requires large sample sizes\nand considerable resources. Second, there is not an estab-\nlished national surveillance data system for monitoring an-\nesthesia mortality. Last, clinical practice of anesthesia has\nexpanded so much that it is extremely difficult to gather\nexposure data. It is estimated that most surgical anesthesia\nprocedures are now performed in ambulatory care set-\ntings.21,22 The use of anesthesia for therapeutic and diag-\nnostic purposes is also on the rise.23\nAfter the 1999 publication of the Institute of Medicine's\nreport on medical error,24 patient safety has become a\npriority area of health services research. To facilitate the\nmeasurement of patient safety and the evaluation of inter-\nvention programs, the Agency for Healthcare Research and\nQuality developed more than 20 patient safety indicators\nfor use with routinely collected hospital inpatient dis-\ncharge data. Each indicator refers to a group of complica-\ntions or adverse events identified through specific Interna-\ntional Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical\nModification codes.25 The first indicator, purportedly mea-\nsuring the safety of anesthesia, is limited to adverse effects\nof anesthetics in therapeutic use and overdose of anesthet-\nThis article has an accompanying Editorial View.

Complications of anesthesia during labor and delivery\nand systemic complications, such as malignant hyperther-\nmia due to anesthesia, are not included. The objectives of\nthis study are to develop a comprehensive set of anesthesia\nsafety indicators based on the latest version of the Interna-\ntional Classification of Diseases and to apply these indica-\ntors to a national data system for understanding the epide-\nmiology of anesthesia-related mortality.\nMaterials and Methods\nThe study protocol was reviewed and approved for\nexemption of informed consent by the Columbia Univer-\nsity Institutional Review Board, New York, New York.\nThe International Statistical Classification of Diseases\nand Related Health Problems (ICD) is the standard\nclassification system for recording and reporting dis-\neases, injuries, and other health conditions.26 Sponsored\nby the World Health Organization, this disease classifica-\ntion system is revised periodically and used by many\ncountries for the compilation of mortality and morbidity\ndata. It also serves as the basis for international compar-\nison of health statistics. The 10th revision (ICD-10) was\nimplemented for coding and classifying mortality data\nfrom death certificates in the United States as of January\n1, 1999. For the purpose of the current study, we devel-\noped a list of ICD-10 codes for medical conditions re-\nlated to anesthesia or anesthetics (table 1). These codes\nwere identified by screening all the chapters of ICD-10\nand informed by a thorough review of the research\nliterature pertaining to anesthesia mortality and ICD.\nIn previous studies,6,18 anesthesia-related deaths were\nusually divided into two groups based on clinical judgment:\ndeaths caused primarily by anesthesia and deaths in which\nanesthesia played a partial role. In this study, the role\nanesthesia played in the death was based on the causal\nchain of events leading to death as identified by the order\non the death certificate and ICD coding guidelines. Anes-\nthesia-related deaths were operationally defined as deaths\nthat included one of the anesthesia-related codes (table 1)\nas the underlying cause of death or included at least one\nanesthesia-related code as a listed cause among the multiple\ncauses of death. We grouped the identified ICD-10 codes\ninto four categories: (1) complications of anesthesia during\npregnancy, labor, and puerperium; (2) overdose of anes-\nthetics (exclusive of abuse of these substances); (3) adverse\neffects of anesthetics in therapeutic use; and (4) other\ncomplications of anesthesia in surgical and medical care\n(table 1). In 5% of the anesthesia-related deaths, there was\nmore than one anesthesia-related ICD-10 code in the multiple\ncauses. For the purposes of this analysis, the death was cate-\ngorized into the first listed ICD-10 code included in table 1.\nData Sources\nMortality data for this study came from the multiple-\ncause-of-death data files of the National Vital Statistics Sys-\ntem, maintained by the National Center for Health Statis-\ntics.# Deaths were limited to those occurring within the\nUnited States. US citizens and military personnel who died\noutside of the United States are not included. The mortality\ndata files are based on death certificates compiled by indi-\nvidual states and contain one record for each decedent.\nData collected from the death certificate include informa-\ntion about the decedent's demographic characteristics and\ncauses of death. Up to 20 ICD-10 codes are recorded for\neach death. The underlying cause of death is selected from\namong all listed causes as the medical condition or the\ncircumstance that triggered the chain of morbid events\nleading directly to death, and a contributing cause is a\nmedical condition that aggravated the morbid sequence\nresulting in the fatality.27\nUsing the ICD-10 codes listed in table 1 and the multiple-\ntified anesthesia-related deaths. The records for these anes-\nthesia-related deaths served as the mortality data for this study.\nStatistical Analysis\nDeath rates were computed in two ways. First, we cal-\nculated the annual rates of anesthesia-related deaths per\nmillion population using data from the US Census Bureau\nfor the study period. The annualized population-based\ndeath rate is a widely accepted public health measure,\nreflecting the portion of the general population that dies of\na given health problem each year. Second, we estimated\nthe risk of hospital anesthesia-related mortality based on\nthe number of anesthesia-related deaths that occurred in\nhospitals as inpatients as recorded on the death certificate\nand national estimates of hospital surgical discharges. Na-\ntional estimates of hospital surgical discharges for the study\nperiod were generated from the National Hospital Dis-\ncharge Survey using the defined surgical procedural\ncodes28 and were used as a proxy measure of exposure to\nanesthesia among hospital inpatients.\nAlthough mortality data are not subject to sampling error,\nthey may be affected by random variation. Assuming that\ndeaths follow a Poisson probability distribution, the SE\nassociated with the number of deaths is the square root of\nthe number of deaths.29 The National Hospital Discharge\nSurvey data were based on a multistage random sampling\nscheme, and the national estimate of the annual number of\nhospital discharges with a surgical procedure had a relative\nSE of approximately 4%.28 The SEs were calculated using\nSUDAAN release 9.0.1 (Research Triangle Institute, Re-\nsearch Triangle Park, NC).\n# Centers for Disease Control, National Center for Health Statistics: Vital Statistics\nData.

For both sexes, the lowest rate was\nfound in children aged 5\u00ad14 yr, and the highest rate was\nfound in those aged 85 yr or older. Males had higher\ndeath rates than females throughout the life span, and\nthe gap between sexes was especially pronounced in\nyoung and middle-age adults (fig. 2).\nMortality Risk among Surgical Inpatients\nThere were an estimated 105.7 million surgical dis-\ncharges from US hospitals during the study period. Of\ntals, 348 died in ambulatory care settings as outpatients,\nfacilities, 315 died at nursing homes or long-term care\nfacilities, 327 died in other places, and for 6, the place of\ndeath was unknown. The estimated mortality risk from\nanesthesia complications for inpatients was 8.2 (867/\nmillion hospital surgical discharges (11.7 [95% confi-\ndence interval 5.5\u00ad7.0] for women). The age pattern in\nmortality risk generally followed the pattern in popula-\ntion-based death rates, with substantially increased risk\nin the elderly (fig. 3).\nDiscussion\nSince the first release of the patient safety indicators in\n2001, a number of studies have assessed the utility of the\nindividual indicators and in different patient groups.30\u00ad34\nAs a screening tool for identifying potential patient safety\nproblems at the hospital level, patient safety indicators\nare found to be clinically relevant, effective, and effi-\ncient. None of these studies, however, has specifically\nTable 2.

As\npart of our effort to close this research gap, we devel-\noped four anesthesia safety indicators based on the latest\nversion of the ICD. These indicators measure more com-\nplications and adverse events of anesthesia/anesthetics\nthan the one proposed by the Agency for Healthcare\nResearch and Quality25 and can be used to address the\nmortality risk. Specifically, we have added a category of\ncomplications of obstetric anesthesia, and a category of\nsystemic complications that are rare occurrences but are\nof special concern to anesthesiologists, such as shock\ndue to anesthesia, malignant hyperthermia due to anes-\nthesia, and failed or difficult intubation. The US Depart-\nment of Health and Human Services has proposed to\nCongress to adopt a clinical modification of the ICD-10\ncodes in reporting clinical diagnoses and procedures by\nOctober 2011.** The anesthesia safety indicators devel-\noped in this study need to be validated when ICD-10\nClinical Modification\u00adcoded health care utilization data\nbecome available.\nOther researchers have used ICD-9 codes in studies of\nanesthesia morbidity and mortality.35,36 Our application\nof the anesthesia safety indicators to the ICD-10\u00adcoded\nmultiple-cause-of-death data files produced several nota-\nble findings. First, our results indicate that the numbers\nof anesthesia-related deaths in the United States averaged\nApproximately 11% of these deaths were caused primar-\nily by anesthesia/anesthetics.

First,\nthe anesthesia safety indicators developed in this study\nare based on a limited number of ICD-10 codes, which\ncapture only the death certificates in which an anesthe-\nsia complication or adverse event was listed among the\nmultiple causes of death. This limitation can be aggra-\nvated when the indicators are applied to hospital dis-\ncharge data to study anesthesia-related morbidity, be-\ncause clinical documentation of complications may vary\nwith hospitals and the severity of complications.\nSecond, our data on anesthesia-related mortality came\nsolely from the multiple-cause-of-death data files of the\nNational Vital Statistics System. As the most authoritative\nsource of national mortality data in the United States, the\nmultiple-cause-of-death data files are known for their\ncompleteness of data ascertainment; uniformity in for-\nmat and content; and standardized protocols for report-\ning, coding, and processing.39 To reduce coding errors,\nthe National Center for Health Statistics uses automated\ncoding systems in combination with manual checking.\nIn the past decade, the National Center for Health Sta-\ntistics implemented a series of interventional programs\n(e.g., clearer instructions for data reporting and process-\ning, more timely filing of amendments, electronic death\nregistration, querying the states about specific data\nitems).39 Nevertheless, the validity and reliability of the\nmultiple-cause-of-death data remain a concern. Although\nFig. 2. Annual anesthesia-related death\nrates per million population by sex,\nprevious research has shown a high reliability of the\nmultiple-cause-of-death data for some diseases (such as\ncancer and external causes),40 their sensitivity and spec-\nificity for detecting anesthesia-related deaths have not\nbeen rigorously examined. It is likely that the case defi-\nnition we used in this study may have missed a portion\nof anesthesia-related mortality, particularly those deaths\nin which complications and adverse events of anesthe-\nsia/anesthetics played only a contributory role. On the\nother hand, some of the deaths associated with anesthet-\nics or analgesics identified through the ICD-10 codes\nmay not be related to anesthesia practice.\nFinally, we based our estimates of death rates on pop-\nulation data and mortality risk on hospital surgical dis-\ncharges. The population-based rates are valuable from a\npublic health perspective but should be further refined\nin future studies. Specifically, deaths from complications\nof anesthesia during pregnancy, labor, and puerperium\nare confined to women of reproductive age; therefore,\nthe mortality risk should be estimated using age- and\nsex-appropriate denominator data.\nOur estimate of anesthesia-related mortality risk for\nsurgical inpatients is also susceptible to biases. It is\nconceivable that some of the anesthesia-related deaths\noccurring in hospitals might have resulted from expo-\nsure in ambulatory care settings or from exposure in\nnonsurgical therapeutic and diagnostic procedures. In\naddition, it is possible that some deaths that occurred\noutside of hospitals may have been related to complica-\ntions from inpatient anesthesia. After a 10-yr hiatus, the\nNational Survey of Ambulatory Surgery from the National\nCenter for Health Statistics was fielded in 2006 with\nupdates to reflect the changing environment in ambula-\ntory surgery. The lack of a comprehensive data system\nmonitoring anesthesia exposure is a problem that has\nhindered research efforts in the United States and other\ncountries for many years. With the rapid growth of\nclinical anesthesia services, considering methods for on-\ngoing national surveillance for anesthesia exposure and\noutcomes is imperative.\nThe results of our study suggest that the United States\nhas experienced a 97% decrease in anesthesia-related\ndeath rates since the late 1940s and the mortality risk\nfrom complications and adverse events of anesthesia/\nanesthetics for surgical inpatients is similar to the reports\nstudy found that 42.5% of anesthesia-related deaths were\nattributable to adverse effects of anesthetics in therapeu-\ntic use. With the increased use of anesthesia outside of\nthe traditional operating room setting,21,22 continued\nmonitoring of the safety of anesthesia is warranted.\nThe authors thank Lois Fingerhut, M.A., Diane Makuc, Dr.P.H., and Jennifer\nMadans, Ph.D. (National Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention, Hyattsville, Maryland), for helpful comment on a previous\nversion of the manuscript.\nReferences\n1.
