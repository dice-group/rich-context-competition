NHANES, National Health and Nutrition Ex-\namination Survey; NCHS, National Center for Health Statistics;\nCDC, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; HHANES,\nHispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey; BMI, body\nmass index.\nOverweight among preschool children is a con-\ncern, because it may have long-term health conse-\nquences.1 Excess body weight in childhood is associ-\nated with overweight in adulthood,2,3 and excess\nbody fat, or obesity, is recognized as a health risk for\nadults.4 Obesity and overweight in childhood also\nhave been linked to subsequent morbidity and mor-\ntality in adulthood.5,6 Moreover, overweight pre-\nschoolers have been shown to have higher mean\nlevels of cholesterol than other children.7 The con-\ncern about overweight prevalence in preschoolers is\nheightened by recent increases in overweight among\nschool-aged children and adults. Overweight preva-\nlence increased among boys and girls 6 through 11\nyears of age from approximately 5% in 1963 through\nat least one third of adults in the United States are\noverweight.9\nThis article presents cross-sectional estimates of\noverweight prevalence for preschool children be-\ntween 2 months and 6 years of age in the United\nStates using weight adjusted for length or stature.\nCurrent estimates are from the third National Health\nand Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III)\ntrends in overweight are presented based on esti-\nmates from earlier NHANES.\nMETHODS\nNHANES III is a nationally representative sample of the total\ncivilian noninstitutionalized population in the 50 states and the\nDistrict of Columbia. NHANES III collected information on indi-\nviduals 2 months of age and older. The design was a stratified,\nmultistage probability sample based on selection of counties, city\nor suburban blocks, households, and persons within households.\nwhom received physical examinations. NHANES III was designed\nto sample large numbers of preschool children to facilitate revis-\ning the original10 National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and\nmodified11 NCHS/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n(CDC) growth charts for children. Mexican-American persons,\nblack persons, and persons older than 60 years were also over-\nsampled to have large enough sample sizes for subgroup compar-\nisons. Sample weights were used to adjust estimates back to the\nappropriate population distribution.12,13\nThe NHANES comprise a series of cross-sectional, nationally\nrepresentative examination surveys conducted by the NCHS of\nthe CDC. NHANES III is the seventh in the series, which began in\nsurvey to include preschool-aged children.14 NHANES II was\npopulations, the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-\nvey (HHANES), in three regions of the United States was con-\nFrom the Division of Health Examination Statistics, National Center for\nHealth Statistics/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Hyattsville,\nMaryland.\n*An officer in the Epidemic Intelligence Service of the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention.\nReprint requests to (C.L.O.) Division of Health Examination Statistics, Na-\ntional Center for Health Statistics/Centers for Disease Control and Preven-\nemy of Pediatrics.\nlation sampled in the HHANES was located entirely in the\nsouthwestern United States.16\nThe surveys included both a home interview and a standard-\nized physical examination conducted in a mobile examination\ncenter. A physical examination in the home was available for\ninfants 2 through 11 months of age. The physical examination\nincluded measurement of recumbent length, stature, and weight.\nIn NHANES III recumbent length was measured in children\nyounger than 4 years, and stature was measured in children 2\nyears and older. Children wore paper examination gowns, and\ninfants wore only diapers.\nThe sample of NHANES III included 8765 children 2 months\ninterviewed by proxy after informed consent was obtained from\nparents or guardians. Of the 8261 for whom interview data were\nobtained, 7784 (94%) were examined. The overall survey response\nNHANES III, 199 were excluded from this analysis because their\nlength or stature was above or below the range of the original\nNCHS growth charts (67 children) or they were missing stature,\nlength, or weight data (132 children). Between initial household\nscreening and the physical examination, 65 children reached 6\nyears of age, and 4 home-examined children reached 1 year of age\nbefore being examined and were excluded from these analyses.\nAnother 36 children had stature and length data that differed by 5\ncm or more and were also excluded. The analytic data set included\n7480 children 2 months through 5 years of age at the time of\nexamination.\nThe response rate is similar across the NHANES surveys and is\ncomparable or higher than other national health and nutrition\nsurveys.17 Trend estimates would not be affected by nonresponse,\nbecause the nonresponders would have had to be different in each\nsurvey. Nonresponse bias in NHANES III has been evaluated\nCurrent overweight prevalence from NHANES III was esti-\nmated by age at examination, sex, and race/ethnicity. Race/eth-\nnicity were reported by household members. Children were cat-\negorized as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican-\nAmerican, or other. Numbers for racial and ethnic groups in the\nother category were too small for meaningful analysis when con-\nsidered separately, but these persons were included in totals.\nTrend estimates based on all the surveys were estimated by age,\nsex, and race. Trend estimates were not estimated by race/ethnic-\nity, because Hispanic children cannot be separately identified in\nNHANES I. However, estimates were made for Mexican-Ameri-\ncan children in the HHANES and NHANES III.\nOverweight Definition\nThe definition of overweight among preschoolers is based on\nthe original NCHS weight-for-stature and weight-for-length ref-\nerence growth curves.10 In this analysis, weight-for-length curves\nwere used for children 2 years and younger, and weight-for-\nstature curves were used for children 2 through 5 years. Two-year-\nold children were compared with either curve depending on\nwhether they had stature or length measures. Some 2-year-old\nchildren in this sample had both measures and were included in\nthe prevalence estimates based on both weight-for-length and\nweight-for-stature.\nThe prevalence of overweight is defined as the percentage of\nchildren whose weight-for-stature or weight-for-length was above\nthe 95th percentile of the respective growth curve. Concern about\noverweight prevalence occurs when prevalence exceeds 5%. This\ndefinition of overweight is commonly used and recommended for\nThe 95th percentile is a conservative definition of overweight.\nInfants and preschoolers are in a dynamic state of growth in which\nbody size is continually in a state of flux. For this reason, it is\ndifficult to assign a single cutoff value to an age range.23 To\ncircumvent potential adverse effects of clinically misclassifying\nyouths as overweight, using the highest cutoff of the 95th percen-\ntile is prudent for children younger than 6 years. Among adults,\n85th percentile cutoffs are often used24 and usually are based on\nbody mass index (BMI, kilograms per square meter). At this level\nin adults, unfavorable health outcomes begin to emerge.25 The\nCommittee on Clinical Guidelines for Overweight in Adolescent\nPreventive Services recommended the use of the 95th percentile of\nBMI to classify adolescents as overweight.26\nThe prevalence of overweight clearly depends on the selection\nof the reference population and the overweight criteria. The orig-\ninal NCHS and modified NCHS/CDC growth charts include sev-\neral different data sources. For preschool children 3 to 6 years of\nage the weight-for-height charts were based on weight and stature\ndata from the nationally representative NHANES I. For children\nfrom birth to 3 years, the weight-for-height charts were based on\nweight and recumbent length data from the Fels Research Institute\nwhite, middle-class children. The original NCHS and NCHS/CDC\ncharts represent smoothed versions of the data from the various\nsurveys. Consequently, the prevalence estimates for children 3 to\n6 years of age in NHANES I are not the expected 5%. Although\nthere is concern27,28 regarding the use of the original NCHS or\nNCHS/CDC growth charts, the choice of the reference will not\naffect trend estimates of overweight.\nA disjunction in the growth curves occurs at 2 years of age29\nbecause of the two different measures (stature and length) and\nbecause of the different data sources used to make the charts. It\nhas been suggested that the disjunction between infant and later\ncurves occurs because the Fels sample was \"actually taller or\nmeasured taller than the US sample.\"27 For these and other rea-\nsons, the original NCHS and modified NCHS/CDC growth charts\nare currently under revision.28\nBecause of rapid growth in children younger than 2 years, there\nis no agreed on definition of overweight in this age group. Con-\nsequently, the term overweight is used for children 2 through 5\nyears of age when compared with the weight-for-stature growth\ncharts. When children are compared with the weight-for-length\ngrowth charts, the percentage above the 95th percentile of the\nweight-for-length growth curve is presented.\nData Analysis\nData were analyzed using SAS30 and SUDAAN31 software pro-\ngrams. All analyses included sample weights that account for the\nunequal probabilities of selection attributable to oversampling and\nnonresponse (based on participation in the examination compo-\nnent of the survey). Standard errors (SE) were calculated with\nSUDAAN to account for the sample weights and complex sample\ndesign. Tests of significant differences in prevalence estimates\nwithin NHANES III by sex, age, and race/ethnicity were done\nusing multivariate logistic regression analysis. Trends in over-\nweight prevalence among surveys were modeled and tested using\nweighted least squares models for categorical data.32\nRESULTS\nCurrent Overweight Prevalence Estimates\nSample sizes are presented in Table 1 by age in\nTABLE 1. Number of Survey Participants in Sex and Age\nGroups by Survey\nAge,\nmo\nBoys\nGirls\n* NHANES indicates National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey; and HHANES, Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examina-\ntion Survey.\nmonths for each of the surveys. NHANES III over-\nsampled preschool-aged children and, therefore, has\nthe largest sample sizes.\nThe percentage of children younger than 1 and 1 to\n2 years who exceeded the 95th percentile on the\nweight-for-length growth curves is presented in Ta-\nble 2 overall and by age, sex, and racial/ethnic\ngroup. More than 5% of children younger than 1 and\n1 to 2 years by sex and race/ethnicity were above the\n95th percentile of weight-for-length. Among 1- to\n2-year-old children, the percentage above the 95th\npercentile on the weight-for-length growth curves\nwas 9.4%. It is unclear whether this relatively high\npercentage is a reflection of a problem in the popu-\nlation or an artifact of the growth charts for this age\nThere was no difference in the percentage above\nthe 95th percentile of the weight-for-length growth\ncurve between the younger than 1-year age group\nand the 1- to 2-year age group. However, within age\ngroups there were significant differences by gender\nand race/ethnicity. The percentage above the 95th\npercentile of weight-for-length was significantly\nhigher among girls than boys (P  .01) after account-\ning for differences by age group and race/ethnicity\nin a multivariate logistic regression model. The per-\ncentage above the 95th percentile was highest among\nMexican-American children, intermediate among\nnon-Hispanic black children, and lowest in non-His-\npanic white children. The differences in the percent-\nage above the 95th percentile between non-Hispanic\nwhite and non-Hispanic black children (P  .05) and\nbetween non-Hispanic white and Mexican-American\nchildren were statistically significant (P  .01).\nThe prevalence of overweight among children 2 to\n3 and 4 to 5 years of age based on weight-for-stature\nis presented in Table 3. In general, the prevalence of\noverweight was higher among children 4 to 5 years\nof age than among children 2 to 3 years of age. In\nboth age groups, the prevalence of overweight was\nlowest among non-Hispanic white boys. The preva-\nlence of overweight among girls was higher than\namong boys for all racial/ethnic and age groups.\nMore than 10% of all girls 4 to 5 years of age were\noverweight. Among the three different racial/ethnic\ngroups, Mexican-American children had the highest\nfor girls); non-Hispanic black children had interme-\ndiate prevalence, and non-Hispanic white children\nhad the lowest prevalence of overweight. Differences\nby age group, sex, and race/ethnicity were statisti-\ncally significant (P  .05) in multivariate logistic\nregression models. For children 2 to 3 years of age,\nprevalence estimates for most subgroups were near\nor less than 5%. There was one notable exception in\nwhich 10.5% of Mexican-American girls were over-\nweight.\nThe effect of the disjunction29 in the growth charts\nis evident in the NHANES III results. The percentage\nof 1- to 2-year-old children above the 95th percentile\non the weight-for-length growth curve (Table 2) was\ngroup was overweight based on weight-for-stature\n(Table 3). Although data are not shown, the preva-\nlence of overweight among 2-year-old children based\non weight-for-stature was substantially lower than\nthe prevalence among the same children based on\nweight-for-length.\nTrends Across National Surveys\nTable 4 contains estimates of the percentage of\nchildren overall and separately by race above the\n95th percentile of weight-for-length for NHANES I\nthrough III and for Mexican-American children in\nthe HHANES and NHANES III. Among children\nyounger than 24 months, estimates based on weight-\nfor-length showed an increase over time in the percent-\nage of children above the 95th percentile. This change\nwas greater for girls than boys. In the youngest age\ngroup (younger than 1 year) the percentage above the\nin NHANES III. Among girls 12 to 23 months of age,\nthe percentage above the 95th percentile increased from\n6.1% to 9.5% between NHANES I and NHANES III.\nAmong black girls 12 to 23 months of age, the percent-\nage above the 95th percentile of weight-for-length rose\nfrom 8.9% to 15.2%. There was no change in the per-\nmonths of age.\nTrends in national estimates of overweight preva-\nlence based on weight-for-stature are presented in\nTable 5.

We found\nthat during the past two decades in the United States,\nthere was no change in the prevalence of overweight\namong 2- to 3-year-old children, but there was an\nincrease among 4- to 5-year-old children, especially\nin girls. Currently 10.8% of 4- to 5-year-old girls are\noverweight. In addition, these data show that the\nprevalence of overweight among preschool children\nis higher among girls than boys and that overweight\nprevalence is highest among Mexican-American chil-\ndren. All of these results parallel what has been seen\namong older children and adults in the same sur-\nveys.8,9 These findings are based on highly reliable,\nstandardized measures of weight, stature, and length\nacross a series of national surveys.33,34\nThe higher prevalence of overweight among girls\nthan boys may be attributable to gender differences\nin behavior and is unlikely to be an artifact of the\ngrowth charts. In at least one study preschool boys\nwere found to be more physically active than pre-\nschool girls,35 and similar gender differences in over-\nTABLE 4.

The charts for this age group\nare based exclusively on white, middle-class chil-\ndren, and there is some evidence that growth differ-\nences do exist between these ethnic groups. How-\never, the use of the NCHS growth charts does\nprovide a uniform basis for estimating prevalence in\ndifferent populations, and measurements taken from\nprivileged children in developing countries in Africa,\nLatin America, and the Caribbean do not differ sig-\nnificantly from the NCHS reference population.38\u00ad42\nThe high prevalence of overweight found among\nMexican-American preschool children may have an\nenvironmental basis. Trend estimates within racial/\nethnic groups indicate an increase in overweight be-\ntween the HHANES and NHANES III for Mexican-\nAmerican children, strongly suggesting that environ-\nmental influences are affecting the observed increase\nin overweight. Furthermore, findings from the CDC\nPediatric Nutrition Surveillance System indicate that\nlow-income Hispanic children 2 to 4 years of age in\nthe United States showed a relative increase in over-\nThe difference in overweight prevalence between\nthe white and non-Hispanic white children in\nNHANES III may reflect demographic changes in the\npopulation of the United States. The prevalence of\noverweight among preschool-aged children is higher\nin the Mexican-American population, and this pop-\nulation makes up a greater percentage of the popu-\ntotal population estimates may reflect this change.\nOther researchers have also found a higher than\nexpected prevalence of overweight among preschool\nchildren. A cross-sectional study of urban kinder-\ngartners found excess overweight in 4- to 5-year-old\nchildren.37 In this study, the prevalence of over-\nweight was highest among Hispanic children, but\nthe overall growth of children was on par with the\nNCHS/CDC reference curve. In addition, among\nlow-income preschool children, overweight has been\nfound to be highest in Hispanic children compared\nwith white, black, and Asian children.45,46 The prev-\nalence of overweight among American Indian pre-\nschool children has also been shown to be in excess\nof 5% and increasing over time. Using data from the\nCDC Pediatric Nutrition Surveillance System, the\nprevalence of overweight among American Indian\npreschoolers 2 to 4 years of age was estimated at\nThe reasons for the increase in the prevalence of\noverweight among 4- to 5-year-old children are com-\nplex. Excess weight gain is ultimately a function of\nenergy intake exceeding energy expenditure, with\nsociocultural factors influencing lifestyle and diet\nchoices. However, the influence of bottle feeding,\nearly introduction of solid foods, balanced food se-\nlection, and other dietary practices on overweight in\npreschool-aged children is less clear. Dietary intake\ndata from the NHANESs suggest that mean energy\nand fat intakes among preschoolers have not in-\ncreased in the last 20 years.17 A review of the litera-\nture suggests that overweight among preschool chil-\ndren, as well as older children, may be associated\nless with increased energy intake and more with low\nphysical activity.48 In the Framingham Children's\nStudy, inactive preschool children gained substan-\ntially more subcutaneous fat by the time they\nreached first grade than did more active children.35\nSome researchers attribute the increasing prevalence\nof overweight among school-aged children to de-\ncreased physical activity as a result of television\nwatching.49 Others, however, insist that the link be-\ntween television and fatness is weak.50\nBecause of an increase in the percentage of high\nbirth weight infants, the relationship between birth\nweight and overweight during childhood has be-\nan increase in the proportion of high birth weight\nA small positive relationship has been found be-\ntween birth weight and BMI. However, there was no\nindication that an increase in the distribution of birth\nweights would lead to increased prevalence of over-\nweight during childhood.52\nCross-sectional surveys such as those used in this\nanalysis cannot investigate growth patterns in individ-\nuals. Moreover, the statistical definition of overweight\nis not based on risks of morbidity and mortality, and\ncross-sectional population-based estimates of over-\nweight do not account for variation associated with\ngenetic predisposition of the individual or familial pat-\nterns of overweight. In pediatric clinics, these are im-\nportant considerations and should be considered along\nwith an assessment of the individual based on serial\nmeasures of stature or length and weight over time.\nThe increasing prevalence of overweight among 4-\nto 5-year-old children indicates that prevention ac-\ntivities need to begin in the preschool years. As rec-\nommended in the Dietary Guidelines for Ameri-\ncans,25 these efforts include encouraging physical\nactivity to maintain a healthy weight, eating at least\nfive servings of fruits and vegetables per day, and\nafter the age of 2 years gradually decreasing dietary\nfat to a level of no more than 30% of energy. The\nCommittee on Nutrition of the American Academy\nof Pediatrics also recommends energy balance over\nspecific caloric intake restrictions for obese chil-\ndren.53 The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program\nfor Women, Infants, and Children and Head Start are\npotential avenues for educating low-income parents\nand children about healthy behavior choices such as\nlower-fat foods and physical activity. In addition,\npreschool and day care programs might include\nmore education related to diet and physical activity.\nIt is important to encourage healthy choices re-\ngarding diet and physical activity during the pre-\nschool years, because behavior patterns may begin in\nthese years.54,55 In addition, the normal growth of a\nchild is such that a child's adiposity during the first\nyear of life increases rapidly then decreases until\napproximately 6 years of age, when adiposity again\ndevelops. Young children who go through this \"ad-\niposity rebound\" early (4 and 5 years of age) have\nhigher adiposity in adulthood than children who go\nthrough the adiposity rebound later.56 The increase\nin the prevalence of overweight reported among\nadults, school-aged children, and preschoolers\nmakes it even more critical to influence behavior\namong preschoolers. It has been suggested that the\nmost successful treatment of preadolescent obesity is\nearly and regular treatment and that this preferred\napproach be adapted for prevention activities during\nthe preschool years.57 An observational study of\nwhite middle-class 3- to 5-year-old children found\nthat modifiable risk factors such as dietary intake\nand physical activity accounted for more of the vari-\nance in BMI in a 3-year period than did nonmodifi-\nable risk factors such as obese parents. The authors\nconcluded that encouragement of healthy diets and\nphysical activity can decrease weight gain in pre-\nPediatric practitioners should emphasize the im-\nportance of diet and physical activity as two impor-\ntant components of a healthy lifestyle, with consid-\nerably more emphasis on adequate amounts of\nphysical activity. Continued clinical, community,\nand national monitoring and surveillance of weight\namong preschool children is essential. To investigate\nfactors associated with overweight among preschool\nchildren further, assessments of dietary habits and\nactivity levels are needed for different sociocultural\ngroups.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis article is based on data from the National Nutrition Mon-\nitoring and Related Research Program.\nREFERENCES\n1.
