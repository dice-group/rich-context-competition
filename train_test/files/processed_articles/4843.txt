    "abstract": "Abstract\nNursing practice includes complex reasoning and multifaceted decision making with minimal standardized guidance in how\nto evaluate this phenomenon among nursing students. Learning outcomes related to the clinical reasoning process among\nnovice baccalaureate nursing students during a simulation experience were evaluated. Nursing process records were utilized\nto evaluate and foster the development of clinical reasoning in a high-fidelity medical-surgical simulation experience. Students\nwere unable to describe and process pertinent patient information appropriately prior to the simulation experience.\nStudents' ability to identify pertinent patient cues and plan appropriate patient care improved following the simulation. The\nlearning activity afforded a structured opportunity to identify cues, prioritize the proper course of nursing interventions, and\nengage in collaboration among peers. The simulation experience provides faculty insight into the students' clinical reasoning\nprocesses, while providing students with a clear framework for successfully accomplishing learning outcomes.\n",

Nurses are viewed as\nindependent practitioners with increased autonomy while\ncaring for increasingly complex and acutely ill patients.\nFurthermore, current mandates regarding quality improve-\nment and patient safety domains demand that even entry-\nlevel nurses must be proficient in accurate assessment and\nimplementation of timely, evidenced-based, and patient-\ncentered interventions.\nNursing practice includes multifaceted reasoning and\ncomplex decision making with minimal standardized guid-\nance in how to evaluate this process among nursing stu-\ndents. A common thread within nursing programs includes\npatient-care planning utilizing the nursing process.\nTherefore, providing students with scripted simulation sce-\nnarios integrating multiple diagnoses and varying patient\npresentations facilitates the development of clinical reason-\ning via utilization of the nursing process. This learning\nactivity involved pre- and post-simulation nursing process\nactivities evaluating students' ability to organize pertinent\npatient data and implement appropriate clinical care while\nutilizing simulation as an integral method of instruction.\nStudents' pre- and post-simulation nursing process records\nwere reviewed for accurate assessment, appropriate care\nplanning, and implementation of interventions.\nBackground\nClinical reasoning is an essential component to \"thinking\nlike a nurse,\" as is critical, creative, scientific, and formal\ncriterial reasoning (Benner, Sutphen, Leonard, & Day, 2010).\nAppropriate clinical reasoning skills are essential to compe-\ntence in nursing. Current practice requires that even new\ngraduates must be prepared to make difficult decisions for\npatients with multisystem dysfunction (Banning, 2008;\nreasoning is often used interchangeably with critical think-\ning and clinical judgment in the literature. Clinical reasoning\nis defined as \"the cognitive processes and strategies that\nnurses use to understand the significance of patient data, to\nidentify and diagnose actual or potential patient problems, to\nmake clinical decisions to assist in problem resolution, and\nto achieve positive patient outcomes\" (Fonteyn & Ritter,\ntion and the same set of circumstances, researchers have\nreported that clinical reasoning among experienced nurses\nvaries (Sedgwick, Grigg, & Dersch, 2014).\n1Bradley University, Peoria, IL, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nKelly Schwend, College of Education and Health Science, Bradley\nEmail: kschwend@fsmail.bradley.edu\nUtilization of the Nursing Process to\nFoster Clinical Reasoning During a\nSimulation Experience\nAmanda Lambie1, Kelly Schwend1, and Andrea Scholl1\n Keywords\nclinical reasoning, critical thinking, simulation, undergraduate, nursing students, nursing education, clinical judgment\n2 SAGE Open\nTherefore, nursing students require education for recog-\nnizing relevant patient cues and understanding how to make\nconnections between accurate assessment and patient out-\ncomes via utilization of the nursing process (Benner, 2001).\nA nurse's approach to critical thinking and reasoning is\nbelieved to affect the accuracy of the nursing diagnosis.\nThus, it is directly linked to influencing patient care and\noutcomes (Paans, Sermeus, Nieweg, Krijnen, & van der\nSchans, 2012). The development of critical thinking skills\nis multifaceted and encompasses several parameters of\nmetacognitive self-awareness. These include the ability to\nadapt to complex and varied situations, application of the-\nory to practice, self-motivation and enterprising behaviors,\nworking effectively with other members of the patient-care\nteam to accomplish group tasks, strategic thinking, and\nappropriate assessment of one's strengths and weaknesses\nThe interplay between critical thinking and clinical rea-\nsoning informs a student's clinical judgment. Faculty facili-\ntation of the development of student's critical thinking skills\nis guided by American Nurses Association (ANA) practice\nstandards, The Joint Commission Standards, Quality and\nSafety Education for Nurses competencies, and Institute of\nMedicine competencies. According to Alfaro-LeFevre\n(2013), components of reasoning within the clinical setting\ninclude the following:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Diagnostic reasoning (applying nursing process to\ndetermine, prevent, and manage patient problems)\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Problem solving, decision making, and judgment\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Patient, caregiver, and community safety and welfare\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Patient- and family-centered care\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Moral and ethical reasoning\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Applying evidence-based practice\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Teamwork and collaboration\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Clinical teaching and learning\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Using and creating electronic medical date (informatics)\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Self-improvement, stress management\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Quality improvement (improving outcomes and care\ndelivery systems).\nSimulation experiences provide a setting in which nursing\nstudents verbally practice the appropriate nursing care of\npatients and families in specific clinical situations. Educators\nwho utilize simulation are able to highlight the students'\npoints of growth and meaning within a patient scenario,\nwhile shielding the student in the safety of a virtual clinical\nenvironment. Simulations allow nursing students to function\nin the role of a nurse via the application of evidence-based\nknowledge, implementation of clinical reasoning and judg-\nment, and the development of skilled knowhow (Benner\net al., 2010). Objective evidence of the student's ability to\ntransfer theoretical knowledge and incorporate into clinical\npractice is crucial. This transference of skill-based knowl-\nedge can be evaluated via nursing process records, which\nutilize the development of nursing diagnoses and formula-\ntion of a plan of care.\nSimulation Experience\nTo expand the body of literature linking simulation experi-\nences of first-year student nurses to the development of criti-\ncal thinking knowledge and clinical reasoning through\napplication of appropriate utilization of the nursing process,\na simulation learning activity was implemented. This article\ndescribes and discusses the benefits of utilizing simulation\nfor fostering clinical reasoning. The evaluation of the learn-\ning activity included a comparison of pre- and post-simula-\ntion clinical reasoning assignments (nursing process records/\nnursing care plans) of sophomore undergraduate baccalaure-\nate nursing students. Nursing faculty facilitating the simula-\ntion experience evaluated assignments.\nPatient-care planning required students to gather all\nknown subjective and objective patient information, high-\nlight the abnormal findings, and analyze the data. Then,\nthrough critical reasoning, the student group arrived at a con-\nsensus on the patient's priority problem and formulated what\nthey postulated as the appropriate nursing diagnosis. The stu-\ndents could then discuss and record the patient's treatment\ngoals and the nursing interventions required to evaluate their\nown performance and ensure that the patient's treatment\ngoals were met. The nursing process record assignment\nrequired students to document the rationale for choosing\nnursing interventions and allowed the faculty a window into\nthe students' clinical reasoning and decision-making\nprocesses.\nThirty-six second-semester sophomore baccalaureate\nnursing students participated in the simulation as a required\nactivity toward completion of their medical-surgical practi-\ncum rotation. The simulation experience utilized for this\nlearning activity was designed to facilitate the transition of\nnursing theory to clinical practice. Each simulation experi-\nence, including preparation, interactive simulation, and\ndebriefing, occurred in the department of nursing simulation\nlab. The duration of experience was approximately 4 hr.\nThe nursing program implements simulation as a compo-\nnent of the students'required practicum hours. Pre- and post-\nnursing process record assignments were completed as the\nwritten assignment component of the simulation experience\nand were collected for review. Simulation was a non-graded\nassignment. Performance in the simulation experience had\nno effect on the students' final clinical course grade.\nPre-Briefing\nStudents were provided with learning objectives for the\nexperience and a post-operative patient case study, which\nincluded a history and physical to review in preparation of\nthe simulation experience (see Appendix A). They were also\ninstructed to review theoretical content in the course text\nLambie et al. 3\nrelated to post-operative nursing care. Prior to entering the\nsimulated patient's room, students received a brief overview\nof the simulation day. Students were provided with a nursing\nprocess record and were asked to utilize the nursing process\nand the case study to complete the nursing process record\n(see Appendix B). Students completed the nursing process\nrecord as a group of four. These de-identified nursing process\nrecords were collected and marked \"pre.\" Students were then\nbrought to the simulated patient's room where they partici-\npated in the planned simulation scenario.\nDebriefing\nDebriefing immediately followed the completion of the sim-\nulation scenario. Students were directed to an adjoining\nclassroom where they were asked to complete a new nursing\nprocess record marked \"post.\" Students were not allowed to\naccess any reference materials for the assignment. They were\ninstructed to collaborate and complete the care plan based\nupon their collective simulation experiences. The faculty\nthen collected the \"post\" nursing process record, and simula-\ntion debriefing occurred.\nResults\nNursing process records were utilized to assess the evolution of\nclinical reasoning prior to and following exposure to a high-\nfidelity post-operative simulation experience. The nursing pro-\ncess record reflects the components of the clinical reasoning\nmodel (Hoffman, 2007), which details the thinking strategies\nof both novice and experienced nurses during realistic patient-\ncare scenarios, and has been utilized in studies measuring the\ndevelopment of clinical reasoning (Levett-Jones et al., 2010).\nIn addition, debriefing of participants occurred, and open-\nended questions related to student actions during the simula-\ntion were presented. The student responses on their\npost-simulation care plan assignment guided the debriefing\nsession. Written forms of debriefing and reflection, such as\ncare plan assignments, allowed nursing students to process\ntheir simulation experience and provided the instructor\ninsight into the students' cognitive learning (Park et al.,\nincorporated into simulation, promotes the self-awareness\nrequired for the development of clinical judgment, thus fos-\ntering quality patient care. Furthermore, post-simulation\ndebriefing and reflection, where select patient responses that\noccurred during the simulation are reviewed, allow for dis-\ncussion of the natural progression of nursing actions and\ntheir potential adverse effects.\nAs a way to evaluate the nursing process records, faculty\nutilized an evaluative table consisting of elements of the care\nplanning process as described by Carpenito-Moyet (2010).\nIn addition, clinical reasoning was identified subjectively\nusing the clinical reasoning model (Levett-Jones et al.,\n2010). Variability in interpretation of the students' nursing\nprocess records was eliminated as only one faculty member\nevaluated the assignments. Correlation of the components of\nthe clinical reasoning model and the students' nursing care\nplans are outlined in Table 1.\nWhen evaluating the assignments, there were notable dif-\nferences between the pre- and post-simulation nursing pro-\ncess records. Pre-simulation nursing process records reflected\na lack of relevant patient cues. Relevant patient cues are nec-\nessary to anticipate potential outcomes and negative sequelae.\nFaculty observed that the highest patient priority was identi-\nfied incorrectly among patient cues, leading to the develop-\nment of an inappropriate course of nursing action. Nearly\nhalf of the students demonstrated correct correlation of\nselected patient outcome criteria or goals relevant to the\npatient's actual nursing needs. Approximately one third of\nstudents correctly processed assessment information and\nidentified pertinent patient cues and relevant clinical identi-\nfiers. Identification of relevant patient cues would have led\nto a more optimal course of nursing actions.\nPost-simulation nursing process records revealed signifi-\ncant improvement with selection of patient outcome criteria\nor goals and their correlation and relevance to the patient's\nactual health needs. All students were able to achieve this\nobjective upon completion of the simulation. Following the\nsimulation experience, students' ability to process assess-\nment information and identify pertinent patient cues and rel-\nevant clinical identifiers increased. The post-simulation\nnursing process records demonstrate that simulation was an\nintegral component to the refinement of the students' ability\nto translate theory to practice through clinical reasoning. The\nsimulation experience has the potential to provide students\nwith a clear framework for successfully accomplishing learn-\ning outcomes related to the nursing process.\nDiscussion\nStudents' exposure to simulation is vital to foster clinical rea-\nsoning and facilitate the development of critical thinking skills\nin nursing. The pre-simulation nursing process records identi-\nfied a relevant learning need in nursing education. Through\nthe participation in a simulation experience, students engaged\nin active learning and could immediately verbalize under-\nstanding of knowledge deficits related to identifying relevant\npatient cues and the ability to anticipate various potential out-\ncomes for the patient. Nursing students had the opportunity to\nimmediately remediate through post-simulation nursing pro-\ncess records. Faculty provided guidance and constructive\nfeedback in a safe and controlled learning environment. The\nsimulation experience provides the opportunity to develop and\nrefine students' utilization of the nursing process.\nLimitations\nLimitations include that the simulation was implemented by\nthe same faculty member, in the same simulation scenario,\n4 SAGE Open\nand at the same university with a small sample, over the\ncourse of one semester. In addition, the sample consisted of\nprimarily Caucasian female nursing students. Therefore,\ngeneralizability of the findings may be limited. The evalua-\ntion of the nursing process records was potentially strength-\nened because only one faculty member reviewed them.\nHowever, the evaluation was subjective in nature, therefore\nbias may have existed.\nImplications\nIt is incumbent upon nursing faculty to foster students'clinical\nreasoning skills. The American Association of Colleges of\nNursing (AACN) has outlined recommendations for schools\nof nursing detailing the educational requirements necessary to\nprovide quality patient care (Barton, Armstrong, Prehelm,\nGelmon, & Andrus, 2009). Therefore, clinical reasoning must\nbe embedded throughout the nursing curriculum. The simula-\ntion experience provides an opportunity to utilize the nursing\nprocess and strengthen the link between theory and clinical\npractice. Faculty must be able to integrate domains of profes-\nsional practice, such as communication and collaboration,\npatient-centered care, and best practices. Recommendations\nfor faculty include development and analysis of instrumenta-\ntion to evaluate the attributes of nursing students'nursing pro-\ncess records and clinical reasoning ability. Schools of nursing\nshould incorporate simulation at every level of nursing\neducation as a means of facilitating clinical reasoning abilities,\nthereby potentially improving nursing students'ability to posi-\ntively affect patient care. Replication of this simulation experi-\nence utilizing various scenarios is warranted to further the\nresearch base in nursing education and clinical reasoning.\nAppendix A\nGuidelines for SimLab Experience\nI.
