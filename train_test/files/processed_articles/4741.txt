    "abstract": "Abstract. In this paper aesthetic experience is defined as an experience qualitatively different from\neveryday experience and similar to other exceptional states of mind. Three crucial characteristics of\naesthetic experience are discussed: fascination with an aesthetic object (high arousal and attention),\nappraisal of the symbolic reality of an object (high cognitive engagement), and a strong feeling of unity\nwith the object of aesthetic fascination and aesthetic appraisal. In a proposed model, two parallel\nlevels of aesthetic information processing are proposed. On the first level two sub-levels of narrative\nare processed, story (theme) and symbolism (deeper meanings). The second level includes two\nsub-levels, perceptual associations (implicit meanings of object's physical features) and detection of\ncompositional regularities. Two sub-levels are defined as crucial for aesthetic experience, appraisal\nof symbolism and compositional regularities. These sub-levels require some specific cognitive and\npersonality dispositions, such as expertise, creative thinking, and openness to experience. Finally,\nfeedback of emotional processing is included in our model: appraisals of everyday emotions are\nspecified as a matter of narrative content (eg, empathy with characters), whereas the aesthetic\nemotion is defined as an affective evaluation in the process of symbolism appraisal or the detection\nof compositional regularities.\n",

The purpose\nof the present paper is to provide a more explicit definition of this phenomenon and to\npropose a tentative model of underlying motivational, cognitive, and emotional processes\nand dispositions.\nGenerally, aesthetic experience can be defined as a special state of mind that is quali-\ntatively different from the everyday experience. According to Cupchik and Winston (1996),\naesthetic experience is a psychological process in which the attention is focused on the object\nwhile all other objects, events, and everyday concerns are suppressed. Similarly, Ognjenovi\u00b4\nc\n(1997) defined aesthetic experience as a special kind of subject-object relationship in which\na particular object strongly engages the subject's mind, shadowing all other surrounding\nobjects and events. In both definitions, aesthetic situations and objects of aesthetic interest\nare specified as fundamentally different from everyday situations and objects of everyday\nuse. Perhaps the best example of this contrast is Picasso's famous Bull's Head, an artistic\nconstruction made of a bicycle seat and handlebars. Seen from the everyday (pragmatic)\nperspective, the handlebars and the seat are experienced as parts of a bicycle with specific\nfunctions (for seating and governing). Also, as with all other objects of everyday use, they can\nbe judged as more or less beautiful, elegant, well designed, and the like. However, only when\nthey lose their everyday pragmatic meaning (as bicycle parts) and transcend into the new\nsymbolic level of reality (combination into a new whole, a bull's head), does the aesthetic\nexperience emerge.\nAccording to Apter (1984) the distinctive feature of aesthetic experience is that it is not\ngoal directed (ie, pragmatic), but focused more upon the activity itself (ie, self-rewarding).\n2 S Markovi\u00b4\nc\nIn their neuroimaging studies Cupchik and collaborators (Cupchik et al 2009) have shown\nthat distinct cortical areas were activated when the observers were oriented to the pragmatic\nand aesthetic aspects of the same paintings. They found that pragmatic orientation was\nassociated with the higher activation of the right fusiform gyrus (this area was associated\nwith the perception of specific categories of objects, including faces; cf Kanwisher et al 1997;\nMartin et al 1996; McCarthy et al 1997), whereas the aesthetic orientation corresponded\nto a higher activation of the left and right insula (these areas were involved in emotional\npre-frontal cortex (this area plays a role in the cognitive control and the higher-order self-\nreferential processes; cf Burgess et al 2007).\nIn our opinion aesthetic experience does not belong to the same class of phenomena as\naesthetic preference, liking, the judgment of beauty, and so on. Unlike aesthetic experience,\nwhich is an exceptional state of mind, liking and the judgment of beauty belong to the\ndomain of everyday experience with everyday objects (eg, human faces, bodies, clothing,\nbuildings, etc). However, beauty can be a generator of aesthetic experience, but only if\nit transcends its biological, psychological, and social functions and gets new `aesthetic'\nmeanings in the symbolic (`virtual') reality. Namely, in aesthetic experience the object of\nbeauty is not seen as a tool for the satisfaction of bodily needs (eg, appetitive and mating\nfunctions; cf Ramachandran and Hirstein 1999), but rather as a provocation of the higher\nlevel pleasures, such as pleasures of the mind (cf Kubovy 1999). In other words, to be a\npart of an aesthetic experience, beauty must transcend from its extrinsic (pragmatic) to\nintrinsic (aesthetic) values--that is, a beautiful object must become an object of beauty.\nAccording to this, even ugly things can elicit aesthetic experience (eg, aesthetic fascination\nwith deformation, monstrous, grotesque, morbid, horrible, and other kinds of ugliness; cf\nIn order to specify the distinctive characteristics of aesthetic experience, it will be useful\nto consider other similar phenomena of the exceptional or transcendental states of mind. In\nthe following paragraphs these phenomena will be shortly presented.\nAesthetic experience is similar to the phenomenon referred to by Czikszentmihalyi's\nconcept of flow or optimal mental processing (Cs\u00edkszentmih\u00e1lyi 1975, 1990). Flow is defined\nas an effortless mental energy flow caused by the awareness of congruence between incoming\ninformation and our goals. During this state of mind people are intensively immersed in what\nthey are doing, with strong involvement in the process of the activity. Similarly to aesthetic\nexperience, in this mental state attention is highly concentrated on a particular object or\nactivity, which induces a distortion of the sense of time and a loss of self-consciousness\nAesthetic experience is also closely related to Maslow's concept of peak experience\n(Maslow 1968). In peak experiences, attention is fully engaged and focused on a particular\nobject, while the object is seen as detached from its everyday purpose and usefulness. Like in\nthe state of flow, the person is self-transcending, self-forgetful, and disoriented in time and\nspace. Generally speaking, peak experiences can be identified in all states of mental focusing\non meditation, such as mindfulness (Kabat-Zinn 1998; Teasdale 1999). Also, it is close to\nspiritual transcendence, which is the feeling of connectedness and unity with other people,\nlife, nature, and the like (Piedmont 1999). Like in peak experience, in spiritual transcendence\npersons focus the world from a larger perspective, losing the immediate sense of time and\nspace.\nAesthetic experience can be associated with the concept of absorption proposed by\nTellegan and Atkinson (1974). Absorption is the disposition of having episodes of amplified\nattention that fully engage the subject's mental (perceptual, representational) and executive\nComponents of aesthetic experience 3\n(motor) resources. For instance, absorption can emerge when a person is watching movies or\ntheatre shows, reading novels, listening to music, observing paintings, and the like. In these\nsituations he or she loses awareness of the surrounding environment and becomes fully\nengaged in the symbolic (virtual) world, experiencing himself or herself as a part of this virtual\nworld. While Tellegan and Atkinson (1974) were interested in the individual differences in\nabsorption, some studies were focused on its stimulus constraints. For instance, Troscianko\nand collaborators (Troscianko et al in press [this issue]) found that big screens improved the\nviewer's feeling of being immersed, or feeling of 'presence', in a movie. The term presence\nwas defined as the illusion of being `in the movie' (ie, virtual aesthetic world) rather than in\nthe cinema (ie, real environment).\nKoestler (1970) put aesthetic experience in the framework of creative processes emerging\nin art, science, humour, and playing. According to Koestler, the creative act happens when\napparently incompatible conceptual frames are associated in a completely new whole, as\nwhen, for instance, the bicycle handlebars and seat are brought together in the Bull's Head.\nKoestler held that in the arts `incompatible' frames are juxtaposed (tolerance to ambiguity),\nin science they are fused into a new larger synthesis (apparently conflicting data become\nconcordant within a new general theoretical paradigm), and in humour and jokes they\nare reversed (unexpected transitions from one to another framework). These processes\ncorrespond to a `self-transcending' tendency in art and a `self-assertive' tendency in humour,\nwhereas in science these two tendencies are balanced. Finally, these states are accompanied\nwith exceptional feelings, such as the so-called Aha experience in intellectual insights and\nscientific discoveries (also known as the Eureka experience), Ah experience in art appreciation,\nand Ha-ha experience in humour (cf Koestler 1970).\n1.1 Aesthetic experience: summary of preliminary definitions\nIn the preliminary definitions of aesthetic experience and similar phenomena, three charac-\nteristics can be identified as crucial and distinctive.\n(1) The first characteristic refers to the motivational, orientational or attentive aspect\nof aesthetic experience. During the aesthetic experience persons are in the state of\nintense attention engagement and high vigilance; they are strongly focused on and\nfascinated with a particular object. They lose their self-consciousness, the awareness of\nthe surrounding environment, and the sense of time.\n(2) The second characteristic refers to the cognitive, that is, semantic, symbolic, and\nimaginative aspect of aesthetic experience: a person appraises the aesthetic objects\nand events as parts of a symbolic or `virtual' reality and transcends their everyday uses\nand meanings (eg, we `see' the bull's head, not the bicycle parts; in theatre we are worried\nabout the characters, not the actors, etc).\n(3) Finally, the third characteristic of aesthetic experience is affective. It refers to the\nexceptional emotional experience: a person has a strong and clear feeling of unity with\nthe object of aesthetic fascination and aesthetic appraisal.\n2 The structure of aesthetic experience\nIn the previous paragraphs the characteristics of aesthetic experience were derived from\nconceptual definitions and analyses. In our recent studies (Markovi\u00b4\nMarkovi\u00b4\nc 2006) similar characteristics of aesthetic experience were specified empirically.\nThrough the use of a production task, a set of descriptors of aesthetic experience was\nobtained: participants were asked to list the attributes which expressed their state of mind\nduring aesthetic experience of both artistic and non-artistic aesthetic objects (eg, natural\nscenes). In the study by Polovina and Markovi\u00b4\nc (2006) factor analyses of the ratings of\ndifferent sets of paintings on selected descriptors (ie, scales) revealed a single factor named\n4 S Markovi\u00b4\nc\nAesthetic Experience. This factor encompassed descriptors such as (ordered by loading)\nexceptional, fascinating, irresistible, eternal, profound, unique, unspeakable, and universal.\nIn the study by Markovi\u00b4\nc (2010), two factors were obtained, Aesthetic Experience and Affective\nTone. Aesthetic Experience included descriptors such as exceptional, profound, unique, awing,\ndelightful, fascinating, eternal, and unspeakable. Affective Tone was a bipolar factor defined\nby positive and negative emotional descriptors (positive pole: lovely, charming, cheerful,\netc; negative pole: scary, disgusting, hateful, etc). The results of the factor analyses clearly\nconfirmed our starting definition of aesthetic experience as a special kind of subject-object\nrelationship--that is, as a fascination with an object, appraisal of profound meanings of an\nobject, and a corresponding feeling of an exceptional relationship with an object.\nFurther analyses have shown that the factor Aesthetic Experience was relatively indepen-\ndent from the other aspects of the subjective experience of the paintings. For instance, the\nPromax rotation of the factors in the study by Markovi\u00b4\n= .11) between Aesthetic Experience and the second extracted factor, Affective Tone. In our\nother study (Polovina and Markovi\u00b4\nc 2006) the ratings of paintings on the Aesthetic Experience\nscales were correlated with the ratings on other previously specified dimensions of subjective\nexperience of various artistic and non-artistic visual stimuli (Markovi\u00b4\nc and Jankovi\u00b4\nMarkovi\u00b4\nc and Radonji\u00b4\nc 2008). Regression analysis showed that\nAesthetic Experience had a moderate, but significant correlation (r = .48) with the ratings on\nthe factor Arousal (scales: interesting, complex, imaginative, etc), whereas the correlations\nwith the ratings on other factors, such as Hedonic Tone (scales: pleasant, cheerful, warm,\netc) and Regularity (scales: harmonious, regular, real, etc) were very low (about zero) and\nnon-significant.\nThe results of the correlational analyses suggest that the aesthetic experience is not\nreducible to positive emotions or positive hedonic tone, but that it can be associated with\nboth pleasant (attractive) and unpleasant (aversive) paintings. This is in line with Silvia's idea\nthat aesthetic appraisal can include both positive emotions, such as pleasure, pride, and\nsurprise and negative emotions, such as hostile emotions (anger, disgust, and contempt),\nsome self-consciousness emotions (shame, guilt, regret, embarrassment), and some cognitive\nemotions (confusion) (cf Silvia 2009; see also Cooper and Silvia 2009; Silvia and Brown\n2007). On the other hand, some authors identified aesthetic feelings with either pleasurable\nemotions (cf Martindale and Moore 1988; Winkielman and Cacioppo 2001) or negative\nanalyses have also shown that aesthetic experience is not correlated with the experience\nof regularity and the compositional harmony of paintings. Many previous studies support\nthe possibility that both highly structured (eg, classicistic) and `chaotic' (eg, expressionistic)\npaintings can be experienced as highly fascinating, exceptional, and the like (cf Furnham\nZuckerman et al 1993). In order to avoid a possible misunderstanding, one must emphasize\nthat although aesthetic experience can be induced by both pleasurable and displeasurable\nobjects, aesthetic feelings themselves (eg, admiration, delight, awe etc) are basically positive\nas `pleasures of the mind' (cf Kubovy 1999). For instance, we can appraise the content of\nIbsen's novels as very negative (dark and depressive), but our appraisal of their sophisticated\nand perfectly articulated form can induce a positive and rewarding aesthetic feeling. Later in\nthis paper, the nature of aesthetic feeling and its relationship with other emotions will be\nelaborated in more details.\nFinally, correlational analysis has shown that the Aesthetic Experience is closest to the\nfactor Arousal, that is, the interest for the paintings: the greater the arousal, the greater the\nComponents of aesthetic experience 5\naesthetic fascination. Generally speaking, these results suggest that the object of aesthetic\nexperience can be both pleasant and unpleasant and both more or less regular, but it must\nbe arousing and interesting. The aesthetic effect of arousal was the central issue of Berlyne's\nmodel of relationship between preference, arousal and the so-called collative variables\n(complexity, uncertainty, novelty, ambiguity, etc): complex, irregular, and unusual stimuli\nhave greater arousing potential; they draw more attention and are experienced as more\ninteresting and attractive than simple, regular, and ordinary stimuli (Berlyne 1971, 1974).\nAesthetic fascination, as a part of aesthetic experience, is based on similar processes, but in\nthis case the attention, the vigilance, and the mental activity are particularly intense (high\nconcentration), more extensive (wide range of attention and mental activities), and longer-\nlasting (maintenance of vigilance). Aesthetic fascination will be more precisely specified\nin the following paragraphs, which concern the functional relationship between aesthetic\nfascination, appraisal, and feelings.\n3 The functional model of aesthetic experience\nAesthetic information processing is usually described as a multi-stage process. Many models\nagree on the notion that the process starts with stimulus input, then continues through\nseveral processing stages, which are connected to deeper memorial instances, and ends in\nthe final decision making, which is an evaluative judgment of the stimulus. For instance,\nOgnjenovi\u00b4\nc (1991) suggested that aesthetic information processing passes through three\nstages: two earlier stages are focused on two distinct categories of stimulus properties\n(symmetry and complexity), whereas the later stage elaborates a deeper semantic aspect of\nthe object. According to this model, an aesthetic response can be realized from each stage of\nprocessing, which explains the variability of aesthetic taste (eg, preference for simplicity vs.\npreference for complexity).\nParsons (1987) proposed a model of processing artworks based on the analysis of\ninterviews. He described five different ways of dealing with artworks, that is, five different\nstages of aesthetic processing that are to be understood as developmental stages: (a)\nfavouritism (content-oriented preference and personal taste), (b) preference for beauty and\nexplicit realism, (c) expressiveness (empathy with the artist's feelings), (d) focus on style and\nform, and (e) autonomy (appraisal of the underlying concepts and the autonomy of the\nartwork).\nAccording to Chatterjee (2003) visual information processing (perceptual analysis, group-\ning, and object recognition) elicits emotional processes, and the emotional processes send\nfeedback information into the perceptual and cognitive system via attentional mechanisms.\nChatterjee associated these processes with distinct brain regions, such as the visual cortex\n(occipital areas for early, and ventral for later visual processing stages); the anterior medial\ntemporal lobe, medial, and orbital cortices in the frontal lobe, and subcortical structures,\nwhich mediate emotions; and the dorsolateral frontal and medial frontal cortices, which are\ninvolved in aesthetic decision making.\nSimilarly, in the three-component model of aesthetic preference proposed by Nadal\nand collaborators (Nadal et al 2008), emotional and cognitive processes were put into the\nsame framework and associated with corresponding neural correlates. The first component\nencompasses two aspects of emotional response, such as the representation of the reward\nvalue of the stimulus (orbitofrontal cortex and caudate nucleus) and attentional regulation,\nwhich is associated with the awareness of the emotional state (anterior cingulate cortex). The\nsecond component refers to the enhancement of early visual processing (occipital, visual\ncortex), and the third component is decision-making (left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex).\n6 S Markovi\u00b4\nc\nFinally, the most comprehensive model of aesthetic information processing is the five-\nstage model proposed by Leder and collaborators (Leder et al 2004). The model includes the\nfollowing stages: (1) perceptual analysis (eg, processing of complexity, symmetry, etc); (2)\nimplicit memory integration (the processing of familiarity, prototypicality, etc); (3) explicit\nclassification (the processing of style and content); (4) cognitive mastering (art-specific versus\nself-related interpretations); and (5) evaluation (measuring of mastering success). One of the\nmost important points in this model is a feedback-loop between mastering and evaluation:\nthe results of cognitive mastering are continuously evaluated in relation to how successfully\nthe artwork is understood (about the affective evaluation of processing fluency, see Reber\net al 1998). In other words, the evaluation stage guides and initializes the further aesthetic\nprocessing by measuring its success. Finally, the evaluation process ends with two parallel\noutputs: aesthetic judgment (eg, judgment of artwork's beauty) and aesthetic emotion (eg,\nfeeling of pleasure). According to this model, all processing stages are accompanied by\nemotions. Successful processing results in positive affective states (pleasure or satisfaction),\nwhereas non-successful processing results in negative emotions.\nAll proposed models deal with the temporally distributed stages of information pro-\ncessing which ends with a single outcome--aesthetic decision, response, or judgment. An\nexception is the model of Leder and collaborators (Leder et al 2004), which ends with two\noutputs--aesthetic judgment and aesthetic emotion. For the purpose of our interest, these\nmodels are not completely satisfying because they were not focused on the factors and\nmechanisms which generate the aesthetic experience itself, as an exceptional state of mind.\nHowever, they have some elements which are important and interesting for creating the\nmodel of aesthetic experience. We found the following elements particularly important: (a)\nfeedback relationship between perceptual-cognitive and emotional processes (Chatterjee\ninformation processing (Chatterjee 2003; Nadal et al 2008), and (c) the distinction between\nearlier (perceptual) stages, focused to physical features of an object, and later (cognitive)\nstages, which are responsible for the appraisal of the semantic aspects of artworks (Chatterjee\nOur tentative model of the most elementary functional relationships between different\ndomains of aesthetic experience is schematically outlined in Figure 1. This model has two\ngeneral stages, the initial and the main stage. The initial stage begins with the perceptual\nand cognitive appraisal of the object's basic properties, such as complexity, regularity,\nfamiliarity, and the like. If the object is appraised as interesting, then arousal and attention\nare amplifying, while the affective consequence of this process is a state of excitement.\nExcitement can be more or less pleasurable, which is affected by both more pleasant\n(eg, funny, cute, erotic etc) and less pleasant (eg, strange, bizarre, deformed) stimuli. The\nincreased excitement additionally amplifies the attention through the feedback connections.\nAt this level, the amplification of attention is crucial because it adds the `fuel' to the cognitive\nsystem, and thus it supports the cognitive preparation for the further exploration of an object.\nAccording to the Affect Infusion Model (Forgas 1995) a positive mood at the beginning of\nan aesthetic experience affects the quality of further aesthetic processing, whereas negative\naffect leads to a more restricted spread of activation. However, in our model, the increase of\narousal, and not positive hedonic tone, is crucial for enhancing the processing (arousal can\nbe induced by both pleasant and unpleasant stimuli).\nIn the main stage the further appraisals are focused on the detection of more complex\ncompositional regularities and the interpretation of more sophisticated narratives and\nhidden symbolism of the object's structure. The appraisal on this level is self-rewarding,\nwhich results in increased attention--that is, a fascination. In this paper, fascination is\nComponents of aesthetic experience 7\ndefined as a state of intensive, extensive, and long-term concentration and vigilance, which\ncontinuously `feeds' and energizes the cognitive system. This contributes to the efficacy and\nease of further appraisals, which is particularly important for the processing of multilevel\nnarratives or highly sophisticated artistic compositions. Finally, this process is accompanied\nwith a feeling of an exceptional and unique relationship with the object of fascination. Like\nin the initial stage, the aesthetic emotion affects the maintenance of fascination via feedback\nconnections, which indirectly contributes to the efficiency of the appraisal process. The\nappraisal process is sometimes very long-term, such as the reading of a novel, while it is\nsometimes relatively short, such as the identification of a bull's head in Picasso's famous\ncomposition.\nFigure 1. The two stages of the functional relationships between cognitive, attentional and emotional\naspects of aesthetic experience of an object. Arrows indicate the direction of influence (see the text for\nexplanation).\nThe proposed model must assume that the cognitive domain has a central role in aesthetic\nexperience because it controls and gives sense to the whole process. For instance, if one is\nnot able to understand the symbols and allegories of the Biblical mythology, the meaning of\na great part of Western art would be missing. The appraisal of meaning is crucial even for\nthe aesthetic experience of a very simple artistic object, such as Picasso's composition of\nthe Bull's Head. Namely, if persons are not acquainted with modern technology, including\nbicycles and their parts (eg, handlebars and the seat), or (and) if they have never seen animals\nwith horns, the aesthetic experience will be missing. Many studies found the crucial role of\ntop-down processing and an activation of semantic networks in the aesthetic appreciation of\nLeder et al 2004). In the proceeding paragraphs the cognitive domain of aesthetic experience\n(aesthetic appraisal), related to the main stage of the model, is considered in more detail.\n3.1 Aesthetic information processing\nFigure 2 shows the cognitive processes involved in aesthetic information processing at the\nmain stage of the model. The external information domain is segmented into two aspects and\nprocessed through two corresponding levels: the levels of narrative and formal composition.\n3.1.1 The processing of a narrative. In its strict meaning, a narrative is defined as a temporal\nsemantic structure which provides different kinds of information (Chatman 1978). Narratives\nhave two levels--story and discourse. At the story level the information about real or\nimagined events is explicitly denoted and transmitted. In narrative arts (eg, literature,\ntheatre, film, etc) the story describes the events passing through four usual stages: prior\nstate, exposition, complication, and equilibrium. On the other hand, the discourse has an\nexpressive function; it adds affective or connotative meanings to the information provided\nby the story (cf Brooks and Warren 1979; Chatman 1978). Instead of discourse, in this paper\n8 S Markovi\u00b4\nc\nFigure 2. The model shows four parallel streams of aesthetic information processing and their\nconnections with external information and internal emotional responses. Underlying dispositions\nfor each stream are shown as well. Arrows indicate the direction of influence. Solid arrows denote\nprimary connections, and the dashed ones denote secondary connections. (See the text for detailed\nexplanation.)\nwe will rather use the term symbolism for deeper and implicit layers of the narrative, such as\n`hidden' meanings, metaphors, ideological, mythological, and other symbolism and all other\nexpressive and emotionally loaded contents as well.\nSymbolism can be more or less distant to the denotative content of the explicit story. For\nexample, in official portraits of royal families and national heroes this distance is relatively\nsmall, because the symbolism is based on some real social and ideological features that\nthe depicted persons represent. On the other hand, in some cases, such as for instance,\nDelacroix's painting Liberty leading the people, the symbolism is very distant to the depicted\ncontent. Namely, the denotative content of this painting is the group of people, including the\nboy with a gun and the girl with naked breasts, who are walking over dead bodies. However,\nit is obvious that Delacroix's intention was not to depict exact appearance of the concrete\npeople in the scene, but rather to use this scene as a symbolic representation of something\nmore abstract and conceptual, such as the struggle for freedom and the rise against tyranny.\nTwo levels of a narrative are associated with two-way connections. Symbolism contributes\nthe better understanding of the story: for instance, if we are not familiar with Christian\nsymbols, we will not be able to correctly understand the content of medieval art. On the\nother hand, a story can be used as a means for creating meanings on a more symbolic and\nmetaphoric level: for instance, surrealistic artworks often use bizarre stories and contents\nto symbolize some abstract concepts (consider, for example, the role of an explicit story in\nLouis Bunuel's movies or Eugene Ionesco's dramas).\nFor understanding the explicit meaning of a story or theme basic (general) declarative\nknowledge and related cognitive and memorial structures are sufficient, whereas for the\ninterpretation of deeper symbolic meanings, more specific declarative knowledge is needed.\nMany studies have shown the crucial role of art expertise (mastering, training) in preference\nand efficient elaboration of different categories of paintings (cf Augustin and Leder 2006;\nComponents of aesthetic experience 9\nSome theoretical approaches such as Gombrich's conceptualistic theory held that art is\na conventional, language-like system which can be understood only if one has learned to\n1973). In our opinion, expertise and explicit knowledge are not sufficient for narrative\nappraisal. Moreover, in some cases, such as understanding new, unusual, `non-official',\nand revolutionary artworks, expertise can be inhibitory and restrictive (about the so-called\nfunctional fixation of expertise, see more in Sternberg 1996; Sternberg and Lubart 1995). In\nsuch cases, two additional dispositions can contribute to the quality and efficacy of appraisal.\nThe first disposition is ability for creative thinking, in which apparently incongruent and\ndistant semantic frames (meanings, symbols) are associated in novel semantic entities (cf\nsupport the transfer of expertise to new situations, but in some cases it can be opposed to the\nconservative tendencies of expertise and prior knowledge. The second supporting disposition\nis a personality trait Openness to Experience, which has an important motivational role in\nsearching for new meanings and hidden symbolism in artistic and non-artistic aesthetic\nobjects and events. Empirical data clearly show that high scorers of the Openness prefer less\nstructured, more complex, and abstract artistic stimuli (Feist and Brady 2004; Rawlings 2000,\n3.1.2 The processing of form and composition. Every object of aesthetic processing has some\nphysical form which determines the stylistic aspect of the artwork's identity. An aesthetic\nform is a specific composition of various features such as colours, lines, shapes, sounds,\ngestures, and so on. Some compositions are uni-modal (eg, paintings are visual artworks,\nmusic is auditory art, etc), whereas some compositions are multi-modal (eg, opera, theatre,\nfilm, etc). Many studies and phenomenological demonstrations have shown that even the\nsingle iconic features (eg, colours, lines, and shapes) can provide some elementary meanings,\nsuch as dynamics, warmth, health, time, destruction, loneliness, and so on (cf Arnheim 1980;\nJankovi\u00b4\nc and Markovi\u00b4\nperceptual meanings can be used as artistic means for creating the symbolic meanings on\na narrative level. For instance, the use of vivid red colour can emphasize the depiction of\npassion in pictorial representations, the use of diagonal lines can induce the impression of\ndynamics, the use of sharp angular lines can be associated with aggression, danger, and so on.\nSimilarly, some auditory (phonemic) features of spoken language (eg, rhyme, onomatopoeia,\netc) are very frequently used to stress various meanings in poetry, drama, and so on.\nFrom an aesthetic point of view, the compositions of features are more important than the\nsingle features. Namely, in artistic compositions (and in natural scenes and events, as well),\nthe global structural organizations induce impressions which can support the understanding\nof a narrative. For instance, the temporal composition of a film (editing), and the dynamic\ncomposition of single scenes (viewing angles, moving of camera, etc) directly shape and\narticulate the full meaning of a narrative. However, in non-narrative arts, such as abstract\npaintings, architecture and music, the composition is the central source of aesthetic appraisal.\nbased on the holistic nature of perception and the capability for abstract perceptual thinking.\nNamely, our perceptual-cognitive system is highly sensitive to so-called structural forces and\ndynamic expressions of abstract Gestalt qualities, such as ovalness, sharpness, branching,\njumping, and so on. The compositions of such qualities are analogue to the narrative in\nnarrative arts, while the single features (Gestalt qualities) play the role of concepts used\nas `building blocks' of a narrative. In our model, narrative and compositional levels are\nc\ninterconnected: all narratives have some compositions (eg, structure of a novel), while all\ncompositions have some narratives or narrative-like meanings (eg, narrative of an abstract\npainting).\nWithout the capability for perceptual and imaginative thinking and associations of\nimplicit meanings into more complex structures, the aesthetic appraisal of music and\nabstract visual art would not be possible. However, like in the case of narrative symbol-\nism, the complete understanding of abstract art implies some specific knowledge. Many\nstudies have shown that the role of expertise is particularly important for the appraisal of\nabstract paintings: experts preferred abstraction over figural representation (Hekkert and van\nWieringen 1996; Neperud 1989) and dominantly used a global viewing strategy for abstract\npaintings compared to non-experts (Zangemeister et al 1995). Facilitation of the preference\nfor abstract art emerged even after short-term training sessions in which participants were\ninformed about context and conditions of the creation of artworks (Schimmel and Forster\n2008) or after participants were encouraged in `abstract thinking' (Temme 1992). In addition,\nlike in the case of the appraisal of symbolism, creative thinking and Openness to Experience\nplay an important role in understanding the complex regularities hidden in abstract artistic\nIn the previous paragraphs two parallel levels of aesthetic information processing were\noutlined: (a) the narrative, that is, a thematic and symbolic meaning of an artwork, and (b) the\ncomposition, that is, a stylistic form of expression. Both levels are important for generating\naesthetic emotions, but different arts put a different accent on one or the other level: for\ninstance, literature and film are more focused on the narrative, whereas music and abstract\nart are dominantly based on composition (form of expression). In our model, aesthetic\nemotions are associated with the main stage of aesthetic information processing--that\nis, with the appraisals of symbolism and structural regularities (initial stage includes only\nexcitement elicited by the appraisal of interestingness; see Figure 1). In the next paragraphs,\nthe distinctive features of aesthetic emotions are considered in more details.\n3.2 Aesthetic emotions and other emotions\nSilvia has pointed out that aesthetic appraisal includes a wide spectrum of specific emotions\nincluding pleasure, pride, surprise, anger, disgust, contempt, shame, guilt, regret, embar-\nrassment, confusion, and so on (Silvia 2009; see also Cooper and Silvia 2009; Silvia and\nBrown 2007). He suggested that all these emotions are aesthetic, because they are associated\nwith the appraisal of an artistic narrative, but he did not provide the explicit criteria which\ndistinguished aesthetic and non-aesthetic emotions (eg, aesthetic anger vs. non-aesthetic\nanger).\nFrijda (1989) specified aesthetic emotions more precisely. He distinguished two kinds of\naesthetic emotions: complementing and responding emotions. Complementing emotions\nare similar to the emotions in real life: they are generated by the artwork content, such\nas a suffering for the pain of the depicted character. On the other hand, responding\nemotions are generated by the structure of artwork itself; they are the aesthetic emotions\nin their fundamental sense, such as a delight and fascination with a perfect artistic form or\ncomposition.\nSimilarly, Cupchik (1994) proposed two models of aesthetic emotional processing,\nreactive and reflective. The reactive model accounts for pleasure and arousal evoked by\nthe specific content of artworks (eg, sentimental feelings of characters), while the reflective\nmodel refers to the contribution of emotions to the generating of polyvalent meanings of\nmultilevel artistic narratives. According to Cupchik, these two models correspond to two\ncognitive approaches. One is selectively focused on diverse features and qualities of aesthetic\nobjects in isolation (basis for the reflective model), whereas the other explores the unity\nComponents of aesthetic experience 11\nwhich interrelates the single qualities (basis for the reflective model). Reflective orientation is\nevidently more important for aesthetic experience because it connects and unites the diverse\ncontextual relations and the polyvalent meanings into a coherent aesthetic (artistic) whole.\nAesthetic emotions could be identified as one of the Kubovy's (1999) pleasures of the mind.\nAccording to Kubovy, pleasures of the mind have no distinctive physiological and behavioural\nexpressions typical for basic emotions and pleasures of the body. Namely, pleasures of the\nmind are not simple emotional reactions, but rather collections of emotions distributed over\ntime: for example, during the reading of a novel or the watching of a film or a theatre show\nexcitement, fear, anger, tranquillity, and other emotions are transforming one in the other in\nrespect to the changing of the narrative. This collection can be specified as the basis for the\ngenerating of an aesthetic emotion.\nScherer (2005) also delineated everyday emotions from aesthetic emotions. Everyday\nemotions have clear adaptive functions, which require the appraisal of goal relevance and\ncoping potential, whereas the aesthetic emotions are not homeostatic and utilitarian (ie,\noriented towards the satisfaction of bodily needs), but rather intrinsic, that is, produced by the\nquality of the aesthetic object itself. According to Scherer, examples of aesthetic emotions are\nbeing moved or awed, being full of wonder, admiration, bliss, ecstasy, fascination, harmony,\nrapture, solemnity, and the like. Scherer argues that the non-adaptive nature of aesthetic\nemotions does not mean that they are completely disembodied because in intense aesthetic\nexperiences some diffuse non-action-oriented bodily responses emerge, such as goose\npimples, shivers, moist eyes, and the like (see also Frijda 1986).\nThe above-mentioned definitions suggest that aesthetic emotions are exceptional af-\nfective qualities which are functionally specific and non-reducible to everyday emotions.\nHowever, everyday emotions are also included in our model, but their function is not to\ngenerate aesthetic emotions directly, but rather to support the appraisals of the narrative\nand composition. Namely, all narratives include some emotional situations, and some\nnarratives are dominantly emotional (eg, sentimental novels), so they require explicit\nemotional appraisals. In other words, appraisals of inner emotional states of characters\nand inter-personal relationships are necessary for understanding the basic meaning of\nartwork. Without the empathic appraisals, even the very superficial layers of artworks would\nnot be correctly understood (eg, portrait of a `sad woman', story of `lost love', etc). In other\nwords, emotions can be used as constitutive parts of narratives which indirectly contribute\nto the generating of aesthetic emotions. In this case, the aesthetic emotion is an emotion\nwhich is emerging through the process of appraisal of more profound symbolic layers of a\nnarrative. It continually accompanies the appraisal process and via feedback mechanisms\naffects aesthetic information processing (see also Leder et al 2004).\nSome more diffuse emotions are generated during the perception of simple aesthetic\nobjects and their features. For instance, some studies have shown that sharp irregular figures\nwere experienced as more disturbing than oval regular shapes (cf Arnheim 1980; Jankovi\u00b4\nc\nand Markovi\u00b4\npleasant than dark brown ones (Palmer and Schloss 2010), and so on. Our model suggests\nthat these diffuse affective qualities are associated with perceptual qualities through the\nfeedback mechanisms (eg, red + excitement, ovalness + pleasure, etc). On the other hand,\nthe aesthetic emotion is emerging here as an evaluation of how successful the detection of\ndeeper structural regularities is (collections of impressions) in both narrative (literature, film,\ntheatre, etc) and non-narrative compositions (music, abstract art, architecture, etc).\nTo summarize, in this paper aesthetic emotions are defined as feelings of unity and\nexceptional relationship with the objects of aesthetic experience. Aesthetic emotions, such\nas admiration, delight, rapture, awe and so on, are induced by the appraisal of the artwork's\nc\nor natural object's form (eg, symbolic structure and compositional regularities), and they\nare basically pleasurable. On the other hand, the emotions induced by the appraisal of the\ncontent of artwork (eg, empathy with characters of a novel) can be both pleasurable and\nunpleasurable.\n3.3 Integration: aesthetic awareness\nThe processing of aesthetic information is based on cognitive structures which are capable\nof solving perceptually and semantically demanding tasks, such as the interpretation of\nmulti-level symbolism, association of distant narrative frameworks into temporally and\nconceptually coherent structures, detection of sophisticated compositional regularities,\nintegration of multi-level perceptual, symbolic, and affective information, and so on.\nSuccessful realization of such complex mental activities requires high concentration and\nawareness and efficient working memory processing. Our model emphasizes the role of\ngeneral arousal and attention (fascination) in `energizing' the cognitive processes and\nexpanding the short-term memory workspace for aesthetic information processing. Existing\nliterature does not provide neural models of specific `aesthetic awareness', but some fMRI\nstudies suggested that the higher activities in parietal and frontal areas could be neural\ncorrelates of general awareness and consciousness (for a review, see Rees 2001b). However,\nother studies suggested that consciousness is not concentrated at local brain regions but is\nassociated with globally distributed networks across a large scale of neuronal groups (cf Baars\nreflects the representations of stimuli gaining access to a `global workspace' which constitutes\nconsciousness. In other words, awareness of information represented in a particular brain\nregion enables its access by most of the other brain regions (cf Kanwisher 2001). Further\nstudies should provide more precise models applicable for the states of expanded and\nintensive awareness in aesthetic experience.\n4 Conclusion\nIn the present paper the aesthetic experience was specified as an exceptional state of\nmind which is qualitatively different from `normal' everyday mental states. In this mental\nstate, a person is fascinated with a particular object, whereas the surrounding environment\nis shadowed, self-awareness is reduced, and the sense of time is distorted. Amplified arousal\nand attention provide the additional energy which is needed for the effective appraisal of\nsymbolism and compositional regularities in `virtual' aesthetic realities. Finally, during this\nprocess a person has a strong feeling of unity and the exceptional relationship with the\nobject of aesthetic fascination and aesthetic appraisal. The findings of our previous studies\n(Markovi\u00b4\nc 2006) suggested that aesthetic experience is closer to\narousal (interestingness) than other dimensions of subjective experience, such as a positive\nhedonic tone (pleasure) and regularity (harmony): the object of aesthetic experience can\nbe both pleasant and unpleasant and both more and less regular, but it must be arousing\nand interesting. In our general model (Figure 1), interestingness plays an important role in\ngenerating the aesthetic experience: appraisal of interestingness opens a `mental space' for\nfurther aesthetic appraisals and continuous aesthetic fascination.\nAccording to our approach, aesthetic experience can focus on a wide spectrum of objects,\nincluding intentionally created artworks and aesthetically designed objects (eg, clothing,\ncars), natural scenes and events, human beings and animals, objects of everyday use, and\nso on. The main condition that such objects must satisfy to become the objects of aesthetic\nexperience is the transcendence from the pragmatic to the aesthetic (symbolic) level of\nmeaning. For instance, some natural scenes and events, such as observing the stormy\nComponents of aesthetic experience 13\nsky with strong lightings, may be extremely fascinating and induce the impressions of the\nmystical and sublime power of nature and our weakness and helplessness. The appraisal\nof such symbolism and the accompanying collection of emotions, such as fear, surprise,\nawe, excitement, and the like, can generate the aesthetic experience in its full meaning.\nHowever, the emerging of aesthetic experience is not automatic; it is the result of an ecological\nand social context which specifies the particular subject-object relationship. Namely, some\npersons, such as farmers, are not aesthetically fascinated at all with a storm. Their appraisals\nwould be dominantly pragmatic: a storm is a dangerous event which can cause serious\ndamage; it can destroy their crops and the like. A similar duality of the object's status can be\nidentified even in the realm of art. Namely, artworks are not automatically and objectively\nthe objects of aesthetic experience. For many non-experts, artworks are rather seen as the\nornamental parts of the everyday environment than as exceptional objects with deeper\naesthetic symbolism (cf Winston and Cupchik 1992). Also, artworks can be treated and\nexperienced very pragmatically, as material goods in an art market.\nFurther conceptualization of aesthetic experience should specify possible differences\nand similarities in various forms of aesthetic experience. Some analyses and findings suggest\nthat aesthetic experience can be generated in two forms, such as fascination with unusual,\nuncertain, ambiguous, and conflicting information (eg, modern art), and admiration to\nperfect articulation, complex compositional regularities, and sophistication of multilevel\nFinally, the more comprehensive approach to aesthetic experience should take into\naccount its biological and psychological functions. We can speculate that the function of\naesthetic experience comprises the functions of two groups of close phenomena, such as\nother exceptional experiences (eg, peak experiences, flow, etc) and the experience of beauty\n(eg, pleasure, attraction, harmony, etc). In our opinion, the purpose of aesthetic experience\ncould be described as a `winning' combination of a strong appetitive tendency associated\nwith the experience of beauty and a certain intrinsic `liberating' tendency associated with\nexceptional states of mind and similar phenomena. In the psychology of art, the functional\naspect of symbolism in aesthetic experience was a favourite topic of psychoanalytically\noriented theories (cf Freud 1910; Kris 1952), whereas the psycho-biological approaches were\npredominantly oriented towards a biological basis of aesthetic preference and aesthetic\nin the future the neuroscience of awareness and states of consciousness combined with the\nbiological approach could be very fruitful for the better understanding of the basic function\nof aesthetic experience.\n"
