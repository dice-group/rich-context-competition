This burden is felt most acutely by\ndeveloping countries, which in addition to having the least\nresources have a disproportionately high prevalence of TBIs\nprimarily due to the substantially higher incidence of road\ntraffic accidents in those countries. As one of the rapidly\ndeveloping nations in Africa, Kenya has a significantly high\nrate of traffic-related deaths and disabilities most of which\nresult from brain injuries. Although there are no accurate\nnumbers available on the prevalence of TBIs in Kenya, the\nhigh frequency of motor vehicle\u00adrelated injuries and fatali-\nties, and the numbers mentioned in the articles reviewed for\nthis article, point to a high occurrence of brain injuries in the\ncountry.\nBroadly defined, TBI is an insult to the brain caused by an\nexternal physical force or penetration of the skull by a for-\neign object. ATBI is not congenital or degenerative in nature\nand is not the result of a disease (Falvo, 2009) or acute ill-\nness. TBI is typically classified as mild, moderate, or severe.\nBetween 10% and 30% of TBIs are considered moderate and\nbetween 5% and 25% are in the severe category. Severity of\ninjury is generally determined by Glasgow Coma Scale\n(GCS) ratings immediately following the injury, usually\nupon arrival at a treatment facility.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO; 2011) estimates\nthat each year more than 10 million people in the world sus-\ntain TBIs resulting in death or extensive hospitalization\n(Hyder,Wunderlich,Puvanachandra,Gururaj,&Kobusingye,\nmanent disability (Roozenbeek, Maas, & Menon, 2013).\nMost recent data indicate that TBI is responsible for more\nthan 4.5 million deaths a year which translates to approxi-\nmately one in every 10 deaths in the world. This number is\nexpected to increase, especially due to the rapidly increasing\nrates of TBI in developing countries. The WHO predicts that\nby the year 2020, TBI will be the leading cause of mortality\nand disability in the world, surpassing chronic diseases and\nother current leading causes of death (WHO, 2002). That\nincrease is expected to be even more pronounced in develop-\ning countries where that trend is already evident. Between\nAfrica increased by 35% (El-Gindi, Mahdy, & Abdel Azeem,\nIt is for this reason that TBI has often been referred to as\n\"the silent epidemic\" (Langlois, Rutland-Brown, & Ward,\n1University of Kentucky, Lexington, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nBenson Kinyanjui, Department of Early Childhood, Special Education, and\nRehabilitation Counseling, University of Kentucky, 229 Taylor Education\nEmail: benson.kinyanjui@uky.edu\nTraumatic Brain Injury in Kenya: A\nPreliminary Review of the Literature\nBenson Kinyanjui1\n Keywords\nKenya, traumatic brain injury, head injury, brain injury, brain injury rehabilitation\n2 SAGE Open\n2006) especially due to the fact that most of its consequences,\nespecially cognitive impairments, are not obvious. Unlike\nphysical or sensory disabilities, many people with TBI do not\nappear to have a disability. Visible or not, TBI continues to\nbe a significant public health problem accounting for billions\nof dollars in medical expenses and lost manpower every\nyear. That financial and human capital burden is felt by all\ncountries, but most profoundly by developing and underde-\nveloped countries that have disproportionately higher preva-\nlence of TBI.\nWhile there are many causes of TBI, road traffic accidents\nare responsible for about 60% of brain injuries in the world\n(Hyder et\nal., 2007). Globally, road traffic accidents are\nresponsible for more than 50 million injuries every year, with\nabout 1.2 million ending in death (Jacobs & Aeron-Thomas,\nabout 25%, and other non-motor-vehicle-related accidents\nand acts of violence which collectively account for about\nAlthough developing countries have the lowest number of\nmotor vehicles, they have the highest road traffic accident\nmortality rates (Saidi, Mutiso, & Ogengo, 2014). As a conti-\nnent, Africa has about 4% of the world's motor vehicles.\nHowever, the number of road traffic accident fatalities on the\ncontinent account for 11% of all motor vehicle related deaths\nin the world (Jacobs & Aeron-Thomas, 2012). In contrast,\ndeveloped countries, who own 60% of the world's motor\nvehicles, account for only 14% of global road traffic accident\nOver the past 40 years, there has been a significant\ndecrease in road traffic accident deaths in developed coun-\ntries, while in developing countries like Kenya, the opposite\nhas been true as road traffic accident mortality rates have\nincreased exponentially (Mwang'ombe & Shitsama, 2013;\nPratte, 1998). Factors attributable to the decline in road traf-\nfic accident fatalities in industrialized countries include\nimplementation of preventive measures (Jennett, 1996),\nincluding mandatory helmet and seat belt laws, rigorous\nenforcement of alcohol limits, and enforcement of speed lim-\nits by traffic police. In developing countries, the rapid\nincrease in road traffic accidents and associated deaths is pri-\nmarily due to driving in excess of the speed limit (Bachani\netal., 2012); lack of, or inadequate enforcement, of traffic\nlaws or of enforcement thereof; driving while intoxicated\n(Hassan, Macharia, & Atinga, 2005; Odero, Garner, & Zwi,\n1997); operation of unroadworthy vehicles (El-Gindi etal.,\nTBI in Kenya\nIn Kenya, the mortality rate from road traffic accidents has\nbeen increasing every year since independence in 1963\nKenyans die as a result of road traffic accidents every year,\nand thousands more are incapacitated, causing huge financial\nburdens on their families and on the public health system\n2003 study of road traffic injuries, Odero and his colleagues\nfound that the mortality rate in Kenya was 68 for every\nthat is about 40 times greater than in developed countries.\nAccording to a study by Bachani and others in 2012, road\ntraffic accident\u00adrelated fatalities in Kenya increased at a rate\nber of motorcycle-related injuries increased by 29%. Like\nothers before it, this study revealed that speeding, failure to\nuse seat belts, and failure to wear helmets and/or reflective\nclothing were among the primary contributors to the high\nmortality.\nAs with most developing countries, determining the prev-\nalence of TBI in Kenya is, to an extent, a matter of estimation\ndue to the large number of factors and variables involved\n(Hyder etal., 2007). First, there is the epidemiological issue\nof the universal tendency to confuse TBI and head injury.\nHead injury typically refers to any visible lacerations, abra-\nsions, or contusions to the face or skull (Bruns & Hauser,\n2003) which may not necessarily result in an injury to the\nbrain. On the contrary, some brain injuries such as concus-\nsions can occur without any visible external injuries. It is\nperceivable that many cases of TBI go unreported because\nthey are recorded as head injury. It also is perceivable that\nmany cases of mild brain injury, which constitute the major-\nity of TBIs, go unreported (Hyder etal., 2007) and that some\nhead injuries are reported as TBIs. In the case of Kenya, lan-\nguage could be an additional factor as those who transport\naccident victims to the hospital may not be fluent in English\nand may report the circumstances of the accident in Kiswahili\nor any of the other 41 languages, potentially confusing the\nwords for \"brain\" and \"head\" in reference to the victim's\ninjuries.\nIn serious accidents in which the victims sustain many\ninjuries, triage and emergency room treatment typically\nfocuses on the visible injuries such as fractures or open\nwounds; and brain injuries may not be detected until many\ndays or weeks later. In that case, those TBIs may never make\nit into the TBI statistics as they were not reported as a direct\nresult of the accident. Furthermore, in cases in which the\nindividual dies at the accident scene, in transit to the hospital,\nor upon admission, the death may be attributed to other inju-\nries. Compounding the problem in developing countries such\nas Kenya is the lack of evaluative skills among lower level\nmedical staff, the lack of knowledge regarding assessment\ntools such as GCS and Injury Severity Score (ISS), and the\nlack of an adequate data documentation and recording sys-\ntem (Saidi etal., 2014) especially in rural areas. Therefore,\nalthough some records exist on the prevalence of TBI in\nKenya in particular, and the developing world in general,\nthey are in most likelihood a gross underestimation of the\ntrue numbers of TBIs that actually occur there.\nKinyanjui 3\nIn Kenya, the above factors in combination with the sharp\nincrease in the number of motor vehicles, and in particular\nmotor cycles (Khanbhai & Lutomia, 2012; Saidi & Mutisto,\n2013), have resulted in a significant rise in the number of\nroad traffic accidents (Osoro, Nganga, Oundo, Omolo, &\nLuman, 2011) and consequently in the number of people\nwho sustain TBI as a result. As stated before, accurate num-\nbers on the incidence of TBI are difficult to determine due to\na lack of a centralized national reporting and record keeping\nsystem.\nThe most recent reliable study on road traffic injuries\nrates in Kenya (Bachani etal., 2012) puts the rate at about 60\nsingle most common consequence of road traffic accidents,\nand that TBI accounts for about 50% of all road traffic acci-\ndent deaths (Saidi, Macharia, & Atinga, 2005), it is easy to\nsee, even without exact numbers, that Kenya has a high inci-\ndence of TBI. The global prevalence of TBI is estimated at\ncountries and regions, ranging from 67 in some developed\ncountries to 317 in some developing countries. The preva-\nlence rate in Kenya remains unknown. However, based on\nglobal rates, prevalence in comparable countries in Africa,\nand on the high incidence of road traffic injuries and its high\ncorrelation with TBI, the prevalence is likely to be on the\nhigher end of the global TBI prevalence.\nLiterature Review\nA review of literature on this participant resulted in very\nfew articles written on TBI in Kenya. To be precise, only\nfour articles were published in peer reviewed journals\nfied six articles in the form of unpublished dissertations and\nmanuscripts almost exclusively written by students and fac-\nulty of the University of Nairobi in the same period.\nAlthough none of the 10 articles include TBI incidence or\nprevalence rates, they all allude to a high incidence of TBI\nin Kenya. Incidentally, all of the articles are based on stud-\nies or research carried out at Kenyatta National Hospital\n(KNH), the teaching hospital for the University of Nairobi,\nwhich is also the largest referral hospital in Kenya. A search\nof articles on TBI based on treatment at other medical facil-\nities in Kenya yielded no results.\nThe most recent is a 2013 article by Wekesa, Ogengo,\nSiongei, Elbusaidy, and Iwaret published in the East and\nCentral African Journal of Surgery, in which the authors dis-\ncuss the demographics of participants with traumatic head\ninjuries at KNH. Wekesa etal. (2013) reiterated the chal-\nlenges of determining the epidemiology of TBI in develop-\ning countries such as Kenya due to the scarcity of CT scans,\nthe main diagnostic tool for TBI, and the issue of polytrauma\ninjuries and fatalities in which brain injury is often not fac-\ntored. They proceeded to present findings of the cross-\nsectional study whose specific focus was on patients with\nintracranial bleeding resulting from brain trauma. The study\nincluded 51 patients between 4 and 81 years of age, the\nmajority of whom were male (96%). Other relevant demo-\ngraphics included that 55% of the participants were married,\n57% had elementary (primary) education, 47% were\nemployed, 35% were alcohol consumers, and 21% were cig-\narette smokers. These demographics are typical of a cross\nsection of Kenyans and are comparable with the patient\ndemographics in all other studies reviewed.\nCiting other studies, including one done in the United\nStates in 1994, the authors pointed out the association\nbetween TBI and low social economic status in Kenya. In\naddition, they inferred that the level of education is nega-\ntively correlated to TBI incidence in that less than 4% of the\nTBI patients in their study had tertiary education, as opposed\nto 68% who had little or no education. They added that\nalthough 47% of the participants reported being employed,\nthey were engaged in low paying jobs consistent with their\nlow academic level (Wekesa etal., 2013). The authors con-\ncluded their article by calling for more population-based\nstudies on TBI to present a clearer picture of the incidence\nand impact of TBI in Kenya.\nIn 2011, Kiboi, Kitunguu,Angwenyi, Mbuthia, and Sagina\nconducted a study on the predictors of functional recovery\nfollowing TBI involving intracranial hematomas. In their\nstudy, which was published in World Neurosurgery, the\nauthors started by highlighting the significance of intracranial\nhematomas which they describe as the most common clinical\nproblem encountered by neurosurgeons, and which is associ-\nated with high mortality rates and very poor prognosis among\nTBI patients (Kiboi, Kitunguu, Angwenyi, Mbuthia, &\nSagina, 2011). For their study, which was the first to address\nthat particular medical participant among Kenyan patients,\nthe authors reviewed records of 608 patients diagnosed with\nTBI and admitted at KNH neurosurgical unit between January\nand December, 2009. Their review specifically looked for\ntreatment variables predictive of favorable functional out-\ncomes. As expected, the majority of the patients were male\n(89%), with about 50% of the patients between the ages of 26\nand 45. Surprisingly, 48% of the patients had sustained TBI as\na result of assault, with road traffic accident and falls contrib-\nuting to the other 51% of the patients.\nAccording to their findings, 46% of the patients achieved\nended up with moderate or severe disability, which translates\nto approximately 231 people. The report did not account for\nthe remaining 20% of the patients, but based on other stud-\nies, that could be the number that died during treatment. A\nsignificant finding from that study was that patients who sus-\ntained TBI from motor vehicle accidents were less likely to\nachieve functional recovery than those whose TBI resulted\nfrom falling. From the data, the authors concluded that long\nperiods between injury and treatment, poor GCS scores,\npupillary abnormalities, and being older than 61 years were\npredictive of poor functional recovery.\n4 SAGE Open\nIn an article published in the Annals of African Surgery,\nOpondo and Mwangombe (2007) reported that their research\nwas conducted on 87 patients with TBI admitted at KNH\nIntensive Care Unit (ICU) between April and September,\n2005. Fifty-eight percent of the patients were involved in\nroad traffic accidents. The purpose of the research was \"to\ndetermine the outcome of severe traumatic brain injury and\nto document the factors influencing mortality\" (Opondo &\nMwangombe, 2007, p. 1). Precisely, they wanted to look at\nthe differences in treatment between TBI patients who had\nsurvived and those who had died, to determine what could be\ndone differently to increase the survival rate. Mortality\namong the 87 patients admitted during that 6-month period\nwas 54%. Among those who survived, 29% were severely\ndisabled or remained in a persistent vegetative state. From\nthe study, the authors determined that GCS score of less than\n5, diffuse axonal injury, intracerebral lesions, and high blood\nsugar were the primary factors influencing poor outcomes.\nThe oldest journal article identified on this participant\nwas one written by Mwang'ombe and Kiboi (2001) and pub-\nlished in the East African Medical Journal in 2001. This\narticle describes a study which, like the one by Wekesa and\nhis colleagues, focused on identifying factors that influence\nthe outcome of severe TBI at KNH. This was a retrospective\nstudy on the 677 patients who were treated for severe head\nThe demographics of the patients in this study were compa-\nrable with those in the other two studies, that is, males out-\nnumbered females, with the majority of the patients being\nbetween 26 and 45 years of age. The study indicated that\n56% of the patients died while undergoing treatment. About\n38% had moderate to good recovery which in this context\nwas defined as \"resumption of normal life with moderate or\nminor neurological or psychological deficits\" (Mwang'ombe\ncluded that age, GCS score, systolic blood pressure, and\npupillary reaction to light were the leading predictors of out-\ncomes following TBI.\nTwo of the dissertations found on the participant of TBI in\nKenya focused on institutional structure and practitioner\nskills and performance, and how they affect the outcomes of\nTBI patients at KNH. The first one, written by Bhoyyo\n(2010), was based on a study of the management of patients\nwith severe TBI at KNH, in particular, the practices of anes-\nthesia and neurology practitioners and their adherence to\nguidelines established by the Brain Trauma Foundation\n(BTF). The study was carried out via a self-administered\nquestionnaire given to 53 practitioners who worked directly\nwith head injured patients. According to Bhoyyo, the study\nrevealed that many of the practitioners did not follow the\nprotocol of care on a regular basis. For example, only 20% of\nthe practitioners managed hypotension in TBI patients as\nrequired by BTF. Among the reasons given for failure to\nmeet the set guidelines were limited staff and resources,\nincluding hospital beds.\nThe other dissertation, authored by L. W. Macharia\n(2013), aimed to \"determine the structure and processes that\nsupport quality nursing care for TBI patients\" (L. W.\nticipants working in the Critical Care Unit (CCU) and\nAccident Emergency (AE) departments at KNH, the major-\nity of whom had at least 5 years experience. From the study,\nMacharia found that there was a significant correlation\nbetween nurses' knowledge (skills) and the quality of their\nmanagement of TBI patients, especially the prevention of\nsecondary TBI in the two departments.As in Bhoyyo's study,\nthe challenges reported by the participants included inade-\nquate staff, lack of or shortage of equipment, and lack of\nguidelines.\nA comprehensive study on cognitive dysfunction among\nTBI patients at KNH was conducted by Gachanja (2013) and\nreported in an unpublished manuscript. The goal of the study\nwas to determine the prevalence and extent of cognitive dys-\nfunction using some standard assessment tools including the\nMini Mental Status Exam (MMSE), the Trails Making Test\n(TMT), and the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of\nNeuropsychological Status (RBANS) Part A and B. partici-\ninjured patients with a mean age of 34 years. All participants\nwere patients in the surgical clinic, neurology department,\nand treatment wards at KNH. According to the author's\nreport, 24 patients (32%) indicated moderate to severe cogni-\ntive impairment according to their MMSE results. Part A of\nthe TMT revealed moderate or severe cognitive impairment\nin 27 (36%) of the patients, while Part B indicated moderate\nor severe cognitive impairment in 37 of the patients (50%).\nFifty-eight percent of the patients were ranked as moderately\nor severely cognitively impaired by the RBANS. That study\nreported significant association between cognitive impair-\nment and age, education level, and socioeconomic status. In\nher conclusion, based on the study, the author recommended\nclinical screening and cognitive rehabilitation of TBI patients\nto improve their quality of life.\nAn unpublished manuscript by Wafula (2010) addressed\nthe age factor in the early outcomes of TBI. Based on a study\nhead injury at KNH, the study found that children ages 3 to 5\nwere the majority in the pediatric group. Poor outcomes\n(mortality) were associated with patients at the extremes of\nthe age spectrum, that is, the youngest and the oldest. One of\nthe important findings in Wafula's study was that children\nhad significantly fewer poor outcomes than adults with simi-\nlar GCS scores, suggesting a higher rate of survival among\nseverely head injured children than adults. However, in an\noverall, study-wide comparison between outcomes of chil-\ndren and those of adults, no statistically significant differ-\nence was noted.\nwith severe head injury admitted to the ICU at KNH between\nJanuary and April, 2007. Similar to other studies discussed\nKinyanjui 5\nearlier in this review, there was a significant male preponder-\nance (88%) among the participants. Road traffic accidents as\na primary mechanism of injury accounted for 82% of the par-\nticipants. This study reported that \"only 25% of the patients\nhad surgery while the rest had conservative management\"\npatients died while in the ICU and only 9% were discharged.\nSignificantly, this study brings to view the picture of an over-\nwhelmed emergency and intensive care system in Kenya\nwhere mortality is unnecessarily high due to a shortage of\nmedical personnel and resources.\nThe last of the unpublished manuscripts reviewed on this\nparticipant was one by Mwang'ombe and Shitsama (2013).\nThis article, which the authors presented at an international\nscientific conference, summarizes several studies conducted\nfindings of the studies conducted before CT scan came into\ncame out of this article are that although the male to female\nratio among the participants (7:1 and 8:1) and other demo-\ngraphics were comparable in the two periods, the mortality\nduring the pre-CT period was 16%, a sharp contrast with the\noverall mortality rate of 57% during the CT period, with 60%\nof the patients dying within 48 hours of admission\n(Mwang'ombe & Shitsama, 2013). By itself, this article\npresents an empirical picture of the tremendous increase in\nTBI deaths in Kenya over the past 30 years (W. M. Macharia,\nDiscussion and Recommendations\nOverall, this literature review paints a grim picture of TBI in\nKenya, in terms of epidemiology and the quality of services\navailable for people with TBIs. At the very least, the review\nconfirms a high and continually increasing prevalence of\nTBI in Kenya, based on the numbers mentioned in all the\nstudies reviewed. More importantly, the literature points to a\nsignificantly high mortality rate among TBI patients who\nmake it to the hospital; validates the notion that in Kenya,\nroad traffic accidents are a primary cause for TBIs in particu-\nlar, and mortality in general; and raises significant concern\nthat little is being done to curb this epidemic, or to improve\nthe treatment of its victims to increase the survival rates.\nWhat is glaringly absent from all the articles written on\nTBI in Kenya, with the possible exception of the study by\nGachanja, is what happens to those TBI patients who survive\nand are discharged from hospital. In other words, all schol-\narly literature available on TBI in Kenya pertains to the (hos-\npital) treatment of people with brain injuries with no mention\nof any post-hospital rehabilitation services for TBI survivors,\nmost of whom have moderate to severe limitations (Gachanja,\nthere are no outpatient brain rehabilitation programs affili-\nated with the hospitals such as KNH, and none in the private\nsector, TBI survivors in Kenya currently have nowhere to go\nfor brain injury rehabilitation services such as cognitive\nrehabilitation that can enable them to gain an amount of\nindependence and improve their quality of life, including\nobtaining employment when possible. These patients are\ntypically discharged to their families where they continue to\npresent as a financial burden directly to those families and\nindirectly to society (Saidi etal., 2014). Alternatively, they\nare left to fend for themselves, consequently, increasing their\nchances of sustaining additional brain injuries. This contrasts\nsharply with the attention given to other types of disabling\nconditions in Kenya such as visual impairment, deafness,\nand developmental disabilities for which there exists reha-\nbilitation services including vocational training programs.\nTBI is a worldwide problem exerting tremendous eco-\nnomic burden on public and private health systems in the\naffected countries. Although actual figures are currently\nunknown (Humphreys, Wood, Phillips, & Macey, 2013), it is\nclearly in the billions of dollars lost each year in terms of\ntreatment costs and lost productivity. Nowhere is that impact\nfelt more than in the developing countries such as Kenya\nwhere there is not enough money (Bryan-Hancock &\nHarrison, 2010) to cover more critical health care needs. As\nstudies have shown, the majority of TBI victims are people\netal., 2014), which represents a period in life when they are\nat the peak of their productive potential (W. M. Macharia\netal., 2009). In addition, the majority of TBI victims are\nmales, who in most cases are the primary or sole breadwin-\nners in their families. Death or disability among this popula-\ntion represents an irreparable and permanent loss of income\nand livelihood to dependents, resulting in a cycle of poverty\n(Eide & Ingstad, 2013) and dependence on society. Moreover,\nin countries such as Kenya where there is no social welfare\nsystem, the repercussions are far reaching as dependents of\nTBI victims may discontinue their education prematurely\ndue to lack of financial support, often resorting to underage\nemployment or engaging in criminal behavior.\nIt is therefore of crucial importance that steps be taken not\nonly toward the prevention of TBI related deaths in Kenya\nbut also in the rehabilitation of those who acquire cognitive\nimpairments as a result of TBI, to help them return to inde-\npendent and productive lifestyles. To accomplish that, there\nis a need for a comprehensive cross-sectional study of\nKenyans with TBI who have been discharged from KNH and\nother hospitals in the country to determine their status in\nterms of health and functioning, access to resources includ-\ning health services, and their needs and aspirations. Such a\nstudy could be used to help inform policy on addressing the\nrehabilitation needs of people with TBI in Kenya.\nThere is also an urgent need for the establishment of a\nclinical screening process to identify specific cognitive limi-\ntations as soon as possible following brain for the victims to\nreceive appropriate rehabilitation services as inpatients and\n6 SAGE Open\nupon discharge. Most importantly, urgent consideration\nneeds to be given for the establishment of a rehabilitation\nfacility for people with TBI in Kenya so that they too can\nhave the opportunity to return to independent lifestyles and\nto participate in life activities like their counterparts.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAmukoa, P.
