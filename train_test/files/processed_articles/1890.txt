We sought to evaluate the\nassociation of HbA1c\n(A1C) with peripheral arterial disease in a representative sample of the U.S.\npopulation with and without diabetes.\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- A cross-sectional study was conducted\nyears of age. Peripheral arterial disease was defined as an ankle-brachial index 0.9 (n  327).\nRESULTS -- Among nondiabetic subjects, the age-standardized prevalence of peripheral ar-\nand 5.7\u00ad6.0%, respectively (P trend 0.001). The prevalence of peripheral arterial disease was\n7.5 and 8.8% for diabetic participants with A1C 7 and 7%, respectively. After multivariable\nadjustment and compared with nondiabetic participants with A1C 5.3%, the odds ratio (95%\nCI) of peripheral arterial disease for nondiabetic participants with an A1C of 5.3\u00ad5.4, 5.5\u00ad5.6,\nrespectively.\nCONCLUSIONS -- An association exists between higher levels of A1C and peripheral arte-\nrial disease, even among patients without diabetes. Individuals with A1C levels 5.3% should be\ntargeted for aggressive risk factor reduction, which may reduce the burden of subclinical car-\ndiovascular disease even among those without diabetes.\nThe risk for clinical cardiovascular\ndisease among individuals with dia-\nbetes is two to four times higher\ncompared with their counterparts with-\nout diabetes (1\u00ad4). Higher rates of sub-\nclinical cardiovascular disease among\npatients with diabetes have also been re-\nported (5\u00ad7). Among the population of\npatients with diabetes, homeostatic glyce-\nmic control may be an important mediat-\ning factor in preventing cardiovascular\ndisease (8).\nMore recently, some studies have\nnoted elevated levels of glycemia to be as-\nsociated with cardiovascular disease\namong the general population without di-\nabetes (9\u00ad13). For example, after exclud-\ning individuals with diabetes (i.e., self-\nreport of a previous diagnosis and/or\nfasting plasma glucose 140 mg/dl\nand/or a 2-h postchallenge plasma glu-\ncose 200 mg/dl), the multivariable ad-\njusted relative hazard of cardiovascular\ndisease mortality for women in the high-\nest quintile (6.7%) versus the lowest\nfour quintiles (6.7%) of HbA1c\ncho Bernardo Study (12). However, no\nassociation was present between A1C and\ncardiovascular morality among men in\nthis study.\nGiven the strong association between\nglycemic control and the development of\nclinical and subclinical cardiovascular\ndisease among diabetic patients and\nmounting evidence that mild abnormali-\nties of glucose metabolism may be associ-\nated with cardiovascular disease in\nnondiabetic individuals, we hypothesized\nthat a strong association may exist be-\ntween homeostatic glycemia and subclin-\nical cardiovascular disease among\npatients without diabetes. Therefore, we\nexamined the association between A1C\nand peripheral arterial disease among a\nnationally representative sample of U.S.\nadults participating in the National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey\nwas a cross-sectional survey of the civilian\nnoninstitutionalized population of the\nU.S. The procedures involved in\nlished in detail and are available online\n(14).

Of relevance to the\ncurrent analysis, variables collected dur-\ning the in-home interview were age, race/\nethnicity, sex, cigarette smoking, alcohol\nconsumption, physical activity, and a his-\ntory of diabetes. For the current analysis,\nrace/ethnicity was defined as non-\nHispanic white, non-Hispanic black,\nMexican American, and other. Partici-\npants who reported having smoked 100\ncigarettes during their lifetime were clas-\nsified as current or former smokers if they\nanswered affirmatively or negatively, re-\nspectively, to the question \"Do you smoke\ncigarettes now?\" Individuals were consid-\nered to be physically active if they re-\nported participating in any moderate,\nvigorous, or muscle strengthening activi-\nties in the preceding 30 days. Alcohol\nconsumption was defined as drinking, on\naverage, one or more beverages contain-\ning alcohol each week over the previous\nyear.\ntion procedures included measurements\nof waist circumference, blood pressure,\nand ABI. After asking the participant to lift\nup their shirt, waist circumference was\nmeasured at the iliac crest to the nearest\n0.1 cm. Up to three blood pressure mea-\nsurements were taken by a physician using\nthestandardprotocoloftheAmericanHeart\nAssociation during a single examination\nvisit. Blood pressure was measured with the\nparticipant in a seated position after 5 min\nof quiet rest. Systolic blood pressure was\ncalculated based on the average of all avail-\nable blood pressure measurements.\nFor individuals with at least one arm\nand weighing 400 lb, systolic blood\npressure for the ABI was measured via\nblood pressure cuffs on the right brachial\nartery and both posterior tibial arteries.\nmeasures were taken and averaged at each\nsite, whereas for individuals aged 60\nyears, one measure was taken at each site.\nFor individuals with conditions preclud-\ning measurement of the right arm, left\nbrachial artery systolic blood pressure\nwas taken. ABI was calculated for each\nankle as the ratio of the average ankle sys-\ntolic blood pressure to arm systolic blood\npressure. The smaller of the two measure-\nments was considered the ABI for this\nstudy. Individuals with ABI 1.5 may\nhave severe arterial rigidity and were\ntherefore excluded from all analyses (n \n10) (15).

C-reactive\nprotein was measured using latex-\nenhanced nephelometry, and total cho-\nlesterol was measured enzymatically.\nSerum creatinine was measured using the\nmodified Jaffe reaction with glomerular\nfiltration rate estimated by the abbrevi-\nated formula from the Modification of\nDiet in Renal Disease study after creati-\nnine calibration (18,19). Chronic kidney\ndisease was defined as an estimated glo-\nmerular filtration rate 60 ml  min1 \nsured at the University of Missouri Diabe-\ntes Diagnostic Laboratory using a\nmodified hexokinase enzymatic method.\nA1C was also measured at the University\nof Missouri using a boronate affinity high-\nperformance liquid chromatography sys-\ntem. Diabetes was defined as a serum\nglucose 126 mg/dl after fasting for a\nmg/dl for those who fasted 8 h before\ntheir NHANES visit, A1C 6.1%, and/or\nself-reported current use of antidiabetes\nmedication.\nStatistical analysis\nThe population was divided into six mu-\ntually exclusive groups based on diabetes\nstatus and A1C level. Individuals without\ndiabetes were categorized into quartile of\n6.0%), and individuals with diabetes\nwere categorized as having well-\ncontrolled diabetes or not (A1C 7 or\n7%, respectively). The age-standard-\nized characteristics of the study popula-\ntion were calculated for each of these six\ncategories, with trends across all six cate-\ngories, and across quartile of A1C among\nnondiabetic subjects, determined using\nmaximum likelihood estimation. For\ntrend analyses, diabetes and A1C groups\nwere ordered from lowest to highest as\nfollows: no diabetes and lowest to highest\nquartile of A1C, diabetes and A1C 7%,\nand diabetes and A1C 7%.\nThe age-standardized prevalence of\nperipheral arterial disease was calculated\nfor each A1C category for individuals\nwith and without diabetes. The odds ratio\n(OR) of peripheral arterial disease was cal-\nculated for each A1C level, with the low-\nest quartile of A1C among individuals\nwithout diabetes as the reference, using\nmultivariable logistic regression models.\nInitially, ORs were adjusted for age, and\nthen they were adjusted for age, race/\nethnicity, and sex, and finally they were\nadjusted for age, race/ethnicity, sex, sys-\ntolic blood pressure, current and former\ncigarette smoking, alcohol consumption,\nbeing physical active, waist circumfer-\nence, chronic kidney disease, total choles-\nterol, and C-reactive protein. Trends in\nthe OR of peripheral arterial disease\nacross A1C category were determined for\nthe full population and limited to nondi-\nabetic participants modeling A1C cate-\ngory as a continuous variable, using\nlogistic regression.\nThe age-adjusted; age-, race/ethnicity-,\nand sex-adjusted; and multivariable-\nadjusted OR of peripheral arterial disease\nassociated with 1\u00adpercentage point\u00ad\nhigher A1C was calculated, using logistic\nregression models. These ORs were calcu-\nlated for the full study population; indi-\nseparately; and, finally, for individuals\nwithout diabetes. The consistency of the\nassociation between 1\u00adpercentage point\u00ad\nhigher A1C and peripheral arterial disease\nacross important subgroups was deter-\nmined by logistic regression models strat-\nified by race/ethnicity, sex, and cigarette\nsmoking status.\nSample weights that account for the\nunequal probabilities of selection, over-\nsampling, and nonresponse were applied\nfor all analyses using SUDAAN (version\n8.0; Research Triangle Institute, Research\nTriangle Park, NC). SEs were estimated\nusing the Taylor series linearization\nmethod.\nRESULTS -- After age standardiza-\ntion, individuals with higher levels of A1C\nwere, on average, older, less likely to be\nfemale, and more likely to be non-\nHispanic black or Mexican American, ver-\nsus non-Hispanic white (Table 1).\nAdditionally, after age standardization,\nthose with higher levels of A1C were more\nlikely to be current smokers and had higher\nsystolicbloodpressure,largerwaistcircum-\nference, and higher C-reactive protein.\nAdditionally, age-standardized ABI was\nlower among individuals with higher lev-\nels of A1C.\nOverall, 327 study participants\nripheral arterial disease.

The definition of\ndiabetes used in the current study reflects\ncut points from evidence-based guide-\nlines (20). However, as noted in these\nguidelines, the risk of microvascular dis-\nease and target organ damage extends be-\nlow these cut points (20). The results of\nthe current study add to previously pub-\nlished evidence and suggest substantial\nbenefits of tight glycemic control, even\namong patients without diabetes.\nA meta-analysis of observational\nstudies has documented an increased risk\nof cardiovascular disease associated with\nhigher levels of A1C among patients with\ndiabetes (7). Specifically, the pooled rela-\ntive risk (RR) of cardiovascular disease for\neach 1\u00adpercentage point\u00adhigher A1C was\ndiabetes. Additionally, this study also in-\nvestigated the impact of A1C on periph-\neral arterial disease among patients with\ntype 2 diabetes. Three studies of A1C and\nperipheral arterial disease among type 2\ndiabetic patients were identified (21\u00ad23).\nEach of the identified studies reported\nA1C to be associated with a significant\nincreased RR of peripheral arterial dis-\nease. After pooling together the results\nfrom the three studies, the RR of periph-\neral arterial disease associated with 1\u00adper-\ndiabetes (7). Our study extends these\nfindings to a large nationally representa-\ntive population sample of nondiabetic pa-\ntients. Among nondiabetic patients in the\ncurrent study, each 1\u00adpercentage point\u00ad\nhigher A1C was associated with an age-,\nrace/ethnicity-, and sex-adjusted OR of\nripheral arterial disease.\nDespite consistent results among dia-\nbetic patients, studies of glucose metabo-\nlism abnormalities and cardiovascular\ndisease among nondiabetic patients have\nprovided inconsistent results (10,\nabetes participating in the European\nProspective Investigation of Cancer and\nNutrition (EPIC-Norfolk) study, the RR of\nall-cause mortality associated with A1C of\nwith their counterparts with A1C 5%,\nnested case-control study of the Women's\nHealth Study, the crude RR of cardiovas-\ncular disease among participants in the\nhighest versus lowest quartile of A1C was\nafter adjustment for additional factors, in-\ncluding blood pressure and C-reactive\nprotein, this association was no longer\npresent (RR 1.00). Among women in the\nRancho Bernardo study, higher A1C was\nnot associated with a significant increase\nin all-cause mortality, but it was associ-\nated with a significant increased relative\nhazard of cardiovascular disease and isch-\nemic heart disease mortality (12).

How-\never, no association between A1C and in-\ntima media thickness was present after\nmultivariable adjustment. Additionally,\namong 582 individuals at risk for diabe-\ntes, a significant age- and sex-adjusted as-\nsociation between A1C and intima-media\nthickness was no longer significant, with\nmultivariable adjustment (35). Among\nolder Caucasian adults without known\ndiabetes in the Hoorn study population,\neach 1\u00adpercentage point\u00adhigher A1C was\nassociated with a multivariable-adjusted\nOR of peripheral arterial disease of 1.35\nfound associations of higher rates of sub-\nclinical cardiovascular disease at higher\nlevels of glycemia (29). These latter stud-\nies are consistent with the results from the\ncurrent analysis; the multivariable-\nadjusted OR of peripheral arterial disease\npublished data from the Diabetes Control\nand Complications Trial have shown that\nthe risk of retinopathy progression, mi-\ncroalbuminuria, and neuropathy in-\ncreased continuously with higher levels of\nA1C over its entire range.\nPeripheral arterial disease is a partic-\nularly strong prognostic indicator of fu-\nture clinical cardiovascular disease\nevents, and the importance of its recogni-\ntion has been highlighted in several\neasily diagnosed in clinical practice at\nminimal cost. It should be recognized that\nin the late stages of diabetes, calcification\nand increased arterial wall stiffness may\nlead to false elevations in ankle blood\npressure. It is not clear whether such\nchanges occur early in the disease pro-\ncess, but, if so, our findings may be more\nrobust than indicated by the data.\nDespite the potential benefits of low-\nering A1C noted in the current study, to\nour knowledge there is no clinical trial\ndata showing that the risk of cardiovascu-\nlar and peripheral arterial diseases is re-\nduced by the continued reduction of A1C\nbelow 6.1%. However, one of the primary\naims of the Action to Control Cardiovas-\ncular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial is\nto assess whether a therapeutic strategy\ntargeting an A1C of 6.0% will reduce\nthe rate of cardiovascular disease events\nRecruitment for Action to Control Car-\ndiovascular Risk in Diabetes began in\nThe results presented for the current\nstudy need to be interpreted in the con-\ntext of the study's limitations. Most nota-\nbly, the cross-sectional nature of the\npresent study limits assessment of the\ncausal nature of the association between\nA1C and peripheral arterial disease. Ad-\nditionally, although the sample size was\nlarge, the power to detect associations and\neffect modification was limited because of\nthe low prevalence of peripheral arterial\ndisease. For example, although elevated\nORs of peripheral arterial disease were\npresent when comparing nondiabetic pa-\nand included the null. Given the graded\nnature of the association detected, with a\nlarger sample size, these ORs most likely\nwould have been statistically significant.\nAdditionally, although we analyzed pa-\ntients with diabetes separately, NHANES\nthe oral glucose tolerance test. Therefore,\nsome patients classified as not having di-\nabetes in the current study, based on se-\nmay have impaired glucose tolerance.\nPrevious studies indicate the association\nwith subclinical cardiovascular disease\nmay be stronger for elevated postchal-\nlenge glucose levels and spikes, compared\nwith higher A1C (35). An additional lim-\nitation is that because of time constraints\nduring the NHANES visit, ABI was mea-\nsured only in the posterior tibial artery,\nand the dorsalis pedis artery pressure was\nnot measured. Finally, only a subsample\nwere asked to fast overnight before their\nstudy visit. An association between higher\nfasting serum glucose and peripheral ar-\nterial disease appeared to be present (data\nnot shown). However, the CIs were wide\nbecause of the limited number of cases in\nthe fasting NHANES subsample.\nDespite these limitations, there are\nseveral strengths involved in the current\nstudy. This study involved a nationally\nrepresentative sample of the U.S. popula-\ntion 40 years of age. Additionally, all\ndata were collected following rigorous\nmethodology, including a study protocol\nwith quality control checks.\nIn conclusion, higher levels of A1C\namong nondiabetic patients may be an in-\ndicator of increased risk of subclinical\ncardiovascular disease. A significant in-\ncreased risk of peripheral arterial disease\nwas noted at A1C levels between 5.7 and\n6.0% among nondiabetic patients.
