We investigate the association between the multigenerational household\ncontext and health of older adults in India, taking into account potential selection effects.\nMethods. Using data from the India Human Development Survey (2004\u00ad05), a nationally\nrepresentative multitopic data set, we employed a two-step analytical strategy--logistic\nregression followed by propensity score stratification method--to model the effect of\ncontrasting living arrangement types on short-term illness.\nResults. Overall, older adults living in multigenerational households have the lowest\nlevels of short-term illness. Among them, those who live with their spouse, adult chil-\ndren, and young grandchildren experience the highest health gains. Health advantage\ndiminishes when older adults live only with a spouse and adult children, and further\ndiminishes when they live only with their spouse. Solitary living is associated with the\nhighest likelihood of short-term morbidity. Good health is also shown to be associated\nwith household wealth, gender, household size, and urban residence.\nDiscussion. Our study demonstrates that multigenerational households--the traditional\nand the most dominant form of living arrangement in India--have protective health\nbenefits for older adults, while taking into account potential selection mechanisms. On\nContrary to some epidemiological studies, we do not find any elevated risk of exposure to\nshort-term illness, when older adults are living in households with young grandchildren.\n",

India is also experiencing globalization led changes\nsuch as rapid urbanization and out-migration of younger\nadults that are often associated with a rise in nuclear liv-\ning and diminishing preference for intergenerational coresi-\n1963). How these forces are changing the Indian family sys-\ntem stand contested (Allendorf, 2013; Caldwell, Reddy, &\nagree that it raises critical questions about the caregiving\nframework of older adults, especially given that the share\nof India's older adult population (ages 60 and above) is pro-\nequate government funded institutional support (e.g., social\nsecurity provisions, health insurance, and public health sys-\ntems) have increased health and economic vulnerabilities of\nThese emerging sociocultural and demographic trends make\nIndia an excellent site to examine the link between house-\nhold structure and health of older persons.\nThe linkage between coresidence and older adult wellbe-\ning lacks conceptual and empirical clarity. For example, in\nsettings where public or private formal systems of care are\ninadequate, coresidence is often associated with (i) higher\nlevels of material well-being and, (ii) higher probability of\nreceiving informal support that are directly dependent on\nYount, 2009). At the same time, other studies report no clear\ngain for older people from coresidence, especially in terms of\nhealthcare or support in activities of daily living (Hashimoto,\nconundrum and a resilient cultural context of multigenera-\ntional living and family-based old-age support in India, we\nask: Does living in a multigenerational household really have\nprotective health benefits for older adults in India?\nThough descriptive studies on the patterns and changes of\nliving arrangements are not entirely new in India (Agarwal,\nSathyanarayana, Kumar, & James, 2012), a systematic\nexamination of living arrangements and health has been\nmissing. This omission reflects a general belief that older\nadults are automatically provided for in multigenerational\nhouseholds (Kochar, 1999) and hence enjoy better health.\nIn this article, we empirically question this belief and in the\nprocess offer a nuanced classification of multigenerational\nhouseholds to examine its differential effect on health of\nolder Indians. In particular, we argue that previous studies\non living arrangement and health have made limited efforts\nin adjusting for confounding effects. For instance, a positive\nassociation between coresidence and good health could be\nconfounded by wealth, i.e., if multigenerational households\nare wealthier than the nuclear ones, older adults coresiding\nin multigenerational households are more likely to report\nbetter health than those living alone or only with spouse.\nAdditionally, selection bias could lead to less healthier\nadults living in multigenerational households. For example,\none could argue that older people who are more prone to\nillness (and hence in need for higher levels of assistance) are\nmore likely to coreside with adult children.\nDrawing data from a cross sectional survey--India\npensity score stratification technique in addition to the\nstandard regression models. After adjusting for selection,\nwe find evidence of a positive association between multi-\ngenerational living and good health among older Indians.\nWe conclude by emphasizing the need to examine the path-\nways through which these health gains are reaped in multi-\ngenerational settings.\nLiving Arrangements and Health of Older Adults:\nTheoretical Considerations\nCoresidence with adult children may serve as the best means\nof ensuring the day-to-day needs of the older population\nare met in developing societies (UN DESA, 2005). Family\nthat coresidence is one among many social transfers towards\nolder parents that originate within the boundaries of the kin\ngroup. Multigenerational families may act as a \"convoy\"\n(Antonucci et al., 1987) that helps the aged successfully\nnegotiate life's challenges in terms of monetary and non-\nmonetary support (e.g., care during illnesses). Older adults\ncan gain access to both economic capital (e.g., household\nincome, loans, and investments) and embodied cultural cap-\nital (knowledge and good practices learned through expo-\nsure to extra-familial networks) thereby further enhancing\npositive outcomes within a multigenerational setting.\nFurthermore, family support as a form of social capi-\ntal (Bourdieu, 1985) may also provide intergenerational\nsolidarity (Bengtson & Roberts, 1991) through normative,\nfunctional and structural dimensions of family support.\nParent\u00adchild interactions are limited not only to affection,\nresource-sharing, and emotional support but also extend to\nfamilism (norms or expectations of individual obligations to\nthe family). Arguably, the demand for coresidence as a source\nof social capital may be heightened in societies with a domi-\nnant sense of filial obligation. Since these societies are often\ncharacterized by low levels of elderly-care infrastructure, lim-\nited social provisions and high levels of out-of-pocket health\nexpenditure (Chemali, Chahine, & Sibai, 2008; Irudaya\nRajan, 2006), family support emerges as a crucial alternative.\nLiving Arrangements and Health of Older Adults:\nStudies from India and beyond\nA rich set of studies (Irudaya Rajan & Kumar, 2003;\nSathyanarayana et al.,2012) have focused on how headship,\nhousehold size, and marital status are associated with the\nliving arrangements of older Indians. A related body of lit-\nerature, gradually gaining currency is the link between fam-\nily structure, social networks, and older adult well-being\n(Berkman, Sekher, Capistrant, & Zheng, 2012; Samanta,\nhave provided region/city specific empirical estimates of\ndisease burden among older persons. With the availability\nof nationally representative data (National Sample Survey,\namong older adults, later studies (Irudaya Rajan, 2006)\nhave provided detailed description of the disease profile\nof older persons. Surprisingly, a simultaneous examination\nof the household structure and health is missing from the\nempirical sociological/gerontological literature on India.\nSpecifically, Sen & Noon (2007) found that older adults in\nextended family settings enjoyed significant health advan-\ntage through lower likelihood of illness but no clear gains\nin terms of treatment seeking behavior. Pal (2004) con-\ncluded that coresiding with adult children was often associ-\nated with higher household incomes, but the likelihood of\na coresidential arrangement was determined by the older\nparents' financial assets and property ownership.\nOverall, in other settings where intergenerational ties\nare traditionally strong, coresiding with adult children has\nshown to have beneficial effects on the wellbeing of older\npersons despite changing socioeconomic conditions. For\nexample, rural Taiwanese elders living alone had higher\nlevels of stress than elders in other types of living arrange-\nments (Hermalin & Yang, 2004). In China, older adults liv-\ning alone were disadvantaged in all measures of physical\nhighlighting the importance of family and cultural context\nto the wellbeing of the older persons. Furthermore, studies\nof gender differences in coresidence (Knodel & Ofstedal,\nnot only have higher likelihoods of living with adult chil-\ndren but also experience better wellbeing outcomes than\nolder men, primarily because of older women's poorer\nhealth, widowhood status and fewer economic resources.\nCuriously, although family support for the aged has\nremained the traditional ideal type for most develop-\ning societies, a handful of studies on Asia, Africa, and the\nMiddle East have reported less conclusive findings on the\nassociation between coresidence and older adult wellbe-\ning. Specifically, Kochar (1999) in her analysis of familial\nsupport for medical expenditure of older persons in rural\nPakistan, Hashimoto (1991) in a seven-country study and\nSibai and colleagues (2009) in Lebanon found that any\nbenefits from coresidence for older adult wellbeing were\nunclear.\nA contrary line of research emerges from epidemiological\nthat argue that older adults living in multigenerational\nhouseholds are more prone to illness due to the presence\nof young children. These studies demonstrate a consistent\nassociation between coresidential grand parenting and the\nspread of influenza and other respiratory infections, even\nafter controlling for socioeconomic status. Where coresi-\ndential living is prevalent, it is reasonable to assume that\nolder adults suffering from chronic disease or disability\nwould be more likely to coreside with their adult children\nand grandchildren. Since chronic disease and disability\nare often positively associated with short-term morbidity,\nhigher rates of coresidence would imply increased short-\nterm illnesses for older adults living with adult children.\nA review of earlier work clearly demonstrates that while\nthe association between living arrangement and older\nadult well-being remains somewhat mixed, positive asso-\nciations are more common than negative ones. This study\ndeparts from earlier research by developing a typology of\nhousehold classification which captures the heterogeneity\nof Indian multigenerational households. In addition, we\nattempt to estimate the effect of confounding in a cross-\nsectional study design with a two-step approach: regression\nanalysis followed by propensity score stratification.\nMethods\nData\nWe rely on the India Human Development Survey (2004\u00ad\n05; henceforth IHDS) for our empirical investigation. The\ners from the University of Maryland and the National\nCouncil of Applied Economic Research (NCAER, India).\nThe nationally representative survey fielded face-to-face\ninterviews with people from 41,554 households located\nies in India. The survey collected information on income,\nconsumption, employment, health, and different aspects of\ngender and family relationships from both male and female\ncollected from these households. For detailed information\non the study design see Desai and colleagues (2010).\nThe IHDS administered two sets of questionnaires: a\nhousehold economic questionnaire and a health and educa-\ntion questionnaire. The household economic questionnaire\nwas administered to the individual with the most knowl-\nedge of household income and expenditures, typically, the\nmale head of household. Our living arrangement variable\nis constructed from the household roster, where all house-\nhold members were identified by their relationship to the\nhousehold head.\nHealth information including questions on short-term\nillnesses of any family members in the last 30 days, were\ncollected in the education and health questionnaire, typi-\ncally administered to the wife of the household head. In the\nabsence of the older woman in multigenerational house-\nholds, proxy reports were collected from a daughter or a\ndaughter-in-law. Some differences in reporting of illness\nwere observed between older women and their daughters or\ndaughters-in-law; to adjust for this potential difference we\ninclude the identity of the respondent as a control variable.\nThe older adult sample (individuals aged 60 and above)\nand 8,941 are older females. Older adults constitute about\n8% of the weighted sample. Regional variations in the\nproportion of older adults are marked; ranging from 13%\nin the southern state of Kerala to 5% in the north-eastern\nstate of Assam.\nMeasures\nWe focus on conceptualizing the \"living arrangement\" vari-\nable by building on earlier research (e.g., Chen & Short,\nour focus on the heterogeneity of multigenerational house-\nholds. We classify living arrangement into six mutually\nexclusive groups:\n1. Living alone: Older adults who are living on their own;\n2. Living with spouse only: Older adults who are living\nonly with their spouse;\n3. Living with spouse and adult children: Those living\nwith their spouses and adult children only;\n4. Multigenerational living with spouse, adult children,\nand young grandchildren: Older persons in multigen-\nerational households where they are living with their\nspouses, adult children, and at least one grandchild\nwhose age is 8 years or younger.\n5. Multigenerational living with spouse, adult children\nand no young grandchildren: Older adults in multi-\ngenerational households where they are living with\ntheir spouses, adult children, and others (e.g. nephew/\nniece, siblings, servants, and other relatives) but without\nyounger grandchildren. That is, this category explicitly\nexcludes any minors of age 8 or below.\n6. Living with others: A residual category of older adults\nin households which do not belong to the any of the\npreceding categories. Figure 1 shows the living arrange-\nments of the older persons in the IHDS sample for the\nThese six categories will help us examine how variations\nin age groups and familial forms have differential effects\non the health of older adults. For example, in addition to\ninvestigating the differential effects of solitary living ver-\nsus living with a spouse, the current typology will help us\nunderstand if different types of coresidence with younger\ngenerations (i.e., categories 3, 4, and 5) have varying levels\nof health outcomes for older persons. Categories 4 and 5\nhave been separated out to examine if older adults living\nwith younger (below the age of 8) grandchildren are at a\nhigher risk of infection exposure than those coresiding only\nwith adult members. This enables us to examine the epi-\ndemiological dimension of the living arrangement\u00adhealth\nrelationship. Similarly, living arrangement categories 3 and\n4 distinguish whether the coresidence with grandchildren\n(or lack thereof) shape elderly health outcomes through\npositive lifestyle changes (e.g., quit smoking or drinking) or\nphysical strain (as a result of caregiving responsibilities) as\nsuggested by studies on grand-parenthood in Asia (Chen &\nBased on this conceptualization of living arrangements,\nour data indicates that about 2% (n = 398) of older adults\nlive alone, about 9% (n = 1,647) live only with their\ntional households with their spouse, adult children, and\nmultigenerational households that include their spouse,\nadult children, and others (e.g., nephew/niece, siblings, and\nother relatives), but without younger grandchildren, and\nin households that include a combination of familial and\nnonfamilial members apart from the spouse. Hence, the\noverall story is one of coresidence with younger genera-\ntions in a multigenerational setting.\nWe study health in terms of short-term morbidity:\ncough, fever, or diarrhea. The likelihood of being sick with\none of these minor illnesses is defined as a categorical vari-\nable that takes the value of \"1\" if a person was sick in the\nlast 30 days and \"0\" if they remained healthy. The IHDS\ndata indicates about 11% of older adults reported short-\nterm morbidity in the last 30 days. Our focus on short-\nterm morbidity reduces the problem of endogeneity, as it is\nunlikely, that short-term morbidity among older adults will\nmotivate their living arrangement decisions. Hence, short-\nterm morbidity is more plausibly a consequence of living\narrangements rather than a cause, although the possibility\nof reverse causation cannot be altogether ruled out.\nControl variables in the current analysis include house-\nhold background characteristics-caste, religion, place of\nresidence (rural/urban) as well as individual characteris-\ntics (gender, education, employment, and marital status) of\nthe older person. Household wealth is measured using a\ncount of consumer goods owned by the household from a\nlist of 30 household goods and amenities; household goods\nsuch as a chair or table, television, car, credit card, etc.,\nand household amenities such as a flush toilet, LPG, and\nelectricity. Education is measured by completed years of\nschooling ranging from 0= no education through 15 years=\ngraduate. Marital status is measured as a two category var-\niable, currently married, and widowed/single. Other mari-\ntal status categories, such as divorced, separated, or absent\nspouse are merged with the widowed/single category as\ntheir sample sizes are extremely small (very low divorce\nrates among the older cohorts). Additional income received\nby older persons, such as a pension, has been measured by\nreceipt of any government pension including National Old\nAge Pension (NOAP), disability pension or the widow pen-\nsion in the last 12 months.\nIndia has a stratified society and social distances in\nterms of residential segregation, language, identity forma-\ntion, and occupations still separate upper and lower castes\n& Sen, 2013). This paper distinguishes five major caste\ngroups-high caste Brahmin 7.28%, other backward castes\ntribes (ST) 6.3%, and other castes (28.3%). In the Indian\ncaste system, the OBCs, STs, and SCs are considered to be\nlower order social groups and SCs and STs are typically at\nthe bottom on most indicators of well-being (Desai et al.,\ngroups: Hindu (81%), Muslim (11%), Christian (3 %),\nSikh (3%), and other religion (2%). Respondents are clas-\nsified as living in rural (65%) or urban (35%) areas based\non the Indian census definition. Additionally, models also\ncontrol for the older person's work status conceptualized as\neconomic participation in any sector including wage or sal-\nary work, household business, farm work, or animal care.\nResidential arrangements vary widely across India so\nwe control for the rural or urban place of residence and\nstate dummies for 22 major states in all regression models.\nHealth studies on India have consistently demonstrated that\nhealth outcomes are consequences not only of household\nlevel factors but also of the larger regional context within\nwhich individuals are embedded (Parashar, 2005).Table 1\nprovides descriptive statistics of the dependent and inde-\npendent variables.\nAnalytical Strategy\nThe study follows a two-step analytical strategy to\nempirically test the association between living arrange-\nments and health of older people. In the first step, we esti-\nmate a logistic regression model using our six category\ntypology as the key independent variable. The goal is to\nunderstand the several different effects of living arrange-\nment types on the probability of short-term illness among\nolder persons, after controlling for socioeconomic and\ndemographic correlates. In the second step, we perform a\nstratified propensity score analysis to adjust for potential\nselection effects.\nTable 1. Descriptive Statistics of the Dependent and\nIndependent Variables Used in the Analyses\nVariable Mean (SD) Range\nWhether ill with any short-term\nillness (dependent variable)\nCaste: Lower castes (OBCs,\nSCs, STs)\nPropensity score methods borrow the language of exper-\niments, i.e., treatment group and the control (or untreated)\ngroup. In our case, both \"treatment\" and \"control\" are dif-\nferent living arrangement types, utilizing the same six cate-\ngory living arrangement typology as the logistic regression.\nSpecifically, the \"control\" is the multigenerational living\narrangement type where older adults co-reside with their\nspouse, adult children, and grandchildren (includes at least\none grandchild whose age is 8 years or lower), while the\ndifferent treatment groups are the remaining contrasting\nliving arrangement categories. The logic of propensity score\nmethods is based on the influential counterfactual frame-\nwork of Neyman-Rubin where propensity score is defined\nas the conditional probability of receiving treatment given\nobserved covariates (see Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1983).\nOnce propensity scores have been estimated, if the treated\nand controlled groups have similar propensity scores, the\nobserved covariates are automatically controlled.Therefore\nany differences between \"treatment\" and \"control\" groups\nmay be attributed to the receipt of treatment and not as a\nresult of observed covariates, thus accomplishing improved\ncontrol for confounding (Guo et al., 2010).\nFor the purpose of this analysis, we have used psmatch2\n(Leuven & Sianesi, 2003), a user developed program avail-\nable in STATA, which includes pscore and att programs.\nResults\nResults from Logistic Regression Analysis\nIn our preliminary analyses, we experimented with differ-\nent reference categories of the living arrangement typology.\nWe report results from the model where coresiding in a\nmultigenerational household with spouse, adult children,\nand grandchildren (includes younger grandchildren) was\ntreated as the baseline category. This model provides com-\npelling evidence in support of our hypothesis of a positive\nassociation between multigenerational living and good\nhealth. Hence for the sake of parsimony and clarity, we pre-\nsent odds ratios only for this model in Table 2. The logistic\nregression model controls for demographic and socioeco-\nnomic factors, such as age, gender, marital status, educa-\ntion, pension provisions, place of residence, and wealth.\nFor the logistic regression, the overwhelming story is\nthat coresidence in a multigenerational household (with\nspouse, adult children and at least one grandchildren aged\n8 or lower) is associated with the highest health gains\nfor older persons. Our household classification typology\nfacilitates a ranking of this health advantage thereby high-\nlighting the differential health effects of the heterogene-\nous familial forms. Compared to the baseline category\n(coresiding with spouse, adult children, and young grand-\nchildren), older adults living with spouse, adult children\nand others, but no young grandchildren (category 5 in the\nget sick, holding all other variables constant. The health\nolder adults are living with spouse and adult children\n(category 3 in the typology) and worsens further (OR:\n(category 2 in the typology). As demonstrated in earlier\nresearch (Chen & Short, 2008), solitary living is asso-\nciated with worst health outcomes; they are more than\ntheir counterparts coresiding with spouse, adult children,\nand grandchildren, holding all other variables constant.\nConsistent with studies conducted on Asia, living with a\nspouse has protective health effects, suggesting the crucial\nrole of the spouse as a support provider (UN DESA, 2005)\nand the general health benefits associated with marriage\nTable 2. Odds Ratios from Multivariate Logistic Regression\nof Living Arrangements and Selected Covariates on the\nLikelihood of Being Sick Among Older Adults in India,\nPredictor variables Odds ratios\nLiving Arrangements (ref: living with\nspouse, adult children, and grandchildren)\n With spouse and adult children 1.369***\n\nWith spouse and adult children,\nno young (<8 year) grandchildren\nEducation (high school)\nCaste categories (Brahmin)\nReligion categories (Hindu)\nNo. of persons in the household 0.957***\nfor each covariate appear in italics.

Thus,\nmultigenerational households improve older adults' health\nin part because they are larger, but also because of the sup-\nports uniquely available in intergenerational living arrange-\nments. Though not explored in this article, the independent\neffects of (adult) kin availability may come in terms of bet-\nter health awareness, greater degree of attention and over-\nall help in day to day activities of older persons. This is\nconsistent with previous studies (UN DESA, 2005) on the\ndeveloping world, where kin availability seems to play an\nimportant role in determining living arrangements.\nFinally, contrary to the epidemiological concerns of\ndisease risk, out study showed that older adults in mul-\ntigenerational households with younger (aged 8 or lower)\ngrandchildren have similar odds of being sick as those with-\nout young grandchildren suggesting that increased likelihood\nof infection due to younger grandchildren does not seem to\nproduce an empirically observable effect. We refrain from\ninterpreting the health effect of living arrangement category\n6 (living with unspecified others) due to the ambiguous mix\nof familial and nonfamilial bonds in those households.\nOur results also shows that sociodemographic controls\nsuch as gender, urban place of residence, the number of\ncoresiding persons, and greater household wealth are sig-\nnificant factors improving the good health of older Indians.\nThese findings are consistent across all logistic regression\nmodels that we fitted as part of our preliminary analyses\n(results not reported). For example, Table 2 demonstrates\nthat an older woman has higher odds of being ill than an\nolder man (OR\nfemale\narchal structure and the associated cultural and economic\ndependence on husbands and (male) children (Lamb, 1999;\nSengupta & Agree, 2003), perhaps it is no surprise why\nolder women are likely to experience higher morbidity risks.\nAs expected, older persons who live in wealthier house-\nholds (OR\nstandard of living\nurban areas (OR\nurban\nern sanitation facilities, clean fuel and generally have better\naccess to healthcare) appear to have lower odds of being sick\nwith cough, fever, or diarrhea than those from poorer house-\nholds and those residing in rural areas. Education seems to\nbe a surprisingly marginal factor in influencing health out-\ncomes. This finding is consistent with earlier work on socio-\neconomic correlates of living arrangements in the developing\nworld (UN DESA, 2005), where no clear pattern emerged\nbetween educational attainment and living arrangement.\nResults from Propensity Score Stratification\nAnalysis\nWe adopt propensity score stratification technique to\nexamine if the dominant finding of the protective role of\nmultigenerational households, as obtained from the pre-\nvious logistic regression analysis, is consistent, even after\ncontrolling for confounding factors. Typically, researchers\n(Landrum & Ayanian, 2002) have used quintiles of esti-\nmated propensity scores to create strata. But given the dis-\ntribution of the propensity score in the study sample, we\nhave created the strata such that there are adequate cases\nin both the \"treatment\" and \"control\" groups. In particular,\nwe define the \"control\" group as the (multigenerational)\nliving arrangement category in which the older adult is\ncoresiding with the spouse, adult children and young grand-\nchildren (category 4 in the typology). The \"treatment\"\ngroups are the remaining contrasting living arrangement\ncategories. In particular,\"Treatment 1\" is the solitary living\ncategory, \"Treatment 2\" is living with spouse, \"Treatment\n3\" is living with spouse and adult children, \"Treatment 5\"\nis living with spouse and adult children, but without young\ngrandchildren. We do not include living with (unspeci-\nfied) others category (category 6 in the typology) in this\nanalysis. Consistent with the previous regression analysis,\nwe generate propensity scores for each pair of \"control\"\nand \"treatment\" groups by estimating a series of propen-\nsity score models. Again, this is done to investigate if the\nlikelihood of being sick can be attributed to the differing\nliving arrangement types, after controlling for confounding\nfrom other individual and household levels variables, such\nas age, gender, marital status and wealth. In the propensity\nscore methods, comparisons across groups are made only\nfor households basically similar on these variables whereas\nthe logistic regression models compare all households even\nthose where the control variables do not overlap much\nbetween household types.\nTable 3 describes the treatment (and control) sample\nsizes for each propensity score stratum. For instance, in\ntrol\" group (i.e. coresiding with spouse, adult children and\nyoung grandchildren) has a sample size of 3,107 and the\nassociated \"treatment 2\" group (i.e. living with spouse\nonly) has a sample size of 215. Again for the same stratum,\nthe \"control\" group has a sample size of 1,083, while the\n\"treatment 3\" group (i.e. living with spouse and adult chil-\ndren) has a sample size of 90.\nEstimates of the overall impact of living arrangement\ntypes on short-term illness were obtained by calculat-\ning a weighted average of the stratum specific differences\n(Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1984) and are reported in Table 4.\nSpecifically, both Column A and B show difference in short-\nterm illness between \"control\" and \"treatment\" groups, but\nthey differ by the weighting strategy. Column A is weighted\nby the overall sample size of the propensity score stratum\nwhereas Column B is weighted by the sample size of the\ntreatment. Both weighting strategies are reported to dem-\nonstrate statistical robustness and the results are consistent.\nOverall, after controlling for confounding, results from\nthe propensity analysis echo the ones found in our previ-\nous logistic regression analysis. The control group, (multi-\ngenerational living with spouse, adult children and young\ngrandchildren), is associated with the lowest probability of\nbeing sick compared to each of the treatment groups. The\ndifference is smallest for the group living with a spouse and\nadult children but no young grandchildren, who have only\nabout a 1% point higher likelihood of falling sick than the\ncontrol group. Again, compared to the control group, those\nliving with a spouse and adult children have less than 6%\npoint higher chance of short-term illness and those living\nonly with their spouse have about a 6\u00ad10% point higher\nchances of short-term illness that those in the multigenera-\ntional control group. Solitary living is again associated with\nhighest probability of being ill: about a 25% point higher\nchance than the control group.\nDiscussion\nIn a cultural context where coresidence is common and\nintergenerational social contract is expected and main-\ntained, the general understanding is that living in a mul-\ntigenerational household will contribute to health gains.\nThe benefits, as some international studies suggest, come in\nthe form of material advantage, intrafamily support trans-\nfers, better health awareness, active grandparenting roles,\nhealthier lifestyles, and help with day to day activities as a\nresult of physical proximity (Chen & Liu, 2012; Chen &\nYount, 2009). Yet another set of studies show negative or\nno clear health advantage for older adults living in a mul-\ntigenerational setting, highlighting selection, both change\nand continuity of demographic realities, normative con-\ntexts, and socioeconomic environments (Hashimoto, 1991;\nGiven this empirical ambiguity about the potential of\nhousehold structure as an important determinant of older\nadult health, we asked: if the traditionally preferred mul-\ntigenerational living arrangement has health benefits for\nolder adults in India, a country that is experiencing dra-\nmatic economic and societal transformations? Our answer\nto this question is a qualified yes. The substantive finding\nfrom our two-step analyses (logistic regression followed by\npropensity score analysis to adjust for selection effects), is\nthat multigenerational households provide highest health\ngains to older Indians. We extend earlier work on living\narrangements by examining the heterogeneity of multigen-\nerational living by separating out those living with young\ngrandchildren and those without, in addition to specify-\ning the other conventional living arrangement categories\nadopted by most studies. This greater detail enables us to\ntest if living in a multigenerational household with grand-\nchildren has any differential effect on their health as com-\npared to each other living arrangement types.\nFirst, consistent with the existing literature (Chen &\nShort, 2008), our findings from both the logistic regres-\nsion as well as propensity score analysis show that soli-\ntary living is associated with highest likelihood of being\nsick. Living with spouse reduces the health disadvantage.\nThough, contrary to studies in the West, where living with\nspouse is shown to be the optimal living arrangement, liv-\ning with both spouse and adult children is more beneficial\nin the Indian context. In particular, living with grand-\nchildren (three generation households) is better than liv-\ning with adult children only (two generation households).\nThis could be as a result of more active lifestyles adopted\nby older grandparents--who might also be caregivers--\ngreater support received in day to day activities and health\nawareness through closer family ties, interaction, and the\ncompanionship of grandchildren (Chen & Liu, 2012; Ku\nTable 3. \"Treatment\" and \"Control\" Sample Sizes per Propensity Score Stratum\nPropensity\nscore strata\n\"Treatment 1\":\nliving alone\nN\ncontrol\n(N\ntreatment\n)\n\"Treatment 2\": living\nonly with spouse\nN\ncontrol\n(N\ntreatment\n)\n\"Treatment 3\": living\nwith spouse and\nadult children N\ncontrol\n(N\ntreatment\n)\n\"Treatment 4\": living with\nspouse and adult children,\nbut no young grandchildren\nN\ncontrol\n(N\ntreatment\n)\nNote.

The study defines the multigenerational living arrangement in which older adults live with their spouse, adult children, and young grand-\nchildren as the \"control\" group.\nTable 4.

IHDS 2004\u00ad05; SE in parentheses. SEs are from two-sample t tests.).\nAdditionally, young ages of grandchildren do not appear\nto produce detrimental health effects on older members in\nthe household. In particular, older adults in multigenera-\ntional households with grandchildren are as likely to fall sick\nas those without grandchildren, suggesting that the elevated\nrisk of infection due to younger children does not produce\nan empirically observable effect. This finding is contrary to\nwhat has been suggested by several epidemiological studies\non coresident grand parents with elevated risks of infec-\ntion from younger grandchildren. Our explanation to this\nunusual finding is that most of such studies have been in\nthe West, where multigenerational households are rare and\nformed often as a response to financial difficulties, illness,\ndivorce and adolescent childbearing (Cohen et al., 2011;\nGoodman & Silverstein, 2002). For these households, the\nsignificantly worse health conditions among grandparents\nmay in part reflect their low socioeconomic status (Hughes\net al., 2007). However, in India, multigenerational house-\nholds are generally wealthier (Sathyanarayana et al., 2012;\nalso found in this study) which may account for the rever-\nsal in the observed effect.\nWe note some limitations of this study. Though we\nconfirm the empirical validity of a positive association\nbetween multigenerational living and good health, we\nhave not yet addressed the pathways through which this\nis achieved. The statistical models have been able to rule\nout possibilities of confounding (e.g., wealth, age, and\ndisease risk), but we have not delineated the pathways.\nIntergenerational ties and support transfers are com-\nplex, dialectical processes, and a careful examination\nof these mechanisms remained outside the scope of this\nstudy. Although we observe a differential health advan-\ntage between three-generation (i.e., with grandchildren)\nversus two-generation (i.e., only adult children) house-\nholds, we did not examine the motivating factors, which\ncould be rooted in issues of grandparenthood, gender\nrole expectations, and family dynamics. We believe these\nremain important themes for future research efforts in\ngerontological research in India.\nWe have earlier argued that this study has provided\nstronger empirical support for the association between\nmultigenerational coresidence and the good health of\nolder persons in India. This is not to suggest that we have\nestablished causality. Rather, we would like to note that\neven though propensity score methods balance observed\ncovariates between control and treatment groups (and\nhence reduce the effects of confounding), they still can-\nnot balance unmeasured characteristics (Guo & Fraser,\nafter adjusting for confounding, interpretation of the\nresults of this study can best be described as supporting\nan association and not causation. We expect that the high-\nquality panel data initiatives underway (e.g., WHO-SAGE\nand LASI) will provide a useful next step to investigate\nthese causal mechanisms more appropriately. These limi-\ntations notwithstanding, evidence from this investigation\nhighlights the importance of multigenerational households\nin shaping health outcomes of older Indians. Identifying\ncrucial pathways will considerably advance future research\nin the realm of intergenerational ties, grandparenthood,\nand family relations in India.\n"
