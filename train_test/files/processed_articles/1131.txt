The SIPP originated as a project\nof the Social Security Administration in the 1970s\n(U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1986). The survey is\ndesigned to help determine how various personal\nand social conditions affect the level and stability of\npersonal and household economic well-being in the\nUnited States. The rehabilitation model (see, e.g.,\nO'Brien, 2001), where functional impairment is to be\novercome in order to mitigate conditions that would\nbe disabling or otherwise cause difficulties, underlies\nthe SIPP inquiries about deafness and hearing loss\nPrecisely how questions about hearing loss and\ndeafness are phrased strongly influences who is\ncounted and who is excluded from the count during\nthe enumeration process. This sensitivity to the selec-\ntion of indicators is a critical issue for researchers,\npolicy makers, businesses, educators, providers of\nhealth and social services, and other interested groups\nor consumers of research findings. The demography of\ndeafness in the United States based upon the SIPP\ndoes not provide the same profile as that obtained\nfrom, say, the NHIS because hearing loss and deafness\nare not defined identically across surveys (see, e.g.,\nLucas, Schiller, & Benson, 2004; note that estimates\nfor the number of persons with hearing loss from the\nNHIS are appreciably larger than those from the SIPP\ndue, in part, to differences in how questions are\nphrased). Here, careful attention is given to who is\nbeing identified as a person with hearing loss or deaf-\nness in the SIPP.\nAt its most basic level, demographic analysis is about\nstudying changes in the size, growth rate, and composi-\ntion of a population. It is important to remember that\nno matter how a population is defined, there are\nonly two ways of entering it: being born into it; or\nmigrating into it. If the definition of the popula-\ntion includes a social element in addition to the\ncustomary geographic/temporal elements, the\n``migration'' can include a change in the social\nlabel, a process often referred to as ``social mobil-\nity.'' (Preston, Heuveline, & Guillot, 2001, p. 2)\nOn the surface, it seems perfectly straightforward\nto talk about enumerating or estimating the size of the\npopulation of persons in the United States with hear-\ning loss or deafness. Ostensibly, one would simply use\nsome agreed-upon measures to identify such attributes\nas the cause of and age at which individuals first ex-\nperienced hearing loss or deafness (or when and how\ntheir hearing was restored or augmented). At the def-\ninitional level, however, the demography of deafness\nbecomes problematic when it is recognized that deaf-\nness is not only an audiological condition but also\na social label. Migration is not simply a matter of mov-\ning in or out of the United States (geography) or when\na person began to lose or regain hearing (a temporal\nconcern beyond date of birth or migration); there is\nalso social mobility. Here, this does not refer to social\nclass or economic mobility, though such employment,\neducation, and earnings differences certainly do exist\nSocial mobility refers to how affiliation and group\nmembership can change, in this case, depending on\nhow individuals and those around them respond to\ntheir hearing loss. The most prominent behavioral\ndistinction affecting which social label is applied to\npersons experiencing deafness is the use of a signed\nversus a spoken language across a variety of social\nsettings (Mitchell & Karchmer, 2004). Those who\nidentify and organize as a formal or informal associa-\ntion of the Deaf emphasize the centrality of signing,\nwhereas those who take the label Hard of Hearing\nfocus on speech. Differing perspectives on how a\nperson's deafness is defined affect who is labeled\ndeaf, hard of hearing, or as a person with hearing loss\nand, therefore, who is counted as among their number.\nTypical of surveys of hearing loss or deafness,\nwhen attempting to distinguish among those who are\nhearing, hard of hearing, or deaf, the SIPP asks how\nwell a person can hear human speech (see, e.g., Schein,\n1989) or, more precisely, ``normal conversation.'' The\nSIPP asks each individual (age 15 or older) or infor-\nmant (responding for children aged 6 to 14 years, as\nwell as some older persons) to respond to the following\ntwo questions (U.S. Census Bureau, 2001a, Questions\n\u00b7 ``Do you [Does the child] have difficulty hearing\nwhat is said in a normal conversation with another\nperson even when wearing your [his/her] hearing\naid?'' [Note: the respondent is not forced to answer\nyes or no; the individual may indicate ``Person is deaf''\nin lieu of providing a yes or no response.]\n\u00b7 An affirmative response is followed by ``Are\nyou [Is the child] able to hear what is said in normal\nconversation at all?''\nThese are fundamentally social questions; they pertain\nto interactions between a person speaking and the\nperson (who may be experiencing hearing loss or deaf-\nness) being spoken to. Given that the idea of normal\nconversation is commonly shared, it is this manner of\nsocial interaction that defines hearing loss or deafness.\nIt is important to note that the SIPP defines hearing\nloss and deafness in relation to an individual's difficulty\nhearing normal conversation with the use of a hearing\naid (if worn); from a less conversationally functional\nand more audiological perspective, some respondents\nmay have a hearing loss that is not going to be apparent\nusing the two questions above. Further consideration\nneeds to be given to whether the person uses a hearing\nU.S. Census Bureau, 2001b, Question CDQ7c). A per-\nson who reports no difficulty hearing normal conver-\nsation when wearing her/his hearing aid, nonetheless,\ndoes have a hearing loss. This creates a special sub-\ngroup among those with hearing loss or deafness re-\nsponding to the SIPP: persons who have no difficulty\nhearing normal conversation and use a hearing aid\n(i.e., ``No'' response to Questions ADQ6 or CDQ11,\nbut ``Yes'' response to Questions ADQ2c or CDQ7c).\nAs noted, the SIPP allows individuals to select the\nlabel ``deaf'' in lieu of indicating the degree of diffi-\nculty hearing normal conversation. This alternative\nresponse exists because people who are born deaf or\nwho experience hearing loss before acquiring spoken\nlanguage often do not identify themselves as having\ndifficultly with normal conversation; they identify\nthemselves as deaf (Hale, 2001). These respondents\nunderstand that the standard referent is to normal\nconversation, which implies that any alternative man-\nner of conversation or social intercourse to which one\nmay have ready access is not normal and does not\ncount; being deaf does count.\nAnother social basis for defining deafness, intro-\nduced above, is the use of speech versus sign language,\nparticularly a preference for the use of one over the\nother. Largely dependent on both the degree and tim-\ning of hearing loss, those who are hard of hearing are\ndistinguished from those who are deaf by their ability\nand preference for the use of spoken language when\ncommunicating with others. Clearly, there is more\nroom for social mobility by this definition because\nlanguage and communication skills and preferences\ncan change over time, affecting how a person with\nhearing loss or deafness creates a self-presentation\nand how that presentation is perceived by others.\nHowever, the SIPP does not inquire about preferences\nfor the use of speech or sign language, though it does\nrequest information about the intelligibility of the\nindividual's speech (e.g., U.S. Census Bureau, 2001a,\nQuestion ADQ8: ``Do you have difficulty having your\nspeech understood?'').\nAs becomes evident in the presentation of findings\n(see the Findings From the SIPP section), five cate-\ngories of persons can be derived from the difficulty-\nhearing-normal-conversation and hearing-aid-use\nquestions, ranging from no difficulty to deaf, but the\ndistinctions are too fine given the limited sample size\nof the SIPP. Discussions about the demography of\ndeafness from the SIPP need to be limited to three\ngroups of persons: hearing, hard of hearing, and func-\ntionally deaf. Persons who are considered hearing are\nthose with no difficulty hearing normal conversation\nand who do not use a hearing aid. Persons who are\nhard of hearing are those who either have no difficulty\nhearing normal conversation but do wear a hearing aid\nor have some difficulty hearing normal conversation\n(regardless of hearing aid use). Persons who are func-\ntionally deaf are those who indicated they are either\ndeaf or unable to hear normal conversation at all (even\nwhen using a hearing aid). The SIPP includes too few\nrespondents in some or all age groups for those iden-\ntified as deaf or as having no difficulty hearing normal\nconversation when wearing a hearing aid, which means\nthat reliable estimates cannot be obtained at this level\nof detail. Consequently, grouping respondents as hear-\ning, hard of hearing, or functionally deaf is the best\nthat the SIPP has to offer.\nIt turns out that the SIPP does not collect some\ndata highly relevant to the experience of deafness. In\nparticular, the timing of hearing loss, called the age at\nonset (see, e.g., Schein, 1989), is not recorded. Instead,\nand only for adults, hearing loss or deafness has to be\nconsidered the ``main reason for [the individual's]\ndifficulties'' before the year (and month) of onset is\nrequested. If hearing loss or deafness is not considered\nthe cause of any difficulties with identified activities or\ndiminished sense of personal health, then no onset\ndate is requested. Further, only the main reason is\nassociated with a date, so persons with hearing loss\nor deafness who perceive some other condition as their\nmain reason for difficulties or fair or poor health would\nstill not have an opportunity to report their age at\nonset. There are no explicit requests for retrospective\naccounts of the age at onset of hearing loss or deafness\nindependent of other conditions or perceptions.\nConduct and Design of the SIPP\nThe U.S. Census Bureau employs a multistage, strat-\nified, cluster sampling design to annually conduct the\nmultiwave panel, national household survey known as\nthe SIPP (see Westat, 2001, for details). That is, the\nwell-funded and extensively staffed SIPP utilizes\na complex sample design to follow a large group of\npeople (panel) over a few years, with data collection\noccurring at regular intervals (waves) during that time\nperiod. However, for any given panel, questions about\ndisability typically are asked during two waves only,\nbut neither the initial nor the final waves. This means\nthat the SIPP does not collect data on hearing loss\nand deafness annually but does have two time points\nseparated by about 1 year. It should be noted that the\nconsistency of responses to inquiries about hearing\ndifficulty across the two time points for the 1993 panel\nwas not high (McNeil, 2000), which, at a minimum,\nraises concern about data reliability for longitudinal\nstudies of hearing loss or deafness using the SIPP.\nFor the panel starting in 2001, the design includes\ndisability questions for two waves: Wave 5 and Wave 8.\nFor the cross-sectional analysis of available data, here,\nducted from June through September of 2002.\ncluded 29,532 sample units (households) with a total\never, 3.4% of the eligible persons were not inter-\nviewed. Thirty percent of the interviews for persons\naged 15 years or older were with proxies rather than\ndirectly with the individual for whom data was recorded;\nall data for children under age 15 were obtained\nthrough proxy interviews.\nPerson-level weights are assigned to each respon-\ndent. These weights are multipliers that increase or\ndecrease the contribution of each individual's re-\nsponses in proportion to their expected prevalence\nbased on the sample design so that nationally repre-\nsentative estimates for the civilian noninstitutionalized\nresident population can be obtained (i.e., does not\ninclude persons who are incarcerated, institutionalized,\non military bases, or outside of the United States).\nDesign-effect adjustments for the calculation of stan-\ndard errors are provided by the U.S. Census Bureau\n(Tupek, 2004) in a publicly available ``Source and\nAccuracy Statement'' on the World Wide Web. The\ndesign-effect adjustments are necessary because the\ncomplex sample design employed by the SIPP in-\ncreases the measurement error associated with each\nestimate when compared to the errors that would be\ncalculated if respondents had been sampled randomly\nwithout regard to population clustering or assuring\nthat persons from all significant social strata were in-\ncluded. As conventional for population estimates, 90%\nstandard error) to highlight just how far away point\nestimates based upon the SIPP sample may be from\nthe true numbers of persons in the population.\nFindings From the SIPP\nAccording to the estimates in Table 1, about\nUnited States over 5 years of age are deaf or hard of\nHowever, if estimates are restricted to those who have\nat least some difficulty hearing normal conversation,\nclassified as deaf or hard of hearing (3.7% of the pop-\nto hear normal conversation at all, even when using\na hearing aid--(0.38% of the population, or fewer\n64,889) people in the United States were identified as\n``deaf'' (0.07% of the population, or less than 1 per\n1,000). That is, this last category of children and\nadults did not identify with questions about difficulty\nhearing normal conversation as an appropriate way to\ncharacterize their hearing loss. (Note that these deaf\nindividuals are unlikely to actively identify with clas-\nsification schemes based upon pure tone threshold\naudiometry, which often have labels describing hearing\nloss as ranging from slight to profound and typically\nmake reference to a better-or worse-ear average across\nseveral frequencies.) However, there is little reason to\nhave confidence in the estimates from the ``deaf'' cat-\nage for whom survey responses were obtained (or\ncould be imputed) were identified as deaf. This means\nthat the standard errors on the estimates for this\ncategory are very large, particularly when broken down\nby age group. The 90% confidence interval for deaf\n65 years and older. These estimates are not highly\nreliable; the standard errors range in magnitude from\n36% of the estimate (all ages) to 148% of the estimate\n(seniors)! Of particular note is the negative lower\nbound for seniors, which is due to difficulty estimating\nstandard errors for groups with almost no represen-\ntation (i.e., three respondents); that is, the estimate\nis so unreliable that the statistical error at the 90%\nconfidence level is larger than the estimate itself. With\nrespect to the disproportionality across age groups,\nthis is most likely due to wide, but reasonable, sam-\npling variability rather than being representative of the\ndistribution of deaf persons by age in the population.\nGiven the low reliability of the estimates for per-\nsons who were identified as deaf, further discussions\nabout deafness are limited to findings for the number\nof persons who are functionally deaf (i.e., combining\ndeaf with those unable to hear normal conversation at\nall, even with a hearing aid). The number of respond-\nents identified as functionally deaf is large enough to\nprovide fairly reliable estimates. Similarly, the discus-\nsion of lesser degrees of hearing loss is limited to\nfindings for the number of persons who are hard of\nhearing (i.e., some difficulty hearing normal conversa-\ntion or no difficulty hearing normal conversation, but\nuses a hearing aid). Among hard-of-hearing persons,\nseniors; among functionally deaf persons, there are an\nA bar graph displaying the percentages of persons\nwho are hard of hearing and who are functionally\ndeaf, by age group, is shown in Figure 1 (percentage\nTable 1 Number of persons by level of difficulty hearing normal conversation and age group, United States, 2002\nHas difficulty hearing normal\nconversation (with hearing aid, if used)\nAge (years)\nTotal\nNote.

Except for the group of functionally deaf\nchildren, where the size of the standard error is 80%\nof the estimate itself (only 10 respondents were iden-\ntified), the standard error of the estimate for each age\ngroup of functionally deaf persons is less than one\nthird of the value of the estimate itself. Although the\nmagnitudes of the standard errors are large enough to\nleave appreciable room for uncertainty about the true\npopulation size, they remain small enough to be con-\nfident that, with the exception of functionally deaf\nchildren, the point estimates are of the right order of\nmagnitude.\nFor over a century now, various U.S. census and\nsurvey efforts have identified substantial age variation\nin the population of persons with hearing loss or deaf-\n1974). The findings presented here, based on analysis\nof the recent SIPP, confirm this pattern of age varia-\ntion (see Figure 1). The absence of age at onset data,\nhowever, does not prevent making inferences about the\ntime-dependent nature of hearing loss or deafness.\nThe dramatic growth in prevalence with increasing\nage, even with increasing life spans (see, e.g., Arias,\n2002) and possible cohort effects (e.g., the maternal\nbirth cohorts; see, e.g., Brown, 1986; Preblud,\nHinman, & Herrmann, 1980), could only occur if an\nincreasing number of people are becoming hard of\nhearing or functionally deaf over their lifetimes. In\nother words, there is no way that these numbers would\noccur solely due to people being born into the popu-\nlation with hearing loss. Further, despite relatively\nhigh rates of immigration into the United States since\nevidence that geographical migration could possibly\naccount for the more than 20-fold increase in prevalence\nof hearing loss and deafness between childhood (ages\nThe SIPP Answer to ``How Many Deaf?''\nThe SIPP provides fairly tight estimates for the num-\nber of functionally deaf persons for most age groups\nexcept children (ages 6\u00ad17) but does not do so for any\nage group of persons identified as ``deaf.'' Sampling\nrare populations is very difficult to do. Obtaining\nhighly reliable estimates for the rarest of persons with\ndeafness, namely children and those who identify as\n``deaf,'' requires a different methodology than that\nemployed by the SIPP, one that raises the probability\nof sampling the rare population (see, e.g., Kalton &\nthe estimates obtained from the SIPP are reasonable\ngiven previous research (e.g., National Academy on an\nSchein & Delk, 1974), so long as the exact nature of\nthe questions asked is kept in mind.\nIn sum, as far as it relates to difficulty hearing\nnormal conversation, estimates from the SIPP indicate\nthat fewer than 1 in 20 Americans are currently deaf or\nfunctionally deaf.
