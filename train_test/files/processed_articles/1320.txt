It\nassumes that the aggregate measure is computed from similar matrices of discrete\ndemographic data for two populations under comparison. The algorithm estimates the\neffects of replacement for each elementary cell of one matrix by respective cell of\nanother matrix. Application of the algorithm easily leads to the known formula for the\nage-decomposition of differences between two life expectancies. It also allows to\ndevelop new formulae for differences between healthy life expectancies. In the latter\ncase, each age-component is split further into effects of mortality and effects of health.\nThe application of the algorithm enables a numerical decomposition of the differences\nbetween total fertility rates and between parity progression ratios by age of the mother\nand parity. Empirical examples are based on mortality data from the USA, the UK,\nWest Germany, and Poland and on fertility data from Russia.\n1 Institute for Prognosis of the National Economy, Centre of Demography and Human Ecology,\n2 Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, Doberaner Str. 114, D-18057 Rostock, Germany.\nE-mail: shkolnikov@demogr.mpg.de\nE-mail: begun@unibw-hamburg.de\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 7, Article 14\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org\n1.

Andreev1\nVladimir M. Shkolnikov2\nAlexander Z. Begun3\n Introduction\nIn the 1980s, interest in decomposition appeared in relation to the particular problem of\nthe decomposition of differences between two life expectancies. Nowadays, researchers\nare trying to develop general approaches which would solve the decomposition problem\nfor wider classes of demographic measures (Das Gupta, 1994, Das Gupta, 1999, Vaupel\ncontributes to this line of research.\nA variety of aggregate measures can be computed from demographic tables. Each\nof them aggregates a vector or a matrix of elementary rates of demographic events into\none number. When analyzing changes in an aggregate demographic measure in time or\nits variations across countries, it is useful to be able to decompose observed changes or\ndifferences by age and other demographic dimensions such as birth order, cause of\ndeath, or population group. Decomposition aims at estimating contributions of\ndifferences between elementary rates of demographic events to the overall difference\nbetween two values of the aggregate measure.\nThis task is easier when analyzing for differences between two linear aggregates of\nelementary rates like two age-standardized rates or two total fertility rates. However,\nsome of the aggregate measures are linked to elementary rates in a complex way. For\nexample, life expectancy at birth is a functional of the vector of age-specific death rates,\nwhich has to be computed by complex acccumulation of these rates by means of the life\ntable. The conventional TFR is simply the sum of age-specific fertility rates. However,\nTFR computed from age- and parity-specific fertility rates (denoted hereafter as\nTFR_P) is a complex measure, which has to be computed by means of the parity\nprogression table.\nA discrete method for decomposition of a difference between two life expectancies\nwas independently developed in the 1980s by three different researchers from Russia,\ndecomposition by Andreev and Pressat are exactly equivalent. Arriaga's formula is\nwritten in a slightly different form, but it is essentially equivalent to the formulae by\nAndreev and Pressat (Shkolnikov et al., 2001). A continuous version of the method for\ndecomposition of differences between life expectancies by age was developed by\nIt appears that existing formulae for age-decomposition of the difference between\nlife expectancies are just particular forms of a general algorithm, which includes the\nstepwise replacement of elements from one vector of age-specific mortality rates by\nrespective elements of another vector (Shkolnikov, Andreev and Begun, 2001). In a\nmore general case, elements of one multidimensional matrix should be replaced by\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 7, Article 14\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 501\n)\nM\ne\ne <\nrespective elements of another matrix. This approach has its roots in the general idea of\nThe first section of the present paper is devoted to the decomposition of\ndifferences between life expectancies and between healthy life expectancies. First, we\nshow how the conventional formula for decomposition of differences between life\nexpectancies derives from the general replacement algorithm. Second, the same\napproach is applied to the age-decomposition of differences between health\nexpectancies. These measures combine data on mortality with data on health. Each\nmeasure is calculated from two independent vectors, that is, of age-specific mortality\nrates and of the age-specific prevalences of \"good\" health. Correspondingly, each\nelementary age-component of the difference between two health expectancies is to be\nsplit further into the effects of mortality and of health.\nThe second section deals with two aggregate measures of fertility based on the\nparity-progression table, namely parity-progression ratios and the total fertility rate.\nBoth indicators are based on the matrix of elementary fertility rates by age of the\nmother and parity. We show that the results of an exact decomposition according to the\nalgorithm of stepwise replacement differ from those returned by simpler methods.\nIn sections 1 we solve the decomposition problems by developing formulae for the\ncomponents. In section 2 we describe a procedure for their numerical estimation.\n2. Decomposition of differences between two life expectancies\nand between two healthy life expectancies\nLife expectancies\nConsider two life expectancies at birth and computed\nin a conventional way from two vectors of age-specific mortality rates\nx\nm\nx\nm\nM < , x=0, 1, 2, ...  . Transition from life expectancy 1\ne to\nlife expectancy 2\ne corresponds to a transformation of vector 1\nM into vector 2\nM .\nSuch a transformation can be completed by a stepwise replacement in an age-by-age\nmode of the elements of the first vector by respective elements of the second vector.\nLet ]\n[x\nM be the vector, consisting of elementary mortality rates 2\nm at ages\nx\nm at ages x\ny  (Note 1). The difference 1\n]\n[\n|\n)\n( e\nM\ne x\nx\n,\n<\n,\n is a\ncontribution of ages from x\ny ; to the overall difference 1\ne\ne , .

That is to say\nthat the decomposition of differences between life expectancies depends on the\npermutation of vectors under\nfeature. They suggested averaging as a way to obtain symmetrical components i.e.\n)\n(\n, ,\n\n<\nx\nx\nx\n\n\n .\nThe latter expression exactly replicates the formulae by E. Andreev (1982) and R.\nNumerous empirical examples of decompositions of differences between life\nexpectancies can be found elsewhere (Shkolnikov et al., 2001).\nReplacement running from young to old ages looks natural and meaningful.\nNevertheless, it is not obvious why the replacement algorithm goes this way. Generally\nspeaking, it could be organized differently. For example, it could run from old to young\nages (Pollard, 1988) or in a random manner.\nThe most general procedure for the replacement of one element should include\n\nreplacements. For every age x the replacement should be performed with all\npossible combinations of 1\ny\nz\nM , at ages y and z other than age x. The final\ncontribution of age x should be calculated as the average of 1\n\ncomponents.\nThis procedure is extremely laborious given high numbers of age groups (about 20\nfor abridged life tables and about 100 for complete ones). Several numerical\nexperiments (not shown here) suggest that results of \"complete\" decomposition of\ndifferences between life expectancies are close to the results returned by formula (3).\nSo, there are reasons to avoid laborious calculations if we agree to follow the existing\ntradition of making replacements in ascending order of ages. It guarantees consistency\nregarding the existing formulae for the decomposition of differences between life\nexpectancies by age and, as we show below, allows to develop similar decomposition\nformulae for the age-decomposition for other aggregate measures such as Gini\ncoefficients or healthy life expectancies.\n\n\n<\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n\n<\n<\n,\n\n\n\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\n)]}\n(\n)\n(\n[\n)]\n(\n)\n(\n{[\ne\ne\nl\ne\ne\nl\ne\ne\nl\ne\ne\nl\ne\ne\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 7, Article 14\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org\nHealth expectancies\nHealth expectancy indicators can be built in several ways (Cambois, Robine and\nBrouard, 1999, Robine, Romieu and Cambois, 1999). So far, the \"observed prevalence\nlife table method\" by D.Sullivan (1964) is the most widely used method. According to\nthis method, health expectancy is defined as\nx\nx\nx\nL\nh \n\n\n< \nwhere\nx\n is the share of person-years lived in \"good\" health within the elementary age\ninterval [x, x+1). Usually the health-weights\nx\n are obtained from nationally\nrepresentative surveys including questions on self-perceived health, self-perceived\ndisability, ill-health or physical performance scales (Wilkins and Adams, 1983, Robine,\nAccording to (4), two vectors are needed for calculating the health expectancy.\nThese are the vector of age-specific mortality rates M and the vector of age-specific\nhealth-weights  . Correspondingly, decomposition of the difference between two\nhealth expectancies should include additional splitting of each age-component into\neffects of mortality and health.\nAccording to the algorithm of stepwise replacement, the component of the overall\ndifference in\nh due to the difference between mortality rates at age x is\n)]}\n,\n(\n)\n,\n(\n[(\n)]\n,\n(\n)\n,\n(\n{[(\n[\n]\n[\n]\n[\n]\n[\n]\n[\n]\n[\n]\n[\n]\n[\n\n\n\n, \n,\n\n\n\n,\n\n< x\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nM\nh\nM\nh\nM\nh\nM\nh\nThe component of the overall difference in\nh due to the difference in health-weights\nat age x is\n)]}\n,\n(\n)\n,\n(\n[\n)]\n,\n(\n)\n,\n(\n{[\n[\n]\n[\n]\n[\n]\n[\n]\n[\n]\n[\n]\n[\n]\n[\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nM\nh\nM\nh\nM\nh\nM\nh \n,\n\n\n\n,\n\n< \n\n\n\n,\nExpressions (5) and (6) allow to estimate components 1\nx\nx\n numerically.

For each\nfive-year age group weights\nx\n are the sums of the original proportions of women with\n\"fair\", \"good\" and \"very good\" self-perceived health. For both countries the mortality\nrates for the year 1995 are used. From these data health expectancies at age 20 are\ncomputed for West Germany and Poland and their difference is decomposed by age\naccording to (8) and (9).\nFigure 1 suggests that contributions due to differences in self-perceived health are\nmuch greater than those due to differences in mortality. Indeed, 7.2 years of the overall\ndifference of 8.9 years are attributable to differences in health. Although the maximum\nage-specific contributions are produced for ages from 65 to 75, they are very significant\nas early as at the age of 50.\nIt is worth understanding that the mortality age-components of the difference\nbetween health expectancies\nx\n are different from age-components\nx\n of the\ndifference between respective life expectancies if for some ages x 1\n\u00f7\nx\n . Indeed, in\nthe example given above, female life expectancies at age 20 in West Germany and\nPoland were 61 and 58 years, respectively. The difference of 3 years is significantly\nhigher than the total effect of mortality in the West Germany-Poland difference between\nhealth expectancies, which is equal to 1.7 years.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 7, Article 14\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 507\nFigure 1: Decomposition of the difference between female health expectancies at\n3.

The TFR_P based on\nage-parity-specific fertility rates is adjusted both for age and parity. This type of period\nfertility measure is valuable for analytical purposes (Kohler and Ortega, 2002,\nLet us consider an example of changes in Russian fertility in the first half of the\nTable 1 shows also that in these years the difference between the TFR and the TFR_P in\nRussia increased.\nTable 1: Total fertility rates computed without and with data on parity in Russia\nThe parity-progression table is a type of a multi-status demographic table based on the\nmatrix par\nx\nf\nF\n,\n< , in which each elementary fertility rate par\nx\nf\n,\nis a ratio of the\nnumber of par-order births to the mid-year population of women aged x with par-1\nchildren. In matrix F, ages are presented as rows and birth orders are presented as\ncolumns. Age runs across the interval of reproductive ages  \n\n, , while parity varies\nfrom 0 to the highest birth order p.\nThe parity-progression table can be computed from matrix F (Whelpton, 1946,\nOrtega, 2002). The computational procedure, used in the present study, is given in the\nAppendix.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 7, Article 14\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 509\nThe total parity-specific birth numbers are defined as <\n<\nl\nB\n\nand \n<\n<\n\n\nx\npar\nx\npar\nb\nB\n,\nfor par>0, where par\nx\nb\n,\nare age-parity-specific birth numbers\nfrom the parity-progression table.\nTwo aggregate fertility measures, which will be used for our next decomposition\nexercises, are the\nparity-progression ratio\npar\npar\npar\nB\nB\na /\n\nand the total fertility rate\n)\n....\n....\n(\n_\n<\n\n\n\n\n<\n\n<  p\np\npar\npar\na\na\na\na\na\na\na\nB\nB\nB\nP\nFormulae (10), (11) and Appendix define apar\nand TFR_P as functionals of the matrix of\nelementary fertility rates F.\nAt first glance, (10) and (11) suggests that the decompositions of difference\nbetween values of TFR_P in respect to age x or parity par can be accomplished in a\nsimple way from \n,\nx\nb values and par\na values, respectively. N.Barkalov (1999)\ndeveloped a formula for the components of differences between two TFR_P values.\nThis formula corresponds to the stepwise replacement of 1\npar\npar\nfrom lower to higher parities, although the way of its development by the author was\ndifferent. It appears, however, that par\na depends not only on 1\n, \npar\nx\nf , but also on\nfertility rates of lower parities k\nx\nf\n,\n(k<par+1). We will show later that numerical\nresults of this method of decomposition are somewhat different from the exact results of\nthe general replacement algorithm.\nThe general replacement algorithm for decomposition of differences between\npar\na values or TFR_P values includes replacements of all elementary fertility rates in\nF by respective elements of matrix 2\nF and vice versa. The external cycle of\nreplacement runs across ages, while the internal cycle runs across parities. As in the\nprevious section, the replacement runs in ascending order by age. It means that the\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 7, Article 14\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org\nreplacement of the elements of row x 1\n, par\nx\nf by elements 2\n, par\nx\nf begins only after all\nelements 1\n, par\ny\nf are already replaced by the elements 2\n, par\ny\nf for rows y<x. Certainly,\nthe replacement could be organized differently with parity being the \"first\" dimension\nand age being the \"second\" one (see section 3).\nThe effect of replacement of a given element 1\n, par\nx\n, par\nx\nf on par\na and on\nTFR_P should be calculated 2par-1 times according to the number of different\ncombinations of 1\n,k\nx\n,l\nx\nf in remaining cells of the same row x ( p\nl\np\nk ;\n; , and\npar\nl\nk \u00f7\n\u00f7 ). Finally, the component produced by age x and parity par in replacement\n12 is the average of all 2par-1 effects.\nAs in section 1, in order to obtain symmetrical components the whole set of\nreplacements should be completed twice in two directions (12 and 21).\nLet us consider another example. Data from the Russian census of 1989 and the\nmicro-census of 1994 allow us to estimate the composition of female population by age\nand parity. These data combined with annual statistics on births by parity and age of the\nmother allow us to calculate fertility rates by parity (1, 2, ..., 5+) and age of the mother\nfertility rates 1\nF . Values of the parity progression ratios, computed from the\nmatrices of 1989 and 1994, show a structure of the rapid drop in Russian fertility\nTable 2: Changes in parity progression ratios and in total fertility rate between\n,\npar\na and\n,\npar\nReplacement of a single element of matrix 1\nF by the respective element of matrix 2\nF\n(or vice versa) includes 16 (24) calculations of changes in par\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 7, Article 14\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 511\nTFR_P. For example, replacement of the upper-left element 1\n,\nf , corresponding to\n,\nf includes replacements of this element in all\npossible combinations with rates 1\n,\n,\nf in the remaining 4 cells of the same\nrow with l\nk \u00f7 and \nl\nchanges in the output measures ( par\na and TFR_P) produced by the replacements.\nFinally, the averages of these 16 values should be computed for each par\na and TFR_P.\nTables 3a, 3b, and 3c show age- and parity-specific contributions to the overall\nchanges in\n,a\na and\nprogressions to a given parity par are mostly due to decreases in fertility rates for the\nsame parity par. However, changing fertility rates at lower parities (par-1 or even par-\n2) also produce some effects on progression to parity par. These effects are more\nsignificant for higher parities (e.g. progressions to the third and the fourth births).\nFigure 2 shows the structure by age and parity of the decrease in TFR_P in Russia\nbetween 1989 and 1994. The greatest contributions are produced by decreases in second\nbirths by mothers at ages from 23 to 29.\nTable 3a: Components of decline in progression to second births by age and parity,\nAge group\na progression to second births\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 7, Article 14\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org\nTable 3b: Components of decline in progression to third births by age and parity,\nAge group\na progression to third births\nTable 3c: Components of decline in progression to fourth births by age and parity,\nAge group\na progression to fourth births\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 7, Article 14\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 513\nAs we mentioned before, formulae (10) and (11) give the impression that\ndecompositions can be made in simpler ways. Indeed, according to (11), TFR_P is the\ntotal of all age- and parity-specific birth numbers par\nx\nb\n,\n. Thus, it seems that age-\ncomponents of the change in TFR_P could be calculated simply as\n\n\n<\n<\n\n\n,\n<\n,\np\npar\npar\nx\np\npar\npar\nx\nx\nx\nb\nb\nb\nb\n,\n,\n,\n,\n. This approach ignores the dependence of i\npar\nx\nb\n,\nvalues from fertility rates at parities lower than par. The result of such a calculation is\nsubstantially biased in comparison to the exact age-components returned by the general\nreplacement algorithm (Figure 3).\nFigure 2: Decomposition of decrease in the total fertility rate in Russia in\nContribution to the overall decrease of TRR, per 1000\n--------------------\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 7, Article 14\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org\nA comparison of the exact decomposition by the replacement algorithm\nwith a simplified decomposition according to differences in birth numbers\nfrom parity progression table.\nA simplified decomposition of a difference between TFR_P values in respect to parity\ncan be accomplished in two different ways.

Final considerations\nThe algorithm of stepwise replacement is a universal tool for the decomposition of\ndifferences between aggregate measures computed from demographic tables. The\nnumber of examples in the present study could be increased. In particular, in an earlier\nstudy (Shkolnikov, Andreev and Begun, 2001) we developed a new formulae for the\nage-decomposition of differences between two Gini coefficients (measures of\nvariability in age at death). In this study we showed also how to decompose the age-\ncomponents further in respect to age and population composition by social group. Such\ndecomposition can be accomplished by means of the same general algorithm including\nreplacement of age-group-specific death rates and of age-specific population weights of\ngroups.\nWe would like to add two additional comments regarding two peculiar aspects of\nthe decomposition which were not addressed in sections 1 and 2, but should be kept in\nmind when making decompositions and interpreting their results.\nPath dependence. In the present paper, we always assume that population \"jumps\"\nfrom state 1 to state 2 with no intermediate states in between. However, results of the\ndecomposition could depend on a particular pathway of transition from state 1 to state\n2. For example, the age-parity components of change in the Russian TFR_P from 1989\nto 1994 are somewhat different from the sums of age-parity components of subsequent\nThe best way to address this problem is to make all annual transitions and then to\nsum them up. However, this solution is not really popular among researchers because\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 7, Article 14\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org\ndifferences between a direct transition (as 19891994) and the sequence of annual\ntransitions are usually small. However, there is no guarantee that such differences\nwould be small in all cases.\nAge as a special dimension. In the present paper we treated age as a special\ndimension in two respects. First, replacement ran from younger to older ages in order to\nkeep a consistency with earlier formulae by Andreev (1982), Arriaga (1984) and Pressat\n(1985). This approach gives also an opportunity for developing new formulae for other\naggregate measures. Second, we were interested in splitting further each age-component\naccording to additional dimensions (effects of mortality and health or effects of parities\nwithin each age group). This means that age always played the role of the first\ndimension. The formulae developed in sections 1 and 2 correspond to this particular\napproach.\nDependence on the sequence of replacement. The order of dimensions in the\ncourse of replacement could also matter for results. For example, there are two ways to\nreplace the age-group-specific mortality rates and age-specific population-weights of\ngroups when decomposing a difference between two life expectancies from data on\nmortality by age and population group. One can make a replacement of age-specific\nmortality rates within each population group or to replace group-specific mortality rates\nwithin one age group. Generally speaking, all replacement schemes are equally\nacceptable. Ideally, the final components should be based on the averaging of effects\ngeneral principle works well for linear aggregates, but could lead to long computational\ntimes for more complex measures, especially if the number of dimensions and the\nnumber of categories within each dimension is large.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 7, Article 14\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 517\nNotes\n1. For the sake of simplicity, notation in all formulae of this paper are given for\ncomplete demographic tables (tables with single-year age groups). All of them can\nbe easily re-written for abridged demographic tables.\nCorrections:\nDemographic Research \u00ad Volume 7, Article 14\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org\nReferences\nAndreev, E.M.
