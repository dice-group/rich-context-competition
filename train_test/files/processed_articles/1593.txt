Multiple instruments to operationalize a defini-\ntion of frailty have been developed and validated [1].\nOne such index, proposed by Fried and colleagues,\ndefines frailty as the presence of three or more of five\ncriteria: unintentional weight loss, exhaustion,\nweakness,slowwalkingspeedandlowphysicalactiv-\nity [4]. Using the Fried criteria, estimates of the preva-\nlence of frailty amongst independently living adults\npersons older than 80 years; prevalence estimates\nare higher amongst persons with diabetes and other\nchronic debilitating diseases [2\u00ad4, 6]. Frailty, using\nthis definition, is associated with increased risk\nof falls, hospitalization, disability and death [4].\nHowever, diagnosing frailty in the clinical setting can\nbe cumbersome because most indices of frailty re-\nquire a combination of anthropometry and physical\nfunctiontesting.\nSerum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D are\nknown to decline with age. Moreover, rates of 25-\nhydoxyvitamin D deficiency are higher amongst\ngroups that are at high risk for poor physical func-\ntioning: older individuals, women and non-whites\n[7\u00ad9]. Our prior work has described higher rates of\nfrailty amongst non-whites and women [10]. 25-hy-\ndroxyvitamin D deficiency is also associated with\ndebilitating chronic diseases, such as hypertension,\nchronic kidney disease, insulin resistance and diabe-\ntes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease, as well as\nother age-related conditions that may influence\nphysical functioning, such as macular degeneration\nOriginal Article |\nA small number of studies have previously evaluated\nthe relation between low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D\nand frailty, but these studies have been in disease-\nlimited patient populations or have employed\nnonstandard definitions of frailty [20\u00ad22]. We\nhypothesized that 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency\nwould be associated with frailty in older adults, inde-\npendent of the associations seen amongst frailty,\nadvanced age and chronic medical conditions, and\nthat the association between frailty and 25-hydroxy-\nvitaminD woulddifferbyrace.\nMethods\nDatasource\nWe obtained individual level data from the Third Na-\ntional Health and Nutrition Evaluation Survey\n(NHANES III), a nationally representative survey of\nthe health status of persons residing in the United\nNHANES III is a cross-sectional, multistage, strati-\nfied, clustered probability sample of the US civilian\nnoninstitutionalized population conducted by the\nNational Center for Health Statistics, a branch of the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\n[23]. The purpose of NHANES is to determine the\nprevalence of major diseases and potential risk fac-\ntors for diseases in the general US population.\nNHANES conducts both interviews and physical\nexaminations. The interview includes demographic,\nsocioeconomic, dietary andhealth-related questions.\nThe examination is conducted at a mobile evaluation\ncenter (MEC) or the participant's home and consists\nof medical, dental, and physiological measurements,\nas well as laboratory tests administered by highly\ntrained medical personnel.

We excluded persons for\nwhom sufficient data to assess frailty (described be-\nlow) were unavailable (n = 7). Persons who chose to\nbe examined in their homes rather than in an MEC\nwere eligible for phlebotomy including an assay for\nserum 25-hydroxyvitamin D. A large fraction of home\nexamined persons (66%) were missing 25-hydroxyvi-\ntamin D data; thus, we excluded home examined\npersons from our primary analysis. Home examined\nparticipants (n = 422) were more likely to be older\n(mean age 77.8 years) and non-Hispanic white and\nmore likely to have multiple comorbidities than those\nexamined in an MEC.

Survey participants\nliving in southern states were sampled throughout\nthe year with the majority of sampling occurring be-\ntweenOctoberandApril[23].\nWe used conventional definitions of 25-hydroxyvita-\nmin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D con-\ninsufficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concen-\nOtherexplanatoryvariables\nWe ascertained participant race based on self-report\nand classified participants as `white' or `non-white'\n(includes participants of black and all other races).\nWe estimated socioeconomic status (SES) using the\npoverty income ratio (PIR) which is based on income\nthresholds from the US Census Bureau that vary by\nfamily size and composition. We considered partici-\npants with PIR values <2.00 to be of low SES; we con-\nsidered participants with PIR values 2.00 to be of\nhighSES.\nWe considered participants to have diabetes if a phy-\nsician had informed them that they had diabetes or if\nthey recorded a haemoglobin A1c 6%.

We defined chronic kidney disease as\neither prevalent micro- or macro-albuminuria (de-\nfined as a single urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio\n30 mg g)1) in the presence of a normal estimated\nglomerular filtration rate (eGFR, calculated using the\nMayo quadratic equation) or an eGFR <60 mL min)1\nhave peripheral arterial disease if they reported activ-\nity-related calf pain that was relieved with rest. Simi-\nlarly, we considered participants to have coronary\nartery disease if they reported activity-related chest\npain that was relieved with rest, or if they reported a\nprior myocardial infarction. We identified partici-\npants with arthritis, cancer, chronic lung disease,\ncongestive heart failure or history of stroke based on\nself-reported physician diagnosis. We considered the\npresence of one or more of peripheral arterial disease,\ncoronary artery disease, heart failure or stroke as\n`overt cardiovascular disease.' Blood pressure was\nmeasured according to a protocol described else-\nwhere; hypertension was defined according to the\nSeventh Report of the Joint National Committee on\nPrevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of\nStatisticalanalysis\nWe conducted data analysis with sas, version 9.1.3\n(SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA), accounting for\noversampling, stratification and clustering [28].\nBecauseserum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations\ndiffer widely by race, we conducted race stratified\nanalyses (white and non-white) for frailty. We con-\ntrolledfordemographicfactors (age, sex, and poverty,\nas described above) as well as seven comorbidities\n(diabetes, history ofnondermatologic cancer, chronic\nlung disease, chronic liver disease, chronic kidney\ndisease, overt cardiovascular disease and arthritis);\nonly chronic lung disease was not significantly asso-\nciated with frailty and was removed from our model.\nFor the discrete frailty outcome, we performed multi-\nvariable logistic regression adjusting for sociodemo-\ngraphic factors and comorbid conditions that were\nassociated with frailty at P < 0.20 in bivariate analy-\nses. In logistic regression models, we assessed\ndiscrimination using the area under the receiver\noperating characteristic (ROC) curve and we as-\nsessed calibration using the Hosmer\u00adLemeshow\ngoodness-of-fit test. The Hosmer\u00adLemeshow test\nE. R. Wilhelm-Leen et al.\n| Vitamin D deficiency and frailty\ncompares model performance (observed versus\nexpected) across deciles of risk, to test whether the\nmodel is biased (i.e., performs differentially at the\nextremes of risk). A nonsignificant value for the Hos-\nmer\u00adLemeshowv2 suggestsanabsenceofsuchbias.\nBecause serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentra-\ntions vary by season of the year and by latitude,\npersons may be misclassified with vitamin D defi-\nciency or insufficiency depending on the time of\nyear that measurements were made. Further com-\nplicating matters, the NHANES strategy of sampling\npersons living in colder climates primarily in the\nsummer months and persons living in warmer cli-\nmates primarily in the winter months also raised\nconcern for misclassification bias. We addressed\nthese complexities in the following manner: for the\nprimary analysis, we excluded season and latitude.\nThis nai\n\u00a8ve and analytically conservative approach\nassumes that the measured concentration of 25-\nhydroxyvitamin D reflects the participants' time-\naveraged 25-hydroxyvitamin D exposure. However,\nparticipants measured during July in Minnesota,\nfor example, might be misclassified as having high-\ner 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations than their\ntime-averaged exposure. Therefore, we conducted\nthe following sensitivity analyses:\n1 Seasonally adjusted 25-hydroxyvitamin D: using\ndata from persons residing in states grouped into the\ncensus region of the South (Fig. 2), we created a\nregression model that allowed us to adjust for month\nof 25-hydroxyvitamin D measurement. The South\nwas chosen because it was the only census region in\nwhich data were collected year-round. We then\napplied that model to persons residing in other\nregions and created race-stratified logistic regression\nmodels, as in the primary analysis, using seasonally\nadjusted 25-hydroxyvitaminD.\n2 Latitudeadjusted25-hydroxyvitaminD:For survey\ninhabitants, the county name is available in the\nNHANES III dataset. Using data from the US Census\nBureau, we created a dichotomous latitude variable\nto sort these participants into those living at latitudes\n>40\u00b0 andthoseliving at latitudes \u00a340\u00b0 (Fig. 2). Wecre-\nated a separate logistic regression model to estimate\nthe odds of frailty associated with living in northern\nstates.\nResults\npants met inclusion criteria (Fig. 1).

Amongst non-whites, the\nodds of frailty associated with living in the northern\nlatitudes were nominally increased but not statisti-\ncally significant (P = 0.5). These results are summar-\nized inTable 4.\nDiscussion\nUsing data from a nationally representativesample of\nolder adults, we found serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D\nconcentration to be associated with frailty. Amongst\nwhites, 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency was associ-\nated with a threefold increase in the odds of frailty;\nthe odds of frailty were even higher amongst non-\nwhites with 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency. 25-hy-\ndroxyvitamin D insufficiency was also associated\nwithfrailtyamongstnon-whites.\nTwo recent studies described a high prevalence of\n25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency (and insufficiency)\nin the general population, with higher rates in older\npersons and racial and ethnic minorities [7, 8]. Other\nstudies have noted strong associations amongst\n25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency, mortality and a\nvariety of morbidities. For example, using data from\nNHANES III, Melamed and colleagues showed that\nadults with vitamin D deficiency experienced a 26%\nincreased risk in all-cause mortality over a 10-year\nfollow-up period [14]. Similarly, researchers in the\nNetherlands demonstrated an increased rate of nurs-\ning home admission in older adults with vitamin D\ndeficiency [29]. These results may be unsurprising\ngiven the well-known association between 25-\nhydroxyvitamin D deficiency and numerous chronic\ndiseases. For example, 25-hydroxyvitamin D defi-\nciency is associated increased risks of diabetes [11,\nIn addition to the association between 25-hydroxyvi-\ntamin D deficiency and chronic disease, there are\nother potential connections between 25-hydroxyvita-\nmin D status and frailty. 25-hydroxyvitamin D defi-\nciency may result in proximal muscle weakness,\nwhich could limit a person's capacity to maintain lev-\nels of physical activity and/ or performance [31, 32].\nA physiological explanation for proximal muscle\n%\nSerum vitamin D (ng mL\u00ad1)\nWhite\nNon-white\nFig. 3 Vitamin D levels for white and non-white persons,\nTable 2 Adjusted odds ratios for frailty amongst white partici-\npants aged 60 years who were mobile evaluation center\nOddsratio\ninterval\nVitaminD(ng mL)1)\nAge(years)\nSex\nMale Reference --\nPovertytoincomeratio(PIR)\nPIR2 Reference --\nComorbidity\nE. R. Wilhelm-Leen et al.\n| Vitamin D deficiency and frailty\nweakness may relate to the binding of 1,25-\ndihydroxyvitamin D,the activatedform of25-hydrox-\nyvitamin D, on nuclear receptors in skeletal muscle\ncells, resulting in increased protein synthesis and\nmuscle cell growth [33, 34]. Consistent with this\nobservation,numerousstudiesdemonstrateareduc-\ntionintheriskoffallsfollowingvitaminDsupplemen-\ntation. A recent meta-analysis, which combined\nresults from five randomized controlled trials, con-\ncluded that vitamin D supplementation may reduce\nthe risk of falls amongst older persons by 20% [35].\nEven more striking, recent results from Moreira-\nPfrimer and colleagues, demonstrate that vitamin D\nsupplementation in older adults may increased lower\nextremity strength [36].\nThe association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D and\nfrailty could reflect factors relating 25-hydroxyvita-\nmin D to health status, or could reflect `reverse\ncausality.' In other words, frail older adults may\nspend fewer hours outdoors than more physically\nable older adults, not gaining the benefits of\nconversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol (in skin) to chole-\ncalciferol by ultraviolet B radiation. Because home-\nexamined NHANES participants were excluded from\nour analysis, confounding bydifferences insun expo-\nsure may have been mitigated, albeit not eliminated\nor adequately controlled for. The fact that latitude\nwas associated with frailty after accounting for a sin-\ngle 25-hydroxyvitamin D determination suggests\nresidual confounding by sun exposure. However,\neven if the association we describe between frailty\nand 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration is mediated\nby differences in sun exposure amongst frail and\nrobust older adults, this observation does not negate\nthe possibility that vitamin D supplementation may\nprotectorrestore physicalfunctioninginfrailpeople.\nRecent reports suggest that the prevalence of 25-\nhydroxyvitamin D deficiency is increasing in the\nUS. In fact, an analysis comparing rates of 25-\nhydroxyvitamin D deficiency between NHANES\n2004 showed a clear trend towards lower serum\n25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations across all\ndemographic groups, with an especially worrisome\nincrease in the rate of 25-hydroxyvitamin D defi-\nciency amongst blacks [7]. Given our findings of a\nstrong association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D\ndeficiency and frailty, the increased prevalence of\n25-hydroxyvitamin D insufficiency and deficiency\nare particularly problematic as our population ages.\nTable3 Adjustedoddsratiosforfrailtyamongstnon-whitepar-\nticipants aged 60 years who were mobile evaluation center\nOddsratio\ninterval\nVitaminD (ng mL)1)\nAge(years)\nSex\nMale Reference --\nPovertytoincomeratio(PIR)\nPIR2 Reference --\nComorbidity\nSerum vitaminD (ng mL\u00ad1)\nMonth of the year\n1 = January\nMeasured\nPredicted\nFig.4 Model forseasonallyadjustedvitamin D.\nE.

Wilhelm-Leen et al.\n| Vitamin D deficiency and frailty\nPotential differences in the association of 25-\nhydroxyvitamin D with frailty by race, i.e., some-\nwhat stronger associations at lower threshold\n25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations for non-white\nparticipants, highlight the need to consider race\nwhen assessing optimal vitamin D status.\nAtleastthreerecentstudieshaveevaluated thepossi-\nble association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D defi-\nciency and frailty. Boxer et al. reported that amongst\npersons with systolic heart failure, low serum 25-\nhydroxyvitamin D predicted a higher frailty score\n[21]. Puts et al. report a significant association be-\ntween lower serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and frailty\namongst persons older than 65, but employ an alter-\nnate definition of frailty that bears little resemblance\nto the Fried criteria [20]. Shardell et al. demonstrated\nan association between low serum 25-hydroxyvita-\nmin D and frailty amongst persons older than 65 in a\ngeneral population cohort, but only amongst men.\nMoreover, this study made no apparent attempt to\ncontrolforseasonofblood collection[22].\nOur study's strengths include analysis of a nationally\nrepresentative sample of US adults with robust\nrecruitment of persons older than 80 years. We also\nadjusted for a wide array of sociodemographic fac-\ntors, comorbid conditions and environmental factors\nthat might have confounded the vitamin D-frailty\nrelation. Our study also carries a few important\nlimitations. First, NHANES III data are primarily\ncross-sectional and we were unable to follow serum\n25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations over time. Sec-\nondly, 25-hydroxyvitamin D data were missing in\nmore than half of home-examined participants and\nwere therefore excluded from our primary analysis.\nSince these home-examined participants tended to\nhave more comorbidity than participants examined\nin mobile units, we have probably underestimated\nthe population prevalence of frailty (and 25-hydrox-\nyvitaminD deficiency).\nAn additional challenge of our study was the com-\nplexity of the NHANES sampling scheme whereby\nnorthern dwelling survey participants were sampled\nprimarily in the summer months and residents of\nsouthern states were sampled year-round with an\nemphasis on the winter months. This sampling\nscheme had the potential to increase misclassifica-\ntion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D insufficient and defi-\ncientparticipants.Wewere reassuredthattheresults\nof our two sensitivity analyses, aimed at addressing\nthis potential misclassification, qualitatively con-\nfirmed the results from our primary analysis. Using\nseasonally adjusted 25-hydroxyvitamin D concen-\ntrations, we found a nearly threefold increase in the\nodds of frailty amongst whites with 25-hydroxyvita-\nmin D deficiency and a greater than twofold increase\nin the odds of frailty amongst non-whites with 25-\nhydroxyvitamin D insufficiency. The slightly lower\nodds of frailty in the seasonally adjusted analysis as\ncompared to the primary analysis may appear coun-\nter intuitive if, as we expect, seasonal adjustment of\n25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations reduces mis-\nclassification of 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency and\ninsufficiency. However, because persons living in\nnorthern states were sampled in the summer, those\npersons classified as 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficient\nusing 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations not cor-\nrected for season were the most `deficient of the defi-\ncient.' For this reason, the association between 25-\nhydroxyvitamin D deficiency and frailty appeared\nstronger in the primary analysis. In effect, some par-\nticipants at the upper end of the deficient range were\nmisclassified as `insufficient' in the base case analy-\nsis. With re-classification in the seasonally adjusted\nTable 4 Comparison of odds ratios\nfromfour models\nNon-white White\nSeasonallyadjustedvitaminDmodel,n = 5048.\nSeasonallyandlatitudeadjustedmodel,n = 2193.\naOddsratioforfrailtyassociated withvitaminDdeficiency(serumvitaminD < 15 ng mL)1).\nE. R. Wilhelm-Leen et al.\n| Vitamin D deficiency and frailty\nanalysis, the odds of frailty associated with 25-hy-\ndroxyvitaminD deficiencywere attenuated.\nIt is also relevant to note that our seasonally\nadjusted analysis applied an adjustment based\nexclusively on residents of the southern census\nregion on other census regions. This method for\nseasonal adjustment has an obvious limitation,\nnamely that southern seasonal adjustment may\nintroduce novel bias to 25-hydroxyvitamin D mea-\nsurements in participants living in other census re-\ngions. This bias could take several potential forms.\nFor example, residents in the hot, more humid\nsouth may plausibly spend less time outside during\nthe summer months (rather, choosing indoor air-\nconditioned settings) than residents of more north-\nern latitudes where the weather is more temperate.\nTherefore, the relative increase in summer sun\nexposure may be attenuated in the south compared\nwith other regions. Unfortunately, it was not possi-\nble to create a model for seasonal adjustment based\non data from all four census regions.\nSimilarly, our secondary analysis in the subset of\nparticipants for whomlatitude ofresidencewasavail-\nable also qualitatively confirmed the results of our\nprimary analysis. The latitude adjusted analysis\nshowed a greater than fivefold increase in the odds of\nfrailty amongst whites with 25-hydroxyvitamin D\ndeficiencyand a greater than threefold increaseinthe\nodds of frailty amongst non-whites with 25-hydrox-\nyvitamin D deficiency. Whilst we believe that our\nsensitivity analyses suggest a robust association\nbetween vitamin D deficiency and frailty, there is\nlikely to be residual confounding by several factors\nfor which we could not adjust, including dietary 25-\nhydroxyvitamin D intake, sun exposure (beyond that\naccounted for by month of evaluation and latitude),\nmelanin content in skin (beyond what is accounted\nfor by self-reported race), and the use (and type) of\nsunscreen.\nThe intersection of 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency\nand ageing is an important area of research with\nmuch that remains to be studied. In the future,\nresearchers should focus on longitudinal data\nthat demonstrate how 25-hydroxyvitamin D status\nchanges over time in older adults who are ageing well\nand in those who are ageing poorly. In addition, fur-\ntherstudiesshouldinvestigatewhetherinterventions\nto correct deficiency and insufficiency of 25-hydrox-\nyvitamin D status, such as supplementation and/ or\nsun exposure, could reduce frailty or improve physi-\ncalfunctioninginfrailpersons.\nConflictofintereststatement\nNoconflictofinterestwas declared.\nReferences\n1 Jones DM, Song X, Rockwood K.
