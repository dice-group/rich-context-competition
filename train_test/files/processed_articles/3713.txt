    "abstract": "Abstract\nWaist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and breast size are morphological traits that are associated with female attractiveness. Previous studies\nusing line drawings of women have shown that men across cultures rate low WHRs (0.6 and 0.7) as most attractive. In this study,\nwe used additional viewing measurements (i.e., first fixation duration and visual regressions) to measure visual attention and\nrecord how long participants first focused on the female body and whether they regressed back to an area of interest. Addi-\ntionally, we manipulated skin tone to determine whether they preferred light- or dark-skinned women. In two eye tracking\nexperiments, participants rated the attractiveness of female nude images varying in WHR (0.5\u00ad0.9), breast size, and skin tone. We\nmeasured first fixation duration, gaze duration, and total time. The overall results of both studies revealed that visual attention fell\nmostly on the face, the breasts, and the midriff of the female body, supporting the evolutionary view that reproductively relevant\nregions of the female body are important to female attractiveness. Because the stimuli varied in skin tone and the participants\nwere mainly Hispanic of Mexican American descent, the findings from these studies also support a preference for low WHRs and\nreproductively relevant regions of the female body.\n",

Cieslicka1\n Keywords\nvisual attention, female physical attractiveness, sexual selection, waist-to-hip ratio, eye tracking\nIntroduction\nPhysical characteristics (e.g., narrow waist, long legs, and\nmedium\u00adlarge breasts) play an important role in determining\nattractiveness and selecting a potential mate, particularly in\nmen's evaluations of women (Dixson, Grimshaw, Linklater,\nOne of the most explored areas of research in judging attrac-\ntiveness is the waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), or the size of a\nwoman's waist in relation to her hips, including her buttocks.\nStudies show that women who have a low WHR are rated as\nmore attractive and have advantages associated with reproduc-\n0.7 have been rated as being more attractive, in better health,\nand of higher reproductive value (Singh, 1993; Singh & Young,\n1995). This article examines male and female Mexican Amer-\nican perceptions of attractiveness using eye movements to\nexplore how this ethnic group might differ from others previ-\nously studied in the way it views attractiveness. Previous\ncella, & Reed, 2005) has traditionally used line drawings and\nnonecologically valid images to assess female attractiveness.\nMore recently, research in this domain is beginning to use\ntechnologically advanced empirical techniques, such as func-\ntional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and eye tracking, to\naccurately and objectively measure perceived female attraction\nadvantage of using eye movements to measure attractiveness is\nthat they provide objective and precise recordings of where and\nwhen (in ms) a particular region of interest (ROI), such as the\nbreasts or the midriff, receives the most attention, using mul-\ntiple indicators of eye movements as participants scan target\npictures.\n1 Department of Psychology and Communication, Texas A&M International\nUniversity, Laredo, TX, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nRay Garza, Department of Psychology and Communication, Texas A&M\nEmail: ray.garza@tamiu.edu\nEvolutionary Psychology\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav\nevp.sagepub.com\nCreative Commons CC-BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 License\n(http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits non-commercial use, reproduction and distribution of the work without further\npermission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access page (https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\nAttraction and Mate Selection\nHumans have evolved certain cognitive strategies or mental\nshortcuts to aid in mate selection. These characteristics include\na dependence on certain morphological traits that are associ-\nated with fertility to determine whether an individual is attrac-\ntive (e.g., narrow waist). If certain morphological traits are\nassociated with fertility and reproductive value in women, it\nfollows that men should have cognitive mechanisms that lead\nthem to find such features attractive. Singh and Young (1995)\nproposed that men judge women to be most attractive within an\nideal range of WHRs. To evaluate male preference for lower\nWHRs, Singh (1993) utilized line drawings exhibiting a range\nof WHRs (0.7, 0.8, and 0.9) to determine whether there was a\npreference for specific waist characteristics. Findings revealed\nthat for all body types, the lowest WHR was rated as most\nattractive. It is interesting to note that normal body types and\nlow WHRs were rated high in attractiveness, sexiness, good\nhealth, and capacity for childbearing, all of which relate to\nfertility. In a follow-up study, Singh and Young (1995) looked\nat the WHR in relation to breast size and the role of both in\ndetermining personal attributes and desirability for romantic\nrelationships. Singh and Young contend that in times of famine\nand food shortages, women would have needed to store surplus\nenergy for successful reproduction, most notably in the gluteo-\nfemoral region and breast for milk production. This would have\nresulted in men having an evolved preference for women who\nexhibit lower WHRs and bigger breast size. Singh and Young\nfound out that low, rather than high, WHR did indeed play a\nsignificant role in determining attractiveness, good health, fem-\ninine features, kindness, and understanding. Women categor-\nized as having a high WHR were typically rated as less\nattractive and older looking, an attribute not consistent with\nreproductive success. Images that portrayed a low WHR and\nlarger breasts were rated as most attractive and youthful look-\ning, in keeping with attractiveness and reproductive success.\nMoreover, fMRI findings (e.g., Platek & Singh, 2010) have\nrevealed that brain areas associated with reward processing and\ndecision making (e.g., the anterior paracingulate, nucleus\naccumbens) become activated when men view images depict-\ning low WHRs.\nDespite playing an important role in attractiveness, it is not\nclear what importance breast size plays in sexual selection.\nBreast size may indicate reproductive capability, with small\nbreasts being characteristic of a young, prepubescent girl, and\nlarge breasts characteristic of an older, reproductively capable\nwoman (Singh & Young, 1995). Previous research by Singh\nand Young found breast size to be an important contributor to\nfemale attractiveness. In their study, breast size and WHRs\nwere used as predictors of attractiveness, health, femininity,\nand kindness and understanding. They concluded that images\nof slender women with large breasts were rated as most attrac-\ntive. Additionally, images of plump women with large breasts\nwere rated as less attractive than images of slender women with\nsmall or large breasts. In a follow-up experiment, Singh and\nYoung reported that female figures with large breasts and\nnarrow hips were rated as older than figures with small breasts\nand narrow hips. It is important to note, however, that the\nperception of increased age was more apparent when the fig-\nures had wide hips.\nAnother sexually dimorphic trait that is associated with sex-\nual selection is skin tone. Women are lighter skinned than men\nvan den Berghe & Frost, 1986), even when one controls for\ndegree of sun exposure. Interestingly, skin tone becomes sexu-\nally dimorphic at puberty, when girls become lighter skinned\nthan boys. According to Mesa's (1983) study on Spanish\nschoolchildren, skin color darkens progressively before pub-\nerty and then lightens during adolescence, eventually forming\na stable sex difference in adulthood. This sex difference is most\npronounced in humans of medium skin color and seems to be\nconstrained in very dark- and very light-skinned humans. Sim-\nilar sex differences have been noted in hair color, which dar-\nkens during adolescence in both sexes but more so in boys than\nden Berghe & Frost, 1986). There are two main evolutionary\nexplanations for the sexually dimorphic nature of skin tone: (1)\nskin tone is used as a signal of neoteny and (2) skin tone is used\nas an indicator of fertility. Neotenous traits are associated with\nchildlike or juvenile characteristics, such as body fat, high-\npitched voice, and lighter skin. In women, a lighter skin tone\nmay be associated with what is known as infantile mimicry,\nthat is, these physical characteristics are said to serve as an\nelicitor of male nurturance, similar to nurturance given to a\n1986). A childlike appearance may also reduce aggressive male\nfeelings and hence the likelihood of aggressive behavior. Dif-\nferences in skin tone are also apparent in line with hormonal\nchanges in women. Skin tone can darken during pregnancy,\nduring the infertile phases of the menstrual cycle, and while\none is taking contraceptives (van den Berghe & Frost, 1986).\nSkin tone, therefore, functions as a means of determining the\nfecundability of women (i.e., lighter skin tone is associated\nwith greater reproductive potential). A cross-cultural study of\n51 societies found that 47 showed a preference for the lighter\nend of the locally represented spectrum of skin tones (van den\nEthnic Differences\nAlthough previous studies have primarily focused on European\nand European American men, research on other ethnic mino-\nrities, such as Hispanics, who are the focus of this study, has not\nbeen well documented. The ideal female body of Western cul-\ntures (Singh & Luis, 1995) differs in some respects from that of\nother cultures, particularly hunter gatherers. In examining eth-\nnic differences in WHR, Singh's (1994) operating assumption\nwas that every culture has distinct characteristics in terms of\nwhat they look for in the opposite sex. Marlowe, Apicella, and\nReed (2005) looked into WHR preferences among the Hazda\nhunter gatherers of Tanzania using a frontal 2-D WHR and a\nprofile WHR, which is a 2-D photo showing the side view of an\n2 Evolutionary Psychology\nimage where the waist and buttocks are more visible. The\nresults showed that Hazda men's WHR preferences for the\nfrontal images were similar to the choices made by European\nAmerican men. However, preference for higher WHRs was\nseen in images that portrayed profile images. European Amer-\nican men preferred profile images with a 0.7 WHR, while\nHazda men preferred profile images with a 0.9 WHR (Marlowe\net al., 2005). In an extension of Marlowe et al.'s study, Swami,\nJones, Einon, and Furnham (2009) used British men who were\nclassified as being European Caucasian or of African descent.\nThey also used a sample of African men from Cape Town,\nSouth Africa. The images used in this study were of women\nof both ethnicities in a profile pose (side view). Swami et al.\n(2009) found that South African men preferred high WHR\nBlack women with large breasts and high WHR White women\nwith small breasts. The British sample, on the other hand,\npreferred high WHR Black women with small breasts and high\nWHR women with large breasts. Thus, this pattern of results\nseems to argue against low WHR preferences and suggests\ncross-cultural differences. As for Hispanics, little is known\nabout their WHR preferences. By better understanding the pre-\nferences of a Hispanic population, we may better understand\nhow selection pressures have created cognitive strategies or\nmental shortcuts for assessment of WHR.\nEye Movements and Attractiveness\nRecently, researchers have been utilizing eye movements to\nmeasure which features are used to assess attractiveness. Eye\nmovements or eye tracking methodology is a sensitive gaze-\ncontingency technique that measures real-time visual process-\ning. It provides a precise measurement of when and where\nparticipants look without evoking a conscious response (i.e.,\nwithout relying on the participant's explicit awareness). In a\ntypical eye movement study, participants are simply asked to\ninspect a picture/image to determine whether it is attractive\n(yes/no type of answer). For example, researchers might be\ninterested in the number of eye fixations or the amount of time\na person spends looking at a particular area of a target image.\nEye movements show that differences in the duration and num-\nber of fixations indicate interest in a specific region of the\n1987). Eye movements are important visual attention measure-\nments because where a person looks or fixates on indicates\nthe initial stage before the stimulus is processed and encoded\n(Yantis, 2005). Moreover, attractiveness is a strong factor in\ndetermining visual attention, as demonstrated in previous\nresearch showing that (1) people focus more attention on rele-\nvant versus irrelevant information (Suschinsky et al., 2007), (2)\ninfants gaze longer at attractive or familiar adults (Langlois\net al., 1987), and (3) men stare longer at attractive female faces\ncally, eye tracking studies show that people look longer at\nimages that portray the opposite sex and limit their viewing\nof the face when the image contains erotic content (Lykins,\nstudies are consistent with eye tracking research, which shows\ndifferences in visual attention to the female body and to spe-\ncific ROIs.\nWhat is the relationship between eye movements and WHR\nresearch? In one of the first studies to use eye movements, Sus-\nchinsky, Elias, and Krupp (2007) examined visual attention to\nimages of different female WHRs (0.68\u00ad0.85), and the partici-\npants were asked to rate the women's attractiveness. The results\nshowed that men directed most of their visual attention (i.e.,\nfixations) to regions that were reproductively significant, such\nas the breasts, the waist, and the hips. More importantly, women\nwith lower WHRs received the most visual attention, indicating\nmale interest in that particular region of the body. Moreover,\nwomen with lower WHRs were also rated as the most attractive.\nIn a related study, Hewig, Trippe, Hecht, Straube, and Milt-\nner (2008) explored gender differences and gaze patterns of\nparticipants who were looking at a male or female body. Parti-\ncipants were exposed to images of fully clothed men and\nwomen. Each image had the same posture, a similar clothing\nstyle, and a similar size of body regions. Overall, findings\nindicated that, when exposed to images of the opposite sex,\nparticipants were more likely to rate them as attractive and\nspent longer time viewing them. Men spent significantly more\ntime focusing on the breast area. Indeed, these patterns of\nresults are consistent with evolutionary strategies of mate\nselection (Hewig, Trippe, Hecht, Straube, & Miltner, 2008) and\nsuggest that longer viewing time is associated with attraction.\nDural, Cetinkaya, and Gulbertekin (2008) presented male and\nfemale participants with female images with altered overall\nweight, which included underweight, normal-weight, and over-\nweight individuals as well as varying WHRs (0.7, 0.8, 0.9, and\n1.0). The attractiveness of each image was rated by measuring\neye fixations. The body was divided into three ROIs: the upper\ntrunk (e.g., the breasts), below the breasts to the waist, and the\nhips to the feet. Analysis of eye fixations revealed significant sex\ndifferences in attention to the region from below the breasts to\nthe waist and including the overall waist-to-hip area. Male par-\nticipants rated this region more attractive than the other ROIs\nand spent more time looking at it. Dural et al. concluded that\nWHR importance must be an evolved cognitive mechanism in\nmate selection due to the overall gender differences, that is, male\nparticipants rated the region from the breasts to the waist as the\nmost attractive region and gave it the most visual attention.\nIn a more recent study, Dixson, Grimshaw, Linklater, &\nDixon (2010) investigated how individuals viewed nude female\nimages as a function of WHR. The images were graphically\nmanipulated to represent WHRs of 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9. The nude\nimage was divided into six anatomical ROIs: face, breasts,\nwaist, hips and thighs, genitals, and legs for the frontal pose.\nThe back pose was divided into the head, upper back, waist,\nbuttocks, rear thighs, and rear legs. Results showed that,\nregardless of the frontal or rear poses, the midriff received the\nmost eye fixations and total time; that is, participants made\nmore visual fixations and spent the most time looking at the\nwaist area. Moreover, the images with the lowest WHR (0.7)\nGarza et al. 3\nwere the ones that received the most first fixations on the\nbreasts. In other words, when shown a woman who exhibited\nthe lowest WHR, individuals first fixated on the breasts. It has\nbeen argued that first fixations reflect automaticity, in that\nindividuals look at a specific area first without awareness,\nbefore consciously focusing on other areas. For higher WHRs\n(0.8 and 0.9), individuals fixated on the midriff more. Accord-\ningly, men will employ the WHR as a cognitive mechanism\nfilter in order to identify women who do not meet the percei-\nver's expectations of attractiveness and fertility. Men in the\nDixson et al.'s (2010) study may have automatically focused\non the woman's breast, as seen with WHRs of 0.7 and 0.9,\nbecause the WHR preference was already met. This propensity\nfor men to look at the 0.7 WHR is known as the ``first pass\nfilter,'' and it tends to exclude women who are unhealthy or\nhave low reproductive value (Singh, 1993). Once WHRs higher\nthan 0.7 are filtered out, men will use other characteristics of\nthe female body (i.e., head, breasts, and skin tone) to determine\na final mate selection (Singh, 1993). Unfortunately, Dixson\net al. (2010) measured first fixations but not first fixation dura-\ntion. By including this second measurement, we wish to find\nout not only whether individuals look for a 0.7 WHR first but\nalso whether they are more interested in the breasts and the\nmidriff than in other regions of the body.\nPresent Study\nThe present study expands on Dixson et al. (2010) in three\nimportant ways. (1) It includes first fixation duration, gaze\nduration, and visual regressions. These additional visual mea-\nsurements will further explore the first pass filter by recording\nautomatic processing time (i.e., number of first fixations and\nfirst fixation duration), time spent on an ROI (i.e., gaze dura-\ntion), and whether individuals regress back to a specific ROI\n(i.e., visual regressions). (2) This study measures attractiveness\nratings by using yes/no responses immediately after the image\nis presented. This will give us an insight into the intuitive\njudgments individuals make when looking at a female image\nwithout having to spend a considerable amount of time using a\nrating system that is time consuming and might discourage\n``intuitive'' responses. (3) Furthermore, the experiment\ndescribed here looks at an understudied population and deter-\nmines the extent to which previous findings can be generalized\nto the Hispanic population. Additionally, the study examines\nthe gender differences that exist in visual attention. Previous\nstudies have primarily focused on male populations; therefore,\nby using both men and women, we can provide further insights\ninto the question of whether visual attraction is a gender or a\ngeneral preference. The possibility that males spend a consid-\nerable amount of time attending to specific areas of the body\nwhen compared to females would further support the mate (i.e.,\nmale) selection preferences hypothesis. A finding that a low\nWHR ratio is preferred, and that individuals focus on reproduc-\ntively relevant regions, would further support the possibility\nthat cognitive strategies are used to assess the physical charac-\nteristics that are sought for in women, primarily by male\nparticipants. Therefore, in this study, we hypothesized the fol-\n(2007), the areas of the breast and midriff will receive more\nvisual attention than other areas; (2) the lower the WHR, the\nmore attractive ratings it will receive; and (3) there will be\ngender differences in the amount of visual attention displayed,\nthat is, men will spend longer time viewing the images than will\nwomen.\nExperiment 1\nMaterial and Method\nParticipants\nstudents of Mexican American descent, ranging from 18\u00ad40\nA and M International University (TAMIU) undergraduate pop-\nulation. Participants received class credit for their participation.\nMaterials\nA color photograph taken from Dixson et al.'s (2010) study of a\nnude woman facing forward was used and altered to meet the\nrequired dimensions. Using Adobe Photoshop CS6, version\n13.0.1.1, the image's waist and breast size were manipulated\nby making either the waist or the breasts appear small, medium,\nor large. A professional artist and expert in the Photoshop\nsoftware application performed the image alterations. A low\nWHR image was made by digitally reducing the waist and a\nhigh WHR image by expanding the waist. WHRs were oper-\nationally defined by a numerical ratio of 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9, by\ndividing the waist of the image with the hips. As in Dixson\nationally defined as small (80% of the original image), medium\n(original breasts of the image), or large (120% of the original\nimage). In total, nine images exhibited different combinations\nof waist and breast sizes, so that one image could have a small\nwaist-small breast, small waist-medium breast, or small waist-\nlarge breast, and the sequence was continued for all of the\nimages. The ROIs were the six anatomical regions used in\nDixson et al's. (2011) study, which included the following:\n(1) the face and neck, from the top of the head to the clavicle;\n(2) the breasts, as measured from the clavicle to the border of\nthe bottom of the breasts; (3) the midriff, which included the\nwaist and extended from the bottom of the breasts to the widest\npart of the hips; (4) the groin, which encompassed the area\nshowing pubic hair; (5) the thighs, beginning at the end of the\nmidriff border to the knee; and (6) the legs and feet, which were\nthe remaining portion of the female body. All images were\ninput into SR-Experiment Builder and modified to meet the\nsize requirements, so that they could be viewed clearly. Each\nthe bit depth was set at 24. Additionally, we set ROIs for all of\n4 Evolutionary Psychology\nthe images, so as to know specifically which part of the body\nparticipants fixated on more.\nProcedure\nUpon arrival at the laboratory, participants completed a consent\nform. They were then instructed to sit comfortably, so that they\nwere able to position their chin on a chinrest and maintain\nstability. Visual calibrations were conducted to ensure that the\neye tracker was accurately recording the participants' eye\nmovements. The visual recording was monocular, that is, the\neye tracker recorded the movements of the right eye. The dis-\ntance between the chinrest and the eye tracker was 55 cm.\nExperimental stimuli were presented using SR-Experiment\nBuilder running on Windows OS 7, and the EyeLink 1000 eye\ntracker was connected to a dedicated host computer running on\ndisk operating system.\nExperimental instructions were presented on the computer\nscreen, and participants familiarized themselves with a Micro-\nsoft Sidewinder Plug and Play Gamepad used to rate image\nattractiveness. Participants were instructed to use the left trig-\nger for ``not attractive'' and the right trigger for ``attractive.'' In\nrating the images, participants were instructed to make an intui-\ntive judgment. No time limit was set for the images. Before the\nexperimental images were shown, participants rated six pic-\ntures as part of the practice block. A total of nine experimental\nimages were shown in each individual session, and the order of\nthe images was randomized for each experimental session.\nIn recording eye measurements, first eye fixation was deter-\nmined by the first area (ROI) participants viewed. First fixation\nduration was the amount of time participants focused first on a\nspecific ROI (head, breasts, midriff, groin, thighs, and legs/feet).\nGaze duration time was the entire time participants focused on a\nspecific ROI throughout the trial. The participant's total time\nwas measured by how long they viewed each image (i.e., the\noverall duration of the trial). This was primarily done to measure\nthe effect that breast size and WHR manipulations had on view-\ning the entire image. Fixation count was determined by how\nmany visual fixations were recorded for a specific ROI. Finally,\nregressions were operationalized as the number of times parti-\ncipants returned to an ROI throughout a trial.\nResults\nData from three participants were excluded because the eye\ntracker camera was unable to record their eye movements due\nto the type of corrective lenses they were using.\nAttractiveness\nWHR and breast size have both been used to determine a\nwoman's attractiveness. As in Singh (1993), Suchinsksy et al.\nrelationship between breast size and attractiveness and between\nWHR and attractiveness. Breast size, particularly large breasts,\nhas often been used as an indicator of female attractiveness\n(Singh & Young, 1995). Previous research has also indicated\nthat a low WHR is considered more attractive and a preferred\ncharacteristic in mate selection. A logistic regression using\nWHRs (0.7, 0.8, and 0.9) and breast size (small, medium, and\nlarge) was performed to determine whether these dummy-\ncoded predictor variables would increase the likelihood of rat-\ning a female figure as more attractive (i.e., no/yes ratings and\ndummy coded). Participants made intuitive judgments while\nbeing visually recorded. Since past research has found that a\nlow WHR is associated with attractiveness, the highest WHR\n(0.9) was used as a reference category. Because large breasts\nare generally preferred, we used small breasts as a reference\ncategory. The logistic regression was statistically significant,\nof 0.7 or 0.8, they were 4 times more likely to be rated as\nattractive (see Table 1). When the images portrayed medium\nor large breasts, they were more likely to be rated as attractive.\nFirst Fixations\nFor all WHR images (0.7, 0.8, and 0.9), breasts received the\nTable 2). We further examined whether the head, breasts, and\nmidriff ROIs were influenced by WHRs.

In this\nexperiment, the focus was on how intuitive these responses\nwould be while participants viewed images. This is why a binary\nresponse (i.e., yes/no) was used to prevent participants from\nspending too much time considering different possibilities and\ninstead encourage them to provide a fast and intuitive judgment.\nAs predicted, the lowest WHR (0.7) increased the likelihood of\nrating the image as attractive, more so than the higher WHRs.\nThis was also seen with the 0.9 WHR. Breast size was varied as\nwell, with the medium and large breasts slightly increasing the\nlikelihood of rating the image as attractive. As with Dixson et al.\nthe lower the WHR, the higher was the attractiveness rating.\nThese results support the importance of the WHR in ratings of\nattractiveness and extend this importance to a Hispanic popula-\ntion of Mexican American descent, hence indicating that WHRs\nare cross culturally used to assess attractiveness.\nAnother purpose of the present study was to determine\nwhich regions of the female body received the most visual\nattention. By using eye movements, we were able to determine\nwhich areas were most important. During first fixations, parti-\ncipants directed their attention toward the upper parts of the\nbody (i.e., head, breasts, and midriff), which are typically con-\nsidered more reproductively relevant to male participants.\nThere were more first fixations directed toward the breasts than\ntoward the midriff, and these differences were significant for\npresent results replicated Dixson et al.'s (2010) findings when\nthe WHR was 0.7. Thus, based on first fixation counts, it\nappears that the small and medium breasts attract the most\nattention for all WHRs, except for the 0.9 WHR.\nIn addition, we measured first fixation duration, that is, the\nlength of time participants focused on the first area they\nviewed. This measurement was not included in Dixson et al.\n(2010). The results revealed that the midriff was the region of\nthe body that participants focused on the longest. To the best of\nour knowledge, this measurement has never been utilized\nbefore in this area of research. Although the breasts received\nthe most first fixations, the midriff received a longer duration\nof first fixations. It can be argued that the number of first\nfixations merely represents participants' scanning of the image,\nwhile the duration of first fixations indicates the degree of\ninterest in a particular region. Thus, it may very well be the\ncase that first fixation duration is a reasonable indicator of the\nfirst pass filter, or mental module, proposed by Singh (1993) as\na major determinant of preferences for low female WHRs.\nTo measure gaze duration, we recorded the amount of time\nparticipants spent looking at a WHR image. As with Dixson\nthe upper part of the female body longer than the lower parts.\nThis is consistent with evolutionary thinking that the upper\nparts of the body are key to males in mate selection and attrac-\ntiveness (Suschinsky et al., 2007). More specifically, the\nbreasts received the longest gaze duration and also showed the\ngreatest gender differences. Men spent significantly longer\ntime viewing each ROI, except for the feet. Other than the\neffect of gender, these differences in gaze duration are consis-\ntent with Dixson et al. (2010) for the ROIs. Overall, male\nviewing times were more directed toward ROIs, whereas\nwomen were more evenly distributed in their viewing times.\nWe wanted to determine whether manipulation of the WHR\nwould affect the total time spent viewing female images. Over-\nall, male participants viewed the lowest WHR (0.7) longer than\nthe 0.8 and 0.9 WHRs. Moreover, in male participants, the 0.7\nand 0.8 WHRs received the longest total time when paired with\nsmall breasts. When the image had a 0.9 WHR, male participants\nviewed the one with the largest breasts the longest. This is an\nadditional finding that, to the best of our knowledge, has not\nbeen reported in the literature. Previous research has looked\nmostly into overall ratings of attractiveness as a function of\nWHR and breast size, and the eye tracking literature has focused\nmostly on gaze duration and fixation count. These findings may\nimply that WHR and breast size can be conflicting signals of\nphenotypic quality, the outcome being longer decision times.\nWith regard to visual regressions or the likelihood of partici-\npants returning to a viewed ROI, the ROIs in the upper body\nreceived the highest number of visual regressions for all three\nWHRs. In particular, the lowest WHR produced the highest\nnumber of regressions. This is a new finding, and the first time\nthat visual regressions have been considered in sexual attraction\nresearch. More importantly, the visual regressions are consistent\nwith the importance of the upper body, which encompasses the\nmore reproductively relevant regions. Male participants looked\nback the most at the upper body, most notably, the head and the\nbreasts, when the woman had a low WHR (0.7).\nLow WHRs were rated as most attractive, and breast size did\nnot play a role in the attractiveness ratings. Overall, it was\napparent that participants focused most of their visual attention\non the upper female body. This is highlighted by our findings\nfrom first fixations, first fixation duration, gaze duration, fixa-\ntion count, and visual regressions. For measurements of total\ntime, fixation count, and visual regressions, the results indicate\nthe importance of low WHRs (0.7). Although participants did\nlook first at the breasts (i.e., first fixation), we believe that first\nfixation duration should be considered more important because\nit signifies degree of attention, instead of a visual scan. To\nsummarize the findings of Experiment 1, the lower the WHR,\nthe more attractive the female image seemed. We were also\nable to confirm our hypothesis that visual attention would be\ndirected toward the breasts and the midriff, which are repro-\nductively relevant regions. Finally, gender differences were\nobserved as well, that is, men spent more time than did women\nviewing images and viewing the ROIs.\nExperiment 2\nExperiment 2 further manipulated WHR (0.5 and 0.6) and skin\ntone (dark vs. light). This was done to further explore whether\nusing lower WHRs than what has been commonly used so far\n8 Evolutionary Psychology\nFrost, 1986), participants found lighter-skinned women to be\nmore attractive. If skin tone plays a role in attractiveness, we\nwould expect dark and light complexions to be assessed differ-\nently, as shown by eye movements and attractiveness ratings.\nOverall, we expected Experiment 2 to replicate and further\ncorroborate the results of Experiment 1. That is, the breasts\nand the midriff should receive more visual attention than other\nregions (e.g., thighs and feet).\nMaterial and Method\nParticipants\nNinety-eight Hispanic students from Mexican American des-\nParticipants were recruited from the TAMIU undergraduate\npopulation. None of the participants from Experiment 2 took\npart in Experiment 1.\nMaterials\nExperimental materials were the same as in Experiment 1, with\nthe exception that the female image was modified to include 0.5\nand 0.6 WHRs. In addition, skin tone was manipulated to create\na set of dark skin and light skin tone images. A total of 15 images\nfor each skin tone (i.e., dark vs. light) were created with five\nferent breast sizes (i.e., small, medium, and large). A total of 30\nimages were used in the experiment. The attractiveness scale\nwas identical to the one used in Dixson et al. (2010). Attractive-\nness was measured on a 6-point Likert-type scale (1 \u00bc unattrac-\ntive, 2 \u00bc slightly attractive, 3 \u00bc moderately attractive, 4 \u00bc\nattractive, 5 \u00bc very attractive, and 6 \u00bc extremely attractive).\nProcedure\nThe eye tracking sessions followed the same procedure as in\nExperiment 1. Immediately after completion of the experimental\nsession, participants proceeded to a second computer station to\nrate the attractiveness of the female images they were exposed\nto. Image presentation for the attractiveness-rating task was per-\nformed on an Apple iMac computer, using PsyScope and ioLab\nSystems USB Button Box. This task was randomly assigned, so\nthat participants received a set of 15 images that were either dark\nskinned or light skinned. They were first given a practice trial of\nthree pictures to familiarize them with the task.\nResults\nAttractiveness\nAs in Experiment 1, attractiveness ratings using a dichotomous\nvariable were made as a function of WHR and breast size.

Most notably, the head and the breasts received\nthe highest number of visual regressions for all WHRs, as\nseen in Figure 8.

In line with Experiment\n1, most visual regressions focused on the upper female body\n(i.e., head, breasts, and midriff).\nA separate post hoc analysis was conducted in order to\ndetermine differences between ratings of attractiveness and\nvisual measurements.

For the 0.7 WHR, total viewing\ntime did not differ significantly between participants who\nrated the image as attractive and those who did not (p \u00bc\n.78). Additionally, there was a significant three-way inter-\naction between WHR, skin tone, and attractiveness rating,\nwere rated as attractive were looked at longer (see Figure 9).\nFixation count showed an interaction between ROI and attrac-\ncipants who rated the image as attractive made more visual\nfixations on that image; however, there were no gender\ndifferences.\nDiscussion\nIn Experiment 2, our main goal was to determine whether\nlower WHRs (0.5 and 0.6) than in Experiment 1 would produce\nsimilar findings. Previous studies (Dixson et al., 2010; Henss,\nthat the lower the WHR, the more attractive the women would\nbe rated. Additionally, we altered the image's skin tone to\ndetermine whether skin tone played any role in attractiveness\nand in visual attention.\nAs in Experiment 1, we found that participants' intuitive\njudgments of attractiveness were inversely related to WHR.\nThat is, the lower the WHR, the more likely participants rated\nthe image as attractive. As a methodological issue, we wanted\nto compare the YES/NO scale used in the experiment with the\nmore commonly used 6-point Likert-type scale of attractive-\nness. Our results showed that the YES/NO responses were\nidentical to those produced with the attractiveness scale used\nUsing the attractiveness scale, we also wanted to determine\nwhether waist size, breast size, and skin tone were associated\nwith attractiveness. For waist size, the image with the lowest\nWHR (0.5) received the highest rating of attractiveness. This\nstudy is one of the first to indicate that the 0.5 WHR is rated\nhighly on the attractiveness scale. For breast size, the image\nwith medium breasts received the highest rating of attractive-\nness. In contrast to Singh (1993), large breasts did not receive\nTable 7.

Moreover, men were more\nlikely than women to give female images higher ratings of\nattractiveness. Another important finding was that, unlike other\nfindings (e.g., Swami et al., 2008), we did not find an overall\nsignificant relationship between attractiveness ratings and skin\ntone. However, when breaking the results down by gender, we\nfound that darker-skinned women seemed more attractive to\nmen than to women.\nThe eye movement results of Experiment 2 replicated those\nof Experiment 1, with the exception of the first fixation results.\nFirst fixations were directed toward the thighs, as opposed to\nthe breasts (as in Experiment 1). This could be accounted for by\nthe different WHRs that were used, the thighs (including the\nbuttocks) being more noticeable. However, first fixation dura-\ntion was identical in the two experiments. As in the first experi-\nment, participants spent more time viewing the breasts and the\nmidriff. This finding supports Singh (1993) in his notion of a\nfirst pass filter, that is, unconsciously, men will use the waist\narea as a measure of attractiveness. Gaze duration revealed\nsimilar patterns. The ROIs that received the most visual atten-\ntion were the reproductively relevant ones, most notably the\nhead, the breasts, and the midriff. This difference was more\npronounced in men. This same pattern was reported in the first\nexperiment. Specifically, men showed more interest in all the\nareas of the female body, with the exception of the feet. The\nupper parts of the body are often physical cues for mate selec-\ntion; therefore, the time spent looking at the upper body dif-\nfered significantly from the time spent looking at the lower\nbody.\nTotal time data replicated the results found in Experiment 1\nwhen looking at gender differences. Men spent more time\nviewing the breasts of the female when the WHR was 0.7. Total\ntime results also showed that men spent significantly more time\nviewing the image than did women. Although participants did\nnot rate the light skin tone as more attractive than the dark one\non the Likert-type scale, they spent significantly greater time\nviewing the light-skinned images than the dark-skinned ones\nwhen making the intuitive attractiveness response (i.e., YES/\nNO). This suggests greater visual interest in the images with\nvan den Berghe & Frost, 1986) has suggested that lighter skin is\na preferred attribute of women in many societies, and female\nskin tone changes in many ways that may explain this increase\nin attention. First, girls lighten in skin tone during adolescence\nmuch more than do boys, at a time of increasing reproductive\ncapability. Also, skin tone is a neotenous trait, that is, lighter\nskin is one of several childlike characteristics that the female\nbody seems to mimic, possibly to foster male nurturance and to\nFinally, as in Experiment 1, fixation count and regressions\nwere similar. Participants made more visual fixations on the\nupper body, most notably the breasts, the head, and the midriff.\nIn terms of visual regressions, participants regressed to the\nupper body after first viewing the images. These visual regres-\nsions are consistent with the data from Experiment 1 and\nhighlight the postautomatic response of visual interest, suggest-\ning that the reproductively relevant regions are given a higher\nrating of attractiveness. In a separate post hoc analysis, we used\nattractiveness as a predictor to determine whether participants\nwould spend more time viewing the female image rated as\nmore attractive. We found significant interactions between\nattractiveness and gaze duration, in the sense that participants\nwho rated the image as attractive had longer gaze duration time\nfor all ROIs. Additionally, attractiveness was related to longer\ntotal time spent viewing images with WHRs of 0.5, 0.8, and\n0.9. Interestingly, the image that was rated as attractive had\nmore fixation counts for all ROIs. With this analysis, we can\nspecifically show that eye movements differ as a function of\nattractiveness.\nGeneral Discussion\nThe purpose of the two experiments reported here was to\nexplore attractiveness by measuring eye movements while par-\nticipants viewed nude female images with different WHRs,\nbreast sizes, and skin tones. To our knowledge, this is one of\nthe most complete studies of attractiveness with a predomi-\nnantly Hispanic population. By using eye movements, we\ncould specifically measure visual attention in relation to WHR,\nROI, gender, and skin tone.\nBoth experiments revealed similar findings and, in addition,\nsured first fixation duration, gaze duration, total time, fixation\ncount, and visual regressions, participants were more likely to\nfocus most of their visual attention on the upper part of the\nwoman's body. This is in line with what Suschinsky et al.\n(2007) referred to as the reproductively relevant regions, par-\nticularly for men. This study also supported the theoretical\nnotion, which Singh (1993) referred to as the first pass filter,\nthat visual attention should focus on the waist (i.e., the midriff).\nAlso related to Singh's research, we found that breast size did\nplay a minor role in judging whether a female figure is attrac-\ntive; however, waist size contributed a more significant role.\nAdditionally, when looking at skin tone, we find that our results\ncorroborate Frost's extensive work on skin tone and attractive-\nness. Participants were more likely to view a female image\nlonger if the skin tone was light, rather than dark.\nThe results of both experiments add to the existing literature\non attractiveness, eye tracking, and ethnic differences. In this\nstudy, we did not see any major differences from previous\nresearch that focused primarily on European American popula-\ntions. It appears that Hispanics of Mexican American descent\nprefer low WHRs, as do other ethnicities. In addition, our\nresults indicate the importance of a more diverse selection of\ndifferences that may exist with lower WHRs. In this study,\nattractiveness ratings and total gaze time. We also found that\nbreast size was not necessarily a consistent variable in attrac-\ntiveness and visual measurements. Breast size slightly\nincreased the likelihood of rating the female image as attrac-\ntive, and yet breasts overall received most of the visual atten-\ntion. Participants focused most of their attention on smaller\nbreasts in the first experiment and on large breasts in the sec-\nond. Therefore, we cannot conclude that breast size directly\naffects either the attractiveness ratings or visual attention mea-\nsures. This is in contrast to Dixson et al.'s (2011a) study, where\nthe amount of visual attention did not differ with breast size.\nTo summarize, the results of both studies contribute three\nnew findings to the field of human attractiveness. First, attrac-\ntiveness varies over a short period of time, while one is viewing\nan image of a woman. This may indicate that the upper female\nbody is considered more attractive than the lower female body,\nas was shown in both experiments. A mental algorithm seems\nto focus attention on one physical characteristic and then on\nanother. In this sequence of events, evaluation of one charac-\nteristic has an impact on evaluation of succeeding characteris-\ntics. Interest in the midriff, as measured by first fixation\nduration, seems to function as a first pass filter that precedes\nevaluation of other characteristics, or specific regions of the\nfemale body that have been considered important in sexual\nselection. Moreover, when individuals focused on specific\nregions of the body, they tended to return to the ones they\nfocused on the most. Second, this study shows the importance\nof additional measurements (e.g., first fixation duration and\nregressions) to accurately and precisely measure attractiveness.\nEye movements provide a ``true'' measure because they reflect\nongoing mental processes in real time, whereas ratings are\ntypically ``post hoc'' processes that rely more on problem-\nsolving strategies. The rating process may misrepresent what\nparticipants actually prefer or wish, since it requires additional\nmental processes. By using eye tracking, we can specifically\nmeasure what participants are most interested in. This was\napparent in measurement of skin tone preferences: Attractive-\nness ratings did not differ overall, with the exception of gender\ndifferences, yet light-skinned images were viewed longer than\ndark-skinned images. Lastly, the results of the present study\nsuggest gender differences in terms of attraction when viewing\na female's physical structure. The overall results provide fur-\nther evidence that males favor certain regions (e.g., breasts and\nmidriff) and spend significantly more time viewing the female\nbody. Therefore, the way one views the female body is specif-\nically determined by the physical characteristics that aid in\nmate selection.\nThese findings have led to a number of suggestions for\nfuture research. Studies of WHRs and attractiveness using eye\ntracking methodology might consider a wider array of mea-\nsurements, such as those employed in the experiments\ndescribed here. In previous studies, first fixation count was\nused to measure automatic processing and thus immediate\ninterest in a specific body region. The present study shows that,\nin addition to first fixation count, first fixation duration should\nbe used as an index of immediate visual interest. In both experi-\nments, first fixation duration was a more consistent measure-\nment than first fixation count. First fixation duration can\nprovide greater insight into the amount of attention people\ndevote to a specific body region. In contrast, first fixation count\ncould indicate visual scanning, rather than degree of interest.\nWe also suggest using attractiveness as a predictor variable to\ndetermine whether people spend longer times looking at\nimages they rate as attractive than at those they rate as unat-\ntractive. This study is the first to look at these perceived dif-\nferences between viewing times and attractiveness ratings.\nFuture research might also consider whether eye tracking and\nimage rating measure different levels of attraction. It may be\nthat rating of images or figures on the traditional Likert-type\nscale would tap into erotic attraction, whereas eye tracking\nwould measure attraction in general.\nTo conclude, we would like to address the following meth-\nodological issues that might be improved for future research. In\nboth studies, there were more women than men in our sample\nsize. The reason for using both genders in the study was to\nprimarily focus on visual attention and attraction. Since the\nimage was nude, and there were differences in gender visual\nattention, it can be argued that male visual attention was\nfocused more on sexual attraction. That is, although there were\nsimilarities in visual patterns (i.e., first fixation duration, gaze\nduration, fixation count, and regressions), overall men spent\nmore time on those areas than females, supporting the evolu-\ntionary theory of mate selection. Any reference to mate selec-\ntion and reproductive relevance was distinctively associated\nwith our male sample size. Even when using more males, as\nin the second experiment, the results were similar to the first,\nand it was shown that men spent more time on images and\nspecific areas (e.g., breasts and midriff) of the body than\nwomen. Future research exploring mate selection or reproduc-\ntive relevance could focus specifically on a male population.\nAnother limitation of the present study was the stimuli that\nwere used. The image taken from Dixson et al. (2010) may not\ncapture a representative cross section of women's torsos (i.e.,\ninclude more than one image exhibiting various poses).\nResearch in this field could benefit from using different photos'\nof females, such as nude versus clothed females to compare\nwhether the pattern of visual attention is solely for nude\nfemales, or for females in general, and to experimentally\nmanipulate visual attraction versus sexual attraction, where\nclothed may represent visual attraction and nude sexual attrac-\ntion. Additionally, the experimental image used exhibited\npubic hair in the groin area of the body. Since it has become\nfashionable for women to remove pubic hair, it might have\nserved as a distracting stimulus. However, our results did not\nreveal significant fixation or attention displayed to this ROI.\nFuture research using similar stimuli might wish to consider\nremoving potentially distracting stimulus.\n"
