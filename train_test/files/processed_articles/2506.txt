Cohorts born during this time are increasingly char-\nacterized by their survivorship of poor early-life conditions, such as poor nutrition\nand infectious diseases.

Reductions in infant and child mortality during the 1930s\u00ad1960s triggered by\nthe medical and public health revolution led to dramatically increased life expectancy, but\nwithout parallel improvements in standards of living (Preston 1976). These early-life cir-\ncumstances are predicted to affect elderly health in the developing world for at least the\nnext 20\u00ad30 years (Palloni, Pinto-Aguirre, and Pelaez 2002) in the form of diseases such\nas obesity, diabetes, and heart disease, which are forecasted to increase in the developing\ncumstances of individuals born in the 1930s\u00ad1960s in any way help explain the increasing\nprevalence of these conditions among older adults in the developing world? The purpose\nof this study is to examine the evidence to answer this question by comparing the health\nmmceniry@umich.edu\n148 M. McEniry and J. McDermott\nof older adults in low- and middle-income countries born in the beginning decades of the\nPublic Health Interventions of the Early to Mid-Twentieth Century\nPublic health interventions in the developing world in the early to mid-twentieth century\nwere focused primarily on reducing infectious disease by reducing infection through san-\nitary improvements, but not direct improvements to diet and nutrition (Farley 2003; Clark\n1930), because the synergy between nutrition and infection was not fully recognized until\nlater in the century (Scrimshaw 1968). This period saw stagnant economic growth for many\ndeveloping countries (Maddison 2006), and, even though reducing infection indirectly\nimproves nutrition (Floud et al. 2011), without economic improvements, many survivors\ncontinued to be exposed to poor nutrition and poor diet, resulting, for the most part, in a\nstunted population.\nThe public health interventions of the early to mid-twentieth century in developing\ncountries initially benefited those living in urban areas because of limited coverage in\nrural areas. Although some smaller and poorer countries such as Costa Rica and Puerto\nRico implemented country-wide interventions during the 1930s (Clark 1930; Rosero-Bixby\n1990), public health interventions in other larger, present-day middle-income countries,\nsuch as Mexico, were mostly concentrated in urban areas during this period (Rodr\u00edguez\nde Romo and Rodr\u00edguez de P\u00e9rez 1998). Present-day low-income countries like China,\nIndonesia, Ghana, and India had less public health intervention coverage even in urban\nMost of the population in the developing world during this period lived in rural areas.\nIn contrast to the developed world (Preston and Haines 1991), environmental conditions\nin rural areas of the developing world during the first part of the twentieth century were\nprecarious and, for the most part, worse than those in urban areas in terms of exposure to\npoor diet and infectious diseases (Clark 1930; Rodr\u00edguez de Romo and Rodr\u00edguez de P\u00e9rez\nAs countries fully implemented public health interventions in both urban and rural\nareas, a larger population of infants and children survived. However, during the beginning\nperiod of the 1930s\u00ad1960s and prior to full country-wide implementation, increasing sur-\nvivorship affected a smaller portion of the population that included mostly those living in\nurban areas in larger countries; in only a few exceptional cases did that portion include\nthose living in both urban and rural areas in smaller countries.\nEarly-Life Mechanisms\nWhile there are several early-life mechanisms that could explain older adult health (Barker\nstances that produced unique cohorts increasingly characterized by their survival of poor\nearly-life nutrition and infectious diseases during the historical period of the 1930s\u00ad1960s\nincrease the chances of the manifestation of Barker-like effects at older ages. Low birth\nweight and stunted babies, a reflection of poor intrauterine and postgrowth growth, have an\nincreased risk of obesity, diabetes, and hypertension at older ages (Barker 1998). Further,\nthe mismatch between being born in a resource-scarce environment and then being exposed\nto a nutritionally richer environment later in life increases the risk of obesity, diabetes, and\nEarly Life Conditions, Rapid Demographic Changes, and Adult Health 149\nhypertension (Osmond and Barker 2000; Bateson et al. 2004), which in turn is associated\nwith frailty and mortality (Kuh and Ben-Shlomo 2004).\nSome developing countries experienced significant improvements in economic condi-\ntions and increased urbanization later in the twentieth century (Maddison 2006; Henderson\n2002), which might have increased access to a more enriched nutritional environment dur-\ning adulthood for the survivors of poor early-life conditions from the 1930s\u00ad1960s, espe-\ncially those living in urban areas. Diets increasingly higher in saturated fats are an important\nsource of risk to health (Popkin 2006), and the combination of poor early nutritional\nenvironment and exposure to Western-style diets could be a lethal combination. Not all eco-\nnomic growth has benefited the entire population in the developing world (L\u00f3pez-Alonso\n2007). Economic improvements largely benefiting urban dwellers may have increased\nexposure to this type of nutrition in addition to other types of exposures for urban dwellers.\nThe macro-level changes of the 1930s\u00ad1960s may elucidate a clearer manifestation of\nthe Barker-type hypothesis because cohorts are less affected by mortality-driven selection\nthan preceding cohorts as a result of public health interventions and medical technology\nbut are increasingly characterized by survivorship of poor early nutritional and infectious\ndisease environments. However, the manifestation of these macro-level changes (i.e., rapid\nchanges in mortality as a result of public health interventions and medical innovations)\nplayed out differently in various countries because of differences in the timing, pace, and\nreason for mortality decline between countries and mortality regimes. Thus, these differ-\nences may have produced cohorts with different mortality experiences that are now leading\nto different health patterns in later life (Palloni, Pinto-Aguirre, and Pelaez 2002).\nAt one extreme are developed, higher-income countries (denoted as type-A countries,\nTable 1) that experienced an earlier and more graded mortality decline at a higher standard\nof living. At the other extreme are low-income countries (type-E countries, Table 1) that\nexperienced rapid mortality decline much later in the twentieth century primarily because\nof public health interventions and medical technology. In between are developing countries\nthat experienced a mortality decline similar to that seen in the developed world (type-B\nGeneral framework for the nature of mortality decline across countries in the early to\nmid-twentieth century and expected health patterns in older adults\nCountry type A Country type E\nNature of mortality decline at birth\nEarly graded Mortality decline Late, rapid\nHigher fraction Improvements in SES Lower fraction\nSmaller fraction Public health interventions Higher fraction\nExpected health patterns in older adults\nLess Poor health Greater\nWeaker Early life conditions Stronger\nWeaker SES differentials Stronger\nLower Expected mortality risk Higher\nNotes: Country type A includes developed countries (e.g., England, The Netherlands, the\nUnited States), and country type E includes low-income countries (e.g., China, Ghana, India,\nIndonesia). In between these extremes are predominantly middle-income countries (types B\u00adD:\nCosta Rica, Mexico, South Africa), characterized by differences in the timing, pace, and reason\n150 M. McEniry and J. McDermott\ncountries) and countries that are present-day middle-income countries that experienced\nrapid improvement in life expectancy at some point during the 1930s\u00ad1960s (type-C\nand type-D countries). Differences in mortality decline among cohorts born during the\n1930s\u00ad1960s in different mortality regimes partially depend on the timing of exposure\nto the country-wide implementation of public health interventions. Thus, moving from\ncountry type A to country type E as country-wide public health interventions are fully\nimplemented in both urban and rural areas implies moving toward countries with cohorts\nincreasingly characterized by their survivorship of poor early-life conditions and the\neffects of these conditions in older adulthood, including higher fragility, stronger effects\nof childhood conditions on health, sharper socioeconomic status (SES) inequalities, and\nincreasing mortality risk.\nWhile most of the mortality change during the period of the 1930s\u00ad1960s occurred after\nnot all reached older ages (60+), and thus it is too early to fully examine those born in the\nmid-1940s through the 1960s. Nevertheless, recent evidence suggests that poor early-life\nconditions are, in part, associated with high levels of disease and disability and reduction\nin life expectancy at older ages in the unique cohorts from the beginning part of the 1930s\u00ad\n1960s (Palloni and Souza 2013). Cohorts from settings such as country types C and D (now\npredominantly middle-income countries) in some regions of the world are now experienc-\ning an increasing prevalence of chronic conditions (Palloni et al. 2005), and evidence sug-\ngests the importance of early-life nutritional environments and diabetes prevalence among\nthose countries undergoing demographic changes at the beginning of the period (McEniry\n2014). The reported prevalence of diabetes in type-C and type-D countries is higher than\nwhat has appeared historically in developed countries (Garc\u00eda-Palmieri et al. 1970; Gordon\nThus, examining the cohorts born in the late 1920s through the mid-1940s who are\nexperiencing an increasing prevalence of chronic conditions at older ages is a relevant\nstarting point to examine the conjecture regarding the demographic changes of the 1930s\u00ad\n1960s. It may be possible to reach conclusions regarding the long-term consequences of\ndemographic change in some now-middle-income countries, especially among those most\nlikely to have benefited from improving environmental conditions--those urban-born older\nadults exposed to poor nutrition and infectious diseases in large, now-middle-income coun-\ntries or those rural-born older adults in those smaller countries with country-wide public\nThis Study\nIn this study we examine the degree to which the prevalence and likelihood of chronic\nconditions are related to the demographic changes of the 1930s\u00ad1960s. We focus on\nadult obesity, diabetes, and hypertension--conditions known to originate in early life\n(Barker 1998)--and select two groups of older adults born in the beginning part of the\n1930s\u00ad1960s period. The first group experienced increased survivorship of poor early-\nlife conditions (individuals in now predominantly middle-income countries--Costa Rica,\nMexico, South Africa, type-C and type-D countries), and the second group experienced\nvery harsh environmental conditions in early life, with little decline in mortality (individuals\nin China, Ghana, India, Indonesia, type-E countries, low-income countries). Using a\nEarly Life Conditions, Rapid Demographic Changes, and Adult Health 151\nrecently compiled cross-national dataset of older adults, we use two measures of early life\ncommon to many surveys of older adults, rural/urban birthplace and height, to examine the\nmerit of the conjecture. Using the general framework of Table 1, we expect to observe a\n(1) higher prevalence and likelihood of older adult obesity, diabetes, and hypertension; and\n(2) stronger effects of early-life conditions (birthplace, low height) on these health condi-\ntions in older adults born in now-middle-income countries compared with those born in\nlow-income countries. The stronger effects of early-life conditions should be more appar-\nent for those most at risk--the most vulnerable population in now-middle-income countries\nwho experienced increasing survivorship in the 1930s\u00ad1940s. In terms of birthplace, this\npopulation includes those born in rural areas in the smaller type-C countries where cover-\nage of public health interventions extended into rural areas in the 1930s\u00ad1940s and those in\nurban areas for larger type-C and type-D countries where coverage of public health inter-\nventions had not yet reached full implementation in rural areas. In terms of height, this\npopulation is composed of shorter older adults.\nData and Methods\nData\nThe data to compare the health of older adults in low- and middle-income countries were\ndrawn from a subset of the recently compiled Research on Early Life and Aging Trends\nand Effects (RELATE) database, which contains harmonized cross-sectional and panel\ndata from major surveys of 147,278 older adults or households in 20 countries in Latin\nAmerica, Asia, Africa, the United States, England, and The Netherlands (RELATE 2013).\nThese studies are based on probability sampling and are representative of the older adult\npopulation either nationally or in major country provinces. All studies had good interviewer\ntraining, good questionnaire design, concern for data quality, and high response rates. The\nRELATE data were harmonized where possible to make cross-national comparisons across\nsurveys possible (McEniry, Moen, and McDermott 2013).\nThe subset of RELATE data used for this study draws from seven surveys\n(n = 16,836) of low- and middle-income countries, including the Costa Rican Study of\nLongevity and Healthy Aging (CRELES); the Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS); and\nthe WHO Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health Study (SAGE) from Mexico, China,\nGhana, India, and South Africa. We included the SAGE survey because it has cross-national\ndata on low- and middle-income countries, uses similar sample designs and questionnaire\nconstruction, and is representative at a country level in some instances.\nMeasures\nEarly-Life Conditions. Rural birthplace was used as an indicator of precarious environmen-\ntal conditions in early life (exposure to poor nutrition and infectious diseases) and was\ndefined according to questions asked of respondents regarding their birthplace and resi-\ndence during childhood. Height was used as a marker of net nutritional status, reflecting\nthe impact of childhood nutrition and disease (Floud et al. 2011), and we used the lowest\nquartile of adult height in the overall population to indicate stunting. For older adults born\nat the beginning of the 1930s\u00ad1960s period, the seven selected countries fell into two broad\ngroups of mortality regimes at birth characterized by: (1) declining mortality and increased\nsurvivorship of poor early-life conditions as a result of public health interventions (Costa\nRica, Mexico, South Africa) (Rosero-Bixby 1990; Rodr\u00edguez de Romo and Rodr\u00edguez de\n152 M. McEniry and J. McDermott\ninfant and child mortality (China, Ghana, India, Indonesia) (Banister 1987; Patterson 1981;\nAdult Health. Obesity, diabetes, and hypertension were of particular interest because they\nare known to originate in early life as a result of poor nutrition and/or the synergy with poor\nnutrition and infectious diseases (Barker 1998). Obesity was calculated using measured\nheight and weight. A body mass index of  30 identified obese individuals (1 = obese,\n0 = not obese). Elderly diabetes was defined by dichotomous variables (1 = diabetic,\n0 = not diabetic) from self-reports that were based on questions asked of the respondent\nabout whether a doctor had ever diagnosed them with diabetes. Although self-reports for\ndiabetes have shown validity in some settings (Banks et al. 2006; Brenes 2008; Goldman\net al. 2003), there is a strong likelihood that diabetes is severely underreported in some\ndeveloping countries, especially among those with limited access to quality health care.\nWhile biomarkers are preferable for the measurement of diabetes, biomarkers were not yet\npublicly available at the time of most of the selected studies. Hypertension was defined as\na dichotomous variable (1 = hypertensive, 0 = not hypertensive) using criteria described\nin the literature (Yan et al. 2012). Hypertensive respondents showed systolic rates of \n140 mmHg, diastolic rates of  90 mmHg, or reported that they were taking medication to\ncontrol hypertension.\nOther Variables.All statistical models controlled for age, gender, years of education, visits\nto a doctor, and current residence. Current residence was defined to be either rural (1) or\nurban (0). The visits to a doctor variable reflects, in part, preventive health care behaviour,\nand it was defined as a dichotomous variable to reflect at least one visit to a doctor within\nthe last year.\nSample Selection.We selected older adults who were born in the late 1920s to the early\n1940s and had participated in those studies that had measured blood pressure, obesity using\nmeasured height and weight, and self-reported diabetes in addition to childhood variables\n(rural birthplace, height). Imputation methods using Stata were used to address missing\nvalues (Raghunathan, Reiter, and Rubin 2003).\nAnalyses\nMultivariate models using pooled country data for all seven countries and for SAGE coun-\ntries only were estimated to examine the likelihood of older adult obesity, diabetes, or\nhypertension as a function of country and other predictor variables. Likelihood ratio tests\nwere conducted comparing constrained and unconstrained models to determine the impor-\ntance of including country dummy variables in models. Interaction terms between countries\nand birthplace and countries and low height were included in models to examine the likeli-\nhood of disease for those most at risk of manifesting the effects of poor early-life conditions\nbetween low- and middle-income countries. Predicted probabilities for pooled models were\ncalculated and compared between countries using average responses on model variables.\nBefore pooling the data, country-specific models were estimated and associations\nbetween predictor variables and adult health compared to ensure comparability regarding\nthe direction of associations across the different countries. We also compared country-\nspecific models and pooled results using weighted and nonweighted models for only the\nSAGE countries because SAGE countries had similar sample designs and questionnaire\nconstruction. There were few differences noted between models with and without sample\nEarly Life Conditions, Rapid Demographic Changes, and Adult Health 153\nweights. Similarly, there were few differences noted between models using all seven coun-\ntries versus only SAGE countries. Thus, reported results are based on nonweighted models.\nResults\nSample Characteristics\nDemographic and health characteristics of older adults born in the late 1920s to the early\n1940s reveal a population of older adults who share some similarities but also exhibit dif-\nferences in early-life conditions and who differ in terms of adult health patterns, health\nsystems use, and changes in residence from rural to urban settings (Table 2). Across coun-\ntries, there were lower levels of formal education achieved both for the respondent and for\nparents, with particularly low parental education seen in Ghana and China. Average height\nfor both males and females was similar across countries and suggests a stunted popula-\ntion. Being rural-born was fairly disparate across countries in that, with the exception of\nCosta Rica, a higher percentage of respondents were born in rural areas in the low-income\ncountries as compared with middle income countries. Comparing rural birthplace with rural\nresidence suggests country differences in migration from rural to urban areas, particularly\nfor Costa Rican adults, among whom 72 percent were born rural but only 38 percent cur-\nrently resided in rural areas. A higher prevalence of obesity and diabetes was particularly\nnotable in the middle-income countries; the highest prevalence of obesity but lowest preva-\nlence of diabetes among middle-income countries occurred in South Africa. The prevalence\nof hypertension in the middle-income countries was slightly higher than in the low-income\ncountries. The percentage of respondents who visited a medical doctor within the last year\nwas highest in middle-income countries like Costa Rica and was lowest in Indonesia.\nCountry Effects and Early-Life Effects\nFor obesity, a likelihood ratio test comparing models with and without country dummy\nvariables indicated significant country differences in predicting obesity (2 (6) = 1894.02,\np = 0.000). The likelihood of being obese was much higher in the middle-income coun-\nacross all SAGE countries, there was a higher likelihood of obesity for shorter individuals\nshowed a significantly reduced odds for those currently living in rural areas (OR 0.64, 95%\nCI = 0.52\u00ad0.79). Similar results appeared for models using all seven countries (Appendix\nA). The odds of obesity increased slightly with increased level of education (OR 1.03,\n95% CI = 1.02\u00ad1.05). There were no significant country interactions with height and an\ninconsistent pattern of country interactions for residence (results not shown). Predicted\nprobabilities for obesity using only SAGE countries (Model 2) showed strong country dif-\nferences between low- and middle-income countries. The predicted probability of being\n0.07 in Ghana, and 0.03 in India (Figure 1).

Expectations for a higher prevalence and likelihood of chronic conditions and\nstronger early-life effects on adult health among older adults born at the beginning of this\nperiod and in now-middle-income countries (country types C and D) were partially met for\nobesity and diabetes. We found a higher prevalence of obesity and diabetes in older adults\nborn in middle-income countries but no large differences in hypertension (measured) and\na higher likelihood of being obese, diabetic, and hypertensive in some selected middle-\nincome countries. There was no strong evidence of stronger effects of early-life conditions\nin the middle-income countries, and urban residence was more predictive of disease than\nwas urban birthplace. However, overall, being short and living in urban areas increased the\nlikelihood of being obese, and shorter individuals from middle-income countries showed\na higher probability of being obese. While these broad patterns in the data suggest the\nModels predicting diabetes and hypertension\nDiabetes Hypertension\nSmoking\nCountry\nMiddle income\nLow income\nEarly Life Conditions, Rapid Demographic Changes, and Adult Health 159\noverall importance of early-life conditions in predicting obesity in both low- and middle-\nincome countries, there is insufficient evidence using available data to make a strong\nclaim that the demographic changes of the 1930s\u00ad1960s and increasing survivorship of\npoor early-life conditions explain the notable higher prevalence of obesity and diabetes in\nmiddle-income countries in the cohort of older adults born in the beginning period of the\nA few additional results merit further discussion. First, the results show important\ndifferences between countries in disease patterns, especially concerning obesity. These dif-\nferences suggest different determinants of older adult health, whether they be a result of\nmacro-level events or stem from population differences. The higher prevalence of obesity\nand diabetes in middle-income countries is not surprising given that mortality resulting\nfrom diabetes has been increasing in some middle-income countries (Palloni et al. 2005).\nThe higher prevalence of self-reported diabetes is higher than the prevalence of diabetes\namong present-day older adults and older adults several decades ago in the developed\n1998; Wilkerson and Krall 1947). A high prevalence of conditions such as hypertension\nhas been found in urban areas (Ibrahim and Damasceno 2012). Given that studies show\nincreasing prevalence of these chronic conditions even in low-income countries (Hossain,\nLloyd-Sherlock et al. 2014; Gao et al. 2013; M\u00e9ndez-Chac\u00f3n, Santamar\u00eda-Ulloa, and\nRosero-Bixby 2008), differences in the timing and development of disease as shown in\nthis study remain an important consideration in understanding its determinants.\nSecond, the results indicate the overall importance of poor early-life conditions for\nadult obesity. Height is a marker of net nutritional status, and problems in intrauterine\ngrowth, resulting from either poor nutrition or infectious diseases, lead to low birth weight\nbabies and stunting (Barker 1998; Crimmins and Finch 2006), with an increased risk of\nobesity and other conditions later in life. All seven countries in this study had very low\ntious disease environments for most of the population. These types of conditions in early\nalso increase the risk of poor adult health (Almond and Currie 2010; Crimmins and Finch\nThird, the results indicating the importance of urban residence are not surprising given\nthat trends in the developing world show a higher prevalence of chronic conditions in urban\nsettings among older adults (e.g., Lloyd-Sherlock et al. 2014). However, that urban dwellers\nand shorter individuals are more at risk for obesity suggests the merit of early-life theories\nthat stress the possible mismatch between being born in impoverished nutritional condi-\ntions and being exposed to a more nutritionally rich environment later in life (Barker 1998;\nSchmidhuber and Shetty 2005). All of the selected middle-income countries were very poor\nin the 1930s\u00ad1940s. Developing countries such as Costa Rica, China, and Indonesia expe-\nrienced rapid economic growth during the adulthood of the cohort examined. Economic\ngrowth may have benefited urban dwellers more, potentially improving diet but also poten-\ntially increasing exposure to a more Western-style diet high in saturated fats. All developing\ncountries in this study have seen an increase in caloric intake (FAO 1946; FAO 2010), but\nexposure to a more Western-style diet in adulthood may be more likely in urban areas.\nExposure to this kind of diet may partially explain results (Popkin, Horton, and Kim 2001),\nand the combination of poor conditions during a critical early period with nutritional and\nlifestyle changes in later life might be a lethal combination for some older adults.\n160 M. McEniry and J. McDermott\nFourth, the inconclusive result regarding the possible macro-level explanation for the\nnoted differences in the cohorts of the 1930s\u00ad1940s--namely, the long-term consequences\nof demographic changes of the 1930s\u00ad1960s primarily as a result of country-wide public\nhealth interventions without parallel improvement in diet and nutrition--does not negate its\nimportance for potentially explaining differences in disease. However, it may be too early\nto fully explore the merits of this explanation. Although smaller countries were experienc-\ning country-wide public health interventions with consequent improvements in mortality in\nwere occurring in urban areas in the larger present-day middle-income countries (Rodr\u00edguez\nde Romo and Rodr\u00edguez de P\u00e9rez 1998), the full impact of these demographic changes may\nnot have occurred until after 1945 with the introduction of antibiotics and with complete\ncountry-wide implementation of public health interventions in the larger countries. Fully\nimplemented public health interventions would have resulted in increasing survivorship of\nthe more vulnerable portion of the population, namely, those living in rural areas, result-\ning in sharp contrasts in adult health between vulnerable members of the population and\neveryone else.\nThe results showing that increased years of education was associated with higher like-\nlihood for obesity and diabetes suggests a possible reversal of expected patterns of health\nas described in other studies (Monteiro et al. 2004). However, the effects of low height\nwere much stronger for obesity. Given that obesity is a strong predictor of adult diabetes\nand hypertension, the results for obesity may be a precursor to what we will observe with\ndiabetes and hypertension as countries undergo complete transitions. Thus, while the com-\nparisons among older adults born in the 1930s\u00ad1940s provide a hazy glimpse at the impact\nof macro-level events, the question remains as to whether the results foreshadow in any\nway the health of cohorts of older adults born later in the period--the 1940s\u00ad1960s--in\nlow-income countries.\nThere are a number of other possibilities that explain the weaker results for dia-\nbetes and hypertension. Although self-reports for diabetes show validity in some settings\nusing self-reports is undoubtedly problematic in the developing world, where access to\ngood medical care and diagnostic tests is not widespread. Those who are shorter are\nmore likely to also be poorer, with less access to these services. Additionally, there are\nundoubtedly large differences in health care infrastructure and urbanicity between low-\nand middle-income countries, with middle-income countries having a stronger health\ncare infrastructure and a larger proportion of the population living in urban areas where\nolder adults would be more likely to receive quality care and proper diagnosis of dia-\nbetes. In this study, low-income countries such as Ghana, India, and Indonesia indeed\nshowed higher percentages of respondents living in rural areas. Even though we exam-\nined urban residents only, existing differences in health care infrastructure could have\nresulted in more severe underestimation in low-income countries. If we also consider\nthat these differences are most likely to be correlated with mortality regimes and eco-\nnomic growth and development, we must conclude that this cross-national analysis between\nlow- and middle-income countries using self-reported diabetes must be subject to cautious\ninterpretation.\nThe weaker results for hypertension are surprising in that several studies have shown\nstrong associations between low birth weight, infant mortality rate, poor SES, and adult\nMcGovern 2012). However, similar results obtained for height and diabetes suggest that the\npathway from stunting to diabetes and hypertension may operate mainly through obesity\nEarly Life Conditions, Rapid Demographic Changes, and Adult Health 161\n(Popkin, Horton, and Kim 2001). Thus, height may not be the best measure to sufficiently\ncapture associations with adult diabetes and hypertension.\nThe study shows large differences among countries in terms of moving from rural\nto urban residences at some time during the life course. However, complete information\nabout migration is limited in some surveys of older adults, making it harder to deter-\nmine the effects of this migration. It was also not possible to observe on an individual\nlevel factors that may have mitigated the effects of poor early-life conditions, such as eco-\nnomic growth or factors that may have either compounded their effects or played a larger\nrole in explaining adult health, such as diet. Rapid economic growth may help explain\nadult health for those exposed to poor early-life conditions (Steckel 2013), but speed of\neconomic growth during adulthood might not be as important as who benefits from eco-\nnomic growth. Not all economic growth in the developing world has benefited the entire\npopulation (L\u00f3pez-Alonso 2007). There is little information on individual diet during child-\nhood or adulthood of older adult respondents in population-based studies, and diets differ\ntremendously between Latin America and Asia, making the interpretation of the results less\nclear in determining the relative importance of early life versus events such as the nutrition\ntransition to a diet higher in saturated fat.\nAdditionally, the nature of the study prohibits the possibility of disentangling precise\nmechanisms in early life associated with older adult health because there is a complex\nsynergy between nutrition and infection (Scrimshaw 1968). Birthplace is a broad measure\nthat might also reflect epidemiological differences between rural and urban settings. Height\ncould also be problematic given the imprecision of the lowest quartile of height as a mea-\nsure of stunting and lost height at older ages. Some of the SAGE countries are representative\nof a particular province or region but not the country as a whole. Mexico and South Africa\nmay be special cases, although there is evidence of increasing prevalence of these chronic\nconditions, especially in the Latin American region (Palloni, Pinto-Aguirre, and Pelaez\n2002). The comparison by mortality regimes is based on analyses of historical mortality\ndata from the early twentieth century (McEniry 2014), but these broadly defined mortal-\nity regimes may need refinement. Although we conducted analyses to show the similar\ndirection of associations between predictors and health outcomes by country, the estimated\nmodels make an important assumption that countries can be pooled together.\nIn spite of the study limitations, the topic of early-life conditions and older adult health\nin the developing world remains important, and individual-level survey data of older adults\nare one of the better sources of data that we have to examine the topic. Even though the\nexamination of trends in health in the developing world is complex, cross-national compar-\nisons provide insight into health patterns and their determinants (National Research Council\n2001). Rapid changes affecting developing countries and evidence from the middle-income\ncountries pose relevant questions about the long-term consequences of macro-level events\non health at older ages. Further examination of those born in the late 1940s\u00ad1960s will be\nessential to more fully examine if these questions have merit.\n"
