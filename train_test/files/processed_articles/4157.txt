These basic emotional expressions appear to be consistent\nacross cultures and even other mammalian species (Darwin, 1872). Infants are able to\ndetect emotional faces very early in life, followed closely by the ability to categorize mere\nAttention to emotional faces in children\nmonths after birth (Montague and Walker-Andrews, 2001; Nelson, 2001). It has been\nproposed that the early ability to detect emotional faces may serve as an evolutionarily\nadaptive function to facilitate social interaction and threat avoidance and thus enhance an\nindividual's likelihood of survival (Vaish, Grossmann, and Woodward, 2008). In particular,\nthe tendency to automatically direct internal visual processing resources (i.e., enhancement\nof visual signal relative to background noise) to the location in visual space of others'\nemotional cues provides an individual with nonverbal insight into others' affective states.\nThis unintentional modulation of internal visual processing resources is referred to\nas covert spatial attention. Spatial attention to emotional faces is predicated on basic visual\nattention abilities such as visual alertness, spatial orienting, and attention to object features\nwhich develop during the first six months of life (Colombo, 2001). Sustained visual\nattention emerges later, from six months to three years of age, as greater cognitive\nresources develop (Colombo, 2001). These abilities develop in the context of emotional\nstimuli, particularly human faces. Infants display a partiality for faces that appears very\nearly in life, as infants preferentially orient to faces within several hours of birth (Nelson,\n2001). After only a few months, four-month-old infants reveal preferential biases in gaze to\nemotional facial expressions (Montague and Walker-Andrews, 2001) and infants less than a\nyear old are able to discriminate emotional facial expressions including happiness\n(Bornstein and Arterberry, 2003) and anger (Serrano, Iglesias, and Loeches, 1995).\nInterestingly, young infants tend to allocate greater attention to happy expressions very\nearly in life, which transitions to negative faces later in the first year of life (Vaish et al.,\n14-month-old infants preferentially look more quickly at angry (but not fearful) faces\ncompared to happy expressions. This transition likely serves an important evolutionary\nattachment purpose where it is critical for younger (immobile and completely dependent)\ninfants to attend to positive cues for acquiring resources, whereas for older (more mobile)\ninfants the need and ability to avoid potential harm becomes more important.\nAcross early childhood, visual attention and facial cues become increasingly\nintegrated as visual-emotional stimuli in the environment are used for social referencing\nand children have been shown to preferentially direct their gaze toward emotional faces\n(Bornstein and Arterberry, 2003; Montague and Walker-Andrews, 2001; Serrano et al.,\n1995; Vaish et al., 2008). Relatedly, recent research suggests that more peripheral and\neffortful behavioral measures such as hand-initiated responses to task-relevant stimuli are\nfacilitated by enhanced attention to threatening (i.e., fearful and angry faces) compared to\nhappy faces in five-year-old children (LoBue, 2009) as well as other threatening stimuli\nsuch as snakes, as young as three years old (LoBue and DeLoache, 2008). In contrast to\nthis, by nine years of age, spatial attention is preferentially directed to both positive and\nnegative emotional stimuli when compared to a neutral baseline (Waters, Lipp, and Spence,\n2004), with anxious children attending more to threat-related stimuli (Puliafico and\nPourtois, Grandjean, Sander, and Vuilleumier, 2004) and children (Puliafico and Kendall,\n2006; Waters et al., 2004) has indicated that emotional facial expressions (especially those\nexpressing fear) capture spatial attention. In adults, it has been proposed that regardless of\nAttention to emotional faces in children\nvalence, both rewarding and threatening stimuli, such as infant faces vs. snakes, capture\nspatial attention due to their high biological significance (Brosch, Sander, and Scherer,\n2007). Yet, there is little research (i.e., LoBue, 2009) on emotional face-elicited spatial\nattention in younger children, with many unanswered questions remaining. For example,\nalthough fearful faces have been shown to preferentially capture attention relative to happy\nfaces (LoBue, 2009), it is unclear whether or not other emotional expressions such as happy\nfaces capture attention relative to neutral faces. Additionally, prior affective attention\nresearch in younger children has primarily utilized the visual search task where participants\nare explicitly instructed to find a target face (e.g., happy or fearful) amongst distracter faces\nwith expressions incongruent to the target face. Therefore, in the visual search task\nemotional facial expressions are task relevant and it remains unclear to what extent\nemotional faces may facilitate attention in task-irrelevant contexts (e.g., the dot-probe task).\nIn a recent review (Iarocci, Yager, and Elfers, 2007) it was suggested that\nbehavioral genetic research can help address questions of social development using facial\nand emotional recognition. At present, it remains unclear to what extent genes influence\nshifts in attention to emotional faces in young children. However, some twin research has\nexamined the genetic influence on facial and emotional processing. Previous twin studies\nhave found heritability estimates on general reaction time and speed of information\nprocessing that ranged from .11 to .61 in both adults (Neubauer, Spinath, Riemann,\nAngleitner, and Borkenau, 2000) and infants (DiLalla, Fulker, and Thompson, 1989). A\nrecent ERP study on adolescent twins found significant heritability in the neural response\nof processing facial affect, ranging from .36 to .64 (Anokhin, Golosheykin, and Heath,\n2010). A recent review of emerging twin literature has also concluded there to be a `strong\nrole for nature in face (identity) recognition' wherein a unique genetic influence was found\nfor face-specific processes over and above simple visual (non-face) and verbal recognition\n(McKone and Palermo, 2010, p. 1). In addition, recent neuroimaging twin studies have\nreported genetic influences for adult face processing in the ventral visual cortex (Polk,\nPark, Smith, and Park, 2007) and amygdala (Wolfensberger, Veltman, Hoogendijk,\nBoomsma, and de Geus, 2008). Also, genetic influences in adult twin attention and\nemotional processing have been associated with anterior cingulate activity and genetic\ninfluence on incongruent trials over congruent trials (h2 = .37; Matthews et al., 2007).\nFinally, selective attention has been found to be genetically influenced in children across\nsuggest that genetics influence aspects of emotion, face, and attention processing, it\nremains unclear what role genes might play in mediating an integrated attentional response\nto spatially distinct emotional faces and at what point in development this behavior first\nmanifests.\nThe primary aim of the current study was to test the spatial attention eliciting\nproperties of fearful and happy facial expressions in five-year-old children. A secondary\naim was to assess a potential genetic influence on fearful and happy face-elicited spatial\nattention using twins. Five-year-old twins performed a dot-probe task (e.g., Mogg and\nBradley, 1999) with happy and fearful face cues. It was hypothesized that emotional facial\nexpressions would capture spatial attention in five-year-old children. Five-year-old children\nwere included for two reasons. (1) There is a relative dearth of research on spatial attention\nAttention to emotional faces in children\nin early childhood, and (2) this age represents the earliest point at which children can\ncompetently perform a complex dot-probe computer task, not possible at younger ages. If\nfearful and happy facial expressions draw spatial attention to their location (relative to the\nlocation of competing neutral faces), then one would expect faster reaction times to targets\nthat follow emotional (rather than neutral) faces. Additionally, we conducted preliminary\nbehavior genetic analyses on our small sample to begin to examine whether this behavior\nwould be mediated by a genetic component, which would be revealed by more similar\nemotional face-elicited attentional biases in monozygotic (MZ), compared to dizygotic\n(DZ), twins.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nTwins were recruited as part of the Southern Illinois Twins and Siblings Study\n(SITSS; DiLalla, 2002). Families initially were located through a variety of methods,\nincluding newspaper birth announcements, references from other twin families, the\nMothers of Twins Club, and through invitations to twins found in the community.\nTen twin pairs and one set of triplets were brought to the lab for testing at age 5\nyears. All children were tested within one month of their 5th birthday to increase similarity\nin developmental age. One twin child was dropped from overall analyses due to fussing and\nunwillingness to perform the dot-probe task, and thus this twin pair was dropped from\ngenetic analyses. This resulted in 22 individuals, 11 male and 11 female, for the primary,\nnon-twin analyses. For exploratory genetic analyses 12 pairings of twins were used (triplets\nyielded one MZ pair and two DZ pairs) composed of five MZ pairs, who share 100% of\ntheir genetic profile, and seven DZ pairs, who share on average 50% of their genetic\nprofile. Parents' consent was obtained prior to testing and buccal cell collection. Buccal\ncells were used to confirm twin zygosity. Handedness was assessed by asking children\nwhich hand they used most often to color with (14 right handed, 8 left handed). Children\nwere treated in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Review Board. Families\nwere paid $50 for participation and each child was given approximately $10 in toys to\nthank them for participating.\nStimuli and procedure\nFamilies initially were contacted by letter with information regarding the present\nstudy. Appointments were scheduled at the family's convenience to facilitate testing and to\naccommodate children's daily routines. On the day of the visit, the family was escorted to\nthe testing room where the twins were first introduced to the testing area. After becoming\nfamiliar with the lab, one twin was brought to a separate testing room containing a\ncomputer where the spatial attention task was administered. After completion of the task\nthe first twin was escorted back to the main lab and the second twin was brought to the\ntesting room to complete the spatial attention task. Both twins were always tested on the\nsame day.\nFour (two male and two female) gray scale facial identities of fearful, happy, and\nneutral 3D faces (Gur et al., 2002) were used in the dot-probe task. A cartoon character,\nAttention to emotional faces in children\n\"Star Man,\" was created and used as the target stimulus. Stimuli were presented on a 60 Hz\n16\" computer monitor. Children were initially seated 40 cm from the screen. As displayed\nin Figure 1, each trial started with a white fixation cue (+) that children were told to focus\non throughout the experiment, centered on a black background for 1000 ms. Two face\npresented (500 ms) to the left and right of fixation. After presentation of these faces, the\ntarget Star Man (4.29 \u00d7 5.71\u00b0 of visual angle) was presented in the location of either the left\nor the right face. If children shifted very much in their sitting position, attempts were made\nto return them to their initial position.\nThe children's task was to indicate the location of Star Man as quickly as possible\nby using a computer keyboard. Participants used their right index finger on the bottom right\nenter button to indicate that the target occurred on the right side of the screen and left index\nfinger on the spacebar to indicate that the target occurred on the left side of the screen. Star\nMan remained on the screen until the participant responded. The fixation cue remained in\nthe center of the screen throughout each trial. In an attempt to measure emotional face-\nelicited covert shifts in spatial attention, children were instructed to always fixate on this\ncue (see Figure 1). The study consisted of two blocks of 64 trials. Trials consisted of one\nemotional (fearful or happy) and one neutral face, which were half congruent (Star Man\npresented on the same side of the screen as the emotional face) and half incongruent (Star\nMan presented on the same side as the neutral face with the emotional face on the opposite\nside).\nFigure 1. An example of a LVF (left visual field) congruent trial\nNote: Each trial started with a fixation cue, which was followed by two bilateral face cues. Face cues\ncontained one emotional (fearful or happy) and one neutral face, with the emotional face occurring in the\nLVF or RVF (right visual field). These faces were immediately followed by the target star man, which\nrandomly occurred in either the LVF or RVF. Children responded to the location of the Star Man as quickly\nas possible.\nAttention to emotional faces in children\nVariations of the dot-probe task have been used in numerous studies of spatial\nattention (see Yiend, 2010). The dot-probe task is thought to measure an individual's\nattentional bias to a certain stimulus, in this case emotional faces, which should facilitate\nfaster responses on congruent relative to incongruent trials. That is, if emotional facial\nexpressions automatically or exogenously draw spatial attention to their location, then\nchildren should respond faster to congruent rather than incongruent trials. Given that all\ntrials contained one emotional and one neutral facial expression and these faces were task\nirrelevant, differences between congruent and incongruent trials should reflect exogenous\nemotion-elicited spatial attention rather than endogenous (or any other type) of attention.\nAdditionally, given that the target Star Man occurred with equal probability (i.e., 50%) at\neither spatially congruent or incongruent locations, attentional shifts cannot be attributed to\nlearned associations between facial cues and targets. Given that attentional capture in this\ntask is defined as the difference in reaction times between two conditions (i.e., congruent\nand incongruent) and that the facial cues are task irrelevant, differences in attentional\ncapture cannot be attributed to general measures such as speed of information processing.\nDifferences in congruent and incongruent reaction times are thought to represent an overall\nmeasure of attentional capture that includes both the initial orienting of attention to the\nemotional face and the disengagement of attention from the emotional face (i.e., on\nincongruent trials; see Carlson and Reinke, 2008, and Koster, Crombez, Verschuere, and\nDe Houwer, 2004 for methods on disentangling these different effects).\nResults\nOverall dot-probe analyses\nFor reaction time (RT) analyses, only correct responses between 150 ms and 2000\nms were used (82% of the original data). Trials with reaction times less than 150 ms or\nmore than 2000 ms were discarded to eliminate premature and delayed responses not\nassociated with the participant's initial allocation of attention. Incorrect responses\naccounted for 12% and premature and delayed responses accounted for 7% of trials. A 2\n(visual field: left vs. right) \u00d7 2 (congruency: congruent vs. incongruent) \u00d7 2 (valence:\nfearful vs. happy) repeated measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was conducted on\nparticipants' RTs to the target Star Man. Sex and handedness were included as between-\nsubjects factors. The interaction between visual field and congruency was significant,\n2 = .37. Within the right visual field (RVF), congruent trials (M\nleft visual field (LVF), congruent trials (M = 967.68 ms) did not significantly differ from\nincongruent trials (M = 948.98 ms). The main effect for congruency approached\nsignificance, with faster reaction times for congruent (M = 939.09 ms) relative to\nvisual field, valence, sex, and handedness were not significant (F's < 1). No other\ninteraction effects were found to be significant (F's < 1).\nExploratory genetic analyses on spatial attention and general information processing\nThe potential for genetic influences was tested by comparing reaction times for MZ\nAttention to emotional faces in children\nversus DZ twins. To test for a genetic influence on spatial attention to emotional faces,\ndifference scores were calculated for each twin pair's attention index. First, the attention\nindex was calculated for each child as the difference between congruent and incongruent\nRTs. Whereas RTs for congruent trials represent the facilitated processing of targets at the\nsite of attentional capture, RTs for incongruent targets represent the cost of processing\ntargets outside the site of attentional capture. The difference between these trials (i.e., the\nattention index) is an established measure of overall attentional capture (Koster et al.,\nTo assess how similarly both twins' attention was captured by emotional faces,\nattention-related twin differences (ARTD) were calculated as the absolute difference\nbetween the twins' attention indices. Smaller ARTDs indicate more similarity between\ntwins. An independent samples t-test (t(10) = 2.72, p < .05) revealed that MZ (ARTD =\n20.57 ms, SD = 27.20) twin pairs had significantly more similar patterns of attentional\nsuggests that directing spatial attention to emotional faces is mediated by genetic\ninfluences. In addition, MZ twins demonstrated greater similarity on the attention index\nwith an intraclass correlation of .22 (p = ns) whereas a DZ twin correlation of .02 (p = ns)\nwas found. Based on Falconer and MacKay's (1966) formula, a rough estimate of\nheritability can be calculated of twice the difference between MZ and DZ twin correlations\n(h2 = 2(rMZ - rDZ)), yielding an estimate of .40. It should be noted that this estimate is\npreliminary given the non-significance of the correlations and small sample size. Because it\nis larger than the MZ correlation, it is appropriate to consider the MZ correlation of .22 as a\ncloser estimate. However, these results do indicate the presence of a genetic influence on\nallocation of attention in spatial responding to emotional events. Importantly, our\npreliminary finding of a genetic contribution on emotion-elicited spatial attention cannot be\nattributed to the already established genetic contribution to speed of information processing\nas these more general effects should be present across (but not between) conditions in the\ndot-probe task. The genetic effect reported here is measured by a condition-specific\ndifference between congruent and incongruent trials (i.e., the attention index). Next we\nexplored the genetic influence on general information processing.\nWithin-pair differences were compared for MZ versus DZ twins in a one-way\nMANOVA for each trial type (mean response, overall attentional index, LVF attention\nindex, RVF attention index, LVF emotion, RVF emotion, congruent, incongruent, happy,\nfearful) to determine if there were differences between trial types and twin type on RTs\n(see Table 1). In all trial types we found that MZ twins' reaction times were more similar\nthan DZ twins'. These differences were significantly different in all trials except RVF\nemotion and RVF attention index. Thus, across a variety of trial types RTs were more\nsimilar for MZ than DZ twins, which indicates that information processing in general was\ninfluenced by genetics. Additionally, consistent with the ARTD results reported above, a\nsignificant mean difference was found for the overall attentional index, as well as the LVF\nattention index, but not RVF attention index. In summary, these differences support the\npossible presence of genetic influences on general information and spatial attention\nprocessing. However, these genetic influences bear replication as this aspect of the study is\npreliminary and used a small sample for twin analyses.\nAttention to emotional faces in children\nTable 1. Within pair differences for MZ and DZ subjects mean reaction times by trial type\nin milliseconds\nMean Difference (SD)\nDiscussion\nOur results provide the first evidence that 5-year-old children preferentially allocate\nspatial attention to happy and fearful faces, especially those in the right visual field (RVF).\nThe results demonstrate that, relative to neutral non-salient faces, both positive and\nnegative emotional expressions enhance attention in young children. As discussed below,\nthis general emotion/saliency bias may have served several important evolutionary\nfunctions. We provide additional new preliminary evidence that genes may play an\nimportant role in determining the extent to which emotional facial expressions capture\nspatial attention across individuals, especially those in the left visual field (LVF). This\neffect was demonstrated in a small sample of young twins, suggesting an early genetic\ninfluence on emotion-elicited spatial attention, which lends support to the notion that the\nallocation of attentional resources to emotional expressions serves an important\nevolutionary function. Preliminary genetic influences also were observed for general\ninformation processing.\nGeneral spatial attention-related effects\nOur results indicate that in 5-year-old children, RVF fearful and happy facial\nexpressions elicit enhancements in spatial attention relative to neutral faces. This result\naugments previous findings in this age group that have demonstrated that threatening\nstimuli are more attention-grabbing than positive or neutral stimuli (LoBue, 2009; LoBue\nand DeLoache, 2008). Here, we demonstrated that in younger children, happy facial\nexpressions are attended to more than neutral expressions in environments containing only\nhappy and neutral expressions. Given that our study did not contain trials in which fearful\nand happy faces were presented at the same time, it is somewhat difficult to make direct\ncomparisons to prior work at this age, which to the best of our knowledge has only assessed\nAttention to emotional faces in children\nattentional biases to threatening stimuli compared to neutral or happy stimuli (LoBue,\n2009; LoBue and DeLoache, 2008). Yet, based on our findings and this earlier work, it is\nreasonable to speculate that when confronted with an environment containing fearful and\nhappy faces, 5-year-olds attend to the threat-related stimulus; however, in environments\ncontaining either fearful or happy vs. neutral faces, both types of emotional faces appear to\nequally elicit 5-year-olds' attentional resources. This may indicate that 5-year-olds'\nattentional responses are \"all or none\" and that the most salient visual stimulus is\npreferentially attended to.\nFrom an evolutionary perspective it is obviously advantageous to direct one's\nattention to the location of potential threat so that this threat can be avoided or at least\nminimized and thus reduce the chances of bodily harm. However, in the absence of threat,\nattending to positive cues also appears to have several adaptive functions. It may be that an\nevolutionary advantage is conveyed by attending to both threatening and positive stimuli\nwhen they are highly biologically significant, such as faces (Brosch et al., 2007). For\nexample, in a social context children would be more likely to develop relationships with\npeers and form strong bonds that may last beyond childhood into adulthood and promote\nprosocial group behavior important for survival. Additionally, at age five, attending to\nhappy faces may promote play behavior, which appears to be important in the development\nof one's motor skills as well as social skills. Finally, smiling or happy expressions may\nsignal the obtainment of a valuable resource such as food in the expresser and attentive\nviewers may be more likely to obtain this resource for themselves as well. Thus, we\nprovide evidence that young children allocate spatial attention to fearful and happy faces,\nwhich is a behavior that would seem to be adaptive in 5-year-old children.\nIt should be noted that our results also extend previous work in this age group by\ndemonstrating that emotional facial expressions can enhance attention and facilitate\nbehavior even in circumstances where these facial expressions are task-irrelevant and\nchildren are not actively searching for a particular affective facial expression. This\nindicates that the processing of stimuli (e.g., the non-face Star Man) subsequently occurring\nwithin the emotional-face elicited \"spotlight of attention\" is enhanced rather than just an\nenhancement in the processing of the affect face itself. Recent research in adults indicates\nthat this type of emotion-enhanced stimulus/target processing is represented by enhanced\nactivation in location specific areas of visual cortex (Carlson, Reinke, LaMontagne, and\nWe found a visual field \u00d7 congruency interaction, which upon further investigation\nrevealed that attention was directed to RVF, but not LVF, emotional faces in 5-year-old\nchildren. Visual field effects in adult studies with participants not evaluated for anxiety\nlevels have been inconsistent and have reported bilateral (Carlson and Reinke, 2008), RVF\n(Pourtois et al., 2004), and LVF (Carlson, Reinke, and Habib, 2009) congruency effects for\nfearful faces. On the other hand, highly anxious adult participants tend to display LVF\ncongruency effects for threatening faces (Mogg and Bradley, 1999). Therefore, individual\ndifferences may mediate visual field effects in adult populations and explain\ninconsistencies in studies with unselected populations. Studies of emotion-elicited\nattentional bias in older children have not reported visual field effects (Puliafico and\nKendall, 2006; Waters et al., 2004). The distinct findings in this age group may reflect a\nAttention to emotional faces in children\nreliance on left hemisphere featural, rather than right hemisphere configural, processing.\nEvidence suggests that the development of featural face processing precedes that of\nconfigural processing, and thus children typically process faces based on their featural\ncomponents rather than configurally as adults do (Freire and Lee, 2003). An additional\nexplanation of the visual field interaction may be that the enhanced RVF response may be\ndue to the predominance of right handed (n = 14) vs. left (n = 7) handed children. The RVF\ncorresponding to the left visual cortex and subsequently right motor control may have\ninadvertently speeded responses to stimuli in that visual field. To attempt to examine this\npossibility, handedness was included in analyses, but no significant interaction effects were\nobserved. Nevertheless, at age 5, RVF fearful and happy faces appear to preferentially\ncapture spatial attention.\nExploratory genetic-related effects\nDifferences were found between MZ and DZ twins on the spatial attention index,\nwith MZ twin scores being more similar than DZ twin scores. This indicates that in\naddition to a possible genetic influence on emotional facial processing, the extent to which\nemotional faces capture spatial attention across individuals may be influenced by an\nunderlying genetic component as well. This was found for both happy and fearful faces,\nsuggesting that it is the featural properties of emotional faces that are genetically influenced\nand not properties for a specific emotion. These results are consistent with previous\nneuroimaging and behavioral research that has found genetic influences on attention\nemotional face (Wolfensberger et al., 2008) processing. Whereas previous research has\ndemonstrated that emotion- and cognition-related neural processing are independently\ninfluenced by genetics, we provide new preliminary evidence suggesting the interplay\nbetween emotion and spatial attention also may be influenced by genetics. This genetic\ninfluence appears at a relatively young age, reinforcing the hypothesis that there may be an\ninnate component to face-elicited spatial attention (Darwin, 1872). The presence of such an\ninfluence would indicate a possible benefit in attending to spatially diverse facial signals.\nThus, both happy and fearful faces would be important, each conveying distinct\nbiologically relevant information (Brosch et al., 2007). Such an innate response to fearful\nand happy faces in early childhood would likely confer an advantage in promoting group\nsocialization, social cognition, and in extreme cases survival (Brosch et al., 2007).\nIt should be noted that even though there were very similar orienting preferences\nwithin MZ twin pairs, there were variable preferences across MZ (and DZ) twin pairs. That\nis, while one MZ pair may similarly orient towards emotional faces, another MZ pair may\norient away from emotional faces. These differences across MZ pairs are likely attributable\nto differences in personality traits and/or specific genetic composition. Given this\nvariability, future research that targets specific genotypes is needed to more precisely\ndetermine the nature and mechanism(s) of this underlying genetic effect. One candidate\ngene is the serotonin transporter (5HTT), which is associated with emotion and stress-\nrelated phenomena including amygdala reactivity to fearful faces (Hariri and Holmes,\n2006). Importantly, the amygdala has also been found to mediate the orienting of spatial\nattention to threatening faces in both adults (Carlson et al., 2009) and children with\nAttention to emotional faces in children\ngeneralized anxiety disorder (Monk et al., 2008). Furthermore, in adult samples, 5HTT\ngenotype has been associated with attentional biases to positive and negative emotional\nstimuli (Beevers, Gibb, McGeary, and Miller, 2007; Fox, Ridgewell, and Ashwin, 2009;\nPerez-Edgar et al., 2010). Yet, it is unclear if 5HTT genotype plays a role in younger\nchildren's affective attentional biases or the observed genetic effects of this study. Our\nfinding of a genetic influence on the capture of spatial attention by emotional facial\nexpression provides a basis for further exploration into the genetic makeup of this complex\nbehavior in younger samples.\nIn addition to the genetic influence of emotional expression on spatial attention,\nsignificant differences were found between MZ and DZ twins for overall RT and across a\nnumber of trial types (see Table 1). These results are consistent with previous research\nshowing general genetic influences on RTs (Neubauer et al., 2000), which may be\nattributed to speed of information processing. Speed of processing represents a lower\nmental ability which has been linked to higher cognitive processes such as memory and IQ\n(Neubauer et al., 2000). In the present study it is likely that individual differences in speed\nof information processing partially influenced performance on the spatial attention task.\nHowever, studies have shown that genetic influences on facial recognition are independent\nof memory (McKone and Palermo, 2010) and that a distinct genetic influence likely exists\nfor visual attention independent of speed of information processing (Luciano et al., 2001).\nThe design of the present study allowed for a test of differences in visual spatial attention,\noutside of general influences on speed of information processing.\nThis study was the first to investigate genetic influences on reaction time to\nemotional faces in 5-year-old twins. It must be noted that the sample size was small for\ngenetic analyses, and these results must be considered preliminary. Future research\nreplicating this effect in larger samples is needed before any strong conclusions can be\nmade. Additionally, based on our results, it is unclear to what extent our attention-related\ngenetic effect is specific to fearful and happy emotional facial expression. Thus, future\ninvestigations should include other emotional (e.g., sadness, disgust, anger, and surprise)\nand non-emotional (e.g., tongue sticking out) facial expressions in addition to other types of\nsalient attention grabbing stimuli (e.g., flashing objects). Nonetheless, the presence of a\npreliminary genetic influence suggests that even at a young age genes may influence\ngeneral emotional processing in addition to the more complex influence they may have on\nemotional face-related spatial attention.\nIn summary, we found that RVF emotional faces in general captured spatial\nattention in a sample of 5-year-old children, which may be associated with left hemisphere\ndominant featural processing. The use of twins in the present study allowed rough\nestimation of genetic influence on a number of trial types. Critically, we provide the first\nevidence that the preferential orienting of spatial attention to emotional facial expressions is\nmediated by a genetic component in children as young as 5 years, which supports the\nnotion that directing spatial attention to emotional faces is hereditary. Additionally, there\nwere general genetic influences on reaction time to emotional stimuli. Although these twin\nfindings must be viewed cautiously, the presence of a genetic influence on emotional face-\nelicited spatial attention on 5-year-old twins adds important and novel knowledge to the\ncurrent understanding of early emotional and social development.\nAttention to emotional faces in children\nReferences\nAnokhin, A.
