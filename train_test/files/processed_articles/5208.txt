    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe present article describes the development of a Japanese version of the Early Childhood Behavior Questionnaire (ECBQ).\nThe influence of social desirability on the Japanese ECBQ was investigated using a cross-sectional sample (N = 318). The\neffects of gender and developmental changes in temperament were investigated in a longitudinal sample (N = 191). A three-\nfactor structure was found in the instrument, the three factors being Surgency/Extraversion, Negative Affectivity, and Effortful\nControl. These factors were the same as those found in the original ECBQ. Social desirability showed less influence on the\nJapanese ECBQ, indicating the instrument was free from culture-based construct bias. This longitudinal study highlighted that\nJapanese toddlers have quieter, more withdrawn, and more passive temperaments, a finding that supports that of previous\nresearch comparing temperament-scale means between Japanese and U.S. children.\n",

If bias is not eliminated, the tool\ncannot be considered equivalent and the differences in the mea-\nsurement scores may stem from contamination by evaluators'\ncultural beliefs and/or expectations of children rather than\nreflecting differences in the toddlers'temperaments.\nThe present study sought to eliminate method bias using\nthe same sample attributes and the same form of question-\nnaire as the original Early Childhood Behavior Questionnaire\n(ECBQ). The issue of item bias was addressed by using an\nappropriate translation method. However, as it was not clear\nif construct bias existed, this bias will be evaluated using\nsocial desirability described below.\nEven after these biases are eliminated, the mean score level\nand the factor structure (possible interrelationship of the 18\ntemperament scales) of the ECBQ could be influenced by cul-\ntural differences. The effect of cultural influence on the mean\nscore was investigated using a level-oriented study, while that\non interrelationship used a structure-oriented study (Van de\nCaudill and Weinstein (1969) conducted a study compar-\ning toddlers' temperaments in the United States and Japan.\nThis study found that Japanese mothers expect their babies to\nbe quiet and content, while U.S. mothers expect babies to be\nvocal and active (Caudill & Weinstein, 1969). Bornstein\n(1989), in a later review of the literature, also found that\ninfants in the United States had higher levels of motor activ-\nity than those in Japan. Therefore, the present study expected\nthat scores on the temperament scales on the Japanese ECBQ\nrepresenting toddlers' activity, such as Activity Level and\nHigh-Intensity Pleasure (HIP), would be lower in Japan than\nthose reported in the original ECBQ (Putnam, Gartstein, &\nRothbart, 2006). In a study using a Japanese version of the\nInfant Behavior Questionnaire\u00adRevised (IBQ-R), Nakagawa\nand Sukigara (2005) found that the differences in gender and\nage in the scale means were almost the same as those in the\noriginal IBQ-R.

In the Japanese IBQ-R,\nthree factors were determined: NegativeAffectivity, Surgency/\nExtraversion, and Orienting/Regulation (Nakagawa &\nSukigara, 2005). These three factors were also found in the\noriginal IBQ-R (Gartstein & Rothbart, 2003), the original\nECBQ (Putnam et al., 2006), and the original Child Behavior\nQuestionnaire (CBQ; Rothbart, Ahadi, Hershey, & Fisher,\n2001). The three-factor structure in the Japanese IBQ-R\nincludes some different temperament scales for the Surgency/\nExtraversion and Orienting/Regulation factors, but the tem-\nperament scales comprising Negative Affectivity are the same\nas in the original IBQ-R. For example, Gartstein and Rothbart\n(2003) considered Soothability to be an Orienting/Regulation\nfactor, while Nakagawa and Sukigara (2005) found it to be a\nSurgency/Extraversion factor. However, in the Japanese CBQ,\nKusanagi, Hoshi, and Chen (1999) found the same three-fac-\ntor structure and the same scales comprising in each factor as\nin the original CBQ. The Japanese ECBQ is situated between\nthe IBQ-R and the CBQ in terms of the age of children mea-\nsured, and the present authors expected to find a similar three-\nfactor structure as well as some differences in the scales\ncomprising each factor with those found in the Japanese\nDifferences in the factor structures of the Japanese and\noriginal ECBQ raise the question of why cultural differences\nresult in a difference in the scales comprising each factor.\nDifferences in the patterns of inter-correlations of the 18\nECBQ temperament scales can be expected across cultures,\nbut the reasons for these differences are unclear. Caprara,\nBarbaranelli, Bermudez, Maslach, and Ruch (2000) com-\npared the factor structure of the Big Five questionnaire across\ncultures. They suggested that the Big Five factors were\nbroad, general dimensions that encompass different, but\noverlapping domains (Caprara et al., 2000). Therefore, it\nmay be that the temperament concept dimensions (factors) in\nthe ECBQ also have behavioral domains that overlap, and\nthese overlapping behaviors might differ between cultures.\nThese differences in overlapping behaviors may also arise\nfrom differences in cultural beliefs and expectations for chil-\ndren and/or temperament concepts. In turn, these differences\nproduce factor structure differences and differences in the\nscales comprising each factor.\nThe ECBQ comprises a list of children's behaviors within\na cultural context, with the frequencies of those behaviors\nrated by evaluators. It may be that when evaluators (in the\npresent study, caregivers) consider a particular behavior\nappropriate or desirable for their culture, that behavior may\nbe rated as occurring more frequently. If two behaviors are\ninterpreted as meeting the same cultural expectations for\nchildren, both behaviors may be rated as occurring more fre-\nquently at the same time and within different contexts, and\nthe high correlation between them will be shown whether or\nnot these behaviors stem from temperament factors. This\nmeans that the differences in overlapping behaviors can\nappear as cultural differences in the factor structure and/or\nthe scales comprising the factors. For example, if Japanese\ncaregivers believe that both a low Activity Level behavior\nand a high Inhibitory Control behavior are desirable and\nexpected for children, they will consider both behaviors to\noccur more frequently in many cultural contexts, and the\nresulting high correlation between them is attributed to the\nsame factor. However, Putnam et al. (2006) highlighted that\nthese behaviors stem from different temperament factors\n(e.g., Activity Level from Surgency/Extraversion and\nInhibitory Control from Effortful Control).\nAn index of cultural differences in caregivers' beliefs and\nexpectations for children was necessary to provide clarity.\nSocial desirability differs between cultures and is considered\nto be a manifestation of evaluators' cultural beliefs about\nand/or expectations for their children. This makes the social\ndesirability of constructs, namely, 18 temperaments, a candi-\ndate for a cultural differences index.\nTo assess the impact of social desirability (an index of con-\nstruct bias) on the ECBQ scores, caregivers in the present\nstudy were asked to directly evaluate their impression of their\nchild on 18 temperament dimensions; this rating was called\n\"caregiver rating of their children's temperament\" (CGR). As\nthe ECBQ required caregivers to rate their children's behavior\nin specific situations (Putnam, Ellis, & Rothbart, 2001), the\nCGR was likely to show more caregiver bias. Social desirabil-\nity was therefore expected to influence the CGR rating more\nstrongly than the behavioral frequency ratings in the ECBQ.\nHowever, if both the Japanese ECBQ and the CGR ratings\nshow the same influence by social desirability, then the tem-\nperament-scale scores on the ECBQ were contaminated by\nsocial desirability. Caregivers in the present study were asked\nto complete both the CGR and the Japanese ECBQ.\nSocial desirability tends to additively influence rating fre-\nquencies of toddler behavior for each component item of the\ntemperament scale. This means that social desirability\nneeded to be determined independently from the ECBQ and\nthe CGR ratings to accurately determine the causal\nrelationship.\nIt is noticed that the CGR has another purpose. In Japan,\nlittle research on toddler temperament using the ECBQ or\nother similar tests is available, meaning the results of the\npresent study cannot be compared with those of other\nJapanese studies. Other tools were needed to investigate the\nvalidity of the Japanese ECBQ. The CGR would be a candi-\ndate of the other tool. The Japanese ECBQ and the CGR\nwere assumed to measure the same constructs, but they were\ndifferent in the measurement method. Thus, to verify the\nvalidity of the Japanese ECBQ, we will evaluate the correla-\ntions between the scores of the Japanese ECBQ and the CGR\nand will confirm whether the gender and age differences in\nthe CGR are like as in the Japanese ECBQ.\nThe present study is divided into two parts: Sutdy 1\nfocuses on the development of a Japanese ECBQ and seeks\nSukigara et al. 3\nto verify cultural differences in the Japanese ECBQ by eval-\nuating how social desirability of each temperament scale\naffects these scores. Study 2 examines longitudinal shifts in\nthe temperament dimensions of 18- to 36-month-old infants\nin the Japanese ECBQ.\nIt was expected that toddlers in Japan would be rated as\nquieter, more content, and having lower levels of motor\nactivity than those reported in the original ECBQ study.\nThe Japanese tool was also expected to have the same\nthree-factor structure, and show similar age and gender dif-\nferences and developmental changes. This would indicate\nthat the Japanese ECBQ was compatible with the original\ntool. To demonstrate that the tool was free from culture\neffects, correlations between social desirability, or con-\nstruct bias, and the ECBQ should be lower than correlations\nbetween social desirability and the CGR.\nMethod\nInstrument Construction\nJapanese ECBQ. The ECBQ (Putnam et al., 2006) was trans-\nlated into Japanese by a professional Japanese translator and\nby a graduate student who is a child care worker. These two\nforward translations were then reviewed by the present\nauthors and synthesized into a single translation. This Japa-\nnese translation was back-translated into English and the\ntranslation quality examined by a bilingual Japanese U.S.\nresident. A pilot study was conducted with 12 caregivers\nwho had a child aged 18 to 36 months. Participants were\nasked to check the item readability in the Japanese ECBQ.\nThe pilot study recommended culturally appropriate modifi-\ncations to questions referring to water sprinklers, nursery\nrhymes, and beeping sounds.\nTo complete the Japanese ECBQ, caregivers were asked\nto report the frequency of specific child behaviors on a\n7-point Likert-type scale ranging from never to always.\nTable 1 sets out the number of items on each scale.\nCGR. A short, clear definition of the 18 temperament dimen-\nsions was prepared as an item in Japanese (see the appendix).\nCaregivers were asked to rate how applicable a given tem-\nperament dimension was to their child on a 6-point Likert-\ntype scale ranging from least to most. It was emphasized that\nthese ratings were to be according to global judgments and/\nor impressions, and not the frequency of their children's\nbehaviors.\nSocial desirability.To observe the social desirability of the\ntemperament dimensions independently from the ECBQ\nscores, a different adult sample was needed. This sample\nrated the social desirability of definitions (constructs) of the\n18 temperaments on a 6-point Likert-type scale ranging from\nundesirable to desirable. The 18 items were the same as on\nthe CGR. Participants were instructed on the definition of\nsocial desirability before providing ratings, and it was\nTable 1.

Caregivers who attended a medical check-up for\nan 18-month-old child at public health centers in Nagoya and\nKonan in Aichi Prefecture, and Fukui in Fukui Prefecture\nwere invited to participate in the study. This gave a study\nsample of 318 toddlers (49% female). The average age of\nyears); they were primarily female, except for one male and\nthree unknown, and 97% were mothers. The exclusion crite-\nria were a birth weight of less than 2,500 g or more than\nthan 43 weeks; a birth defect; and those who attended a nurs-\nery school (caregivers needed to observe their children's\nbehavior all day to answer the ECBQ).\nThe majority of the data were collected in metropolitan\nNagoya (75%), 14% in Konan, 8% in the provincial town of\nFukui, and a further 2% in other locations. The Japanese\nECBQ and the CGR were distributed to caregivers, provid-\ning data for a first time-point.\nTo allow for a cross-sectional analysis, toddlers were\ndivided in three groups according to age as in Putnam et al.\nBecause both Nagoya and Konan did not have any 0% val-\nues, we constructed an Age (3) \u00d7 Location (Nagoya and\nKonan) frequency table and tested this using a chi-square\ntest. We found no significant difference in the age propor-\ntion of participants from urban and rural settings (2 = 2.29,\ndf = 3, n.s.).\nSix months later, the Japanese ECBQ was administered\nfor a second time to 194 participants. At the first time-point,\n48 of the 318 participants who belonged to the older age\ngroup were out of the ECBQ's coverage age by the second\ntime-point. So, at second time, those 48 were not requested\nto respond to the Japanese ECBQ. Because 76 did not return\nthe questionnaire, 194 participants were analyzed. Responses\ncould be matched to first-time participants through the birth-\ndays of child and mother, child's gender, and residential area\nprovided data for a second time-point, and Cronbach's alphas\nwere calculated for the 194 data sets.\nTwelve months later, 128 participants with children aged\n24 to 29 months were administered the ECBQ by mail. This\nprovided data for a third time-point. A total of 127 partici-\nthe ECBQ.

These groups of par-\nticipants were asked to rate the social desirability of con-\nstructs of the 18 temperament scales on a 6-point Likert-type\nscale.\nResults\nThe results of the present study are presented in two parts.\nFirst, the factor structures of the Japanese ECBQ, CGR, and\nsocial desirability are reported, along with the relationships\nbetween these indices, and the mean scale scores of the\ncross-sectional data (318 participants). Second, the findings\nof the investigation of the longitudinal shift in temperament\nscales (127 participants) are reported.\nStudy 1: Cross-Sectional Data\nDistributions, means, and SDs. The means and SDs for each\nage by gender on each temperament scale are set out in Table\n1. In Sample 1 (N = 318), the normality of distribution was\nexamined with a Shapiro-Wilk test. Activity Level, Atten-\ntional Focusing, Attentional Shifting, Cuddliness, Frustra-\ntion (FR), HIP, Inhibitory Control, and Perceptual Sensitivity\nwere normally distributed, while the remaining 10 scales\nwere not. However, distributions for all scales had one peak\nand were nearly symmetrical at the peak.\nInternal consistency. Alpha coefficients of temperament scales\nfor the first time-point are shown in Table 2. Of the 18 alphas,\n14 were more than .70, indicating substantial internal consis-\ntency. Four alphas were below .70: Attentional Shifting ( =\nActivation ( = .69). These alphas were similar to those in\nPutnam et al. (2006), and changes of alpha coefficient by age\ngroup also followed the same trends. Therefore, the Japanese\nECBQ was show to have internal consistency corresponding\nto that of the original ECBQ.\nFactor structure (Japanese ECBQ).A principal component\nanalysis of the 18 temperament scales was conducted with-\n1.114, in descending order; the fourth eigenvalue was less\nthan half of the third, and these three components accounted\nfor 49.6% of the total variance. A factor analysis with pro-\ncrustes rotation was conducted to confirm whether the pat-\ntern matrix replicated the original ECBQ. The factor patterns\nobtained had good consistency with the target pattern, using\nboth a factor congruent coefficient and a variable congruent\ncoefficient (Table 3). These congruent coefficients are the\ncorrelation coefficients between the factor loadings in the\ntarget pattern and those in the pattern obtained for each factor\nSukigara et al. 5\nand on each variable. This indicates sufficient comparability\nbetween the two-factor patterns of more than .90 (McCrae,\nZonderman, Costa, Bond, & Paunonen, 1996). However, less\ncompatible between the Japanese and the original ECBQ for\nPerceptual Sensitivity, with a variable congruent coefficient\nof .775, was found. This means that almost the same factor\nstructure (with a first factor of Negative Affectivity, a second\nof Effortful Control, and a third of Surgency/Extraversion)\nwas found in both versions.\nCGR.Principal component and factor analyses were con-\nducted for the CGR as for the ECBQ.

The factor congruent\ncoefficients were slightly less than .90, indicating factor pat-\nterns obtained had almost as good consistency with the target\npattern (Table 3). Some incongruent variables were found on\nthe Surgency/Extraversion factor (Positive Anticipation\n.890) and on the Effortful Control factor (Attentional Shifting\nment scales of the Negative Affectivity were congruent with\nthe original. As the factor structure of the Japanese ECBQ\nreplicated the original ECBQ, the temperament scales of two\nfactors for the CGR were affected by something other than\nthe temperaments measured with the ECBQ. These results\nalign with those of Nakagawa and Sukigara (2005), where\nthe Japanese IBQ-R did not replicate the temperament scales\nof the original Surgency and the Effortful Control factors,\nbut the Negative Affectivity temperament scales were\ncongruent.\nSocial desirability.An exploratory factor analysis with vari-\nmax rotation was conducted on social desirability in Sample\n2 (N = 368). A two-factor solution was found (Table 4), with\nment scales with high first-factor loading had high social\ndesirability, but those with high second-factor loading had\nlow social desirability (Tables 4 and 5). Therefore, the mea-\nsurement of social desirability measured the social desirabil-\nity of temperament constructs, but not temperament\nconstructs per se.\nSocial desirability, ECBQ, and CGR.The means and SDs for\nsocial desirability on each temperament scale are shown in\nTable 5. The effects of social desirability were considered to\nadd to the mean scores of each scale in the ECBQ and the\nCGR by constant amount, meaning the correlation coeffi-\ncients between the social desirability and the ECBQ, and\nbetween the social desirability and the CGR were an index of\nthe amount of the social desirability effect.

The correlation between social\nHowever, Fisher's z test showed that the correlation coeffi-\ncient between social desirability and the CGR was not statis-\ntically higher than the correlation between social desirability\nand the ECBQ (z = .927, n.s.).\nFigure 1 presents a scatter diagram of the ECBQ and the\nCGR temperament dimensions in terms of social desirability.\nFor the relationship of the ECBQ to social desirability, all\ntemperament dimensions, excluding Impulsivity (I) and HIP,\nlined up linearly (r2 = .417) in the relationship of the CGR to\nsocial desirability; all but FR lined up linearly (r2 = .645).\nSocial desirability accounted for a greater proportion of vari-\nance in the CGR than in the ECBQ, suggesting that the CGR\nwas influenced more by social desirability than the ECBQ.\nTo evaluate the contribution of social desirability, the par-\ntial correlation between the CGR and social desirability\nand the partial correlation between the ECBQ and social\ndesirability excluding the effect of the CGR (r = .155,\nSukigara et al. 7\nN = 18, n.s.) were calculated. This indicates that although\ncaregivers rate global impression of toddler temperament\naccording to social desirability, their reports of the frequency\nof specific child behaviors were relatively independent of\nsocial desirability.\nGender and age effects in Japanese ECBQ.Gender and age\neffects were assessed using a 2 \u00d7 3 (Gender \u00d7 Age Group)\nANOVA. The effects of age were significant for Discomfort,\nPerceptual Sensitivity, Impulsivity, Sociability, Positive\nAnticipation, Inhibitory Control, Attentional Shifting, Cud-\ndliness, and Attentional Focusing (Table 1). A contrast analy-\nsis indicated that Impulsivity linearly declined with age at\nthe .05 significance level, and Attentional Shifting linearly\nincreased with age at the .01 significance level. Other signifi-\ncant scales also increased linearly with age at a 1% level.\nThese trends were similar to those found in Putnam et al.\nThe effects of gender were significant for FR, Activity\nLevel, HIP, Inhibitory Control, Low-Intensity Pleasure, and\nMales had significantly a higher mean score on FR and\nActivity Level than females (p < .05). Caregivers rated males\nsignificantly higher than females for HIP, while for Inhibitory\nControl, females were rated significantly higher than males\n(p < .01).

No interaction of age with gender was\nfound.\nAge-related effects in the CGR differed from those in the\nJapanese ECBQ on dimensions of Attention Shifting, Fear,\nHIP, Low-Intensity Pleasure, Perceptual Sensitivity, and\nSoothability. The age-related changes in the mean rates were\nthe same in both the ECBQ and CGR. However, only the\nActivity Level temperament had the same main effect in both\nthe ECBQ and CGR.\nRelationships between the Japanese ECBQ and the CGR.Cor-\nrelation coefficients between the scale score of the ECBQ\nand CGR ranged from .20 (Impulsivity) to .65 (Attentional\nFocusing; Table 5).All correlations were significantly greater\nthan zero at p < .001, but the correlation coefficients were at\na medium level. The CGR was assumed to measure the same\nconstructs (temperaments) as the ECBQ with a different\nmeasuring method, meaning the correlations on each scale\nbetween the CGR and the ECBQ would be slightly lower\nthan each scale's reliability coefficient. From the alpha coef-\nficients of temperament scales in Table 2 and the correlation\ncoefficients in Table 5, it appears that the higher the alpha,\nthe higher the correlation. The highest alpha and correlation\nwere .89 and .65 (Attentional Focusing), and the lowest\nalpha and correlation were .63 and .20 (Impulsivity). As all\ncorrelations were low, the CGR may have been contaminated\nby something other than the toddlers' temperaments and the\neffect of differences in methods (e.g., caregivers' expecta-\ntions of their child and/or social desirability).\nStudy 2: Longitudinal Shifts\nAttrition effects. At the first time-point, 48 of the 318 partici-\npants who belonged to the older age group were out of the\nECBQ's coverage age by the second time-point. This means\nthese participants were not asked to respond to the Japanese\nECBQ a second time. Of the remaining participants, 204\nreturned the questionnaire, but only 194 were analyzed. This\ngave an attrition size of 76 from the first to the second time-\npoints. At the third time-point 12 months later, only 128 par-\nticipants were requested to answer the Japanese ECBQ. A\ntotal of 127 participants returned the questionnaire, giving an\nattrition size from the second to the third time-points of one.\nTo investigate the attrition effect of the 76 dropout partici-\npants from the first to the second time-points (an attrition\nof the temperament-scale means of the attrition sample and\nthe sample at the second time-point was conducted using t\ntests. No significant differences in any scales between the\ntwo samples were found. The samples at the first, second,\nand third time-points and the attrition group had the same\ncomposition of recruitment area, indicating attrition did not\nbias the results.\nInternal consistency and inter-time correlations (test\u00adretest cor-\nrelations).The alpha coefficients of the temperament scales\nfor the second and third time-points, are shown in Table 6.\nThese alphas were almost the same as from the first time-\npoint indicating that the Japanese ECBQ had sufficient inter-\nnal consistency when it was repeatedly administered.\nTo investigate the inter-time correlation for each tempera-\nment scale, a correlation coefficient between time-points was\ncalculated (Table 6). Of the 18 correlations between the\nyoung (Y) and middle (M) age groups (i.e., between the first\nand second time-points), Positive Anticipation had the low-\nest correlation (r = .27) as Putnam et al. (2006). This dimen-\nsion was also lowest between the M and older (O) age groups\n(i.e., between the second and third time-points; r = .51) and\nbetween the first and third time-points (r = .30). The highest\ncorrelation was for Perceptual Sensitivity, from the Y to M\ngroups (r = .77) and from the Y to the O groups (r = .67). The\ncorrelation for Motor Activation was the highest between the\nM and O groups (r = .79). Table 6 also shows the average\ncorrelation of the 18 temperament dimensions obtained by\ncalculating the mean of the Fisher z transformation of rs.\nThis means r represents overall inter-time consistency among\nthe 18 temperament dimensions.\nSukigara et al. 9\nSome items for which consistency is lowest (e.g., Positive\nAnticipation) describe situations less relevant for 18-month-\nold toddlers but more relevant for older toddlers: for exam-\nple, \"When hearing about a future family outing (such as a\ntrip to the playground).\" This may explain the lower correla-\ntions across time-points.\nThe inter-time correlation can be interpreted as test\u00adretest\nreliability. However, the correlations were influenced by\nboth developmental changes and individual differences,\nmeaning developmental changes may have attenuated the\nintrinsic test\u00adretest reliability. No explanation has been\noffered for the correlation across time-points for the Y and M\ngroups, as methods to differentiate the two effects are not\navailable at present.\nLongitudinal shifts of temperament dimension and gender\neffect. Longitudinal shifts and gender effects were assessed\nusing a 2 \u00d7 3 (Gender \u00d7 Time) ANOVA. Table 7 shows the\nlongitudinal shifts for each gender. The main effects of time\n(age) were significant on all but three temperament dimen-\nsions: Low-Intensity Pleasure, Motor Activation, and Shy-\nness (Table 7). Soothability decreased linearly with time\n(age), Activity Level had the highest mean score at the sec-\nond time-point, and the other temperament dimensions\nincreased linearly with time (age).\nThe effects of gender were significant for Activity Level,\nHIP, Inhibitory Control, and Low-Intensity Pleasure (Table 7).\nFor Activity Level and HIP, males had higher mean scores\nthan females, while females had higher mean scores than\nmales for Inhibitory Control and Low-Intensity Pleasure.\nThe gender effect significantly interacted with age only\nfemales increased as the toddlers grew older, whereas the\nmale scores increased from the first to the second time-points\nand decreased until the third time-point.\nDiscussion\nThe present study concluded that the Japanese ECBQ was not\ncontaminated by social desirability and is a well-developed,\nculture-free tool. The findings showed that the 18 scales were\ninternally consistent and consistent across time. The factor\nstructure of the instrument was the same as that of the original\nECBQ (Putnam et al., 2006) and was similar to that of fine-\ngrained measures of temperament dimension currently in use\nwith younger (IBQ-R) and older children (CBQ). The age and\ngender differences and developmental changes that emerged\nin the cross-sectional and longitudinal studies were also con-\nsistent with the original ECBQ.\nAssuming that social desirability is a manifestation of the\nraters' cultural beliefs and/or expectations (construct bias)\nfor their toddlers, the correlations between the ECBQ, the\nCGR, and social desirability were evaluated (Figure 1). The\npartial correlations suggested that caregivers' global\nTable 6.

The factor patterns of the\nSurgency/Extraversion factor (Positive Anticipation,\nImpulsivity, Sociability, and Activity Level) and that of the\nEffortful Control factor (Attentional Shifting and Low-\nIntensity Pleasure) were incongruent with the factor pattern\nof the original ECBQ. The results of the Japanese IBQ-R\nwere similar to those found in the CGR in the present study\nparticularly as the children's behavioral frequency ratings in\nthe IBQ-R were also affected by social desirability. This sug-\ngests that social desirability has more influence on both\nglobal impressions rated by the CGR and infants' behaviors\nrated by the IBQ-R, but less influence on the toddlers rated\nby the ECBQ. It may be inferred that the influence of social\ndesirability on the behavior ratings decreases as the children\ngrow older (i.e., from infant to toddler) but that the influence\non global impression ratings are longer lasting.\nHowever, the present results contradict the common belief\nthat effects of culture through rearing styles and education\nincrease as children grow older. It may be that as infants or\nneonates are relatively immobile, and some behaviors do not\noccur until the child is older, raters'beliefs or expectation for\nchildren may be more strongly projected and contaminate\nthe behavioral frequency ratings. This would be less likely to\noccur as children grew older, as older children are more\nmobile and their behavior is often more apparent to raters\n(caregivers) and therefore more likely to be rated accurately.\nThis means that construct bias may be more likely to influ-\nence rating frequency of infant behavior than that of older\nchildren. This may explain why the effect of social desirabil-\nity on the CGR continued after the effect of social desirabil-\nity on the ECBQ ceased. However, this suggestion should be\ninvestigated in more detail in future.\nCultural differences were also found in scale score levels.\nFirst, the mean scale scores for the Negative Affectivity fac-\ntor (Discomfort, Fear, Sadness, and Shyness) were higher in\nthe Japanese ECBQ and Soothability scores were lower than\nin the original ECBQ (Putnam et al., 2006). Second, for HIP\nand Sociability (Surgency/Extraversion factor), Japanese\ntoddlers had significantly lower mean scores. This aligns\nwith previous findings that toddlers in Japan are quieter,\nmore content, and have a lower level of motor activity than\nthose in the United States (Bornstein, 1989; Caudill &\nThese well-known cultural differences were replicated in\nthe present study and suggest that the Japanese ECBQ paral-\nlels many former Japanese tests of temperament and/or per-\nsonality (Caudill & Weinstein, 1969; Nakagawa & Sukigara,\nSugawara, Aoki, Kitamura, & Shima, 1988).\nIt is remarkable that the present study replicated the cul-\ntural differences in the temperament scores found by Caudill\nand Weinstein (1969), particularly as that study is 45 years\nold. The age difference between their sample (3- to 4-month-\nold U.S. and Japanese infants) and the present study sample\n(18-36 months) means that finding the same cultural differ-\nences is surprising. This indicates that children's tempera-\nments and/or caregivers' expectations for their children do\nnot change so easily over a 45-year period.\nAppendix\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nfor Scientific Research from the Ministry of Education, Culture,\nSports, Science and Technology of Japan.
