Although most children ex-\nperience minimal levels of decay, about\ndecayed surfaces observed in the popu-\nlation.4 Individuals who are impover-\nished experience a disproportionately\nhigh burden of dental caries.5 Unfortu-\nnately, factors responsible for this dis-\nparity in caries have remained elusive.\nThe role of trace elements in the de-\nvelopment of tooth decay has been an\narea of study since the identification of\nfluoride's protective effects.6 Lead,\nwhich accumulates in bones and teeth,\nis of particular interest because of its\nwide distribution in the environment.\nSeveral ecologic and cross-sectional\nfor dental caries.7 These studies, how-\never, were inconclusive. In recent years,\nlead has been identified as a risk\nfactor for dental caries in 2 cross-\nsectional studies conducted in Spain.8,9\nHowever, the most compelling basis for\na causal relationship between lead ex-\nposure and dental caries showed pre-\nnatal and perinatal lead exposure to be\nlinked to increased incidence of caries\nin a well-controlled animal study.10\nThe purpose of the following analy-\nses was to examine the association be-\ntween blood lead level and dental caries\nstatusbyusingdatacollectedintheThird\nNational Health and Nutrition Exami-\nnation Survey (NHANES III), a cross-\nas a confounder for factors that are im-\nportant in understanding the distribu-\ntion of dental caries in the United States.\nMETHODS\nNHANES III was conducted by the Na-\ntional Center for Health Statistics to as-\nsess the health and nutritional status of\nchildren and adults in the United States.\nThiscross-sectionalsurveyincludedper-\nAuthor Affiliations: Eastman Department of Dentistry\n(Dr Moss) and Departments of Pediatrics (Ms Au-\ninger), The University of Rochester School of Medicine\nand Dentistry and Children's Hospital Medical Center,\nRochester, NY; and the Department of Pediatrics, Uni-\nversity of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio (Dr Lanphear).\nCorresponding Author:  , De-\npartment of Community and Preventive Medicine,\nUniversity of Rochester Medical Center, Box 644,\nmoss@prevmed.rochester.edu).\nContext Experiments show that dental caries rates are higher among lead-exposed\nanimals, but this association has not been established in humans.\nObjective To examine the relationship between blood lead levels and dental caries.\nDesign Cross-sectional survey conducted from 1988 to 1994 that included a dental\nexamination and venipuncture blood lead assay.\nSetting and Participants A total of 24 901 persons aged 2 years and older who\nparticipated in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which as-\nsessed the health and nutritional status of children and adults in the United States.\nMain Outcome Measures For children aged 2 to 11 years, the sum of decayed\nand filled deciduous or primary surfaces; for persons aged 6 years and older, the sum\nof decayed and filled permanent surfaces; for those 12 years and older, the sum of\ndecayed, missing, and filled surfaces.\nResults The log of blood lead level was significantly associated with the number of\naffected surfaces for both deciduous and permanent teeth in all age groups, even after\nadjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, diet, and dental care. Among children\naged 5 to 17 years, a 0.24-\u00b5mol/L (5-\u00b5g/dL) change in blood lead level was associated\nwith an elevated risk of dental caries (odds ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-\n2.5). Differences in blood lead level explained some of the differences in caries preva-\nlence in different income levels and regions of the United States. We estimated the popu-\nlation attributable risk of lead exposure to be 13.5% and 9.6% of dental caries occurring\nin 5- to 17-year-olds exposed to the high and moderate levels, respectively.\nConclusions Environmental lead exposure is associated with an increased preva-\nlence of dental caries in the US population. Findings may help explain the distribution\nof caries by income and region of the United States.\nand Patient Page\nsonal household interviews and health\npersons aged 2 months and older who\nwere interviewed over a 6-year period\nview collected demographic, socioeco-\nnomic, dietary, and health history in-\nformation.Theexaminationcomponent\nconsisted of physical and dental exami-\nnationsandvariouslaboratorytestsfrom\nvenipuncture and urine specimens.\nThe health examination included an\noral health component performed by a\nlicensed dentist on examinees aged 1\nyear and older. Results from the dental\nexaminationforcoronalcarieswereused\nfor this study. Details of the methods\nused in the oral health component of the\nsurvey that relate to coronal caries have\ndren 2 to 11 years of age with at least 1\nprimary tooth, the sum of decayed and\nfilleddeciduousorprimarysurfaces(dfs)\nwas analyzed. For persons 6 years and\nolder with at least 1 permanent tooth,\nthe sum of decayed and filled perma-\nnent surfaces (DFS) was analyzed. For\npersons 12 years and older, the sum of\ndecayed, missing, and filled surfaces\n(DMFS) was also included in the analy-\nhad a brief inspection for the presence\nof early childhood caries and were ex-\ncluded from these analyses. For this\nstudy, persons were also categorized as\nbeing either caries free or caries active\n(non\u00adcaries free).\nThe primary independent variable\nwas environmental lead exposure.\nBlood specimens were collected dur-\ning the examination component of the\nsurvey from examinees aged 1 year and\nolder and lead levels were deter-\nmined. Blood lead levels below the de-\ntection limit were assigned a value of\nwere log transformed to normalize the\ndistribution of blood lead levels.\nOther potential independent asso-\nciations with dental caries were ana-\nlyzed. Demographic characteristics in-\ncluded age, sex, race, family poverty\nlevel, region of the country, educa-\ntional level of head of household, and\nexposure to cigarette smoke in the\nhome. Family poverty level was de-\nfined as the poverty income ratio (PIR),\ncalculated as the total family income di-\nvided by the poverty threshold for the\nyear of the interview. A PIR of 1 rep-\nresents a family at 100% of the federal\npoverty level. As family income in-\ncreases the PIR increases. Carbohy-\ndrate and calcium intakes from a 24-\nhour dietary recall interview were also\nincluded in the analysis. Use of oral\nhealth services was determined by time\nsince the last visit to a dentist and how\noften the person visited a dentist or den-\ntal hygienist.\nBivariate analyses were conducted to\ndetermine associations with caries-\nfree status. Analyses were stratified by\n12 years) to account for the differ-\nent definitions of dental caries based on\nage. Variables found to be statistically\nsignificant based on 2 and t tests were\nincluded in logistic regression analy-\nses to determine independent associa-\ntions with caries-free status. In addi-\ntion, variables were included if previous\nstudies identified an important role in\nthe epidemiology of dental caries.\nSUDAAN software (Research Triangle\nInstitute, Research Triangle Park, NC)\nwas used to account for the complex\nmultistage sampling design of the sur-\nvey. Sample weights were used to pro-\nduce national estimates by adjusting for\nthe oversampling of young children and\nolder adults as well as for Mexican\nAmerican and black individuals.\nPrevious epidemiological studies of\ncaries in permanent teeth of children\nin the United States have focused on 5-\nings into context, the potential public\nhealth impact of lead exposure on child-\nhood caries in permanent teeth was ex-\namined for individuals aged 5 to 17\nyears. Population attributable risk\n(PAR) estimates were derived using\nLevin's formula:\nPAR% =\n[Prevalence  (Relative Risk - 1) + 1]\nwhere prevalence is the prevalence of\nthe risk factor in the population and\nrelative risk is that estimated using the\nobserved odds ratio.13\nAssessment of environmental lead as\na confounder of associations between\nother risk factors and permanent tooth\ndecay in childhood was done by com-\nparing risk estimates that were unad-\njusted for lead with estimates that were\nderived from analyses that included a\nlead variable. Poverty level, race, and\ngeographic region were of interest be-\ncause these factors have been shown to\nbe associated with lead exposure14 and\nRESULTS\nan oral examination and a blood lead as-\nsay. TABLE 1 and TABLE 2 show the dis-\ntributions by age group for dental car-\nies and blood lead level, respectively.\nThere were statistically significant as-\nsociationsbetweenlogofbloodleadlevel\nand caries status among all age groups\nin both unadjusted and adjusted analy-\nses (TABLE 3). As defined by the sum of\ndecayed and filled surfaces for decidu-\nous (dfs) and permanent teeth (DFS) or\nthe sum of decayed, missing, and filled\npermanent tooth surfaces (DMFS), the\nAge\nGroup, y\nNo. of\nSubjects\nCaries Prevalence\nMean (SE)\n% With\ndfs 1 Mean (SE)\n% With\nDFS 1 Mean (SE)\n% With\n*NHANES III indicates Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey; dfs, decayed and filled surfaces of de-\nciduous teeth; DFS, decayed and filled surfaces of permanent teeth; DMFS, decayed, missing, and filled surfaces of\npermanent teeth; and ellipses, not applicable.\nassociation of blood lead level and den-\ntal caries was statistically significant\namong all 3 age groups. Each of the lin-\near regression models was adjusted for\nage,sex,race,educationallevel,PIR,ciga-\nrette smoke exposure, calcium intake,\ndays since last dental visit, frequency of\ndental visits, and geographic region.\nAmong children 5 to 17 years of age,\ncomparisons of caries-free children vs\nthose with some caries (DMFS 1)\nchange in blood lead level was associ-\nated with an elevated risk for caries\ntertiles shown in Table 2 to define high,\nmoderate, and low exposure to lead in\nchildren aged 5 to 17 years. The popu-\nlation attributable risk of lead expo-\nsure is estimated to be 13.5% of dental\ncaries among individuals exposed to the\nhighest age-specific tertile of lead level\nand 9.6% of caries among individuals\nexposed to the middle age-specific ter-\ntile of lead level, compared with the\nlowest tertile (TABLE 4).\nLead exposure was further assessed\nas a confounder by examining changes\nin point estimates that occurred when\nregression model coefficients were com-\npared with and without adjustment for\nthe log of blood lead level. Results were\nobtained for the 5- to 17-year-old age\ngroup for both logistic regression and\nlinear regression models, using caries\nstatus (present or absent) and number\nof DMFS as the dependent variables, re-\nspectively. Adjustment for blood lead\nlevel attenuated the association of car-\nies status most strongly with PIR\n(TABLE 5). Comparing the Northeast\nwith the West, regional differences in\ncaries status are reduced after adjust-\nment for lead as evidenced by the\nchange in the parameter estimate when\ncomparing models with and without\nlead exposure. In the logistic regres-\nsion models, the difference between the\nunadjusted and adjusted parameter es-\ntimate for the association between resi-\ndence in the West region of the United\nStates and dental caries status equates\nto a 17% difference in the relative risk\nestimate attributable to lead exposure\n(unadjusted odds ratio, 0.75 vs ad-\nCOMMENT\nTrace elements in the environment have\nlong been implicated in the develop-\nment of dental caries.15 The discovery\nof the protective role of fluoride in den-\nwas followed by the widespread prac-\ntice of adjusting public water supplies\nof fluoride.16 Since then, dental caries\nlevels in children in the US popula-\ntion have dramatically declined. This\ndecline has largely been attributed to\nthe increased levels of fluoride in drink-\ning water and dentifrices.1,17\nThe association between poverty sta-\ntus and dental caries in the NHANES\nIII data has been the topic of a recent\nstudy. Vargas et al5 showed that fam-\nily income level was particularly linked\nwith the proportion of children hav-\ning decayed teeth. As income level in-\ncreased, children were less likely to have\nany decayed teeth. About 20% of 6- to\n14-year-old children from families with\npoverty level had at least 1 decayed\ntooth. Only 3% of children from fami-\nlies with incomes that were 301% of the\nfederal poverty level or higher had 1 or\nmore decayed teeth.\nThe results of the present analyses\nsuggest that environmental lead expo-\nsure may explain, at least in part, the\ndisproportionately high rate of dental\ncaries among disadvantaged children\nand adolescents. Without the lead ex-\nposure variable in the statistical model,\nthe PIR shows that the odds of having\na decayed, filled, or missing perma-\nnent tooth decrease as income level in-\ncreases, a finding consistent with that\nof Vargas et al.5 Statistical adjustment\nfor lead exposure reduced the strength\nof the association between income level\nand caries status. This suggests that the\nassociation between poverty and den-\ntal caries is partially explained by lead\nexposure.\nThese data are also consistent with\nthe hypothesis that the decline in en-\nAge\nGroup, y\nNo. of\nSubjects\nBlood Lead Level, \u00b5mol/L\n% With\n\u00b5mol/L\nGeometric\nMean (SE)\nTertile\nTertile\nTertile\n*NHANES III indicates Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.\nTo convert lead from micromoles per liter to micrograms per deciliter, divide by 0.0483.\nTable 3.

Previous\nepidemiological studies have not re-\nported associations between lead ex-\nposure and dental caries that are as\nstrong as those observed in this analy-\nsis. On a population basis, the wide-\nspread exposure to a strong protective\nfactor such as fluoride allows for the\nemergence of other risk factors.20,21 We\nspeculate that when fluoride exposure\nwas variable in the population, the im-\npact of other risk factors was overshad-\nowed by the caries patterns explained\nby fluoride exposure. Now that expo-\nsure to fluoride is relatively uniform,\nthe role of lead in dental caries has be-\ncome more striking.\nBecause fluoride exposure is strongly\nlinked to dental caries risk, one must\nconsider whether lead exposure is sim-\nply a marker for residence in an area that\nisnotservedbyfluoridateddrinkingwa-\nter. An association between patterns of\nlead exposure and fluoridation expo-\nsure would result in a mixing of effects\nand a spurious association between lead\nand dental caries. However, since fluo-\nridation occurs at the community level,\nthis seems unlikely. In the United States,\nefforts to prevent tooth decay focus on\ncommunity drinking water systems. At\npresent, 70% of all cities with popula-\nridated water.3 It seems likely that el-\nevated lead exposure is independent of\nfluoridation status since public water\nsupplies serve the same water to indi-\nviduals with a range of lead exposure.\nNevertheless, the NHANES III data do\nnot provide information on fluoride ex-\nposure so further study is needed to re-\nsolve this issue.\nSmall geographic differences in\nprevalence surveys of dental caries in\nrepresentative samples of US school-\nchildren have been reported.1,22 While\nthe magnitude of these regional differ-\nences has declined over time, lead ex-\nposure may explain some of the ob-\nserved differences. The West region has\ngenerally had low rates of mean DMFS\nin children aged 5 to 17 years and the\nNortheast region has had high rates of\nfor Northeast and West regions.\nLead exposure may be a confounder\nfor these observed regional differences.\nSpecifically, our results suggest that\nsome of the advantage children in the\nwestern United States experience rela-\ntive to children in the Northeast may be\npartially explained by lead exposure.\nOther regional differences did not ap-\npear to be confounded by lead expo-\nsure. NHANES III was not designed to\naccountforseasonalvariationinleadex-\nposure and this may introduce measure-\nment error in the assessment of re-\ngional patterns associated with blood\nWe cannot demonstrate conclu-\nsively that environmental lead expo-\nsure is causally linked to dental caries\non the basis of observational data alone.\nBecause of the complexity of factors that\nare linked both to dental caries and lead\nexposure, residual confounding is likely\nto be problematic. However, we have\nattempted to adjust for the potential\nconfounding effect of socioeconomic\nstatus in our models, and the plausi-\nbility of these observations is strength-\nened by recent experimental data.\nWatson et al10 found that exposure\nto lead, prenatally and perinatally, re-\nsulted in a high rate of dental caries in\nlaboratory rats. In the study, female rats\nwere exposed to 34 ppm of lead in\ndrinking water as young adults, dur-\ning pregnancy, and during lactation.\nMaternal blood lead levels averaged\ning, experimental and control rat pups\nTable 4.

After 5\nweeks, pups born to the lead-exposed\nrats had significantly more dental car-\nies lesions than controls.\nThree different mechanisms can be\nhypothesized concerning lead expo-\nsure and dental caries: salivary gland\nfunction, enamel formation, and inter-\nference with fluoride in saliva. Wat-\nson et al10 showed differences in sali-\nvary gland function, which suggested\nthat exposure to lead during salivary\ngland development may have ad-\nversely affected the ability of the gland\nto produce adequate amounts of sa-\nliva. Saliva has several protective prop-\nerties that operate against caries: it acts\nas a buffering agent when acids are pro-\nduced,itphysicallyremovesdebrisfrom\ntooth surfaces, and it has immuno-\nlogic and bacteriostatic properties.23\nLead also incorporates into tooth struc-\nture before the tooth erupts into the\nmouth and this may result in defec-\ntive enamel that is more susceptible to\ncaries.24 Also, lead may interfere with\nthe bioavailability of fluoride by bind-\ning to fluoride ions in saliva and plaque,\nthereby reducing the preventive capac-\nity of fluoride to remineralize enamel\nafter an acid challenge.25\nThe cross-sectional nature of the\nNHANESIIIdataimposeslimitationson\ntheabilitytotestmechanism-specifichy-\npotheses. For example, if lead exposure\nat the time of enamel formation were the\nmost relevant mechanism for a lead-\ncariescausalassociation,onewouldneed\nto assume that current blood lead level\nis a good estimate of lead exposure dur-\ning early childhood when teeth are\nformed. In cross-sectional data, such as\nNHANES III, the most relaxed assump-\ntionswouldberequiredforarecenttem-\nporal effect if lead exposure status were\nsubject to change over time.\nThe present analysis supports the\nhypothesis that environmental lead ex-\nposure is a risk factor for dental caries.\nNonetheless, a mechanistic role to ex-\nplaindifferencesincariesprevalencehas\nnot been clearly established for lead. In\nsupport of a causal role for lead in den-\ntal caries, there are compelling experi-\nmental data from well-controlled ani-\nmal studies that support the biologic\nplausibilityofthehypothesisandwehave\nobserved a dose-response trend. Still, to\nsatisfy the criteria for causality, further\nprospectiveinvestigationswillbeneeded\nto demonstrate that lead exposure pre-\ncedes the development of caries in hu-\nmans after adequate control of poten-\ntial confounders and that these findings\nare consistent across different popula-\ntions and with different study designs.\nInconclusion,thesedatasuggestthat\nbloodleadlevelsareassociatedwithden-\ntalcariesintheUSpopulation.Thesedata\nfurtherindicatethatapproximately2.7\nmillion excess cases of dental caries in\nolder children and adolescents may be\nattributable to environmental lead ex-\nposure itself or a factor that is directly\nlinkedtoenvironmentalleadexposure.\nIfacausalassociationbetweenenviron-\nmental lead exposure and dental caries\nis substantiated, it would have impor-\ntant implications concerning the need\ntobroadenthefocusofhealthinterven-\ntions for dental caries beyond modify-\ning dietary habits, improving personal\noral hygiene behaviors, and increasing\nfluoride exposure in high-risk groups.\nFunding/Support: This research was supported by a\ngrant from the National Institute of Environmental\nNational Research Service Award from the Bureau of\nHealth Professions, Health Resources and Services Ad-\nREFERENCES\n1.
