Documentary research is widely used but little discussed in methodological literature and\nI show how my own methodological reflections arose from practical concerns with the use of documents. Social network\nanalysis as a formal technique has been little used and I show how my attempts to popularise it as a methodology also grew\nout of practical research concerns. These are the adventures of an accidental methodologist.\n",

In reflecting on this, I\ncame to appreciate all-too clearly that I had no intention ever\nto become a methodologist. I found echoes of this feeling in\ntwo other works that inspired my own title.\nPeter Berger (2011) recounts in his autobiography that,\nas a new immigrant to New York from Eastern Europe, and\nspeaking little English, he reasoned that the best way to find\nout about the society that he had entered was to enrol for a\ncourse of study in sociology. He found, in fact, that his soci-\nology course told him nothing at all about American society.\nInstead, he encountered expansive theoretical reflection\nfrom a strongly philosophical basis. To his surprise, he\nfound the study of abstract theory enjoyable and rapidly\ndecided to pursue these sociological interests. By accident\nhe had discovered something that was to take up a signifi-\ncant part of his career.\nGarry Runciman's (1989) reflections on sociological the-\nory, on the other hand, led him to describe himself as a\n`reluctant theorist'. His view was that theorising was neither\nenjoyable nor especially valuable in its own right but was\nsimply a necessary means to an end. In order to understand\nthe world, he reluctantly concluded, it was necessary to\nengage in theoretical debate about it.\nI share something of each of these views, though in relation\nto methodology rather than to theory. I found myself engaged\nin methodological debates by accident, having tried to under-\nstand real world problems. My involvement in methodology\nwas also a reluctant one, as I could see methodology as being\nimportant \u00ad to me at any rate \u00ad because it was a means to an\nend.\nDespite this serendipity and reluctance, I have come to be\nseen by some as a methodologist. This has shaped the invita-\ntions that I have received to write and speak on sociological\nmatters and it has helped to determine the direction in which\nmy empirical work has moved. Any sociologist knows that\nlabels are important means of social control and can lead to\nshifts in identity. This labelling has not shaped my self-per-\nception and so I have never identified myself as a method-\nologist. I have achieved this through what Peter Berger\ncalled role distance, a mechanism through which people are\nable to avoid the implications of the labels that are attached\nto them by virtue of their roles. The example given by\nBerger is the obsequious waiter in a restaurant who manages\nto convey the impression \u00ad at least to himself \u00ad that he is not\nreally the servile character that he appears on the surface to\nbe. My ultimate act of role distancing is, perhaps, the deliv-\nery of this lecture and its subsequent publication in a meth-\nodology journal.\nAdventures of an accidental methodologist\n Keywords\ndocumentary research, social network analysis\n1University of Essex, Colchester, UK\n2University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark\n3University of Exeter, Devon, UK\nCorresponding author:\nJohn Scott,\nContact via www.johnscottcbe.com\nOriginal Article\n2 Methodological Innovations\nThe beginnings of my methodological\ninterests\nI have been heavily involved in two areas of methodological\ndiscussion: documentary research and social network analy-\nsis. Each of these was a relatively underdeveloped area when\nI became involved and so much of the work that I did was\npioneering and innovative. It is difficult not to be an innova-\ntor when there are few competitors about. Because of the\nlack of competition in these areas my own work was particu-\nlarly visible to others, and this would not have been the case\nif I had written on, say, ethnography or survey methods. As a\nresult of my high visibility, I became closely identified with\nboth documentary research and social network analysis as\ninterest in them grew.\nBoth methodological interests arose during my earliest\nresearch. My first academic job was in Scotland during the\nearly 1970s. This was a time when the oil and gas fields of\nthe North Sea were being explored and developed, igniting\npolitical debates over devolution and independence with\nestimates of the wealth generated from the North Sea and the\nquestion of whether control over these resources would lie\nwith Scottish interests or English ones.\nMy own research interests were in social stratification and\nthis interest fused with these political debates for purely con-\ntingent reasons. First, I was asked by a colleague to contribute\na theoretical chapter to a book that he was editing on social\nclass in Scottish society. This got me thinking about stratifica-\ntion in a Scottish context and I decided to undertake a small\nstudy of the economic power of the Scottish upper class.\nSecond, and as a result of this, I was approached by the radi-\ncal student Rector of Edinburgh University to contribute a\nchapter on economic power to a book that he was editing and\nto be called The Red Paper on Scotland. The Rector \u00ad one\nGordon Brown, later to be a long-serving Labour Chancellor\nof the Exchequer and a short-serving Prime Minister \u00ad\nbrought together a number of then-radicals, including a later\nBusiness Secretary Vince Cable, to discuss aspects of Scottish\neconomic and political autonomy (Brown, 1975).\nI began a project, working jointly with Mike Hughes, that\naimed to investigate the structure of economic power in\nScotland through a study of ownership and control in its larg-\nest companies. This eventually appeared in a number of\npapers and a book (Scott and Hughes, 1980). In my later\nresearch, I extended this into a study of British society that\nwas undertaken as part of a comparative investigation\n(Stokman et al., 1985) and that I reported in a book that went\nThe Scottish project investigated the board-level posi-\ntions of company directors and the patterns of shareholding\nin these companies. The theoretical context was the debate\non the so-called managerial revolution through which share-\nholding owners were supposed to be replaced by salaried\ncareer managers as companies grew in size. Large corpora-\ntions, it was held, are no longer controlled by capitalists but\nby professional managers. To examine whether this was the\ncase, and to see whether the controllers had a Scottish or an\nEnglish background, we took up the theoretical and empiri-\ncal approach followed by C. Wright Mills and Paul Sweezy.\nFrom Mills, we took the idea of investigating the social back-\nground and recruitment patterns of company directors, their\nboard-level connections in so-called interlocking director-\nships, and the kinship links through which they might be\nconnected. From Sweezy, we took the idea of investigating\nthe identity and formation of groups and clusters of compa-\nnies subject to a common focus of control.\nDocumentary sources\nIn order to investigate these issues, we had to collect some\ndata and the obvious sources were the paper records of direc-\ntorships, families and companies that were published as\nyearbooks and stored in archives. The key archive was\nCompanies House in Edinburgh, where annual lists of share-\nholders are deposited and that can be examined for the names\nof large shareholders. The principal directories and year-\nbooks that were used were The Stock Exchange Yearbook\nand the Directory of Directors, the annual volumes of the\nbiographical reference book Who's Who, and the genealogi-\ncal directories Burke's Peerage and Burke's Landed Gentry.\nIn addition to these, we consulted the financial press and the\ngossip columns: at that time, the columns gave more atten-\ntion to aristocrats and businessmen than they did to TV\n`celebrities'.\nOur first step was to collect lists of names of directors and\nshareholders in the companies that were being studied. We\nhad little idea of what the problems might be and discovered\nthese problems only through doing the research. The major\nproblem was to identify lists of unique names of company\ndirectors. It was necessary, for example, to know whether the\nJ. Smith named as a director of Company A was the same\nperson as the John Smith named as a director of Company B.\nWe then had to discern whether either or both of these people\nwere the same as the John B. Smith named as a director of\nCompany C. Beyond this, it was important to recognise that\ndirectories collect data relating to each company's reporting\nperiod and so companies might list their directors on a vari-\nety of dates. As people may be awarded titles during the\ncourse of a year, it was necessary to see whether any of the J.\nSmiths we found were to be identified as the Sir John Smith\nwho sat on the board of Company D or the Lord Smith sitting\non Company E. Furthermore, any of these, or any of a num-\nber of other names, might be identical to the Lord Muck sit-\nting on Company F.\nHaving compiled a clean list of unique names, we went on\nto collect biographical information on family, education, and\ncareer background. It was immediately apparent that not all\nof the people that we listed were included in the biographical\ndirectories: the directories did not carry a complete census\nand they may not contain a representative sample. We had to\nestimate the extent of any bias among those selected by the\neditors of the directories. In using the Burke volumes, we had\nto face the problem that these were not then indexed and so it\nwas a time-consuming matter to trawl through the lengthy\nentries to see if particular names were included.\nThe collection of lists of shareholders raised similar\nproblems of identification but also involved further prob-\nlems because of the practice of using anonymous entries.\nAlthough many individuals and families listed shares in\ntheir own names, others held their shares through a bank\ntrust company and might appear as one of a number of\nanonymous bank accounts. Many banks used so-called\nnominee companies and miscellaneous bank accounts to\nregister the holding of large numbers of individuals. We\naimed to identify those accounts that related to particular\nindividuals or companies and to separate them from those\nthat were simply aggregations of small shareholders. This\ninvolved a great deal of correspondence with banks and\ncompany registrars and a number of visits to the Edinburgh\nand London financial districts to examine brass plates on\ncompany offices.\nFrom the lists that we eventually produced, we were able\nto generate statistical summaries and trend data. These were\nproduced from manual record cards that were sorted and\nresorted into piles on the floor carpet. The task became some-\nwhat easier in 1975 when I managed to invest in a first-gen-\neration `pocket' calculator. We also produced family trees of\nprominent families, drawn out on rolls of wallpaper because\nof the extensive lateral `cousinhood' relations that tied the\nvarious families together. Because of limitations on space,\nwe could only ever use sub-sections of these diagrams in our\npublications.\nThe problems of collecting and recording the data led me\nto reflect on the methods that I was using. There was very\nlittle in the way of methodological accounts that I could draw\non in working through the problems. Apart from some very\nearly work on letters and diaries such as the study by Thomas\nand Znaniecki, there were just three that seemed directly rel-\nevant. Colin Bell had written on the use of Who's Who as a\nsampling frame, while Ken Plummer had written on\nDocuments of Life, which he rightly insists is not about `doc-\numents' but about all ways of expressing and accounting for\nlife experiences. Most relevant was Jennifer Platt's two-part\nsummary of approaches to documents, but even this gave\nonly partial coverage of the issues that I had discovered in\nbuilding my data set.\nI decided that I needed to work through the problems\nmyself and in writing down these reflections I produced a\nbook that I hoped others would find useful. In A Matter of\nRecord (Scott, 1991), I compiled a four-element appraisal\ngrid for the assessment of documents on paper, stone, metal,\nfilm, audio or digital mediums. This grid identified four sets\nof questions that must be asked about any piece of documen-\ntary data before it can be used in a sociological, or historical,\nanalysis:\n1. Authenticity. Is the evidence genuine and of unques-\ntionable origin?\n2. Credibility. Is the evidence free from error and\ndistortion?\n3. Representativeness. Is the evidence typical of its kind\nand, if not, is the extent of its untypicality known?\n4. Meaning. Is the evidence clear and comprehensible?\nThe lack of competitors ensured that this particular meth-\nodological innovation found a ready audience. As a result of\nthe book's success, I started to become identified as an expert\non documentary research methods and was invited to present\nmy ideas at a number of lectures and workshops in Britain\nand overseas. I was also invited to contribute entries to an\nEncyclopaedia of Social Research Methods and a Dictionary\nof Social and Cultural Research, which further reinforced\nyears after the research had\nbegun, I was invited to prepare a landmark reference set of\narticles running to four volumes that brought together source\nmaterials and applications on handling documents in social\nSocial network analysis\nMeanwhile, back in 1974, I was trying to find ways of ana-\nlysing the data that had been collected. Initial analyses could\nreport statistical figures on the distribution of directorships\nand company shareholdings. We were able to show, for\nexample, that most directors held just one directorship, a sig-\nnificant number held two, and declining numbers held three,\nfour or more. The distribution of the numbers of director-\nships held, in each year that we studied, was an exponential\ndistribution. However, we wanted to go beyond such statisti-\ncal data to report directly on the structures of the relations\namong companies. I was aware of a number of attempts to\nconstruct diagrams of company connections. Many of these\nwere what I thought of as `spot the capitalist' diagrams pro-\nduced by radical publications that gave little indication of the\nmethods they had used to depict the data. Some work that\ntook a more systematic approach had begun to appear in\nstudies by Stanworth and Giddens, Whiteley, and Thomas,\nbut these were limited to very small subsets of companies\nand while they used the term `network analysis' to refer to\ntheir visualisations, they made little use of any formal tech-\nniques beyond simple measures of network `density'.\nMy school background in geography and my love of maps\nconvinced me that there must be ways of `mapping' large\ndata sets of 250 companies. I had also become involved with\nBob Blackburn and colleagues in a study of occupational\nstratification that used techniques of multidimensional scal-\ning and this, too, suggested ways of looking at company data.\nAlthough I could begin to draw diagrams on my trusty rolls\nof wallpaper, I was aware that this involved an arbitrary\nplacement of companies and rapidly dissolved into a thicket\nof intersecting lines that were impossible to inspect and\n4 Methodological Innovations\nanalyse. I began to experiment with other ways of presenting\nthe data.\nIn the Red Paper and the early articles and book, I used\nthree kinds of diagrams. First, I used simple network dia-\ngrams similar to those produced by Stanworth and Giddens.\nThese did, at least, bring out multiple links between compa-\nnies (shown by multiple lines) and allowed me to position\nthose with multiple links close to each other. This was no\ninnovation on existing methods.\nThe second kind of diagram I constructed was a circle dia-\ngram. In this, companies are placed around the circumference\nof a circle and the order is rearranged until the number of cross-\ning lines is minimised. This allows the identification of separate\nclusters and company groupings, but the position of the group-\nings around the circumference remained arbitrary.\nThe third kind of diagram was an artificial `artist's impres-\nsion' of the network in the form of a bubble diagram. In this\nkind of diagram, I relied on my assessment of the ways in\nwhich companies were grouped together and then used inter-\nsecting circles to try to show how these groups overlapped to\nproduce a structure of power in which regional and func-\ntional differences in structure could be visualised. While this\nmethod gave a clear picture of global network structure for a\nlarge data set, it relied on the researcher's assessment of sim-\nilarities and differences in patterns of connection.\nA step forward could be made only by using radically\nnovel methods. I realised that I had to enquire widely for a\nsolution to my problem. I wrote a short article subtitled `A\nCry For Help' that was published in the newsletter of the\nBritish Sociological Association (BSA) Quantitative\nSociology Group. The response to this, which I summarised\nin a short report, brought me into contact with other practi-\ntioners and real methodologists who had and were using\ncomputer software to address structural issues. I had availa-\nble to me a number of techniques that claimed to identify the\nimportant structural properties of networks: how was I now\nto choose among them?\nI knew that if I were to use a technique, I had to under-\nstand what it was doing and whether it was a sensible proce-\ndure to use for my data. I could not simply take a method for\ngranted and use it just because it produced results: any\nmethod might produce results and we need to know whether\nthe results are meaningful. I decided that I had to learn\nFORTRAN programming so that I could follow through the\nlogic of the algorithms and discover exactly what manipula-\ntions were being performed on the data. Poring over lengthy\ncomputer printouts and decoding punched cards, I was able\nto piece together a workable set of solutions for my data and\nbegan the analysis.\nThis part of the research was undertaken in the early 1980s\nwhen microcomputing was barely beginning. The software\navailable to me all worked on large mainframe computers.\nUsing some techniques in the GRADAP program that came\nto be used for a comparative study in which I participated, I\nprepared my data on punched card, transferred it to large reels\nof tape, and sent the tape to the Netherlands where Frans\nStokman oversaw the analysis of the data on the CDC Cyber\ncomputer for which the program had been written. Data runs\nwere long drawn-out processes and it took 2 or 3weeks before\nthe analyses were returned. The scope for re-analysis and the\ncorrecting of mistakes was rather limited. Nevertheless, I had,\nat last, real structural analyses of my data.\nFurther analysis, using a technique called blockmodel-\nling, relied on a program written by Clyde Mitchell to imple-\nment an algorithm called CONCOR. I had my own copy of\nthis program on a large set of punched cards. It was written\nin FORTRAN and was far more easily transportable from\none computer to another than was the machine-specific\nGRADAP. However, it was so demanding of computer\npower that there was just one computer in the United\nKingdom capable of running it with the large data set that I\nhad. This was the Cray Supercomputer at Manchester on\nwhich my own University at Leicester rented time each\nweek. Whenever I ran the CONCOR program, it used the\nwhole of the Leicester computer allocation for a week. Any\nsmall mistake in the data meant that I had to reinput the pro-\ngram the following week and this thoroughly hacked-off the\nphysicists who felt that a sociologist had no right to use a\ncomputer.\nThese techniques, eventually transferred to microcomput-\ners and working far more rapidly in the late 1990s, provided\nme with a set of concepts: density, centrality, cohesion,\ncliques and so on, and allowed me to represent the data visu-\nally. Having visualised the concepts in simple diagrams,\nhowever, it became possible to use the numbers output from\nthe program as shorthand descriptions of social structure.\nThe numbers allowed the researcher to imaginatively visual-\nise the structure of large networks.\nHaving arrived at a satisfactory way of analysing my data,\nI decided to write up the results of my methodological inves-\ntigations so that others could better understand their uses. I\nproduced some early reports and then a short handbook that\nhas now successfully gone through three editions. (Scott,\n1992) This success again led me into presenting at numerous\nlectures and workshops, to contributions to the Social Science\nEncyclopaedia and the Encyclopedia of the Social and\nBehavioural Sciences, and to the commissioning of specialist\npieces by real experts as Section Editor of the Encyclopedia\nof Complexity Science. I was also asked to produce a multi-\nvolume edited collection on methods and their applications\n(Scott, 2002). In cooperation with Peter Carrington and Stan\nWasserman, I edited a text on advanced methods of network\nanalysis (Carrington et al., 2005), and with Peter Carrington\nedited The Sage Handbook of Social Network Analysis (Scott\nand Carrington, 2011). One particular venture was the invita-\ntion to present on network analysis in Graham Crow's `What\nIs ...?'sessions at the Economic and Social Research Council\n(ESRC) Festival of Social Science on three occasions, and\nthis led to the production of a primer called What is Social\nReinventing the wheel\nAs a methodological innovator in uncharted methodological\nareas, I have been identified as an expert methodologist. This\nseems to be the fate of all who are seen as methodological\ninnovators. Recently, there has been much interest in the work\nof physicists who have claimed to have produced revolution-\nary innovations in social network analysis. What surprises\nthose of us who have even dabbled in network methodology\nis that their innovations have a rather familiar feel to them.\nAlberto-Lazlo Barab\u00e1si wrote in 2002 that physicists have\nbeen able to highlight phenomena that are `unprecedented\nand unexpected' in that they have discovered `a new and\nunsuspected order within networks'and have `lifted complex\nnetworks out of the jungle of randomness' (Barab\u00e1si, 2002).\nHe held that `For the first time in history scientists are begin-\nning to learn how to talk meaningfully about the architecture\nof networks'. Bold methodological innovation indeed! The\nobject of their innovation is the power law: the great discov-\nery that the distribution of connections in a network tends to\nfollow an exponential pattern.\nThis might sound familiar to readers of this article. I\nshowed that one of my earliest empirical findings was exactly\nthis: 30years before the great discovery made by the physi-\ncists. I plotted my data for a number of years and found\nexactly the same pattern of the power law. I also examined\nthe findings of a number of other studies in various countries\npublished since 1972, and these all showed the same expo-\nnential `power law' distribution.\nPhysicists would have received a more enthusiastic wel-\ncome from social network analysts if instead of ignoring eve-\nrything that we have done and reinventing the wheel in the\nname of an innovation they had recognised that they were\nbuilding on the bedrock of sociological achievements in net-\nwork analysis. This would have allowed a more rapid, and\nless begrudging, recognition of their real innovation, which\nis to try to explain why it is that the exponential distribution\noccurs in so many networks and to propose dynamic models\nof network evolution that can show the limits within which\n`six degrees of connection' and the power law hold.\nFuture identities?\nIt is for all of these reasons that I have emphasised that I am\nnot a methodologist. I am not an expert in methodology but\nsimply an enthusiastic amateur who has accidentally and\nreluctantly got involved in methodology because it helps me\nto understand the real world. Although I have exercised this\nrole distance, the identification is difficult to escape. I\nrecently received an invitation from a major publisher to edit\nan eight volume Encyclopaedia of Research Methods.\nAlthough the advance was attractive, I decided that I simply\ndid not have the all-round methodological expertise to carry\noff the task. I can blag my way in social network analysis and\ndocumentary research methods but pretending to cover the\nwhole area of social research methods is another matter.\nNevertheless, I did subsequently agree to produce a fourth\nedition of my text on Social Network Analysis, so my acci-\ndental adventures continue.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nBerger P (2011) Adventures of an Accidental Sociologist: How\nto Explain the World without Becoming a Bore.
