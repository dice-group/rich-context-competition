The demand\nfor oilseeds and vegetable oil has far exceeded the domestic output necessitating huge\nimports. Futures market helps to bring price stability for the development of the under-\nlying physical market. The present study investigates the volatility dynamics in spot\nand futures markets of select oil and oilseeds commodities.\nThe objectives of this article are to study (a) the information transmission process\nbetween spot and futures markets, also called volatility spillover and (b) the impact of\nfutures trading activity on the volatility of physical market prices.\nThe commodities selected from oil and oilseeds segment are refined soya oil, mustard\nseed, crude palm oil, and mentha oil. The study uses basic Generalized Autoregressive\nConditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model to capture volatility in prices of the\nselected commodities. Bivariate GARCH model makes use of information in the history\nof two different markets for testing volatility spillover between two markets of the same\nunderlying commodity.\nThe relationship between futures trading activity and spot price volatility is investi-\ngated for examining the impact of futures trading activity on the volatility of underlying\nspot market. Two variables, viz., futures trading volume and open interest are decom-\nposed into expected and unexpected components and are taken as a proxy for the level\nof trading activity. The contemporaneous and dynamic relationships are studied with\nthe help of augmented GARCH model and Granger causality, respectively.\nIt is observed that there is an efficient transmission of information between spot and\nfutures markets but it is the spot market which leads to the flow of information to futures\nand hence causes greater spillover of volatility. The spot market has a greater impact on\nthe volatility of futures market, indicating that informational efficiency of oilseeds spot\nmarket is stronger than that of the futures market.\nThe contemporaneous and dynamic relationship between spot price volatility and\nfutures trading activity tested with econometric models provide evidence of the dest-\nabilizing impact of an unexpected increase in futures trading activity (volume or open\ninterest) on the spot price volatility in three out of four commodities studied. This indi-\ncates that badly informed traders present in futures market are destabilizing the under-\nlying spot market by inducing noise and lowering the information content of prices.\nVIKALPA\nThe Journal for Decision Makers\nManagement, Ahmedabad\nSAGE Publications\nsagepub.in/home.nav\nhttp://vik.sagepub.com\nExecutive\nSummary\nOilseeds\nMentha Oil\nRefined Soya Oil\nCrude Palm Oil\nMustard Seed\nVolatility Spillover\nGARCH\nFutures Trading\nEdible oil and oilseeds sector occupies an impor-\ntant position in the agricultural economy of\n . Moreover,   holds the fifth position\nin the vegetable oil economy of the world, next only\nto USA, China, Brazil, and Argentina. The demand\nfor edible and non-edible oil is increasing due to\nthe growing  n population, rising income, and\nexpanding urbanization. The domestic demand for\nvegetable oils has increased more than the domestic\noutput, leading to a rise in the import bill. According to\na data collected by the Solvent Extractors' Association\noils worth INR 562.95 billion were imported consti-\ntuting about half of  's total edible oil consump-\nhuge current account deficit. At the end of the 12th Five\nYear Plan, the edible oil requirement of the country is\nexpected to be 16.34 million tonnes while the produc-\nAt present, oilseeds account for 13 per cent of the gross\ncropped area, 3 per cent of the gross national product,\nand 10 per cent value of all agricultural commodi-\nties (Ramanathan, 2001). Crude palm oil and Refined,\nBleached and Deodorized (RBD) palm oil together\nconstitute 77 per cent of our consumption while the\nshare of soya bean oil is 12 per cent. Despite being one\nof the largest oilseeds producers in the world, 50 per\ncent of  's domestic requirement is met through\nimports. Prices of edible oils in the international market\nare more competitive. This together with nearly duty-\nfree import structure has facilitated larger imports in\n . Imports have also increased the per capita avail-\nThe growth rate of domestic oilseeds production has\nbeen a meagre two per cent, year on year (Jha et al.,\n2012). The oilseeds industry faces challenges in terms\nof institutional and technological barriers. Cultivation\nof oilseeds is dependent on rainfall due to which there\nis high instability in production. Because of this uncer-\ntainty, it is cultivated on marginal lands which further\nleads to low yields. The problem is aggravated by the\nabsence of technological advancement to develop high-\nyielding varieties of oilseeds. The domestic prices of\noilseeds and edible oils are un-remunerative for farmers\nand the sector has been sustaining on government\nsubsidies. Unless substantial improvement is brought\nabout in yields and processing of oilseeds, facilitated\nwith conducive trade policies,  's dependence on\nimports is likely to be high.\nOn the global front, as per the OECD-FAO (2011) projec-\ntions, prices in oilseeds complex will continue to trend\nupwards due to tightening in global supplies caused\nby high marginal cost of area expansion, profitability\nof competing crops, and environmental constraints.\nOn the other hand, resumption in demand after the\nglobal economic crisis and robust buying by importing\ncountries has resulted in wide demand-supply gap\nand fall in global stock to use ratio. It is estimated that\nthe developing countries in Asia, mainly China, will\ncontinue to show an increase in vegetable oil consump-\ntion. Growth in consumption of vegetable oils in China\nand   is primarily for food use whereas in the US\nand the EU, biodiesel industry will be the main demand\ndriver. Biodiesel production is expected to account for\n16 per cent of the total consumption of vegetable oils.\nHence, fundamental constraints of demand and supply\nmismatch, along with technological, environmental,\nand other social challenges faced by the oilseeds\ncommodity chain have put pressure on the govern-\nment, traders, and investors to combat expected price\nvolatility and take appropriate measures for a more\nrobust oilseeds sector. Local market prices are under\npressure due to low stocks, anaemic domestic produc-\ntion, and dependence on imports.\nThe government has tried to bring price stability\nthrough market intervention. But such practices create\nuncertainties for cultivators and traders with respect\nto long-term strategies and ultimately affect the price\nstructure of oilseeds relative to their competing crops.\nTherefore, forward-looking policies are needed to\nencourage stakeholders to continue cultivation and\ntrading. Among other reforms, price risk mitigation\ninstruments in the form of derivative contracts go a\nlong way in improving the status of the stakeholders.\nThe introduction of futures trading in oilseeds segment\nhas resulted in better price realization to the farmers.\nOilseeds futures contracts are the most liquid counters\non commodity bourses. However, the impact of futures\ntrading on the volatility of the underlying spot market\nis a debatable issue since on many occasions physical\nmarket prices have exhibited heightened volatility in\nthe presence of high trading volume in futures market.\nThe present study investigates the volatility dynamics\nof spot and the futures market of select oil and oilseeds\ncommodities. Theoretically, speculative activity in the\nfutures market is purported to have two opposing\neffects on the spot price volatility:\nFutures Trading Stabilizes Spot Market Prices\nSpot traders are able to hedge their positions only\nbecause of additional liquidity that comes from the\nspeculators present in the futures market. Additional\nliquidity in futures market reduces the impact cost or\nthe cost of executing a transaction since the buyers\nand sellers constantly have opportunities for buying\nand selling in the futures market at a reasonable cost.\nIn the absence of liquidity, they face high transaction\ncost. A liquid futures market enables traders with\nphysical possession of the commodity to hedge against\nunfavourable movements in prices. The risk is trans-\nferred from hedgers to speculators who are willing to\ntake the risk to earn more profits. Since risk is trans-\nferred, spot price volatility may reduce because the\nneed to incorporate risk premium in spot prices is elim-\ninated (Figlewski, 1981). Speculation in futures market\nwill not destabilize the prices if the speculators are a\nwell-informed lot. They will buy when the prices are\nlow, pushing them up, and sell when the prices are\nhigh, pulling them down and eventually lead the prices\nto their mean level. Therefore, such profitable specula-\ntion reduces spot market volatility.\nFutures Trading Destabilizes Spot Market Prices\nFutures trading may be considered to increase spot\nprice volatility because any news about changes in\nfundamentals is assimilated in futures prices more\nreadily as they are more informationally efficient.\nThrough the arbitrage process, the price changes are\ntransmitted to the spot market of the same underlying\ncausing the volatility to increase. The presence of unin-\nformed speculators brings in herd behaviour in the\nmarkets making them more volatile. Market manip-\nulation and fraudulent activities are easier to perpe-\ntrate in futures market. By building large positions in\nfutures markets, speculators are able to capture the\nmarket and manipulate and influence future price.\nFormation of cartels and trading through related enti-\nties is also prevalent wherein futures market players\ncollude with spot market traders and hoard physical\nstocks. It creates artificial scarcity of the commodity\nresulting in price distortion.\nVolatility and Information: Study of Volatility\nSpillover\nThe volatility of asset prices is also related to the infor-\nmation flow in the market. Spot price volatility is bound\nto change if the informationally efficient futures market\nincreases transmission of information. The volatility\nin returns manifests that information is flowing in the\nmarket. The increase in spot price volatility in the pres-\nence of futures trading reflects that there is improved\nflow of information brought about by a large number of\ntraders and speculators participating in futures market.\nIf futures market leads in the process of transmission\nof information, it will cause spillover of volatility to\nthe spot market. In this context, the reverse is also true\nif spot market is more efficient in the transmission of\ninformation.\n n futures markets have faced allegations due to\nits destabilizing impact on the physical market vola-\na few agricultural commodities (wheat, urad, tur, and\nrice) were suspended due to increase in food grain\ninflation during that period. Since futures trading has\nbeen blamed for increasing the spot price volatility, the\nfollowing issues have been empirically investigated in\nthe present study:\n1. Volatility spillover from futures to spot market or\nvice versa.\n2. Impact of futures trading activity on spot price\nvolatility by examining the relationship between\nspot price volatility, futures trading volume, and\nopen interest.\nThe diverse views on the impact of futures market\nvolatility on the volatility of spot markets have been\nexplored by academicians, researchers, and policy\nmakers to evaluate the past performance and chart\nthe path for a more efficient and vibrant derivatives\nmarkets of commodities and financial products. Studies\nwhich have made a notable contribution in this area are\ndiscussed briefly.\nVolatility Spillover\nWhen volatility of one market influences the volatility\nof another market, volatility spillover occurs. It helps\nin identifying the market which leads to the assimila-\ntion of information and transmission of the information\nto the other market. With increased inflow of informa-\ntion in one market, its volatility increases, and due to the\narbitrage process, volatility spills over to the other\nrelated market. Liao and Williams (2004) pointed out\nthat news or volatility is transmitted through two chan-\nnels. The first is the increase in the volatility of variance\nof returns or price changes and the second is the increase\nin volatility of variance of forecast error or noise.\nVolatility spillovers from one market to another occur\nbecause of the fact that speculative price changes are\nlinked with higher moment dependencies (Bollerslev,\nChou, & Kroner, 1992). According to Chan, Chan, and\nKarolyi (1991), volatility spillovers can provide an alter-\nnative measure of information transmission if the return\nanalysis becomes inconclusive. Therefore, the study\nof the relationship between spot and futures returns\n(first moment) is expanding towards examining higher\nmoment dependencies in the form of time varying spill-\nover of volatility between markets through which the\nimpact of one market on another can be assessed. The\nhypothesis in volatility spillovers is to test the lead\u00adlag\nrelation in volatilities of two or more markets.\nResearch on how volatility of one market affects the\nprocess of the volatility of another market, that is, the\nstudy of the volatility spillover effect, has made use of\nGARCH family models which best capture the time\nvarying nature of volatility in financial markets. Named\nas `meteor showers', the theory of volatility spillovers\nbetween markets based on GARCH models was intro-\nstudied the intraday volatility spillover between S & P\n500 stock index and stock index futures market using\nbivariate GARCH model. Strong dependence in the\nvolatility of price changes in cash and futures market\nwas observed in their study as compared to dependence\nin price changes themselves. Though the relationship\nbetween cash to futures returns provided some predict-\nability, a stronger relationship was observed between\ncash market and futures market volatility. The results\nhave an important implication that due to inter-market\nvolatility dependence, it is possible to predict the vola-\ntility of a market on the basis of price innovations or\nshocks that originate in the other market. Koutmos\nand Tucker (1996) applied the Exponential GARCH\n(EGARCH) model to daily data to study volatility spill-\nover and asymmetric effect of volatility. Their findings\nindicated that volatility spillover was from futures to\nspot market and in both markets volatility increased\nmore with bad news compared to good news. Spot\nmarket innovations had no impact on futures market.\nTse (1999) observed bidirectional volatility spillover in\nDow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) spot and futures\nmarket on analysing minute by minute data using the\nbivariate EGARCH model. However, DJIA futures\nexhibited greater informational efficiency as spillover\nwas more from futures to spot market.\nMukherjee and Mishra (2006) studied volatility spill-\nover in Nifty spot and futures index market in  \nand examined whether there was any variation in the\nrelationship at the time of the release of macroeco-\nnomic and firm-specific information. The authors intro-\nduced a dummy variable representing the release of\ndifferent information, for example, activities of Foreign\nInstitutional Investors (FIIs), Mutual Funds (MFs) or\nasset acquisition and disposal. The results exhibited\nthat in general there was bi-directional volatility spill-\nover but the direction of causality was stronger from\nspot to futures market. The analysis of the impact of\nthe release of firm-specific information on the lead\u00ad\nlag relationship in volatility of NIFTY spot and futures\nindex indicated that the leading role of futures market\nwas weak after the release of firm-specific informa-\ntion. In order to capture the asymmetric behaviour\nof volatility and test the volatility spillover effect on\nindividual stocks and their futures traded on NSE,\nEGARCH model was applied by Mallikarjunappa and\nAfsal (2010). Their study reported findings similar to\nKarmakar (2009) that both markets were information\nefficient but futures market caused greater volatility\nspillover to spot market for the majority of stocks.\nHowever, for a few stocks, the reverse was true.\nUnderstanding of the volatility transmission process\nin commodities helps the decision makers in devising\nnew risk-management strategies. The information\ntransmission process between Malaysian crude palm\noil futures and its cash market at mean and volatility\nand Shannon (2007) using bivariate Autoregressive\nMoving Average EGARCH (ARMA-EGARCH) model.\nThe analysis revealed bidirectional volatility spillover\nbetween futures and cash market with the impact from\nfutures to cash being stronger than cash to futures.\nBidirectional volatility spillover in crude oil futures and\ncash market was also reported in studies by Chan et\nAdopting similar methodology, Mahalik, Acharya, and\nBabu (2009) examined volatility spillover in four spot\nand futures indices of Multi Commodities Exchange\n(MCX), namely agriculture, energy, metal futures price\nindex, and aggregate commodity index from 2005 to\n2008. The results of bivariate EGARCH for testing vola-\ntility spillover gave an indication of bidirectional vola-\ntility spillover with greater strength from futures to spot\nmarket for metal, energy, and aggregate commodity\nindex. However, in the case of agriculture index, spot\nmarket was a source of volatility for futures market\npointing to the fact that agriculture futures market was\nnot being used by farmers because of lack of incentives,\nlow quality of technology, or risk of relying on unjusti-\nfied rising prices perpetrated by speculators. This was\ncontrary to the results of volatility spillover studied by\nSrinivasan and Ibrahim (2012) on similar indices. Using\nsimilar bivariate EGARCH model, it was observed\nthat there was a stronger volatility spillover from spot\nto futures markets represented by agriculture, metal,\nenergy, and composite commodity indices and, there-\nfore, traders in futures market would have to watch\nout for the volatility in the spot market. Srinivasan and\nIbrahim (2012) applied the same methodology on gold\nspot and futures and revealed a greater ability of gold\nspot market in exposing new information through its\nchannels of innovation, and at the same time, pointing\nto less effectiveness of futures market in disseminating\nnew information. Shihabudheen and Padhi (2010)\ntested volatility spillover on highly liquid commodi-\nties traded on MCX and NCDEX including gold, silver,\ncrude oil, castor seed, jeera (cumin seed), and sugar.\nExcept for sugar, in all other commodities, the direction\nof volatility spillover was from futures to spot market.\nLow trading volume in sugar contract was likely to\nhave caused lack of transmission of information from\nfutures to the spot market. Dey, Maitra, and Roy (2011)\nfound evidence of bidirectional volatility spillover\nwith a greater spill from spot to futures. In the  n\ncontext, except for a few exceptions, spot market has\nbeen found to be dominant in the majority of studies on\nagricultural commodities.\nImpact of Futures Trading Activity on Spot Price\nVolatility\nEarlier studies on the impact of futures trading on cash\nprice volatility focused on the paradigm of the introduc-\ntion of futures trading. They compared cash price vola-\ntility before and after the introduction of futures trading\n(Gulen & Mayhew, 2000). However, market behaviour\nis influenced by a number of factors and so it is wrong\nto attribute the differences in market behaviour pre-\nand post-futures to the presence of futures market. As\npointed out by Stein (1987), the impact of more or less\nspeculation from an established futures trading on cash\nmarket volatility is far more relevant to the real world\nthan to the introduction of futures market. Researchers\nlike Bessembinder and Seguin (1992) and Adrangi and\nChatrath (1998) examined the issue in a different manner\nand analysed how the level of futures trading activity\n(futures trading volume and open interest) affected the\nvolatility of cash market prices.\nFiglewski (1981) modelled the volatility in Government\nNational Mortgage Association (GNMA) pass-through\ncertificates, cash prices by incorporating factors like\nvolatility in related markets, futures market activity in\nthe form of open interest and current trading volume,\nGNMA prices, liquidity, and breadth of GNMA cash\nmarket. By performing simple regression analysis,\nevidence was found that increased liquidity, volume\nof cash market activity, and lower average prices had\na stabilizing impact on the market whereas futures\nmarket activity increased the price volatility. The\npossible explanation for this was that GNMA dealers in\ncash market were more informed than the new class of\ntraders in futures market who were less informed and\nless experienced than the spot market dealer. Hence,\nthe additional noise in futures prices was being trans-\nmitted to cash market causing increased volatility.\nBessembinder and Seguin (1992) studied the interrela-\ntionship between equity volatility and futures trading\nactivity along with spot trading volume for S&P 500\ntrading activity which included trading volume and\nopen interest were separated into unexpected and\nexpected component using Autoregressive Integrated\nMoving Average (ARIMA) (0, 1, 10) formulation.\nRegression results for daily S&P 500 return standard\ndeviation on the spot and future trading volume indi-\ncated that equity volatility had a positive relation with\ncontemporaneous futures trading shocks or the unex-\npected component of futures trading activity, meaning\nthereby that heavy trading in futures market is destabi-\nlizing. However, there was a negative relation between\nexpected open interest and expected trading volume\nindicating that equity volatility was reduced when\nthe expected level of trading activity was high. Their\nfindings that futures trading helped in improving the\ndepth and liquidity of equity markets were consistent\nwith the theories such as Grossman (1988). Studies by\nalso found evidence of a decrease in spot index price\nvolatility after the introduction of index futures.\nFollowing Bessembinder and Senguin's methodology,\nChatrath, Song, and Adrangi (2003) re-examined the\nimpact of futures trading activity on spot price volatility\nof S&P 500 index. The study found strong evidence of\nan increase in price volatility with the increase in partic-\nipation of institutional traders, whereas there was no\nevidence of a destabilizing impact of positions held by\nspeculators and small traders.\nThe response to trading in commodity futures has\nbeen more intense as compared to equities because\ncommodity prices are very sensitive for the agricul-\ntural and industrial sectors in an economy. Commodity\nfutures markets, often accused of speculation and\ngambling, have faced opposition from various\nsegments especially the farm sector. Pashigian (1986)\nmeasured geographic opposition from grain traders\ntowards futures trading and suggested that opposi-\ntion had diminished over time. The study by Weaver\nand Banerjee (1990) did not support the hypoth-\nesis that futures trading led to dynamic instability in\ncattle prices, even though it could not be inferred that\nthey gave stability to cash prices. Yang, Balyeat, and\nLeatham (2005) applied the methodology earlier used\nby Bessembiner and Senguin (1992) on corn, soya bean,\nwheat, cotton, sugar, hogs, and live cattle data from\nfutures trading activity since the impact of expected\ncomponent was already embedded in the spot prices.\nThe results indicated that unexpected futures trading\nactivity (open interest and trading volume) caused\ncash price volatility, thus strengthening the ground for\ngrowing criticism towards commodity futures for their\nrole in aggravating price volatility.\nNot many  n studies have used this methodology\nin the commodities market, wherein futures trading\nactivity is linked to spot volatility. A recent study\nby Sehgal, Rajput, and Dua (2012) examined the\nperiod after the setting up of national level commodity\nexchanges in   which gave momentum to comm-\nodity futures trading. The destabilizing effect of futures\ntrading activity on spot volatility was indicated by\nGranger causality flowing from futures trading activity\nto spot volatility for all commodities except pepper\nand barley.\nHence, what emerges from the discussion of empir-\nical studies is that though futures trading has been in\nexistence for many years, its impact on spot volatility\nhas been inconclusive. A few prominent studies, which\nhave reported the destabilizing role of futures trading\non spot markets volatility, are by Figlewski (1981),\nChatrath, Ramchander, and Song (1996), Adrangi\nal. (2012). Some studies have, on the contrary, found\nevidence that trading in futures market does not dest-\nabilize the spot market (Bohl & Stephan, 2012; Darrat\n1990). In  , research is still very limited in the area\nof agricultural commodities especially oil and oilseeds\nsegment which makes it all the more pertinent to\nexplore these issues empirically especially when the\nmodern research tools are more robust and capable of\ncapturing the changing trends of market variables.\nThe commodities selected from the oil and oilseeds\nsegment are refined soya oil, mustard seed, crude palm\noil, and mentha oil. Details of the study period and\nthe commodity exchange from which data is taken are\nshown in Table 1.\nTable 1: Profile of Commodities Selected\nName of\nCommodity Exchange Time Period\nNo. of\nObservations\nSpot\nMarket\nRefined soya\nMentha oil MCX\nCrude palm\noil MCX\nMustard seed NMCE\nSource: Authors' Estimation.\nDaily closing spot and near months futures prices have\nbeen converted into log returns to reduce the effect of\nheteroscedasticity. It has been done by taking the first\ndifference of spot and futures log prices called loga-\nrithmic returns. Log transformation by taking first\ndifference of log prices helps in making a non-stationary\nseries as stationary and valid conclusions can be drawn\nfrom analysis of stationary data.\nR\nt\n= In [P\nt\n/P\n],\nwhere P represents the closing spot/futures price of the\nrespective commodities on a particular day and R\nt\nis\nthe rate of return for a day.\nIn addition to daily spot and futures prices, data on\nfutures trading activity has been used to study the\nimpact of futures trading on spot prices volatility.\nFollowing the methodology adopted by Bessembinder\nYang et al. (2005), the components of futures trading\nactivity, viz. futures trading volume and open interest\nhave been used as explanatory variables and their data\nis downloaded from the exchange itself. Both these\nvariables are indicative of the behaviour of futures\nmarket participants. While futures trading volume\nreflects movements due to speculators activity, open\ninterest movements primarily reflect hedgers activity\nIf the variables being examined are stationary, that is,\ntheir mean and variance are constant over time, the\nregression analysis done would provide time invariant\nand efficient estimates. However, most of the macro\neconomic and financial time series data exhibit random\nwalks and are found to be non-stationary. Regression\nanalysis done with non-stationary variables leads\nto spurious results which might produce misleading\ninferences about the degree of association between the\nvariables and the estimated parameters. If two-time\nseries are non-stationary in levels but their first differ-\nences are stationary, they are said to be integrated of\norder one and denoted as I(1). The spot and futures\nlog price series of each commodity are first subject\nto Augmented Dickey\u00adFuller (ADF) test (Dickey &\nFuller, 1979) to determine whether they are I(1). The\ntest checks for the presence of unit root and if detected,\nthe log prices are differenced to remove unit root and\nmake them stationary. This gives spot and futures\nreturn series.\nVolatility Spillover: Bivariate GARCH (1, 1) Model\nThe present study uses basic GARCH model to capture\nvolatility in prices of the selected commodities. First, an\nautoregressive moving average (ARMA) model of spot\nand futures return series is formulated. The conditional\nmean equation of spot and futures returns has been\nspecified as an ARMA (p, q) process. An ARMA (p, q)\nmodel associated with Box and Jenkins (1976) is one in\nwhich current value of a dependent variable depends\non its own past values plus the current and past values\nof white noise error terms. The autocorrelation and\npartial autocorrelation functions of residual from the\nmodel are examined using Ljung Box (LB) Q statistics\ndeveloped by Box and Pierce (1970). LB Q statistic tests\nwhether a series is white noise and is useful in testing\nserial dependencies in time. It follows chi-square distri-\nbution with the null hypothesis that all autocorrelation\ncoefficients are zero and there is no autocorrelation.\nFor volatility analysis, in order to apply GARCH\nmodel, the presence of Autoregressive Conditional\nHeteroscedasticity (ARCH) effect is first tested to see\nif the data series exhibit features of heteroscedasticity\nand volatility clustering. The presence of ARCH effect\nconnotes autocorrelation in volatility, that is, the condi-\ntional variance of error terms depends on the value of\nimmediately preceding squared error. ARCH effect is\nexamined with the help of autocorrelation and partial\nautocorrelation of the squared residuals from the esti-\nmated ARMA (p, q) model. The LB Q statistics of\nsquared residuals is observed for this. The joint null\nhypothesis being, coefficients of all lags of squared\nresiduals are statistically not different from zero. If the\nvalue of test statistics is greater than the critical value\nderived from chi-square distribution, it leads to the\nrejection of the null hypothesis of `no autocorrelation\nin squared residuals' and hence confirms the presence\nof ARCH effect.\nARCH effect in residuals of ARMA(p, q) model has also\nbeen tested with ARCH Lagrange multiplier (LM) test.\nIf the computed test value exceeds the critical value, it\nleads to the rejection of the null hypothesis of `no auto-\ncorrelation' in squared residuals. If ARMA (p, q) model\nreports no autocorrelation in residuals and ARCH LM\ntests reports the presence of ARCH effect, the authors\nfurther proceed to formulate GARCH (1, 1) model so\nthat spot and futures price volatility can be modelled.\nIn the present study, bivariate GARCH (1, 1) model\ndeveloped by Bollerslev (1986) has been used as it has\nbeen found to be the most parsimonious representa-\ntion of ARCH class of models and acceptability of the\norder has been proven empirically in many studies\nemploying time series data. Higher order GARCH\n(p, q) specification very often has many local maxima\nand minima and therefore basic GARCH model beats\nthe higher order models. `GARCH model predicts that\nthe best indicator of future variance is the weighted\naverage of long-run variance, the predicted variance\nfor the current period, and any new information in this\nperiod, as captured by squared residuals' (Engle, 2001).\nAfter formulating GARCH (1, 1) model for each of\nthe series, ARCH LM test is run again on the resid-\nuals of the model to check if the ARCH effect has been\nremoved by the model. As a part of the diagnostic\ncheck, LB test is also run on standardized residuals\nand squared standardized residuals. If ARCH effect is\nno more present in the residuals, it is an indication\nthat the model is an adequate fit and can be used for\nvolatility spillover analysis. Bivariate GARCH model\nmakes use of information in the histories of two\ndifferent markets and can be used in testing volatility\nspillover between two markets of the same under-\nlying commodity.\nThe residuals from GARCH (1, 1) model of spot and\nfutures return series are then squared to ensure that\nvariance is positive. We now have two series:\n1. Squared residuals of GARCH (1, 1) equation of spot\nreturns.\n2. Squared residuals of GARCH (1, 1) equation of\nfutures returns.\nThe squared residuals of a market are used as a proxy\nfor shocks emanating in one market and are introduced\nin the volatility equation of the other market to test the\nvolatility spillover from one market to the other. The\nmodel framed for testing volatility spillover is:\ns e s\nt spot s s t s t fut fut\nc a b squaredresiduals\n,\n  \n= + + + ( )\n- -\ns e s\nt fut f f t f t spot spot\nc a b squaredresiduals\n,\n  \n= + + + ( )\n- -\nY      \nwhere c c a a b b\ns f s f s f\n, , ,\n,\n  ,\n \nVolatility of the current period is measured as a lag of\nsquared residuals of the previous period derived from\nthe mean equation, that is, e\n2 , last period's forecast\nvariance from the model, that is, s\n , and the squared\nresiduals of the other market. If the coefficient of Y\nfut\nis statistically significant in the volatility equation of\nspot returns, it is an indication of volatility spillover\nfrom futures to spot market, and if Y\nspot\n is statistically\nsignificant in the volatility equation of futures returns,\nit means that spot market is spilling some volatility to\nthe futures market. If both the coefficients are statis-\ntically significant, there is a bidirectional spillover of\nvolatility and the magnitude of the spillover coefficient\ndetermines which market is causing more impact of\nvolatility on the other market.\nRelationship between SpotVolatility, Futures Trading\nVolume, and Open Interest\nThe issue of stabilizing or de-stabilizing impact of\nfutures trading is generally investigated from two\nperspectives: (a) examining the volatility of spot prices\nbefore and after the introduction of futures trading and\n(b) examining the relationship between futures trading\nactivity and spot price volatility. The second method-\nology has been followed in this study since it gives a\nmore interesting perspective to the study of the impact\nof futures trading by incorporating other factors which\ninfluence the market behaviour rather than just attrib-\nuting the differences in market behaviour pre- and\npost-futures to the presence of futures market. A few\nstudies, known for such kind of analysis, are Figlewski\nThe spot price volatility is modelled as a GARCH\n(1, 1) process as it captures the time varying nature\nof volatility. GARCH variance series is generated\nfrom E-Views and used as cash price volatility series.\nTwo variables, viz., futures trading volume and open\ninterest have been taken as the proxy for the level of\ntrading activity. As pointed by Leuthold (1983), daily\nfutures trading volume is largely indicative of specula-\ntive activity since the transaction of hedgers constitute\nonly a small proportion of trading volume. However,\nsince open interest represents trading positions which\nare longer than intraday positions, open interest data\non an average captures activity of hedgers. This inter-\npretation is also consistent with the studies of Working\nBoth series are first examined for stationarity with ADF\nunit root test. If the trading volume and open interest\nseries are not stationary, then the first difference is\ntaken which eliminates unit root problem and the anal-\nysis is done on the series which is integrated of the first\norder, that is, I(1).\nFollowing the methodology of Adrangi and Chatrath\n(1998), the expected and unexpected components of\ntradingvolumeandopeninterestaredecomposedusing\nHodrick\u00adPrescott (HP) filter (Hodrick & Prescott, 1997).\nPartitioning the series into expected and unexpected\ncomponents helps in examining the heterogeneous\neffects of anticipated versus surprise component of\ntrading activity (Bessembinder & Senguin, 1992).\nDecomposition of the unexpected component with\nHP filter produces results which are similar to those\nobtained by taking the difference of actual series\nand those fitted with ARIMA model. There is a high\ncorrelation between the expected and permanent\ncomponents derived from HP-filter and those calcu-\nlated with ARIMA model (Adrangi & Chatrath, 1998).\nSeries of expected futures trading volume and open\ninterest are then generated as the difference of actual\nseries and the unexpected component. ADF unit root\ntest is run again on the four series, viz., expected futures\ntrading volume (ETV), unexpected futures trading\nvolume (UTV), expected open interest (EOI), and unex-\npected open interest (UOI). The relationship between\nspot returns volatility modelled as GARCH variance\nseries and trading activity variables is examined with\nmodels discussed below:\n1. Contemporaneous association between futures trading\nactivity (volume and open interest) and spot price vola-\ntility (Bessembinder & Seguin, 1992; Chen, Cuny,\nraneous relationship is examined by formulating\nAugmented GARCH model developed by Duan\n(1997) which allows the addition of explanatory\nvariables in the GARCH specification for condi-\ntional variance. The expected and unexpected\ncomponents of futures trading activity are included\nas the exogenous variables in GARCH (1, 1) model\nof the spot returns (Lamoureux & Lastrapes, 1990).\nThe augmented GARCH model is represented as\nfollows:\ns a a e b s g d q w\nt\ni\np\ni t\nj\nq\nj t t t t t\n= + + + + + +\n=\n-\n=\n-\n\u00e5 \u00e5\n \ng d q w\nt t t t\n+ + + +  (3)\nwhere ETV\nt\nis the expected futures trading volume at\ntime t, UTV\nt\nis the unexpected futures trading volume\nat time t, EOI\nt\nis the expected open interest at time t,\nand UOI\nt\nis the unexpected open interest at time t.\nThe significance and sign of futures trading\nactivity variables will determine if spot volatility\nis influenced positively or negatively by trading\nvolume and open interest.\n2. Dynamic relationship by temporal ordering of spot price\nvolatility and futures activity variables so that the lead\nor the lag that is identified can ascertain whether\ncausality flows from futures trading activity to\nspot volatility or in the reverse direction (Adrangi\n& Chatrath, 1998; Chatrath, Ramchander, & Song,\nAccording to the rational expectation theory, informa-\ntion contained in the expected component of futures\ntrading is to a large extent already reflected in the cash\nprices. Therefore, only the unexpected components of\nfutures trading activity are examined for determining\ncausality as they indicate unusual levels of trading\nactivity associated with speculative positions that\nmay be destabilizing. With the objective of studying\nthe dynamic relationship between unexpected open\ninterest and unexpected liquidity in the futures market\nand underlying spot market volatility, Granger (1969)\ncausality test has been used. Granger causality ascer-\ntains causal link in two variables and has been used in\nthe present study to determine whether the increase in\nfutures trading activity leads to increase in cash market\nvolatility or vice versa.\nTo test Granger causality between unexpected liquidity/\nunexpected trading volume or unexpected open interest\nand cash price volatility, the following specifications\nare used:\nCV c a CV b UTV\nt t\ni\np\ni t i\nj\nq\nj t j t\n= + + +\n=\n-\n=\n-\n\u00e5 \u00e5\n  \n,\nUTV c a UTV b CV\nt t\ni\np\ni t i\nj\nq\nj t j t\n= + + +\n=\n-\n=\n-\n\u00e5 \u00e5\n  \n,\nCV c a CV b UOI\nt t\ni\np\ni t i\nj\nq\nj t j t\n= + + +\n=\n-\n=\n-\n\u00e5 \u00e5\n  \n,\nUOI c a UOI b CV\nt t\ni\np\ni t i\nj\nq\nj t j t\n= + + +\n=\n-\n=\n-\n\u00e5 \u00e5\n  \n,\nEquations (4) and (5) ascertain the causality between\nUTV and cash returns volatility (CV) while equations (6)\nand (7) ascertain causality between UOI and CV, i, being\nthe number of lags chosen for each variable by framing\nvector autoregressive model (VAR), and fixing the\nnumber of lags on the basis of minimization of AIC or\nSchwarz information criterion (SIC) criteria whichever\nreports lesser lags for a more parsimonious analysis.\nInference about destabilizing impact of futures trading\ncan be drawn if the contemporaneous coefficient of\nUTV or UOI in Augmented GARCH is significant and\npositive and lagged coefficients of UTV or UOI are\nsignificant in Granger causality test specification indi-\ncating that causality is flowing from unexpected futures\nvolume/open interest to spot volatility. In this respect,\nexamining the signs of statistically significant param-\neters in the VAR will provide additional information\nabout their relationship.\nTable 2 reports the unit root test results of spot and\nfutures series. The results indicate that spot and futures\nprices at levels are non stationary as the ADF test statis-\ntics is greater than the critical value at 5 per cent signif-\nicance level. However, in the first difference of log\nprices, that is, log returns, the null hypothesis of unit\nroot is rejected. Therefore, futures and spot log prices\nof all commodities are integrated of the first order, that\nis, I(1) and the returns being stationary are used for\nfurther analysis.\nThe order of ARMA model, which minimizes the infor-\nmationcriteria,isselectedfortheconditionalmeanequa-\ntions of both spot and futures returns (results forARMA\nand ARMA-GARCH models are explained earlier in\nthe article). After formulating autoregressive moving\naveragemodel,volatilityismodelledwithGARCH(1,1).\nThe residuals from the GARCH model so formulated\nfor each market are squared and introduced as shocks\nin the volatility equation of the other market to test the\nvolatility spillover effect from futures to spot market or\nvice versa. Table 3 presents the results of the volatility\nspillover. Volatility spillover coefficients are highly\nsignificant in spot and futures equations of all four\ncommodities indicating that futures market volatility\nspills over to the spot market and vice versa. Except\nmustard seed, the volatility spillover coefficient from\nfutures to spot market is of relatively smaller magni-\ntude than the spillover coefficient from spot to futures\nmarket. In the case of mustard seed, the model reports\nbi-directional volatility spillover with equal strength.\nThe magnitude of spillover coefficient from spot to\nfutures is greater in the case of soya oil, Mentha oil, and\ncrude palm oil (CPO). Therefore, spillover effect from\nspot to futures is more than the spillover from futures\nto spot. An increase in volatility of spot prices increases\nthe volatility of futures prices more as compared to the\nother way round. Information in both markets can be\nused to predict the volatility of other market but the\ninformation transmission mechanism of spot market is\nstronger. Therefore, futures market of oilseeds needs to\nbe developed further in order to be a leading source\nof information transmission and provide efficient risk\ntransfer mechanism. Similar findings of stronger vola-\ntility spillover from spot market to futures market have\nbeen reported in  n studies on agro commodi-\nties by Dey et al. (2011) in case of pepper, Mahalik et\nal. (2009) for agricultural index at MCX, Srinivasan\nfor MCXCOMDEX (composite index of metal, energy,\nand agro-commodities). The model results are ratified\nby the diagnostic test criteria wherein p-value of LM\ntest run with 2 lags is greater than 0.05. Therefore, the\nnull hypothesis of `no ARCH' effect is not rejected indi-\ncating no serial dependencies in the residuals.\nTable 2: ADF Unit Root Test Results\nCommodity Series\nADF Test Statistics\nOrder of Integration\nLevels First Difference 5% Critical Value\nMentha oil\nRefined soya oil\nCrude palm oil\nMustard seed\nSource: Authors' Estimation.\nNotes: Null hypothesis of ADF test is that spot/futures return series has unit root. * denotes significant at 5 per cent level of significance.\nOptimal lag length is selected on the basis of SIC.\nTable 3: Empirical Results for Volatility Spillover--ARMA (p, q)-GARCH (1, 1)\nMentha Oil Refined Soya Oil Crude Palm Oil Mustard Seed\nSpot\nFutures\nSpot\nFutures\nSpot\nFutures\nSpot\nFutures\n\u00ad\n\u00ad \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad\n\u00ad \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad\n\u00ad\n\u00ad \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad\n\u00ad\n\u00ad \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad\nc\ni\n(Constant\n\u00d7\na\ni\nVolatility clustering\nb\ni\nVolatility\npersistence\n\ni\nVolatility spillover\nSource: Authors' Estimation.\nNotes: Figures in parentheses denote p-values at 5 per cent level of significance. 1LM represents Lagrange Multiplier Statistics to test the pres-\nence of additional ARCH effect in the residuals of mean-variance equations of GARCH model.\nRelationship between Spot Volatility, Trading\nVolume, and Open Interest\nAn old Wall Street adage says, `It takes trading\nvolume to make prices move.' The futures markets\nfurnish greater trading opportunities as they offer\ntraders market-wide risk exposure at lower transac-\ntion cost. The impact of an increase in trading oppor-\ntunities on the volatility of the market is unresolved\nat empirical and theoretical levels. Several studies\nhave investigated the relation between return vola-\ntility and trading volume and many have concluded\nthat price movements and transactions are bunched\nin time (Admati & Pfleiderer, 1988). In order to test\nwhether there has been a significant relation between\nfutures trading activity and spot price volatility,\nAugmented GARCH model and Granger causality\ntest are used. First, the difference of futures trading\nvolume and open interest series is taken to make them\nstationary. In the case of mustard seed, both series are\nstationary at levels and are, therefore, not subjected to\ndifferencing. Table 4 reports the ADF test results. The\nnull hypothesis of the presence of unit root is rejected\nindicating that the series are stationary and amenable\nto meaningful statistical analysis.\nTable 4: Unit Root Test Results--Futures Trading Volume and\nOpen Interest\nADF Test (t-Statistics)\nVariable Mentha Oil\nRefined\nSoya Oil\nCrude\nPalm Oil\nMustard\nSeed\nFutures trading\nvolume #\n\u00b7 \nExpected\nfutures trading\nvolume\n\u00b7 \nUnexpected\nfutures trading\nvolume\nOpen interest #\n\u00b7 \nExpected open\ninterest\n\u00b7 \nUnexpected\nopen interest\nSource: Authors' Estimation.\nNotes: # Futures trading volume and open interest series are in first\ndifference for mentha oil, soya oil and crude palm oil and at levels\nin case of mustard seed. Figures in parentheses denote p-values at\n5 per cent level of significance.\nContemporaneous Relationship between Futures Trading\nactivity and Spot Price Volatility--Augmented GARCH\nModel\nAs per the methodology of Bessembinder and Seguin\n(1992), expected and unexpected components of futures\ntrading activity variables are introduced as exogenous\nvariables in the volatility equation of spot returns\nmodelled as a GARCH (1, 1) process. The GARCH (1, 1)\nmodel augmented with additional explanatory vari-\nables enables the estimation of the contemporaneous\nrelationship between components of trading activity\nand conditional spot volatility. Table 5 presents the\nresults of Augmented GARCH model.\nETV is positively related to cash price volatility in the\ncase of mentha oil and soya bean oil; however, it is\nnegatively related to CV in mustard seed. UTV is posi-\ntive and significant in soya bean oil and CPO while it\nis negative and significant in mentha oil. EOI is nega-\ntive and significant in soya bean oil and mustard seed\nimplying that there is an inverse relation between the\ntwo, that is, increase in anticipated open interest repre-\nsenting hedger's positions is associated with reduced\ncash price volatility. UOI is positive and significant only\nin mentha oil.\nInference about stabilizing or destabilizing impact\nof futures trading can be made after combining the\nresults of augmented GARCH model with Granger\ncausality analysis.\nTable 5: Augmented GARCH Model of Spot Return Volatility\nwith Expected and Unexpected Futures Trading Volume and\nOpen Interest\nMentha\nOil\nRefined\nSoya Oil\nCrude\nPalm Oil\nMustard\nSeed\n\ni\nARCH term\nb\nj\nGARCH term\nETV\nt\nExpected trading\nvolume\nUTV\nt\nUnexpected\ntrading volume\nt\nExpected open\ninterest\nt\nUnexpected open\ninterest\nSource: Authors' Estimation.\nNotes: Figures in parenthesis show the probability at 5 per cent\nsignificance level. 1 represents Lagrange multiplier statistics to test for\nthe presence of additional ARCH effect in the residuals.\nDynamic Relationship between Spot Price Volatility and\nUnexpected Futures Trading Activity--Granger Causality\nThe contemporaneous relationship between spot price\nvolatility and unexpected futures trading volume\ndoes not account for the possibility of reverse causa-\ntion, that is, causality from spot volatility to futures\ntrading activity (Figlewski, 1981). Therefore, analysis of\nthe lead\u00adlag relationship between trading activity and\nvolatility helps in ascertaining the causality and gives\na clear picture regarding the stabilizing or destabilizing\nimpact of futures trading.\nVAR is formulated and number of lags is fixed on the\nbasis of minimization of SIC criteria. Joint significance\nof the variables in all the four Granger Causality equa-\ntions is tested with Chi-square statistics. Commodity-\nwise analysis is presented in Table 6.\nTable 6: VAR Granger Causality Test Results\nChi-Square Statistics\nMentha\nOil\nRefined\nSoya Oil\nCrude\nPalm Oil\nMustard\nSeed\nCash price volatility\nunexpected futures\nTrading volume\nUnexpected futures\ntrading volumecash\nPrice volatility\nCash price volatility\nunexpected open\ninterest (CVUOI)3\nUnexpected open\ninterestcash price\nvolatility (UOICV)4\nSource: Authors' Estimation.\nNotes: The `' denotes the hypothesized direction of Granger\ncausality between two variables. 1, 2, 3, 4, refer to equation 4\u00ad7.\n*denotes significant at 5 per cent level of significance. Figures in\nparentheses denote p-values at 5 per cent level of significance.\nMentha Oil\nChi-square test statistics for UTV and CV relationship\nis significant indicating that current cash returns vola-\ntility is influenced by the past level of unanticipated\nfutures trading volume. However, this is not destabi-\nlizing as the lagged coefficients of UTV in VAR (not\nreported here) are negative. Coefficient estimate of UTV\nin GARCH model (Table 5) is also negative implying\nthat unexpected surge in trading volume reduces\nthe spot price volatility. According to the Mixture of\nDistribution Hypothesis, there is a positive relation\nbetween trading volume and variance of stock returns.\nEmpirical evidences of an inverse relationship between\nthe two are rare in the literature and are also in sharp\ncontrast to the widely held perception that volume and\nvolatility have positive correlation (Kawaller, Koch, &\nical evidence of a positive relation between volume\nand volatility when volume was driven by uninformed\ngeneral public. However, when the volumes were\ndriven by the activity of informed traders like floor\ntraders and clearing members, it was inversely related\nto volatility. Damodaran and Subrahmanayan (1992)\nconcluded from a survey of a number of studies that\ncommodity futures helped in reducing the variance in\ncommodity markets. In relation to S&P index, Brown-\nHruska and Kuserk (1995) gave evidence of decline in\nspot price volatility with an increase in futures volume.\nThe present analysis also provides evidence that unex-\npected futures trading volume is not destabilizing\nfor the underlying spot market. ETV is significant in\nGARCH equation but its lagged terms in VAR (not\nreported here) are not significant leading to rejection\nof Granger causality from ETV to CV. Overall, UTV or\nsudden increase in futures trading volume is not desta-\nbilizing for mentha oil spot market volatility.\nChi-square test statistics is also significant for causality\nrunning from UOI to spot price volatility. GARCH\nmodel coefficient of UOI and lagged terms of UOI in\nVAR are mostly positive indicating that unexpected\nopen interest has a destabilizing impact on spot\nprice volatility. Similar findings have been reported\nin the study by Darrat and Rahman (1995), Yang et\nfutures traded in  . This aspect was discussed\nwith commodity research analyst at NCDEX. Mentha\noil futures market has a peculiar nature as it is highly\nspeculative with low trading volume and high open\ninterest. Participation of real hedgers is very low for this\ncommodity. The speculators try to corner the stocks by\nbuying futures contracts and rolling over the positions\non contract expiry. This gets reflected in an increase in\nopen interest, whereas the trading volume is low as\ncontracts do not change hands due to a limited number\nof participants. The increase in levels of open interest in\nmentha oil is associated with speculative positions and\nleads to increased spot price volatility.\nCausality is also observed in the direction from cash\nreturns volatility to futures trading volume with mixed\npositive and negative signs in the VAR indicating that\nerratic nature of cash price volatility also affects the\nfutures trading volume. The possible role of specula-\ntive interest in the spot market cannot be ruled out,\nwherein spot price volatility induces greater volumes\nin futures market.\nRefined Soya Oil and Crude Palm Oil\nChi-square statistics is significant for causality running\nfrom unexpected futures trading volume to cash price\nvolatility.LaggedtermsofUTVinVectorAutoregressive\nModel have positive sign. This along with the positive\nsignificant coefficient of UTV in Augmented GARCH\nmodel is an indication that unanticipated surges in\nfutures trading volume is increasing the spot price\nvolatility and is an evidence of destabilizing impact of\nfutures trading on soya bean oil and CPO spot price\nvolatility. The increase in unexpected futures trading\nvolume may arise from uninformed speculators who\ninfuse noise in the market which is transmitted to spot\nmarket through arbitrage and causes increased price\nvolatility.Futurestradingvolumerepresentstheactivity\nof speculators and as they increase positions during the\nday, volatility of underlying cash market, which takes\nprice signals from futures market, increases. Studies on\n n commodity futures markets which have come\nup with similar findings are Kumar (2009) and Sehgal\net al. (2012). Causality is not significant in other direc-\ntions. Unexpected open interest has an insignificant\ncoefficient estimate in GARCH model and causality\nfrom UOI to CV is also rejected; therefore hedging\nactivity does not influence cash price volatility.\nMustard Seed\nThe coefficients of expected trading volume and open\ninterest are significant and negative in augmented\nGARCH (Table 5). It implies that the increase in the\nlevel of trading volume and open interest is associated\nwith reduced spot volatility. This is consistent with the\nviews expressed in several studies that activities in\nfutures markets attract informed traders to the phys-\nical market imparting more liquidity and making it less\nvolatile (Pericli & Koutmos, 1997). On the other hand,\nthe model reports that sudden and unanticipated levels\nof trading volume and open interest have no influence\non the volatility of spot market.\nUnexpected trading volume or open interest is not\nGranger causing the volatility in the cash market.\nThe result of Granger causality coincides with that of\nGARCH model in which coefficients of UTV and UOI\nare insignificant. Hence, there is no evidence of price\ndestabilization effect of futures trading which is a posi-\ntive sign for the mustard seed futures market. Mustard\nseed is the only commodity in which there is no\nevidence of destabilizing impact. A possible explana-\ntion for this may be that first, mustard seed commodity\nprice data is referred from NMCE exchange which is not\ndominated by excessive speculation. Second, it is one\nof the 25 commodities which are subject to minimum\nsupport price fixed by the Government of   to\nprotect farmers against excessive fall in prices during\nbumper production. Also,   is almost self-suffi-\ncient in mustard seed and mustard oil and its domestic\nmarket prices are not much influenced by prices in the\ninternational markets. Since its prices are not purely\ndetermined by market forces, the result of the impact of\nfutures trading differs from other commodities.\nIn three out of four oilseeds commodities analysed,\nthe study provides empirical evidence of the desta-\nbilizing impact of futures trading activity either in\nthe form of trading volume or open interest on the\nvolatility of spot prices. Unexpected levels of futures\ntrading volume are responsible for driving up the\nspot price volatility in the case of soya oil and CPO.\nThe daily trading volume reflects speculative posi-\ntions and only a small portion of hedging transactions.\nWhen volumes in futures market are predominantly\ndriven by uninformed speculators, underlying spot\nprice volatility will also increase as the two markets are\nlinked by arbitrage. On the other hand, open interest\ncomprises longer than intraday trading positions and\ngenerally represents positions of hedgers or actively\ninformed traders who bring fundamental informa-\ntion about the commodity to the futures market. The\nincrease in hedgers' position imparts depth to the\nmarket. They are traders who have relatively homoge-\nnous beliefs and agree on prices which are close to the\nintrinsic value of an asset. Therefore, higher liquidity\nfrom the participation of informed traders in the form\nof expected and unexpected open interest is not having\na destabilizing impact on the spot price volatility.\nSUGGESTIONS\nOil and oilseeds commodities are hot counters on com-\nmodity futures exchanges. They are heavily demanded\nfor domestic consumption and industrial use by\nbiodiesel industry. Futures trading is expected to bring\nprice stability for the development of its physical\nmarket. However, the potential of futures contracts for\nprice discovery and price risk management is untapped.\nThe present study investigates the volatility dynamics\nin spot and futures markets of select commodities from\nthe sector. The econometric analysis is undertaken to test\nthe volatility spillover between spot and futures market,\nand to ascertain whether an unexpected increase in\nfutures trading volume or open interest is destabi-\nlizing for the underlying spot market. It is observed\nthat though there is bidirectional volatility spillover,\nthe volatility of spot market has a greater impact on the\nvolatility of futures market, indicating that informa-\ntional efficiency of oilseeds spot market is stronger than\nthat of futures market. The analysis provides evidence\nof destabilizing impact of futures trading on the vola-\ntility of physical market prices in three out of four\ncommodities analysed. It indicates that badly informed\ntraders present in futures market are destabilizing the\nunderlying spot market by inducing noise and lowering\nthe information content of prices.\nThe results are important for hedgers in commodity\nmarkets who expect welfare gains from futures trading,\nwhich is possible only if the latter does not increase\nthe spot price volatility. However, if the speculative\nactivity in futures market does not lower the volatility,\nthe overall risk of a hedged portfolio is not reduced\nresulting in welfare reduction. Spot markets in   for\nagricultural commodities are fragmented, unorganized,\nand are not electrically traded. Due to the lack of trans-\nparency, it becomes an easy victim of instability perpe-\ntrated by noisy speculative activity in futures markets.\nTherefore, it is important to encourage participa-\ntion of farmers, traders, processors and other stake-\nholders who will bring fundamental information\nabout the underlying commodity into the futures\nmarket. Educating and training farmers and traders\nwill enhance their confidence in the use of derivative\ncontracts. Spot markets can be strengthened by equip-\nping them with information-technology based price\ndissemination terminals like electronic price ticker\nboards. Such measures will bring speed and transpar-\nency in the spot trading mechanism which can coexist\nwith the state-of-the-art commodity futures exchanges.\nGreater financial and administrative autonomy to\nthe Forward Market Commission (FMC) which is till\nnow operating under the Department of Consumer\nAffairs (Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public\nDistribution), will enable it to handle incidents of\nprice rigging and abusive practices like hoarding and\ncartelization. The punitive powers of FMC need to be\nincreased so that it can take stringent action against\ntraders engaging in fraudulent activities. Whenever\nsuch instability is witnessed, the regulator can control\nthe impact of excessive speculation by adopting meas-\nures, such as close monitoring of members' positions,\nimposing additional margins, declaration of stocks\nin warehouses, and staggered delivery systems, and\nso on. It is also proposed that futures trading should\nnot be allowed in narrow commodities. These are the\ncommodities which do not meet the suitability require-\nment for futures trading. They face constraints like\nlimited domestic production due to which reliable\nand timely demand and supply forecasts are not avail-\nable. Narrow agricultural commodities like mentha oil\nand cardamom become potential candidates for price\nmanipulation in the absence of any precise data.\nREFERENCES\nAdmati, A., & Pfleiderer, P. (1988).
