The program was conducted in a community in the Midwest region of the United States and began in 2005 with\na grant from the Open Meadows Foundation. Participants were volunteers who were recruited for the program through pre-\nexisting access points to the Bosnian, African, and Hispanic communities, such as ethnic churches, markets, and key contacts\nwithin these communities. The support group format for the Women of Care Program was an open group format in which\nparticipants were encouraged to invite their friends to join. The initial support group consisted of women from various\ncultural origins, including Ghana, Rwanda, Tanzania, Russia, Sierra Leone, Brazil, China, Taiwan, India, Nepal, Bosnia, Mexico,\nand the United States. This case study was based on focus group discussions, as well as observations and completion of\nevaluation forms. To analyze data, the focus group discussion notes and summaries were rearranged into recurring themes.\nThe evaluation provided further feedback from the discussions to cement these themes. Findings suggested immigrants,\nespecially women, benefit from support groups. Group involvement could empower women and increase their general sense\nof well-being in overcoming barriers they may face in transitioning into a new environment. It is recommended that host\ncommunities have integration programs which benefit both the host community and the immigrant: a win\u00adwin situation.\n",

Despite its long immi-\ngrant history, the United States has no formal immigrant inte-\ngration policy (M. M. Su\u00e1rez-Orozco, Su\u00e1rez-Orozco, &\nSattin-Bajaj, 2010). Immigrant arrivals a century ago were\noverwhelmingly European whereas today's immigrants\ncome primarily from Asia, the Caribbean, and Latin America\n(Lobo, Salvo, & Virgin, 1996; Migration Policy Institute,\n2002). Groups which had little immigrant representation in\nthe late 1980s, such as Mexicans and West Africans, have\nbecome a much more significant presence in recent years\ngration, male immigrants outnumbered female immigrants;\nhowever, the majority of immigrants to the United States\ntoday are women (Houstoun, Kramer, & Barrett, 1984;\nZlotnik, 2003). Although some of these women immigrated\non their own, most others enter the United States relying on\ntheir marriage to a man who is a citizen of the United States\nImmigrant women who arrive from non-Western cultures are\nlikely to face numerous challenges related to migration,\nunrealistic expectations, lack of language skills, and being\nforced to cope with cultural differences (Carr, Koyama, &\nine these challenges and how a social support group helped\nto assist these women and alleviate some of the issues,\nstresses, and concerns facing them. In the end, \"immigration\n. . . is about human beings\" (M. M.

Evaluation tools\nfor this program included focus groups, observations, feed-\nback elicited from the participants, and completion of evalu-\nation forms.\nExpectations\nUpon arrival in the United States, immigrant women face a\nreality that is different from their expectations, which tends\nto cause emotional distress (Williams, 2011). For many\nimmigrant women, especially those from non-Western cul-\ntures, their expectations are based on Hollywood movies and\nbooks in which women are portrayed as being successful,\nglamorous, and independent. These assumptions can become\na stumbling block, hindering many immigrant women from\nadapting to their new lifestyle or coping with the reality of\nwomen's roles in their new culture. \"The mingling of reality\nand aspiration can become problematic\" (Sabates-Wheeler,\ntheir search for a better life on imaginary aspirations. For\nmarried immigrant women with husbands who still believe\nthat a woman's place is in the kitchen, the differences\nbetween both cultures create a stumbling block. As women\nbecome \"less fatalistic, less submissive, and more authoritar-\nian in the home\" (Zarrugh, 1974, cited in Salgado de Snyder,\nstrikes at the core of their self-esteem (Darvishpour, 2002;\nShirpak, Tyndale, & Chinichian, 2011) making it impossible\nfor a peaceful marriage.\nLanguage\nThe ability to navigate within a new environment requires a\nworking knowledge of the primary language spoken by the\nhost country. Female immigrants are more likely than men to\nface the harsh reality of trying to survive without a working\nknowledge of the host language (Batalova & Fix, 2010;\nHyman & Dussault, 1996). In their role as mothers, women\nare required to function and interact publicly in places such\nas \"stores, schools, and the workplace\" (Hondagneu-Sotelo\nments, a woman's lack of language proficiency may limit her\nability to communicate effectively, which may restrict her\naccess to public life and community services. A lack of abil-\nity to communicate with school staff, for example, may make\nit difficult for these women to adequately participate in their\nchildren's educational experiences (Batalova & Fix, 2010).\nIn addition, language deficiencies prevent many immi-\ngrant women from \"interacting with American-born neigh-\nbors, engaging in civic life, and becoming integrated into\na lack of knowledge of the social safety net--health care,\nhousing, and welfare services. Deficiency in language skills\nalso inhibits mobility and serves as a barrier to identifying\noccupations that are \"safe to pursue\" and often prevent\nfemale immigrants from \"securing a well-paying job in\nwhich English is an essential tool for communication\" (Ma\nemployment opportunities for immigrant women, research-\ners believe that \"immigration and unemployment create\nthree sources of stressors: uncertainty about the future\ndistress due to the lack of a job (Jacobson, 1986), and exclu-\nsion from main-stream society (Muller, 1993)\" as cited in\nCulture\nAccording to Norman (2015), raising children in a new envi-\nronment presents unique challenges. On a daily basis, women\nare confronted with monitoring their children's schoolwork,\nmaintaining family traditions, and balancing family dynam-\nics. For instance, when parents are confronted with the man-\nner children speak to adults, the opposing cultural values can\ncreate an outcome which can be disheartening to the parents.\nWhile immigrant parents' expectations, norms, rules, and\nbeliefs about child rearing, family roles, and obligations tend\nto remain stable, children's attitudes can change greatly over\ntime (Xiong, Eliason, Detzner, & Cleveland, 2005).\nIn comparison with many cultures, the United States tends\nto be a more permissive society, allowing children a degree\nof autonomy to which many immigrants may not be accus-\ntomed (Parsai, Nieri, & Villar, 2010). For most immigrant\nmothers, training these children becomes a Herculean task as\nthey strive to keep their children within the bounds of what\nthey deem to be correct principles. Conflicts arise because\nchildren who live in this new society have usually gained a\nnew perspective on life (Daglar, Melhuish, & Barnes, 2011;\nParsai et al., 2010). More specifically, the children's outlook\non life is reflected in what they wear, how they speak, and\neven what they eat (Yao, 1985). For example, they may wear\nclothing considered to be inappropriate by the standards\nmaintained by the parent and may begin to speak in ways\nwhich are difficult to understand or are considered rude\nwithin their previous culture (Portes & Rumbaut, 2001; Yao,\nHaving interacted with and been exposed to their peers,\nthe children may develop a taste for American dishes and\nrequest that their parents provide such meals (Yao, 1985). As\nmany immigrant families have limited finances (Batalova &\nFix, 2010), providing two different meals designed to satisfy\nthe newly acquired tastes of their children may strain the\nfamily budget and fray the parents'nerves. In essence, immi-\ngrant home life can become a stressful place in which diverg-\ning groups of people try to accommodate one another.\nThe resulting stress from emotional, social, cultural, edu-\ncational, and economic adjustments may prompt immigrant\nwomen to gravitate toward social support groups (Kazemipur,\n2006). Social support systems can validate the experiences\nMsengi et al. 3\nof immigrant women and provide powerful coping resources\n(Carr et al., 2003). As opposed to many individual friend-\nships, a support group can serve to help its members generate\nan increased number of solutions and ideas which provide\nwomen with a variety of choices for dealing with their prob-\nlems. According to Cho and Haslam (2010), social support is\nparticularly important to serve as a buffer against distress.\nRelationships formed in support groups serve a critical func-\ntion in maintaining and enhancing self-esteem, while provid-\ning acceptance, approval, and a sense of belonging (C.\nSu\u00e1rez-Orozco & Carhill, 2008). These relationships can\nserve as replacements for families far away as well as a way\nof maintaining cultures left behind (Bilge, 2012).\nMethod\nThe purpose of this case study was to describe a single mul-\nticultural women's support program known as the Women of\nCare Project. The following research questions guided the\nstudy:\nResearch Question 1: What steps were taken to develop\nthis multicultural women's support program?\nResearch Question 2: What were the activities of this\nmulticultural women's support program?\nResearch Question 3: What benefits did the women\nderive from participating in the multicultural program?\nSetting\nThe program was located in a community in the Midwest\nregion of the United States. The community where the pro-\ngram was housed had been experiencing some of the most\nsignificant demographic changes in the United States during\nparticular state had one of the largest percentages of aging\nresidents in the country with 370,000 people retiring over the\nnext decade as well as a decreasing birthrate. Also, half of\nthis state's college and university graduates leave the state\nresulting in a large out-migration of the young workforce. To\nbridge this gap, and to ensure the future economic and social\nviability of the state, meatpacking and other industries in the\nparticipating community and throughout the state actively\nrecruit refugees and immigrants from Latin America, Eastern\nEurope, Asia, and Africa (Grey, 2006). Recent trends in\nimmigration in this Midwestern state also show an increase\nin secondary migration of Burmese refugees (Molseed,\n2011). These refugees have become attracted to the area\nbecause of the abundance of readily available jobs, particu-\nlarly in the meatpacking industry.\nSome industrial cities have worked with the U.S. State\nDepartment to help bring refugees to their cities from refu-\ngee camps across the nation (Molseed, 2011). These new\nimmigrant and refugee populations face many serious prob-\nlems and obstacles that impede their successful integration\ninto their new environments. As a result, the Women of Care\nProgram and other similar programs were developed.\nData Collection and Analysis\nThe current study was a case study of a women immigrants\nand refugees support group. Creswell (2007) mentioned dif-\nferent methods of data collection for case studies. Based on\nCreswell's recommendations, this case study used focus\ngroup discussions, observations, and completion of evalua-\ntion forms collected after each monthly activity for a period\nof 1 year (see Appendix B).\nSpeakers were invited to facilitate each event. Each event\nwas led by the program founder (African descent), Spanish\ntranslator (Mexican descent), and Bosnian translator\n(Bosnian descent). In addition, there were two women from\na local university who were interns working in the program\n(Caucasian and Indian descent). The Spanish and Bosnian\ntranslators helped with the issue of language during the focus\ndiscussions.At the end of each event, an evaluation form was\ngiven to evaluate the effectiveness of the program (see\nAppendix A).\nTo analyze the data, the focus group discussion notes and\nsummaries were rearranged into the recurring themes\n(Creswell, 2007). The evaluations provided further feedback\nfrom the discussions to cement these themes.\nParticipants\n\"The Women of Care Project\" was a monthly, year-long pro-\ngram designed to benefit immigrant and refugee women new\nto a community located in the Midwest region of the United\nStates while offering longtime residents the unprecedented\nopportunity to meet and better understand these newcomers\nand their cultures. The project was built upon a support/edu-\ncational group concept, providing a support network while\nhelping immigrant women integrate and adapt to their new\nsurroundings. The network also provided avenues for devel-\noping language skills and expanding educational and\nemployment opportunities, empowering these women to\nbecome productive members of their communities.\nParticipants were recruited for the program through pre-\nexisting access points to the Bosnian, African, and Hispanic\ncommunities, such as ethnic churches, markets, and key con-\ntacts within these communities. All participants in the study\nagreed to participate and consent forms were signed by each\nindividual to denote their informed consent. An average of\n15 women attended the meetings; however, some activities\nattracted more than 15 women from the community. For\nexample, the International Tea Party, a scheduled event that\nshowcased different types of tea, attracted more than 100\nwomen from the community. This gala event provided\nwomen an opportunity to meet, greet, and converse with\nother women while also sampling various brews of tea from\naround the world.\n4 SAGE Open\nThe program started with women from different cultural\nbackgrounds, including Ghana, Rwanda, Tanzania, Russia,\nSierra Leone, Brazil, China, Taiwan, India, Nepal, Bosnia,\nMexico, and the United States. To ameliorate the high levels\nof stress and depression among these women, the program\nused methods to reduce stress and depression which were\ndifferent from traditional Western approaches. Because these\nwomen often reported feeling detached from the community\ndue to cultural differences, unfulfilled expectations, lack of\ntrust in the traditional health care system, and language bar-\nriers, several activities were provided to address their chal-\nlenges in a holistic way.\nProgram Description\nThe first procedure conducted in the study involved partici-\npants being matched with a local volunteer who acted as a con-\nversational partner/friend. The purpose of this individual\ninteraction was twofold: It allowed the newcomer to practice and\ndevelop her English skills in a non-threatening environment, and\nit provided the women with someone who could assist them with\ntheir individual needs. Also, in the beginning months of the pro-\ngram, the agency held a \"Welcome to Our Community\" series of\nactivities, including a tour of the area. This series allowed the\nwomen to become more familiar with the community in a secure\ngroup setting while allowing them to become aware of area\nresources and other agencies in the community.\nIn the second procedure, staff and translators conducted\nhome visits to the women's homes. Home visits tend to be\nespecially important among the immigrant and refugee pop-\nulation who oftentimes have no means of transportation and\ntypically lack familiarity with telephone and written com-\nmunication styles in Western countries. Most of the women\nin the current study came from communities where face-to-\nface communication was considered to be a valued means for\naddressing serious matters.\nThird, the women met collectively as a group once each\nmonth. This group interaction enabled the women to create\nnew social connections with other women who were experi-\nencing similar circumstances and experiences, which also\nserved to help the women combat their feelings of isolation.\nMost of these women came from cultures where most activi-\nties were done in a group with extended families, friends,\nvillage elders, religious leaders, and/or the general commu-\nnity. Women were provided with opportunities to share their\nstories, encourage each other, meet new friends, make con-\nnections, improve/learn new skills, and gain a sense of\nbelonging to the community. Through these collective group\nmeetings, the women were afforded an opportunity to learn\nand share with each other culturally sensitive and relevant\nways to manage their feelings of stress and depression.\nProgram Activities\nThe main activities of the group included cooking, dancing,\nconducting presentations, and offering social support. In the\nfirst year of the program, meetings were held biweekly with\none meeting each month being led by one of the women\nfrom the group who showcased a recipe from her home\ncountry. She also led the group in a demonstration of how to\nprepare and cook the dish. The social group activities\nwere open to general members of the community. These\nsocial group activities enabled the women to share their cul-\nture, build their confidence, and enhance their feelings of\nself-worth.\nThe other meeting in the month focused on traditional\nhealth practices, which included, but were not limited to,\nnatural medicines, food preparation practices, child-rearing\nstrategies, and taboos. An end result of the first year of the\nprogram was that the women collectively put together a\ncookbook. This cookbook was essentially a collection of\nrecipes from women in the program and others from the\ncommunity.\nIn 2007, the Women of Care Program hosted an\nInternational Tea Party sponsored by the local branch of\nthe American Association of University Women. One hun-\ndred people attended this event--immigrant/refugee\nwomen and community members. Women from various\ncultures wore their native clothing and shared their tea\ntime customs with the community members. Also, a mem-\nber of the community shared her collection of teapots,\ndescribed the history of tea, and exposed the group to vari-\nous types of tea.\nFindings/Results\nThe women reported several benefits through participating\nin this support group program. A number of the participants\nreported that the program helped them develop better mental\nand emotional wellness, as well as a general sense of well-\nbeing for themselves, their children, and extended family\nmembers. The support groups also helped these women\novercome some of the barriers they faced in the areas of lan-\nguage, culture, poverty, and discrimination, issues which\nmade it very difficult for them to function competently in a\nnew community. In addition, the support groups created a\nplace where the participants connected with people with sim-\nilar experiences. This sharing format helped to alleviate\nsome of the pain and difficulties associated with the accul-\nturation process.\nThe participants made friends quickly and created a sup-\nport system they could rely on for strength. Sharing tradi-\ntions and different food ideas were empowering to the\nwomen because they felt their contribution to this new social\nenvironment was valuable to others. It also afforded local\nresidents a unique opportunity to learn about women from\nother cultures. Newcomers and members of the host com-\nmunity even shared their knowledge of job opportunities and\nagreed to serve as references for each other. To date, many of\nthe participants still share their joys with each other, includ-\ning sharing news about birthdays, graduations, newborns,\nweddings, anniversaries, and vacations.\nMsengi et al. 5\nDiscussion\nThe purpose of this case study was to describe a single mul-\nticultural women's support group program known as the\nWomen of Care Project. Regarding the questions posed by\nthe study, (a) the women who participated in the study were\na diverse group of immigrant women who shared their cul-\ntures with one another, members of the community, and the\nstaff from the program to define their uniqueness and find\nsupport from one another and the project leaders, the direc-\ntors of the program advertised the program in the community\nto solicit participants and set up scheduled meetings as well\nas guided activities for the participants; (b) the program pro-\nvided numerous activities such as cooking sessions, tea\nsocials, stress management sessions, and many others (see\nAppendix B); and (c) the program provided opportunities for\nthe women to develop a sense of belonging and experienced\nenhanced self-worth and self-esteem through their participa-\ntion in the program.\nAssisting immigrant newcomers in making adjustments,\nfinding employment, and in coping with a new cultural con-\ntext has been suggested in previous research (Lev-Wiesel &\nKaufman, 2004). There is a need to foster the development of\nsocial support groups that assist new immigrants in an\nattempt to broaden the social ties of the immigrants with the\ndemands of their new environment. It is recommended that\npolicy makers and service providers develop programs for\nthis specific population. Development of support groups and\nsocial networks will enable these immigrant women to\nacquire skills needed to help them better interact with the\ncommunity as they try to cope with the adversity presented\nto them in their new culture as well as serve to empower\nthem in the process. Programs are needed that empower\nwomen and teach them techniques and strategies in adopting\nan active rather that a passive role in the adaptation process.\nTherefore, programs should be created to facilitate the pro-\ncess of helping these women make the necessary adjustments\nfor adapting to the host community.\nFuture research should focus on helping immigrant\nwomen adapt to change and how society can create a sup-\nportive environment to facilitate their success. Group inter-\naction is an integral part of the process and provides a vital\nmeans of furthering identity development and social support\nfor immigrant women. Being able to share their experiences\nwith others is both significant and helpful. Interaction with\nother women and sharing experiences can serve as a founda-\ntion to their success and can provide a unique set of cross-\ncultural learning experiences. More importantly, female\nleaders from other ethnicities may serve as positive role\nmodels for immigrant women in assisting their acculturation\nexperiences and provide a support system through social\nengagement.\nIn addition, a follow-up study should be conducted to\ninvestigate how these women are continuing to adapt, what\nare their current challenges now, and how they are integrat-\ning into the society. Such a study should focus on these wom-\nen's daily routines, experiences, and reflections of their lives\nin the United States.\nConclusion\nThe women in this study benefited from the activities and\nnetworking provided through participating in this program.\nThe skills, resources, and networking provided through their\nparticipation in the program increased the likelihood of suc-\nceeding and better integrating into their new environment.\nThe sense of sharing and contributing to other women in the\ngroup created a sense of belonging and empowerment as\nindicated by their feedback.\nAs the number of immigrant women continues to grow\n(Migration Policy Institute, 2002), it would be beneficial for\nlocal communities to create programs to help women and\ntheir families integrate into American culture. Based on the\nexperiences of the women in the Women of Care Program, it\nis suggested that social support validated the experiences of\nwomen and provided a powerful coping resource for those\nwho were dealing with stressful life changes (Carr et al.,\n2003). It is recommended that integration programs for new\nimmigrants be implemented. Faith-based organizations and\neducational institutions which have a large population of\ninternational students as well as other well-meaning individ-\nuals should collaborate to implement similar programs.\nIndividuals who conduct these programs should be culturally\naware of the diversity that exists among immigrants. Better\nintegration benefits the host community and the immigrant,\nwhich is a win\u00adwin situation for everyone involved.\n6 SAGE Open\nAppendix B\nTimeline: Women of Care Program\nAppendix A\nEvaluation Form--Women of Care Program\nEvent: Title: Date:\nLocation:\nWhat is your occupation?
