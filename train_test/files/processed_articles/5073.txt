    "abstract": "Abstract\n``Big Data'' can revolutionize historical social science if it arises from substantively important contexts and is oriented\ntowards answering substantively important questions. Such data may be especially important for answering previously\nlargely intractable questions about the timing and sequencing of events, and of event boundaries. That said, ``Big Data''\nmakes no difference for social scientists and historians whose accounts rest on narrative sentences. Since such accounts\nare the norm, the effects of Big Data on the practice of historical social science may be more limited than one might wish.\n",
    "reduced_content": "Commentary\nBig Data and historical social science\nPeter Bearman\n Keywords\nBig Data, historical social science\nPretty much at the same time as network scientists have\nbeen discovering power laws and other connectivity-\nbased epiphenomenal features of social networks in\nthe digital exhaust of on-line searches, social media\nfriendship choices, purchase recommendations, product\nreviews and the like, historians have been quietly build-\ning massive archival data structures from the extant\nrecords of crucially important institutions and contexts\nand making those data structures available to the\npublic. These include--and this is only an idiosyncratic\nsample drawn mainly from Britain--the complete text\nrecord of the Old Bailey, the extant records of the\nAtlantic slave trade, and the British East India\nCompany. With the simplest of search strategies\nanswers to descriptive questions that the lone historian\nporing through a dusty archive could barely imagine\npossible are now achievable in a matter of days, per-\nhaps hours, or even minutes. How will these Big Data\narchives and many others change our understanding of\nthe past, and hence our present?\nAs these archives come on-line, with even less fan-\nfare than the newest study showing that the day length\nhas an influence on people's emotions indexed by the\nproportion of happy over sad tweets, vast textual cor-\npora spanning long periods of time are now becoming\nwidely available in digital form. And not surprisingly,\nthese textual corpora (once again providing only an\nidiosyncratic sample from the United States--State of\nthe Union (SoU) speeches, the Congressional Record,\ntranscripts of Supreme Court decisions) also arise from\nimportant institutions whose form is largely continuous\nover often very long periods of time.1 Can we answer old\nquestions in new ways from these old texts?\nSimilarly, cultural objects such as photographs,\nmenus from New York City restaurants, seating\ncharts for the New York Philharmonic, also previously\nlargely inaccessible, are increasingly made available in\non-line repositories (Accominetti and Khan, 2015).\nMost of these data are precisely time-stamped and\nmuch of it can be precisely geo-referenced. Do these\nnew cultural repositories make possible changed under-\nstandings of crucially important dynamics such as elite\nformation, ethnic group integration, disease diffusion and\neven long-term climate change?\nAnd we are just at the beginning of the archival\nrevolution. Historical archives of enormous significance\nare being digitized rapidly. Equally amazing, new arch-\nives of unknown importance but on a massive scale--\nfor example, the two billion annual emails to and from\nthe department of state under Clinton--dwarf the\nnumber of unique documents that ever existed from\nColumbia University, New York, USA\nCorresponding author:\nPeter Bearman, Columbia University, 606 W. 122nd Street, New York,\nEmail: psb17@columbia.edu\nBig Data & Society\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\nbds.sagepub.com\nCreative Commons NonCommercial-NoDerivs CC-BY-NC-ND: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Com-\nmons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 License (http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/) which permits\nnon-commercial use, reproduction and distribution of the work as published without adaptation or alteration, without further permission provided the\noriginal work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\nthe entire Lincoln administration.2 Does any of\nthis matter for what historians and historical social\nscientists do?\nNot surprisingly, the answer is no and yes.\nGolder and Macy report (2011), as quoted in this\nvolume by Breiger, that ``the web sees everything and\nforgets nothing''. As a fantasy this is not so different\nfrom the ideal chronicle that records everything ``just as\nit happened, as it happened'' imagined in 1968 by\nArthur Danto (1968) who wondered whether such a\nchronicle would change anything of significance that\nhistorians do. Danto acknowledges that after doing\nwhatever historians do in the archives that the existence\nof such a chronicle would allow them to instantly check\ntheir facts, but this is at best a trivial element of their\npractice. What historians do uniquely is write narrative\nsentences--sentences such as ``on Christmas Eve 1642,\nthe father of modern physics was born''--and a chron-\nicle that recorded everything that happened just as it\nhappened would not be of any use for such an activity,\nfor only after modern physics was born could Newton\nbe its father. The web or the chronicle that saw every-\nthing and forgot nothing would record absolutely faith-\nfully that on Christmas Eve 1642 Isaac Newton was\nborn. But it could never record at the moment that\nsome hundreds of years later he would father modern\nphysics. So for this central activity of the historian's\ncraft--the writing of narrative sentences--our new\ndata structures will be of little importance.\nBut for a social science history not concerned with\nwriting such sentences, these data structures may\ninduce across a wide array of substantive problems of\nnote a radical re-imagination of the past, and conse-\nquently a radical reorganization of our understanding\nof the present because they invite and provide supports\nfor a new kind of history, one focused less on dynamics,\npattern recognition, and the identification of the mech-\nanisms by which the actions of actors cumulate into\nmacro-level outcomes. Think of our deepest intellectual\nproblems--for example, something like the emergence\nof ``modern society''. What could Big Data contribute\nto our understanding?\nJose Atria--a PhD student at Columbia--is working\non using the Old Bailey archive to answer just that\nquestion (2015). The starting point for this project is\nhis observation that historians and social scientists\nagree that a whole set of process widely believed to\nhave started in the 16th century resulted in the emer-\ngence of modern society. There is no question about\nThese include changes like the emergence of ways of life\nthat made violence and the body seem repugnant and\nshameful (Elias, 2000), the development of centralized\nstate authority and the emergence of national\ncommunities beyond direct bonds of kinship\ndevelopment of market society (Polanyi, 2001), the dis-\nsolution of traditional social relationships based on\nstatus in favor of a social structure based on\nsocial classes (Thompson, 1963), and the emergence\nof disciplinary methods of control and power\nOthers could be added, of course, but this is a sufficient\nset for our purposes and the key issue is not that there\nmay be others, but that even though there is agreement\nabout the fact that these processes are central, there is\nvery little agreement about the structure of the causal\nconnections between them.3 And answering that ques-\ntion--which can be decomposed into a series of other\ncritical questions, such as: How did the various semi-\nautonomous processes involved in the emergence of\nmodern society interact with one another? Which\nchanges came first? Which followed either in timing\nof onset or speed of change?--is where ``Big Data''\n(in this case, the Old Bailey archive) comes into play.\nImportantly, the Old Bailey archive arises directly\nfrom an institution that is absolutely central to all of\nthe critical processes that constitute modernity's emer-\ngence. Other institutions play equally critical roles. An\noften observed character of historical data and also true\nfor big historical data that promises to change what we\nknow about causal dynamics in historical context is\nthat it arises from institutional contexts strongly impli-\ncated in those processes. Things that were preserved\nmore often than not are things that people then\nbelieved worth preserving. The archive, which covers\nperiod bounding the emergence of modernity) contains\nprecise time-stamped data on millions of unique per-\nsons, thousands of places, and hundreds of thousands\nof interactions, both criminal and quotidian. Indexed in\nthese records are precise relational data structures that\nenable one to focus on changing patterns of social rela-\ntions, the social geography of violence, the displace-\nment of kinship, the breakdown of localisms of all\nsorts, and the emergence of new strategies and dis-\ncourses about governance. And from this, one can iden-\ntify the pace of institutional change, the causal\ndynamics underlying the complex cluster of interlocked\nand tied processes that constitute modernity. Or at the\nleast, one can anticipate that such an analysis--other-\nwise impossible--is within reach.\nOr consider a related problem: how should we case\nhistorical event sequences; that is, how should we\ninduce periods? Newly available textual corpora span-\nning long periods of time provide a powerful setting for\nidentifying turning points. As with the previous discus-\nsion, American historians agree that at some time\n2 Big Data & Society\nAmerican social and political discourse over the course\nof the more than two centuries from 1790 to the present\nchanged. They also agree about the nature of this chan-\nge--that one can with confidence distinguish modern\ndiscourse from earlier forms. Yet when this change hap-\npened and how we can best identify it are matters of\nsignificant debate. The canonical explanations center\nyear has a proponent! This debate necessarily impli-\ncates scholarly strategies for casing history, that is, stra-\ntegies for identifying partitions in the necessarily\nuninterrupted flow of the past sufficient to meaningfully\ninduce discrete temporal clusters such as `the gilded\nage'', ``the progressive period'', ``the age of the fron-\ntier'', and so on. The partitions that one selects\ndepend, of course, on the standpoint from which one\nFigure 1. Radar Plot of the State of the Union Speeches: Words are located temporally when 50% of their occurences have taken\nplace.\nstarts. The history of America as a country of immi-\ngrants induces a different partition from the history of\nAmerica as a loose confederacy of states. Given this,\nthe challenge is generating a meaningful partition\nbetween modern and pre-modern social and political\ndiscourse where the contents of that discourse are rhet-\norical devices for periodization! To do this, one needs\nto identify a form that is continuous, and of continuous\nsignificance. Enter Big Data.\nDrawing from the archive of Presidential SoU\naddresses, Rule et al. (2015) show that the annual\nSoU addresses of Presidents provides, despite changes\nin mode of delivery, one such form, and thus provides\nan Archimedean point from which they can view the\ncontent and structure of American social and political\ndiscourse unfolding over time. Using new strategies for\nanalyzing historical texts in which terms, concepts, lan-\nguage use and words' meanings change over time, Rule\net al. show that modern social and political discourse\nover the nature of governance emerges as a distinct\nobject after 1917, though elements of such discourse\nare identifiable earlier. This provides new insights into\nour understanding of American history and transforms\nin its wake our understanding of what modern and pre-\nmodern discourse looks like and, equally critically, the\nelements of continuity that link them. Along the way,\nthey demonstrate a new strategy for identifying mean-\ningful categories in textual corpora that span long per-\niods of time. Specifically, their approach is able to\naccount for the fluidity of discursive categories over\ntime, and to analyze their continuity by identifying\nthe conversational stream as the object of interest.\nThat it gives rise to visualizations that allow for the\nidentification of lexical change over the longue duree\n(as in Figure 1) is simply an additional benefit.\nA whole class of new problems that could not be\nprecisely articulated may be accessible with Big Data.\nUsing a new data structure that precisely geo-references\nseason ticket holders of the New York Philharmonic\nwith respect to seat location (!) and residence,\nAccominetti and Khan (2015), for example, can show\nhow the NYC elite used patronage of cultural institu-\ntions to recognize themselves, and how this capacity for\njoint recognition led to a subsequent reorganization of\nresidential patterns in the City during the Gilded Age.\nOne insight here is that the elite class came to see itself\nthrough joint observation across multiple settings,\nneighborhoods, concerts, and so on, while at the same\ntime creating avenues for non-elites to circulate on the\nborders of the elite sub-world.\nLikewise, Hoffman et al. (2015), using data from the\nAtlantic slave trade archive, bolstered with detailed\noccupational data gleaned from newly available geo-\nreferenced street directories for Liverpool, are able to\nshow why the Liverpool slave trade ownership network,\nwas able to ride out failure caused by privateering and\n``defeat'' London and Bristol for control of the Triangle\nTrade after 1750. In the same vein, Muller and his col-\nleagues are currently digitizing prison incarceration data\nfor Lawrence Mass, during the famed Bread and Roses\nstrike, which, coupled with other administrative (census,\nmortality, hospital) data, will make it possible to model\nthe diffusion of resistance in one of the canonical events\nin US Labor history (2015). All of these studies were\ntheoretically possible before ``Big Data'', but none\ncould be accomplished within the lifetime of a single\nscholar. The promise of such studies is both their con-\ntribution to the specific history with which they engage\nand the identification of mechanisms that may be trans-\nposable across context. Using Big Data to identify trans-\nposable mechanisms is, I believe, central. Otherwise, we\nare left with mere description, a useful project, but not a\nparticularly useful sociological project.\nThese few examples barely touch the surface of what\nthe Big Data revolution is making possible in historical\nstudies. Whole arenas of work reliant on administrative\ndata structures (like the census); institutional records\n(for example, state-level records on de-institutionaliza-\nthat link standard social science instruments with large-\nscale historical archives (like the GSS with the mortality\nschedules for the US, and so on) are not described\nherein. In so far as they share the characteristics of\nthe projects described above: oriented towards answer-\ning causally important questions through the identifica-\ntion of transposable mechanisms, as versus writing\nnarrative sentences, focused on identifying the pace\nand structure of change arising from key institutional\nlocales known to undergird the large historical\nprocesses of interest, these Big Data structures can\nrevolutionize historical social science. In so far as\nthey capture merely epiphenomenal materials arising\nfrom non-central institutional locales, Big Data seems\nless promising.
