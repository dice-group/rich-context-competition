We determined whether age-related loss in FFM and fat free mass index (FFMI) vary\nby gender and or ethnicity, using representative data from the Third National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES III).\nMethods: Analyses were limited to 5,803 non-institutionalized, non-Hispanic Whites and African\nAmericans (Blacks) over the age of 40 years. Body density was calculated from the sum of 3-\nskinfolds, and percent body fat estimated from body density. FFM was estimated by subtracting\nbody fat from body weight, while FFMI was defined as FFM (kilograms) divided by the square of\nbody height (meter2).\nResults: Overall FFM and FFMI were significantly higher in black women than white women (P =\n0.001; P = 0.001 respectively), but similar in black men compared to white men. Age-related decline\nin FFM reached significance level earlier in black men (at age 65\u00ad69) than white men (at age 70\u00ad74),\nand in black women (at age 70\u00ad74) than white women (at age 75\u00ad79). Similar decline in FFMI was\nnoted in men and in women. In multivariate analyses, FFM significantly associated with ethnicity (p\nwomen, FFMI significantly associated with ethnicity (p < 0.001; p = 0.003 respectively) and with age\nConclusion: Age-related loss and decline in FFM and FFMI in older Americans is higher for black\nmen and women, than for white men and women. The development of focused population-based\npreventive strategies is likely to improve functional independence in the aged.\n\u00a9 2005 Obisesan et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0),\nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBackground\nAdvancing age is associated with a number of changes in\nbody composition. Notable among these changes is the\nreduction in FFM, that occurs primarily as a result of losses\nin skeletal muscle mass [1], a condition referred to as sar-\ncopenia. For example, older men aged 80 years or older\nhave 25 percent less leg muscle mass than young men\nbetween the ages of 20 and 29[2]. FFM has been closely\nlinked with reduction in muscle strength in the aged. Fur-\nther, a greater reduction in both muscle mass and strength\nhave been reported in older nursing residents with history\nof falls. Thus reduction in muscular strength is associated\nwith increased risk of falls and hip fracture, and preva-\nlence of disabilities[3]. Independent of fall risk, low FFM\nhas been linked to higher rates of all-cause mortality in\nwomen in the United States[4]. Therefore, losses in FFM\nwith advancing age have important health implications.\nHigher FFM and lean mass to height ratio in Blacks than\nWhites have been reported [5], but mostly in young non-\nrepresentative samples. There is limited information on\nnational estimates, and on the existence of differential\ninfluence of ethnicity on the decline in FFM with increas-\ning age. Given the inverse association of FFM with all\ncause mortality[6] and the reported higher FFM in Blacks,\nlower mortality rates in Blacks would be expected. To the\nconverse, both all cause mortality[7] and FFM are know to\nbe higher in Blacks, suggesting that the relationship of\nFFM with ethnicity and all cause mortality may be due to\nreasons other than differences in absolute FFM. We\nhypothesized that black men and women will have higher\ndegree of age-related decline in FFM and FFMI despite\nhigher mean values in Blacks, using data from NHANES\nIII. The characterization of changes in FFM across several\ndecades of life is crucial to our ability to reduce the burden\nof sarcopenia, osteoporosis, falls and hip fracture, as well\nas associated mortality.\nMethods\nIn order to characterize FFM in older populations in the\nU.S., we analyzed data from NHANES III. The data for\nNHANES III were collected by the National Center for\nHealth Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control and\nmultistage, probability sample of the civilian non-institu-\ntionalized population of the United States. The initial\nmonths to 99 years of age [8]. The survey design ensured\nover-sampling of Blacks, and those 60 years and older.\nData were collected from each participant through face-to-\nface interview, physical examination, and laboratory anal-\nyses. The overall survey design and provisions for\ninformed consent have been previously detailed [8].\nSubjects in the present study included 8,679 non-institu-\ntionalized Whites and Blacks over the age of 40 years. Of\nthis number, complete data on anthropometric measure-\nments were only available for 5,803 persons. Age was cat-\negorized as decades of life up to the age of 79 years, while\npersons ages 80 and older were separately grouped to\navoid over-stratification and loss of statistical power. We\nalso categorized age by increments of 5 years for the pur-\npose of graphical representations only.\nAnthropometric measurements\nWeight and standing height were determined according to\nstandardized procedures [9]. Weight was recorded to the\nnearest 0.01 kg, while height was recorded to the nearest\n0.1 cm. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight\nin kg divided by height in meter squared (m2). Except for\na few measurements that were taken on the left side of the\nbody because of examinees' limitations, the rest of the\nanthropometric measurements were taken on the right\nside of the body using standard procedures and were\nrecorded to the nearest 0.1 mm [9]. All skinfolds were\nmeasured using Holtain skinfold calipers on the right side\nof the body. With the examinee standing erect and the\narms hanging freely at the sides, the triceps skinfold was\nmeasured on the posterior surface at the midpoint of the\nright upper arm. The suprailiac skinfold was measured at\na 45-degree angle at the marked iliac crest. Measurement\nof the thigh skinfold was taken from a vertical line over\nthe quadriceps muscle at midline of the thigh, and half\nway between the top of the patella and the inguinal crease\n[9]. All examiners were trained in standard procedures for\nobtaining measurements. Out-of-range measurements\nwere verified to differentiate errors in measurement from\nhigh values for very small or very large examinees.\nBecause relevant anthropometric measurements were\navailable only for the triceps, suprailium and thigh, body\ndensity was estimated from the sum of 3 skinfolds, (tri-\nceps, suprailium, and thigh) and age, based on the equa-\n[10], and percent body fat was estimated from the Brozek\nequation (percent body fat=((4.570/body density) -\nbody fat from body weight. Based on the analogy of BMI\nand the high correlation between FFM and height, FFMI\nwas derived by dividing FFM (kg) by the square of height\nStatistical analyses\nBecause our primary interest was in how ethnicity influ-\nenced age-related differences or decline in FFM by gender,\ninitial analyses were conducted for each of the 4 demo-\ngraphic subgroups formed by the combination of sex and\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nethnicity. Separate analyses were conducted for each dec-\nade of life beginning from the 4th to the 8th decade. Mean\nvalues were calculated for FFM and FFMI. The 2 and t-test\nstatistics and 95 percent Confidence Interval were used to\ndetermine statistical significance. A General Linear Regres-\nsion Model for continuous variable response, using the\nmethod of weighted least squares adapted to survey data\n[13] was used to test the association between the depend-\nent variable (FFM) and independent variables (age, eth-\nnicity and gender) each in a bivariate model. Similar\nmodels were constructed for FFMI as a second dependent\nvariable. Estimates of individual regression coefficients\n(the vector of beta values) and standard errors were com-\nputed. Because of our interest in how ethnicity influenced\nage-related changes in FFM in men and in women, we\ntested for \"ethnicity*gender\" interaction (dependent vari-\nable = ethnicity, gender, ethnicity*gender); and \"ethnic-\nity*age\" interaction (dependent variable = ethnicity, age\nethnicity*age). Because of the observed gender- and eth-\nnicity interaction, and the differences in FFM and FFMI in\nthe initial analyses, final multiple regression models to\ntest for the associations of ethnicity and age, with FFM and\nFFMI were conducted separately for each gender. The\nmodel for FFM included adjustment for BMI. However,\nbecause FFMI already adjusted for height, the regression\nmodel for FFMI did not include height. This precaution\nwas taken to avoid co-linearity and the bias of structural\nrelationship between FFMI and height. All initial analyses\nwere performed using the Statistical Analysis System\n(SAS) package [14]. Given the multistage complex survey\ndesign of NHANES III, final analyses were conducted in\nSUDAAN (Proc Descript; Proc Regression) to produce a\nmore robust variance estimate [15]. Sample weights were\nincluded in the final analysis to account for over sampling\nand non-response adjustment.\nResults\nSubject characteristics\nthe final analyses (Table 1). Although Blacks had overall\nhigher body weight, standing height and BMI compared\nto Whites, these differences did not reach statistical signif-\nicance. Among women, Blacks weighed more, were taller,\nand had higher body mass index than white women. In\ncontrast, white men had higher waist-hip-ratio and triceps\nskinfold than black men.\nEthnicity-based comparison\nCollectively, mean FFM and FFMI were similar between\nBlacks and Whites. However, when stratified by gender-\nethnicity, black women had higher FFM and FFMI than\n1). The significantly higher FFM and FFMI in black\nwomen persisted through all decades of life, except in the\n8th decade or higher.

This decline varied\nby gender and ethnicity (Figure 1). In Blacks and Whites\nTable 1: Anthropometric measurements and other characteristics of the study sample.

Furthermore, decline in FFMI\nwas noted in black men starting at age 60\u00ad64 and reach-\ndecline started at age 70\u00ad74, and reached significant level\nin the eight decade (of life (p < 0.01).\nMultiple regression analyses\nIn multivariate analysis for the entire group including eth-\nnicity, age and gender, while adjusting for BMI, FFM sig-\nnificantly associated with ethnicity (p < 0.043), age (p <\nmen and for women, FFM significantly associated with\nonly with age (p < 0.001) in men (Table 3). This con-\nfirmed our preliminary observation of higher FFM in\nblack women compared to white women, and significant\nage-related changes in FFM. However, black and white\nmen were similar in FFM. Because FFMI was already\nadjusted for height, the multivariate model for FFMI was\nadjusted for body weight instead of BMI. The association\nof FFMI with ethnicity, age and gender in the entire group\nwas similar to that observed for FFM (all p < 0.001).

These differences were independent of body\nweight. Important differences in age-related decline in\nFFM and FFMI were also noted, starting earlier in black\nmen than white men, but earlier in white women than\nblack women despite a higher decline in black women.\nDespite the earlier onset of decline of FFM and FFMI in\nAge-related changes in fat free mass in older white and black men and women\nAge-related changes in fat free mass in older white and black men and women.

Overall, Blacks had\ngreater decline in FFM than Whites.\nChumlea and colleagues reported higher mean FFM in\nblack men and women compared to white men and\nwomen respectively [16]. An inverse association of FFM\nand FFMI with mortality has been reported [4]. It is not\nknown whether this association is driven by differences in\nFFM and FFMI, or by dissimilarities in the onset of decline\nof FFM and FFMI with increasing age. Because mortality\nrates were reportedly higher for black men than for white\nmen, and for black women than white women, [7] mean\ndifferences in FFM and FFMI are unlikely to significantly\ncontribute to FFM-related mortality rates in Blacks.\nAlthough several causative factors are likely to be contrib-\nutory to mortality rates in different populations, it is also\npossible that age-related changes in FFM and FFMI are\nimportant factors that must be considered in future stud-\nies on mortality and aging. Since clinical interventions to\nattenuate age-dependent decline in FFM are now availa-\nble, longitudinal studies to examine the influence of age-\nrelated decline in FFM and FFMI on mortality patterns is\nimperative.\nBecause of the availability of more sophisticated measures\nof body composition, there has been a great deal of debate\non the clinical utility of anthropometric measurements.\nOur findings of ethnicity-related differences in FFM in this\nstudy, is remarkably similar to recent estimates of FFM by\nChumlea et al who used bioelectrical impedance (BIA)\ndata from NHANES III [16]. Chumlea and colleagues pro-\nvided the first national estimates of body composition as\nreference, to compare other studies. In fact, the age spe-\ncific estimates of FFM in the Chumlea's study are concord-\nant with our anthropometric estimates of FFM for white,\nand for black men and women. The BIA estimates of FFM,\ntogether with our anthropometric-derived FFM from the\nNHANES III, are analogous to DEXA-derived estimates of\nFFM by Gallagher et al [17]. The close approximation of\nour estimates with data from studies that used DEXA to\nestimate FFM supports the use of a generalized equation\nfrom anthropometric measurements to estimate FFM in a\nlarge representative sample, such as NHANES III, espe-\ncially when adjusted for age. Despite the known method-\nological limitations associated with the use of generalized\nequations, our study provides valuable data on national\nestimates of FFM against which other future estimates\nfrom more robust measures can be compared.\nEthnicity-based differences\nMen of both ethnic groups were similar in mean FFM and\nFFMI, whereas, black women had higher body weight,\nFFM and FFMI than white women. Marshall et al and oth-\ners previously reported higher muscle mass in Blacks com-\npared to Whites [18,19]. Comparable to our observation\nof -2.88 kg mean difference in FFM between white women\nand black women in this study, Gallagher et al reported -\n2.22 kg difference in FFM between these 2 groups of\nwomen [17]. Also, Gasperino et al observed greater\nappendicular muscle mass in black women relative to\nwhite women [20]. While black women in our study were\nsignificantly younger than white women, the presence of\ndifferences in FFM that were maintained across several\ndecades of life, argue against differences in age as a likely\nexplanation for the higher FFM in black women. Though\nBlacks in the study were slightly heavier, and anthropo-\nmetric measurements have been reported to over-estimate\nbody density at extremes of body fatness, we found no sta-\ntistically significant difference in mean BMI (a measure of\nbody fatness) between white and black women. This sug-\ngests that bias from differences in body fatness may not\nexplain the observed differences in FFM between the two\ngroups. Additionally, the final multiple regression model\nconfirmed the association of FFMI with ethnicity in men\nTable 3: Regression analysis of fat free mass, and fat free mass index by age in white, and black men and women.

For example, Dowling and Pi-\nSunyer reported higher levels of testosterone and sex hor-\nmone binding globulin in obese black women compared\nto obese white women [21]. Moreover, a 3- to 4-fold\nhigher allele frequency in the human myostatin gene\n(GDF8 \u00ad a gene which codes for muscle mass) was\nreported in Blacks compared to Whites [22]. Higher FFM\nand FFMI in black women compared to white women\ndespite lower levels of physical activity (a major determi-\nnant of FFM) lend additional support to the presence of\nimportant contributing factors at the molecular level.\nAge-related changes\nFFM declined with advancing age starting earlier in black\nmen compared to white men, but earlier in white women\nthan black women (Figures 1). Using age as a continuous\nvariable, Regression analysis showed significant decline in\nFFM and FFMI with increasing age in women (P < 0.001;\nTable 2: Distributions of fat free mass, fat free mass index and body weight in white and black men, and in women.

In a similarly\nadjusted model for men, decline in FFM and FFMI were\nrespectively). This age-related decline in FFM and FFMI\nwere greater for black compared to white women. In men,\ngreater decline in black men than white men. Although\nfindings similar to some of our current observations have\nbeen reported, as far as we know, we are first to report eth-\nnicity-related differential decline in FFM and FFMI with\nadvancing age in the same study, using anthropometric\nmeasurements from a nationally representative sample\n(NHANES III). While our estimates of FFM for white men\nbelow age 70 are in agreement with reports from the Fels\nstudy by Guo and colleagues[23], our estimates for\nwomen were slightly higher, but within reported margins\nof error. Further, the onset of age-related decline in FFM at\nabout age 50 in white men and women in our study are in\nconcordance with the Fels study. The earlier onset of\ndecline in FFM in black men is particularly interesting,\ngiven the similarity in mean body weight, standing height,\nBMI, suprailiac skinfold and body density to that of white\nmen (Table 1). Similarly, white and black women did not\ndiffer significantly with respect to mean standing height,\nthigh skinfold and body density. Of note, is the observa-\ntion of differential onset and decline in FFM and FFMI in\nthis study that appears to parallel mortality patterns for\nthe United States [7]. While underlying disease processes\ncould potentially explain this observation, it is also possi-\nble that age-related decline in FFM and FFMI compared to\nabsolute values may have more important implications\nfor health outcomes. Moreover, low levels of physical\nactivity in Blacks [24] may accelerate the process of sarco-\npenia and unmask several age-related sub-clinical ill-\nnesses. Alternatively, differential reduction in androgen\nand testosterone, reduction in responsiveness to trophic\nhormones [3], growth hormone [25], and insulin-like\ngrowth factors [3] with escalating age may play important\nroles. The relative increase in FFMI in white women is per-\nhaps related to increased risk of osteoporosis-related com-\npression fracture, reduction in standing height, and\nrelative increase in FFMI. Independent reports from\nSchutz et al, and Hughes et al lend support to the observed\nage-related changes in FFMI in white women [26,27].\nWhile decline in FFM in women mirrored changes in body\nweight, we found no consistent pattern of differential\nweight decline between white men and black men. The\nfinding in women is particularly remarkable, since heavier\nbody weight requires higher FFM for support (Table 2).\nNonetheless, a greater reduction in body weight than can\nbe explained by losses in FFM might suggest a greater\nreduction in absolute body fat with increasing age.\nAlthough it is possible that FFMI may overcompensate for\nstanding height, the lack of significant correlation\nbetween FFMI and standing height in this sample makes\nthis unlikely.\nWithin each ethnic group, the decline in FFM and FFMI\nstarted earlier in men than women (Figure 1). This finding\nis consistent with published reports from others who\nshowed linear decline in skeletal muscle mass with\nadvancing age[28,29]. Unfortunately, many of the previ-\nous studies lacked the ethnic stratification, sample size\nand representativeness of the current study. Similar to our\nfindings of gender-based differential decline in FFM, a\nJapanese study reported decreases in lean body mass in\nJapanese men but not in women[30]. While our current\nanthropometric estimates of FFM and FFMI from the\nNHANES III study may be at variance with estimates from\na limited number of studies that showed loss of skeletal\nmuscle mass in the 3rd decade of life[17], several other\nstudies that used more robust methods to estimate skele-\ntions. Altogether, our study supports the presence of\nhigher mean FFM in black women than white women,\nearlier onset of decline in FFM and FFMI in black men\nthan white men respectively (Figures 1 and 2), and greater\nage-related decline in black men and women than in\nwhite men and women. Additionally, it provides support\nfor the use of anthropometric measurements to estimate\nFFM in large epidemiological studies.\nLimitations\nThe observations from this study are subject to a number\nof limitations. First, at extremes of BMI and body fat, there\nis bias in the use of skinfold-thickness measurements to\nestimate body density from which percent body fat is\ndetermined. This concern is heightened in the aged\nbecause of increased centripetal fat distribution. Fortu-\nnately, Pollock's equation included adjustment for age\nand the final regression model in our study was addition-\nally adjusted for BMI. While population-specific equa-\ntions are appropriate alternatives and sometimes provide\nmore accurate estimates, they are limited in generalizabil-\nity. Though the equation used in the present study has\ngreater applicability to women than men, its selection was\nbased on the available anthropometric measurements in\nthe NHANES III data.\nBecause the Pollock equation was not derived from the\nNHANES sample, it is possible that it may not predict\nbody density with the same degree of precision compared\nto the original parent sample [33]. Further, the cross-sec-\ntional nature of the NHANES III data makes it possible\nthat changes in FFM with advancing age may have been\nunderestimated, given known estimates from\nlongitudinal studies [34]. These concerns are minimized\nby the similarities of our findings with that of studies\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nusing Bioelectrical Impedance and DEXA to estimate FFM,\nand therefore, may not reduce the significance of the pop-\nulation-based observation from the current study. Inter-,\nintra-observer's and instrument bias appear unlikely in\nthe NHANES given the uniform procedural standards for\nanthropometric measurements. Despite these limitations,\nthe use of anthropometric measurements to estimate FFM\nand changes in FFM is simple, low cost, and has a predic-\ntive value of within 3 to 4 percent for 70 percent of the\npopulation [33,35] especially when adjusted for age.\nFinally, the unique strengths of the study include large\nsample size, standardized procedure for anthropometric\nmeasurements and its applicability to the entire United\nStates population.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, we provide additional support for the dif-\nferential effect of ethnicity on the loss of FFM and FFMI as\nthe population ages. Regardless of the explanation for\nthese differences, losses in muscle mass have several\nimportant health consequences, and perhaps more so for\nFFM decline. Most notable among these is increased func-\ntional dependency and mortality. This underscores the\npublic health imperative of an ongoing epidemiological\nsurveillance of the variations in FFM. If properly imple-\nmented, public health strategies may facilitate the design\nof targeted optimization of functional independency as\nthe United States population ages.\nAbbreviations\nFat free mass (FFM); Fat free mass index (FFMI); Body\nmass index (BMI); The Third National Health and Nutri-\ntion Examination Survey (NHANES III)\nCompeting interests\nThe author(s) declare that they have no competing\ninterests.\nAuthors' contributions\nTOO conceived the study, participated in the design, per-\nformed statistical analysis and writing of the manuscript;\nMHA participated in the design, performed statistical\nanalysis and writing of the manuscript; VB participated in\nthe analysis and writing of the manuscript; RGA\nparticipated in conceiving and drafting of the manuscript,\nAA participated in the drafting of the manuscript, CNR\nparticipated in study design, statistical analyses and draft-\ning of the manuscript\nAge-related changes in fat free mass index in older white and black men and women\nAge-related changes in fat free mass index in older white and black men and women.
