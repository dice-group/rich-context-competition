Previous study has demonstrated that pa\u00ad tients in man age d care are less likely than patients with indemnity insuranc e to se e a dermatologist for skin problems, and it was predi c te d that this would result in a slowing in the demand for dermatologist servic es. To ex am in e whether the changing health\u00ad care en viron 1n e n t has resulted in fewer visits to der\u00ad matolo gists , we used N ati on al Ambulatory Medical Care Su rvey data from the ye ars 1990-1992 to exam \u00ad ine utilization of dermatologist services over a period in which man ag ed care grew by 32%. Patients with HMO/prepaid in suran ce were less likely to have their skin care provided by dermatologists than patien ts with commercial insurance (Blue Cross/Bl ue Shield\n\n\nT\n\nand other commercial carriers) or Medicare. A reduc\u00ad tion in the number of visits to dermatologists was observed among patients with HMO/prep aid insur\u00ad ance despite the growth in HMO/prepaid insurance as a form of payment; when all payors were considered, however, the number of visits to dermatologists in\u00ad creased from the 1989 level, reaching a plateau in 1992. The number of visits for skin disease to all physicians increased from 56.5 million to 63. 5 mil\u00ad lion, whereas the proportion of this care delivered by dermatologists decreased from 39 .6% to 37 . 9%. The overall increase in visits for skin conditions tempered the reduction in demand for dermatology services expected with the growing transition to managed care.

To detern1ine ,Nhcther the study in terva l was su ffic ie nt ly long to dete ct cha nges in pract ice patterns due to managed care, we determined the total num ber of visit s for all problems covered by HMO/prepaid insurance. Over the study interval of 1990-1992. HMO / pre p a id insuran ce increa se d from 14.5'\u00bc, of all visits (1.01 X 10 8 visits) in 1990 to 19.2% (1.46 X '10 8 visits) in 1992 . Thus, there was a 32% in crease in the p erce ntag e of visit s covered by H MO / prepa id in surance (and a 45% inc r e a s e in the actua l num be r of visits cove red by H MO / prepa id insur an ce). T his s u bsta ntial increase in the number of visit s cove red by HMO/prepaid insur  a n ce provides a methodologic basis for studying  t he effect of managed care o .n practice patten1s.\n To define dermato logi c diagno ses, the en tir e d e rmat o log ist sub samp le was extracted fron1 the  l 990 nation.a] data base, a nd prin1ary, scco n,d u y,  or te rti a ry diagnoses rep rese n ting greater than 0.1% of visits to these clin ic ian s were i d enti fied.

Data presented here show in g lo nger visit times for patients seen by non-dermatologists 11ers11s dermatologists adds important eviden ce that fewer reso urce s are used when dermatologists arc\n\nand Baker, 1.995). T he trends that we observed in a variety of areas could have a sig n ificant impact on dermato log y.\n\nrespo ns ible for the treatment of skin disease. W hi le shorter visit \n\ntimes to dermatologists could also be ex plained by less comp lex visits, we feel it is a reasona ble ass ump tion that the complexity of care of patients under the care of dermatologists is at le ast as great as that of patients with skin disease cared for by non-dermatologists. With the growth of managed care, we expect the complexity of care provided by dermatologists to in crease, as on l y patients with more severe skin disease are refe rred. T his also imp lies greater complex i ty of skin care for the non-d e rma tologi sts, as they begin to care for patients they previously wou ld have referred. T he o bserved increased visit duration for both the dermatologists and the non\u00ad dermato log ists is co mpa tib le with this hypothes is. T his raises another quest io n for dermatology to consid er: what can we do to im pro ve non-dermatogists' abilities to handl e the greater quantity an d n e w dist1ibution of skin condit io ns for whi c h they care Qohn so n, 1994)? Ano ther observation of this st ud y is the decreasing proportion of patients referred to dermatologists from ot her phy\u00ad sicians. Resentment to this and to the changes in the health-care\n. syste rn may complicate the que stion of how to best ed ucate non-dermatolog ists (Little et al , 1993 ).\nT he NAM CS pro vide s a com pre hens ive assessment of o u tpa tient\nmed ic a l services provided in the United States and permits ana lysis of outpatient dermatologic care. Since  Me ndenhal  l\u00b7  et  al (1978) fo un d that 97'X, of all dermato logi c serv ice s are performed ou tsid e the hospital sett ing, estimates of outpatient care, as found in the NAMCS, shou ld mirror the vast majority of skin disease care. Certain limi tations of this analysis of data supp li e d by tl1e NAM CS deser ve me ntion. The patient population within managed care may be sig ni ficantly different from the traditional insurance plan popu\u00ad lation, espec ially in regard to chronic diseases. We have attempted to address this problem by ana lyzi11g visits for specific skin cond i\u00ad tions; the finding of lower dermatologist utilization within man\u00ad aged care is still observed. Another li m itat io n is the variability in the data under cond itio ns with fewe r visits\u00b7, such as in the data for speci fic diagnos es in Table VI. This is a statistica l effect of the sma ll sa mp le re pres entin g data on specific diagno ses. Such data shou ld be interpreted caut io us ly but may be useful for suc h purposes as determining the most common sk in cond itions for future a n a lyses or ed uca tio nal programs. T he ex clus io n of federally emp lo yed physicians from the NAMCS database may also co ntt\u00b7ibu te to under-reporting of dermato logic disorders. A lso, the nature of the sur vey does not pe rm it verification of dermatologic diagnoses. It is possibl e, there fore, that misclassification of cutaneo us diso rder s occurred; this limit atio n is not l.i ke l y to im pact significantly the numb er of visits for all skin cond itio ns, however. Since NAM CS data are based on utilization of hea lth- care services, they do not perm i t c alc ulatio n of cutaneous disease inciden ce or preva lence rates in the U nited States.\n Perhaps the most imp ortant limitation of this ana lysis is the sho rt (3-y) pe1i o d co ve red by the ana lysis. T re nd s observed over th.is pe1\u00b7io d may not dete ct the full impact of managed care and may not refle ct the lo ng - term changes that are occurr in g in this area. T he reliability of hea lth ser vices pred ictions based on c urrent trends is li mi ted but is bett er than predict io ns no t based on data (Bilheimer and Reischauer, 1995) . T he imp act of managed care on dermatol\u00ad ogists appears to have been temp ered by the rapid overa ll growth in visits fo r skin care. This rapid growth may be due to successf u l efforts to increase the visibili ty of our specialty and to focus attention on disorders of the ski n. As this gro wth reaches a plateau, we can ex pect a much greate r elfect of managed care on  the pract ic e of Derm ato log y.\n Despite these limitations, ana lysis of the 1990 to 1992 NAM CS data demonst ra te the availability of these data for analysis and their potent ia l for monitoring U.S. h ea lth- ca re delivery. A sh ift in the paradigm of health-care delivery is occ urr ing, and physician s are choos in g pra ct ice setti n gs to acco mmodate this change (H ugh es\n\n\n\n\nREFERENCES\nl:3ilhc i.mcr LT. ll ci schauc r lill : Co nfess io ns of rl11.:\u00b7 es t ima to rs: num ber s and hea lth\nClcr nc n t DG.
