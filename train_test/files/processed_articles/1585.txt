It accounts for\nnearly one in three hospital discharges in which a cardiac\narrhythmia is listed as the principal diagnosis (3).\nEpidemiologic cohort studies have shown that the preva-\nlence of atrial fibrillation increases markedly with age in\nolder adults, from less than 1 percent for those younger than\nolder (1, 2, 4, 5). In the Framingham Heart Study cohort,\nmen had a higher prevalence than women regardless of age\namong Framingham subjects aged 65\u00ad84 years showed an\nincrease in prevalence of atrial fibrillation from 3.2 to 9.1\npercent in men and from 2.8 to 4.7 percent in women (4). In\na recent study of health maintenance organization enrollees,\nthe prevalence of diagnosed atrial fibrillation among per-\nsons aged 50 years or older was higher in Whites than in\nis an important marker for the presence of other cardiovas-\ncular diseases and a powerful independent predictor of mor-\nbidity and mortality (6).\nAtrial fibrillation is an independent risk factor for stroke,\nwith the attributable risk increasing with age to about 25 per-\ncent for adults aged 80 years or older (7). A report from the\nFramingham Heart Study (8) identified risk factors for\nchronic or transient atrial fibrillation after 38 years of follow-\nup. These included male sex, age, congestive heart failure,\nvalvular heart disease, a history of myocardial infarction,\nhypertension, and diabetes (8). In the Cardiovascular Health\nStudy, left atrial size was also a strong independent predictor\nof incidence during 3 years of follow-up, a finding that sug-\ngests a cause for, not a consequence of, atrial fibrillation (9).\nLevels of blood pressure and glucose were also more impor-\ntant as predictors than was diagnosis of high blood pressure\nand diabetes (9).\nMuch of our knowledge of the prognosis and predispos-\ning conditions for atrial fibrillation is provided by cohort\nstudies and is based on predominantly White cohorts.\nNational mortality patterns in population groups defined by\nrace, sex, and age have not been reported. Multiple-cause\nevaluate not only national trends in reporting the presence of\natrial fibrillation as a cause of death in the US population but\nalso the frequency of coexisting conditions contributing to\ndeath.\nThe National Center for Health Statistics, Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention, compiles data on all deaths\noccurring annually in the United States from vital records of\nstates and the District of Columbia (10, 11). Public use data\nfiles contain the underlying cause, up to 19 additional con-\ntributing causes, and demographic data. At the state vital\nstatistics office, information from death certificates is\nentered into electronic records. All of the diseases and con-\nditions reported on death certificates from 1979 through\n1998 used codes from the International Classification of\nDiseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) (12). The underlying\ncause of death is the disease (or injury) that initiated the\nsequence of events leading directly to death. Usually, the\nunderlying cause of death is the condition reported on the\nlowest line in part I of the death certificate. In some cases,\nhowever, the interpretations of individual physicians are\noverruled on the basis of international selection and modifi-\ncation rules to select a condition of greater public interest or\nto correct for poor reporting practices (10). In this report,\natrial fibrillation is defined for decedents with ICD-9 code\n427.3 mentioned as either the underlying cause or as a con-\ntributory (any one of the possible 20 conditions on the death\ncertificate) cause of death. This code includes both atrial\nfibrillation and atrial flutter.\nWe limited the National Center for Health Statistics\nmultiple-cause mortality data to deaths occurring in the 50\nstates and the District of Columbia among US residents. We\nber and age-standardized rate of decedents aged 45 years or\nolder with atrial fibrillation reported as one of up to 20 con-\nditions on the death certificate, the age distribution, and the\npercentage of persons with atrial fibrillation reported as the\nunderlying cause of death. Persons aged less than 45 years\naccounted for less than 0.2 percent of all decedents with\natrial fibrillation.\nAge-standardized death rates were estimated by race\n(Black and White) and sex for atrial fibrillation as a multi-\nAll races other than Black or White combined contributed to\napproximately 1 percent of decedents with atrial fibrillation.\nDetailed race groups were too few to provide comparable\nresults. Projections of the US resident population by age,\nsex, and race from the US Bureau of the Census were used\nto calculate age-, race-, and sex-specific death rates per\nusing the direct method for adjustment to the year 2000\nstandard population aged 45 years and older (13). Annual\npercentage changes in death rates were estimated with log-\nlinear regression (14).

Among these, hypertensive disease, ischemic heart\ndisease, cardiac arrest, heart failure, and cerebrovascular\ndisease were prominent in all groups. Hypertensive disease\nwas notably more frequent in Blacks than in Whites (30 vs.\n19 percent). Diseases of the respiratory system, particularly\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease, accompanied atrial\nfibrillation in a greater percentage of men than women (35\nvs. 25 percent). Endocrine, nutritional, and metabolic dis-\neases and immunity disorders, particularly diabetes, were\ncomorbidities for roughly 20 percent of decedents with\natrial fibrillation.

Age-specific rates by race showed\nthat White decedents aged 85 or more years had twice the\nrate for atrial fibrillation as that associated with death than\nity (number of deaths associated with atrial fibrillation\ndivided by the total deaths) also increased over time and was\ngreatest for White women, who tend to live longer (data not\nshown).\nThe observed increase in mortality associated with atrial\nfibrillation sharply contrasts with the decline in death rates\nsince the midcentury from most heart diseases, such as\ncoronary heart disease, hypertensive disease, and rheumatic\ndisease (15). Prolonged survival with diseases associated\nwith atrial fibrillation, such as coronary heart disease,\nischemic heart disease, and hypertensive disease, may have\nresulted in more cases of atrial fibrillation. As the proportion\nof elderly adults in the US population increases, atrial fibril-\nlation will continue to be a more frequent diagnosis. Another\nfactor that contributes to the increase in mortality associated\natrial fibrillation is the growing prevalence of diabetes mel-\nlitus among older persons (16). With the higher prevalence\nof atrial fibrillation and associated clinical cardiovascular\ndiseases among older adults and the contemporary appreci-\nation of the importance of anticoagulation therapy in pre-\nventing stroke, both incidence and recognition of atrial\nfibrillation have grown and will likely continue to increase\nover time.\nInvestigators for a Danish hospital-based study noted a\ntality in patients with atrial fibrillation; however, hospital\ndischarges for atrial fibrillation increased over the same\nperiod (17). The number of hospitalizations related to atrial\nfibrillation in Scotland has also increased dramatically in\nTABLE 3.

By contrast,\npopulation-based studies have suggested that hypertension\nwas the most common underlying medical problem in\npatients with atrial fibrillation (8). The observed decrease in\nmortality for patients with atrial fibrillation suggests that\nhospital-based analyses may not represent a true reflection\nof mortality. There is some speculation that the risk of in-\nhospital death declined due to changes in admission and dis-\ncharge practices with a tendency toward earlier discharges\nto nursing homes and convalescent facilities. Furthermore,\ncontemporary data from large, population-based surveys of\natrial fibrillation are needed to examine the impact of\ncomorbid conditions on the treatment and management of\natrial fibrillation.\nThe increase in reporting of atrial fibrillation as an under-\nlying cause or a multiple cause on the death certificate was\nTABLE 4.

Added\ninstructions about cause of death stated, \"Do not enter the\nmode of dying, such as cardiac or respiratory arrest, shock,\nor heart failure.\" However, heart failure and cardiac arrest\nwere listed as a coexisting conditions at death for approxi-\nmately 30 and 16 percent, respectively, of decedents with\natrial fibrillation. It is possible that the instruction about\ncardiac arrest and heart failure influenced reporting of atrial\nfibrillation as the underlying cause. The 1989 revised death\ncertificate probably did not affect the increasing trend in\ndeaths with atrial fibrillation listed as a contributory cause,\nhowever. Medicare data indicate a similar increasing trend\nof patients with atrial fibrillation (19). The availability of\nmore advanced diagnostic tools such as ultrasound and elec-\ntrographic monitoring likely contribute to the increased\ndiagnosis of atrial fibrillation.\nRegardless of the underlying cause, approximately 87\npercent of all decedents had at least one disease of the cir-\nculatory system other than atrial fibrillation listed on the\ndeath certificate. Ischemic heart disease was one of the lead-\ning comorbidities and was observed more often among\nWhite (37 percent) than among Black (30 percent) dece-\ndents. Cerebrovascular disease/stroke was a coexisting con-\ndition contributing to death in approximately 27 percent of\nmale decedents and 34 percent of female decedents.\nHypertensive disease as a comorbid condition was more fre-\nquent among Blacks than among Whites (30 vs. 19 percent,\nrespectively). Diseases of the respiratory system and neo-\nplasms were more common among male than among female\ndecedents. These coexisting conditions contributing to death\nreflect the independent risk factors predisposing to the\ndevelopment of atrial fibrillation identified in population-\nbased cohort studies (8, 9) and concomitant diagnoses\nobserved in hospital-based studies (17, 18).\nThe quality and completeness of the mortality data from\nthe vital statistics system is a major strength of this study.\nThat data source is unmatched in terms of universal coverage\nand standardization. Information that the national vital statis-\ntics system provides is often used in state and national initia-\ntives to influence and target the direction of public health\nefforts. The widespread use of these data, however, has\nraised questions regarding the reliability and validity of\ncause-of-death information from the death certificate (20,\n21). There is some lack of precision in cause-of-death speci-\nfications by physicians and of biases in the data on the under-\nlying cause of death due to the coding protocols used. A\nlimitation of the multiple-cause mortality records is that there\nis no verification of the death certificate data. There is also a\ngeneral lack of resources to conduct cause-of-death queries\nwith the certifying physician to clarify illegible, imprecise, or\nnonspecific entries. The reliability and accuracy of underly-\ning cause depends on the medical certifier of each death as\nwell as on automated software and the state and national\nnosologists who determine the codes and underlying cause.\nThe observations presented indicate that death associated\nwith atrial fibrillation has risen and will likely continue to\nrise. As the elderly population in the United States increases\nin size, the public health burden of atrial fibrillation will\nassume more importance. In a prospective cohort study of\nhospitalized Medicare patients, the net impact of atrial\nfibrillation on mortality, stroke, and medical costs was stud-\nied (22). Total Medicare spending was greater in patients\nwith than in those without atrial fibrillation (9\u00ad23 percent\ngreater in men and 10\u00ad11 percent greater in women).\nTreatment of hypertension and diabetes and prevention of\nother cardiovascular diseases associated with atrial fibrilla-\ntion may help reduce its prevalence. Anticoagulants have\nbeen shown to reduce stroke by 68 percent in eligible\npatients with atrial fibrillation (23). Nevertheless, a recent\nstudy in the United Kingdom suggests that only 23 percent\nof atrial fibrillation patients use anticoagulants and that use\nwas lowest among elderly women, who might benefit the\nThe frequency with which atrial fibrillation is reported on\ndeath certificates as a contributory cause of mortality has\nincreased in the United States over the last 2 decades. This\ntrend is likely to continue as the US population ages. Effective\nanticoagulation, heart rate control, and conversion of atrial\nfibrillation to normal sinus rhythm are expected to decrease\ncardiovascular complications. Prevention of atrial fibrillation\nin the first place, through the identification of modifiable risk\nfactors and their effective treatment and control in those at\nrisk for developing this condition, must be pursued and rec-\nognized as complementary management strategies for reduc-\ning cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.\nREFERENCES\n1.
