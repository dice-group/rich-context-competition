De-\npression severity was assessed with the Quick Inventory\nof Depressive Symptomatology Self-Report.

More Ameri-\ncans with recent major depression used psychotherapy\nover pharmacotherapy, and these differences were most\npronounced among Mexican American and African\nAmerican individuals. This report underscores the im-\nportance of disaggregating ethnic/racial groups and de-\npression therapies in understanding and directing ef-\nforts to improve depression care in the United States.\nunipolar depression is\nprojected to be the sec-\nond leading cause of dis-\nability worldwide and the\nleading cause of disability in high-\nincome nations, including the United\nStates.1 Within the United States, depres-\nsion is a leading cause of disability among\nmajor ethnic and racial groups.2 There are\n2 main modalities of depression care that\nare efficacious and well tolerated, pro-\nvided that they are concordant with ex-\ntant treatment guidelines: pharmaco-\ntherapy and psychotherapy.3 Nevertheless,\nmost Americans who meet diagnostic cri-\nteria for major depression are untreated or\nundertreated.4,5 Except for clinical samples,\ndepression treatments are commonly ag-\ngregated (ie, pharmacotherapy and psy-\nchotherapy) in national studies and it is\nunclear which treatments are used.6 Fur-\nthermore, because major ethnic/racial\ngroups are aggregated (ie, all Latino indi-\nviduals as opposed to specific sub-\ngroups) in national studies, a practice dis-\ncouraged by the Surgeon General and the\nNational Institutes of Health, it is un-\nclear if important ethnic/racial group dif-\nferences are missed.7\nTheInstituteofMedicineUnequalTreat-\nment committee defined a disparity as\nracial or ethnic differences in the quality of\nhealth care that are not due to access-related\nfactors or clinical needs, preferences, and ap-\npropriateness of intervention.8(p32)\nThe purpose of this study was to use this\nInstitute of Medicine definition of dispar-\nity in an examination of depression care\namongethnic/racialminoritiesintheUnited\nStates.Toevaluateaccess-relatedfactors,fac-\nAuthor Affiliations: Institute of\nGerontology and Department of\nFamily Medicine and Public\nHealth Sciences, Wayne State\nUniversity, Detroit\n(Dr Gonza\n\u00b4lez and Mr Tarraf),\nand Institute of Social Research,\nProgram for Research on Black\nAmericans (Drs Gonza\n\u00b4lez and\nNeighbors), and Center for\nStatistical Consultation and\nResearch (Mr West), University\nof Michigan, Ann Arbor;\nDepartment of Family\nMedicine, University of\nCalifornia, Los Angeles\n(Dr Vega); and Department of\nSociety, Human Development,\nand Health, Harvard School of\nPublic Health, Boston,\nMassachusetts (Dr Williams).\n\u00a92010 American Medical Association.

Patterns of depres-\nsion treatment use by ethnic/racial groups meeting major\ndepression criteria were used as a proxy for preferences.\nToevaluatetheappropriatenessofinterventions,onlyadults\nwho met diagnostic criteria for 12-month major depres-\nsion were examined. To achieve these objectives, data dis-\naggregated by ethnic/racial groups were used that in-\ncluded depression treatment modalities and adequacy of\ntreatment among nationally representative samples of US\nadults who met criteria for 12-month major depression.\nTo better understand patterns of depression care among\ndiverse ethnic/racial groups and formally evaluate Insti-\ntute of Medicine\u00adbased disparity criteria, we applied a\nmodification of the Andersen behavioral model of health\nservices use to analyses of nationally representative popu-\nlation survey data.9 The behavioral model posits 3 ma-\njor factors (ie, predisposing, health need, and enabling)\nrelated to accessing health services. We predicted that\npredisposing factors, particularly ethnic/racial, would be\nassociated with access to depression care. Second, we ex-\npected that health needs would not differ between ethnic/\nracial groups. Next, we anticipated that access-related fac-\ntors would be associated with care but not appreciably\naffect ethnic/racial differences in depression care.\nMETHODS\nThe National Institute of Mental Health Collaborative Psychi-\natric Epidemiology Surveys (CPES) initiative combines 3 na-\ntionally representative studies: the National Survey of Ameri-\ncan Life, the National Comorbidity Survey Replication, and the\nNational Latino and Asian American Study. The CPES data were\npling weights accounting for unequal probability of selection\ninto the CPES samples and nonresponse rates were created by\nCPES staff to enable nationally representative analyses of pairs\nof studies within the CPES. These weights were incorporated\nin all analyses presented in this study, allowing for the genera-\ntion of population estimates by analyzing data specific to popu-\nlations of interest.10 The CPES data collection used complex\nmultistage area probability sampling methods using sampling\nframes and sample selection procedures developed as a part of\nthe University of Michigan Survey Research Center National\nSample Design.11 The method used to integrate the individual\nCPES studies was based on a multiple-frame approach adapted\nThe CPES interviewers used face-to-face computer-\nassisted interview technology to collect data from integrated\nnational household probability samples of noninstitutional-\nized adults. Specially trained nonclinician interviewers admin-\nistered to respondents the World Mental Health (WMH) Com-\nposite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), which can be\nused to compute indicators of past-year DSM-IV diagnoses of\na major depressive episode.14 Fair to good concordance values\nhave been reported between nonclinician-administered WMH-\nCIDIs and clinician-administered Structured Clinical Inter-\nview for DSM-IV reappraisals.15,16 The overall CPES response\nrate was 72.3%. Final response rates for the CPES sample de-\nsign were computed following the best-practice guidelines of\nthe American Association for Public Opinion Research, incor-\nporating disproportionate sampling, household screening, and\n2-phase sampling for nonresponse follow-up.11\nWe examined depression care among 5 major ethnic/racial\ngroups who self-identified as Mexican, Puerto Rican, Carib-\nbean black, African American, and non-Latino white. Our pri-\nmary interest was in depression care among the subpopula-\ntion who met DSM-IV criteria for 12-month major depression\nderived from the WMH-CIDI. Ethnicity/race was the primary\npredictor of the main depression care outcome measures (see\nlater). Appropriate methods for subpopulation analyses of com-\nplex sample survey data were used for estimation of descrip-\ntive parameters and estimation of analytic models.17,18\nTwo groups of depression care outcomes were examined: phar-\nmacotherapy and psychotherapy. With pharmacotherapy, anti-\ndepressant agent use was determined by self-report and pill bottle\ninventories. Trained interviewers recorded prescription antide-\npressant generic and trade names from pill bottles during inter-\nviews. Generic and trade names were reviewed by 2 board-\ncertified psychiatrists and a psychiatric nurse specialist to verify\nthat the drugs were antidepressants prior to drug coding for the\nanalyses.Forpsychotherapy,respondentswereasked\"Howmany\nvisits\" were made to a mental health professional (ie, psychia-\ntrist,psychologist,counselor,socialworker,andotherhealthpro-\nfessionals)\"inthepast12months?\"and\"Howmanyminutesthese\nvisits lasted on average?\" Lay counselors (eg, pastors) were ex-\ncluded. The following indicators of past 12-month use of depres-\nsion care were computed for analysis purposes: (1) any pharma-\ncotherapy;(2)anypsychotherapy;(3)eitheroftheaforementioned\ntypes of therapy; and (4) combined therapies.\nTodeterminetheadequacyoftreatment,wereliedontheAmeri-\ncanPsychiatricAssociationPracticeGuidelinefortheTreatmentof\nPatientsWithMajorDepressiveDisorder.3 Inthisstudy,guideline-\nconcordant pharmacotherapy was defined as the use of an anti-\ndepressant for at least 60 days with supervision by a psychiatrist,\nor other prescribing clinician, for at least 4 visits in the past year.\nForpsychotherapy,guidelineconcordancewasoperationalizedas\nhaving at least 4 visits to a mental health professional in the past\nyear lasting on average for at least 30 minutes each.\nEthnicity/race was the primary Andersen model predisposing\nfactor predictor used among the subpopulation who met 12-\nmonth major depression criteria. The 5 major ethnic/racial\ngroups examined were Mexican American, Puerto Rican, Ca-\nribbean black, African American, and non-Latino white (ref-\nerence group).\nTo determine if the need for depression care differed between\nethnic/racial groups, we compared symptom severity ratings\nbetween groups. The Quick Inventory of Depressive Symp-\ntomatology Self-Report was used to measure symptom sever-\nity during the worst 2-week period of the past year.19 The Quick\nInventory of Depressive Symptomatology Self-Report is a brief\nand reliable test that has been validated using other estab-\nlished measures of depression severity (eg, 24-item Hamilton\nDepression Rating Scale). We opted to compare depression se-\nverity ratings (as opposed to symptom counts) since they are a\ncommonly used indicator of need for treatment in clinical trials.\n\u00a92010 American Medical Association.

Ages were grouped into 3 cat-\ncovariates represented Andersen model enabling factors and in-\ncluded categorical measures of family income ($18 000;\ninsurance, and household income. Health insurance coverage\nincluded Medicare, Medicaid, or TRICARE/CHAMPUS; cur-\nrent or former employee-based coverage; and coverage pur-\nchased directly from an insurance company (including group\npurchasing, eg, AARP [formerly known as the American As-\nsociation of Retired Persons]).\nProcedures designed for the analysis of complex sample sur-\nvey data in the Stata software package were used for analyses\non all subpopulations.20 All statistical estimates were weighted,\nusing the CPES sampling weights to account for individual-\nlevel unequal probabilities of selection into the samples, indi-\nvidual nonresponse, and additional poststratification to en-\nsure representation of the US population.11 Design-based\nanalyses, specifically a Taylor series linearization approach to\nvariance estimation, were used to account for the complex mul-\ntistage clustered design of the CPES samples when computing\nestimated standard errors.21\nFirst, sample estimates describing demographic character-\nistics were calculated. Next, ordinary least squares regression\nmodels were used to compare the depression severity between\nthe 5 ethnic/racial groups. The following analyses were exclu-\nsively focused on the subpopulation of respondents who met\nWMH-CIDI 12-month major depression criteria. Then, the\nprevalence of any past-year depression pharmacotherapy and\npsychotherapy and guideline-concordant therapies use was cal-\nculated. Finally, 6 multivariate logistic regression models were\nfitted. The first set of 3 models was used to predict the prob-\nability of pharmacotherapy and/or psychotherapy use by the 5\ngroups of interest. The second set of models was used to pre-\ndict the probability of receiving guideline-concordant, mini-\nmally adequate pharmacotherapy and/or psychotherapy.\nRESULTS\nThe CPES sample characteristics and prevalence esti-\nmates of 12-month major depression for the 5 ethnic/\nracial groups are provided in Table 1.\nThe mean values for Quick Inventory of Depressive Symp-\ntomatology Self-Report scores between ethnic/racial\ngroups were similar (Table 1). Among respondents meet-\ning 12-month major depression criteria, Mexican Ameri-\ncan, African American, and non-Latino white individu-\nals had similar depression severity rating scores, which\nwere slightly higher than those of Puerto Rican and Ca-\nribbean black individuals. The estimates of the multi-\nvariate regression model for our severity outcome, con-\ntrolling for age and sex, show that ethnic/racial groups\ndid not differ in their mean level of severity relative to\nTable 1.

Further, a Wald test\n=0.66) showed that the coefficients for the ethnic/\nracial dummy variables were not jointly different than\nzero (probabilityF=0.62). These findings indicated that\ndepression treatment need was not significantly differ-\nent and therefore was not included in subsequent statis-\ntical models.\nOverall, about 1 in 3 respondents who met WMH-CIDI\ncriteria for 12-month major depression reported having\nused an antidepressant agent in the past year (Table 2).\nPuerto Rican and non-Latino white individuals re-\nported the highest use, whereas Mexican American, Ca-\nribbean black, and African American individuals re-\nported the lowest use of pharmacotherapy.\nAmong pharmacotherapy users, about one-third had\nused antidepressant agents according to the study crite-\nria. The guideline-concordant use was highest among\nPuerto Rican and non-Latino white individuals and low-\nest among Mexican American, Caribbean black, and Afri-\ncan American individuals.\nPsychotherapy use was higher than pharmacotherapy\nuse overall. A similar pattern emerged, with Puerto\nRican and non-Latino white individuals reporting the\nhighest use of psychotherapy, and Mexican American,\nCaribbean black, and African American individuals\nreporting the lowest use.\nThe proportions of psychotherapy use that were guide-\nline concordant were higher than for depression phar-\nmacotherapy use. Notably, those proportions were es-\npecially higher among Mexican American, Caribbean\nblack, and African American individuals. In a separate\nlogistic regression analysis (not shown), African Ameri-\ncan individuals (odds ratio [OR], 2.65; 95% confidence\ninterval [CI], 1.47-4.77) reported significantly higher odds\nof psychotherapy use compared with pharmacotherapy\nuse relative to non-Latino white individuals; however,\nfor Mexican American individuals (OR, 1.58; 95% CI,\nent. The proportions of concordant psychotherapy were\nhigher for each ethnic/racial group examined compared\nwith pharmacotherapy. This suggests that in terms of de-\npression care, although still too low, the adherence rate\nfor psychotherapy was higher than for pharmaco-\ntherapy.\nMore than half of the respondents who met study crite-\nria for 12-month major depression received at least 1 form\nof depression care. As before, Mexican American, Carib-\nbean black, and African American individuals were the\nleast likely to have used either pharmacotherapy or psy-\nchotherapy in the past year.

We examined the proportions of\nconcordantdepressiontherapiesamongrespondentsusing\nboth therapies (not shown). Most combined therapies use\n(39.7%) did not meet guideline criteria for either treat-\nment type. About one-third (32.1%) used both thera-\npies according to guidelines, followed by psycho-\ntherapy alone (20.5%) and pharmacotherapy only (7.8%).\nThese proportions did not vary significantly between eth-\nnic/racial groups.\nThe predisposing factors predicting past-year depression\npharmacotherapy are shown in the first model of Table 3.\nCompared with non-Latino white individuals, Mexican\nAmerican and African American individuals had signifi-\ncantly lower odds of past-year depression pharmaco-\ntherapy.

The\nlower odds of psychotherapy use by Mexican American\nindividuals was reduced to marginal significance by in-\nclusion of enabling factors in the previous model, but the\nsignificantly low odds of psychotherapy use by African\nAmerican individuals was largely unaffected. Health in-\nsurance coverage was associated with significantly in-\ncreased odds of psychotherapy use.\nFor guideline-concordant psychotherapy use, Afri-\ncan American individuals had significantly lower odds\ncompared with non-Latino white individuals, and there\nwas a trend for lower concordant use by Mexican Ameri-\ncan individuals. When enabling factors were intro-\nduced into the model, the statistically significant or nearly\nsignificant associations for African American and Mexi-\ncan American individuals were markedly reduced. Of the\nenabling factors, education beyond high school level was\nassociated with significantly increased odds of concor-\ndant psychotherapy use.\nMexican American and African American individuals had\nsignificantly lower odds of any depression therapy use\n(ie, psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy) than non-\nLatino white individuals (Table 5). When enabling fac-\ntors were added to the model, the difference in odds of\ndepression therapy use for Mexican American individu-\nals was reduced and rendered only marginally signifi-\ncantly lower compared with non-Latino white individu-\nals. Health insurance coverage doubled the odds of any\npast-year depression therapy use, whereas other en-\nabling factors were not significant.\nFor any guideline-concordant past-year depression\ntherapy among respondents meeting 12-month major de-\npression criteria, Mexican American and African Ameri-\ncan individuals had significantly lower odds.

By disaggregating ethnic/racial groups, we were able\nto specify which subgroups, namely African American\nand Mexican American, were the least likely to receive\ndepression care, especially guideline-concordant care.3\nThe ethnic/racial treatment differences found herein were\nin the context of indistinguishable depression need or se-\nverity between groups. Our findings underscore the im-\nportance of disaggregating ethnic/racial groups to un-\nderstand which ones are using what types of depression\ntreatment to unravel disparities in care. By disaggregat-\ning depression treatment types, we provided detailed pat-\nterns of major depression care use and guideline-\nconcordant use among major ethnic/racial groups in the\nUnited States that have been overlooked.22,23 Ulti-\nmately, this greater specificity may provide useful in-\nsights for better targeting mental health care to minor-\nity populations and improving depression care for all\nAmericans.\nIn this national study of depression care, psycho-\ntherapy was used at higher rates than pharmacotherapy.\nThe differences in therapy modality were most promi-\nnent among African American and Mexican American in-\ndividuals, the 2 groups who reported the lowest rates of\nany depression treatment use. More importantly per-\nhaps was our finding that psychotherapy users were more\nlikely to receive guideline-concordant therapy com-\npared with depression pharmacotherapy. The differ-\nences between guideline-concordant psychotherapy and\npharmacotherapy use were highest among Caribbean\nblack, African American, and Mexican American indi-\nviduals, respectively. One possible explanation for the\nhigher use and guideline-concordant use of psycho-\ntherapy than pharmacotherapy found in this study is that\npsychotherapy may have a comparably higher specific-\nity of use for major depression. Although our findings\nand hypothesis will require further inquiry for support,\nthe findings herein demonstrate the value of disaggre-\ngating treatment types to better characterize mental health\n\u00a92010 American Medical Association.

In ad-\ndition, although we did not directly assess treatment pref-\nerences, our findings regarding higher psychotherapy use\nare consistent with previous studies reporting higher ac-\nceptability for psychotherapy over pharmacotherapy, es-\npecially among ethnic/racial minorities facing dispari-\nOverall, Puerto Rican individuals had the highest preva-\nlence of 12-month major depression compared with the\nother ethnic/racial groups examined in this study, a find-\ning consistent with the higher overall rates of psychiatric\ndisordersanddualdiagnoses.27,28 Paradoxically,PuertoRican\nindividuals, along with Caribbean black individuals, had\nthe lowest depression severity ratings of the ethnic/racial\ngroups. Puerto Rican individuals had rates of depression\ntreatment use and concordant use that were similar to, and\nin some instances higher than, those of non-Latino white\nindividuals. The reasons for the relatively \"good\" depres-\nsion care among Puerto Rican individuals are encourag-\ning and perhaps attributable to their nonimmigrant status\nand greater English-language dominance in this popula-\ntion. However, the differences in access and quality of care\nare not always detectable because of the convention of\n\"lumping\" rather than \"sorting\" Latino subgroups in US\nhealth databases. Lumping makes it nearly impossible to\nidentify determinants of health care quality for ethnic/\nracial subgroups. What is clear from our study is that dis-\nparities in depression care among Latino individuals are\npredominantly found among Mexican American individu-\nals. The public mental health significance of our finding is\nthat Mexican American individuals represent more than\ntwo-thirds of Latino individuals in the United States.29 Our\nfindings indicate that efforts to reduce disparities in care\namong Latino individuals should especially focus on Mexi-\ncan American individuals. Furthermore, our findings show\nthat disparities in depression care for Mexican American\nindividuals were attenuated by factors that enable access\nto health care and may guide efforts for reducing dispari-\nties in health care.\nHealth insurance coverage was associated with higher\ndepression care but not guideline-concordant use among\nrespondents who met 12-month major depression cri-\nteria. This suggests that while health insurance cover-\nage may enable better access to depression care it does\nnot ensure \"better\" care. More education was associated\nwith higher guideline-concordant psychotherapy use but\nTable 4.

For Caribbean black and African\nAmerican individuals, however, neither health insur-\nance coverage nor any other factor examined in this study\nexplained their lower pharmacotherapy use, which is con-\nsistent with previous work.31,32 African American indi-\nviduals may find antidepressant agents less acceptable than\nother groups33,34; however, alternative explanations re-\nquire further exploration. One alternative health care de-\nlivery-side explanation is that the large differences in de-\npression care use by ethnic/racial groups in the United\nStates suggest unmet need that may stem from \"separate\nand unequal\" sources of health care.35,36\nRecent research indicates that perceived discrimina-\ntion in general and perceptions of bias within the health\ncare context can shape health care seeking and adher-\nence behaviors. For example, perceived discrimination has\nbeen associated with delays or failure to seek treatment\nforAfricanAmericanandLatinoindividuals.37-39 Otherstud-\nies have also related perceived discrimination by African\nAmerican and Latino individuals with the use of alterna-\ntive care instead of conventional care and with lower lev-\nels of satisfaction with care.40,41 These studies have not fo-\ncused on depression care, but this research suggests that\nfuture research should explore the extent to which pa-\ntients' subjective experiences of racial bias may affect their\naccess and use of mental health care.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first national study to\nexamine specific depression therapy types by disaggre-\ngated major ethnic/racial subgroups who met diagnos-\ntic criteria for major depression. By doing so, we re-\nvealed important patterns of therapy use by specific ethnic/\nracial groups that were masked in previous research.23,42\nSpecifically, we demonstrated that Latino disparities in\ndepression care occurred among Mexican American in-\ndividuals. Additionally, the level of depression care for\nPuerto Rican individuals is generally similar to non-\nLatino white individuals and in some instances is supe-\nrior. This study used sophisticated sampling proce-\ndures that make it among the largest and most inclusive\nstudies of depression care use among Americans, regard-\nTable 5.

Such inclusive-\nness, we believe, avoids potential sampling biases in ad-\nministrative medical record studies where only patients\nwith access to health care are examined. Avoiding this\nsampling bias is essential to evaluating ethnic/racial dis-\nparities in health care since national estimates of health\ninsurance coverage among ethnic/racial minorities are\nlower than among non-Latino white individuals.29\nAlthough our results are most likely the best estimates\nto date, our study should be interpreted in the context of\nseveral limitations. The CPES excluded homeless or in-\nstitutionalizedpersons,whichcouldunderestimatetheun-\nmet need for treatment of depressive disorders, particu-\nlarly among ethnic/racial minorities who are incarcerated\nat a higher rate than non-Latino white individuals nation-\nally.43 Second, as a diagnostic instrument, the WMH-\nCIDI has a modest sensitivity and high specificity for de-\ntecting \"true\" psychiatric disorders (eg, major depression)\namong CPES respondents.4,32 Thus, it is likely that some\ncases with \"true\" psychiatric disorders were missed, which\ncouldartificiallyinflatetheproportionofrespondentswith-\noutmentaldisordersusingdepressioncare.Third,ourdefi-\nnition of guideline concordance may have influenced our\nestimates. Although we examined only mental health pro-\nfessionals providing psychotherapy, we were unable to de-\ntermineifthespecifictypesofpsychotherapy(eg,cognitive-\nbehavioral) reported were \"evidence based\" as prescribed\nin the American Psychiatric Association guideline.3 Ad-\nditionally, our use of the American Psychiatric Associa-\ntion guideline did not consider brief and chronic depres-\nsive conditions, which may be missed by our definition\nof concordant use. Fourth, concerted efforts to \"harmo-\nnize\" the CPESs for use among the various ethnic/racial\ngroupsmayhaveintroducedunrecognizederrorsthatcould\nhave affected the results of this study. Given the magni-\ntude of inequalities in depression care that we observed,\nthe main inferences of our work should be stable.\nCONCLUSIONS\nMost Americans with recent major depression go un-\ntreated or undertreated. Our findings underscore the im-\nportance of disaggregating ethnic/racial groups. Failing\nto do so obscures depression care research, especially for\nthe largest and fastest-growing segment of the US popu-\nlation, Latino individuals, and especially Mexican Ameri-\ncan individuals.4,7 Consistent with previous studies that\nhave aggregated depression therapy, we found that ethnic/\nracial group was an important predictor of depression care\nin the United States.23,32 In contrast to previous work that\nhas aggregated Latino groups, we found striking ineq-\nuities in depression care and guideline-concordant use\nfor Mexican American individuals.4,7 Nationally, psycho-\ntherapy was used by higher proportions of Americans with\nrecent depression. Interestingly, lack of health insur-\nance coverage partially explained disparities in depres-\nsion care for Mexican American individuals, but not for\nAfrican American individuals, suggesting other factors\nmay be contributing to their differences.\nWith the recent passing of a US Mental Health Parity\nAct, our findings should provide guidance to better-\nenabled mental health to improve the depression care of\nall Americans and for reducing disparities among ethnic/\nracial minorities. Improving mental health care at com-\nmon points of service delivery (eg, primary care) and im-\nproving the availability of preferred depression therapies\nmay be needed. Collaborative care models that provide\ndepression therapy choices show promise for improv-\ning care, patient outcomes, and clinician satisfaction, while\ncontaining costs.44,45 Finally, new independent research\nmay be needed to explore adherence, efficacy, and cost\nefficacy of different depression therapies within and be-\ntween ethnic/racial groups.\nCorrespondence: Hector M.
