    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nNeuroinflammation during multiple sclerosis involves im-\nmune cell infiltration and disruption of the BBB (blood\u00ad\nbrain barrier). Both processes can be visualized by MRI (mag-\nnetic resonance imaging), in multiple sclerosis patients and\nin the animal model EAE (experimental autoimmune en-\ncephalomyelitis). We previously showed that VSOPs (very\nsmall superparamagnetic iron oxide particles) reveal CNS\n(central nervous system) lesions in EAE which are not de-\ntectable by conventional contrast agents in MRI. We hy-\npothesized that VSOP may help detect early, subtle inflam-\nmatory events that would otherwise remain imperceptible.\nTo investigate the capacity of VSOP to reveal early events\nin CNS inflammation, we induced EAE in SJL mice using\nencephalitogenic T-cells, and administered VSOP prior to\nonset of clinical symptoms. In parallel, we administered\nVSOP to mice at peak disease, and to unmanipulated con-\ntrols. We examined the distribution of VSOP in the CNS\nby MRI and histology. Prior to disease onset, in asymp-\ntomatic mice, VSOP accumulated in the choroid plexus and\nin spinal cord meninges in the absence of overt inflamma-\ntion.

To gain en-\ntry to the CNS, immune cells must cross the BBB (blood\u00ad\nbrain barrier), a complex multi-step process that involves\ninteraction with numerous cellular and non-cellular ele-\nments (Owens et al., 2008). Disruption of the BBB associ-\nated with active inflammation can be visualized in vivo by\ncontrast-enhanced MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). Gd-\nDTPA (gadopentetate dimeglumine)-enhancing lesions are\nalso detectible in the mouse model of multiple sclerosis,\nEAE (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis), in which\nit was histologically confirmed that the MRI lesions corre-\nsponded to focal inflammation and BBB breakdown (Smorod-\nchenko et al., 2007). Nevertheless, discrepancies remain be-\ntween the presence of Gd-enhancing lesions and the clinical\nseverity in both multiple sclerosis and EAE (Barkhof, 2002;\nOkuda et al., 2009). To overcome this so-called clinical\u00ad\nradiological paradox (Wuerfel et al., 2007) superparamag-\nnetic iron oxide nanoparticles with strong magnetic suscep-\ntibility effects were applied (Weinstein et al., 2010). Unlike\nGd-DTPA, iron oxide particles are efficiently taken up by\nphagocytic cells, and partition to the liver, spleen and lymph\nnodes. The capacity of iron oxide particles to be phagocytosed\nhas enabled the use of MRI to track macrophage dynamics\nin EAE studies (Oude Engberink et al., 2010; Rausch et al.,\nparticles) are electrostatically stabilized with a citrate coat-\ning, and present with a hydrodynamic diameter of only 7 nm,\nwhich is much smaller compared with other iron oxide par-\ndeveloped as a blood pool contrast agent (Schnorr et al.,\n2004), we previously showed VSOP to be efficiently phago-\ncytosed (Stroh et al., 2006) and to have the potential to de-\ntect lesions in EAE (Wuerfel et al., 2007). In addition to being\nphagocytosed, we previously showed that VSOP could effi-\nciently extravasate and highlight both acute BBB disruption\nand persistent lesions, being detectable by MRI in the brain\nup to 20 days post application (Tysiak et al., 2009; Wuerfel\net al., 2007). Thus VSOP may be regarded as having prop-\nerties intermediate between Gd-based contrast agents and\nother larger-sized iron oxide nanoparticles.\nIn a previous study, we compared lesions characterized\nby VSOP with those enhancing Gd-DTPA in EAE, and showed\nthat each Gd-DTPA-enhancing lesion correlated with T2*-\nsignal loss after VSOP injection; however, numerous in-\nstances of lesions were detected only with VSOP and not with\nGd-DTPA (Tysiak et al., 2009). We hypothesized that these\nlesions detected only with VSOP may represent inflamma-\ntory lesions at a relatively early stage, in which the im-\nmune cells are confined to the perivascular space. To fur-\nther investigate our hypothesis, we here administered VSOP\nto EAE mice both prior to clinical disease onset, when only\nvery early inflammatory events may occur, and at peak\ndisease. We undertook a detailed histological examination\nof the spinal cord and the brain parenchyma to inves-\ntigate the tissue distribution of VSOP at early and peak\nneuroinflammation.\nInduction of EAE\nAll procedures were performed in accordance with protocols\napproved by the local animal welfare committee (LAGeSo)\nin accordance with national and international guidelines to\nminimize discomfort to animals (86/609/EEC). Female SJL/J\nmice were purchased from Janvier and were housed under\nstandard conditions. For induction of passive EAE, donor mice\nwere immunized subcutaneously with 200 g of PLP (prote-\npurity >95% (Pepceuticals Ltd)\ntogether with Complete Freund's adjuvant and heat-killed\nMycobacterium tuberculosis (H37Ra, Difco). Ten days after\nimmunization, mice were killed by cervical dislocation and\nthe draining lymph nodes were collected. Lymph node cells\nwere isolated by macerating the tissue through a 100 m\nmesh. The cells were incubated at 37C for 4 days in the\n[supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 units/ml peni-\ncillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin and 10% FBS (fetal bovine\nserum)]. Then 5\u00d7106 lymphocyte blasts were injected intra-\nvenously into a total of 34 syngenic recipient mice. Mice\nwere assigned a clinical score daily: 0, no disease; 1, tail\nweakness; 2, paraparesis; 3, paraplegia; 4, paraplegia with\nforelimb weakness; 5, moribund or dead animals.\nMRI procedures\nMRI was done using a 7 Tesla Bruker Pharmascan 70/16 ro-\ndent MR scanner (Bruker Biospin), applying a 20 mm RF-\nQuadrature-Volume head coil.

Subsequently, these mice received 0.2 mmol/kg Gd-\nDTPA (Magnevist, Bayer-Schering AG) intravenously and\nwere immediately scanned again for contrast-enhanced T1-\nweighted imaging.

In a previous study, we admin-\nistered VSOP to mice with established Gd-DTPA-enhancing\nlesions, and demonstrated that VSOP revealed lesions that\nwere not detectable by Gd-DTPA (Tysiak et al., 2009). In\nthe present study, we examined the CNS of mice between\n4 and 6 days after adoptive transfer of encephalitogenic T-\n-immunized donor mice \u00ad a time point\nthat precedes the development of clinical disability.

M. Millward and others\nFigure 2 VSOP detected in CNS prior to EAE clinical onset (4\u00ad6 days post transfer)\nVSOP (blue staining) was observed in the stroma of the choroid plexus of the lateral (A) and fourth (B) ventricles (arrows), in the absence\nof inflammatory cells. VSOP was also seen in choroid plexus in the presence of mild inflammation (circle) (C). VSOP was detected in spinal\ncord meninges (D) and vessels (E) in the absence of inflammation, and in the presence of inflammatory cells (F). Original magnification:\nwithin the choroid plexus stroma (i.e. basal to the choroid\nepithelium), of the lateral ventricle (Figure 2A) and the\nfourth ventricle (Figure 2B) are shown. In these animals,\nthe architecture of the choroid plexus appeared intact.\nThe three other mice showed signs of inflammation in the\nchoroid plexus, defined as a pathological accumulation of\nimmune cell infiltrates shown by H&E staining (indicated by\nthe circle) and also partially disrupted tissue architecture as\nshown in Figure 2(C). No mice showed inflammation in any\nother brain regions at this pre-onset time point.\nIn the spinal cord (Figure 1B), VSOP was detected in seven\nout of 15 mice (46%), located in white matter and meninges.\nMild inflammatory pathology could be seen in white mat-\nter and meninges in five out of 15 mice, predominantly in\nthe lumbar and sacral regions, conforming to a pattern of\nascending pathology (Figure 1B). Figure 2(D) shows a repre-\nsentative example of VSOP in the spinal cord meninges. As\nin the choroid plexus, VSOP was seen without a pathological\naccumulation of infiltrated immune cells in this area. Fig-\nure 2(E) shows an example of VSOP in a non-inflamed vessel\nin the spinal cord white matter. Figure 2(F) shows VSOP in\nthe presence of a mild inflammatory lesion in the meninges.\nAs a control, we administered the same dose of VSOP to\n10 unmanipulated SJL mice, and processed the tissues for\nhistology in an identical manner. No VSOP was detectable in\nthe spinal cord meninges, the choroid plexus or any other\nCNS structures in these mice, suggesting that the detection\nof VSOP in the pre-onset mice was related to early \u00ad oth-\nerwise not detectable \u00ad inflammatory processes. In healthy\ncontrol mice, VSOP injected intravenously accumulate in the\nliver and are cleared primarily by its phagocytosing systems\n(Wagner et al., 2002). For all mice, liver tissue served as a\npositive control for detection of VSOP (not shown). Thus, in\nimmunized animals and prior the appearance of clinical signs\nof EAE, VSOP accumulates in spinal cord as well as the choroid\nplexus and intraventricular foramen, also in the absence of\napparent inflammation.\nVSOP-mediated visualization of brain\ninflammation at disease peak using MRI and\nhistology\nTo better understand the involvement of choroid plexus and\nspinal cord meninges in EAE development, we then examined\nthe distribution of VSOP at peak EAE, particularly in the\nchoroid plexus and in the inflamed spinal cord. EAE was\ninduced in SJL wild-type recipient mice by adoptive transfer\n-immunized donor\nmice. The typical EAE disease course expected with this model\nwas observed, as shown in Figure 3(A). Disease onset occurred\nbetween 8 and 12 days after adoptive transfer of T-cells,\nand peaked at days 14\u00ad16 post transfer. The distribution of\nVSOP and inflammatory lesions (defined as a pathological\naccumulation of immune cell infiltrates as shown by H&E\nstaining) is shown in Figures 3(B) and 3(C) for brain and\nspinal cord, respectively. Inflammatory lesions were observed\nin the thalamus and hippocampus, and less frequently in the\ncortex. Lesions were especially prominent in the cerebellum\nwhite matter tracts, and also present in cerebellar grey matter\nand in the brainstem. VSOP could be detected in lesions in\nall of these regions. Of particular note was the prevalence of\nVSOP observed in the choroid plexus, both in the ventricles\nand extending into the interventricular foramen (Figure 3B).\n92 C 2013 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits unrestricted use, distribution\nand reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nInvolvement of choroid plexus in CNS inflammation\nFigure 3 Histological detection of inflammation and VSOP at peak\ndisease\n(A) Plot of EAE clinical score in SJL mice after adoptive transfer of PLP139-151\nre-\nactive T-cells.

(C) Distri-\nbution of inflammatory lesions and VSOP in transverse spinal cord segments.\nWe observed VSOP in both mild and severe lesions. However,\nwe also saw both mild and severe lesions where VSOP was\nabsent. Thus, the presence of VSOP does not appear to be\ncorrelated with the magnitude of the individual lesions.\nThe correspondence between VSOP enhancement on MRI\nand histological detection was verified in 16 animals; these\nmice first underwent T1- and T2*-weighted scans prior to the\napplication of contrast agents. After this, the mice were ad-\nministered intravenous Gd-DTPA, and scanned immediately\nagain by T1-weighted MRI. Subsequently, the mice were ad-\nministered intravenous VSOP, then scanned for T2*-weighted\nMRI 24 h later. The 24 h time point was based on our pre-\nvious studies which showed that by 24 h post-VSOP injec-\ntion, the blood\u00adpool contrast had entirely subsided, leaving\nthe pathological VSOP-enhancing lesions clearly discernible\nexample of a mouse with severe disease (bilateral hind limb\nparalysis) is shown in Figure 4(A) prior to the application of\nVSOP. Hypointense lesions are visible in the cerebellum and\nbrainstem in the post-VSOP T2*-weighted image shown in\nFigure 4(B), which are not discernable in the pre-contrast\nscan in Figure 4(A). These lesions coincided with Gd-DTPA-\nenhancing hyperintense lesions (Figure 4C). After the post-\nVSOP MRI scanning, the mice were killed and processed for\nhistology. The inset in Figure 4(B) shows the histological de-\ntection of VSOP in an inflammatory lesion in the cerebellar\nwhite matter, corresponding to a lesion shown in the same\nmouse by the MRI scans. Figure 4(D) shows a representa-\ntive example of a healthy control mouse pre-contrast. No\nhypointense or hyperintense lesions were seen in this con-\ntrol mouse after application of VSOP (Figure 4E) or Gd-DTPA\n(Figure 4F).\nFigure 5(A) shows a representative staining of VSOP in\ninflamed choroid plexus, extending from the lateral ventricle\ninto the interventricular foramen. Note that the morphology\nof the tissue structure is highly disrupted by the infiltrating\nimmune cells. VSOP could also be detected by MRI in choroid\nplexus as hypointensities within the ventricles, as shown in\nFigures 5(B) and 5(C) (coronal and axial views, respectively).\nAt peak of disease, numerous lesions were observed at vari-\nous stages of development. Figure 5(E) shows a representative\nexample of relatively mild lesions in the brain parenchyma\n(thalamus). VSOP was observed in some of these lesions (ar-\nrow in Figure 5E), although VSOP-negative lesions were also\ndetected. An example of a more severe lesion with prominent\nVSOP is shown in Figure 5(F). In this example, erythrocytes\ncan be seen in the tissue (brown colour). The observation of\nboth VSOP and erythrocytes in the lesion, but with differ-\nent colours, underscores the specificity of the Prussian Blue\nstaining method for the iron of the VSOP.\nDetection of VSOP in lesions in inflamed spinal\ncord\nIn the present study, we addressed the distribution of VSOP in\nspinal cord of mice at peak EAE by histology. As depicted\nin Figure 3(C), inflammatory pathology and VSOP could be\nobserved throughout the spinal cord. The VSOP was especially\nprominent in the meninges, the anterior median fissure and\nthe posterior median sulcus, and in white matter lesions.\nGrey matter lesions were only occasionally observed, and no\nVSOP was detected in the central canal. At peak disease,\ndetection of VSOP in spinal cord always corresponded with\ninflammatory pathology but not vice versa, i.e. inflammatory\nlesions could also be seen without accompanying VSOP.\nC 2013 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits unrestricted use, distribution\nand reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nJ. M. Millward and others\nFigure 4 VSOP location in brain correlates with T2*-enhancing lesions\nRepresentative T2*-weighted images prior to contrast agent administration are shown for EAE (A) and healthy control (D) brains.\nHypointense lesions (circles) are seen in the T2*-weighted image 24 h post-VSOP administration in the EAE brain (B) but not in the\ncontrol (E). Diffuse hyperintense Gd-DTPA-enhancing lesions are seen in representative T1-weighted images in the EAE brain (C) but\nnot in the healthy control (F). MRI-detected VSOP-enhancing lesions were verified by histology, showing the presence of VSOP (blue) in\ninflamed lesions (inset in B). Scale bar = 1 mm.\nTo further dissect the VSOP distribution in sick animals,\nwe used immunohistochemistry combined with Prussian Blue\nstaining to detect VSOP in situ in relation to other cellular\nand non-cellular elements in inflammatory lesions. In Fig-\nure 6(A), we show an exemplary inflammatory lesion in which\nthe infiltrating immune cells are restricted to the perivascular\nspace. Immunostaining with GFAP clearly shows the astro-\ncyte end processes delineating the glia limitans surrounding\nthe lesion. In this example, the infiltrating cells and the VSOP\nare confined to the perivascular space, and have not entered\nthe parenchyma of the CNS proper. Similarly, in Figure 6(B),\nimmunostaining with a pan-laminin antibody delineates the\nvascular endothelial and the parenchymal basement mem-\nbranes; in this lesion, the infiltrating cells and the VSOP are\nalso confined to the perivascular space.\nTo investigate the association of VSOP with phagocytes we\ndid immunostaining for iba-1. In Figure 6(C), iba-1 immunos-\ntaining shows microglia with the typical ramified morphology\nin the spinal cord parenchyma, and iba-1-positive cells co-\nlocalized with VSOP in the inflammatory lesion. In addition\nto perivascular lesions, disseminated lesions with VSOP and\nimmune cell infiltration into the parenchyma were seen in\nboth spinal cord and brain at peak disease.\nAssociation of VSOP with endothelium in\ninflammatory lesions\nApart from the detection of VSOP in perivascular lesions, in\nthe present study, we observed for the first time VSOP\nin spinal cord inflammatory lesions as discrete puncta present\nin elongated structures, which appear to be vascular en-\ndothelium (solid arrow in Figure 7A). Endothelial VSOP could\nbe seen in close proximity to VSOP co-localized with iba-1-\npositive cells in the same lesion (open arrow in Figure 7A).\nVSOP was also detected in lesions as a diffuse accumulation\nthat did not appear to be cell-associated (arrowhead in Fig-\nure 7A). Diffuse, non-cell-associated VSOP was also seen in\nthe brain, as shown in the inflamed choroid plexus in the\ninterventricular foramen in Figure 7(B). The higher magnifi-\ncation views in Figures 7(C) and 7(D) show discrete punctate\nVSOP located within elongated structures which appear to be\nthe vascular endothelium of the choroid plexus. Additional\ndiffuse VSOP was seen in the choroid plexus (Figure 7C, ar-\nrowhead), although it is not possible to determine whether\nthis non-cell-associated VSOP is located within the stroma,\ngiven the substantial disruption of the tissue architecture\nresulting from the accumulation of immune cells.\nDISCUSSION\nIn the present study, we demonstrated that VSOP accumu-\nlated in the choroid plexus and spinal cord meninges of\nasymptomatic mice after adoptive transfer of encephali-\ntogenic T-cells, prior to the onset of clinical signs and in\nthe absence of overt inflammation. VSOP appears to reveal\nearly EAE-related inflammatory alterations at the choroid\nplexus explicitly. Since VSOP was completely absent from the\nchoroid plexus of non-immunized healthy animals without\nT-cell transfer, our data point to choroid plexus involvement\nnot only in physiological immune surveillance and during\nestablished CNS inflammation (Engelhardt and Ransohoff,\n94 C 2013 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits unrestricted use, distribution\nand reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nInvolvement of choroid plexus in CNS inflammation\nFigure 5 VSOP observed in both severe and mild inflammatory lesions\nAt peak disease VSOP was detected by histology in inflamed choroid plexus\nextending from the lateral ventricle into the interventricular foramen (A), and\ncould also be seen as hypointensities on coronal (B) and axial (C) T2*-weighted\nimages.

In con-\ntrast, the morphology of the choroid plexus at peak disease\nwas highly disrupted (Figures 4D and 7B\u00ad7D). It is not yet\nclear which structures in the choroid plexus of the asymp-\ntomatic mice are associated with VSOP. The choroid plexus\nendothelium is fenestrated, which in principle could per-\nmit the diffusion of free VSOP from the circulation into the\nstroma. However, no VSOP was detected in the choroid plexus\n(or indeed anywhere else in the CNS) of unmanipulated SJL\nmice in which the same dose of VSOP was administered be-\nfore processing for histology. Thus, VSOP accumulation in the\nchoroid plexus stroma cannot be explained by mere diffusion\nmechanisms. On the other hand, VSOP could be contained\nwithin phagocytes that had entered from the periphery at\nFigure 6 VSOP observed in perivascular-restricted spinal cord lesions\nwith intact BBB\n(A) GFAP immunostaining (brown) shows astrocyte end foot processes sur-\nrounding a lesion with immune infiltrates (stained with Nuclear Fast Red) and\nincluding VSOP (blue).

Thus, mecha-\nnisms other than physiological diffusion processes or early\nmigration of inflammatory phagocytes from the periphery\nmay explain VSOP accumulation in choroid plexus (Wol-\nburg and Paulus, 2010). It may be that as a consequence\nof the systemic inflammation induced by adoptive trans-\nfer, early circulating inflammatory factors (Mitchell et al.,\n2009) may alter resident myeloid cells in the choroid plexus\nstroma (Nataf et al., 2006), leading to the observed accumu-\nlation of VSOP in asymptomatic mice.

M. Millward and others\nFigure 7 VSOP present in multiple forms in CNS lesions at peak disease\nVSOP could be seen as discrete puncta that appear to be present in elongated\nendothelial structures (solid arrow in A). VSOP was also seen in the same lesion\nco-localized with an iba-1-positive cell (open arrow in A), and as a diffuse\naccumulation (arrowhead in A).

VSOP as discrete puncta structures\n(solid arrows in C and D), and as a diffuse accumulation (arrowhead in C).\nadditional immunohistochemical markers should address\nthese possibilities in detail.\nSimilar to the choroid plexus, VSOP was also observed in\nthe spinal cord meninges in pre-onset mice in the absence\nof overt inflammation but not in naive mice given VSOP,\nsuggesting that this observation reflected early events in the\ndisease process. It is proposed that immune cells gain entry\nto the CNS via the choroid plexus, circulate through the CSF\n(cerebrospinal fluid) compartment, including the subarach-\nnoid space, as part of the process of immune surveillance\nof the CNS, and can encounter antigen and be re-activated\nin the meninges during the earliest stages of neuroinflam-\nIndeed, it was reported that CD4 + Th1 and Th17 cells accu-\nmulate and become re-activated in the subarachnoid space\nprior to entry into spinal cord parenchyma, and prior to clin-\nical onset of EAE (Kivisakk et al., 2009). The accumulation\nof VSOP in the choroid plexus and spinal cord meninges at\nthe first stages in the disease process confirms that these\nstructures are altered very early during neuroinflammation.\nWhile in asymptomatic animals VSOP highlighted the in-\nvolvement of choroid plexus and meninges in early inflam-\nmatory events, VSOP in animals at peak disease showed a\nbroad and heterogeneous distribution. At peak disease, VSOP\nwas seen in the choroid plexus in 15 out of 19 animals (79%)\nand could be clearly visualized by MRI, in contrast with the\nchoroid plexus VSOP in asymptomatic animals which was not\ndetectable by MRI. Most likely this is a question of sensitiv-\nity, and work is in progress to determine the limit of detec-\ntion of VSOP by MRI in vivo. One possibility to address this\nwould be to use MRI scanners with greater B0 field strength.\nWe recently reported detection of EAE lesions using a 9.4 T\nMRI scanner with a cryogenically cooled coil (Waiczies et al.,\n2012), and it would be interesting to apply this higher B0\nfield strength to studies with VSOP, to attempt to approach\nthe sensitivity of histological detection of VSOP in vivo. As\npresented in Figures 5(A) and 7(B)\u00ad(D), the inflamed choroid\nplexus has a highly disrupted morphology, consistent with\nprevious reports in severe EAE (Engelhardt et al., 2001; Mu-\nAt peak disease, we also show histological evidence for the\naccumulation of VSOP in perivascular inflammatory lesions\nwith intact glia limitans. This type of perivascular accumu-\nlation of immune cells may represent a relatively early and\npotentially reversible stage in the development of a CNS le-\nsion, prior to entry of the infiltrating cells into the brain\nparenchyma, where they may cause tissue damage. In prin-\nciple, early detection of such lesions may be instrumental in\nthe development of novel therapeutic strategies that target\nthese distinct mechanisms and may offer the opportunity for\nearlier clinical intervention (Wuerfel et al., 2008).\nMoreover, in diseased mice, we observed within the same\nperivascular lesion VSOP as discrete focal accumulations that\nappear to be co-localized with iba-1-positive cells, as well\nas diffuse VSOP accumulations which did not appear to be\ncell-associated. It has been well established that iron oxide\nparticles are efficiently taken up by phagocytic cells (Rausch\nlarge iron oxide particles (Weinstein et al., 2010), smaller\nVSOP appear also to be readily taken up by phagocytic cells\ndespite their small diameter (7 nm) (Wuerfel et al., 2007).\nUptake of VSOP by monocytes and macrophages has been\nconfirmed using electron microscopy (Ludwig et al., 2013).\nThus, VSOP has the potential to enter CNS tissue both as-\nsociated with phagocytes and in a non-cell-associated form,\nwhich in principle could highlight distinct aspects of the\npathological process. Furthermore, we observed for the first\ntime VSOP as discrete puncta that seem to be present in en-\ndothelial cells. This apparent endothelial incorporation was\nseen both in lesions in the brain and spinal cord parenchyma,\n96 C 2013 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits unrestricted use, distribution\nand reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nInvolvement of choroid plexus in CNS inflammation\nas well as in the choroid plexus, at peak disease. Activation\nof vascular endothelium in response to inflammatory stim-\nuli is associated with up-regulation of numerous adhesion\nmolecules, as well as extracellular matrix elements such as\nhyaluronic acid (Nandi et al., 2000), which may facilitate\nelectrostatic interactions with VSOP. Indeed, it was recently\ndemonstrated that VSOP can bind strongly to cell membranes\nvia interactions with negatively-charged GAGs (glycosamino-\nglycans) (Ludwig et al., 2013). Alteration of GAG expression\nduring inflammation, both in the vascular endothelium and\nin the choroid plexus, may underlie interactions of VSOP in\nthese structure, though the specific molecular mechanisms of\nsuch putative interactions remain to be investigated in future\nstudies, including the use of in vitro BBB and BCSFB (blood\u00ad\nCSF barrier) model systems. Additionally, work is in progress\nto employ a SQUID (superconducting quantum interference\ndevice) to precisely measure iron content by magnetorelax-\nometry in tissues ex vivo, after application of VSOP (Eberbeck\nable a quantitative determination of the distribution of VSOP\nto various tissue compartments, which can be compared be-\ntween healthy controls and EAE mice at different time points\nduring disease.\nOne caveat of the present study is the lack of an estab-\nlished fluorescent method for histological detection of iron,\nwhich precludes the use of confocal microscopy to defini-\ntively establish cellular co-localization and internalization of\nVSOP. Work is in progress to circumvent this limitation by\nthe development of next generation VSOP that incorporate\neuropium atoms directly into the iron oxide core. This renders\nthe particles detectable by both MRI and fluorescence (Gro-\nman et al., 2007), and will permit future studies to make more\nconclusive statements regarding cellular and extracellular lo-\ncalization in vivo. In particular, immunostaining with specific\nmarkers for endothelial cells and phagocytic cells combined\nwith fluorescent VSOP will facilitate corroboration of our ini-\ntial findings for VSOP in the endothelium and choroid plexus,\nrespectively.\nIn summary, in the present study, using VSOP, we demon-\nstrated that apart from its involvement in immune surveil-\nlance, the choroid plexus is involved in early inflammatory\nprocesses in autoimmune inflammation. It seems to undergo\nalterations occurring very early in the process of inflamma-\ntion that enables the specific binding of VSOP to stromal\nstructures of the choroid plexus. On the other hand, in es-\ntablished EAE, we show accumulation of VSOP both in CNS\nperivascular lesions and associated with endothelial cells, two\nprocesses which may represent an early stage in the patho-\nlogical cascade in EAE. Thus, VSOP may emerge as a use-\nful complement to conventional MRI approaches to monitor\nearly cellular changes in the context of inflammation. VSOP\nhas already been applied in human clinical studies in the con-\ntext of MR angiography (Taupitz et al., 2004; Wagner et al.,\n2011). It is therefore essential that we expand our under-\nstanding of how these particles interact with cellular and\nnon-cellular elements in vivo. Importantly, the use of VSOP\nwill help improve our understanding of the pathomechanisms\nin multiple sclerosis and other inflammatory disorders of the\n"
