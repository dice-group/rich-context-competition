    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis research assessed whether greater attachment to an Aboriginal community buffers against the negative effects\nof stigma and promotes positive health outcomes. Aboriginal Australians (n\n=\n203) living with hepatitis C completed a\nsurvey assessing community attachment, stigma, resilience, quality of life, treatment intent, hepatitis C knowledge and\npositive lifestyle changes. A stronger sense of community attachment was associated with greater resilience, increased\nquality of life, less hepatitis C\u00adrelated stigma and with increased lifestyle changes after diagnosis. Hence, community\nattachment can buffer against the negative health effects of stigma and may promote the resources to engage in positive\nbehaviour changes, ultimately increasing long-term health outcomes.\n",

In Australia, a\ncountry of approximately 22\nmillion, it is now estimated\nInstitute, 2013). The primary route of transmission of HCV\nin the developed world is through sharing of equipment\nused to inject drugs (Razali et al., 2007). The Australian\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (hereafter Aboriginal\nAustralians) population, which comprises 3\nper cent of\nAustralia's population, is overrepresented in both the prev-\nalence of HCV and incidence of newly reported HCV\nthat around 16,000 Aboriginal Australians were chronically\ninfected with HCV, representing around 8.3per cent of the\ntotal Australian population living with chronic HCV at the\ntime. More recent research has indicated that the preva-\nlence of HCV among Aboriginal Australians may be much\nhigher than previously estimated. As of 2011, the rate of\nnewly diagnosed HCV in the Aboriginal population was\nnon-Aboriginal population (Kirby Institute, 2012).\nAs a group,AboriginalAustralians face a number of disad-\nvantages on a range of health and socio-economic outcomes\nwhich may place them at risk of acquiring HCV. On a global\nscale,Aboriginal people have poorer health than non-Aborig-\ninal people, which is associated with poverty, malnutrition,\nand infection and is exacerbated by inadequate healthcare and\nhealth promotion (Gracey and King, 2009). Often disadvan-\ntages faced by Aboriginal Australians are a result of unequal\naccess to the same opportunities as non-Aboriginal\nAustralians, such as access to education, employment, and\nhealthcare. Additionally, many of these disadvantages are\ncompounded for Aboriginal Australians living in rural and\nremote areas of the country (Hunter, 2007).

A further issue to consider is the\ncumulative toll and intergenerational effects of trauma related\nto the colonisation of Australia by White settlers. Research in\nCanada has found a direct link between incidence of HCV\ninfection and having at least one parent attend a residential\nschool (Craib et al., 2009). For Australian Aboriginal com-\nmunities, the forced removal of children from families (The\nStolen Generation), the dispossession of lands and repression\nof cultural practices, protocol and language, and other racist\ngovernmental policies can be read in parallel to the Canadian\nexperience and as contributing to ongoing, trans-generational\nThe numerous hardships which Aboriginal people have\nand continue to experience has also led to an overrepresen-\ntation of Indigenous people within priority populations\nidentified by the Australian national HCV strategy\n(Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing,\n2010), people who inject drugs (PWID) and people in custo-\ndial settings. Although the prevalence of injecting drug use\nspecifically amongAboriginalAustralians is not well known\n(AustralianInstituteofHealthandWelfare,2006;Kratzmann\net al., 2011), available research suggests that it is high (Day\nwho participated in the Australian Needle and Syringe\nProgram Survey, which annually recruits over 2000 partici-\nThe Pharmacy Needle and Syringe Survey conducted in\nNew South Wales reported an even higher proportion of\nper cent of the sample\nidentifying as Aboriginal in the surveys conducted between\nper\ncent of the participants recruited nationally in the 2012\nIllicit Drugs Reporting System who reported injecting drugs\nidentified as Aboriginal (Stafford and Burns, 2013).\nResearch has shown that Aboriginal status is associated\nwith an earlier onset of injecting drug use and increased like-\nlihood of sharing injecting equipment, placing Aboriginal\nAustralians at a greater risk of acquiring blood borne virus\net al., 2011). It may be that the increased likelihood of shar-\ning unsterile injecting equipment among Aboriginal groups\ncould be linked to cultural practices, such as shared use of\npossessions with kin (Correll et al., 2000; Larson et al.,\n1999). As reciprocity may be an important cultural value,\nAboriginal people may consequently feel obliged to share\nequipment with close relations (Van der Sterren and\nAnderson, 2002). Research also indicates that Aboriginal\nAustralians may be less knowledgeable about blood-borne\nvirus transmission than the general community, due to lim-\nited access to health education especially forAboriginal peo-\nple residing in rural and remote areas (Paquette et al., 2012).\nWhile there is a treatment for HCV, uptake remains\nreceive treatment annually in Australia (Grebely et al.,\n2009). These numbers are small because of the numerous\ndeterrents to HCV treatment, which include side effects, the\nrigorous nature of treatment, and the impact of treatment on\nWilson et al., 2010). Additionally, people with HCV may\nface competing health and social concerns that impede their\naccess to care and treatment, including poverty (Edlin et al.,\ncomorbidity such as mental health problems (Weiss et al.,\n2012). Given the social and economic disadvantages expe-\nrienced by Aboriginal Australians, these barriers could be\nexacerbated (Hunter, 2007). Additionally, individuals may\nnot be psychologically ready to engage with the relatively\narduous nature of HCV treatment; hence, adopting positive\nlifestyle changes such as reducing alcohol consumption,\nreducing illicit drug use, increasing medical visits and\nincreasing exercise have been found to be important for the\nmanagement of chronic HCV (Hickman et al., 2002;\nSladden et al., 1998). In a recent study of people living with\nHCV who attended a community HCV clinic in New\nrespondents made lifestyle changes to better manage their\nillness and therefore were more capable of coping with the\nlong-term consequences of their infection. Preventing pro-\ngression of HCV is particularly important in the Aboriginal\ncommunity, where the life expectancy is lower than the\ngeneral national average and where lack of preventative\ncare and excessive alcohol consumption are common, fur-\nther exacerbating liver damage (Battersby et al., 2008; Pink\nAs with many minority groups of Indigenous status,\nbeing of Aboriginal descent may carry a particular stigma\nin Australia. Goffman (1963) defines stigma as a trait or\ncharacteristic that is deeply disreputable to an individual or\na group of people. Stigmatised people are labelled as differ-\nent and structures are put in place to protect the majority\nfrom the discrediting attribute (Crocker et al., 1998). Parker\nand Aggleton (2003) further explain stigma as a means to\nreinforce social power. This is accomplished by marking\nand establishing social inequalities through the use of\nboundaries or `norms', such as ethnicity, gender, sexuality\nand socio-economic status (Scrambler, 2006; Simbayi\net al., 2007). Feelings of stigmatisation are likely to be\ncompounded for Aboriginal people who have a history of\ninjecting drug use and are living with HCV because they\nmay experience multiple or layered stigma (Henkel et al.,\nStigma becomes discrimination when thoughts, beliefs\nor attitudes evolve into direct action against the stigmatised\ngroup (Giddens, 2009). A large body of research has shown\nBrener et al. 3\nthat stigma has a negative effect on the health and well-\nbeing of those who are stigmatised. Feelings of stigmatisa-\ntion have been linked to poor mental health, poverty, low\nsocial status, physical illness, low self-esteem and aca-\ndemic underachievement (Allison, 1998; Clarke et al.,\nMajor and O'Brien, 2005). Furthermore, experiencing\nstigma or discrimination has been shown to adversely affect\nthe health-seeking behaviours of people living with a stig-\nmatised condition such as HCV (Ahern et al., 2007; Butt,\nmatised individuals have also been found to function as\nwell as people who are not stigmatised, despite experienc-\ning stigma and discrimination (Miller and Kaiser, 2001).\nThus, the consequences of belonging to a stigmatised group\nare not always negative. Miller and Kaiser (2001) suggest\nthat stress associated with stigma will only be detrimental if\nthe individual does not have the resources to cope with that\nstress. One factor that can buffer or protect individuals\nfrom the negative effects of stigma is a strong sense of\nminority group belonging or community attachment\nnoted above which focuses on African American racial\nidentity and community attachment, little empirical\nresearch has assessed the impact of attachment to a minor-\nity group for other stigmatised groups. This study helps\naddress this gap by establishing the role of Aboriginal com-\nmunity attachment in determining health outcomes associ-\nated with HCV for Aboriginal people who are HCV\npositive. We hypothesise that greater attachment to partici-\npants' Aboriginal community will serve a protective func-\ntion for people who are living with HCV. Specifically, those\nwith stronger attachment to their Aboriginal community\nwill show greater psychological resilience, will be less\naffected by stigma and discrimination based on their\nAboriginal or HCV status and will report a better quality of\nlife. We further predict that individuals with stronger com-\nmunity attachment will be better able to cope with their ill-\nness, enabling them to make important positive lifestyle\nchanges to better manage their health.\nMethods\nSample and recruitment\nThe main recruitment strategy was the distribution of\nrecruitment postcards in a range of health service across\nNew South Wales known to either specifically target\nAboriginal people (e.g. Aboriginal Community Controlled\nHealth Services) or mainstream services that attract a large\nnumber of Aboriginal clients (e.g. needle and syringe pro-\ngrammes or liver clinics in areas where there many\nAboriginal people live), at community health events and\nthrough community contacts. Recruitment postcards were\ndesigned to look similar to advertising postcards often found\nin cafes, libraries and movie theatres. The cards did not\nmention injecting drug use or HCV, but rather asked if peo-\nple had problems with their liver. A toll free number was\nincluded to allow individuals to contact the Aboriginal\nLiaison Officer, free of charge, to receive further informa-\ntion about the study and, if eligible, book a suitable time to\ncomplete the telephone survey. Services displayed postcards\nin the waiting room where there were other health promo-\ntional pamphlets and booklets. Other recruitment strategies\nincluded placing a one-page advertisement in a community\npublication for injecting drug users and one-page poster in a\nnewsletter for drug and alcohol workers. To participate in\nthe research, individuals had to be over 18years old, identify\nas Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander and report currently\nliving with HCV, undertaking treatment or recently clearing\nthe virus naturally or through treatment.\nProcedure\nPotential participants called the toll-free number and spoke\nwith the Aboriginal Liaison Officer. The Aboriginal Liaison\nOfficer informed participants about the study aims, assessed\ntheir eligibility and assured them of the confidentiality of the\nsurvey. Informed consent was obtained from participants by\nthem verbally agreeing to complete the survey. The survey\nwas conducted telephonically and participants were offered\nthe opportunity to be surveyed by either an Aboriginal or\nnon-Aboriginal researcher. Participants' responses were\nentered into a computer software programme. The survey\nminutes to complete. The research\nteam also visited some mainstream and Aboriginal services\nto complete surveys with clients in person. These surveys\nwere administered in hard copy by an interviewer to ensure\nuniformity in survey administration. Hard copies of the\nsurvey were then entered into the computer manually.\nSurvey participants were reimbursed AUD30. The study\nwas approved by the Human Research Ethics Committees of\nthe Aboriginal Health and Medical Research Council,\nUNSW Australia and relevant health authorities.\nMeasures\nThe broader survey examined participants' quality of care in\nrelation to HCV, engagement with HCV-related services,\nmanagement of HCV and choices around HCV treatment.\nThe survey also investigated knowledge of HCV, contact with\nHCV health promotion, quality of life, resilience and experi-\nences of stigma and discrimination. A number of pre-existing\nmeasures were used to examine these focal areas, some of\nwhich have previously been used in research with Aboriginal\npeople. Pre-testing was undertaken to identify problems with\nquestion content, misinterpretation of individual terms or\nconcepts and problems with the survey design. Items used\nspecifically for this analysis are outlined below.\n4 Health Psychology Open \nAboriginal community attachment.A measure of attachment\nto an Aboriginal community was developed based on three\nitems assessing how much the respondent felt they belonged\nto their Aboriginal community, how much they felt they\nhad in common with their Aboriginal community and how\nmuch they interacted with their Aboriginal community.\nThese items were similar to those used in Brener et al.\n(2013) assessing the group-based attachment of people liv-\ning with HIV. Responses were scored on 4-point scale from\n`not much' to `a lot', with higher scores indicative of a\ngreater sense of Aboriginal community attachment. The\nitems were summed to create an Aboriginal community\nattachment scale (=.86).\nStigma measures.A modified version of the Group-Based\nMedical Mistrust Scale (Thompson et al., 2004) was used\nto investigate racially based stigma and discrimination in\nhealthcare. This scale consisted of 12 items and the face\nvalidity of the items was assessed by the research team\nwhich included three Aboriginal researchers. Additionally,\nthe term `Aboriginal' was substituted for the term `people\nof my ethic group' (e.g. `I feel that Aboriginal people are\nnot treated the same as people of other groups by doctors\nand healthcare workers'). Items were scored on a 5-point\nscale from `very dissatisfied' to `very satisfied', where\nhigher scores reflected greater perceived cultural stigma\nand discrimination (=.92).\nPerceived hepatitis C stigma was measured using an\n18-item scale based on previous scales used to measure\nstigma perceived to be associated with HIV (e.g. `Most\npeople believe I am dirty because I have hepatitis C';\nBrener and Von Hippel, 2008). Items were scored on a\n5-point scale from `strongly disagree' to `strongly agree'\nwith higher scores indicative of greater experiences of per-\nceived HCV-related stigma (=.92)\nPerceived HCV-related discrimination and exclusion in\nthe healthcare sector was examined using items modified\nfrom previous research (Brener et al., 2013). The scale con-\nsisted of eight items assessing participants'experience with\nhealthcare workers in relation to their HCV (e.g. `they are\ncareful not to touch me'). Items were scored on a 5-point\nscale from `not at all'to `an extreme amount'(=.89), with\nhigher scores indicating greater perceived discrimination\nfrom health workers in relation to HCV.\nHCV knowledge.As individuals living with HCV need to\nhave knowledge about their illness in order to understand\nthe benefits of making positive lifestyle changes, it was\nimportant to assess participants' HCV knowledge. Partici-\npants responded to 16 items regarding the natural history,\ntransmission, testing and treatment of HCV. Items were\neither multiple-choice or true/false questions. Participants'\ncorrect responses were summed together to create a knowl-\nedge score that ranged from 0 to 16, where a higher scored\nrepresented greater HCV knowledge.\nQuality of life.To establish participant feelings about the\nquality of their life, they were asked a single-item question,\n`How would you rate your quality of life' and answered on\na 5-point scale from very poor to very good.\nResilience. Psychological resilience was measured using the\n10-item Connor\u00adDavidson Resilience Scale (e.g. `I believe\ncoping with stress strengthens me'; Connor and Davidson,\n2003). Items were scored from `not true at all' to `true\nnearly all of the time' with higher scores indicative of\ngreater resilience (=.92).\nTreatment intent.Treatment intentions were measured by\nasking participants whether they were planning to go on\nHCV treatment in the future. Participants chose from one of\nfour response categories including, in the next 12months,\nin the next 1\u00ad2years, not for at least 2years and that they\nnever intended to undergo treatment. Higher scores on this\nitem indicated that participants were less inclined to show\nintent to go on treatment in the near future, with the highest\nscore of 4 indicating no treatment intent.\nHealth lifestyle changes as a result of HCV diagnosis.Partici-\npants were asked whether they had made particular lifestyle\nchanges as a result of finding out that they were HCV posi-\ntive (Horwitz et al., 2012). The list consisted of six behav-\nioural changes all important in the management of HCV\n(i.e. changed your diet, reduced or cut out alcohol, increased\nexercise, had more regular HCV check-ups, reduced or cut\nout illicit drug use, accessed information about HCV care\nand treatment). Reponses to these items were 1 `yes' and 0\n`no'. The items were summed together to form a behaviour\nchange scale, whereby a higher score represented greater\nbehavioural change.\nDemographics.Participants were asked a range of demo-\ngraphic questions including whether they were of Aboriginal\nor Torres Strait Islander background, where their community\nwas from, age, gender, living arrangements, education,\nemployment, history of incarceration and sexuality.\nSample demographics\nA total of 203 respondents who self-reported currently liv-\ning with HCV, undertaking treatment or recently clearing\nthe virus naturally or through treatment participated in this\nstudy. Just over half of the sample was male with one par-\nticipant identifying as transgender (Table 1). The majority\nof the sample identified as Aboriginal, seven participants\nstated they were of bothAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander\nbackground. The mean age of the sample was 28\nyears\n(standard deviation (SD)\n=\nyears). Of the total sample,\nper cent were receiving government financials or assis-\ntance and just over 80per cent of the sample had ever been\nin prison. See Table 1 for additional demographics.\nBrener et al. 5\nResults\nThe means, standard deviation, inter-quartile range and\nCronbach's alpha of all scaled items are reported in Table 2.\nPearson's product moment correlation was used to deter-\nmine whether an association existed between Aboriginal\ngroup belonging and HCV knowledge, group-based\nMedical mistrust, perceived HCV stigma, perceived HCV-\nrelated discrimination and exclusion, quality of life, resil-\nience, HCV-related behavioural lifestyle changes and HCV\ntreatment intensions. As can be seen in Table 3, Aboriginal\ncommunity attachment was associated with a range of out-\ncome variables. Those who perceived themselves as being\nmore attached to their Aboriginal community reported less\nperceived HCV stigma and less perceived HCV-related\ndiscrimination and exclusion from healthcare workers.\nFurthermore, they showed greater resilience and reported\ngreater quality of life. Greater attachment to an Aboriginal\ncommunity was also associated with increased lifestyle\nchanges after their HCV diagnosis. On the other hand,\nHCV knowledge, HCV treatment intentions, age, education\nand gender were not associated with attachment to an\nAboriginal community.\nCorrelational analysis was also used to establish factors\nassociated with healthy lifestyle changes as a result of\nHCV diagnosis. Significant variables included HCV\nknowledge, HCV treatment intent, gender, education and\nas previously mentioned Aboriginal community attach-\nment. Hence, having greater HCV knowledge, showing\nmore intent to go onto HCV treatment in the future, being\nfemale, completing more education and reporting greater\nidentification with an Aboriginal group was associated\nwith greater lifestyle changes after HCV diagnosis.\nLifestyle changes following HCV diagnosis were not asso-\nciated with the three stigma items nor with resilience, qual-\nity of life or age.\nTable 1.Demographics.\nn (%)\nGender\nCultural identity\n Torres strait islander 0 (.0)\n Both Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 7 (3.4)\nEducation\nEmployment\nSD: standard deviation.\nTable 2.

Specifically, the out-\ncome variable, lifestyle changes following HCV diagnosis,\nwas regressed on the predictor variables which were sig-\nnificantly associated with lifestyle changes in the univariate\nanalysis (i.e. Aboriginal community attachment, HCV\nknowledge and HCV treatment intentions). As can be seen\nin the regression analysis (Table 4), after controlling for\ngender and education, showing future intent to go on HCV\ntreatment and having greater HCV knowledge both predict\ngreater lifestyle changes. Significantly, feelings of attach-\nment to an Aboriginal community remained independently\nassociated with healthier lifestyle changes related to HCV\nover and above HCV knowledge and HCV treatment intent.\nDiscussion\nThe results of this study highlight the importance of\nAboriginal community attachment as related to positive\nhealth outcomes among this sample of Aboriginal people\nliving with HCV. As the data illustrate, those who report a\nstronger sense of attachment to an Aboriginal community\nalso report a greater sense of resilience, increased quality of\nlife and less stigma associated with both HCV and within\nthe healthcare sector generally. A strong sense of group\nidentity may possibly act as a buffer against the negative\nhealth consequences of being part of a group that is racially\ndiscriminated against and who also live with a stigmatised\nillness through positive associations with that racial or eth-\nnic minority group (Branscombe et al., 1999; Phinney,\nIndeed, Sellers and Shelton (2003) argue, it is not just group\nbelonging but the meaning ascribed to that group that\nshapes how people are able to respond and can provide a\npositive frame of reference for stigmatised individuals.\nHaving a strong belief in the cultural values and ideologies\nof a minority group can therefore lead to positive associa-\ntions with this group (Sellers and Shelton, 2003) and may\nprovide the resources which enable the individual to both\ncope with stress associated with a chronic illness and make\npositive changes in their lifestyle to better their health\n(Miller and Kaiser, 2001). This possibility is further evi-\ndenced in the increase in reported resilience associated with\ngreater Aboriginal community attachment among this sam-\nple, and personal resilience is well known to increase the\nability to cope with an illness (Edward and Warelow, 2005;\nThe most significant finding in relation to Aboriginal\ncommunity attachment is the association with the impor-\ntant reported outcome of engaging in behaviours which\nincrease healthier lifestyles after HCV diagnosis. Having\nthe motivation to change behaviours in order to ensure a\nhealthier lifestyle especially in relation to HCV (i.e.\ndecreased alcohol consumption and decreased illicit drug\nuse), as well increasing exercise and visits to the doctor, are\nparticularly important in reducing the progression of HCV\nper cent had not had HCV treatment.\nTherefore, establishing factors that increase positive\nchanges in health behaviours in order to reduce the impact\nof this disease may reach a larger proportion of those\naffected with HCV than treatment \u00ad especially given struc-\ntural constraints around HCV treatment such as long wait-\ning lists and other deterrents like treatment side effects\nAdditionally, the association between increased lifestyle\nchanges and treatment intentions may also suggest that\nthose who make significant lifestyle changes have the\nresources and the motivation to take on HCV treatment in\nthe future.\nTable 4. Multiple regression: predictors of lifestyle changes related to HCV.\nHCV: hepatitis C.\n8 Health Psychology Open \nLiterature on the impact of stigma and discrimination on\nhealth and well-being of stigmatised minority groups tends\nto focus on negative outcomes, particularly that stigma\ncontributes to and exacerbates the effects of an illness\n(Scrambler, 2006). While this research is not suggesting\nthat Aboriginal people with HCV do not feel stigmatised in\nrelation to both their Aboriginal status and their HCV posi-\ntive status, what it may show is that being part of a cohesive\ncultural/ethnic group and identifying strongly with that\ngroup may have positive health outcomes as evidenced in\nthe increase of healthy behaviours among those who are\nmore strongly attached to their Aboriginal community.\nHence, the findings from this research appear to indicate\nthat not only does community attachment buffer the indi-\nvidual from negative health consequences as can be seen in\nrecent HIV research (Brener et al., 2013) but may actually\npromote the means or the motivation to engage in positive\nbehaviour changes including less alcohol and illicit drug\nuse, which will ultimately result in better long-term health\noutcomes for people living with HCV.\nThe study has some limitations which must be noted.\nWhile it is the largest known sample of Aboriginal people\nliving with HCV, it is a convenience sample and the incor-\nporation of sufficient numbers of participants from rural\nand remote Aboriginal communities in the state was diffi-\ncult to achieve. Additionally, the results described are\nlargely based on associations between the key outcome\nvariables of Aboriginal community attachment and/or\nhealthy lifestyle changes and the other predictor variables.\nHowever, the findings in this study of the significance of\nAboriginal community attachment and the importance that\nit may have on health outcomes associated with HCV\nclearly indicates the need for further research in this area.\nDespite the noted limitations, the findings of this study\nhave some important implications for designing HCV\nhealth promotion interventions for Aboriginal Australians\nand for other Indigenous groups. The evidence of the\nimportance of Aboriginal group belonging in promoting the\nhealth lifestyle changes suggest that health intervention\nstrategies around HCV should focus on strategies to\nacknowledge, build and reinforce community attachment.\nA sense of community belonging is an important source of\npositive identification for many marginalised groups as is\nshown in this study. Within this framework, an understand-\ning of the difficulties and trauma which Aboriginal people\nhave been exposed to and the link to risk practices associ-\nated with HCV (Craib et al., 2009) should be highlighted\nalong with the resilience which these communities have\nshown in maintaining their community attachments\n(Atkinson, 2002). Hence, HCV-integrated care and treat-\nment models that incorporate important aspects of belong-\ning and attachment for Aboriginal community members in\nthis instance could be developed which include a partner-\nship between HCV services and Aboriginal community-\ncontrolled health services, peer support or patient navigator\nprogrammes and healthy liver programmes (including\nHCV testing and assessments). These should be based in\nAboriginal community settings or in mainstream services\nthat promote engagement of the target community and spe-\ncifically foreground or make apparent the centrality of\nAboriginal culture in service delivery. Such models are\nlikely to be effective for many Indigenous communities in\npromoting best health outcomes especially in the case of a\nstigmatised illness such as HCV.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research,\nauthorship and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nAhern J, Stuber J and Galea S (2007) Stigma, discrimination and\nthe health of illicit drug users.
