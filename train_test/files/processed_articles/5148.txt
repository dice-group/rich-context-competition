MI is a multifactorial disease with a complex\npathogenesis where lifestyle, individual genetic back-\nground and environmental risk factors are involved.1\nHowever, the pathogenesis of MI remains difficult to eluci-\ndate at the moment. Early diagnosis for MI risk is difficult\nas there is no well-documented indicator which can predict\nthe onset of MI. In past decades, lots of studies found that\ngene polymorphism might be associated with the risk of\nsome diseases and might become a potential marker for\nearly diagnosis of the onset of some diseases.2\u00ad5\nThe angiotensin II receptor includes two subtypes: type 1\nreceptor (angiotensin II type 1 receptor, AT1R) and type 2\nreceptor.6 TheAT1R, which is the primary pathogenic effector\nfor angiotensin II, is a member of the G-protein-coupled\nreceptor superfamily expressed in most tissues, where receptor\nactivation leads to vasoconstriction, water retention and vas-\ncular smooth muscle cell proliferation and hypertrophy.7 The\nAT1R is present predominantly in vascular smooth muscle\ncells and because of the physiological role of the AT1R in the\ncardiovascular system, the gene that encodes this molecule is\nA systematic review and meta-analysis\nof the association between angiotensin\npolymorphism and myocardial\ninfarction susceptibility\nXu Feng*, Bao-Shi Zheng*, Jun-Jie Shi, Jun Qian, Wei He and Hua-Fu Zhou\n Keywords\nAngiotensin II type-1 receptor,A1166C, gene polymorphism, myocardial infarction, meta-analysis\nDepartment of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of\nGuangxi Medical University, China\n*These authors contributed equally to this work.\nCorresponding author:\nHua-Fu Zhou, Department of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery, The First\nAffiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning 530021, China.\nEmail: zhouhuafudr@sina.com\nArticle\n308 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 15(3)\nan excellent candidate in the etiology of cardiovascular dis-\ntion of AT1R, might be implicated in the etiology of MI\nsusceptibility and had been investigated in numerous epide-\nmiologic studies. Zhang et al.9 performed the first meta-analy-\nsis to study the association of the AT1R gene A1166C\npolymorphisms with MI risk, and found an association of the\nC allele of AT1R gene A1166C polymorphisms with MI risk.\nThis meta-analysis was performed to update the conclusion of\nthe relationship between AT1R A1166C gene polymorphism\nand MI susceptibility, with the intention to provide a much\nmore reliable finding of the significance of this association.\nFurthermore, this meta-analysis first explored the association\nof AT1R A1166C gene polymorphism with MI susceptibility\nfor different ethnicities.\nMaterials and methods\nSearch strategy\nSearch strategy for the association of AT1R A1166C gene poly-\nmorphism with MI risk. Relevant studies were sought from\nthe electronic databases of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane\nLibrary on 1 March 2012. The retrieval strategy was that\n(angiotensin II type-1 receptor) AND polymorphism AND\n(myocardial infarction) were entered into these databases.\nThe search in PubMed or Embase was limited to English\nlanguage. Additional articles were identified through refer-\nences cited in the retrieved articles.\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\nInclusion and exclusion criteria for MI. Inclusion criteria\nwere (a) a case\u00adcontrol study; (b) the outcome had to be\nMI; (c) there had to be at least two comparison groups (MI\ngroup vs control group); (d) investigation on the associa-\ntion of AT1R A1166C gene polymorphism with MI risk.\nExclusion criteria were (a) review articles and editorials;\n(b) case reports; (c) investigation did not provide detailed\ndata of AT1R A1166C genotype distributions; (d) prelimi-\nnary results not about AT1R A1166C gene polymorphism\n(investigation on the association of other gene polymor-\nphism, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)\ninsertion/deletion gene polymorphism, with MI risk) or MI\nrisk (investigation on the association of AT1R A1166C\ngene polymorphism with the risk of other diseases, such as\nrenal disease); (e) investigating the role of AT1R inhibitors\nin diseases.\nData extraction and synthesis\nTwo investigators extracted the following information from\neach eligible study independently: first author's surname,\nyear of publication and the number of cases and controls for\nAT1R A1166C genotypes. The frequency of C allele was\ncalculated for the case group or the control group, from the\ncorresponding genotype distribution. The results were\ncompared and disagreements were resolved by discussion.\nStatistical analysis\nCochrane Review Manager Version 5 (Cochrane Library,\nUK) was used to calculate the available data from each\ninvestigation. The pooled statistic was counted using the\nfixed effects model, but a random effects model was per-\nformed when the p value of heterogeneity test was less than\ndichotomous data, and 95% confidence interval (CI) were\nalso calculated.12,13 For the pooled OR to be statistically sig-\nnificant, p<0.05 was required. I2 was used to test the hetero-\ngeneity among the included studies.14,15 In order to avoid\nexcessive comparisons, the OR was calculated by using three\nmethods: method 1, allele comparison (C allele vs A allele);\nmethod 2, comparing CC homozygous with the other two\ncombinations (CC vs CA+AA); method 3, comparing AA\ngenotype with the other two combinations (AA vs CC+CA).\nA chi-square (2) test using a web-based program was\napplied to determine if genotype distributions of the control\npopulation reported conformed to Hardy-Weinberg equilib-\nrium (HWE; p<0.05 was considered significant), and if the\ngenotype distributions in the controls significantly deviated\nfrom HWE then the study was excluded from our sensitive\nanalysis. The Begg adjusted rank correlation test16 and the\nEgger regression asymmetry test17 were used for exploring\npublication bias (p<0.1 was considered significant) when the\nsample number was more than 10. All descriptive data were\nexpressed as mean\u00b1standard deviation (SD).\nResults\nStudy characteristics for MI\nA total of 115 articles were retrieved in PubMed (70),\nEmbase (43), and Cochrane Library (2). Ninety-seven\narticles were excluded for the following reasons: review\narticles, editorials, case reports, preliminary result not\nabout AT1R A1166C gene polymorphism or MI, investi-\ngating the role of AT1R inhibitors in diseases. Eighteen\narticles were recruited into our investigation for the rela-\ntionship between AT1R A1166C gene polymorphism and\nMI susceptibility (Figure 1). The data of interest were\nextracted: first author's surname, year of publication and\nthe number of cases and controls for AT1R A1166C geno-\nof Africans,31,34 one study in the population of Durban in\nSouth Africa,32 and one study in the Brazilian popula-\ntion.33 The average frequency of C allele distribution in\npatients with MI for overall populations was 24.74% and\nthe average frequency in controls was 22.58%. The aver-\nage frequency of C allele distribution in Caucasians was\nthe average frequency of C allele distribution in Asians\nwith MI was 15.11%, and the average frequency in con-\ntrols was 11.27%. In African population, the average fre-\nquency of C allele distribution in MI patients was 22.05%,\nand the average frequency in controls was 17.92%. In\nDurban population, the frequency of C allele distribution\nin MI patients was 4.38%, and the frequency in controls\nwas 5.18%. In Brazil population, the frequency of C allele\ndistribution in MI patients was 27.73%, and the frequency\nin controls was 25.48%. The average frequency of C allele\nin patients with MI for overall populations was similar to\nthat in controls (MI/controls=1.10). The ratio of MI/con-\ntrol for the average frequency of C allele distribution in\nAsians or Africans was notably higher than that in\nCaucasians, the Durban population, or the Brazil popula-\nCaucasians: MI/control=1.06; Durban population: MI/\npolymorphism with MI risk\nIn this meta-analysis, a significant association between C\nallele and MI risk was observed in overall populations (Figure\n2(A); Table 2). However, the CC genotype was not associated\nwiththeMIsusceptibility(Figure2(B);Table2).Interestingly,\nAA genotype might be a protective factor against the risk of\nMI in overall populations (Figure 2(C); Table 2).\nDifference in race might have affected the results of our\nanalysis for the association of AT1R A1166C gene poly-\nmorphism with MI susceptibility.

In our study, we found that AT1R\nA1166C gene polymorphism was associated with MI sus-\nceptibility in overall populations. In our meta-analysis,\nthere was a significant association between the C allele\nand MI risk in overall populations, and AA genotype was\nassociated with a lower risk of MI in overall populations.\nHowever, CC genotype was not associated with MI risk for\noverall populations. We also performed a sensitivity analy-\nsis, and found that the results for overall populations were\nsimilar to those in the non-sensitivity analysis. There was\nno publication bias in overall populations. The results from\nthe overall populations might be robust to some extent.\nAccording to the duration time of the MI, MI can be\ndivided into acute MI and `old' MI, etc. Diagnosis of defi-\nnite AMI was based on World Health Organization (WHO)\ncriteria, i.e. patients should have any two of the following\nthree conditions: resting anginal chest pain lasting more\nthan 30 min, ST segment elevation >1 mm above baseline\nin at least two leads of a standard 12-lead electrocardio-\ngram, and creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) and CPK-MB\nelevation to at least twice the upper limit of the normal\nrange. Diagnosis of definite old MI was based on WHO\ncriteria, and the duration of the MI was more than three\nmonths. In this study, we also performed a meta-analysis to\ninvestigate the association of AT1R A1166C gene polymor-\nphism with acute MI/old MI susceptibility. Ten repo\nTable 1.

We re-ran the\nmeta-analysis and found that the pooled OR for the C allele\nwas favorable to the case group, although the difference was\nTable 2.

Furthermore, the pooled OR for the AA allele was\nfavorable to the control group, although the difference was\np=0.05). However, CC genotype was not associated with\nthe risk of MI (p=0.24). More well-designed studies should\nbe conducted in the future.\nEthnic variables might have affected the evaluation of\nthe association of gene polymorphism with the susceptibil-\nity of disease.36,37 In this meta-analysis, we also tested the\nethnic variable in the evaluation of association of AT1R\nA1166C gene polymorphism with MI susceptibility. Most\nof the recruited studies were from Caucasians. We found\nthat the AT1R A1166C gene polymorphism was not associ-\nated with MI susceptibility in Caucasians. Furthermore,\nthe results for Caucasians were similar to those in the\nnon-sensitivity analysis. There was no publication bias in\nstudies of Caucasians. The difference of the C allele distri-\nbution between the MI group and control group in\nCaucasians was not notable (MI/control=1.06). To sum up\nthe findings mentioned above, AT1R A1166C gene poly-\nmorphism was not associated with MI susceptibility in\nCaucasians, and the result might be robust to some extent.\nIn Caucasians, Berget al.18 reported that CC homozygo-\nsity appeared to be associated with MI in the Norwegian\npopulation. Fernandez-Arcas et al.20 found that the CC\ngenotype is an independent risk factor for MI. Canavy et\nal.21 reported the prevalence of the C allele carriers being\nhigher in patients with MI than in control individuals.\nHowever, some other studies reported that AT1R A1166C\ngene polymorphism was not associated with the MI\nFigure 3.

However, in the sen-\nsitivity analysis, there was a significant association between\nthe C allele and MI risk, and AA genotype was associated\nwith a lower risk of MI. These results from the sensitivity\nanalysis were inconsistent with those in the non-sensitivity\nanalysis. However, there were only three studies in our\nmeta-analysis for Asians, and only two studies in the sensi-\ntivity analysis. The difference of C allele distribution\nbetween MI group and control group in Asians was notable\n(MI/control=1.34). To sum up those findings mentioned\nabove, AT1R A1166C gene polymorphism might be associ-\nated with the MI susceptibility in Asians.\npolymorphism might affect the MI susceptibility in Chinese.\nphism had an association with AMI among north Indian\npatients. However, Bhoomi et al.30 reported that the AT1R\nA1166C CC genotype is not a risk factor for MI in patients\nin a South Indian population. The number of the included\nstudies for Asians was small, and it would be difficult for us\nto draw a robust conclusion for Asians. More studies in\nAsians should be performed in the future.\nIn Africans, the Durban population and the Brazilian\npopulation, the conclusions from the sensitivity analysis\nwere inconsistent with those in the non-sensitivity analysis.\nThere was no association between AT1R A1166C gene pol-\nymorphism and MI susceptibility in Africans, the Durban\npopulation, and Brazilian population. The number of the\nincluded studies for Africans, the Durban population, or\nBrazilian population was much too small, and it would be\ndifficult for us to draw a robust conclusion from them.\nFurther studies in Africans, the Durban population, and the\nBrazilian population should be performed.\nInterestingly, Zhang et al.9 performed the first meta-\nanalysis to study the association of the AT1R gene A1166C\npolymorphisms with MI risk, and found an association of\nthe C allele of AT1R gene A1166C polymorphisms with MI\nrisk in overall populations. It was similar with our result in\nthis meta-analysis. In this meta-analysis, we found that the\nAT1RA1166C gene polymorphism was not associated with\nthe MI susceptibility in Caucasians, and there was no sig-\nnificant publication bias. Interestingly, AT1R A1166C gene\npolymorphism might be associated with the MI susceptibil-\nity in Asians in the sensitivity analysis, and the frequency\nof C allele in the MI group was marked higher than that in\nthe control group in Asians. However, more studies for\nAsians should be performed in the future.\nThose findings mentioned above should be regarded\ncautiously because many other aspects, such as heterogene-\nity of enrolled cases, limited statistical power, variable\nstudy designs and different interventions, were likely to\naffect the results. Furthermore, whether the AT1R A1166C\ngene polymorphism is just linked with other discrete loci\ninvolved in the occurrence of MI is not clear at the moment.\nIn conclusion, C allele is a risk factor for the MI suscep-\ntibility in overall populations, and AA genotype might be a\nprotective factor against the MI risk in overall populations.\nFurthermore, AT1R C allele/AA genotype might be associ-\nated with MI susceptibility in Asians. However, more case-\ncontrol association investigations into larger, stratified\npopulations are required in the future.\nConflict of interest\nNone declared.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any funding\nagency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
