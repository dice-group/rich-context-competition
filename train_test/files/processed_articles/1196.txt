The primary hypothesis is that serum 25(OH)D\nlevel is inversely associated with recent URTI.\nMETHODS\ntional Center for Health Statistics conducted the Third Na-\ntional Health and   (NHANES III).\nWe performed a secondary analysis of this nationally repre-\nsentative, cross-sectional sample of the noninstitutionalized US\ncivilian population. We received a waiver from the Partners Hu-\nman Research Committee and the Colorado Multiple Institu-\ntional Review Board as an exempt study.\nFull details of the survey methods, including sampling, in-\nterview, examination, laboratory measurements, ethics ap-\nproval, and informed consent, are described elsewhere.28 Briefly,\nthe survey used a complex, stratified, multistage probability\nsample design. The NHANES III oversampled certain sub-\ngroups of people, including low-income persons, adolescents\naged 12 to 17 years, adults 60 years and older, blacks, and Mexi-\ncan Americans.\nIndividuals selected for participation were notified by let-\nter approximately 10 days before the home visit for the inter-\nview. The NHANES III collected household interview data, in-\ncluding demographic characteristics and data on health and\nsubsequently underwent physical and laboratory examina-\ntions in a mobile examination center or at a home visit. We lim-\nited this analysis to the 18 883 participants with reported se-\nrum 25(OH)D values, representing 195 million Americans.\nBecause physical and laboratory examinations occurred in mo-\nbile examination centers, inclement weather was an issue dur-\ning data collection. To avoid these issues and improve re-\nsponse, the NHANES III preferentially scheduled data collection\nin the lower latitudes (further south) during the winter and in\nthe higher latitudes (further north) in the summer.29\nFrom the household interview data, we analyzed information on\nself-reported age, sex, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic sta-\ntus, as measured by the poverty to income ratio (the ratio of a\nfamily's income to the poverty threshold of a family of the same\nsize). We recorded smoking history (current smoking and pack-\nyears), current asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-\nease (COPD) diagnosis from self-reported history. We defined\nCOPDbasedonresponsestoquestionsonemphysemaorchronic\nbronchitis. From the examination data, we calculated body mass\nindex as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared.\nBlood samples collected during the examination were cen-\ntrifuged, aliquoted, and frozen to \u00ad70\u00b0C on-site. They were then\nshipped on dry ice to central laboratories, where they were stored\nat \u00ad70\u00b0C until analysis. Serum 25(OH)D levels were measured\nusing a radioimmunoassay kit after extraction with acetoni-\ntrile (DiaSorin, Stillwater, Minnesota) by the National Center\nfor Environmental Health (Atlanta, Georgia). We used the date\nof the physical examination and laboratory data collection to\nmost accurately adjust for the effect of season on serum 25\n(OH)D levels.\nThe primary outcome (recent URTI) was based on the re-\nsponse to the following question: \"In the past few days, have\nyou had a cough, cold, or other acute illness?\" This question,\nasked during the physical and laboratory examination visit be-\nfore spirometric testing, was designed to identify participants\nwith recent URTIs, which could affect spirometry results. Se-\nlection of this outcome variable allowed for temporal proxim-\nity between 25(OH)D level and recent URTI because serum\nsamples were also obtained during the physical and labora-\ntory examination visit.\nWe performed statistical analyses using Stata 9.0 (StataCorp LP,\nCollege Station, Texas). Using survey commands, we applied the\nrecommended subsample weights for the interview plus exami-\nnation data to account for unequal probabilities of selection and\nto accurately represent estimates for the US population. All of\nthe results are presented as weighted values. We calculated vari-\nance based on NHANES-provided masked variance units using\nthe Taylor series linearization method.

When individually adding interaction\nterms to the final multivariable model, the interaction term\nfor COPD was not significant (P for interaction=.30) but\nwas significant for asthma (P for interaction=.007).\nCOMMENT\nTo our knowledge, this is the first population-based study\nto evaluate and demonstrate an association between se-\nrum 25(OH)D level and URTI. The association seems to\nbe robust, with a clinically and statistically significant as-\nsociation present in all seasons and when controlling for\npotential confounders. The dose-response association be-\ntween lower levels of vitamin D and recent URTI pro-\nvides further credibility to the findings.\nAlthough early clinical studies14-22 supported an asso-\nciation between rickets found with serum 25(OH)D lev-\nhave found an effect of low (including nonrachitic) se-\nrum 25(OH)D levels. For example, Laaksi et al25 found that\nyoung male Finnish soldiers with serum 25(OH)D levels\nof less than 16 ng/mL at baseline had a 63% increased risk\nof absence from duty due to RTI than did soldiers with\nserum 25(OH)D levels 16 ng/mL or more during the fol-\nlowing 6 months. In addition, case-control studies from\nIndia26 and Turkey27 reported an association between se-\nrum 25(OH)D levels of less than 20 ng/mL and acute lower\nRTI in children and neonates, respectively.\nIn this study, we also found that individuals with res-\npiratory tract diseases (ie, asthma and COPD) are of par-\nticular interest. Effect modification by asthma, and pos-\nsibly COPD, on the association between serum 25(OH)D\nlevel and recent URTI indicates that the role of vitamin D\nmay be of greater importance for individuals with these\ncommon conditions. Potential explanations may be that\nthose with respiratory tract diseases are more susceptible\nto RTI31,32 and have increased frequency of lower respira-\ntory tract symptoms of higher severity and longer dura-\ntion.33,34 These findings are particularly important given\nthe high morbidity from asthma and COPD exacerbation\nand merit further investigation.\nPreliminary studies on vitamin D supplementation and\nRTI also have been promising. Two interventional co-\ncod liver oil and multivitamin supplementation35 and\n60 000 IU weekly from a vitamin D or calcium supple-\nment36 found a decrease in RTIs in children receiving\nsupplementation. One randomized controlled trial37 of\nbone loss in postmenopausal black women found that\nof vitamin D daily reported respiratory tract symptoms\nduring 3-year follow-up compared with 25.0% in the con-\ntrol group. Another substudy38 of a randomized con-\ntrolled trial for fracture prevention found a nonsignifi-\ncant 10% reduced odds of wintertime infection in\nparticipants randomized to receive 800 IU of vitamin D\ndaily (P=.23). However, these studies were post hoc analy-\nses of adverse events reported in studies of skeletal health,\nand dedicated trials are warranted.\nThe emerging role of vitamin D in innate immunity pro-\nvides a plausible mechanism for the inverse association be-\ntween serum 25(OH)D level and URTI.14 The only known\nhuman cathelicidin, hCAP-18 (LL-37), enhances micro-\nbial killing in phagocytic vacuoles, acts as a chemoat-\ntractant for neutrophils and monocytes, and has a de-\nfined vitamin D\u00addependent mechanism.39,40 Pathogenic\nantigens interact with toll-like receptors on macrophages\nto upregulate the expression of genes that code for the vi-\ntamin D receptor and for the 1-hydroxylase enzyme that\nD interacts with the promoter of the gene for cathelici-\nThe presence of sufficient levels of 25(OH)D, the ma-\njor circulating form of vitamin D, is necessary to acti-\nvate hCAP-18 expression and to enhance macrophage\nfunction and innate immunity.45 In studies of Mycobac-\nterium tuberculosis, Liu et al42 found a direct association\nof serum 25(OH)D levels with cathelicidin expression and\nkilling of intracellular M tuberculosis. Furthermore, black\nindividuals, known to have increased susceptibility to tu-\nberculosis infection, had low serum 25(OH)D levels and\ninefficient cathelicidin messenger RNA induction, but\nsupplementation of 25(OH)D to the reference range re-\nstored induction of cathelicidin messenger RNA.42\nThe results from our article provide additional evi-\ndence from a large, diverse population of the inverse as-\nsociation between serum 25(OH)D level and RTI. Al-\nthough serum 25(OH)D levels of less than 10 ng/mL were\nassociated with the highest rate of recent URTI, serum\nassociated with higher adjusted odds of URTI compared\nwith levels of 30 ng/mL or more. Although individuals\nwith serum 25(OH)D levels of less than 10 ng/mL have\nthe least efficient cathelicidin expression, serum 25\n(OH)D levels of 30 ng/mL or more may be necessary for\nthe optimal induction of cathelicidin messenger RNA.42\nAlthough comparison of groups with 25(OH)D levels of\ngested a possible plateau of effect after approximately 30\nng/mL, this analysis was underpowered to evaluate\nwhether higher 25(OH)D levels (ie, 40 ng/mL) provide\nadditional benefit.\n\u00a92009 American Medical Association.

We could\nnot control for all potential confounders, but we se-\nlected covariates most likely to be associated with se-\nrum 25(OH)D level and recent URTI. Unmeasured con-\nfounders may have an effect on the association between\n25(OH)D level and URTI. Thus, causal inference is not\npossible, and we cannot exclude that the results are merely\nan epiphenomenon; randomized controlled trials are valu-\nable for determining the causal nature of an observed as-\nsociation. Reverse causation (ie, lower serum 25[OH]D\nlevels due to recent URTI and, thus, decreased outdoor\nactivity) seems unlikely because the half-life of serum 25\nbut it may affect the enhanced vitamin D\u00adURTI associa-\ntion in participants with asthma and COPD owing to\nlonger symptom duration in those individuals.\nTheprimaryoutcome(recentURTI)isarelativelycrude\nand self-reported measure that may include other non-\nRTIs; however, limitations on the accuracy of this out-\ncome would be expected to reduce the magnitude of as-\nsociations. Serum samples were collected at only 1 point\nin time and were preferentially collected in northern states\nin the summer and in southern states in the winter. As a\nresult, serum 25(OH)D levels are likely higher than would\nbe expected by random sampling across all seasons. Al-\nthough the overall serum 25(OH)D level and the recent\nURTI rate may be affected, it is unlikely that their asso-\nciation would be materially different. Nevertheless, we en-\ncourage efforts to replicate these findings in independent\nsamples.\nIn conclusion, serum 25(OH)D levels have an inde-\npendent, inverse association with recent URTI. Although\n25(OH)D levels less than 30 ng/mL and URTI were higher\nin the winter season, the inverse association was present\nthroughout the year.
