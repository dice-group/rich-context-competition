E-mail: leila.jackson@case.edu\nBACKGROUND: It has been hypothesized that exposure to exogenous estrogens may be associated with endometrio-\nsis and uterine myomas. We sought to investigate the association between heavy metals which have been shown to be\nhormonally active and these disorders using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999\u00ad\n2002. METHODS: Women aged 20\u00ad49 years who had data on metals and the outcomes of interest, were premenopau-\nsal and neither pregnant nor breastfeeding were eligible (n 5 1425). Lead, cadmium and mercury were measured in\nwhole blood. Diagnosis of outcomes was based upon self-report. Logistic regression was used to examine the associ-\nation between tertiles of heavy metals and disease adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, use of birth control pills prior\nto diagnosis and smoking status at diagnosis. RESULTS: A dose\u00adresponse association between cadmium and endo-\nmetriosis was observed [tertile 2 versus 1: adjusted odds ratio (OR) 5 1.94, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.73\u00ad\nanalysis to women diagnosed in the past 10 years and (ii) limiting analysis to women diagnosed since last pregnancy,\nalthough limited by sample size. CONCLUSIONS: These results must be interpreted with caution given the cross-\nsectional study design. The observed association between cadmium and endometriosis deserves further investigation\nin properly designed studies.\nKeywords: lead; cadmium; mercury; endometriosis; leiomyoma\nIntroduction\nEndometriosis and uterine myomas are prevalent gynecologi-\ncal disorders. Approximately 10% of women of reproductive\nage in the USA are diagnosed with endometriosis (Wheeler,\nlaparoscopy for infertility (Matorras et al., 1995). The inci-\nwith a lifetime cumulative incidence of 70\u00ad80% (Schwartz\ndisease and cost of treating the associated problems of inferti-\nlity, pelvic pain and abnormal uterine bleeding, endometriosis\nand uterine myomas represent a major public health problem in\nthis, few risk factors have been identified for either of these\ndisorders.\nEndometriosis has been associated with being of white race,\nhigher socio-economic status, leaner body mass, earlier age at\nmenarche, non-smoker, exercise and various environmental\nwith being of black race, an increased body mass index\n(BMI) and non-smoker (Schwartz et al., 2000). Both uterine\nmyomas and endometriosis are considered estrogen-dependent\ndiseases and have been associated with increased expression of\nestrogen receptor-a (ERa) in diseased tissues compared with\nnon-diseased tissues (Brandon et al., 1995; Benassayag et al.,\ndiseases are hormonally related, it has been hypothesized that\nexposure to exogenous estrogens may be associated with\ndisease development (Hunter et al., 2000; Schwartz et al.,\nSome heavy metals have been shown to have endocrine dis-\nrupting properties, interfering with the hypothalamic\u00adpitu-\nitary\u00adovarian (HPO) axis. Many adverse reproductive effects\nrelated to heavy metals have been observed in both toxicologi-\ncal and epidemiological studies; however, studies in relation to\nendometriosis and uterine myomas have been limited and\ninconsistent (Gerhard et al., 1998; Krugner-Higby et al.,\n# The Author 2008.

Lead, cadmium and mercury have all been shown\nto inhibit the binding of estradiol to the ERa receptor (Stoica\nlead and mercury having potential anti-estrogenic effects\nhaving estrogenic effects (Young et al., 1977; Stoica et al.,\nmetals are ubiquitous in the environment; however, the main\nsources of lead exposure are through lead-based paint, and con-\ntaminated soil, dust and drinking water; cadmium exposure is\nprimarily through cigarette smoke, air pollution and contami-\nnated food and mercury exposure through fish consumption,\nGiven this evidence, we used data from the National Health\nexamine the association between various heavy metals and\nendometriosis and uterine myomas. Given the estrogenic prop-\nerties of cadmium, we hypothesized that cadmium would be\npositively associated with an increased odds of endometriosis\nand uterine myomas, whereas lead and mercury would show\neither no associations or protective associations.\nMaterials and Methods\nData source\nbetween heavy metal levels in blood and having a previous diagnosis\nof endometriosis or uterine myomas. NHANES is a cross-sectional\nnational survey that assesses the health and nutrition of children and\nadults in the USA through questionnaires, physical examinations\nand laboratory tests. In 1999, the survey became a continuous,\nannual survey with 5000 individuals interviewed per year. The\nstudy population is a stratified, multi-stage probability sample of the\nthe study was over-sampled for low-income persons, adolescents,\npersons over 60 years of age, African Americans and Mexican Amer-\nicans. NHANES includes both a household interview and mobile\nexamination component (MEC). Detailed information regarding the\nNHANES survey can be found from the study website (http://www.\ncdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm).\nStudy population\nWomen participating in the MEC and who completed the reproductive\nhealth questionnaire were eligible for analyses (n \u00bc 6815) (Fig. 1).\nQuestions regarding endometriosis and uterine myomas were\nrestricted to those women 20\u00ad54 years of age, reducing the eligible\npopulation to 2818 women. Women who were currently peri- or post-\nmenopausal (n \u00bc 718), or pregnant and/or breastfeeding (n \u00bc 581)\nwere excluded from analyses as their current heavy metal levels\nmay have been influenced by these circumstances and less representa-\ntive of heavy metal levels at the time of diagnosis (Berkowitz et al.,\nfrom analyses as they were missing data on heavy metal levels. This\nresulted in further limiting the age range of eligible women to 20\u00ad\n49 years of age as mercury was not measured on women 50 years of\nage or older on the assumption they had completed their childbearing\nyears.\nDiagnosis of endometriosis and uterine myomas was based upon\ntwo questions: (i) `Has a doctor or other health professional ever\ntold you that you had endometriosis? Endometriosis is a disease in\nwhich the tissue that forms the lining of the uterus/womb attaches\nto other places, such as the ovaries, fallopian tubes etc.' and (ii)\n`Has a doctor or other health professional ever told you that you\nhad uterine fibroids? Uterine fibroids are benign (non-cancerous)\ntumors growing in various locations on or within the uterus/\nwomb'. Women reporting disease were further queried regarding\ntheir age at first diagnosis. Additional information on menarche,\ngravidity, parity and hormone use was obtained from the reproduc-\ntive health questionnaire. Data on other factors of interest such as\ndemographics, alcohol and smoking were obtained from their\nrespective questionnaires.\nBlood was drawn during the MEC for the purpose of measuring\nheavy metal levels, with lead and cadmium measured for all individ-\nuals 1 year of age or older and mercury measured for individuals 1\u00ad5\nyears of age and 15\u00ad49 years of age. Blood was collected in\nEDTA-anticoagulant vacutainers prescreened for background metal\ncontamination. Analyses for lead and cadmium were done by graphite\nfurnace atomic absorption spectroscopy and mercury by cold vapor\natomic absorption spectrophotometry. The limits of detection were:\nStatistical analysis\nAppropriate sample weights were used for analyses taking into\naccount the complex sampling design and non-response of the\nNHANES survey. Sampling errors were estimated using the Taylor\nseries linearized method. Women eligible and ineligible (pregnant,\nbreastfeeding, peri- or post-menopausal or missing heavy metals\ndata) for analyses, as well as eligible women with and without\ndisease, were compared on various demographic, lifestyle and repro-\nductive health factors using Pearson's x2 test (categorical variables),\nStudent's t-test (continuous, normally distributed variables) and\nKruskal\u00adWallis test (continuous, non-normally distributed variables).\nThe association between tertiles of heavy metals and endometriosis or\nuterine myomas was assessed using unconditional logistic regression\nproviding an odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for\nthe association between exposure and disease. An OR greater than\n1.0 indicates a greater odds of disease associated with exposure,\nwhereas an OR less than 1.0 indicates a decreased odds of disease\nassociated with exposure or a potential protective effect. If the CI\ndoes not include 1.0, then it is statistically significant. All three\nheavy metals were entered into the multivariable models together in\norder to examine the effect of the main metal of interest while control-\nling for the effects of the other two metals. Factors shown in the litera-\nture to be associated with heavy metals or the outcomes of interest or\nthat changed the association between heavy metals and outcomes by\nmore than 10% were examined as potential confounders. Furthermore\nin selecting potential confounders, we took into consideration the\ntiming of diagnosis and measurement of exposure and whether\ncurrent information on the confounder would be relevant to the\nexposure\u00adoutcome relationship. In the case of smoking and birth\ncontrol pills, we were able to determine use in relation to the timing\nof diagnosis; however, we were unable to do so for alcohol consump-\ntion or BMI based upon the data collected and therefore did not\ninclude them as potential confounders. Parity and gravidity also\nwere not considered as potential confounders as timing of diagnosis\nin relation to specific pregnancies could not be determined. Further\nanalyses limiting cases to those diagnosed within the last 10 years\nand those diagnosed after their last pregnancy were undertaken\ngiven concerns that heavy metal levels may have changed over\ntime. Additionally, we examined the association between metals and\noutcomes among post-menopausal women, given the high proportion\nof women with disease who had hysterectomies and were therefore\nJackson et al.\nexcluded from the main analysis. A P-value of ,0.05 was considered\nstatistically significant for all analyses. Stata, version 9.0 was used for\nall analyses.\nResults\nWomen who were 20\u00ad54 years of age and responded to the\nendometriosis and fibroid questions were excluded from ana-\nlyses if they were pregnant, breastfeeding, peri- or post-\nmenopausal or had missing data on heavy metals (Fig. 1).\nsal, 13% were peri-menopausal, 35% were post-menopausal\nand menopausal status could not be determined for 4%; 21%\nreported having had a hysterectomy (data not shown). Ineligi-\nble women were significantly more likely to have been diag-\nnosed with endometriosis or uterine myomas than eligible\nwomen (P , 0.001) (Table I). This was most likely due to\nthe fact that the mean age of ineligible women was nearly\n5 years older than eligible women (P , 0.001) and both endo-\nmetriosis and myomas tend to progress until menopause. Fur-\nthermore, women with endometriosis or myomas were\napproximately nine times more likely to have had a hyster-\nectomy than women without disease (P , 0.001) and were\ntherefore more likely to be excluded from analyses. Eligible\nwomen also differed significantly from ineligible women by\nrace/ethnicity, poverty ratio, marital status, BMI, smoking,\nalcohol consumption, gravidity, parity and ever use of birth\ncontrol pills (Table I). Ineligible women had significantly\nhigher blood lead levels, but significantly lower total blood\nmercury levels than eligible women; there was no significant\ndifference in blood cadmium levels between the two groups.\nvious diagnosis of endometriosis and 114 (8%) reported a pre-\nvious diagnosis of uterine myomas. The above included 16\n(1%) women who reported having a prior diagnosis of both\nendometriosis and uterine myomas (Table I). The mean age\nFigure 1: Study population for the association between heavy metals, endometriosis and uterine myomas, National Health and Nutrition Exam-\nHeavy metals, endometriosis and uterine myomas\nof the study population was 33.7 years.

Blood mercury levels showed a potential protec-\ntive effect in relation to endometriosis in adjusted analyses,\nconsistent with the proposed anti-estrogenic effect of\ning for potential confounders, no association was observed\nbetween heavy metals and uterine myomas, except a potential\nnon-significant protective effect of lead.\nThe major sources of cadmium are through cigarette smoke\n(both active and passive), shellfish and green leafy vegetables\nwith levels in food directly associated with contaminated\nwater and soil. Among women with endometriosis, 35% were\ncurrent smokers at the time of diagnosis, 6% former and 59%\nnever smokers. This differed from women without endometrio-\nsis of whom 24% were current smokers at the time of the\nsurvey, 15% former and 61% never smokers. Cadmium tends\nto bioaccumulate in the tissues of the kidney and liver, but\nhas been found in uterine tissue (Nasiadek et al., 2005) and fol-\nlicular fluid (Zenzes et al., 1995) with levels significantly\nhigher in smokers than in non-smokers (Zenzes et al., 1995).\nThe half-life of cadmium in the kidney has been estimated to\nhad low blood cadmium levels with 25% of women having\nlevels below the limit of detection (0.3 mg/l) and 90% of\nwomen had levels less than or equal to 1 mg/l. This lack of\nvariability in exposure limited our ability to detect significant\nassociations; however, we still observed a statistically signifi-\ncant association between the upper tertile of cadmium exposure\n(0.5 mg/l) and endometriosis.\nAlthough cigarette smoke is associated with anti-estrogenic\neffects (Baron et al., 1990), cadmium, a contaminant in ciga-\nrettes, has been associated with estrogenic effects. Studies\nhave shown that cadmium mimics estrogen activity in breast\ncancer cells and can bind to and inhibit the ERa receptor\nassociated with earlier onset of vaginal opening, increased\nuterine weights and enhanced mammary development\n(Johnson et al., 2003), and decreased gonadotrophin binding\nand altered steroidogenic enzyme activity in granulosa cells\nwomen, cadmium induced menstrual cycle abnormalities\n(Wang and Tian, 2004), difficulties conceiving (Wang and\nTian, 2004) as well as preterm deliveries (Laudanski et al.,\nTwo previous studies investigating the association between\ncadmium and endometriosis found no association (Heilier\nlevels at the time of diagnosis of peritoneal endometriosis\n(ENDO) and/or deep endometriotic nodules (DEN) and com-\npared them with controls. Blood cadmium levels were extre-\nmely low in one study with a GM of 0.10 mg/l for all three\ngroups, substantially lower than our study population (Heilier\net al., 2004). The second study observed blood cadmium\nlevels (DEN \u00bc 0.4 mg/l; ENDO \u00bc 0.4 mg/l; both DEN and\nENDO \u00bc 0.3 mg/l; controls \u00bc 0.4 mg/l) similar to those we\nobserved in the NHANES analysis (Heilier et al., 2006). In\nthis study, they did find a borderline significant protective\neffect in relation to blood lead levels when comparing DEN\nalone (P , 0.05) and all types of endometriosis to controls\n(P \u00bc 0.046). Blood lead levels were slightly higher in this\nstudy population (all cases \u00bc 1.7 mg/dl; controls 2.2 mg/dl),\ncompared with the NHANES analysis. This protective effect\nof lead is consistent with its hypothesized anti-estrogenic\neffect, but in contrast to the NHANES analysis which found\nno association, as well as a study of rhesus monkeys that\nobserved an increased risk of endometriosis associated with\nlead exposure (Krugner-Higby et al., 2003). Only one study\nhas examined the association of cadmium and uterine\nmyomas, finding that cadmium tissue levels were significantly\nlower in myoma tissue than in the normal myometrium (P ,\nation between either lead or mercury in relation to uterine\nmyomas were found in the literature.\nThis analysis has several limitations. As endometriosis and\nuterine myomas were self-reported, and not confirmed\nthrough medical records, it is likely there may be some mis-\nclassification of outcomes. We do not know if reported cases\nwere confirmed surgically; and therefore, some reported\ncases may not truly be cases; however, within the Nurses'\nHealth Study, investigators reviewed medical records of\nwomen self-reporting an endometriosis diagnosis and were\nable to confirm 88.6% of all self-reported cases (Missmer\net al., 2004). Conversely, some women may have had undiag-\nnosed endometriosis or uterine myomas as they were asympto-\nmatic or had not sought medical attention. The overall\nprevalence of endometriosis in our sample of eligible women\n(5.5%) was lower than the prevalence expected among\nwomen of reproductive age due to our exclusion criteria;\nhowever, the overall prevalence of endometriosis in\nobserved in other studies (Wheeler, 1989). If the misclassifi-\ncation of disease status is non-differential by exposure status,\nwe would expect our results to be biased toward the null;\nhowever, if the misclassification is differential, the direction\nof bias could be in either direction.\nExposure misclassification is also a concern as exposure was\nmeasured after the diagnosis of disease, in some cases many\nyears later. All three metals bioaccumulate in the body,\nwhich may result in an increase in blood metal levels since\nthe time of diagnosis. However, in some instances, metal\nlevels may decrease as has been shown with lead due to the\nmobilization of lead from bone during pregnancy and breast-\nfeeding resulting in potentially lower levels in women who\nhad intervening pregnancies (Hertz-Picciotto et al., 2000;\nheavy metal levels changed over time and are not representa-\ntive of exposure prior to disease, it may bias the results.\nTaking this into consideration, we examined heavy metal\nlevels by years since diagnosis, and did not see major\nchanges in metal levels. We carried out sub-analyses excluding\nthose women diagnosed 10 or more years prior to NHANES in\none analysis and women diagnosed prior to their last pregnancy\nHeavy metals, endometriosis and uterine myomas\nin a second analysis and did not observe substantial changes in\nthe risk estimates.\nWe excluded women who were peri- or post-menopausal,\npregnant or breastfeeding due to concerns that their heavy\nmetal levels would not be representative of levels at the time\nof diagnosis based on prior research (Berkowitz et al., 1999;\nreported hysterectomies automatically being excluded from\nanalyses. Overall, women in NHANES who reported a diagno-\nsis of endometriosis or uterine myomas were approximately\nnine times more likely to report having a hysterectomy. By\nexcluding these women, we limited our sample size and may\nhave underestimated the true OR if there is an association\nbetween metals and disease, especially if these women rep-\nresent more severe cases that would be more readily diagnosed.\nIn further analyses, we did observe a positive, but non-\nsignificant association between cadmium and endometriosis\namong post-menopausal women when limiting analysis to\nwomen diagnosed in the past 10 years. No information was\navailable regarding the staging of endometriosis, so we were\nunable to explore the effect disease severity may have on the\nassociation between exposure and disease.\nFinally, given the limited research in this area, it is not clear\nwhat the critical window of exposure might be in relation to\nendometriosis or uterine myomas. In utero or early childhood\nexposures may alter the development of the HPO axis resulting\nin disease later in life; current exposures may target the HPO\naxis, resulting in altered gonadotrophin secretion; or alterna-\ntively current exposures may interfere with receptor binding\nor number leading to, or exacerbating, disease. The differences\nobserved in the few studies examining the association between\nheavy metals and gynecological disorders may be related to the\ndifferent timing of exposure assessment. These areas need\nfurther exploration.\nThe NHANES data provided a nationally representative\nsample in which to explore this research question making the\nstudy results generalizable to the USA. Consistent with other\nliterature, White, non-Hispanic women were significantly\nmore likely to have a diagnosis of endometriosis than other\nwomen; and Black, non-Hispanic women were significantly\nmore likely to have a diagnosis of uterine myomas compared\nMissmer and Cramer, 2003). In addition, both current and\nformer smoking status at diagnosis showed a non-significant,\nprotective effect for endometriosis and uterine myomas after\nadjusting for lead, cadmium, mercury, race/ethnicity, age\nand use of birth control pills prior to diagnosis, as has been\nThese results must be interpreted with caution given the\ncross-sectional nature of this study with disease onset and diag-\nnosis occurring prior to the measurement of heavy metals.\nAlthough the study lacks temporality of association, we have\nshown that lead and cadmium were not significantly different\nby time since diagnosis, especially among those with diagnosis\nless than 10 years prior to participation in NHANES. Despite\nthe limitations of the NHANES data to examine this study\nquestion, we did observe a significant association between\nincreasing levels of cadmium and endometriosis. This associ-\nation deserves further investigation in a study designed to\nanswer this question specifically.\nReferences\nAgency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR).
