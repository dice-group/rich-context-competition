    "abstract": "Abstract\nResearch has found that more aggressive cartoons are perceived as funnier. The current study (N = 106; 16 cartoons)\nexamined this finding in more detail by additionally including painfulness and cleverness rankings of cartoons, and by examining\npossible moderating effects of different humor styles, self-esteem (explicit, implicit), and social desirability. Aggressive or\npainful cartoons were not perceived to be funnier, but were rated as having a cleverer punch line. Effects were only weakly\ncorrelated with participants' humor styles, but were independent of self-esteem and social desirability. This suggests that\naggressive cartoons are not in general perceived to be funnier than non-aggressive ones, and that there may be other\nmoderators influencing this effect (e.g., the type of cartoons, definition of aggression and funniness, cultural aspects).\n",

Support for this theory\nhas been found for cartoons (e.g., Byrne, 1956). People seem\nto find aggressive cartoons funnier than non-aggressive ones.\nOne of the strongest pieces of evidence for this effect was\npresented by McCauley, Woods, Coolidge, and Kulick\n(1983) in a series of six studies. They found that participants\nrated aggressive cartoons as funnier than non-aggressive\nones regardless of participants' demographics (children, stu-\ndents, adults, native vs. foreign born, socioeconomic status)\nandthestudymaterialused(differentcartoonsets).McCauley\nand colleagues (1983) correlated the mean rankings of the\naggressiveness of a certain set of cartoons (rated by one\ngroup of participants) with the mean rankings of the funni-\nness of the same set of cartoons (rated by a different group of\nparticipants) and found a strong positive correlation.\nAlthough further replications found some support for the\nconnection between humor and aggressive or disparaging\ncontent in cartoons (Zillmann, 1983), other studies failed to\ndo so (Deckers & Carr, 1986), and yet others have found\nnegative correlations (Love & Deckers, 1989). This incon-\nsistency suggests that there may be other factors (e.g., indi-\nvidual differences) influencing the connection between the\naggressiveness and funniness of cartoons.\nIndeed, some studies have found individual differences in\nthe described effect. Women judged sexist cartoons to be less\nfunny, regardless of how aggressive the cartoons were (Love\n& Deckers, 1989). Boys and girls who rated violent cartoon\nfilms as funnier also had higher scores on neuroticism, psy-\nchoticism, sensation seeking, and a higher sensitivity to\nreward (but not to punishment; Aluja-Fabregat &\nTorrubia-Beltri, 1998). When using ratings of painfulness\ninstead of aggression, men were found to rate painful car-\ntoons as funnier (low positive correlation), whereas women\nwere found to rate them as less funny (medium negative cor-\nrelation; Barrick, Hutchinson, & Deckers, 1990). Although\nsome of these studies used slightly different methods (e.g.,\nAluja-Fabregat & Torrubia-Beltri, 1998) compared with the\noriginal study by McCauley and colleagues (1983), more\nrecent research suggests that the effect of aggressiveness on\nhumor in cartoons is not as general as has been proposed, but\nmay be moderated by individual differences (see also La\nThe aim of the present study was to replicate the findings\nof the parent study of McCauley and colleagues (1983) and\nto further examine possible moderating effects. The follow-\ning adjustments were made: (a) a larger sample size (n > 100)\nwas obtained than in the initial studies by McCauley and col-\nleagues (1983; median = 20), resulting in higher statistical\npower; (b) participants had to also rate cartoons for painful-\nness, which has been found to have a higher variability than\naggression ratings, leading to a more reliable correlation\nwith funniness (Deckers & Carr, 1986); (c) funniness may\nalso have something to do with the intelligence of the punch\n1University of Konstanz, Germany\n2University of Vienna, Austria\nThe author Anton K.

For example, individuals\nusing affiliative humor (e.g., telling jokes to amuse others) or\nself-enhancing humor (e.g., having a humorous outlook on\nlife) tend to have higher self-esteem compared with individ-\nuals using aggressive humor (e.g., sarcasm, teasing) or self-\ndefeating humor (e.g., amusing others by saying denigrating\nthings about oneself). Therefore, a possible hypothesis would\nbe that individuals using positive humor styles, such as affili-\native or self-enhancing humor, will find aggressive cartoons\nless funny, whereas individuals using negative humor styles,\nsuch as aggressive or self-defeating humor, will find aggres-\nsive cartoons funnier. Furthermore, when individuals rank\ncartoons both on humor and aggression, these rankings could\nbe in danger of being influenced by impression management\nor social desirability concerns. Therefore, a measure of social\ndesirability was additionally included.\nMethod\nParticipants\nParticipants (N = 106; 51 men) were mainly from Austria\nMeasures\nCartoon ranking task.Eighteen cartoons were randomly\nselected from a single cartoonist (www.nicht-lustig.de). A\nsingle cartoonist was explicitly used to avoid influences\nfrom different cartoon characteristics, for example, color\nversus black-and-white and fictitious physiques versus real\nhumans or animals. The cartoons were checked for their\nappropriateness (e.g., variation in aggressiveness) by the\nauthors and research assistants, which resulted in the exclu-\nsion of two cartoons. Finally, 16 cartoons were used for the\nstudy. Cartoons were color-printed, laminated, and num-\nbered on the back. Participants had to rank all cartoons from\n1 to 16 in descending order (without ties) according to\nfunniness, aggressiveness, painfulness, and cleverness,\nrespectively. Except for the funniness ranking, all ranking\ntasks were accompanied with a definition to prevent ambigu-\nity--Aggressiveness: \"Are the cartoon figures showing\naggressive facial expressions or gestures? Are they acting\naggressively (i.e., provocation) or are they forcing someone\nto do something?\" Painfulness: \"Is there any physical and\nemotional harm as a consequence of violence of the comic\nfigures against others or themselves?\" Cleverness: \"How\nsurprising or clever is the punch line?\".\nHumor Styles Questionnaire (HSQ).

Individu-\nals rate their initial name letters superior to non-name letters\n(i.e., name\u00adletter effect). This effect has been proposed as a\nmeasure of implicit (i.e., automatic, unconscious, habitual)\nself-esteem. As recommended, a duplicate administration\nwas used and the name\u00adletter effect was calculated sepa-\nrately for the first and last name initial (Stieger, Voracek, &\nFormann, 2012). To control for possible series effects, four\npre-randomized lists of letters were used (r\ntt,first name\nr\ntt,last name\n( = .76) and is a widely used scale for measuring social\ndesirability.\nProcedure\nSeveral research assistants recruited participants from the\ngeneral population through their personal contacts (e.g.,\nfriends, relatives) and by word-of-mouth, resulting in a com-\nmunity-based sample. After a brief instruction, participants\nperformed the cartoon ranking tasks (each participant was\nassigned to one of the four pre-randomized different orders),\nfollowed by the first administration of the IPT, then a second\ncartoon ranking task, the SDS-17, RSES, HSQ, third cartoon\nranking task, the second administration of the IPT, and\nfinally the fourth cartoon ranking task followed by basic\ndemographic questions (sex, age, nationality, initial letter of\nfirst and last name).\nStieger and Formann 3\nAnalysis\nFollowing the procedure of McCauley and colleagues (1983),\nthe median ranks for aggressiveness, funniness, painfulness,\nand cleverness were calculated separately for each cartoon\n(i.e., analysis on cartoon level). Next, Spearman rank-order\ncorrelations were computed for these median ranks for all of\nthe four ranking dimensions (see Table 1).\nFor the analyses of individual differences, all rankings of\neach participant were correlated with each other, thus result-\ning in six Spearman rank-order correlations (i.e., analysis at\nthe participant level). These correlations were transformed to\nFisher's z prior to analysis. Funniness\u00adcleverness and\naggressiveness\u00adpainfulness correlations were excluded from\nfurther analyses because they were not central to the research\nquestion. IPT effects were calculated separately for the first\nand last name initial (Stieger et al., 2012) using the recom-\nmended I algorithm (LeBel & Gawronski, 2009).\nResults\nCartoon Characteristics: Are Aggressive Cartoons\nFunnier?\nOrder of rankings had no effect onto correlations (all Fs <\n1.72, all ps > .17) and was therefore not considered in the\nfollowing analyses. The cartoons showed large variance\nregarding their mean ranks on funniness (funniest cartoon =\n4.8, least funniest cartoon = 10.5), aggression (most aggres-\nsive = 5.3, least aggressive = 13.4), painfulness (most painful\n= 3.3, least painful = 13.6), and cleverness (most clever =\n5.5, least clever = 10.5). So in every category, there was a\nclear tendency toward the most and least funny, aggressive,\npainful, and clever cartoon (all Kruskal\u00adWallis tests: p <\n.001). This suggests that the used cartoons were heteroge-\nneous enough on aggressiveness, funniness, painfulness, and\ncleverness to establish effects.\nThe assumed rationale that aggressive cartoons are per-\nceived as funnier (McCauley et al., 1983) was not replicated\n(Table 1). In addition, painfulness rankings, which have been\nsuggested as a more appropriate measure (Deckers & Carr,\n1986), were not correlated with funniness.1 As expected, car-\ntoons that were perceived to be cleverer were also perceived\nas funnier, and more aggressive cartoons were found to be\nmore painful. Interestingly, cartoons that were rated as being\ncleverer were also rated as more aggressive and more pain-\nful. This can be interpreted as mild support for the hypothesis\nof McCauley and colleagues (1983), insofar as more aggres-\nsive (which may be similar to painful) cartoons were also\nperceived as being cleverer (which may be similar to\nfunniness).\nPerson Characteristics: Is the Effect Moderated\nby Individual Differences?\nOrder of rankings had no impact on the present study's vari-\nables (all Fs < 1.91, all ps > .13) and Spearman rank-order\ncorrelations were not sex-specific (all |ts| < 1.16, p > .25).\nHence, the following analyses were not separated for differ-\nent orders of rankings and participant sex.\nThere was high variability within Spearman rank-order\ncorrelations (range = -.60 to 1.00), suggesting that individ-\nual differences may have had an influence on the basic effect\non the cartoon level, which was anticipated based on past\nresearch results. Out of 36 possible moderating effects tested\n(see Table 2), only two significant correlations were found\n(both for the self-enhancing humor style). Participants with\nhigher self-enhancing humor found painful cartoons funnier\nbut aggressive cartoons less funny.\nDiscussion\nThe effect that aggressive cartoons are funnier was not repli-\ncated in the present study, even though the design used had\nhigher statistical power than the initial studies (McCauley et\nal., 1983), insofar as we used 5 times more participants (N =\nmean\nmean\n= 11). Our results corroborate those of Deckers and Carr\n(1986), who also did not find a significant correlation (r =\n.22, ns) when using a different set of cartoons than McCauley\nand colleagues (1983). Furthermore, Deckers and Carr\nalthough of much lower size than the aggressiveness correla-\ntion of McCauley and colleagues (1983; r\nmean\n.49-.90). Again, this effect could not be replicated with the\ncurrent study. What was found instead were significant cor-\nrelations between cleverness and painfulness, as well as\nbetween cleverness and aggression. Cleverness was defined\nby the question \"How surprising or clever is the punch line?\"\nTable 1. Spearman Rank-Order Correlations Between Median Rankings of Cartoons.\n1.Funniness \nNote. n = 16 cartoons.\n4 SAGE Open\nwhich is very similar to funniness. Thus, the aggressiveness\u00ad\nfunniness relationship found by McCauley and colleagues\n(1983) could be reinterpreted as an aggressiveness\u00adclever-\nness or painfulness\u00adcleverness relationship.\nThus, the basic effect does not seem to be as general as\nreported (McCauley et al., 1983). Moreover, it must be noted\nthat research on the topic lacks exact definitions and clear\ndemarcations of what is meant by aggressiveness, funniness,\npainfulness, or cleverness. Aggression (e.g., verbal aggres-\nsion, physical aggression) and funniness (e.g., duration of\nlaughing, surprise of the punch line; see Martin, 2007) are\nboth broad concepts that can be operationalized in many dif-\nferent ways.\nFurthermore, a number of general humor theories propose\nthat individuals prefer jokes or cartoons in which the target\nperson is unaffiliated (i.e., a member of a social out-group\nrather than an in-group member; see Ferguson & Ford,\n2008). The current study entirely used fictional cartoon fig-\nures. Thus, it may have been that participants did not per-\nceive the cartoon figures as group members at all (neither\nin-group nor out-group).\nFurthermore, regarding Ruch's factor-analytical investi-\ngations, three types of humor can be classified: incongruity-\nresolution humor (i.e., classical humor), nonsense humor\n(e.g., Gary Larsen cartoons), and sexual humor (see Martin,\n2007). McCauley et al.'s cartoons were rather of the first\ntype, whereas our cartoons were of the second type, which\ncould also be the reason for the nil effect.\nAnother possibility could be related to the social percep-\ntion of the cartoon figures. Gutman and Priest (1969) found\nthat jokes from socially acceptable aggressors were per-\nceived as funnier than jokes from socially unacceptable ones.\nThis also applies to the victim of the joke, but the rationale is\nswitched. Jokes about socially unacceptable victims are\nfound to be funnier (i.e., \"deserves\" the aggression; Gutman\n& Priest, 1969) than jokes about socially acceptable victims.\nAlthough these results only apply to jokes and not cartoons,\nit could be that participants in the present study did not judge\nthe cartoon figures in relation to social acceptability at all,\nbecause cartoon figures were fictional. This may have low-\nered the chances of detecting a possible funniness\u00adaggres-\nsion link.\nFinally, although we avoided using cartoons from differ-\nent cartoonists, the cartoons we used nevertheless differed in\nseveral respects that we did not control for. For example,\nhaving a look at the cartoons from nichtlustig.de, some are\nscatological, others are cute or represent dark humor, some\ninvolve animals, and some only humans. We judged the car-\ntoons used on these dimension and found that none of them\nhad scatological phrases or can be regarded as \"cute.\" One\ncartoon can be regarded as representing dark humor, six\ndepicted only animals, and five showed animals as well as\nhumans. Although post hoc analyses were not possible\nbecause of the too low sample size, future research might try\nto take further moderating cartoon characteristics into\naccount.\nFrom the individual perspective, only the self-enhancing\nhumor style showed significant correlations. Interestingly,\nparticipants with a self-enhancing humor style found painful\ncartoons funnier, but aggressive cartoons less funny. Self-\nenhancing humor is characterized by generally humorous\noutlook on life and maintaining a humorous perspective even\nin the face of stress and hardship (Martin et al., 2003). This\nhumor style is positively associated with openness to experi-\nence, self-esteem, and psychological well-being, and repre-\nsents a positive form of humor (contrary to the negative\nforms such as aggressive and self-defeating humor styles).\nThis might be the reason why participants with this humor\nstyle did not judge aggressive cartoons as funnier. In the\nsame vein, these participants also judged painful cartoons as\nfunnier. Aggressiveness was defined as violent or aggressive\nacts against others whereas painfulness was defined as harm\nto others or oneself. So aggressiveness was clearly defined as\nother-related, whereas painfulness was unspecific about the\ntarget. Although this rationale sounds reasonable, it should\nbe treated with caution because correlations were weak and\nTable 2.

Thus, the uncovered results may also reflect a statisti-\ncal Type I error.\nAlthough the uncovered results are mainly nil findings,\nthis study adds to the current literature in two respects. First,\naggressive cartoons may be not as funny as has been pro-\nposed and, second, although the high variability within cor-\nrelations proposes individual differences, this variability\nmay be rather due to other potential variables (e.g., type of\ncartoons, definitions of aggression).\n"
