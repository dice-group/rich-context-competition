Simultaneous probit models are used to analyze distance and contact as jointly\ndetermined outcomes with datafrom the USC Longitudinal Study of Generations and Mental Health. Results from\nthese analyses indicate that children'sl971 educational aspirations and social classposition predict 1991 distance and\ncontact between generations. Parents who have lower 1991 incomes, however, livefarther from children and talk with\nthem on the telephone less frequently than higher-income parents. Thus, the effects of early social class position\nsupport the modified extendedfamily model, whereas the effects of current social class position support the changing\nfamily constraints model.\nAS parents age, they may depend more on their children\nL for social support (Ingersoll-Dayton and Antonucci,\n1988), and thus rely more on children being close by or in\nfrequent contact with them. A family's social class position,\nhowever, may have long-term effects on both geographic\ndistance and frequency of contact between generations.\nSocial class has enduring effects on changes in family\nresources and relationships over the life course (Oppen-\nheimer, 1981). These changes may affect aging parents'\nfuture proximity to, or contact with, their adult children.\nThe modified extended family model, proposed by Litwak\nclass families have different ways of adjusting distance and\ncontact in order to fulfill commitments to family members\nwhile also meeting the achievement demands of modern\nsociety. The model, however, assumes that both middle- and\nworking-class people will have stable careers and families,\nwhich will give them the resources to adjust geographic\ndistance or frequency of contact with their parents later in\nlife. Yet the availability of stable careers has decreased in\nily instability has risen (Bumpass and Raley, 1992; Wilkie,\n1991). Such changes may have particularly adverse effects\non aging working-class parents, since they depend a great\ndeal on immediate kin for social support (Litwak, 1985).\nDespite these changes in work and family life, researchers\nin the sociology of aging have yet to investigate whether the\nmodified extended family model still accurately predicts the\neffects of early social class position on both geographic\ndistance and frequency of contact between generations.\nOften, in fact, researchers estimate the effects of distance on\ncontact without considering the possibility that early social\nclass position may influence both distance and contact\n1992). Research that does not take this possibility into\naccount, however, may produce biased estimates of the\nrelationship between distance and contact (Wolf, 1994).\nIn this article, we analyze the relationships between fam-\nily social class position and the kind and degree of contact\nbetween middle-aged children and their parents, as well as\nthe relationship between contact and geographic distance.\nTwo alternative sets of hypotheses are tested. The first,\nderived from the modified extended family model (Litwak,\n1960a), predicts that social class is related to distance and in-\nperson contact; the second predicts that social class is no\nlonger strongly related to distance or in-person contact due to\nchanging constraints on family resources. Data from the\nnia Longitudinal Study of Generations and Mental Health\nare used to examine social class effects over a period in\nwhich substantial changes in work and family life occurred.\nThe conceptual models assume that early social class posi-\ntion and family commitments may affect both later geo-\ngraphic distance and later contact frequency. Thus, the\nstatistical techniques used in the research adjust for this joint\ndetermination of distance and contact.\nIn his landmark studies of families and aging, Litwak\nposition that \"there is a basic disharmony between modern\ndemocratic industrial society and extended family relations\"\nsons' structural-functional theoretical perspective, he con-\ntends that, due to the different needs of middle-class families\nand working-class families, different extended family struc-\ntures provide important functions in each social class. Speci-\nfically, Litwak (1960a) is concerned with how particular\nfamily structures help individuals balance the achievement\ndemands placed upon them by modern, industrial society\nwith the needs of their family members for social support.\nHe argues that this balance is best achieved among people in\nmiddle-class occupations and among those who are occupa-\ntionally mobile by the modified extended family, in which\nthere is greater geographic distance but fairly frequent con-\ntact between generations. The balance is best achieved\namong people in working-class occupations by the tradi-\ntional extended family, in which there is geographic proxim-\nity (or coresidence) and frequent contact between genera-\nThe modified extended family model, however, was for-\nmulated at a time when it was more commonly assumed that\nmiddle-class careers promised upward mobility, and that\nlong-term working-class jobs, while not universally avail-\nable (e.g., Komarovsky, 1967), could realistically be as-\npired to due to the presence of a strong industrial sector\nsustaining relatively stable working-class communities\nboth middle and working classes could thus expect to ad-\nvance their careers while accumulating sufficient resources\nto help their close kin in times of need. These expectations,\nhowever, may now be unrealistic, particularly among mem-\nbers of the working class. Accompanying deindustrializa-\ntion, decreases in unionization, and the decline of working-\nclass communities (Bluestone and Harrison, 1982), real\nwages have stagnated, especially among working-class men,\nfor over two decades (Wilkie, 1991). Employers have\nmoved away from offering jobs that promise lifetime careers\n(O'Rand, 1996). Divorce has increased, and continues to do\nso among those with low education levels (Bumpass and\nRaley, 1992). Education has become more expensive, but\nprovides a less certain route to job advancement (Rubin,\nThe modified extended family model may not adequately\naccount for these recent changes, or for their disproportion-\nate effects on the working class. Consequently, this study\nproposes an alternative, the changing family constraints\nmodel, which takes into account the cumulation of disadvan-\nbetter describe social class differences in the prospects for\nbalancing individual achievements with family support\nneeds over the life course. In describing these two models,\nwe conceptualize social class, based on Max Weber's (1972\n[1946]) work, as a set of positions, defined primarily by\neducation, occupation, and income, that shape people's\nchances for attainment and well-being over the life course\nOur analysis focuses on middle-aged children and their\nparents. Middle-aged people typically are at the peak of their\nwork careers, but are approaching a time of life when their\nprovision of care to both younger and older family members\nThus, they may have begun anticipating the need to adjust\ndistance from or contact frequency with their parents. Also,\nthose who are currently middle-aged are members of the baby\nboom cohort, and thus were exposed to recent changes in\nwork and family life in the early stages of their adult life\n(Wilkie, 1991). Consequently, their situation should provide\na good test of whether the modified extended family model or\nthe changing family constraints model best describes current\npatterns of distance and contact between generations.\nThe following sections lay out the implications of the\nmodified extended family and changing family constraints\nmodels in greater detail; first for distance, and then for\ncontact. These are summarized in two alternative sets of\nhypotheses. The relationship between distance and contact is\nthen examined in order to specify an analytic model appro-\npriate to test the hypotheses.\nGeographic Distance and Social Class\nSocioeconomic attainments and early plans for these at-\ntainments made by both parents and children are likely to be\nmajor influences on the geographic distance between genera-\ntions over the life course. When children reach early adult-\nhood, a primary goal of their leaving home is the pursuit of\nsocioeconomic attainment through education, work, and\nfamily formation; these are goals that parents also are likely\nto share. In addition, however, the theory of intergenera-\ntional solidarity (Bengtson and Roberts, 1991; Silverstein\nand Litwak, 1993) implies that geographic distance will be\nadjusted over time based on the changing needs and re-\nsources of both generations. In fact, recent studies find that\nadult children's economic needs have strong influences on\nproximity to, or coresidence with, parents earlier in the life\ncourse. Parents' economic and health needs, however, be-\ncome stronger influences on geographic proximity later in\nthe life course (Aquilino, 1990; Crimmins and Ingegneri,\nAccording to the modified extended family model, the\npursuit of individual attainment itself brings about the condi-\ntions needed to actualize this apparent reciprocity between\ngenerations over the life course (Litwak, 1985). The model,\nhowever, suggests that social class differences operate\nthrough the life course such that middle-class adult children\nwill live farther away from their parents than will those in\nthe working class (Litwak, 1960a). Training for highly\nskilled middle-class occupations typically involves a spe-\ncialized education, which may not be available near home,\nand requires several years to complete. Also, many middle-\nclass occupations are located in geographic-specific labor\nmarkets that may be far from parents' homes (Litwak,\n1985). Middle-class parents, however, typically are still\nworking, have earnings that continue to increase, and are in\ngood health until late in life (House et al., 1994; Oppen-\nmay thus have no need for their adult children to move closer\nto them until the children reach late middle adulthood. By\nthis time, the children's careers should be sufficiently estab-\nlished to allow for greater geographic mobility (in the form\nof lateral job changes) should parents' needs increase (Kulis,\nWorking-class occupations, by contrast, are assumed by\nthe modified extended family model to be available in the\nlocal community. Such jobs are often acquired through\nfriends and family members, and since they typically do not\nrequire a college education, are begun early in life\nConsequently, by the time they reach middle age, working-\nclass children will often have stable, well-paying jobs. The\nhealth of their parents, however, may begin to decline\nPreston and Taubman, 1994), suggesting that parents may\nneed a geographically proximate child's assistance. Indeed,\neven at later life-course stages, intergenerational proximity\nseems to be more common among those in lower social class\npositions than among those with more income or education\ncontrasting findings).\nIn contrast to this scenario, the changing family con-\nstraints model suggests that in both the middle and the\nworking class, it has become more difficult to accumulate\nthe career and financial resources that lead to control over\none's geographic location by middle age. In the middle\nclass, however, such changing family constraints may be\nadjusted to more easily than in the working class. The life-\nstyle practices of middle-class young adults, which include\nlate marriage and childbearing (Oppenheimer, 1981; U.S.\nBureau of the Census, 1991), facilitate the acquisition of\nadvanced education, which has become increasingly neces-\nsary for socioeconomic attainment in recent decades (Op-\npenheimer, 1981). Further, these life-style practices have\nhelped compensate for stagnating wages in the baby boom\ncohort (Easterlin, Macunovich, and Crimmins, 1993). Liv-\ning with parents for a longer period of time may also\nfacilitate the pursuit of advanced education, and does not\nunduly tax parents' relatively high resources (Avery, Gold-\nIn the working class, by contrast, there has been even\ngreater wage stagnation than in the more highly educated\nmiddle class (Wilkie, 1991). The greater prevalence of\nearlier marriage and childbearing in the working class (Op-\npenheimer, 1981) discourages educational attainment (Plot-\nnick, 1992); at the same time, there has been a decrease in\nhigh-wagejobs for people with less than a college education,\nparticularly those living in less affluent communities (Blue-\nworking-class parents may be less effective in finding stable\nlocal employment for their children than was the case 20 to\nchanging family constraints may cause working-class youth\nto settle for low-wage jobs in their communities; to remain in\nthe parental home where, in some cases, they may attempt to\npursue an expensive college education; or to seek a better-\npaying job in another locale. Apart from job constraints,\nrising real estate prices may eventually necessitate a more\ndistant move from parents than in the past (Rubin, 1994).\nSuch changes suggest that working-class adults will accu-\nmulate few resources by middle age (Rossides, 1990), and\nthus will find it difficult to move closer to parents when the\nneeds of the latter change. The changing family constraints\nmodel therefore suggests that there will not be a strong\nrelationship between social class and geographic distance\nfrom parents.\nIntergenerational Contact and Social Class\nFrequent intergenerational contact is closely linked with\nthe need for social support (Hogan, Eggebeen, and Clogg,\nmitments to family members, however, also appear to\nstrongly influence the frequency of contact between adult\nchildren and their parents, independently of social support\nneeds (Bengtson, Olander, and Haddad, 1976; Crimmins\nstein, Parrott, and Bengtson, 1995; Whitbeck, Hoyt, and\nHuck, 1994). In particular, gender, marital status, number\nof siblings, and number of children indicate stable family\nroles that reflect long-term commitments, and also affect\ncontact frequency (Bengtson, Rosenthal, and Burton, 1990;\nThe relative salience of needs, versus commitments, as\ndeterminants of contact depends partly on having sufficient\nresources to allow greater contact when desired, and also on\nlife-style characteristics (Litwak, 1960a). According to the\nmodified extended family model, technology such as the\ntelephone and rapid means of transportation allows frequent\nintergenerational contact, even at great geographic dis-\ntances. This suggests that middle-class adults, who live\nfarther away from parents but can afford to use this technol-\nogy, need not have less contact with parents than do\nworking-class adults. What more clearly differs between\nsocial classes, according to this model, is the type of in-\ntergenerational contact most often used.\nMiddle-class life styles usually involve considerable in-\nperson contact with friends and relatives other than immedi-\nate kin, which may substitute for in-person contact with\nLitwak, 1960a). Incumbency in middle-class occupations,\nhowever, typically requires a high standard of living (e.g.,\npurchase of a home). Thus, well into adulthood, middle-\nclass children may require transfers of money from their\nparents (e.g., a down payment on a home), which parents\ncan typically afford; children also may need emotional\nsupport during the early stages of a career (Litwak, 1960a).\nBoth transfers of money and emotional support are easily\narranged by telephone (Silverstein and Litwak, 1993).\nLater, when the income and health of aging middle-class\nparents begin to decline, they are more likely than those in\nthe working class to use purchased services or those pro-\nvided by friends and relatives other than their children\n(Litwak, 1985). Thus, the telephone may still be a means of\nfrequent contact with children at this life-course stage, but\ncontact will tend to be based more on parents' needs than it\npreviously was (Litwak, 1985). Both parents and children,\nhowever, will probably have sufficient resources at both of\nthese life-course stages so that long-term family roles and\ncommitments will influence contact independently of needs.\nIn contrast, because of their earlier move to independence\n(Oppenheimer, 1981), working-class young adults may not\nrequire the prolonged financial transfers from parents that\nthose in the middle class do. They may have other social\nsupport needs, however, such as child care that would\nfacilitate the employment of working-class wives. Working-\nclass adults, compared to those in the middle class, rely\nmore on close kin for such services (Krause and Borawski-\nto actualize long-term family commitments, working-class\nadult children may have frequent in-person contact with their\nparents. Frequent telephone contact may also be conducted,\npartly to arrange in-person visits.\nIn working-class occupations, earnings tend to reach their\npeak during middle age; after this time, however, income\nmay decline due to stagnating earnings or early retirement\n(Oppenheimer, 1981). Consequently, aging working-class\nparents may be more likely than middle-class parents to\nrequire frequent assistance with services that otherwise\nwould have to be purchased. Such assistance often requires\nin-person contact. Due to the close correspondence over the\nworking-class life course between earnings peaks in one\ngeneration and greater needs in the other, however, scarce\nresources are not likely to limit intergenerational communi-\ncation once children attain adulthood. Thus, as in the middle\nclass, long-term family roles and commitments should in-\nfluence contact independently of needs, despite the transi-\ntion over time from children's to parents' needs as determi-\nnants of contact.\nThe changingfamily constraints model, in contrast to the\nabove scenario, suggests that in both social classes, limited\nresources and changing life styles will increase the effects of\nneeds compared to commitments, and the effects of middle-\naged children's needs compared to parents', on intergenera-\ntional contact frequency. Again, however, these constraints\nmay be more easily adjusted to in the middle than in the\nworking class. Indeed, there has been considerable financial\nsuccess in the upper socioeconomic strata of the baby boom\ncohort (Easterlin, Macunovich, and Crimmins, 1993). It is,\nhowever, likely that the careers of many middle-class baby\nboomers have gotten off to slow starts due to stagnating\nwages and the decreasing availability of stable jobs (Mar-\ncohort may also delay financial independence (DaVanzo and\nGoldscheider, 1990). Consequently, even in middle age,\nchildren's needs may still prevail as determinants of in-\ntergenerational contact.\nNevertheless, contact may still be frequent, especially\nsince middle-class adult children and their parents are not\nlikely to have substantial conflicts over life-style differ-\nences. It seems evident that changes in family and gender-\nrole attitudes have occurred since the 1960s (Bane and\nrelate to life-style issues on which middle-class parents and\ntheir children may not clearly disagree (Gordon, 1978;\nIn the working class, deferral of careers among young\nadults means that they may not have reached the peak of their\nearnings by the time the needs of their aging parents begin to\nincrease. Also, unlike in the middle class, delayed careers\nwill probably not lead to post-middle-aged prosperity; in-\ndeed, income inequality is greater in the baby boom cohort\nthan in their parents' cohort (Easterlin, Macunovich, and\nCrimmins, 1993). Additionally, if working-class children\nlive farther from their parents than in the past, they may have\nless frequent in-person and telephone contact with them\nWhen contact does occur, it is likely to result from children's\nneeds as much as from parents' needs. Divorce, for instance,\nis likely to increase children's needs, and while it has\nstabilized in the middle class, divorce continues to increase\namong those with low education levels (Bumpass and Raley,\nThe resources that parents can make available to children\nare less plentiful in the working class than in the middle\nclass, however. Moreover, the changes in family life styles\nand values that have occurred in the past 30 years may create\nconflict between middle-aged children and their parents in\nthe working class, since family values tend to be more\ntraditional in this social class than in the middle class (Kulis,\nover life-style differences may thus reduce the frequency of\nintergenerational contact in the working class, relative to\nthat in the middle class.\nHypotheses\nThe previous discussion of the modified extended family\nmodel implies that, despite different means to individual\nachievement and needs for family support in the middle and\nworking classes, families in both social classes will be able to\nattain sufficient resources over the life course to fulfill long-\nstanding commitments to their adult children and parents.\nBased on that model, we propose the following hypotheses:\n(la) Middle-class children will, in middle age, live far-\nther away from their parents than those in the working class,\nand will have less frequent in-person contact with them,\nthough they will have a similar level of telephone contact.\nThese relationships will be found with both early and current\nmeasures of social class, and measures of both parents' and\nchildren's social class.\n(lb) Among middle-aged children, geographic proximity\nand contact frequency with parents will be positively in-\nfluenced by both parents' and children's needs, indepen-\ndently of the effect of distance on contact. Long-term family\nroles and commitments will also be significant determinants\nof contact.\nThe changingfamily constraints model, by contrast, em-\nphasizes changes in work and family life in the past two to\nthree decades that appear to have disproportionately affected\nthe working class. Based on this model, we propose the\nfollowing alternative hypotheses:\n(2a) Social class will be unrelated to geographic distance\nor in-person contact frequency between middle-aged chil-\ndren and their parents. Telephone contact will be more\nfrequent in the middle than in the working class.\n(2b) Geographic proximity and both forms of contact\nfrequency will be positively influenced more by children's\nthan by parents' needs, and contact will be less strongly\nrelated to long-term family roles and commitments than to\nneeds. These relationships will be found with both early and\ncurrent measures of social class, and measures of parents'\nand children's social class.\nThe Relationship Between Geographic Distance\nand Contact Frequency\nThe previous discussion has assumed that geographic\ndistance between generations results, in large part, from\nlong-term plans for socioeconomic attainment, which are\nnevertheless sanctioned by long-term intergenerational com-\nmitments. This assumption is generally supported by pre-\nvious findings on migrants within the U.S. (Litwak, 1960b;\nTilly and Brown, 1967); by evidence from other societies\nsuggesting that migration decisions are based on plans for\nlong-term exchanges between parents and adult children\n(Stark and Lucas, 1988); and by literature on adaptive family\nstrategies (Moen and Wethington, 1992; Oppenheimer,\n1981). Plans for socioeconomic attainment, however, are\nnot likely to directly affect frequency of contact at a later\npoint in time. Rather, this relationship is likely to be indi-\nrect, occurring through the effects of distance on contact.\nContact, instead, appears to be more directly affected than is\ndistance by long-term family roles and commitments (Crim-\nmins and Ingegneri, 1990), which are likely to manifest\nthemselves when future needs arise.\nThese assumptions imply that early social class and early\nfamily commitments are important influences on later geo-\ngraphic distance and contact frequency between generations.\nGenerally, however, these early factors have not been taken\ninto account previously by researchers. Rather, based on the\nincrease in the temporal and monetary costs of contact\naccompanying greater geographic distance, researchers have\nassumed that distance is determined prior to and indepen-\ndently of contact, and hence, that distance is an exogenous\ndeterminant of contact (DeWit, Wister, and Burch, 1988;\nEmpirical findings based on this assumption of exogeneity\nconsistently show that geographic distance is one of the\nstrongest predictors of in-person or telephone contact. Find-\nings on the relationship between social class and contact are\nnot as consistent, however. Some researchers find that\nmiddle-class individuals -- those with more education or\nhigher income -- have less frequent intergenerational con-\ntact than others (Crimmins and Ingegneri, 1990; Lawton,\nOther researchers find the opposite (Kivett and Atkinson,\n1992). Still others find that the relationship between income\nand geographic distance accounts entirely for that between\nincome and contact (DeWit, Wister, and Burch, 1988;\nFrankel and DeWit, 1989). The discrepancies among these\nfindings may be partly due to the use of measures that do not\ndistinguish in-person from telephone contact (e.g., Kivett\nthese discrepancies, and the strength of the estimated effect\nof distance on contact, may also be partly due to the assump-\ntion that distance is exogenous to contact.\nIn contrast to this assumption, our argument that early\nsocial class and long-term commitments affect both distance\nand contact implies that distance and contact are endoge-\nnous, as suggested by Wolf (1994). Such endogeneity would\nproduce a correlation between the error terms of the separate\nmodels used to predict distance and contact, and thus may\nbias the estimated coefficients. In a regression model, bias\ndue to endogeneity is likely, at minimum, to inflate the\nestimated effect of distance on contact; it may also affect the\nsizes of other estimated effects in the model. Consequently,\nin the analyses reported below, we use statistical techniques\nthat adjust for the possibility of endogeneity bias.\nMETHODS\nSample\nThe data analyzed are from the University of Southern\nCalifornia Longitudinal Study of Generations and Mental\nHealth (LSOG). LSOG sample members were selected ran-\nfornia health maintenance organization, had a living child,\nand had a grandchild between ages 16 and 26 (Bengtson,\nthan 300 families, members of all three generations re-\nsponded, producing a baseline sample of 2,044 individuals.\n1994. The sample overrepresents White middle- and\nworking-class people in the Los Angeles area (Silverstein\nand Bengtson, 1991) and their descendants, partly because\nmany of the grandfathers were enrolled in the health plan as\nThe sample for analysis is restricted in four ways. First,\nwe analyze only non-coresident parent and child dyads (the\nchildren [G2s] and grandchildren [G3s] of the original sam-\nple members) in order to focus exclusively on middle-aged\nchildren and their parents who do not share households.\nSecond, in accord with the longitudinal analyses, the sample\nand who, at both of these time points, were \"study chil-\ndren\" -- the first child in each family to complete the 1971\nsurvey, and the referent of the parent's responses. Third, to\nminimize the effects of unobserved, family-specific factors,\none parent per child is randomly chosen to form a single\ndyad for each family. Parents who are siblings, however, are\nincluded along with their study children who are first cous-\nins. Fourth, individuals are excluded from the analyses when\nthey have missing values on the dependent variables. These\nrestrictions produce a sample of 161 parent-child dyads.\nMeasures\nWe describe in this section the variables that were initially\nincluded in the analytic models. However, due to sample\nsize limitations, we retain only the most substantively im-\nportant or significant variables in the final models. These are\npresented in Table 1; procedures used to select variables for\nthe final models are described below.\nDependent variables: geographic distance and contact\nfrequency. -- Measures of distance are dichotomized to\nindicate whether adult children and parents live more than\n50 miles apart. This distance roughly corresponds to an\nhour of transportation time, which is a commonly used\nthis distance, frequent visits are possible without requiring\nan overnight stay; thus, 50 miles may represent a threshold\n(Frankel and DeWit, 1989) beyond which frequent contact\nbegins to become prohibitively costly. Since contact is\nmeasured only at the ordinal level in the LSOG, measures\nTable 1.

Dichotomizing\ndistance and contact measures minimizes the effects of\nextreme values, which can distort results, and also produces\ncategories with fairly evenly-split numbers of cases, keep-\ning cell sizes relatively high.\nSocial class and economic resources. -- Following\nindicator of middle-aged children's current social class posi-\ntion. If either children or their spouses are in a blue-collar or\nservice occupation, they are categorized as being from a\nworking-class family; all others are categorized as middle\nclass. Included in the middle-class category are a very few\ncases where neither spouse reported an occupation; forming\na separate category from these cases did not change the\nresults. Also initially included was an analogous measure of\nfather's occupation when the child was a teenager, in which\nthe few farmers were classified as working-class individuals.\nToo few parents were working in 1991 to include a measure\nof their current occupation.\nIncome is another indicator of social class position, espe-\ncially for retired parents, but also represents an economic\nresource that strongly constrains changes in distance and\ncontact frequency. Dichotomous measures of family income\nare used. These represent families having less than $13,000\n1984 dollars). These categories were chosen partly to obtain\nadequate cell sizes; trichotomies were initially used, but\ntheir use did not change the results.\nEducation is a third measure of social class, which also\nindicates economic and social resources. We initially used\nseveral measures of education in each generation, but re-\ntained only children's 1971 reports of their fathers' educa-\ntion (dichotomized to indicate having more than a high\nschool education). Additionally, we included a measure of\nchildren's 1971 educational aspirations, dichotomized to\nindicate aspiring to less than a college education; when\nchildren reported having finished school by 1971, their\neducational aspirations were coded as the level of education\nthey had completed. Adolescents' educational aspirations\nhelp to explain major life-course decisions (Plotnick, 1992),\nand may also reflect family members' consensus about the\naffordability and necessity of children's occupational and\nFamily roles and commitments. -- We included several\nmeasures of parents' and children's family roles in initial\nmodels: gender; marital status; previous experience of di-\nvorce; number of children; whether children lived with\nparents year-round in 1971 (this would have determined\ngeographic distance and influenced contact frequency at that\ntime); whether children lived in Southern California (i.e.,\nnear grandparents) in 1971; and whether an older extended\nfamily member lived with parents' or children's families\nwhen they were growing up. We selectively included three\nmeasures of family commitments: children's measures of\n1971 affectual and normative solidarity (Bengtson and\nRoberts, 1991); and whether children identified themselves\nNoneconomic needs and resources. -- Three measures of\nhealth needs were initially used: self-reported health com-\npared to others one's age; number of chronic conditions; and\nage in years. A strong ethnic identification may also encour-\nage proximity to parents (Angel and Tienda, 1982; Litwak,\naccess to institutional resources. The ethnicity measure indi-\ncates whether respondents identified themselves as White in\nData Analysis\nTo analyze distance and contact, we estimate simultane-\nous probit models with LIMDEP Version 6.0 (Greene,\n1992). Simultaneous probit is a dichotomous dependent\nvariable analogue to two-stage least squares. This technique\nis appropriate given our assumption that long-term family\nplans, based on both social class and family commitments,\njointly determine distance and contact. Specifically, because\nfamily plans are not directly measured, we assume that the\nerror terms of the models for distance and contact are\ncorrelated; this necessitates their simultaneous estimation\n298). Because we assume that, when measured at the same\npoint in time, distance affects contact but not the reverse, we\nuse a recursive model, rather than a nonrecursive one in\nwhich contact would also cause distance.\nIn the first stage of this two-stage technique, a reduced\nform model is estimated in order to construct predicted\nvalues of distance. These are independent of the error terms\nin both the distance and contact models, and therefore can be\nincluded in the second-stage model of contact without risk of\nendogeneity bias. The standard errors of the second-stage\nestimates are adjusted using the procedure described by\nTo identify the model of contact, we include in the model\nreport of their father's education. These indicate, respec-\ntively, children's plans for socioeconomic attainment, and\nparents' plans for their own and their children's attainments.\nThese variables are assumed to directly affect later distance\nfrom parents, but only to affect later contact frequency\nindirectly, through their effects on distance.\nSample means are substituted for missing values on ex-\nplanatory variables. Because of sample size limitations,\ninitial specifications included only incomes of both genera-\ntions and educational aspirations in the model of distance;\nand incomes and predicted distance in the model of contact.\nControl variables were included in final models only if they\napproached statistical significance when added, one by one,\nto these minimal models, and either remained near statistical\nsignificance once other variables were included or were\nsubstantively important. To assess whether long-term family\ncommitments accounted for any social class effects we\nobserved, measures of affectual and normative solidarity\nwere added, one at a time, only to final models.\nSample selection biases. -- To account for possible biases\ndue to attrition and to the method of selecting the longitudi-\nnal analysis sample, models adjusting for the effects on\ndistance and contact of selection into the sample are esti-\nmated. Previous studies have found that retention in longitu-\ndinal surveys is related to higher socioeconomic status and to\nhaving greater family commitment may affect retention, as\nmight the fact that multiple households in the same families\nare surveyed (Lillard, 1989, discusses an analogous effect\namong members of the same household).\nTo analyze the determinants of selection into the analysis\nsample, we randomly chose one child from every family that\ndid not get included in the analysis sample, but did have a\nresulting in a total of 446 children in the selection analysis\nwhen combined with the 161 in the analysis sample. Of these\n285 children, 29% refused to participate sometime between\nwere incapacitated, or were dropped due to an inadequate\nfamily response pattern; and 32% participated. The partici-\npants presumably either were not study children, or could\nnot be matched with a participating parent.\nBivariate probit models are used to analyze selection into\nthe analysis sample. This technique is a dichotomous depen-\ndent variable analogue to seemingly unrelated regression. It\nis used when there is no joint determination of two outcomes\n(e.g., selection does not cause distance in 1991, nor does\ndistance cause selection), but there are common unobserved\ncauses of both outcomes that produce a correlation in resid-\nuals of the two models predicting them. The technique can\nbe used to determine whether analyses of distance or contact\nare affected by the nonrandom selection of observations\nThe predictors of distance and contact are identical to\nthose used in the simultaneous probit models, except the\ncontact models do not control for distance. This is because\nthe analysis of a simultaneous probit within a bivariate probit\nmodel would entail dubious statistical assumptions (William\nselection models of contact that do not control for distance\nare subject to omitted variable bias, they do provide some\nindication of how much the size and significance of coef-\nficients are likely to change due to selection effects.\nThe intergenerational stake bias. -- Bengtson and Kuy-\npers (1971) suggested that parents have more of a stake than\ndo their children in believing that they are emotionally close\nto each other. This reasoning may also apply to geographic\ndistance and contact, which are also forms of closeness\nbetween generations. Accordingly, parents' and children's\nreports of distance and contact, and the models predicting\nthese, may differ according to their different experiences and\ninvestments in their mutual relationship. Therefore, we\nanalyze both parents' and children's reports of distance and\ncontact. Our primary substantive interest, however, is in\nparents' perceptions of the availability of children to them.\nRESULTS\nTable 1 provides information on mean levels of geo-\ngraphic distance and contact between the middle-aged chil-\ndren and parents in our sample. Consistent with the in-\ntergenerational stake hypothesis (Bengtson and Kuypers,\nperceive more contact with their children than the children\ndo with them. While 28 percent of the parents report weekly\nin-person contact, only 18 percent of the children do; 53\npercent of the parents report weekly telephone contact,\ncompared to only 42 percent of the children. Both of these\ndifferences are statistically significant (p < .05).\nTo further elaborate the descriptive findings, tabulations\nshowing the interrelations between social class, distance or\ncontact, and gender are briefly discussed (not shown). These\nindicate that working-class adult children are more likely to\nlive within 50 miles of their parents (p < .10) and to have in-\nperson contact with parents at least weekly (p < .10) than are\nthose in the middle class. There is no significant social class\ndifference in the frequency of telephone contact. In the\nbivariate tabulations, women are more likely than men to\nengage in weekly in-person contact with their parents (p <\n.05), but there are no significant gender differences in either\ngeographic distance or telephone contact. These findings all\nare consistent with the modified extended family hypothesis.\nIt should be noted that there is greater geographic distance\nbetween generations in the LSOG analysis sample than in\nnationally representative data. While 56 percent of the adult\nchildren in our sample live more than 50 miles from their\nparents, only about 40 percent of adult children in a nation-\nally representative sample live more than an hour from their\nparents (Lawton, Silverstein, and Bengtson, 1994), which is\na roughly comparable distance. Findings from the National\nSurvey of Families and Households show that adult children\nlive about 35 miles, on average, from their parents (the\nantilog of the mean natural log reported by Hogan, Egge-\nbeen, and Clogg, 1993), while in our analysis sample, the\ncomparable figure is about 70 miles. It should also be noted\nthat, consistent with these greater distances, the intergenera-\ntional dyads in our sample appear to have somewhat less\ncontact than in other studies; 56 percent of the parents\nreported any type of contact weekly, compared to 69 percent\nin a nationally representative sample (Lawton, Silverstein,\nMultivariate Analyses of Geographic Distance\nand Contact\nThis section reports results of multivariate analyses that\ntest the modified extended family hypotheses (la and lb)\nagainst the alternative changing family constraints hypothe-\nses (2a and 2b). Models include measures of early social\nclass position, current social class position, and family roles\nand commitments; initial models included measures of both\nparents' and children's needs. Due to sample size limita-\ntions, the final models contain only statistically significant or\nsubstantively important variables; other findings, not shown,\nare discussed when they are relevant to the hypotheses.\nGeographic distance and in-person contact. -- The modi-\nfied extended family model predicts that working-class,\nmiddle-aged children and their parents will live closer to\neach other and have more frequent in-person contact than\nthose in the middle class (hypothesis la). Table 2 shows that\nthis hypothesis is supported, but only by the effects of early\nsocial class measures. The analysis of distance (Model 1 in\nTable 2) shows that middle-aged children who, in 1971, had\nlower educational aspirations and less highly educated fa-\nthers lived closer to their parents in 1991 than did others.\nThese findings indicate that the linkage between early plans\nfor attainment and later distance from parents not only\nendures over time, but also appears to be stronger than the\nlinkage between current attainments and distance. While\nModel 1 shows that adult children currently in the working\nclass live closer to their parents than those in the middle\nclass, this finding is not statistically significant. Parent's\nprevious occupation also is not significant in this model (not\nshown).\nThough unanticipated, the dominance of early, compared\nto later, social class effects on distance is consistent with the\nmodified extended family hypothesis. The dominance of\nthese effects may suggest that, despite changing family\nconstraints, early plans for attainment have been carried out\nwhile also taking into account the needs of other family\nmembers. Moreover, to the extent that early educational\naspirations proxy for later occupational mobility, their ef-\nfects on distance are entirely consistent with the modified\nEarly social class effects are also revealed by Model 2 of\nTable 2, which shows that parents who had lower income in\n1971 have more frequent in-person contact with middle-\naged children in 1991 than did those who had higher income.\nThis finding implies that early parental disadvantage affects\nlater contact with children independently of plans for attain-\nment. Thus, this finding also supports the modified extended\nfamily hypothesis (la).\nHypothesis lb states that long-term family commitments\nwill affect distance and contact independently of social class\nposition, as will both parents' and children's needs when\nchildren are middle-aged. Some support for this hypothesis\nis found in Model 2 of Table 2. When parents have a greater\nnumber of children, the children in the analysis sample are\nless likely to be in frequent contact with them (p < . 10). This\nimplies that adult siblings coordinate their in-person contacts\nto ensure that parents have potential support available\nWomen are also more likely to be in frequent in-person\ncontact with their parents, suggesting some influence of a\nkin-keeping role (Bengtson, Rosenthal, and Burton, 1990;\nKomarovsky, 1967). Controlling for the child's marital\nstatus does not change this finding (data not shown), as\nresearch on coresidence suggests that it might (Crimmins\nhypothesis lb, however, neither parents' nor children's\nnoneconomic needs affect distance or in-person contact (not\nshown).\nAs expected, early plans for socioeconomic attainment\nappear to have no direct effects on later in-person contact,\nbut may have indirect effects through distance. Distance is\nstrongly and negatively related to in-person contact, even\nafter the endogeneity of distance and contact is accounted for\nTable 2.

But the size of the estimated effect of\ndistance, although the largest among all the variables in the\nmodel, is only about one-third of what it is in the model\nwithout the adjustment for endogeneity (not shown). More-\nover, compared to this model, the estimated effects of other\nvariables in Model 2 of Table 2 are generally smaller and\nhave different significance levels. These findings imply that\nit is essential to jointly analyze in-person contact with\ngeographic distance if its relationships with other factors are\nto be accurately estimated.\nIn contrast to the findings discussed thus far, the models\ndisplayed in Table 2 also provide support for the changing\nfamily constraints hypothesis (2a). Based on the assumption\nthat working-class people will have difficulty maintaining\ngeographic proximity between generations, this hypothesis\npredicts that geographic distance and in-person contact will\nbe unrelated to social class. The findings, however, provide\neven stronger support for this hypothesis. Parents with low\nincome in 1991 report living farther away from their chil-\ndren than those with higher income. This finding could\nrepresent an effect of children moving far from home due to\njob constraints or rising real estate prices (particularly\namong Southern California residents [Rubin, 1994], who are\ndisproportionately represented in this sample); alternatively,\nit may represent the effect of parents moving to areas with\nlow costs of living (DeJong et al., 1995), where there are\nfew jobs available to their adult children. The finding never-\ntheless suggests that parents in the greatest financial need\nmay have the least-available children.\nThe several effects of long-term family roles on in-person\ncontact, discussed previously, contravene the changing fam-\nily constraints hypothesis (2b). This hypothesis, however,\nalso predicts that parents' needs will be less important than\nthose of children in determining distance and in-person\ncontact. Thus, it is consistent with hypothesis 2b that par-\nents' noneconomic needs have no significant effects on in-\nperson contact or distance, despite the fact that children's\nneeds also have no such effects (not shown).\nGeographic distance and telephone contact. -- The mod-\nified extended family hypothesis (la) predicts that there\nwill be no social class difference in the frequency of tele-\nphone contact, whereas the changing family constraints\nhypothesis (2a) predicts that this form of contact will be\nmore frequent in the middle than in the working class. The\nfindings for telephone contact in Model 2 of Table 3 provide\nunexpectedly strong support for hypothesis la. Working-\nclass children are more likely than middle-class children to\nbe in weekly telephone contact with their parents (p < .10).\nThe difference of 16 percentage points between social\nclasses in the predicted probability of frequent telephone\ncontact indicates that resource limitations and life-style con-\nflicts have not discouraged frequent parental telephone con-\ntact with working-class children. This effect does not appear\nto be due to children's economic needs, since their income is\ncontrolled in the model. It thus may represent effects of\nfamily commitments specific to the working class. Indeed,\nwhen a measure of the child's 1971 affectual solidarity with\nthe mother is added to this model, the effect of being in a\nworking-class family drops from .48 to .41 and becomes in-\nTable 3.

This is consistent with the findings\nof Kulis (1991) that working-class adult children express\nunqualified affection for their parents more frequently than\nthose in the middle class, and also have more frequent\ntelephone contact with them.\nFurther support is provided for the modified extended\nfamily hypothesis (lb) by findings indicating that family\nroles and commitments affect contact more than do needs.\nMothers are more likely than fathers to report having weekly\ntelephone contact with their children, suggesting effects of a\nkin-keeper role that is more often found among women\n(Bengtson, Rosenthal, and Burton, 1990; Komarovsky,\nalso more likely than others to have weekly telephone\ncontact. This may be an effect of family commitment;\nalternatively, however, Catholicism in urban areas may also\npredict more general social involvement (Fischer, 1982).\nAdditionally, parents with more children have less frequent\nweekly telephone contact with the child in the sample than\ndo those with fewer children. This, like the similar finding\nfor in-person contact, suggests a division of labor among\nseveral children in keeping contact with parents. Though\nneither parents' nor children's noneconomic needs signifi-\ncantly predict telephone contact, the estimated effect of\nparent's age is positive, in keeping with hypothesis lb.\nConsistent with the modified extended family hypothesis\n(la), telephone contact is not affected by distance, suggest-\ning that the greater costs imposed by greater distance are not\nprohibitive of such contact. Without adjusting for endoge-\nneity, the effect of distance on telephone contact is far larger\nand highly significant (not shown), which would be consist-\nent with the changing family constraints hypothesis. Adjust-\ning for endogeneity also changes several other estimated\neffects in this model and their significance levels.\nSupport for the changing family constraints hypothesis\n(2a), however, is also provided by Table 3. Parents with\nlower 1991 income report less frequent telephone contact\nwith their children than do those with higher income (p <\n.10). This finding implies that parents with greater economic\nneeds do not have frequent telephone contact with their adult\nchild, suggesting that such parents may not be receiving\nneeded social support. The fact that there are few discernible\neffects, and no significant effects, of parents' noneconomic\nneeds on telephone contact provides further support for this\ninterpretation.\nAnalyses of potential bias: selection into the sample and\nchildren's reports. -- We thought it necessary to test for\nseveral sources of potential bias in the analyses. First, we\nexamined whether nonrandom selection into the analysis\nsample affected the analyses of geographic distance and each\ntype of contact. The selection analyses (which are available\nupon request) were based upon the 161 dyads in the analysis\nsample plus 285 additional cases that were excluded from\nthis sample, as previously discussed. It is important to note\nthat the sample selection model has significant predictors\nthat identify the models of distance and contact; this purpose\nis served in the model of distance by the variable indicating\nCatholicism, and in both models of contact by the variable\nindicating having had a highly educated father. This gives us\nconfidence that the models adequately represent the effects\nof selection. Due to statistical considerations noted above,\ndistance is not included in the selection models of contact.\nWhen the model of distance is adjusted for selection, the\neffects of being White and father's education are reduced to\ninsignificance, and the effects of parents' 1991 income and\neducational aspirations become less significant. The correla-\ntion between the unobserved predictors of distance and\nselection (-.50), however, is insignificant. This implies that\nno unobserved factors significantly relate selection to dis-\nThe unobserved factors predicting selection are, by con-\ntrast, significantly correlated with those affecting both types\nof contact. For in-person contact, this correlation is .98 and\nis significant at/? < .001. This positive correlation could, for\nexample, indicate having greater commitments to one's\nfamily, which might increase the chances both of participat-\ning in the survey and of having more frequent in-person\ncontact with parents. Geographic proximity, not included in\nthis model, might have similar effects. Despite the signifi-\ncant correlation, however, other estimated effects in this\nmodel are not changed a great deal by adjusting for selec-\ntion. Generally, the sizes of the effects are smaller, and their\nsignificance levels differ slightly from those of the model not\nadjusted for selection.\nThe correlation between the unobserved predictors of\ntelephone contact is -.74 and is significant at p < .05.\nFactors such as unobserved needs that are communicated by\ntelephone but also constrain participation in the study may\nlead to this negative correlation. Adjusting for selection has\na greater impact on the model of telephone contact than on\nthat of in-person contact. The estimated effects of all varia-\nbles are reduced, in some cases, by about a third of their\noriginal size. The effects of parent's 1991 income, and of\nbeing Catholic, no longer significantly predict telephone\ncontact in this model; also, the significance-of the effect of\nchildren's working-class status is reduced.\nA second possible source of bias is the inclusion in the\nanalysis sample only of children who were selected as\n\"study children.\" These children were the first to return\ntheir 1971 questionnaires. Since more rapid response may\nindicate greater family commitments, we conducted f-tests\nof several indicators of family roles and commitments,\ncomparing these children with others. There were no signifi-\ncant differences between the two groups of children in these\nanalyses.\nThird, we examined possible biases resulting from the use\nof parents', rather than children's, reports of distance and\ncontact; as Table 1 indicates, children report less frequent\ncontact with their parents than parents do with those same\nchildren (the intergenerational stake phenomenon). Speci-\nfically, we estimated models of children's reports of distance\nand contact using the same variables as those in the models\nof parents' reports. Findings from these analyses show that\nthe predictors of children's reports do not differ markedly\nfrom those of parents' reports (analyses are available upon\nrequest). The findings for geographic distance change only\nslightly when children's reports are analyzed. In the analysis\nof in-person contact reported by children, the effect of\ngender becomes insignificant and much smaller than in the\nanalysis of parents' reports. Other estimates change only\nslightly in significance level; these changes do not affect our\nsubstantive conclusions. In the analysis of telephone contact\nreported by children, however, the negative effect of dis-\ntance increases to--.493 and becomes significant (p < .05).\nThe effects of being in a working-class family, of having\nparents with low income, of being Catholic, and of number\nof siblings become less significant or insignificant. These\nfindings suggest that the cost constraints of distance become\nmore salient in children's perceptions of contact, and that\nthese constraints account for the effects of current social\nclass position, and of family roles and commitments, on\ntelephone contact.\nIn sum, accounting for possible biases produces very few\nchanges in the results. When selection is accounted for, the\neffects of early social class on distance become somewhat\nless pronounced, and the effect of parents' 1991 income on\ntelephone contact becomes insignificant. When children's\nreports of distance and contact are analyzed, gender no\nlonger has a significant effect on in-person contact, and the\neffect of distance on telephone contact becomes significant\nwhile the effects of social class on telephone contact become\ninsignificant.\nDISCUSSION\nIn his landmark research, Litwak (1960a) predicted that\nthe modified extended family, typified by relatively great\ndistance but fairly frequent contact between adult children\nand their aging parents, would continue to be the dominant\nmodel for middle-class and occupationally mobile individ-\nuals in the U.S. He also argued that the traditional extended\nfamily, typified by close geographic proximity and frequent\ncontact between generations, was more characteristic of the\nworking class. This research investigated whether such so-\ncial class differences in distance and contact between\nmiddle-aged children and their parents persisted between\nchanged in response to social-structural changes in work and\nfamily life during that period.\nThe Modified Extended Family Model\nThe findings provide considerable support for the mod-\nified extended family model, but only when the effects of\nearly, rather than current, measures of social class are\nconsidered. In particular, middle-aged children who, in\n1991, lived at a greater geographic distance from parents or\nhad less frequent in-person contact with them were more\nlikely than others to have had parents with higher education\neducational aspirations. These results also provide strong\nempirical support for the assumption that early plans for\nsocioeconomic attainment have enduring direct effects on\ngeographic distance between adult children and their par-\nents, but only affect contact indirectly.\nAlso consistent with the modified extended family hy-\npotheses are findings suggesting that enduring family roles\nand commitments (represented by being female, number of\nchildren, Catholicism, and early affectual solidarity with\none's mother) affect both in-person and telephone contact\nbetween adult generations. These results show that needs are\nnot the sole determinants of contact with parents. Yet, by the\nsame token, they also suggest that those who had weaker\nintergenerational solidarity or weaker family commitments\n20 years earlier may have trouble obtaining social support as\ntheir needs increase with age. Such an inference is supported\nby other recent studies (Cooney and Uhlenberg, 1990;\nSilverstein, Parrott, and Bengtson, 1995; Whitbeck, Hoyt,\nThe Changing Family Constraints Model\nThe changing family constraints model predicts that inten-\ntions to adjust intergenerational distance and contact have\nbeen constrained by increased economic instability and fam-\nily disruption, particularly among middle-aged children in\nthe working class. Support for this hypothesis is provided\nprimarily by findings for parents' current, rather than past,\nmeasures of social class and needs. Parents with low in-\ncomes in 1991 live farther away from their middle-aged\nchildren than those with higher incomes, and also have less\ntelephone contact with them (though the latter finding may\nbe an artifact of sample selection). Furthermore, middle-\naged children's current social class position is not signifi-\ncantly related to their distance from their parents.\nThese findings indicate that the potential for social support\namong aging parents represented by close geographic prox-\nimity and frequent telephone contact is limited by their low\nincome. The findings may represent the effects of a decline\nin the availability of stable working-class jobs in less affluent\na greater availability of such jobs would have better enabled\nthe children of lower-income parents to live close to them.\nThe findings may also reflect the inability of parents to reside\nin higher cost-of-living areas where their children are work-\ning (DeJong et al., 1995). Both of these interpretations\nimply that parents with greater financial needs may not\nreceive needed social support. A possible alternative inter-\npretation, however, is that more affluent parents are more\nable to \"purchase\" proximity to and contact with their\nchildren (Bernheim, Shleifer, and Summers, 1985). Indeed,\nsince the average age of the parents in this sample is less than\n65 years, many of them may not have disabling conditions\nrequiring children's geographic proximity.\nOverall, the findings support Wolf's (1994) contention\nthat distance and contact between adult generations are\njointly determined. Adjusting for this endogeneity has im-\nportant substantive implications. Without the adjustment for\njoint determination, the findings for telephone contact re-\nported by parents would support the changing family con-\nstraints hypothesis; with the adjustment, they support the\nmodified extended family hypothesis. Most research on\ndistance and contact has not included measures of early\nsocial class position or early aspirations, and therefore may\nerroneously attribute a portion of the effects of early social\nclass to a family's current social class position or to distance\nitself. Separating earlier from later effects of social class\nmay be especially important during a period of history when\nsubstantial changes in family economic support have oc-\nThree potential limitations to these findings should be\nnoted. First, the conceptualization of social class used in this\nresearch emphasizes distinctions between the middle and\nworking classes, and emphasizes the effects of occupational\nmobility. Some scholars, however, argue that a simple blue-\ncollar/white-collar dichotomy does not adequately reflect\nsocial class differences (Hout, Brooks, and Manza, 1995).\nOthers argue that social class position is relatively perma-\nnent in U.S. society; this argument has special relevance to\nthe life-course perspective. Substantial occupational mobil-\nity, for instance, is entirely \"compatible with a high rate of\nascriptive transmission of class position from one generation\noccupation measures used in this research are transitory; the\neducation measures, while relatively stable, do not fully\nreflect the enduring and cumulative effects of social class.\nSecond, our results are based on a sample that, while unique\nin its longitudinal assessment of family solidarity among\nseveral generations, overrepresents White, middle- and\nworking-class families, and families with members in Los\nAngeles, compared to the national population. Because it\nwas drawn from the 1971 membership of a health mainte-\nnance organization, the sample excludes the very wealthy\nand very poor; thus, the findings may understate the relation-\nship of social class to geographic distance and contact. Very\npoor adult children and parents probably would live closer to\neach other than do the relatively economically stable fami-\nlies in this sample. Additionally, geographic distance be-\ntween generations in this research is greater than in research\nbased on nationally representative samples, also implying\nthat we are not observing the full range of the interrelations\nbetween social class, distance, and contact. Third, the sam-\nple originally was selected from grandparents in a very\nlimited range of occupations -- those, for instance, whose\nmembers had employer-provided health maintenance orga-\nnization coverage in 1971. It is possible that this concentra-\ntion in specific occupations resulted in intergenerational\ncorrelations of specific factors, such as attitudes toward\neducational attainment or toward family contact, that might\naffect the interrelations between social class, geographic\ndistance, and contact frequency.\nDespite these potential limitations, the findings provide\nnew information about the effects of social class on adult\nintergenerational relationships over time. In particular, the\nfindings suggest the value of further research in this area\nusing alternative conceptualizations of social class, and of\nfurther assessment of the adaptive strategies provided by\ndifferent intergenerational family structures. Additionally,\nthe two conceptual models examined here are amenable to\ntesting by other researchers using larger and nationally\nrepresentative samples.\nIn conclusion, our results show that social class position\nand early aspirations affect geographic distance and contact\nfrequency between adult children and their parents over 20\nyears. The effects of early factors are consistent with the\nmodified extended family hypothesis. The effects of parents'\ncurrent social class position, however, tell a different story.\nParents who currently have great financial needs may have\nlittle proximity to or contact with their middle-aged children.\nThese complex effects of social class suggest the need for\ngreater understanding of how cumulative stratification\n(O'Rand, 1996) takes place, and what its effects are on the\nadequacy of social support systems among the elderly.\n"
