Sub-national governing bodies use the freedom\ngiven: they formulate development proposals that fit the particularities of their territo-\nries, and then present these to the central government, which judges proposals on their\nmerits. Such `indicative' planning practices, in which decisions are legitimised by nego-\ntiated interpretation of planning guidance, have a long tradition in The Netherlands.\nSimilarly, design \u00ad as an explorative search for solutions to problems in the built envi-\nronment \u00ad is an important and stable component of planning in The Netherlands. To\nimagine design solutions for particular areas and to use these to influence planning guid-\nance is a long-standing practice, which can be traced back to the emergence of urban\nplanning in the early 20th century, with Van Eesteren as its most important founding\nfather (for his reflection on design and planning, see Van Eesteren, 1948). Design prac-\ntice is positively associated with both innovation in, and operationalisation of, national\nplanning. Since the 1980s, in the context of decentralisation and deregulation, design has\nalso come to be seen as a practice that contributes to the formation of governance around\nprojects and strategies, as well as tempering any conflicting political and territorial inter-\nests that arise. However, the position and role of design in indicative planning are not\nwell understood. As a result, attempts to involve the professional expertise and value\nschemes of designers in planning decision making continue to have unclear outcomes.\nThis article discusses the interrelations between design and planning. It is argued that\ndesign, when used in the realm of indicative planning, aims to improve planning guid-\nance by assessing its implications for particular situations. In this way, design practice\nresembles discretionary action \u00ad an attempt to look beyond generally applicable rules\nwhen making decisions. This preposition implies that design is an integral part of plan-\nning, a practice that informs and is informed by prevailing planning rationales. The\ndialectic is developed against a background of literature on design, spatial planning,\nspatial representation and spatial concepts. The result of theoretical reflection is an\nanalytical framework to distinguish design practices by their discretional agency. The\nframework enables us to identify if practices are intended to refine or challenge plan-\nning guidance. It also reveals forms of discretional control. In particular, it highlights\nhow, in the context of collaborative planning decision making, the flexibility of plan-\nning guidance and the resulting room for interpretation are important determinants in\nthe role of creative design practice.\nThe article is structured in four main sections. In the first section, the analytical frame-\nwork to interpret relations between regional design practices and planning is developed.\nIn the second, this framework is applied to four well-known regional design initiatives\nthat evolved in the context of consecutive Dutch national plans since the mid-1980s. The\nanalysis reveals that flexibility in Dutch national plans reduced over this period. It is\nshown that, in this context of diminishing room for interpretation, the role of design in the\nmaking of planning decisions changed: initially, it was a practice that criticised national\nplans from an extra-governmental perspective; it then worked to collaboratively define\nnational planning with various levels of government, and then further transformed into a\npractice that challenged national plans on behalf of the national government. Design\nshifted from a practice operating on its own initiative, with the attention of a broad audi-\nence, into a procedure made mandatory by the national government, who acted as both a\nsole initiator and a sole audience of designs. In the third section, observations from this\nanalysis are summarised, and the institutionalisation of regional design in Dutch planning\nis critically reviewed. The fourth, concluding part of the article, discusses the theoretical\nfoundation of the analytical framework and further questions it raises.\nIn theoretical terms, the analytical framework and article are based on a combination\nof planning and design theory, thus enhancing understanding between fields (for a lack\nof such understanding, see Gunder, 2011). Its planning-theoretical ambition is to contrib-\nute to an increased understanding of planning in a post-regulative era. Observation indi-\ncates that planning in the context of flexible planning guidance enhances attention to\nparticular spatial contexts (Allmendinger et al., 2015; Brenner et al., 2011). Such a con-\nsideration of material settings and practices \u00ad the built environment and the way it is used\n\u00ad is central to design. Against this background, the article emphasises the capacity of\ndesign theory to contribute to an understanding of variations in regional planning and\ngovernance, under differing institutional circumstances (Mayntz, 2001).\nUnderstanding regional design in the context of planning:\nan analytical framework\nThe use of spatial representations in regional design\nFew scholarly writings are dedicated to regional design, and many of these build upon\nthe seminal work of a small number of authors from the fields of architecture and urban\ndescribe design as a reflective and argumentative practice, oriented towards the improve-\nment of the built environment. Design has a holistic orientation also. It is an attempt at a\ncomprehensive understanding of spatial development, a search for integral solutions that\nconsider dependencies among parts. Since the built environment is a complex system,\nthe act of designing is unlikely to evolve in a linear manner from problem definition to\nsolution. It is more likely to be explorative, evolving during multiple synthesis-evalua-\ntion iterations and steps in which problems and solutions are explicated, comprehended,\nreflected upon and adapted.\nHowever complex, the built environment itself plays an important role in design.\nDesign theorists argue that `design is a relatively simple set of operations carried out on\nhighly complex structures, which are themselves simplified by socially constructed \"the-\ngests that design evolves in a `design world' \u00ad a designer's subjective perception of\nmaterial settings. A designer simplifies his or her perception of these settings into types\nor `generative abstractions' (p. 183). When considering possible design solutions, these\nabstractions lead to the recognition of matches and mismatches: the designer learns how\nwell certain solutions fit particular settings. In this way, design may be both a process of\nelaboration and a process of discovery. Imagined solutions may lead to a refinement of\ntypes, a more detailed account of material settings. They may also help the designer to\nreveal new aspects of the built environment and define new types (Sch\u00f6n, 1988). From\nthe testing of solutions against types, rules are deducted: `As rules of law are derived\nfrom judicial precedents, [...], so design rules are derived from types, and may be sub-\njected to test and criticism by reference to them' (Sch\u00f6n, 1988: 183).\nImages of the built environment are a central media in design (Rittel, 1987). Maps,\ndiagrams and models facilitate the `conversation with the situation' that constitutes design\n(Sch\u00f6n, 1985: 49). Specifically in the spatial planning literature, the use of geographic\nimagery has also gained attention. Such imagery is frequently related to subjective percep-\ntions of material settings and practices used in decision making (e.g. D\u00fchr, 2004; Faludi,\nbe socially constructed, relative expressions of what different actors find important and\nwhat they are willing to neglect (Davoudi and Strange, 2008). When associated with inter-\npretative planning, visualisations turn into spatial representations (Davoudi, 2011). These\nrepresentations have `agency' (Davoudi, 2011: 438), intentionally generating meaning by\ndrawing on repertoires of existing symbols for the purpose of politics and planning.\nWritings on the utilisation of such spatial representations in planning processes distin-\nguish three main logics that span multiple disciplines, notably an analytical, normative and\nhave an analytical logic, they are associated with (invariable) scientific knowledge about\nmaterial spatial settings and practices. The normative logic of representations evolves\nagainst the background of political values and norms, wherein representations portray desir-\nable planning outcomes. Such representations are often seen to be persuasive \u00ad to advocate\nfuture development and also to promote appropriate planning action in light of this \u00ad hence\nthe focus of much (academic) attention to visions in spatial planning (e.g. Albrechts et al.,\n2003). However, when distinguishing know-why (the values and norms that motivate plan-\nning) and know-how (the action derived from such motivation), the organisational logic of\nspatial representations appears. Here, a representation shows a territory, it `relates to a con-\ncern with regional impacts and incidences of policies and the question of how specific local\nand regional entities (territories) are affected by those policies'(Sch\u00f6n, 2005: 391).\nIn this way, regional design can be seen to expose analytical knowledge, normative\nconvictions and territorial interests when developing solutions for the built environment.\nA design proposal may be utilised for a single purpose, or may also assemble notions and\ncompose a more intricate story line about what, why and how to intervene. Van Dijk\n(2011), who theorised regional design as a form of storytelling, notes that regional design\n`deserves to be seen as an attempt to prepare the regional perceptual foundations of even-\ntual decisions, and be applied as such' (p. 141). However, this does not evolve without\ncontext. In the few scholarly writings on regional design, there is agreement that it is\noften a collaborative and interactive practice, involving a broad array of planning actors\n(Faludi and Korthals Altes, 1994: 405), it is likely that design proposals produce matches\nand mismatches not only in the mind of the individual designer but also with `pre-exist-\ning stories' (Faludi and Korthals Altes, 1994) \u00ad institutionalised perceptions of geogra-\nphies that stabilise prevailing planning practices (see also Brenner et al., 2011, on the\nreflexivity of assemblage urbanism).\nDesign in the context of spatial concepts\nIt is common to describe spatial planning as a strategic planning approach that pays more\nattention to the particularities of the built environment than statutory planning does\nNeedham, 1988; Sch\u00f6n, 2005). Its objective, `to articulate a more coherent spatial logic\nfor land use regulation, resource protection, and investments in regeneration and infra-\nstructure' (Albrechts et al., 2003: 113), has generated a considerable body of literature on\n`spatial concepts' \u00ad the `pre-existing stories' and institutionalised geographies mentioned\nabove. Faludi (1987) and Needham (1988), theorising the emergence of spatial planning\nin The Netherlands, argued early on that a form of planning that allocates planning\nresources to some areas while others are omitted requires a shared understanding of spa-\ntial development. They saw explicit (and negotiable) relations between what they called a\n`spatial order' (autonomous spatial development, motivated by social action) and `spatial\nordering' (intervening in spatial development) as a precondition for any approach to stra-\ntegic spatial planning. Empirical analysis verified their argument. It was shown that Dutch\nnational planning in particular relied on a generic spatial logic, a `planning doctrine', that\nwas repeatedly used to justify more detailed operational decisions (Faludi and Van Der\nValk, 1994; Roodbol-Mekkes et al., 2012). Investigations into Dutch `planning concepts'\n(Van Duinen, 2004; Zonneveld, 1991) brought similar patterns to the fore. They also indi-\ncated that operational planning relies on a set of relatively stable spatial concepts: core\nguiding principles and related core planning tasks, articulating presumptive planning\nrationales, which are explored when they are applied to more specific situations.\nSuch spatial concepts in planning have a well-established importance in The\nNetherlands (for more recent writing, see, for example, Hagens, 2010; Van Duinen,\nand Healey, 1999; Richardson and Jensen, 2003). Investigations into the use of relational\ngeographies in collaborative planning contributed to a growing recognition that percep-\ntions of space and place are selectively used by governments `with the ambition of accu-\nmulating sufficient allocative, authoritative and imaginative force to shape both the\nmaterialities and identities of particular places' (Healey, 2006: 527). A critical review of\nthese geographies has shown that such concepts are used to perpetuate prevailing plan-\nning regimes and the political interests behind these (e.g. Brenner, 1999; Jessop, 2012;\nMassey, 2011). In governance theory, certain perceptions of space (and time) are associ-\nated with institutions. They are used in order to\n[...] stabilise the cognitive and normative expectations of [...] actors by shaping and promoting\na common worldview as well as developing adequate solutions to sequencing problems, that\nis, the predictable ordering of various actions, policies, or processes over time [...]. (Jessop,\nDavoudi (2003) observed the use of the polycentrism concept, which had become\nwidespread currency in European spatial planning by the mid-1990s. She noted that the\nconcept had several dimensions. This can be generalised to spatial concepts as a whole:\nthe analytical dimension provides knowledge on how unplanned individual action affects\nspatial development; from the normative dimension, a concept is a metaphor for desira-\nble spatial structures and also includes a guiding principle to achieve a policy goal; the\nfinal, organisational dimension of concepts reflects prevailing territorial control.\nDavoudi (2003) showed how the concept of polycentrism was transformed from a\ndescriptive and analytical tool to a widespread prescriptive and normative agenda. As it\nwas applied to a multitude of situations in European Union (EU) member states, it turned\ninto an `ideal type', `despite a lack of common definition and empirical evidence about\nits desirability, effectiveness, or the potential for its alleged success being replicated\nelsewhere by policy intervention' (Davoudi, 2003: 996). The concept continued to be\nused, not as a deterministic rationale but as a collection of notions from which planners\nderived logics that fitted the spatial particularities of situations and arguably also their\npolitical preferences and territorial interests.\nFrom these notions, a model of an interplay between regional design and spatial\nconcepts (as key elements of planning guidance) appears. Design solutions for particu-\nlar regions are framed by an institutionalised repertoire of notions from which decisions\nabout what, why and how to plan are derived. Design may be a form of analytical rea-\nsoning (referring to the analytical foundation of concepts), a form of political action\n(referring to a normative planning agenda) or a form of organisational reasoning (refer-\nring to prevailing territorial control) (see Figure 1(a) below). As highlighted earlier,\ndesign theorists argue that design \u00ad the testing of solutions against simplified abstrac-\ntions of the built environment \u00ad may be a process of elaboration or of discovery. When\nassuming that design evolves in the framework of spatial concepts, it may be used to\nrefine these: deducing solutions from a given choice, an institutionalised repertoire of\nmeanings (see Figure 1(b) below). Conversely, a hypothetical or imagined solution may\nhelp the designer to uncover new aspects of the built environment. It may be inductive,\nbeing used to challenge or enrich prevailing spatial concepts and the array of rationales\nthat these incorporate (see Figure 1(c) below).\nPositioning design in the realm of planning\nThe notions above differentiate regional designs by their relation to the spatial concepts\nused to stabilise and perpetuate prevailing planning guidance. The study of spatial con-\ncepts in planning is not an easy task to accomplish. As Davoudi (2003) has shown, con-\ncepts change while being used for the planning of particular areas. In this sense, it is\ndifficult to distinguish concepts from their interpretation. The use of concepts also varies\naccording to regional planning regimes and cultures in countries (Nadin and Stead, 2008).\nIn some European countries, regional planning relies on narrowly defined statutory plan-\nning guidance. In many countries, regional planning evolves in a `gap' (Allmendinger\net al., 2015: 1), an `institutional void'where `there are no clear rules and norms according\nto which politics is to be conducted and policy measures are to be agreed upon' (Hajer,\n2003: 175). Concepts, in the context of `gaps'and `voids', rely not on a select and detailed\nempirical evidence base but on a fuzzy landscape of theories (Davoudi, 2006; Markusen,\n1999). They incorporate not specific operational goals but vaguely defined political agen-\ndas. Spatial concepts then do not encompass specific policies, projected upon clearly\ndefined administrative territories by governmental authorities who hold the sole power for\nplanning, but general measures, projected upon softly defined regions by governance\narrangements who (often temporarily) share such planning power. When concepts are\nseen to frame decision making, the degree of flexibility opens up room for interpretation.\nDespite being difficult to trace, such room for interpretation is decisive for the position of\nFigure 1. Interrelations between spatial concepts and regional design: (a) dimension of spatial concepts: framing reasoning in planning decision making;\n(b) regional design as a process of elaboration: refining spatial concepts; (c) regional design as a process of discovery: challenging spatial concepts.\nregional design in the realm of planning. What (Rittel, 1987) calls `the awesome epistemic\nfreedom' in design is built into a planning system.\nIn his reflection on a designer's way of reasoning, Rittel (1987) notes that design solu-\ntions are derived from argumentation, but that such argument is always incomplete. The\nbuilt environment is composed of multiple dependent parts. During the design process, a\ndesigner continuously chooses to focus on some dependencies, taking a distinct path in\nreasoning while leaving others unexplored. His or her choices are based on arguments\nbut are not derived from them: `Looking at the various pros and cons, the designer has\n\"made up his mind.\" How this happens is beyond reasoning' (Rittel, 1987: 5). Multiple\nchoices constitute `epistemic freedom' on which design thrives (Rittel, 1987). They turn\ndesign not only into a creative practice but also into a practice of doubt, wherein the\ndesigner pragmatically searches for acknowledged constraints that limit choices and\nreleases him or her from responsibility:\nWhat the designer knows, believes, fears, desires enters his reasoning at every step of the\nprocess, affects his use of epistemic freedom. He will \u00ad of course \u00ad commit himself to those\npositions which matches his beliefs, convictions, preferences, and values, unless he is persuaded\nor convinced by someone else or his own insight. (p. 6)\nThese notions imply that being given room for interpretation informs not only the\nnature of argumentation in design but also its collaborative rationality (Graham and\nconvictions, preferences and values that actors pursue. Giving broad room for interpreta-\ntion entails that design is a collaborative search for planning solutions by means of nego-\ntiation on convictions (although with the risk of overly pragmatic behaviour). Narrow\nroom for interpretation entails that design and planning decision making evolves through\nconfrontation (at the risk of conflict).\nSummary: design as discretionary behaviour\nIn Figure 2(a), the `room for interpretation' within which design may evolve is defined\nby the multiplicity of choices that prevailing planning guidance incorporates. The room\nfor interpretation \u00ad likewise a `field of choice' (Faludi and Korthals Altes, 1994; Friend\ntions' (Rittel, 1987) \u00ad has been extensively discussed in planning and design theory. The\nmost detailed notions of how such choices influence the making of planning decisions\nstem from the field of planning law and discretion. Discretion is a form of decision mak-\ning concerned with `making choices between courses of action' (Booth, 2007: 131).\nWhat distinguishes discretion from other forms of decision making is the importance of\nrules therein. Discretionary action aims to bend rules; it is a search for `leeway in the\ninterpretation of fact and the application of precedent to particular cases' (Booth, 2007:\n129). In normative terms, discretion is associated with an improvement of rules through\na judgement of their implications for particular situations.\nThe degree of flexibility or ambiguity within rules is seen to be decisive for the\nway that discretion is exercised. Discretionary action in the context of imperative\nFigure 2. Flexibility of planning guidance/room for interpretation as context for regional design: (a) flexibility of planning guidance, (b) regional\ndesign in the context of planning guidance.\ninstructions, select and detailed rules, is likely to be inductive \u00ad it challenges rules\nby alternative reasoning. In the context of flexible guidelines, multiple and ambigu-\nous rules that allow for multiple interpretations, discretion is practiced in the form of\npolicy argumentation (Tewdwr-Jones, 1999: 245) \u00ad a consideration of multiple `other\nschemes of values' to legitimise decisions, as Booth (2007: 136) notes. It is deduc-\ntive meant to refine rules. The selection and degree of detail within rules inform the\nnature of decision making. They also inform constellations among actors. Imperative\ninstructions are likely to have a clearly identifiable author and `court of appeal'\nwhich exercises discretionary control in case of discretionary action by others.\nFlexible guidelines imply a collaborative rationality. They are not only inclusive but\nalso result in unclear arrangements of who exercises discretionary action and who\nexercises discretionary control.\nThe amount of room for interpretation is central to how design practices are embed-\nded in planning (see Figure 2(b)). It defines if design is meant to be a practice that assists\nin the collaborative production of planning spaces, is deducted from an outline agree-\nment on planning agendas and principles, is at the risk of overly pragmatic behaviour or\nis challenging planning from the outside at the risk of conflict. Several questions arise\nregarding the flexibility of planning guidance, the relationship between design practices\nand this guidance, and actors involved. Below, these questions are further defined and\nused to discuss a series of exemplary regional design initiatives that evolved in the con-\ntext of Dutch indicative planning between the late 1980s and the 2010s, a period when\nthe flexibility of national planning guidance fluctuated widely under the influence of\nderegulation and decentralisation.\nExemplary Dutch regional design initiatives\nAbove, an analytical framework to differentiate regional design practices by their rela-\ntion to planning guidance was introduced. The framework raises three questions con-\ncerning the role and position of regional design in the realm of indicative planning:\nwhat is the flexibility of planning guidance? Are design proposals meant to challenge\nor refine guidance? Who are the authors and audiences of design? Below, the frame-\nwork is used for an analysis of exemplary regional design initiatives that evolved under\nthe influence of four consecutive national planning frameworks published in 1988 (as\nbriefly analysed to identify the spatial concepts they incorporated. From an analysis of\ntheir dimensions, the degree of room for interpretation is deduced. Regional design\ninitiatives that emerged in the context of these frameworks are examined for their ref-\nerences to the identified spatial concepts, as well as the way that these references have\nbeen combined for the purpose of discretion.\nThe analysis of the flexibility of planning guidance is based on a review of publicly\navailable policy documents, most importantly the national plans themselves. Plans\ninclude maps which set out planning principles in overview. Spatial concepts mentioned\nin the key of these maps were selected by their concern about urbanisation. They pro-\nvided the basis for a system of coding used for in-depth documentary analysis. Text and\nadditional maps in reports and secondary policy documents (referred to in core\ndocuments) were reviewed for their analytical knowledge, normative goals and policy\nmeasures associated with concepts. Changes in the flexibility of planning guidance were\ndeduced from the amount and relative degree of detail in evidence, goals and policy\nmeasures given in plans. Findings were supported through a review of academic litera-\nture on Dutch indicative planning, spatial concepts and governance over time. The choice\nof regional design examples was guided by the prominence that practices gained in\nDutch professional discourse on the role of regional design in national planning. The\nanalysis of regional design initiatives is based on various written and drawn material,\nincluding regional design products (maps and other visualisations). This material was\nreviewed for references to spatial concepts, analytical knowledge, normative goals and\norganisational implications. In addition, authors (involved in design initiatives and/or the\nmaking of design proposals) and audiences (who commissioned designs and/or to whom\ndesigns were presented) were identified. Results on the discretionary agency of design\npractices were supported by a review of professional and academic writing on the par-\nticular design initiatives.\nEpisode 1: designerly critique on national policies\nThe most well-known Dutch spatial concept is the Rim City (Randstad), invented during\nthe building of the Dutch welfare state in the 1950s. In its original form and in conjunc-\ntion with its counterpart, the Green Heart (Groene Hart), the Randstad was considered to\nhave a distinction between rural and urbanised areas, resulting in a vision for a just and\nhealthy distribution of land uses across such zones, forming territories to which restric-\ntions and regulations applied. The `urban-rural dichotomy' (Van Duinen, 2004: 49)\nbehind the concept remained a dominant planning rationale for decades (Faludi and Van\nEuropean integration, new spatial concepts emerged in the realm of Dutch national plan-\nning. In their analytical dimension, these concepts relied on observations of regionalisa-\ntion and theories of functional relations from the field of economic geography. In their\nnormative dimension, they referred to economic competitiveness. In their organisational\ndimension, they sketched the first contours of a new way of planning, favouring invest-\nment into strategic development over designation and containment by means of land-use\nThe Fourth Report on Planning, published in 1988 (Ministerie van Volkshuisvesting\nRuimtelijke Ordening en Milieubeheer (VROM), 1988) was the first national planning\nframework that reflected these new rationales (Lambregts and Zonneveld, 2004;\nZonneveld, 1991), albeit in a careful manner. The report used both old and new spatial\nconcepts, neatly set apart in two groups: a `spatial main structure'(ruimtelijke hoofstruc-\ntuur), reiterating the principles of land-use regulation and a `spatial development per-\nspective' (ruimtelijke ontwikkelingsperspectief), introducing new principles of strategic\nspatial planning. The report received criticism nevertheless, particularly from lower lev-\nels of government. Provincial and municipal governments accepted the new analytical\nknowledge and agenda but were highly critical of the organisational implications that\nwere deduced from these. Increasingly imperative regulation and the selection of a few\nprojects of national importance were seen to be overly rigid and arbitrary choices in the\ncontext of an increasingly broader selection of planning rationales. Sub-national govern-\nments also criticised the national government for the overly paternalistic role it took in\nthe late 1980s. The fact that these policies were promoted informally within national\ngovernmental departments and by new actors with unclear positions in the political\nstructure only accelerated criticism (Hajer and Zonneveld, 2000).\nIn the mid-1980s, several regional design initiatives expressed similar worries. A\nprominent one among these was called The Netherlands Now As Design (Nederland Nu\nAls Ontwerp (NNAO)). It was initiated by a handful of individuals, among them planners\nand designers. Its purpose was to produce a public exhibition on Dutch urban and\nregional design to be held in 1987 (for a summary, see Van Der Cammen, 1987). To pre-\npare this exhibition, an elaborate, 3-year long design process was conducted. Overarching\nsocietal trends were taken from analysis by the Scientific Council for Government Policy\n(NSCGP), and their spatial impact was imagined in the form of four alternative futures\nfor The Netherlands. Projections were evaluated for their impact on ecology, energy sup-\nply, housing and labour markets. What they would mean for the development of four\ntypical Dutch regions, with different degrees of urbanisation, was imagined, and typical\nmeasures to address development were illustrated in more detail. Designs were to `revi-\ntalise the political debate'on planning, as Frieling (2006: 10), a prominent member of the\nNNAO initiative, noted in retrospect (see also Salewski, 2012). They demonstrated that\nspatial patterns, deducted from different societal trends, can be desirable to variable\nextents, depending on differing political stances, and that the appropriateness of planning\nmeasures varies accordingly. In this way, they illustrated publicly that deciding on meas-\nures is not just an administrative task, accomplished inside the government, but a politi-\ncal practice of public importance as well.\nThe NNAO initiative evolved in an extra-governmental domain, as did other design\ninitiatives at the time. Initiatives were instigated by individual professionals, with sup-\nport from their professional institutes and a few governmental policy institutes. They\nwere meant to reiterate the important role that the design profession traditionally played\nin Dutch planning. To design was seen as an indispensable way to bring emerging spatial\ndevelopment to the foreground and debate planning decisions on these grounds. Design\npractices were a form of quality control for national planning guidance, evaluating it\nfrom the outside. This function changed in the period after, when decentralisation became\nan important issue in Dutch national planning and sub-national governments became\ninvolved in regional design.\nEpisode 2: designing national planning by local governments\nThe rigidity of territorial control in the Fourth Report on Planning caused worries not\nonly among professionals and sub-national governments. From the mid-1990s onwards,\nthe national government itself started to raise concerns. In 1998, the NSCGP summarised\nthese accumulated concerns. Reflecting on the possibility of a new Fifth Report on\nPlanning, it identified a fundamental mismatch between an analytical understanding of\nspatial development patterns, normative planning agendas and operational policies. It\nconcluded with an influential call for the modernisation of decision-making structures\nthrough more open planning protocols and new spatial concepts:\nThe basic principles of spatial planning and the way in which these have been elaborated into\npractical concepts face radical problems [...]. In the Council's view, the challenges being posed\nfor the deliberation structure require the latter to be reviewed. (Netherlands Scientific Council\nCollaboration among levels of government became an important issue. New `argu-\nmentative' concepts that could simultaneously guide and enhance involvement in plan-\nning were asked for (NSCGP, 1999: 80). However, exactly how such collaborative\nspatial concepts should look remained unclear for the time being.\nA famous Dutch regional design initiative took shape during this period of debate.\nThe initiative was rooted in the work of a group of professors in planning and urban\ndesign at several Dutch universities. Starting in 1996, under the header `The Metropolitan\nDebate' (Het Metropolitane Debat (HMD)), these experts engaged in reflection on\nregionalisation in The Netherlands, with specific attention to the Randstad region. An\nelaborate design process, conducted by students, researchers and professional designers,\nimagined alternative futures for this region. During public debate on these proposals, the\n`urban-rural dichotomy' behind the old Randstad concept was publicly dismantled. Its\nempirical foundation was critiqued, for example, on its ignorance of uncontrolled sprawl\nin the Green Heart and its neglect of the delta landscape structure, interwoven with both\nurban and rural land. Observations of emerging regional development patterns were used\nto stress the embeddedness of the region in European and international networks as well\nas a need for regionally coordinated planning in such a context.\nThe products of the HMD design exercise were a range of critical readings of the clas-\nsic Randstad concept. One of these framed the Randstad as a Delta Metropolis\n(Deltametropool), envisaging partnerships among municipalities in the region (for\nreviews of this process, see, for example, Lambregts and Zonneveld, 2004; Salet, 2006;\nVan Duinen, 2015). In the mid-1990s, such a coalition \u00ad among politicians from the four\nlarge Randstad municipalities \u00ad was already in existence in response to a perceived lack\nof attention from national planning to the persistent economic underperformance of these\nmunicipalities. They took up the Delta Metropolis design and brought it to the national\ngovernment. With these local governments associated with the design, it evolved from a\ncritique of the analytical and normative foundation of the Randstad concept into a pro-\nposal for the organisation of planning in the region. The design circumscribed a territory\nto be managed by the group of local governments who had volunteered to coordinate the\nplanning of the region on behalf of the national government.\nIn 2002, an initial version of the Fifth Report on Planning became available (VROM\nand Rijksplanologische Dienst, 2002). This report, which remained a draft due to politi-\ncal turmoil, was the first Dutch national report to explicitly foster decentralisation\n(VROM and Rijksplanologische Dienst, 2002: 260). Concepts favouring land-use regu-\nlation and investment into strategic development were both sustained, as in the Fourth\nReport. However, in contrast to the Fourth Report, the organisational dimension of spa-\ntial concepts became open to interpretation. In particular, `urban networks' (stedelijke\nnetwerken) figured prominently as a concept to facilitate decentralisation. A landscape of\ninformation was associated with the concept, concerning functional relations within and\namong regions, accessibility and diversity of social and economic activities for instance.\nAn array of goals was also attached to it, most importantly those of international eco-\nnomic competitiveness and vitality, a social norm. In its organisational dimension, the\nconcept was a request for active engagement of sub-national governments in national\nplanning. Emerging regional governance arrangements were given the benefit of the\ndoubt. The national government hoped that they would have the ability to autonomously\nand effectively act on the particular problems in their regions.\nThe Delta Metropolis initiative was taken up in the report as one such `urban net-\nwork', and inspired a period of optimism among Dutch regional planners and designers.\nIt became not only a planning but also a design precedent. Advocates of the Delta\nMetropolis had promoted their ideas not only in professional and academic circles but\nalso in the hallways of public offices and on political podia (Van Duinen, 2004, 2015).\nThe act of designing came to be seen as a way to clarify political options and forge gov-\nernance alliances around design proposals. Design practices that resembled the Delta\nMetropolis in their composition of participants emerged. Designers, groups of experts,\nplanners and politicians engaged in collaboratively exploring problems within their\nregions and presented solutions to the national government. The `urban network'concept\nwas a near to empty canvas. The broad analytical notions on regional spatial develop-\nment, the many values and norms and the open call for involvement of sub-national\ngovernments in national planning, turned nearly any design proposal by sub-national\ngovernments into a refinement of the national planning guidance.\nEpisode 3: designing national planning on behalf of the national\ngovernment\nThe Fifth Report was a highly flexible planning framework. The room given for interpre-\ntation was deliberately broadened to encourage the voluntary involvement of sub-\nnational governments in national planning. The following national report, the so-called\nSpatial Strategy (Nota Ruimte), first published in 2004, restricted this flexibility again\nThe Spatial Strategy was a revision of the Fifth Report but incorporated new spatial\nconcepts nonetheless. To align national policies across various sectors, it was preceded by\nseveral policy documents in which the ministries of economic affairs (EZ) and transport\n(V&W) set out their ideas about spatial organisation. The final strategy included these\nideas in the form of new (and revived) spatial concepts. The `urban network' concept, the\ncentral entry of the ministry of housing, spatial planning and the environment (VROM) in\nthe Fifth Report, came to lie next to `economic core areas', `main transport axis', `main\nports', `brain ports'and `green ports', promoted by a coalition among the ministries of EZ\nand V&W. As the names already suggest, these new concepts relied strongly on theories\nfrom the field of economic geography and emphasised economic competitiveness.\nTaken together, the preexisting and new spatial concepts created a landscape of multi-\nple planning rationales, seemingly broadening the flexibility of national planning guid-\nance. This impression was deceptive though, since concepts were re-ordered and\nselectively refined in terms of their organisational implications. The new concepts by the\nministries of EZ and V&W were immediately associated with direct investment into\nnational projects. Only the `urban network'concept, the contribution from the ministry of\nVROM, remained associated with negotiation and collaboration among governments at\ndifferent levels. Furthermore, only five out of the 17 `urban networks' in the Fifth Report\nwere continued. Collaboration was refined by a prescription of policies for sub-national\ngovernments to work with. Among these policies, the possible provision of funding for\ninfrastructure projects became the most important incentive for collaboration. In addition,\nthe national government started to regulate decision-making processes in the soft `urban\nnetwork'territories. Provinces were to take a leading role in regional governance arrange-\nments, for instance. As another example, specific analytical knowledge about regional\nspatial development (e.g. insights into regional accessibility generated by a national sur-\nvey) was to be considered when formulating potential projects of national importance.\nA regional design initiative that emerged in the context of the Spatial Strategy was\nStudio South Wing (Atelier Zuidvleugel). The studio was concerned with the southern part\nof the Randstad region, the so-called South Wing (Zuidvleugel), as one of the core eco-\nnomic areas that the Spatial Strategy identified. The studio was initiated by the province of\nSouth Holland in 2002 but only took up work in 2005: the scope of the studio was exten-\nsively discussed among governments in the region which caused delay. Eventually, a range\nof partners from municipal and city regional authorities participated. The long negotiations\non the scope of the studio led to a brief being given to it. Designs were to investigate the\nusefulness of the `network city'concept, exploring the region by means of the \u00ad admittedly\nvague \u00ad theories and values it incorporated.Attention was focused on managerial concerns.\nThe many existing local plans in the region were to receive specific attention: design was\nto deliver insights into how these plans might obstruct or catalyse the emergence of a `net-\nwork city' and produce comprehensive regional strategies that integrated these insights.\nDuring the 2-year existence of the studio, a set of such strategies were designed, for exam-\nple, for integrated public transport and land use, and for integrated urban and rural develop-\nment (for a review, see Atelier Zuidvleugel, 2008; Balz and Zonneveld, 2015). Projects\nwere presented to the national government that was also a member of the advisory board.\nIn the composition of participants, Studio South Wing resembled earlier initiatives\nthat had emerged around the year 2000, such as Delta Metropolis and its successors.\nHowever, in other aspects it differed. The national government took a more important\nrole therein as both author and audience. It was part of the advisory board of the studio,\nas mentioned above. It also provided funding and important knowledge and expertise.\nWhile earlier initiatives emerged around distinct problems in regions, this studio was in\nsearch of such problems. An exploration of the region through the lens of the `urban\nnetworks' concept was to provide `insights into nodes, crucial relations or indispensable\nswitches, where missing projects undermine a cohesive overall structure for the purpose\nof optimal provincial governing' (Provincie Zuid-Holland, 2004: 2, my translation). It\nwas also to define projects of national importance. In light of the refinement of national\nplanning guidance, design became above all a claim for national funding.\nEpisode 4: designing national projects on behalf of the national\ngovernment\nIn July 2008, a new Dutch planning act became effective and obliged government at all\nlevels to formulate new planning guidance that complied with the procedural requirements\nset out in the act. In 2012, the national government responded to the obligation (with some\ndelay): the National Policy Strategy for Infrastructure and Spatial Planning became avail-\nable, replacing all earlier national frameworks (Ministerie van Infrastructuur en Milieu\n(I&M),2012).TheNationalPolicyStrategywasauthoredbyanewministryofInfrastructure\nand the Environment (I&M), the product of a fusion of the ministries of VROM and V&W\nin 2010. It differed substantially from all previous national plans due to the spatial logics it\nused. Only a few planning rationales were extended, retaining economic competitiveness\nin a normative sense and the provision of infrastructure projects in an organisational one\n(Needham, 2015). A thoroughly evidence-based method to measure accessibility was used\nto identify new links in transport networks. Specialised economic activities also remained\nimportant through a concept called `urban regions with top sectors' (Needham, 2015: 28).\nAnalytically, the concept relied on observed concentrations of specialised economic sec-\ntors whose development was to advance the competitive position of The Netherlands inter-\nnationally. However, in its organisational dimension, the concept was associated with\nlargely non-spatial policy measures such as tax incentives.\nThe National Policy Strategy incorporated few spatial concepts and had little room for\ninterpretation by sub-national governments. Instead, it consisted of a catalogue of\nnational projects, most of them concerning investment into infrastructure. A new per-\nspective on decentralisation was employed: the new spatial planning act equipped sub-\nnational governments with more planning power. Regional planning (and the related\ndecision making) was now to take place at lower levels of government. However, deci-\nsion-making procedures for national infrastructure projects required the participation of\ngovernment at all levels, and in this way incorporated the seeds for new rounds of nego-\ntiations under the roof of the so-called Long-term Investment Programme for Transport\nand Spatial Development (MIRT).\nThe MIRT programme allocates national funds to large-scale infrastructure projects\nthrough highly regulated procedures. Since 2008, projects under this programme have had\nto consider not only an improvement of transport but also spatial development. Advice to\nthe government at the time had indicated that the realisation of projects was being delayed\nby conflict between the many affected stakeholders. The advice led to a revision of deci-\nsion-making processes. Regional design became a mandatory requirement. It was assumed\nthat such design practices can, when employed at an early stage of implementation, expli-\ncate interdependencies among planning issues at different scales, facilitate discussions\nand agreements on these, and in this way help to avoid conflict, delay and costs at later\nstages. With the increasing number of national projects included in the National Policy\nStrategy, the MIRT programme, and thus also regional design, grew in importance.\nconducted in 2012, was associated with this new obligation to employ regional design\n(Zandbelt and Van Den Berg, 2012). The acronym SMASH stands for Structural Vision\nMain Port Amsterdam Schiphol Haarlemmermeer (Rijksstructuurvisie Mainport\nAmsterdam Schiphol Haarlemmermeer), a framework detailing national planning for the\narea around Schiphol International Airport, and one of the projects of national impor-\ntance identified in the National Policy Strategy. The SMASH design exercise was com-\nmissioned by the ministry of I&M to investigate (infra)structural change in the area. It\nwas conducted by an individual urban design professional. During a series of workshops,\nrepresentatives of sub-national governments in the area, private parties and experts com-\nmented on evolving design proposals. There were three alternative futures presented for\nthe region, reflecting on three predefined main tasks in the area: notably an improvement\nof accessibility, the expansion of Schiphol and the satisfaction of housing demands. The\nimpact of each alternative was illustrated, showing implications for water management\nsystems, housing and working environments, energy schemes and environmental law.\nDesigns were to stress test the proposed national infrastructure project. The multiple\ninterwoven arguments they brought forward can be understood as a critique, challenging\nthe restricted scope of national planning. However, when compared to earlier regional\ndesign practices, this challenge took place in a highly controlled environment in which\nthe national government predefined a project, the region that may be affected by it, the\nmain problems and tasks in implementation, and also both commissioned and judged it.\nDiscussion\nAbove, a set of regional design initiatives that evolved under the influence of four con-\nsecutive Dutch national planning frameworks were analysed using the new analytical\nframework. The framework assumes that design in the realm of planning resembles dis-\ncretionary action. Such discretionary action aims to improve planning guidance by judg-\ning its implications for particular situations. From this perspective, design is an integral\npart of planning, a practice that informs and is informed by prevailing planning ration-\nales.Analysis by means of the framework allows for a detailed account of these interrela-\ntions. Figure 3 below presents the results of the analysis in overview.\nThe first observation drawn from this analysis concerns planning guidance. In the\nperiod between 1988 and 2012, the Dutch national government provided four planning\nframeworks. During a seemingly experimental phase, the flexibility of each one differed,\nreflecting different ideas about collaboration among levels of government in national\nindicative planning. Differences in the degree of room for interpretation were mainly the\nresult of modifications to the organisational dimension of planning guidance, demon-\nstrating a pragmatic approach to collaboration. The Fourth Report on Planning (VROM,\n1988) contained a broad array of new spatial concepts, but it was the national govern-\nment that decided upon the organisational implications. The Fifth Report on Planning\n(VROM and Rijksplanologische Dienst, 2002) broke away from this paternalistic role\nfor national government, including concepts that were highly open to interpretation in all\ntheir dimensions. To enhance the involvement of local actors, earlier imperative instruc-\ntions about `what should be done'turned into broad suggestions for what `could be done'\n(in the terminology of Tewdwr-Jones, 1999: 245, that is borrowed from the UK context\nhere). Later plans, published from the mid-2000s onwards, became more select and\ndetailed in their prescription of specific policies again. Direct investment into projects of\nnational importance became a dominant form of planning, as in the National Policy\nStrategy of 2012. The few concepts that this plan included were also highly select and\ndetailed in their analytical and normative dimension. Regional planning and decision\nmaking were largely devolved to lower levels of government.\nIn the context of diminishing flexibility and diminishing room for interpretation, the\nrole of regional design in decision making changed. Indeed, it reflected, through its\nFigure 3. Interrelations between design initiatives and Dutch national plans over time.\ndiscretionary action, shifts in the flexibility of guidance. Author\u00adaudience constellations\nchanged alongside. First, design was a practice that criticised national plans, from an\nextra-governmental perspective, for a neglect of the political dimension of planning, as\nthe example of the NNAO initiative shows. Then, in the context of the highly ambiguous\nplanning guidance in the Fifth Report, design turned into a practice to collaboratively\nrefine national planning with various levels of government. This was exemplified by the\nDelta Metropolis design initiative. When planning guidance then became oriented\ntowards projects of national importance, design practices followed, as the South Wing\nstudio example demonstrates. Finally, in the context of the National Policy Strategy and\nthe MIRT programme, design became a mandatory requirement in decision making on\nnational projects. As the SMASH example shows, design became a practice to purpose-\nfully challenge these projects. The national government became the commissioner of\nsuch critique as well as its sole receiver. This most recent institutionalisation of regional\ndesign in Dutch national planning does not reflect the distance between authors and audi-\nences, or between discernible actors in action and control, which qualifies discretion.\nConclusion\nThere is a tradition of using regional design in Dutch indicative planning. Expectations\nconcerning the impact of design-led approaches on planning decision making were and\nare usually high. Design is thought to mobilise thinking capacity; it is seen to be an adven-\nturous and inventive endeavour. To reflect on spatial development is to enhance the tech-\nnical quality of planning strategies and projects. Since decentralisation and deregulation\nbecame issues in Dutch planning, design is now also expected to perform in political and\norganisational settings. It is expected to clarify political options, forge societal alliances,\nremove conflict around planning solutions early on and thus speed up implementation.\nThe analytical model developed here reflects these multiple expectations: design may\nchallenge or refine planning; it may be oriented towards political values and norms, towards\nthe analytical foundation of planning and/or towards organisational planning measures in\nterritories. However, the model implies that the impact of design is not only determined by\nthe design solutions themselves but also by concurrent planning guidance. The dialectics\nbetween design and guidance suggests that design may be an inherently discretional prac-\ntice. When viewing design as a form of discretion, it is the prevailing planning rationales\nthat define whether an imaginary future is a relevant interpretation of fact or an arbitrary\nfantasy; a precedent to be considered in future planning decisions or a negligible incident.\nDiscretionary approaches within design aim to improve planning guidance by assess-\ning its implications for particular situations. The testing of this preposition has revealed\nthat there may be strong interrelations between planning and design. In particular, the\nflexibility of planning guidance and the resulting room for interpretation are determi-\nnants. Giving broad room for interpretation in planning guidance may inspire a collabo-\nrative and creative search for problems and innovative planning solutions but at the risk\nof a loss of operational planning guidance and overly pragmatic behaviour. Narrow room\nfor interpretation almost inevitably turns designs into criticism, with the risk of conflict.\nAs the examples above show, the Dutch national government has sought to resolve this\ndilemma by positioning design in a highly controlled organisational environment where\nthe government itself is a facilitator of design and a court of appeal. However, such insti-\ntutionalisation of discretionary practice (a form of meta-governance in fact) raises con-\ncerns about its ability to legitimise planning decisions. More broadly, it shows that it is\nimportant to consider the authors and audiences of design as they relate to planning. If\ndesign practices are to be discretionary action, as is the case in Dutch indicative plan-\nning, they must evolve at a distance to the formal planning apparatus.\nThe analytical model that was used for analysis here is based on a combination of plan-\nning and design theory.Asearch for similarities among theories has resulted in the recogni-\ntion that the built environment itself is the most common denominator across fields. The\nmodel recognises that perceptions of geography are composed of analytical knowledge,\nnormative agendas and notions of territorial control. Spatial concepts that stabilise prevail-\ning or institutionalised planning practices incorporate such perceptions. Design assembles\na selection of notions for a distinct planning purpose in a particular area. Both the use of\nconcepts and design have agency in constructing perceptions of the built environment. This\nnotion calls for a more intricate understanding of how perceptions of material settings\ntransform as they are used \u00ad how spatial concepts turn into detailed plans and vice versa.\nPlanning-theoretical reflection has revealed that planning in a post-regulative era, in the\nabsence of clearly defined planning rules and institutions, pays increased attention to spe-\ncific spatial development. Such attention has led authors to distinguish between policy-\nmaking, which concerns the resolution of predefined problems in predefined territories,\nand planning as a political practice, which includes the formulation of problems in areas\nthat are yet to be defined.Analysis here has shown that roles of design practices in planning\ndecision making vary. Varieties may be the outcome of incidental experiment. However,\nobservation indicates that they may also be the result of more structural attempts to balance\npragmatic and political planning approaches, which calls for an increased understanding of\nthe performance of design-led approaches in planning decision making.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nReferences\nAlbrechts L, Healey P and Kunzmann KR (2003) Strategic spatial planning and regional govern-\nAllmendinger P and Haughton G (2010) Spatial planning, devolution, and new planning spaces.\nAllmendinger P, Haughton G and Shepherd E (2015) Where is planning to be found?
