    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: Accelerometers were incorporated in the 2003\u00ad2004 National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey\n(NHANES) study cycle for objective assessment of physical activity. This is the first time that objective physical activity data are\navailable on a nationally representative sample of U.S. residents. The use of accelerometers allows researchers to measure total\nphysical activity, including light intensity and unstructured activities, which may be a better predictor of health outcomes than\nstructured activity alone. The aim of this study was to examine objectively determined physical activity levels by sex, age and\nracial/ethnic groups in a national sample of U.S. adults.\nMethods: Data were obtained from the 2003\u00ad2004 NHANES, a cross-sectional study of a complex, multistage probability\nsample of the U.S. population. Physical activity was assessed with the Actigraph AM-7164 accelerometer for seven days following\nan examination. 2,688 U.S. adults with valid accelerometer data (i.e. at least four days with at least 10 hours of wear-time) were\nincluded in the analysis. Mean daily total physical activity counts, as well as counts accumulated in minutes of light, and moderate-\nvigorous intensity physical activity are presented by sex across age and racial/ethnic groups. Generalized linear modeling using\nthe log link function was performed to compare physical activity in sex and racial/ethnic groups adjusting for age.\nResults: Physical activity decreases with age for both men and women across all racial/ethnic groups with men being more active\nthan women, with the exception of Hispanic women. Hispanic women are more active at middle age (40\u00ad59 years) compared\nto younger or older age and not significantly less active than men in middle or older age groups (i.e. age 40\u00ad59 or age 60 and\nolder). Hispanic men accumulate more total and light intensity physical activity counts than their white and black counterparts\nfor all age groups.\nConclusion: Physical activity levels measured objectively by accelerometer demonstrated that Hispanic men are, in general,\nmore active than their white and black counterparts. This appears to be in contrast to self-reported physical activity previously\nreported in the literature and identifies the need to use objective measures in situations where the contribution of light intensity\nand/or unstructured physical activity cannot be assumed homogenous across the populations of interest.\nThis article is available from: http://www.ijbnpa.org/content/6/1/31\n\u00a9 2009 Hawkins et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0),\nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nInternational Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity 2009, 6:31 http://www.ijbnpa.org/content/6/1/31\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBackground\nPhysical activity can prevent and delay the onset of\nchronic diseases, such as diabetes and heart disease [1,2].\nDespite this, inactivity is common in the United States.\nNational surveillance systems have included measures of\nphysical activity allowing researchers to measure trends in\nphysical activity as well as identify groups that are physi-\ncally inactive. Historically, national reports, such as the\nBehavior Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES), have incorporated subjective measures (e.g.\nquestionnaires) because of their low cost and ease of use,\nwhich makes them ideal for large population studies.\nHowever, objective measures, such as pedometers, which\ncount steps, and accelerometers, which measure move-\nment intensity, are starting to be utilized to assess physical\nactivity levels in population studies [3-6].\nBoth subjective and objective assessment tools have\nadvantages and disadvantages depending on the popula-\ntion being studied and the research question being inves-\ntigated [7]. Subjective measures often provide detailed\ninformation regarding type of activity. However, because\nthey rely on self-report of activity they are subject to\nresponse bias and recall bias. In particular, they have lim-\nited accuracy at capturing activities that are unstructured,\nand of light intensity [8], both of which tend to be per-\nformed in greater frequency in women and in older pop-\nulations [9-11]. Thus, using a subjective measure of\nphysical activity may not provide an accurate description\nof activity in these groups. It is important to measure total\nphysical activity (which includes light intensity and\nunstructured activities) because it may have a greater\nimpact on several health outcomes, such as diabetes, com-\npared to moderate-to-vigorous physical activity alone [12-\n14]. Objective measures, such as accelerometers, do not\nprovide detailed information on the type of activities\nbeing performed. However, they do record physical activ-\nity across all intensities and are not subject to the biases of\nself-report. In addition, accelerometers can be used to esti-\nmate the time spent in light, moderate, and high intensity\nphysical activity and the contribution of each to total\nphysical activity [15].\nNHANES study cycle for objective assessment of physical\nactivity. This is the first time that objective physical activ-\nity data are available on a nationally representative sam-\nple of U.S. residents. A previous effort by Troiano et al\nfocuses on physical activity at moderate-to-vigorous levels\nof intensity describing, on a population level, who's meet-\ning the Surgeon General's recommendations of physical\nactivity using this accelerometry data from NHANES [6].\nIn contrast, given the potential importance of total physi-\ncal activity, the current effort includes assessments of light\nintensity activity and moderate-vigorous intensity activity\nto examine differences in physical activity by sex, age and\nracial/ethnic groups in a national sample of adults.\nMethods\nStudy Population and Procedures\nNHANES is a cross-sectional observational study con-\nducted by the National Center for Health Statistics of the\nCenters for Disease Control that uses a stratified, multi-\nstage probability design to obtain a nationally representa-\ntive sample of the U.S. household population [16]. The\nsurvey population includes randomly selected neighbor-\nhoods in the United States. From these neighborhoods,\nrandom households are selected to incorporate individu-\ncycle, 12,761 individuals were selected for recruitment. Of\nipate in the study.\nexamination, and laboratory tests conducted in mobile\nexamination centers (MEC) by trained staff. Physical\nactivity assessment was restricted to NHANES participants\nwho were not prevented by impairments from walking or\nwearing an accelerometer. Our analysis was further\nrestricted to individuals who were at least 18 years of age,\nnot pregnant, and never reported having had a stroke,\ncongestive heart failure, angina, emphysema, chronic\nbronchitis, or renal dialysis to exclude individuals whose\nphysical activity was limited because of illness or health\nstatus (N = 3840). Fewer than 5% of the remaining partic-\nipants reported a race other than non-Hispanic white,\nnon-Hispanic black or Hispanic so they were subse-\nquently excluded from this analysis due to insufficient\nsample size (N = 149). Participants who had at least four\ndays of valid accelerometer data with relevant covariates\nMeasures\nPhysical Activity\nPhysical activity was assessed with the Actigraph AM-7164\naccelerometer (formerly the CSA/MTI AM-7164, manu-\nfactured by ActiGraph of Ft. Walton Beach, Florida, USA),\nwhich is a pager size device powered by a small lithium\nbattery. The accelerometers were attached to an elasticized\nbelt and worn on the right hip. The accelerometer meas-\nures the duration and intensity of physical activity by cap-\nturing the magnitude of acceleration (intensity) and\nsumming up the magnitudes (intensity counts) within a\nspecified time interval (epoch). A one-minute epoch was\nused by NHANES.\nParticipants were asked to wear the device for seven days\nwhile they were awake, and to take it off for swimming or\nbathing. Monitors were returned by express mail to\nInternational Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity 2009, 6:31 http://www.ijbnpa.org/content/6/1/31\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nNHANES, where data were downloaded from the device,\nand the device was checked to determine whether it was\nstill within the manufacturer's calibration specifications\nusing an Actigraph calibrator.\nNHANES used standardized data quality procedures to\nassess the validity and reliability of the accelerometry\ndata, which are described in more detail elsewhere [17]. In\nbrief, participants with at least four days in which the\naccelerometer was worn for at least 600 minutes are\nincluded in analysis. Any block of time greater than or\nequal to 60 minutes where the activity count was equal to\nzero was considered time when the monitor was not\nworn. Based on a previous calibration study by Freedson\nand colleagues, a minute of accelerometer data was coded\nas sedentary if it contained less than 260 activity counts. A\nminute was coded as light physical activity if it recorded\ncoded as moderate-vigorous intensity if activity counts\nduring minutes of light and moderate-vigorous activity\nrespectively, were individually summed and divided by\nthe number of days worn to calculate daily averages for\nthose specific intensities. Total physical activity was the\nsum of the counts derived during minutes of light and\nmoderate-vigorous activity.\nDemographics and Anthropometrics\nParticipants were categorized as non-Hispanic white, non-\nHispanic black, and Hispanic (including Mexican Ameri-\ncan and other Hispanic) based on self-report. Age in years\nwas calculated from self-report. Participants over the age\nof 85 were assigned the age of 85 to protect confidential-\nity. For descriptive purposes, activity was tabulated by age\nIndex (BMI) was calculated (BMI) (kg/m2) from height\nand weight, which were measured at MEC using standard-\nized protocol and equipment. General health status was\nself-reported as excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor.\nData Analyses\nStatistical analyses were performed using STATA 10.0\n(StataCorp Stata Statistical Software: Release 10.1. Stata-\nCorp LP: College Station, TX, 2007). For all analyses, sig-\nnificance was set at an alpha level of <0.05. Unadjusted\nvalues were calculated stratified by sex, race/ethnicity and\nage groups. Generalized linear modeling using the log\nlink function was performed to compare total, light, and\nmoderate-vigorous activity counts by sex and race/ethnic\ngroups adjusting for age and age-squared because it's non-\nlinear relationship with physical activity. To determine\nwhether there were interactions between age and race in\neither males or females interaction terms were added to\nthe models. All analysis took into account the complex\nsurvey design of NHANES, which includes weighting,\nstratification and clustering.\nResults\nDemographic characteristics of the 2,688 participants are\npresented in Table 1. Participants were stratified by sex\nand race/ethnicity to form six groups that consisted of\nwhite men, black men, Hispanic men and white women,\nblack women and Hispanic women. As a group, Hispanic\nmen and women on average appeared to be younger than\ntheir white and black counterparts. The majority of the\nparticipants in the study were in good or very good health\nwhich is reflective of inclusion criteria because we whose\nphysical activity may possibly be limited by underlying\nconditions.\nAge-adjusted physical activity counts by race/ethnicity\nand gender are presented in Table 2. Hispanic men\nappeared to have both higher age-adjusted total and light\nactivity counts compared to white and black men (p <\n0.01).

The most striking findings were the relatively\nTable 1: Descriptive characteristics of the study population stratified by sex\nMale Female\nWhite\nBlack\nHispanic\nWhite\nBlack\nHispanic\nGeneral characteristics\nHealth Status (%)\nWear time\n(mean min/day)\nAll values are means + standard deviations unless labeled otherwise\nTable 2: Daily age-adjusted activity counts (thousands) by intensity level and by sex and race\nHispanic White Black p-value\nMEN\nModerate-Vigorous Physical Activity 106.6\nWOMEN\nModerate-Vigorous Physical Activity 55.7\nAll values are means (95% confidence intervals)\nInternational Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity 2009, 6:31 http://www.ijbnpa.org/content/6/1/31\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nhigher amounts of physical activity among Hispanic men\nand women compared to their male and female counter-\nparts.\nThis current effort indentified a pattern of higher physical\nactivity levels in Hispanic men compared to white and\nblack men. The results also indicate that Hispanic women\nengage in more light physical activity compared to their\nwhite and black counterparts. This is in contrast to previ-\nous results from national surveys, which have indicated\nthat Hispanic men and women are less active compared to\ntheir white and black counterparts. Results from the\nwomen reported greater amounts of inactivity than white\nmen and women [19]. However, the pattern of higher\nobjectively measured physical activity in Hispanic men\nwas also shown in a study by Bennett et al which showed\nhigher pedometer step counts for Hispanic men com-\npared to their white and black counterparts, though not\nreaching significance [20]. A previous paper by Troiano et\nal using NHANES accelerometry data also showed that\nHispanic men and women were more active than white\nand black men and women at moderate-to-vigorous levels\nof intensity [6]. This effort expands on the work by Troi-\nano by including total activity encompassing all levels of\nintensity and comes to the same conclusion. Another\neffort using the NHANES population was conducted by\nMatthews et al which looked at time spent in sedentary\nactivity using the accelerometer [21]. The results of the\nstudy indicated that Hispanic men and women spent less\ntime in sedentary activity than their white and black coun-\nterparts.\nAdditionally, physical activity was found to be inversely\nassociated with age at all levels of intensity in all racial/\nethnic groups with the exception of Hispanic women. This\nfinding is consistent with results of previous studies using\nsubjective data [22,23] suggesting a general pattern of\ndecreasing physical activity levels with increasing age. This\nfinding is also in line with the National Health Interview\nSurvey (NHIS) which showed that adults in the 65+ years\nage group were about five times more likely than adults in\nthe 18\u00ad24 years age group to report never being physical\nactive [24]. Likewise, results from the Behavioral Risk Fac-\ntor Surveillance System (BRFSS) indicated that 35% of\nmen and 54% of women aged 75+ years reported engag-\ning in no physical activity compared to 15% of men and\nno physical activity [19]. A national representative study\nof Swedish adults by Hagstromer et al, using accelerome-\ntery, also noted that physical activity levels decreased with\nto be more physically active than women across all age\ngroups with the exception of Hispanic women in the mid-\ndle age group. There were no significant differences in\ntotal, light, or moderate-vigorous activity when compar-\n0.61 respectively) in the middle age group. These findings\nTable 3: Daily physical activity counts (thousands) by intensity level and by sex, race and age groups\nMale Female\nPhysical Activity Level Age Hispanics Whites Blacks Hispanics Whites Blacks\nModerate-Vigorous Physical\nActivity\nSignificant differences in activity counts by gender are indicated with bold print\nAll values are means and 95% confidence interval\nInternational Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity 2009, 6:31 http://www.ijbnpa.org/content/6/1/31\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nneed further investigation into what factors cause higher\nlevels of activity in Hispanic women in the middle age\ngroup.\nThere are important limitations worth noting when inter-\npreting accelerometry data. Accelerometers do not pro-\nvide qualitative information on what types of physical\nactivities are being performed (household, transportation,\nleisure, etc.). Future studies will be needed to identify the\nspecific areas in which Hispanic male and females accu-\nmulate more activity than their white and black counter-\nparts. Accelerometers are also unable to capture upper\narm movement. Thus, a portion of activity can be missed\n(e.g. weight lifting). Walking gait must also be taken into\nconsideration because it can affect the validity of acceler-\nometer counts, especially in older adults. For example,\nsome accelerometers are more likely to undercount activ-\nity in adults with a non-standard gait [25]. This bias\nshould be minimal because we excluded individuals\nwhose physical activity would likely be affected by illness\nor health status.\nConclusion\nThe current study is one of only a few studies utilizing an\nobjective assessment of physical activity in a large repre-\nsentative sample of U.S. adults. Findings from this study\nwill serve as a basis for comparison of objectively meas-\nured physical activity across sex and racial/ethnic groups\nin future efforts. It is important to be able to identify pock-\nets of the population that are currently inactive to be able\nto focus future intervention efforts. The reasons that cer-\ntain groups may be inactive may be are likely multi-facto-\nrial and may be related to many factors including socio-\neconomic factors and the built environment which are\nnot identified in this study. Furthermore, this study iden-\ntifies the need to use objective measures of physical activ-\nity in situations where the contribution of light intensity\nand/or unstructured physical activity cannot be assumed\nhomogenous within the population of interest.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nMH contributed to the design of the manuscript as well as\nthe analysis and interpretation of data.
