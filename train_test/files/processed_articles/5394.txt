Previous cross-sectional research by Hone, Carter, and McCullough\n(2013) replicated well-established sex differences in drinking game behaviors (i.e., that\nmen are more active drinking game participants than are women) and university drinking\nproblems more generally. Hone et al. (2013) also found that these male-specific behavioral\npatterns are attributable in part to the fact that men's generally unrestricted sexual\nstrategies, plus their social competitiveness, motivate them to participate in drinking games\nto display their fortitude and compete with same-sex rivals. Here, the authors conducted a\nstudy to evaluate with greater causal rigor whether sex differences in sexual restrictedness\nand social competitiveness--and sex differences in motivations for participating in\ndrinking games in particular--are partially responsible for the sex differences in university\nstudents' drinking game behaviors and drinking problems. Sex differences in changes in\nfrequency of drinking game participation were partially mediated by competitive\nmotivations for participating in drinking games and by the effects of social competitiveness\non competitive drinking game motivation. These findings lend additional support to the\nproposition that participation in drinking games is motivated in part by their suitability as a\nvenue for sexual competition in university students' day-to-day lives.\n",

Drinking games are one of the most popular venues in which heavy episodic\ndrinking takes place for university students, and drinking game participation is one of the\nbest predictors of students' heavy episodic drinking and blood alcohol levels while drinking\n(Clapp et al., 2003; Clapp, Won Min, Shillington, Reed, and Ketchie Croff, 2008; Douglas,\nFurthermore, participation in drinking games is responsible for many of the\nnegative consequences associated with heavy episodic drinking in general (Cameron et al.,\nStockwell, 2007). Nevertheless, up to 77% of university students report having participated\nin drinking games, even though they are generally well aware of the attendant risks\nKlichine, and Ascolese, 2005). Explaining why people do things that they know are bad for\nthem is not only a psychological puzzle, but a biological one as well, so theories that can\naccount for young people's motivations to participate in drinking games (along with other\nrisk behaviors) have the potential to advance theory about the evolutionary foundations of\nhuman social behavior. Here we test a functional model of university students' drinking\ngame involvement--based on sexual selection theory--that incorporates well-established\nsex differences in drinking game behaviors and drinking problems as well as sexual\nrestrictedness, social competitiveness, and motivations for participating in drinking games\nWe previously conducted a cross-sectional study in which we modeled sex\ndifferences in students' drinking game behaviors and drinking problems so that we could\nestimate the extent to which these sex differences could be explained as a function of (1)\nsex differences in sexual restrictedness (Simpson and Gangestad, 1991) and social\ncompetitiveness (Simmons, Wehner, Tucker, and King, 1988) as well as (2) sex differences\nin fortitude-display, sexual, and competitive motivations for participating in drinking\ngames in particular (Hone et al., 2013). We found that men's low levels of sexual\nrestrictedness and high levels of social competitiveness were positively related to their\ncompetitive motivation to participate in drinking games, which in turn was positively\nrelated to their frequency of participation in drinking games (Hone et al., 2013). We also\nfound that men's low levels of sexual restrictedness were positively correlated with their\nmotivation to display their fortitude via drinking games, which in turn appeared to correlate\nwith the frequency with which they encountered drinking problems.\nIn the present study, we sought to establish whether the associations that we found\nin our previous cross-sectional study also obtained in a two-wave study. To do so, we\nfollowed up with participants from the original, cross-sectional study and assessed drinking\ngame behaviors and drinking problems at a time point about 12 weeks after the initial data\ncollection. Our rationale for these studies stems from sexual selection theory. Sexual\nselection theory posits that due to asymmetries in parental investment (Trivers, 1972), the\nfitness of females (or, when they are the higher-investing sex, males) is constrained by the\nquality of mates, whereas the fitness of males (or, when they are the lesser investing sex,\nfemales) is constrained by access to mates (Bateman, 1948; Buss and Schmitt, 1993;\nmechanisms plausibly evolved in response to these selection pressures and gave rise to\nSex differences in drinking game participation\nintra- and intersexual competition (Buss and Schmitt, 1993). For example, females from\nmany different species appear to possess preferences for high-investing mates with good\ngenes, whereas males appear to possess motivations to compete for mates and to signal\ntheir mate quality (Buss and Schmitt, 1993).\nFrom this theoretical vantage point, we hypothesized (as have other researchers)\nthat humans seek out venues for intrasexual and intersexual competition--for example,\nthrough conspicuous consumption (Saad, 2007; Saad and Vongas, 2009; Sundie et al.,\n2011), male-male aggression (Daly and Wilson, 1988), displays of generosity (Iredale, Van\nVugt, and Dunbar, 2008), and athletic competition (Miller, Maner, and McNulty, 2012).\nWe think the fit of this hypothesis to drinking games is, at the outset, quite tight: Students'\nexplicit motivations for participating in drinking games are often both competitive (i.e.,\nstudents cite, \"because I want to win\" as a reason to participate) and sexual (i.e., students\nreport participating, \"in order to have sex with someone;\" Borsari, 2004; Johnson, 2002;\nJohnson, Hamilton, and Sheets, 1999; Johnson and Sheets, 2004). Moreover, drinking\ngames enable male players to compete with other men in the presence of female players,\nwho also participate and take an interest in the games' outcomes (Borsari, 2004; Borsari,\nuniversity students find drinking games appealing because they, too, provide a venue for\nmale intrasexual competition and female intersexual choice.\nWe expect that students should seek out drinking games as venues for sexual\ncompetition, but also that they should increase in their frequencies of doing so upon\nentering college when this venue is newly available to them (e.g., their parents are no\nlonger capable of closely monitoring their behavior) and when other venues for excessive\ndrinking (e.g., bars and venues only available to those of the legal drinking age) remain\nunavailable to them. In line with this rationale, data suggest that increases in frequency of\nalcohol use and binge drinking are correlated with leaving home and going to college, and\nthat students high in sensation-seeking exhibit the greatest increases (White et al., 2006).\nFurthermore, moving away from home is associated with an increase in heavy episodic\ndrinking, with those who are also enrolled in college (where drinking games are played)\nexperiencing the sharpest increases (White et al., 2006). Thus, we think there is good\nreason to expect meaningful individual differences in how students' drinking-related\nbehaviors change during their first few semesters of college.\nPredictions\nBased on previous cross-sectional findings that men participate in drinking games\nmore frequently and experience more drinking problems than do women, and that these sex\ndifferences are mediated by men's low levels of sexual restrictedness, high levels of social\ncompetitiveness, and motivations for participating in drinking games (Hone et al., 2013),\nwe made the following predictions. We predicted that men would increase in drinking\ngame behaviors and drinking problems between Phase 1 and Phase 2, relative to women,\nover a 12-week period. Additionally, we predicted that these sex differences in increases\nwould be mediated by sex differences in sexual restrictedness and social competitiveness\n(Ahlgren and Johnson, 1979; Simpson and Gangestad, 1991). We furthermore predicted\nthat the mediation of sex differences in drinking game behaviors and drinking problems via\nsex differences in sexual restrictedness and social competitiveness would themselves be\nSex differences in drinking game participation\nmediated by sex differences in people's espousal of fortitude-display, sexual, and\ncompetitive motivations for participating in drinking games specifically.\nTo test these predictions, we used structural equation models in Mplus (Version 6;\nMuth\u00e9n and Muth\u00e9n, 2010) that enabled us to evaluate whether the direct effects of sex on\nincreases in drinking game behaviors and drinking problems were mediated by sexual\nrestrictedness and social competitiveness, as well as fortitude-display, sexual, and\ncompetitive motivations for participating in drinking games. We also set out to test whether\nthese indirect effects of sex on increases in drinking game behaviors and drinking problems\nvia individual differences in sexual restrictedness and social competitiveness themselves\nwere due to their intermediate effects on fortitude-display, sexual, and competitive\nmotivations for participating in drinking games.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nParticipants were 263 students from the University of Miami who were enrolled in\nIntroductory Psychology in the fall of 2010 and the spring of 2011, who reported drinking\nand participating in drinking games at least occasionally (that is, participants who indicated\n\"I do not play drinking games\" were excluded from analyses), and who provided data on\nboth measurement occasions. The sample comprised 133 women aged 17 to 23 (M \u00b1 SD =\nnot report their sex. Students aged 18 and older provided written documentation of\ninformed consent. We obtained parental consent for students under 18 years of age.\nParticipants obtained course credit for participating. The study was approved by the\nUniversity of Miami's Institutional Review Board.\nProcedure\nData were collected at two time points (Phase 1 and Phase 2, respectively). During\nthe first few weeks of both semesters, we administered a battery of questionnaires to\nparticipants. Approximately 12 weeks later, during the last week of both semesters, we\nprovided students with a link to an online survey that contained the same questionnaires,\nwhich they completed a second time.\nMeasures\nSexual restrictedness and social competitiveness. We measured sexual\nrestrictedness via the Sociosexual Orientation Inventory at Phase 1 (SOI; Simpson and\nGangestad, 1991). The SOI score comprises seven weighted and aggregated items that\nmeasure individual differences in sexual restrictedness. In this sample, reliability of the SOI\nwas acceptable ( = 0.86). We measured social competitiveness at Phase 1 with three\nitems, endorsed on a 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree)\nfrom the Cooperative/Competitive Strategy Scale (Simmons et al., 1988). These items\nrepresent the use of competition to both motivate and achieve success as opposed to the use\nof cooperation to motivate and achieve success, or the avoidance of achieving success\nthrough competition. Reliability of the social competitiveness subscale was acceptable ( =\nSex differences in drinking game participation\nMotivations for participating in drinking games. We measured students' fortitude-\ndisplay, sexual, and competitive motivations for participating in drinking games via nine\nLikert-type self-report items (Hone et al., 2013). Items were rated on a 5-point scale (1 =\nstrongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree), including an option to select the statement, \"I do not\nplay drinking games.\" The fortitude-display motivation comprised the items, \"I like to play\ndrinking games that show who can go the longest without passing out,\" \"...that show who\ncan last the longest without throwing up,\" and \"... in which sometimes people need to be\nput to bed.\" The sexual motivation factor comprised the items, \"I like to play drinking\ngames that give me an opportunity to have fun with people I'd like to have sex with,\"\n\"...that loosen people up for fooling around or having sex later,\" and \"that give me an\nopportunity to hit on people I'm interested in.\" Finally, the competitive motivation factor\ncomprised the items, \"I like to play drinking games in which people are really serious about\nwinning,\" \"...that have clear winners and losers,\" and \"...in which people get teased or\nrespected depending on how they played.\" Reliability of these factors was acceptable\n(Fortitude-display motivation:  = 0.81; sexual motivation:  = 0.90; competitive\nDrinking game behaviors and drinking problems. At Phase 1 and Phase 2, we used\ntwo Likert-type self-report items to measure frequency of drinking game participation and\nquantity of alcohol consumed during drinking game participation. The item \"How often do\nyou play drinking games?\" was endorsed on an 8-point scale (0 = never, 7 = daily or\nalmost daily) and the item, \"How much alcohol do you tend to consume when you play\ndrinking games (\"drink\" = 1 beer or 1 shot)?\" was endorsed on a 6-point scale (0 = none, 5\n= seven or more drinks). We also used six items from the Alcohol Use Disorders\nIdentification Test to measure students' drinking problems at Phase 1 and Phase 2 (Babor,\nHiggins-Biddle, Saunders, and Monteiro, 2001). Reliability of the six-item version of the\nAUDIT was acceptable (Phase 1:  = 0.78; Phase 2:  = 0.83). We specified causal paths\nfrom these three scores at Phase 1 to their corresponding scores at Phase 2 so that the\nremaining variance in the respective Phase 2 scores could be conceptualized as measures of\nresidualized change over the 12-week period (Cronbach and Furby, 1970). This is\nanalogous to regressing Phase 2 scores on Phase 1 scores and then assessing the\nrelationship between the predictor variables and these residuals. We conducted independent\nsamples t-tests (corrected for multiple comparisons; see Table 1) to assess sex differences\nin these key outcome variables for the study.\nTable 1.

Excluding these two variables as outcomes did not influence the direct\nor indirect path coefficients from sex to the residualized change score measure of frequency\nof drinking game participation that we report here (see Table 2).\nTable 2.

We then\nSex differences in drinking game participation\nspecified paths from sex, to sexual restrictedness and social competitiveness, to fortitude-\ndisplay, sexual, and competitive motivations, and to frequency of drinking game\nparticipation at Phase 2, controlling for participation at Phase 1 (paths from independent\nvariables to frequency at Phase 1 were not specified; see Figure 1). According to the\nmodification indices, some residual variances of drinking game items that comprise the\ndrinking game motivations were specified to correlate with each other (see Table 3), which\nimproved model fit (see Table 4).\nFigure 1.

The chi square test of model fit to these data was\nanalysts typically complement this fit statistic with a variety of other indices for assessing\nmodel fit. A Comparative Fit Index of 0.94 indicated that the proposed model provided a\nbetter fit than a baseline model (Hu and Bentler, 1999; Schreiber, Stage, King, Nora, and\nBarlow, 2006). In contrast, the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation statistic was\n0.07, with a lower bound confidence interval value of 0.06 and an upper bound confidence\ninterval value of 0.08, suggesting that a close-fit hypothesis could not be retained, although\nthe poor-fit hypothesis could be rejected (Browne and Cudeck, 1993). Finally, a\nStandardized Root Mean Residual of 0.09 was obtained, indicating that the average residual\nof the difference between the observed and proposed variance/covariance matrix was\nacceptable and, thus, that the model provided decent explanatory power (Hu and Bentler,\nSex differences in drinking game participation\nTable 3. Correlated residuals\n\"I like to play drinking games\nthat show who can last the\nlongest without throwing up.\"\nwith\n\"I like to play drinking games in which\nsometimes people need to be put to bed.\"\nwith\n\"I like to play drinking games that show who\ncan go the longest without passing out.\"\n\"I like to play drinking games\nthat have clear winners and\nlosers.\"\nwith\n\"I like to play drinking games in which people\nare really serious about winning.\"\nwith\n\"I like to play drinking games in which people\nget teased or respected depending on how they\nplayed.\"\n\"I like to play drinking games\nthat give me an opportunity to\nhit on people I'm interested\nin.\"\nwith\n\"I like to play drinking games that give me an\nopportunity to have fun with people I'd like to\nhave sex with.\"\nTogether, the six predictors in the model (sex, sexual restrictedness, social\ncompetitiveness, and the three drinking game motivations) accounted for 45% of the\nvariance in residualized change score in frequency of drinking game participation. Eight\npercent of the variation in residualized change score in frequency of drinking game\nparticipation was accounted for uniquely by sexual restrictedness, social competitiveness,\nand the three drinking game motivations at Phase 1.\nTable 4. Model fit with and without correlated residuals\nWith Correlated\nResiduals\nWithout Correlated\nResiduals\nMediation of sex differences in changes in frequency of drinking game participation\nWe found evidence that competitive motivation for participating in drinking games\npartially mediated the sex difference in the residualized change score measure of frequency\nof drinking game participation (see Figure 2). This two-step mediational path suggests that\ncompetitive motivation for participating in drinking games helps account for why men had\nhigher residualized change scores in drinking game participation over the 12-week period\nthan did women.\nWe also found a significant indirect effect of sex on residualized change scores in\nfrequency of drinking game participation via social competitiveness that was itself\nmediated by the indirect effect of social competitiveness on competitive motivation to\nparticipate in drinking games (see Figure 3). This three-step mediational path suggests that\nSex differences in drinking game participation\nsex differences in social competitiveness appeared to cause increases in competitive\nmotivation for participating in drinking games specifically, which in turn increased men's\nparticipation in drinking games, relative to women, over the 12-week period.\nFigure 2.

Solid lines indicate direct effects.\nDashed lines indicate indirect effects.\nIn a reduced model in which we predicted residualized changes in frequency of\ndrinking game participation with (1) sex, (2) social competitiveness, and (3) competitive\nmotivation for participating in drinking games in particular, the sex difference in the\nresidualized change score measure of drinking game participation was reduced to a very\nsuggests that sex differences in competitive motivation explained virtually all of the\nmeaningful sex differences in drinking game participation.\nDiscussion\nBecause females likely possess evolved systems that generate motivation to seek\nhigh-quality mates and males likely possess evolved systems that motivate them to compete\ncompetitive in nature (Johnson, 2002; Johnson and Sheets, 2004)--we hypothesized that\nuniversity students use drinking games as a venue for sexual competition (Hone et. al,\n2013). In the two-wave study presented here, we found that men increased their frequency\nSex differences in drinking game participation\nof drinking game participation, relative to women, in part because they were more\nmotivated than women were to participate in such games for competitive reasons, and\nbecause they were more socially competitive in general than were women. Specifically, we\nfound that the sex difference in changes in frequency of drinking game participation was\nreduced to nearly zero when social competitiveness and competitive drinking game\nmotivations were taken into account. To our knowledge, this study is the first to test an\nevolutionary-functional explanation for sex differences in drinking game behavior--\nindeed, in any risk behavior--using two-wave data, which enables better tests of causal\nhypotheses than cross-sectional data can provide (Finkel, 1995).\nImplications\nIn addition to the present study's value for shedding light on the possible functional\nbases of risk-taking behavior during adolescence and early adulthood, our results might\nhave public health implications: Because men's competitiveness is related to increases in\nhow frequently they participate in drinking games, there might be value in university\npolicies that identify and target particularly competitive individuals (e.g., student athletes)\nor venues and occasions on which competitive motivation is likely to be high (around\nmajor sporting events or competitive events within or between fraternities) for\ninterventions that take into consideration the competitive aspects of drinking games\n(Grossbard, Geisner, Neighbors, Kilmer, and Larimer, 2007). Previous interventions that\nstress the negative consequences associated with risky behavior and drinking games are\nlargely unsuccessful and may inadvertently increase participation among competitive men\nbecause drinking games (and risk behaviors) are attractive to some men as a venue for\ncompetition (Hone et al., 2013). Consequently, interventions should seek to frame the risks\nand consequences associated with drinking games in a way that discourages participation,\nrather than inadvertently encourages it. It cannot be taken for granted that warning young\npeople of the dangers will not have unintended negative consequences for drinking game\nparticipation.\nLimitations\nThe two-wave nature of our data set enabled a more rigorous examination of\ncausation than what is possible in cross-sectional studies, but a study with even more\nfrequent within-subject sampling would have allowed for better analysis of cause and effect\nrelationships. Evaluating changes in students' drinking game behaviors and drinking\nproblems over three or more time points would enable the use of latent growth curve\nmodels and better estimation of missing data. In addition, collecting data at three or more\ntime points within even shorter time frames would enable researchers to examine the social\nprecipitants of short-term changes in drinking game behavior (Larson and\nCsikszentmihalyi, 1983). Furthermore, future studies examining not only the between-sex\ndifferences we studied here but within-sex differences as well (e.g., differences within\nfemales; Zamboanga, Bean, Pietras, and Pab\u00f3n, 2005) could help to explain why some men\nand women participate in drinking games more so than do their same-sex peers. In the same\nvein, because drinking game involvement poses more hazards for women than for men,\nexamining women's unique motivations for participating in drinking games (even though\nthey participate considerably less frequently than do men) in future studies would also be\nuseful (Pedersen and LaBrie, 2006; Zamboanga, Leitkowski, Rodr\u00edguez, and Cascio, 2006).\nSex differences in drinking game participation\nThe addition of objective measures of social competitiveness and sexual\nrestrictedness might also improve future studies assessing drinking game behaviors (e.g.,\nvia a laboratory situation in which men compete with a confederate to win a lunch date\nwith an attractive woman; Gangestad, Simpson, Cousins, Garver-Apgar, and Christensen,\n2004). Despite these limitations, we believe the findings we report here support conclusions\ndrawn from cross-sectional data and provide another step toward elucidating the functional\nbases of risk-taking behavior (Daly and Wilson, 2005; Hill and Chow, 2002; Kruger and\nConclusion\nDrinking games are associated with many negative consequences, yet a majority of\nuniversity students report participating in drinking games--especially for sexual and\net al., 2005). Students are aware of the negative consequences of drinking, so why do they\ntake part? Our results suggest that this puzzle can be solved, at least in part, by taking into\naccount the sexually selected differences in men's and women's appetites for competition\n1972). Drinking games might productively be conceptualized as a culturally sanctioned\nvenue in which young people can enact their sexually selected motivations to compete with\neach other. Understanding the causes of drinking game behavior and drinking problems is\nalso a puzzle for public health (Carman, Fitzgerald, and Holmgren, 1983; DHHS, 2007), so\nwe are cautiously optimistic that research such as ours, which points to a possible\nfunctional basis for young people's attraction to such activities, might find some use in\napplied work as well.\nReferences\nAhlgren, A., and Johnson, D.
