An MNE's labor demand responds to\ninternational wage differentials at the extensive margin, when the MNE expands into a\nforeign market, and at the intensive margin, when the MNE operates existing affiliates\nand chooses employment. The authors derive novel parametric and nonparametric\nestimation models to distinguish between the formation of MNEs at the extensive\nmargin and the operation of MNEs at the intensive margin. The methods extend the\nexisting literature on selectivity to the case of multiple simultaneous choices.\nUsing comprehensive data on German manufacturing MNEs and their majority-owned\nforeign manufacturing affiliates, the paper finds permanent wage differentials to have a\nstrong impact on multinational labor substitution both at the extensive and the intensive\nmargin---contrary to much of the earlier empirical literature on MNEs. Results point to\nlarge sunk entry and exit costs so that MNE expansions are infrequent but, when\nundertaken, have a sizeable impact on labor demand. Home and foreign employment are\nsubstitutes within MNEs at both margins. Cross-wage elasticities at the extensive margin\nare about half the size of elasticities at the intensive margin in locations close to home.\nFor overseas developing country wages, however, elasticities are significantly different\nfrom zero only at the extensive margin. Elasticity estimates at both margins are robust\nacross different samples and wage data, specifications, and parametric and nonparamet-\nric estimation techniques.\nThe authors evaluate the counterfactual question how many jobs MNEs would reallocate\nin response to shrinking wage differentials. With a one-percent drop in German wages,\nGerman MNEs would cut 2,000 manufacturing jobs in Central and Eastern Europe\n(CEE) at the presence-establishing extensive margin, for instance, and withdraw 4,000\njobs overall. A converse one-percent increase in CEE wages is associated with an overall\nreturn of 730 MNE jobs to Germany. These are sizeable figures. Wages in CEE are, on\naverage, about ten percent of the German level in 2000. If the estimated elasticities of\nsubstitution were constant at all levels of wages, an increase in CEE wages of 450% to\nmanufacturing jobs to Germany---about a quarter of the estimated home employment at\nGerman manufacturing MNEs. Removing international wage differentials is, of course,\nnot a policy-relevant counterfactual exercise. Per-capita incomes converge across\nregions at half times of more than thirty years. The authors indicate in their concluding\nremarks that a future estimation method will assess whether worker displacements are\nsignificantly lower at MNEs than at non-MNEs.\nNicht-technische Zusammenfassung\nDauerhafte internationale Lohnunterschiede beeinflussen die Besch\u00e4ftigung in multinatio-\nnalen Unternehmen (MU) an zwei kritischen Grenzen (margins). Die Arbeitsnachfrage\neines MUs reagiert auf Lohnunterschiede an der extensiven Grenze, wenn ein MU in einen\nAuslandsmarkt expandiert, und an der intensiven Grenze, wenn ein MU bestehende\nAuslandst\u00f6chter betreibt. Die Autoren leiten neue parametrische und nicht-parametrische\nSch\u00e4tzverfahren her, um zwischen der MU-Ausweitung an der extensiven Grenze und dem\nMU-Betrieb an der intensiven Grenze zu unterscheiden. Die Sch\u00e4tzverfahren erweitern die\nbestehende Literatur zu Selektivit\u00e4tskorrekturen um den Fall mehrerer gleichzeitiger\nEntscheidungen.\nAuf der Grundlage von umfassenden Daten zu Auslandst\u00f6chtern im\nverarbeitenden Gewerbe und deren M\u00fcttern im deutschen verarbeitenden Gewerbe ermittelt\ndas vorliegende Arbeitspapier, dass dauerhafte Lohnunterschiede die Arbeitssubstitution in\nmultinationalen Unternehmen sowohl an der extensiven als auch an der intensiven Grenze\nerheblich beeinflussen - im Gegensatz zu einem gro\u00dfen Teil der bestehenden empirischen\nStudien. Die Ergebnisse deuten auf umfangreiche fixe Marktzutritts- und -austrittskosten\nhin, so dass Expansionen selten sind, aber, wenn unternommen, erhebliche Besch\u00e4fti-\ngungswirkungen im MU mit sich bringen. Inlands- und Auslandsbesch\u00e4ftigung sind\nSubstitute an beiden Grenzen. In an Deutschland angrenzenden Regionen sind Lohnelasti-\nzit\u00e4ten an der extensiven Grenze etwa halb so gro\u00df wie Lohnelastizit\u00e4ten an der intensiven\nGrenze. In au\u00dfereurop\u00e4ischen Entwicklungsl\u00e4ndern dagegen sind ausschlie\u00dflich\nLohnelastizit\u00e4ten an der extensiven Grenze statistisch signifikant. Die gesch\u00e4tzten\nLohnelastizit\u00e4ten an beiden Grenzen sind robust gegen\u00fcber zahlreichen Sch\u00e4tzstichproben\nund unter Einbezug alternativer Lohndaten, Spezifikationen und parametrischer sowie\nnicht-parametrischer Verfahren.\nDie Autoren bewerten, wie viele Arbeitspl\u00e4tze in MU umgruppiert w\u00fcrden,\nwenn die internationalen Lohnunterschiede schrumpften. Auf eine ein-prozentige\nLohnsenkung in Deutschland hin w\u00fcrden deutsche MU 2.000 Arbeitspl\u00e4tze in Mittel- und\nOsteuropa (MOE) an der extensiven Grenze abschaffen, und insgesamt 4.000 MOE-\nArbeitspl\u00e4tze abbauen. Eine entgegengesetzte ein-prozentige Lohnerh\u00f6hung in MOE geht\nmit einem Aufbau von 730 Arbeitspl\u00e4tzen in Deutschland einher. Die Gr\u00f6\u00dfenordnung\ndieser Reaktionen ist erheblich. L\u00f6hne in MOE liegen im Schnitt des Jahres 2000 bei etwa\nzehn Prozent des deutschen Niveaus. Angenommen die gesch\u00e4tzten Lohnelastizit\u00e4ten\nblieben konstant, so w\u00fcrde eine Lohnerh\u00f6hung in MOE um 450 Prozent (eine Verminde-\nrung des Lohnunterschieds zu Deutschland um die H\u00e4lfte) zu einem Aufbau von 330.000\n(= 730 \u00b7 450) Arbeitspl\u00e4tzen im deutschen verarbeitenden Gewerbe f\u00fchren; das entspricht\netwa einem Viertel der gesch\u00e4tzten Gesamtbesch\u00e4ftigung in deutschen MU-M\u00fcttern des\nverarbeitenden Gewerbes.

Sur-\nprisingly, however, the operation of MNEs has rarely been found to affect factor\ndemands across locations (e.g. Slaughter (2000) for U.S., Konings (2004) for Eu-\nropean MNEs). We quantify the effect of permanent wage differentials on MNE\nemployment at two critical margins. An MNE's labor demand responds to in-\nternational wage differentials at the extensive margin, when the MNE expands\ninto a foreign market, and at the intensive margin, when the MNE operates ex-\nisting affiliates and chooses employment. Our paper thus offers an integration of\ntwo strands of the empirical literature--one on MNEs' location choices (Devereux\nSlaughter 2005)--into a unified estimation framework.\nThe MNE's two-stage decision, to first expand (extensive margin) and then\noperate (intensive margin), has a well-defined econometric counterpart in sample\nselection. Aside from the economic interpretation of the extensive margin, labor\ndemand or cost function estimates at the intensive margin are subject to selectiv-\nity bias unless corrected. Using comprehensive data on German manufacturing\nMNEs and their majority-owned foreign manufacturing affiliates, we find that an\nMNE's propensity to select a foreign location is a salient predictor of its labor de-\nmand across locations and that permanent wage differentials have a strong impact\non multinational labor substitution both at the extensive and the intensive margin.\nA methodological contribution of our paper is to extend the univariate sample\nselection case to one of multiple selections. We derive conditions under which the\nThe authors thank Gordon Hanson, Xiaohong Chen, Peter Egger, Sebastian Kessing and Hal\nWhite as well as seminar and conference participants at UCLA, TU Dresden, HU Berlin, U\nT\u00a8\nubingen, the German Economic Association's annual meetings, the ECB, the OECD, UC Davis,\nUC Santa Cruz, and the NBER for insightful suggestions.

We also prove identification of a nonparametric se-\nlection model, which extends single-equation models (such as those in Das, Newey\nand Vella (2003)) to the multivariate case. The nonparametric estimator is simple\nto implement in a two-stage approach and is applicable to the estimation of multi-\nvariate demand systems in general (for a recent parametric approach to multivariate\nTo quantify the extensive margin, we base our parametric and non-parametric\nestimators of location selection on MNE-wide profit maximization. Existing firm-\nlevel studies on the expansion of MNEs do not find low wages or low per-capita\nincomes to be significant predictors of location choice (e.g. Devereux and Griffith\n(1998) for U.S., Head and Mayer (2004) for Japanese, Buch, Kleinert, Lipponer and\nToubal (2005) for German MNEs).1 Multinomial logit estimation turns wages into\nsignificant predictors of location choice in Disdier and Mayer (2004) for French\nMNEs, and in Becker, Ekholm, J\u00a8\nackle and Muendler (2005) for Swedish MNEs\nand the same German MNEs as in this paper. But multinomial logit estimation\nrests on the assumption that independent agents within the MNE decide on distinct\ninvestment projects; that is incompatible with MNE-wide profit maximization. De-\nvereux and Griffith (1998) estimate multinomial logit choice and, to be consistent\nwith MNE-wide optimization, restrict their sample to MNEs who invest in only one\nlocation abroad; they do not find wages to be significant predictors of U.S. MNEs'\nlocation choices. In contrast, when we condition on an MNE's past presence and its\ninteraction with wages, we find wage variables to be statistically significant predic-\ntors of location choices in probit and in non-parametric selection regressions. When\nweighted with the impact of location selection on employment, wage differentials\nacross locations are substantial predictors of labor substitution within MNEs at the\nextensive margin.\nAt the intensive margin, the world's ten largest MNEs in 2000 produce almost\none percent of world GDP, and the one hundred largest MNEs are responsible for\nmore than four percent of world GDP.2 Despite this apparent importance of MNEs\nfor international transactions, Slaughter (2000) reports that, in a sample of U.S.\n1Carr, Markusen and Maskus (2001) find evidence in aggregate data that relatively abundant\nhigh-skilled labor is a significant predictor of foreign direct investment (FDI) of U.S. MNEs (and\nBlonigen, Davies and Head (2003) find that larger skill differentials predict less foreign MNE activ-\nity).\nMNEs, operations in low-wage locations have no detectable impact on MNE em-\nployment in the home market. In contrast, Feenstra and Hanson (1999) attributed\nabout a third of U.S. relative wage changes to outsourcing (within MNEs or across\nfirms). Similar to Slaughter (2000), Konings (2004) and Barba Navaretti and Castel-\nlani (2004) find no evidence for the hypothesis that operations of European MNEs in\nlow-wage locations have an impact on home-market labor demand. Braconier and\nEkholm (2000) and Marin (forthcoming) estimate wage elasticities of labor demand\nand intermediate imports from Central and Eastern Europe for Western European\nMNEs, and report no significant effect of foreign relative wages. Brainard and Riker\n(2001), however, do find that foreign affiliate employment substitutes modestly for\nU.S. parent employment but less so than for employment across foreign locations.3\nHanson et al. (2005) shift focus from factor demands to intermediate input uses and,\nas an exception to most prior firm-level evidence, report that affiliates of U.S. MNEs\nprocess significantly more intra-firm imports the lower are low-skilled wages. The\nresult challenges the view that relative abundance in low-skilled labor fails to attract\nMNEs. We revisit their result in the context of multinational labor substitution and\nextend the estimation framework to incorporate location choice. When controlling\nfor the propensity to select a foreign location, wages are statistically significant and\neconomically salient predictors of MNEs' labor demands at the intensive margin.\nOur findings point to large sunk entry and exit costs so that MNE expansions (or\nwithdrawals) are infrequent but, when undertaken, they have a sizeable impact on\nlabor demand. We find cross-wage elasticities at the extensive margin to be strictly\npositive. So, home and foreign employment are substitutes within MNEs not only at\nthe intensive but also at the extensive margin. Elasticities at the extensive margin are\nabout half the size of elasticities at the intensive margin in locations close to home.\nFor overseas developing country wages, however, elasticities are significantly dif-\nferent from zero only at the extensive margin. Bootstraps reject equality between\nthe intensive and the total elasticity of substitution for most locations, corroborating\nthe importance of the extensive margin. Elasticity point estimates at both margins\nare robust across different samples and wage data, specifications, and parametric\nand nonparametric estimation techniques.\nWe evaluate the counterfactual question how many jobs MNEs would reallocate\nin response to shrinking wage differentials. A one-percent drop in German wages\nrelative to the sample-mean level would reduce MNE employment in Central and\n3At the aggregate level, Brainard (1997) does not find relative abundance of low-skilled labor to\nexplain MNE sales patterns across locations.\nEastern Europe (CEE) by around 4,000 jobs, for instance. Similarly, a one-percent\nincrease in CEE wages would bring 730 jobs to Germany. These are sizeable fig-\nures. Wages in CEE are, on average, about 10 percent of the German level in 2000.\nIf the estimated elasticities of substitution were constant at all levels of wages, an\nincrease in CEE wages of 450% to cut the wage gap to Germany in half would\na quarter of the estimated home employment at German manufacturing MNEs.4 Of\ncourse, elasticities of substitution are not constant at all levels of wages so that the\ncounterfactual prediction is crude. We nevertheless view the magnitude as indica-\ntive of the potential importance of multinational labor substitution.\nThis paper has five more sections. Section 2 elaborates a model of the expan-\nsion and operation of MNEs, and Section 3 derives identification conditions for\nits estimation under location selectivity. Section 4 presents the data and discusses\ndescriptive statistics on location choice. Estimation results on multinational labor\nsubstitution are presented in Section 5, and interpreted in counterfactual evaluations.\nSection 6 concludes.\n2 Multinational Expansion and Operation\nLet observed employment yj\nof MNE j at time t in location obey\nyjt\n= xjt\n +\njt\nif MNE j is present at .

In the translog case, the vector xjt\nof em-\nployment predictors includes additively separable transformations of outputs, inputs\nand factor prices (we discuss regressor construction below), including the prevail-\ning wage differentials between locations at time t. jt\nis a disturbance term. So, the\nconditional expectation of MNE j's observed employment in location is\n\u00af\nyjt\n E yjt\nxjt\n, djt\n, zj,t-\n= xjt\n + E\njt\n| djt\n, zj,t-\nwhere the vector djt\nof presence indicators dk\njt\nreflects MNE j's observed pattern\nof locations k = 1, . . . , L at time t (dk\njt\n= 1 if firm j is present in location k and\ndk\njt\n= 0 otherwise) and contains djt\n= 1. The information set zj,t-\nat moment t-\naffects labor demand through the resulting choice of presence in location .\n4If international wage gaps shrink at a similar rate as per capita GDP converges to steady state\nand Germany is close to its steady state, the CEE-German wage gap would take around 35 years to\ncontract to half its present size (Barro and Sala i Martin 1992).\nWe define the extensive margin of labor demand to be the expected labor demand\n\u00af\nyext in location , predicted by a firm j's current choices of presence around the\nworld and its past information set zj,t-\n,\n\u00af\nyext,\njt\n E\njt\njt\n, . . . , djt\n= 1, . . . , dL\njt\n; zj,t-\nwhere the optimal binary choices (d1\njt\n, . . . , djt\n, . . . , dL\njt\n) are functions of MNE j's\ninformation set at the moment of location choice t - , and  is the time it\ntakes an MNE to implement location choices (two to four years, say).

Most important, zj,t-\nincludes the then prevailing\nwage differentials between locations.\nLabor demand at the intensive margin is accordingly defined as\n\u00af\nyint,\njt\n \u00af\nyjt\n- \u00af\nyext,\njt\n= xjt\nThe labor demand effect at the extensive margin \u00af\nyext,\njt\n= E[\njt\n| djt\n] is an additive\ncomponent of conditional labor demand E[yjt\n| xjt\n, djt\n, zj,t-\n]. Economically, an\nMNE's mere presence at a location typically raises the labor demand prediction\nfor that location.5 Statistically, the extensive margin needs to be included in the\nregression to correct for selectivity.\nMNE j produces a vector of location-specific outputs qjt\njt\n, . . . , qL\njt\n) at L\nlocations. We consider MNEs to be price takers in input market, whereas they may\nhave market power in output markets. (We estimate a cost function, so any pricing\nbehavior in the sales market is consistent with our approach.) On the input side, we\nfocus on employment. We view MNEs as wage takers in the local markets, com-\npeting with labor demand from non-tradeable goods sectors and incumbent firms.\nSimilarly, we consider demand for capital goods and intermediate inputs from non-\nMNEs as sufficiently large so that the remaining demand of MNEs for those goods\nhas a negligible price impact.\nFinal goods prices are world-market prices that differentiated products from lo-\ncations = 1, . . . , L can fetch, given product characteristics. Final goods are pro-\nduced with labor and capital. After controlling for location choice in the forma-\ntion of the MNE, we consider installed capital kjt\njt\n, . . . , kL\njt\n) to be a quasi-\nfixed factor in an MNE's short-run cost function Cjt\n(but put to use at locations\n5To be precise, this is true if high home wages raise the probability of presence at a foreign\nlocation and the presence likelihood is positively correlated with labor demand at that foreign\nlocation . Both conditions are satisfied in our MNE sample.\nk = 1, . . . , L to different degrees). We consider labor at locations k = 1, . . . , L\nto be immobile across national borders and its factor prices wt\nt\n, . . . , wL\nt\n) as\nspecific to L locations.\nDefine N\nas the fixed FDI entry costs at location and X\nas the fixed FDI exit\ncosts from location .6 Then, fixed costs of changing presence at location in t,\nanticipated at t - , become\nG (djt\n, dj,t-\n) = N\ndjt\n) + X\n)dj,t-\n,\nwhere djt\nis the indicator for MNE j's current FDI presence at location , and dj,t-\nfor its past presence. We restrict the long-term fixed cost components N\nand X\nto be time invariant in our four-year MNE panel data (but control for time-varying\ncountry and MNE characteristics in selection estimation). The decision-relevant\nfixed cost difference Fj,t-\n G (1, dj,t-\n) - G (0, dj,t-\n) between presence at\nlocation and absence from at time t is\nFj,t-\n= N\n- (X\n+ N\n) dj,t-\nwhere (X\n+ N\n) is sometimes called the hysteresis band and reflects the sunk cost\neffect that induces firms to continue operations at location (Dixit 1989).7\nTo select locations ( years prior to production and sales), MNE j maximizes ex-\npected profits Ej,t-\n[ p(qi=j,t\n, qjt\n) \u00b7 qjt\n- Cjt\n(qjt\n; kjt\n, w)]. This implies that MNE\nj's rule for FDI presence at location can be written as\ndjt\n[p q ,\njt\n] + Ej,t-\n[Cjt\n(qjt\n=0; \u00b7) - Cjt\n(q ,\njt\n; \u00b7)] - Fj,t-\n+j,t-\nj,t-\n) - N\n+ (X\n+N\n) dj,t-\n+ j,t-\n= 1 H(zj,t-\n) + j,t-\n(see Appendix A for a derivation). The unknown function h(z0\nj,t-\n) captures both\nexpected revenues from producing the profit-maximizing quantity q ,\njt\nat location\n6For simplicity, the fixed costs of reentry into a given location after a period of absence are\nassumed to be equal to the costs at first entry \nN\n.\n7Probit estimation with firm-fixed effects is known for problematic performance in panel data\nwith a short time horizon (Heckman 1981). We therefore do not attempt to estimate MNE-specific\nsunk costs of presence Fj,t-\nat location . We distinguish between entry and exit sunk cost com-\nponents to account for MNE-specific differences in Fj,t-\n, similar to Roberts and Tybout's (1997)\nmodel of sunk costs in exporting status.\nand expected cost savings from producing at (see first line). Sunk costs of presence\nat location have an observable component Fj,t-\nby (4) and a disturbance j,t-\n.\nThe disturbance j,t-\nis known to the MNE but not to the researcher. To simplify\nnotation, we write H(zj,t-\nj,t-\n) - N\n+ (X\n+N\n) dj,t-\nand include past\npresence in any location in the information set zj,t-\n.\nEquation (5) is the selection equation: the empirical rule of presence in locations\n= 1, . . . , L. We estimate the rule both parametrically (with a probit regression and\nH(zj,t-\n) = zj,t-\n ) and nonparametrically.\n2.2 Multiproduct cost function\nTo obtain theoretically well-defined estimates of elasticities of labor substitution\nacross locations, we opt for a flexible parametric specification of the MNE's mul-\ntiproduct cost function. We first augment the cost function with parametric correc-\ntions for location selectivity. We then proceed to a model with a parametric cost\nfunction part and a nonparametric correction for selectivity.\nWe use a short-run multiproduct translog cost function to estimate labor de-\nmand, and extend it to control for location selectivity.8 A short-run cost function,\ngiven MNE j's location choice, treats MNE j's vector of capital stocks kjt\nas quasi-\nfixed factors. We prefer a short-run over a long-run cost function because we already\ncontrol for the installation of foreign affiliates through location selectivity (5) and\nbecause the inclusion of capital stock variables captures otherwise unobservable\n(firm-specific) user costs of capital across locations.\nApplying Shepard's (1953) lemma to the short-run multiproduct translog cost\nfunction yields location-specific wage bill shares sjt\n wt\nyjt\n/Cjt\n(the wage bill at\nlocation in the MNE's total wage bill) as functions of (qjt\n; kjt\n, w). We multiply\nthe wage bill shares sjt\nwith observation-specific scalars Cjt\n/wt\nto arrive at our\noutcome equation (labor demand at )\nyjt\n= xjt\n +\njt\n8We follow Brown and Christensen's (1981, eq. 10.21) short-run version of Christensen, Jorgen-\nson and Lau (1973) and extend the framework to multiple products. A main alternative would be\nHall's (1973) generalization of Diewert's (1971) Leontief cost function to the multiproduct case. We\nfavor the translog cost function because its dimensionality requirements are considerably leaner and\npermit higher-order approximations to the nonparametric correction for selectivity. Kohli (1978)\ntook the translog specification to the empirical trade literature.\nwith\nxjt\n =  Cjt\nwt\n+\nL\n\u00b5 m\nln(qm\njt\n)Cjt/wt +  m\nln(km\njt\n)Cjt/wt +  m\nln(wm\nt\n)Cjt/wt\n(see Appendix B), where jt\nis a disturbance.\nCompared to translog regression equations in wage bill shares sjt\n, the transfor-\nmation with observation-specific scalars Cjt\n/wt\nto an equivalent regression of yjt\non xjt\nhas three important advantages. First, there is no constant term among the\nregressors xjt\nso that lacking identification of the constant in a nonparametric selec-\ntion correction is no concern. Second, wages are regressors only and do not enter\nthe dependent variable. Third, labor demand is not bounded above so that, condi-\ntional on xjt\n, the labor demand disturbance satisfies the assumption of a one-sided\ntruncation for (parametric and nonparametric) selectivity correction.\n2.3 Stacking locations with zero output and factor use\nMost MNEs produce in some but not in all locations. For cases of zero output or\ninput, however, equation (6) is not well defined. Especially zero turnover and zero\ncapital stocks require attention because they are MNE-specific, but absence from a\nlocation also suggests dropping wage regressors when no employment occurs.\nOne possible treatment is estimation of separate equation systems for every sin-\ngle presence pattern in the data. The resulting estimators are hard to interpret, how-\never, and plagued by dimensionality: potential presence in up to L - 1 locations\noutside the home location implies that there are up to 2L-1 - 1 regional presence\npatterns for an MNE.9 In the German sample in 2000, for instance, only 57 out\nof 1,770 MNEs are omnipresent in all four world locations while every single one\nof the 15 possible regional presence pattern occurs. So, there would be 15 sets of\nestimates.\nWe choose to stack observations of all MNEs in the sample. Stacking observa-\ntions improves efficiency, collapses the up to 2L-1 - 1 sets of estimates into one\nconsistently estimated (L-1)-equation system, and provides a single L \u00d7 L matrix\nof estimates for wage elasticities of regional labor demands. Stacking is permissible\nunder three conditions: (i) all MNEs face identical sunk cost Fj,t-\nfor presence at\nlocation conditional on their prior presence and information set (so that presence\n9MNEs are present in their home location by sample definition, so only 2L-1 patterns are observ-\nable in principle. Firms that only operate domestically without any foreign affiliate are not MNEs\nby definition so that the single presence pattern with the only presence at the home location must be\nsubtracted.\nis not correlated with inputs); (ii) MNEs face an identical short-run cost function\nCjt\n(\u00b7) = C(\u00b7) in all locations of presence, conditional on their characteristics (so\nthat one common parameter vector is justified); and (iii) the disturbances jt\nare\nuncorrelated across observations.\nWe set all missing location variables for an absent MNE j to zero--that is log\nemployment, turnover, capital stock and wages are zero at location m from where\nMNE j is absent. This is equivalent to interacting the translog cost function coef-\nficients with presence indicators: \u00b5 m\n= 0 when no output is produced at location\nm, and  m\n=  m\n= 0 when MNE j employs no factors at location m. Stacking\ncan induce correlations between the transformed regressors and the error jt\nTo remove this source of potential bias, we include the set of absence indicators\n) (with nuisance parameters \nd\n) among the regressors in the outcome equa-\ntion: yjt\n= xjt\njt\n) \nd\n. The set of absence indicators (1-djt\n)\nalso offsets the zero output prediction at the sample mean.\n3 Estimation under Location Selectivity\nThe selection equation (5) for location is\ndjt\n= 1 H(zj,t-\n) + j,t-\nand, conditional on MNE j's selection of location , expectations of the outcome (6)\nare\nE yjt\n| xjt\n, djt\n, zj,t-\n= xjt\n + E\njt\njt\n, . . . , djt\n= 1, . . . , dL\njt\n; zj,t-\n,\nwhere disturbances jt\nand j,t-\nare uncorrelated across observations (of MNEs i\nand j, and between periods t and t+1). The timing of j,t-\nis not important and\nthe j,t-\nrealization could be simultaneous with jt\n. Natural exclusion restrictions\non covariates that do not enter the cost function identify location selection.\nIn this section, we discuss cross-regional distributional assumptions on the dis-\nturbances (\njt\n, j,t-\n) and permissible estimation techniques under those conditions.\nFor a parametric cost function specification (with well-defined elasticities of substi-\ntution), a parametric approach to selectivity appears natural to start with. We present\nsets of necessary and sufficient distributional assumptions for univariate Heckman\n(1979) corrections location by location, to which we refer as parametric selectivity\ncorrection. Empirical evidence on the necessary assumptions is favorable in our\nsample. For multivariate selectivity, an extension of the Heckman (1979) estimator\nhas a complicated form (conditional moments of multivariate normal distributions\nhave no known closed form for multiple truncations, see Kotz, Balakrishnan and\nJohnson (2000)). Simulated maximum-likelihood would be a viable technique but\nrequires joint multivariate normality.\nTo be free of distributional restrictions, we extend the parametric approach to\na nonparametric multivariate selection model (similar to one in Das et al. (2003))\nand account for cross-location correlations between labor demand choices at the\nextensive and intensive margins. We derive identification from common suf-\nficient assumptions. The nonparametric procedure allows for unknown distur-\nbance distributions, and for unknown functional forms of E\njt\n| djt\n, zj,t-\nand\n) + k\nj,t-\n3.1 Parametric selectivity correction\nConsider Heckman (1979) selectivity corrections location by location. There are\ntwo alternative sets of assumptions that allow for such a parametric correction,\nwhereby labor demand (6) in only requires correction for selectivity (5) into\nbut not into any other locations k = . We are interested in E yjt\n| xjt\n, djt\n, zj,t-\nand H(zj,t-\n) = zj,t-\n - N\n+ (X\n+ N\n)dj,t-\n.\nAssumption 1 The disturbances ( k\njt\n, j,t-\n) are multivariate normally distributed\nand independent of xm\njt\nand zj,t- for all k, , m (and Var(j,t-\n) = 1). In addition,\neither\n(a) the part of the selection shock that correlates with labor demand shocks is\nan MNE-specific disturbance and does not vary by location so that, condi-\ntional on the MNE-specific shocks, k\njt\nand jt\nas well as k\nj,t-\nand j,t-\nare\nindependent for k = , or\n(b) the labor-demand related part of the selection shock varies by location but\nis independent of labor demand shocks in other locations ( k\njt\nand j,t-\nare\nindependent for k = ),\nfor , k = 1, . . . , L.\nEspecially case (a), where the part of the selection shock j,t-\nthat correlates\nwith labor demand shocks k\njt\nis an MNE-specific disturbance and does not vary by\nlocation, is plausible in economic terms. Suppose selection disturbances include\nboth host country-specific parts such as, for example, surprising changes to profit\nrepatriation policies and include MNE-specific parts such as shocks to its sunk entry\ncosts. Changes to host country repatriation policies affect the entry decision. But\nonce the MNE operates in the host country, it minimizes costs irrespective of entry-\nrelevant host-country shocks so that cost function disturbances are unrelated to the\nentry-relevant policy shocks. In case (a), all relevant information for labor demand\nat any location is fully contained in the single indicator djt\n(which is as informative\nabout j,t-\nas any other location indicator). Case (b) is more restrictive and implies\nthat neither MNE-specific nor host-country specific shocks to presence at location\nhave a bearing on labor demand at other locations k = .\nNote that cross-location correlations of labor demand shocks are not necessarily\nevidence against Assumption 1. As the proof to Proposition 1 will show, case (a) of\nMNE-specific selection shocks induces a correlation between labor demand shocks\nacross locations: k\njt\nand j,t-\ncorrelate across locations k = but in the same way\nas jt\nand j,t-\n.\nProposition 1 Independent parametric selection correction for L locations identify\nxjt\n and Cov(\njt\n, j,t-\n) if and only if Assumption 1 holds.\nProof. Because any normally distributed variable can be linearly decomposed into\na sum of independent standard normal variables, consider without loss of generality\nj,t-\n=\n\n+\n\n\nk\nk\n\n\nk\n(k\n\nuk\njt\njt\n=\nk\nk ek\njt\n+\nk\nk vk\njt\nfor independent standard normal variables ek\njt\n, uk\njt\n, vk\njt\n(k = 1, . . . , L), where  \n[0, 1] is a weight to satisfy (\n= 1, and k\n\n, k , k are parameters. To\nprove sufficiency, let k\n\n= k = 0 for k = .\nFirst consider (a) MNE-specific selection shocks j,t-\nwhose labor demand\nrelated part does not vary over locations. Concretely, set ek\njt\n= ejt\nfor all locations\nk, and denote \u00b7 \nk\nk . Then the variances and covariances of the selection\nshocks (7) are \n\n= 1-. The variances and covariances of the labor\ndemand shocks (8) are  = (\u00b7 )2 + ( )2 and k = (\u00b7 )2. And the covariances\nbetween the selection shock in location k and the demand shock in location are\nk\n\n= \u00b7 .\nSecond, consider (b) location-varying selection shocks j,t-\nthat are indepen-\ndent of labor demand shocks in other locations. Concretely, set k = 0 for k = ,\nand denote \u00b7   for comparability. Then the selection shock variances and\ncovariances are \n\n= 0. The variances and covariances of the la-\nbor demand shocks are  = (\u00b7 )2 + ( )2 and k = 0. The covariances be-\ntween the selection shock in location k and the demand shock in location are\n\n=\n\n1- \u00b7 and k\n\n= 0 for k = .\nIn both cases, the marginal likelihood function becomes\ng(yjt\n|xjt\n, zj,t-\n) =\n (yjt\n- xjt\n )/\n (zj,t-\n )\n\u00b7 \n\n(yjt\n- xjt\n ) + zj,t-\n\nafter concentrating out ujt\nand vjt\n, where  =  and \n= \n/ , and (\u00b7)\nand (\u00b7) are the standard normal density and distribution functions. This is pre-\ncisely the likelihood function for independent Heckman (1979) correction location\nby location.\nFor necessity, observe that parameters k\n\n= 0 or k = 0 for any k = cause\ncross-equation correlations and do not permit concentrating out ujt\nand vjt\nto arrive\nat (9). Similarly, k = 0 for any k = precludes concentrating out ejt\nto arrive\nExtending the parametric two-stage procedure to L locations, we first estimate equa-\ntions (5) with probit regressions by location. Second, we estimate outcome (6) at\nlocation by including the predicted selectivity hazard (inverse of the Mills ratio)\n^\n\njt\nfrom the first stage among the regressors (we also include absence indicators\n) among the regressors to prevent stacking bias). The coefficient on the\npredicted selectivity hazard equals \n  \n . We implement the second-stage\nestimation of (6) for L-1 locations (excluding home) by iterating Zellner's (1962)\nseemingly unrelated regression (SUR) over the estimated disturbance covariance\nmatrix until the estimates converge. This is equivalent to maximum-likelihood es-\ntimation (Dhrymes 1971) and makes estimation invariant to the deleted location\nequation L (Barten 1969). Through constraints, we impose linear homogeneity in\nfactor prices and symmetry of wage coefficients (see appendix B). We treat induced\nheteroskedasticity following Heckman (1979) (resulting in differing standard errors\non symmetric coefficients). After estimation, we test whether either of the two pos-\nsible sets of distributional assumptions are satisfied. We will find implications of\nset (b) violated but fail to find evidence against (a).\nImplications of Assumption 1 are testable. In case (a) of MNE-specific selection\nshocks and for any  < 1, Assumption 1 implies that k\n\nis the same for any pair of\nlocations k = . Note that we have no evidence on k\n\nfor k = from location-by-\nlocation estimation. We obtain estimates of k\n\nfrom multivariate probit estimation\ninstead and use a 2-test for their equality.\nUnder the additional assumption that  = 0, there is a further test to query\ncase (a), whether selection shocks are purely MNE-specific. Probit (maximum\nlikelihood) estimation of selection in the Heckman procedure does not predict the\ndisturbances jt\n. A testable implication of an MNE-specific selection shock, how-\never, is that, if an MNE is neither present in all locations nor absent from all lo-\ncations, the choices of presence and absence must be consistent with a location-\nindependent MNE-specific selection shock for all locations. Concretely, an MNE\nobservation contradicts the assumption of a location-independent selection shock\nif zj,t-\nk - Fk\nj,t-\n> zj,t-\n - Fj,t-\nfor locations k of absence and locations\nof presence because jt\ncan be subtracted from both sides of the inequalities. This\nimplication is testable for the predicted values, which are normally distributed con-\nditional on zj,t-\nand dj,t-\nby normality of jt\n.\nFor (b) location-variant selection shocks, the set of assumptions implies that\nk = 0. So, a regression of jt\njt\n, . . . , -1\njt\njt\n, . . . , L\njt\nmust have zero coeffi-\ncients. We test this implication.\nBoth sets (a) and (b) of assumptions imply that k\njt\nis independent of dk\njt\nfor\nall k because k\njt\nand j,t-\nare independent. We include absence indicators (1-\ndjt\n) among the regressors in the outcome equation, however, so this is not a useful\nimplication in our context.\n3.2 Nonparametric selectivity correction\nIn the nonparametric version of the multivariate binary choice model (5) and (6),\ndjt\n= 1 H(zj,t-\n) + j,t-\n> 0 , ( = 1, . . . , L)\nE yjt\n| xjt\n, djt\n, zj,t-\n= xjt\n + E\njt\ndjt\njt\n; zj,t-\n,\nno distributional assumptions are placed on j,t-\nor jt\nand H(\u00b7) is an unknown\nfunction.\nWe augment the nonparametric sample selection model in Das et al. (2003) to\nremain identified under multivariate binary selection (similar in spirit to a selection\nmodel with endogeneity in Das et al. (2003)). Suppose k\nj,t-\nand jt\nare correlated.\nSuppose also that zj,t-\nand xjt\nare correlated (e.g. wages in the past and present, as\nour data show). Because dk\njt\nis a function of k\nj,t-\n, it correlates with jt\n; because dk\njt\nis a function of zj,t-\n, it correlates with xjt\n. So, if the labor demand equation does\nnot condition on dk\njt\n, the identifying restriction that xjt\nand yjt\nare uncorrelated will\nbe violated.\nDefine the propensity score (the expected probability of selection conditional on\nzj,t-\n) as pjt\n E[djt\n| zj,t-\n] = 1-G(-H(zj,t-\n)), where G(\u00b7) is the cumulative\ndistribution function of j,t-\n. Then, assuming G(\u00b7) is one-to-one and changing\nvariables with ujt\n= 1-G(j,t-\n), labor demand at the extensive margin becomes\nE[\njt\n| djt\njt\n, zj,t-\n] = E[\njt\n| j,t-\n> -H(\u00b7); dk=\njt\n, zj,t-\n]\n= E[\njt\n| ujt\n< pjt\n; dk=\njt\n]\n=\npjt\njt\nf(\njt\n, ujt\n|dk=\njt\n) d jt\ndujt\n/pjt\n= m pjt\n, dk=\njt\n.\nSo, the conditional labor demand disturbance for location depends only on the\npropensity score for that location and the pattern of presence elsewhere. Observed\nlabor demand then satisfies\nE yjt\n| xjt\n, djt\n, zj,t-\n= xjt\n + m pjt\n, dk=\njt\n.\nTo establish identification, consider deviations from the truth  (xjt\n) \nxjt\n(^\n -  ) and m (pjt\n, dk=\njt\n)  ^\nm (pjt\n, dk=\njt\n) - m (pjt\n, dk=\njt\n), where hats de-\nnote estimates of the true (not hatted) functions. Assumption 2 states sufficient\nconditions for identification.\nAssumption 2\n(i) E[\njt\n| djt\njt\n, zj,t-\n] = m (pjt\n, dk=\njt\n),\n(ii) Pr( (xjt\n)+m (pjt\n, dk=\njt\n= 1) = 1 implies that  (xjt\n) is con-\nstant,\n(iii) zj,t-\npjt\n= 0 with probability one,\nfor = 1, . . . , L.\nPart (i) requires, as in the parametric case, that the conditional expectation of\nthe labor demand disturbance at location is only a function of the propensity score\nof presence at and observed presence elsewhere. So, in the regression of observed\nlabor demand yjt\non xjt\n and m (pjt\n, dk=\njt\n), xjt\n is a separate additive compo-\nnent. This specification extends nonparametric selectivity correction in Das et al.\nPart (ii) is the same identification condition as in Das et al. (2003) and implies\nthat pjt\n(which enters m (pjt\n, dk=\njt\n)) depends on variables in zj,t-\nthat are not in\nxjt\n . Otherwise, a regression of yjt\non xjt\n leaves  (xjt\n) = m (pjt\n, dk=\njt\n)\nand m (pjt\n, dk=\njt\n) = -m (pjt\n, dk=\njt\n) indeterminate--a violation of (ii). In our\ncontext, the exclusion restriction arises naturally because the MNE chooses xjt\nin\nresponse to information after t - , whereas the decision of presence is based on\nzj,t-\n. In addition, parent-firm characteristics and competitor-level host-country\ncharacteristics are predictors of presence but not related to the labor-cost specific\npart of the cost function other than through wages themselves. The rank condi-\ntion (iii) requires that the information set zj,t-\npredicts the propensity score.\nAssumption 2 allows us to relax the earlier identifying assumption that the dis-\nturbance tupel ( k\njt\n, j,t-\n) is independent of xm\njt\nand zj,t-\nfor all k, , m. Assump-\ntion 2 only requires that, conditional on the propensity score pjt\n, jt\nis uncorrelated\nwith all functions of xjt\nand zj,t-\n. Moreover, the nonparametric estimator xm\njt\nal-\nlows for conditional heteroskedasticity of unknown form (and thus presents a non-\nparametric alternative to Chen and Khan's (2003) three-step estimator). Also note\nthat we need no assumption on the cross-equation correlation of j,t-\nif we include\ndk=\njt\n. This makes nonparametric analysis a powerful tool for multivariate binary\nselection estimation.\nProposition 2 If Assumption 2 holds and if m (pjt\n, dk=\njt\n) and pjt\n(zj,t-\n) are contin-\nuously differentiable and have continuous distribution functions almost everywhere,\nthen xjt\n and m (pjt\n, dk=\njt\n) are identified up to additive constants.\nProof. In any observationally equivalent model it must be the case that the observed\noutcome satisfies E[yjt\n| xjt\n, djt\n, zj,t-\n] = xjt\n^\n + ^\nm (pjt\n, dk=\njt\n) for some xjt\n^\n and\n^\nm (pjt\n, dk=\njt\n). Equivalently, deviations from the truth  (xjt\n)+m (pjt\n, dk=\njt\n) =\n0. This identity must be differentiable with respect to xjt\nand zj,t-\nby continuous\ndifferentiability of m (pjt\n, dk=\njt\n) and pjt\n(zj,t-\n). So,\nx\njt\n (xjt\n(m (pjt\n, dk=\njt\n)/pjt\n) \u00b7 zj,t-\npjt\nThe first equation implies that  (xjt\n) = xjt\n(^\n -  ) = c1 for a constant c1\nand xjt\n is identified up to this constant. By zj,t-\npjt\n= 0, the second equation\nimplies that m (pjt\n, dk=\njt\n) = ^\nm (pjt\n, dk=\njt\n) - m (pjt\n, dk=\njt\n) = c2 for a constant c2\nand m (pjt\n, dk=\njt\n) is identified up to that constant.\nNote that lacking identification of additive constants is not a problem in our con-\ntext. The transformed cost function regressors xjt\n in equation (6) do not include\na constant term. To assess the labor demand effect of permanent wage differentials\nat the extensive margin, we will evaluate \npjt\nm (pjt\n, dk=\njt\n)\u00b7zj,t-\npjt\n(a scalar), for\nwhich the constant does not matter.\nConversely, if we want to include the propensity scores pk=\njt\nin the second-stage\nregression, instead of the presence indicators dk=\njt\n, we can only do so if j,t-\nand\nk\njt\nare uncorrelated across locations (k = ). This is a drawback of identification\nunder Assumption 2.\nSuppose we are interested in a broader definition of the extensive margin,\n\u00af\nyext,\njt\n E\njt\n| djt\n= 1; zj,t-\n,\nwhich does not condition on the observed location pattern outside . This defini-\ntion allows us to investigate the impact of a permanent wage differential (in zj,t-\n)\nthrough its effect on the entire grid of an MNE's potential locations. Formally,\nwe can now evaluate pjt\nm (pjt\n) \u00b7 zj,t-\npjt\n(a matrix), where pjt\nis the vector\nof propensity scores. Under the restriction that j,t-\nand k\njt\nare not correlated\nacross locations (k = ), dk\njt\nis not correlated with k\njt\nbecause jt\nmust be uncor-\nrelated with all functions of zj,t-\n. Then we can relax item (i) in Assumption 2 to\nE[\njt\n| djt\n= 1, zj,t-\n] = m (pjt\n).\nAssumption 3\n(i) E[\njt\n| djt\n= 1, zj,t-\n] = m (pjt\n) and Cov(\njt\n, k\nj,t-\n) = 0 for k = ,\n(ii) Pr( (xjt\n)+m (pjt\n, dk=\njt\n= 1) = 1 implies that  (xjt\n) is con-\nstant,\n(iii) zj,t-\npjt\n= 0 with probability one,\nfor = 1, . . . , L.\nProposition 3 follows as a corollary to Proposition 2 (replace the scalar deriva-\ntive m (pjt\n, dk=\njt\n)/pjt\nwith the vector pjt\nm (pjt\n), and zj,t-\npjt\nwith\nzj,t-\npjt\n).\nProposition 3 If Assumption 3 holds and if m (pjt\n) and pjt\n(zj,t-\n) are continu-\nously differentiable and have continuous distribution functions almost everywhere,\nthen xjt\n and m (pjt\n) are identified up to additive constants.\nDas et al. (2003) establish convergence rates and asymptotic normality of similar\nestimators on the basis of smoothness properties of pjt\n(zj,t-\n) and m (pjt\n) (and\na generalization of xjt\n to a function of xjt\n) for splines and power series. We\nuse power series to approximate pjt\n(zj,t-\n) and m (pjt\n). Power series are root-\nn asymptotic normal and can estimate smooth functionals of unknown parameters\n(Newey 1997). Most important for our application, the first derivative of the power\nseries estimator is a smooth functional and hence also root-n asymptotic normal.\nWe first estimate equations (5) with individual linear regressions by location. We\nuse a third-order polynomial in wages and two additional predictors, alongside oth-\nerwise linear predictors (to break the curse of dimensionality). Second, we include\nthe predicted propensity scores ^\npjt\nfrom the first stage on the second stage (6). Un-\nder Assumption 2 we approximate m (pjt\n, dk=\njt\n) with a third-order polynomial in\npjt\n, interacted with dk=\njt\n(we continue to include absence indicators (1-djt\n) without\ninteractions to both approximate m (\u00b7) and remove potential stacking bias). Under\nAssumption 3 we approximate m (pjt\n) with a third-order polynomial in pjt\n(and in-\nclude absence indicators (1-djt\n) among the regressors to remove potential stacking\nbias). We implement the second-stage estimation of (6) for L-1 locations (exclud-\ning home) by iterating SUR over the estimated disturbance covariance matrix until\nthe estimates converge. Through constraints, we impose linear homogeneity in fac-\ntor prices and symmetry of wage coefficients (see appendix B).\n3.3 Wage Elasticities of Labor Demand\nWe use elasticities of substitution to quantify the responses of multinational labor\ndemand yjt\nto permanent wage changes. The (constant-output) cross-price elasticity\nof substitution between factors and k is defined as  k\n  ln yjt\n/ ln wk and\nbecomes\nT\nk\n=\n k\n+ s sk\ns\n(k = ) and T =\n + s (s - 1)\ns\nfor a short-run translog cost function, where s = w y /C is the wage bill share\nof the workforce at (the wage bill at location in the MNE's total wage bill) and\n k\n sjt\n/ ln wk is the marginal change of the wage bill share at in response\nto a log wage change at k. These elasticities can be calculated both for each in-\ndividual MNE-j observation and in the aggregate using sample means. We will\nreport elasticity estimates from cost function coefficients and observed mean wage\nbill shares.\nA permanent change of the wage level wk in location k is reflected in both\nvectors of regressors xjt\n(with wk\nt\n) and zj,t-\n(with wk\nt-\n). So, the response of the\nwage bill share sjt\nto a permanent change in ln wk\nt\nis\n k\n=  k\n+ E\njt\n| \u00b7, wk\nt-\n/wk\nt-\n int\nk\n+ ext\nk\nThe first term in (11) captures the labor demand response at the intensive margin\nint\nk\n sjt\n/wk\nt\n. The second term in (11) is a measure of the labor demand re-\nsponse to a permanent change in wk at the extensive margin ext\nk\n sjt\n/wk\nt-\n.\nBy (6), the labor demand response at the intensive margin is int\nk\n=  k\nunder\nany of the Assumptions 1 through 3. The labor demand response at the extensive\nmargin, however, depends on the identifying assumption:\next\nk\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwk\n\n\njt\n\u00b7 wt\nwk\nt\n/Cjt\nAssumption 1,\n(m (pjt\n, dk=\njt\n)/pjt\n) \u00b7 (pjt\n/wk\nt-\n) \u00b7 wt\nwk\nt\n/Cjt\nAssumption 2,\npjt\nm (pjt\n) \u00b7 \nwk\nt-\npjt\n\u00b7 wt\nwk\nt\n/Cjt\nAssumption 3.\nWe multiply by present wages wk\nt\nbecause estimation on the first stage uses wk\nt\nas\nregressors, not their logs. We divide by Cjt\n/wt\nto convert estimates from labor\ndemand equation (6) back into their wage bill share equivalents because we also\nuse int\nk\n=  k\nat the intensive margin. Under Heckman (1979) correction (As-\nsumption 1), \nwk\nis the wage coefficient in the selection equation, \n  \n is\nthe coefficient on the selectivity hazard in the outcome equation, and \njt\nis the first\nderivative of the selectivity hazard \njt\n(the inverse of the Mills ratio) with respect to\nits scalar argument, \nj\n(zj,t-\n )  \nj\n(zj,t-\n )[\nj\n(zj,t-\n ) - zj,t-\n ].

By our variable construction, wt\nis MNE j's competitors'\nmean factor price exposure. It is thus also MNE-specific.\n4 Data and Descriptive Statistics\nOur main data source is a confidential three-dimensional panel (parent-affiliate-\nyear observations) of German MNEs at Deutsche Bundesbank (BuBa). We re-\ntain manufacturing parents and majority-owned manufacturing affiliates only. We\ntransform the data to parent-location-year observations and combine the data with\ncomplementary information on wages and host-country characteristics from various\nsources.\nInformation on foreign affiliates' turnover, employment and fixed assets stems from\nBuBa's MIDI database (MIcro database Direct Investment, formerly DIREK). MIDI\ncontains outward FDI information from a legally mandated annual survey, which\ncovers the universe of German firms and households with foreign corporate holdings\nabove minimum ownership shares and capital stock thresholds (Lipponer 2003). In-\ndividually identified outward FDI data are available for the years 1996-2001 and\nprovide two-digit NACE 1.1 sector classifications for the parent and affiliates. We\nrestrict our sample to majority-owned foreign affiliates because estimation of a mul-\ntilocation cost function suggests the use of observations of parent firms with full\nmanagerial control and because majority ownership is insensitive to a change in the\nnotification threshold in MIDI 1999. Assets and capital structure of every majority-\nowned foreign firm are reported in MIDI, including in years with zero turnover.\nTurnover does not distinguish within-MNE shipments from final sales but is never-\ntheless a proxy to affiliate production for cost function estimation.\nBalance sheet and income statement information for German parent firms comes\nfrom BuBa's USTAN database, which records this information for German firms\nthat draw a bill of exchange (for a documentation in English see Deutsche Bun-\ndesbank (1998)). The bill of exchange is a common form of payment among firms\nof all sizes throughout the sample period 1996-2001 (though losing some popular-\nity thereafter), and USTAN is considered the most comprehensive source of balance\nsheet data for companies of all sizes outside the financial sector in Germany. The\nMIDI and USTAN data were linked by parent name and address in previous work\n(Becker et al. 2005), resulting in the loss of some observations from the universe.11\n11Our conservative string matching routine filtered out potential duplicates from time-varying firm\nidentifiers in USTAN. In manual treatments, only doubtlessly identifiable parent pairs from MIDI and\nUSTAN were kept. At the expense of reduced sample size, this caution guarantees the formation of\ntime-consistent parent pairs.\nSources: MIDI and USTAN 1996 to 2001, manufacturing MNEs and their majority-owned foreign\nmanufacturing affiliates.

As Table 1 shows, the four aggregate foreign lo-\ncations host similarly large manufacturing workforces for German manufacturing\nlocations beyond home reduces the estimated cross-wage labor demand elasticity\nmatrix to five columns and rows (with 25 elasticity estimates). Except for possibly\nDEV, which spans Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region (except Japan, Aus-\ntralia and New Zealand), aggregate locations are fairly homogeneous. Among the\nlow-wage locations we focus on CEE, where most expansions happen. Among the\ngion where MNEs opened most new affiliates, 18.2 percent more in 2000 than in\npercent.\nMIDI and USTAN matches are incomplete so that we do not observe parent em-\nployment for every German MNE. For comparisons, we predict total parent employ-\nment for the full sample of German manufacturing MNEs from a linear regression\nof parent employment on foreign employments and estimate that German manufac-\nturing MNEs with majority-owned foreign manufacturing affiliates employ about\n1.4 million German workers. Conditional on MNE presence, the largest employ-\nment per sample MNE occurs in OIN and the smallest employment in WEU.\nTable 2 shows changes to the presence patterns of German MNEs between 1996\nand 2000. Adjustments are infrequent. Among firms who remain MNEs in both\nyears, more than four in five with a presence in only one location abroad in 1996\nkeep exactly one foreign location (large numbers in row 2; large numbers sum to\nSource: MIDI universe 1996 and 2000 (not matched to USTAN), manufacturing MNEs and their\nmajority-owned foreign manufacturing affiliates.

More than half of all MNEs who are\npresent in only one foreign location in 1996 have a presence in only one foreign\nlocation counts 1 through 5). In general, entries along the diagonal exhibit the\nhighest frequency in every row and every column. Regional expansions are gradual:\nthe frequencies above the diagonal decrease monotonically in every row.

There is a large number of\nthat the MIDI data cover the universe of German firms with FDI above minimum\nthresholds, and sample attrition is mitigated by the legal obligation to report and\nDeutsche Bundesbank's commitment to follow up on missing questionnaires.\nGerman MNEs typically pursue a single-affiliate strategy of foreign expansions:\nthe median number of affiliates of a German MNE per location is one. Table 3 shows\nthat, once an MNE has established its presence in a given location with at least one\naffiliate, the number of affiliates hardly changes: 859 out of 1,259 observations of\nMNEs in given locations exhibit no change to the number of affiliates between 1996\n\u00af\n\u00af\nSources: MIDI universe 1996 and 2000 (not matched to USTAN).

(The MNE total in Ta-\nble 3 is smaller than that in Table 2 because we condition on presence in a location.)\nTogether, the infrequent changes to foreign presence in Tables 2 and 3 suggest that\nMNEs face potentially large sunk costs of foreign presence.\nChanges to the number of host countries within locations are even more infre-\nquent than changes to the number of affiliates: an analysis of host country changes\nsimilar to Table 3 shows that 947 out of 1,259 observations of MNEs in given loca-\ntions exhibit no change in the number of selected host countries within the location.\nInfrequent net changes to the number of affiliates and countries could, in principle,\nconceal gross changes such as changes to the country composition within a location\nor exit and reentry with a different affiliate. Yet only small fractions of MNEs who\nmaintain a constant number of affiliates within a location change countries in the\nlocation. In both CEE and WEU 4.2 percent of MNEs with constant affiliate num-\nconstant affiliate numbers in DEV change country, but none do so in OIN. Simi-\nlarly small fractions are associated with changing affiliate IDs, suggesting that the\nfew gross changes beyond net changes are mostly country changes and not reentries\nwith different affiliates. Motivated by these findings, we define the extensive margin\n(selection into a location) as the presence of an MNE in an aggregate location with\nat least one affiliate. We do not distinguish the few country changes within aggre-\ngate locations for selection estimation, but our labor demand (outcome) estimation\naccounts for varying country-level exposures.\nWe deflate parent variables with the German CPI and deflate affiliate variables\nwith country-level CPIs (from the IMF's International Financial Statistics). CPI de-\nflation factors are re-based to unity at year end 1998. We transform foreign currency\nvalues to their EUR equivalents in December 1998 in order to remove nominal ex-\nreference date. See Appendix C for details on currency conversion.\n4.2 Complementary data\nWage information is not reported in MIDI. We obtain manufacturing wages by coun-\ntry and sector for 1996 through 2001 from the UNIDO Industrial Statistics Database\nat the 3-digit ISIC level (dividing sectoral wage bills by employment). To mitigate\npossible workforce composition effects in our labor demand regression on wages,\nwe use medians over sectors by foreign country. Though German wages are avail-\nable from USTAN, we also take the German wages from UNIDO for comparability;\nwe use sector wages for location selection estimation (where workforce compo-\nsition behind labor cost measures is not an econometric concern) and Germany-\nwide sector medians for translog estimation. We conduct robustness checks using\nOWW wage data by occupation (Occupational Wages around the World, Freeman\nnal data that underly the OWW information for Germany. We deflate and currency-\nconvert the wages in accordance with all other variables, and transform them into\nannual wages. Appendix D provides further details on wage variable construction.\nNational accounts information for host-country regressors comes from the\nWorld Bank's World Development Indicators and the IMF's International Finan-\ncial Statistics. We use CEPII bilateral trade and geographic data (www.cepii.fr) to\ncompute market access to a host country as in Redding and Venables (2004), see\nAppendix E. To condition selection estimation on skill endowments beyond labor\ncosts, we include the host country's percentage of high-school or higher educated\nMNE-wide regressors (Labor demand estimation)\nCompetitor-average regressors (Selection estimation)\nParent-firm regressors (Selection estimation)\nAverages of MNE variables are conditional on presence.

In\nour main specifications, we consider multinational labor demand during the years\ntwo years prior to production (t - ) from an uncensored sample of 3,392 MNEs.\nFor robustness checks, we also use a single cross-section of 322 MNEs in 2000\nand their location selection in 1996. The frequency of MNE presence abroad in-\n12For estimation of location selection, we also experimented with German import and export data\nfrom 2000 as controls for trade in the MNE's home sector. The import and export data were at the\ntwo-digit product level (matching NACE 1.1 two-digit sector codes) and by country of destination or\norigin (Fachserie 7, Reihe 7 from destatis.de/genesis) but did not prove to be significant predictors\nof location selection.\nlocations but WEU (Western European countries) where it slightly fell in the cen-\nsored panel. German MNEs spend the bulk of their wage bill (79 percent) at home.\nFrom German MNEs, CEE receives labor expenditures beyond the remaining de-\nveloping world combined. (Note that shares do not add to unity across columns\nbecause averages are conditional on presence, omitting absent MNEs). A similar\ncross-location pattern arises for turnover and capital stocks.\nSubstantial wage disparities persist across locations. Between Germany and\nCEE, for instance, MNE wages differ by 2.1 log points, or a factor of around 800\nis smaller, however, than the country-population weighted wage gap of about 1,000\ndifferential could reflect MNE selection into relative high-wage countries within\nthe low-wage region CEE.\nChoice-specific variables (host country attributes) are not identified in binomial\nchoice models such as probit for parametric selection correction. We estimate our\nmodel also in an MNE cross-section where we have no time-varying host country\nattributes. We therefore transform host country attributes to competitor-averages\nby MNE, and use competitor-average transformations in all procedures for com-\nparability. We group MNEs into eight manufacturing sectors13 and calculate mean\nhost-country attributes over all competitor observations by location and sector. We\ntake the total of competitors' foreign employments as host-country weights within\nthe location. The wage at t -  in CEE, for example, is the average wage paid\nat competitor's affiliates in CEE. In Table 4, we only take means over MNEs with\npresence in a given location so that the table reports CEE wages of the competitors\nof a German MNE with FDI in CEE.14 German MNEs in CEE, compared to any\nother location, face competitors in host countries that offer the least market access,\nthat have the smallest skill endowments, that are geographically the closest and that\nexhibit the smallest per-capita consumption. The CEE wages paid by competitors\nof MNEs in CEE are below those paid by competitors in DEV. MNEs in OIN face\ncompetitors with the strongest host-country market access and host-country skill\nendowments.\n13The sectors are: food; textiles and leather; wood, pulp and paper; chemicals, rubber, plastic\nand energy producing materials; mineral and metal products; machinery and equipment; transport\nequipment; manufactures not elsewhere classified.\n14We use the wage level at t- as a regressor in selection estimation, not its log. For comparisons\nto the the log wage at t, we report the log of the sample-mean wage at t -  in Table 4.\nParent-level covariates are suggestive of selectivity effects at their means. Par-\nents with headquarters in East Germany (including West Berlin) are slightly more\nlikely to expand to CEE and OIN than the average German MNE. For all other\nparent-firm regressors, regional conditional means (columns 2 to 5) exceed the un-\nconditional mean (column 1), and regional means tend to be the lower the higher the\nfrequency of MNE presence. Conditional on their presence abroad, MNEs exhibit\nlarger home workforces, larger parent-firm equity or debt, and higher parent-firm\ncapital-labor ratios.\n5 Estimation\nA permanent wage differential between an MNE's home and a foreign location di-\nrectly affects employment at the intensive margin through labor reallocation across\nexisting affiliates. A permanent wage differential indirectly affects labor demand at\nthe extensive margin by altering the likelihood of presence, which in turn changes\nconditional expectations of labor demand. We estimate both margins.\nThe effect of home wages on employment is identifiable at both margins from\nsector variation in a cross-section of German MNEs because individual wage-taking\nfirms face bargained earnings schedules from sectoral agreements between unions\nand employers' associations (with one-year to two-year terms).15 Time variation\nof home wages provides additional identification. Similarly, both time variation\nand variation across locations identify employment effects of foreign wages at the\nintensive margin. Identification of foreign wages at the extensive margin is more\nlimited, however. Because binomial choice models (of presence or absence) cannot\nidentify coefficients of choice-specific variables (host country attributes), foreign\nwage changes at the extensive margin are mainly identified over time. We obtain\nadditional variation by considering competitor-average foreign wages which vary\nby MNE. To clear wage variables of workforce composition effects, we use country-\nwide sector medians for foreign wages. For German wages, we use sector medians\nin outcome (translog) estimation but sector wages in location selection estimation\n(where composition effects in wages are not a concern). Estimation at the intensive\nmargin conditions on a firm's MNE status.\n15The use of sector home wages and location selectivity controls removes potential firm-level\nbargaining effects behind labor demand coefficients on home wages. Foreign affiliates of German\nMNEs are few and small, with arguably no impact on foreign wage levels.\nSources: MIDI 1996 to 2001, pooled sample of manufacturing MNEs and their majority-owned for-\neign manufacturing affiliates with two-year selection lags ( = 2).

MNE presence\nindicators elsewhere serve as rudimentary controls. We consider this regression a\nreduced-form version of the empirical presence rule (5); long regressions that un-\nderpin location selection with additional economic regressions will corroborate the\nsunk cost implication that past presence predicts about 70 percent of the propensity\nof future presence.\nThe reduced-form estimates provide a summary view of sunk costs in probabil-\nity terms.

Table 6 shows the decomposition result, based on estimates of\ncoefficients along the diagonal and the constant in Table 5. For the entry and exit\ncost decomposition involves the estimate of the constant, entry and exit costs cannot\nbe expressed in marginal probability terms of their own. A marginal probability\nmeasure can be inferred for their sum, the hysteresis band.\nPast presence increases the likelihood of future presence in a given location by\nmore than seventy percent in all but WEU, where the marginal effect predicts a more\nthan sixty percent increase. Long probit regressions confirm these magnitudes. The\ntotal, however, hides the differential impact of entry and exit costs. Entry costs\nare the largest in the distant low-income and high-income locations DEV and OIN,\nand dominate exit costs there. Conversely, entry costs are the lowest in the nearby\nlow-income and high-income locations CEE and WEU, and significantly smaller\nthan exit costs. Among the exit costs are the opportunity costs of absence. German\nMNEs are considerably less reluctant to leave distant locations DEV and OIN than\nthey abandon the neighboring locations CEE or WEU.\nIndicators for past FDI presence may not exclusively capture sunk costs but\nalso firm heterogeneity. In long regressions, we look into the black box behind\nrule (5) and include firm-level predictors as well as competitor-average host country\nSources: MIDI and USTAN 1996 to 2001 (UNIDO wages), pooled sample of manufacturing MNEs\nand their majority-owned foreign manufacturing affiliates with two-year selection lags ( = 2).\nStandard errors in parentheses:  significance at ten,  five,  one percent.

Table 7 presents the marginal effects for the full list of covariates.16\nAmong the firm-level predictors, we include interactions between past presence\nindicators and wages to capture the co-determining effect of wage differentials and\nan MNE's past presence at a location.\nIn the long regressions of Table 7, past presence elsewhere (off the diagonal)\nloses predictive power. But past presence for the region itself continues to be a\nstatistically significant and salient predictor of presence (excepting OIN because of\nthe wage interaction). When leaving interactions between wages and past presence\nout for a comparison, past presence at the same location has a highly statistically\nin the short regression (last row in Table 6). These probability effects of past pres-\nence confirm the importance of the hysteresis band. The MNE's number of host\ncountries in the past also significantly raises the likelihood of presence. German\nMNEs with large home employment, low parent debt, and a high capital-labor ratio\nat the parent firm are significantly more likely to be present at most or all foreign\nlocations within two years.\nTime and, by construction, competitor variation identifies wage effects. The\nhome wage has the expected positive sign in all regressions and is a significant pre-\ndictor for presence in OIN and WEU, both by itself and in its interaction with past\npresence. The negative coefficients on the home wage interaction with past pres-\nence suggest that wage differentials matter less for the location decision of MNEs\nthat already own an affiliate in the region. With German wages partly controlling\nfor the wage differential between the foreign location and the home sector, several\nforeign wages are statistically insignificant predictors of location choice. Insignifi-\ncant coefficients of host wages are common in the literature on location choice (e.g.\nBuch et al. (2005) for German MNEs). For estimation of the cross-elasticity of la-\nbor demand at the extensive margin, however, only the coefficient on the German\nwage matters (because the extensive margin is only defined for foreign labor de-\nmand). Bootstraps over both estimation stages will show even for the statistically\nweak wage prediction of location selection into CEE that, weighted with the strong\n16For continuous variables, marginal effects are   = (\u00b7)/zj,t-\n= (\u00b7) ; for indicator\nvariables, marginal effects are the differences in (\u00b7) between setting the indicator to 1 or 0 (evalu-\nated at the sample mean \u00af\nzj,t- , and the variance-covariance matrix estimator being transformed with\nthe delta method).

None of those covariates is sig-\nnificant at the five-percent level in any location. To tentatively control for an out-\nside margin of arm's length trade between independent firms, we also included a\nset of sector and location specific import and export measures but found the trade\nvariables not to be significant predictors of location choice; here we leave them out.\n5.1.2 Nonparametric propensity score estimation\nWe estimate the propensity score of location choice with a third-order polynomial\nin wages, market access, and the count of an MNE's past host countries, alongside\nthe same linear predictors as for probit estimation. The predicted propensity scores\npredicting the actual frequencies of presence in Table 4 but reflecting the relative\nfrequencies across locations.\nTable 8 reports coefficient estimates by location. Marginal effects are close\nto those in the probit regressions. Estimates of the hysteresis band along the di-\nagonal of past presence indicators continue to have a magnitude similar to probit\nestimation. When leaving interactions between wages and past presence out, past\npresence at the same location has a highly statistically significant probability effect\n.707 (.024) in WEU--again close to the marginal effects in the short regression\n(last row in Table 6). Inclusion of wage interactions with past presence shifts much\npredictive power to the interaction terms in DEV and all predictive power to the\ninteraction terms in OIN. In WEU, the wage-presence interaction countervails the\nhigh marginal effects of past presence.\nWe present F-tests of joint significance of individual wages for p values at or\nbelow the .1 threshold. Similar to probit estimation, polynomial terms that involve\nhome wages predict location choice more successfully than most foreign wages\n(except OIN wages).

Alternatively, we include pre-\ndicted propensity scores from nonparametric selection estimation (Assumptions 2\n5.2.1 Translog cost function estimation\nTable 9 presents estimates of translog cost function equations for 1,640 stacked\nof missing wage information at affiliate locations.) Coefficient estimates are from\niterated seemingly unrelated regressions of transformed wage bill shares on their\ntranslog predictors for four out of five locations, excluding home. For the regres-\nsion, wage bill shares and covariates are scaled by observation-specific cost-wage\nratios to remove upper truncation. Beyond the reported wage coefficients, the equa-\ntions include the full sets of turnover and fixed asset regressors, the scaled equivalent\nof the constant, and indicators of absence from all other locations. All but two wage\ncoefficients in Table 9 are significantly different from zero at the one percent level,\nand all coefficients but one are significant at the five percent level in each, paramet-\nric and nonparametric, regression. Most coefficients on output and fixed assets (not\nreported) are similarly highly significant.\nEquation estimates in the upper panel of Table 9 include the predicted selectivity\nhazards (inverses of Mills ratios) by location (Assumption 1).

Regression fits are similar under parametric and nonparametric selectiv-\nity correction. Overall, we consider the significance of selectivity correction terms\nstrong evidence for the importance of the extensive margin.\n5.2.2 Tests for parametric selectivity correction\nWe test whether Assumption 1 for parametric selection correction is satisfied in our\ncontext. There are two cases: (a) the part of the selection shock that correlates with\nlabor demand shocks is an MNE-specific disturbance and does not vary by location,\nand (b) the labor-demand related part of the selection shock varies by location but\nis independent of labor demand shocks in other locations. We test the two cases\nin turn. Tests fail to reject case (a), but they do reject case (b). We consider the\nassumptions of case (a) both economically plausible and statistically acceptable.\nConsider (a) MNE-specific selection shocks whose labor demand related part\ndoes not vary by location. This case implies that the covariance between selec-\ntion disturbances is the same for any pair of locations k = . We obtain estimates\nof those covariances from multivariate probit estimation of simultaneous selection\ninto the four foreign locations. In the cross section of MNEs in 2000 with multivari-\nate probit regressors from 1996, we fail to reject the joint equality of six correlation\ncoefficients between the four equations with a 2 test statistic of 4.63 (p value .592).\nUnder a restriction on the selection disturbance, another implication of case (a) is\nthat, if an MNE is neither present in all locations nor absent from all locations, the\nchoices of presence and absence must be consistent with a location-independent\nMNE-specific selection shock for all locations. We calculate the regression predic-\ntion for all MNEs that are not omnipresent, pick the maximum probit prediction\namong all locations of absence and the minimum probit prediction among all lo-\ncations of presence thus stacking the cards of the test against case (a). Although\n191 out of 1,941 observations show the wrong pattern, a one-sided t-test of the\nnull hypothesis that absence and presence predictions are reversed is rejected over-\nwhelmingly with a t statistic of 77.4 (zero p value).\nSecond, consider (b) location-varying selection shocks that are independent of\nlabor demand shocks in other locations. This assumption implies that labor demand\nresiduals from one location must have no correlation with labor demand residuals\nfrom any other location. We reject this hypothesis for three out of six pairs of the\nfour location residuals with p values below .01, for two pairs with p values below\n.1, but fail to reject zero correlation in one remaining case (CEE-OIN).\nWhile case (b) is rejected, there is no evidence against case (a) where selection\ndisturbances correlate with labor demand shocks only through an MNE-specific\nshock but not through location-specific shocks. Note that cross-location correla-\ntions of labor demand errors are not evidence against case (a) because MNE-specific\nselection shocks themselves induce a correlation between the labor demand distur-\nbances across locations. As discussed before, case (a) is plausible in economic\nterms. Suppose selection disturbances include both host country-specific parts such\nas, for example, surprising changes to profit repatriation policies and include MNE-\nspecific parts. Changes to host country repatriation policies affect the entry de-\ncision. But once the MNE operates in the host country, it minimizes costs irre-\nspective of entry-relevant host-country shocks so that cost function disturbances are\nunrelated to the entry-relevant policy shocks. Given supportive test results and the\neconomic plausibility of case (a), we regard estimation under parametric selectivity\ncorrection (Assumption 1) a relevant benchmark.\n5.2.3 Elasticities of multinational labor substitution\nTable 10 shows own-wage and cross-wage substitution elasticities for permanent\nwage changes by one percent in different locations, separately for the extensive and\nthe intensive margins. There is no well-defined extensive margin for selection into\nthe home location (Germany) in a sample of MNEs, which are observable to the\nstatistician only when active in the home location. The standard errors are from 200\nbootstraps over the two estimation steps of parametric selectivity corrected translog\nestimates (Assumption 1). One margin at a time is set to zero to isolate the effect\nat the other margin. Cross-price elasticities are affine transformations of translog\ncoefficients (equation (10)). While log wage effects on wage bill shares are additive\nin translog estimation at the intensive and the extensive margin (equation (6)), cross-\nwage substitution elasticities are not.\nOwn-wage elasticities along the diagonal--for both the intensive and the ex-\ntensive margins--are uniformly negative, and significantly negative, as production\ntheory requires. While this might be expected for estimates at the intensive margin,\nit is a reassuring finding for estimates at the extensive margin. Note that we impose\nlinear homogeneity in factor prices and symmetry of wage coefficients at the inten-\nsive margin through constraints on the translog regression, but we do not restrict es-\ntimates at the extensive margin because those constraints are not well defined at the\nobservation level--neither under parametric nor nonparametric selectivity correc-\ntion. The own-wage elasticity of substitution is considerably larger in most foreign\nlocations than at home, suggesting that MNE employment abroad responds more\nWage change (by 1%) in\nSources: MIDI and USTAN 1996 to 2001 (UNIDO wages).

A one-percent reduction in the wage in CEE, for instance, is associated\nwith a .05 percent drop in home employment at German MNE parents. In contrast,\na one-percent increase in the German sector wage is associated with a 1.6 percent\nboost to MNE employment in CEE at the intensive margin and a .8 percent boost at\nthe extensive margin. So, home and CEE employment are substitutes within MNEs.\nThe large difference in cross-wage effects is consistent with two main facts. First,\nemployment at German MNE parents is larger in levels than at their CEE affiliates\nso that a smaller percentage wage drop in Germany means a larger reduction in em-\nployment in absolute terms. Second, CEE workers tend to be less productive than\nGerman workers, which is reflected in the translog cost function coefficients.\nThe extensive margin is a noticeable component of adjustment, beyond its cru-\ncial role in correcting cost function estimates for location selectivity bias. Elastici-\nties at the extensive margin are strictly positive. So, home and foreign employment\nare substitutes within MNEs not only at the intensive but also at the extensive mar-\ngin. Although the CEE and DEV home wage effects on selection were not statisti-\ncally different from zero on the first stage with probit (Table 7), the strong signifi-\ncance of the selection effect on labor demand on the second stage in CEE (selectivity\nhazard coefficient in Table 9) turns home wage effects into significant predictors of\nemployment substitution at the extensive margin. Beyond the marginal wage coeffi-\ncients from two-step estimation, observed wage bill shares provide information for\nelasticity estimation and thus contribute to the significance of elasticity estimates.\nElasticities at the extensive margin are smaller in magnitude than at the intensive\nmargin in the geographically close locations CEE and WEU, and in OIN. In DEV,\nhowever, the extensive margin dominates the insignificant elasticity at the intensive\nmargin and we find a .8 percent increase in DEV employment in response to a\none-percent home wage increase--similar in magnitude to that in CEE. In CEE, a\none-percent increase in the German home wage is also associated with a .8 percent\nincrease in MNE employment at the extensive margin, if no adjustment occurs at\nthe intensive margin.\nWe also add the intensive and extensive wage effects on wage bills and compute\nthe total home wage elasticities of foreign labor demand. We find highly signifi-\ncant estimates for the total elasticities at three locations: 1.61 in CEE, 2.51 in OIN\nand 2.45 in WEU (significantly different from zero at the one-percent level). Our\n200 bootstraps allow us to test whether the elasticities at the intensive margin are\nsignificantly different from the total elasticities. We reject their equality for DEV,\nOIN and WEU (with t statistics between 2.1 and 16.6) on UNIDO wages and reject\ntheir equality for all locations (t statistics between 4.1 and 21.4) on OWW wages,\ncorroborating the importance of the extensive margin.\nCross-wage estimates beyond the first row and column are for the most part\nnot statistically different from zero. Notable exceptions at the intensive margin are\nsignificant pairs of positive cross-wage effects involving WEU: on the one hand of\nOIN on WEU (.36) and vice versa (.90), and on the other hand of DEV on WEU\n(.05) and vice versa (.45). The significantly positive and mutually consistent effects\nsuggest that MNE employment is a substitute at the intensive margin between OIN\nand WEU and between DEV and WEU. The substitution effect is also corroborated\nby a positive cross-wage elasticity between OIN and WEU (1.14) at the extensive\nmargin.\n5.3 Specification comparisons\nTo assess the robustness of our estimates, we compare several further specifications\nand report the first rows of the cross-wage elasticity matrices (foreign wage effects\non home employment) in Table 11, and the first columns separately by intensive and\nWage change (1%) in\nHome employment HOM CEE DEV OIN WEU Obs.\nStacking\nOmnipresent MNEs\nSources: MIDI and USTAN 1996 to 2001 (UNIDO wages).

OWW and UBS wage data in\nthe third and fourth row result in smaller estimation samples and perhaps introduce\nattenuation bias for some coefficients (the UBS wage data are particularly sketchy\nfor CEE). Coefficient estimates are nevertheless similar across wage data. Non-\nparametric estimation does not yield statistically different estimates, neither under\nAssumption 2 nor 3, excepting DEV. The sample of 93 omnipresent MNEs between\n1996 and 2001 is small but results in significant outcome estimates on the second\nstage (we predict selectivity hazards from first-stage regressions on the full sample);\nthe magnitude of coefficient estimates, when significant, is considerably larger than\nHome wage change (1%), by regression specification\nStacking Omnipr.\nSources: MIDI and USTAN 1996 to 2001 (UNIDO wages).

Estimates for DEV are not significant\nexcept for nonparametric specifications. This is consistent with the assertion that\nhigher order series terms in the outcome regression help remove bias that paramet-\nric selectivity correction cannot prevent with a single selectivity hazard.\nHome-wage elasticities of foreign employment at the intensive margin (Ta-\nble 12) are robust too. Estimates on our benchmark sample (now in the first column)\nconform closely to several other specifications. In fact, the comments on the rows\nof Table 11 above apply also to the columns of Table 12, except only that the coef-\nficient estimates for the sample of omnipresent MNEs now closely resemble those\nfrom other specifications.\nAt the extensive margin, home-wage elasticities of foreign employment (Ta-\nble 13) are (highly) significant in the parametric specifications (columns 1 through\n4), for all wage data and in the year 2000 cross section (with UNIDO wages). Co-\nefficient magnitudes vary slightly more across specifications than they do at the\nintensive margin.

Although the inclusion of nonparametric series terms in\ntranslog estimation yields more precise estimates of intensive margin coefficients\n(Tables 11 and 12) by approximating disturbance components beyond the paramet-\nric selectivity hazard, the series terms do not seem to provide a precise estimate\nof the extensive margin itself.We nevertheless view the similarity between para-\nmetric and plausible nonparametric estimates as an indication that our parametric\nbenchmark estimates of the extensive margin are reasonable. Point estimates for\nomnipresent MNEs (column 7) are smaller than in the benchmark specification, ar-\nguably because this selected sample expands to foreign locations more frequently.\nTaken together, our results confirm the statistical plausibility of the benchmark\nestimates from parametric selectivity correction (Assumption 1). Several tests for\nthe validity of Assumption 1 fail to reject the identifying hypothesis that selection\nshocks correlate with labor demand shocks only through an MNE-specific error but\nnot through location-specific errors. Nonparametric estimation yields very similar\nand highly significant elasticity estimates at the intensive margin. At the exten-\nsive margin, the benchmark estimates from parametric selectivity correction are\nhighly significant but nonparametric estimates fail to attain significance.

We now turn to the economic implications of our estimates for multinational\nlabor substitution.\n5.4 Counterfactual Evaluation\nOur hypothetical experiment is a permanent change in the wage differential between\nhome and foreign locations. How much larger would parent employment be if the\nwage gap to foreign locations narrowed? How much smaller would affiliate employ-\nment be? Counterfactual predictions in Table 14 give answers to these questions.\nWe use the home-wage elasticities of foreign labor demand and the foreign-wage\nelasticities of home labor demand from our selectivity corrected translog bench-\nthe employment responses at the mean MNE (the mean MNE in the stacked sample\nhas propensities of presence abroad as in the first row of Table 4). We multiply\nthe elasticity estimates with the workforce totals in Table 1 and obtain the implied\nemployment changes from one-percent increases in wages by margin.\nA one percent smaller wage gap between Germany and locations in CEE, for\ninstance, is associated with around 700 more jobs at German parents and 4,000 less\njobs at affiliates in CEE. CEE affiliates tend to have smaller work forces and, ar-\nguably, lower labor productivity than German establishments so that employment\nin CEE is more sensitive to home wage changes than home employment responds to\nforeign wages. The labor substitution effects of one-percent wage changes between\nhome locations and CEE are smaller than the effects relative to OIN or WEU. In ab-\nsolute magnitude, however, a closing of the HOM-CEE wage gap by half at constant\nelasticities results in larger employment effects than a reduction of the HOM-OIN\nor HOM-WEU wage gaps by half. Using country populations as weights for loca-\ntion mean UNIDO wages, CEE wages are, on average, 9.9 percent of the German\nlevel in 2000 (population-weighted mean OWW wages in CEE are 9.8 percent). If\nthe estimated elasticities of substitution are constant at all levels of wages, an in-\na\ning jobs (with a standard error of 45,000 jobs) to Germany--around a quarter of the\nestimated home employment at German manufacturing MNEs (Table 1). If interna-\ntional wage gaps shrink at a similar rate as per capita GDP converges to steady state\nand Germany is close to its steady state, the CEE-German wage gap would take\naround 35 years to contract to half its present size (Barro and Sala i Martin 1992).\nThe UNIDO wage level in WEU is 78.6 (96.1) percent of that in Germany so that\nan increase in WEU wages by 14% (2%) to cut the gap in about half would attract\nmanufacturing MNEs.\nElasticities of labor substitution are local properties of the MNE's cost func-\ntion, however, and the assumption of a constant elasticity of substitution at all wage\nlevels is coarse. The rough calculations are merely intended to put an economic\nmeaning to the abstract elasticity figures. In our view, the magnitude of our calcu-\nlations for constant elasticities nonetheless underscores the potential importance of\njob substitution within MNEs for labor market outcomes.\n6 Conclusion\nWhile the public discourse over outsourcing seems to have settled on the idea that\nmultinational enterprises (MNEs) substitute jobs at home for foreign employment,\neconomic studies on MNE labor demand across locations have found weak or no\nevidence of job substitution. We integrate two distinct branches of the literature--\none on predictions of MNEs' location choices, and one on labor substitutability\nacross established MNE locations--into a single econometric model that corrects\ncost function estimation for location selectivity. In our framework, multinational\nlabor demand responds to wage differentials across locations both at the extensive\nmargin, when an MNE expands into foreign locations, and at the intensive margin,\nwhen an MNE reallocates jobs across existing foreign affiliates. We derive condi-\ntions for common Heckman (1979) selectivity corrections, location by location, and\nfor nonparametric identification. Cost function estimation, however, conditions on\nMNE output. The empirical exercise thus leaves aside the counterfactual question\nhow the market share and size of an MNE would differ if its access to foreign loca-\ntions were limited in spite of global product market competition. This matter is part\nof our ongoing research.\nEmpirical evidence on German manufacturing MNEs shows that firms change\nmultinational presence only infrequently and hardly alter their number of affiliates\nwithin regions. These infrequent changes to multinational presence at the extensive\nmargin give rise to rare but salient labor demand effects in response to permanent\nwage differentials across locations. With every percentage increase in Central and\nEastern European wages, German manufacturing MNEs are found to allocate 700\nMNE jobs to Germany. With every percentage increase in German wages, German\nMNEs allocate 2,000 jobs to Central and Eastern Europe at the extensive margin\nand 4,000 jobs in total. Given the sizeable wage differential between Germany and\nCentral and Eastern Europe (requiring a 450 percent increase in Eastern European\nwages in 2000 to reduce the gap by half), we conclude that international wage dif-\nferentials have a salient impact on multinational labor substitution.\nReferences\nBarba Navaretti, Giorgio and Davide Castellani, \"Investments Abroad and Per-\nformance at Home: Evidence from Italian Multinationals,\" CEPR Discussion\nBarro, Robert J. and Jong Wha Lee, \"International Data on Educational Attain-\nment: Updates and Implications,\" Oxford Economic Papers, July 2001, 53 (3),\nand Xavier Sala i Martin, \"Convergence,\" Journal of Political Economy,\nBarten, A.

At\nmoment t -  (i.e.  periods prior to production and sales), MNE j determines at\nwhich locations to produce and faces uncertainty over other MNEs' future output\nqi=j,t\n, input prices wt\n, and its own realized output qjt\n. With its location choice, the\nMNE also chooses its optimal capital stock vector kjt\nacross L locations.\nOn the second stage at time t, location-related uncertainty is resolved and MNE\nj chooses output qjt\ngiven its cost function (or, by duality, optimal factor employ-\nment given its production function). The optimal quantity choice q\njt\nat time t can\nbe characterized with first-order conditions\np (qi=j\n, q\njt\njt\n\nCjt\n(q\njt\n; kjt\n, wt\n)\nq\njt\n( = 1, . . . , L), (A1)\nwhere p (\u00b7) is the price of a good from location as a function of competitors' and\nown worldwide output, and q\njt\nis the elasticity of demand for qjt\nwith respect to\nprice p . By the Kuhn-Tucker theorem, q\njt\n=0 if inequality holds. So, even if MNE\nj is present at location , it may find it optimal to produce qjt\n=0 once factor price\nand competitors' output are revealed.\nOn the first stage, MNE j's linear programming problem can be characterized\nby the rules for FDI at locations = 1, . . . , L\ndjt\njt\n(q ,\njt\n) - jt\n(qjt\n- Fj,t-\n+ j,t-\nwhere Fj,t-\ndenotes MNE j's relevant fixed costs for presence at location and\nj,t-\nis an MNE-specific disturbance. Expectations depend on MNE j's informa-\ntion set zj,t-\n. MNE j's linear programming problem on the first stage involves the\nsimultaneous evaluation of (A2) for each location given the 2L-1 possible combi-\nnations of outputs at all remaining locations L-1.\nFor its location choice on the first stage, an MNE j maximizes its expected\nprofits Ej,t-\n[jt\n] where expectations are conditional on the MNE's information set\nin period t - . The MNE can produce the vector of outputs qjt\njt\n, . . . , qL\njt\n) at\nL locations ( = 1, . . . , L). So, future expected profits are\nEj,t-\n[ p(qi=j,t\n, qjt\n) \u00b7 qjt\n- Cjt\n(qjt\n; kjt\n, wt\n) ] . (A3)\nThe estimated presence rule (5) in the text follows using expected profits (A3) in\ncriterion (A2).\nB Multiproduct translog cost function\nConsider the short-run multiproduct translog function with quasi-fixed capital:17\nln Cjt\n=  +\nL\nm\nln qm\njt\n+\nL\n ln wt\n+\nL\nL\n\u00b5 m\nln qm\njt\nln wt\n+\nL\nL\nm\nln qm\njt\nln qjt\n+\nL\nL\n m\nln wm\nt\nln wt\n+\nL\nm\nln km\njt\n+\nL\nL\nm\nln km\njt\nln qjt\n+\nL\nL\n m\nln km\njt\nln wt\n+\nL\nL\nm\nln km\njt\nln kjt\n.\nBy Shepard's (1953) lemma, MNE j's demand for employment yjt\nis equal to\nCjt\n/wt\nso that the wage bill share sjt\n wt\nyjt\n/Cjt\nat location becomes\nsjt\n=\nCjt\n/wt\nCjt\n/wt\n=  +\nL\n\u00b5 m\nln qm\njt\n+  m\nln km\njt\n+  m\nln wm\nt\nfor = 1, . . . , L. We transform these L equations into L simultaneous labor de-\nmand functions by multiplying the dependent variable and all regressors with the\nobservation-specific scalars Cjt\n/wt\nand obtain yjt\n= Cjt\n/wt\n= sjt\nCjt\n/wt\nas in\nequation (6).\nWith L locations, there are L(L - 1)/2 symmetry restrictions k\n=  k\nfor\nany k, . Linear homogeneity in factor prices requires that L\n = 1 and that\nL\n\u00b5 m\n= L\n m\n= L\n m\n= L\nm\n= 0 for all m. We impose those\nrestrictions on estimation but do not constrain estimates of factor price coefficients\nat the extensive margin. We do not impose any returns-to-scale restrictions.\nC Currency conversion and deflation\nWe convert all economic data of foreign affiliates into euro (EUR) and deflate them.\nIn BuBa's original MIDI data, all information on foreign affiliates is reported in\nGerman currency using the exchange rate at the closing date of the foreign affiliate's\nbalance sheet. We apply the following deflation and currency conversion method to\nall financial variables. Deutschmark (DEM) figures are converted into euro figures\nWe use the market exchange rate on the end-of-month day closest to an affiliate's\n17Slaughter (2000) adds ln(k/q) terms to a version of (B1).

This reverses the conversion applied to the questionnaires at the\ndate of reporting. (ii) A CPI factor for every country deflates the foreign-currency\nfinancial figures to the December-1998 real value in local currency. (iii) For each\ncountry, the average of all end-of-month exchange rates vis-`\na-vis the DEM or EUR\nparity of foreign consumption baskets relative to the DEM or EUR. All deflated\nlocal-currency figures are converted back to DEM or EUR using this purchasing-\npower proxy.\nWe use the foreign countries' CPIs (Consumer Price Indices from the IMF's\nInternational Financial Statistics) to deflate the figures. Whenever a country's CPI\nis not available from IFS but the main currency used in that country is issued in\nsome other country, we use the CPI of the currency-issuing country. The CPI de-\nflation factors for all countries are rebased to unity at year-end 1998. For the UBS\nwage data, we first translate U.S. dollars into Euros and then proceeded as detailed\nabove. Parent-level and sector-level domestic variables are transformed into De-\nD Wages\nWe base our estimation on sectoral manufacturing wages by country between 1996\nand 2001 from the UNIDO Industrial Statistics Database at the 3-digit ISIC level,\nRev. 2 (UNIDO 2005). The UNIDO measure of annual sectoral wage bills includes\nall payments to workers at establishments in the reference sector and year (wages\nand salaries, remuneration for time not worked, bonuses and gratuities, allowances,\nand payments in kind; but excludes contributions to social security, pensions, in-\nsurance, severance and termination pay). We divide the sectoral wage bill by the\nsectoral number of workers and employees. We deflate the wages with the country-\nlevel CPI (standardized to unity in December 1998) and convert the foreign currency\nto EUR at the December 1998 exchange rate. To mitigate possible workforce com-\nposition effects in our labor demand regression on wages, we use the sector median\nwage by country (and lose sectoral wage variation also for Germany) in the outcome\nestimation. We use sectoral UNIDO wages for Germany in selection estimation be-\ncause workforce composition behind labor cost measures is not an econometric\nconcern for location choice. The UNIDO data cover 109 countries and result in the\nlargest overlap with MIDI observations on German MNEs for estimation.\nFor robustness checks, we use OWW monthly average wage rates of male work-\n1999. Missing observations, however, reduce the overlap with MIDI data on Ger-\nman MNEs below the overlap that UNIDO data provide. We follow Freeman and\nOostendorp's (2001) recommendation and pick the base calibration with lexico-\ngraphic weighting for the aggregate wages by country. We deflate the wages with\nthe country-level CPI (standardized to unity in December 1998) and convert the for-\neign currency to EUR at the December 1998 exchange rate. We fill missing values,\nby country and occupation group, with information from the latest preceding year\n2001. To mitigate workforce composition effects, we take country medians over\n161 OWW occupation groups for foreign wages. We multiply the resulting monthly\nmedian occupation wage by twelve to approximate annual earnings for cost func-\ntion estimation. Complementing foreign OWW wages, we use the German annual\nearnings survey (table 62321 from destatis.de/genesis) and obtain sectoral monthly\nwages, broken down into three blue-collar and four white-collar occupation groups\nby sector (two-digit NACE 1.1). We compute median wages over these seven occu-\npation groups by sector, deflate them with the German CPI (standardized to unity\nin December 1998), and multiply them by twelve to arrive at annual earnings for\ncost function estimation. Occupational wage information from the German annual\nearnings survey enters the ILO database, on which OWW wages are based, so that\nthese foreign and domestic wages are compatible.\nFor additional robustness checks, we also use UBS wage data collected by the\nfirst quarter of 2003. Questionnaires request detailed information on wage compo-\nnents, wage deductions and working hours across thirteen occupations. UBS con-\nverts wage figures into U.S. dollars and smoothes the effect of day-to-day currency\nfluctuations by using the average daily spot rate during the quarter of the UBS sur-\nvey. We convert UBS wages into EUR at the average USD/EUR exchange rate\nduring the survey quarter and deflate figures with the German CPI (standardized\nto unity in December 1998). We use the machinist wage as the most closely com-\nparable wage to median OWW and German wages. We take UBS wages also for\nGermany (and lose sectoral variation).\nWhenever foreign price deflators are missing or period-average exchange rate\ninformation is incomplete for purchasing-power parity oriented wage conversion,\nwe use current exchange rates and the German price deflator.\nE Market access\nWe construct market access measures following Redding and Venables (2004). We\ncountry pairs from CEPII (www.cepii.fr). After filling in missing imports to B from\nA with exports information from country A to B, we drop all exports information\nand set exports from A to B equal to B's imports from A. We adopt this procedure\nbecause we consider imports, whenever available, more reliably measured than ex-\nLocations Countries\nWEU Western European countries\n(EU 15 plus Norway and Switzerland)\nOIN Overseas Industrialized countries\nincluding Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, USA\nas well as Iceland and Greenland\nCEE Central and Eastern European countries\nincluding accession countries and candidates for EU\nmembership\nDEV Developing countries\nincluding Turkey, Russia and Central Asian economies\nas well as dominions of Western European countries and\nthe USA\nports.\nOur regression specification for an unbalanced panel of country pairs by year is\nln Xij\n= i\nxi\n+ j\nmj\n+  ln dij\n+ \u00b5 bij\n+ ij\n,\nwhere Xij\ndenotes country i's aggregate exports in USD (+1) to country j, xi\nan\nexporter country dummy, mj\nan importer country dummy, dij\nthe geographical dis-\ntance between country i and j, and bij\na dummy variable indicating a common\nborder. We compute market access Ai\nto country i as\nAi\n= exp{i\nmi\n/\n+\nj=i\nexp{j\nmj\n} (dij\n) exp{\u00b5 bij\n}.\nThis is measure MA(3) in Redding and Venables (2004).\nThe following Discussion Papers have been published since 2005:\nSeries 1: Economic Studies\n1 2005 Financial constraints and capacity adjustment\nin the United Kingdom \u00ad Evidence from a Ulf von Kalckreuth\nlarge panel of survey data Emma Murphy\nfactors in the euro area analyzed in a\nlarge-scale factor model Sandra Eickmeier\n3 2005 Financial intermediaries, markets, F.
