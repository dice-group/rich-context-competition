Anorexia nervosa (AN),\nbulimia nervosa (BN), eating disorder not otherwise speci-\nfied (EDNOS), and binge eating disorder (BED) are the most\nwell-recognized eating disorders, all of which have signifi-\ncant biopsychosocial impacts upon the lives of those affected\nby the illnesses (Deloitte Access Economics, 2012). The\npeak age of onset for eating disorders occurs in adolescence\n(Kohn & Golden, 2001) with young people increasingly at\nrisk due to their developmental stage and the influence of the\nGrigg, Bowman, & Redman, 1996; Hay, Mond, Buttner, &\nDarby, 2008). Evidence suggests that early intervention leads\nto better treatment outcomes (Al-Yaman, Sargaent, & Bryant,\nfor effective treatments aimed at the adolescent population.\nGroup modalities are commonly used in the treatment of\nadolescent eating disorders both nationally and internation-\nally, for example, Southern Health Butterfly Day Program\n(Victoria, Australia) and the Renfrew Centre (United States);\nhowever, research in this area remains largely underdevel-\noped (Fuhriman & Burlingame, 1994; Gowers & Lock,\n2005). There exists a broad range of group therapies aimed at\ntreating the various features and psychosocial impacts of the\nillnesses, such as body image groups (Bhatnagar,Wisniewski,\nSolomon, & Heinberg, 2013), nutrition groups (Goldstein et\nal., 2011), social skills groups (Tasca, Balfour, Presniak, &\nBissada, 2012), and psychotherapy groups (Nevonen &\nBroberg, 2006); yet, few studies have explored the efficacy\nof these treatment models with the adolescent population.\nIn contrast, research on adults has begun to explore the\nutility of various group treatment modalities for a variety of\neating disorder diagnoses (Brownley, Berkman, Sedway,\nAgras, & Linehan, 2001). There exists a body of literature\ndemonstrating the effectiveness of group cognitive behav-\nioral therapy (CBT) in the treatment of adults living with BN\nDialectical behavior therapy (DBT) has shown promise in\nthe treatment of adults living with both BN and BED (Chen\n1University of Melbourne, Australia\nCorresponding Author:\nJessica Downey, 24 Miller Street, Alphington, Victoria 3078, Australia.\nEmail: jdowney@student.unimelb.edu.au\nGroup Therapy for Adolescents Living\nWith an Eating Disorder: A Scoping\nReview\nJessica Downey1\n Keywords\neating disorder, group therapy, adolescents, review\n2 SAGE Open\nTelch, & Chen, 2009). Similarly, group interpersonal therapy\n(IPT) has been shown to reduce binging in adults diagnosed\nwith BED (Agras et al., 1995), and emerging research is\nbeginning to trial motivational models for adults living with\nAN (Touyz, Thornton, Rieger, George, & Beumont, 2003).\nWhile it is evident that group models can promote positive\noutcomes for individuals living with an eating disorder\nremains unclear whether evidence exists to support the use of\ngroup therapy for adolescents (Keel & Haedt, 2008).\nThe most commonly used model of treatment for adoles-\ncents with AN is family-based treatment (FBT), while CBT\nis preferred therapy for BN (Lock & Fitzpatrick, 2009).\nTreatment approaches for adolescents living with EDNOS\ndepend upon how closely the symptoms align with either BN\nor AN (Yager et al., 2012). Multifamily therapy (MFT) is\nposited a promising group model for young people, given its\npotential to strengthen familial relationships (Tantillo, 2006).\nAn integrative group model including art therapy and drama\ntherapy has been advocated by Diamond-Raab and Orrell-\nValente (2002); however, there are no studies examining the\neffectiveness of this model. Research on group treatments in\nadolescents is somewhat haphazard with no consistent\nthemes emerging in the literature. However, interest in group\nwork is likely to increase due to the demands on the public\nhealth system and the cost-effectiveness of group modalities\nThere exist a seemingly endless variety of group interven-\ntions (Wanlass et al., 2005) with no published papers pre-\nsenting a compilation of evidenced-based group therapy for\nthe adolescent population. This scoping review seeks to\naddress that gap.\nMethod\nA scoping study methodology was selected to examine the\nbreadth of available evidence in relation to group models for\nadolescents living with an eating disorder. The author fol-\nlowed the procedure outlined by Arksey and O'Malley\n(2005). The purpose of applying a scoping study framework\nwas to map available evidence, summarize research findings,\nidentify research gaps, and to determine the value of under-\ntaking a systematic review. The framework provided by\nArksey and O'Malley facilitated this process. The stages of\nthis research included the following: identifying the research\nquestion, identifying relevant studies, study selection, chart-\ning the data, collating the data, summarizing the data, and\nreporting the results.\nIn April and May 2013, an exhaustive search of the litera-\nture was conducted to identify studies that responded to the\nquestion: What evidence exists to support the use of group\ntherapy for adolescents living with an eating disorder? For\nthe purposes of this research, \"group therapy\" is defined as\n\"a meeting of two or more people for a common therapeutic\npurpose or to achieve a common goal\" (Centre for Substance\nAbuse Treatment, p. xxv). The World Health Organization's\n(2013) definition of \"adolescents\" was selected as it is inter-\nnationally recognized and specifies an age range of 10 to 19\nyears. Finally, \"eating disorders\" was defined according to\nthe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\n(4th ed., text rev.; DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric\nAssociation [APA], 2000). This includes AN, BN, EDNOS,\nand BED.\nThe primary method of data search involved controlled\nvocabulary and keyword searches (Table 1). The thesaurus\nand subject terms in each database were used to modify the\nkeywords. In all, 11 electronic databases and 5 gray literature\ndatabases were searched for articles published between 2003\nand 2013. Articles obtained from the databases were refer-\nence checked for related studies. Second, websites of 28 key\norganizations were hand searched. The author searched these\nwebsites to identify \"hidden\" sources of knowledge on the\nsubject matter. These websites included the National Eating\nDisorder Collaboration, the Cochrane Library, and the\nCampbell Collaboration. Third, the author conversed with\nprofessionals from Eating Disorders Victoria and the\nButterfly Foundation. Three librarians from the University of\nMelbourne were also consulted.\nStudies were selected based on their capacity to respond\nto the research question (Figure 1). The reviewer made selec-\ntions by filtering articles based on their title and abstract. If\nstudies met the inclusion criteria, the full texts were reviewed.\nThe search yielded 526 references from academic databases\nand 191 results from gray literature databases. The reviewer\nidentified 11 studies that met the inclusion/exclusion criteria\nand responded to the research question. Included studies\nwere scanned for the following information: sample details,\nresearch methods, intervention type, outcomes, and study\ncontext. The data were extracted and charted as shown in the\nappendix.\nResults\nMapping the Results\nThe studies were derived from national and international\nsources with the majority of research in this area stemming\nfrom Europe. Five of the studies were conducted in England,\ntwo in Germany, one in Spain, one in Italy, and one in\nDenmark. One Australian study was included in this review\nThe most frequent use of group therapy found in this\nstudy occurred in an outpatient or day program setting and\nthe least frequent use of groups took place in an inpatient\nsetting. It is important to note that the group models from the\nvarious geographical locations were also delivered within\ndiffering health care systems. This was not exclusively com-\nmented upon within the literature.\nTable 1.

Selection flowchart.\n4 SAGE Open\nSample Characteristics\nAll participants were aged between 11 and 19 years. Of the\n377 adolescents across all studies, only 11 were male. Illness\nduration and treatment history were rarely reported with only\n3 of the 11 studies providing these data. The reported range\nof illness duration in these studies was from 2 to 6 years\n(Prestano, Lo Coco, Gullo, & Lo Verso, 2008; Pretorius et\nstudies provided information on participants' ethnicity or\ncultural background. Attrition was noted as a key issue for\nmost studies with rates of up to 37% being reported (Hollesen,\nMost studies included mixed samples of varying diagno-\nses.All 11 studies discussed the treatment ofAN; 4 discussed\nthe treatment of BN; 4 discussed the treatment of EDNOS;\nand none discussed the treatment of BED.\nResearch Methods\nIn the past 10 years, there have been no published random-\nized-controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the use of group\ntherapy for adolescents living with an eating disorder. The\nmost rigorous studies on this topic area are program evalua-\ntions. All program evaluations sought to measure outcomes\nby assessing a decrease in eating disorder symptomatology,\nand there were 26 different measurement tools noted across\nall studies. The most commonly used outcome measure was\nbody mass index (BMI; Goldstein et al., 2011; Hollesen et\net al., 2012; Salbach-Andrae, Bohnekamp, Pfeiffer, &\nLehmkuhl, 2008). Other common measurement tools\nincluded the following: the Self-Esteem in Eating\nQuestionnaire (SEED; Lazaro et al., 2011; Prestano et al.,\n2008), the Eating Disorder Inventory 1 (EDI; Hollesen et al.,\nInterventions\nSeven different types of group interventions were identified\nthrough this review, including transition program, DBT,\nMFT, friends group, cognitive remediation therapy (CRT),\ngroup analytic therapy (GAT), and social skills and self-\nesteem (SSE) groups. These interventions were described\nand/or evaluated in each study.\nThe most common intervention in the literature was MFT;\nhowever, the models of this therapy varied in each study.\nScholz, Rix, Scholz, Gantchev, and Thomke (2005) pre-\nsented a MFT model aimed at symptom reduction and\nstrengthening family relationships. This approach is aligned\nwith the Maudsley Model, which is fast becoming the pre-\nferred treatment approach of adolescent AN (Lock &\ndiffered from that of Scholz et al.'s, in that its aims were\ngeared toward the development of mutual support and\nempowerment as opposed to specific symptom reduction.\nSimilarly, Honig's (2005) MFT held a supportive and col-\nlaborative focus in recognition of the expertise of families\nwith a lived experience. The final MFT model located for\nthis review was focused on encouraging the reflective pro-\ncess and building positive relationships (Hollesen et al.,\nThe second most common intervention was CRT. Wood et\nal.'s (2011) CRT group was based on a manualized treatment\nfor adult individuals living with AN (Tchanturia, Davis,\nReeder, & Wykes, 2010). Similarly, the CRT model pre-\nsented by Pretorius et al. (2012) was an adaptation of a group\nCRT model for adults with AN (Genders & Tchanturia,\n2010). Both models of CRT aimed to improve various cogni-\ntive domains through the use of games and puzzles. However,\nthe models differed in the frequency and duration of treat-\nThe other interventions found through this review existed\nin isolation; that is, only one model of each intervention was\npresented. The GAT group model aimed to improve self-\nesteem and to increase participant's awareness of the rela-\ntionship between emotions and behavior (Prestano et al.,\nintervention that aimed to reduce anxiety and build confi-\ndence. Similarly, Davies's (2004) friends group aimed to\nreduce social withdrawal and build the participants' relation-\nship skills. The DBT group focused on improving emotional\nregulation skills and decreasing eating disorder behaviors\nsuch as restrictive eating and purging (Salbach-Andrae et al.,\nof several different group therapies, including CBT, narrative\ntherapy, art therapy, healthy lifestyle group, nutrition group,\nsocial eating group, and parents group. The program offered\na holistic approach with each group aimed at supporting\nrecovery and improving eating disorder symptomatology.\nTreatment Duration\nThe duration of treatments varied significantly with a range\nbetween 4 weeks and 2 years reported. Similarly, the fre-\nquency and duration of sessions differed in each study. The\nCRT group (Pretorius et al., 2012) had the lowest number of\ntreatment contact hours (3 hr total), whereas the transition\nprogram (Goldstein et al., 2011) had the highest number of\ncontact hours (approx. 200 hr).\nOutcomes\nThe type of outcome data reported varied depending upon\nthe aims of each study. The outcomes can be categorized as\nbiological, psychological, relational, and behavioral. These\nmultidimensional categories have been chosen as they reflect\nthe various components of eating disorder recovery (Tosh et\nal., 2010). Diagnosis-specific outcomes are also presented to\nhighlight what is known about group treatment approaches\nfor specific eating disorders.\nBiological Outcomes\nBiological outcomes were measured across six studies by\npre/post-BMI calculations, with one study using ideal body\nweight percentage (Ideal body weight% [IBW%]) as an\nof DBT (Salbach-Andrae et al., 2008) saw the greatest\nchange in BMI with a mean increase of 2.5 for all adoles-\ncents treated for AN. A mean post-test BMI score for BN was\nnot provided. Both the GAT (Prestano et al., 2008) and SSE\ngroups (Lazaro et al., 2011) resulted in a mean BMI increase\nof 0.9, whereas the CRT group saw a mean increase of 0.5.\nResearch on the transition program found that 15 of the 26\nparticipants who completed treatment maintained a body\nweight percentage at or above 85% of their ideal weight\n(Goldstein et al., 2011). The MFT outcomes were not\nreported using mean BMI data; however, the authors reported\nthat treatment was found to have medium effects (d > 0.5) in\nrelation to BMI (Hollesen et al., 2013).\nPsychological Outcomes\nLazaro et al. (2011) found that structured group therapy for\nself-esteem improved adolescents' perception of body shape\nand weight, perception of physical appearance, their happi-\nness and satisfaction, and their self-concept related to others.\nOf the 20 young people who completed Hollesen et al.'s\n(2013) MFT group, eating disorder symptomatology was\ngreatly reduced and the participant's interoceptive awareness\nimproved. Following treatment, 13 of the adolescents were\nin remission, 1 met the criteria for AN, and 1 met the criteria\nfor BN.\nA 2-year course of weekly GAT found that those with\nhigher psychological disturbance had poorer outcomes\n(Prestano et al., 2008). However, following treatment, four\nadolescents had recovered and one was in remission. Process\nmeasures revealed an increased commitment to therapy\namong those living with AN. This commitment to therapy\nwas not observed for the adolescents in the group living with\nWood et al. (2011) described their CRT group model as\ntargeting the participants' neuropsychological deficits. The\nauthors' clinical observations suggest that this type of group\ntherapy may facilitate cognitive flexibility and enhance par-\nticipant's capacity to see \"the bigger picture.\" Pretorius et al.\n(2012) found that four sessions of CRT resulted in a small yet\npositive effect on the adolescents' self-reported cognitive\nflexibility. While the effect size was small and motivation for\nrecovery remained stagnant, the researchers posited an\nincreased effect size with additional sessions. Motivation\nfor recovery also remained unchanged for adolescents\ncompleting the transition program (Goldstein et al., 2011). It\nwas found that those who completed the program had a sig-\nnificant change in attitudinal symptomatology and a decrease\nin perfectionism.\nThe MFT model put forth by Scholz et al. (2005) was\nreportedly successful in generating hope and reducing stigma\nand isolation. Similarly, the experiential model of MFT\n(Nesbitt & Uprichard, 2009) facilitated the development of a\nstrengths-based dialogue, while the friends group improved\nparticipant's self-esteem (Davies, 2004).\nRelational Outcomes\nThe SSE groups saw a decrease in social withdrawal of par-\nticipants and an increase in leadership (Lazaro et al., 2011).\nHowever, the researchers investigating MFT did not find the\nexpected reduction in interpersonal difficulties (Hollesen et\nal., 2013). Relational outcomes were not explicitly measured\nin other program evaluations.\nThe friends group was designed to address friendship\nissues that emerged for adolescents who were hospitalized as\na result of AN (Davies, 2004). The author reports that the\ngroup was successful in assisting participants to overcome\nisolation and relearn how to engage and eat with others. The\nfeedback provided by participants suggests that the group\nenhanced their social skills and eased their transition back\ninto the school setting.\nThe most well-received adaptation of MFT appeared to be\nbased on a model put forward by Scholz et al. (2005) for the\ntreatment of adolescent AN. The author reports success for\nmost participants in generating solidarity. This contrasts the\nstrengths-based MFT group where clinicians and families\nnoted improved relational capacity, while adolescents found\nit less useful (Nesbitt & Uprichard, 2009).\nBehavioral Outcomes\nWith group DBT, it was observed that 5 of the 11 participants\nwho completed treatment achieved remission (Salbach-\nAndrae et al., 2008). The authors describe DBT as targeting\neating disorder behavioral symptoms such as calorie restric-\ntion, excessive exercising, laxative use, food restriction,\nbody checking, purging, binge eating, and diet pill use. The\nstudy found that there was a reduction of these behavioral\nsymptoms in all participants with varying diagnoses.\nHowever, those with co-morbid mental health issues were\nless likely to reach remission. The transition program also\nnotes behavioral change as a key outcome (Goldstein et al.,\n2011). However, the authors do not discuss the specific\nbehavior changes observed in the participants.\nDiagnostic-Related Outcomes\nWhile four studies included adolescents living with EDNOS\nin their overall sample, no studies reported specifically on\noutcomes for these illnesses. Participants diagnosed with\n6 SAGE Open\nEDNOS were subcategorized as restricting/AN subtype or\nbinge-purge/BN subtype. Thus, outcomes for those with\nEDNOS varied depending upon the individual's proximity to\nan AN or BN diagnosis.\nGAT was found to be more beneficial for the treatment of\nAN than for the treatment of BN (Prestano et al., 2008). The\nSSE groups were less likely to benefit adolescents living\nwith AN compared with those with BN (Lazaro et al., 2011).\nDBT resulted in higher remission rates for participants with\nAN (Salbach-Andrae et al., 2008). Similarly, research on the\ntransition program suggests that this model of treatment may\nlead to change in behavioral and attitudinal measures of eat-\ning pathology for adolescents living with AN (Goldstein\nGAT was less successful for adolescents living with BN\n(Prestano et al., 2008). The researchers theorized that this\nwas perhaps a result of the analytic technique, which does\nnot provide explicit advice about symptom management. In\ncontrast, Lazaro et al. (2011) found that those living with BN\nwere more likely to benefit from CBT-based self-esteem and\nsocial skills groups.\nDiscussion\nA review of the literature revealed several key themes.\nThemes were selected for discussion based on their capacity\nto address the research question. Similarly, themes that sug-\ngested gaps in the literature were included for discussion to\nhighlight areas for future research.\nEvidence of Effectiveness\nThe 11 studies in this review have described various group\ninterventions that show promise in the treatment of adoles-\ncents living with an eating disorder. However, it was found\nthat there is a lack of rigorous research demonstrating effec-\ntiveness of these interventions. This is surprising given the\nubiquitous nature of group treatments. While program\ndescriptions and program evaluations provide insight on\ngroup treatment approaches, they make no claim to\neffectiveness.\nMeasuring Outcomes\nThe review provided support for the use of seven group mod-\nels, all of which assert different treatment aims and mecha-\nnisms of change.The differing aims and treatment approaches\nled to a multiplicity of outcome measures capturing different\naspects of change in the lives of the participants.\nThe most frequent outcome measure was BMI, which\nsuggests the primacy of biological recovery markers in eat-\ning disorder treatment. This may be a misleading measure of\nrecovery as weight gain does not equate to psychological\nrecovery or eating disorder severity. As evidenced in two\nan increased BMI may only serve to change the adolescents\ndiagnosis from AN or BN to EDNOS. The medical model\nmay be implicated in the emphasis on weight-related bio-\nlogical outcomes. The recovery paradigm (Commonwealth\nof Australia, 2009) provides the rationale for an increased\nemphasis upon psychosocial outcome measures.\nThe author captured the variety of treatment aims and out-\ncomes across all studies by reviewing the results from a bio-\nlogical, psychological, relational, and behavioral perspective.\nWhile the stated biological outcomes were all weight-related,\nthe psychological, relational, and behavioral outcomes var-\nied depending upon the aims of treatment. In addition to\nBMI, 25 different tools were used to measure change in the\npsychological, relational, and behavioral domains. This\nplethora of tools aimed at measuring various eating disorder\nsymptoms acknowledges that one-dimensional change can-\nnot accurately capture the recovery process (Tosh et al.,\nInterventions\nWhile CBT appears to be the most common treatment\napproach for adult eating disorders (Keel & Haedt, 2008),\nMFT is the most frequently documented in the literature on\ngroup approaches for adolescents. The interest in MFT may\nstem from findings related to FBT in the treatment of young\npeople with AN (Keel & Haedt, 2008) and BN (Le Grange,\nCrosby, Rathouz, & Levental, 2007). MFT is also an\napproach that acknowledges the role of the family system in\na young person's recovery (Scholz et al., 2005). While MFT\ndemonstrated potential in the treatment of adolescents living\nwith AN (Hollesen et al., 2013), CBT was found to be more\nbeneficial for those living with BN (Lazaro et al., 2011). This\nis consistent with the findings for BN among the adult popu-\nResearch on CRT, DBT, SSE, the transition program, and\nthe friends group has demonstrated a variety of differing\napproaches in treating adolescents living with an eating dis-\norder. The research context for the treatment of adult eating\ndisorders points to the potential for other group models such\nas IPT (Agras et al., 1995) and motivational interviewing\n(Touyz et al., 2003). Research on older populations can act as\na guide for future development in the treatment of young\npeople. The interventions included in this review can also\nprovide a foundation for future research and clinical\npractice.\nAttrition\nAttrition was noted as a key issue across eight of the studies\nfound through this review. Attrition was generally described\nacross all studies relative to those participants who did not\ncomplete the course of treatment, with the study by Hollesen\net al. (2013) treating those who did not complete the\nquestionnaires and interviews as dropouts. High attrition\nrates have been found to be a pervasive problem in eating\ndisorder treatment contexts (Neeren et al., 2010; Stein, Wing,\nLewis, & Raghunathan, 2011). Several studies have been\nconducted to explore patterns of attrition; however, few have\nmanaged to accurately predict attrition rates in study partici-\npants (Abdelbaky, Hay, & Touyz, 2013). Hollesen et al.\nreported a 37% attrition rate, which was largely attributed to\npatients who did not complete diagnostic interviews and\nquestionnaires. Salbach-Andrae et al. (2008) had the lowest\nattrition rate of 8%; however, they did not discuss why the\nindividuals dropped out of treatment. Pretorius et al. (2012)\nnoted that previous CRT studies demonstrated low attrition\nrates; however, their research resulted in one fifth of partici-\npants dropping out. Some research suggests that attrition\nmay be associated with a diagnosis of AN (Abdelbaky et al.,\n2013). This may shed light on the high attrition rates found in\nthis review as AN was the most common diagnosis across all\nstudies. In addition to this, engagement is central in support-\ning strong therapeutic relationships and outcomes for treat-\nment-seeking individuals (Thompson, Bender, Windsor, &\nFlynn, 2009). Adolescents display a particularly high rate of\ndisengagement and early termination (Thompson et al.,\n2009). Further research is needed to explore patterns of attri-\ntion for adolescents living with an eating disorder.\nMissing Populations\nWhile EDNOS and BED are estimated to be the most preva-\nlent eating disorders (Deloitte Access Economics, 2012),\nmost research participants carried a diagnosis of AN.\nTherefore, outcomes noted in these studies are more likely to\nreflect the efficacy of these treatment approaches with AN\npopulations. The lack of research on BED may be attributed\nto its recent recognition as a diagnosis distinct from EDNOS.\nAwider range of participants with differing diagnoses should\nbe included in future studies to determine what works for\nindividuals living with a diagnosis other than AN.\nCultural factors were not discussed in any of the papers\nand the cultural backgrounds of participants remain unknown.\nFranko and George (2006) pointed to the influence of culture\nand ethnicity upon the experiences of those in eating disorder\ngroup therapy. This suggests the merit of considering cul-\ntural factors in future research. Similarly, what became\napparent in reviewing the literature was that males were a\nminority. This may reflect the broader prevalence statistics\nand the findings that males are less likely to seek treatment\nfor an eating disorder (Deloitte Access Economics, 2012).\nMore research on cultural factors and male populations is\nrequired to better understand the needs of these groups.\nAdverse Effects\nWhile MFT (Scholz et al., 2005) and the friends group\n(Davies, 2004) promoted positive relational outcomes, the\nemergence of unfavorable group dynamics was also\nVandereycken's (2011) concerns regarding competition,\ncomparison, and social contagion in group therapy settings.\nDavies commented upon the development of unhelpful alli-\nances between individuals and the development of competi-\ntion between individuals. Competitiveness, perfectionism,\nand low self-esteem among group members may exacerbate\neating disorders and jeopardize recovery (Vandereycken,\ndevelopment of unhelpful group dynamics that negatively\naffected the treatment group. Given the influence of peers\nupon adolescents (Gusella, 1999), the risk of unhelpful alli-\nances, competitiveness, and social contagion may be particu-\nlarly salient for the treatment of this client group. Further\nresearch on the positive and negative effects of group therapy\nfor adolescents is needed to reduce the potential harms of\nthis treatment approach.\nLimitations\nThere are several limitations of this study. First, scoping\nstudies do not appraise the evidence included for review.\nTherefore, the findings of this article can only be considered\nto be descriptive rather than evaluative. Second, thematic\nanalysis is subjective, and this must be taken into account\nwhen reviewing the findings. Third, the diagnostic criteria\nfor eating disorders have changed since the introduction of\nthe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\nresearch outcomes to the newly defined eating disorders.\nFinally, this study was conducted by a single reviewer and\nthe author notes selection bias as a key limitation of this\nreview.\nGaps and Recommendations\nThe results of this scoping review indicate that there is an\noverall lack of research on group therapy for adolescents liv-\ning with an eating disorder. The findings suggest a need for\nRCTs to test the validity of outcomes for all group therapy\nmodels in this review. Program evaluations may serve as the\nnext step to establish outcomes for the program descriptions.\nThere is also a need to build an evidence base to support the\nuse of the many group therapy models used in practice that\nremain untested. Research on adult populations may act as a\nguide for directing future studies on adolescents. A system-\natic review may further inform research directions.\nThere are no studies investigating group treatments for\nBED, and few measuring outcomes for EDNOS and BN.\nWith the addition of BED to the DSM-5 (APA, 2013),\nresearch needs to direct efforts toward establishing effective\ngroup treatments for this illness. Similarly, group models for\nEDNOS, BN, and AN require further research.\nMales were rarely included in studies and there was an\noverall lack of discussion about the needs of culturally and\nlinguistically diverse individuals. Research on group models\n8 SAGE Open\nAppendix\nData Chart.\ntreating adolescent males and culturally and linguistically\ndiverse individuals is needed to understand the needs of\nthese populations in a group treatment setting.\nFinally, attrition and adverse treatment effects were noted\nas key issues across the studies included in this review.\nGaining an understanding of the patterns that predict attrition\nmay strengthen engagement and improve outcomes for ado-\nlescents living with an eating disorder. Similarly, research\nexploring unhelpful group dynamics is needed to reduce the\nlikelihood of iatrogenic harms.\nConclusion\nThis review suggests that there is a gap in the literature\nregarding the effectiveness of group therapy for adolescents\nliving with an eating disorder. There appears to be an assump-\ntion of efficacy, which is surprising in an era of evidence-\nbased practice. Program evaluations are currently the highest\nlevel of evidence in this area, with program descriptions sug-\ngesting the value of undertaking more rigorous research. The\nprogram evaluations suggested the utility of group therapy\nfor promoting weight restoration in underweight individuals\nliving with an eating disorder. Specifically, MFT showed\npotential in the treatment of AN, whereas CBT showed\npromise for adolescents living with BN. The following rec-\nommendations were made to inform the direction of future\nresearch: (a) conduct RCTs to establish a stronger body of\nevidence, (b) research group outcomes for all eating disor-\nders with particular attention to BED, (c) investigate group\nprograms in the treatment of males and culturally and lin-\nguistically diverse populations, (d) explore patterns of attri-\ntion, and (e) examine unhelpful dynamics that emerge in\ngroup treatment contexts. There is still much to be known,\nand it is hoped that these recommendations spark the interest\nof researchers looking to make a meaningful contribution to\nthe field of eating disorders.\nNo. Study details Sample Research method Intervention Outcomes Context\n1 Author: Lazaro et al.\nAttrition: N/A\nProgram evaluation\nPre- and post-test\nSelf-report\nStructured group therapy for\nself-esteem and social skills\n(CBT-based)\nEight adolescents per group\nsessions)\nImproved perception of\nappearance, self-concept,\nhappiness and satisfaction,\nsocial withdrawal and\nleadership.\nCountry: Spain\nContext: Day program\n2 Author: Prestano, Lo\nCoco, Gullo, and Lo\nOverall: 8\nDiagnosis: AN (3),\nAttrition: 2 (BN)\nProgram evaluation\nPre- and post-test\nMixed methods\nSelf-report\nGroup analytic therapy\nweekly)\nFour recovered, one remission,\none deteriorated.
