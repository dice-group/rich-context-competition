Discussion Papers represent the authors'\npersonal opinions and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Deutsche Bundesbank or its staff.\n1 Introduction\nMany macroeconomic monthly or quarterly time series exhibit a considerable amount of\nseasonal variation, ie predictable fluctuations that recur each year in the same period\nwith similar intensity. Since it is generally agreed that economic developments are best\njudged from indicators revealing new information, seasonal adjustment, ie the removal\nof predictable seasonal variation, has become a standard tool in both official statistics\nand academic research. By osmosis, different adjustment strategies have been developed\nover the last decades (see Hylleberg (1992), Ghysels and Osborn (2001), Bell, Holan, and\nMcElroy (2012) for respective overviews), with the X-11 and ARIMA model-based (AMB)\napproaches being utilised most commonly in both fields, and the state-space approach\nbeing considered primarily in academic research. Due to their distinct backgrounds,\nthese approaches have been implemented in esoteric software packages: the X-11 method\ninitiated by Shiskin, Young, and Musgrave (1967) has been embedded in the X-11 package\nand its successors such as X-12-ARIMA (see Findley, Monsell, Bell, Otto, and Chen\n(1998)), the AMB approach has been integrated into the TRAMO-SEATS package and\nits Windows companion TSW documented by G\u00b4\nMaravall, and S\u00b4\nimplemented in the STAMP package (see Koopman, Harvey, Doornik, and Shephard\nAs a consequence, decisions of many practitioners at statistical agencies on their\npreferred seasonal adjustment approach have directly depended on the choice of their\nfavourite seasonal adjustment package, see European Central Bank (2000) for an in-\ndepth discussion. In many cases, the choice has been based on pragmatic reasons, such as\nemployees' individual backgrounds, data users' demands or the package's suitability for\nstatistical mass production. Then, all time series, or at least broad subsets thereof, have\nbeen seasonally adjusted according to the single method implemented in the favourite\nsoftware package.\nRecent releases of X-13ARIMA-SEATS and JDemetra+ may change decisions as they\njointly incorporate both the X-11 and AMB approaches alongside regARIMA/TRAMO\npretreatment. Users of either package may thus choose between the two methods for each\nparticular time series under review without the necessity of switching software, bearing\nin mind differences between the versions of X-11 and SEATS in the two packages and dif-\nferences between either version of SEATS and TRAMO-SEATS/TSW. This immediately\nraises the question of which criteria should guide the choice of approach. For that purpose,\nwe propose a decision tree that combines theoretical considerations, regarding conceptual\ndifferences between the philosophies underlying the X-11 and AMB approaches, with em-\npirical findings. Elaborating on previous work done by Webel (2013a,b), our idea extends\n(purely empirical) comparisons between the two methods, see Scott, Tiller, and Chow\nIt should be noted, however, that we do not suggest applying this decision tree as part\nof those regular seasonal adjustment routines which recur monthly or quarterly. Season-\nally adjusted figures, in particular those designated for official use, should be calculated\nconsistently over time. Therefore, changing the seasonal adjustment approach every time\nnew unadjusted data become available is not the aim of the decision tree. This is in line\nwith the general recommendation to avoid concurrent adjustment due to several draw-\nbacks, such as the high frequency of revisions and the increased risk of a highly instable\nseasonal pattern, see Item 4.2 of Eurostat (2015). Similarly, consistency of seasonal ad-\njustment approaches among components of aggregates is recommended. However, we do\nnot discuss this issue, and whether a direct or an indirect approach should be preferred\nto obtain the seasonally adjusted aggregate, see Items 3.4 and 3.5 of Eurostat (2015) for\nfurther information. Therefore, our decision tree should be understood as guidance for\nseasonally adjusting a given time series for the first time, or to assist regular reviews of\nexisting seasonal adjustment specification files, which is usually done less frequently, for\nexample annually. For aggregate series, one may apply our decision tree to all component\nseries and then choose the approach based on the most important components or the\nmajority of components.\nThe remainder of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 provides the notational\nframework as well as basic ideas of both seasonal adjustment methods considered. The\ndecision tree is presented in Section 3, followed by a detailed empirical illustration in\nSection 4 which uses selected macroeconomic time series for Germany. Finally, Section 5\ndraws some conclusions.\n2 Background\nLet {xt\n} denote the time series under review and assume that it can be decomposed\nadditively, possibly after taking logs, into two orthogonal unobserved components (UCs)\naccording to\nxt\n= st\n+ nt\nwhere {st\n} is the signal that captures the non-seasonal variation and {nt\n} is the noise that\ncontains the seasonal fluctuations. We assume for convenience that {xt\n} is linearised in\nthe sense that it has been cleaned temporarily for outliers and permanently for calendar\neffects. Seasonal adjustment is thus interpreted as a signal extraction problem which can\nbe solved by linear filtering. To see this, let x = (x1\n, . . . , xT\n) denote a finite realisation\nof {xt\n}. We may then express any estimator of the seasonally adjusted time series as\n^\ns = W x, (2)\nwhere ^\ns = (^\n, . . . , ^\nsT\n) and W  RT\u00d7T is a matrix whose t-th row, W(t), contains the\nfilter weights employed to estimate st\n. Accordingly, we may rewrite Equation 2 for each\nt  {1, . . . , T} as\n^\nst\n= W(t) x =\nT\nW(t)\nj\nxj\n,\nwhich reveals that the weights stored in W do not only depend on t but also on the\nnumber of observations available, T. Assuming for convenience that T is odd, ie T =\n2k + 1 for some k  N, the (symmetric) central seasonal adjustment filter W(k+1) and the\n(asymmetric) concurrent seasonal adjustment filter W(T) are of the greatest interest.\nTo judge the performance of any seasonal adjustment filter, we operate in the spectral\nrather than the time domain. Let  denote any linear filter transforming data {xt\n} into\noutput {yt\n} via yt\n=\nj\nj\nxt-j\n. Its gain is defined as\ng\n() =\nj\nj\nwhere  is the seasonal period, ie  = 12 for monthly data and  = 4 for quarterly data,\nand   [0, /2] is in units of cycles per year. If {xt\n} is a stationary time series with\nspectral density fx\n(), then the spectral density of {yt\n} is given by fy\n\n() fx\n().\nThe squared gain thus signals suppression of the input series' variance component over\nfrequency bands where g2\n\n() < 1 and amplification where g2\n\n() > 1. This principle also\napplies in a more general way if both input and output are non-stationary, which is the\nstandard case in seasonal adjustment, see Section 2 of Findley and Martin (2006).\nTo handle non-stationarity, seasonal ARIMA models are usually employed although\nthe motivation is quite different for the X-11 and AMB seasonal adjustment approaches.\nA time series {xt\n} is called a seasonal ARIMA process if there exists a white noise {t\n}\nsuch that\n(B)(B )dD\n\n({xt\n}) = (B)(B )({t\n}),\nwhere B is the backshift operator, ie Bkxt\n= xt-k\nfor k  Z,  = 1 - B, \nand (d, D)  N2. Furthermore,\nB - \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 - p\nBp, p\nand\nB - \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 - P\nBP , P\ndenote the non-seasonal and seasonal AR polynomials. Analogously,\nB - \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 - q\nBq, q\nand\nB - \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 - Q\nare the non-seasonal and seasonal MA polynomials. Thereby, k  N  {} for each\nk  {p, q, P, Q}. We additionally assume that all roots of these polynomials lie outside the\nunit circle, ie both AR polynomials are stationary and both MA polynomials are invertible.\nTo indicate a seasonal ARIMA model, we use the standard notation f (pdq)(PDQ)\n,\nwhere f is any particular Box-Cox transformation that may be applied to the values of\n{xt\n} prior to model fitting.\nWithin the X-11 framework, the signal of Equation 1 is composed of a trend-cyclical\ncomponent {tt\n} and an irregular component {it\n}. The former conceptually captures\nlong-term movements and periodic fluctuations whose cycles last longer than one year,\nwhile the latter captures non-seasonal short-term random shocks. Equation 1 can thus\nbe rewritten as\nxt\n= tt\n+ nt\n+ it\nApart from the prior beliefs about the movements each UC should capture, no further as-\nsumptions, possibly expressed through a parametric model, are made about their stochas-\ntic structure. Hence, the X-11 approach is referred to as non-parametric.\nEstimation of all UCs in Equation 4 is achieved through an iterative application of pre-\ndefined linear filters. Each iteration comprises several subroutines which follow a set pat-\ntern. The trend-cyclical component is estimated first by smoothing the series with either\na simple moving average or a Henderson filter, depending on the particular subroutine.\nThe latter type of filter can be chosen manually by the user or automatically according to\nthe I/C ratio, which is the ratio between the average absolute growth rates of a temporar-\nily estimated irregular component and a temporarily estimated trend-cyclical component.\nAn estimate of the seasonal component is then obtained from smoothing the detrended\nseries, also called seasonal-irregular component, for each period (month/quarter) with a\nweighted 3\u00d7k seasonal moving average, where k  {1, 3, 5, 9, 15}. As for Henderson filters,\n3 \u00d7 k seasonal filters can be chosen manually or automatically based on the (global) I/S\nratio, which is the ratio between the average absolute annual growth rates of a temporar-\nily estimated irregular component and a temporarily estimated seasonal component. In\nthe former case, different seasonal filters may be selected for different periods. To reduce\nthe size of distortions caused by extreme values in the seasonal-irregular component, the\nX-11 routine is also equipped with an automatic detection and down-weighting procedure\nfor such extremes. Eventually, removal of estimated seasonal fluctuations from the series\nyields a seasonally adjusted version. Throughout each subroutine, symmetric filters are\nused whenever possible. Otherwise, asymmetric versions are automatically applied. To re-\nduce their (usually undesired) side-effects, for example on the revisions of the most recent\nseasonally adjusted figures, regARIMA forecasts of the unadjusted figures can be used as\nthey enable application of less asymmetric or even totally symmetric filters, especially at\nthe current end of the time series under review.\nFinal X-11 seasonal adjustment filters, whose weights are stored in the matrix W of\nEquation 2, thus result from the convolution of all symmetric and asymmetric trend and\nseasonal filters chosen during each iteration step. Further details on the X-11 method are\nWithin the AMB framework, the non-seasonal intra-year variability in the unadjusted\nfigures is further specified by the irregular component of Equation 4 being decomposed as\nit\n= rt\n+ wt\n,\nwhere {rt\n} is the transitory component, which is introduced to account for fluctuations\nnot persistent enough to be considered trend-cyclical, but still too persistent to reflect\nbehaviour like white noise, and {wt\n} is white noise, which is primarily assumed to facilitate\ntesting and statistical interpreting. Equation 1 thus turns into\nxt\n= tt\n+ nt\n+ rt\n+ wt\nThe key theoretical assumption of the AMB approach states that each UC of Equation 5\ncan be represented as an individual ARIMA process. Hence, this approach is referred\nto as parametric. Excellent discussions of the stochastic structure of the trend-cyclical,\nto Equation 1, we assume that the ARIMA models for signal and noise are given by\n(k)(B)({kt\n}) = (k)(B) (k)\nt\n,\nwhere k  {s, n} and (k) and (k) are AR (including differencing) and MA polynomials\nwhose roots are assumed to lie on or outside the unit circle without sharing common roots\nfor each UC. Also, both the two AR and the two MA polynomials do not have common\n(unit) roots. The innovation sequences are uncorrelated Gaussian white noise processes\nwith finite variances 2\n(s)\n(n)\n. By construction, {xt\n} can then be represented as\n(x)(B)({xt\n}) = (x)(B)({t\nwhere (x)(B) = (s)(B)(n)(B) and\n(x)(B)({t\n}) = (n)(B)(s)(B) (s)\nt\n+ (s)(B)(n)(B) (n)\nt\nIf the amount of data available, x, is infinite and both signal and noise are stationary,\nthe minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimator of the signal, ie the estimator {^\nst\n}\nthat minimises E (st\n- ^\nst\n)2 x , is given by {^\nst\n} = (B, F)({xt\n}), where  is the Wiener-\nKolmogorov (WK) filter defined as\n(B, F) =\n(s)\n\n(s)(B)(n)(B)\n(x)(B)\n(s)(F)(n)(F)\n(x)(F)\n(1988), demonstrate that this also holds true if x is finite, as in Equation 2, and both\nsignal and noise are non-stationary.\nIn practice, however, the quantities forming the numerator of the WK filter are un-\nknown and have to be derived from the ARIMA model fitted to the observed time series.\nThe decomposition algorithm developed originally by Burman (1980), and improved by\nHillmer and Tiao (1982) and Bell and Hillmer (1984) is used for this purpose. In the first\nstep, the estimated AR polynomial ^\n(x)(B) is factorised, and its (unit) roots are assigned\nto either signal or noise according to their associated frequencies, which yields ^\n(s)(B) and\n^\n(n)(B). In a second step, the MA polynomials and innovation variances of both signal\nand noise are derived from a partial fraction decomposition of ^\n(x)(B) ^\n(x)(F). To achieve\na unique decomposition, the canonical assumption is made that the variance of the white\nnoise component is maximised, coinciding with the minimisation of the variances of all\nother UCs. If necessary, several approximations to the ARIMA model fitted to {xt\n} can\nbe considered.\nEventually, all polynomials and innovation variances constituting the WK filter are\nreplaced with their estimators to yield the estimated WK filter. Application of this filter\nto the observed time series, possibly extended with ARIMA back- and forecasts, finally\nprovides an estimate of the signal, ie the seasonally adjusted time series. Any WK filter\nthus coincides with a particular final SEATS seasonal adjustment filter and, accordingly,\nits weights directly constitute a particular row of the weighting matrix W occurring in\nEquation 2. Further details on the AMB approach are provided by the excellent overviews\n3 Decision tree\nTo choose an appropriate seasonal adjustment approach for any observed time series,\nwe propose the three-step procedure illustrated in Figure 1. We thereby consider the\ntime series' length as given exogenously. The reason is that different data generating\nprocesses (DGPs), and hence different seasonal patterns, may be identified for two time\nseries of different lengths even if their DGP was the same. In addition, we assume that\nthe amount of observations available is sufficiently large to enable reliable estimation of\nboth regARIMA model parameters and the seasonally adjusted figures.1 This should be\nkept in mind throughout this section since some phenomena studied later on, for example\npresence of seasonal heteroskedasticity, relate (more or less directly) to the length of the\nobserved time series.\n3.1 Step 1: presence of seasonality\nTo ensure that the time series is actually in need of seasonal adjustment, it is first exam-\nined for presence of stable seasonality. To do this, both descriptive statistics and formal\ntests can be calculated. Regarding the first category, the autocovariance function and the\nperiodogram of the transformed and/or differenced time series should be checked for (pos-\nitive) peaks at seasonal lags and frequencies, respectively. The automatic identification\nof a seasonal ARIMA model is another good indication of seasonality in the time series.\nRegarding the second category, the parametric F-test and the related non-parametric\nKruskal-Wallis-test can be used to detect stable seasonal pattern. Both tests perform\nANOVA-like comparisons of the (detrended) linearised time series' variability between\n1On the one hand, instability issues may arise in regARIMA model estimation for short and very\nshort series, see Item 6.1 of Eurostat (2015). On the other hand, identification of a \"correct\" model with\ntime-constant parameters may be problematic for long series. To exclude both cases, we restrict our\nanalyses to series whose lengths range between five and 25 years. In addition, we assume that they do\nnot exhibit structural breaks since this phenomenon is usually tackled by separate seasonal adjustments\nof the (shorter) subseries created by these breaks.\nThe choice between the X-11 and AMB approaches\nDeutsche Bundesbank\n\u00ad Additional knowledge about DGP\n\u00ad Visual inspection\n\u00ad ...\n\u00ad Low for seasonally adjusted figures\n\u00ad Low for changes in seasonally adjusted figures\ncompared with previous period\n\u00ad Visual inspection\n\u00ad Cochran test\n\u00ad Information criteria\n\u00ad Likelihood ratio tests\n\u00ad ...\n\u00ad Peaks at seasonal lags/frequencies in ACF/spectrum\n\u00ad Identification of seasonal ARIMA model\n\u00ad F-test\n\u00ad Kruskal-Wallis test\n\u00ad ...\nAbsence of period-specific causes of seasonality\nStep 1: presence of\nseasonality\nStep 2: conceptual\nconsiderations\nStep 3: empirical\nconsiderations\nRevisions\nAbsence of seasonal heteroskedasticity\nTransformed unadjusted figures\napproach\nAMB\napproach\napproach\nNo\nseasonal\nadjustment\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nNo\nYes\nYes\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\n\u00ad Troughs at seasonal frequencies\n\u00ad Approximately equal to one at\nnon-seasonal frequencies\nSquared gains of WK seasonal adjustment filters\nNo\nSignificant\nimprovement\ndue to\nmodifications of\nSEATS defaults\nLow importance\nfor extreme\nvalue detection\nWeighting\nin terms of\nimportance\nand within different periods, and do not require the specification of an underlying time\nseries model. Complementary, several tests on both deterministic and stochastic seasonal-\nity have been suggested under additional modelling assumptions, including, for example,\ntime series regression models with seasonal dummies, seasonal unit root processes, and\nperiodic time series models, see Sections 2, 3 and 6 of Ghysels and Osborn (2001) for an\noverview. Specific problems within these frameworks have been tackled by Busetti (2006),\ners. It should be noted, however, that tests for the presence of deterministic seasonality\nare typically less informative as they cannot appropriately handle moving seasonality.\n3.2 Step 2: conceptual considerations\nAssuming the time series exhibits a fair amount of stable seasonality, the second step\ncovers conceptual differences between the X-11 and AMB approaches. The basic idea\nis that X-11 has advantages whenever the ARIMA representation given by Equation 6,\nwhich is derived straightforwardly from the key assumptions of the AMB approach, is\nlikely to be too restrictive to adequately account for all dynamics of the observed time\nseries. This might be the case for various phenomena, but we only focus on those two of\nthem here which, according to our experience, are most relevant to practitioners.2\nThe first phenomenon is seasonal heteroskedasticity which is a particular form of\nperiodic behaviour. In theory, ARIMA processes with time-constant coefficients cannot\nmodel explicitly periodic movements and, thus, need proper augmentation to do so. For\nexample, Osborn (1991) and Tiao and Grupe (1980) propose models with time-varying\ncoefficients, whereas Bell (2004) introduces a seasonal heteroskedastic noisy component\nto the Airline model, see also Proietti (1998) for a more general discussion of possible\nmodel extensions. By construction, the AMB approach does not make use of any of\nthese augmentations: consequently, seasonal heteroskedasticity has to be captured as well\nas possible by seasonal ARIMA models with time-constant coefficients. In contrast, in\nX-11, GARCH-type effects may be taken into account, at least up to some degree, within\nthe built-in extreme value detection procedure which allows for consideration of period-\nspecific variances of the irregular component.3 However, if the importance of such effects\nis sufficiently low, application of either the X-11 or the AMB approach usually does not\n2An example not discussed here is given by integer-valued time series, such as some business climate\nindices and sentiment indicators. From a theoretical point of view, real-valued ARIMA processes might\nnot immediately qualify as a first choice of DGP model for those series, even though they still seem to\nperform quite well empirically.\n3To check the period-specific variances for equality, the one-sided test suggested by Cochran (1941),\ntwo-sided extensions thereof, and model-based tests can be employed, see Trimbur and Bell (2012) for a\nrecent discussion.\nmake a huge difference as far as seasonal heteroskedasticity is concerned, at least according\nto our experience. In addition, as mentioned above, it should be borne in mind that this\nphenomenon is related to sample size, as it is less likely to be statistically significant in\nshort and moderate-length time series. Hence, the AMB approach may be more viable a\npriori for those lengths of series.\nThe second phenomenon emerges when major sources of (moving) seasonality in ob-\nserved unadjusted figures are substantially different across periods. Usually, detection\nand proper treatment of such effects require a thorough knowledge of both economic cir-\ncumstances and data collection methods. A prime example is given by German retail\nsales in stores (see Box 1). As for seasonal heteroskedasticity, the X-11 approach can deal\nwith this phenomenon to a certain extent, as it allows for application of period-specific\nseasonal filters. In contrast, the AMB approach is intentionally designed not to model\nsuch scenarios explicitly.\nBox 1: The decreasing December peak of German retail sales in stores.\nIn Germany, and probably many other countries, retail sales in stores exhibit a sig-\nnificant peak in December which is commonly attributed to the Christmas business.\nIn the recent past, however, the usual December peak has been decreasing steadily.\nMoreover, the speed of the decrease has been faster than gradual (if any) changes\nof seasonality in all other months. There are three widely accepted explanations:\nfirst, the number of firms that ceased their Christmas bonus payments has increased\nconstantly, and those firms which continued paying Christmas bonuses have cut them\nsteadily on average compared to regular salaries; second, the market share of retail\nsales via mail order houses or via Internet has soared despite some recent coverage\nissues; third, cash has become an increasingly popular Christmas present. Overall,\nunadjusted retail sales in stores for December should be treated somewhat individu-\nally by, for example, application of X-11 seasonal filters that are shorter compared to\nall other months as these are unlikely to be affected significantly by this particular\nDecember effect.\n3.3 Step 3: empirical considerations\nIn practice, many time series behave rather less exceptionally and, hence, the phenomena\ndescribed in Step 2 do not usually suffice to select an appropriate seasonal adjustment\napproach. For that reason, the decision tree analyses further criteria, which are rather\nempirical, in a third step.\nWe first suggest looking at squared gains of selected final X-11 and WK seasonal\nadjustment filters. The reason is that central and concurrent filters are of paramount\nimportance in virtually all practical applications. Their quality should thus be assessed\ncarefully as a matter of routine, and squared gains provide an easy yet effective tool to\njudge the overall performance of any linear filter. Regarding seasonal adjustment, the key\nidea is that any \"acceptable\" seasonal adjustment filter should completely eliminate sea-\nsonal fluctuations without significantly altering movements associated with non-seasonal\nfrequencies. Assuming deterministic seasonality, the squared gain of an ideal seasonal ad-\njustment filter would thus be equal to one at non-seasonal frequencies and discontinuously\ndrop to zero at seasonal frequencies. However, as mentioned earlier, this model of how\na seasonal component should evolve is often too restrictive in practice and should thus\nbe relaxed by assuming stable stochastic seasonality, which allows the seasonal pattern\nto change gradually over time. The minimum requirement any \"acceptable\" seasonal ad-\njustment filter should meet under this relaxed assumption is that its squared gain stays\nclose to one over the range of non-seasonal frequencies and shows dips at all seasonal\nfrequencies.4 The widths of these dips can then be seen as an indication of how stable (ie\n\"close-to-deterministic\") the estimated seasonal component actually is. To mitigate over-\nand under-adjustment issues, they should match, at least approximately, the widths of\nthe seasonal peaks in the spectrum of the (transformed and/or differenced) unadjusted\nfigures, see the discussions given in Section 8.2 of G\u00b4\n3 of Maravall (1995), including some related criticism of the X-11 approach.\nBy construction, final X-11 seasonal adjustment filters satisfy this minimum require-\nment, see Bell and Monsell (1992). The only exception is the 3\u00d71 seasonal moving average\nwhich is likely to amplify significantly some intra-seasonal frequencies, regardless of the\ntrend filter. This issue, however, is less severe given the rare use of this seasonal filter in\npractice. More importantly, some attention should be paid to the unwanted amplification\nand/or suppression of (mostly intra-year) non-seasonal frequencies introduced unavoid-\nably by the finite length of real-world data. Since this issue is typical of finite filters, it\nshould be checked not only for the X-11 approach, but also for the AMB approach. In\ngeneral, final WK seasonal adjustment filters do not fulfil the minimum requirement by\nconstruction. Accordingly, their squared gains should be inspected more carefully for a\n\"strange\" curvature, which, if present, does not immediately indicate inferiority of the\nAMB method. To illustrate, transitory effects falsely assigned to the seasonal compo-\nnent are likely to lead to squared gains that are too low for a non-ignorable range of\nnon-seasonal frequencies, which may happen especially when SEATS is run with default\n4Alternative benchmarks may be established if either further assumptions are made about the DGP\nand its components, as in structural time series models, see Harvey (1989), or additional restrictions are\nimposed on the spectral density of the signal's estimator, as in digital signal processing, see the appendix\noptions. Noticeable deviations from the ideal squared gain should thus be interpreted\nrather as an invitation to thoroughly study the outcome of the SEATS decomposition\nalgorithm and to make appropriate modifications, if possible.\nIf both approaches perform equally well after this spectral analysis, we suggest com-\nparing them with respect to the revisions they cause in the seasonally adjusted figures\nand the period-on-period changes. The reason is that, in general terms, revisions reflect\nthe price to be paid for up-to-date figures, and, thus, are of interest for virtually all users.\nThis revision analysis, however, is not intended to be done in real-time. We do not aim\nto take into account all possible sources of revisions, see Deutsche Bundesbank (2011) for\nan overview thereof, but focus only on those due to the process of seasonal adjustment.\nA prime example is the incorporation of new observations as this has a direct impact\non which (asymmetric) seasonal adjustment filters can be applied to the unadjusted fig-\nures preceding the new data.5 Eventually, the seasonal adjustment approach which yields\nlower average revisions is chosen, which according to our experience should be in line with\ndemands of users. In this regard, we also recommend weighting the revisions in terms\nof importance for users. For example, more weight could be put a priori on revisions of\nperiod-on-period changes since statements on economic developments typically focus on\nthem rather than the seasonally adjusted figures.\nWe close this section with four caveats. First, both approaches offer far more possibilities\nfor conducting inference than considered here. This is especially true for the AMB method\nwhose parametric framework, among many other things, allows for derivation of ARIMA\nmodels for both UC estimators and revisions of these estimators. Their theoretical prop-\nerties, such as standard errors, auto- and cross-covariances, can thus be compared with\nthe empirical properties of UC estimates and revisions, respectively, to check for model\ninadequacies. Within the non-parametric X-11 framework, such comparisons cannot be\nachieved since the theoretical properties of UC estimators cannot be derived in an anal-\nogous way. Nevertheless, various variance measures have been constructed to quantify\ndifferent sources of error in X-11 seasonal adjustments, see Pfeffermann (1994) and Scott,\nSecond, even though our decision tree is largely based on differences between the\nphilosophies underlying the X-11 and AMB approaches, it should be noted that the former\nhas a model-based interpretation in the sense that we can find an ARIMA signal extraction\n5This revision analysis is fundamentally different from studying \"optimal\" (instead of \"minimal\")\nrevisions that are obtainable in a model-based framework, see the discussion in Section 8 of Maravall and\nP\u00b4\nwhose final WK seasonal adjustment filter closely mimics the respective X-11 filter. Early\ncontributions, for example Burridge and Wallis (1984) and Cleveland and Tiao (1976),\ndemonstrate this for the X-11 default filter but later studies show that this statement\nholds in a more general sense for all combinations of X-11 trend and seasonal filters. In\nmost cases, however, ARIMA signal extraction is based on decomposing Airline models,\napproach provides more flexibility in terms of an infinite number of potential final seasonal\nadjustment filters.\nThird, depending on the methodology finally chosen by the decision tree, an \"approach-\nspecific\" quality assessment should be carried out to further improve the estimation of\nthe seasonally adjusted figures.\nFourth, the decision tree is not meant to be definitive but rather a general guide, and\nits character is still prototypical. While the current version will work most of the time,\nthere will always be exceptions which may encourage further improvements, bearing in\nmind the impossibility of covering all possible situations.\n4 Illustration\nTo prove the concept of the decision tree, we run X-13ARIMA-SEATS using its Windows\ncompanion Win X-13 (version 1.0 build 150)6 with the following four German macroeco-\nnomic time series: turnover of industry originating from non-euro-area countries (TO),\noutput of main construction industry (OUT), orders received from abroad by producers of\nnon-durable consumer goods (OR) and gross domestic product (GDP). Table 1 provides\nbasic information on these series, which have already been adjusted for calendar effects\nusing regARIMA models. The underlying calculations are described in Deutsche Bundes-\nbank (2012), while further details on the theory of regARIMA models can be found in\nFor each series, the specification file closely mimics the setting used within the pro-\nduction process of official seasonally adjusted figures in Germany.7 More specifically, for\nregARIMA modelling we adopt the UC decomposition, user-defined outliers (for example,\nlevel shift sequences to account for the economic downturn starting in 2008) and criti-\ncal values for automatic outlier detection. ARIMA models are selected according to the\n6During the finalisation of this paper, version 1.1 of Win X-13 was released. It contains a slightly\ndifferent SEATS core and, thus, a replication of our analyses with this updated version could lead to\nresults that differ marginally from the outcome reported here.\n7Note, however, that macroeconomic aggregates as well as their major components are usually sea-\nsonally adjusted according to an indirect approach in official statistics. In this case, seasonally adjusted\nfigures obtained from the direct approach are considered for comparative analyses.\nTable 1: Selected metadata on turnover of industry (TO), output of main construction\nindustry (OUT), orders received from abroad (OR) and gross domestic product (GDP).\nSeries Frequency Span Reference year Unit\nautomatic model identification routines. Regarding X-11, we adopt trend and (period-\nspecific) seasonal filters as well as the way extreme values in the irregular component\nare down-weighted.8 In contrast, SEATS is first run under its default setting. We thus\ntake the position of a practitioner who already has a thorough knowledge of X-11 (plus\nregARIMA modelling) but is less experienced in AMB seasonal adjustment.\nTo check the series for presence of stable seasonality, we consider the F-tests for the\nlinearised and detrended linearised series (hereafter Fl\nand Fdl\n, respectively), the Kruskal-\nWallis-test for the detrended linearised series (hereafter KWdl\n) and the automatic ARIMA\nmodel identification. In addition, we consider the periodogram for the three monthly\nseries.\nRegarding seasonal heteroskedasticity, we use the (one-sided) Cochran-test for equality\nof period-specific variances (hereafter C), which is applied to the preliminary irregular\ncomponent (as given by output table B 13).\nTo calculate the squared gains of the final X-11 seasonal adjustment filters, which are\nnot provided by any Win X-13 output table, we use R (version 3.0.1) developed by the R\nCore Team (2013). The computations are based on Equation 3 using the weights stored in\nthe matrix W of Equation 2, which is derived according to the impulse response method\nTo analyse revisions, if necessary, we seasonally adjust truncated versions of the series\nunder review and, hence, exclude corrections of unadjusted figures from our study. During\nthis procedure, the regARIMA model is re-estimated for each truncated version. For\ntwo reasons, early observations are omitted to establish a \"burn-in\" period. First and\nforemost, a minimum of 60 observations before the starting date of the revision analysis is\nrequired by X-13ARIMA-SEATS for regARIMA model re-estimation. Second, depending\non the lengths of the seasonal filters applied to a particular series, a further expansion\n8If the decision tree is applied to a time series that should be seasonally adjusted for the first time,\nsuch adoptions are of course not possible. One may then start with default values (for automatic outlier\ndetection) and automatic built-in procedures. The latter may be particulary helpful for the selection\nof trend and seasonal filters, see Webel (2013a,b). Alternatively, both types of filters can be chosen\naccording to any criterion that defines \"best\" trend and seasonal filters, see Chu, Tiao, and Bell (2012)\nwho derive a MSE-based criterion.\nof the \"burn-in\" period is recommended to mitigate those effects at the beginning of the\nperiod that are caused by the application of asymmetric filters, which may lead to atypical\nrevisions during the early span of the period actually analysed. The revision measures\nconsidered then are the mean revision, mean absolute revision and standard deviation\nof the revisions. Also, as mentioned exemplarily at the end of Section 3.3, we put more\nweight on the revisions of period-on-period changes.\nFor each series, the entire decision-making process is finally summarised in a copy of\nFigure 1 where the respective realised path through the decision tree is highlighted with\ndark grey arrows.\n4.1 Turnover of industry\nWe first inspect the TO series for presence of stable seasonality. The three respective test\nstatistics are given by Fl\nlarger than respective critical values at any conventional level of significance, indicating\npresence of stable seasonality. A similar conclusion can be drawn from spectral analysis.\nFigure 2 shows the periodogram of the first differences of the logged linearised TO series,\nwhich is estimated from January 2006. It exhibits visible peaks at all seasonal frequencies,\nalthough the peak at the first seasonal frequency is somewhat less pronounced. Finally, the\nautomatic ARIMA model selection procedure identifies a seasonal model for the linearised\nTO series, which is the Airline model given (to two decimal places) by\nPeriodogram of turnover of industry\nDeutsche Bundesbank\n\u00ad\n\u00ad\n\u00ad\n\u00ad\n\u00ad\n\u00ad\nCycles per year\nDifferenced logged linearised series\nDecibel\n({log xt\n}),\nwhere the figures reported in parentheses underneath the parameter estimates are the\nrespective standard errors. Note that according to the model equation a multiplicative\ndecomposition is used. Overall, the TO series can be assumed to contain a fair amount\nof stable seasonality and, therefore, we advance to the conceptual considerations.\nInspecting the TO series for seasonal heteroskedasticity first, we observe that C = 0.22,\nand the critical value at a 5% level of significance, which depends on the frequency and\nthe length of the series, is given by 0.20. Thus, presence of seasonal heteroskedasticity\nis evident, albeit weakly. To underline the fragility of this result, we recalculated the\nCochran-test with the last year being omitted. The C-statistic and critical value were then\n0.18 and 0.21, respectively, indicating absence of seasonal heteroskedasticity. Since the\npresence/absence of seasonal heteroskedasticity plays a crucial role in the automatic X-11\nextreme value detection and down-weighting routine and, thus, in the estimation of the\nseasonally adjusted figures, we calculated the mean absolute difference (MAD) between\nthose months' values of the seasonally adjusted TO series which this procedure treats\ndifferently under consideration and ignorance of seasonal heteroskedasticity. Differences\noccur in 11 out of 132 months and the MAD is given by 0.33 index points. Thus, the\nimportance of seasonal heteroskedasticity for the X-11 extreme value detection routine is\nrather low, and we should not rule the AMB approach on these grounds.\nSquared gains of seasonal adjustment filters for turnover of industry\nDeutsche Bundesbank\nCycles per year\nCycles per year\nSEATS\nCentral Concurrent\nRegarding presence of month-specific causes of seasonality, our thorough knowledge\nabout the DGP of the TO series, including detailed information on data collection, does\nnot contain any sufficient hint of the need to apply different month-specific seasonal\nfilters. Hence, we still cannot decide on an appropriate seasonal adjustment approach\nand, accordingly, proceed to the empirical considerations.\nWe first compare the squared gains of the central and concurrent seasonal adjustment\nfilters obtained from the X-11 and AMB approaches, see Figure 3. To choose between the\ntwo approaches, it is necessary to introduce further preferences where both approaches\nmeet the minimum requirements outlined in Section 3.3. To exemplify, we could favour\nthe approach that yields the more stable estimated seasonal component.\nIn X-11, the 17-term Henderson filter and 3 \u00d7 9 seasonal moving averages are used.\nThe squared gains of the central and concurrent X-11 seasonal adjustment filters stay\nclose to one at virtually all non-seasonal frequencies and decrease rapidly to zero in the\nvicinity of the seasonal frequencies. However, the squared gain of the central X-11 filter\ndisplays oscillations between the seasonal frequencies and thus signals amplification or\ndampening of respective intra-year fluctuations, which is most apparent at \"close-to-\nseasonal\" frequencies. This issue is also reflected in the squared gain of the concurrent\nX-11 filter which tends to stay above one over a broad range of non-seasonal frequencies.\nThe WK filters exhibit squared gains whose curvatures are more or less similar to those of\nX-11. The peak amplification of \"close-to-seasonal\" frequencies is basically the same for\nboth central filters, and the squared gains differ only in the amplitudes of their oscillations\nat non-seasonal frequencies, which are larger for the WK filter regardless of the frequency\nrange considered. The squared gain of the concurrent WK filter stays closer to one over\nthe range of non-seasonal frequencies than the central WK filter, despite the fact that its\noscillatory behaviour is far more pronounced there compared to the squared gain of the\nconcurrent X-11 filter, and the dips at seasonal frequencies are noticeably narrower. In\nsum, the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches basically cancel, so that they\nseem to perform equally well for the TO series in terms of the spectral analysis.\nTable 2: Mean revision (MR), mean absolute revision (MAR) and standard deviation of the\nrevisions (STD) for turnover of industry.\nChanges in seasonally adjusted\nSeasonally adjusted figures figures compared with previous\n(as a percentage) month (in percentage points)\nThe choice between the X-11 and AMB approaches for turnover of industry\nDeutsche Bundesbank\n\u00ad Additional knowledge about DGP\n\u00ad Visual inspection\n\u00ad ...\n\u00ad Low for seasonally adjusted figures\n\u00ad Low for changes in seasonally adjusted figures\ncompared with previous period\n\u00ad Visual inspection\n\u00ad Cochran test\n\u00ad Information criteria\n\u00ad Likelihood ratio tests\n\u00ad ...\n\u00ad Peaks at seasonal lags/frequencies in ACF/spectrum\n\u00ad Identification of seasonal ARIMA model\n\u00ad F-test\n\u00ad Kruskal-Wallis test\n\u00ad ...\nAbsence of period-specific causes of seasonality\nStep 1: presence of\nseasonality\nStep 2: conceptual\nconsiderations\nStep 3: empirical\nconsiderations\nRevisions\nAbsence of seasonal heteroskedasticity\nTransformed unadjusted figures\napproach\nAMB\napproach\napproach\nNo\nseasonal\nadjustment\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nNo\nYes\nYes\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\n\u00ad Troughs at seasonal frequencies\n\u00ad Approximately equal to one at\nnon-seasonal frequencies\nSquared gains of WK seasonal adjustment filters\nNo\nSignificant\nimprovement\ndue to\nmodifications of\nSEATS defaults\nLow importance\nfor extreme\nvalue detection\nWeighting\nin terms of\nimportance\nTherefore, we now compare the two approaches with respect to the revisions they\ngenerate in the seasonally adjusted TO series and its month-on-month changes. The\nthree revision measures considered. Since the revisions of both the seasonally adjusted\nTO series and the month-on-month changes are consistently lower for AMB, this approach\nis preferred in line with the a priori weighting. Finally, Figure 4 shows the realised path\nthrough the decision tree for the TO series.\n4.2 Output of main construction industry\nChecking the OUT series for stable seasonality first, we observe that, as in the previous ex-\nample, the three measures considered consistently indicate presence of stable seasonality.\nMore precisely, Fl\nof the differenced linearised series, which is estimated from January 2000, exhibits visible\npeaks at all seasonal frequencies, see Figure 5. Finally, the automatic ARIMA model\nidentification yields the following Airline model:\n({xt\n}),\nindicating an additive decomposition. Overall, the OUT series should be seasonally ad-\njusted, and we advance to the conceptual considerations.\nPeriodogram of output of main construction industry\nDeutsche Bundesbank\n\u00ad\n\u00ad\n\u00ad\n\u00ad\n\u00ad\nCycles per year\nDecibel\nDifferenced linearised series\nThe Cochran-test shows strong evidence of seasonal heteroskedasticity as C = 0.25,\nwhich is significantly larger than the critical value at a 5% level of significance, given\nby 0.15. To assess the importance of this issue, as for TO, we calculated the MAD\nbetween the seasonally adjusted OUT series for those months which the X-11 extreme\nvalue detection routine treats differently under consideration and ignorance of seasonal\nheteroskedasticity. This occurs in 32 out of 276 months and the MAD is given by 1.10\nindex points. The seasonal heteroskedasticity issue has thus a strong influence, and it\nis much more severe compared to the TO series. Therefore, the X-11 approach appears\npreferable. For illustration, however, we do not make a final decision yet and keep the\nOUT series under study instead.\nSince we do not have any information on month-specific causes of seasonality, we\ndirectly proceed to the empirical considerations and compare the squared gains of the\nfinal seasonal adjustment filters, see Figure 6. Regarding X-11, the same Henderson filter\nand, with rare exceptions, basically the same month-specific seasonal moving averages are\napplied as to the TO series. Accordingly, the squared gains of both central and concurrent\nX-11 filters barely differ from this series, and a similar comment applies. Regarding\nAMB, this approach also yields acceptable results, as for the TO series. Despite some\noscillatory behaviour, the central WK filter's squared gain stays below but close to one\nat virtually all non-seasonal frequencies. Thus, amplification, especially at \"close-to-\nseasonal\" frequencies, is not an issue for this filter. Moreover, the troughs at seasonal\nSquared gains of seasonal adjustment filters\nfor output of main construction industry\nDeutsche Bundesbank\nCycles per year\nCycles per year\nConcurrent\nCentral\nSEATS\nTable 3: Mean revision (MR), mean absolute revision (MAR) and standard deviation of the\nrevisions (STD) for output of main construction industry.\nChanges in seasonally adjusted\nSeasonally adjusted figures figures compared with previous\n(as a percentage) month (in percentage points)\nfrequencies are even slightly narrower compared to the squared gain of the central X-\n11 filter. The latter statement also holds for the concurrent WK filter which, however,\nreveals a minor shortcoming since its squared gain stays between 0.8 and roughly 0.9 at all\nnon-seasonal intra-year frequencies. Associated periodic movements are thus suppressed\nin a general way. Nevertheless, the AMB approach appears to gain a small (but still\nindecisive) advantage from this spectral inspection, especially when more weight is put\non central seasonal adjustment filters.\nTherefore, we finally analyse the revisions, which are computed from January 2000.\nTable 3 shows that both the seasonally adjusted figures and their month-on-month changes\nare revised downwards by X-11 and upwards by AMB. Leaving aside mean revisions,\nthe other two measures are marginally lower for AMB for the seasonally adjusted OUT\nseries and significantly smaller for X-11 for the month-on-month changes. According to\nthe a priori weighting, X-11 is slightly preferable. Bearing in mind that the seasonal\nheteroskedasticity issue clearly favoured X-11, and the spectral inspection was slightly\nadvantageous for AMB, we finally recommend X-11 for seasonal adjustment of the OUT\nseries. The decided path through the tree, which is shown in Figure 7, is thus the same\nas for the TO series, but the final decision is different. However, note that under a\nstricter interpretation of the tree's criteria a decision could be made immediately after\nthe \"importance of seasonal heteroskedasticity\" knot, which was the same as before. This\nis symbolised in Figure 7 by the thin dark grey arrow pointing from this knot to the X-11\napproach.\n4.3 Orders received from abroad\nThe three test statistics considered to check for presence of stable seasonality amount\nto Fl\nthan respective critical values at any conventional level of significance, but the evidence\nfor stable seasonality is somewhat weaker compared to the previous two examples.

Overall, the series can be assumed to contain a fair amount of stable\nseasonality, and we advance to the conceptual considerations.\nChecking the series for seasonal heteroskedasticity first, we observe that C = 0.15,\nwhich coincides with the critical value at a 5% level of significance. Thus, the Cochran-test\ndoes not provide evidence of seasonal heteroskedasticity. Also, we do not have sufficient\nhints of the need to apply different period-specific seasonal filters and, hence, immediately\nproceed to the spectral analysis of the empirical considerations.\nRegarding X-11, the same Henderson filter and basically the same month-specific sea-\nsonal filters are applied as to the TO and OUT series. Thus, as shown in Figure 9, the\nsquared gains of both the central and concurrent X-11 filters do not differ significantly\nfrom these series, and the same comment applies as for TO. Regarding AMB, the squared\ngain of the two WK filters exhibit an awkward curvature that signals noticeable sup-\npression of non-seasonal movements whose periods are shorter than six months.

In particular, one may conjecture that transitory effects have been\nfalsely assigned to the seasonal component. Hence, we should search for appropriate mod-\nifications to remedy this situation. For that purpose, we now examine the stationary AR\npolynomial of Equation 9 and notice that it factorises as\nposing two problems. First, although the real positive root of Equation 10 is correctly\nassigned to the trend-cyclical component since its (reciprocal) modulus is larger than\nthe default threshold 0.5, it is likely to cancel with the non-seasonal MA polynomial of\nEquation 9 despite the fact that both roots do not share exactly the same modulus.9\nThis potential cancellation issue is the reason why Equation 9 reports relatively high\nestimated standard errors for all non-seasonal parameter estimates. Second, the complex\nroot of Equation 10 is in fact assigned to the seasonal component since its associated\nfrequency is approximately 0.67  which, under default settings, is sufficiently close to the\n9Apart from that, one may also argue that due to its small (reciprocal) modulus the real positive\nroot of Equation 10 generates movements that are not persistent enough to be considered trend-cyclical\nbehaviour, and should be assigned to the transitory component instead.\nSquared gains of seasonal adjustment filters for orders received from abroad\nDeutsche Bundesbank\nCycles per year\nCycles per year\nConcurrent\nCentral\nSEATS (modified)\nSEATS (default)\nfourth seasonal frequency, 2/3.\nTo tackle both problems, we drop the (almost) common AR and MA root from the\nyields\n({log xt\nAs expected, all remaining parameter estimates are basically left unchanged compared to\nmodel. What is more, the standard errors of the two non-seasonal pa-\nrameter estimates are now greatly reduced. However, the complex AR root of Equation 11\nis still associated with the seasonal component. To enforce its allocation to the transitory\ncomponent, we additionally reduce the range of \"near-seasonal\" frequencies to a suffi-\nciently small interval. As a result, the seasonal component captures only \"true\" seasonal\nfluctuations as its assigned AR polynomial now coincides with the annual aggregation\noperator that is part of the seasonal differencing operator in Equation 11.

As a\nconsequence, there is no need to compare the two approaches with respect to revisions to\narrive at a final decision, see Figure 11 for the path through the tree chosen for the OR\nseries.\nHowever, this example should not be misinterpreted as evidence that changing SEATS\ndefaults is generally a hopeless task. For example, Webel (2013a) provides two cases of\nsuccessful customisations of the AMB approach.\n4.4 Gross domestic product\nAs for the three monthly series, the three tests provide compelling evidence of stable\nseasonality as their test statistics, which are given by Fl\nKWdl\n= 82.483, respectively, are larger than respective critical values at any conventional\nlevel of significance.

Regarding quarter-specific causes of seasonality, Deutsche\nBundesbank (2014) provides empirical evidence of how the GDP series has been affected\nrecently by exceptional weather conditions. However, the official seasonally adjusted GDP\nseries, whose calculation we attempt to mimic as closely as possible, is not adjusted for\nweather-induced effects, in accordance with Item 2.6 of Eurostat (2015). Overall, the\napplication of quarter-specific seasonal filters is not justified clearly, and, therefore, we\nproceed to the spectral analysis of the empirical considerations.\nThe squared gains of the X-11 and AMB seasonal adjustment filters are shown in\nFigure 12. In general, it is immediately recognised that the squared gains of the WK\nfilters are far smoother than those of the X-11 filters. However, both approaches have\nadvantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, the squared gain of the central X-11 filter\nstays closer to one at most non-seasonal frequencies, despite some oscillatory behaviour\nat the intra-seasonal frequencies, and has narrower dips at both seasonal frequencies.

Hence, both approaches perform reasonably well from\nthis spectral point of view and a final choice between them cannot be made.\nTherefore, we now compare both approaches with respect to the revisions they generate\nin the seasonally adjusted GDP series and its quarter-on-quarter changes. The revisions\nfigures, they tend to be marginally lower as well as less volatile with X-11, whereas the\nconverse is true for revisions of quarter-on-quarter changes. According to the a priori\nweighting, the AMB approach is thus preferred. Finally, Figure 13 shows the realised\npath through the decision tree for the GDP series.\nTable 4: Mean revision (MR), mean absolute revision (MAR) and standard deviation of the\nrevisions (STD) for gross domestic product.\nChanges in seasonally adjusted\nSeasonally adjusted figures figures compared with previous\n(as a percentage) quarter (in percentage points)\nThe choice between the X-11 and AMB approaches for gross domestic product\nDeutsche Bundesbank\n\u00ad Additional knowledge about DGP\n\u00ad Visual inspection\n\u00ad ...\n\u00ad Low for seasonally adjusted figures\n\u00ad Low for changes in seasonally adjusted figures\ncompared with previous period\n\u00ad Visual inspection\n\u00ad Cochran test\n\u00ad Information criteria\n\u00ad Likelihood ratio tests\n\u00ad ...\n\u00ad Peaks at seasonal lags/frequencies in ACF/spectrum\n\u00ad Identification of seasonal ARIMA model\n\u00ad F-test\n\u00ad Kruskal-Wallis test\n\u00ad ...\nAbsence of period-specific causes of seasonality\nStep 1: presence of\nseasonality\nStep 2: conceptual\nconsiderations\nStep 3: empirical\nconsiderations\nRevisions\nAbsence of seasonal heteroskedasticity\nTransformed unadjusted figures\napproach\nAMB\napproach\napproach\nNo\nseasonal\nadjustment\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nNo\nYes\nYes\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\n\u00ad Troughs at seasonal frequencies\n\u00ad Approximately equal to one at\nnon-seasonal frequencies\nSquared gains of WK seasonal adjustment filters\nNo\nSignificant\nimprovement\ndue to\nmodifications of\nSEATS defaults\nLow importance\nfor extreme\nvalue detection\nWeighting\nin terms of\nimportance\nRecent releases of X-13ARIMA-SEATS and JDemetra+ provide easy access to both the\nX-11 and AMB approaches to seasonal adjustment. To assist users to choose the better\napproach for any given time series, we suggest a decision tree whose branches consider both\nconceptual differences and empirical issues. For the purpose of illustration, we use four\nmacroeconomic time series that reflect distinct fields of the German economy. According\nto these examples, the X-11 approach tends to be recommended for longer time series,\nsuch as output of main construction industry and orders received from abroad, while\nthe AMB approach is preferred for moderate-length and short series, such as turnover of\nindustry and gross domestic product. This result may be explained by the fact that some\nphenomena which in theory cannot be modelled adequately by ARIMA processes, such\nas seasonal heteroskedasticity, require a sufficient amount of data to become visible in the\nobservations.\nHowever, the decision tree is still prototypical, and further criteria should be added\nto make it production-ready. Regarding the conceptual considerations, the length of the\nobserved time series should be incorporated explicitly due to its being of key importance\nfor the two seasonal heteroskedasticity knots, amongst other things. In this regard, fu-\nture research should pay more attention to short and very short series. In addition, the\ntwo approaches could be compared with respect to the capacity to leave the seasonally\nadjusted series unchanged when the seasonal adjustment approach that has produced this\nseries is applied to it again (idempotency), the capacity to avoid introduction of spurious\nseasonality to a non-seasonal series, or the capacity to deal with cointegrating relation-\nships and/or survey errors, see Maravall (1998) and Tiller (2012) for discussions of some\nof these issues.\nRegarding the empirical considerations, the spectral analysis should be enhanced.\nFor example, comparisons between time shifts of final concurrent seasonal adjustment\nfilters (with special emphasis on the range of cyclical frequencies) and periodograms of\nseasonally adjusted figures could complement the visual inspection of squared gains, which\nitself could be improved by using distance measures to assess the gains' closeness to the\npreferred benchmark. Also, further quality criteria for the seasonally adjusted series\ncould be incorporated, including, for example, checks for absence of residual seasonality\nand stability of the estimated seasonal component.\nNotwithstanding these possible extensions of Steps 2 and 3, the idea of resorting to a\npragmatic solution may be developed further to become the fourth step of the decision tree,\nwhich relates rather to the generic culture of practitioners and the expectations of users.\nRespective branches could compare the two approaches with respect to compatibility with\nproduction systems, practitioners' expertise in time series theory, and user understanding.\nReferences\nBell, W.
