By exploring the variety,\nincongruences, and strategic considerations in the discourse on impact of those at the\nforefront of journalistic innovation, we provide a much-needed empirical account of\nthe changing conceptualisation of what journalism is and what it is for. Our data show\nhow impact becomes an ideologically as well as strategically driven endeavour as the\nentrepreneurs try to carve out their niche and position themselves both in relation to\ntraditional counterparts and other startups. Ultimately, we provide empirical insight\ninto a number of tensions that remain underlying in the discourse on constructive\njournalism, an increasingly popular conceptualisation that refers to a future-oriented,\nsolution-driven, active form of journalism. We show how our interviewees marry\ndifferent, commonly-deemed incompatible practices and values, thus challenging binary\ndistinctions at the heart of conceptualisations of journalism, also perpetuated in the\ndiscourse on constructive journalism. As pioneers in the field, startups can be argued\nto inspire journalistic as well as social innovation, and furthermore push for a more\ninclusive understanding of the divergent conceptualisations and practices that together\nmake up the amalgam that we call `journalism'.\nCorresponding author:\nTamara Witschge, University of Groningen, 9700 Groningen, The Netherlands.\nEmail: t.a.c.witschge@rug.nl\nArticle\n",

With the journalistic field facing many challenges,\nwe find that emerging forms of journalism seek to set themselves apart from mainstream\njournalism in how they define and do journalism. The emerging forms reveal the `tension\nbetween change and stasis among actors competing to define the journalistic field'\n(Carlson and Usher, 2016: 566): both the discourse on constructive journalism and the\ndiscourses of entrepreneurial journalists that we researched stress how what they do is\ndifferent, while `reinforcing existing journalistic modes and normative commitments'(p.\n568). In both, the idea that journalism needs to have an impact is central to the journalis-\ntic self-understanding. In this article, we critically investigate how entrepreneurial jour-\nnalists position themselves in relation to other journalists and society by exploring their\nunderstanding of journalism's impact in society.\nIn both the discourses on entrepreneurial and constructive journalism, the argument is\nthat society needs a type of journalism that moves beyond `mere' reporting, in which\njournalists assume a more active role in the development of events reported on. At the\nsame time, there are interesting differences between their conceptualisations of journal-\nism. Our data show that journalists'perceived role in society is complex and that the way\nthe notion of impact is used is not straightforward. We provide a layered and in-depth\naccount of their use of the notion of impact, showing it is not necessarily monolithic or\ncongruous. Moreover, it shows that innovation in journalism entails an interesting inter-\nplay between traditional and alternative conceptualisations and practices. Diverging\nfrom the mainstream holds strategic value and innovative potential, yet at the same time\nwe should not underestimate the influence of traditional conceptions of journalism,\nembodied in established and esteemed journalistic organisations and journalists that are\npart and parcel of its shared self-understanding.\nOur research data draw from interviews with 129 entrepreneurial journalists on four\njournalistic startup culture in comparative perspective: The research project `Beyond\nJournalism', led by Mark Deuze and Tamara Witschge, and the project `Entrepreneurship\nat Work' led by Tamara Witschge.2 As part of these projects, interviews have been con-\nducted by graduate students and researchers with freelance and startup journalists, as\nwell as designers and web developers at the journalistic startups where relevant, in dif-\nferent countries. These semi-structured interviews were conducted using an interview\nguide that focused on the everyday practices, routines and experiences of these journal-\nists in relation to their understanding of journalism and its societal role. The interviews\nhad an average duration of one hour.\nWagemans et al. 3\nWith this sample we have not sought representativity, but rather geographic and pro-\nfessional spread to explore diversity in practices and whether patterns can be found. To\nthis end, data were coded using a qualitative coding scheme. We investigate how those\njournalists who arguably are at the forefront of journalistic innovation consider journal-\nism's role in society. This allows us to respond to the need for analytical clarity. Providing\nthis account of how these journalistic innovators perceive and imagine journalism's role\nin society, we show the diversity in conceptualisations of the impact and role of journal-\nism. Moreover, we interrogate how these pioneers relate their strive for impact to values\nand practices of traditional journalism. Through this we provide insight into a number of\ntensions that remain underlying in the discourse on constructive journalism, as we will\nhighlight below.\nWe start with a discussion of the discourse on constructive journalism. Second, we\ndiscuss our results detailing how entrepreneurial journalists aim to have impact on differ-\nent levels: that of the individual, community and society. Third, we discuss how journal-\nists consciously position themselves by advocating alternative conceptualisations of\njournalism. The data show how journalists do not necessarily aim to present a cohesive\nor comprehensive definition of journalism, nor do their conceptualisations radically\noverhaul existing ways of classifying journalism. In the conclusion, we theorise these\njournalists as pioneers that actively and consciously construct a particular role for them-\nselves in society \u00ad thereby challenging not only other journalistic practices, but also,\nindirectly, our analytic concepts.\nConstructive journalism\nThe notion of what constructive journalism entails has not fully crystallised yet (McIntyre,\n2015: 7), and there are different proponents and closely related conceptualisations, such\nas constructive news (Haagerup, 2014), positive journalism (Dagan Wood, 2014), and\nsolutions journalism (McIntyre and Sobel, 2017). Here, it is not our aim to trace its his-\ntory or give a comprehensive account of all the actors currently active in this field, but\nrather to outline some of its main features as expressed in the discourse on constructive\njournalism. Commonly, the term is suggested to refer to quality journalism that is `future-\noriented', or in the words of its advocates: constructive journalists ask, next to the tradi-\ntional journalistic questions `who, what, where, when, why', the question `what now?'\ndiscuss solutions and contribute to solving certain societal issues (Gyldensted, 2015;\nMcIntyre, 2015 see also Hermans and Gyldensted, this issue). At the same time, propo-\nnents stress that constructive journalism is more than just covering positive news stories\nor only integrating a discussion of possible solutions (for an overview of the differences\nbetween constructive journalism and related notions, see: McIntyre, 2015: 13\u00ad16).\nInfluenced by civic and public journalism (Gyldensted, 2015; McIntyre, 2015), propo-\nnents of constructive journalism aim to empower the public, providing them with infor-\nmation and tools that either strengthen their belief in change or facilitate their actual\nSince 2015, when she published her book From Mirrors to Movers, Gyldensted has\nbecome one of the most visible advocates of constructive journalism. Gyldensted bases\nherself on `positive psychology', a sub discipline of psychology that according to\nMcIntyre (2015) aims `to find and foster the factors that allow individuals, communities,\nand societies to thrive' (p. 9). Starting point is that traditional journalism, adhering to the\nobjectivity regime, focuses too much on negative news about what is wrong in the world\nincreasing disengagement from important societal issues as the news gives them `a feel-\ning of hopelessness' (p. 6). She envisions a more active and involved role for journalists\nwhere they not only point out the wrongs, but also show how to resolve these wrongs\nConstructive journalism can be argued to be a response to a number of issues in jour-\nnalism that have been highlighted more widely in recent years. It, for instance, fits with\nthe idea that the crisis of journalism is not simply technological or economic, but ideo-\nlogical (Broersma and Peters, 2013). It responds to the declining authority of journalists\nin society that has been observed (see, for instance, Bogaerts and Carpentier, 2013;\nWahl-Jorgensen, 2017). Advocating the re-engaging of the audience and rekindling of\njournalism's role in democratic society, proponents argue that constructive journalism\naddresses a number of factors in the so-called `crisis' of traditional journalism\nIn aiming to rethink journalism's connection to the audience and journalists' role in\nsociety, constructive journalism has been met with different responses, two of which we\nwould like to highlight here. First, the emphasis on the need to offer solutions and com-\nmitment to inspire change in society is seen as negating journalists' independence and\ncritical stance (Van Genugten, 2015; Winterbauer, 2017). However, advocates emphasise\nthat their practice is not a form of one-sided coverage or `biased' journalism, and should\nnot be mistaken for advocacy journalism or activism (McIntyre, 2015; see also:\nVerheyden, 2015). Moreover, they explicitly state that constructive journalism upholds\n`journalism's core functions i.e.: Serving as a watchdog, alerting the public of potential\nthreats, disseminating important information in order to create an informed electorate'\nInterestingly, the second response also relates to this emphasis on the importance of\ntraditional values and functions for constructive journalism and questions the innovative\nnature of constructive journalism. Dutch journalist Ward Wijndelts, for example, asks\n`whether constructive journalism isn't \"just\" what every serious journalists does'(quoted\nin Smouter, 2017). Similarly, though generally positive about constructive journalism,\nVerheyden (2015) asks: adding the question `What Now?'as proposed by its proponents,\n`isn't that just journalism?' (similar questions are raised more implicitly in: Winterbauer,\n2017). As these responses suggest, advocates of constructive journalism carefully posi-\ntion themselves between adhering to and diverging from `traditional' journalism prac-\ntices and values.\nIn this balancing act, this notion has gained considerable traction: journalism curric-\nula and journalistic networks,3 research centres,4 faculty chairs,5 and symposia and con-\nferences on constructive journalism6 suggest a growing popularity of this answer to the\nso-called crisis in journalism. However, focusing on the success of this new conceptuali-\nsation may conceal a number of important things. Let us highlight two: One, it seems that\nthe popularity and attention is limited to specific regions, most prominently North-West\nWagemans et al. 5\nEurope. Second, though practitioners have been active in the development and promo-\ntion of the idea, constructive journalism, at least for now, seems to be much more a dis-\ncourse than a set of coherent and identifiable practices. The question remains: how are\nvalues put into practice? This is particularly interesting given the balancing of tradition\nand innovation that constructive journalism proposes. Rather than accepting and repro-\nducing the discourse on constructive journalism as if this is something that exists unprob-\nlematically, we need to critically explore this phenomenon empirically. Given the\nstrategic positioning within the field by its proponents vis-\u00e0-vis other actors in the field,\nit is especially important to examine how constructive journalism's core features get\ntranslated into practice and explore its place in the field of journalism.\nDoing so, we see that the core features proposed by advocates of constructive journal-\nism are not exclusively reserved for the denominator `constructive journalism', but are\nappropriated and practised more widely. Though the specific terms that the interviewees\nuse to describe it vary, our data show a clear indication of the importance of the impact-\ndriven conceptualisation of journalism among new forms of journalism beyond `con-\nstructive journalism'. More importantly, our research allows us insight into the complex\ninterplay of traditional and alternative values in journalistic understanding and practice:\nthey show how the notion of `impact' is multi-layered, and that the emerging forms of\njournalism both converge and diverge from traditional conceptualisations.\nAiming for impact in entrepreneurial journalism\nAs indicated, impact is a central theme in our interviews with 129 entrepreneurial jour-\nnalists from various continents. It is important to note here that impact is not a monolithic\nconcept: There are varying ways in which the interviewees refer to impact as main driver\nfor their work. Interviewees use different phrasings, such as `making a difference',\n`doing something that matters', `changing people's lives for the better', `driving social\nchange', `causing a chain reaction', `enabling people', and `educating people'. While a\nclear way to differentiate, this is certainly not the only means by which they position\nthemselves vis-\u00e0-vis established media and other startup media, but we focus on this\nhere, as it provides an interesting starting point in relation to the recent popularity of the\ndiscourse on `constructive journalism' (for a discussion of other ways in which startup\njournalists position themselves in the field, see, for instance, Carlson and Usher, 2016;\nThe wish to create a form of journalism that is useful for their audiences and has an\nimpact on society is a recurrent theme in the interviews. However, where the discourse\non `constructive journalism' suggests impact to be an unambiguous or simple concept,\nour data show it to encompass a variety of meanings; there are differences in the types of\nimpact that the interviewees seek or say to aspire. Here, we identify three levels, which\nwe map onto the data: the level of the individual, of the community and of society as a\nwhole. This is not to suggest a hierarchy or that these are all the ways in which impact is\nrelevant to our interviewees. However, there was a striking difference in the foci that\njournalists had when talking about the type of impact they aimed for, which shows that\nimpact is not necessarily a straightforward concept. The discussion here about the levels\nof impact that interviewees aspire to, is thus not to suggest a neat distinction, but rather\nto show the diversity present.\nThe many faces of impact\nOur data show that impact comes in many forms and guises. First, journalists aim to be\nhelpful for people on a very concrete level. Journalists strive to produce stories that are\ndirectly relevant for their audience. This means that audience members need to be able\nto recognise how a story relates or influences their own everyday lives. As the following\nquote shows, this goal of impacting their audiences directly affects the selection of their\nstories, making it an important consideration in determining what is worthy of coverage\nand what is not:\nI think that our goal is to say: `Here's a story, and here's how it directly impacts you'. And if it\ndoesn't impact our readers, if it's not something tangible, that makes them say: `Okay, this is\nhow it's going to affect me', then it's not really for us [to cover]. (Editor,7 Corner Media, USA,\nImpact at the individual level refers to journalists' desire to help people in their day-\nto-day lives by giving information about such things as traffic in town or upcoming\nevents (see Eldridge and Steel, 2016 on user's perspectives on this). Such information is\nprovided through short announcements or listicles, which enable people to anticipate\nthese events and structure their everyday lives on a practical level: `It's having useful,\njust the most useful tangible things, like event listings that are accurate that actually tell\npeople what is going on in town tonight' (Editor, Alaska Dispatch News, USA, 2016).\nImpact on the individual level, however, also involves startups helping to equip indi-\nviduals to deal with bigger problems, whether by offering advice, such as on how to\nprevent soil erosion, or by providing tools that people can use to improve their daily\nlives, such as the Medicine Price Comparison Tool and the Domestic Workers Tool\ndeveloped by C4SA. Startups aim to provoke social change by presenting information in\nnew ways, and making existing information more accessible, including through data-\nbases and tools. Impact on the individual level is aimed at empowering individual people\nby providing useful information, not only so they can improve their living conditions,\nbut also to strengthen their position as citizens (see also Baack, 2015). This focus on\nstrengthening the individual's capacity as citizens shows how even impact at the indi-\nvidual level spills over into the other levels, and how it is intertwined with impact at the\ncommunity and societal level.\nSecond, we identify a community level: startups aspire to have impact on the people\njournalists see and interact with, who are close to them either geographically or `digi-\ntally'. The following quote of this New York\u00adbased local editor illustrates nicely at\nwhich level they are seeking to have an impact:\nYou won't bring down Nixon or anything like that. But it looks like there's going to be a new\ntraffic safety light going up in the community that's going to make a dangerous intersection\nsafer, partly because of an article I wrote. (Editor, Corner Media, USA, 2016)\nThis type of community-oriented journalism includes a wide variety of activities,\nsuch as opening up possibilities for dialogue between the community and journalists or\namong different members of the community, connecting people, and sharing knowledge\nwithin the community, educating people in the community, bringing people in\nWagemans et al. 7\nthe community closer together, learning about each other, but also doing journalism to\nprevent small businesses from closing or to get a dangerous playground sorted (see also\nWe see that at this level, impact refers both to journalism that is used to solve concrete\nproblems and to promote inclusiveness, so as to strengthen the local community. This\nbecomes clear from this quote of an Alaskan editor, who states he is `happiest' when:\nProducing work that connects with the community, makes the community a better place, that\npulls the community together, that is memorable for a lot of people, that is productive, that\nmakes the community, that solves the problem. (Editor, Alaska Dispatch News, USA 2016)\nIn line with constructive journalism's aim to empower the public and facilitate and\ninspire citizens to solve issues they encounter (Gyldensted, 2015), journalists aim at\nbridging the divides they see in their communities, helping their communities overcome\nobstacles, giving voice to those who are not being heard and help making visible those\nwho have been overlooked by existing media. As such, these startups seem to share a\npolitical agenda with community media, which also aspire to give voice to and strengthen\nthe local community in which they are based (cf. Fenton et al., 2010).\nMost of these journalists come from startups that differ in organisation from their\ncommunity media colleagues, in terms of business model, which is much less based on\npublic funding, and much less relying on the role played by amateurs and volunteers in\nthe startups (cf. Fenton et al., 2010). Nevertheless, a number of these startups do involve\ncommunity members in content creation, encouraging people to actively contribute to\nthe content, so they feel part of the outlet as if it were a community itself. In addition,\nthere seems to be a greater involvement of the journalists with the people in their com-\nmunity than is the case with traditional top-down legacy media (cf. Lewis et al., 2014).\nMMU Radio, for instance, wishes to disseminate the university's research for the benefit\nof that community, and aims to facilitate an exchange of information by allowing listen-\ners, students and researchers to come to the studio and broadcast something\nthemselves:\nIf a villager here is able to come in the radio station, [he could] broadcast a program, or possibly\nteach the rest of the communities better methods of agriculture, or how to improve the\nagriculture in the vicinity here. (Radio host, MMU Radio, Uganda, 2016)\nWhere bigger newsrooms have moved out of the cities that they write about, and local\nnews tends to be less and less locally produced (cf. Fenton et al., 2010), we see that the\n`community' is a concept that is very much alive for these startup journalists, whether it\nrelates to the group of people they want to belong to, connect to, give voice to or whose\nlives they seek to improve. Moreover, some of them explicitly state they are fulfilling a\nrole in local journalism that has been neglected by large legacy outlets.\nThird, we identify the aspiration to have impact at the societal level. This connects to\nthe broader concept of the common good, where the startups' activities are seen as con-\nstructive for an abstract national or international community, or are conceived as a public\nservice. What is of interest here is that though it touches upon a similar sentiment, it also\ndiffers from the professional ideology of journalism, which traditionally includes a\nnotion of safeguarding democracy and providing a public service (Deuze, 2005).\nAlthough the discourses that ideologically position journalism refer to keeping the pow-\ners in balance, or performing a watchdog role, here this political involvement takes on a\nnew dimension for the journalistic startups in our data. In the interview material, this\npresents itself as advocacy for social causes, as activism against government policy, and\nthe organisation of and participation in demonstrations.\nWe can see this, for example, when a Radio Sagarmatha/Naya Pusta editor from\nNepal explains how they were involved in campaigns, demonstrations, and even lawsuits\nagainst non-governmental organisations (NGOs), the government, or corporations:\nWe have fought with the government in the court of law, we have been against some hydro\npowers. If those were established then it could have harmed a very rich and diverse city in\nEastern Nepal. (Editor, Radio Sagarmatha/Naya Pusta, Nepal, 2016)\nAnd even if the journalists do not go as far as to involve themselves in a court of law,\nthe French Mediapart articulated support for movements like the recent `Nuit Debout',8\nand a campaign against the construction of a dam in an ecological area,9 and co-organ-\nised an event to defend freedom of information in Greece.10 These examples show how\nthey combine activities that are traditionally labelled more journalistic with those more\nactivist (see also Benkler, 2013 on the relation between these).\nUnderstanding impact in context\nAiming to show the multi-layered and diverse nature of the concept of impact, we need\nto address the diversity in historical, social, political and economic contexts of journal-\nists. As noted above, our research locates constructive journalism in a limited geographic\nscope, most notably Western and affluent democracies. Our interviews with entrepre-\nneurial journalists worldwide show that when we want to understand the diversity of the\nconceptualisations of journalism, we need to situate the concept of impact in its contexts\n(see also Nerone, 2013). The journalists in our sample highlight the context from which\nthey are working as an important conditioning factor in terms of the type of impact they\ncan make.\nIn this light, we see that MMU Radio in Uganda primarily focuses on giving people\nbasic information and educating them about essential needs, whether it is getting a fair\nprice for their goods, achieving a successful harvest, or healthy sanitary conditions.\nCode4SouthAfrica (C4SA) in South Africa is creating tools to help citizens compare the\ndifferent prices for medication and to decide on a fair remuneration for their domestic\nworkers. Mediapart in France and IRPI in Italy also want to educate people, but are\nfocused more on exposing and changing what they believe is a malfunctioning govern-\nment system. For entrepreneurial journalists in Hungary, the belief in change is alto-\ngether more limited, and as such aspirations are adjusted accordingly. As a Hungarian\njournalist (anonymous) notes: `if the situation doesn't worsen, we're apparently having\nan impact'. In Nepal, similarly the sentiment is that change is hard to establish. This\nWagemans et al. 9\nreflects the similar discursive repertoires invoked in talking about the aims and aspira-\ntions of emerging players in journalism.\nIf we take into account the diversity of national, economic, cultural, and political\ncontexts that journalists work within, we see that we need to contextualise the main fea-\ntures identified in the discourse on `constructive journalism': what is activism in one\ncontext, is not necessarily so in another, what is an act of protest or labelled as subjective\nreporting in one instance, may be conceptualised as empowering audiences and watch-\ndog reporting in another. C4SA, for instance, defines being activist as having a social\nagenda and their members state that their goal is to achieve tangible change in society. In\nother instances, activism is defined as highlighting one side of a story, a view Radio\nSagarmatha/Naya Pusta puts forward:\nIn our part of the world the richer people have access to and they control the news. They control\npolitics. And they control the information that should reach the people. And then we are the\npeople who inform them: `this is not true'; `there is another part of the story'. (Editor, Radio\nBeyond the diversity of contexts, it becomes clear that the interviewed journalists do\nnot see it as their task to `simply' produce output, `relaying' what is going on in the\nworld; they want to make a difference, inspire change, leave a mark, and make their work\nmatter. And yes, in some cases, the journalists state they do so as activists, doing activist\nwork, or feeling involved in a `movement' rather than journalism per se. Some use the\nterm subjective, instead of activist, to refer to those instances where they give more atten-\ntion to some angle in the story because they deem it important, but underrepresented in\ntraditional outlets. They describe how they are trying to increase engagement, encourage\ndialogue or educate their audiences. They refer to caring about the subjects and the com-\nmunities they cover as an important characteristic of a journalist. We argue here, that\nrather than understanding that as part of the age-old debate between subjective, biased\nand objective reporting, or labelling it as activism rather than journalism, we need to\nunderstand these within the contexts that journalists are working from.\nRe-imagining journalism beyond dichotomies\nWe have shown in the above how journalistic entrepreneurs throughout the world focus\non making a difference, having an impact. We have also shown that both the forms of\nmaking an impact as well as the contexts from which these actors are operating are\ndiverse. These ways of viewing impact not only show diversity in the way in which\nimpact is conceptualised, but also in the conceptualisation of what journalism is and\nwhat type of journalism is needed in society. There are interesting parallels with the way\nin which authors and practitioners of constructive journalism imagine the practice and\naim of journalism. These parallels show the complexity that underlies the practices and\nunderstandings of journalism. As Ryfe (2006) states (p. 203), the rules or norms that\nguide production are in flux, and there is both `great consistency and great variability',\nand this becomes clear from our research too.\nEntrepreneurs combine and navigate between traditional and alternative values seem-\ningly effortlessly. What is more, the interviewees show a reflexivity that indicates an\nawareness of the latitude available to them to re-imagine journalism and its societal role.\nHere, we address these in turn. First, in terms of the self-understanding, we see that in the\ndiscourses of entrepreneurial journalism, the distinction between doing activism and\n`active' journalism is recognised but not necessarily experienced as tension. Whereas\nconstructive journalism proponents highlight that what they do is not activism, our inter-\nviewees do not seem to have as much qualms with taking on the title of `activist', as the\nfollowing quote illustrates:\nIn college I used to march with the student organisations before I turned into a student journalist.\n[...] Journalism affords you the opportunity to actually engage with leaders across the table,\nwhich is more civil. I'd say that I'm more of a sophisticated activist. I won't be on the streets,\n[...], I will not be jumping around, I will be in an office, but what I am doing is for the benefit\nAt the same time, our data show the multiformity of new journalistic endeavours,\nsome of which focus on `simply' providing `facts':\nThere will be a higher focus on just a factual education and then allowing the reader to make\nconclusions on their own. (Analyst, Inka Binka, USA, 2016)\nWhat makes our data particularly interesting is that they show that we cannot simply\ncontinue the perceived dichotomy of `active' versus `passive' or `neutral' versus `activ-\nist'to analyse the startups as the interviewees'understandings and practices do not easily\nor necessarily fit only one of the two categories (see also Eldridge, 2018: 35\u00ad36). The\njournalists marry or navigate between these forms with a seeming ease and elegance. For\nthem, journalists do not necessarily need to choose between `stating facts'on the one end\nor actively proposing and pushing forward a solution on the other. Both have their place\nand are not necessarily conflicting for the interviewees. This is clearly illustrated by a\nsenior editor at De Correspondent when he reflects on their campaign to get people to\nswitch to a bank that focuses more on sustainability. For him pointing out `what is going\non in the world' and propagating a certain solution or line of action are not\nincompatible:\nUltimately, it should remain journalism in essence as it is about gaining insight from the world.\nSo that can also be `these are the problems you will encounter, and this is what you have to take\ninto account'. That is gaining insight from the world. And it is not a problem if that is related to\n`do this [switch to a different bank]' (Senior editor of De Correspondent, Netherlands)\nInterestingly, this editor's reference to the `essence' of journalism that needs to be\nupheld suggests that there are limits to what can be considered journalism. At the same\ntime, though, the quote shows what is more widespread in the interviews: the breaking\naway from the idea that certain practices are incompatible with each other (see also\nBenkler, 2013). In their discourses, interviewees combine what is commonly deemed to\nbe contrasting, such as well-known oppositions like `objective' and `subjective', `neu-\ntral' and `committed', or `detached' and `involved'.\nWhat is more, the interviewees show a remarkable understanding of this:\nWhat also interests me is that journalists strive to be objective. It is never really the case, but\nyou strive to tell an objective story and inform people. But if you combine journalism with\nactivism, you've got a goal you want to achieve. That combination interests me. How to\ncombine striving for a goal with striving for objectivity. (Developer, C4SA, South Africa,\nIn general, the data point to a conscious positioning within the field by the journalists.\nTheir awareness of their own positioning, or their deliberate construction of what is jour-\nnalism seems to provide the journalists with a certain leeway in their practices and self-\nunderstanding. They actively experiment and test the boundaries of what journalism is,\nand we could argue that this in a way `liberates' the entrepreneurial journalists: It allows\nthem to break free from the naturalised and static conception of journalism that has\ndeveloped over time (cf. Deuze and Witschge, 2018). Though each startup needs to con-\nsider its niche, there seems to be much more space for alternative and rich\nconceptualisations:\nThere are a hundred different definitions of it [strong journalism] as far as I'm concerned. It's\nbeing useful to the users, to the readers, it's explaining the world, it's accountability journalism\nthat holds public institutions accountable, holding a mirror up to the community, it's providing\nstrong breaking news coverage of events that are happening as they are happening. (Editor,\nIt is perhaps precisely the fact that these startups need to find a niche audience\n(Singer, 2017) \u00ad rather than cater to and compete for the general public \u00ad that makes\nthem more open to alternative conceptualisations of what journalism is and what it is\nfor. As such, we see that the definition of what journalism is, is connected to the actual\naudience they are targeting and this can vary even for different parts within the same\ncompany, as the case of The Post Online from the Netherlands illustrates: for their\nmagazine, the niche is quality journalism `for people who are willing to consume and\npay for it', for their online free output it is the `critical tone of the content', a freelancer\nSuch niche-driven understandings of journalism suggest that understandings and\npractices are not only ideologically driven but also influenced by strategic considera-\ntions. They involve conscious targeting and catering to particular audiences, setting\nthemselves apart from competitors. This puts the traditional distinction between com-\nmercial and public interests served by journalistic organisations (Phillips and Witschge,\n2012) in an interesting new light. It is important, though, to consider that this is very\nmuch context-dependent. Though the startups are all connected by their ideological\nstance to have impact in society, the economic, political, and journalistic contexts differ\ngreatly and thus also their ability and desire to strategically and financially position their\nstartups.\nConclusion\nIn this article, we have considered a specific type of journalists, entrepreneurs, to explore\nsome of the strands in the discourse on constructive journalism. What makes this group\nof journalists particularly interesting is that they can be seen as pioneers in the field (see\nalso Hepp and Loosen, 2017), thus shaping not only the content of media, but also its\nform and thus its role in society. Hepp defines pioneering communities as `experimental\ngroupings related to new forms of media-technology related change and collectivity for-\nmation' (Hepp, 2016: 920). They `have a sense of mission' and have `a sense that they\nare at the \"forefront\" of a media-related transformation of society as a whole' (Hepp,\nsee it as their mission to seek innovation, both technological as well as ideological, to\nfurther the societal role attributed to journalism (for a reflection on how entrepreneurial\njournalists explore the affordances of digital technologies and expand the definitions of\nwhat journalism is, see also: Witschge and Harbers, 2018). Furthermore, they are aware\nof the role that they play not only in society, but also in defining what is journalism. This\nreflexivity is characteristic of pioneering communities where knowledge is `highly\n`reflexive'given that the pioneers `are engaged in a continual process of interpretation of\nOur exploration of how these pioneers understand and actively construct their role in\nsociety provides an important empirical counterpart to the discourse on constructive\njournalism. As we have discussed above, the discourse on constructive journalism sug-\ngests that impact is a straightforward notion that sets constructive journalism apart from\ntraditional forms of journalism. Of course, strategically this makes sense, as traditional\njournalism provides a clear reference point against which constructive journalism can\nposition itself, and, as all specific forms of journalism tries to, make its boundaries dis-\ntinct (Eldridge, 2018: 50\u00ad53). Yet, if anything, our analysis shows how emerging players\nin the field combine, complement, and interweave seemingly opposing practices and\nvalues, moving beyond the traditional/alternative divide. Rather than seeing the marry-\ning of seemingly opposing values and practices as necessarily problematic, such diver-\nsity and divergence in practices and values allow us to see the complexity and variety\nthat is existent in the field (Deuze and Witschge, 2018).\nAcknowledging that notions such as `constructive journalism' are not neutral or\nunambiguous, we can start to see how they are used and appropriated by journalists to\nanchor, inspire and delimit practices. As eloquently expressed by Lakoff and Johnson\n(1980), the concepts people refer to are informative about how they look at the world:\nThe concepts that govern our thought are not just matters of the intellect. They also govern our\neveryday functioning, down to the most mundane details. Our concepts structure what we\nperceive, how we get around in the world, and how we relate to other people. (p. 3)\nThe discourses and practices employed by the journalists we interviewed here, as\nsuch do not only perform a strategic role in allowing them to find their niche, to gain\ncultural or economic capital, but also challenge us as researchers. Where we have the\ntendency to neatly categorise the tensions, trying to `explain' contradictions, these\npractices show us, or perhaps highlight and remind us of the complexity of the field (see\nWe have shown how the practices and discourses of entrepreneurial journalists both con-\nfirm and challenge traditional conceptualisations and delineations. This shows how neither\nthe discourse on constructive journalism, nor the definitions that entrepreneurs hold of jour-\nnalism provide any definitive answers to the long-lasting debate about what journalism is and\nwhat it should be. The interviewees remind us that the practice and conceptualisation of jour-\nnalism is an on-going, context-specific, and diverse process, rather than a static and fixed\nproject and that dichotomies long put at the centre of our understanding and analysis of jour-\nnalism are not as informative as we consider them to be (see also Witschge e t al., 2018)\u00ad\nwhether they relate to `neutrality' versus `engagement', `subjectivity' versus `objectivity' or\n`informing' versus `activating' the audience. Our challenge is to develop ways to theorise\nconcurrent practices that we have previously labelled `incompatible' or `contradictory' and\nembrace the divergent conceptualisations and practices that together make up the amalgam\nthat we call `journalism'.\n"
