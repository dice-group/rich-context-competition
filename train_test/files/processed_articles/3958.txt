With subjective measures, awareness is as-\nsessed on the basis of the observers' self-reports of their conscious experience, so that if people re-\nport that they were aware of a stimulus it is assumed that it was consciously perceived, and if they\nreport that they did not perceive the stimulus it is inferred that they were unaware of it. Even though\nthis measure fits well with our intuitive understanding of conscious and unconscious perception as\nsubjective phenomena, it is often difficult to operationalize in a sufficiently controlled manner, and\na simple lack of confidence may contribute to someone's reluctance to report having been aware of\na particular stimulus, despite having some subjective experience of it (Cleeremans, 2001; Vermeiren\n& Cleeremans, 2012). Hence, most current studies utilize an objective measure, where awareness is\nassessed on the basis of the observers' forced-choice decisions regarding different stimulus states (d9\nmeasures). It is assumed that any ability to discriminate between alternative stimulus states at a better\nthan chance level indicates that the stimuli were perceived with awareness, whereas the absence of\nawareness to the stimuli is determined as an inability to discriminate between them at an above chance\nlevel (Merikle, Smilek, & Eastwood, 2001). Subliminal perception is established by showing that\n\"primes exert an indirect influence on participants' behavior, but fail to reach awareness in a direct d9\n2 Problems with d\u00b4 measures\nIn a recent study, Vermeiren and Cleeremans (2012) evaluated the methods used to compute objective\nmeasures of awareness, showing that the standard d9 measure is not a straightforward way of assessing\nvisibility. More specifically, it is suggested d9 can be contaminated by other factors besides visibility,\nand thus may overestimate the visibility of the primes. The main concern of the paper is stated thus:\ni-Comment\nProblems in using d9 measures to assess\nsubjective awareness\nWhile we agree that the claim of unconscious perception is established, at least in a functional\nsense, when d is zero, one cannot claim that primes were actually not consciously perceived\nat the time they were presented. Other factors, such as target interference, might hinder\nparticipants'ability to report on primes they were weakly aware of at the time of presentation.\nThe authors go on to identify three such factors: the distribution of attention, target presence, and\nthe SOA between the prime and the response.\nThe first point I would like to make is that if it is true that d does not reflect visibility alone, the\nclaim that unconscious perception is established when d is zero is not always true. If factors other\nthan visibility can reduce d to chance level (zero), then primes that exert an influence on behavior for\nwhich d is zero could nevertheless be subjectively visible. As pointed out by the authors, there is a\n\"clear influence of different variations of the d task on the resulting d values.\" Owing to space limita-\ntions, I will not provide a detailed account of their results, but the point can be clarified using a simple\nexample such as the influence of task difficulty on d: someone can perform at chance level simply due\nto the task being very difficult (e.g. requiring a very fast response, the correct response is difficult to\ndetermine, etc.), while being consciously aware of the stimuli presented.\nSecond, even if all those factors are accounted for, there is still a fundamental issue that is inherent\nin d calculations and makes it difficult to completely rule out the possibility that all primes were not\nconsciously perceived at the time of their presentation. In subliminal perception studies, unconscious\nprocessing of the stimuli is assumed when d, as is measured across a sample of trials, is not signifi-\ncantly different from zero (chance performance). However, this is a null finding, which still leaves\nopen the possibility of there being differences that the statistical test was not sensitive enough to de-\ntect. Practically speaking, even when d is not statistically different from zero, and even if we assume\nthat the only influencing factor on d is prime visibility, there could still be a number of trials in which\nthe prime was visible which was not large enough to reach statistical significance.\nAn important corollary is that it is possible that some supposedly subliminal effects that have been\nreported (d was not significantly different from zero) are in reality due to trials in which the subjects\nwere aware of the prime. This potential problem is especially important to consider when analyzing\nsmall effects of supposedly subliminal stimuli. For instance, in a recent electrophysiological (ERP)\nstudy by Lu, Zhang, Hu, and Luo (2011), a small (~0.6 \u00b5V) but significant difference between the\nVPP elicited by neutral faces which were primed by masked negative and positive faces was observed.\nAlthough there are reasons to believe that unconsciously processed stimuli should elicit similar but\nweaker stimulus-specific neural activity (see for instance Shevrin, 2001), we nevertheless cannot rule\nout the possibility that some (although undoubtedly not all) of the small effects that were observed\nin this study were generated by a small number of visible trials. Citing another example, Morris,\nPelphrey, and McCarthy (2007) reported a small (less than 0.08%) but significant difference between\nthe hemodynamic responses elicited by masked faces and masked objects (in that study the hit rate\nwas reported instead of d, but the two measures are complimentary). Again, while it is certainly not\nnecessarily the case, a contamination by visible trials cannot be completely ruled out.\nHence, the above suggests that it is advisable that in addition to d, other measures should be taken\nin order to ensure that stimuli are consistently invisible. Although it is always sensible to complement\nd with subjective measures, this would not necessarily eliminate the problem, since confidence issues\nwould still apply (the visible trials could be reported as invisible due to a lack of confidence in see-\ning the stimulus). A different approach that could prove useful is to utilize bootstrapping methods in\norder to test whether supposedly subliminal effects are generated by visible or invisible trials. If the\nobserved effect is a consequence of subliminal trials that consistently generate a similar response, it\nshould be present also after the trials are resampled with replacement. On the contrary, if the effect is\ngenerated by only a small proportion of visible trials, it should not occur consistently across samples\n(because the probability of sampling visible trials would be small in this case).\n3 Concluding remarks\nIn summary, I have claimed that it is possible that even when d does not significantly differ from zero,\nthere nevertheless could be trials in which the prime is visible. This is due to both an overestimation\nof d due to other factors that are unrelated to visibility and also because chance is determined as d\nnot being statistically different from zero, which does not preclude the possibility that our statistical\ntests were not sensitive enough to detect a difference.
