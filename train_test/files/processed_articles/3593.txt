The human literature examining cognitive change in pregnancy is especially\nequivocal. Despite a relatively narrow focus on pregnancy-induced memory decline, and\nconsistent subjective reports of pregnancy-induced memory impairment, researchers have\nhad a hard time describing actual memory impairment in pregnant women using objective\nmeasures. While some studies have reported a pregnancy-induced memory decline on some\nmeasures (Brindle, Brown, Brown, Griffith, and Turner, 1991; Keenan, Yaldoo, Stress,\nFuerst, and Ginsberg, 1998; Sharp, 1993), other studies have found no difference between\nCognitive reorganization during pregnancy and the postpartum period\npregnant and non-pregnant women (Crawley, Dennison, and Carter, 2003; Casey, 2000).\nFurther confusing the picture is still other research that shows specific pregnancy-related\nadvantages in certain memory tasks (Anderson and Rutherford, 2010; Christensen, Posyer,\nIn 2007, Henry and Rendell published a meta-analysis of 14 studies, each of which\nincluded pregnant or postpartum women and a control group. Their review suggested that\nthe contradictory results with respect to memory decline in pregnant women may have been\ncaused by the use of different methodologies, the testing of distinct memory processes, and\nthe small sample sizes often employed in examining cognitive change in pregnant women.\nOther researchers have argued that the assumed pregnancy-related decline in memory\nperformance has been exaggerated, and that subjective reports of a pregnancy-induced\nimpairment result from cultural expectations of a cognitive deficit in pregnancy (Crawley,\nGrant, and Hinshaw, 2008), as well as the expectations of medical caregivers (Jackson,\nHenry and Rendell (2007) interpreted the results of their large-scale analysis to show\nthree main findings. First, pregnant women show a real, although subtle, cognitive deficit.\nSecond, memory tasks that require more effortful processing are more likely to show a\npregnancy-induced impairment. Third, postpartum and pregnant women show similar\npatterns of cognitive decline. The current review has two main aims. First, we will examine\nthe conclusions drawn by Henry and Rendell (2007) in light of recent human studies and a\nrevised meta-analysis, and contrast the conclusions that may be drawn from the current\nstate of the human literature with what is known about pregnancy and postpartum cognition\nin the non-human domain. Next, we examine a small but growing literature that suggests\nthat there are pregnancy-induced protective mechanisms designed to safeguard the mother\nand her fetus. These mechanisms involve physiological responses to nutritional agents,\nendogenous responses to mitigate stress reactivity in the pregnant and postpartum female,\nand enhanced social cognition, including facilitated processing of faces and emotions. To\ndate, research on the effects of human pregnancy on cognition have emphasized cognitive\ncosts or deficits. We consider the possibility that apparent deficits in cognition in\npregnancy and the postpartum period reflect a trade-off whereby cognitive tasks that are\necologically relevant to their current reproductive phase are facilitated. Moreover, as the\ndemands of pregnancy transitions into the demands of infant care in the postpartum period,\nthere is evidence from the non-human animal literature that enhanced cognition during\nthese periods results in a perpetual cognitive advantage in areas that would promote\nmaternal or fetal fitness.\nA review highlighting recent evidence and suggesting new avenues of future research\nis warranted at this time for several reasons. The different conclusions that have been\ndrawn from the human and non-human literature suggest that researchers investigating\npregnancy-induced cognition in women may benefit from adopting a new perspective: that\nof evolutionary psychology. Decades of research exploring memory decline in pregnancy,\nwithout the emergence of a clear picture, suggest that the absence of a functional approach\nhas made it difficult to formulate testable hypotheses that offer insight into human maternal\ncognition. Researchers may be better served by exploring avenues that serve an adaptive\nfunction or offer a survival advantage, rather than assuming cognitive decline as the result\nCognitive reorganization during pregnancy and the postpartum period\nof pregnancy. Much like turning an adaptive lens on the problem of \"morning sickness\" has\nled to its re-conceptualization from pathology to an adaptation designed to protect the\nmother and the fetus (Fessler, 2002; Flaxman and Sherman, 2000; Flaxman and Sherman,\n2008; Profet, 1992), we suggest that turning an adaptationist perspective on the question of\npregnancy-induced cognitive change may also yield surprising results.\nThe main aim of this revised meta-analysis was to examine whether Henry and\nRendell's (2007) conclusions are still accurate given that a number of studies have recently\ninvestigated cognitive changes in pregnancy, many of which have tested the conclusions\ndrawn by Henry and Rendell (2007) explicitly (Cuttler, Graf, Pawluski, and Galea, 2011;\nMaterials and Methods\nSample of Studies\nIn order to revise the meta-analysis that was performed by Henry and Rendell (2007)\nwe followed several of their inclusion criteria, including 1) the studies were written in\nEnglish, 2) had to include a sample of pregnant and/or postpartum women and a control\ngroup, and 3) included participants who were in good health and without complicated\npregnancies.\nWe broadened the inclusion criteria regarding the cognitive measures used in the\nstudies. While Henry and Rendell (2007) examined pregnancy and memory, we also\ninvestigated general cognition and processing speed. The sample of memory measures used\nin the current meta-analysis is also updated. In contrast to the 2007 meta-analysis, we\nincluded prospective memory, which is characterized as the memory for future intentions\n(e.g., remembering a previously scheduled doctor's appointment) and is in contrast to\nretrospective memory (the memory for past events). We categorized prospective memory\nby laboratory and naturalistic prospective memory tasks. For working memory, we did not\nlimit our analysis to studies that reported backwards digit span; several distinct measures of\nworking memory have been used to evaluate working memory including backwards digit\nspan, O-SPAN, and the verbal and non-verbal working memory tasks from the Stanford-\nBinet, 5th edition (SB5) (Roid, 2003). In order to discriminate between free recall and\ndelayed recall tasks we used the same criteria as Henry and Rendell (2007), with the\nexception that delayed free recall tasks were those occurring after a delay of 10 minutes,\nrather than 15 minutes, and we were, again, more liberal in allowing distinct measures of\nrecall to be employed. For processing speed we included studies that used digit symbol-\ncoding, the symbol digit modalities test (SDMT), the letter digit substitution test (LDST),\nand the speed of comprehension task of the SCOLP (Baddeley, Emslie, and Nimmo-Smith,\nFollowing Henry and Rendell (2007), we excluded studies that only reported on\nsubjective measures of cognitive functioning during pregnancy in order to facilitate\ncomparisons between objective and subjective measures. We also excluded studies that\nfailed to present adequate statistics for computing an effect size. In the current analysis, we\nincluded 13 of the 14 studies originally included in Henry and Rendell's (2007) meta-\nanalysis. The exception was McDowell and Moriarty (2000), which was excluded due to\nCognitive reorganization during pregnancy and the postpartum period\nimplicit long-term memory being excluded (they did not measure any cognitive tasks that\nwere included in the current meta-analysis). An additional eight studies were included in\nthe current revised analysis, bringing the total number of studies used to 21. Appendix A\nlists studies that were excluded from the current meta-analysis and the reason for their\nexclusion.\nStatistical Analysis\nLike Henry and Rendell (2007), we prefer to use r as a pooled effect size estimator as\nit is commonly used, not only as a correlation coefficient, but also as a standardized\nmeasure reflecting the strength of the relationship between two variables, along with a\nrandom effects model for the same reasons that are listed in their article. In order to\nperform the meta-analysis, we used the random-effects method recommended by Hedges\nand Vevea (1998), as it has been shown to better control the Type I error rate compared to a\nsecond popular method when the sample size used in the meta-analysis is small (Field,\n2001). To make comparisons between this revised meta-analysis and the original meta-\nanalysis easier, we used the same reporting format that was used by Henry and Rendell\nResults\nDemographic Characteristics\nTable 1 shows the demographic characteristics of the participants in each study. The\ntotal sample included in this meta-analysis is 22 studies, consisting of 2,041 participants.\nOne thousand and ninety-nine women comprised the control group (mean age = 29.59\n2.02). Table 1 also portrays education and parity statistics (the percentage of women who\nhave previously given birth at least once) when reported, and notes if the study reported a\nsignificant difference between the pregnant and control participants on any of the\ndemographic variables. Seven of 21 studies reported a significant difference on at least one\ndemographic variable of interest (age, education, marital status, household income, parity,\nand emotional well-being).\nCognitive reorganization during pregnancy and the postpartum period\nCognitive reorganization during pregnancy and the postpartum period\nCognitive reorganization during pregnancy and the postpartum period\nAppendix B portrays the study-level effects for each of the cognitive measures of interest.\nWhen a study reported more than one effect for a given cognitive measure, the mean effect\nsize for that study was employed in the meta-analysis.\nMeta-Analysis\nTable 2 portrays the mean effects (M), along with the upper (upper R) and lower\n(lower R) 95% confidence intervals, the Fisher transformed variance (tau), the standard\nerror of the mean (SE), the number of studies used in the analysis (K), the total sample size\n(N), and the homogeneity statistic (Q). A negative sign indicates when pregnant or\npostpartum women performed worse than control participants.\nWorking memory. We found a small, albeit significant negative impact of pregnancy\non working memory tasks (mean r = -.07), and a slightly larger trend towards impaired\nworking memory in the postpartum period (mean r = -.10).\nRecall. We found a small negative effect of pregnancy on free recall tasks (mean r = -\n.14), and a negligible impact of reproductive status on free recall performance during the\npostpartum period (mean r = -.06). Delayed free recall showed a moderate negative effect\nof pregnancy (mean r = -.20) and a small impairment when caring for an infant during the\npostpartum period (mean r = -.10).\nRecognition. We found a significant and positive effect of pregnancy on recognition\nmemory tasks, and the mean effect size was significant in our analysis (mean r = .14).\nUnfortunately, to date no studies have investigated recognition in the postpartum period.\nProspective memory. To date, no studies have investigated prospective memory in the\npostpartum period, therefore our analysis is limited to pregnancy. We found a negligible\nnegative effect of pregnancy for laboratory prospective memory tasks (mean r = -.09), and\na significant small to medium effect of pregnancy for naturalistic prospective memory tasks\nProcessing speed. Six studies contributed to our investigation of the impact of\nprocessing speed on pregnancy. Here we found a significant moderate negative effect of\npregnancy (mean r = -.33). Three studies contributed to the investigation of processing\nspeed during the postpartum period, and here we found a small, non-significant negative\neffect of reproductive status (-.07).\nGeneral cognition. For general cognitive functioning we found a significant and\nsmall negative effect of pregnancy (mean r = -.13), and a small negative effect during the\npostpartum period (-.16).\nSubjective memory. Eleven studies contributed to evaluating subjective memory\nperformance in pregnant women. Here we found a significant and moderate negative effect\nof pregnancy (mean r = -.33). No additional studies have examined subjective memory in\nthe postpartum period, so the mean effect size reported in Table 2 (mean r = -.16) is\nidentical to the effect size reported by Henry and Rendell (2007).\nCognitive reorganization during pregnancy and the postpartum period\nTable 2.

As was the case with the 2007 meta-analysis, the results for all\nvariables which included five or more studies in the current analysis showed no evidence of\npublication bias; there is no evidence to suspect that \"the file drawer problem\" (whereby\nthere is a bias in the literature towards results that are significant while non-significant\nresults sit collecting dust in file drawers), is occurring with these data.\nDiscussion: Revised Meta-Analysis\nIs There a Small and Subtle Memory Deficit Associated with Pregnancy?\nThe first conclusion drawn by Henry and Rendell (2007) is that pregnant women\nshow a subtle memory deficit on some, but not all, memory tasks. The results of our\nanalysis support their conclusion; both free recall and delayed free recall (DFR), as well as\nworking memory and naturalistic prospective memory tasks, show a significant negative\neffect of pregnancy. Laboratory prospective memory tasks showed a negative effect of\npregnancy that failed to reach significance. In contrast, recognition memory showed a\nsmall, and significant, pregnancy-induced advantage. Taken together, this newly revised\nmeta-analysis suggests that there is a pregnancy-induced deficit on some, but not all,\nmemory tasks, with the impact ranging from small to moderate.\nAre Pregnancy-Induced Memory Deficits Restricted to Tasks that Require Effortful\nProcessing?\nThe second conclusion drawn by Henry and Rendell (2007) is that tasks requiring\nrelatively effortful processing or relating to executive functioning are the most likely to\nshow a pregnancy-induced disadvantage. Evidence for this conclusion came from\nobserving that pregnant women seem to have more difficulty with memory tasks such as\nfree recall and delayed free recall (DFR), and showed more difficulty on tasks of working\nmemory, which includes an executive processing component, in contrast to memory tasks\nthat require a storage component only.\nWe were more liberal in our inclusion of memory tasks that tap working memory,\nspecifically including memory tasks that place higher demands on executive processes\n(such as verbal working memory, SB5). If the conclusion drawn by Henry and Rendell\n(2007) is correct, then we should observe increased pregnancy-induced impairment on the\nworking memory task in the revised meta-analysis; this is not what our results revealed.\nThe broader inclusion criteria and the inclusion of more studies resulted in a smaller effect\nsize for working memory (-.07 compared to -.16). Moreover, the pregnancy-induced deficit\nthat is associated with working memory is less than the pregnancy-induced deficit we\nfound in general cognitive processing (-.13), which suggests that working memory tasks are\nnot especially likely to show a pregnancy-induced deficit, but may instead be related to a\nsubtle and overall cognitive impairment related to pregnancy.\nHenry and Rendell (2007) argued that prospective memory tasks would be a strong\ntest of the claim that memory processes requiring an executive component are more likely\nto be impaired during pregnancy. In this meta-analysis we were able to include prospective\nmemory tasks, both those occurring in the laboratory and those occurring in a natural\nsetting (i.e., outside the laboratory). Here we found a significant, medium, pregnancy-\nCognitive reorganization during pregnancy and the postpartum period\ninduced impairment in tasks of naturalistic prospective memory, and a small, non-\nsignificant effect of laboratory prospective memory tasks. Rendell and Henry (2008) and\nCuttler et al. (2011), report that pregnant women performed worse than non-pregnant\ncontrols on prospective memory tasks outside of the laboratory setting; the authors argue\nthat the more natural settings, which inherently possess more distractions than laboratory\nsettings, are more sensitive to pregnancy-induced memory impairment.\nThe results of the current meta-analysis suggest that naturalistic prospective memory\ntasks are impaired during pregnancy, and it may be that the cognitive effort involved in\nthese tasks is underlying the impairment. However, the inclusion of more difficult working\nmemory tasks along with a decreased pregnancy-induced deficit compared to the 2007\nanalysis, suggests that alternative explanations may be more fruitful. It may be that the\nobserved impairment is the result of motivational, as opposed to cognitive, factors. The fact\nthat pregnant women are not performing as well as non-pregnant women on naturalistic\nprospective memory tasks does not necessarily mean that they are failing to remember the\ntask. Instead, they may remember the task and then, being distracted by commitments that\noccur outside the laboratory setting, assign the task such low priority compared to other\npregnancy-related tasks (e.g., preparing a baby room, finishing work or home projects,\nattending doctors' appointments, etc.) that low priority tasks are not completed.\nHenry and Rendell (2007) also argue that the pattern of memory deficit observed in\npregnant women is similar to the pattern of memory deficits seen in normal aging.\nHowever, our results show that there are important differences between pregnancy-induced\nmemory deficit and memory deficit seen in normal aging. While aging populations show\nrelatively poor performance on laboratory naturalistic prospective memory tasks compared\nto younger adults, they show increased performance on naturalistic prospective memory\ntasks compared to younger adults (Rendell and Thomson, 1999) - the opposite pattern is\nobserved in pregnant women. Future investigations of how pregnancy influences\nnaturalistic prospective memory, as well as exploration of delayed intention in the lives of\npregnant women, may help to describe pregnancy-induced cognitive reorganization, and\nexplain the subjective memory impairment often reported by pregnant women.\nIn terms of recall, our results support those drawn by Henry and Rendell (2007),\nshowing that free recall and delayed free recall (DFR) show a small to moderate negative\neffect of pregnancy. Free recall tasks place a greater demand on tasks of executive\nfunctioning and so this offers limited evidence to support their conclusions.\nProcessing speed\nGiven that several recent studies have recently shown a late pregnancy-induced\ndeficit in processing speed (Anderson and Rutherford, in prep; Christensen, Leach, and\nprocessing speed as a target variable of interest in the current meta-analysis. We found that\nprocessing speed showed a significant moderate negative effect of pregnancy, and a small\nnegative effect in the postpartum period. The pregnancy-induced deficit in processing\nspeed is much larger than any of the pregnancy-induced deficits in memory reported herein.\nProcessing speed has been correlated with general intelligence (Vernon and Weese,\n1993; reviewed in Sheppard, 2008), and a pregnancy-induced deficit in processing speed\nCognitive reorganization during pregnancy and the postpartum period\nshould not be underestimated. Digit symbol-coding, a common measure of processing\nspeed, is not only or perhaps even primarily a test of processing speed, but also involves a\nmemory component (Joy, Kaplan, and Fein, 2004). Given that the pregnancy-induced\ndeficit in processing speed is the biggest negative effect that we found, and that it mapped\nvery closely to the effect size of subjective memory complaints in both pregnancy and the\npostpartum period (mean r processing speed in pregnancy = -.39, mean r subjective\nmemory in pregnancy = -.33; mean r processing speed in the postpartum period = -.20; and\nmean r subjective memory in the postpartum period = -.16), and given that processing\nspeed is thought to require a memory component, it is possible that this deficit is driving\nthe consistent reports of pregnancy-induced cognitive decline made by pregnant women\nthemselves.\nConsistent Patterns of Cognitive Performance in Pregnancy and the Postpartum Period\nThe final conclusion drawn by Henry and Rendell (2007) is that there are consistent\npatterns of cognitive performance found in pregnancy and the postpartum period. In spite\nof an increase in studies included in the current meta-analysis, we still lacked sufficient\ndata with which to accurately evaluate this claim. Given the limited evidence available, it\nseems as though cognitive performance in some areas (working memory and free recall) is\nsimilar during pregnancy and the postpartum period, whereas cognitive performance in\nother areas (processing speed) shows a distinct pattern dependent on reproductive phase.\nSelf-reports of memory impairment also suggest that cognitive performance has improved\nin the postpartum period. Future studies investigating cognition in the postpartum period\nare necessary.\nPregnancy-Induced Cognitive Change in Women: Summary of Recent Findings\nThe results of our updated meta-analysis support Henry and Rendell's (2007)\nconclusion that pregnant women possess a small cognitive deficit in some areas, such as\nrecall and naturalistic prospective memory tasks. It is unclear at this point that tasks\nrequiring relatively effortful processing are more likely to be hindered during pregnancy.\nExecutive functioning comprises a wide range of cognitive functions, and it may be that\ncertain tasks of executive functioning are impaired as the result of reproductive state while\nother tasks are not. Finally, recent studies investigating cognitive change in the postpartum\nperiod suggest that while performance on some cognitive tasks may be similar during\npregnancy and the postpartum period, other cognitive tasks are differentially impacted by\npregnancy and the postpartum period (prospective memory and processing speed); more\nresearch is needed in order to determine how these distinct reproductive phases influence\ncognition.\nThe current literature emphasizes cognitive decline as the result of reproductive state.\nAlthough new evidence suggests that cognition in pregnancy and the postpartum period\nmay be impacted in a distinct, and perhaps specialized fashion, the evidence further\nsuggests that pregnancy results in a mild impairment in general cognitive functioning and\nin a variety of memory tasks, and in a moderate deficit in processing speed. These\nconclusions are curious in light of recent reviews of reproduction-induced cognitive change\nin non-human animals. As shown in the rat literature, the neural plasticity associated with\nCognitive reorganization during pregnancy and the postpartum period\npregnancy and the postpartum period may result in long-lasting advantages in some\ncognitive domains (Kinsley and Lambert, 2008).\nCognitive Reorganization as the Result of Reproductive State\nThe animal literature emphasizes that activities directly and indirectly related to\nmaternal care are critical to the survival of both offspring and mother. For example, nest\ndefense and nursing are important maternal activities, whereas hunting and moving\nefficiently to and from the nest are not directly involved in parental care but are\nnevertheless critical for the safety and survival of the mother and her offspring. A\ndistinctive feature of the non-human animal literature is the assumption of cognitive\nreorganization rather than of memory decline, underlying these two categories of activities.\nNeuroendocrine and neuroanatomical changes observed in the maternal brain are\nthought to underlie the behavioral and cognitive advantages exhibited by maternal rats, and\nare markers of neural plasticity. The neural plasticity reported in non-human females has\nalso been found in women. For example, Kim et al. (2010) reported that brain volume\nshowed changes in grey matter in the first few months postpartum, with an increase in areas\nknown to be important for parenting. Swain (2011) cites fMRI evidence showing that there\nis a biological basis to attachment, and argues that neuroimaging work investigating the\nparental response to infants suggests neuronal plasticity in humans. Barrett and Fleming\n(2011) argue that although the brain mechanisms that underlie women's behavior are more\ncomplex than those of rodents, there may be neuroanatomical similarities in the pathways\nthat determine the approach/avoidance behaviors of rats towards pups and the push/pull\nthat women exhibit towards infants. These works suggest that there are parallels between\nhuman and non-human animals in cognitive reorganization as the result of reproductive\nexperience, at least in the domain of direct parental activities. More research is needed to\nascertain whether there are also parallels in maternal behaviors that are not directly related\nto parental care.\nMacBeth and Luine (2010) reviewed cognitive reorganization and anxiety in both\nhuman and non-human animals. Focusing on non-human animals they list several ways in\nwhich rats show cognitive enhancement as the result of reproductive state: enhanced spatial\nskills, foraging, and predator detection. Increased spatial cognition has been reported in\npregnancy and in the postpartum period (at least after weaning). Kinsley and Lambert\n(2006) also report that pregnant and parous rats show enhanced hunting skills compared to\nvirgin females. Evidence further suggests that the impact of reproductive experience on\nsome cognitive tasks, such as long-term memory and some tests of foraging skills, may be\nIn contrast to the human work that has tended to examine cognition during\npregnancy, much of the rodent work has emphasized the postpartum period, or has\ncompared nulliparous, primiparous, and multiparous females. The rodent work that has\nexamined cognition during pregnancy has likewise been equivocal, with some studies\nreporting a cognitive advantage in some tasks (Paris and Frye, 2008; Bodensteiner, Cain,\nRay, and Hamula, 2006; MacBeth, Gautreaux, and Luine, 2008) and other studies reporting\na cognitive deficit (Galea et al., 2000). Kim, Chung, Kim, and Lee (2012) also reported a\nnegative impact of pregnancy on long-term memory, although the cognitive deficit was\nCognitive reorganization during pregnancy and the postpartum period\nattenuated by the physical exercise of swimming.\nAlthough more research is needed in order to fully describe cognitive changes during\npregnancy in humans and rodents, the rodent work has tended to focus on cognitive\nreorganization as opposed to memory deficit. We suggest that the narrow focus on memory\ndecline may be eclipsing potential advantages shared by women. Adopting an evolutionary\nperspective may yield important new insights. An adaptationist approach accepts that the\ncosts associated with pregnancy may result in a cognitive deficit in some areas, but also\nrecognizes that the potential benefits associated with pregnancy may also result in an\nadvantage in other cognitive domains. A criticism that may be directed at much of the\ncurrent research investigating cognition in pregnancy and the postpartum period is that the\ntasks employed are often abstracted verbal tasks that are devoid of ecological validity and\nrelevance to everyday life. Although naturalistic prospective memory tasks occur outside\nthe laboratory, this does not necessarily suggest that they are ecologically valid. As such,\npregnant women who are vulnerable and physiologically taxed may not be motivated to\nperform. If researchers were to employ tasks that tapped a survival function, or were\nrelevant to pregnancy or infant-care, the observed pregnancy-induced deficit may\ndisappear, or may even be overturned into a cognitive advantage; evidence for this claim is\nthe pregnancy-induced advantage observed in recognition memory.\nThe current meta-analysis suggests that recognition memory is facilitated during\npregnancy. This positive result of pregnancy is curious given that the other memory\nmeasures showed a small to medium negative impact of pregnancy. It may be that there is\nsomething specific about recognition memory that facilitates cognitive functioning in\npregnant women. Two of the five studies that contributed to calculating the mean effect\nsize for recognition memory took an explicitly evolutionary approach (Anderson and\nRutherford, 2010; Christensen et al., 1999). When the effect sizes for only these studies are\nincluded, the mean effect size increases from .14 to .26, suggesting a moderate cognitive\nadvantage. This limited evidence suggests that adopting an evolutionary perspective may\nhelp to pinpoint domains where pregnant women show a cognitive advantage.\nThere is a growing body of research describing pregnancy-induced advantages in\nsocial cognition. Generating hypotheses informed by these studies may help to further our\nunderstanding of maternal cognitive processes (Anderson and Rutherford, 2010; Navarette,\nFessler, and Eng, 2007; Pearson, Lightman, and Evans, 2009). In the next section we show\nevidence of a pregnancy-induced cognitive advantage in women.\nProtective Mechanisms in Pregnancy\nPregnancy results in physiological and psychological stress. The relationship between\nstress and cognitive performance is complex (reviewed in Roozendaal, 2002), with stress\nhaving been shown to negatively impact some aspects of memory functioning while\nfacilitating other cognitive tasks. For example, chronic stress has been shown to facilitate\nspatial learning and memory (Bowman, Zrull, and Luine, 2001). Moreover, recent evidence\nsuggests that maternal experience may provide a buffer to the negative effect of stress on\nlearning (Maeng and Shors, 2012). Although the impact of stress on cognitive functioning\nduring pregnancy and the postpartum period has yet to be fully described, there is evidence\nshowing that stress can result in negative consequences for the mother and the fetus.\nCognitive reorganization during pregnancy and the postpartum period\nFurther evidence suggests that there are protective mechanisms mitigating the stress\nresponse in both rats and women.\nMaternal stress during pregnancy has been shown to have an adverse effect on the\nfetus and post-natal infant. Stress and anxiety negatively impact birth outcomes (Dole et al.,\n2003; Rondo et al., 2003), including increasing birth complications and the likelihood of\npremature birth (reviewed in de Weerth and Buitelaar, 2005). Maternal stress during\npregnancy has also been shown to negatively impact postnatal infant development\n(Bergman, Sarkar, O'Connor, Modi, and Glover, 2007; Brouwers, van Baar, and Popp,\nBuitelaar, 2003). A dampened stress response would therefore promote maternal and,\nespecially, fetal health.\nAlthough the impact of stress on cognitive functioning during pregnancy has not yet\nbeen fully described, the non-human animal literature shows evidence to suggest that there\nare mechanisms designed to attenuate stress and anxiety in females with reproductive\nexperience. MacBeth and Luine (2010) describe several lines of evidence showing that\nstress reactivity is specifically mitigated during pregnancy and the postpartum period: both\nreproductive states result in decreased neural activation in areas of the brain that are known\nto underlie stress and anxiety. Specifically, there is a mitigating effect of the hypothalamic-\npituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis on hormonal stress effects during pregnancy, pup-exposure\npostpartum decreases anxiety in new mothers, and even synaptic connectivity in areas\nunderlying stress seem to be transformed as the result of pregnancy and the postpartum\nperiod.\nThe attenuated stress response reported in rats has also been found in human females.\nde Weerth and Buitelaar (2005) reviewed stress reactivity and concluded that the stress\nresponse is dampened in pregnancy; blood pressure, heart rate, and cortisol reactivity to a\nvariety of stressors are mitigated during pregnancy. Glynn, Dunkel Schetter, Wadhwa, and\nSandman (2004) found that women in later pregnancy perceived major life events as less\nstressful than women in earlier pregnancy. For example, women who experienced a major\nearthquake in late pregnancy reported the event as less stressful than women who\nexperienced the earthquake in early pregnancy (Glynn, Wadhwa, Dunkel Schetter, Chicz-\nAttenuated stress responses and anxiety during pregnancy are not the only protective\nmechanisms associated with pregnancy in women. Morning sickness, now known as\nNausea and Vomiting in Pregnancy (NVP), was long considered an unpleasant symptom\nresulting from pregnancy, but is now believed to protect the fetus from teratogens and other\nnutritional agents that may cause harm, and is also thought to protect the mother who is\nimmunosuppressed during early pregnancy (Fessler, 2002; Flaxman and Sherman, 2000;\nMitigated stress reactivity during pregnancy, along with NVP, show that there are\nprotective physiological mechanisms designed to keep the mother and fetus safe. A\npromising line of research suggests that there are also protective mechanisms in response to\nsocial stimuli: pregnant and non-pregnant women process social stimuli in a distinctive\nfashion. Furthermore, the way in which pregnant women process social information is\ndifferent, depending on the trimester of pregnancy. For example, Navarette et al. (2007)\nCognitive reorganization during pregnancy and the postpartum period\nshowed that pregnant women display increased ethnocentrism and in-group bias in the 1st\ntrimester of pregnancy. They interpreted their results as reflecting a disease-avoidance\nmechanism, arguing that during periods of vulnerability (such as pregnancy) a preference\nfor in-group and decreased tolerance towards out-group members would decrease the\nexposure to pathogens and limit the risk of disease. This study was one of the first to show\nthat pregnant women process social information in a distinctive fashion that may serve a\nprotective function. A small but growing body of research examining the effect of\nreproductive status on face and emotion processing suggests that certain aspects of social\ncognition are enhanced in pregnant females.\nSocial Cognition in Pregnancy: Face and Emotion Processing\nBoth menstrual cycle studies and pregnancy studies suggest that reproductive status\ninfluences face and emotion processing. Pearson and Lewis (2005) reported that fear\nrecognition varies with the menstrual cycle. They found that women are best able to\nrecognize fear during the pre-ovulatory phase when estrogen levels are high. They\nemphasize the importance of fear recognition in social competence. Conway et al. (2007)\nreported that when progesterone levels are relatively high (as in pregnancy) women rate\nother peoples' fear and disgust as more intense than when progesterone levels are relatively\nlow. Derntl, Kryspin-Exner, Ferbach, Moser, and Habel, (2008) reported that progesterone\nis correlated with accuracy in emotion identification in naturally cycling women; when\nprogesterone levels are high women show a response bias in identifying negative emotions\nas anger or disgust. Like Conway et al. (2007), they interpreted the observed response bias\nas a protective mechanism to socially threatening stimuli during pregnancy. Evidently,\nthere are specialized face processing mechanisms designed to identify physical threat (fear)\nand disease threat (disgust), and the way in which women process threat depends on their\nmenstrual cycle phase.\nStudies investigating the processing of social information in pregnant participants\nhave found similar results to studies investigating the way that naturally cycling women\nprocess social information. Pearson, Lightman, and Evans (2009) reported that pregnant\nwomen show facilitated encoding of emotions denoting threat (anger, fear, disgust) and\nsadness, and suggest that there may be a cognitive bias towards threatening stimuli in late\npregnancy. They also argue that vigilance towards emotional cues will result in a survival\nadvantage. Because anxious individuals have also been found to show enhanced encoding\nof emotional expressions, they tested whether relatively high anxiety is a possible\nmechanism for enhanced encoding of emotional stimuli during pregnancy. They found no\nsupport for this hypothesis, which should be expected given the mitigated stress reactivity\nand anxiety shown to be associated with pregnancy. Pearson et al. (2009) speculate that the\nattenuated stress and anxiety response associated with pregnancy allows pregnant women\nto benefit from facilitated emotion encoding without the cost associated with increased\nanxiety. Anderson and Rutherford (2010) also examined whether pregnant women may\nshow facilitated processing of social stimuli. They found that pregnant women showed\nincreased recognition of novel faces, and that this effect was especially pronounced for\nsame-race male faces. Like Pearson et al. (2009), they argue that facilitated processing of\nfaces serves a protective function, and that because male conspecifics posed a significant\nCognitive reorganization during pregnancy and the postpartum period\nthreat throughout the ancestral past, cognitive mechanisms designed to keep the vulnerable\nmother and fetus safe may be expected.\nAs suggested by the research examining social cognition during the menstrual cycle\nand the pregnancy literature, reproductive status and reproductive experience alters the way\nwomen encode threatening social information. Like rats, who show enhanced spatial\nlearning, foraging, and predator detection abilities while pregnant; human females may also\npossess cognitive processes that are species-typical and present an advantage during\npregnancy.\nOne mechanism thought to underlie enhanced social cognition is increased vigilance\n(Anderson and Rutherford, 2010; Pearson et al., 2009). Interestingly, there is limited\nevidence that this increased vigilance may aid pregnant women even in evolutionarily\nnovel situations. Using a simulated driving task, Crawley et al. (2008) investigated whether\ndriving ability shows a pregnancy-induced deficit. Instead, they found that pregnant women\nnavigate with increased vigilance, which serves a protective function. Approximately 20%\nof the pregnant women in the study reported driving more carefully since becoming\npregnant. In contrast, in comparison to a year ago, over 50% of the non-pregnant women\nreported driving more quickly, more frequently, and more impatiently, and none of the non-\npregnant women reported increased caution. Driving performance (number of collisions)\nalso seems to be affected by pregnancy. Eight of 17 non-pregnant women were involved in\na virtual collision on at least one trial, but only 1 of 13 pregnant women was involved in a\nvirtual collision. Although Crawley et al. (2008) suggest that the results of this study\nshould be interpreted cautiously due to small sample size and a lack of controls on previous\nexperience and driving competence, these results seem to suggest that pregnant women\nadopt a more vigilant driving style than their non-pregnant counterparts.\nGeneral Discussion\nEvidence from studies investigating the impact of reproductive experience on non-\nhuman and human animals suggests that females possess species-typical protective\nmechanisms during pregnancy. Just like rats, women also exhibit an attenuated stress\nresponse in late pregnancy. Whereas rats show protective mechanisms designed to facilitate\nefficient foraging, hunting, and nest protection, women show protective mechanisms\ndesigned to facilitate some aspects of social cognition. Enhanced social cognition in human\npregnancy may serve multiple roles including efficiently identifying physical threats of\nviolence from conspecifics, affectively identifying sources of disease, and establishing\nalliances. Moreover, there is evidence suggesting that increased vigilance may serve to\nprotect pregnant women and their fetuses even in domains that are evolutionarily novel\nsuch as driving a car.\nThe results of the current meta-analysis suggest that pregnancy does result in a small,\nbut significant impairment in some memory measures, including recall and naturalistic\nprospective memory. The finding that pregnancy results in a genuine cognitive impairment\nis supported by decades of women consistently reporting pregnancy-induced deficits.\nHowever, motivational factors have not been awarded much attention, and it is possible\nthat pregnant women are lacking the motivation necessary to perform well on cognitive\nCognitive reorganization during pregnancy and the postpartum period\ntasks. Future research could investigate alternatives to actual cognitive impairment in order\nto explain the observed performance deficits. Alternatively, as described above, pregnancy\nand the early postpartum period result in decreased stress reactivity. A certain degree of\nstress is required for optimal performance, and pregnant women have shown attenuated\nphysiological stress responses to cognitive testing (Matthews and Rodin, 1992; Monk et al.,\n2001). It may be that decreased stress reactivity, which serves a protective function, also\nresults in decreased performance on some cognitive measures. However, it is also true that\npregnant women are able to perform equally well as, or better than, non-pregnant women\non some cognitive tasks, and that even tasks that show a pregnancy-induced impairment\nmay be buffered by protective mechanisms during pregnancy to help avoid threats.\nIt may also be the case that the observed cognitive deficit serves an adaptive function.\nThe fertility and parental care hypothesis describes the relatively poor female performance\non some spatial tasks as serving an adaptive function by decreasing distances traveled from\nthe nest and thereby increasing female reproductive success (Jones, Braithwaite, and Healy,\n2003; Sherry and Hampson, 1997). Support for this hypothesis has been found in rats\nrats in the third trimester of pregnancy, but not in the first and second trimester, performed\nworse than non-pregnant rats on a task of spatial working memory. They suggest a similar\nadvantage for the observed deficit; staying close to the nest in the third trimester of\npregnancy would mitigate the threat of predation, and conserve energy for parturition. As\nhas been suggested by Darnaudery et al. (2007), who found a cognitive deficit in\npostpartum rats on a task of spatial learning, a cognitive deficit in the postpartum period\nmay facilitate pup-directed behaviors; enhancing pup-directed behaviors may promote\nmaternal care and bonding.\nA genuine impairment as the result of pregnancy does not undermine the cognitive\nreorganization view espoused here. Although the costs associated with pregnancy evidently\nresult in a cognitive disadvantage in some areas, which is somewhat expected given the\nmyriad of costs associated with pregnancy, there is also evidence that areas that serve a\nprotective function for the mother and her fetus are buffered and even facilitated as the\nresult of pregnancy. An emerging body of research suggests that investigating threat-\ndetection from an evolutionary perspective may yield the most intriguing insights into\nmaternal cognition. In comparison to human males, human females show an advantage in\nprocessing social stimuli, including emotions, and this advantage is thought to occur as the\nresult of the female's role of primary caregiver (Hampson, van Anders, and Mullin, 2006).\nEvidently, women who are pregnant show an even greater proficiency in processing\npotentially harmful social stimuli in comparison to non-pregnant females. Hence, in some\naspects of social cognition (namely, threat detection), the cognitive advantages being\nreported in the rat literature are also observed in human females.\nSelf-reports suggest that memory impairments are more likely to occur in the latter\nhalf of pregnancy. Likewise, objective measures show decreased performance on some\nprocessing speed tasks in the later stages of pregnancy. However, consistent with the\nadaptationist approach we advocate, it is possible that there are protective mechanisms\naffecting processing speed; limited evidence suggests that pregnancy does not impair the\nprocessing speed of threatening information. Anderson and Rutherford (2009) reported no\nCognitive reorganization during pregnancy and the postpartum period\ndifference in reaction time between pregnant and non-pregnant women in a snakes in the\ngrass pop-out task, and further found that pregnant women were more accurate than non-\npregnant women at detecting threatening stimuli (spiders) amongst nonthreatening stimuli\n(flowers and butterflies). Future research could further investigate processing speed during\npregnancy and the postpartum period, determine whether there is a relationship between the\nobserved deficit in processing speed and self-reports of cognitive impairment during\npregnancy, and investigate the possibility that there are protective mechanisms facilitating\nthe speed of threat-detection during pregnancy despite the general pregnancy-induced\nimpairment in processing speed. This limited evidence also suggests that pregnancy may\nresult in enhanced processing of threatening social stimuli as well as non-social threatening\nstimuli.\nIn order to describe maternal cognition, researchers should explore the positive\naspects of cognitive functioning as they result from reproductive experience, not just the\nnegative aspects. Future research could examine more precisely when cognitive\nreorganization occurs, describe the cognitive profiles in pregnancy and the postpartum\nperiod, investigate whether cognitive advantages directly linked to infant care occur in\nwomen, and explore whether cognitive reorganization resulting from reproductive\nexperience lasts in perpetuity, as has been found in non-human animals. In fact, given that\nhumans are unique in the close contact they share with their offspring, as well as their\noffspring's offspring, we may expect that future research will show that cognitive\nreorganization and its associated advantages in women are more pervasive and dramatic\nthan those observed in rats.\nReferences\nAnderson, M.
