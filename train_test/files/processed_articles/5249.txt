Ending romantic relationships is\nBreaking up\nneither a contemporary nor a culture-specific problem. Evidence from traditional societies\nsupports the view that breakups were a recurrent feature of our human evolutionary past. Among\nthe !Kung San hunter-gatherers of Botswana, romantic relationships may be terminated by either\nparty whenever desired. The average !Kung tribe member experiences multiple romantic\nrelationships before settling down with a long-term mate (Howell, 1976). Among the Ache of\nParaguay, the average adult of 40 has experienced 12 marriages and 11 breakups (Hill and\nHurtado, 1996). Although the Ache are unusual in their high frequency of breakups, an empirical\nanalysis of the ethnographic record indicates that some level of divorce occurs in all cultures\n(Betzig, 1989). In short, based on the available evidence, it is reasonable to assume that romantic\nbreakups have posed recurrent adaptive problems for many individuals over evolutionary history.\nMuch social psychology research has focused on romantic relationship termination from a\nproximate perspective; the current research uses the lens of an evolutionary perspective.\nThe current research examined individual differences in rejection status, with a special\nfocus on the emotions and costs experienced and the coping strategies enlisted. Evolved\npsychological mechanisms are hypothesized to influence the ways in which people interpret\nbreakups, the emotions they experience following a breakup, and the aspects of the breakup\nperceived to be most costly. Selection also may have shaped specific strategies to deal with costs\nexperienced contingent on two key circumstances--sex (male, female) and rejection status\n(Rejector, Rejectee). Below we outline our rationale for 14 predictions regarding conditional\nstrategies based on sex and rejection status.\nSex Differences in the Breakup Experience\nWhen examining the costs experienced after a romantic relationship termination,\nresearchers have focused mostly on the divorces of married couples, examining proximate\nfactors such as division of shared resources and effects of divorce on dependent children (Amato,\nstudies have documented sex differences in the costs experienced after breakup. Women\ntypically report experiencing more benefits after the breakup and men report poorer adjustment\nBloom, 1980). This pattern is not universal, however; other studies find that men and women\nexperience breakups quite similarly (McCarthy, Lambert, and Brack, 1997; Metts, Cupach, and\nBejlovec, 1989; Sprecher et al., 1998). Our study attempts to clarify these findings by examining\na larger array of potential costs derived from evolutionary-psychological predictions.\nAlthough both men and women engage in long-term committed mating, the sexes differ\nin key aspects of their reproductive biology and mating psychology (Buss, 2003; Buss and\n1979). Women bear the larger minimum parental investment--nine months of gestation as well as\nthe metabolic costs of lactation--and therefore are more selective in their mate choice (Trivers,\n1972). When men pursue short-term mating, they are usually less selective, but when they pursue\na heavy investment strategy of long-term mating, they too become highly selective (Buss and\nSchmitt, 1993). Heavy investment in only one relationship can lead to large costs if the\nrelationship is terminated. If humans have faced recurrent costs associated with breakup, it\nfollows that selection would favor adaptations that reduce, avoid, or cope with these costs. In\ndomains in which women and men have experienced recurrent differences in the nature,\nfrequency, or intensity of these costs, an evolutionary perspective suggests that selection would\nfavor sex-differentiated strategies in these domains (Buss, 1995).\nBreaking up\nWomen, more than men, prefer mates with resource-acquisition potential (Buss, 1989). A\nman's resources, however, are only desirable to the extent that he is willing to share them. One\nway in which women gauge a man's willingness to invest is by his level of emotional\ncommitment to her (Buss, 2003). Emotional commitments include expressions of love, sacrifices\nof time, allocation of resources, and public declarations of commitment, which are usually costly\nand hence honest signals. We predicted that (1) female Rejectees, compared to male Rejectees,\nwould experience higher costs associated with losing the emotional investment of their ex-\npartner.\nWomen also tend to prefer mates who are physically fit, tall, and moderately muscular\nbecause these qualities afforded sufficient protection for the woman and her children (Buss and\nSchmitt, 1993; Frederick and Haselton, 2007).We predicted that (2) female Rejectees, compared\nto male Rejectees, would report higher costs associated with losing the protection of their mate.\nMen can also turn their physical formidability against their mates as a tactic of mate-guarding, a\ntactic which women almost never enact (Buss and Shackelford, 1997; Daly and Wilson, 1988;\nShackelford, Goetz, Buss, Euler, and Hoier, 2005). For the woman, the costs of enduring\nviolence or intimidation can be very high. If a man can force her to remain in a relationship even\nthough he is an undesirable mate, he has bypassed her ability to choose--one of the cardinal\ncomponents of women's mating strategies. A man may threaten to inflict such costs in order to\nmake his partner unwilling or unable to procure extra-pair copulations to cuckold him. If the\nrelationship has already dissolved, threatened costs can deter his rivals from attempts to mate\nwith her, keeping the window open for making up and restarting the relationship.\nIntrusive contact after the breakup appears to be enacted at equal rates by men and\nwomen. Women victims, however, experience more fear than men victims (Duntley and Buss,\n2002). Men are more likely than women to report engaging in direct unwanted pursuit behaviors\nsuch as showing up at their ex-partner's home, whereas women are more likely to report\nengaging in less direct unwanted pursuit behaviors such as leaving phone messages (Haugaard\nand Seri, 2003; Langhinrichsen-Rohling, Palarea, Cohen, and Rohling, 2000). Because the\naverage man is more capable of causing physical harm than the average woman, we predicted\nthat (3) female Rejectors would rate stalking and persistent attempts to restart the relationship by\ntheir ex-partners as more costly than male Rejectors.\nMen may also attempt to maintain sexual access to a woman and avoid breakup using a\nstrategy that exploits her evolved preference for long-term mating. Because women value\nemotional commitment so highly in their mates, men may deploy a counter-strategy to exploit\nthis desire: he may attempt to maintain sexual access to a woman by signaling an increase in his\nemotional investment to her. In the modern world, men can accomplish this by suggesting they\nbecome exclusive to one another, cohabit, obtain a mutual pet, get married, or have children.\nThus, we predicted that (4) men would be more likely than women to report success in\npreventing a breakup through suggestions of increasing their level of commitment to their\npartner.\nEven before the breakup, a Rejector may begin enacting preemptive strategies. Infidelity,\nfor example, can be a tactic to obtain additional resources or sexual access outside the\nrelationship, or alternatively as a tactic for ending the relationship itself. Infidelity can also serve\nto prepare the Rejector to quickly find a replacement mate following an anticipated breakup.\nCombined with men's evolved desire for sexual variety (Buss and Schmitt, 1993; Symons,\n1979), this leads to the prediction that (5) male Rejectors would be more likely to engage in\nsexual activities with new potential mates before the breakup than female Rejectors. The sex\nBreaking up\ndifference in desire for sexual variety may also affect behavior after the breakup. If the Rejector\ntruly wants to end the relationship, but still finds the Rejectee sexually desirable, the Rejector\nmay attempt to obtain additional sexual access even after the breakup. Following this logic, we\npredicted that (6) female Rejectees would be more likely to report that their partner asked for\nsexual access to them after the breakup.\nBreakup Experiences by the Rejectee and the Rejector\nRejectees often experience a desire to maintain the relationship, whereas the Rejectors\nmay be able to afford to reject their partner on the assumption that they can obtain a better mate\n(or alternatively are better off without the existing mate). The difference in rejection status may\nbe perceived both by both parties as well as their peer network, which can influence social\nreputation and alter perceived mate value. It is reasonable to hypothesize that Rejectors will be\nperceived, all else equal, as higher in mate value than the Rejectee. Exceptions, of course, exist\nsuch that sometimes the Rejector leaves the Rejectee because the Rejectee has already begun a\nrelationship with someone else. Selection would have favored individuals who best cope with\ntheir rejection status either by obtaining new mates or by monitoring and protecting their mate\nvalue after the breakup. Of course, breakups can sometimes be mutual, but the current research\nfocuses on differences as a function of rejection status.\nLow mood has been hypothesized to be a response to adaptive problems that require\nrumination and future trajectory recalibration (Nesse, 2000). Based on this hypothesis, low mood\nmight function to help the Rejectee to recalibrate mate value following the breakup. Low mood\nis not a homogenous experience since the behavioral aspects that compose low mood differ\ndepending on the cause of the low mood (Keller and Nesse, 2005). Loss of a romantic partner\nspecifically tends to be associated with outward expressions of grief such as crying, as well as\ninternal emotions that serve to prevent future occurrences of the aversive event. Crying may act\nas a signal to others that elicits sympathy and help, and can serve to strengthen alliances between\nthe distressed person and those who provide comfort. Sadness also can prompt the individual to\navoid similar situations in the future by bringing the features of the failure into the forefront for\nencoding and analysis (Keller and Nesse, 2005).\nBased on peer inferences of lower mate value, combined with the theory of low mood as\nan adaptive response, we predicted that (7) Rejectees would report experiencing depression more\nthan Rejectors; (8) Rejectees would report more rumination over the breakup than Rejectors; (9)\nRejectees would report experiencing more of a decrease in self-esteem than Rejectors; (10)\nRejectees would report being perceived as less desirable than their ex-partner more than\nRejectors; (11) Rejectees would report more worry than Rejectors that they will be unable to find\na new mate. Predictions 7 and 8 have received some empirical support in previous studies\nto our knowledge.\nRejectors too face specific costs based on their role in the breakup. Because Rejectors are\nresponsible for ending the relationship, they may experience negative feedback from their peer\nnetwork if they are perceived as cruel. Rejectors may be characterized as the villains and\nRejectees as the victims. Suffering reputational damage such as appearing heartless or\nunsympathetic can diminish one's ability to obtain future long-term mates, and also may incite\nretribution on the part of the Rejectee. These potential costs might motivate Rejectors to behave\nsympathetically or altruistically to their previous partner as a strategy to avoid incurring such\nBreaking up\ncosts. Therefore, we predicted that (12) Rejectors would report a higher cost associated with\nbeing perceived as cruel by their peers than Rejectees.\nJust as post-breakup strategies differ between the sexes, they may also differ by rejection\nstatus. To the extent that Rejectors and Rejectees have recurrently faced different adaptive\nproblems after the end of a relationship, selection may have fashioned specific strategies for each\ncontext. If the Rejector is the initiator the breakup, the Rejectee should typically be regarded as\nlower in mate value. It follows that the Rejector may have some leverage over the Rejectee and\nthis imbalance in power may lead to submissive expressions by the Rejectee in an attempt to\nretain or regain the Rejector. We predicted that (13) Rejectees, on average, would report\ndisplaying submissive gestures like crying, pleading and threatening to commit suicide more\nthan Rejectors.\nRejectors may have strategies for preventing or diminishing these costs. Rejectors might\nuse a positive tone during the breakup and attempt to minimize costs inflicted on the Rejectee\nthroughout the breakup process (Banks, Altendorf, Greene and Cody, 1987; Metts et al., 1989).\nAnother strategy would be to express sympathy and concern for the Rejectee in order to signal\ngoodwill and a continued alliance (Banks, et al., 1987). Thus, we predicted that (14) Rejectors\nwould report trying to boost their ex-partner's self-esteem more often than Rejectees. This\nstrategy not only exhibits the Rejector's kindness, it also specifically addresses one of the\nRejectee's main problems after the breakup: decreased mate value instantiated as lowered self-\nesteem.\nEmotional aftermath of breakup\nBreakups often cause mental anguish and sometimes even psychological disorders (Hill,\nRubin, and Peplau, 1976; Monroe, Rohnde, Seeley, and Lewinsohn, 1999; Sprecher, Felmlee,\nMetts, Fehr, and Vanni, 1998; Tashiro and Frazier, 2003). Although breakups are painful,\nindividuals differ in their experience of the psychological aftermath. An exploratory portion of\nour study examined these individual differences by comparing the emotions experienced by the\ntwo sexes as well as by the Rejectors and Rejectees. Previous research using various inventories\nof emotions suggests that women experience more positive valence emotions and less initial\ndistress following a breakup than men (Choo, Levine, and Hatfield, 1996; Hill et al., 1976;\nSprecher, 1994; Sprecher et al., 1998). Other studies find that women experience more\ndepression after a breakup than men (Mearns, 1991). Rejectors and Rejectees have reported\nexperiencing the same levels of distress following a breakup (Tashiro and Frazier, 2003), but Hill\nand colleagues (1976) documented that Rejectors felt less depressed and lonely and more happy,\nfree and guilty compared to Rejectees. The current study extends this research by providing an\ninventory of emotions varying from positive to negative and from low intensity to high intensity\nto explore sex differences and differences based on rejection status in a non-marital sample.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nParticipants were 98 males and 101 females who had experienced at least one romantic\nbreakup. We recruited 113 participants through the university participant pool to fulfill a course\nrequirement, and 86 participants from other psychology courses who received extra credit in\ntheir course if they chose to participate. All participants were students at a large university in the\nsouthern United States. The mean age of all participants was 20.58 years (SD = 2.32). The\nBreaking up\nsample consisted of primarily heterosexual participants (n = 193); those participants who\nindicated a bisexual (n = 3) or homosexual (n = 3) orientation were excluded from the analyses\nthat follow. Our remaining sample consisted of 69% White non-Hispanic, 15% Hispanic, 5%\nEast Asian, 5% African-American, 2% East Indian participants and 4% chose \"Other ethnicity.\"\nMost participants indicated that their families were middle class (85%).\nAll participants had been involved in a breakup: 80% had experienced a breakup as a\nRejector and 71% as a Rejectee at some point in their lives. Participants had been involved in an\naverage of three romantic relationships that lasted at least one month in duration with their\nlongest relationship lasting on average 21 months. Of the female participants, 55% indicated that\nthey had initiated this most recent breakup (Rejectors), and 45% indicated that their partner had\ninitiated the breakup (Rejectees). Of the male participants, 58% were Rejectors in their most\nrecent breakup whereas 42% were Rejectees. Overall, 56% of the sample indicated that they had\nbeen the Rejector in their latest breakup while 44% indicated they had been the Rejectee.\nMaterials\nWe designed a new instrument specifically for this study to explore the various aspects of\nromantic relationship termination. Following general questions regarding participant experience\nwith breakup in general, the instrument included questions about a specific breakup the\nparticipant had experienced, the emotions experienced immediately following that breakup, the\ncosts associated with that breakup, as well as any strategies used after the breakup. The\ninstrument required participants to respond regarding their most recent breakup. Each item asked\nthe participant to rate, on a Likert scale ranging from one to seven, the degree to which he or she\nhad experienced a given cost, or engaged in a given strategy, after the breakup. When a\nparticipant indicated that he or she had not experienced a cost or engaged in a strategy, this was\nrecorded as zero on the scale. Three additional questions presented dichotomous choices as to\nwhether the participant engaged in a behavior or not, in order to test specific predictions. These\nincluded \"Has an ex-partner ever asked you for \"one last sexual experience after a breakup?\",\n\"Has an ex-partner ever asked you to continue having sexual relations with him/her after the\nbreakup (become friends with benefits)?\" and \"Have you ever tried increasing your level of\ncommitment when a partner tried to breakup with you?\" The last item included a list of examples\nof ways they may have increased their commitment: ask your partner to move in with you, ask\nyour partner to marry you, tell your partner that you want to have children.\nTo create the instrument, a short nomination procedure was used to identify the costs\nassociated with the end of a romantic relationship. These nominations were completed by a\nseparate sample of 48 males and 122 females who were randomly assigned to list costs\nassociated with being the Rejector in a breakup or costs associated with being the Rejectee in a\nbreakup. Their individual responses were organized by the researchers into groups characterized\nby a single identified problem. These costs were included in the actual instrument created for this\nstudy, in addition to the costs we originally planned to include based on specific predictions to be\ntested. In order to populate the list of strategies, we created our own list based on the costs\nprovided and the behaviors that one could engage in to alleviate those costs. We also included\nseveral behaviors and activities for which we had specific predictions. In order to verify we had\nincluded the most important costs and strategies we asked participants at the end of the study\nwhether they had thought of any other costs or behaviors we had not mentioned and no\nparticipant named any that were not already included in our instrument.\nBreaking up\nProcedure\nParticipants either responded to our survey online or in person. Those who participated\nonline were given an internet address to access the instrument on their own time. Those who\nparticipated in our lab were greeted by a researcher and led into an individual office with a\ncomputer and consent form. After obtaining consent, the participant was left alone to complete\nthe survey on the computer. At the end of the instrument, participants viewed an online\ndebriefing form.\nResults\nFor all direct tests of a priori predictions we used a two-tailed  level of .05. Due to the\nresponse ranges of the questions in the survey, with zero representing participants who did not\nexperience the item, nearly all of the variables' distributions were skewed. For this reason, we\nanalyzed all comparisons between means using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney rank sum test.\nFrequency variables were analyzed using the Chi Square statistic. For the exploratory analyses,\nwe present measures of central tendency and variability to illustrate the differences between\ngroups although we did not make a priori predictions for every item. Due to the exploratory\nnature of these variables and the large number of statistical tests (12 emotions, 19 costs and 20\nstrategies), we used a more conservative non-directional  level of .01 for these analyses. We\ncreated composite variables for three pairs of items in order to reduce the number of statistical\nanalyses and because they represent theoretically similar constructs: verbal abuse and physical\nabuse were averaged into the abuse variable, persistent courting and stalking were averaged into\nthe stalking variable, and loss of ex-partner's money and loss of ex-partner's possessions were\naveraged into the loss of ex-partner's resources variable.\nTests of the 14 evolution-based predictions\nOf our 14 predictions, 10 received statistically significant support from the data (Table\nRejectees on the average costliness of losing their ex-partner's emotional investment approached,\nbut did not reach, conventional statistical significance (p < 0.08). The data supported Prediction\n2: female Rejectees (M = 0.90, SD = 1.58) rated losing the protection of their ex-partner as more\ncostly than male Rejectees (M = 0.21, SD = 0.86). We used the composite variable of stalking to\ntest Prediction 3: the mean of participants' ratings of ex-partner's stalking behavior and ex-\npartner's persistent attempts to restart the relationship. The variables were combined because\npersistent unwanted courting is actually stalking but participants may be more likely to label\ntheir behavior as persistence rather than stalking. Because these experiences occur at a low rate,\nwe also evaluated this prediction using the composite variables for only participants who\nreported at least one of the two items, 55 women and 51 men in our sample. The pattern of\nresults remained the same in both cases: female Rejectors (M = 2.18, SD = 1.95) rated persistent\nattempts by their ex-partner to restart the relationship as more costly than male Rejectors (M =\nPrediction 4 received support, with more males than females reporting success in\npreventing a breakup by increasing their level of commitment. Prediction 5 was supported: male\nRejectors (M = 1.83, SD = 1.69) reported engaging in sex with other potential mates before the\nbreakup more than female Rejectors (M = 1.13, SD = 0.49). Prediction 6 was not supported:\nfemale Rejectees were no more likely to report that their partner had asked for one or more\nBreaking up\nsexual experiences after the breakup than male Rejectees. This was evaluated based on whether\ntheir partner asked for a single last sexual act, and whether their partner asked to remain sexually\nactive for an extended period of time.\nPrediction 7 was supported: Rejectees (M = 4.30, SD = 1.89) reported more depression\nafter the breakup than Rejectors (M = 3.59, SD = 2.05). Prediction 8 was also supported:\nRejectees (M = 4.59, SD = 2.13) reported more rumination over the breakup than Rejectors (M =\ndecreased self-esteem after the breakup more than Rejectors (M = 2.23, SD = 1.92). Predictions\n0.69) did not significantly differ in their perception of themselves as being less desirable than\ntheir ex-partner, nor in their fear of being unable to find a new mate (Rejectors M = 3.41, SD =\nsignificance (p < 0.09). Prediction 12 received support from the data: Rejectors (M = 1.03, SD =\n1.63) indicated a higher cost of being seen as cruel compared to Rejectees (M = 0.27, SD = 0.89).\nBoth parts of Prediction 13 were supported by the data. Rejectees (M = 2.14, SD = 1.74) reported\nmore crying or pleading with their ex-partners than Rejectors (M = 1.03, SD = 1.71), as well as\nmore suicide threats. Prediction 14 was also supported by the data: Rejectors (M = 2.73, SD =\n2.06) reported more attempts to boost their ex-partners' self-esteem after the breakup than\nEmotions experienced after romantic relationship termination\nAn exploratory feature of our study assessed the emotions experienced after the breakup\nfor comparison between the sexes within Rejectors and Rejectees, and between Rejectors and\nRejectees themselves (Table 2). Similar proportions of Rejectors and Rejectees reported feeling\nvengeful, indifferent, scared, remorseful and regretful after the breakup. Those who were\nrejected, however, reported feeling substantially more sad, angry, confused, shocked and jealous\nafter the breakup than those who did the rejecting. Rejectors reported a mix of more happiness\nand more guilt after the breakup than Rejectees. However, when further dividing the Rejector\nand Rejectee categories by sex, revealing trends emerged. Within Rejectees, the sexes reported\nequal frequencies of all the emotions listed. Women who were rejected, more than men who\nwere rejected, reported feeling sad, confused and scared. In contrast, the only emotions that male\nRejectors reported more than female Rejectors were happy and indifferent (although p < .05).\nCosts experienced after romantic relationship termination\nOur instrument assessed 19 different costs that could be associated with a romantic\nbreakup. Table 3 presents group means and statistical tests for each cost studied. Within\nRejectees, most of these costs were experienced similarly by men and women, such as loss of\nconcentration, loss of ex-partner's resources or skills, inability to acquire replacement mate and\nperceived less desirable than their ex-partner. The only statistically significant sex difference\nfound within Rejectees revealed higher costliness associated with loss of protection for women\nthan men, supporting Prediction 8 above. Among the Rejectors, men and women reported\nexperiencing some similar costs, such as loss of shared friends, loss of sexual access, loss of ex-\npartner's resources. Among Rejectors, however, women reported higher costliness associated\nwith stalking, supporting Prediction 9 above, and loss of protection, mirroring the effect among\nRejectees.\nBreaking up\nTable 1.

Male and female Rejectees reported engaging in\n19 of the 20 strategies at statistically similar rates, such as discussing the breakup, crying and\npleading with ex-partner, avoiding ex-partner, and threatening ex-partner. The only exception\nwas that female Rejectees reported engaging in more shopping than male Rejectees, perhaps\nbecause shopping can function as an appearance-enhancement strategy to improve their new\nvalue on the mating market. The Rejectors also reported many strategies at similar rates\nregardless of sex, including remain friends with ex-partner, boost ex-partner's self-esteem, drink\nheavily, use drugs, spend money to attract new partner, and show affection to someone else in\npublic. The same pattern emerged among the coping strategies as among the costs: more sex\ndifferences within the Rejectors than the Rejectees. Female Rejectors, more than male Rejectors,\nreported more rumination, discussing breakup with family and friends, crying and pleading with\nex-partner and shopping after the breakup.\nDiscussion\nThis study was designed to test evolution-based predictions and to explore the aftermath\nof romantic breakup assessing the costs experienced and the strategies used to cope with\nbreakup. We also sought to uncover the ways in which individual differences in sex and romantic\nrejection status influence the costs experienced and coping strategies deployed. We found\nimportant differences in the breakup experience between Rejectors and Rejectees. Within these\ngroups, we found that that sex differences were more prevalent within Rejectors than within\nRejectees in the emotions and costs experienced and the strategies deployed, although it should\nbe noted that the lower number of Rejectees (n = 75) than Rejectors (n = 97) may partially\naccount for this difference. Our predictions followed from novel hypotheses based on mid-level\nevolutionary theories, as well as predictions or results that have been documented by researchers\nusing the standard social science model (e.g., Banks, et al., 1987; Choo et al., 1996; Sprecher et\nal., 1998). The evolutionary perspective leads to novel predictions not previously proposed or\nWomen tended to report severe reactions to breakup in general as measured by the\nemotions reported, costliness experienced, and strategies used. That women tended to report\nmore negative emotions following breakup was surprising, given previous studies which\ndocument that adult men usually react and feel more negatively following breakup than women\n1998) and that women tend to report more personal growth after breakup (Bevvino and Sharkin,\nregarding emotions, costs and strategies instead suggest that this effect may be age-dependent.\nPerhaps men in our sample had less to lose, or more to gain, from the end of their relationships\nthan women. Non-college samples, lacking access to large pools of potential mates, may\nconfront a different set of adaptive problems. Male college undergraduates, having potential\naccess to hundreds or thousands of attractive fertile women, may prefer to engage in a short-term\nmating strategy as opportunities arise (Buss and Schmitt, 1993). Therefore, the loss of a\ncommitted relationship among undergraduate men may not be as costly in this historically\nunusual environment for men (ancestral small group living would have rendered the number of\npotential mates in the dozens rather than thousands). The loss of an ambitious, intelligent mate at\nthis age may be more costly for women than for men, however, because they are currently at or\nBreaking up\nnear their peak mate value and therefore the time at which they are most capable of obtaining the\nhighest quality long-term mate that they can. Men at this age, on the other hand, have more time\nand potential to increase their mate value in the future. Although future mate value is more\nvariable for males, it generally peaks at a later age than for females (Buss, 2003), and thus\nsettling down with a long-term mate at this point may preclude both sexual access to a variety of\nwomen as well as long-term access to a female of higher mate value if they had waited to\ncommit.\nOf our 14 predictions, 10 received support from the data. We expected sex differences\nwithin rejection status, reflecting sex differences in evolved mating strategies. Women tend to\nprefer long-term mating to short-term mating and they gauge the level of their partners'\ncommitment by the amount of time and emotional investment they receive. We therefore\npredicted that female Rejectees would experience more costs from losing their partner's\nemotional investment compared to male Rejectees but this difference only approached\nsignificance in the predicted direction (Prediction 1). Historically, another part of what a man\nbrings to a relationship has been physical protection of his partner and therefore we predicted\nthat women should value this protection and experience higher costs when it is lost (Prediction\n2). Female Rejectees, compared to male Rejectees, did report experiencing more severe costs\nassociated with the loss of their partner's protection following the breakup. These costs ranged\nfrom feelings of fear or insecurity to experiencing actual abuse when lacking a romantic partner\nfor protection. Just as a man may provide greater protection than a woman, he is also in a\nposition to inflict greater physical harm. As predicted, stalking and persistent unwanted courtship\nbehaviors were rated more costly by women than by men (Prediction 3). The fact that we did not\nfind a significant sex difference on the stalking variable may be attributable to the small\nproportion of participants who had actually experienced stalking and could truly rate its\ncostliness.\nAs predicted, displays of commitment as a method of mate retention in the face of a\nbreakup were more effective when used by men than women (Prediction 4). Based on Sexual\nStrategies Theory, we predicted that male Rejectors would be more likely to engage in one or\nmore sexual affairs before the breakup (Buss and Schmitt, 1993). As expected, male Rejectors\ndid report engaging in infidelity more than female Rejectors (Prediction 5). We also predicted\nthat more female Rejectees would report that their ex-partner attempted to secure one or more\nadditional sexual activities with them after the breakup (Prediction 6). We did not find the\npredicted sex difference. This could mean that no sex differences exist, or that the sex\ndifferences are less pronounced at this age or in this environment due to the numerous\nopportunities at a university for sexual access to other mates. Women may also engage in post-\nbreakup sexual activities in an attempt to maintain a sexual relationship that could be ratcheted\nback into a long-term mateship in the future.\nAs expected, Rejectees tended to exhibit behaviors and feelings that function to solve the\nproposed adaptive problems they face after a breakup. Rejectors typically feel confident that they\ncan find a better mate. Whether or not this is true, ending a relationship is a cue that the Rejectee\nis less desirable than the Rejector, or that the Rejector perceives such a discrepancy. In order to\nsolve this adaptive problem, Rejectees would need to first identify the important aspects of the\nproblems that caused the breakup, cease certain behaviors that may be within the set of\nproblems, and reevaluate their relative value as a romantic partner for future mating. From the\nfindings produced by this study, it appears this is precisely what Rejectees experience. Those\nwho are rejected report more depression (Prediction 7) and rumination about the breakup\nBreaking up\n(Prediction 8) which may allow them to identify why the relationship that failed (Horwitz and\nWakefield, 2007). Their self-esteem decreases (Prediction 9), which may represent a\nrecalibration of self-perceived mate value.\nAlthough Rejectees generally experience more severe costs, Rejectors too face costs.\nRejectors risk acquiring a reputation as mean or uncaring by members of the peer group who\nsympathize with the Rejectee. Negative traits such as cruelty and coldness are not valued in a\nmate (Buss, 1989) and therefore Rejectors should be especially sensitive to such rumors, which\nthis study confirmed (Prediction 12).\nStrategies used in the aftermath of breakups were also affected by a person's rejection\nstatus. We predicted that Rejectees would be more likely than Rejectors to report behaviors that\ncould induce a Rejector into remaining in the relationship. These behaviors could be low-cost\nsuch as crying or pleading with their ex-partner, or high-cost such as threatening to commit\nsuicide (Prediction 13). Both low-cost and high-cost behaviors were reported more by Rejectees\nthan Rejectors. When the stakes are high, as in losing a high quality partner, Rejectees engage in\ncostly and sometimes risky strategies in an attempt to retain their mate. Rejectors, on the other\nhand, also possess strategies that solve the adaptive problems they face after a breakup. Since the\nfindings show that they fear being seen as cruel, Rejectors should enact strategies to prevent\nacquiring this reputation. In order to accomplish this, Rejectors could show continued affiliation\nwith the Rejectee and attempt to provide support and empathy for the Rejectee. To this end, the\nmost successful way to assist the Rejectee is by helping to boost his or her self-esteem which\nwill be damaged by the rejection (Prediction 14). The findings support this prediction, showing\nthat Rejectors are more likely to attempt to boost their ex-partner's self-esteem than Rejectees.\nLimitations and Future Directions\nMost people have experienced romantic breakup as a Rejector, a Rejectee, or both. This\nstudy was limited in examining a fairly narrow age range: college students. This is not an\nunreasonable sample, given that this is an age range of often intense mating in which\nrelationships are formed and dissolved with non-trivial frequency (Battaglia et al., 1998).\nNonetheless, adaptive problems faced as a consequence of a breakup may vary as a function of\nage. Older individuals, for example, are more likely to experience adaptive problems involving\nshared children and shared resources. The existence of shared children would make breakups\nmore costly because of the potential loss of bi-parental investment. Future studies could focus on\nromantic relationship termination among an older sample. In such a sample other areas of costs\nand strategies could be pursued related to parental investment and resource allocation. Variables\nin our instrument related to loss of an ex-partner's skills, money, and possessions are likely even\nmore salient in an adult sample (Avellar and Smock, 2005).\nAnother limitation of this study is the use of self-report. Future research could employ\nother data sources, such as close friends or the romantic partners themselves, to establish\nconvergence with the results found in the current study. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that self-\nreport is the \"method of choice\" for assessing the participant's thoughts and emotions. It is also\narguably the most accurate data source for the type of information we obtained: specific personal\nmemories of post-breakup experiences.\nAlthough intuitions tell us that Rejectees may be viewed as lower in mate value than\nRejectors, research is needed on whether or how much this information influences mating\ndecisions made by others. Do people routinely base some part of their decision of whether to\nbecome romantically involved with someone on the number of times he or she has been the\nBreaking up\nRejector versus the Rejectee? How important is this information compared to other mating-\nrelevant information like attractiveness, intelligence and resource potential?\nConclusions\nThe importance of maintaining a committed romantic relationship has loomed large\nthroughout generations of human history due to the investment necessary to successfully raise\nhelpless human offspring (Fraley, Brumbaugh, and Marks, 2005). A long-term romantic\nrelationship represents the context that historically has allowed for successful reproduction and\nsustained investment in children, investment known to have direct effects on the survival and\nfuture success of the resulting children (Hill and Hurtado, 1996). Losing a romantic relationship\nundoubtedly inflicts substantial fitness costs on the individuals involved. Our research has\nexplored the nature of these costs and the specific strategies used to cope with them. In our\nsample, women experienced considerably more negative emotions after the breakup than men\u00ad\nthey reported being more sad, confused, and scared. Women also reported that the consequences\nof breakup were generally more costly. We speculated that this may be due to the differing future\nmate value trajectories of men and women (Symons, 1979).\nThe problems resulting from a breakup can range from minor to irreparable. After nearly\nevery breakup, partners would have experienced some loss of sexual access, emotional\ninvestment, resources, as well as lost alliances with the previous mate's family and social circle.\nThese problems are multiple and specific, and no single strategy can solve them all. Instead, we\nexpect specialized strategies for dealing with distinct adaptive problems.\nFive conclusions follow from the results of this study. First, men and women experience\na large array of specific costs from a breakup, ranging from depression to stalking. Second, men\nand women deploy diverse strategies that cope with specific costs. Third, the costs experienced\nand the coping strategies deployed hinge importantly on whether the individual does the\nrejecting or is the recipient of a rejection. Fourth, women and men differ predictably in some of\nthe key costs they experience and the coping strategies they deploy. Finally, the strategies\nemployed appear to be specific to the costs experienced. These findings add support to the\ngeneral hypothesis that breaking up poses critical adaptive problems, and that humans have\ndeveloped context-contingent strategies designed to solve those problems.\n"
