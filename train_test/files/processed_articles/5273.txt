Longitudinal\nEvidence From US Counties\nLarry L. Howard, PhD1\n Keywords\nnursing home care, Medicaid, federal state, intergovernmental relations\nArticle\nIntroduction\nDue to aging populations, societies around the world face the\nchallenge of providing assistance to people who are no lon-\nger able to care for themselves. Trends toward smaller fami-\nlies and greater labor market participation in the United\nStates have coincided with an increasing reliance on publicly\nfunded providers of long-term care, as opposed to informal\ncare provided by family members.1 Over the next few\ndecades, the number of elderly individuals aged 65 and over\nis expected to increase by 7 percentage points to approxi-\nmately 20% of the population.2 Although recent evidence\nsuggests that there have been increases in disability-free life\nexpectancy among the elderly,3,4 any growth in the size of the\npopulation utilizing nursing home care would place greater\npressure on governments and taxpayers to publicly fund\nMedicaid programs covering the services.5 In fact, even if\nthere are no changes in demand for nursing home care, the\ncosts are likely to continue to rise. For instance, the number\nof Medicaid recipients utilizing nursing home care remained\nspending for these services increased by more than 50% to\nUS$48.6 billion.6 The Medicaid program now accounts for\nover a third of total spending on long-term care services in\nthe United States. Part of the impact of an aging population\non nursing home care costs is directly related to the choices\nstate governments make in the design of Medicaid provider\nreimbursement policies.\nThis article investigates whether Medicaid price levels\naffect the accessibility of nursing home care. We measure\naccess to care using the total number of homes and beds\navailable in markets defined by county boundaries within\nstates. Typically, equilibrium market prices and quantities\nare simultaneously determined, which makes it difficult to\nidentify causal effects of prices on supply-side outcomes. By\ndefining markets at the county level, we are able to take\neralist structure of the administration of the Medicaid pro-\ngram to evaluate how nursing home care providers responded\nto plausibly exogenous changes in market prices determined\nat the state government level. Currently, nursing home care\nservices are a federally mandated component of Medicaid's\nlong-term care benefits, but each state is free to set reim-\nbursement prices at any level below the upper payment limits\nbased on Medicare policy.7 In previous years, this was not\n1California State University, Fullerton, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nLarry L. Howard, Department of Economics, California State University,\nEmail: larryhoward@fullerton.edu\nthe case as the prices offered by states for nursing home care\nwere subject to federal government scrutiny and oversight.\nThe Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1980 introduced a new\npolicy requiring states to pay nursing home care providers\nrates that were \"reasonable and adequate to meet the costs\nthat must be incurred by efficiently and economically oper-\nated facilities,\" and the policy was subsequently repealed\nwith the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. (The policy is also\nknown as the Boren amendment after former Democratic\nSenator David Boren, from Oklahoma, who sponsored it.)\nHowever, in the interim years, there were a series of lawsuits\nbrought by nursing home care providers challenging whether\na state's reimbursement met the minimum standard implied\nby federal law.8 The variation in court rulings is used to con-\nstruct a range of oversight treatments ranging from the great-\nest oversight for states that only lost lawsuits challenging\nMedicaid nursing home reimbursement prices to the least\noversight for states experiencing no lawsuits challenging\ntheir Medicaid nursing home reimbursement prices during\nthis time. While initial government oversight initiatives are\noften times in direct response to prevailing outcomes, the\nrepeal of this particular federal policy was applied equally\nacross all states at the same time and is therefore less likely\nto be endogenously related with access to nursing home care\nservices in counties.\nWe use a difference-in-differences (DD) empirical frame-\nwork to estimate the effects of government oversight on\nnursing home care access before and after the federal policy\nchange targeting Medicaid reimbursement prices. The results\nindicate a significant decline in both the number of nursing\nhomes and nursing home beds in states that only lost lawsuits\nchallenging their Medicaid nursing home reimbursement\npolicies. For these 9 states, the repeal led to an average\ndecrease of approximately 1 nursing home and 100 nursing\nhome beds at the county level. Tests of the parallel trend\nassumption underlying the DD empirical framework suggest\nthat the repeal of government oversight had a causal impact\non access to nursing home care. Additional results indicate\nthat there were not simultaneous changes in the fundamental\nstructure of health care markets of counties in this period.\nFurther evidence is presented that suggests that the observed\npatterns of nursing home exit decisions were attributable to\ndeclines in Medicaid reimbursement prices following the\nThe article proceeds as follows. The \"Background and\nRelated Literature\" section provides a brief background of\nthe history of the federal policy change examined here and\ndiscusses the related literature examining nursing home care\nsupply decisions. The \"Estimation Strategy and Data\" sec-\ntion discusses the estimation strategy and data used for the\nempirical analysis. The \"Results\" section presents the main\nresults and addresses the question of whether the estimates of\nthe effects of government oversight can be interpreted as\ncausal. Then, the next section presents evidence on the\nmechanism of the government oversight impact in this con-\ntext. The last section concludes.\nBackground and Related Literature\nAnnual federal and state government expenditures for the\nprovision of nursing home care services through the Medicaid\nprogram now exceed US$48 billion. Elderly recipients\naccount for nearly three-fourths of the total costs of nursing\nhome care, and nursing home care services comprise 15% of\nthe total Medicaid program spending.6 (Nursing home care\nservices are also commonly referred to as nursing facility\nservices. Elderly recipients are individuals aged 65 and older\nand are also commonly referred to as aged beneficiaries.\nNursing home care costs account for about 5% of the total\nnon-elderly recipient costs.) There has been remarkable\ngrowth in Medicaid spending on this particular type of health\ncare since the program's inception in 1966. Spending on\nnursing home care services increased 11-fold during the\n1970s and, over the next decade, it continued to increase and\nmore than doubled during this time. From 1990 through\n(for a summary of aggregate nursing home care expenditures\nby payment source, see Table 15 at http://www.cms.hhs.gov/\nNationalHealthExpendData/downloads/tables.pdf).\nIn response to the rapid growth of nursing home care costs\nin the 1970s, the federal government introduced a new\nMedicaid provider payment policy as a part of the Omnibus\nReconciliation Act of 1980. The change was intended to help\nreduce costs by relaxing federal government oversight and\ngiving states more discretion in setting Medicaid reimburse-\nment prices for nursing home care.9 In particular, the new\npolicy required that states pay nursing home care providers\nrates that were \"reasonable and adequate to meet the costs\nthat must be incurred by efficiently and economically oper-\nated facilities.\" However, a policy shift that was originally\nintended to reduce government oversight of Medicaid reim-\nbursement prices eventually led to increases in government\noversight for a number of states. Miller8 identifies 84 law-\nsuits in 34 states brought by nursing home care providers\nchallenging whether a state's reimbursement met the mini-\nmum standard implied by the federal policy between 1981\nand 2001. In each of the cases, a final decision was reached\nand a prevailing party was determined on the issues. Overall,\nstates prevailed in 46.4%, nursing homes prevailed in 38.1%,\nand mixed court rulings occurred in 15.5% of the lawsuits.\nWe consider the lawsuits in which nursing homes prevailed\nas an adverse outcome from a state's perspective because it\nimplies that Medicaid reimbursement prices for nursing\nhome care would need to increase to comply with federal\npolicy. The subsequent repeal of the policy with the Balanced\nBudget Act of 1997 suggests that Medicaid reimbursement\nprices for nursing home care would decline in the states that\nhad only lost lawsuits as the primary legal basis for the\nlawsuits challenging Medicaid nursing home care reimburse-\nment prices was eliminated.\nRelated Literature\nThere exists a large literature examining the determinants of\ndecisions of nursing home care providers in the United\nStates. It has been recognized that government reimburse-\nment policies for nursing home care directly influence the\nprofitability of the industry.10 In contrast to other common\ntypes of health care, providers of nursing home care are able\nto enter the market for relatively low costs. Start-up costs are\ngenerally lower for nursing home care because the facilities\ndo not need to invest in specialized equipment and are able to\nutilize low-skill labor to meet the health needs of patients.1\nAs a result of the rapid increase in nursing home care costs\nfor Medicaid recipients in the 1970s, \"certificate-of need\"\nregulation was implemented at the state level to restrict entry\ninto the industry. (The National Health Planning and\nResources Development Act of 1974 first required state\napproval. It was repealed in 1986, and all 5 states continue to\nimplement some form of regulation to limit.1) To enter or\nexpand, firms had to prove to state governments that a need\nfor additional supply of nursing home beds was evident in a\nlocal market.11,12 In contrast, there are no barriers preventing\nfirms from exiting the nursing home care industry. The\nmajority of nursing home care providers are owned and oper-\nated by for-profit firms.13 Nursing homes typically serve a\nmix of private paying and Medicaid patients, and the profits\nof nursing homes that serve a greater share of Medicaid\npatients would be more sensitive to changes in Medicaid\nreimbursement rates. If nursing homes are limited in the\nextent to which they can substitute private paying patients\nfor Medicaid patients, then exiting may be a profit-\nmaximizing decision in the face of lower Medicaid reimburse-\nments. The present study is the first to empirically examine the\ndecision of nursing home care providers to exit the industry.\nEstimation Strategy and Data\nWe are interested in the relationship between Medicaid reim-\nbursement prices and access to nursing home care, which\nmight be approximated as\nQ P u\nist st ist ist\n= + + +\n  X \nHere, Q\nist\nis an outcome measuring the quantity of nursing\nhomes or nursing home beds available in county i in state s\nduring year t, P\nst\nis the Medicaid reimbursement price deter-\nmined by state governments, X\nist\nis a vector of county and\nstate characteristics, and u\nist\nis the error term. The parameter\nof interest is , which is the effect of Medicaid reimburse-\nment prices on overall access to nursing home care. Note that\nthe effect expressed in equation (1) is not at the county level,\nbut at the state level because decisions on Medicaid provider\nreimbursement prices are applied equally to providers in all\ncounties within a state. A key impediment to obtaining an\nunbiased estimate of  is that prices are not randomly\nassigned to states and are likely to be endogenously deter-\nmined with other unobserved state-level factors related with\naccess to nursing home care. For instance, states with higher\nreimbursement prices may have greater demand for health\ncare services, more generous Medicaid eligibility criteria, or\nhigher health care costs. To address the endogeneity prob-\nlem, we take advantage of the timing of a discrete change in\nfederal government policy concerning the oversight of\nMedicaid nursing home reimbursement prices. The variation\nin reimbursement prices induced by the federal policy shift is\nplausibly uncorrelated with unobserved state-level factors\nrelated with access to nursing home care.\nThe challenge in estimating the effect of government\noversight of Medicaid reimbursement prices on access to\nnursing home care is finding a control group that credibly\ntracks how counties would have developed in the absence of\noversight. In this case, every state Medicaid program was\nsubject to the policy introduced with the Omnibus\nReconciliation Act of 1980. (Arizona did not begin covering\nnursing home care services through Medicaid until 1988.) A\nkey ramification of the policy was a series of lawsuits\nbrought by nursing home care providers against states on the\ngrounds that reimbursement prices were inadequate. The\nvariation across states in lawsuit initiation and court rulings\nfor or against the plaintiff suggests a range of oversight treat-\nments. We categorically define treatment status based on\neach of the four possible outcomes for states during the\nperiod before the repeal of the policy with the Balanced\nBudget Act of 1997: states with no lawsuits, states that only\nwon lawsuits, states with mixed court rulings on lawsuits,\nand states that only lost lawsuits. The latter treatment cate-\ngory is arguably the case where government oversight had\nthe strongest impact on Medicaid reimbursement prices for\nnursing home care because the courts ruled that prices were\ninadequate under federal law. In our initial approach, we\nfocus on this case of government oversight, and use a DD\nmethodology to examine the effect of strong government\noversight on access to nursing home care. The first estimat-\ning equation is specified as\ny v\nist s t s t ist\n= + \u00d7\n( )+ + +\n   \nLost After Lost After , (2)\nwhere the dependent variable measures the number of nurs-\ning homes and nursing home beds in a county, and After\nt\nis a\ndichotomous variable that is set to 1 for the period after the\nrepeal of the policy. Lost\ns\nis a dichotomous variable that is\nset to 1 if the county is located in a state that only lost law-\nsuits challenging its Medicaid nursing home reimbursement\nprices.\nThe effect of strong government oversight is captured by\n in equation (2). The specification controls for changes over\ntime in average nursing home levels and average differences\nin nursing home levels of counties located within states that\nonly lost lawsuits and counties located within states that had\nno lawsuits, had only won lawsuits, or had mixed court rul-\nings. The key identifying assumption is that any relative\nchange in nursing home levels is due to the repeal of the\npolicy and, hence, the federal law underlying previous court\ndecisions. As changes in nursing home supply may also be\ncorrelated with other time-varying demographic and eco-\nnomic characteristics affecting demand for nursing home\ncare within counties and states, we further include a set of\nadditional controls to equation (2). At the county level, we\ninclude fixed effects to control for all unobserved and\nobserved time-invariant factors influencing the availability\nof and demand for nursing home care. Over time, changes in\nthe number of residents as well as their income and employ-\nment opportunities would be expected to affect demand for\nMedicaid and health care services. We include income per\ncapita, the annual unemployment rate, and the size of the\npopulation to control for shifts in demand for counties and\nthe states in which the counties are located. However, at the\nstate level, we are concerned with potential omitted variables\nrelated to Medicaid policy choices affecting eligibility crite-\nria and benefit levels, which are expected to influence\ndemand for health care services, particularly nursing home\ncare. Additional explanatory variables for the population\nstructure include the population aged 14 or younger per cap-\nita, the population aged 65 and over per capita, and the\nfemale population aged 15 to 44 per capita. These three seg-\nments of the population are primary targets of the Medicaid\nprogram. To control for changes in Medicaid recipients of\nnursing home care, we include the number of elderly\nSupplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients per capita, as\nwell as the number of blind-disabled SSI recipients per cap-\nita. SSI program eligibility implies eligibility for the\nMedicaid program. Finally, we include the federal medical\nassistance percentage (FMAP) to control for differences over\ntime in federal government financing incentives associated\nwith Medicaid matching grants to states. To the extent that\nstates'Medicaid reimbursement prices for nursing home care\nare determined by these factors, the additional controls will\nhelp to remove any resulting bias from omitted variables.\nOur second approach considers the possibility that the ref-\nerence group of states in equation (2), which includes states\nthat had no lawsuits, states that had only won lawsuits, and\nstates that had mixed court rulings, may lead to an over- or\nunderestimate of strong government oversight on access to\nnursing home care. For instance, every state could poten-\ntially lower Medicaid reimbursement prices for nursing\nhome care after the repeal of the policy because the legal\nbasis for lawsuits against states was eliminated. However,\nstates with previous lawsuits may respond differently to the\nrepeal as compared with states with no previous lawsuits\nchallenging their Medicaid reimbursement prices for nursing\nhome care. Modeling the entire range of government over-\nsight treatments would allow us to further investigate whether\nthe judiciary involvement in states that won lawsuits also\naffected access to nursing home care. The estimating equa-\ntion is specified as\nyist s t s\ns t s\n= + \u00d7\n( )+\n+ \u00d7\n( )+ +\n  \n  \nLost After Lost\nWon After Won Mi\nixed After\nMixed After\ns t\ns t ist\n\u00d7\n( )\n+ + +\n  v ,\nwhere the dependent variable measures the number of nurs-\ning homes and nursing home beds in a county, and After\nt\nis a\ndichotomous variable that is set to 1 for the period after the\nrepeal of the policy. Lost\ns\nis a dichotomous variable that is\nset to 1 if the county is located in a state that only lost law-\nsuits challenging its Medicaid nursing home reimbursement\nprices, Won\ns\nis a dichotomous variable that is set to 1 if the\ncounty is located in a state that only won lawsuits challeng-\ning its Medicaid nursing home reimbursement prices, and\nMixed\ns\nis a dichotomous variable that is set to 1 if the county\nis located in a state that experienced mixed court rulings on\nlawsuits challenging its Medicaid nursing home reimburse-\nment prices. The effects of government oversight are cap-\ntured by \n- \nin equation (3). The specification controls\nfor changes over time in average nursing home levels and\naverage differences in nursing home levels of counties\nlocated within states with judiciary involvement and coun-\nties located within states with no judiciary involvement.\nEquations (2) and (3) are estimated using ordinary least\nsquares (OLS), and standard errors are clustered at the state\nlevel to allow for an arbitrary pattern of serial correlation in\nthe residual error terms of counties.\nSemiparametric Censored Regression Model\nThe outcomes of interest in equations (2) and (3) are the\nnumber of nursing homes and nursing home beds in a county,\nand observations can have a limiting value of 0. Tobin14\ndeveloped a limited dependent variable (Tobit) model to\naccount for a concentration of observations at a limiting\nvalue, where the observed outcome is\ny y\nit it\n= ( )\n*\nand the unobserved latent variable yit\n*\nis expressed as\nyit it it\n* .\n= + +\n \nX \nGreene15 demonstrates that OLS estimates of  are biased\nand inconsistent, and that the bias is downward in magnitude\nif X\nit\nand \nit\nare normally distributed. Several estimators have\nbeen developed to consistently estimate parameters in Tobit\nmodels; however, very few are amenable to the inclusion of\nfixed effects. To evaluate the extent of the bias evident in OLS\nestimates of  in equations (2) and (3), we apply the trimmed\nleast squares estimator developed by Honor\u00e9.16 A key advan-\ntage of using this particular semiparametric estimator is that it\nis unnecessary to assume a specific structure for the serial cor-\nrelation of the residual error terms of US counties.\nData\nThe study utilizes county- and state-level data from a number\nof sources. A description of each source is provided here.\nOur main empirical analysis is based on a 2-period panel of\nArizona that are not included in the sample because Arizona\ndid not begin covering nursing home care services through\nMedicaid until 1988.) Sample means for the key variables\nare reported in Table 1.\nOutcomes measuring the number of nursing homes and\ncertified nursing home beds in counties are obtained from the\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Additional\ncounty and state controls include the annual unemployment\nrate from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, total personal\nincome from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, and total\npopulation from the US Census Bureau. The percentage of a\nstate's population that is female and between the ages of 15\nand 44, the percentage of a state's population aged 14 or\nyounger, and the percentage of a state's population aged 65\nor older are also reported by the US Census Bureau. Data\ncollected on SSI recipients from the US Social Security\nAdministration are used to construct per capita measures of\nelderly SSI and blind-disabled SSI recipients in each state.\nThe FMAPs for each state are obtained from the Green Book.\nAdditional county-level outcomes include the total number\nof active medical doctors and hospitals reported by the\nAmerican Medical Association and the American Hospital\nAssociation, respectively.\nAdditional state-level data are utilized to examine changes\nin state Medicaid spending on nursing home care services\nperiod. Data on Medicaid spending on nursing home care are\nobtained from CMS-64 Expense Reports that are collected\nby Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Data on\nMedicaid nursing home care recipients come from the Health\nCare Financing Administration (HCFA) 2082 reports for fis-\nrequired to submit Medicaid expenditure and recipient infor-\nmation via the Medicaid Statistical Information System\nSample means are reported in Table 2.\nTable 1.

The sample includes counties from all states except Arizona. SSI = Supplemental Security Income.\nResults\nMain Results\nTable 3 presents the OLS estimates of  in equation (2),\nwhich measures the DD in nursing homes and nursing home\n-0.49 is significant at the 5% level and indicates that coun-\nties located within states with the strongest government\noversight experienced a decline in the number of nursing\nhomes after the repeal of the federal policy with the Balanced\nBudget Act of 1997. In column 3, the point estimate of\n-41.74 suggests a corresponding decline in the number of\ncertified nursing home beds available in these counties. Note\nthat access to nursing home care declined at the state level as\nwell; if the decrease in nursing homes and nursing home\nbeds in certain counties was completely offset by increases\nin other counties within states, the DD estimate would equal\n0. To assess the omitted variable bias, columns 2 and 4 pres-\nent the estimates with an extensive set of controls included,\nand a downward bias is evident. The point estimate of \nincreases in magnitude to -1.01 for nursing homes and\n-77.04 for nursing home beds. The results indicate that the\nrepeal of the federal policy significantly reduced access to\nnursing home care for residents of states that only lost law-\nsuits related to the policy, relative to residents in all other\nstates.\nTo assess the extent to which judiciary involvement in\nstates that won lawsuits also affected access to nursing\nhome care, Table 4 presents the OLS estimates of \n- \nin\nequation (3). The key difference here is that the reference\ngroup is now counties located in states with no prior experi-\nence with lawsuits related to the federal policy. Columns 1\nand 3 show the DD estimates for nursing homes and nurs-\ning home beds without the controls for completeness, as we\nexpect bias related to omitted variables based on the previ-\nous results presented in Table 3. In column 2, the DD esti-\nmate of -0.94 is significant at the 5% level and indicates\nthat counties located within states with the strongest gov-\nernment oversight experienced a decline in the number of\nnursing homes after the federal policy repeal. In contrast,\nthe DD estimates of -0.07 for states that had only won law-\nsuits and 0.26 for states that had mixed court rulings are\nstatistically insignificant and much smaller in magnitude.\nFurthermore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis of joint\ninsignificance of \nand \n(P < .41). The results do not\nindicate any significant differences in nursing home avail-\nability for states that won lawsuits, relative to states with no\nlawsuits.\nAs a final step, we apply the trimmed least squares esti-\nmator developed by Honor\u00e916 to assess the sensitivity of our\nresults to censoring of the dependent variables at 0. Table 5\npresents the DD estimates of government oversight on nurs-\ning homes and nursing home beds based on equations (2) and\n(3), with and without control variables included. We focus\nthe discussion on columns 4 and 8 based on equation (3) with\ncontrols because of the estimation issues previously dis-\ncussed. In columns 4 and 8, the DD estimates of -1.10 for\nnursing homes and -116.22 for nursing home beds are sig-\nnificant at the 5% level and indicate that the censoring biased\nOLS estimates toward 0. The DD estimates for states that\nhad only won lawsuits are larger compared with those\nobtained with OLS, but remain statistically insignificant.\nThe DD estimate of 0.60 for nursing homes in states that had\nmixed court rulings is now larger compared with the OLS\nestimate and significant at the 5% level. It is not clear why\nthe repeal had a positive effect of nursing home availability\nin these states; however, the DD estimate of 23.52 for nurs-\ning home beds is statistically insignificant. This suggests that\nthe repeal of the federal policy may have prompted a restruc-\nturing of nursing home size, possibly to reduce costs in antic-\nipation of lower Medicaid reimbursement prices. However,\nthere was not a significant increase in the number of nursing\nhome beds available to residents as a result of the increase in\nnursing homes.\nTable 2.

Expenditures are adjusted by the consumer price index indexed in 2012\ndollars.\nTesting the Parallel Trend Assumption\nTo interpret the DD estimates presented here as causal, it is\ncrucial to establish whether nursing homes and nursing home\nbeds in counties were changing at the same overall rate\nbefore the repeal of the federal policy with the Balanced\nBudget Act of 1997.

For instance, nursing home residents fre-\nquently have health care needs that can only be provided by\nhospitals and doctors. Nursing homes may find that locating\nin counties with a greater number of hospitals and doctors\nincreases demand for available beds. We examine DD in\ndoctors, hospitals, and long-term hospitals to assess the\nextent to which there were possible contemporaneous\nchanges in health care markets that would confound our DD\nestimates of government oversight on access to nursing\nhome care. Table 7 presents the results based on equations\n(2) and (3) for doctors, hospitals, and long-term hospitals.\nWe do not find any evidence of significant changes in the\navailability of other types of health care providers for coun-\nties located in states with the strongest government oversight\nof Medicaid reimbursement prices for nursing home care.\nMechanism of Government Oversight\nImpact\nA key assumption underlying the findings presented here is\nthat the federal policy shift in 1997 removed a binding bar-\nrier preventing states from lowering nursing home reim-\nbursement rates. In general, nursing homes are likely to\nrespond to lower reimbursements by reducing the number of\nbeds allocated to Medicaid patients. However, if nursing\nhomes are unable to substitute private paying patients for\nless profitable Medicaid patients, then they may be forced to\nexit the market when faced with lower Medicaid\nreimbursements. Nyman11 demonstrates that reductions in\nthe supply of nursing home beds result in higher market\nprices. This suggests that we would expect to observe higher\nprices and fewer available beds if nursing homes exit the\nindustry due to low Medicaid reimbursements in the years\nfollowing the repeal.\nAlthough direct information on the reimbursement rates\nprevailing during this period is unavailable, we are able to\nexamine trends in average Medicaid spending on nursing\nhome care services per recipient. We estimate the following\nreduced-form model:\nyst s t s\ns t s\n= + \u00d7\n( )+\n+ \u00d7\n( )+ +\n  \n  \nLost Trend Lost\nWon Trend Won Mix\nxed Trend\nMixed Trend\ns t\ns t st\n\u00d7\n( )\n+ + +\n  v ,\nwhere the dependent variable measures Medicaid spending\nper recipient for nursing home care services in state s during\nyear t, and Trend\nt\nis a linear time trend. Spending per recipi-\nent depends on the Medicaid reimbursement prices offered to\nnursing home care providers and on the number of beds allo-\ncated to Medicaid patients. Prior to the repeal, we would\nexpect to observe below-average levels of Medicaid spend-\ning per recipient in states with the strongest government\noversight because courts had consistently ruled that the\nMedicaid reimbursement prices did not meet the minimum\nstandard implied by federal law. As a result of adverse court\nrulings, the trend in Medicaid spending per recipient should\nbe positive for states with the strongest government over-\nsight. In contrast, we would expect to observe the opposite in\nTable 6.

A key\nconsequence of nursing homes exiting the industry is higher\nprices and fewer beds available for Medicaid patients, both\nof which would work to increase Medicaid spending per\nrecipient. This would suggest that states with the strongest\ngovernment oversight would have relatively higher levels of\nMedicaid spending per recipient and a negative trend if states\ntake advantage of the reduction in government oversight fol-\nlowing the federal policy shift in 1997.\nTable 8 presents the results based on equation (6). Over\ngovernment oversight of Medicaid reimbursement prices for\nnursing home care had significantly lower levels of Medicaid\nspending per recipient for nursing home care services, rela-\ntive to states with no prior experience with lawsuits related to\nthe federal policy that was repealed in 1997. In contrast, the\nresults do not indicate any significant differences in nursing\nhome spending per recipient for states that won lawsuits or\nexperienced mixed court rulings, relative to states with no\nlawsuits. No significant trends in spending per recipient were\nevident during this time period; however, the estimated trend\nfor states with the strongest government is positive. Focusing\non the years immediately following the federal policy shift\nthat had only lost lawsuits or experienced mixed rulings had\nsignificantly higher levels of Medicaid spending per recipi-\nent for nursing home care services, relative to states with no\nprior experience with lawsuits. Furthermore, the trend in\nMedicaid spending per recipient for nursing home care ser-\nvices among states that experienced lawsuits was signifi-\ncantly lower compared with states with no prior experience\nwith lawsuits. The evidence suggests that in states with prior\nlawsuits challenging their Medicaid nursing home care\nreimbursement prices, Medicaid spending per recipient for\nnursing home care services grew at a significantly slower\nrate immediately following the policy repeal. This is consis-\ntent with lower provider reimbursements, which would cre-\nate disincentives for providers to operate in these states.\nConclusions\nThis study presents the first empirical analysis of the role of\ngovernment oversight in determining the accessibility of\nnursing home care in the United States. Changes during the\ntion of the Medicaid program created differences across\nstates in the extent to which the judiciary was involved in\nregulating provider payment policies for nursing home care.\nOverall, 9 states experienced lawsuits in which courts con-\nsistently ruled that Medicaid reimbursement prices did not\nmeet the minimum standard implied by federal law that was\noriginally introduced with the Omnibus Reconciliation Act\nof 1980 and then subsequently repealed with the Balanced\nBudget Act of 1997. (The 9 states that had only lost lawsuits\nwere California, Florida, Montana, Nebraska, Ohio,\nOklahoma, Texas, Vermont, and Wisconsin.) Using a DD\nempirical framework, we estimate that the repeal led to an\naverage decrease of approximately 1 nursing home and 100\nnursing home beds at the county level between 1994 and\n2000 for the states with the strongest government oversight.\nThe findings presented here suggest that government\noversight of Medicaid nursing home reimbursement prices\nbenefited both Medicaid and private paying nursing home\npatients. Nyman12,17 demonstrates that the quality of nursing\nhome care is lower in markets where there exists excess\nMedicaid demand for available beds. The decline in the\nTable 7.

Furthermore, Nyman11 examined the rela-\ntionship between market concentration and the price of nurs-\ning home care and found higher prices in markets with fewer\nnursing homes. A key implication of higher private nursing\nhome care costs is an increase in Medicaid recipients, as\npeople unable to care for themselves \"spend down\" to obtain\nMedicaid eligibility for nursing home care.\nThe policy issue of ensuring individual access to nursing\nhome care services is unlikely to become less important over\ntime. Recent federal government expansions in the scope of\neligibility for Medicaid through the Patient Protection and\nAffordable Care Act18 will eventually test whether additional\ngovernment oversight is necessary to guarantee the availabil-\nity of health care services covered by the program. The bud-\ngetary pressure generated by increases in Medicaid recipients\nwill create strong incentives for states to lower provider\nreimbursement prices to help control costs. Predicted changes\nin the age structure of the US population will further exacer-\nbate budgetary pressure arising from the Medicaid program,\nand force state governments to make difficult decisions\ninvolving tradeoffs between raising taxes and cutting other\npublic expenditures to cover the costs. Baicker19 demon-\nstrates that state governments respond to federally mandated\nMedicaid spending by reducing spending on other welfare\nprograms. The implication is that giving more authority to\nstates in the design of federal-state welfare programs such as\nMedicaid may work to shift the accessibility of health care\nservices from one low-income population to another. Our\nfindings suggest that government oversight of Medicaid\nreimbursements, involving both the legislative and judiciary\nbranches of government, is one policy lever that works to\nincrease overall access to nursing home care services.\nWhether judiciary mandates distort states'welfare budgets to\nthe same extent as legislative mandates remains an open\nquestion.\n"
