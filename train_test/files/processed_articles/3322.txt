Zumthor (2006) and Bo\nanalyses of atmosphere in terms of physical materials (i.e., spaces or locations among\nbuildings or objects). However, it is still unknown how individuals infer friendly/\nantagonistic communicative atmospheres and what particular elements are used in this\ninference. Our study aimed to deepen our understanding of atmosphere perception and\nreveal the mechanism of inference of friendly/antagonistic atmosphere using geometric\nshapes.\nPrevious studies have mainly focused on trajectory to examine the inference of causality,\nanimacy, and so on. In one of the earliest of such studies, Heider and Simmel (1944) revealed\nthat humans can interpret social relationships based on the trajectories of abstract geometric\nshapes. McAleer and Love (2013) extracted the trajectory from the actual movement\n(chasing, fighting, following, etc.) of two persons using computer vision and investigated\nindividuals' inferences from the extracted trajectories applied to two geometric shapes.\nKuhlmeier, Wynn, and Bloom (2004) studied the social perception of helping and\nhindering behavior using geometric shapes such as triangles, squares, and circles\nrepresenting eyes and a nose. Gao and Scholl (2011) examined the inference of chasing\nbehavior in terms of how one of two circles approached the other. Gao, McCarthy, and\nScholl (2010) and Scholl and Gao (2013) studied what they named the ``wolfpack effect,''\nwhich refers to how the trajectory and orientation of darts aiming continually toward a target\nwere interpreted as chasing behavior. However, trajectory was not considered relevant for the\nstudy of friendly/antagonistic atmosphere, as suggested by children expressing a friendly\natmosphere by having dolls tilt toward one another while remaining in the same positions.\nTherefore, the novelty of the current study lies in examining the expressions of shapes while\ntheir positions remain the same.\nFurthermore, this study focused on the observation of synchronous movement of\ngeometric shapes to infer a friendly/antagonistic atmosphere. Previous studies reported\nthat synchronization of body postures in a conversation raised affinity between\nparticipants and enhanced feelings of empathy and bonding towards each other (Bates,\nYoshikawa, 2007; Stel & Vonk, 2010). These past studies considered how individuals\nperceive friendliness in their experience, for instance, as participants in a conversation;\nhowever, no research has been conducted on how friendliness can be inferred from the\nobservation of synchronous movements or using geometric shapes. We hypothesized that\nsynchronous movement will influence individuals' inference of friendly/antagonistic\natmosphere and designed coincident and incoincident movements of the geometric shapes\nto investigate this influence.\nMethod\nDesign of Synchronization of Geometric Shapes\nIn this study, an egg shape was used as a typical geometric shape that can represent the\npresence of a person. We referred to a Matryoshka doll (Russian nesting doll) and a Daruma\n2 i-Perception\ndoll (Japanese traditional doll), which are very primitive, almost egg-shaped objects with no\nprotrusions that are identified with a person. We created animations of two egg shapes\narranged close together (left and right egg in Figure 1). We used synchronous sine\nfunctions, which are traditional methods to create synchronous reciprocal motion\n(Pikovsky, Rosenblum, & Kurths, 2003). We set sine function for both the left and right\neggs individually to develop the synchronous movement of the two egg shapes. The following\nequations (1) and (2) were defined to make such motions.\nyn\n\u00f0t\u00de \u00bcAsin\nT\nt\u00c0\u00c1n\n\u00f0 \u00de\u00c0\n\n \nn\u00f0t\u00de \u00bcMAXdnyn\nHere, n indicates the left or right egg (L or R). Using equations (1) and (2) for the left and\nright eggs, the eggs move individually but they are synchronized. The yn\nin equation (1) is the\ndisplacement and the n\nin equation (2) shows the angle of tilt for each time (t). The\namplitude (A), period (T), and nonzero center amplitude (') are constant values and equal\nfor the left and right eggs. The changing parameters (dn\nand \u00c1n\n) can create different types of\nmovement for the left and right eggs. Figure 1 explains the movements by changing\nparameters. The dn\nindicates direction: If the d value is positive, the egg rotates clockwise,\nand if the d value is negative, it rotates counterclockwise. We can create a perfect\nsynchronous movement of the two eggs (\u00c1L\n\u00bc \u00c1R\n) or use different phases for the left and\nright eggs (\u00c1L\n). In our study, we focused on three types of tilts by varying dL\nand dR\n.\nThe first one is a parallel tilt in which eggs sway from side to side together, such as in dancing\nor singing together; the second tilt involves leaning forward (i.e., towards each other), such as\nin greeting or talking to each other; and the third tilt involves leaning backward (i.e., away\nfrom each other), such as in fighting or disliking. Furthermore, we used delay (\u00c1n\n), wherein\none egg starts to move some time after the first egg starts moving, to create coincidence\nFigure 1. Equations (1) and (2) describe the angle of tilt (L\nand R\n) and the reciprocal motions.\n\u00bc \u00c1R\n) or incoincidence (\u00c1L\n) in the starting time of the movement of the eggs.\nTherefore, we prepared six animations combining these two factors;\nFactor A: tilt\nA1: Parallel: leaning in the same direction (dL\nA2: Forward: leaning forward towards each other (dL\nA3: Backward: leaning backward towards each other (dL\nFactor B: timing\nB1: Coincidence (\u00c1L\nB2: Incoincidence (\u00c1L\nIn the experiment, we used MAX\ndetermined these parameters by conducting preliminary experiments. We interviewed a few\nvolunteers to determine whether the movement of eggs was abnormal and meaningless while\nrepeatedly changing these parameters before we finally decided on them. Since the parameters\nin this experiment are tentative, it is possible that more suitable parameters exist. In the\nfuture, we should investigate them through additional experiments.\nResearch Hypotheses\nWe hypothesized that when the eggs lean forward, the communicative atmosphere will be\ninferred as friendlier than for the other tilt conditions. Price, Peterson, and Harmon-Jones\n(2011) and Harmon-Jones, Gable, and Price (2011) reported that leaning forward was\nassociated with a higher approach motivation during goal acquisition, such as leaning\ntowards an appetitive dessert or an interesting situation. Forward body tilts may express\nan individual's motivation and attitude to communicate with a partner, and this expression\nmight suggest a friendlier communicative atmosphere. On the other hand, leaning backward\nmay express a lack of interest or no motivation to communicate with others, and this\nexpression might be associated with a person who turns his or her eyes or face away when\nhe or she does not want to communicate (Argyle, 1988). Thus, backward body tilts might\nsuggest an antagonistic communicative atmosphere.\nRegarding timing, we hypothesized that in the case of forward and parallel tilts, a\ncoincident movement will suggest a friendlier relationship than an incoincident one.\nCoincident activities, such as synchronized swimming or cheerleading, require a friendly\nenough relationship to create a harmonious combination and perfectly matching\nmovements. We predict that the coincident patterns of parallel and forward tilts will\nsuggest such coincident activities and friendly relationships; thus, they will be interpreted\nas friendlier than will incoincident ones. On the other hand, we predict that an antagonistic\ncommunicative atmosphere will be inferred from a backward coincident tilt. This is because\nthe meaning of the backward tilt--namely, an aversion to and disinterest in others--might be\nenhanced by simultaneous movement, suggesting a stronger dislike for each other. A\nbackward incoincident tilt might suggest that only one of the two dislikes the other\nbecause of nonsimultaneousness; this might not be worse than the both of them disliking\neach other.\nBased on the earlier discussion, we formulated the following hypotheses:\nHypothesis 1 (influence of coincidence/incoincidence): There is a significant difference between\nthe atmospheres suggested by coincident and incoincident movements.\n4 i-Perception\n(1) Participants will rate the communicative atmosphere for coincident movement as\nfriendlier than for incoincident movement in the case of parallel and forward tilts.\n(2) Participants will rate the communicative atmosphere for coincident movement as more\nantagonistic than for incoincident movement in the case of backward tilt.\nHypothesis 2 (differences between parallel/forward/backward tilts): There is a significant\ndifference between the atmospheres suggested by parallel, forward, and backward tilts.\nParticipants will rate the communicative atmosphere of the forward tilt as friendlier than that\nof the backward and parallel tilts.\nParticipants and Experimental Procedure\nyears). We asked a research company to recruit participants and to conduct the experiment\nonline. The important issues (e.g., personal information protection) in the experiment were\nexplained to the participants and their consents were obtained before the experiment. The six\nanimations were shown in a random order using web pages; one animation was displayed on\neach web page. The animation was located in the upper part and the items (questions) were\nshown in the lower part of each web page. After the participant watched one animation, he or\nshe answered the questions. After finishing this, the next page was shown and the new\nanimation and questions were displayed. The participants could rate each condition only\nonce and could not return to the previous page. Each animation of reciprocal movements\nlasted for about 20 seconds. The size of the animation was 320 \u00c2 240 dots and it was sufficient\nto answer the questions. Participants were requested to rate each animation on a 5-point scale\nranging from 0 to 4 after watching it. We instructed the participants to see ``eggs'' as figures\nthat communicate each other. We gave the participants the following instructions:\n``Animations show a scene of two geometric figures communicating with each other.\nPlease rate the scene on a scale of 0\u00ad4.'' We used two items. Item 1 suggested ``I think\nthat these objects portray an antagonistic\u00adfriendly atmosphere'' (0 \u00bc antagonistic,\n1 \u00bc somewhat antagonistic, 2 \u00bc neither, 3 \u00bc somewhat friendly, 4 \u00bc friendly) and Item 2 read\n``I think that these objects' movements are mechanical\u00adbiological'' (0 \u00bc mechanical,\n1 \u00bc somewhat mechanical, 2 \u00bc neither, 3 \u00bc somewhat biological, 4 \u00bc biological). All the data\nwere collected on the web server. We conducted a two-way repeated-measure analysis of\nvariance (ANOVA) for each item (Factor A: tilt and Factor B: timing).\nResults\nFigures 2 and 3 show the average responses for the two items and results of the ANOVAs.\nRegarding friendliness, there was a significant interaction effect between tilt (A) and timing\ntiming factor. A simple main effect of timing on the friendliness rating was also observed for\neach of the levels of the tilt factor: coincidence (B1) > incoincidence (B2) for parallel tilt (A1),\nIn the multiple comparisons for Factor A using the LSD method, in the coincidence\ncondition (B1) of timing, parallel (A1) \u00bc forward (A2) > backward (A3) (mean square\nerror [MSE] \u00bc 0.75, p < .05) and there was no significant difference between parallel (A1)\nand forward (A2). In contrast, in the incoincidence condition (B2) of timing, there were\nsignificant differences as follows: parallel (A1) < forward (A2), parallel (A1) > backward\nRegarding the mechanical\u00adbiological rating, there was no significant interaction effect\nFigure 2. Two-way repeated-measure ANOVA and multiple comparisons using the LSD method for Item 1:\nfriendly\u00adantagonistic atmosphere (**p <.01, *p <.05). Error bars represent standard errors.\nFigure 3. Two-way repeated-measure ANOVA for Item 2: mechanical\u00adbiological. **p <.01. Error bars\nrepresent standard errors.\n6 i-Perception\nDiscussion\nThere were significant differences between coincident and incoincident movements. In the\ncase of forward and parallel tilts, coincident movement was rated as portraying a friendlier\natmosphere than that portrayed by incoincident movement. In the case of backward tilt,\ncoincident movement was rated as representing the least friendly atmosphere. Therefore,\nHypothesis 1 was accepted and it is assumed that coincidence is a key factor in the\ninference of a friendly/antagonistic atmosphere.\nA significant difference between parallel and forward tilt was found in the incoincidence\ncondition. However, there was no difference between the forward and parallel tilts for\ncoincidence movement. Therefore, Hypothesis 2 was partly rejected. Some participants\nreported that the forward and incoincident tilt reminded them of ``interaction,'' such as\nresponse or feedback, for example, when a person talks to another and then he or she\nreplies. It is believed that the forward incoincident tilt was suggestive of a relationship\nfriendly enough for responding or providing a feedback. On the contrary, the parallel\nincoincident tilt did not easily express interaction because this tilt never had a ``mutual''\norientation, as the shapes always had the same direction. Thus, the differences in terms of\nperceived interaction between the forward incoincident and the parallel incoincident tilts\nmight cause the significant difference in the friendliness rating.\nOn the other hand, it can be assumed that not interpreting either of the tilts as an\ninteraction might be the reason for the lack of a significant difference in the friendliness\nrating between the forward coincident and the parallel coincident tilts. Coincident\nmovement is readily associated with coincident controlled machines, such as a conveyor\nbelt in a factory or the windscreen wipers of a car. It is therefore unlikely for their\nmovement to be interpreted as interaction. The results of Item 2 provided partial evidence\nfor the idea that coincident patterns of movement might not be understood as an interaction\nand showed that such patterns were interpreted as significantly less biological than\nincoincident patterns. Coincident movement might have been seen as monotonic and\nmechanical, and this difficulty to interpret it as interaction might have led to the absence\nof a significant difference between the forward coincident and the parallel coincident tilts in\nterms of the friendliness rating.\nThe results showed that the trend in rating scores inclined towards the middle value\n(i.e., 2 \u00bc neither). This trend suggests that participants evaluated the stimuli ambiguously,\nleading to ineffective answers. To clarify this, we analyzed the deviation of rating scores in\neach condition from 2. We calculated these deviation values jxi\n\u00c02j in each condition\n(xi\nis the rating score of participant i) and subjected them to a two-way repeated-measure\nANOVA. There was a significant main effect of tilt for friendliness/antagonism,\ncorrected), which revealed significant differences between the tilts, as follows:\nparallel \u00bc backward < forward (MSE \u00bc 0.284, p < .05). We also found a main effect of\nF(1, 99) \u00bc 7.31, p < .01, which both revealed a pattern of incoincidence < coincidence.\nThus, we obtained significant results even when using the deviation scores from 2\n(neither), which confirm that participants had effective answers. Moreover, the results\nindicating strong influences of forward tilt and coincidence on friendliness/antagonism\nratings are not inconsistent with the earlier discussion that the coincidence and forward\ntilt caused the significant differences. Particularly, the fact that forward tilt did not appear\nto be ambiguous to participants supports the notion that forward tilt is perceived as\nfriendlier compared to backward and parallel tilts. For biological/mechanical ratings, the\nscores were significantly lower for incoincident movement than for coincident movement,\nsuggesting that the coincident patterns were interpreted of mechanical movement, as\nmentioned earlier.\nFurthermore, there is a possibility that a slight deviation such as in incoincident movement\nmay be interpreted as friendliness, according to studies by Meyer (1956) and Narmour (1990).\nThey reported that deviations from expectations increased emotional response to music\npossibility that a slight deviation in movement may convey a positive emotion such as\nfriendliness.\nTo summarize, our results suggest the possibility that individuals may infer a friendlier\natmosphere from coincident movement, and from the combination of incoincidence and\nforward tilt. The current study suggests that interpreting movements as interaction may be\na partly crucial factor to perceive an atmosphere between two objects as friendly. The finding\nwill be useful for designing atmospheres for humans and animated agents/robots, which are\nnovel design methods necessary for creating a better communicative atmosphere for\nanimated agents and robots (Yuasa, 2014).\nIn addition, we describe the relationship to studies of animacy. This study contributes to\nanimacy studies in elaborating how people discover causality and social responses of objects,\nand the findings of this study become new examples for future studies on animacy. The\ncurrent study investigated the expressions that can contribute to a sense of friendliness;\nthese expressions can create the special meaning (friendliness) that a single object could\nnever infer individually. Thus, this study is similar to the animacy studies that make sense\nby multiple objects, causality and social responses of multiple objects. In the earliest studies,\neffects (launching, triggering, etc.) using multiple objects. Spelke, Phillips, and Woodward\n(1995) also investigated the actions of animated objects and proposed principles to create\nhuman-like actions (i.e., social responsiveness). Although these studies are similar to the\npresent study, they still differ because this study created expressions of friendliness using\ntilt movements without trajectory information. Therefore, the cues of this study are beneficial\nin that they provide new examples of making sense of multiple objects without trajectories,\nwhich may lead to a further our understanding of how people infer causality or social\nresponses.\nThe cues to creating friendliness in this study can be generalized to communication\nbehaviors in conversations. Yuasa, Mukawa, Kimura, Tokunaga, and Terai (2010)\nstudy, which analyzed body postures of the speaker and the listener, proposed the\nbehaviors of animated agents that could comprehend positive or negative attitudes in\nconversations. The cues from this study can contribute to investigating the behaviors\nthat better communication or create a friendly atmosphere in conversations using tilts\nand coincidence/incoincidence. These cues can also be useful in analyzing how people\nunderstand slightly more complex social behaviors, which must be observed for a\ncertain amount of time, such as following, fighting, and chasing. McAleer and Love\n(2013) also investigated the comprehension of such behaviors. Since McAleer's study\nanalyzed only the positions of abstract objects and their changes over time, tilt\nbehaviors and coincidence/incoincidence will be useful as advanced factors to\ninvestigate such slightly complex social behaviors.\nMoreover, we explain the connections to existing theoretical studies. The ``theory of mind''\nin the field of developmental psychology may be considered a criterion for whether a child\ncan simulate another's mind (Baron-Cohen & Leslie, 1985; Premack, & Woodruff, 1978;\n8 i-Perception\nWimmer & Perner, 1983). It may also be necessary for understanding friendliness/\nantagonism, because it is difficult to infer social relationships like friendliness/antagonism\nwithout simulating others' minds. In the studies of children playing, Smilansky (1968) and\nSmilansky and Shefatya (1990) characterized the criteria for sociodramatic play, one of which\nwas ``interaction,'' which implies that at least two players interact in the context of a play\nscene. The comprehension of friendliness/antagonism may be needed for the ``interaction''\ncriterion in children's development.\nFurthermore, we might discuss the connection between the current study and\ncommunication theories (Burgoon, Stern, & Dillman, 1995; Griffin, 1997; Watzlawick,\nWeakland, & Fisch, 1974). One principle of the interpersonal adaptation theory (Burgoon\net al., 1995) is that people biologically and unintentionally behave to achieve ``synchronicity''\nwith each other. Coincidental movements that are equivalent to ``synchronicity'' were\nconsidered to be natural human behavior, which might lead to a high evaluation of\nfriendliness. Social interaction theory explains two types of feedback relationships:\nsymmetrical and complementary feedback (Griffin, 1997; Watzlawick et al., 1974).\nSymmetrical feedback is when one person responds to the other in the same way, while\ncomplementary feedback is when participants react in opposite ways. Symmetrical and\ncomplementary feedback might be equivalent to parallel and forward tilts. Humans tend\nto be sensitive to both forms of feedback, which might have resulted in the significant\ndifferences in friendliness and biological ratings in our results.\nLimitations\nThe aim to understand atmosphere perception was achieved using sine functions. However,\nwe must investigate other types of equations in the future; indeed, in our next study, we\ninclude other wave phenomena (i.e., beat, resonance, and frequency-locking phenomena).\nMoreover, in this study, we used the egg shape as a first step to examine communicative\natmosphere; however, different results might be obtained if other geometric shapes, like a\nsquare or a triangle, are used. Pavlova, Sokolov, and Sokolov (2005) used several types of\nshapes, such as triangles, ovals, and single lines, in a study on emotional attribution. Thus,\nother types of shapes need to be used to investigate differences in inferences according to\nshape. Finally, we did not add any facial features, such as a nose, a mouth, or eyes, to the\ngeometric shapes in our study and used only one level of abstraction for geometric shapes.\nKuhlmeier et al. (2004) used geometric shapes such as triangles, squares, and circles with eyes\nand a nose; Yuasa, Saito, and Mukawa (2009) used a changing level of character abstraction;\nKito (2004) investigated which particular nonverbal cue was important to infer an\ninterpersonal relationship such as familiarity from photos of individuals. Future studies\nshould try to use different abstraction levels, as well as real images and various kinds of\nfacial and bodily parts. On the other hand, when using less abstraction, the information from\nsuperficial elements increases and significant factors might become hidden. Thus, future\nresearch should consider which factors are appropriate and execute experiments\nsystematically.\nWe used only subjective self-rated questionnaires, and an objective evaluation should be\nused to show rigidity and rigorousness. However, since the current study is the first report to\nevaluate friendliness, which is expressed by abstract shapes, it is hard to develop an objective\nevaluation immediately. We think the subjective method is sufficient to evaluate friendliness\nas a first step and we will be able to find a suitable objective method for future studies (e.g.,\nmeasurement of reaction times or eye movements).\nConclusions\nIn order to investigate how people infer friendly communicative atmosphere from the\nmovements of geometric shapes, we developed animations using several types of tilts and\ndifferent delays in the movement of two egg shapes. The shapes' movement was designed\nbased on a sine function to create synchronous reciprocal motion and other types of motion\nby varying the values. The experimental results showed differences between coincident and\nincoincident movements in the inference of friendly/antagonistic atmosphere. Moreover, in\nthe case of incoincident movements, the atmosphere was rated as friendlier for forward tilts\nthan for parallel and backward ones. This study suggests that interpreting the movement as\nan interaction may be an important factor to infer friendliness; individuals may have the\ncapacity to infer a friendly communicative atmosphere from both coincident and incoincident\nmovements interpreted as interaction.\n"
