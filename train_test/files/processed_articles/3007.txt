Cogni-\ntive developmental scores for infants\nwho were fully breastfed for 6 months\nor more are increased in comparison\nwith those scores of infants who were\nnever breastfed.4\nThere is some suggestion that breast-\nfeeding is also protective against the de-\nvelopment of overweight in young chil-\ndren and adolescents.5,6 If breastfeeding\nis protective against overweight in early\nchildhood, the explanation may lie less\nin inherent obesity-preventing proper-\nties of breast milk than in the fact that\nbreastfeeding displaces potentially more\nenergy-dense formula-feeding. In ad-\ndition, the higher protein/nitrogen con-\ntent of infant formula compared with\nbreast milk may cause a metabolic re-\nsponse of increased insulin and insulin-\nlike growth factor-1 secretion in for-\nmula-fed infants leading to excessive\nweight gain, or there may be differ-\nences in the regulation of intake of for-\nmula-fed infants compared with breast-\nfed infants.\nAny protective mechanism of breast-\nfeeding is difficult to identify because\nmany of the same factors related to child\ngrowth and the development of over-\nweight, such as race/ethnicity, mater-\nnal education, maternal size, and birth\nweight, are also related to the initia-\ntion and duration of breastfeeding or\nthe decision to formula-feed.7-11 Our ob-\njective was to determine if breastfeed-\ning and its duration are associated with\na reduced risk of overweight in a na-\ntionally representative sample of young\nUS-born children.\nAuthor Affiliations: Division of Epidemiology, Statis-\ntics and Prevention Research, National Institute of Child\nHealth and Human Development, National Institutes\nof Health, Bethesda, Md (Dr Hediger and Ms Ruan);\nMaternal and Child Health Bureau, Health Resources\nand Services Administration, Rockville, Md (Dr Over-\npeck); and Division of Health Examination Statistics,\nthe National Center for Health Statistics/Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention, Hyattsville, Md (Dr\nKuczmarski).\nCorresponding Author and Reprints: Mary L.

There was\nclear dose-dependent effect of the duration of full breastfeeding on being at risk of\noverweight or overweight and no threshold effect. The strongest predictor of child\noverweight status was the mother's concurrent weight. The rate of children being over-\nweight nearly tripled with maternal overweight status (BMI, 25.0-29.9 kg/m2; AOR,\nConclusions There are inconsistent associations among breastfeeding, its dura-\ntion, and the risk of being overweight in young children. Breastfeeding continues to\nbe strongly recommended, but may not be as effective as moderating familial fac-\ntors, such as dietary habits and physical activity, in preventing children from becom-\ning overweight.\nMETHODS\nDesign and Sample\nInformation on infant feeding and child\noverweight status were taken from the\nNational Health and Nutrition Exami-\nnation Survey III (NHANES III), a\ncross-sectional survey conducted by\ntheNationalCenterforHealthStatistics/\nCenters for Disease Control and Pre-\nmultistage probability design, infants\nand children from ages 2 to 71 months\nat interview, blacks, and Mexican-\nAmericans were oversampled. These\nanalyses focus on young children, 3\nview, for whom retrospective informa-\ntion on infant feeding was obtained.\nwere measured for height and weight.\nBirth Certificates\nBirth certificates were sought for\nUS-born children ages 6 years or\nbirth certificates (94% of US-born chil-\ndren ages 3-5 years) were linked to the\nNHANES III file. Variables taken from\nthe birth certificates included sex, birth\nplurality (singleton or twin), birth or-\nder, birth weight (grams), and length\nof gestation (weeks). As in previous\ntational length from the mother's last\nmenstrual period was examined for\njects (8.2%) were found to have miss-\ning or invalid length of gestation. For\nthose with valid gestational ages, pre-\nterm delivery was defined as less than\nBirth-weight categories were de-\ngestational ages were categorized as\nsmall (10th percentile of birth weight\npercentile), and large for gestational age\n(90th percentile), using reference per-\ncentiles derived separately for non-\nHispanic white, non-Hispanic black,\nand Mexican-American singleton\ninfants.18 Infants of \"other\" races/\nethnicities were categorized using the\nreference for non-Hispanic whites.\nDemographic and Maternal\nCharacteristics\nRace/ethnicity and region of residence\nwere based on US Bureau of the Census\ncategories and definitions.12 The educa-\ntion of the family reference person in\nNHANES III was used to represent\nhousehold education level. The follow-\ning were taken from the questionnaire\nadministered to the child's parent or\notheradultcaretakerinthehome:moth-\ner's age at the time of the child's birth,\nsmokingduringpregnancy,reportedcur-\nrent weight and height, and whether the\ninfant received special neonatal care and\ndurationofthatcare.Sexwastakenfrom\nNHANES III and checked for discrep-\nancies with the birth certificate. Moth-\ner's weight and height were converted\nintoabodymassindex(BMI,kg/m2),ex-\ncept for 145 subjects who had missing\ninformation. Maternal BMI was classi-\nses, the underweight and normal weight\nwomen were combined as the reference\nbecause only 88 women were classified\nas underweight.\nInfant Feeding\nQuestions on infant feeding practices\nincluded whether the child was ever\nbreastfed and the age (converted into\nmonths) when the child completely\nstopped breastfeeding, was first fed\nformula daily, completely stopped\ndrinking formula, was first fed milk\ndaily, and started eating solid foods\ndaily.12 Infant feeding was defined\nbased on the duration (in months)\nthat the children were fully breastfed\n(no liquids daily other than breast\nmilk or water). Infants who were par-\ntially breastfed (supplemented daily\nwith formula or milk) were no longer\nconsidered fully breastfed once daily\nsupplementation with formula or milk\nbegan. Feeding groups were classified\nas never breastfed and fully breastfed\nto 8 months, and 9 months or more.\nTiming (in months) of the introduc-\ntion of solid foods was considered\nseparately because timing of the intro-\nduction of solids does not appear to\nalter growth and body composition in\nChild Weight Status\nBody weight and height were mea-\nsured using standard anthropometric\ncalculated, and weight status was de-\nfined using BMI-for-age percentiles\nfrom the revised NCHS/CDC growth\ncharts.24 Body mass index and weight\nstatus based on BMI-for-age were cho-\nsen as the primary dependent vari-\nables because BMI is the worldwide\nstandard for screening for overweight\nin children, it is based on highly reli-\nablemeasurements(heightandweight),\nand even in early childhood BMI is\nTwenty-nine children had missing\nheights or weights. Following current\nguidelines for children and adoles-\ncents, a BMI between the 85th through\n94th percentile was considered \"at risk\nof overweight\" and at or above the 95th\nchildren generally are not designated\n\"obese,\" even at or above the 95th per-\ncentile of BMI-for-age, in the absence\nof clinical evaluation. The 95th per-\ncentile corresponds to a BMI of 30.0 or\nOther Exclusions\nwith interview, examination, and birth\ncertificate data, 76 twins and triplets\nwere excluded, as were cases missing\nbirth weight (n=5), sex (n=4), and in-\nfant feeding (n=5). Twenty-nine chil-\ng) were excluded because they were not\nsufficiently mature at birth to initiate\nbreastfeeding, and they remained small\nthrough childhood. For the same rea-\nson, 75 children with extended periods\n(2weeks)ofspecialneonatalcarewere\nexcluded. The final analytic sample was\nStatistical Methods\nFollowing NCHS/CDC analytic guide-\nlines, statistical sample weights for ex-\namined children were used (weighted)\nto account both for the oversampling\nand unit nonresponse.27 Both nonre-\nsponse and poststratification adjust-\nments impose a great deal of hetero-\ngeneity into the weights, and thus\nignoring the sample weights in this case\nwould have imposed a bias in both the\nprevalence estimates and in the esti-\nmates of sampling error.\nSUDAAN software, which incorpo-\nrates the heterogeneity in survey weight\nalong with the clustering effects in sur-\nvey design, was used for statistical\nanalysis and to estimate standard er-\nrors (SEs).28 The effect of duration of\nfull breastfeeding (in months) on child\nBMI was examined by multiple regres-\nsion. The likelihood of being at risk of\noverweight and overweight among fully\nbreastfed as compared with never\nbreastfed children was estimated us-\ning the SUDAAN MULTILOG proce-\ndure. MULTILOG is an extension of tra-\nditional logistic regression with the\ncapability to model multiple level out-\ncomes. Using the MULTILOG proce-\ndure, odds and adjusted odds ratios for\nat risk of overweight and overweight\nwere estimated in the same model with\nthe normal BMI group ( 85th percen-\ntile) as the reference. Possible con-\nfounding variables were selected for in-\nclusion based on both forward selection\nand backward deletion, with the deci-\nsion to include or delete based on\nchanges in the significance and  val-\nues of the exposure effects (duration of\nbreastfeeding).29 In parallel, most analy-\nses were performed unweighted to con-\nfirm that the significance of the find-\nings was not affected by the variance\nestimates used to account for the sample\ndesign.

Children fully\nbreastfed for 3 months or longer were at\nabout a 30% decreased risk for over-\nweight,buttheCIsfortheestimateswere\nwideandincludedunity.Durationoffull\nbreastfeeding as an independent vari-\nable showed only a weak linear associa-\ntion with child BMI.\nOur results are in contrast to the find-\nings of von Kries et al,5 who reported a\nclear dose-dependent effect for dura-\ntion of exclusive breastfeeding (de-\nfined as the child having been fed \"no\nfood\" other than breast milk) on the\nprevalence of \"obesity\" (97th per-\ncentile for BMI) in Bavarian children at\nages 5 to 6 years. However, the cur-\nrent recommendation is to allow\nsupplementation with solids by 4 to 6\nmonths, while continuing full breast-\nfeeding for 12 months or more. The\nfindings of von Kries et al5 may be at-\ntributed to reverse causality, that is, the\nBavarian children who were exclu-\nsively breastfed for 6 months or longer\nwere smaller as infants, able to be nu-\ntritionally supported on breast milk\nalone longer, and were therefore less\nlikely to be at risk of overweight or to\nbe overweight in early childhood.\nOur findings are less likely to be at-\ntributable to such reverse causality, and\nthe study has additional strengths. The\nnationally representative sample of US-\nborn young children is ethnically di-\nverse, and the findings for breastfeed-\ning are consistent both with prevalence\ndata and with demographic associa-\ntions reported in other national stud-\nies.7-9 Our conclusions therefore are less\nlikely due to chance or sample bias, al-\nthough neither explanation can be to-\ntally ruled out. Having excluded in-\nor with extended periods ( 2 weeks)\nof special neonatal care, we were able\nto adjust for the effects of both mod-\nbirth weight, since both have been\nshown to be associated with early child-\nnot limiting our definition of breast-\nfeeding to those exclusively breastfed\nand allowing the introduction of sol-\nids at the recommended ages, we were\nbetter able to determine if there were\ninherent overweight-preventing prop-\nerties of breastfeeding, as compared\nwith lesser weight gain from a lower en-\nergy intake.\nBasing the duration of breastfeed-\ning on mother's recall is a limitation of\nthis study. However, studies of the re-\nliability of recalling infant feeding mode\nand duration have shown that, if any-\nthing, more highly educated mothers\ntend to overestimate the duration of full\nbreastfeeding.2,30 This would have the\neffect of exaggerating the beneficial ef-\nfects of breastfeeding on child over-\nweight since children born to more\nhighly educated parents tend to be\nhealthier, better nourished, and leaner.\nIt is unlikely, therefore, that recall bias\nis masking an association between\nbreastfeeding and early childhood over-\nweight.\nWe did find that factors other than in-\nfant feeding were associated with child\noverweight, implying that the associa-\ntion between breastfeeding and being at\nrisk of overweight may be confounded\nbyunmeasuredsociodemographicorin-\ntervening familial factors. Compared\nwith non-Hispanic white children,\nyoungMexican-Americanchildrenwere\nat significantly increased risk of over-\nweight, a finding that has been re-\nThe timing of the introduction of solid\nfoods was associated significantly with\na 0.1% reduction in risk of overweight\nfor each month that introduction of sol-\nids was delayed. For half of the sample,\ntimingofintroductionofsolidfoodswas\nconsistent with American Academy of\nPediatrics recommendations of 4 to 6\nmonths.1 A further delay in introduc-\ntion of solid foods in infancy would ap-\npear to provide a statistically signifi-\ncant but relatively minor reduction in\nrisk for overweight at ages 3 to 5 years.\nMehta et al20 have reported that early\n(3-4 months), as compared with late\n(6months),introductionofsolidfoods\ndid not affect infant growth or body\ncomposition in the first year of life and\nconcluded that early introduction of\nsolid foods in infancy simply displaced\nenergyintakefromliquidsources(breast\nmilk or formula), rather than supply-\ning additional energy that would con-\ntribute to overweight.\nBy far the strongest predictor of BMI\nstatus in young children was mother's\nconcurrent BMI. Risk of overweight\namong young children was nearly\ntripled with maternal overweight and\nmore than quadrupled with mothers'\nobesity. The overwhelming signifi-\ncance of the association between pa-\nrental obesity and overweight status in\nchildren younger than 5 years has also\nbeen demonstrated.31 It was shown that\nrisk among children ages 3 to 5 years\nof subsequently becoming obese as\nadults was nearly tripled for those with\nobese mothers compared with risk\namong children whose mothers were\nnot obese, although overweight in early\nchildhood is not by itself a strong pre-\ndictor of adult obesity. The extent to\nwhich familial tendencies to obesity are\ngenetic or associated with shared di-\netary and activity habits has yet to be\ndetermined, but it is unlikely that\nbreastfeeding alone would be suffi-\ncient to prevent the development of\noverweight in such a situation.\nOur findings therefore agree with\nprevious studies that have failed to find\nan association between mode of infant\nfeeding and body composition in early\nimplicated maternal or parental obe-\nnic groups that no measure of infant\nfeeding (breastfeeding or duration) was\nassociated with adiposity at 3 to 4 years\nof age. Likewise, Zive et al33 found no\nrelationship between duration of breast-\nfeeding and adiposity, as measured by\nBMI, for 331 children at 4 years of age.\nHowever, as we found in this study,\nZive et al33 found that mother's BMI ex-\nplained the largest portion of the vari-\nance in child fatness.\nOur study is best compared with that\nof O'Callaghan et al34 who reported in\nyears that birth weight, paternal BMI,\nand sleeplessness at 6 months pre-\ndicted risk of being at risk of over-\nwhile birth weight, being female, and\nmaternal and paternal BMI predicted in-\ncreased risk of overweight (95th\npercentile). On the other hand, whereas\nbirth weight and parental BMI were\nstrongly associated with risk of over-\nweight, breastfeeding and its duration\nwere not.34 We also found that a high\nwith an increased risk of having a high\nBMI in early childhood (85th percen-\ntile),buttheeffectwasdiminishedwhen\nmaternal BMI was considered.\nBetween infancyand ages 3to5years,\npatternsoffoodconsumptionandphysi-\ncal activity probably have more impact\non weight status in early childhood than\ninfant feeding. Because the NHANES III\nis a cross-sectional survey, no data are\navailable to describe relevant behav-\niors during this intervening period or to\ncharacterizethetimingorrelativeweight\nlevelatwhichtheadiposityreboundmay\nbe occurring. Children who reach the\nnadir of their BMI at ages younger than\n6 years before it once again increases\ntend to be at increased risk for over-\nsectional survey data is that the contri-\nbution of these time-dependent patterns\nto the development of overweight can-\nnot be evaluated.\nOverweight in early childhood is a\ngrowing problem in the United States.\nRecent findings from NHANES III\nchildren as young as 4 or 5 years, and\nespecially females and Mexican-\nAmericans, show an increased preva-\nlence of overweight. Mei et al38 have\ndocumented an increasing trend in\noverweight among low-income chil-\ndren aged 5 years or younger who were\nincluded in the CDC Pediatric Nutri-\net al38 also observed that overweight\nprevalence was higher for young fe-\nmales than for males, a trend that\nemerges as early as the preschool years\nand persists into adulthood. In this con-\ntext, the suggestion that breastfeeding\nmay be protective against the develop-\nment of overweight in children5,6 has\nraised expectations that promoting\nbreastfeeding might help reverse this\ntrend.\nThe findings from our analyses of US\nnational survey data do not support the\ncontention that breastfeeding and its\nduration are necessarily protective\nagainst early childhood overweight, al-\nthough there is some conferred protec-\ntion from being at risk of overweight.\nHowever, maternal obesity (suggest-\ning shared familial dietary habits and\nactivity patterns) far supersedes in-\nfant feeding as a risk factor for being\nat risk of overweight or overweight in\nearly childhood, and the dose-\ndependent effect for duration of breast-\nfeeding and risk for overweight is in-\nconsistent compared with that for\nmaternal obesity. The finding that over-\nweight and obese mothers were less\nlikely to have breastfed at all may sug-\ngest a synergisticeffectofmaternalover-\nweight status, combined with the ab-\nsence of breastfeeding, that results in\nincreased risk for overweight in the chil-\ndren of these mothers.\nIt cannot be too strongly empha-\nsized that breastfeeding has numer-\nous attributes that render it the pre-\nferred feeding choice for almost all\ninfants. However, duration of full\nbreastfeeding does not appear to be pre-\ndictive of or necessarily have preven-\ntive properties for overweight in early\nchildhood, and encouraging breast-\nfeeding for overweight prevention\nwould not be as effective as moderat-\ning familial factors in preventing early\nchildhood overweight.\nAuthor Contributions: Study concept and design:\nHediger, Overpeck, Kuczmarski, Ruan.\nAcquisition of data: Overpeck, Kuczmarski.\nAnalysis and interpretation of data: Hediger, Over-\npeck, Kuczmarski, Ruan.\nDrafting of the manuscript: Hediger.\nCritical revision of the manuscript for important in-\ntellectual content: Overpeck, Kuczmarski, Ruan.\nStatistical expertise: Hediger, Overpeck, Kuczmar-\nski, Ruan.\nObtained funding: Overpeck.\nAdministrative, technical, or material support: Over-\npeck.\nStudy supervision: Overpeck.\n"
