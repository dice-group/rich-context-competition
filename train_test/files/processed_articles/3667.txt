Compared with previous\nrecessions, European-wide policies and investments have significantly increased with attempts to support national policies. By\nmapping these developments and debates, we illustrate the different factors shaping the future of European labor markets.\nWe argue that understanding youth unemployment requires a holistic approach that combines an analysis of changes in the\neconomic sphere around labor market flexibility, skills attainment, and employer demand, as well as understanding the impact\nof family legacies affecting increasingly polarized trajectories for young people today.

Third, youth migration within the EU\nhas been more extensive, selective, and diversified than in\nprevious recessions. Fourth, family work history legacies\ncreate new forms of polarization for younger generations.\nAnd fifth, the EU has significantly expanded its role in pro-\nmoting and investing in policies to support national and EU\ninitiatives. On the basis of these distinctive characteristics,\nwe argue that the range of \"solutions\" policy makers develop\nfor different groups of young people will be affected not only\nby how the problem of youth unemployment is conceptual-\nized in different institutional settings but also by how policy\nlegacies from previous periods aimed at addressing youth\nunemployment in different societal contexts interact with\nrecent EU initiatives.\nThe Extent of the Problem\nConsiderable debate exists around definitions of what consti-\ntutes youth unemployment and by implication the kinds of\npolicy it requires. The OECD (2010) identifies \"poorly inte-\ngrated new entrants,\" who, although qualified, experience\npersistent difficulties in accessing stable employment. They\nare caught in a series of precarious jobs interspersed by rela-\ntively short periods of unemployment or economic inactivity.\nThis group accounts for about 20% to 30% on average of all\nyouth in the OECD countries, and these experiences are par-\nticularly prevalent in southern Europe (Scarpetta, Sonnet, &\nManfredi, 2010). With the expansion of tertiary education,\nan increase in part-time and temporary work in student labor\nmarkets (Purcell, 2010), and the high share of graduates end-\ning up unemployed or in non-standard employment, the tran-\nsitions between education and employment are becoming\nincreasingly blurred and diversified (Knijn, 2012), illustra-\ntive of the experiences of poorly integrated youth.\nIn contrast the \"youth left behind\" face multiple disadvan-\ntages: They are more likely to have no qualifications, to\ncome from an immigrant/minority background, and/or to live\nin disadvantaged, rural, or remote areas (Eurofound, 2012b).\nThe share of those not in employment, education, or training\nvariations in the share of NEETs range from around 5% to\n10% in Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany,\nAustria, Sweden, Czech Republic, Slovenia, and Finland to\nmore than 20% in Greece, Bulgaria, and Italy. Increases of\nmore than five percentage points during the last 4 years were\nobserved in Greece, Ireland, Cyprus, and Italy. Young adults\n(25-29 years), particularly women, display very high NEET\nrates, and in many cases higher than those of young people\nbetween 15 and 24 years (European Trade Union\nConfederation [ETUC]/European Trade Union Institute\n[ETUI], 2014). The distinction between \"poorly integrated\nnew entrants\" and the buildup of those \"left behind\" captures\nsome of the diversity among young people looking for work\nThere has been an increasing use of the distinction\nbetween rates and ratios to discuss this problem\n(Hadjivassiliou et al., 2015).1 Rates are higher than ratios\nbecause this measure is based on the number of unemployed\nO'Reilly et al. 3\nyouth divided by the total number of youth in the labor force\n(employed and unemployed). The unemployment ratio is\nlower because the denominator is the total population of\nyoung people (including those in education and training).\nHill (2012) argues that ratios provide a more accurate mea-\nsure in European debates because those not looking for full-\ntime work, that is, full-time students, are included in the\ndenominator; this provides a more correct estimate of those\nwho are really looking for full-time work as a proportion of\nthe total youth population.\nThe ratio measure reduces levels of youth unemployment\nto about half. This does not change the significance of the\nproblem for countries facing the highest rates (Table 1). But,\nit does draw attention to some countries where the rates of\nyouth unemployment are relatively low and where their\nratios are much higher than the EU average, for example, in\nSweden and the United Kingdom. The inverse is true, for\nexample, in Poland, Bulgaria, and Hungary, where the rates\nare higher than the EU-28 average, but the ratios are rela-\ntively low, that is, below 10%. This would suggest that in\nthese latter countries, a higher proportion of non-employed\nyoung people in the calculation of the denominator are either\nin education or are NEETs. These groups of young people\nrequire very different policy responses.\nUnderstanding the significance of this definitional issue is\nillustrated by looking at the British case. At its peak in 1984,\n2). This measure would suggest that the situation was worse\n10% of the youth population) were unemployed. \"This com-\nper cent) in 1984\" (Office of National Statistics [ONS],\nor 1990s, but when we compare the proportions/ratios of\nunemployed youth in the final quarter of 2011, excluding\nfull-time students, these are \"the highest since records began\"\nThese measurement debates are both political and aca-\ndemic: They are academic in terms of how we should accu-\nrately measure and interpret this phenomenon, and they are\npolitical in terms of appreciating its significance and the\npolicies required to address it. Based on an extensive review\nof existing evidence, we argue that five distinctive character-\nistics differentiate the current phase of youth unemployment\nfrom earlier periods. These dimensions allow us to under-\nstand how different explanations and potential policy solu-\ntions have been developed to account for this phenomenon.\nHere we examine debates on labor market flexibility, skills\nmismatch, migration, family legacies, and the EU initiatives.\nIncreased Labor Market Flexibility\nIn the early 1990s, the conventional understanding of the\npoor job creation capacity of the European economy rested\nalmost entirely on labor market rigidities; the suggested rec-\nommendation went in the direction of deregulating the labor\nmarket to make it more flexible (Simonazzi & Villa, 1999).\nWhere flexibility has increased, this has often happened on\nthe margins and has frequently been seen at the cost of secu-\nrity to employees (Boeri, 2011; Eamets, Philips, Alloja, &\nas \"partial and targeted deregulation\" (Esping-Andersen &\nRegini, 2000), \"two-tier reforms,\" and reforms \"at the mar-\ngin\" (European Commission, 2010a). It has created seg-\nmented labor markets where the burden of flexibility falls on\nworkers with \"atypical\" contracts--with youth being consid-\nerably more likely to have fixed-term or temporary contracts\ncompared with prime-age workers (Eichhorst et al., 2014).\nYouth employment is characterized by high shares of tem-\nporary and part-time work (European Commission, 2014a).\nOf those below 25 years, 42% are on temporary contracts\n2014b). Countries with the highest rates of young people\nworking in temporary jobs are Slovenia, Poland, Germany,\nSpain, Portugal, Sweden, France, the Netherlands, and Italy.\nThe percentage of young people in temporary work ranged\nlevels were in Romania, Lithuania, Estonia, Bulgaria, Latvia,\nMalta, Cyprus, the United Kingdom, and Slovakia, where\nless than 13% of youth employment was in temporary jobs\nyoung people were in temporary employment \"involun-\ntarily\" (Eurofound, 2014b). Part-time work is also an\nTable 2.

However, temporary contracts are known to\npay less, offer less on-the-job training, be less satisfying than\nstandard contracts, and also result in incomplete contribu-\ntions to pensions and unemployment benefits (Eurofound,\n2014b). They are often used as cheaper alternatives to offer-\nChung, Bekker, and Houwing (2012) argue that low and\ndecreasing transition rates from temporary work into perma-\nnent employment suggest that temporary work creates a\ncohort rather than an age effect: Younger generations may, in\ncontrast to previous generations, be facing long-term labor\nmarket risks and scarring processes (Van Lancker, 2012).\nYoung people's insecurity in employment and income not\nonly impairs access to credit and residential independence\nand inhibits long-term commitments like family formation, it\ncan also lead to subjective insecurities (Chung et al., 2012).\nThere is a strong correlation between subjective insecurity\nemployment contract (Erlinghagen, 2008). Paugam and\nZhou (2007) show how the strength of this relationship var-\nies across countries: The contrast in subjective insecurity\nbetween permanent and temporary workers is particularly\nstark in France and weakest in Denmark, indicating that\ninstitutional factors mediate this experience. Subjective inse-\ncurity is influenced not only by individual and occupational\ncharacteristics such as sex, age, family responsibilities, occu-\npation, public- versus private-sector employment, and the\nsize of organization (Clark & Postel-Vinay, 2009) but also by\nwider economic factors such as the unemployment levels\nErlinghagen (2008) suggest that while institutional factors\nsuch as employment protection levels and social security\nspending were correlated with levels of subjective insecurity,\nthese factors were less important than individual/job charac-\nteristics and economic conditions.\nPolicy initiatives to limit the successive use of fixed-term\ncontracts and to reduce divisions between temporary and\npermanent workers are captured in some of the debates on\nflexicurity. This policy concept encapsulates initiatives that\nboth enhance labor market flexibility and employment and\nincome security (Wilthagen & Tros, 2004). Policy makers,\nespecially at the EU level, have been interested in identifying\nwhich elements of the best performing countries are respon-\nsible for their success and if, or how, these best practices\ncould be transferred to other countries (European\nHowever, critical evaluations of the effectiveness of these\ninitiatives point to the fact that there is no universally agreed-\nupon definition of what these mean in different institutional\ntrade unions have been particularly concerned about the con-\nsequences of the shift in emphasis from job security to\nemployment security (Bekker, 2011; Council of the European\nUnion, 2012).And many unanswered questions remain about\nthe resilience of these systems during the recent economic\ncrisis, and the consequences this has on youth transitions,\nsubjective feelings of insecurity, and the effectiveness of\npolicy reform (Leschke, 2012). Notwithstanding criticism,\nthe concept remains an important component of the Europe\nOur first characteristic of the pervasive growth of labor\nmarket flexibility since the 1980s and its impact on youth\nemployment opportunities is illustrated by these debates.\nThe changing structure of the youth labor market and the\nassociated difficulty in accessing entry-level jobs poses a\nmajor challenge for young people looking for work.\nMoreover, the progressive polarization and hollowing out of\nthe labor market have resulted in fewer jobs for the low- and\nmid-qualified. The reduction of intermediate-level jobs\nresults in fewer opportunities for progression beyond entry-\nlevel jobs. Changing employers' expectations that young\npeople should be \"job-ready\" has emphasized the need for\neducation systems to teach \"employability\" skills. In attempts\nto obtain these skills, we have witnessed an expansion of\ninternships (Lain et al., 2014), many of which are unpaid or\nvery poorly paid. Some employers have been criticized for\nusing these to avoid employing young people with properly\npaid probation periods. New forms of labor market flexibil-\nity, alongside the expansion of education and skills, are\nreshaping the consequences associated with different youth\ntransition trajectories.\nExpansion of Education, Skill, and\nQualifications Mismatch\nChanges in the structure of employment and employers'skill\nexpectations since the 1980s have gone alongside a signifi-\ncant expansion of education systems (Berman, Bound, &\n2014; U.K. Commission's Employer Skills Survey [UKCES],\n2012). This has generated considerable research interest in\nthe issue of skills and qualification mismatch (European\ngenerally describes the situation whereby the skill levels or\neducation of the individual are to some degree misaligned\nwith the productivity requirements of the firm, that is, there\nis an imbalance between labor supply and labor demand.\nO'Reilly et al. 5\nWhile the overall concept of mismatch seems quite straight-\nforward, the measurement of mismatch is somewhat more\ncomplicated and will be largely dependent upon both data\navailability and whether the concept is being explored from\nthe perspective of the worker or the firm. Most studies have\nfocused on mismatch from the point of view of the worker,\nand the bulk of the literature, to date, has used over-\neducation as the key measure of mismatch (Quintini, 2011).\nOver-education refers to the situation whereby workers\nhold more qualifications than are required for their current\njob. Within the over-education literature, educational attain-\nment is taken as a proxy for worker human capital (labor\nsupply), while job entry requirements are taken as a proxy\nmeasure of job productivity requirements (labor demand).\nNevertheless, the over-education measure has been criticized\nby a number of authors (Mavromaras, McGuinness, & King\neducational attainment will under-estimate an individual's\ntotal human capital as it ignores skills acquired in the work-\nplace. Furthermore, job entry requirements are often a poor\nmeasure of job productivity as a consequence of qualifica-\ntions inflation.\nMore recently studies have focused on over-skilling as the\nkey measure of mismatch, on the grounds that it more accu-\nrately measures the imbalance between the demand and sup-\nply of labor (Allen & van der Velden, 2001; Green &\nrequires the worker to directly compare all their acquired\nskills with actual job requirements and, as such, they will\ntake account of both formal and informal learning as well as\nactual job content. It is argued that the over-skilling measure\ngets over many of the weaknesses associated with an over-\neducation indicator. In practice, however, the measure\nadopted is generally dictated by the nature of the data\navailable.\nOver-education and over-skilling describe situations\nwhere the worker has too much education or too many skills\nfor the current job. Conversely, under-education and under-\nskilling describes the situation whereby workers report hav-\ning insufficient levels of education or skills for their current\nemployment. Generally, workers who are under-educated or\nunder-skilled have been found to earn a pay premium rela-\ntive to their counterparts who are well matched. The lack of\nany obvious negative impacts associated with under-educa-\ntion and under-skilling from the perspective of the employee\nis the most probable explanation for the lack of research\nactivity in the area.\nOver-education and over-skilling are associated with sub-\nstantial wage penalties and lower levels of job satisfaction.\nNevertheless, it cannot be assumed that over-education and\nover-skilling are interchangeable. In general, studies have\nfound that relatively low proportions of workers reporting\nover-education also describe themselves as being over-skilled\nand vice versa (Allen & van der Velden, 2001; Green &\nwage penalties appear higher for over-educated workers\nwhile over-skilled workers tend to be less satisfied with their\njobs (McGuinness & Sloane, 2011). Individuals who are\nmismatched experience lower rates of career progression,\nwith the evidence suggesting that both over-education and\nover-skilling tend to have a long-term impact. Despite hav-\ning higher rates of job separation and mobility, mismatched\nworkers are more likely to move from one state of over-\neducation/over-skilling to another (Dolton & Siles, 2003;\nMcGuinness & Wooden, 2009). In addition to lower levels of\nearnings, job satisfaction, and career progression, mismatch\nis also associated with cognitive decline, particularly with\nregard to immediate and delayed recall abilities, cognitive\nflexibility, and verbal fluency (de Grip, Bosma, Willems, &\nStudies of over-education or over-skilling with specific\nreference to young people are relatively rare. Extant litera-\nture shows that being mismatched in their first employment\ntends to permanently constrain substantial proportions of\ngraduates to low-level occupations (Dolton & Siles, 2003;\nover-educated in 1981 were still so after 10 years. However,\nthere is a distinct lack of work focusing on the youth labor\nmarket despite the fact that existing evidence suggests that\nan unsuccessful match at the point of labor market entry is\nthe most crucial determinant of mismatch in later life\nFurthermore, we know little of the determinants of mis-\nmatch within countries, for example, the extent to which it\nrelates to the nature of educational provision, job-search\nbehavior, inadequate levels of labor market demand, or the\nrole of institutions. To a large extent, the paucity of knowl-\nedge on the determinants of mismatch relates to data con-\nstraints and an over-reliance of country-specific micro-level\ndata that does not allow researchers to disentangle such\neffects. Finally, there has been little work on the impact of\nbusiness cycle effects and, more specifically, the degree to\nwhich the incidence and impacts of mismatch within the\nyouth labor market have worsened as a consequence of\nrecent recessions in many European countries.\nGender differences are also likely to prove important as it\nhas been argued that females, particularly those that are mar-\nried, are more likely to be restricted to local geographical\nareas in terms of their labor market search activities, which\nmay, in turn, expose them to a higher probability of mis-\nmatch or unemployment (Frank, 1978). While some limited\nresearch has been carried out with regard to gender differ-\nences in rates of over-education (Buchel & Battu, 2003;\nwork has been carried out with regard to the youth labor mar-\nket or in terms of more recent concepts of mismatch such as\nover-skilling.\nThe focus on country-specific micro data sets in the litera-\nture implies that studies tend to focus on a specific outcome\n6 SAGE Open\nor determinant of mismatch, which has led to a situation\nwhereby knowledge of the topic has expanded in a rather\npiecemeal fashion without any real advancement of the\nunderstanding of the causes of mismatch. It is only through\nthe exploitation of cross-country data sets with a time vary-\ning component that the relative importance of factors such as\nthe expansion of educational supply, the structure of labor\nmarket demand, institutions in determining levels of mis-\nmatch, among both adults and young people, will be properly\nOur second characteristic of the expansion of education\nand skills mismatch is interwoven with the extent of struc-\ntural labor market changes over recent decades, and the con-\nsequences this has for differently qualified young people\nlooking for work (European Commission, 2012c). One con-\nsequence has been evidenced in new patterns of youth mobil-\nity, as both highly educated young people and those with\nfewer qualifications move across the EU to find work.\nYouth Migration\nIntra-EU labor mobility has been promoted as an adjustment\nmechanism to ensure more efficient labor allocation across\nthe EU by contributing to better labor market matching and\nreducing regional disparities in unemployment (European\nunexpected level of intra-EU migration from Central\u00adEastern\nEurope to Western Europe, although this varied between\ncountries (OECD, 2014). Post-accession East\u00adWest migra-\ntion has been composed of a high share of youth migrants\nwith tertiary education (Favell, 2008; Kaczmarczyk &\nels of qualifications, a majority found employment in low-\nskilled jobs with limited degrees of upward job mobility and\nlow earnings (Johnston, Khattab, & Manley, 2014;\nHigh rates of youth mobility can be explained by a com-\nplex set of push and pull factors. These include the economic\nsituation in the sending and receiving country; policy mea-\nsures inciting or preventing migration (the so-called transi-\ntional measures); geographic, language, and cultural\nproximity; as well as the differential distribution of migrant\nnetworks across Europe (Kahanec & Zimmermann, 2010).\nYouth mobility from East to West has also been discussed as\na \"choice\" to \"exit\" native labor markets experiencing diffi-\ncult economic conditions or as a \"brain overflow,\" where\nyounger cohorts have benefited from increased access to ter-\ntiary education, but these qualifications do not fit well with\nthe structure of the labor demand in their own countries\n(Galg\u00f3czi, Leschke, & Watt, 2012; Kaczmarczyk & Ok\u00f3lski,\nThe recent global economic crisis further reshuffled the\ndistribution of intra-EU migration. It temporarily slowed\ndown the rates of outward migration from some of the\nCentral\u00adEastern Europe countries or led to onward migration\nfrom those countries where it was becoming more difficult to\nfind work. In some cases, return migration occurred to coun-\ntries that were less affected by the crisis such as Poland and\nSlovakia, or countries experiencing a faster recovery, such as\nNorth emigration has re-emerged as young people from\nSpain, Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Ireland move to find work\nin parts of northern Europe or outside the EU altogether.\nIntra-EU mobility might contribute to better macro-level\noutcomes in terms of lower unemployment rates across the\nEU and increasing the options and experiences for young\nEuropeans (Galg\u00f3czi, Leschke, & Watt, 2009; OECD,\n2012b). However, this mobility might come at the cost of\nsome young migrant workers employed on very short-term\nflexible contracts and accepting jobs beneath their qualifica-\ntions that employers find difficult to recognize (Eurostat,\nThe ultimate effects of youth labor mobility and return\nmigration will depend on whether the migrants and returnees\nwill have accumulated, or depleted, their human, financial,\nand social capital during their migration experience. To date,\nrelatively little is known about selectivity of West\u00adEast\nreturn mobility, their occupational trajectories, and labor\nmarket outcomes (Anacka & Fihel, 2012; Radu & Martin,\nfits of labor mobility may well be limited, if those returning\nare going back to areas with difficult economic circum-\nstances (Barcevicius, Iglicka, Repeckait, & Zvalionyt,\nPolicies affecting mobility and migration provided by\nwelfare and social security (and their transferability within\nthe EU) have become particularly political issues (Bruzelius,\nChase, & Seeleib-Kaiser, 2014). On one hand, critiques of\nthe principles of \"free movement\" of labor within the EU\nhave been voiced by a variety of Eurosceptics wanting to\ncurtail immigration flows. On the other hand, a less vocifer-\nous debate on policies to facilitate mobility has discussed the\npotential transferability of welfare and social security entitle-\nments through the development of a European social insur-\nance fund (Vandenbroucke, 2014), in which policy reform is\npart of a \"social investment state\" (Knijn, 2012; Morel,\nA further range of policies has sought to improve job\nmatching and information through various EU employment\npackages and the extension of the Erasmus mobility scheme\nto include young apprentices as well as its traditional base of\nuniversity graduates. These exist alongside other labor mar-\nket intermediaries such as recruitment agencies or temporary\nemployment agencies, whose role in shaping labor mobility\nand influencing the character of employment contracts,\nwages, and working conditions of youth migrant workers\nfrequently divides opinion on the negative and beneficial\nO'Reilly et al. 7\neffects for both the host communities and migrants (Coe,\nMore recently, attention has started to be focused on what\nhappens to migrants and their children who settle abroad and\nestablish families. Recent OECD (2014) research shows that\nthe proportion of 15-year-olds with two foreign-born parents\nhas doubled in the past decade. For second-generation chil-\ndren whose parents have low levels of education issues of\nintegration are becoming more important in affecting their\nown labor market entrance. According to Castagnone, Nazio,\nBartolini, and Schoumaker (2014), non-EU migrants experi-\nence a dramatic downgrading and slow occupational recov-\nery during their first decade working in Europe. Reducing\nthe educational\u00adoccupational mismatch requires obtaining\n(further) qualifications in the destination countries that\nemployers find easier to recognize. For second-generation\nyouth, that is, the children of earlier waves of migration, the\nimpact of ethnic penalties in attaining skills, qualifications,\nand occupational status varies by the ethnic status of their\nparents (Zuccotti, 2014). Clearly parents always matter, and\nwith increasing levels of migration, our third characteristic,\nwhere their parents come from, will matter even more, both\nfor those who move and those who establish new families in\nforeign countries.\nThe Family Legacy\nFor some young people, unemployment is a frictional experi-\nence; for others, long-term exposure is part of a generational\nlegacy (Martin, 2012). This legacy is a result of demographic\nchanges, the expansion of higher education, and structural\nin the large-scale displacement of traditional manufacturing\nsector employment.\nThe experience of the parents of today's children shapes\ntheir opportunities through the transmission of resources and\ncultural capital (Warmuth, Kittel, Steiber, & M\u00fchlb\u00f6ck,\n2014). We know from earlier research that parental unem-\nployment can become an \"unintended\" legacy for their own\nchildren, depending on where they live and how the econ-\nomy around them has changed in recent decades (Ekhaugen,\nThe \"culture of poverty\" approach attributed inter-gener-\national unemployment to factors such as poor role models\nand the transmission of attitudes toward employment and\nexplanation is also prominent in the popular media\n(MacDonald, Shildrick, & Furlong, 2013). Such cultural\naccounts have been criticized for failing to adequately\nacknowledge the role of structural economic inequalities\n(Bynner, 2005), lack of evidence on distinct attitudes among\nthe unemployed (Gallie, 1994), and exaggerated claims\nabout the pervasiveness and persistence of joblessness in\nhouseholds and communities (MacDonald et al., 2014).\nFamily heterogeneity, such as parental education, household\nincome, and nationality, was found to account for almost half\nof the inter-generational correlation in employment in\nNorwegian families while unobserved family fixed effects\n(i.e., other factors that are not explained by the above men-\ntioned characteristics) \"accounted\" for the remaining differ-\nfound that parental education had an effect on youth labour\nmarket transitions, this effect is increasing over time and\ncontributing to growing levels of inequalities amongst young\npeople. In the United Kingdom, Macmillan (2014) highlights\nthe role of high unemployment in the local labor markets in\naccounting for shared risks of parents and children. Some of\nthis debate has been polarized between identifying different\nexplanations for the same phenomenon: Is the persistence of\ninter-generational legacies of unemployment due to (a) atti-\ntudinal differences, (b) regional disparities in available jobs,\nor (c) the effects of the benefits system if young people are to\ntake up paid work, while still living at home with their par-\nents who may be reliant on benefits? Disentangling these\nfactors is a research priority.\nSuch processes mean that youth unemployment today is\nlikely to be affected by the polarization of work-poor and\nwork-rich households since the 1980s. The concentration of\njoblessness within households also has implications for the\nlevel of poverty experience by unemployed youth (de Graaf-\nZijl & Nolan, 2011). Opportunities to find work are linked\nnot to some inherited attitudes on dependency, but on the\nregions in which they live. Gregg and Wadsworth (2000)\ndraw attention to this development in the early 1990s by\nidentifying households where no one was working (i.e.,\nwork-poor) compared with households where two or more\npeople were in employment (work-rich). The importance of\nthis gap varied between countries with Ireland, the United\nKingdom, and Spain having the highest proportions of work-\npoor households (Anxo & O'Reilly, 2001). A range of poli-\ncies in the 1990s reduced the proportion of workless\nthe proportions of work-poor households are beginning to\nrise again and are expected to increase even further (Gregg,\nAlongside the impact of parental work legacies, the pat-\nterns of leaving home have become more diverse, not always\nreflecting a simple step toward economic independence.\nYoung people leave, for different reasons, and are increas-\ningly, intermittently, coming back. Newman (2012) refers to\nthis emerging phenomenon as the \"boomerang generation\"\ncreating \"accordion families\" that shrink and expand in rela-\ntion to these generational movements. Newman argues that\nthis phenomenon is present across a number of highly devel-\noped countries. In Japan, where the economic crisis came\nmuch earlier in the 1990s, and persists, a growing number of\nyoung people, in their late 20s or early 30s, still living at\nhome, are derogatively referred to as \"parasite singles.\"\n8 SAGE Open\npopularized stigma fails to recognize how the segmented\nstructure of Japanese firms places insurmountable barriers\nfor young men to achieve the characteristic career of \"salary\nmen.\" In Italian media, a similar invective against \"bamboc-\ncioni\" labels such young men as \"grown-up babies.\" But\nSaraceno (2012) argues that these individualized experiences\nneed to be contextualized: Young Italians have the lowest\nsalary levels, the highest degrees of precariousness in Europe,\nand scant if no access to unemployment benefits. Even in\nGermany, Geserick (2011) shows that the term \"Nesthocker\"\nat \"Hotel Mama\" is becoming a visible trend. But negative\nconnotations depend on whether this is seen as a long- or\nshort-term trajectory, and should also be linked to the eco-\nnomic status of the families who are able to continue sup-\nporting their adult children.\nWhen jobs are scarce, parents and other networks can\nbecome important factors in getting a job (Berloffa, Modena,\nnomic times when jobs are available, youth unemployment\ncan also be high because of the gap between expectations,\naspirations, and the realities of low wages and poor working\nconditions on offer (Giraldo & Trivellato, 2006). The distinc-\ntion between young people who can afford to wait for better\nopportunities, compared with those who have to take what is\non offer, is shaped by their family situation and specific soci-\netal conditions (Bukodi & Goldthorpe, 2011).\nParents not only influence employment outcomes but also\noften provide direct financial transfers and practical help to\ntheir adult children during the process of transition to adult-\nSwartz, Kim, Uno, Mortimer, and O'Brien (2011), parental\nsupport can be temporary support that contributes to human\ncapital accumulation or other major goals of social status\nattainment, such as college finance (Henretta, Wolf, van\npurchasing housing (Kurz & Blossfeld, 2004). Both eco-\nnomic theories on altruistic transfers (Cox, 1987) and socio-\nlogical theories about contingent transfers (Wightman,\nSchoeni, & Robinson, 2012) imply that parents will be\ninclined to help adult children in need, where they can. There\nare a variety of ways in which parental support affects youth\nlabor market transitions.

Knijn and Smith argue that policies encom-\npassed by these different paradigms can be distinguished\nbetween those emphasizing investing in, facilitating, and\nindividualizing new social risks. Policies include a broad\nspectrum. These cover educational social investments to\nfacilitate secure transitions; policies that encourage individu-\nalized responsibility and investment in their own human\ncapital, entrepreneurial activities, or private saving schemes\nto protect against social risks (Knijn, 2012). In Knijn and\nSmith's comprehensive review of youth policies before the\ncrisis, they argue that EU approach tends to overlap espe-\ncially between the first and second paradigms; they share a\nsimilar language but policy implementation has not been\nguided by a comprehensive new paradigm (Hall, 1993).\nSince Knijn and Smith's review, a range of new policies has\nbeen introduced to address youth unemployment as a result\nof the economic crisis and its impact on youth (Table 3). We\noutline these policies before discussing the problems of pol-\nicy evaluation.\nThe Europe 2020 strategy was based around flagship initia-\ntives to promote economic growth. The Youth on the Move\nflagship aims to enhance the performance and quality of the\neducation and training systems, promote youth mobility,\nboth for learning and work purposes, ensure a smooth and\nspeedy labor market transition of young people, and rein-\nforce the international attractiveness of Europe's higher edu-\nThe Agenda for New Skills and Jobs flagship seeks to\nachieve a better skills match through dialogue in the design\nof qualifications and training provision between education/\ntraining providers, social partners, and employers (European\nCommission, 2012b).

The Europe 2020\ninitiative also plans to build on the success of the pilot\nErasmus program for young entrepreneurs by establishing a\npermanent program encouraging exchange of individuals\nO'Reilly et al. 9\nand expertise between new entrepreneurs and host\nenterprises.\nThe third flagship, the European Platform Against\nPoverty, promotes social inclusion and cohesion through the\ndesign of innovative programs aimed at providing education,\nemployment, and training opportunities for the most vulner-\nable. It includes (a) a communication proposing policies to\ncombat early school leaving, (b) the launch in 2012 of an\ninitiative to encourage more effective intervention at all\nstages of education to tackle disadvantage, and (c) a recom-\nmendation in 2012 on child poverty (Council of the European\nEU efforts are mainly focused on promoting mobility\nthrough the provision of information, for example, through a\nEuropean Labor Market Monitor to disseminate data on\nvacancies and job seekers across the EU, a multilingual dic-\ntionary of occupations and skills to improve understanding\nof vacancy information and a \"Match and Map\" system\nwhich both matches user profiles to jobs and geographically\nmaps the location of jobs, addressing the third characteristic\nidentified here around youth mobility.

The\nCommission also urged Member States to make better use of\nthe ESF, which still had 30 billion of funding uncommitted\nThe YOI called on social partners, where appropriate,\nwith the help of the relevant Member States' authorities, to\nexplore how they could promote these goals. The European\nSocial Partners'Framework Agreement on Inclusive Labour\nMarkets (ETUC/Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration Europ\u00e9enne des Syndicats\n[CES], 2012) outlines how they see the action of the social\npartners to include \"awareness-raising\" and dissemination;\ncooperation with the \"third sector\"; cooperation with voca-\ntional education and training (VET) providers to \"ease tran-\nsitions\"; implementing effective recruitment, induction\nprograms, and competence development plans for young\npeople; facilitating geographical and occupational mobility\nthrough the recognition and transferability of qualifica-\ntions; and promoting more and better apprenticeship\ncontracts.\nByApril 2012, and in response to the prolonged economic\ncrisis, an employment package \"Towards a Job-Rich\nRecovery\"4 was adopted to address skills and geographical\nmismatch. This policy communication included incentives to\nencourage hiring of some disadvantaged groups. However,\nthe main focus was on the supply side. Proposals included\nreducing taxes on labor or supporting business start-ups, and\npromoting cross-border job mobility. It also identified the\nareas with the biggest job potential for the future, including\nthe green economy, health services, and information and\ncommunications technologies (ICTs). The policy communi-\ncation underlined the need for a stronger employment and\nsocial dimension to EU governance and lays down ways to\ninvolve employers'and workers'representatives more in set-\nting EU priorities. However, given the structural weakness of\nunions in the majority of European countries since the 1980s,\ntheir role today is more likely to be one of consultation and\nadvice about implementation in this policy process.\nThe Youth Employment Package (YEP) and the\nYouth Employment Initiative (YEI)\nBy December 2012, further initiatives under the YEP\nincluded four key actions. It recommended that Member\nStates introduce the \"youth guarantee\" ensuring that all\nyoung people up to age 25 received a quality offer of a job,\ncontinued education, an apprenticeship, or a traineeship\nwithin 4 months of leaving formal education or becoming\nunemployed.\nFollowing on from this, in March 2013, the \"Grand\nCoalition for Digital Jobs\"5 was launched outlining measures\nto increase job mobility, and rationalize training and certifi-\ncation in the sector to match skills to vacancies. In the same\nmonth, the Commission announced the YEI, which rein-\nforced the measures outlined in the YEP. In particular, the\nYEI and its 6 billion budget aims to support NEETs in\nregions with a youth unemployment rate above 25%\n(European Commission, 2013b). The YEI's funds comprise\n3 billion from the ESF and 3 billion from a new budget\nline dedicated specifically to youth unemployment; Greece,\nSpain, and Italy will receive the largest share of the YEI, 3.4\nbillion. An estimated 7.5 million young Europeans aged 15\nto 24 are currently classified as NEETs; the YEI's implemen-\ntation is front-loaded so that funding is committed in 2014\nMultiannual Financial Framework (MFF).\nThe Youth Guarantee (YG)\nThe YEI's funds are channeled to the design and implemen-\ntation of the YG based on its success in Nordic countries and\nAustria. The Finnish YG resulted in a significant reduction in\nyouth unemployment through either direct employment\nassistance or further training leading to a job (European\nCommission, 2014b). In an evaluation of the Swedish YG\nparticipated in the program in 2008 were able to find a job\nfaster than a control group of participants in other Public\nEmployment Service (PES) measures (Eurofound, 2012a,\n2012c). As a result, YGs feature prominently both in the YEI\nand in the Commission's Communication Working Together\nfor Europe's Young People--A Call to Action on Youth\nerating the implementation of the YG more widely across\nThe YG concept implies an entitlement to a job, training,\nor education of a defined group of young people and an obli-\ngation for the PES or another public authority to provide the\nservices and/or implement the programs within a given\nperiod of time (ILO, 2012b). The debate around an EU YG at\nthe European level started in 2005 when the Council agreed\nthat every young unemployed is offered a new start within 6\nmonths of unemployment. However, despite several calls for\nYGs over the years, in particular from the European Council,\nthe European Parliament, and the European Commission,\ntheir take-up and implementation have historically been very\nlimited and concentrated to a few Nordic countries and\nAustria. Following European Commission's YG proposal in\nDecember 2012, the Council of the European Union adopted\nGuidelines inform the design and implementation of YGs\nin Member States encompass six key areas: (a) building up\npartnership-based approaches, (b) early intervention and\nactivation, (c) supportive measures enabling labor market\nintegration (including enhancing skills and labor market\u00ad\nrelated measures), (d) use of EU funds, (e) assessment and\ncontinuous improvement of the scheme, and (f) (prompt)\nimplementation of YG schemes.\nFollowing the above Recommendation and its endorse-\nment by the European Council in June 2013, Member States\nwith regions experiencing youth unemployment rates above\n25% were asked to develop and submit a National Youth\nGuarantee Implementation Plan (NYGIP) by the end of\n2013, with the remaining seven Member States having to\nsubmit one by March 2014. Despite this need for urgent\nimplementation of the YG, progress to date has been patchy.6\nDespite the positive experience with YGs in the Nordic\nand a few other countries, there is rather limited evidence on\ntheir long-term impact, which suggests that performance\nmonitoring and impact evaluation systems need to be\nenhanced substantially. Indeed, the need for more robust\nevaluation and impact assessment of YEI-related measures,\nnotably the YG, has also been recognized by the Commission\nthat considers the requirement for two YEI impact evalua-\ntions during a period of 9 years as a minimum requirement.\nTo this end, in March 2013, it put forward a list of relevant\nYEI and NEET-related indicators (immediate and longer\nterm result indicators broken down by gender) that must be\nused to assess the take-up and effectiveness of interventions\nsuch as the YG and be included in the annual implementation\nreports.\nEvidence suggests that the success rate of YG interven-\ntions is higher for new labor market entrants than for long-\nparticular relevance to addressing the needs of disadvantaged\ngroups of young people who may also face structural prob-\nlems. Indeed, as regards NEETs, existing evidence indicates\nthat YG schemes are more suitable for those who are closer\nto the labor market, while those who face multiple barriers\ncould not be engaged as effectively (Eurofound, 2012a,\n2012b). Current YGs are available only to young people reg-\nistered with the PES; they do not support unregistered job-\nless youth. Given the significant share of young people who\nfall out of the reach of employment services in many coun-\ntries, it would seem important to extend participation of these\nyoung people, including through flexible design and out-\nreach strategies.\nThe available funding can also be an issue because the\neffective implementation of YGs is resource intensive and\nrequires substantial public- or private-sector investment. The\nEU funds earmarked for the EU YG (e.g., the ESF itself and\nthe YEI's 6 billion) are seen as inadequate for its successful\nimplementation. For example, the ILO estimates that the EU\nrequires an injection of 21 billion which represents around\nGDP). As the 2012 Eurofound's ground-breaking study has\nshown, this should be seen against an estimated annual cost\nMoreover, PES must be able to ensure individual young\npeople receive appropriate advice on job, education, and\ntraining opportunities most relevant to their own situation.\nThe effectiveness of YGs is linked to the capacity of PES to\neffectively administer labor market measures and the capac-\nity to establish cooperative arrangements with other stake-\nholders, including youth organizations. Yet, the quality,\ncapacity, and reach of PES vary considerably between coun-\ntries and even regions within the same country. Indeed, in\nmany countries, the successful implementation of the YG\nwill require structural reforms such as the restructuring and\nrevamping of PES which must have the necessary capacity\nand professional staffing levels to ensure individual young\npeople receive appropriate advice on job, education, and\ntraining opportunities most relevant to their own needs.\nTraineeships and Apprenticeships\nFurther policy initiatives in 2014 included the Council of\nMinisters' adoption of the Quality Framework For\nTraineeships, based on several years of consultation (Council\nof the European Union, 2014). This is aimed at helping train-\nees acquire high-quality work experience under safe and fair\nconditions and to increase their chances of finding a good\nquality job. This was in response to the level of critique\ndirected at the quality of many employer-provided intern-\nships/traineeships (Lain et al., 2014). The YEP also\nannounced the European Alliance for Apprenticeships\n(EAfA), the aim of which is to improve the quality and sup-\nply of apprenticeships available by spreading successful\napprenticeship schemes across the EU and by bringing\ntogether all relevant stakeholders. Finally, the YEP stressed\nthe importance of EU-wide mobility for young people, for\nexample, through the \"Your First EURES Job\" initiative and\nthe Erasmus program.7 The YEP recognized the important\nrole that EU funds, notably the ESF, can play in supporting\nits youth employment measures. Specifically, the\nCommission's proposed ESF Regulation for the next pro-\ninvestment priority targeting the sustainable labor market\nintegration of young NEETs.\nThe extent to which these new initiatives can significantly\nchange the institutional trajectory of countries is currently in\na process of evaluation. But a notable difference, compared\nwith the 1980s, is that current levels of support are drawing\non significantly higher level of EU-wide structural invest-\n2004). Although this level of EU-wide-funded initiatives has\nbeen criticized for not being large enough, for example, by\nthe European Youth Forum, it also illustrates our fifth charac-\nteristic of how the issue of youth unemployment today differs\nfrom that of the 1980s in terms of the higher priority and\ninvestment this issue receives at EU level.\nDiscussion: Policy Initiatives and\nPerformance--What Works?\nMaking general statements about the likely effectiveness of\nparticular programs on youth unemployment is difficult\ngiven the variation of program design, national framework\nconditions, and target groups (Kluve et al., 2006). These\nproblems apply to EU initiatives and international compari-\nsons of the effectiveness of different schemes. Also, the\nscope of evaluation studies varies between programs and\ncountries and the various success indicators being used:\nThese can range from only a reduction of benefit recipients\nto sustainable integration into employment including the\nfocus on working conditions and wages. Traditionally, the\nbest way to guard against the risks of youth unemployment\nhas been educational attainment and qualifications. Cross-\ncountry comparisons show that countries maintaining a sub-\nstantial dual apprenticeship system, that is, Austria,\nDenmark, Germany, and Switzerland, exhibit a much\nsmoother transition from school to work, low NEET rates,\nand low youth unemployment than other countries\nBut youth labor market transitions only provide partial\nevidence on the relative performance of the training systems\nin the respective countries. A causal analysis is impeded by\nthe co-variation of other relevant institutional factors. Further\nproblems arise from the absence of a unified framework for\ndefining the respective training options and collecting data\non the costs and benefits experienced by the state, the firms,\nBesides limited data availability impeding the analysis of\nnet benefits of the respective training options, assessing the\nindividual benefit of participation within a country is com-\nplicated by several identification issues (Wolter & Ryan,\n2011), namely, first, identifying the relevant counterfactual\nsituations in the presence of occupation-specific labor mar-\nkets; second, non-random selection into the training options\nbased on unobservable characteristics; third, heterogeneous\noutcomes by field of training; and fourth, general equilib-\nrium effects.\nEvidence on the relative performance of vocational versus\ngeneral upper secondary and tertiary education is summa-\nrized by Ryan (2001) for France, the United Kingdom, and\nthe United States, and Russell and O'Connell (2001) for nine\nEuropean countries. These studies point to an increased\nemployment probability of participants in occupation-spe-\ncific training. However, evidence on wage differentials is\nmixed: In some cases for those with occupational-specific\ntraining, there are wage penalties; they receive similar wages\nor they even benefit from wage bonuses compared with those\nwith general skills or educational qualifications (Malamoud\nMost recently, Hanushek, Woessmann, and Zhang (2011)\nadopt a life cycle approach to analyzing employment differ-\nences of general and vocational schooling over the course of\nindividuals'working life. In line with previous findings, their\ndescriptive evidence points at a faster initial integration into\nthe labor market of vocational education participants, but a\nfaster decreasing labor market participation toward the end\nof their working life. This suggests that occupational-\nspecific knowledge dates faster and leads to lower employ-\nment opportunities later in life. But this of course depends on\nthe types of occupations and the changing demand for these\nskills in the labor market. More reliable evidence on the per-\nceived trade-off remains to be produced, as the causal inter-\npretation of these findings is impeded by occupation-specific\nsegregation of the labor market and the limited availability of\nlong-term panel data.\nGiven the available evidence of evaluation studies (Card,\nto conclude in general:\n1. Job search assistance and sanctioning have\npositive short-run effects on the termination of\nunemployment.\n2. Publicly sponsored training has positive medium run\neffects, particularly if delivered in high quality and\ntailored to the labor market needs of firms' skill\ndemands, which can be achieved by mobilizing\nemployers and local communities.\n3. Targeted and temporary hiring subsidies to employ-\ners are effective, but costly, and they tend to have sig-\nnificant side effects so that net employment gains are\nless clear-cut.\n4. Direct public job creation is most problematic in\npromoting transition to full-time permanent\nemployment.\n5. Start-up support has proven to be a quite effective\ninstrument at least for higher educated and motivated\nyouth.\nAccording to the meta-analysis by Card et al. (2010),\nmost Active Labor Market Policies schemes (ALMPs) tar-\ngeted toward young people seem less effective than schemes\ntargeting the unemployed in general. However, evidence\nhighlights the important role of early intervention in chang-\ning outcomes for those young people most at risk, both with\nrespect to activation at an early stage of unemployment\n(Martin & Grubb, 2001) and, most importantly, early in life\nIn many countries, participation in activation policies has\nbeen made compulsory after an initial period of receipt of\nsocial security along the principle of \"mutual obligations\"\neither stressing swift integration into work (\"work first\") or\ndemanding participation in training (\"train first\"), such as a\nthe \"YG.\" Integration into work via \"work first' tends to\nbring about short-run gains but is less effective than\nparticipation in training in the medium and long run (Card et\nal., 2010). Training measures and comprehensive programs\nwith a strong training element are most prominent in youth\nAccording to a recent Eurofound (2012a) study, success-\nful policies to address youth unemployment specify target\nand hard to reach groups; the young people involved con-\nsider the program to have a good reputation, and relevant\ncommunity groups are involved in the delivery of these pro-\ngrams. The effectiveness of these policies is based on the\nunderstanding of the range of minor and complex needs\naffecting labor market readiness of young people, as well as\nwell-trained support staff providing comprehensive holistic\nguidance with personalized advice to help them achieve\nlong-term sustainable pathways into work, \"rather than low-\nquality quick fixes\" (Eurofound, 2012a). Flexible responses\nadapted to the economic cycle together with inter-agency\ncollaboration, the buy-in of employers, and their representa-\ntives can provide \"cost-effective ways to implement poli-\ncies\" (Eurofound, 2012a). But these measures require\nsystematic and robust monitoring and evaluation if we are to\nknow what really works and why.\nConclusion\nYouth transitions to economic independence and adulthood\nare becoming increasingly more difficult and protracted. We\nhave argued that the distinguishing characteristics of con-\ntemporary youth labor markets reflect structural changes in\nemployment and increased demands for labor flexibility and\nchanging skill requirements, new patterns of migration,\npolarization created by family legacies, and increased policy\nintervention and investment by the EU. The nexus of transi-\ntions between skill attainment, labor market integration, and\neconomic independence for young people over future\ndecades will be critical on a number of dimensions.\nFirst, the lack of engagement in regular paid employment\ncan result in a vicious downward circle in terms of subjective\nsenses of recognition, value, and well-being. In economic\nterms, it affects long-term material accumulation and the\nopportunities this creates, either to live independently or to\nstart a family. Second, the consequences of differentiated tra-\njectories are socially divisive. Within countries as well as\nacross the EU, this creates elements of a polity that are highly\nskeptical of those who govern it to meet their needs; this\nexperience impacts on their values, aspirations, and attitudes.\nAnd third, at a very individual level, the consequences of the\nbarriers encountered by attempting to make the transition to\nindependent adulthood, through employment, housing, and\nfamily formation, will have an aggregate effect in relation to\ndemographic and fertility trends. For these three reasons, the\nconsequences of youth unemployment today will leave a\nlong-term legacy, and possibly a scar, for the future identity\nand opportunity for young Europeans, in different parts of\nEurope, and how they value the \"European Project\" and\nthose who are managing it.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research and/or authorship of this article: The research for\nthis article has received funding from the European Union's Seventh\nFramework Programme for research, technological development\nand demonstration under grant agreement no. 613256 (www.style-\nresearch.eu).\nNotes\n1.
