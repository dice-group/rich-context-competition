    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn this study, 901 participants completed an anonymous Internet-based survey, including a new instrument, the\nNeurotransmitter Attributes Questionnaire (NAQ), indicating possible dysfunction of the serotonergic or dopaminergic\ncircuits. NAQ items were derived from questions prescribing professionals commonly ask new patients whose symptoms\ncall for psychopharmacological treatments, sometimes in combination with psychosocial interventions. Rasch modeling was\nused to establish item quality, subscale reliability, and unidimensionality. In addition, the items in each subscale were found\nreliable when judged by three blind raters who were experienced psychopharmacologists. Standard measures of mental\ndisorders and self-reported diagnoses were used to validate the NAQ subscales. These questions that form the subscales\non the NAQ may be helpful when determining the class of medication likely to be most effective. Variations in mood and\nanxiety-disordered patients call for a case-specific approach to pharmacological treatment. Some patients are best helped by\nserotonergic agonists, others have a better outcome from treatment with dopaminergic agonists, and some patients seem\nto be best served by a combination of both. The NAQ was designed to aid decision-making early in treatment, potentially\nleading to greater compliance and better outcome. The NAQ may be used to standardize protocols in outcome research,\nand in addition, it may provide a new perspective on personality studies.\n",

Although DSM-III was an\nimprovement over preceding editions, the effort to standard-\nize diagnoses was less successful than hoped. The DSM-III,\nDSM-IV (4th ed, APA, 1994), including multiple revisions,\nand the recently released DSM-V describe categories of\nsymptom clusters; however, not all patients within a symp-\ntom-cluster share similar underlying pathophysiology\nFurthermore, diagnoses have remained somewhat unreliable\nacross locations, theoretical perspectives, and the era in\nwhich diagnosing is taking place (Aboraya, 2007).\nPatients sometimes do not \"fit\" in a clear diagnostic cat-\negory because they fail to demonstrate enough of the required\ncriteria. In addition, mental disorders overlap with one\nanother, with the same criterion found in different disorders.\nFor example, anxiety is present across many diagnostic cat-\negories, although it may differ in intensity and manifestation.\nPeople with mental illnesses often exhibit criteria from mul-\ntiple disorders, leading to diagnostic confusion. These limi-\ntations have made it difficult to diagnose in accord with the\nspecific illnesses in the DSM model.\nPersonality and Psychopathology: Recent\nDimensional Perspectives\nIn contrast to taxonomic models of psychopathology (exem-\nplified by the DSM tradition), an alternative tradition empha-\nsizes a dimensional understanding of common psychological\n1The Wright Institute, Berkeley, CA, USA\n2Samford University, Birmingham, AL, USA\n3University of California, San Francisco, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nLynn E.

Dimensional models highlight continuity between\npsychological disorders and highly prevalent, adaptive, bio-\nlogically based temperament and personality factors. Here,\nbehavioral, mood, and personality disorders are conceptual-\nized as spectrum disorders defined within multidimensional\nframeworks. Among more influential approaches in this tradi-\ntion are Eysenck's PEN (psychoticism, extraversion, and neu-\nroticism) perspective (1990), Cloninger's biosocial model of\npersonality (Cloninger, Bayon, & Svrakic, 1998; Cloninger &\naffective temperaments, and various models emphasizing con-\ntinuity between psychopathology and the Big Five personality\nfactors (Nigg, John, Blaskey, Huang-Pollock, Willcutt,\nAkiskal and colleagues (Lara & Akiskal, 2006; Lara,\nPinto, Akiskal, & Akiskal, 2006) recently developed an inte-\ngrative, bi-dimensional theory of temperament with implica-\ntions for the assessment and treatment of psychological\ndisorders. This model incorporates neurobiological evidence\nfor serotonergic and dopaminergic systems underlying nor-\nmal affective traits and their symptomatic exaggerations in\nmood and personality disorders.\nIn this bi-dimensional model, the fundamental human\naffective systems are posited to relate to fear and anger, evo-\nlutionary adaptations to the ubiquitous demands of detecting\nand responding to danger and environmental challenges.\nBroadly speaking, the fear system regulates the inhibition of\nbehavior, while the anger system promotes the initiation of\nbehavior. Each system is responsible for a set of transient\nemotional states and enduring temperamental traits. Fear\ntraits relate to harm avoidance, with high fear reflected in\ncautiousness, pessimism, need for security, and low energy.\nPersons low in fear exhibit optimism, confidence, high\nenergy, low perception of danger cues, and reckless risk-\ntaking. Lara and Akiskal (2006) provide evidence that fear\ntraits are linked primarily to amygdala functioning (with sec-\nondary involvement of other limbic and precortical and\nparalimbic structures) and to serotonergic systems (as well\nas gamma-aminobutyric acid [GABA] and noradrenergic\nsystems).\nIn contrast, anger relates to traits such as appetitive moti-\nvation, with high anger associated with novelty- and\nstimulation-seeking, impulsivity, extravagance, and domi-\nnance. Low anger is associated with apathy, passivity, sub-\nmissiveness, and low appetitive and exploratory motivation.\nLara and Akiskal (2006) identify the nucleus acumbens as\nthe primary neuroanatomical structure involved in the regu-\nlation of anger traits, with prefrontal cortical structures play-\ning secondary roles. Although the neurochemistry of anger is\ncomplex, the authors describe dopaminergic circuits involved\nin anger regulation. This model is reminiscent of Gray's the-\nory of Behavioral Inhibition Systems (BIS) and Behavioral\nActivation Systems (BAS), derived from research in animal\nand serotonergic circuits may play important roles in the\nBAS and BIS, respectively (Depue & Iacono, 1989).\nFear and anger traits, as conceptualized by Akiskal and\ncolleagues (Lara & Akiskal, 2006; Lara, Pinto, Akiskal, &\nAkiskal, 2006), are orthogonal dimensions, with high and\nlow fear and anger co-occurring in combination. Many psy-\nchological disorders are located within this two-dimensional\nframework, with disorders identified by extremes on at least\none dimension. Bipolar disorders are characterized by eleva-\ntion on anger- and fear-related traits. Without the modulation\nby high fear, an individual with high anger is prone to manic\nand hypomanic states, with less frequent depressive epi-\nsodes. Major depression is associated with high fear charac-\nteristics and low anger; with higher fear traits, depression\nmerges into the anxiety disorders. According to this model,\nADHD may be located at low levels on the fear and anger\ndimensions. However, the frequent comorbidity of ADHD\nwith anxiety, oppositional, and other disorders makes this\nhypothesis difficult to assess (Biederman, Faraone, & Lapey,\nbi-dimensional model is similar to the perspective adopted\nin the NAQ (Neurotransmitter Attributes Questionnaire)\nreported in the present study.\nA Dimensional Perspective in Clinical Practice\nMost frustrating to clinicians is the failure of diagnostic\ncategories to point the way to effective treatments. Despite\nhopes for standard psychopharmacological treatment,\nTrivedi, Rush, et al. (2006) report the results of the\nSTAR*D, a massive multisite study designed to assess the\noutcome of a standard psychopharmacological treatment\nfor depression. Depressed patients were treated with cital-\nopram (Celexa), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor\n(SSRI) often used as a first-line agent. Results demon-\nstrated that only 28% of the patients achieved remission\nand only 47% responded to an adequate trial of citalopram,\nunderlining the finding that many depressed patients fail to\nrespond to common first-line agents; more than half\nshowed no response, and more than two thirds failed to\nachieve remission. The utility of being able to identify\nwhich patients will respond to a given antidepressant agent\nbefore beginning treatment is evident. The low remission\nrate in the face of treatment with adequate serotonin reup-\ntake inhibition agonists suggests that other neurobiological\nsystems play a role in some or even many cases of depres-\nsion and associated symptoms such as anxiety. While\nagents most commonly used in first-line treatment of\ndepression rely on the selective blockade of serotonin\nreceptors, Nutt (2006) pointed to evidence linking dopa-\nmine and norepinephrine in depression and the role of\ndopamine in treatment. Primary dysfunctions of the dopa-\nmine circuits may account for subtypes of depression not\neffectively treated by serotonergic agents (Dunlop &\nDriven by the need to match specific patients to effective\ntreatments, many clinicians are moving away from the\nsymptom-cluster orientation of DSM-IV, which fails to\nO'Connor et al. 3\nidentify effective treatment agents. Instead, clinicians are\nattempting to correlate specific clinical data with underlying\npathophysiology, natural history, patterns of unique correlates,\nand treatment response, to arrive at treatment approaches\ndesigned to match hypothesized abnormalities in individual\nneural circuits and neurotransmitter systems (Stahl, 2000).\nThis approach takes into account not only the patient's symp-\ntoms, but also pre-morbid personality traits and past history\nof response to different pharmacological agents in an attempt\nto identify dysfunction in specific neurotransmitter systems\nthat might be redressed with pharmacological intervention.\nA medication trial may be viewed as a \"probe\" of a patient's\nindividually constituted nervous system; such trials can\ntherefore be diagnostic as well as therapeutic. We refer to\nthis model as \"circuits based,\" in contrast to the DSM\napproach, the \"symptom cluster\" model.\nThe disappointing results of outcome studies encouraged\nus to reconsider the neurobiological systems responsible for\ndysfunctions and to tailor treatments with a patient-specific\nmethod (Trivedi, Fava, et al., 2006). Experienced clinicians\ndevelop an implicit method of diagnosing and determining\noptimal treatment after observing multiple patients' person-\nality traits and their reactions to medications, using \"clinical\nintuition.\" However, this necessitates knowledge and under-\nstanding of psychopharmacology and in some settings, prac-\ntitioners may lack the background or relevant experience in\npsychopharmacology. Some treatment providers have not\nbeen trained to think of biological considerations linking\ntreatment to personality factors associated with psychopa-\nthology or sustained problems in living. In addition, while\nprimary care physicians are among the most frequent pre-\nscribers of antidepressant medications in the United States,\nthey often miss the diagnosis of major depressive disorder\n(Coyne, Fechner-Bates, & Schwenk, 1994). Thus, there is a\nneed for a secondary, systematized means by which to link\npersonality traits and clinical data to treatment approaches\nthat might help physicians make informed choices between\ndifferent types of antidepressant agents and psychosocial\napproaches. Such a method might also help direct the course\nof nonpharmacological treatment by making more explicit\nthe nature of the illness.\nA patient-specific method may ultimately include a vari-\nety of nonpharmacological treatments such as therapist-\ndesigned cognitive and behavioral treatment (CBT), self- or\ncomputer-administered CBT, telephone counseling, or\ngraded programs of exercise (Tylee, 2006). Because little\ndata exist regarding the effects of psychosocial treatments on\nspecific neurotransmitter circuits, there are no established\nprotocols linking nonmedication treatments with either sero-\ntonergic or dopaminergic system-based symptoms. Several\nexceptions to this include the efficacy of Exposure and\nResponse Prevention (ERP) in the treatment of obsessive-\ncompulsive disorder (OCD), and CBT in the treatment of\ndepression. In these, there have been studies comparing ERP\nand CBT with pharmacological treatment. In some studies\npsychosocial treatments appear more effective alone, in oth-\ners, a combination of medication and psychosocial treat-\nments lead to better outcome (Menchetti et al., 2010). Recent\noutcome data on ERP for OCD are not always so optimistic,\nand the lack of case specificity in medication practices\nhas lead to a pervasive weakness in clinical trial studies\n(Furukawa et al., 2011). In each study comparing psycho-\npharmacological with psychological treatments, all patients\nare given the same in class of pharmacological agent, with-\nout taking into account whether a given patient might be\nmore responsive to a serotonergic or dopaminergic agonist.\nEvery patient in the comparative studies receives the same\ntype of medicine. Therefore, outcome must necessarily be\nlower for medication treatments than it might be if patients\nwere treated with the medication most appropriate, in a case-\nspecific manner.\nIn longer-term studies, the learning process that takes\nplace in CBT appears to promote a greater reduction in\nsymptoms over time than medication without behavioral\ntreatment. However, for many, medications are helpful in\njump-starting treatment, offering patients enough hope to\nbegin the work of a CBT (Baxter et al., 1992; Conte, Plutchik,\nWild, & Karasu, 1986). Clinicians working with a circuits-\nbased model might consider patients' presenting symptoms\nas representing \"dysfunctional\" dopaminergic or serotonin-\nergic systems, while viewing neurotransmitters as function-\ning in nonlinear, complex, adaptive systems in continuous\ninteractions. A dopamine agonist may be most helpful for a\nsymptom suggestive of low dopaminergic tone, such as dis-\ntractibility or decreased motivation. A serotoninergic agonist\nmight better address a symptom suggestive low serotonergic\ntone, such as anxiety proneness or chronic sadness. In clini-\ncal contexts in which patients manifest relatively nonspecific\nsymptoms of depression but have evidenced lifelong person-\nality traits suggestive of, for example, low dopaminergic\ntone, clinicians may find dopaminergic agonists preferable,\nalthough serotonin circuits may secondarily be involved in a\npatient's presentation, and treatment may be most successful\nwhen using serotonergic and dopaminergic agonists. Beyond\nconsideration of psychopathology, normal personality traits\nand individual differences may be investigated and charac-\nterized by this model and fit into a broader evolutionary per-\nSolvason, Poirier, Kendrick, & Schatzberg, 2003; O'Connor,\nPresent Study\nCurrently there is a lack of effective measures to aid case-\nspecific approaches to pharmacological treatment that take\ninto account the individual differences in personality traits\noften informing decision making by experienced psycho-\npharmacologists. This study was designed to evaluate a new\nmeasure, the NAQ, based on a \"circuits\" model of psycho-\npathology, extended to include common psychological\n4 SAGE Open\nproblems and individual differences in personality traits. The\nNAQ was developed with an eye to potential clinical appli-\ncations, making explicit an implicit process for experienced\nprescribing providers. The items capture informal criteria\nused by seasoned specialists intuitively, in determining opti-\nmal treatment. NAQ items are related to behavioral, affec-\ntive, and cognitive traits on which people show individual\ndifferences, and for which extreme elevations on clusters of\ntraits (related to either serotonergic or dopaminergic influ-\nence) might be associated with distress, psychological prob-\nlems, or ongoing difficulties in living. Each of the two NAQ\nsubscales, the D-scale (dopaminergic) and S-scale (seroto-\nnergic), thus comprise these traits made explicit. While ele-\nvations on each classification of traits may not always be\nassociated with specific diagnoses, they commonly represent\nclusters of traits noted in patients successfully treated with\ndopamine agonists such as bupropion (Wellbutrin), methyl-\nphenidate (Ritalin), and others, or with serotonin agonists\nsuch as floxetine (Prozac), citalopram (Celexa), or escitalo-\npram (Lexapro). This study examines the psychometric\nproperties of the NAQ items and subscales, including their\nreliability and validity in distinguishing differences between\npatients who may have the same diagnosis but need different\ntreatments. In addition, we examine the relationship between\nthe NAQ subscales and normal and abnormal personality\ncharacteristics.\nMethod\nParticipants.This online study included 901 participants\nof mouth, or through emails posted on academic and other\nlistservs, as well as advertisements in the \"Volunteer\" sec-\ntion of the online craigslist in a variety of cities in the United\nStates. Participants were invited to our lab's (Emotion, Per-\nsonality, & Altruism Research Group) web page (http://\nwww.eparg.org) to the study \"Emotions and Personality.\"\nParticipation was anonymous. Participants' ages ranged\nmajority (about 89%) were from the United States. About\n80% were of European decent, 4.2% were Asian/Asian\nAmerican, 2.1% were Latin/Latin American, and 1.8% African/\nAfrican American. Education varied from high school or less\nattained an associates degree, 18.8% a bachelors degree, and\n18.1% a masters degree. An additional 20% had some under-\ngraduate education and 13.5% some graduate education. A\ntotal of 1% did not disclose their education level, and 2.3%\nindicated other educational achievements. Participants also\nindicated history of psychiatric diagnoses and current medi-\ncations (see Tables 1 and 2).\nInstruments. A variety of instruments were used to assess the\nvalidity of the two subscales of the NAQ (O'Connor, Lewis,\nBerry, Yi, & Crisostomo, 2005) including measures of\npsychopathology known to be associated with either low\ndopaminergic tone (i.e., often treated with a dopamine ago-\nnist) or low serotoninergic tone (i.e., often treated with a\nserotonin agonist). We also included measures of the Big\nFive personality factors, as a beginning exploration of per-\nsonality dimensions from the perspective of the circuit model\nof neurotransmitters.\nThe NAQ is a 46-item questionnaire with responses indi-\ncated on a Likert-type scale of 1 to 5. The instrument was\nderived from a list of questions generated by a psychiatrist,\nspecializing in psychopharmacology, which he typically\nasks before determining what medication(s) might be most\neffective, and to evaluate response to treatment. Item content\nvalidity was subsequently assessed by other practicing psy-\nchiatrists. The NAQ was piloted in a study at a major research\nuniversity, and then revised for clarity and reliability. The\nS-scale consists of 27 items, derived from the low-serotonin\nquestions, and the D-scale consists of 19 items from the low-\ndopamine questions. Procedures for generating items, evalu-\nating content validity, and assessing the psychometric\nfunctioning of item and scale characteristics are described in\ndetail below.\nThe Interpersonal Guilt Questionnaire-67 (IGQ-67;\nO'Connor, Berry, Weiss, Bush, & Sampson, 1997) is a\n67-item, self-report questionnaire, with responses indicated\non a Likert-type scale ranging from 1 to 5. The IGQ-67 was\nTable 1. Frequency of Self-Reported Diagnoses.\nSelf-reported diagnosis Frequency %\nTable 2.

The\nIGQ-67 subscales are significantly correlated with psycho-\npathology across cultures; the two subscales most signifi-\ncantly associated with psychopathology, Survivor Guilt, and\nOmnipotent Responsibility Guilt, were included in this\nstudy. Survivor guilt is characterized by the belief that pursu-\ning normal goals and achieving happiness or well-being will\ncause others, loved ones and strangers, to suffer. Omnipotent\nresponsibility guilt is characterized by the belief that one has\nomnipotent responsibility for the happiness and well-being\nof others.\nThe Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale\ninstrument, with responses on a Likert-type scale, ranging\nfrom 0 to 3, and total scores ranging from 0 to 60. The cut-off\nscore for depression is equal to or greater than 16, which\nindicates at least a mild depression, although many clinicians\nmark a mild depression starting well below 16.\nGeneralized Anxious Temperament (GAT; H. S. Akiskal,\nLikert-type scale from 1 to 5. Participants are asked to\ndescribe themselves \"through most of your life.\" Along with\na total GAT score, there are two subscales, the GAT-Self,\nwith items related to self-worry, and the GAT-Other, with\nitems reflecting worry about others. Theoretically, the GAT\nwas developed by placing anxious, worrying, temperaments\nin the context of evolutionary adaptations, in which members\nof the population who are high in this trait are those on the\noutlook for danger not only for themselves, but for the good\nof their families and groups.\nThe Jasper-Goldberg Adult ADD Screening Examination\nis a 24-item screening device, rated on a Likert-type scale\nfrom 0 (not at all) to 5 (very much), indicating how they have\nfelt \"most of your adult life.\" Scoring 70 or above is consid-\nered suggestive of an attention deficit disorder (ADD) diag-\nnosis. Most people who score at this level have been\neventually diagnosed with ADD although other psychiatric\nproblem such as bipolar disorder may be present and account\nfor the high score.\nThe Obsessive Compulsive Inventory-R is derived from\nthe Obsessive-Compulsive Symptoms Scale from the\nInternational Personality Item Pool (Foa, Kozak, Salkovskis,\nassesses perfectionism, intrusive thoughts, and the need for\norder and cleanliness.\nself-report inventory for assessing five personality traits:\nopenness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion,\nagreeableness, and neuroticism.\nProcedure. Participants volunteered anonymously, indicating\ninformed consent by clicking an appropriate button, before\nproceeding. Data entered our server through FileMaker Pro,\nwas transferred to Microsoft Excel, and then to SPSS for\nanalysis.\nData analysis strategy.An initial item pool for the NAQ\nscales was generated by a psychiatrist, specializing in psy-\nchopharmacology. Each item was classified as reflecting\ntraits associated with either serotonin or dopamine systems.\nTo assess content validity of the items in each subscale, judg-\nments were obtained from three other practicing psychia-\ntrists who frequently evaluate patients' probable responses to\nmedications (see below). Overall NAQ scale reliabilities,\nindividual-item performance, scale dimensionality, and\npotential item bias (by gender) were assessed using a Rasch\nmodel for rating scales (O'Connor et al., 2005). Convergent\nand discriminant validity were assessed using correlations\nwith standardized measures of psychopathology and person-\nality, and by comparisons of groups distinguished by self-\nreported psychiatric diagnoses.\nResults\nNAQ Content Validity Assessment\nThree independent psychiatrists rated each item of the NAQ\nitem pool on two separate Likert-type scales (from 1 = not at\nall to 5 = a great deal) indicating the degree to which items\nreflect characteristics associated with dopamine and sero-\ntonin systems. We assessed interrater agreement using intra-\nclass correlations (ICC) based on fixed effects analysis of\nvariance. The ICC for the serotonin ratings was .79 and for\nthe dopamine ratings was .81. Rater averages on each were\ncalculated. Items were then classified as either dopamine or\nserotonin-related, depending on the higher of the two scale\naverages. These classifications were then compared with the\ninitial classifications obtained from the psychiatrist who gen-\nerated the items. All but one item (\"I lose my temper easily\")\nobtained the same classification from the two sources. This\nambiguous item was removed from the item pool, leaving 19\nitems in the S-scale and 27 items in the D-scale. Items were\nsubsequently assessed for reliability and validity using data\nfrom the online sample.\nReliabilities and Item Analyses of NAQ scales\nTo assess psychometric characteristics of the S and D scales,\nwe fit the items of each to a rating scale extension of the\nRasch model (Andrich, 1978). The Rasch model for dichoto-\nmous items posits that any individual's score on a given item\nis a function of two parameters: a parameter representing the\ndifficulty (or endorsability) of the item, and a parameter rep-\nresenting the individual's standing on the latent construct\nbeing measured. The rating scale extension of the Rasch\nmodel also includes a threshold parameter for each response\ncategory in polytomous items. Item difficulties and person\nmeasures are on a common logit scale. In Rasch analysis,\nordinal raw scores (the sum of items in the scale) are\n6 SAGE Open\ntransformed into interval-level logit measures. For the D and\nS scales, we transformed the scales such that the lowest pos-\nsible raw score was associated with a Rasch measure of 0 and\nthe highest raw score was associated with a Rasch measure\nof 100. Rasch measures were used in all subsequent validity\nanalyses. (Tables for converting raw score sums to Rasch\ninterval measures are available on request from the authors.)\nTo assess overall scale characteristics, we examined item\nand person separation reliabilities. Item separation indicates\nthe degree to which items are sufficiently separated in dif-\nficulties to form a useful measurement continuum (values\ngreater than .90 are acceptable). Person separation indicates\nthe degree of error-free variability among respondents on\nthe measured construct. It is generally interpreted by the\nsame standards as Cronbach's alpha coefficient. The fit of\nindividual items to the Rasch model was assessed using\ninformation-weighted mean-square fit statistics. These fit\nstatistics have an expected value of 1. Items with fit statis-\ntics less than 1.5 contribute effectively to a measurement\nPsychometric functioning of the S-scale.For the 19-item\nS-scale, the Rasch item separation reliability was .99, indi-\ncating adequate spread of item difficulties. The person sepa-\nration reliability was .80 (.70 is a conventional cut-off). In\nTable 3, we present the item difficulty estimates and the\nmean-square fit statistics for each item of the S-scale. Items\nare displayed from highest to lowest item difficulties. Lower\nvalues of item difficulties indicate \"easier-to-endorse\" items.\nAll items fit the model successfully, with fit statistics rang-\nitem functioning (DIF) by gender. To test for DIF using\nRasch methods, items are calibrated separately for all sub-\ngroups (equated onto a common scale) and item difficulties\nare compared between subgroups (Draba, 1977). Gender dif-\nferences in item difficulties ranged from -.49 to .26 logits.\nDifferences of less than half a logit suggest no serious item\nbias for most testing situations (Wright & Douglas, 1975).\nPsychometric functioning of the D-scale. For the 27 items of\nthe D-scale, the item separation reliability was .99 and the\nperson separation reliability was .85. Table 4 displays the\nitem difficulty estimates and the mean-square fit statistics\nfor each item. Item fit statistics ranged from 0.79 to 1.53.\nWe also examined potential DIF by gender on the D-scale\nitems. Gender differences in item difficulties ranged from\n-.27 to .29 logits, suggesting no serious item bias by\ngender.\nAssociations of NAQ Scales With Psychopathology\nand Personality\nTable 5 presents correlations of the NAQ scales with con-\ntinuous measures of psychological symptoms and with per-\nsonality factors. Means and standard deviations for all scales\nare displayed. Among zero-order correlations, most were\nstatistically significant at the .001 level, and correlations\nwere moderately high except for Extraversion and Openness\nto Experience, which had meager correlations with both\nNAQ subscales. Figure 1 displays the correlations between\nNAQ scales and standardized measures of psychopathology.\nCorrelations were stronger with the S-scale for all measures\nTable 3.

Dunnett's post hoc tests\n(two-sided,  = .05) were used to compare each diagnostic\ngroup with the group that reported no diagnosis. For the\nD-scale, three diagnostic groups were significantly higher than\nthe no-diagnosis group: ADHD, depression, and bipolar.\nFigure 2 shows Cohen's d effect size estimates for the S-scale,\nbased on the mean and standard deviation of the no-diagnosis\ngroup. For the S-scale, the depression, anxiety, bipolar and\nOCD groups were significantly higher than the no-diagnosis\ngroup. All of these diagnostic groups had effect sizes greater\nthan .50--at least half a standard deviation above the mean of\nthe no-diagnosis group. Only the OCD and bipolar groups had\neffect sizes greater than 1.0. For the D-scale, three diagnostic\ngroups were significantly higher than the no-diagnosis group,\nADHD, depression, and bipolar disorder. Figure 3 presents\neffect sizes for the diagnostic groups on the D-scale. Only the\nADHD group had an effect size greater than 1.0, with the bipo-\nlar group approaching this level.\nDiscussion\nThis study supports the psychometric strength of a new clini-\ncal screening tool and demonstrates the potential value of\nposing questions captured in the NAQ when physicians are\nprescribing medications for patients presenting with psycho-\nlogical problems. While these complaints may be regarded as\nunusual, idiosyncratic, or even disagreeable personality vari-\nations rather than signs of discrete disorders, they may be\ntreatable by psychotropic medications or psychosocial strate-\ngies. The NAQ subscales appear to confirm common clinical\nobservations; disorders known to be treated best with particu-\nlar medications are found to be elevated on subscales as\nwould be predicted. For example, subjects who score high on\na well-used screening measure of attention deficit and hyper-\nactivity disorder also show evidence of dysfunction on the\nFigure 1.

Likewise, patients who demonstrate elevations in a\nscreening tool for OCD appear to have greater dysfunction in\nthe serotonergic circuit, corresponding to the well-known\nefficacy of serotonergic medications in the treatment of OCD.\nThese findings most succinctly validate the subscales of the\nNAQ. In depression, data from the NAQ suggests that the\ndisorder may represent dysfunction of either or both circuits,\nand this too corresponds to the experience of psychopharma-\ncologists and other physicians treating depression. This\nincludes internists and other nonpsychiatric specialists along\nwith prescribing treatment providers with other licenses, such\nas supervised nurse practitioners and physician assistants.\nPsychiatric lore suggests that depressed women respond\nto monotherapy with a serotonin agonist more often than do\nmen. The NAQ subscales contribute to a growing body of\nevidence confirming the psychiatric impression that women\nand men differ in their predisposition to serotonin-associated\npsychiatric disorders (Jovanovic et al., 2006). The results of\nthis study demonstrate that many depressed men may suffer\nfrom a dopaminergic and serotonergic dysfunction, while\nwomen are more likely to be experiencing a serotonergic\nproblem. Subtleties found by the NAQ support the com-\nmonly held experience that individual differences may be\nimportant in the treatment of depression and the questions\ncommonly asked by specialists in psychopharmacology\nshould be moved into the internist's office. All patients may\nneed a case-specific approach to effective treatment design.\nThe effective use of a neurotransmitter-focused screening\nand assessment tool before deciding on specific psychopharma-\ncological treatments and even, perhaps, behavioral treatment is\none of the recommendations suggested by this study, warrant-\ning future research. Assessing a patient's serotonergic and\ndopaminergic tone using the NAQ might allow clinicians treat-\ning depression and anxiety disorders--often confusing and\nintermixed in presentation--to better predict the medication\nmost likely to be effective, that is, a serotonergic agonist such as\nFigure 3. D-scale score effect size estimates for diagnostic\ngroups relative to group reporting no diagnosis.\ncitalopram (Celexa) or a dopaminergic agonist such as bupro-\npion (Wellbutrin), or in some cases both. Assessing patients and\ntailoring medication approaches before treatment might yield\nimproved compliance and subsequence remission rates, partic-\nularly when the first agent or agents used are effective. When\ninitial trials fail to provide relief from symptoms, patients are\nlikely to drop out of treatment, instead of hanging in while the\nprescribing professional initiates second or third trials.\nThe potential research applications in social cognitive\nneuroscience and psychopathology might increase our\nunderstanding of the mechanisms underlying many psycho-\nlogical problems. In addition, current clinical trials compar-\ning medication and psychotherapy only become specific in\nterms of what kind of psychotherapy is used in a study. So for\nexample, a CBT for depression is compared with a pharma-\ncological treatment. However, all patients in such a study are\ntreated with one medication, most often a SSRI, a serotonin\nagonist, helpful for the depressed person who suffers from\npoor serotonergic tone. However, the medication may fail to\nhelp the patient who needs a dopaminergic agonist. The lack\nof case-specificity in psychopharmacological agents used in\nstudies comparing CBT with treatment with medication for\ndepression may be producing erroneous results. Studies\ncomparing psychotherapy with medication might yield an\nentirely different picture, if the appropriate class of medica-\ntion were used for each patient in a case-specific manner\nWhile beginning with clinical observations, we suggest\nthat the circuit model of psychopathology extends to normal\npersonality within an evolutionary framework. The circuit\nmodel might provide personality researchers with new\ninsights into fundamental biological systems that underlie\nmany commonplace individual differences. For example, it\nwould be reasonable to expect that many underachieving\nindividuals, who seemingly fail to pursue socially valued\ngoals, might be characterized as having low levels of appeti-\ntive motivation, assertiveness, and reward dependence, that\nis, traits linked to dopaminergic systems. This initial expec-\ntation, however, might be unjustified in some cases. In previ-\nous research, submissive behavior, low social ranking, and\ndepressive symptomatology have been linked to elevated\nlevels of empathy-based survivor guilt (O'Connor, Berry,\nIn the present study, survivor guilt (and the closely related\nomnipotent responsibility, also based on empathy) was more\nstrongly correlated with the S-scale of the NAQ than with the\nD-scale. One implication of these results is that what might\nappear at first to be low dominance and achievement motiva-\ntion (low anger/BAS) might instead be a consequence of\nfearful, anxious, and inhibitory traits (high fear/BIS) related\nto concerns about the safety and well-being of others (H. S.\nThere are obvious limitations to this study. To date, it is\nstill impossible to provide direct biological evidence linking\nthe hypothesis that subscales of the NAQ are associated with\ndysfunctions in dopaminergic or serotonergic circuits. We\nare still unable to measure brain levels of serotonin or dopa-\nmine, from blood or urine samples. Furthermore, even if\nsuch a technological advance were to be made, and it became\neasy to empirically measure these neurotransmitters, it is not\nclear that direct correlations between dysfunctions in the\ndopaminergic or serotonergic circuits and personality traits\nassociated with particular disorders would necessarily cor-\nrelate with overall levels of the respective neurotransmitter\nlevels. There are also differences in the manner in which\nbrain circuits respond in terms of their regulation in various\npsychiatric disorders and in different parts of the brain.\nTherefore, the knowledge of measured neurotransmitter lev-\nels might be of limited use in linking clinical data and per-\nsonality traits to the treatment plans. Furthermore,\nassessments are based on self-reports, which might have\nresulted in bias due to shared method variance. These issues\nmust be considered in future research before further conclu-\nsions can be drawn about the clinical validity and utility of\nthe NAQ.\nThe development and validation of the NAQ is a good\nfirst step in trying to provide a systematic measure that links\npersonality traits and clinical data to pharmacological treat-\nment approaches. With few exceptions, scholars, clinicians,\nand researchers fail to link personality and temperament\ntraits with psychiatric treatment and there has largely been an\nabsence of efforts to point out obvious connections. The\nNAQ attempts to fill that void with a relatively accessible\ninstrument needed at least until there are more sophisticated\nmethods by which to determine biological indicators of spe-\ncific dysfunction of neurotransmitter circuits. Future research\nin clinical populations may find the NAQ useful to prescrib-\ning treatment providers in making medication decisions. If\nprescribers are more quickly and reliably able to determine\nthe medications most likely to be successful in providing\nrelief from symptoms by even a few weeks, there will inevi-\ntably be better patient compliance and treatment outcome.\nThe subscales of the NAQ may be used to improve the valid-\nity of outcome studies. Instead of using the same medication\nfor all depressed patients in an outcome study comparing\npsychopharmacological with cognitive behavioral and/or\nother psychosocial treatments, classes of medications might\nbe selected on a case-specific basis. In this era of evidence-\nbased medicine, the use of instruments designed to consider\nindividuals in a case-specific manner is increasingly called\nfor, and the NAQ is a step in that direction.\n"
