This study examines the association between dietary intake of\nfolate and the subsequent risk of stroke and CVD.\nMethods--Study participants included 9764 US men and women aged 25 to 74 years who participated in the National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study (NHEFS) and were free of CVD at baseline.\nDietary intake of folate was assessed at baseline using a 24-hour dietary recall and calculated using ESHA software.\nIncidence data for stroke and CVD were obtained from medical records and death certificates.\nResults--Over an average of 19 years of follow-up, 926 incident stroke events and 3758 incident CVD events were\ndietary folate intake (median, 405.0 g/day) compared with those in the lowest quartile (median, 99.0 g/day), after\nadjustment for established cardiovascular risk factors and dietary factors.\nConclusions--Our findings indicate an inverse relationship between dietary intake of folate and subsequent risk of stroke\nand CVD. Increasing dietary intake of folate from food sources may be an important approach to the prevention of CVD\nKey Words: cardiovascular disease  cerebrovascular disorders  diet  folic acid  prospective studies\nAs early as 1969, homocysteine was hypothesized to\naffect atherosclerotic processes.1 Since that time, sub-\nstantial evidence has accumulated linking homocysteine in\nplasma and serum to the risk of cardiovascular diseases.2\u00ad5\nFolate and cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12\n) are important reg-\nulators of the metabolism of homocysteine in the body, and\nstudies have shown an inverse relationship between levels of\nthese factors and levels of homocysteine in the blood.6\u00ad8 In\naddition, randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that\nfolate supplementation reduces blood levels of\nEpidemiological studies have also identified an inverse\nrelationship between blood concentrations of folate and\ncardiovascular disease end points, including stroke.11\u00ad13 How-\never, few studies have prospectively examined the relation-\nship between dietary intake of folate and the risk of cardio-\nvascular diseases.14 To our knowledge, no previous\nprospective study has reported a significant relationship\nbetween dietary intake of folate and the risk of stroke.\nThe importance of examining the relationship between\ndietary intake of folate and risk of cardiovascular disease is\nunderscored by the recent mandate for fortification of grain and\ncereal products with folate and recommendations to further increase\nlevels.15\u00ad17 Therefore, we took advantage of the large sample size\nand prolonged follow-up experience of participants in the\nNHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study (NHEFS) to examine\nthe relationship of dietary folate intake to subsequent risk of\ncardiovascular disease in a nationally representative sample of the\nUS noninstitutionalized population.\nSubjects and Methods\nStudy Population\nThe first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES I) used a multistage, stratified, probability sampling\ndesign to select a representative sample of the US civilian noninsti-\nsubgroups, including those with a low income, women of childbear-\ning age (25 to 44 years), and elderly persons (65 years or older), were\noversampled.

Each unique food was\nmatched to a corresponding food item listed in the ESHA Food Processor\nnutrient database by name and available nutrient content from NHANES I\ndocumentation.20 Participants' dietary intake of folate (g/24 h), saturated\nfat (g/24 h), and total energy (kcal/24 h) were calculated. A reliability\nanalysis was conducted to evaluate correspondence between NHANES I\nand ESHA nutrient databases. Intraclass correlation coefficients for nutrient\nintakes derived using NHANES I and ESHA food composition databases\nranged from 0.85 to 0.98, whereas graphical methods also demonstrated\ngood agreement for most nutrients (data not shown). Blood pressure, body\nweight, and height were obtained using standard protocols.18 Frozen sera\nwere sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for measure-\nment of serum total cholesterol levels. The baseline questionnaire on\nmedical history included questions about selected health conditions and\nmedications used for these conditions during the preceding 6 months. Data\non education, physical activity, and alcohol consumption were obtained by\nmeans of interviewer-administered questionnaires. Information on smoking\nstatus was obtained in 6913 participants who underwent a more detailed\nbaseline examination.18,19 For the remaining study participants, information\non smoking status at baseline was derived from responses to questions on\nlifetime smoking history obtained at their follow-up interviews between\nFollow-Up Procedures\nipant or his/her proxy to a current address; performing an in-depth\ninterview; obtaining hospital and nursing home records, including pathol-\nogy reports and electrocardiograms; and, for decedents, acquiring a death\ncertificate. Incident stroke and cardiovascular disease events were based on\ndocumentation of an event that met prespecified diagnostic criteria and\noccurred during the period between the participant's baseline examination\nand last follow-up interview. Validity of study outcome data has been\nIncident stroke was based on a death certificate report in which the\nunderlying cause of death was recorded with an International Classification\nof Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) code of 430 to 438 or on one or more\nhospital and/or nursing home stays in which the participant had a discharge\ndiagnosis with the above codes. Incident cardiovascular disease was based\non a death certificate report in which the underlying cause of death was\nand/or nursing home stays in which the participant had a discharge\ndiagnosis with the above codes. The date of record for incident events was\nidentified by the date of first hospital admission with an established study\nevent or date of death from a study event in the absence of hospital or\nnursing home documentation.\nStatistical Analysis\nDietary folate intake was modeled as a categorical (quartile groups) variable\nin primary analyses and modeled continuously in additional analyses. In\ncontinuous analyses, dietary folate intake was log transformed because of\nright skew. The distribution of each baseline characteristic was calculated by\nquartile of dietary folate intake (mean or percent of study participants). The\nstatistical significance of differences was examined by analysis of variance\n(continuous variables) and by the 2 test (categorical variables). Trend tests\nwere conducted using orthogonal coefficients. The cumulative incidence of\ncardiovascular disease by quartile of dietary folate intake was calculated\nusing the Kaplan-Meier method,28 and differences in cumulative rates were\nexamined by the log-rank test for trend.29 The adjusted relationship between\ndietary intake of folate and risk of cardiovascular disease was modeled using\nCox regression analysis.30 Cox proportional hazard models were stratified\nby birth cohort using 10-year intervals to control for calendar period and\ncohort effects.31 Age was used as the time-scale in all time-to-event\nanalyses.31 Methods to estimate variance that take into account sample\nclustering and stratification of the NHANES I sample were used in the Cox\nproportional hazards models.31 Because few participants remained and the\nall-cause mortality was disproportionately high after age 85 years, all\nanalyses were truncated at this age.\nResults\nIn this cohort, the median folate intake was 203.7 g per day with\nan interquartile range of 164.6 g per day. Compared with those\nwith a lower intake, participants with a higher dietary folate intake\ntended to be male and white (Table 1). Participants with a higher\nintake of folate had, on average, a slightly lower systolic blood\npressure and serum total cholesterol than those with a lower dietary\nfolate intake. Hypertension and hypercholesterolemia appeared less\noften, on the whole, in participants with a higher folate intake\ncompared with those with a lower intake. In addition, participants\nwho consumed higher levels of folate tended to perform more\nrecreational physical activity than their counterparts who consumed\nlower levels of folate in their diet. Participants in the lowest quartile\nof folate intake had a higher body mass index than those in the\nupper 3 quartiles. They were also less likely to have completed high\nschool, be consuming alcohol regularly, and be using a vitamin\nsupplement; however, cigarette smoking did not differ across\nquartile of dietary folate intake. Energy and saturated fat intakes\ntended to be higher with progressively higher intake of dietary\nfolate.\nwere documented. Cumulative hazard of stroke by quartile of\ndietary folate intake is presented in the Figure. The cumulative\nhazard of stroke at age 85 years from the lowest to highest quartile\n(P0.02 for trend). The cumulative hazard of cardiovascular\ndisease did not clearly separate by quartile of dietary folate intake in\nKaplan-Meier plots.\nRelative risks (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals\n(CI) for incidence of stroke and cardiovascular disease by quartile of\ndietary folate intake are presented in Table 2. In age-, race-, sex-,\nand energy-adjusted analyses, the risk of cardiovascular diseases\nwas significantly and inversely related to quartile of dietary folate\nintake at baseline (P value for trend0.03), whereas the risk of\nstroke was inversely related to quartile of dietary folate intake with\nborderline significance (P value for trend0.09). After further\nadjustment for history of diabetes, systolic blood pressure, serum\ncholesterol, body mass index, recreational physical activity, level of\neducation, regular alcohol consumption, and current cigarette smok-\ning, dietary folate intake was significantly and inversely related to\nthe subsequent risk of stroke and cardiovascular disease.

For instance, an increase\nin the log of folate intake representing the interquartile range was\nimportant cardiovascular disease risk factors.\nThe inverse associations between dietary intake of folate and\nincidence of stroke and cardiovascular diseases seemed consistent\nacross genders, levels of physical activity, and tobacco use. For\nexample, the risk of stroke among women in the highest quartile of\nthat of women in the lowest quartile, whereas the corresponding\nsmokers, the relative risk of stroke for the comparison of extreme\nrisk for the comparison of extreme quartiles were similar for\nparticipants with low levels of recreational physical activity and\nassociation between dietary folate intake and cardiovascular disease\nwere also comparable in groups based on gender, physical activity,\nand tobacco use (data not shown).\nDiscussion\nThis prospective study documents the presence of an independent\nand inverse relationship between dietary folate intake and risk of\nstroke and cardiovascular diseases in adults. Stroke is the third\nleading cause of death and the most common basis for long-term\ndisability in the US general population.32 Given the high mortality\nand cost of treatment of stroke and other cardiovascular disease,\nprimary prevention should be a central goal of plans aimed at\nreducing its societal burden. The findings from this study suggest\nthat a higher intake of folate may be associated with a lower risk of\nTABLE 1.

A meta-analysis of 29 epidemi-\nological studies indicates that elevated levels of homocysteine are\nrelated to stroke and cardiovascular disease.33,34 In addition, dietary\nfolate intake has been inversely related to plasma levels of total\nhomocysteine in several epidemiological studies.6\u00ad10,33 At least 1\nprospective study has suggested the presence of an inverse associ-\nation between risk of stroke and serum concentrations of folate in a\nseparate random subsample of 2006 participants in the NHEFS who\nunderwent a detailed physical examination.11 The latter study\nsuffered from a small sample size and few events (98 strokes),\nwhich may have contributed to the lack of statistical significance in\nmost findings. This study extends those results by examining the\nassociation between dietary folate and the risk of stroke and\ncardiovascular disease in a much larger sample.\nFew data are currently available regarding the effect of dietary\nfolate on risk of cardiovascular disease. In 1998, Rimm et al14\nidentified a significant inverse relationship between dietary intake of\nfolate from foods and supplements and subsequent risk of coronary\nheart disease in a cohort of US nurses. That study did not report an\nassociation between dietary folate and risk of stroke or the com-\nbined outcome of cardiovascular disease and was conducted in a\nselect, highly educated, female population that may have different\ndietary characteristics than the US general population. Mean folate\nintake in that study was 366 g/day, well above the national\naverage of 224 g/day.14 Our study is conducted in a representative\nsample of the noninstitutionalized US population, therefore our\nfindings are highly generalizable.\nFolate supplementation reduces blood levels of homocysteine,\nwhich many believe to be an important risk factor for cardiovascular\ndisease. The mechanism by which homocysteine may increase risk\nof stroke and cardiovascular diseases remains unclear.35 Homocys-\nteine may promote atherogenesis by damaging the vascular matrix,\nincreasing proliferation of endothelial cells, and facilitating oxida-\ntive injury of vascular walls.36,37 In addition, homocysteine may\nincrease coagulation and disturb endothelium-dependent vasomotor\nregulation.36 To date, most experimental studies have involved\nextreme concentrations of homocysteine not present in the general\npopulation; therefore, the results of these studies may have limited\nrelevance.37 In addition to regulation of homocysteine, folate itself\nmay have vasculoprotective effects.38 A recent randomized trial\ndemonstrated that supplementation with folic acid and vitamin B6\nTABLE 2.

To\nreduce the impact of such \"healthy habits,\" the estimates of risk in\nour study were adjusted for important potential confounders of\ncardiovascular disease like age, race, sex, education level, recre-\national physical activity, cigarette smoking, diabetic status, regular\nalcohol consumption, and total energy intake. When vitamin sup-\nplement use, often considered an indicator of a \"healthy lifestyle,\"\nwas added to multivariate models, risk estimates did not change. In\nmultivariate models adjusted for established cardiovascular disease\nrisk factors and vitamin supplement use, the relative risks of stroke\nand cardiovascular disease for the comparison of extreme quartiles\nrespectively. When any aspirin use in the past 30 days was added to\nmodels in addition to established cardiovascular risk factors, the\nrelative risks of stroke and cardiovascular disease in extreme\ntrend0.004), respectively. Moreover, it is reassuring that when the\nstudy population was examined by subgroups based on gender,\ntobacco use, and physical activity, the inverse association between\ndietary intake of folate and risk of stroke was consistent in both\ndirection and magnitude.\nThe present study has several limitations. One limitation of this\nstudy is the estimation of dietary folate intake using a single 24-hour\ndietary recall. Because of day-to-day variability in participants' food\nintakes, estimates from a single day of intake may not be represen-\ntative of participants' usual, long-term intake and so may result in\nmisclassification of usual folate consumption at the individual\nlevel.40\u00ad42 However, such random errors of measurement in folate\nintake would tend to bias any observed association toward the null\nrather than create a spurious association. Second, information on\nfolic acid supplementation from multivitamin use was not collected\nin the NHANES I study. Therefore, folic acid supplements could\nnot be taken into account in the analysis. Although approximately\n30% of our sample reported the regular or irregular use of any type\nof vitamin supplement during their baseline examination (1971 to\nmins that may have contained folate, and they were equally\ndistributed across levels of dietary folate intake. During the early\n1970s when this data were collected, the folate content of vitamin\nsupplements was restricted to 100 g in a single day's preparation\navailable without prescription.43 Thus vitamin supplements may not\nhave been a significant source of folate in this sample and so may\nnot confound the relationship we observed. Third, folate intake was\ncalculated using a current nutrient database that might overestimate\nfolate intake over the whole study population because of changes in\nthe folate content of foods. This may not affect the rank of dietary\nfolate intake for each individual in the study population and thus not\nbias our finding of an inverse association between dietary folate\nintake and risk of stroke. In addition, some NHANES I participants\nmay have underreported their dietary energy intake.44,45 However,\nadjustment for energy intake in our analyses may have reduced the\npotential impact of such underreporting.\nThis study maintained several strengths. Foremost, this study was\nconducted in a nationally representative sample of the noninstitu-\ntionalized US population; therefore these findings are broadly\ngeneralizable. In addition, temporal relationships can be established\nwith confidence because intake of folate was estimated from dietary\ninformation collected at baseline. Further, assessment of the inci-\ndence of cardiovascular diseases occurred over an average of 19\nyears of follow-up, and more than 96% of the study participants\nIn conclusion, these findings indicate that dietary intake of folate\nfrom food sources is independently and inversely related to the risk\nof stroke and cardiovascular disease in a representative sample of\nthe noninstitutionalized US population. Folate intake has been\ninversely related to homocysteine levels, an important risk factor for\nstroke and cardiovascular disease. Food fortification of folic acid\nfortification of 140 g of synthetic folic acid per 100 g of enriched\ngrain product was used to provide an additional 80 to 100 g of\nfolic acid per day to the diet of women of childbearing age and 70\nto 120 g to the diet of middle-aged and older adults. Assuming a\ncausal and linear association between dietary folate intake and\nstroke risk, an increase of 95 g/day in the diet of middle-aged and\nolder adults would be consistent with an approximate 12% reduc-\ntion in stroke risk over 20 years based on our data. Given these\nresults, increasing intake of folate from foods may be an important\nelement in dietary interventions to reduce the incidence of stroke\nand cardiovascular diseases. As in all observational epidemiological\nstudies, imperfect measurement of confounding variables and un-\nmeasured potential confounders may bias study findings. Further\nstudies designed to examine the relationship of dietary folate intake\nand risk of stroke and cardiovascular diseases are needed to shed\nlight on this important public health issue.\n"
