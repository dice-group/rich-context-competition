The NHANES III\nrecorded subjects older than 90 years as being 90 years\nold. Participants were excluded if there were missing\ndata on variables judged to be potential predictors of\ngallbladder disease or if outcome data on gallbladder dis-\nease were unavailable. We also excluded as potentially\nunreliable historians an additional 4 participants who\nreported consuming more than 30 alcoholic beverages\ndaily. Finally, 21 participants with extremely high serum\nascorbic acid levels (170 \u00b5mol/L) were excluded\nbecause such values were of questionable validity.12 Par-\nticipants excluded because of missing data were com-\npared with those analyzed; both groups were similar\ndemographically regarding age and sex, but excluded\nparticipants were more likely to have attained a lower\nlevel of education and to be nonwhite.\nMEASUREMENTS\nThe NHANES III questionnaire data included self-\nreported age; race (categorized as white, black, or\nother); sex; years of education completed; level of\nleisure-time physical activity; history of smoking; diabe-\ntes mellitus; level of alcohol intake; menopausal status;\nuse of diuretic, cholesterol-lowering, and estrogen-\ncontaining medications; and dietary intake.11 Quantita-\ntive nutrition data were collected by means of a 24-hour\ndietary recall. We calculated body mass index (BMI; in\nkilograms per meters squared) from weight and height\ndata recorded during the physical examination. The\nquestionnaires, dietary methods, and examination proce-\ndures used in NHANES III have been described else-\nWe ascertained whether participants had a history\nof clinical gallbladder disease by a positive response to\neither of the following questions: \"Has a doctor ever told\nyou that you had gallstones?\" and \"Have you ever had\ngallbladder surgery?\"11 Both questions appeared twice in\nthe NHANES III questionnaire; we used the response to\nthe initial question for these analyses because of the\ngreater number of responses. Participants who had gall-\nstones on abdominal ultrasound examination, but\nreported no history of clinical gallbladder disease and\nalso denied a history of right-upper-quadrant or epigas-\ntric abdominal pain lasting 1 hour or longer, were con-\nsidered to have asymptomatic gallstones. Among the\n13 130 participants in our sample, a real-time abdominal\nultrasound examination with valid results was per-\nby means of a standard protocol.11 After exclusion of\nparticipants with known clinical gallbladder disease\n(n = 850) and with symptoms compatible with undiag-\nparticipants available for the analysis of the relationship\nof serum ascorbic acid level to asymptomatic gallstones.\nSerum ascorbic acid and serum vitamin E (-\ntocopherol) levels were measured at the Centers for Dis-\nease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Ga, by isocratic high-\nperformance liquid chromatography.13 Ascorbic acid levels\nranged from 0.0 \u00b5mol/L to the upper cutoff point of 170\n\u00b5mol/L. Measurements of total and high-density lipopro-\ntein cholesterol were performed by means of standardized\nWe examined the distribution of ascorbic acid levels and\nother variables of interest using sample weights. We used\nage-adjusted and multivariable logistic regression to\nexamine the associations of ascorbic acid level and other\nvariables to the prevalence of clinical gallbladder disease\nand asymptomatic gallstones. Level of physical activity\nwas analyzed as an ordinal variable. Because we detected a\nsignificant nonlinear relationship between age and gall-\nbladder disease, and to improve the fit of the models, age\nadjustment was performed with the use of linear and qua-\ndratic terms for age. Multivariate models controlled for\nthe effects of age, race, level of education, physical activ-\nity, BMI, diabetes mellitus, use of diuretic and lipid-\nlowering medications, cigarette smoking, alcohol con-\nsumption, total serum cholesterol and high-density\nlipoprotein cholesterol levels, serum vitamin E level, and\ndietary intake of energy, fat, and fiber. For female partici-\npants, the multivariate models also controlled for the\neffects of oral contraceptive use, estrogen replacement\ntherapy, history of pregnancy, number of live births, and\nmenopausal status. Variables included in the multivariate\nmodels have been reported, in at least some studies, to be\nassociated with gallbladder disease.14 Serum vitamin E\nwas included in the multivariate models because it is an\nimportant lipid-soluble antioxidant nutrient often corre-\nlated with ascorbic acid intake. We tested for nonlinear\nrelationships by including both linear and quadratic terms\nfor serum ascorbic acid in the models.\nAnalyses were performed with Stata software that in-\ncluded commands for the analysis of complex survey data.15\nFor each predictor variable, we calculated an odds ratio (OR)\nand 95% confidence interval (CI). Because the probability\nof clinical and asymptomatic gallbladder disease in NHANES\nIII is low, the ORs approximate the relative prevalence of\ndisease. We considered 2-tailed P values of less than .05 to\nbe statistically significant.\nFigures examining the independent association\nbetween serum ascorbic acid level and gallbladder dis-\nease outcomes plotted the predicted prevalence of clini-\ncal gallbladder disease and asymptomatic gallstones as a\nfunction of serum ascorbic acid level based on the multi-\nvariate models. For the figures, logistic coefficients were\nused to compute individual predicted probability of each\noutcome. These probabilities within each 0.06-\u00b5mol/L\nserum ascorbic acid concentration were then smoothed\ntwice by means of a locally weighted symmetric nearest-\nneighbor linear smoother16,17 that allows for the use of\n\u00a92000 American Medical Association.

Age-\nadjusted models demonstrated that serum ascorbic\nacid levels were inversely associated with clinical and\nasymptomatic gallbladder disease; each SD (27\n\u00b5mol/L) increase in serum ascorbic acid level was\nassociated with an approximately 23% lower preva-\nlence of clinical gallbladder disease and a 22% lower\nprevalence of asymptomatic gallstones (both P.001).\nFurther adjustment for potential confounders includ-\ning race, BMI, diabetes, diet, menopausal status, use of\nestrogen-containing and lipid-lowering medications,\nand other variables attenuated these associations; an\nSD increase in serum ascorbic acid levels was indepen-\ndently associated with an approximately 13% lower\nprevalence of clinical gallbladder disease (P = .006)\nand asymptomatic gallstones (P = .048) (Table 2,\nFigure 1, and Figure 2).

When com-\npared with women in the lowest serum ascorbic acid\nquartile, multivariate analyses showed that women in the\nhighest quartile had a lower prevalence of clinical gall-\nP = .06). In similar comparisons, men in the highest se-\nrum ascorbic acid quartile, however, did not have a sig-\nnificantly lower prevalence of either clinical gallbladder\nwhen compared with men in the lowest quartile.\nWe explored factors that might confound the rela-\ntionship between serum ascorbic acid and gallbladder dis-\nease by examining the effect of potential confounders\nwhen added singly to age-adjusted models. Among\nwomen, BMI was the only variable that substantially af-\nfected the OR estimates. Inclusion of BMI in the age-\nadjusted models resulted in an approximately 8% attenu-\nation in the magnitude of the association of serum ascorbic\nacid to clinical and asymptomatic gallbladder disease. For\nexample, a 1-SD increase in serum ascorbic acid level (27\n\u00b5mol/L) was associated with a 23% lower prevalence of\nclinical gallbladder disease before adjustment for BMI,\nbut only a 17% lower prevalence after adjustment (age-\nP.001). There were no variables that significantly con-\nfounded the relationship between serum ascorbic acid and\ngallbladder disease among men.\nWe also examined the relationship of ascorbic acid\nsupplement use (or use of multiple vitamins containing\nadditional ascorbic acid) to gallbladder disease by sub-\nstituting supplement use for serum ascorbic acid in the\nmultivariate models presented in Table 2. Among women,\nsupplement use was independently associated with a 34%\nlower prevalence of clinical gallbladder disease (P = .02)\nbut was not associated with prevalence of asymptom-\naticgallstones(P = .86).Amongmen,ascorbicacidsupple-\nment use was associated with a trend toward a higher\nprevalence of clinical gallbladder disease (P = .07), but\nwas not associated with asymptomatic gallstones (P = .54).\nSmoking, which lowers serum ascorbic acid levels, was\nalso analyzed as a separate predictor of gallbladder dis-\nease.

We found no evidence of such an interaction.\nCOMMENT\nOur principal finding was a consistent inverse relation-\nship between serum level of ascorbic acid and preva-\nlence of gallbladder disease among women. We also ob-\nserved among women that ascorbic acid supplement use\nwas associated with a lower prevalence of clinical gall-\nbladder disease. We found no significant relationship,\nhowever, between serum level of ascorbic acid (or ascor-\nbic acid supplement use) and prevalence of gallbladder\ndisease among men. Three reports have examined the re-\nlationship of ascorbic acid to gallbladder disease among\nhuman populations, and our findings are, in general, simi-\nlar to those in these reports.20-22 In a small case-control\nstudy among 23 men and 77 women, Ortega and col-\nleagues20 found an association between lower dietary in-\ntake of ascorbic acid and gallbladder disease among\nwomen, but not men. In another study, Simon et al21 ex-\namined ascorbic acid supplement use as a correlate of clini-\ncal gallbladder disease among postmenopausal women\nwith coronary heart disease. Among women who con-\nsumed alcohol, ascorbic acid supplement use was inde-\npendently associated with a 50% reduction in preva-\nlence of self-reported gallstones and a 62% reduction in\ncholecystectomy.21 This study, however, examined a\nsomewhat atypical group of women with a high (23%)\nprevalence of self-reported gallbladder disease.

We\nalso analyzed data from the Second National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey and reported a signifi-\ncant nonlinear relationship between serum ascorbic\nacid level and prevalence of clinical gallbladder disease\namong women; self-reported prevalence of gallstones\nand cholecystectomy was lower among women with\nboth low and high serum levels of ascorbic acid.22 We\nfound no relationship, either linear or nonlinear,\nbetween serum ascorbic acid level and gallbladder dis-\nease prevalence among men enrolled in the Second\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.\nThus, the association between ascorbic acid status and\ngallbladder disease has been reported only among\nwomen20-22 and may be the result of a biological interac-\ntion between ascorbic acid status and sex. However,\nthese findings may also reflect the lower prevalence of\ngallbladder disease among men and reduced statistical\npower to detect such an association.\nUnlike the previous studies examining the relation-\nship of ascorbic acid status to gallbladder disease,\nNHANES III collected data on the sonographic pres-\nence of gallstones. These data are important because pre-\nvious studies could not exclude the possibility that par-\nticipants changed their diets after being diagnosed as\nhaving gallbladder disease. Although it seems implau-\nsible that women with gallbladder disease would change\ntheir diets and consume less ascorbic acid\u00adcontaining\nfruits, vegetables, and dietary supplements, this possi-\nbility cannot be excluded. However, because this study\nalso examined participants with gallstones present on ab-\ndominal ultrasound who denied any previous symptom-\natic gallbladder disease and reported no history of ab-\ndominal pain consistent with undiagnosed gallbladder\ndisease, it strengthens the hypothesis that ascorbic acid\nstatus may be an important risk factor for gallstone for-\nmation among women.\nWe hypothesized that an inverse relationship\nbetween serum ascorbic acid levels and gallbladder\ndisease in humans might be observed on the basis of\nthe results of animal experiments.10 In guinea pigs,\nascorbic acid affects the activity of cholesterol 7\n-hydroxylase, the enzyme that regulates the rate-\nlimiting step in the catabolism of cholesterol to bile\nacids.12 Ascorbic acid supplementation increases cho-\nlesterol 7 -hydroxylase activity by as much as 15-fold\ncompared with ascorbic acid\u00addeficient guinea pigs,23\nand ascorbic acid\u00addeficient guinea pigs frequently\ndevelop cholesterol gallstones.7,8,24 Additionally, hy-\npersecretion of mucin, a glycoprotein that is secreted\nby the epithelium of the gallbladder, has been found to\nprecede cholesterol destabilization and gallstone for-\nmation.25,26 Because hydroxyl and oxygen radicals\nstimulate the hypersecretion of mucin,27 the inhibition\nof oxidative changes within the gallbladder by ascorbic\nacid may also decrease mucoprotein production and\ngallstone formation.\nOur study has a number of strengths and limita-\ntions. Because NHANES III surveyed a large probability\nsample of Americans, our findings, which are derived from\nanalyses of data from approximately 83% of examined\nNHANES III participants, should be generalizable to the\nUS population. Although participants excluded from the\nanalyses were similar to included participants in regard\nto age and sex, they were more likely to be nonwhite\nand to have achieved a lower level of education. Nev-\nertheless, we believe these differences are unlikely to\nsubstantially affect the generalizability of our findings.\nFurthermore, the measurement of serum ascorbic acid\nlevels on a large sample of the population allows a\nmore reliable assessment of ascorbic acid status as a\ncorrelate of gallbladder disease compared with studies\nusing dietary intake estimations only. Plasma ascorbic\nacid levels are strongly correlated with leukocyte\nascorbic acid levels, an indicator of tissue levels,28 and\nreflect at least the previous several months of dietary\nintake, even during periods of seasonal variation.29 It\nis also unlikely that recall bias affected our findings,\nsince participants obtained blood levels of ascorbic\nacid and completed a comprehensive questionnaire\nthat included information on many health outcomes.\nMost importantly, we have data on asymptomatic gall-\nbladder disease that are not subject to interviewer or\nrecall bias and are not available from previous studies.\nHowever, for the outcome of clinical gallbladder dis-\nease, we relied on self-reported history and may,\ntherefore, have misclassified some outcomes. Such\nmisclassification would likely have decreased the\npower of our study to detect associations. It is also\npossible that unknown or unmeasured confounders\nmay have affected our results and that serum ascorbic\nacid may simply be a healthy lifestyle marker. Further-\nmore, we cannot exclude the possibility that a sys-\ntemic oxidative stress may both lower serum ascorbic\nacid levels and result in gallstone formation. Finally,\nbecause of the cross-sectional nature of the study, we\ncannot be certain that differences in serum ascorbic\nacid level preceded gallbladder disease, and inferences\nregarding causality should be made cautiously.\nSerum ascorbic acid level is an important correlate\nof symptomatic and asymptomatic gallbladder disease\namong American women. Our study is the first to re-\nport an association between serum ascorbic acid levels\nand asymptomatic gallstones. Examination of this rela-\ntionship among other populations is indicated, and clini-\ncal trials of ascorbic acid for the primary or secondary\nprevention of gallbladder disease among women should\nbe considered.\nThis study was supported by Roche Vitamins, Inc,\nParsippany, NJ, and grant HL53479 from the Public Health\nService, Bethesda, Md.\nReprints: JoelA.Simon,MD,MPH,GeneralInternalMedi-\nentSt,SanFrancisco,CA94121(e-mail:jasimon@itsa.ucsf.edu).\nREFERENCES\n1.
