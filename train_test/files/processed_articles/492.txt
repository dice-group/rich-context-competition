Further studies in the various\nage groups and sports will be needed\nto answer these clinical problems\nThere is also speculation that concus-\nsion in young athletes may produce\nmore severe long-term developmental\nand cognitive problems than are seen\nin their older counterparts.4 It has\nbeen noted that less overall head in-\njury force is needed to produce clinical\nsymptoms in children than in adults.7\nFurthermore, experts hypothesize that\nbrain systems that are responsible for\nskill acquisition are more susceptible\nto disruption from diffuse injury, such\nas is seen in concussion; therefore,\nyoung children who are still develop-\ning their essential skills may be at in-\ncreased risk for developmental de-\nlays.8 Studies have also shown that\nyounger athletes have prolonged cog-\nnitive disturbances (as measured by\nneuropsychological testing) after con-\ncussion compared with older ath-\nletes.9,10 Moreover, there are case re-\nports of the so-called \"second impact\nsyndrome\" in which brainstem hernia-\ntion occurs after potentially minor re-\ninjury while a patient is still symptom-\natic from a previous concussion. These\ndevastating injuries seem to occur\nprimarily in child and adolescent\nManagement of concussion in the\nyoung athlete has also been the source\nof much controversy. There are no\nevidence-based management guide-\nlines for younger children with con-\ncussion, and it has been suggested\nthat current management strategies\nand return-to-play guidelines are too\nliberal for young players. For exam-\nConferences on Concussion intro-\nduced the idea of cognitive rest, in\naddition to physical rest, for athletes\nTo elucidate the scope of the problem\nof concussion in younger athletes com-\npared with older athletes, our study\ncharacterized emergency department\n(ED) visits for pediatric sport-related\nconcussion (SRC) in pre\u00adhigh school\u00ad\n(8\u00ad13 years) versus high school\u00adaged\ncould be used to help guide future re-\nsearch and prevention efforts.\nMETHODS\nStudy Design\nA retrospective review of the National\nElectronic Injury Surveillance System\njury Program (NEISS-AIP) from Janu-\nperformed. The study protocol was de-\ntermined to be exempt from institu-\ntional review board review by our insti-\ntution's Committee on the Protection\nof Human Subjects.\nStudy Setting and Population\nThe NEISS15 is a data collection system\nthat is conducted by the US Consumer\nProduct Safety Commission of a na-\ntional probability sample of 100 US\nhospitals with a minimum of 6 beds\nand a 24-hour ED. It collects data on US\nED visits that are related to consumer\nproducts. The NEISS-AIP is a collabora-\ntive effort between the US Consumer\nProduct Safety Commission and the\nCenters for Disease Control and Pre-\nvention's National Center for Injury\nPrevention and Control. It uses 66 of\n100 NEISS hospitals and collects data\non the basis of type of injury. The data-\ntended to provide national incidence\nestimates of nonfatal injuries and poi-\nsonings that are treated in US hospital\nEDs. Information collected by the NEISS\nincludes date of injury, patient age, di-\nagnosis, body part injured, patient dis-\nposition, locale in which the injury oc-\ncurred, and type of product or sport\nassociated with the injury. Incident lo-\ncale is coded by NEISS as home, farm\nor ranch, street or highway, other pub-\nlic property (includes store, office\nbuilding, restaurant, church, hotel,\nmotel, hospital or other medical facil-\nity, nightclub, theater, or other pubic\nproperty), mobile home, industrial\nplace, school, place of recreation or\nsport, or not recorded. In both data-\nbases, fatal injuries are excluded, and\nno patient outcomes are available. Sev-\neral academic groups have used NEISS\nand NEISS-AIP successfully to investi-\ngate a wide variety of injury- and\nStudy Protocol\nAll ED visits with a diagnosis of concus-\nsion were included. Age groups were\ndivided into pre\u00adhigh school (8\u00ad13\nWe then created subsets for all ED\nvisits for concussion as follows: all\ncauses, all sport-related, individual\nand leisure sport-related, and orga-\nnized team sport (OTS)-related. The\nall SRC category included team sports,\nindividual sports (eg, gymnastics,\ntrack), and leisure sports (eg, bicy-\ncling, skateboarding). For the pur-\nposes of our study, OTS included the\ntop 5 concussion-generating team\nsports (per the collected data) of foot-\nARTICLE\nball, basketball, baseball, ice hockey,\nand soccer. In an additional attempt to\nlimit this category to OTS, we re-\nstricted location codes to school and\nplace of recreation or sport. Injury\nrates were calculated by using popula-\ntion projections from the US Census\nBureau on July 1 of each year. Popula-\ntion data were averaged over the\n5-year study period. Sport participa-\ntion data were from the National Sport-\ning Goods Association (NSGA). The\nNSGA conducts annual mail-based sur-\nholds, collecting self-reported sports\nparticipation data for US residents. El-\nigible participants include household\nmembers who are aged 7 years and\nreport participation in a sport at least\nonce during the 12-month period. In-\nformation collected includes age,\nname of sport, and number of days\nparticipated during the previous 12\nmonths. Because of constraints set\nforth by the NSGA, ages were grouped\nData Analysis\nData were analyzed using SAS Survey\nProcedures (PROC SURVEYFREQ) to ac-\ncount for the complex sampling design\nand weighting structure associated\nwith NEISS. Each case was assigned a\nsample weight on the basis of the in-\nverse probability of selection (pro-\nvided by NEISS). These weights were\nused to calculate national estimates of\nnonfatal injuries. Confidence intervals\n(CIs) were calculated by using a direct\nvariance estimation procedure that\naccounted for the sample weights.\nRESULTS\ndren who were aged 8 to 19 years had\ncussion. The 8- to 13-year age group\naccounted for 35% of these visits.\nApproximately half of all ED visits for\nconcussion in our studied ages were\nsport-related. The 8- to 13-year-old chil-\ndren sustained 40% of these, which\nrepresents 58% of all concussions in\nthis younger group.

The majority of con-\ncussions overall and within the\nyounger group are sport-related\nis in agreement with previous,\nsmaller studies that showed similar\nSimilarly, when participation data\nare taken into account (Table 3),\nSRCs seem even more problematic for\ncertain sports. The largest number of\nED visits for SRC in OTS in younger ath-\nletes was seen in football and basket-\nball, but this seems to be the conse-\nquence of the comparatively higher\nlevel of participation in those sports.\nWhen participation rates were ac-\ncounted for, the rate of concussion\nwas highest in football and ice hockey.\nWhat is more striking (as depicted in\nFig 3) is that the number of SRCs in OTS\nhave increased significantly during a\n10-year period despite an overall de-\ncline in participation.

This\nis especially true for the young ath-\nlete, with prevailing expert opinion\nsuggesting that concussion in this\nage group can produce more severe\nneurologic sequelae, such as pro-\nlonged cognitive disturbances, dis-\nturbed skill acquisition, and second-\nThere are numerous avenues for fu-\nture research into SRC in the young\nathlete. First, no comprehensive\nreturn-to-play guidelines have been\nadapted for the young athlete, and\nthe majority of current and past\nstudies were performed with older\nathletes. One potential strategy in-\nvolves the use of neuropsychological\nstudied in high school, collegiate, and\nprofessional athletes.27 Other return-\nto-play decision techniques being in-\nvestigated include functional MRI, vi-\nsual tracking technology, and balance\ndysfunction tracking.27\nAdditional work also remains to be\nconducted to standardize the man-\nagement of SRC in young athletes by\nhealth professionals. No evidence-\nbased, management guidelines have\nbeen published specifically for this\nage group, although most experts\nagree that young children cannot be\ntreated in the same way as older ad-\nolescents.22 For example, discussion\nat the 3rd International Conference\ndressed the suggestion of not only\nphysical but also cognitive rest and a\nslow, graded return to play and\nschool.14 The need for more conser-\nvative treatment of younger children\nwas stressed, with no same-day re-\nturn to play and gradual overall re-\nturn to play.\nPrevention strategies for younger\nathletes also require additional ex-\namination. For example, no state cur-\nrently requires the use of helmets\nduring skiing activities for any age\ngroup; however, several studies have\nshown that the use of helmets during\nalpine activities can provide protec-\ntion against facial and head inju-\nnational Conference on Concussion in\nSport recommended their use for all\nalpine sports.14 Soccer is another\nsport in which prevention strategies\ncould be bolstered. Most soccer-\nrelated concussions are not caused by\npurposeful heading of the ball but by\ncollision with another player, goal\npost, or ball kicked by another player\ninto the head from a short distance;\ntherefore, strategies might include\ndecreasing the mass and air pressure\nof balls used by younger players and\nsecuring and padding goal posts\nFinally, there are potential benefits\nin enhanced education for coaches,\ntrainers, parents, and the athletes\nthemselves to increase reporting and\nproper management of SRC.32 Studies\nhave shown that many athletes with\nconcussions do not seek medical at-\ntention or even report symptoms to a\nparents and coaches also have a lack\nof understanding of concussion, with a\nsignificant number not familiar with\nwhat a concussion is or when to keep\nathletes from returning to play.37 A\nnotable misunderstandings about\nOur study has several limitations. First,\nthe true number of concussions is\nlikely underestimated by NEISS, be-\ncause it does not include concussions\nthat are treated at urgent care facili-\nties, at doctors' offices, at home, or\nby coaches/trainers. Second, concus-\nsions overall are underreported by\nathletes and caregivers, lowering esti-\nWe attempted to restrict our analysis\nof competitive team sport to only OTS\nthrough 2 methods. First, by restrict-\ning location codes to school and place\nof recreation or sport, we attempted to\nminimize nonorganized settings. Sec-\nond, by review of the NEISS narrative\ndescriptions, we were able to exclude\nadditional records that did not involve\nathletic competition or training. De-\nspite this approach, some cases may\nhave been erroneously omitted or\nincluded.\nDetails of the circumstances and char-\nacteristics of the injuries in the NEISS\ndata sets are limited; therefore, we re-\nlied on accurate diagnosis on the part\nof the recording facility. Finally, it is\nimportant to note that participation\ndata from the NSGA may represent an\noverestimation because the NSGA de-\nfines a participant as someone who\nparticipated \"at least once in the last\n12 months.\" This would have caused\nour calculations to be an underestima-\ntion of the true injury incidence.\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlthough the number of SRCs is higher\nin the older athlete, the number in\nyoung athletes is noteworthy and war-\nrants additional research. The rate of\nED visits for concussion in OTS seems\nto be highest in football and ice hockey,\nand the most ED visits for concussions\nin leisure and individual sports are in\nbicycling, playground activities, and\nsnow skiing. In addition, ED visits for\nconcussion in both age groups is on\nthe rise, whereas participation in the\ntop 5 OTSs is declining. Additional re-\nsearch to provide guidance in manage-\nment, prevention strategies, and edu-\ncation for practitioners, coaches, and\nathletes is required.\nARTICLE\nREFERENCES\n1 Powell JW, Barber-Foss KD.
