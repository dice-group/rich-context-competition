Despite this evidence of existing biases in social judg-\nment, people often fail to recognize those biases in their own\nsocial judgments, even while they detect them in judgments\nmade by others (bias blind spot: Pronin, Lin, & Ross, 2002).\nThis asymmetry in bias perception has been attributed to\n\"naive realism\" (e.g., Pronin et al., 2002), a conviction that one\nperceives objects and events \"as they are\"--in other words,\nthat there is an objective reality that is in a one to one corre-\nspondence with one's own perceptions (Ross & Ward, 1995,\n1996). According to this construct, the reason we assume our\nsocial judgments are free from bias is because we believe that\n\"we see the thing as it is\" (for a review, see Pronin, Gilovich, &\nRoss, 2004). However, this explanation for the unawareness of\nbiases in one's own judgments is only a theoretical assumption\nthat has not been well explored experimentally.\nPrior research has hinted at possible factors that may con-\ntribute to sustaining unrealistic personal beliefs when making\nsocial judgments. First, people are seldom confronted with\nevents that illustrate judgment inaccuracies. Daily life may be\ntoo complex to permit clear determinations of judgment accu-\nracy. Although people may occasionally be confronted with\ninstances that question their sense of objectivity (e.g., other\npeople responding to issues and events differently), they tend\nto focus on information that supports their own opinions and\ndeny the validity of contradictory information (confirmatory\nbias; Lord, Ross, & Lepper, 1979). Thus, it is plausible to\nassume that people will not notice their susceptibility to\nbiases without confronting clear demonstrations of their own\nfalse or inaccurate perceptions.\nPerceptions vary on a continuum from simple ones (e.g.,\nsensory perception of physical objects) to complex ones\n(e.g., opinions in politics). Some researchers have pointed to\nthe possibility that certainty in sensory perception plays a\nrole in driving human overconfidence in one's own social\nthat na\u00efve realism of \"I see the world as it is\" may cause few\ndifficulties in daily life insofar as our concern is with the\nexperience of physical objects. In addition, Pronin et al.\n(2004) suggested that the \"na\u00efve realism conviction began\nwith physical perception and generalized to complex social\nevents and political issues\" (p. 783).\nBanaji and Greenwald (2013) suggested that biases in social\njudgments and errors in sensory perception are similar because\nboth are the results of unconscious and automatic mental work\nthat consists of their perceptions.According to them, \"it (visual\nillusion) serves as a vivid illustration of a signal property of the\nKyoto Gakuen University, Japan\nCorresponding Author:\nAyumi Kambara, lecturer, Kyoto Gakuen University, Nanjyo Otani 1-1,\nEmail: ayumi.kanbara@gmail.com\nEffects of Experiencing Visual Illusions\nand Susceptibility to Biases in One's Social\nJudgments\nAyumi Kambara\n Keywords\nna\u00efve realism, objectivity, bias perception, visual illusion, cognition\n2 SAGE Open\nmind--it does a great deal of its work automatically, uncon-\nsciously, and unintentionally\" (Banaji & Greenwald, 2013, p.\n5). Thus, visual illusion might be a good example of uncon-\nscious processes constructing human perception.\nOne study (Hart, Tullett, Shreves, & Fetterman, 2015)\ntested the effect of reminding people of their unconscious\nand automatic mental work on their confidence in their social\njudgment. In their study, participants who were not only\ngiven explanations of unconscious and automatic mental\nwork but were also exposed to optical illusions lost confi-\ndence in their social judgment, as compared with participants\nwho were only given the explanations. With this result, it is\nnot clear whether experiencing optical illusions only without\nany explanations is effective, and why people become less\nconfident of their social judgment; however, this result seems\nto imply that it might be difficult for people to dismiss first-\nhand experiences of sensory perception error rather than\nmere warnings about their subjectivity.\nIn the context of these arguments, it was hypothesized\nthat people become more aware of their susceptibility to\nbiased perceptions if they encounter clear demonstrations\nthat personal sensory perceptions are not necessarily accu-\nrate. To test this hypothesis, visual illusions were used as\nstimuli to target and challenge habitual reliance on personal\nsensory perceptions. Unlike Hart et al. (2015), explanations\nof na\u00efve realism were not used as stimuli in this study.\nVisual illusions are characterized by visually perceived\nimages that convincingly differ from objective reality and\nphysical properties (Kitaoka, 2008). At least momentarily,\nexperiencing visual illusions would remind a viewer of per-\nsonal fallibility in sensory perception, as this is a condition\nwhen viewers are able to recognize the mismatch between a\nperceived image and objective reality.\nAmong the various types of visual illusions, motion illu-\nsions were used as stimuli in this experiment. Motion illu-\nsion is an optical illusion in which a static image appears to\nbe moving due to the cognitive effects of interacting color\ncontrasts and shape position (Goldstein & Brockmole, 2016).\nTherefore, people would be naturally aware that their per-\nception of motion should not reflect the physical properties\nof a real-world object when an illusory motion graphic is\nprinted on a sheet of paper; this is because such graphics\ncause people to perceive \"moving\" graphics even while they\nare simultaneously aware that the graphics illustrated on a\nsheet of paper should not be actually moving. Both the\nappearance of the presented graphics and their feeling about\nthe appearance of the presented graphics were confirmed as\na manipulation check in this study.\nOur goal was to investigate whether people might better\nrealize their own susceptibility to various biases in their own\nsocial judgments if they encounter clear demonstrations of\ntheir own sensory perception errors. To achieve this goal, the\neffect of visual illusion on susceptibility to various biases in\nboth own and average others' social judgments was exam-\nined. If, as predicted, exposure to errors in their OWN sen-\nsory perception makes people aware of the uncertainty of\ntheir OWN perception, experiencing illusion affects suscep-\ntibility to biases only in their OWN social judgment, but not\nin OTHERS' social judgment. This is because uncertainty\nabout their OWN sensory perception might relate to uncer-\ntainty about their OWN social perception, while uncertainty\nabout their OWN sensory perception has nothing to do with\nuncertainty about OTHERS' social perception. Even if there\nis a slight possibility that uncertainty about one's OWN per-\nception caused by visual illusion generalized to that of\nOTHERS' perception, confronting visual illusion would not\ninduce incremental awareness of biases in OTHERS' social\njudgment. This is because, as previously mentioned, it is well\nknown that people do not believe the objectivity of OTHERS'\nsocial perception from the beginning; people are usually\naware of biases in OTHERS' social judgment without being\nexposed to visual illusion (Pronin et al., 2002).\nMethod\nParticipants\nJapan participated in this study. Participants were recruited\neither in public spaces on the university campus (n = 65) or\nin the classroom (n = 23). All participants were provided\nwith snacks as compensation for taking part in the study.\nFollowingtheethicalguidelinesoftheJapanesePsychological\nAssociation, all participants were informed that their\nresponses would be anonymous and that they could with-\ndraw at any time during the study.\nExperimental Design\nA 2 (visual illusion exposure vs. no exposure) \u00d7 2 (Ratings of\nSelf vs. Ratings of Other) factorial between-subjects design\nwas used. Participants were randomly divided into four\ngroups: (a) visual illusion exposure-Rating of Self (n = 22),\n(b) no exposure-Rating of Self (n = 22), (c) visual illusion\nexposure-Rating of Other (n = 21), and (d) no exposure-Rat-\ning of Other (n = 23).\nProcedure\nThe experiment was conducted in small groups (two or four\npeople) who were told that they would take part in an \"evalu-\nation of pictures and persons' impressions\" right at the outset.\nExperimental manipulation: Challenging habitual reliance on\nsensory perception.Half of the participants received book-\nlets that consisted of three pieces of paper, with one illu-\nsory motion graphic printed on each page. These images are\nprovided in Appendix A. The other half received the same\nbooklet, but with control graphics that were similar to the\nillusory motion graphics in color and shape, but without\nany motion illusion (see Appendix B). Participants were\ntold to fix their eyes on the graphics until the experimenter\ncued them to go to the next page. Participants gazed at each\ngraphic for 40 s. Participants were told that they would be\nasked to provide their thoughts on the graphics later.\nMeasurement of perceived bias.Next, participants were\nasked to respond to each item on a bias impression question-\nnaire. This questionnaire began with \"Psychologists have\nclaimed that people in general show the tendencies described\nbelow.\" Seven specific motivational and cognitive biases were\ndescribed: self-serving attribution for success versus failure,\ndissonance reduction after making a free choice, the positive\nhalo effect, biased assimilation of new information, reactive\ndevaluation of proposals from one's negotiation counterparts,\nthe fundamental attribution error (FAE) in \"blaming the vic-\ntim,\" and judgments about the \"greater good\" that were influ-\nenced by personal self-interest. These seven biases were taken\nfrom previous research on the \"bias blind spot\" (Pronin et al.,\n2002).1 All the descriptions used the neutral term \"effect\" or\n\"tendency\" rather than the nonneutral term \"bias.\" For exam-\nple, self-serving attribution bias was described as\na tendency to regard successes as the result of personal qualities,\nsuch as drive or ability, but to regard failures as the result of\nexternal factors, luck or some type of situational cause.\nHalf of the participants from each of the visual illusion\nexposure and no exposure groups were asked about their\nown susceptibility to each of the seven biases (i.e., \"To what\nextent do you believe that you show this tendency?\") while\nthe other half of each group were asked about the susceptibil-\nity of an imagined average student at the same university to\nthese biases (i.e., \"To what extent do you believe that other,\naverage students show this tendency?\"). Ratings were made\non a 9-point scale from 1 (not at all) to 9 (strongly).\nFinally, participants were asked to respond to two ques-\ntions intended to confirm how the illustrations had appeared\nto the participants, and how they had felt about the appear-\nance of the illustrations. The first question asked participants\nto answer how the illustration looked by making a selection\nfrom three options (1. in motion, 2. not sure, and 3. at rest).\nThe second question asked the degree of surprise the partici-\npants experienced by the appearance of the illustrations.\n\"How surprised were you about how the illustrations looked?\nIf you saw an illustration that looked like it was moving/at\nrest, how surprised were you about it?\" This question was\nscored on a Likert-type rating scale (1 = not at all surprised,\n5 = extremely surprised). Last, participants were questioned\nregarding their awareness of the experiment's purpose using\nthe following questions: \"What do you think the purpose of\nthe experiment was?\" and \"What do you think this experi-\nment was trying to study?\"\nAnalysis.Each participant's responses to the seven bias\nitems were averaged to create a bias perception index for\nthat participant. To examine the main prediction, a 2 (self\nvs. other) \u00d7 2 (illusion vs. control) analysis of variance\n(ANOVA) was performed on the composite scores of the\nbias perception measure.\nResults\nJust as planned, data from any participants who failed to com-\nplete the questionnaire (n = 6) or who expressed thoughts about\nthe two studies being related (n = 1) in the questions probing\nfor awareness of the experiment's purpose were excluded. In\naddition, responses from participants who evaluated the control\ngraphics as moving were removed (n = 4), resulting in a final\nsample size of 77 students.2,3 The number of participants in\neach condition was then 18 participants in the control/self-rat-\ning condition, 21 participants in the control/other rating condi-\ntion, 19 participants in the illusion/self-rating condition, and 19\nparticipants in the illusion/other rating condition.\nManipulation Checks\nParticipants reported being more surprised by the illusion\ncondition than by the control condition (control: M = 1.33,\nwere more personally and emotionally impacted by the expe-\nrience of gazing at visual illusions than were the control\ngroup participants who did not have this exposure.\nParticipants' responses to the measurement of the per-\nceived bias of the seven bias items were reliable (Cronbach's\n = .79). Each participant's responses to those seven bias\nitems were averaged to create a bias perception index for\neach participant. Examination of the bias perception scores\nin the control condition revealed that participants who rated\ntheir own bias susceptibility gave lower bias ratings than did\nparticipants who answered in terms of the average student\nwith the results of previous studies (e.g., Pronin et al., 2002),\nand it replicates na\u00efve realism.\nDependent Measure\nParticipants' bias perception scores were analyzed using a 2\n(target: self vs. other) \u00d7 2 (presented graphics: illusion vs. con-\ntrol) between-subjects ANOVA. There was a main effect of\ntarget, indicating that participants in the Rating of Self condi-\ntion, compared with those in the Rating of Other condition,\np\n2 = .34. There was no main effect of the presented graphics,\nThese main effects were qualified by a significant inter-\nour hypotheses, simple-effects tests showed that perceived\nsusceptibility to bias in one's own social judgments were\nhigher among the participants in the illusion condition than\nthe participants in the control condition (control: M = 3.74,\n4 SAGE Open\n2 = .08. In contrast, perceived susceptibility to\nbias in average others' social judgment did not show any\ngroup difference between the control condition and the illu-\nComparing the bias perception scores about oneself and\nothers in the illusion condition, participants who rated them-\nselves reported less bias susceptibility than did the participants\nwho rated average others (self: M = 4.63, SD = 1.33; others:\nresults are reported in Figure 1.\nDiscussion\nFirst, in the control group, the participants who rated themselves\nperceived less bias than those who rated others. This confirms\nthe \"bias blind spot\" and replicates the results from previous\nresearch (Pronin et al., 2002). As exposure to visual illusions\nincreased awareness of bias in one's own social judgments, our\nprimary prediction was also supported. This implies that lack of\nopportunity to experience clear gaps between personal percep-\ntion and objective reality might be contributing to unawareness\nof biases in one's own social perception. The increased percep-\ntion of bias was not merely an effect of experiencing visual illu-\nsions because the incremental change in the perception of bias\ndue to exposure to illusory images was found only in the self-\nrating condition, not in the other-rating condition.\nWhile exposure to visual illusions was shown to increase\nthe awareness of bias in one's own social judgments, partici-\npants perceived fewer biases in their own social judgments\nthan in those of an average student even after being exposed\nto visual illusions. Therefore, exposure to visual illusions can\nbe said to influence bias perception in one's own social judg-\nment, but its influence is insufficient to make the bias blind\nspot completely disappear.\nA question concerned with the ways by which people\nrealize the existence of bias has been proposed: \"Under\nwhat circumstances do people seem to recognize rather than\noverlook or deny their susceptibility to bias?\" (Kennedy &\nPronin, 2008). However, few empirical studies have sought\nto investigate the ways and circumstances that enable peo-\nple to recognize biases and thereby advance this research.\nOne study (Pronin & Kugler, 2007) showed that people\nwere more likely to acknowledge their own susceptibility to\nvarious social biases after reading an article about the\nunconscious mental work that shapes human behavior and\njudgment. The present study used an experiential task\ninstead of an explanation task to remind participants that\npersonal perceptions do not always reflect objective reality.\nLimitations of the present study and its implications are as\nfollows. First, in this study, it was assumed that confronting\nthe gap between one's perceived image and objective reality in\nsensory perception causes one to recognize that one's own\nsocial perceptions are not necessarily an accurate reflection of\nthe social world. As previously mentioned, the result of Hart\net al. (2015) also seems to imply that there is a relationship\nbetween regarding one's social perception as absolute and\nexperiencing optical illusion. However, the present study does\nnot provide direct evidence for these underlying mechanisms.\nFurther study will be needed to clarify this mechanism.\nSecond, the results presented here showed only short-\nterm effects, and it remains unclear how long these effects\nmight last. Even though almost all people have previously\nexperienced visual illusions, they still tend to believe that\nthey are free from bias. Future research might address the\nduration of this effect and what may be needed to show long-\nterm effects.\nConclusion\nOverall, the current study showed that people become aware\nof various biases in their own social judgment by experienc-\ning visual illusions that remind them of uncertainty in their\nsensory perceptions. Seeking ways to have people acknowl-\nedge their subjectivity would be meaningful for mutual\nunderstanding, because the blindness to biases in one's own\nsocial judgment was reported as one of the causes for inter-\npersonal conflicts when people have opposing views\n(Kennedy & Pronin, 2008; Pronin, Kennedy, & Butsch,\nHowever, this article was not designed to argue that over-\nconfidence in one's sense of social objectivity should always\nbe undermined. In ordinary life, doubting one's own percep-\ntion, especially doubting every single instance of one's own\nsensory perception, would bring us a substantial amount of\ninconvenience. Considering the point that many cognitive\nerrors that arise do support personal, societal, or even evolu-\ntionary advantages (Haselton & Buss, 2000), blindness to\none's own biases might be a product or by-product of adapta-\ntion (e.g., reducing cognitive loads). With this point of view,\nfurther studies need to explore ways and mechanisms that\nmake people realize their subjectivity without those adaptive\nsides, if any, impaired.\nFigure 1.
