    "abstract": "Abstract\nAdolescent pregnancy is often described as a major concern in public health and is associated with negative outcomes for\neducational and career attainment. Our objective was to compare the future aspirations of pregnant and parenting adolescents\nand identify social or structural barriers that they experience in their daily lives using journal entries from pregnant and\nparenting adolescents. The journals, which served as primary data sources, were completed by 52 multi-ethnic pregnant and\nparenting adolescents aged 15 to 19 in Indiana. Both pregnant and parenting adolescents aspired to provide a \"better life\" for\ntheir children that included finishing school and obtaining a career. An emergent theme is that the experience of pregnancy\nand parenting is transformative and may invoke a positive refocusing of life aspirations for educational and career attainment.\nHowever, social stigma and barriers exist that make achieving educational and employment opportunities difficult. The study\nfindings indicate that pregnant and parenting adolescents need strong social support networks and practical tools to help\nharness their motivation and transcend social and material barriers to achieve their goals and aspirations.\n",

Despite the decline, adolescent pregnancy is\na major concern in public health according to the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC; 2014). Adolescent\npregnancy has been associated with a number of negative\nsocial, psychological, developmental, and health outcomes\nfor both the mothers and their children (CDC, 2014). One of\nthe negative outcomes for mothers is a reduced likelihood of\ncompleting a high school diploma or a university degree,\nwhich limits their future employment potential (Escamilla &\nAttainment of a high school or college degree is important\nbecause of the correlation between educational attainment\nand earning potential through one's lifetime. For example,\nadults with advanced degrees earn 4 times more than those\nwith less than a high school diploma (\"Educational\nAttainment in the United States,\" 2012). Escamilla and\nSanthiveeran's (2005) longitudinal study pointed to long-\nterm disadvantages for women who gave birth before the age\nof 20, including lower levels of educational attainment and\nemployment in addition to higher rates of poverty and use of\npublic assistance. Furstenberg's (2003) research asserted that\nyoung parenting affects work resulting in less time employed,\nlower paying positions, increased likelihood to be supported\nthrough public assistance, and difficulties with balancing\nparenting with work.\nResearchers and policy makers alike have focused on the\ndevastating effects of adolescent pregnancy and parenthood.\nThus, we were interested in understanding the aspirations of\npregnant and parenting adolescents and the structural and\nsocial barriers that they view as obstacles to achieving their\naspirations.\nAlthough much has been written regarding the long-term\ndetrimental effects of adolescent pregnancy, some research-\ners have challenged the causal links between adolescent\npregnancy and negative life outcomes (Barr & Simons, 2012;\n1University of Georgia, Athens, USA\n2University of Illinois at Urbana\u00adChampaign, USA\n3Indiana University\u00adPurdue University Indianapolis, USA\n4Institute of Development Studies, University of Sussex, Brighton, UK\nCorresponding Author:\nColleen O'Brien Cherry, College of Public Health, University of Georgia,\nEmail: cobrien@uga.edu\nBuilding a \"Better Life\": The\nTransformative Effects of Adolescent\nPregnancy and Parenting\nColleen O'Brien Cherry1, Neale Chumbler1, Jennifer Bute2,3,\nand Amber Huff4\n Keywords\nadolescent pregnancy, teen parenting, aspirations, educational attainment, transformation\n2 SAGE Open\nStudies have found that adolescent pregnancy is more likely\na consequence rather than a cause of economic and social\nother words, pregnancy is not the impetus for the correlated\nnegative \"outcomes\" of adolescent pregnancy, but rather,\nadolescent pregnancy is a reflection of the social context in\nwhich the pregnancy takes place (Barr & Simons, 2012;\nResearchers have typically used quantitative or quasi-\nexperimental research designs when comparing aspirations\nand educational attainment between adolescent and older\nresearch often overlooks the political, economic, and cultural\ncontexts that may elucidate the structural challenges that\nerode aspirations. Researchers have called for more qualita-\ntive studies that focus on the voices of adolescent women\nSmithBattle, 2007b) and that identify the structural barriers\nthat may be the impetus for aspirational changes and lower-\ning of expectations (Barr & Simons, 2012).\nSalusky, 2013) have identified the disconnect between how\nhealth care professionals, scholars, and the general public see\npregnancy influencing the lives of adolescents versus how\nadolescents see pregnancy affecting their own lives.\nSmithBattle (2007b) observed that the anticipation of moth-\nerhood led adolescents to reevaluate and refocus their priori-\nties, often motivating them to want to complete school. In\nSmithBattle's study, she found transformed life meaning and\npriorities and a greater importance placed on school and\ncareers for pregnant and parenting mothers. In fact, regard-\nless of the adolescents'school status prior to their pregnancy,\nthe anticipation of motherhood was an impetus for motivat-\ning them to remain in or return to school, improve grades,\nand gain a new interest in attending college (SmithBattle,\nDespite the newfound motivation that motherhood may\nimpart, adolescent pregnant and parenting mothers face\nmany structural barriers that limit school and college attain-\nability as well as societal sanctions like stigma and social\ndisgrace (Chumbler, Sanetmatsu, & Parrish-Sprowl, 2014).\nFor instance, some adolescent mothers find themselves with\nlittle social support or preparation for new parenting.\nFurthermore, high schools and colleges often do not have\naffordable child care, which may further discourage atten-\ndance. Competing demands of a new mother post-birth often\nthwart aspirations and lead to more realistic or lowering of\ncareer and vocational related expectations (Hellenga, Aber,\n& Rhodes, 2002). However, not all adolescents exhibit low-\nered expectations. Hellenga et al. (2002) found that young\nmothers with greater access to economic and social resources\npost-birth did not have a lowering of aspirations and expecta-\ntions after childbirth. Early interventions that provide social\nsupport and services such as counseling, child care, and sup-\nport groups may prevent parenting adolescents from lower-\ning their expectations for school and career.\nThe literature suggests conflicting findings regarding\nwhether adolescent motherhood motivates young mothers to\ngraduate high school or attend college or whether it lessens\ntheir educational aspirations (Barr and Simons, 2012). One\nway that researchers have evaluated the effect of adolescent\npregnancy on the lives of young women is by comparing their\neducational and career attainment pre- and post-birth. These\nstudies differentiate between educational and career aspira-\ntions and expectations. Aspirations are desired career goals\ngiven ideal conditions while expectations take into account\nfactors that may hinder reaching one's aspirations (Baly,\n1989). Scholars have also referred to this pairing as \"abstract\"\nversus \"concrete\" attitudes toward education (Barr & Simons,\n2012). For example, SmithBattle found mismatched aspira-\ntions and expectations in their study with adolescent mothers\nhaving both a newfound desire to attend college and conflict-\ning structural factors regarding work or child care responsi-\nbilities that interfered with their ability to do so (SmithBattle\nbetween pregnant and parenting adolescents, but lowered\nexpectations for completing college for parenting adoles-\ncents. Clemmens (2003) referred to this lowering of expecta-\ntions as \"the reality of motherhood brings hardship.\"\nClemmens found that many mothers found motherhood more\ndemanding than they had planned and that child care activi-\nties left little time for themselves. In Rosengard, Pollock,\nWeitzen, Meers, and Phipps's (2006) study of pregnant ado-\nlescents, a prominent theme was that adolescents thought that\npregnancy would require them to put their lives on hold and\nrevise their life goals. This perception occurred 86% of the\ntime with adolescents who had previous children compared\nwith 74% who were pregnant without previous children.\nThe original purpose of the journaling program was part of\na larger project in Lake County, Indiana, that was focused on\ncommunicating health information to pregnant and parenting\nadolescents while also providing participants with a means of\nself-expression (Bute et al., 2014). In Lake County, the teen\nslightly higher than the national average (37.3 in Indiana,\ncompared with 29.4 on average in the United States; Hamilton\net al., 2013). Once the seat of a thriving steel industry, the\nregion was devastated by deindustrialization during the 1970s\nand 1980s and over the past couple of decades has struggled\nwith high rates of crime and unemployment. Studying adoles-\ncent pregnancy in this region of Indiana provides key insights\ninto other low-income urban environments with similar\nsociodemographic composition and fertility patterns.\nTwo of the authors of this article were involved in the design\nand implementation of the journaling project from its begin-\nning. Preliminary analysis of the data (see Bute et al., 2014)\nrevealed that pregnant and parenting adolescents focused many\nof their journal entries on their motivations and aspirations for\na \"better life.\" Their focus provided a unique opportunity to\nCherry et al. 3\nexplore aspirational differences, if any, between pregnant and\nparenting participants. Because the literature reports both nega-\ntive and positive effects related to pregnancy and motherhood,\nand distinguishes between pre- and post-birth women, our\nobjective was to contrast the aspirations of pregnant adoles-\ncents with those of parenting adolescents and to identify the\nstructural and social barriers that both groups of young women\nview as obstacles to achieving their aspirations.\nMethod and Analysis\nDesign\nThis study used journal entries to solicit the voices of preg-\nnant and parenting adolescents. Fifty-two multi-ethnic preg-\nnant and parenting adolescents from Lake County, Indiana,\nparticipated in the journal project. To address adolescent\npregnancy on a local level in the state of Indiana, the Maternal\nand Child Health (MCH) Division of the Indiana State\nDepartment of Health (ISDH) created the Pregnant and\nParenting Adolescent Support Services (PPASS) program to\npromote the development of integrated systems of support\nservices for pregnant and parenting adolescents and their\nfamilies. The journals used in this analysis were part of a joint\ninitiative between PPASS, Indiana University\u00adPurdue\nUniversity Indianapolis (IUPUI), and Empowering Teens As\nParents (ETAP), an agency serving pregnant and parenting\nadolescents in Lake County, Indiana, who were a key com-\nmunity implementation partner and who assisted with recruit-\ning pregnant and parenting adolescents (Bute et al., 2014).\nIn 2011, ISDH and IUPUI conducted research to evaluate\nvarious means of communicating health information to ado-\nlescents on pregnancy, prenatal care, and early parenting.\nJournals were identified as an effective communication tool\nand an outlet for stress. Journaling is also a valid method-\nological means of obtaining data on pregnant and parenting\nadolescents' concerns regarding pregnancy and early parent-\ning (Bute et al., 2014). Journals are an innovative research\nmethod because they allow for real-time reflection during\npregnancy and parenting, which may elicit different\nresponses than interviews conducted at a later date. There is\nalso a certain level of anonymity involved with journal writ-\ning that does not occur during a one-on-one or group inter-\nview. Journaling is associated with a list of benefits, including\ngreater self-awareness and confidence, reduced stress and\nanxiety, improved mood, improved physical health, a better\nunderstanding of major life events, and the development of a\nconduit for improving communication with a counselor (see\nSampling and Recruitment\nThe study sample was purposive and drawn from a list of\nclients at ETAP who were invited by ETAP staff to partici-\npate in the study. The participants were young women aged\n15 to 19. Participation was solicited for both pregnant and\nparenting adolescents. Thirty-one participants were recruited\nstudy participants. The recruitment procedure consisted of\nthe reading of a script to potential participants that described\nthe purpose of the study and what would be expected of\nstudy participants. Each potential participant who wished to\ncontinue provided her signature on an informed consent doc-\nument. Those participants under age 18 signed an informed\nassent form and their parents submitted a signed waiver of\nparental consent. This procedure was approved by the\nInstitutional Review Board (IRB). All participants received a\nUS$25 gift card upon enrollment, and an additional US$25\ngift card upon completion of the project.\nDemographics\nDemographic information was collected from all participants\nand is included in Table 1. The majority of participants were\nbetween the ages of 15 and 17. Hispanic individuals made up\nthe largest portion of our enrolled participants. Sixty-one\npercent of the participants were already parents. The major-\nity of the participants were enrolled as students. Only 25% of\nthe participants were employed in either full- or part-time\nwork. The primary source of income for 67% of the partici-\npants was their parents.\nJournal Composition\nThe journal format was a portable paper binder divided into\nfive sections that included quizzes, writing prompts, draw-\ning exercises, guided journaling, and free journaling. The\nTable 1.

Topics included concerns of day-to-day parenting,\nstress, aspirations, goal setting, and future plans. The jour-\nnals included prompts such as \"Things I like about parent-\ning,\" \"The hardest part of my life . . . , \" and \"I feel strong\nwhen . . .\" as well as free writing sections. The journals\nwere given the name For Real because one of the goals of\nthe journaling project was for the adolescents to have a self-\nreflexive platform to be upfront and honest and to voice\ntheir ideas, emotions, and concerns about pregnancy and\nnew parenthood.\nData Collection\nThe project data consisted of demographic information and\nthe written journals. Journal writing took place over a 6-week\nperiod. For the purpose of this article, we include the demo-\ngraphic data and the journal entries as primary data sources.\nAlthough comparisons between pregnant and parenting ado-\nlescents were not the original focus of this study, aspirations\nregarding school and future career plans were a recurring\ntheme in the journals, prompting us to look deeper into the\ninfluence of the maternal role on educational and vocational\naspirations.\nThe journals were scanned and saved electronically as pdf\nfiles, which were then uploaded into NVivo qualitative data\nanalysis software. Two of the authors (deemed data analysts\nherein) who are trained in ethnographic research methods\nconducted the data analysis. The data analysts used a deduc-\ntive\u00adinductive coding strategy following Paolisso, Weeks,\nand Packard (2013) to create a codebook that they used to\norganize the journal data by themes. The first-level code list\nwas conducted deductively, based on previous thematic anal-\nysis of the data (Bute et al., 2014) and dominant themes pre-\nsented in the literature on pregnant and parenting adolescents.\nThe previous themes that were identified in the journals cre-\nated a preliminary deductive framework, which the data ana-\nlysts used to build the overarching themes of the codebook.\nExamples of these previous themes were \"social support\nsources\" and \"goals and dreams.\" The analysts subsequently\ncreated a second-level codebook based on inductive analysis\nthat captured implicit themes and details that emerged while\nreading a random sample of six journals. The second-level\ncodes expanded upon themes such as \"goals and dreams\"\nwith more detailed codes describing aspirations for complet-\ning school, going to college, or obtaining careers. These\nsecond-level codes were discussed and edited by the two\nanalysts and further refined in cases of disagreement or\nredundancy. The remaining journals were then split equally\nbetween the two analysts and coding was completed on all\n52 journal texts until both the analysts agreed that thematic\nsaturation had been met. The two analysts met on a weekly\nbasis to discuss themes and codes, and as new codes and sub-\ncodes emerged, they were added to the project.\nOnce coding was completed in NVivo, one of the analysts\ngenerated \"matrix queries\" using NVivo to explore similari-\nties and differences in school and career aspirations between\npregnant and parenting adolescents. Query results were used\nby the analysts to identify relevant excerpts from partici-\npants' written responses that represented prominent themes\nacross the journals and that best illustrated similarities and\ndifferences between pregnant and parenting adolescents. The\nparticipant data were divided by the attribute \"pregnant\" or\n\"parenting.\" If a participant was both pregnant and parent-\ning, she was included in the \"parenting\" group. Queries were\nwritten and run on codes of interest such as \"better life\" or\n\"college future\" to look for similarities and differences.\nResults\nAspirations and Positive Motivation Expressed by\nPregnant and Parenting Adolescents\nWe found pregnant and parenting adolescents had similar\naspirations toward finishing school and establishing careers.\nAspirations, which centered on providing a \"better life\" for\nthe baby and long-term goals (initiated by the journal prompt\n\"Five years from now right after I wake up/at noon/at 4:30\np.m./at 8:00 p.m. I will . . . \"), involved finishing high school,\nattending college, starting a career, and establishing financial\nindependence. Long-term goals were often vague and did not\ninclude explicit steps for achievement. Pregnant and parent-\ning adolescents stressed several positive effects of their new\nmaternal role that included positive self-image and confi-\ndence in their abilities. Both pregnant and parenting adoles-\ncents also voiced concern with stigma and competing\ndemands that may ultimately hinder their goals. Results are\nreported according to theme and presented using the terms\n\"pregnant participants\" and \"parenting participants\" herein.\n\"A Better Life for My Baby\"\nBoth pregnant and parenting adolescents aspire to provide a\n\"better life\" for their children and made similar statements\nabout what this means to them. Activities and aspirations\nframed as contributing to a \"better life\" were described as\nspending time with their children, giving their children\neverything they want and need, and being a good role model.\nOne pregnant participant wrote, \"My child will have\neverything I am able to give her.\" In many cases, the \"every-\nthing\" referred to both social and monetary support. For\nexample, one pregnant adolescent wrote, \"I want to get a\ngood job to make money for my baby.\" A parenting partici-\npant wrote she wanted to be able to provide her child with\n\"help, support, and money.\"\nSupport sometimes referred to having both a mother and\nfather present in the child's life. One pregnant participant\nwrote, \"My baby would have everything he ever needed. I\nalso want him to have a mother and a father his whole life.\"\nCherry et al. 5\nFor another parenting participant, the importance of having\nthe father in her baby's life was stressed. She wrote,\nI think that more people and programs need to educate and help\nthe fathers as well and it might make more men become bigger\nrole models in their child's life and make them want to be around\nmore. I believe it might help stop kids from growing up without\ntheir dads around and in their life.\nAnother parenting adolescent wrote,\nI don't feel like my son's father cares for my son as much as he\nshould. He doesn't call or text to ask about him. My son only\nsees him five days out of the month if that.\nOnly about half of the pregnant and parenting adolescents\nin the study wrote about having a supportive partner in their\nlives and this reflects the 41% of children reportedly living in\nsingle-parent households in Lake County (Robert Wood\nJohnson Foundation [RWJF] and University of Wisconsin\nPopulation Health Institute, 2013). Some women voiced\nconcern about the prospect of single parenthood. One parent-\ning adolescent stated, \"How I'm going to raise him on my\nown as a single mother? How will he have the best life pos-\nsible?\" One parenting adolescent said, \"Things that would\nmake parenting easier: A better father in his life.\" Being on\ntheir own without the financial or social support of the baby's\nfather or a partner was a prominent theme when the partici-\npants were discussing barriers to providing a \"better life\" for\ntheir children.\nBoth pregnant and parenting adolescents made references\nto making sure that their children \"got the things that they\nnever got,\" or never received or experienced while growing\nup. One parenting participant wrote about her priority: \"I like\nthat I can teach my son things I never learned.\" Both preg-\nnant and parenting adolescents expressed overwhelming\ndesire for their children to have opportunities and succeed in\nlife. One parenting participant wrote that her greatest desire\nfor herself was \"being able to make sure I become something\nin life.\" School was often included in the participants'\ndescriptions of a \"better life.\" A parenting participant stated,\n\"If I could have anything in the world I would want to have\nmy diploma because I can't make a better life for my child\nwithout school.\"\n\"You Have to Have Diplomas\"\nThe "
