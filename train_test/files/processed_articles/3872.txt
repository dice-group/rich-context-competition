A\nqualitative case study with an ethnographic approach was conducted using semistructured interviews. Six caregivers from\ntwo families of patients with TBI were interviewed to garner description of lay beliefs within a rural community in Oman\nrelated to the experience of family carers with a relative suffering from a brain injury. The caregivers interpreted their\nrelatives' predicament through the local idiom of distress involving belief in spirit infestation and ensorcellment.The present\nqualitative study supports the view that when a family member incurs neurobehavioral impairments, the coping processes\nof the caregivers are heavily influenced by cultural concepts of health and illness. Such attributions are discussed in terms of\nspecific sociocultural forces within Omani society.\n",

In some less\ndeveloped countries (LDCs), on one hand, care for people\nwith traumatic brain injury (TBI) is either nonexistent or still\nat a rudimentary stage of development (Al-Naamani &\nAl-Adawi, 2007). On the other hand, with the advent of\neffective emergency care and acute medical care, deaths\nfrom TBI have decreased, but TBI survivors are left with\nirreversible, intransigent, and debilitating loss of physical,\ncognitive, and psychosocial functioning (Al-Adawi et al.,\n2007). In LDCs, as the burden of care is limited to the family\ncircle, the consequences of the injury not only affect the\nvictim but also that person's entire social network. Similar\ntrends appear to exist even in developed Western countries\n(Simpson, Mohr, & Redman, 2000) where it has been dem-\nonstrated that the role of the family has a significant impact\non the rehabilitative process and its functional prognosis\nSch\u00f6nberger, Ponsford, Olver, & Ponsford, 2010). There is\nevidence to suggest that social support is critically important\nin determining the level of adjustment of the patient/family\nto the situation (Ergh, Hanks, Rapport, & Coleman, 2003;\nGan, Gargaro, Brandys, Gerber, & Boschen, 2010; Janda\nauthors have outlined different and diverse caregiver coping\nprocesses in Western countries for patients with neurobe-\nhavioral impairments. Clinically, significant levels of psy-\nchological distress that mimic symptoms of depression and\nanxiety as well as a preoccupation with prolonged and\nunremitting denial, hysteria, and anger are common occur-\nMachamer, Temkin, & Dikmen, 2002; Ponsford, Olver,\nPonsford, & Nelms, 2003).

Burke2\n Keywords\ncross-cultural, Oman, brain injured, family coping, infestation, ensorcellment\n2 SAGE Open\nThere is a dearth of studies examining how families out-\nside Euro-American populations construct the sequelae of\nneurobehavioral impairment. In collectivistic societies,\nsuch as those often found in many LDCs, cultural pattern-\ning means that difficulties and illnesses are viewed as a\nchallenge to the extended family and the community. One\nof the central tenets of a collectivistic society is to attempt\nto reconstruct the patient's identity by calling the whole\ncommunity to witness and share the misfortune of the dis-\ntressed. This process helps to increase the patient's self-\nvalue and reinforce the patient's relationship with the\ncommunity (Al-Adawi, 1993). The importance of the fam-\nily in the care of relatives has been shown to overcome poor\nprognostic indicators when the community responds to the\ninitial episode of illness by sympathetic acceptance, benev-\nolently protective attention, and assistance in a culturally\nprescribed way. According to Kleinman (1988), cultures,\nin making sense of illness, have clusters of explanatory\nmodels, the lenses through which cultures perceive and under-\nstand illness. Such perceptions have not, to our knowledge,\nbeen reported in the context of acquired brain injury in tradi-\ntional societies around the world. This contrasts with the vast\nliterature that has emerged on the perceptions of psychiatric\nillness (Lewis-Fernandez & Kleinman, 1995).\nAnthropological studies have suggested that a person's\nbehavior or personality can be controlled or possessed by\nspirit in many traditional communities (Al-Adawi, Martin,\nSpirits are invisible forces believed to inhabit the earth and\ninfluence mankind by appearing in the form of humans or\nanimals. In such communities, supernatural forces such as\nJinn, contemptuous envy (Hassad), the envy-related \"eye\"\n(Ain), and sorcery (Sihr) appear to be central to the idiom of\ndistress (Al-Sinawi, Al-Adawi, & Al-Guenedi, 2008) or\n\"explanatory models\" (Kleinman, 1988). It has yet to be\nreported whether such an idiom of distress is also found\namong families of patients with acquired brain injury marked\nwith neurobehavioral impairment. Exploring families' per-\nceptions of their relatives'distress could help to shed light on\nwhat is universal versus what is cultural in coping with such\na misfortune. It could also lay the foundation for future qual-\nitative and quantitative cultural studies on cultural variations\nin the understanding of coping and adaptation mechanisms\nof caregivers of injured relatives. Understanding the breadth\nand depth of how primary caregivers cope with the neuro-\nlogical impairment of their relatives would, in addition, shed\nlight on how disability is conceptualized.\nTo our knowledge, there is no empirical research on the\nresponse of caregivers from Arab/Islamic countries to a\nfamily member who incurs neurological and medical com-\nplications resulting in intransigent cognitive, emotional, and\nbehavioral impairments. The aim of this study is to describe\nthe reactions and adaptation of caregivers in Oman, a coun-\ntry in which the family is still expected to play an important\nrole in social organization using in-depth interviews with\nthree carers of victim or survivor of brain injury.\nOman lies on the eastern side of the Arabian Peninsula,\nand with a population of nearly 3 million, there were 25\ndeaths per 100,000 inhabitants due to accidents and injuries\n(mostly from road traffic accidents) compared with the\nthe population in Oman is estimated to incur disability that\nis precipitated by unintentional injuries and road traffic\naccidents (Al-Naamani & Al-Adawi, 2007). Victims often\nseek acute medical management, but thereafter only limited\nrehabilitation services are available to survivors of brain\ninjury.\nMethod and Context of the Study\nTo capture the experiences of the caregivers of people with\ndisability due to brain Injury in Oman, a qualitative approach\nwas employed to obtain a variety of subjective and sponta-\nneous accounts of caregivers' conceptions of the predica-\nment of their brain-injured relative. The families were\nperiodically interviewed to see how their perceptions of their\nrelative changed over time.\nThe present qualitative study constitutes an extension of a\nprevious study (Al-Adawi et al., 2007) and follows research\nmethodology described elsewhere (Profanter, 2009). In brief,\na qualitative case study approach using in-depth interviews\nwith carers was employed. This has the net benefit of provid-\ning an opportunity to study the phenomenon of interest to\ngain insight into the beliefs and attributions of caregivers of\nsurvivors of brain injury. The value in stories about particu-\nlar people in a specific context is especially useful in Oman\nwhere there is a limited research on such discourse. Such\nundertaking may shed light on intricate mechanism of cer-\ntain behaviors and this, in turn, could illuminate on the over-\nall phenomenon that is specific to certain cultural group\n(Stake, 1995). Such an approach, at face value, being idio-\ngraphic focus, may appear to impinge required rigorous\nresearch methodology but nevertheless lay groundwork\nquantitative study.\nFor the present contest, the employed depth interviews\nfollowed a discussion-type approach where the informants\nwere asked to respond to a variety of open-ended questions\nrelated to themes drawn from the literature (Dejmana et al.,\ncommon denominators of such themes are cultural attribu-\ntions to abrupt personality that entail irrevocable loss of\n\"persona\" of their loved one. Three male family members\nwere interviewed from each family: the father and two broth-\ners. It was taken into consideration that information gather-\ning had to be open ended; this is often viewed as an integral\npart of qualitative studies (Barbour & Kitzinger, 1999). The\nmain areas covered were (a) conceptualization (What is your\nrelative's predicament called?), (b) cause (What do you think\ncaused his problem?), (c) impact (How does his illness affect\nhim and the family?), (d) help-seeking (What kind of treat-\nment did he obtain and why?), and (e) desired treatment\nAl-Adawi et al. 3\noutcome (What is the most important outcome you hope the\ntreatment will provide?).\nThe researcher took detailed notes during the interview,\nnoting long pauses and nonverbal communications when\nthese were thought to be important. The notes were written\nup immediately after the interview. During subsequent inter-\nviews, the areas of inquiry were revisited and new ideas\nnoted. Analysis was done concurrently with data collection\nand iteratively directed data collection on further follow-up\ninterviews as described elsewhere (Watkins, 2010). The data\nwere analyzed using the \"interpretive phenomenological\napproach\" described by Smith, Harre, and Van Langenhove\nwere read several times. Interesting and recurring ideas were\nmarked in addition to striking words and sentences.\nFor this study, there were two sessions of peer review con-\nducted during the stage of analysis. Each peer review session\nincluded both the authors. The peer review meetings sup-\nported the results of the analysis, and there was a great level\nof agreement between the researchers. The three main themes\nthat emerged from the interviews and will be entertained in\nthe ensuing paragraphs are labeled as (a) causal attributions\nand cultural beliefs, (b) attributions and coping (c) coping\nand the health care services.\nThe interviews were conducted by one of the authors\n(Samir Al-Adawi [SA]). Each informant was interviewed 5\ntimes over a period of 1 year, and all interviews took place\nat the informants' home. Before starting the interviews, the\naims, procedures, and duration of the research were\nexplained to the interviewees. They were assured that there\nwas no right or wrong answer rather that their ideas, views,\nand experiences were important contributions to the study.\nEthical permission for the study was granted by local\nInstitutional Review Board.\nResults\nThe interview data are presented as narrative stories of the\npatients, from the perspectives of the caregivers, aiming to\nhighlight the cultural beliefs and attributions of caregivers.\nThis will shed light on the way caregivers view their family\nmember's illness. For brevity, and as the interviews were\nvery long, the case studies are summarized keeping in mind\nthe temporal element of the story.\nCase Study 1:The Possessed\nBB is a 36-year-old Omani man who was rendered uncon-\nscious after falling from a date tree in a rural region of\nOman. The family rushed the survivor to the nearest primary\nhealth clinic where he regained consciousness on arrival.\nAccording to the family, physical examination at the time\nwas unremarkable except for minor skin abrasions. He was\ndischarged home without any further intervention.\nSubsequently, BB complained of headaches and diffused\npain, which was alleviated with simple analgesics. In addi-\ntion, the family noted that BB's personality had changed.\nAccording to them, BB had \"lost himself.\" He was described\nby the family, in biomedical parlance, as emotionally labile,\nerratic, and impulsive. The term that encapsulates his con-\nduct is that equated with adolescence, murahaqa, meaning\nan unmarried person who has reached puberty and is charac-\nterized by high emotionality, impulsivity and a heightened\npreoccupation with sexual temptation (Al-Adawi, 2006).\nConcerned with BB's behavior, the family sought medical\nattention. The physician recommended that the family seek\na psychiatric opinion in the university hospital. This would\nhave required them to travel to an urban area, which the\nprimary caregivers were reluctant to do as they did not think\nthat BB suffered from psychiatric illness, a condition either\nstigmatized or attributed to supernatural causes and in the\nlatter case often considered the prerogative of traditional\nhealers in the rural community. In the family circle, BB's\npersonality change was attributed to various causal agents,\nincluding supernatural forces such as Jinn.\nThe family consulted a traditional healer who \"revealed\"\nto the family that BB had been a \"victim\" of jealousy or the\n\"evil eye.\" The traditional healer's \"diagnosis\" confirmed\nthe family suspicion that it had been a magic spell rather than\nan unfortunate accident that had caused BB to fall and his\npersonality to change. To the family, this seemed more rea-\nsonable because BB had been climbing trees all his life and\nhad never fallen before. The fact that he was a successful\nfarmer further raised the family's suspicion. The traditional\nhealer prescribed an amulet for BB to wear and a potion to be\ndrunk at regular intervals created from water washed over\nselected Koranic verses hand written in charcoal on a wooden\nsurface. Even after this \"treatment,\" BB's erratic behavior\ncontinued. His conduct bewildered and distressed his wife\nwho on several occasions contemplated leaving him and\nreturning to her own family. The wife complained that he\nwas not acting as responsible father any more. He was also\nnoted to be disinhibited. With no apparent sign of recovery,\nBB was taken to another traditional healer. This healer also\nconcluded that BB had been harmed by evil eyes because he\nwas a successful man in the village and therefore likely to be\nthe subject of jealousy. The healer treated him with various\nesoteric verses to ward off evil forces. The relatives, includ-\ning the wife, thought this resulted in a temporary remission\nof his \"abnormal\" behavior.\nAfter 2 months, the family consulted another traditional\nhealer who was known for his \"power\" to tame the Jinn, or\nspirits, and conduct exorcisms. This shamanic healer attrib-\nuted BB's behavior to spirit possession by a Jinn. A cere-\nmony was subsequently organized to exorcise the possessing\nspirit. The purpose of the ceremony was to coerce the\n\"invading spirit\" to reveal why it had chosen to possess BB.\nDuring the ceremony, the healer used his own spirit to\n4 SAGE Open\npossess BB and then used his own spirit to lure the unknown\nspirit out of BB. The healer tried to ascertain the Jinn's iden-\ntity by first questioning BB in vulgar Arabic and then using\na peculiar language known only to the Jinn. When this\nfailed, the healer flogged BB, believing he was actually\nflogging the Jinn. The healer also tried to provoke the Jinn\nto emerge using pleasantries, promises, toughness, and\nthreats. After these attempts failed, the healer attributed\nBB's difficulties to other supernatural forces and magic.\nDespite the failure of the \"treatment,\" BB was said to have\nimproved. Almost 1 year after the accident, the family no\nlonger attributed BB's behavior to Jinn. Rather, they\nbelieved that he had once been possessed, but he was slowly\n\"clearing\" it. The family accepted the idea that BB would\nremain a \"changed\" man. However, they strongly hoped\nthat God would punish whoever had placed the spell on BB,\nand the family decided that BB's presence was a test by God\nfor them to remain strong in the face of adversity. When last\nseen, BB was still impulsive, but it seems that the family has\nlearnt to accommodate his new sense of self.\nCase Study 2:The \"Mu ghayeb\"\nMM is 28-year-old and a father of six children with an unre-\nmarkable medical history until he sustained a TBI following\na road traffic accident. He was living in extended family in a\nrural part of Oman. He never acquired formal education\nalthough he had cursory knowledge of Koran. He lost con-\nsciousness after the accident and was admitted to hospital.\nMM was left with intransigent impairments suggestive of a\nvegetative state. The family was told that MM would be\nlikely to remain dependent on them for his basic care and\nmight never regain his premorbid personality and competen-\ncies. As there is no rehabilitation of such cases in the country,\nthe attending doctor advised the family to seek rehabilitation\noutside of Oman. Such services are only available in Western\nEurope and North America, and it was not financially viable\nfor this particular family to undertake such an intervention.\nAlthough the family of MM appears to have understood\nthat a persistent vegetative state could follow a TBI, the\nfamily believed instead that the real MM had been \"stolen,\"\nand he became a Mu ghayeb, a phenomenon akin to zombi-\nfication that has been reported from Haiti with minor differ-\nences. Although most villagers had heard of someone who\nhad returned to his family after being stolen, no one had\nfirsthand knowledge of such an existence. In contrast, zom-\nbies are often seen in the neighborhood in Haiti (Littlewood\n& Douyon, 1997). The family felt that a magician had\nplaced a spell on MM, converting him into a person lacking\nfree will, soul, or awareness such as zombie. The family\nbelieved that the Mu ghayeb MM was living a shadowy\nexistence, sleeping naked in a cave during the day, and ris-\ning at night to wander about the countryside, feeding on\nleaves, and doing whatever the magician ordered. The family\nclaimed to have seen the Mu ghayeb MM as a wraith-like\nfigure at night approaching the house in disguise as a stray\ndog. At other times, the family claimed to have felt him\n\"intuitively present in the house.\"\nThe family believed that the Mu ghayeb MM could be\nreturned back to them in one of three ways. First, the magi-\ncian might be discovered and killed or destroyed in some\nother way (which could include the magician's natural\ndeath). When a magician dies, all the people he has enthralled\nare freed and will return to their families. Another way to\nfree the enthralled is to find the zombied person wandering\nand overpower him by hitting him on the forehead with a\nstone. Again, this would automatically release him from his\nbewitchment. The final method is to seek a healer to counter-\nact the magician's spell.\nThe family invited a White magician healer to help free\ntheir \"enthralled\" loved one; however, the juju (charm) was\nunsuccessful. MM remained in a vegetative state, and several\nmonths later without any observable change in his function-\ning, MM passed away in his sleep. The death further rein-\nforced the belief that he had been stolen, even after an elaborate\nburial ritual and the prescribed period of mourning.\nDiscussion\nDespite the increased morbidity due to road traffic accidents\nand unintentional injuries globally (Peden, McGee, & Krug,\n2002), very little has been documented on how primary\ncaregivers of injured relatives cope with this disability.\nBrain injury imposes a large emotional and psychological\nburden on primary caregivers of injured relatives regardless\nof their sociocultural background (Cavallo & Saucedo,\n1995). In Western populations, the family members who are\nresponsible for their injured relative's care tend to be in an\n\"emotional paradox\" when the life of a previously healthy\nindividual is irrevocably altered (Tzidkiahu, Sazbon, &\nwhile the disabled may not even realize that anything has\nhappened to him or her, the family may go through the bur-\nden and distress of \"burying\" the person they previously\nknew and trying to develop a relationship with a new and\nless affable stranger. To our knowledge, no study has\nreported how primary caregivers of the injured relative cope\nwith neurobehavioral impairment in the Arab world.\nTheme 1: Causal Attributions and Cultural Beliefs\nAs the above case studies suggest, traditional beliefs on\ncausative factors of the injury are reached for and healing\npractices and rituals performed. The prevailing tendency\namong Omanis is to explain the change in their relative by\nthe existence of sensate agents who have cast a spell on the\nvictim rather than thinking that the TBI has transformed\ntheir loved one. Thus, the accident and its sequelae are\nascribed to spirit infestation or ensorcellment (Al-Adawi,\nBurjorjee, & Al-Issa, 1997). These beliefs are consistent\nAl-Adawi et al. 5\nwith how distress is experienced in this culture. In traditional\nOmani society, illness, stress, and distress are attributed to\nnatural factors, supernatural influences, or a combination of\naccident sustained in these two cases might appear to be\n\"naturally\" caused, the family believed that the accident was\nthe result of the active, vengeful intervention of anthropo-\nmorphic beings conjured up by a malicious and envious\nperson. Someone was jealous of the alleged success of these\ntwo people, and thus, they became the victims of aggression\nand punishment. In Euro-American psychology, such an\nexplanatory model is indicative of an \"external locus of con-\ntrol.\" Individuals with an external locus of control believe\nthat events are determined by outside forces in contrast to\nthe biomedical model where the emphasis is on the interplay\nbetween biology and socialization. Thus, caregivers in\nOman attribute neurobehavioral impairment to external fac-\ntors. In the present example from Oman, the external locus\nof control manifested as a belief in spirit infestation and\nensorcellment. This is consistent with the view in Oman that\nmisadventures are likely to be perceived as originating from\nexternal forces or due to person\u00adsociety disjunctions. If such\nviews were substantiated after further scrutiny, it could be\nconcluded that the major socializing force, Islam, as prac-\nticed by the common person, is considerably modified by\nlocal folk beliefs (Al-Adawi et al., 1997). This negates the\nfallacy of a regional, Muslim personality type and the idea\nthat life of many Muslims is strongly dictated by Islam.\nChallenges of life are foreordained in Islam. Islam means\ntotal submission to God. This implies that attributing the\npredicaments of life to other than God's will is to question\nTheme 2:Attributions and Coping\nThe question remains how adaptive to coping with disability\nare these culturally sanctioned beliefs and practices of Omani\ncaregivers? Studies from different parts of the world suggest\nthat in many traditional societies, people who are unable to\ncare for themselves (the disabled, diseased, or mentally ill) are\nnot seen as \"ill,\" instead they are considered to be possessed\nor to have been affected by unnatural events such as evil eyes\nor simply be the victim of a magical spell often tied to a social\nrelationship (Al-Adawi, 1993). As a corollary to this, it has\nbeen suggested that the chronic course of some diseases may\nbe eased if the sufferer's difficulties are attributed to such\nforces as possession as this is likely to create culturally pre-\nscribed sympathetic acceptance, attention, and assistance\n(Al-Adawi et al., 2002). Contained in the reaction of the care-\ngivers is the idea of being able to make the lost one return, by\noverpowering the magician, exorcising the bad spirit, or find-\ning, seizing, and rescuing the \"stolen individual\" from captiv-\nity or possession. This shadowy figure of evil thus forms a\nfocus for the expression and projection of hostile feelings. As\nresearch on stress has shown, when the \"reality\" becomes a\nburden to bear, an angry emotional reaction can be a benefi-\ncial coping mechanism (Horowitz, 1979). This may allow the\nindividual, gradually and perhaps more naturally, to come to\nterms with adverse events.\nTheme 3: Coping and the Health\nCare Services\nCould such \"exotic\" reactions like belief in spirit posses-\nsion and bewitchment represent an adaptation to the lack of\nessential rehabilitation services for survivors of TBI? In\nother words, if proper interventions existed, would the\ncaregivers have manifested a similar reaction? In a recent\nsurvey of the world health care system, the World Health\nOrganization ranked Oman as the most \"efficient\" health\ncare system in the world in terms of outcome (Jamison &\nSandbu, 2001). This system, as in other low-income coun-\ntries, is often geared toward the eradication of infectious\ndisease and malnutrition, and medical intervention for\naccident victims. The latter tends to reducing mortality but\ndoes not provide supportive follow-up care. Thus, survi-\nvors of brain injury in Oman are often left without other\nsupport than that of family caregivers. It is possible that if\nadequate interventions were available for victims of neu-\nrobehavioral impairment, this would not only reduce the\nimpact of disability but would also provide a venue for the\ncaregivers to be informed about the sequelae and severity\nof acquired brain injury.\nStudies conducted elsewhere have suggested that patients'\nviews of pain and suffering are diametrically opposed to the\nmodern biomedical view (Al-Sinawi & Al-Adawi, 2006). As\nan extension of this finding, this study reports how primary\ncaregivers are coping with disability of injured relatives in\nOman. In Oman, the caregivers attributed the distress of their\nloved ones to infestation and ensorcellment. It is worthwhile\nto note that for the doctor, the neurobehavioral impairment is\nsimply an adverse reaction triggered by the accident. The\nirreconcilable and opposing views of laypersons and profes-\nsionals are likely to hinder these two parties from mutual\nagreement on the etiology, treatment, and prognostic indica-\ntors of the patients. This may lead to poor medical outcomes\nas the patients and the relatives are not likely to adhere to the\ntreatment plan. This can further diminish patient satisfaction\nand negatively affect the quality of the patient's life. These\ntwo examples from Oman illustrate that the caregivers may\nnot even seek biomedical care because this type of distress is\nperceived to the prerogative of traditional healers. As\nPonsford et al. (2003) pointed out, \"Agreat deal can be learnt\nfrom the values, attributes and coping styles\" (p. 466) of\ninjured relatives and their families. Understanding how care-\ngivers deal with their neurologically impaired relative will\nhave a direct bearing on the doctor\u00adpatient relationship, and\non which would be the most cost-effective and culturally\nsensitive interventions. The long period of health care spe-\ncialist training and the unique acculturation process of the\n6 SAGE Open\ntraining all along Western biomedical lines leaves practitio-\nners in non-Western societies disconnected from the very\nsocieties in which they are expected to provide health care\nand alienated from the ethical values of their own societies.\nThis means that many health care providers in developing\ncountries are incapable of communicating with their\npatients whose views on health and illness are incompatible\nor incongruent with the biomedical model. As health care\npractitioners tend to receive little training in cross-cultural\nclinical communication, this creates a communication\ndisjunction in health care delivery with significant ramifi-\ncations on cost-effectiveness and efficiency. Understanding\nthe traditional conception of illness or distress would help\npractitioners communicate effectively with patients and\ntheir families. Recognizing the cultural variations in coping\nwith neurological impairment would delineate what consti-\ntutes adaptive responses for the caregivers and also lead to\nculturally sensitive interventions for caregivers such as\nproviding the right information to help them cope better\nwith caring for an injured relative.\nLimitations\nIt is essential to highlight some of the obvious limitations of\nthe present study. Being a qualitative study, the results of\nthis study cannot be generalized to the whole Omani popu-\nlation as the aim was to gather in-depth information.\nAlasuutari (1995) recommended that we replace the term\ngeneralization with extrapolation to explain how the study\nof one case relates to other cases and to the nature of the\nphenomenon. In this way, case studies can help us test the\nlimits of our existing understanding and allow us to develop\nor modify theories to explain occurrences. Nevertheless,\nfurther studies on this topic with a larger sample size and\nmore robust research methodology would be essential to\nincrease the generalizability of the findings. The other main\nissue with the method remains the use of two case studies\nwithout much contextual data and details, and interviewing\nonly male family carers. It is possible that women who are\noften limited to domestic sphere are likely to be shielded\nfrom intruding eyes of outside; more studies taking onboard\nwomen's potential attitudes or experiences need to be con-\nsidered in the future study. On this ground, present informa-\ntion that has gender gap may lead to an uncomfortable\nsuggestion about homogeneity of beliefs and practices\nwithin this rural community in Oman about illness/distress\nin general and brain injury in particular.\nConclusion\nThis article explores the coping strategies of caregivers in\nOman whose loved ones have sustained brain injury result-\ning in cognitive, emotional, and behavioral problems. In-depth\ninterviews provided the foundation for understanding their\nexperiences and suggested that cultural factors, which pro-\nduce specific interpretations of the predicament of their\nrelative, influence their coping behaviors. In this age of\ncultural relativism, such a coping mechanism may appear to\nborder on collective delusion and therefore may be deemed\npathological. In this age of cultural relativism and within\nOman's social-cultural lances, belief in spirit infestation\nand ensorcellment appear to be culturally sanctioned adap-\ntive responses for coping with difficult situation triggered\nby traumatic brain injury.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAl-Adawi, S.
