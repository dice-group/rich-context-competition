    "abstract": "Abstract\nInterpersonal trust of Japanese and Americans was investigated using two methods: a General Trust Questionnaire and\na scenario judgments task, in which participants were asked to rate how strongly they trust a target person in a series of\nvignettes. Participants were grouped into two conditions, with the target person being either an in-group member or an out-\ngroup member. The purposes of this study were to investigate whether Americans have a higher level of trust than Japanese\ndo, to test the in-group hypothesis which predicts that the difference in trust between the two conditions is greater for\nJapanese than for Americans and the dialectical thought hypothesis which predicts that the correlation between the General\nTrust Questionnaire score and the scenario judgments task score would only occur in the Americans' data. The study, which\nwas conducted with American (n = 105) and Japanese (n = 102) participants, found no differences in the trust level between\nAmericans and Japanese in both methods. The results did not support the in-group hypothesis, but did support the dialectical\nthought hypothesis, indicating that Japanese are more dialectical in judging how they trust others.\n",

Nearly all forms of positive social interactions involve\nsome degree of trust in others to cooperate or to at least not\ninterfere in one's actions unnecessarily. Social science\nresearch on the social functions of trust have been increasing\ntrust as a key factor in reducing frictions in society has been\nincreasingly recognized.\nThe focus of the current research is on cultural differences\nin the degree of trust, in particular between American and\nJapanese cultures. Yamagishi and Yamagishi (1994) found\nthat Americans trusted others more than Japanese did, based\non questionnaires to measure the tendency of trusting other\npeople (the General Trust Questionnaire). They proposed\nthat this result could be due to the role of trust in these societ-\nies; Japanese society is characterized as involving more\nmutual assurance and therefore interpersonal trust is less\nimportant, whereas American society utilizes mutual assur-\nance less and hence a baseline assumption of trust is more\nimportant for effective social interactions. This idea is poten-\ntially related to the distinction between Western individualist\nculture and Eastern collectivist culture.According to Triandis\n(1995), individualism is defined as a social pattern in which\npeople view themselves as independent of collectives and\ngive priority to their personal goals over the goals of their\ngroup, whereas collectivism is defined as a social pattern in\nwhich people see themselves as parts of one or more collec-\ntives and give priority to the goals of these collectives over\ntheir own personal goals.\nTo explore whether levels of trust and the individualism/\ncollectivism distinction are related,Yamagishi andYamagishi\n(1994) focused on the in-group bias effect as an assay of cul-\ntural variation. In-group bias is the preferential treatment\npeople give to those whom they perceive to be members of\ntheir own group (Tajfel, 1970), and such a bias helps to pro-\nmote in-group harmony, which is an important goal in a col-\nlectivist culture. Yamagishi and Yamagishi found that\nJapanese had a stronger in-group bias than Americans and\nproposed that, because the target persons in the questionnaire\nof general trust were likely to be regarded as strangers (out-\ngroup members), this led to the degree of general trust being\nlower for Japanese than for Americans. We name this expla-\nnation the in-group bias hypothesis (e.g., Yamagishi, Jin, &\n1Omron Healthcare Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan\n2Kansas State University, Manhattan, USA\n3Osaka City University, Osaka, Japan\nCorresponding Author:\nHiroshi Yama, Graduate School of Literature and Human Sciences, Osaka\nTwo Methods to Measure the Level of\nTrust of Americans and Japanese: A\nCross-Cultural Study\nHiromi Yamaguchi1, Gary L. Brase2, and Hiroshi Yama3\n Keywords\ntrust, culture, dialecticism\n2 SAGE Open\nHowever, the results that Americans trust others more\nthan Japanese have not been consistently replicated. For\nexample, the study by Yuki, Maddux, Brewer, and Takemura\n(2005), which argued for the importance of both self-\nconstrual and in-group bias, found opposite results in com-\nparing Japanese with Americans. Their position was that\nAmericans, who have independent self-construal, are more\nsensitive to the categorical distinction between in group and\nout group, and thus Americans trust in-group members more\nthan out-group members. Japanese, in contrast, have a more\ninterdependent self-construal and are more sensitive to rela-\ntions between themselves and others and hence trust people\nwho have stronger relations with themselves. Their results\nsupported this hypothesis and did not find that Americans\ntrusted others more than Japanese did.\nOne of the reasons for the nonrobustness of the cultural\ndifference in trust may be the reference-group effect. As\nHeine, Lehman, Peng, and Greenholtz (2002) point out, it is\nvery plausible that the method of using questionnaires is sus-\nceptible to the reference-group effect. When people are asked\nto rate how much they trust others, they assume the imagined\nstandard of the group to which they belong. Hence, although\nthey are encouraged to make an absolute judgment, they are\nvery likely to estimate their attitude referring to their own\ngroup. In the case of a cross-cultural study, it is very plausi-\nble that people refer to the group of their own country.\nTherefore, even if there is an actual cultural difference in the\ndegree of trusting others, this difference may not appear in\nquestionnaire data.\nTo solve this problem, we utilized not only the General\nTrust Questionnaire but an additional method to measure\nlevels of trust for Americans and Japanese. Hayashi and\nYosano (2005) used both a questionnaire and an imaged\nscene method, but only for Japanese participants. In the\nimaged scene method of Hayashi and Yosano (2005), the\nparticipants were asked to judge the probability that a target\nperson would not cheat in a social exchange context vignette.\nThis \"scenario judgments\" task, initially developed by\nKosugi and Yamagishi (1998), is assumed to measure how\nmuch people trust others. However, Hayashi and Yosano\n(2005) found that the scores of the questionnaire and the rat-\ning from the scenario judgments task were not significantly\ncorrelated with each other.\nA possible reason for this nonsignificant correlation may\nbe Easterners' tendency toward dialectical thinking. For\nexample, Peng and Nisbett (1999) found that Chinese were\nless sensitive than Americans to inconsistency in proverbs\nand proposed that Easterners' thinking is more dialectical.\nEasterners'tendency toward dialecticism has also been found\nin self-esteem (Spencer-Rodgers, Peng, Wang, & Hou, 2004)\nand in self-concept (Spencer-Rodgers, Boucher, Mori, Wang,\n& Peng, 2009). It is therefore plausible that Easterners have\nthis tendency in the realm of trust. This would predict that\nthey are more likely to have dialectical views on their ten-\ndency to trust others. For example, it is plausible that, even if\nJapanese believe that they trust others, they do not actually\ndo so, and vice versa. We call this the dialectical thought\nhypothesis.\nThe second possible reason for the nonsignificant correla-\ntion is the difference in target person between the two mea-\nsures. It is assumed that the targets are strangers in the\nGeneral Trust Questionnaire (Yamagishi & Yamagishi,\n1994). However, it is unclear whether the target person in the\nscenario judgments task is an out-group member or an in-\ngroup member (Hayashi & Yosano, 2005). Hence, it is plau-\nsible that some participants regarded the target person in the\nvignette as an in-group member and thus the correlation was\nlow. Therefore, we set two conditions for the scenario judg-\nments task. One version of the scenario judgments task clari-\nfies that the target person is an in-group member (the in-group\ncondition), whereas the other version indicates that the target\nperson is an out-group member (the out-group condition).\nWe do not intend to test the full self-construal hypothesis of\nYuki et al. (2005), but we focus on the effect of asking par-\nticipants to rate trust for relation-based in-group members\n(you and the target person are old and good friends) versus\ntrust for relation-based out-group members. We predict that\nthe correlations of the scores between the General Trust\nQuestionnaire and the scenario judgments task will be higher\nin the out-group condition.\nThe key goals of the present study were to examine the\ncultural difference in trust between Americans and Japanese\nusing two methods to measure the degree of trust and to test\nthe in-group bias hypothesis and the dialectical thought\nhypothesis. If the reference-group effect on the General Trust\nQuestionnaire hides a cultural difference in trust, we expect\na cultural difference will appear when using the scenario\njudgments task. The two conditions in the scenario judg-\nments task make it possible to test the in-group bias hypoth-\nesis. According to this, the difference in trust levels between\nAmericans and Japanese should be greater in the out-group\ncondition than in the in-group condition. Specifically,\nJapanese trust of an out-group target should be less than that\nof Americans. Furthermore, the correlation in score between\nthe scenarios judgments task and the General Trust\nQuestionnaire should be higher in the out-group condition.\nFinally, according to the dialectical thought hypothesis, the\nmore dialectical thinking of Japanese participants will pro-\nduce a lower correlation between the scenario judgments\ntask and the General Trust Questionnaire, as compared with\nAmericans.\nMethod\nParticipants and Design\nA total of 105 American students at Kansas State University\nage\ndents at Bukkyo University, Kobe College, and Kyoto\nage\nYamaguchi et al. 3\nthis experiment. Participants within each culture were ran-\ndomly assigned to one of the two experimental conditions,\nthus creating a 2 (Target: in group, out group) \u00d7 2 (Nationality:\nJapanese, American) design. The number of participants in\neach condition is shown in Table 1.\nMaterials\nMaterials were printed in booklets, which consisted of demo-\ngraphic information, the scenario trust judgments task, and a\nGeneral Trust Scale (see Appendix B).1 The scenario judg-\nments task consisted of six scenarios, which were originally\nused in Kosugi and Yamagishi (1998) and Hayashi and\nYosano (2005). All these scenarios described a person who is\nfaced with taking an action that corresponds to either demon-\nstrating or violating trust and asks the participant to estimate\nthe probability that he will do the action or not by marking a\nnumber along a horizontal line from 0% to 100% (see full\ntext in Appendix A). Half of the scenarios ask participants to\nestimate the probability the person would violate the other\nperson's trust, and the remaining scenarios ask the probabil-\nity the person would fulfill the other person's trust. Scores\nwere calculated by reverse scoring the violation-type sce-\nnarios and then averaging the responses. A sentence was\nadded at the top of each scenario to indicate whether the tar-\nget person was an in-group member (\"Imagine that you and\nMr. A are old and good friends\") or an out-group member\n(\"Imagine an ordinary person named Mr. A, about whom you\nknow nothing at all beyond the following information\").\nWe used the questionnaire measuring personal trust which\nwas modified from the original version of Yamagishi and\nversion was shown to be more reliable. Participants answered\neach question on a 10-point scale, ranging from not at all to very\nmuch, and these responses were averaged for an overall score.\nFor all the materials, the original stimuli were written in\nJapanese and then translated into English for American par-\nticipants. A back-translation procedure was then used to con-\nfirm that both Japanese and English versions were equivalent.\nProcedure\nParticipants in both cultures were run in classroom environ-\nments, with each person given a booklet to complete and\nample time for completion. American participants were\ngiven credit toward completion of a course requirement. The\nsections of the booklet were in the order presented above,\nand participants were debriefed after they completed the\nstudy.\nResults\nMean general trust scores for Japanese and Americans par-\nticipants are shown in Table 1. There was no significant dif-\nference between the nationalities on general trust scores\nfor each nationality (sorted by target condition) are also\nshown in Table 1 along with reliability coefficients (alpha\nvalues). A 2 (Target) \u00d7 2 (Nationality) ANOVA found a\nthis effect was not statistically significant, the direction of\nthe result was that Japanese trusted people more than\nAmericans. These were the opposite of the results that\nYamagishi and Yamagishi (1994) reported. Neither the main\neffect of target--in-group versus out-group member: F(1,\nwas significant.\nTable 2 shows the correlations between the scenario\njudgments measures and general trust scores of Japanese\nand American participants. Consistent with the results of\nHayashi and Yosano (2005), the Japanese data showed no\nsignificant correlations between the scenario judgments\nmeasures and the general trust score. The American data,\nhowever, show a totally different result from that of the\nJapanese results. The correlations between the general trust\nscore and the scenario judgment measures were positive and\nsignificant.\nTable 1.

Standard deviation for each group is shown in parentheses after the mean.\nTable 2. Correlations Among the Scores on the Scenario\nJudgments Task and the General Trust Score for Japanese and for\nAmericans.\nScenario judgments\n In group Out group Total\n4 SAGE Open\nIn addition, we analyze the data taking gender into con-\nsideration as a variable. Because gender differences are not\nvery important in this field and the ratios of males and\nfemales were not 1:1, this analysis is supplementary. A 2\n(Nationality) \u00d7 2 (Gender) ANOVA was conducted for gen-\neral trust score, but neither the main effect of nationality,\nwas significant. A 2 (Target) \u00d7 2 (Nationality) \u00d7 2 (Gender)\nANOVA was conducted for rating on the scenario judgment.\nThe main effect of nationality was significant, F(1, 199) =\n5.52, p < .05. The mean rating of Japanese was higher than\nthat of Americans. The main effect of gender was significant,\nhigher than that of male. Neither the main effect of target,\ninteraction between target, nationality, and gender,\nshown on Table 2 were also figured out in each of male and\nfemale data set, but each pattern of correlations was almost\nthe same as that on Table 2.\nDiscussion\nThis study deals with one inconsistency in prior studies and\ntwo hypotheses about human trust. First, do Americans have\nhigher levels of trust than Japanese? Although Yamagishi\nnot. The present research found few significant differences in\neither general trust or scenario judgments of trust across\nthese cultures, except for within the exploratory analysis\nincluding gender. If anything, the present data suggest that\nJapanese may trust people slightly more than Americans.\nBecause the reference-group effect is expected to be smaller\nfor the scenario judgment task measure, these results indicate\nthat the lack of cultural difference in general trust is not\nbecause of a reference-group effect (Heine et al., 2002) but\nrather because the difference does not exist (or is very small\nat best). We are uncertain as to why we found these conflict-\ning results. One possible answer is that cultural differences in\ntrust may not be strongly related to any stable differences\nbetween Easterners and Westerners and that how strongly\npeople trust strangers is susceptible to incentive structures\nthat are easily changeable (e.g., Yamagishi, Terai, Kiyonari,\nMifune, & Kanazawa, 2007). In other words, trust of strang-\ners may be more a function of opportunity costs (such as lost\nprofits) that may occur due to unnecessary distrust. In the\ntwo decades since some of the previous studies were con-\nducted, it is plausible that opportunity costs have increased\ndue to changes in the economic system of Japan.\nThe in-group hypothesis was not supported by the sce-\nnario judgments task results. Because we did not find an\noverall cultural difference in trust between Americans and\nJapanese, we may not need any hypothesis to explain this\nresult. The results on the scenario judgments task, neverthe-\nless, clearly show that the difference in rating between the\nin-group condition and the out-group condition is not greater\nfor Japanese.\nHowever, the dialectical thought hypothesis was strongly\nsupported. The correlations between the general trust score\nand the scenario judgments task measures were very low for\nthe Japanese data, but they were quite high (and statistically\nsignificant) for the American data. One explanation for this\nresult, which was predicted a priori, is that Japanese partici-\npants were more likely to engage in dialectical thinking\nwhile answering these questions and this tendency led to the\nlack of correlation. This result and explanation should be\ntempered with some caution, though, because the reliability\nof the scenario judgment task measure is questionable.\nWhereas the General Trust Questionnaire had a solid reli-\nability coefficient (.82 for the Japanese sample, which inci-\ndentally indicates that their thinking was not entirely\ndialectical across the items in this questionnaire), the sce-\nnario judgments task had low reliability (.45 to .66). This\ncould be due to a few different causes. For instance, one pos-\nsibility is that the scenarios in this scale are not perceived as\nbeing uniformly about the same type of trust situation. This\nis an issue for further research.\nAnother consideration is that the dialectical thought\nhypothesis is not essential to explain how people trust others.\nIt was proposed to explain the nonsignificant correlation\nbetween the General Trust Questionnaire score and the sce-\nnario judgments task rating found by Hayashi and Yosano\n(2005). However, it also suggests further implications for\nconducting questionnaire research on psychological charac-\nteristics of Japanese. For example, Miyamoto and Ryff\n(2011) found that Japanese have more dialectical emotions\nsuch as experiencing both positive and negative emotions\nthan Americans. Their results suggest that the tendency of\ndialecticism among Easterners is not limited to situational\ninferences and may extend to topics such as experienced\nemotions. Eastern dialecticism may also manifest with the\ncontext of in-group favoritism, which is more dominant in\nEasterners than in Westerners. Ma-Kellams, Spencer-\nRodgers, and Peng (2011) reported that Chinese showed both\nin-group favoritism and in-group derogation and concluded\nthat it was because of the dialecticism of Easterners. These\nresults are somewhat at odds with the common claim that\nEasterners, who are in a more collectivist culture, have (only)\na stronger in-group bias.\nThere is another possible reason for the significant corre-\nlations between general trust and the scenario judgments\nonly in the Americans' data. There may be differences in the\nna\u00efve concept of trust between Americans and Japanese. The\nscenarios used in this experiment were constructed based on\nsocial exchanges, and it is plausible that Americans view\ntheir general trust as being based on the social exchange. It\nmay be the case that Japanese have a concept of trust that is\nnot solely based on the social exchange, although it remains\nYamaguchi et al. 5\nunclear what the additional considerations would be. This\nissue should be addressed in future studies. Finally, a remark\nto be mentioned is that the ratios of males to females were\nnot 1:1 in our samples. Therefore, there is a risk that our\nresults cannot strongly be generalized. Gender differences in\ntrust have not been dealt with intensively, but for by some\nauthors. For example, Buchan, Croson, and Solnick (2008)\nreported that women trusted more in economic games than\nmen. Our data of rating on the scenario judgment were com-\npatible with their results. The gender differences should be\naddressed in other future studies.\nAppendix A\nScenarios Used in This Study\nScenario 1\nHe runs a restaurant and he owes Mr. B $100,000, with inter-\nest, as funds for opening the restaurant. Mr. B lent this money\nas a personal loan, without drawing up a signed acknowledg-\nment of a debt officially. Mr. A intends to pay it back to Mr.\nB on a 10-year installment plan, and he has already paid back\npassed away. So, Mr. A should pay back the remaining\n$10,000 to Mr. B's son now. However, Mr. B's son is work-\ning in a company overseas, and he doesn't know anything\nabout his father's loan to Mr. A.\nPlease estimate the probability that Mr. A does not pay\nback the remaining $10,000 to Mr. B's son and just keeps\nthe money for himself.\nScenario 2\nMr. C went to a hamburger shop to have a meal, and he\nordered several hamburgers which cost about $25. As he was\npaying the bill, he noticed that the waiter (a trainee without\nmuch experience) miscalculated the bill as only $15.\nPlease estimate the probability that Mr. C will point out the\nwaiter's mistake.\nScenario 3\nWhile Mr. D was in his car and waiting for a traffic light\nto change, a car behind him bumped into his car. Both Mr.\nD and the other driver were unhurt, but a back-up light on\nMr. D's car was damaged. The other driver, who caused\nthe car accident, told Mr. D that he will pay to repair the\ndamage without involving his insurance. It just so hap-\npens that the rear bumper on Mr. D's car had a certain flaw\nbefore the accident, and the whole bumper could be fixed\nfor an additional $500. Mr. D could include the payment\nto fix the bumper flaw (the problem for which the other\ndriver is not responsible) in the total amount of damage\ncompensation and the other driver would not know about\nit.\nPlease estimate the probability that Mr. D does not ask the\nother driver for the entire payment for the broken\nbumper.\nScenario 4\nWhile traveling, Mr. E stayed in a hotel for a week. When he\nchecked out of the hotel a front desk clerk misunderstood the\ndays of his stay and asked for a payment of $360, which was\nmuch cheaper than the full charge for a week's stay. If Mr. E\npays that price, he will not be asked to pay the rest of the\nmoney.\nPlease estimate the probability that Mr. E only pays $360\nand pretends that he did not recognize the clerk's\nmistake.\nScenario 5\nMr. F just bought a set of tableware for about $30 from a\nmail-order company, but he carelessly dropped and broke it.\nAccording to the mail-order regulations, customers can\nreturn and exchange goods if they happen to get broken\ngoods or receive goods that are different from the ordered\nones. Of course, customers cannot do so if they break them\nby themselves after receiving the shipment. However, Mr. E\nkept the delivery box, and it is possible for him to pretend\nthat the tableware was broken during the mailing. So if Mr. E\nsends the tableware back to the mail-order firm, he may be\nable to get a new set of tableware.\nPlease estimate the probability that Mr. F tries to exchange\nthe tableware that he broke himself by pretending that it\nbroke during delivery.\nScenario 6\nMr. G runs a coffee shop, and he once borrowed a painting\nfrom Mr. H to decorate the shop with. They didn't draw any\nsigned "
