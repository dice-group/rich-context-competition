    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: In this paper we examine educational disparities in mortality and life expec-\ntancy among non-Hispanic blacks and whites in the 1980s and 1990s. Despite increased\nattention and substantial dollars directed to groups with low socioeconomic status, within\nrace and gender groups, the educational gap in life expectancy is rising, mainly because of\nrising differentials among the elderly. With the exception of black males, all recent gains in\nlife expectancy at age twenty-five have occurred among better-educated groups, raising ed-\nucational differentials in life expectancy by 30 percent. Differential trends in smoking-\nrelated diseases explain at least 20 percent of this trend. [Health Affairs 27, no. 2 (2008):\nDisparities in mortality and morbidity across U.S. educational\ngroups have been prevalent for decades. Attention to these disparities in-\ntensified with Evelyn Kitagawa and Philip Hauser's comprehensive na-\ntional account of educational mortality differentials in 1973, and a wave of related\ndisparities research followed.1 Heartened by early successes in the Healthy People\n2000 initiative to reduce disparities in health care and health outcomes, the\nHealthy People 2010 initiative aims to eliminate health disparities entirely by the\nend of this decade. Groups such as the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and many pri-\nvate organizations have also promoted this agenda.2 In 2003, the Agency for\nHealthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) produced its first annual National\nHealthcare Disparities Report to track racial and socioeconomic disparities in health\nand health care.3\nn Health interventions directed at disparities.

Well-\nknown examples include the Medicare disproportionate-share hospital (DSH) pro-\ngram ($12.9 billion annually) and the State Children's Health Insurance Program\n(SCHIP) and related Medicaid expansions ($7 billion annually).4 In addition, much\nof the $6.6 billion annual budget for the Health Resources and Services Administra-\ntion (HRSA) targets disadvantaged populations via funding for community health\ncenters and the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE)\nprogram for HIV/AIDS. The current wave of state initiatives to expand health insur-\nance coverage explicitly targets children and adults with low socioeconomic status\n(SES). Finally, efforts to improve public health promotion and disease prevention\nactivities have expanded over time, with a particular focus on risk factors that are\nprevalent among populations with low SES: tobacco use, obesity, and underuse of\npreventive and screening services.5\nn Recent research. Recent research on racial disparities demonstrates mortal-\nity gains for blacks relative to whites during the 1990s, but data on education-related\ndisparities in mortality are not comprehensive.6 Most research measuring such dis-\nparities ends in the 1980s. These studies show widening differences in mortality by\neducation attainment.7 Many of the programs noted above postdate that era, how-\never. More recent evidence focuses on area-level disparities.8 But major migration\nand demographic changes mean that area-level analyses may understate or overstate\nthe full extent of health disparities at the individual level. Another large study after\nsingle decade.9 Furthermore, analyses of death by cause can augment our under-\nstanding of education-related disparities in mortality because some causes of death\nare more amenable to intervention than others, suggesting different policy ap-\nproaches to ameliorate disparities.10\nIn this study we analyzed life expectancy and mortality trends by education\ngroup and then estimated which diseases account for differential trends.\nStudy Data And Methods\nn Data sources. We used two different sources of data to estimate mortality\ntrends. We matched census population estimates to death certificate data in the\nple of deaths makes the MCD attractive, but there are questions about the accuracy\nof education reporting on death certificates.12 To validate these data and to assess an\nearlier time period, we used the National Longitudinal Mortality Study (NLMS),\nwhich followed members of the March Current Population Survey (CPS) through\nmortality rates in the NLMS are below those in the MCD, which includes all deaths.\nWe restricted analyses to non-Hispanic blacks and whites, to limit the impact of im-\nmigration on our estimates.14\nC h a n g e s I n M o r t a l i t y\nH E A LT H A F F A I R S ~ Vo l u m e 2 7, N u m b e r 2 3 5 1\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

NLMS and U.S. census respondents report educa-\ntion, while informants, usually next of kin, report education on death certificates.\nPrevious studies document some inconsistencies between these methods--in par-\nticular, overstatement of high school graduation relative to incomplete high school\nexperience on death certificates.15 As a result, we chose two broad categories of edu-\ncation where agreement is high: low education, which refers to twelve or fewer years\nof education; and high education, which indicates at least thirteen years of school-\ning. This cutoff yielded the following shares of high-education people in our study:\nBecause rising educational attainment over time could affect our results, we re-\ncomputed estimates after equalizing the shares in the high- and low-education\ngroups. We did this by randomly reassigning some people with twelve years of ed-\nucation to the high-education group in the early period to match education shares\nin the latter period. The patterns we documented are robust to the changing com-\nposition within education groups.16\nn Mortality rates and life expectancy. For a given age-race-sex-education\nthe number of deaths by the group's population to compute age-specific mortality\nrates. These were calculated for ages 25\u00ad84, since most education is completed by\nage twenty-five and few NLMS participants survived beyond age eighty-four. To in-\ncorporate mortality after that age, we assigned published death rates within age-\nsex-race groups.17 Period life expectancy was then constructed in the usual way.18\nleading causes of death: diseases of the heart, cancers, cerebrovascular diseases,\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and unintentional injuries.19 Be-\ncause ample evidence implicates tobacco use as the underlying cause for a sub-\nstantial portion of deaths, we distinguished lung cancer from other cancers, yield-\ning six cause-of-death categories.20\nn Analyses. We computed life expectancy by education both within race-sex\ngroups and for the entire study population, holding race and sex composition con-\nstant at year 2000 shares. We also calculated age-standardized mortality rates using\nten-year age strata with the year 2000 population standard. The changes in these\nmethod, and NLMS variance estimates accounted for the complex survey design.22\nLastly, given the importance of causes of death for which smoking is a risk factor, we\ncomputed the sex-specific, age-adjusted share of the adult population (age twenty-\nfive and older) reporting that they were \"current smokers\" for selected years be-\ntween 1966 and 2002, in the annual National Health Interview Surveys (NHIS) from\nvarious years.\nS o c i a l D e t e r m i n a n t s\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Comparing\neducation people but only 0.5 years for low-education people--a difference of 0.9\neducation group but remained unchanged for the low-education group (p < 0.001 for\nthe difference). As expected, life expectancy in the MCD data was lower than in the\nNLMS data because of the inclusion of the institutionalized population. In both\ndata sets, education-related gaps in life expectancy increased by about 30 percent.\nThis similarity is striking, given the differences in sampling frames and education\nmeasures between the sources. Further, the levels of the education differences are\nlarge. In 2000, life expectancy for a twenty-five-year-old with a high school diploma\nor less was fifty years. For a person with some college, life expectancy was nearly\nfifty-seven years.\nn Life expectancy by race and sex. Widening educational disparities in life\nexpectancy do not arise from increased race or sex differences in mortality trends.\nOur population estimates hold demographics constant at their 2000 level. More fun-\ndamentally, Exhibit 2 shows similar trends within each race and gender group. The\ngrowing educational gap in life expectancy was most pronounced among women,\nregardless of race. Life expectancy at age twenty-five declined among less-educated\nblack and white women while rising one year or more for more-educated women. By\n2000, highly educated women could expect to live more than five years longer than\ntheir less-educated counterparts, in both races. For white men the gap was 7.8 years\nOverall and even within-race trends in mortality by education mask another\nC h a n g e s I n M o r t a l i t y\nH E A LT H A F F A I R S ~ Vo l u m e 2 7, N u m b e r 2 3 5 3\nYears of life remaining\nLife Expectancy Among Americans At Age Twenty-Five, By Education Level, Selected\nSOURCE: Authors' calculations using data on non-Hispanic blacks and whites in the National Longitudinal Mortality Study\n(NLMS) and death certificate data from the Multiple Cause of Death (MCD) files linked to census data.\nHigh school or less\nAny college\nNational Longitudinal Mortality Study Multiple Cause of Death files/census data\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

From 1990 to 2000, the life expec-\ntancy differences between blacks and whites decreased 1.8 years for low-educa-\ntion males, 1.5 years for high-education males, and 0.7 and 0.6 years for low- and\nhigh-education females, respectively. Life expectancy for low-education white\nmales increased in both the NLMS and MCD data, while it decreased for females.\nWithin the high-education group, life expectancy increased for both men and\nwomen, but the gains for men were almost double those for women. Gaps in mor-\ntality by race and sex persist, but they are smaller now than they were in the 1980s.\nn Condition-specific contributors to rising education gaps. Diseases of the\nheart, cancers, and COPD contributed more than 60 percent of deaths in the sample\nin 1990 and 2000 in all race and gender groups. Heart diseases and cancers exclud-\ning lung cancer contributed most to rising education differentials, 32 percent. Lung\ncancer and COPD, two diseases largely attributable to tobacco use, accounted for 21\npercent (Exhibit 3). These diseases were particularly salient among less-educated\nwhite women over age forty-five, among whom lung cancer and COPD contributed\nS o c i a l D e t e r m i n a n t s\nLife Expectancy At Age Twenty-Five, By Race, Sex, And Education Group, Selected\nLife expectancy (years)\nNLMS MCD/census\nWhite men\nAll\nLow education\nHigh education\nDifference\nWhite women\nAll\nLow education\nHigh education\nDifference\nBlack men\nAll\nLow education\nHigh education\nDifference\n\u00ada\n\u00ada\n\u00ada\n\u00ada\n\u00ada\n\u00ada\n\u00ada\n\u00ada\n\u00ada\n\u00ada\n\u00ada\n\u00ada\nBlack women\nAll\nLow education\nHigh education\nDifference\n\u00ada\n\u00ada\n\u00ada\n\u00ada\n\u00ada\n\u00ada\n\u00ada\n\u00ada\n\u00ada\n\u00ada\n\u00ada\n\u00ada\nSOURCE: Authors' calculations using data on non-Hispanic blacks and whites in the National Longitudinal Mortality Study\n(NLMS) and death certificate data from the Multiple Cause of Death (MCD) files and the Integrated Public Use Micro Sample of\na Estimates among blacks are unreliable because of small numbers within subgroups; not shown.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Increased edu-\ncation differentials among the elderly account for much of the growing gaps in mor-\ntality and life expectancy. Within each race-gender group, at least half of the growth\nin life expectancy gaps and more than 60 percent of the growth in mortality gaps\ncome from those age sixty-five or older.24 In contrast, trends among adults ages 25\u00ad\n44 contributed little to growing gaps in mortality, and among black men ages 25\u00ad44,\ndeath we examined, the narrowing educational differential among black men ages\n25\u00ad44 was driven by unintentional injuries and heart disease deaths.25\nn Smoking rates over time. Adult smoking rates have declined greatly since the\nmid-1960s (Exhibit 5). Among men, the reduction in smoking prevalence was rela-\ntively even by education, although somewhat greater for the better-educated. Be-\ntween 1966 and 1995, rates dropped twenty-two percentage points among the better\neducated versus eighteen percentage points among less-educated men (Exhibit 5),\ndespite the fact that better-educated men already had lower smoking rates in 1966.\ncentage points among the better-educated and five percentage points among the\nless-educated. The sharp divergence in smoking rates by education occurred be-\ntween 1979 and 1983, coincident with the first surgeon general's report highlight-\ning smoking risks for women.26 Over the entire period, smoking among female col-\nlege attendees declined by more than sixteen percentage points, compared with\nonly 7.5 percentage points among less-educated women (data not shown).\nC h a n g e s I n M o r t a l i t y\nH E A LT H A F F A I R S ~ Vo l u m e 2 7, N u m b e r 2 3 5 5\nPercent of increase in educational disparity\nDis. of the\nheart\nContribution To Growth In Education-Related Disparities In Mortality Among\nSOURCE: Authors' calculations using data on non-Hispanic blacks and whites in the Multiple Cause of Death (MCD) files linked\nto census data.\nNOTES: COPD is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

These patterns mirror similar widening of education\ndifferentials in disability and self-reported health status over the same period.27\nThe growing gap in life expectancy by education occurred during a period of in-\ncreasing attention to health disparities and increased public spending designed to\nS o c i a l D e t e r m i n a n t s\nAge-Standardized Deaths Per 100,000 Americans, By Education, Race, Sex, And\nLow education High education\nDifferential\nchangea\nWhite men\nAll\nDiseases of the heart\nCancers, except lung\nLung cancer\nCOPD\nCerebrovascular disease\nUnintentional injury\nWhite women\nAll\nDiseases of the heart\nCancers, except lung\nLung cancer\nCOPD\nCerebrovascular disease\nUnintentional injury\nBlack men\nAll\nDiseases of the heart\nCancers, except lung\nLung cancer\nCOPD\nCerebrovascular disease\nUnintentional injury\nBlack women\nAll\nDiseases of the heart\nCancers, except lung\nLung cancer\nCOPD\nCerebrovascular disease\nUnintentional injury\nSOURCE: Authors' calculations using data on non-Hispanic blacks and whites in the National Longitudinal Mortality Study\n(NLMS) and death certificate data from the Multiple Cause of Death (MCD) files linked to census data.\nNOTES: Age-standardized deaths among Americans ages 25\u00ad84 using year 2000 standard.

Nevertheless, a\nfive-year gap in life expectancy between blacks and whites remains.28 In terms of\ngender, men made faster gains in mortality than women over this period, narrow-\ning gender-related mortality and life expectancy gaps.\nn The income factor. Our data span a period of rapidly rising income inequality,\nproviding one potential explanation for widening education disparities. However,\ndata do not support this explanation because health disparities narrowed across\nrace and sex as inequality increased.29\nn The smoking factor. Our results suggest that differential trends in smoking\nmay explain a large part of widening gaps in mortality and life expectancy. The dis-\neases contributing most to the growing education gap in mortality include diseases\nof the heart, lung and other cancers, and COPD, all of which share tobacco use as a\nmajor risk factor. Lung cancer and COPD alone account for one-quarter of the in-\ncreasing gap in life expectancy for women over age forty-five, consistent with their\nsharp divergence in smoking rates during the 1980s. For men, the divergence in\nsmoking rates was more moderate, as was the increase in the mortality gap attribut-\nable to tobacco-related causes of death.\nPublic policy designed to reduce health consequences related to smoking might\nhave indirectly contributed to this disparity. In the half-century since the harms of\nsmoking became widely known, tobacco control measures have proliferated. Cig-\narette labels warning of the health hazards of smoking have been required since\nworkplace. By 1993, 70 percent of indoor workers had smoking bans in work, and\nC h a n g e s I n M o r t a l i t y\nH E A LT H A F F A I R S ~ Vo l u m e 2 7, N u m b e r 2 3 5 7\nPercent current smokers\nRates Of Smoking Among Americans Age Twenty-Five And Older, By Sex And\nSOURCE: Authors' calculations using data from the National Health Interview Survey, various years.\nNOTES: Smoking rates are age-standardized to the 2000 population standard.

In the four decades following the 1964 surgeon general's report, per\ncapita annual consumption of cigarettes among adults fell by half. However, de-\nclines were greatest among the most-educated groups. The growing education-\nrelated gap in mortality for smoking-related causes supports the long-standing\nparadox that prevention can widen disparities in health across education and in-\ncome groups.33 In this case, the advances are related to knowledge about risk-fac-\ntor control; we cannot say whether the same is true about medical technologies.34\nn Other efforts to reduce disparities. The focus on tobacco does not imply that\nother efforts to reduce disparities in health were not successful. Indeed, we confirm\nrecent work highlighting relative gains in life expectancy overall for blacks com-\npared with whites during the 1990s.35 Further, other studies have shown that\nMedicaid expansions targeting low-income children and pregnant women im-\nproved their health outcomes.36 Our study does not argue that these policies were\nunsuccessful. Rather, it suggests that these efforts were swimming against a strong\ntide, one that overwhelmed billions of dollars spent annually on additional medical\ncare. On a more positive note, our results suggest that one place to look for real prog-\nress is tobacco control efforts for low-SES groups because mortality trends mimic\ntrends in smoking that occurred decades earlier. These long-run consequences of\nhealth behavior bolster the argument for early childhood intervention.37\nn Why differential smoking trends? The explanation for differential smoking\ntrends is complex. Basic knowledge does not appear to be the major issue. In 1986,\n90 percent of Americans surveyed across the board reported that smoking causes\nlung cancer and emphysema, and 80 percent believed that it contributed to heart\ndisease and bronchitis.38 Translating knowledge into action has proved more com-\nplex, however. Innovations that target less-advantaged groups might offset this un-\nintended consequence of medical progress. Some caution about this conclusion is\nneeded, however. Without addressing the underlying factors that lead less-edu-\ncated people to be less able or willing to invest in better health, measures to reduce\nsmoking may simply lead to a shift from tobacco-related deaths to other causes.39\nn The obesity factor. Beyond the differential change in smoking, there is the na-\ntional trend toward increased obesity. As with smoking, obesity is more common\namong the less-educated than among the better-educated. Further, recent research\nsuggests that obesity might contribute to nearly as many deaths as tobacco does.40\nAlthough the population health consequences of obesity remain controversial, the\nobesity trends into the future could further widen socioeconomic gaps in health.\nIn summary, during a period of increased focus on disparities in health, virtu-\nally all gains in life expectancy occurred among highly educated groups. Causes of\ndeath related to differential trends in cigarette smoking by education have con-\nS o c i a l D e t e r m i n a n t s\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.
