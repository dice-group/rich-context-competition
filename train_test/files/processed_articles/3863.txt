As such,\ninvestigating ways of increasing exercise is a concern within\nhealth psychology (e.g., Hagger & Armitage, 2004; Hagger,\nChatzisarantis, & Biddle, 2002a; Jones, Sinclair, Rhodes, &\nresearch is to identify the socio-cognitive factors that predict\nexercise intentions and behavior and provide a psychological\naccount of how these factors determine behavior.

Two prominent models are the Theory of Planned\nParallel Process Model (EPPM; Witte, 1992a). Both these\nmodels have been utilized to explain health behavior and\nintentions to engage in health behavior.

Several researchers have\nlamented that there is a lack of research comparing compet-\ning theories or augmenting existing theories (Noar &\n2006, for some notable exceptions). Failing to compare or\nadjust existing theory means that it fails to naturally evolve,\nand as such our understanding of the socio-cognitive factors\nwhich determine health behavior change (and the mediators\nof health behavior change) does not improve (Weinstein &\nSeveral researchers have advocated taking a broader\napproach to predicting health behavior change by utilizing\nconstructs from several theoretical perspectives--namely,\nZimmerman, 2005). Bringing together the constructs with\nthe most research support into a single model may yield a\nmodel which can explain a larger proportion of the variance\nthan any single model alone. In many cases, the similarities\nbetween models of health behavior outweigh the differences\nredundancy, only dissimilar models should be integrated.\nTwo models which stand out as being different from one\nanother, while still explaining a large proportion of the vari-\nance in health behavior change, are the TPB and EPPM.\nMain Theoretical Perspectives\nand perceived behavioral control (PBC) are the proximal\npredictors of behavior. PBC refers to an individual's appraisal\nof how much control they have over adopting a particular\nvidual considering the relevant resources they have available\nto them (i.e., requisite skills, social support, disposable\nincome, etc.) and determining whether these are sufficient to\novercome any barriers they anticipate in the performance of\nthe behavior. Ajzen argues that if people believe that they\nwill be successful in performing the behavior, they will be\nmore likely to expend greater effort in adopting it (cf.\nimportant predictor of behavior when behaviors are some-\nwhat difficult or effortful to perform.\nAn individual's intentions are determined by their atti-\ntudes, subjective norms, and PBC. One's attitude toward a\nbehavior refers to their appraisal (positive or negative) of\ntheir performing the behavior. Beliefs contributing to the for-\nmation of an attitude include the expected outcomes of\nengaging in the behavior (behavioral beliefs) and whether or\nnot these outcomes are appraised as favorable or unfavorable\n(subjective evaluation; Ajzen, 1991). More positive attitudes\nare generated when expected outcomes are appraised as\nfavorable. Subjective norms refer to the \"perceived social\npressure to perform or not perform the behaviour\" (Ajzen,\nare the perceived likelihood that important people in the indi-\nvidual's life (e.g., friends, family members, medical profes-\nsionals) will approve or disapprove of them engaging in a\nparticular behavior, and their motivation to comply with each\nimportant other's wishes. According to the TPB, an individ-\nual is most likely to intend to perform health protective\nbehaviors if they believe that (a) the behaviors are associated\nwith favorable outcomes, (b) important others will approve,\nand (c) they have a high level of control over whether the\nbehavior is adopted.\nThe TPB has received much research interest and has\nbeen found to be useful in explaining a variety of health\nbehaviors including exercise (e.g., Armitage & Conner,\n2001; Chatzisarantis, Hagger, Wang, & Th\u00f8gersen-\nMeta-analytic reviews have found that, on the whole, TPB\nexplains 39% to 51% of the variance in behavioral intentions\nand 26% to 34% of the variance in health behavior (Armitage\n& Biddle, 2002b; McEachan, Conner, Taylor, & Lawton,\n2011). Therefore, although the TPB explains a large propor-\ntion of the variance in intentions and behavior, a significant\namount of variance remains unexplained, suggesting that\nother predictors may exist which could explain this missing\nvariance.\nEPPM\nThe EPPM (Witte, 1992a) was designed to explain responses\nfollowing exposure to a fear provoking health message--or a\nfear appeal (Witte, 1992a). Fear appeals generally consist of\ntwo elements: an explicit threat to health (e.g., \"obesity\nincreases your chances of heart disease\") and a recom-\nmended response which will alleviate that threat (\"exercise\nfor 30 min 5 times per week\"). However, many of the prin-\nciples of the EPPM can be applied outside of a fear appeal\ncontext to explain how individuals are likely to respond to a\nperceived health threat (e.g., Rimal, 2001; Rimal, B\u00f6se,\nBrown, Mkandawire, & Folda, 2009; Rimal, Brown, et al.,\nthreat are a function of two appraisal processes: threat\nappraisal and efficacy appraisal (cf. Lazarus & Folkman,\n1984). During the threat appraisal, individuals evaluate fac-\ntors associated with the health threat, including feelings con-\ncerning the seriousness of a health threat (severity) and the\nlikelihood of their being affected (susceptibility). The effi-\ncacy appraisal evaluates factors associated with a possible\nRichards and Johnson 3\nresponse to the threat including beliefs regarding the effec-\ntiveness of the response in reducing the health threat\n(response-efficacy) and a conviction that they can succeed in\nadopting the response (self-efficacy; cf. Bandura, 1977).\nAccording to the EPPM, when a health threat is appraised\nas trivial (low severity) or irrelevant (low susceptibility), no\nfear is elicited and there is no motivation to respond to the\nfear appeal or continue to attend to its message. Thus, low\nthreat messages are unlikely to lead to adaptive behavior\nchange, regardless of the efficacy level (Witte, 1992a).\nHowever, when a health threat is appraised as harmful and\nrelevant, fear is elicited (e.g., Maddux & Rogers, 1983;\nconsideration of possible responses to the health threat (effi-\ncacy appraisal; cf. Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). When a par-\nticular response is believed to be effective in alleviating the\nhealth threat (high response-efficacy) and easy to perform\n(high self-efficacy), the individual should become motivated\nto protect themselves from the health threat. This protection\nmotivation should in turn stimulate acceptance of the\nresponse (i.e., adaptive attitude, intention, and behavior\nEPPM predicts that when individuals perceive themselves to\nbe susceptible to a severe health threat, and believe that\nadopting a particular behavior will be effective in alleviating\nthat health threat, they are likely to hold positive attitudes\nand intend to adopt that behavior (see Witte, 1992a, for a\nfuller explication of the predictions of the EPPM).\nMeta-analyses reveal that the five key variables (fear,\nseverity, susceptibility, response-efficacy, and self-efficacy)\nof the EPPM each have positive associations with behavioral\nintentions and behavior change (Floyd et al., 2000; Milne et\neffect sizes range from no effect to moderate (r = .07-.36;\nMilne et al., 2000). Self-efficacy, response-efficacy, and fear\nare generally stronger predictors of intentions and behavior\nthan severity or susceptibility (Milne et al., 2000; Witte &\nAllen, 2000). Research findings suggest that perceptions of\nthreat and efficacy account for 20% to 56% of the variance in\nintentions and 19% to 46% of the variance in health behavior\nMelamed, Rabinowitz, Feiner, Weisberg, & Ribak, 1996;\nTrinh, Courneya, Karunamuni, & Sigal, 2009; Rogers &\nVan der Pligt, 1991). Although these findings are impressive,\nthere is still a large proportion of the variance which is left\nunexplained by the model. Therefore, other variables may\nneed to be considered if a more complete explanation of\nhealth behavior is to be realized.\nThe Case for Theoretical Integration\nThe present study aims to investigate the utility of taking a\nmore comprehensive approach to predicting exercise\nintentions by utilizing constructs from two socio-cognitive\nmodels as predictors. The study will investigate whether\nadding perceived susceptibility, severity, self-efficacy, and\nresponse-efficacy to the TPB increases its explanatory power\nfor predicting intentions to exercise. Hagger (2009) identi-\nfied three arguments in favor of theoretical integration; it can\neliminate gaps in theories, reduce redundancy, and increase\nparsimony. Both the TPB and EPPM contain different\neach still explains a significant proportion of the variance in\nhealth behavior intentions (e.g., Armitage & Conner, 2001;\npossible that constructs from the EPPM may be able to fill\nexplanatory gaps in the TPB, and vice versa, highlighting\nredundancies and unnecessary variables between theories.\nTherefore, theoretical integration may help streamline health\npromotion campaigns by identifying the most important\nvariables to manipulate (Hagger, 2009). Other researchers\nagree that combining social-cognitive models may be a use-\nful next step in the development of health behavior theory\nresearch has attempted to combine variables from the TPB\nand EPPM to explain exercise intentions.\nIntegrating Ideas From the TPB and EPPM\nTheorists have argued that self-efficacy and PBC are concep-\nHowever, Conner and Armitage (1998) argued that PBC is\nreally a confounded measure of two constructs: one which is\nwith which the behavior can be adopted) and the other akin\nto locus of control (cf. Rotter, 1966; that is, whether a person\nbelieves that the behavior is under volitional control--per-\nceived controllability). In support of this view, several stud-\nies have provided evidence for the conceptual distinction\nbetween perceived controllability and self-efficacy (e.g.,\nthey should each be included as separate variables within the\nTPB framework. Adding self-efficacy to the TPB has been\nshown to increase the explanatory power of the model in\nterms of explaining exercise intentions and behavior (e.g.,\nHagger et al., 2002b; Povey, Conner, Sparks, James, &\ndicted that perceptions of self-efficacy and perceived con-\ntrollability will be conceptually distinct and will each predict\nexercise intentions.\nIt has been argued that components of perceived threat\nwithin the EPPM (i.e., susceptibility and severity) may be\nincorporated into the TPB as beliefs contributing to one's\nSusceptibility may be conceptualized as a perceived out-\ncome of not engaging in the healthy behaviors (i.e., \"if I\nmaintain my sedentary lifestyle I may develop heart\n4 SAGE Open\ndisease\"). Perceptions of severity could be conceptualized as\nunfavorable evaluations of developing a health problem (i.e.,\n\"heart disease is a serious and life-threatening\"; Maddux,\n1993). Beliefs about one's susceptibility to a severe illness\nshould lead to more negative attitudes concerning the current\nand as a result more positive attitudes about proposed\nchanges in behavior, especially if these are believed to be\neffective in alleviating the health risk. Therefore, beliefs\nabout the efficacy of a particular response in alleviating the\nhealth risk (i.e., response-efficacy) could also be conceptual-\nized as a behavioral belief concerning that response. It can be\nsafely assumed that this belief would be favorable as it is\nunlikely that improving one's health would be viewed as\nunfavorable. This suggests that the EPPM constructs of sus-\nceptibility, severity, and response-efficacy may be determi-\nnants of attitudes within the TPB. As such, it is predicted that\nthe effect of these variables on intentions will be mediated by\nattitudes.\nior may be used to test the sufficiency of the TPB. If the TPB\nis sufficient, prior behavior (or any other variable) should not\nadd significant unique variance to the model. However,\nmeta-analytic reviews of the TPB consistently suggest that\npast health behavior is a relatively strong and consistent pre-\ndictor of both intentions and behavior even after controlling\nfor the effects of attitudes, subjective norms, PBC, and inten-\nConner, 2008). The addition of past behavior to the TPB also\nsignificantly attenuates the effects of intentions and PBC on\nbehavior, and the effects of attitudes, subjective norms, and\nPBC on intentions (McEachan et al., 2011). Therefore, the\nTPB may not be sufficient to predict intentions and behavior,\nsuggesting that important socio-cognitive predictors may\nhave been left out of the model.\nOuellette and Wood (1998) argued that when a behavior is\nperformed frequently within similar contexts, the perfor-\nmance of that behavior can become automatic or habitual--\noccurring independent of the conscious deliberation posited\nby the TPB (cf. Ronis, Yates, & Kirscht, 1989). Therefore, if\nan individual has made a habit of exercising in the past, they\nare likely to do so in the future.Ajzen (2002) offered an alter-\nnative explanation arguing that the determinants of past\nbehavior are likely to affect future behavior and future inten-\ntions. As such, assuming these determinants do not change\nsignificantly over time, past behavior will necessarily corre-\nlate with intentions. Ajzen suggested that the link between\npast behavior and intentions is spurious and should be medi-\nated by other predictors of intentions. It is possible that this\neffect may be due to past exercise raising individual's self-\nefficacy with respect to exercising in the future. Engaging in\nexercise demonstrates empirically that one should be able to\ndicted that self-efficacy will mediate the effect of past exer-\ncise behavior on intentions to exercise.\nTaken together, we propose a model in which exercise\nwill be determined by attitudes, subjective norms, self-effi-\ncacy, and perceived controllability. Severity, susceptibility,\nand response-efficacy will have no direct effect on intentions\nbut will exert their influence via attitudes. Past behavior will\nbe used to test the sufficiency of the model and its effect on\nintentions should be mediated by self-efficacy.\nMethod\nThe results reported here are preliminary findings from a\nlarger study investigating the predictors of health behavior\nchange around obesity, diet, and exercise. The present\nresearch will report only the results pertaining to the predic-\ntors of exercise.\nParticipants\nrecruited for the study. The mean age of participants was\nfrom the undergraduate psychology program of a university\nin New South Wales, Australia, via an online advertisement\n(N = 284), the remaining 52 participants were recruited from\nthe general public via advertisement posters. Undergraduate\nparticipants received partial course credit for their participa-\ntion, whereas the general public participants received no\nincentives or rewards.\nMeasures\nWith the exception of the demographics measure, all mea-\nsures used in this study have been adapted from those used\nin previous research testing the TPB (e.g., Chatzisarantis et\nMcKeon, & Berkowitz, 1996). The phrasing of the items\nremained similar but was adapted to fit the health context of\nthis study.\nAll items corresponded to exactly the same specific\nbehavior (\"exercising 30 min a day, 5 days per week\") over a\nspecific time frame (\"the next month\") following recommen-\ndations from Ajzen (1991). With the exception of the demo-\ngraphics measure (which was presented first) and the\nattitudes and intentions measures (which were presented\nlast), the items from the remaining scales were presented in\nrandom order. All measures except the attitudes measure uti-\nlized a 7-point categorical scale anchored by strongly agree\nand strongly disagree. The attitudes measure utilized a\n7-point semantic differential scale. Items pertaining to each\nof the measures were summed, then averaged by dividing the\ntotal by the number of items, such that each measure was\nscored out of seven. The experiment was performed online\non the university server. The survey program was used to\nrandomize the items.\nRichards and Johnson 5\nDemographics/past behavior.Age, sex, and information per-\ntaining to relevant health behaviors (e.g., frequency of exer-\ncise, minutes spent exercising per week) were gathered using\na demographics measure. Past exercise behavior was deter-\nmined by asking participants how many exercise sessions\nthey had completed over the past month and what was the\naverage length of these exercise sessions. These values were\nused to calculate the time (in hours) spent exercising per\nweek. This was used as a measure of past behavior. As a\nguide, participants were provided with the following defini-\ntion of exercise: \"Exercise is defined as physical activity that\nis planned, structured, and repetitive for the purpose of con-\nditioning any part of the body or increasing physical\nfitness.\"\nAttitudes. Participant's attitudes were measured using a four-\nitem semantic differential scale. Participants indicated the\nextent to which engaging in exercise during the next month\nwould be good/bad, enjoyable/not enjoyable, unwise/wise,\nand beneficial/not beneficial. The internal consistency for\nthis measure was high ( = .84).\nSubjective norms.Subjective norms were measured using a\ntwo-item scale. Participants indicated the extent to which\nthey believe that important others would \"approve\" or \"rec-\nommend\" that they engage in exercise during the next month.\nThe internal consistency for this measure was acceptable\nPerceived controllability.Perceived controllability was mea-\nsured using a two-item scale. Participants indicated the\nextent to which they believe that they have control over\nengaging in exercise during the next month (i.e., \"It is mostly\nup to me [I have control over] whether or not I exercise for at\nleast 30 min per day during the next month\"). The internal\nconsistency for this measure was high ( = .89).\nSusceptibility. Susceptibility was measured using a three-item\nscale. Participants indicated whether they believed them-\nselves to be \"at risk of,\" \"likely to develop,\" or \"possibly\naffected by\" the adverse health effects associated with weight\ngain. The internal consistency of this scale was high\nSeverity.Severity was measured using a three-item scale.\nParticipants indicated the extent to which they believed that\nthe adverse health effects associated with weight gain are\n\"severe,\" \"serious,\" and \"significant.\" The internal consis-\ntency of this scale was acceptable ( = .78).\nSelf-efficacy.Self-efficacy was measured using a six-item\nscale. Items included the following: \"Exercising for 30 min-\nutes per day 5 days per week during the next month will be\neasy (difficult, inconvenient [reverse scored]) for me\" and \"I\nam able to (I am certain I could, If I wanted to I could easily)\nexercise for 30 min . . .\" The internal consistency for the\nscale was high ( = .93).\nResponse-efficacy.Response-efficacy was measured using a\nthree-item scale. Participants indicated the extent to which\nthey believe that engaging in exercise \"works\" and \"is effec-\ntive\" in preventing weight-related health problems. The\ninternal consistency for this measure was high ( = .89).\nIntentions. The dependent variable, intentions, was measured\nusing a two-item scale. Items included the following: \"I\nintend to exercise for at least 30 min per day, 5 days per week\nduring the next month\" and \"I will exercise . . .\" The internal\nconsistency for this measure was high ( = .88).\nData Analysis\nPrincipal components analysis was utilized to ascertain\nwhether self-efficacy and perceived controllability were dis-\ntinct constructs. Pearson's correlations were utilized to\ninvestigate the intercorrelations between the psychological\nvariables used in this study. Multiple regression was utilized\nto investigate the predictors of attitudes. Hierarchical regres-\nsion analysis was utilized to uncover a significant model of\nfactors that predict exercise intentions. This analysis was\nperformed by entering four different blocks of predictors into\na regression equation predicting intentions. Block 1 con-\nsisted of the TPB variables (i.e., attitudes, subjective norms,\nand perceived controllability). Block 2 contained self-effi-\ncacy. Block 3 consisted of the remaining variables from the\nEPPM (i.e., susceptibility, severity, and response-efficacy).\nBlock 4 contained past exercise behavior. Hierarchical\nregression was also utilized to investigate whether the effect\nof severity, susceptibility, and response-efficacy on inten-\ntions is mediated by attitudes, and whether the effect of past\nbehavior on intentions is mediated by self-efficacy.\nResults\nPrincipal Components Analysis\nAs PBC and self-efficacy are conceptually similar, there was\na need to ensure that the items used were indeed representing\ntwo separate constructs, rather than one overarching con-\nstruct. Therefore, a principal components analysis with\nVarimax rotation was performed on the perceived controlla-\nbility and self-efficacy items. Kaiser's criterion (eigenvalue\n> 1) was utilized to determine how many factors to extract.\nThe first factor (rotated: eigenvalue = 4.00, variance\nexplained = 64.17%) was found to all six of the self-efficacy\nitems loading on it (with factor loadings greater than .5;\nadditional variance explained = 27.87%; unrotated: eigen-\n6 SAGE Open\nboth of the perceived controllability items loading on it. No\nfurther factors were extracted (eigenvalues < 1). As pre-\ndicted, these results indicate that the self-efficacy and per-\nceived controllability items represent distinct constructs.\nHowever, the percentage of additional variance explained by\nthe second factor was small, indicating that this factor is rela-\ntively weak. Nevertheless both factors were retained to\ninvestigate the unique effect of self-efficacy and perceived\ncontrollability on intentions. The total variance explained by\nthe two-factor rotated solution was 78.21%. The correlation\nbetween the resultant measures of perceived controllability\nand self-efficacy was r = .51.\nDescriptive Statistics and Correlations\nDescriptive statistics and correlation coefficients for each of\nthe psychological variables are presented in Table 1.\nPearson's correlations coefficients revealed a strong positive\nassociation between self-efficacy and intentions; moderate\npositive associations were observed between exercise inten-\ntions and attitudes, subjective norms, perceived controllabil-\nity, and past behavior. Exercise intentions were also weakly\nassociated with response-efficacy. Contrary to predictions,\nno significant bivariate correlation was found between exer-\ncise intentions and susceptibility or severity. As predicted,\nattitudes were positively associated with response-efficacy,\nand past behavior was positively associated with self-\nefficacy. However, contrary to predictions, neither severity\nnor susceptibility was associated with attitudes. Furthermore, a\nmoderate positive correlation was found between self-efficacy\nand perceived controllability. Other intercorrelations were\ngenerally weak or non-significant. However, moderate posi-\ntive associations were recorded between attitudes and sub-\njective norms, attitudes and self-efficacy, subjective norms\nand self-efficacy, subjective norms and response-efficacy,\nand perceived controllability and response-efficacy.\nPrediction of Attitudes\nMultiple regression analysis was utilized to investigate the\neffect of susceptibility, severity, and response-efficacy on\nattitudes. A significant model which explained 7.29% of the\n(see Table 2). Response-efficacy was the only variable found\nto explain a significant proportion of the variance in atti-\ntudes. Contrary to predictions, the effects of both susceptibil-\nity and severity were non-significant.\nPredictors of Exercise Intentions\nThe first step in the hierarchical regression analysis revealed\nthat attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived controllability\neach contributed to the prediction of exercise intentions,\nthe model, the effect of both subjective norms and perceived\ncontrollability was attenuated to non-significance. The\nremaining EPPM predictors explained a further 1.90% of the\nperceived susceptibility was the only variable to explain a\nsignificant proportion of the remaining variance. Finally,\npast exercise behavior was also found to be a significant pre-\ndictor of intentions, explaining a small proportion of the\nmodel explained 47.46% of the variance in exercise\nintentions.\nGiven the zero-order bivariate relationship between sus-\nceptibility and intentions (r = .02, p = .78), it is possible that\nsusceptibility acted as a suppressor variable. Suppressor\nvariables generally increase the prediction of an outcome\nvariable of interest by increasing the predictive validity of\none or more predictor variables (cf. MacKinnon, Krull, &\n1991). This occurs as the suppressor variable suppresses\nvariance in one or more of the predictor variables, which is\nirrelevant to the outcome variable. Investigation of the cor-\nrelation matrix revealed that susceptibility was negatively\nassociated with self-efficacy (r = -.19, p< .001). Furthermore,\na small increase in the beta-weight for self-efficacy was\nfound following the inclusion of susceptibility in the model.\nMacKinnon et al. demonstrated that suppression and\nTable 1. Descriptive Statistics and Correlation Matrix for Exercise Intentions and All Measured Predictors.\naHours of exercise performed each week.\nRichards and Johnson 7\nmediation are mathematically equivalent. As such, tests of\nmediation, such as the Sobel test, can also be applied to iden-\ntifying suppressor effects (Preacher & Hayes, 2004). A Sobel\ntest revealed that the inclusion of susceptibility in a model\nregressing intentions from self-efficacy significantly\nincreased the predictive validity of self-efficacy (Z = -2.44,\np< .05). This indicates that susceptibility acted as a suppres-\nsor variable within the regression equation, suppressing vari-\nance in self-efficacy, which was irrelevant to intentions\nTzelgov & Henik, 1991). These findings suggest that exer-\ncise intentions are not associated with the shared variance\nbetween self-efficacy and susceptibility.\nMediation Analyses\nIt was predicted that attitudes would mediate the relationship\nbetween response-efficacy and intentions, susceptibility and\nintentions, and severity and intentions. Following Baron and\nKenny (1986), variables were only entered as potential medi-\nators when (a) the predictor was correlated with the mediator\n(attitudes), (b) the predictor was correlated with the\ndependent variable (intentions), and (c) the mediator was\ncorrelated with the dependent variable. Investigations of cor-\nrelation matrix revealed that attitudes qualified as a mediator\nfor the effect of response-efficacy on intentions. Both sus-\nceptibility and severity did not correlate with intentions. This\nsuggests that neither susceptibility nor severity exert any\ndirect or indirect effect on intentions.\nAttitudes were found to fully mediate the effect of\nresponse-efficacy on intentions to lose weight. Response-\nefficacy was found to be a predictor of intentions in the first\nstep of a hierarchical linear regression analysis ( = .15, p<\n.01). However, following the addition of attitudes into the\nequation, the effect of response-efficacy was attenuated to\nnon-significance ( = .07, p = .20). A Sobel test of mediation\nrevealed that the indirect effect of response-efficacy on\nintentions was significant (Z = 3.68, p< .001; cf. Preacher &\nHayes, 2004). These findings support the prediction that atti-\ntudes will mediate the effect of response-efficacy on\nintentions.\nA similar analysis was performed to investigate whether\nself-efficacy mediated the relationship between past exercise\nbehavior and intentions. Investigation of the correlation\nmatrix revealed that self-efficacy qualified as a mediator.\nHierarchical regression analysis revealed that adding self-\nefficacy to a model regressing exercise intentions from past\nexercise behavior attenuated the effect of past exercise\nbehavior to non-significance-- reduced from .26 (p< .001)\nprediction that the effect of past behavior on intentions will\nbe mediated by self-efficacy.\nDiscussion\nThe current study aimed to investigate whether there is util-\nity in combining constructs from the TPB and EPPM to pre-\ndict exercise intentions. Results suggested that although the\nTPB is a useful model for predicting exercise intentions, the\naddition of variables from the EPPM increased its explana-\ntory power. The identified integrated model suggested that\nindividuals are most likely to intend to exercise when they\nbelieve that engaging in exercise will lead to desirable out-\ncomes, believe that others will approve of their exercising,\nbelieve that they are able to exercise effectively, and believe\nthat they are susceptible to weight-related illnesses. The\nidentified model closely resembles the structure of the TPB,\nthe only differences being that only the self-efficacy compo-\nnent of PBC was an important predictor and perceived sus-\nceptibility explained additional variance. The proportion of\nthe variance explained by the model is comparable with that\nfound in meta-analytic reviews of TPB research relating to\nhealth behaviors (e.g., Godin & Kok, 1996; Hagger et al.,\nand past behavior only added a further 3%, suggesting that\nthese variables are far less important predictors of exercise\nintentions than attitudes and self-efficacy.\nTable 2. Hierarchical Regression Analysis of the Predictors of\nAttitudes and Exercise Intentions.\n t Adjusted R2\nAttitudes\nIntentions\n8 SAGE Open\nSelf-Efficacy and Perceived Controllability\nThe results of this study lend further support for the separa-\ntion of the PBC construct into two component parts: self-\nefficacy and perceived controllability. These findings are\nconsistent with a large number of studies, which have pro-\nvided evidence for the conceptual distinction between self-\nefficacy and perceived controllability (e.g., Armitage &\nHogg, 1994). Although there is evidence to suggest that both\nself-efficacy and PBC may contribute unique variance to\nmodels of health behavior intentions (e.g., Hagger et al.,\nthe current study. In the present study, the effect of perceived\ncontrollability on intentions was attenuated to non-signifi-\ncance following the addition of self-efficacy to the model.\nHowever, these results echo other previous findings which\nsuggest that self-efficacy is a stronger predictor of intentions\nthan perceived controllability (e.g., Povey et al., 2000;\nThese findings suggest that individual's belief that they are\ncapable of engaging in exercise is a more important predictor\nof exercise intentions than their belief that they have control\nover whether they engage in exercise.\nAttitudes\nAttitudes were found to be a predictor of intentions lending\nsupport to the predictions of the TPB. Attitudes are consis-\ntently a strong predictor of intentions in TPB research (cf.\n2011). As predicted, response-efficacy was found to be a sig-\nnificant predictor of attitudes. However, contrary to predic-\ntions susceptibility and severity were non-significant\npredictors. These results support previous findings in the lit-\nerature, suggesting that perceptions of efficacy (but not\nthreat) are associated with more positive attitudes concern-\ning health behaviors (e.g., Ruiter, Verplanken, Kok, & Werrij,\nmediate the effect of response-efficacy on intentions.\nAccording to the EPPM, individual's perceptions of\nresponse-efficacy can be manipulated through health mes-\nsages highlighting the effectiveness of certain responses\nTherefore, a health message may increase perceptions of\nresponse-efficacy with respect to a recommended response,\nwhich determines one's attitudes concerning that response,\nwhich in turn determines intentions and behavior. This medi-\nation model is consistent with the results of this study and the\npredictions of both the TPB and EPPM. As such, it may be\npossible to apply the TPB to the prediction of health message\nresponsiveness. Investigating this possibility would be an\ninteresting venture for future research.\nOther predictors of exercise intentions included subjec-\ntive norms, susceptibility, and past behavior. Importantly,\nthese variables were much weaker predictors of intentions.\nSeveral researchers have noted that subjective norms are\noften a weaker predictor of intention than either attitudes or\nPBC as evidenced by effect sizes in meta-analytic reviews\nand regression weights (e.g., Ajzen, 1991; Armitage &\n& Sheeran, 2003). Findings also suggest that perceptions of\nthreat are weaker predictors of exercise intentions than effi-\ncacy perceptions (e.g., Lippke & Plotnikoff, 2009; Plotnikoff\nFurthermore, susceptibility was identified as a suppressor\nvariable increasing the predictive validity of self-efficacy.\nThis suggests that the positive effect of self-efficacy on\nintentions is not at all attributable to the finding that those\nwith high self-efficacy tend to report lower susceptibility. The\neffect of susceptibility was significant because it removed\nvariance in self-efficacy which was unrelated to exercise\nintentions; rather than susceptibility exerting any direct\nimpact on intentions.\nPast exercise behavior was also found to be a predictor\nof exercise intentions. However, it only added a very small\namount of the residual variance in intentions after control-\nling for the effect of the other psychological variables.\nNevertheless, this suggests that the current model may be\ninadequate and other psychosocial constructs may need to\nbe considered to optimize the prediction of exercise inten-\nstudy suggest that the effect of past exercise behavior on\nintentions is mediated by self-efficacy. This finding sup-\nports Ajzen's (2002) contention that the effect of past\nbehavior on future intentions is spurious and should be\nmediated by other predictors of intentions. The results of\nthe present study suggest that engaging in exercise in the\npast increases one's belief that they could continue to exer-\ncise in the future, which in turn predicts intentions to\nexercise.\nIt is important to note that variables from both the TPB\nand EPPM contributed to the model. Furthermore, several of\nthe psychological variables from both models either did not\npredict exercise intentions (susceptibility and severity) or did\nnot contribute unique variance to its prediction (perceived\ncontrollability, response-efficacy). This suggests that neither\nmodel provides a complete or optimal account of exercise\nintentions. Despite a large number of variables being used as\npredictors, a relatively simple five-factor model of intentions\nemerged. This suggests that theoretical integration can be\nused to identify variables that are weakly or spuriously asso-\nciated with an outcome variable of interest (cf. Hagger, 2009,\n2010). The results of this study further suggest that theoreti-\ncal integration can be utilized to develop our understanding\nof the relations between constructs from separate models.\nWith the large number of extant models being applied to\nhealth behavior, many of which making very similar or iden-\ntical predictions, it is important to identify and understand\nRichards and Johnson 9\nconnections between these models. This allows for identifi-\ncation of general cross-theoretical principles of predicting\nThis is desirable as it serves to simplify and reconcile the\nhealth behavior literature as a whole (cf. Hagger, 2009;\nMaddux, 1993). Reconciliation of the health behavior litera-\nture may be achieved through further research, which\nA limitation of the present research is the use of intentions\nas the primary outcome measure in lieu of a specific measure\nof behavior. Although many socio-cognitive models (includ-\ning TPB and EPPM) assume that intentions are the proximal\npredictor of behavior, this assumption has often been called\ninto question (e.g., Rhodes & Dickau, 2012; Rhodes,\nof the relevant literature, Sheeran found that intentions\nexplained, on average, only 28% of the variance in behavior.\nThis suggests that individuals self-reported intentions do not\nnecessarily translate into behavior. Future research could\nemploy a longitudinal design to ascertain the extent to which\nintention predicts subsequent behavior within an integrated\nmodel.\nConclusion\nThe present study suggests that exercise intentions can be\npredicted by attitudes, subjective norms, self-efficacy, and\npast behavior. Several other psychological variables that\nhave been shown to be robust predictors of behavioral inten-\ntions in previous research were investigated but did not con-\ntribute unique variance to the model. Furthermore, an\ninteresting relationship between response-efficacy and atti-\ntudes was uncovered, which suggests that the TPB may be\napplied to the prediction of responses to health messages.\nTaken together, these findings suggest that theoretical inte-\ngration can highlight variables that are weakly or spuriously\nassociated with health behavior intentions. Furthermore, it\ncan develop our understanding of how constructs from dif-\nferent theoretical models can be combined to predict inten-\ntions. The authors advocate using theoretical integration as a\nmethodology to improve understanding of the determinants\nof health behavior.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAbraham, C., Sheeran, P., & Henderson, M.
