The choice of which\npersonal competency variables to measure was guided\nby Lawton's environmental press theory (Lawton,\n1983). We were unable to collect all of the types of\ndata necessary to test fully Lawton's theory (i.e. envi-\nronmental variables); therefore, this investigation should\nbe viewed as a partial test of Lawton's theory. The\npersonal competencies component of Lawton's model\nwas tested in a group of elders who experienced a\nnew onset disability and consequently entered a\nmedical rehabilitation facility for treatment. The impact\nof participants' competencies at the time of hospital-\nization was linked to functional abilities (instrumental\nactivities of daily living; IADLs) as a primary outcome;\nand living arrangement as a secondary outcome 3\nand 6 months after hospitalization.\nTheory of Environmental Press\nLawton, (Lawton, Brody, & Turner-Massey, 1978,\nfield a theoretical framework for understanding adap-\ntation to the environment in older persons. The envi-\nronmental press theory is a theory of adaptation that\nfocuses on person variables (competencies), environ-\nmental variables (environmental press), and the interac-\ntion between the two variables. Competencies include\nphysical and functional health, cognitive and affective\nfunctioning, and quality of life, including sense of ef-\nficacy or mastery. Environmental press variables in-\nclude the person's home environment, their social\nenvironment, and even their neighborhood environ-\nment. The fit between a person's level of competencies\nand the demands from their environment affect how\nwell an individual is functioning. In the case of being\nhospitalized for a disability, adaptation may be mea-\nsured by both basic functional abilities as well as the\nability to resume living independently.\nLawton (1985) also recognized and stated clearly\nthat declining functional competencies would also\naffect environmental press. Morgan and associates\n(1984) reported findings that partially supported this\ncontention. Less competent individuals demonstrated\nhigher scores on an index of environmental press.\nThe research presented below is salient to the current\nthrust of research initiatives that are focused on de-\nclines in functional health and how well older persons\ncan adapt to their home environment (Gill, Robison,\nalone elders constitute an appropriate group to test\nand enhance the utility of the environmental press\ntheory, because living alone is becoming a more nor-\nmative part of the aging process.

To date, living\nalone has either been characterized in the literature as\nan indicator of robust health or conversely as an indi-\ncator of extreme frailty, and the study of this group has\nlacked a general theoretical framework.\nResearchers have pointed to live-alone elders as ag-\ning successfully. Mui and Burnette (1994), utilizing the\nNational Long Term Care Channeling Demonstration\nproject, compared live-alone older adults with those\nwho did not live alone. Eighty percent of those living\nalone were women. The results pointed to an opti-\nmistic view of living alone, as those living alone were\nbetter educated, had fewer medical problems, had\nfewer hospitalizations, had fewer ADL (activities of\ndaily living) and IADL (instrumental activities of daily\nliving) problems, and had less cognitive impairment\nthan those who did not live alone. Despite their robust\nhealth, however, those living alone tended to report\nincreased levels of depression and more environmental\nhazards (i.e., problems with home safety and mainte-\nnance) than did those who lived with others.\nOther research has characterized living alone as\nan indicator of frailty. Living alone has been signifi-\ncantly correlated with frailty among older adults re-\nceiving emergency medical services (EMS). Gurley,\nLum, Sande, Lo, and Katz (1996) investigated the ef-\nfects of living alone on being found helpless or dead\nby paramedics. A total of 387 individuals who lived\nalone were found helpless in their homes during a\n12-week period. The authors concluded that the\nolder old (those over age 75) who lived alone are at\ngreater risk of losing not only their physical indepen-\ndence but also their lives.\nFrailty combined with older age, exacerbation of\nchronic medical conditions, or the onset of new medi-\ncal crises characterize a subgroup of older adults who\nare at a relatively high risk for losing independence.\nPearlman and Crown (1992), utilizing the National\nLong Term Care survey data, found that older adults\nwho entered a nursing home were more likely to be\nold-old, living alone, and having had a prior nursing\nhome stay. Rudberg, Sager, and Zhang (1996) re-\nported on risk factors for institutionalization following\nhospitalization on 1,265 individuals from five hospi-\ntals participating in the Hospital Outcomes Project\nfor the Elderly. Thirty-eight percent of the sample were\nliving alone at the time of hospitalization. Overall, 7%\nof respondents were placed in a nursing home and\nremained there after 3 months. Increased age and living\nalone prior to admission were predictors of nursing\nhome placement.\nHospitalized live-alone elders appear to represent\na group at higher risk for new onset of disabilities.\nPompei and associates (1994) reported that delirious\npatients were more likely to live alone and have evi-\ndence of depression and alcohol abuse.\nResearch reports have consistently reported a signif-\nicant relationship between declining functional and\ncognitive abilities and change in living arrangement.\nWorobey and Angel (1990) investigated the impact of\nphysical decline on living alone in older adults. Using\nthe Longitudinal Study of Aging, a national sample of\nwas surveyed in 1984 and recontacted 2 years later.\nIncreased functional incapacity was related to greater\ntendency to live with others. Similar conclusions were\nreported by Miller and colleagues (1999), who used\n6 years of data from the Longitudinal Study of Aging\nfor their analyses of community-based moves. Deteri-\noration of advanced ADLs and poorer lower body\nstrength were significant predictors of a community-\nbased residential move. These authors specifically\nadvocated for the inclusion of change in residence as\na health outcome indication.\nOther investigators have looked at changes in resi-\ndence following hospitalization in live-alone elders.\nFriedman (1995) presented one of the few studies\nthat investigated the long-term outcome of older\nstroke patients who lived alone prior to their stroke.\nAt discharge from the hospital, only 33% returned to\nliving alone; 44% of these patients were placed in an\ninstitution. At one year, those survivors who were in-\nstitutionalized rose to 52%.\nThe primary shortcoming of the literature concerning\nlive-alone elders to date is the absence of theory to\nguide the research. In the literature reviewed above,\nliving alone is treated as an independent predictor of a\nvariety of outcomes (e.g., ADLs, IADLs, living arrange-\nments). This is entirely consistent with an empirical\napproach to identify risk factors for adverse outcomes.\nLiving alone has been a significant risk factor of several\nhealth outcomes, including delirium and mortality,\nbut often this finding has been inconsistent, and/or me-\ndiated by several other variables such as poverty, gen-\nder, cognition, and ADLs. In other studies, living\nalone has been used as a predictor of optimal adapta-\ntion for some people (i.e., high functioning at baseline)\nand a predictor of least desirable adaptation for others\n(i.e., low functioning at baseline; see Sarwari, Fred-\nman, Langenberg, and Magaziner, 1998). Living\nalone has suddenly become a significant predictor\nvariable in gerontological studies, but one with little or\nno explanatory power. By using the theory of envi-\nronmental press to guide our research, we can better\nunderstand adaptation in live-alone elders who have\nsuffered a new onset disability. The goal of this study\nwas to examine several competency variables in rela-\ntion to functional abilities and living arrangements 3\nand 6 months after hospitalization. These included\ncognition, depression, medical burden, and functional\nabilities.\nCompetency Variables Related to Adaptation\nCognitive Functioning.--Measures of cognitive func-\ntioning reflect the integrity of the brain and the ability\nto avoid disability. Epidemiological studies repeat-\nedly identify cognition as one of the significant pre-\ndictors of disability onset (Gill, Williams, Richardson,\n1998). Cognitive functioning has also been linked to\nADL recovery in hospitalized older adults (Hansen,\nMahoney, & Palta, 1999) and to change in living ar-\nrangements in live-alone elders. Decreased cognitive\nfunctioning may represent one of the more important\nperson variables that leads live-alone older adults to\nbecome more dependent. Five studies of live-alone\nhospitalized elders (Friedman, 1995; Pearlman &\ntive functioning to be an independent predictor of\nliving arrangements after discharge and delirium dur-\ning hospitalization. Cognitive decline may represent\nboth a loss of skills necessary for independence as\nwell as a marker for progressive brain disease.\nDepression.--Depression is also a predictor of\nphysical recovery from illness (Mossey, Mutran,\nKnott & Craig, 1989). Recent evidence also suggests\nthat depression precedes disability onset in many\nolder adults. Livingston, Seeman, Merrill, and Blazer\n(1994) used community-based cohorts from the Na-\ntional Institute on Aging's Established Populations for\nEpidemiological Studies of the Elderly (EPESE) to fol-\nlow 1,189 older adults. The cohort was interviewed\ntially, all subjects were independent in all ADLs. At\nthe second interview, 5.7% of men and 4.1% of\nwomen reported ADL disabilities. For both men and\nwomen, when controlling for other medical factors,\nthe presence of depression at time 1 emerged as a\nsignificant predictor of disability onset. Increased lev-\nels of depression have also been found in those el-\nders who live alone (Mui & Burnette, 1994).\nMedical Burden.--Medical burden refers to the\ncollective impact of one or more chronic medical\ndiseases. The severity of comorbid medical disease\nmay play an important role in the ability to maintain\nindependence among live-alone older adults. Mos-\nsey and colleagues (1989) described typical medical\ncomorbidities among hospitalized older adults. In\ntheir sample the mean number of health conditions\nwas 3.5, with 60% of the sample having coronary ar-\ntery disease, 53% hypertension, 51% osteoporosis\nand 46% degenerative joint disease. Medical burden\nmay exert its effects on independence indirectly\nthrough functional abilities. Moore and Lichtenberg\n(1996) presented a double cross-validation study that\nindicated a significant relationship between medical\nburden and functional abilities. Similarly, Pearlman\nand Crown (1992) found that medical burden was\nnot directly related to institutionalization but, rather,\nwas related to functional abilities.\nFunctional Abilities: ADLs and IADLs\nLawton (1983), in his Kleemeier award lecture, de-\nfined ADL and IADL abilities as the most basic com-\npetencies in gerontology. In research reviewed above\nities are demonstrated to be central to adaptation in\nolder age and to stability of residence. Sawari and\ncolleagues (1998) demonstrated that older live-alone\nwomen who report poor functional health at baseline\nwere the most likely to experience significant decline\nin functional health relative to women who lived\nwith others. Recently, Dunlop, Hughes, and Man-\nheim (1997) used longitudinal data to document the\nhierarchy of ADL disability. Walking, bathing, and\ntransferring were the first ADL abilities to decline, fol-\nlowed by dressing, toileting, and feeding.\nAims of the Study\nBecause of limitations in resources, this investiga-\ntion could only test how well competency variables\npredicted adaptation. We were not able to include\nenvironmental hazard variables in this study. Three\nhypotheses were derived, and they are focused on\nthe prediction of primary outcome (IADLs) and sec-\nondary outcome (living arrangement) measures.\n\u00b7 Hypothesis 1: The competency variables of cogni-\ntion, depression, medical burden, and performance-\nbased ADLs at discharge from the hospital will\npredict the primary functional outcome of self-\nreported IADLs at 3 and 6 months following hospi-\ntalization.\n\u00b7 Hypothesis 2: The competency variables of cogni-\ntion, depression, medical burden, and performance-\nbased ADLS during hospitalization will predict\nliving arrangement at 3 and 6 months following\nhospitalization.\n\u00b7 Hypothesis 3: The relationship between personal\ncompetency variables and living arrangement will\nbe mediated by self-reported IADLs that will directly\npredict living arrangements at those time periods.\nMethods\nParticipants\nParticipants were consecutive admissions to a free-\nstanding midwestern university-based urban medical\nrehabilitation hospital who were over the age of 60,\nliving alone prior to admission, and who agreed to\nparticipate in an interview and testing session at or\nnear discharge. Face-to-face data were collected at\nbaseline during hospitalization, and follow-up data\nwere collected by telephone interviews. Of 219 eligi-\nble individuals, 194 agreed to participate in the\nstudy, making an 87% participation rate. Only age\nand gender were collected for the nonparticipating\ngroup, and these variables did not differ from the par-\nticipating group. Competency variables collected\nincluded medical burden (Comorbidity Index),\nperformance-based ADLs (Functional Independence\nMeasure), cognition (Dementia Rating Scale), depres-\nsion (Geriatric Depression Scale), and self-reported\nADLs and IADLs (Lawton & Brody, 1969). Mean age\nof the sample was 74 years, with 72% women and\n85% African American; the group had a mean 11\nyears of education. Principal rehabilitation diagnoses\nincluded arthritic problems (28%, n  55), stroke\ntory system problems (7%, n  13); the rest were a\nrange of conditions (e.g., endocrine disorders, neo-\nplasms, spinal cord injury; 14%, n  28). In terms of\ncomplete data collection (living arrangements plus\ncompetency variables) there were 194 at baseline,\nwere due to mortality (n  21), a significant illness (n \n16) that precluded the telephone interview, signifi-\ncant cognitive dysfunction (n  12), those lost to fol-\nlow-up (n  17), and refusals (n  10). Table 1 com-\npares the characteristics of those who had complete\ndata with those who did not have complete data. The\npatients who had complete data at all three time\npoints scored significantly higher on the Mattis De-\nmentia Rating Scale (Mattis, 1988) and had less im-\npairment on the Functional Independence Measure\nat discharge, a performance-based measure of ADLs.\nthere were no differences by age, gender, race, edu-\ncation, comorbid medical illness, or level of depres-\nsive symptoms.\nMeasures\nPrimary Outcome Variable: Self-reported IADLs.--\nSelf-report of advanced self-care skills was assessed\nusing the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale\n(Lawton & Brody, 1969), which examines patient\nperceptions in the following domains: money man-\nagement, telephone use, medication management,\nand basic cooking. A total advanced self-care index\nis calculated by summing scores on the subscales for\neach participant, with a total possible score ranging\nfrom zero (reporting total impairment) to 40 (report-\ning completely intact abilities).\nSecondary Outcome Variable: Living Arrange-\nment.--Miller and colleagues (1999) have specifi-\ncally called for categorical classification of living sit-\nuation as either remaining living alone or changing\nliving arrangement to not alone. We therefore mea-\nsured living arrangement in a dichotomous fashion\n(alone vs not alone).\nPredictor Measures\nCognition.--The Dementia Rating Scale (DRS) was\ncreated for use with demented individuals and evalu-\nates domains including attention, initiation, memory,\nabstract reasoning, and visuospatial construction (Mat-\nter depending upon the patient's level of cognitive\nfunctioning. The DRS has been found to have excel-\nlent test\u00adretest reliability (r  .97) and split-half reli-\niver-Munoz, Fisher, & Empting, 1981). Concurrent\nvalidity is also satisfactory, with a significant correla-\ntion between the total DRS score and WAIS IQ score\n(1995) demonstrated that use of the DRS in cogni-\ntively intact urban older adults was useful for clinical\nand research purposes. Results from samples of\nhighly literate and educated older adults found the\nDRS to have a ceiling effect (Mattis, 1988). Vangel\nand Lichtenberg, in contrast, found the scores on the\nDRS not to display a ceiling effect in urban older\nadults, like due to lower levels of education. Indeed,\nLichtenberg (1998) reported that many commonly\nused neuropsychological tests are more likely to have\nfloor effects when used with less educated, urban\nolder adults. Bank, Yochim, MacNeill, and Lichten-\nberg (in press) have just finalized new age, and edu-\ncation-corrected norms for the DRS in older cogni-\ntively intact urban elders.\nDepression.--This was assessed using the Geriat-\nric Depression Scale (GDS; Yesavage et al., 1983).\n[The original GDS was developed for assessment\nwith geriatric populations, and is composed of 30\nyes/no self-referent statements, and has well docu-\nmented reliability and validity (Lichtenberg, 1998;\nRapp, Parisi, & Walsh,1998).] Past studies support\nTable 1. Characteristics of Individuals With Complete (n  118) and Incomplete (n  76) Data at All Three Time Points\nComplete Data Incomplete Data\nthe use of the GDS with medically ill and mild to\nmoderate cognitively impaired older adults (Lich-\ntenberg, Marcopulos, Steiner, & Tabscott, 1992;\nMedical Burden.--The comorbidity Index (CMI;\nCharlson, Pompei, Ales, & MacKenzie, 1987) was\noriginally created for use in predicting mortality. Our\nown research (Moore & Lichtenberg, 1996), and that\nby the Health Care Financing Agency (Deyo, Cher-\nkin, & Ciol, 1992), however, have found it to be a\nvalid and excellent predictor of morbidity and dis-\nability outcomes. One advantage of the CMI is that it\ncan be culled from medical record databases, thereby\nreducing the load on physicians. The CMI is both\nsensitive to severity of different diseases, and efficient\nto collect. The index was originally developed by as-\ncertaining what combination of diagnoses best pre-\ndicted 1 year mortality in a group of hospitalized\npatients (Charlson, 1987). Diseases significantly asso-\nciated with mortality were identified and weights\nequivalent to adjusted relative risks assigned. The in-\ndex was validated on a cohort of 685 medical pa-\ntients by predicting 1 year survival accounting for a\ngreater proportion of the deaths due to comorbid\nconditions than a simple measure of number of coex-\nisting conditions. The relationship of the CMI to dis-\nability was demonstrated in a double cross-validation\nstudy in which the CMI was the best predictor of ADL\nrecovery in medical rehabilitation patients (Moore &\nLichtenberg, 1996). Recently, Arfken, Lichtenberg,\nand Kuiken (1998) validated the CMI as a predictor of\nmortality using older medical rehabilitation patients.\nPerformance-Based ADL Measure.--The Functional\nIndependence Measure (FIM) is a seven-point rating\nscale created as part of the Uniform Data System for\nMedical Rehabilitation (Linacre, Heinemann, Wright,\nGranger, & Hamilton, 1994). The FIM is a perfor-\nmance-based measure that was designed to assess\nthe ability to carry out ADLs, including dressing, toi-\nleting, ambulation, and grooming. Each of 18 self-\ncare tasks is rated on a 7-point scale by a physical or\noccupational therapist ranging from completely inde-\npendent (7) to completely dependent (1). The FIM\nhas been shown to have high inter-rater reliability,\nwith an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.97 for\nthe total score (Hamilton, Laughlin, Granger, & Kay-\nton, 1991). Validity has also been demonstrated with\nbrain-injured patients and stroke patients (Cook, Smith,\n& Truman, 1994; Granger, Cotter, Hamilton, & Fied-\nler, 1993). Rasch analysis has provided support for\ntwo clinically different aspects of disability (Granger,\nHamilton, Linacre, Heinemann, & Wright, 1993; Lin-\nacre et al., 1994). Thirteen self-care and locomotion\nitems measure motor disability, and five communica-\ntion and cognition items measure cognitive disability.\ndemonstrated that a 7-item ADL scale can be used to\nmeasure feeding, dressing, grooming, transferring,\nand toileting.\nStatistical Procedures\nTo test our hypotheses, a series of path models\nthese models, the relationships between baseline\ncompetency variables and primary (IADL function-\ning) and secondary (living situation) outcomes at 3\nand 6 months following discharge were examined.\nAll models were estimated with maximum likelihood\nestimation and controlled for the effects of race, age,\nand education. In the first model, baseline compe-\ntency variables were used to predict IADL function-\ning at 3 months (IADL3) and 6 months (IADL6) post-\ndischarge. Paths were estimated between each of the\ncompetency variables and IADL functioning at 3 and\n6 months. In addition, a stability path was estimated\nbetween IADL3 and IADL6. Living situations at 3\nmonths (Alone3) and 6 months (Alone6) were added\ninto the second path model. Because Alone3 and\nAlone6 are dichotomous variables, the standard er-\nrors for the coefficients involving these two variables\nmay be underestimated and result in spuriously sig-\nnificant results. To correct for this potential problem,\nwe followed West and associates' (1995) suggestion\nto adjust the significance level to a more conservative\nResults\nOverall, the participant group represented elders\nwho had higher rates of disability and higher rates of\nservice usage than many samples of community-dwell-\ning elders. At baseline, 77% of the sample reported\nbeing fully independent with ADLs prior to hospital-\nization. This decreased to 59% at 3 months and 51%\nat 6 months. In contrast, those reporting three or more\nADL limitations grew from 10% at baseline to 14% at\n3 months and 17% at 6 months. Fifty-four percent of\nthe sample used community services at baseline, 58%\nat 3 months, and 58% at 6 months (housekeeper,\ntransportation, church volunteers, and Meals on\nWheels). Return to living alone is a dynamic charac-\nteristic that increased from 44% at baseline to 60% at\n3 months, and to 70% at 6 months. Transitions back to\nliving alone occurred equally between those dis-\ncharged to nursing homes and those discharged to\nfamilies. Living with family decreased from 28% to\nmonths. Living at a nursing home decreased from 20%\nat discharge to 11% at 3 months to 8% at 6 months.\nA model was developed to test part of the environ-\nmental press theory. Medical burden, cognition, de-\npression, and performance-based ADLs were only\ncollected at baseline, whereas self-reported func-\ntional abilities were collected at 3 and 6 months. In\neach of the models described below, age, education,\nand race were statistically controlled. Age was signif-\nRace was not significantly associated with DRS, CMI,\nFIM, or GDS. Education was significantly related to\nAs described above, in the first path, model base-\nline competency variables were used to predict IADL\nfunctioning at 3 months and 6 months postdischarge.\nThese analyses indicated that all four competency\nvariables were significant predictors of IADL3 (Betas:\npath between IADL3 and IADL6 was included, the\npredictive relationships between baseline competen-\ncies and IADL6 were fully mediated by IADL3. The\nLiving situations at 3 months (Alone3) and 6\nmonths (Alone6) were added into the second path\nmodel. In the initial form of this model, each of the\ncompetency variables predicted IADL3 and Alone3\nand Alone 6. As in the previous model, competency\nvariables significantly predicted IADL3. In addition,\nIADL3 and IADL6 both were significant predictors of\nthe living situation at their respective time periods.\nHowever, the competency variables did not add sub-\nstantially to the prediction of living situation above\nand beyond their indirect effects via IADL function-\ning, suggesting that the influence of competency vari-\nables upon living situation is mediated by IADL func-\ntioning. This final model with significant coefficients\nis pictured in Figure 1; demographic effects and error\nelements (i.e., zeta's) are not pictured in order to sim-\nplify the diagram. Each of the coefficients between\nthe competency variables and IADLs were signifi-\ncantly less than p  .05 and, as described above, the\npaths between IADL3 and Alone3 as well as IADL6\nand Alone6 are significant beyond p  .01.\nDiscussion\nIn the present study only half of Lawton's model--\nthe competency variables--could be tested. The re-\nsults, nevertheless, provide support for that part of the\ntheory in that each competency variable was directly\nrelated to functional abilities at 3 and 6 months after\nhospitalization. Futhermore, each competency vari-\nable was indirectly related to living arrangement at\nthose time periods as well. Functional ability, charac-\nterized by the IADL scale, acted as a mediator vari-\nable between the competency variables (i.e., cogni-\ntion, depression, medical burden, and ADLs), and\nliving arrangement.\nLawton's environmental press is the first theoreti-\ncal framework to be applied to the understanding of\nlive-alone elders. In this study only the impact of\ncompetency variables was assessed. One can specu-\nlate that these elders may be more vulnerable to the\nimpacts of disability because living alone requires\nbroad areas of competency. New onset disability--\ncoupled, perhaps, with increased medical problems\nand regimens, as well as decreased cognitive func-\ntioning and increased depression--makes it prohibi-\ntive for some elders to return to their homes during\nthe first 6 months after hospitalization. The theory,\nwhen fully tested, may also provide a framework for\ngerontologists to understand older adults' successful\nadaptation following medical rehabilitation. The re-\nsults clearly emphasize the importance of a variety of\ndifferent competencies that are best understood within\nan interdisciplinary context. Although medical and\nnursing personnel may best understand chronic dis-\neases and their treatments, physical and occupational\ntherapists may have the best understanding of func-\ntional abilities, and psychologists and social workers\nmay be best able to assess cognitive and affective\nfunctioning. The results clearly support the importance\nof these domains of competencies in determining ad-\naptation and both primary (functional abilities) and\nsecondary (living arrangements) health outcomes.\nGeneralizability of the findings from this study are\nclearly limited. The study participants were predomi-\nnantly urban African American elders who were hos-\npitalized for a medical rehabilitation disorder. Live-\nalone African American elders are in some ways quite\ndistinct from European American live-alone elders.\nOur sample, consistent with previous research, found\na higher level of childlessness in live-alone African\nAmericans than in European Americans (35% vs 7%).\nThe challenge of maintaining independence and\nhigh quality of life is intensified in urban Black el-\nders, both because of the racial disparities that exist\nin terms of disease prevalence and functional disabil-\nities, and because of the effects of poverty on envi-\nronmental variables. Clark (1997) presented evidence\nindicating that disabilities were not only more preva-\nlent in Black than in White elders (33% vs 22%), but\nthat racial disparities in disabilities had increased\nreported that inner city African American elders had\nworsening health, more IADL difficulties, and more\ndays of restricted activities than did samples of White\nelders. Older African American adults living in urban\nareas have also been shown to experience more\nhealth problems than did previous cohorts. For ex-\nample, Ford, Haug, Roy, Hones, and Folmar (1992)\nfound that increases in the number of African Ameri-\nFigure 1.

Of particular note\nwere higher rates of diabetes, hypertension, and the\nnumber of older adults who had four or more chronic\nhealth conditions. These same researchers also noted\nthe African Americans were at greater risk for the de-\nvelopment of mental health problems. Coward and\ncolleagues (1997) specifically investigated racial dif-\nferences in health of live-alone elders. Overall, Black\nelders had poorer health on all five indicators used,\nand the authors concluded that factors such as edu-\ncation, poverty, and gender mediated this finding.\nLiving alone may exacerbate the risk of social iso-\nlation in Black elders. Simonsick, Kasper, and Phillips\n(1998) found that older African American women who\nlived alone were at particular risk for home confine-\nment. Other researchers have specifically compared\nthe rate of residence change in Black versus White\nlive-alone elders. Older urban African American\nadults who live alone are more likely to change their\nliving arrangements and to end up living with others\nthan are urban White older adults (Choi, 1991; Hays,\nFillenbaum, Gold, Shanley, & Blazer, 1995). Rubin-\nstein, Kilbride, and Nagy (1992) documented that\n33% of the African American older adults they stud-\nied lived alone, and that women represented 77% of\nthis group. Eighty-six percent of their sample pre-\nferred to live alone, and health problems were the\npredominant reasons that living arrangements were\nchanged.\nThe present research findings serve to further in-\nform gerontologists about older live-alone African\nAmericans. Given the extra challenges of poorer\nhealth conditions, poverty and neighborhood deteri-\noration, the importance of broad-based assessments\nthat tap into all of the competencies discussed above\nare heightened. The environmental press theoretical\nframework holds great promise in its application to\nthe understanding of changing adaptation during\ntimes of changing competencies. Future investiga-\ntions should clearly measure all variables relevant to\ntheory, including home hazards, and the social envi-\nronment in which older adults live.\nReferences\nArbuckle, J. L.
