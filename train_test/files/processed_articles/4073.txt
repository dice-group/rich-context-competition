Their success is measured by scholarly productivity\nand adherence to budget by funding agencies, participating scientists, and scholars. VRCs operate in complex environments\ninteracting with other complex systems. A holistic (or organicist) approach is needed to make sense of this complexity. For\nthat purpose, this study proposes using a new perspective, namely, the complex adaptive systems theory that can provide\na better understanding of a VRC's potential creativity, adaptability, resilience, and probable success. The key concepts of\ncomplex systems (diversity, interaction, interdependency, feedback, emergence, and adaptation) utilized in organization\nstudies are used to discuss the behaviors of VRCs, illustrated with real-life examples.\n",

Seventy percent of research-\ners in the United States reported that they work together with\nan immediate group and other collaborators (National\nScience Board [NSB], 2010). In general, scientific collabora-\ntions are a family of purposeful working relationships\nbetween two or more people, groups, or organizations to\nresearch phenomena, to develop a scientific instrument or\ntechnology, to build a facility, and to publish a study (Hackett,\n2005). These collaborations have been studied extensively\nby scholars through quantitative, qualitative, or mixed-meth-\nThe nature of scientific collaborations has changed in the\nlast decade. The problems that scientists now deal with\nrequire different resources (human, technology, and equip-\nment) and having these resources in one single place is not\nalways possible. Earlier, such problems were either left alone\nor required huge resources to bring researchers together--\nneither of which is ideal. However, because of current\nadvances in information and communication technologies, a\nnew form of research collaboration has emerged: virtual\nresearch collaborations (VRCs) or distributed research\nnetworks.\nThis article offers a framework that is based on complex\nadaptive systems (CAS) to provide a more comprehensive\nunderstanding of the virtual research team dynamics. The\narticle begins with the literature on VRCs and what is miss-\ning from it, and builds the argument that VRCs are CAS.\nProviding support for this argument is a list of key CAS fea-\ntures used in organizational studies, demonstrating how they\ncorrespond to examples from real VRCs. Approaching VRCs\nfrom the CAS perspective would benefit scholars in team\nscience, organizational studies, information science, com-\nmunication studies, psychology, and even practitioners of\nvirtual team science because a holistic understanding of\nVRCs is possible through CAS.\nBackground\nAvirtual organization is \"a group of individuals whose mem-\nbers and resources may be dispersed geographically and\ninstitutionally, yet who function as a coherent unit through\nthe use of cyberinfrastructure\" (Cummings et al., 2008, p. 1).\n1NASA Astrobiology Institute, Moffett Field, CA, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nArsev Umur Aydinoglu, NASA Postdoctoral Program Fellow, NASA\nAstrobiology Institute, NASA Ames Research Center, MS: 247-6, Moffett\nEmail: arsevu@gmail.com\nToward a New Understanding of Virtual\nResearch Collaborations: Complex\nAdaptive Systems Framework\nArsev Umur Aydinoglu1\n Keywords\nvirtual research collaborations, complex adaptive systems, diversity, resilience, emergence\n2 SAGE Open\nIt is important note that entirely virtual or face-to-face teams\nrarely exist today (Bell & Kozlowski, 2002; Kirkman &\nMathieu, 2005) as generally both colocated and virtual mem-\nbers exist within an organization simultaneously; thus, virtu-\nality should be considered in terms of degree. The two key\ncharacteristics of virtual organizations are having an organi-\nzational structure without sharing a physical space, and using\ncomputer-mediated communication to function (Cogburn,\nSantuzzi, & Vasquez, 2011). Knowledge creation has become\na collaborative enterprise (Jones, Wuchty, & Uzzi, 2008;\nWuchty et al., 2007). The number of internationally coau-\nthored papers has tripled in the last two decades (NSB,\n2010), demonstrating the prominent shift toward VRCs.\nVRCs are different from traditional scientific collabora-\ntions in a couple of areas. By definition, VRCs are not bound\nby geographical proximity. As research questions have\nbecome more complex and address large-scale phenomena\nsuch as climate change, space science, or energy sources, it\nhas become too difficult to maintain the necessary expertise\nto tackle these problems in one physical location. The diver-\nsity of researchers' affiliations and geographical locations in\na research network is an indicator of distribution. In addition,\naddressing these complex questions requires responses from\nexperts in different fields or disciplines. The researchers,\nworking from various locations, have adopted digital col-\nlaboration tools for communication and data/information\nsharing to succeed in their efforts. Communication software\nsuch as Skype, Adobe Connect, and Google Cam; document\nand data sharing tools such as Dropbox, Google Docs, and\nSkydrive; and collaborative research tools and cyberinfra-\nstructure such as WorldWide Telescope and DataONE are\nsome of the digital collaboration tools that have become\nincreasingly prominent in researchers' lives. The VRCs' dis-\ntributed and diverse networks tend to be less structured and\nhierarchical as they operate with a more flexible organiza-\ntional structure. This does not imply that they are leaderless;\ngenerally, there is a core group of individuals who drives the\nVRC's collaboration, in addition to the principal\ninvestigator(s), who is/are responsible to the funding agency.\nTable 1 summarizes the differences between traditional and\nvirtual collaborations.\nVirtual scientific collaboration has become a necessity\nand almost a norm to conduct scientific activity. However,\nvirtual organizations have their intrinsic challenges:\n(1) logistical problems, such as communicating and coordinating\nwork across time and space, (2) interpersonal concerns, such as\nestablishing effective working relationships with team members\nin the absence of frequent face-to-face communication, and\n(3) technology issues, such as identifying, learning, and using\ntechnologies most appropriate for certain tasks. (Furst et al.,\nResearch on virtual organizations is relatively new, but\naddresses a wide range of issues. According to a study\nconducted by Powell, Piccoli, and Ives (2004) using a life\ncycle model, studies on virtual organizations focus on four\ngeneral categories: (a) input (design, culture, training),\n(b) socioemotional processes (trust, cohesion, relationship\nbuilding), (c) task processes (communication, coordination,\ntask-technology fit), and (d) output (performance, satisfac-\ntion). The network characteristics (e.g., centrality, hubs, and\nincoming/outgoing links) of virtual organizations have\nbecome a fertile research area lately, because of the advances\nin social network analysis. For instance, Cronin and Meho\ntionship between network traits and its performance, and\nPanzarasa, Opsahl, and Carley (2009) focused on informa-\ntion flow and team dynamics.\nThe growing number of multidisciplinary research proj-\nects has increased the number of studies on the diversity of\nvirtual teams as well. For instance, when there is too much\ndiversity1 researchers establish cliques, stop communicating,\nand even disrupt each other's efforts (Adamic & Glance,\nscholars have investigated the performance (generally based\non scholarly/nonscholarly production and adherence to bud-\nget and deadlines) of virtual teams (Ancona & Caldwell,\nstandard, and there is a vast literature on coauthorship prac-\ntices; however, its limitations have also been documented in\ninformation science. It is hard to differentiate the contribu-\ntion of a scientific collaboration's members, such as when\nhyperauthorship (publications with more than 100 coauthors)\nor honorary authorship (a person is listed as a coauthor for\nthe sake of reputation not contribution) exist, or even in some\ncases when the efforts of certain members might not be\nreflected in the article's authorship (Katz & Martin, 1997;\nspective, we can explore not only coauthorship practices but\nalso different dynamics of virtual collaborations.\nAll of the studies mentioned above are valuable additions\nto the scientific body of knowledge; however, there are two\nTable 1.

VRC = virtual research collaborations.\nAydinoglu 3\nshortcomings in the literature on virtual research organiza-\ntions. First, the existing studies that address scientific\nresearch contexts focus on small teams or groups. To date,\nstudies that considered larger organizations were set only in\ncommercial organizations or business virtual teams, not sci-\nence organizations (Kirkman, Gibson, & Kim, 2012; Martins,\nGilson, & Maynard, 2004). Although there are some simi-\nlarities between profit-based (commercial) and non-profit-\nbased (research) virtual organizations; they are actually\ndifferent kinds of organizations because of their raison\nd'\u00eatre, which are respectively profit and answering a research\nquestion. In addition, an understanding of their dynamic\ncomposition and evolution is needed (Tannenbaum, Mathieu,\nSalas, & Cohen, 2012), as VRCs operate for many years and\nteam composition changes, as members graduate, move on\nto new projects, retire, or otherwise transition from the team.\nSecond, there is a gap in the existing literature on virtual\nresearch organizations that also applies to every kind of sci-\nentific collaboration, virtual or otherwise, which is that the\nstudies tend to treat research teams as traditional organiza-\ntions. However, in today's interconnected world, most of\nthem are actually CAS, which resist reductionist explana-\ntions, exhibit unpredictable behavior, create a disproportion-\nate impact, and are highly interactive within themselves and\nwith their environment. Briefly, complex systems are based\non nonlinear relationships among the system's components,\nand they are nonreductionist (Mitleton-Kelly, 2003). A non-\nlinear system's behavior cannot be explained through a lin-\near equation. The literature on virtual teams uses linear\ntheories to explain their behaviors. As it was pointed out in\nFalk-Krzesinski et al. (2011), \"What is key to recognize is\nthat linear or sequential process models could not adequately\ncapture the complexity inherent in SciTS [Science of Team\nScience] and may even be misleading,\" and referring to\nMabry, Olster, Morgan, and Abrams (2008), they suggest a\ncomplex systems approach.\nThere are a limited number of studies that approach VRCs\nfrom a CAS theory perspective. Aragon and Williams (2011)\nfocus on collaborative creativity. Murase, Doty, Wax,\nDeChurch, and Contractor (2012) highlight a network\napproach to capture multilevel interactions. Wagner (2008)\nproposes research networks between developed and develop-\ning nations for development, Naik and Kim (2010) develop a\nframework to explain the VRCs' success through adaptation.\nCureu (2006) treats team cohesion, trust, and conflict as\nemergent states in virtual teams and brings them together\nthrough the CAS perspective.\nComplexity Theory\nThere is not a single unified theory of complex systems\nInstead, there are different foci and approaches, such as that\nof the Santa Fe Institute or Prigogine or interpretations in\nsocial sciences (Cudworth & Hobden, 2012; Merali &\nties with chaos theory and other concepts from biology,\nphysics, and chemistry, such as catastrophe, autopoiesis,\nchaos, dissipative structures, autocatalytic process, attrac-\ntors, multiagent systems, thresholds, and transformational\nprocesses, fractal geometry, fuzzy logic, and systems theory\nScholars define CAS according to their disciplinary interests\nand focus on related concepts, respectively. Therefore, one\nhas to be careful about substituting these concepts, because\neven though there might be a huge overlap among them, they\nare not the same. For instance, autopoiesis, introduced by\nMaturana and Varela (1973), means self (auto) creation (poi-\nesis), which is different from self-organization, which is a\ncritical concept in complexity theory (explained later).\nuse the notion of self-organization, because it cannot be the\ncase . . . it is impossible. That is, if the organization of a thing\nchanges, the thing changes.\" Another example is chaotic sys-\ntems, which are nonlinear like complex systems, yet very\ndifferent in that chaotic systems are not emergent and their\nconstituents are not interdependent. In short, one has to be\ncareful using these concepts for complexity theory.\nA very prominent feature of complex systems is the non-\nlinear interactions among its variables. However, since\nDescartes, linear modeling has dominated the scientific\nworld because of its freshness, competence, and convenience\nfor calculations. Linear systems are simple and determinis-\ntic, and therefore, variables in linear systems can be manipu-\nlated (at least theoretically) and are definitely predictable.\nThe main hypothesis behind this view is that a phenomenon\nis the aggregation of its components--which are variables--\nso it should be broken down into its smallest units and they\nshould be studied to understand it.\nHowever, many phenomena in life are neither linear, nor-\nreducible into simplistic units, nor both. A nonlinear system\nis more than the sum of its parts due to feedback loops\n(Waldrop, 1992). In nonlinear systems, small inputs can have\nlarge system effects (or vice versa), and there is a sensitivity\nto initial conditions that makes prediction almost impossible\nThe problem is that working with nonlinear systems is\nbeyond human computational ability. When nonlinear rela-\ntions are realized, the related data are not preserved and/or\nthe nonlinear relations cannot be measured or calculated due\nto their complexity. This happens because \"modeling the\nnonlinear outcomes of many interacting components has\nbeen so difficult that both social and natural scientists have\ntended to select more analytically tractable problems\"\nincomplete reflections of reality. Thus, scholars end up with\na discipline that is not consistent with natural phenomena,\nand is not helpful for controlling or predicting phenomena,\nas a result of its dependency on linear modeling. Sometimes\nnonlinear relationships were simply disregarded by\n4 SAGE Open\nTable 2.

For\ninstance, in economics it is assumed that \"there is equilib-\nrium in markets,\" despite all the opposing evidence (Waldrop,\ntems are assumed to be in equilibrium (Bentley & Maschner,\n2007). Both these assumptions contradict reality. Because of\nits messiness, the study of nonlinear systems had not attracted\nmuch interest until the 1960s, when, with the development of\ncomputers, computational power increased enormously, and\nthus, solving nonlinear equations became easy (Gleick,\n1987). Consequently, physicists, meteorologists, economists,\nand chemists adapted nonlinear models for their disciplines.\nThe main difference between linear and nonlinear sys-\ntems is the focus of attention given by researchers to vari-\nables and interaction, respectively. Instead of focusing on\nunits, in complexity theory, researchers focus on interac-\ntions. Interaction is an intricate relationship among units or\nvariables and is generally short ranged (Cilliers, 1998). For\nexample, information is generally received from immediate\nneighbors. As the information travels from unit to unit, it can\nbe enhanced, suppressed, or altered in many ways, such as in\nthe telephone game. Positive and negative feedback loops\nexist in interactions; hence, some actions are encouraged and\nsome discouraged. Everything that is related to the system\ncould be found in interactions, and the level of analysis\nbecomes interactions in complexity theory. As Nobel laure-\nate chemist Prigogine (1997) argued, this new paradigm is\ninterested in instability, disorder, diversity, and nonlinear\nrelationships, rather than the traditional mechanistic\nNewtonian view, which dealt with stability, order, equilib-\nrium, and linear relationships.\nThere is not a unified CAS theory, but in definitions there\nare some indispensible concepts, such as agents, interaction,\ncoevolution, and emergence. Here two definitions are\noffered:\nThe theory of complex adaptive systems (CAS) originated in the\nnatural sciences and articulates how interacting agents in\nsystems adapt and coevolve over time, and who, through their\ninteractions, produce novel and emergent order in creative and\nA complex adaptive system consists of a large number of agents,\neach of which behaves according to some set of rules. These\nrules require the agents to adjust their behavior to that of other\nagents. In other words, agents interact with, and adapt to, each\nAccording to Kauffman (1993), when the relationships\nare simple, the system's behavior is easy to understand,\nexplain, and predict, which is what is done in linear model-\ning. In the other extreme, when immeasurable nonlinearity\ndominates the system, it looks random and chaotic.\nComplexity, sometimes referred to as \"order in disorder,\" is\nbetween them, not easy to understand, but not impossible\neither.\nComplexity theory focuses on \"organizing rather than\norganization\" (Weick, 1979) and prescribes, \". . . science of\nprocess rather than state, of becoming rather than being\"\n(Gleick, 1987). It is continuous recreation of interactions and\nrelations between units, which also results in dynamic equi-\nlibrium. It is this continuous recreation, redefinition, and\nemergence that makes it harder to understand, predict, and\nequalize.\nAccording to Holland (1998), in complex systems, over-\nall patterns are greater than the sum of its parts, and also,\nsuch systems may act coherently without domination by a\ncentral source, which means the system cannot be localized\nto its subsets. This approach suggests the bounded rationality\nprinciple. The units cannot know the big picture due to lack\nof information and their limited information processing abil-\nity. They can only know about their immediate neighbors.\nThus, they position themselves according to them. This con-\ncept is very common in explaining survival and extinction in\nhabitats in evolutionary biology. No creature knows what is\ngoing on in this planet, but they all position themselves in\nrelation to their cohabitants, by developing camouflage skills\nto hide or growing muscles to run faster, for example. The\nwhole habitat is in a state of dynamic equilibrium tied to each\nagent. This is called coevolution (Pascale, Millemann, &\nring concepts in the analysis of organizations from a CAS\nAydinoglu 5\nperspective using seminal articles from the organization sci-\nence literature.\nA human system, such as a VRC, is a CAS; therefore, it\nneeds to be studied as one. However, the growing body of\nliterature on the topic does not treat them as such. Through\nCAS, a VRC could be studied from a micro to a macro level,\nand even to the environment that it operates within. Here are\nthe features of CAS that are used to develop a framework,\nwhich will help researchers to understand VRCs better and\nhelp them to use their potential.\nCASs Framework for VRCs\nLarge Number of Diverse Agents\nFor a system to be considered a complex system there must\nbe multiple agents interacting with each other. These agents\nare different vectors or have different agendas and they try to\npull or influence the system accordingly. The more the\nagents/vectors, the greater the likelihood of encountering\nchaos or complexity (Thietart & Forgues, 1995). It looks like\na messy, chaotic bunch that does not have a purpose or make\nsense.\nBy definition this characteristic exists in a VRC, for which\na number of researchers and/or organizations establish a\nworking relationship to conduct research, to develop an\ninstrument or technology, to build a facility, and to publish a\nstudy. Furthermore, although every agent works toward the\nsame goal, the raison d'\u00eatre of the collaboration, every agent\nalso has his own objectives. These individual objectives are\nnot necessarily aligned with each other, but instead, are\naffecting and being affected by each other. \"In each system,\neach agent is different from the others (diversity), and its per-\nformance depends on the other agents and the system itself,\neach of which can influence the other's behavior\" (Benbya &\nMcKelvey, 2006, p. 18). This diversity at certain conditions\nresults in an emergent property. A system's behavior cannot\nbe reduced to a single agent's behavior, because diversity\nand variety give each agent a different role (or vector;\nHolland, 1995). There is no single dominant vector in the\nsystem. Each one is a counteracting force in the system try-\ning to actualize its own goals. This is the reason why it looks\nlike incomprehensible behavior.\nVRCs exhibit this feature. For instance, in a VRC, in\nterms of academic career advancement, there will be a diver-\nsified group of researchers, ranging from senior researchers\nto junior researchers to graduate students (or even under-\ngraduates), with each having a different goal, such as advanc-\ning the quality of human lives, getting tenure, collecting data\nfor a dissertation, enhancing a reputation, engaging in com-\npetition, and so on. This diversity does not have to be limited\nto academia. There might be researchers from research cen-\nters, laboratory staff from labs, and engineers with different\naffiliations--each, again, with different personal agendas. In\naddition, there could be contractors, such as software\ndevelopers from industry, whose goal is to make profits. In\ncross-disciplinary projects, disciplinary diversity should be\ntaken into consideration as well--each with different work-\nflows, value and belief systems, and backgrounds. This is\nonly an individual level diversity. Sectoral and organiza-\ntional diversity could be added to this example, when public-\nprivate partnerships exist, and/or inclusion of nonprofit\norganizations. This simple example demonstrates how dif-\nferent motivations and goals would create counteracting\nforces in a system.\nInteraction/Connectivity/Interdependence\nInteraction could be limited in physical systems. They are\nsimple, predictable, and linear, with little room for surprises\nor changes. Human systems, however, are based on interac-\ntions. \"Complex behaviour arises from the inter-relationship,\ninteraction, and interconnectivity of elements within a sys-\ntem and between a system and its environment\" (Mitleton-\nsystem definition asserts, \"(a system is complex when) . . .\nthere are strong interactions among its elements, so that cur-\nrent events heavily influence the probabilities of many kinds\nof later events.\" The action of one agent has an impact on\nother agents and even on other systems.\nMerali (2006) describes an interconnected world as \"a\ncomplex multi-dimensional network which connects a diver-\nsity of agents (individuals, groups, institutions, nations, com-\nputers, software components, etc.) through multiple and\ndiverse communication channels\" (p. 217). A VRC fits the\nbill. In a VRC, researchers (agents) have to interact with each\nother because that is the reason they come together in the\nfirst place. They need each other's expertise, resources, repu-\ntation, or other attributes; hence, they interact. Their research\nis also interdependent, especially in inter- and transdisci-\nplinary projects. For instance, in a VRC that studies climate\nchange, environmental scientists, atmospheric scientists,\nmarine scientists, ecologists, biologists, and even social sci-\nentists have to interact with each other, design their research\nso that they get input from each other, report their findings to\neach other, and then continue doing this cycle over and over,\nfor they operate in a system where everything is connected to\neach other. They interact through print (journals, reports,\netc.), online (emails, data repositories, videocons, etc.), and\nface-to-face media (conferences, workshops, etc.) as much\nas they can.\nThe more interdependent their tasks, the more researchers\nhave to interact, if they want to succeed. For instance, the\nmembers of the Goddard Center for Astrobiology, a VRC\nfunded by the NASA Astrobiology Institute [NAI], investi-\ngate \"how organic compounds are created, destroyed, and\naltered during the formation and evolution of a planetary sys-\ntem, leading up to the origin of life on a planet such as Earth\"\n(NAI, 2012). Thirty-one researchers from seven different\ninstitutions in the United States examine the distribution of\n6 SAGE Open\norganic matter and water in the solar system and how they\nwere delivered to Earth. The astronomers and physicists in\nthe team establish taxonomy of icy bodies and their potential\nfor organics and water, chemists analyze the formation, dis-\ntribution, and abundance of organics with the input from\nastronomers, geochemists, earth scientists, and microbiolo-\ngists investigate processes affecting the origin and evolution\nof organics in planetary systems along with astronomers. The\nsuccess of the collaboration depends on the interaction\namong researchers from different disciplines. In fact, the col-\nlaboration is designed to make researchers from disciplines\nwork together, because their tasks are interdependent. They\nfrequently use face-to-face (when possible) and remote col-\nlaboration technologies to interact with each other. Because\nthe members of the Goddard team are affiliated with seven\ndifferent organizations, their interaction relies on the use of\ninformation and communication technologies.\nFeedback, Unpredictability, and Nonlinearity\nA group of diverse researchers who interact with each other\nto achieve individual and organizational goals is clearly a\nsystem.Any communication or action will have an impact on\nits members; however, this impact does not have to be pro-\nportional. Indeed, it is highly likely that the impact will be\ndifferent on each agent, due to diversity. Because of the non-\nlinear relationships, the impact might have an amplifying\neffect (positive feedback) on some members, and might have\na dampening effect on others (negative feedback). Feedback\nloops are typical of nonlinear (and complex) systems and are\none of the main sources of unpredictability in CAS. In addi-\ntion, these feedback mechanisms or processes are the pri-\nmary reason why scholars cannot isolate a variable and study\nit in isolation. This feature results in the principle that the\nwhole is greater than the sum of its parts.AsAnderson (1999)\nputs it, \". . . complex systems resist simple reductionist anal-\nyses, because interconnections and feedback loops preclude\nholding some subsystems constant in order to study others in\nisolation\" (p. 218). Because of transfer of energy or informa-\ntion among agents, impacts lose their proportion. The\nstrength of the feedback process is often determined by the\ndegree of the connectivity (Mitleton-Kelly, 2003). The\nimpact does not have to be equal on others. Some might be\naffected more--which makes sense because agents do not\nknow the big picture; they are affected by their immediate\nneighbors. Like in the Chinese telephone game, the impact is\ndisturbed by each agent; thus, a uniform impact on each\nagent almost never happens.\nKirkman et al. (2012) argued that virtual team develop-\nment is described as nonlinear, referring to the relationships\nbetween the organizational environment, group structure,\ntechnology, and diversity. In VRCs, through interaction and\ninterdependency, there are constant feedback loops at play,\nwhere impacts might be amplified or dampened, but are defi-\nnitely untraceable. As discussed earlier, team members\nprovide input to each other's research; however, where a\nsenior scholar sees an opportunity to collaborate, a junior\nscholar might sense a threat to his or her career. In addition,\nsome members might have more pull than others and their\nimpact might be disproportionate to their seniority or exper-\ntise. The response of a researcher in a commercial organiza-\ntion to a cyberinfrastructure designed to share data, could be\ndifferent from that of a researcher in a government agency. In\nshort, reactions will vary. Furthermore, because of bounded\nrationality, agents have limited information on the overall\nstate of the network or system. The individual actions, which\nare affected by agents' \"diverse social and cultural environ-\nments and backgrounds, their personal experiences, and\nevents, and information about events from their immediate\nenvironment and their extended networks\" (Merali, 2006,\np.218), will give rise to an emergent behavior of the network.\nThe results of these nonlinear relationships are simply\nunpredictable.\nThe feedback loops and nonlinear relationships create a\ncondition called sensitivity to initial conditions--which\nresults in unpredictability. The butterfly effect--a butterfly\nin the Amazon flaps its wings and causes a tornado in\nTexas--is the famous example of sensitivity to initial condi-\ntions. Anderson observes, \". . . the behavior of complex pro-\ncesses can be quite sensitive to small differences in initial\nconditions, so that two entities with very similar initial states\ncan follow radically divergent paths over time\" (Anderson,\nresearchers could doom the collaboration from the start; it is\nnot easy to fix such problems through computer-mediated\ncommunication. Another example could be the anxiety and\ndiscomfort that some members feel toward computer-medi-\nated communication. The leadership team should take these\ninto consideration when establishing the VRC.\nThe Edge of Chaos/Far From Equilibrium\nSystems do not stay in equilibrium forever. They react to\ninternal and external (environmental) factors, and equilib-\nrium changes. They can exist or fluctuate between three\nstates: stable, chaotic, and in-between (Anderson, 1999;\nForgues, 1995). The \"in-between\" phase is actually when the\nsystem behaves in a \"complex\" way. Scholars named this\nphase differently: for Kauffman, it was the melting zone, for\nCramer, critical complexity, for McKelvey, the region of\nand for Pascale et al. (2000)--the edge of chaos. This is\nwhere action takes place and emergence happens. In this\nzone, according to Mitleton-Kelly (2003), \"open systems\nexchange energy, matter, or information with their environ-\nment, and when pushed `far-from-equilibrium,' create new\nstructures and order\" (p. 10). Here, higher levels of mutation\nand experimentation happen, which could become critical in\na system's resistance or response to external threats (Pascale\nAydinoglu 7\net al., 2000). Being away from equilibrium gives the system\na chance to come up with a better configuration that increases\nthe likelihood of its survival.\nAVRC that is ordered, rigid, and top-down does not oper-\nate in this zone. It cannot respond to the changes in the envi-\nronment and be adaptive. A VRC that is on the other\nend--chaos--is actually not a system or a collaboration any-\nmore. It cannot reach the criticality that is needed for emer-\ngence. The leader (or the management) of the VRC is\nresponsible for creating such an environment where the\nmembers can thrive. Creativity, novelty, and innovation can-\nnot happen without a little serendipity.\nFurthermore, funding for a collaboration is not a short-\nterm investment. During the life of a collaboration, member-\nship composition changes. After the funding comes through,\nthe very first thing a VRC does is to employ new postdoc-\ntoral researchers and graduate students. Graduate students\ngraduate or might be assigned to different projects; postdoc-\ntoral researchers might find other jobs and move on to other\nresearch areas; depending on the progress of the project, new\nexpertise might be needed, and thus, new staff (in different\nlevels) might be employed; new collaborators might join the\nproject; researchers could retire, pass away, change jobs and\nresearch interests and thus leave membership. In a nutshell,\nteam composition, team dynamics, and team capabilities do\nchange over the years. Nothing is in a static equilibrium and\na dynamic analysis--such as temporal team composition\ndata or temporal network analysis--is needed.\nEmergence, Self-Organization, and Strange\nAttractors\nWhen the system receives energy, matter, or information, it\nabsorbs them until it reaches the critical point--which is the\nedge of chaos. At this point, through the interactions among\nagents, excess energy, matter, or information generates a\nform, pattern, behavior, or structure. This is called emer-\ngence or self-organization. Emergence is the process whereby\nthe global behavior of a system results from the actions and\ninteractions of agents (Sawyer, 2005). The emergent struc-\nture is neither planned nor predicted. As Anderson (1999)\nputs it, \". . . complex systems tend to exhibit `self-organiz-\ning' behavior; starting in a random state, they usually evolve\ntoward order instead of disorder\" (p. 218). This does not con-\ntradict the second law of thermodynamics, because of the\nexcess energy (or information) the system received. Benbya\nreferring to Kauffman, Cramer, and McKelvey: \"In other\nwords, new behavior patterns appear as consequences of\nagent interaction. No single program or agent completely\ndetermines the system's behavior, despite the fact that each\nof the heterogeneous agents holds some common schemata.\nThese systems self-organize when they find themselves in\nthe `region of emergent complexity' at the `edge of chaos'\nagent contributes to the emergent property differently; thus,\nit is unpredictable.\nThese novel forms, patterns, and structures emerge around\nthe excess energy, matter, or information, which are strange\nattractors (Anderson, 1999) for importing is more likely to\noccur into an open system, and the more open it is, the more\nlikely the attraction will occur. At this point, around attrac-\ntion, complexity (or chaos) gets ordered and becomes an\nidentifiable configuration (Thietart & Forgues, 1995). A new\norder (equilibrium) is reached. In human systems, it gener-\nally creates irreversible structures or relationships (Mitleton-\nKelly, 2003), such as national education systems or the\nconcept of minimum wage. Some scholars perceive the\nemergence as the most important feature of complexity the-\nory (Sawyer, 2005) because every feature so far serves its\noccurrence. A great number of diverse agents interact and\nfeed each other in a special environment where the system\nreaches a critical point, so that a relationship, form, or pattern\n\"emerges.\"\nIn VRCs, an emergent property could be a new working\ngroup that arises as a response to a new question or phenom-\nenon that must be dealt with before forward progress can\noccur. Another example is a publication or a patent or a prod-\nuct (such as a software, cyberinfrastructure, or protein). The\nmembers might decide that their investigation has reached a\ncritical point where it needs to be shared with the rest of the\nscientific community. A collegial relationship could emerge\nthat passes beyond the lifetime of the project and turns into a\nnetwork or an invisible college. A group of concerned scien-\ntists could coauthor white papers or peer-reviewed publica-\ntions that could result in an emergence of a science mission\nor a research field, such as climate research. The severity and\nmagnitude of the problem (climate change led to infinite\nnumbers of VRCs working on it) or an opportunity (a volca-\nnic eruption gave birth to an island in 2011 and led to a VRC\nfunded by NAI to study it) or available resources (NSF Data\nSolicitation led to forming of DataONE, a VRC that emerged\nto develop a cyberinfrastructure for Earth Science data)\ncould act as an attractor and cause VRCs to form around\nthem. These emergences are generally self-organized and\nform from the bottom-up. It is hard to predict these events. A\nrigid management style might deter such emergences, and\npossibly harm productivity and performance of the collabo-\nration. Letting the VRC loose is not an option either, as the\nleaders--principal investigator(s)--are responsible to the\nfunding agency, and there are certain deadlines that have to\nbe met. For financial systems, which are basically human\ngovernments should avoid both extremes of coercing a desired\noutcome and keeping strict hands off, and instead seek to push\nthe system gently toward favored structures that can grow and\nemerge naturally. Not a heavy hand, not an invisible hand, but a\n8 SAGE Open\nThis suggestion is very applicable to the governance and\nmanagement of VRCs.\nAdaptation to Environment (Context)\nThe emergent property is the adaptation or the new tempo-\nrary equilibrium, depending on where one looks. The system\ncannot continue as it was, and through generating new pat-\nterns, forms, behaviors, relationships, and structures, it\nadapts to the new conditions and environment. Having just\none strategy or one kind of agent is not desirable, because\nwhen the conditions change, that strategy or agent may no\nlonger be optimal or suitable (Mitleton-Kelly, 2003; Pascale\net al., 2000). It could result in annihilation. Thus, systems do\nnot spend all of their resources on one objective, but instead,\nthey try to have diversity and variation, which builds on\nresilience. For instance, the immune system has multiple\nmechanisms, not one, to respond to pathogens. Or, compa-\nnies invest in research and development, and training, to be\nable to respond to changing market conditions. McKelvey\n(2001) defines this process as \"adaptive tension.\" If systems\ndo not explore this \"space of possibilities,\" they become\nfragile.\nThe natural laws for molecular systems or DNAin organic\nsystems, or consciousness, or rules or relationships in human\nsystems, are actually all schemas for the actions of agents;\ntheir actions are bound to these schemas. \"The existence of\nthese shared schemas, together with the agents' individual\nschemas (diversity), opens up the possibility of changes to\nthese rules, or in other words, evolution and learning\"\nchange, and that change is adaptation; that change is learn-\ning--and it is crucial to survival.\nIn the VRC context, a new approach or structure might be\nneeded to tackle a research question. For instance, in 2008\nMars Rover Phoenix identified perchlorate in the Martian\nregolith. A new approach was definitely needed to investi-\ngate them. Therefore, NAI funded a VRC that studied per-\nchlorate at Mars analog sites (NAI, 2012). Another example\nis from DataONE. They established a new working group--\nexploration, visualization, and analysis--that was not in the\noriginal plan, when they realized that they could promote\ntheir project and increase its acceptance and diffusion among\nthe scientific community through visualization, and also do\nmore science with it (Aydinoglu, 2011). VRCs become more\nflexible and change their structure to respond to the changes\ninside (the collaboration itself) and outside (the environ-\nment). Their resilience improves and thus they adapt.\nCoevolution/Multidimensional\nThe adaptation, and thus the evolution, are not alone but are\ntogether--including the environment, which is a collection\nof systems with other agents. Every agent in the system is\ninterconnected to each other, and feedback mechanisms\ncarry information from one to another; hence, a change in\none creates a response (and change) in another, then that one\nin another, and so on. It continues like that until every agent\nrepositions (changes or mutates) him/herself. In Stacey's\n(2003) definition of a CAS, this feature becomes clearer:\nA complex adaptive system consists of a large number of agents,\neach of which behaves according to some set of rules. These\nrules require the agents to adjust their behavior to that of other\nagents. In other words, agents interact with, and adapt to, each\nother. (p. 2)\nThis is in fact a continuous cycle: \"As the elements react,\nthe aggregate changes; as the aggregate changes, elements\nagents cannot adapt, they do not survive; they become extinct\nor die or leave the system. The same concept is named \"struc-\ntured coupling\" in living systems by Maturana (2002). He\ndescribes the dynamic interplay between the entity and its\nenvironment as such:\nIn this process the structure of the living system and the structure\nof the medium change together congruently as a matter of\ncourse, and the general result is that the history of interactions\nbetween two or more structure determined systems becomes a\nhistory of spontaneous recursive coherent structural changes in\nwhich all the participant systems change together congruently\nuntil they separate or disintegrate. I have called this structural\ndynamics, including the structural coherences between the\ninteracting systems that results from it, structural coupling. (pp.\nagree that the \"interrelationships between parts and their\nrelationships to a functioning whole, [is] often understood\nwithin the context of an even greater whole,\" which is the\nmantra of CAS. For instance, the scientific arena is very\ncompetitive about securing resources, because these\nresources are directly correlated to the survival of an indi-\nvidual scientist or a collaboration. In addition, because of the\ninteractive network structure, it is very dynamic. VRCs are\nopen systems. Emergent properties (information, best prac-\ntices, opportunities, methodologies, structures, etc.) are\nshared, disseminated, and adapted at an increasing rate. In\nfact, the whole process of academic publishing is about dis-\nseminating and sharing. None of the elements can be cut out.\nBecause subsystems are open systems and there is inter-\naction among them that leads to coevolution, the unit of anal-\nysis becomes a moving target. An agent could affect a\nsystem; a system could affect other systems. In CAS theory,\nthese continuous impacts are explained through fractals--\nself-similar patterns at different scales. Thietart and Forgues\n(1995) argue that organizations generally have a fractal form.\nFurthermore, similar patterns, structures, and behaviors are\nfound at the organizational, unit, group, and individual lev-\nels. The effects are both contagious and similar. For instance,\nAydinoglu 9\nan individual's decision to sell stocks in the market might be\nrepresented at the market level--which means everybody is\nselling that same stock. (The emergent property is the decline\nin that stock's price). Moreover, it is contagious among dif-\nferent types of systems. \"Complex systems are multidimen-\nsional, and all the dimensions interact and influence each\nother. In a human context the social, cultural, technical, eco-\nnomic and global dimensions may impinge upon and influ-\nence each other\" (Mitleton-Kelly, 2003, p. 5). Given that the\nsystem is functioning under the right conditions, a change in\na researcher's behavior could change a team's behavior,\nwhich could change a VRC's behavior, which could change\nother VRCs' behaviors, which could change a funding agen-\ncy's behavior, which could change other funding agencies'\nbehaviors, which could change the scientific arena, which\ncould change the economics of a nation, and so on. An exam-\nple of this effect is the Internet, which originated as basically\na military technology, but has changed so much in our scien-\ntific, economic, educational, and social lives.\nThis is a holistic or organismic view--where all of the\nelements are connected to each other, and by changing them-\nselves they are changing everything around them. This con-\ncept is closely related to previous concept: adaptation to\nenvironment--or learning (conscious or unconscious). An\never-changing environment requires new responses (which\nhas to be discovered, developed, or learned from others) to\nsurvive. Kolb and Kolb (2009) uses structural coupling,\nwhich is \"the way a system interacts with its environment,\nrecurrently renewing and recreating itself. . . . These struc-\ntural changes produce changes in the future behavior of the\nsystem and its environment\" to describe the process of an\norganism's learning and development (p. 311). Organizations\ndo learn in a similar fashion; therefore, by learning and\nadapting, the habitat and the entities inside it change.\nFurthermore, Kirkman et al. (2012) addresses the need\nand lack of multilevel analysis from agents to system. Given\nthe fractal structure of CAS and the systems approach, analy-\nsis at different levels can be possible. An ecosystem or\norganicist approach through a CAS understanding might\nreveal the relationships among individual researchers, teams,\nother teams (multiteam systems), organizations, and even\nbeyond. Thus, our understanding of the nonlinear relation-\nships between the effectiveness of an individual and a team,\nthe impact of research, the effectiveness of a lab, the impact\nof a research funding program, and so on would increase\nenormously. Clearly, more research is needed to explore the\nmultilevel relationships in VRCs.\nConclusion\nThe nature of scientific collaborations has changed, as a\nresult of the advancements in information and communica-\ntion technologies. The environment in which scientific col-\nlaborations operate has changed because of technological,\neconomic, political, and social transformations. Therefore, a\nnew understanding of VRCs is needed for scholars, practitio-\nners, and the funding agencies.\nCAS theory deals with how interacting agents in a\ndynamic system adapt, coevolve, and produce novel struc-\ntures. The framework developed in this study through CAS\ntheory concepts (diversity, interaction, interdependency,\nfeedback, emergence, and adaptation) provides us with a\nholistic and comprehensive perspective to assess the poten-\ntial creativity, adaptability, resilience, and probable success\nof VRCs. VRCs are indeed diverse (with multiple goals, dis-\nciplines, and organizations involved), interacting and provid-\ning feedback (as members communicate with each other\nfrequently), interdependent (individual tasks are connected\nto each other), and emergent (new relationships are estab-\nlished and publications, technology, software, and equip-\nment are produced and shared with others). VRCs are\nintrinsically adaptive (proactively changing their environ-\nment, while also reactively being changed by it). Table 3\nmatches the CAS concepts with VRCs.\nFalk-Krzesinski et al. (2011) identified seven research\nareas critical to the future of the science of team science\n(including virtual teams): (a) measurement and evaluation of\nteam science; (b) structure and context for teams; (c) charac-\nteristics and dynamics of teams; (d) management and organi-\nzation of teams; (e) institutional support and professional\ndevelopment for teams; (f) disciplinary dynamics and team\nscience; and (g) definitions and models of team science.\nThrough the CAS framework, these research areas can be\nstudied together or the findings from previous studies can be\nbrought together. For instance, using the CAS Framework,\nthe potential success and capability of a collaboration could\nbe evaluated prior to the funding agencies' committing their\nalready limited resources to support that collaboration. The\npublication record of the grant proposers is an important\nmetric for evaluation, yet it is a limited tool for predicting the\nsuccess of the venture. The CAS Framework, being an\norganicist or holistic approach, considers not only the\nTable 3.

Referring back to Falk-Krzesinski et al.'s (2011) seven\nresearch areas above (a) the context a VRC operates in trans-\nlates to the environment a CAS operates in. (b) and\n(c) Complexity theory can provide a lot of value to scholars\nstudying the network structure of VRCs, such as relation-\nships, hubs, edges, centralities, but also brings new perspec-\ntive to multiteam systems. (d) Concepts like emergence and\nself-organization can explain bottom-up formations, shared\nleadership practices, and working group structures, in VRCs.\n(e) Institutional support is another system that needs to be\ntaken into account in the CAS perspective. (f) Diversity and\ninteraction aspects of complex systems and its implications\nin VRCs have already been covered in this study. (g) Models\nand concepts in CAS can help researchers make sense of\nreal-life VRCs.\nIn conclusion, a VRC operates in a complex environ-\nment. Nonlinear relationships at different levels (individual,\norganizational, and even international) dominate the inter-\nactions among agents. These dynamics, and thus the poten-\ntial of a VRC, extend well beyond the publication record of\nresearchers. CAS theory provides a tool to integrate analy-\nses done at different levels. The importance of diversity and\ninteraction among team members, the role of leadership,\nand the resilience and adaptation of a VRC to both internal\nand external threats, could all be explored, explained, and\nstrengthened through the CAS Framework.\nNote\n1. Diversity here does not refer to racial or ethnic diversity but\nrather to various potential dimensions of professional diver-\nsity, such as disciplinary, expertise, skill, or sector diversity.\n"
