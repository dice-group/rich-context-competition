We discuss these policy implications.\nKeywords\nmaternal incarceration, parental incarceration, child wellbeing, heterogeneous treat-\nment effect models, public policy\nIn response to dramatic, highly concentrated increases in the American incarcera-\ntion rate throughout the last four decades (e.g., Bonczar, 2003; Sampson and Loeffler,\n2010; Western, 2006), scholars have developed an acute interest in the growing, yet re-\ncently stabilized, population of children who experience parental incarceration (Wildeman,\n2009). Most of this research has explored the intergenerational consequences of paternal\nincarceration (e.g., Foster and Hagan, 2007; Geller, Cooper, Garfinkel, Schwartz-Soicher,\nWildeman, 2010), which is unsurprising given that children have a much higher cumulative\nrisk of experiencing paternal, rather than maternal, incarceration (Wildeman, 2009).\nBut recent decades have witnessed striking relative increases in maternal incarcera-\ntion, especially among poor and minority children (Wildeman, 2009), and accordingly, a\nburgeoning literature has considered the intergenerational consequences of maternal incar-\nresearch in this area often has estimated the average effects of maternal incarceration on\nindicators of child wellbeing including internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors,\ntest scores, and delinquency (e.g., Cho, 2009; Dallaire, Zeman, and Thrash, 2014; Foster\n2014). Some of this research has found that maternal incarceration, on average, is detri-\nmental to children (Hagan and Foster, 2012b), whereas other research has suggested it is\ninconsequential (Wildeman and Turney, 2014) or dependent on the outcome (Foster and\ntion in the effects of maternal incarceration is strikingly apparent in the rich and textured\nDespite compelling indications of heterogeneous effects within qualitative research\nstudies, as well as inconsistency in the direction, magnitude, and statistical significance of\nfindings across quantitative research studies, no broadly representative quantitative research\nhas provided a systematic examination of the heterogeneous effects of maternal incarceration\non children's problem behaviors, test scores, or delinquency. Therefore, in this article, we\nuse data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWB), a birth cohort\n126 Criminology & Public Policy\nTurney and Wildeman\nof children born to mostly unmarried parents in urban areas, and a series of propensity\nscore matching techniques to consider whether the effects of maternal incarceration vary by\nthe social contexts that shape children's likelihoods of experiencing maternal incarceration.\nSpecifically, we consider heterogeneity in the effects of maternal incarceration, according\nto maternal propensities to experience incarceration, across four indicators of wellbeing in\nmiddle childhood: caregiver-reported internalizing problem behaviors, caregiver-reported\nexternalizing problem behaviors, Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Third Edition (PPVT-\nIII) scores, and child-reported early juvenile delinquency. Although these data have been\nused extensively to consider the effects of paternal incarceration on children, few researchers\nhave considered the effects of maternal incarceration (see Geller, Garfinkel, Cooper, and\nMincy, 2009; Wildeman and Turney, 2014), and no studies using these data have considered\nvariation in the relationship between maternal incarceration and children's wellbeing by\nthe propensity for experiencing maternal incarceration. This lack of research is a missed\nopportunity on the research side as these data include established measures of wellbeing in\nmiddle childhood contain a large number of children exposed to maternal incarceration,\nand include incarcerated mothers who are demographically similar to mothers incarcerated\nin jails, state prisons, and federal prisons (Wildeman and Turney, 2014). It also represents a\nmissed opportunity on the policy side, as identifying effect heterogeneity in the consequences\nof maternal incarceration also could provide guidance about which types of maternal\nincarceration policies might harm children, benefit children, or be inconsequential for\nchildren.\nThe results suggest that the effects of maternal incarceration on wellbeing in middle\nchildhood are strikingly heterogeneous. For three of the four measures considered (caregiver-\nreported internalizing problem behaviors, caregiver-reported externalizing problem behav-\niors, and child-reported early juvenile delinquency), maternal incarceration is damaging\nfor children of mothers unlikely to experience incarceration. The effects of maternal in-\ncarceration, for these children, are pronounced, corresponding to between two fifths and\nthree fifths of a standard deviation difference from their counterparts without incarcerated\nmothers. But maternal incarceration exerts no independent effect on children of mothers\nmore likely to experience incarceration. By providing the first broadly representative quan-\ntitative evidence documenting heterogeneous effects of maternal incarceration on children,\nthis study helps rectify divergent findings about the average effects of maternal incarcer-\nation (e.g., Foster and Hagan, 2013; Hagan and Foster, 2012b; Huebner and Gustafson,\n2007; Wildeman and Turney, 2014), advances our understanding about how the conse-\nquences of incarceration may vary across social contexts, and provides novel insights for\npolicy makers.\nUnderstanding Heterogeneity in the Effects of Maternal Incarceration\nThe inattention of prior quantitative research to systematically documenting the hetero-\ngeneous effects of maternal incarceration on child wellbeing is an unfortunate oversight\nResearch Article Maternal Incarceration and Child Wellbeing\nfor at least three reasons. First, qualitative research has suggested that the effects of mater-\nnal incarceration are not identical (or even similar) for all children. Second, quantitative\nresearch, which has relied on samples that are varied in the proportion of children who\nexperience maternal incarceration (as well as in the rigor of statistical methods employed\nand the extensiveness of controls included), has come to conflicting conclusions regarding\nthe average effects of maternal incarceration. Third, many critical of research on the inter-\ngenerational consequences of parental incarceration have maintained that negative effects\nof parental incarceration are, at best, implausible for the most destructive parents (e.g.,\nWe discuss these three points in the following discussion.\nHeterogeneity in Qualitative Research\nFirst, and most importantly, it is important to document systematically the heteroge-\nneous effects of maternal incarceration on children because qualitative research consistently\nhas suggested considerable variability in effects (Arditti, 2012a; Siegel, 2011; Turanovic\net al., 2012). For example, several in-depth qualitative examinations have provided evidence\nthat maternal incarceration--through some combination of parental absence, emotional\ntrauma, caregiver instability, or stigma--is harmful to children (Arditti, 2012a; Siegel, 2011;\nTuranovic et al., 2012). Jane Siegel's interviews with children of imprisoned mothers pro-\nvided two especially compelling examples of the psychological toll that maternal incarcera-\ntion can take on children:\nI miss her so much. I just want her to be home already. It's really bad `cause\nwhen things happen, I want to tell her about it and I really can't because she's\nnot here and I really want her to really be here. I wanted her to be here for my\nfifteenth birthday. I want her to be here when I graduate. I want her to be here\nfor my prom. I want her to be here for so many things, but she might not be\nhere and I hate that. I want her to be here so bad. I love my mother. She is a\nMost people's fathers be in since they was babies, for killing somebody or doing\nthis or selling drugs. So it's not a big deal. So when your mother be in prison\n. . . it's even worse, period, than a father. Because most of the time a father\ndon't never take part in the kid's life anyway. (Naja, in Siegel, 2011: 149).\nYet, and contradictory to evidence suggesting deleterious consequences of maternal\nincarceration, qualitative research has found that maternal incarceration is a constructive\nexperience for some children and, more broadly, for family functioning. This possibility was\nconvincingly present in two qualitative studies (Siegel, 2011; Turanovic et al., 2012). For\nexample, Turanovic and colleagues (2012) found that, on balance, maternal incarceration\nis a positive experience for more than one fourth of children's caregivers. Maybe the most\n128 Criminology & Public Policy\nTurney and Wildeman\npoignant example of the beneficial effects of maternal incarceration comes from Eddy, a\nfather of three:\nYou know what happens to a father when a mother goes to jail? In my case,\nit's the best thing that ever happened to me and my kids. Best thing that ever\nhappened for us if you ask me. She didn't like the split between us so she would\npop my tires, break my windows, so I went to the courts a couple of times\nand this time they just really put their foot down and she was sent to state,\nsentenced a year and a half. She cost me thousands of dollars, popping my tires\nand just chaos. We were hotel hopping. We didn't have a choice. I had to move\nthree times because of Erica coming to my house being loud. One apartment\ncomplex put me out because she was yelling outside of my door, and I had\na restraining order but they said it didn't matter, it was some kind of policed\napartment complex, any problems and you're out of there. (Turanovic et al.,\nIn addition to providing evidence of positive and negative effects, some qualitative\nresearch has indicated that maternal incarceration is simply inconsequential for children.\nMaternal incarceration could be inconsequential for several reasons. First, some mothers\nare entirely absent from children's lives prior to incarceration, and in these cases, absence\nvia incarceration likely has no direct effect (e.g., Turanovic et al., 2012: 935). Additionally,\nincarcerated mothers are an extremely disadvantaged group--they disproportionately report\ntrauma, substance abuse, housing instability, and mental illness--and it could be these\ndisadvantages, and not maternal incarceration itself, that explain any differences between\nthese children and their counterparts (e.g., Giordano, 2010). In other words, these children\nwould likely experience disadvantages regardless of maternal incarceration (e.g., Siegel,\n2011; Turanovic et al., 2012). Finally, it is possible that the positive and negative effects of\nmaternal incarceration roughly cancel each other out and, accordingly, lead to average null\nHeterogeneity in Quantitative Research\nA second reason to consider the heterogeneous effects of maternal incarceration on child\nwellbeing is that quantitative research, even when only considering the studies that have\nused broadly representative data, has documented incredibly disparate average effects.1\nConsider three examples that used large, population-based samples: Hagan and Foster's\n(2012b; also see Foster and Hagan, 2013) analysis of the National Longitudinal Study of\n1. However, some research has suggested that individual-level characteristics of the mother can moderate\nthe link between maternal incarceration and child wellbeing (e.g., Hanlon, Blatchley, et al., 2005; Hanlon,\nO'Grady, Bennett-Sears, and Callaman, 2005; Poehlmann, 2005; Poehlmann, Schlafer, Maes, and\nResearch Article Maternal Incarceration and Child Wellbeing\nAdolescent Health (Add Health), Huebner and Gustafson's (2007) analysis of children born\nto members of the National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1979 (NLSY79), and Wildeman\nand Turney's (2014) analysis of the FFCWB. Across these three studies, the proportion\nof children who experienced maternal incarceration--and, correspondingly, the level of\nselection into maternal incarceration--was dramatically different. Approximately 1% of\nchildren in the Add Health study experienced maternal incarceration any time between\nthe NLSY79 study experienced maternal incarceration between birth and 18\u00ad24 years of age\n(Huebner and Gustafson, 2007: 286), and approximately 9% of children in the FFCWB\nstudy experienced maternal incarceration between birth and 9 years of age (Wildeman and\nThe dramatic differences between the two studies that used the Add Health and\nthat used the FFCWB (Wildeman and Turney, 2014) could have resulted from differential\nselection into incarceration across the samples. The FFCWB study included a population-\nbased sample of children born to mostly unmarried (and, therefore, mostly disadvantaged)\nmothers around the turn of the millennium. Because of their disadvantage and because of\nthe relatively high incarceration rates, compared with rates in even slightly earlier historical\nperiods, maternal incarceration is a more normative experience among these children than\namong children in the other two samples. Incarcerated mothers in this study, compared with\nthose in the other two studies, are more similar to mothers who are not incarcerated. This\ndifferential selection could explain why two of the three studies found large and statistically\nsignificant negative average effects of maternal incarceration (Hagan and Foster, 2012b;\nHuebner and Gustafson, 2007) and one study found statistically nonsignificant average\neffects (Wildeman and Turney, 2014). Under significant heterogeneity by the propensity\nfor incarceration, which these studies did not consider, such marked variations in the\nprobability of experiencing maternal incarceration could easily lead to the divergent average\neffects across these studies (although, for research on racial and ethnic differences in the\neffects of maternal incarceration on caregiver-reported behavioral problems, see Wildeman\nand Turney, 2014). It could be that children drawn from samples in which maternal\nincarceration is highly unlikely experience deleterious consequences, and children drawn\nfrom samples where maternal incarceration is more common experience beneficial or null\nconsequences. Yet, because no broadly representative quantitative research has considered\nboth the average effects of maternal incarceration and the effects by the propensity for\nexperiencing maternal incarceration, it is impossible to explain these divergent findings.2\n2. Of course, variation across samples in the probability of experiencing maternal incarceration is not the\nonly potential explanation for divergent findings across studies. Other features--sampling strategies,\nmodeling strategies, control variables, ages of children, and outcomes--also could explain these\ndivergent findings.\n130 Criminology & Public Policy\nTurney and Wildeman\nCritiques of Research on Consequences of Incarceration\nA final--and different--reason why it is important to document the heterogeneous effects of\nmaternal incarceration relates to research on the consequences of incarceration more broadly,\nespecially as it relates to family life. Two ideas have been dominant among scholars most\nidea is that selection into incarceration--via earlier criminal justice contact, mental illness,\nor substance abuse--rather than incarceration itself drives the negative effects of parental\nincarceration on child wellbeing. The second, and related, idea is that some incarcerated\nparents engage in behaviors so damaging to family life that, accordingly, their absence may\nactually be beneficial for their children. The second concern is directly relevant to the\nmothers with a high probability of experiencing incarceration.\nA myopic focus on the average effects of maternal incarceration makes it, to a degree,\nimpossible for scholars--especially those who know that characteristics such as emotional\ninstability, severe substance abuse, or child neglect are detrimental to children--to find\nresearch that has shown negative effects of maternal incarceration credible (absent also having\nshown that maternal incarceration does not help--or at least does not harm--the children\nof mothers most likely to be incarcerated). Considering effect heterogeneity--by mothers'\npropensity for experiencing incarceration--thus has the potential to provide a \"reality check\"\non the prevailing literature considering the average effects of maternal incarceration. Several\nexaminations of the effects of paternal incarceration successfully considered variation in\neffects--although not in the propensity score matching framework--and they found that\nthe detrimental effects of paternal incarceration are muted when the father was nonresident\nprior to his incarceration (Geller et al., 2012) and virtually nonexistent when the father had\nengaged in domestic violence (Wildeman, 2010).\nCurrent Study\nIn this study, we use data from the FFCWB to examine how the effect of maternal incar-\nceration varies across mothers' propensities for experiencing incarceration. This propensity\nscore matching approach--which matches incarcerated mothers with mothers who are\nsimilar across a distribution of covariates except for their incarceration experience--allows\nus to consider an array of social contexts that shape children's lives prior to incarceration.\nThis approach also is especially valuable given the vast differences between incarcerated\nand not incarcerated mothers. We proceed under the ignorability assumption, which is the\nassumption that there are no unobserved confounders (Morgan and Harding, 2006), but\nour analyses also investigate the extent to which unobserved selection into incarceration\nexists and, hence, provide insight into the degree to which the results could violate this\nassumption and find statistically significant effects.\nOur examination of the relationship between maternal incarceration and child wellbe-\ning has at least three key strengths. First, we provide insight into the heterogeneous effects\nof maternal incarceration by using data and methods that allow us to adjust extensively for\nResearch Article Maternal Incarceration and Child Wellbeing\nselection into incarceration. In so doing, we contribute to research on the consequences\nof incarceration for families (e.g., Comfort, 2008; Turney, 2014b; Turney, Schnittker, and\nWildeman, 2012; Turney and Wildeman, 2013) and to research on heterogeneous treat-\nment effects (e.g., Brand and Xie, 2010). Second, by considering a range of outcomes in\nmiddle childhood that are linked to later life-course outcomes, we provide broad insight into\nhow maternal incarceration will affect children throughout their life course (Caspi, Bem,\nKaiser, 2004). Finally, by adding nuance to research on the consequences of imprisonment\nby looking for both statistically significant and nonsignificant effects, we contribute to a\nshift in this research program (e.g., Turney and Wildeman, 2013).\nMethod\nData\nWe use longitudinal data from the FFCWB, a birth cohort study of 4,898 children born\nperson interviews with both mothers and fathers occurred nearly immediately after the focal\nchild's birth. Parents were interviewed by telephone when their children were approximately\n1, 3, 5, and 9 years old, and at the latter three waves, some families also participated in an\nin-home interview. Baseline response rates were 86% for mothers and 78% for fathers. Of\nthose who participated in the baseline interview, 91%, 89%, 88%, and 76% of children\nhad at least one parent (and often both parents) participate in the 1-, 3-, 5-, and 9-year\ntelephone interviews, respectively. Approximately 69% of children had a caregiver (most\noften a mother) complete the 9-year in-home interview.\nIn constructing the analytic sample, we dropped the 1,507 observations without a\ncomplete 9-year in-home interview, as the dependent variables are measured during this\ninterview, and the additional 194 observations missing data on any of the four dependent\nvariables. The analytic sample, then, includes 3,197 observations.3 Because families with\na complete 9-year in-home interview are likely different from those without a complete\n9-year in-home interview, and this attrition might have implications for the results, we\ncompare the baseline sample and the analytic sample in Table A1. This table shows there are\nsome statistically significant, although small, observed differences between the baseline and\nanalytic samples. Mothers in the analytic sample, compared with mothers in the baseline\nsample, are more likely to be non-Hispanic Black, less likely to be foreign-born, and are\nmore likely to have younger mothers. In the analytic sample, mothers are more likely to be\nemployed and fathers are less likely to be employed. Fathers have higher impulsivity and\n3. This analytic sample includes two children who had a mother incarcerated at the 9-year survey. We\ninclude these children in the analytic sample because they have valid outcomes on the dependent\nvariables.\n132 Criminology & Public Policy\nTurney and Wildeman\nare more likely to have been previously incarcerated. We return to the implications of these\ndifferences in the discussion.\nWe do not impute the dependent variable but preserve missing covariate data with\nmultiple imputation (Allison, 2001). Prior to imputation, nearly all covariates are missing\nfewer than 10% of observations in the analytic sample. Exceptions include mother's par-\nenting stress, father's employment, and father's impulsivity, which are missing 17%, 26%,\nand 35% of observations, respectively.\nMeasures\nOutcome variables. We examine four indicators of child wellbeing: caregiver-reported\ninternalizing problem behaviors, caregiver-reported externalizing problem behaviors,\nPPVT-III scores, and child-reported early juvenile delinquency. To begin with, during the\nin-home 9-year interview, children's caregivers (mothers, in 93% of cases in the analytic\nsample) were asked to respond to a series of questions from the Child Behavior Checklist,\na commonly used measure of children's behavior (Achenbach, 1992). Caregivers were\nasked to report how often their children engaged in an array of behaviors (0 = not\ntrue, 1 = somewhat or sometimes true, and 2 = very true or often true). Internalizing\nproblem behaviors are measured by averaging responses to 32 questions ( = .88), and\nexternalizing problem behaviors are measured by averaging responses to 34 questions\n( = .91). Additionally, the PPVT-III, administered during the in-home 9-year interview,\nmeasures children's age-standardized verbal ability. Interviewers read words to children,\nwho had to identify a picture (among a set of four pictures) corresponding to the word\n(Dunn and Dunn, 1997). Finally, early juvenile delinquency is measured by children's\nself-reports about participating in 17 delinquent activities from the \"Things that You Have\nDone\" scale (Maumary-Gremaud, 2000; also see Elliott, Huizinga, and Menard, 1989).\nThe measure of delinquency is a sum of these items (Thornberry and Krohn, 2002).4 For\nconsistency across outcomes and ease of interpretation, we standardize all four dependent\nvariables (mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1).5\n4. Children were asked to report whether they had ever done the following 17 activities: (a) purposely\ndamaged or destroyed property that was not yours; (b) taken or stolen something that did not belong\nto you from another person or from a store; (c) taken some money at home that did not belong to you,\nlike from your mother's purse or from your parents' dresser; (d) cheated on a school test; (e) had a fist\nfight with another person; (f) hurt an animal on purpose; (g) gone into somebody's garden, backyard,\nhouse, or garage when you were not supposed to be there; (h) run away from home; (i) skipped school\nwithout an excuse; (j) secretly taken a sip of wine, beer, or liquor; (k) smoked marijuana, grass pot, or\nweed; (l) smoked a cigarette or used tobacco; (m) been suspended or expelled from school; (n) written\nthings or sprayed paint on walls or sidewalks or cars; (o) purposely set fire to a building, a car, or other\nproperty or tried to do so; (p) avoided paying for things such as movies, bus or subway rides, or food; or\n(q) thrown rocks or bottles at people or cars. Note that some of these activities might be prosocial and\nothers may lead to future deviant behavior (e.g., Foster, Nagin, Hagan, Angold, and Costello, 2010).\n5. The dependent variables have low (e.g., r for internalizing problem behaviors and PPVT-III scores =\n\u00ad0.08) to high correlations (e.g., r for internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors = 0.66).\nResearch Article Maternal Incarceration and Child Wellbeing\nExplanatory variable. A dummy variable indicates maternal incarceration between the 1-\nand 9-year interviews. Mothers are considered to experience incarceration if the interviews\nprovide direct or indirect evidence of incarceration. Direct evidence means that either the\nmother or father reports, at the 3-, 5-, or 9-year interviews, that the mother is currently\nincarcerated or has been incarcerated since the previous interview. Indirect evidence means\nthat information about maternal incarceration emerged at other points during the mother's,\nfather's, or caregiver's interviews (e.g., a report that the child stopped living with the\nmother because she was incarcerated), instead of in response to a direct question. Indirect\nevidence of maternal incarceration also is ascertained when the mother and father reports,\nat the 1-year survey, that the mother was never incarcerated and that the mother or father\nsubsequently reports she was ever incarcerated. Therefore, both direct and indirect evidence\nof incarceration indicates the mother was incarcerated in the child's lifetime. Approximately\n9% of mothers experienced incarceration.\nControl variables. We use mother, father, and child characteristics, including a host of\ncharacteristics associated with selection into incarceration, to generate propensity scores\nfor maternal incarceration. Importantly, to ensure temporal ordering between the control\nvariables and maternal incarceration, we measure all control variables at the baseline or 1-\nyear survey and, thus, prior to maternal incarceration. The one exception includes maternal\nimpulsivity, described below, which was only ascertained at the 5-year interview but is\nconsidered a stable, time-invariant characteristic (Gottfredson and Hirschi, 1990).\nDemographic characteristics include dummy variables that indicate mother's and\nfather's race (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, non-Hispanic other\nrace), mother's immigrant status, mother's age, and mother's family structure at 15 years\nof age (1 = lived with both biological parents and 0 = did not live with both biological\nparents). Socioeconomic factors include mother's and father's educational attainment (less\nthan high school, high-school diploma or GED, postsecondary education), a dummy\nvariable indicating the mother's household income is below the poverty line, a continuous\nmeasure of material hardship (e.g., received free food or meals in the past year, evicted\nfrom home or apartment for not paying the rent or mortgage), and dummy variables\nindicating the mother and father were employed in the last week. Family characteristics\ninclude a dummy variable indicating whether a grandmother lives in the child's household,\nthe parents' relationship status (married, cohabiting, nonresidential romantic relationship,\nor separated), a continuous variable indicating mother-reported relationship quality with\nthe father (1 = poor to 5 = excellent), and a continuous variable indicating the number of\nchildren in the mother's household. The analyses also control for mother's major depression\n(measured with the Composite International Diagnostic Instrument-Short Form; Kessler,\nAndrews, Mroczek, Ustun, and Wittchen, 1998) and mother's parenting stress (e.g., I feel\ntrapped by my responsibilities as a parent, taking care of my child is much more work\nthan pleasure;  = .60). Three child characteristics include gender, low birth weight, and\n134 Criminology & Public Policy\nTurney and Wildeman\na continuous measure of children's temperament, with higher scores indicating greater\nFinally, in generating the propensity score, we control for a host of mother's and\nfather's characteristics that could confound the relationship between maternal incarceration\nand child wellbeing. Dummy variables indicate the mother smoked during pregnancy\nand the mother used drugs or drank alcohol during pregnancy, both of which might be\nrelated to adverse birth outcomes. Dummy variables indicate the following: The mother\nhas a substance abuse problem (measured by an affirmative response to at least one of the\nfollowing at the 1-year interview: since the child was born, drinking or using drugs interfered\nwith day-to-day management; since the child was born, drinking or use drugs interfered\nwith personal relationships; and sought help or been treated for drug or alcohol problems\nsince the child was born); the father has a substance abuse problem (measured similarly as\nmother's substance abuse problem but includes both mother's and father's reports of the\nfather's substance abuse problem at the baseline and 1-year interviews); the father engaged\nin domestic violence; the mother was previously incarcerated (between the baseline and\n1-year interviews); and the father was previously incarcerated (at or prior to the 1-year\ninterview, including before baseline). Mother's and father's impulsivity were measured with\na continuous variable measured by questions such as \"I will often say whatever comes into\nmy head without thinking\" and \"often I don't think enough before I act\" ( = .86 for\nmothers and .84 for fathers; Dickman, 1990). Descriptive statistics are presented in Table 1.\nAnalytic Strategy\nThe first analytic stage estimates the average effects of maternal incarceration on\nchild wellbeing. Although prior research has considered the average effects of maternal\nincarceration using these data (e.g., Geller et al., 2009; Wildeman and Turney, 2014), we\npresent these estimates to (a) show that our approach (which is similar, but not identical, to\nprevious research) provides results consistent with previous research and (b) provide context\nfor interpreting the results demonstrating heterogeneous effects. To estimate the average\neffects, we first estimate a logistic regression model to generate a propensity score for each\nobservation in each of the 20 imputed data sets. The propensity score, which is essentially\na risk factor for experiencing the treatment, maternal incarceration, ranges from 0 to 1.\nWe use all control variables, which prior research has shown to be associated with either\nincarceration and/or child wellbeing, to generate the propensity score. Next, we ensure that\ncovariates in the treatment and control groups are statistically indistinguishable from one\nanother. The two groups differ only in their experience of the treatment. We then use kernel\nmatching, which matches all treatment observations to control observations by weight-\ning control observations by their distance from treatment cases (kernel = Epanechnikov;\nbandwidth = 0.06). Ordinary least-squares (OLS) models then estimate internalizing\nproblem behaviors, externalizing problem behaviors, PPVT-III scores, and early juvenile\nResearch Article Maternal Incarceration and Child Wellbeing\nT A B L E 1\nDescriptive Statistics of Variables Used in the Analysis\nVariable Mean (SD) Minimum Maximum\nDependent Variables\nIndependent Variable\nControl Variables\nMother race (b)\nMother and father a mixed-race couple (b) 0.144\nMother lived with both biological parents at age 15 (b) 0.411\nMother education (b)\nFather education (b)\nMother relationship with child's father (y1)\n(Continued)\n136 Criminology & Public Policy\nTurney and Wildeman\nT A B L E 1\nContinued\nVariable Mean (SD) Minimum Maximum\nMother smoked during pregnancy (b) 0.191\nMother used drugs or drank alcohol during pregnancy (b) 0.123\nNotes.

Observations in\nthe first stratum have the lowest likelihood of maternal incarceration, and those in the\nthird stratum have the highest likelihood of maternal incarceration. Importantly, within\neach stratum, we restrict the analyses to regions of common support and ensure that there\nare no statistically significant differences in the control variables between the treatment\nand control groups. For example, in stratum 1, the treatment and control groups have a\nsimilar distribution of covariates and vary only by maternal incarceration. Including all\nvariables used to generate the propensity score in the models estimating average effects\nwas not possible, as their inclusion precluded the within-stratum balance requirement of\nthis propensity score matching approach (see Table A2 for the means across treatment and\ncontrol groups of variables used in the heterogeneous treatment effect models).\nResearch Article Maternal Incarceration and Child Wellbeing\nWe then estimate multilevel models. Level 1 estimates the effects of maternal incarcer-\nation on child wellbeing in each stratum, and Level 2 estimates the trend in the variation of\neffects by propensity score stratum. Again, all outcomes are estimated with OLS regression\nmodels. Because these multilevel models cannot be estimated with multiply imputed data,\nthese models use only one imputed data set. The magnitude and statistical significance of\nthe point estimates, however, remain substantively similar in robustness checks that use\ndifferent single imputed data sets.\nAlthough propensity score matching is a strategic method for estimating the\neffects of maternal incarceration, because it approximates an experimental design and en-\nsures the treatment and control groups differ only in their experience of the treatment, this\nmethod only accounts for observed characteristics. We proceed under the assumption that\nno unobserved characteristics could render any observed effects of maternal incarceration\nstatistically nonsignificant (the ignorability assumption, as discussed previously), and it is\npossible that unobserved characteristics--such as criminal activity or child maltreatment--\nexist. Therefore, both the estimates of average and heterogeneous effects cannot rule out\nthe possibility that selection into incarceration rather than incarceration itself drives any\nobserved association (Morgan and Harding, 2006). We conduct sensitivity analyses to con-\nsider this possibility more fully and return to this point in the discussion. All analyses were\nconducted with Stata (StataCorp, College Station, TX) (also see Becker and Caliendo, 2007;\nResults\nEstimating the Average Effects of Maternal  \nTable 2 presents estimates of the effect of maternal incarceration on four measures of\nchild wellbeing: internalizing problem behaviors, externalizing problem behaviors, PPVT-\nIII scores, and early juvenile delinquency.

However, it is possible that the effects are heterogeneous, meaning that some\nchildren might suffer substantial harm and that others might considerably benefit from ma-\nternal incarceration. We next consider this possibility. We generate three propensity score\nstrata, each of which include mothers in the treatment group and mothers in the control\ngroup that have a similar distribution of covariates.\nTable 3 shows that mothers from the first stratum (those with the lowest propensity,\nor risk, for incarceration, with no more than a 5% risk) are more advantaged than mothers\nin the second stratum (those with a 5% to 10% risk of incarceration) and, especially, third\nstratum (those with a 10% to 30% risk of incarceration). For example, in stratum 1, just\nmore than one third (36%) of mothers were non-Hispanic Black, compared with 56%\nin stratum 2 and stratum 3. Additionally, compared with their counterparts, mothers in\nstratum 1 are likely to have postsecondary education (54% compared with 42% in stratum\n2 and 11% in stratum 3), are unlikely to have household incomes below the poverty line\n(27% compared with 36% in stratum 2 and 62% in stratum 3), are likely to be married to\nthe focal child's father (53% compared with 27% in stratum 2 and 10% in stratum 3), and\nare unlikely to report depression (6% compared with 13% in stratum 2 and 28% in stratum\n3).

Recall that higher values indicate less favorable outcomes for inter-\nnalizing problem behaviors, externalizing problem behaviors, and early juvenile delinquency\nand more favorable behaviors for PPVT scores. Turning first to estimates of internalizing\nproblem behaviors, the Level 1 coefficients show that the effect of maternal incarceration\nvaries across the three strata. Maternal incarceration is associated with one half of a standard\ndeviation increase in internalizing problem behaviors in stratum 1 (p < .01), a small and\nstatistically nonsignificant increase in internalizing problem behaviors in stratum 2, and a\nsmall and statistically nonsignificant decrease in internalizing problem behaviors in stratum\n3. The Level 2 slope demonstrates that, for each unit change in stratum, there is a 0.235\nstandard deviation decrease in the effect of maternal incarceration (p < .05). Figure 1a\nprovides a graphical depiction.\nThe results are nearly identical for externalizing problem behaviors and early juvenile\ndelinquency. The Level 1 coefficients show that the effects of maternal incarceration are\nconcentrated among individuals only in stratum 1 (for externalizing problem behaviors)\nand in both strata 1 and 2 (for early juvenile delinquency). The Level 2 coefficient shows\nthat these between-strata differences are statistically significant. For example, maternal\nResearch Article Maternal Incarceration and Child Wellbeing\nF I G U R E 1\nHeterogeneous Treatment Effects of Maternal Incarceration on Children's\nWellbeing (a) Internalizing Problem Behaviors (b) Externalizing Problem\nBehaviors (c) Early Juvenile Delinquency\n142 Criminology & Public Policy\nTurney and Wildeman\nincarceration is associated with about a three fifths of a standard deviation increase in exter-\nnalizing problem behaviors in stratum 1 (p < .01), a small and statistically nonsignificant\nincrease in externalizing problems behaviors in stratum 2, and a small and statistically\nnonsignificant decrease in problem behaviors in stratum 3.

Figures 1b and 1c provide graphical depictions.\nThe estimates for PPVT-III scores follow a similar pattern, with the largest coefficient\nfor children of mothers least likely to be incarcerated and the smallest coefficient for\nchildren of mothers most likely to be incarcerated. But the between-stratum differences are\nnot statistically significant, and therefore, we do not provide a graphical depiction of this\nrelationship. See Appendix A for additional analyses that interrogate the robustness of these\nfindings.\nDiscussion\nResults Summary\nChildren of incarcerated mothers represent a growing and vulnerable population, and ac-\ncordingly, a burgeoning literature has considered how maternal incarceration--above and\nbeyond other disadvantages that are correlated with maternal incarceration--affects the\nwellbeing of children. But quantitative research, at least broadly representative quantitative\nresearch, has provided evidence of both deleterious (e.g., Hagan and Foster, 2012b; Hueb-\nner and Gustafson, 2007) and null (e.g., Wildeman and Turney, 2014) average effects, and\nqualitative research has documented that maternal incarceration may be deleterious, ben-\net al., 2012). Therefore, in this article, we attempt to reconcile these findings by considering\nthe heterogeneous effects of maternal incarceration on children.\nWe use data from the FFCWB--a data source that includes incarcerated mothers\ndemographically similar to mothers incarcerated in jails, state prisons, and federal prisons\n(Wildeman and Turney, 2014)--and a series of propensity score matching models to esti-\nmate the effects of maternal incarceration on wellbeing among 9-year-old children, finding\nsignificant evidence of effect heterogeneity; the children least likely to experience this event\nsuffer deleterious consequences, and the children most likely to experience this event suffer\nno statistically significant responses. One explanation for the statistically nonsignificant\nfindings among children most likely to experience maternal incarceration, a disadvantaged\ngroup of children prior to maternal incarceration, could be that children stop accumulating\nadverse consequences once they reach a certain point of saturation (Hannon, 2003). A\nrelated explanation could be that maternal incarceration offers relief from other stressors\nsuch as domestic violence or economic deprivation (Wheaton, 1990). A final possibility is\nthat women who are most likely to experience incarceration are probably also most likely\nto be lost to attrition. It is possible that the analytic sample excludes some mothers with a\nResearch Article Maternal Incarceration and Child Wellbeing\nhigh propensity for experiencing incarceration and, therefore, makes it difficult to find any\nstatistically significant (positive) effects.\nThe evidence of heterogeneous effects complements both qualitative and quantitative\nresearch on maternal incarceration and, more broadly, contributes theoretically to research\non the consequences of incarceration. Consistent with the nuanced qualitative research\n2012), we show that maternal incarceration can harm some children and have no discernible\neffect on others. Importantly, we find no statistically significant positive effects of maternal\nincarceration that often have been described in the qualitative literature (e.g., Turanovic\net al., 2012). This could be because these positive effects are not driven by characteristics\nassociated with selection into incarceration. Alternatively, it could be that even the mothers\nwith the highest propensities for incarceration in our sample (those with a 10% to 30%\nrisk) were still not above a threshold that would produce consistently beneficial effects of\nincarceration. Although the coefficients for mothers with the highest propensities are not\nstatistically significant, in the case of internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors,\nthe direction of the coefficients suggests positive effects, and it is likely that some positive\neffects are counterbalanced by negative effects (Turney, 2014a; for research on paternal\nabsence more generally, see Jaffee, Moffitt, Caspi, and Taylor, 2003). Indeed, as there are\nlikely individual instances where maternal incarceration improves child wellbeing, future\nresearch should continue to test for positive effects of maternal incarceration and should\nconsider that these positive effects could be driven by something other than the mother's\npropensity for incarceration. More generally, given that considering only the average effects\nof maternal incarceration masks considerable heterogeneity, both research and public policy\nsurrounding the consequences of maternal incarceration should carefully consider treatment\nheterogeneity.\nRelatedly, the results regarding effect heterogeneity bring together the three most rig-\norous, broadly representative analyses of the effects of maternal incarceration on children.\nFor instance, in Hagan and Foster's (2012b) analysis of the Add Health data and Huebner\nand Gustafson's (2007) analysis of the NLSY79 data, approximately 1% and 2% of mothers\nwere incarcerated, respectively. These analyses documented large, statistically significant\nnegative effects of maternal incarceration, which is precisely in line with our findings for\nchildren of mothers least likely to be incarcerated (e.g., those with a propensity below 5%).\nAdditionally, in Wildeman and Turney's (2014) analysis of the FFCWB data, where ap-\nproximately 9% of mothers were incarcerated, they found statistically nonsignificant effects\nfor 19 of the 21 outcomes considered. This result is consistent with what we find here\nfor children of mothers with relatively high propensities for experiencing incarceration.\nFurthermore, although Wildeman and Turney (2014) did not consider variation by the\npropensity for experiencing maternal incarceration, they did consider race and ethnic dif-\nferences in the relationship between maternal incarceration and caregiver-reported problem\nbehaviors, finding evidence that maternal incarceration decreases problem behaviors among\n144 Criminology & Public Policy\nTurney and Wildeman\nWhite children. Thus, seemingly divergent findings across prior research could be driven\nby the populations they represent, not by differences in statistical methods, children's ages,\nor outcomes.\nMore generally, these findings provide confidence that the effects--positive, negative, or\nnull--of maternal incarceration across studies reflect the social reality of children's lives. This\nobservation is especially true in conjunction with studies that found null effects of maternal\nincarceration in disadvantaged samples (e.g., Wildeman and Turney, 2014), studies that\nfound that theoretically relevant moderators condition the effects of parental incarceration\nand studies that suggested heterogeneity in the effects of incarceration on family life more\nLimitations\nAlthough the analyses do reconcile much prior research on this topic and contribute the-\noretically to broader research on the effects of incarceration, limitations exist. Importantly,\nnot all families who participated in the baseline sample remained in the study at the 9-year\nsurvey, which was when the outcome variables were measured. Although descriptive analyses\nshow small observed differences between the baseline and analytic samples, it is possible\nthat there are additional unobserved differences between those who did and did not remain\nin the study. We suspect that those who do not remain in the study are more disadvantaged\nin their unobservable characteristics and, therefore, are more likely to be families with a\nhigh propensity for experiencing maternal incarceration. If we could retain these families,\nit is possible that maternal incarceration would have a protective effect on children with a\nhigh propensity for experiencing maternal incarceration.\nAdditionally, the propensity score matching models proceed under the ignorability\nassumption, which is the assumption that unobserved characteristics are not excluded when\nbalancing across treatment and control groups (Morgan and Harding, 2006). Unmeasured\ncharacteristics--such as heritability or mothers' criminal history--could confound our\nresults. The analyses, however, provide evidence that this is not a major concern. For one,\nthe models estimating average effects document null effects. Also, the models estimating\nheterogeneous effects show that the negative statistically significant effects are concentrated\namong children of the least disadvantaged mothers. Indeed, if unobserved heterogeneity\nproduced biased results, then we would likely find statistically significant negative effects\namong children of the most disadvantaged mothers. The Rosenbaum bounds also provide\nassurance that our results--the negative effects of maternal incarceration on children of the\nleast disadvantaged mothers--are likely not unduly biased by omitted variables driving both\nmaternal incarceration and poor child outcomes. However, absent a randomized control\ntrial, we cannot undoubtedly rule out unmeasured heterogeneity, and therefore, our policy\nsuggestions are contingent on being replicated with experimental data. Unlike research on\nthe effects of paternal incarceration, where it is difficult to link disadvantaged men to their\nResearch Article Maternal Incarceration and Child Wellbeing\nchildren through administrative records, linking disadvantaged mothers to their children is\nmore straightforward and future research should undertake these analyses.\nOther limitations, common among studies that examine the effects of maternal in-\ncarceration, exist. For one, the measure of maternal incarceration is crude. We cannot\ndifferentiate children of mothers who experienced short incarceration stays from those who\nexperienced lengthy ones. We also cannot distinguish between prison or jail incarceration,\nhave no data about the distance between the incarcerated mother and her child, and lack\ninformation on earlier stages of criminal justice contact (e.g., arrest) or family circumstances\nimmediately prior to maternal incarceration, all of which could influence child wellbeing\n(Dallaire et al., 2014; Sampson, 2014). Also, too few mothers were incarcerated at each\nwave to consider how the timing or chronicity of maternal incarceration may affect child\nwellbeing. Future studies of child wellbeing, especially those with nationally representative\nand population-based samples, should collect information about these details to facilitate\na more nuanced understanding of the heterogeneous effects of maternal incarceration and\nthe mechanisms underlying these effects.\nImplications for Public Policy and Conclusions\nThe implications of these results for public policy are difficult to disentangle, especially\nbecause the analytic strategy lacks a true experimental design, and we thus hope this article\nlaunches both additional research on the effects of maternal incarceration on children and\na conversation about how public policy could minimize the consequences of maternal\nincarceration for children.\nFirst, it is important to discuss the public policy implications of our null findings.\nWe find that, for children of mothers more likely to experience incarceration (those in\nstratum 2 and stratum 3), maternal incarceration is not independently associated with\ndeleterious outcomes in children, which is in line with findings from other research that has\nconsidered the average effects of incarceration with these data (Wildeman and Turney, 2014).\nImportantly, children of mothers with a high propensity for experiencing incarceration are\nan extremely disadvantaged group, and it is likely that the relative influence of these\nother disadvantages--compared with maternal incarceration--drive unfavorable outcomes\nfor these children. Therefore, although reducing maternal incarceration could do little to\nbenefit these children, public policy might instead focus on issues that disproportionately\naffect children of mothers with a high likelihood of incarceration, such as alleviating poverty\nor increasing access to substance abuse treatment. Furthermore, as it is possible that these\nchildren simply learn how to cope with maternal incarceration, public policy efforts could\nbe directed toward social service programs that help children and families adapt to maternal\nincarceration, perhaps by striving to increase cooperation and support among children's\ncaregivers, additional family members, and teachers.\nNext, we focus our public policy discussion on the group of children who, in our\nanalyses, suffer the most substantial consequences of maternal incarceration: children of\n146 Criminology & Public Policy\nTurney and Wildeman\nmothers who are unlikely to experience incarceration (those with a 0% to 5% risk). For\nchildren of mothers unlikely to experience incarceration, the negative consequences of\nmaternal incarceration could be driven by at least three factors, all of which may be\noperating simultaneously and all of which potentially call for different policy interventions:\n(a) jail incarceration as opposed to prison incarceration, (b) incarceration for a crime that\ndid minimal--or no--harm to their children, and (c) inadequate family supports for coping\nwith maternal incarceration. We consider each of these points in the following paragraphs.\nFor one, it is possible that the negative effects of maternal incarceration among children\nof mothers unlikely to experience incarceration are driven by the conditions of confinement\n(specifically, jail incarceration compared with prison incarceration). It is possible that because\nmothers with a low propensity for incarceration are more likely than their counterparts with\na higher propensity for incarceration to be experiencing incarceration for the first time, they\nmay be more likely to be incarcerated in jails than prisons. Because jails are usually located\ncloser to pre-incarceration residences than prisons, they facilitate easier visitation that could\nbe traumatic for either the mother or the child. Relatedly, jail stays are generally shorter\nthan prison stays, which means that children of mothers incarcerated in jail experience more\nfamily instability than children of mothers incarcerated in prison. Unfortunately, these data,\nlike most other data on maternal incarceration, do not allow us to differentiate between\njail and prison incarceration (or other types of incarceration experiences, as discussed at\nlength previously). This, of course, makes it difficult to know what is driving the effects,\nand calls both for heavier reliance on qualitative research and for better information on\nthe conditions of confinement. We do not have information about the conditions of\nconfinement experienced by mothers with a low propensity for incarceration (whose children\nrespond poorly to their incarceration) or how those conditions of confinement differ from\nthose of mothers with a higher propensity for incarceration (whose children show no effects).\nAs we lack information on the conditions of confinement, this public policy conversation\nwill be best had after research with more information on these features of incarceration has\nbeen conducted.\nA second possibility is that mothers with a low propensity to experience incarceration\nwere disproportionately committing crimes that did little harm to their children prior to\ntheir incarceration--and, by extension, could have had relatively few broader consequences\nfor society prior to their incarceration. If this assumption is true, then this--in conjunction\nwith our findings about the deleterious effects on children of these mothers--leads to public\npolicy suggestions that are relatively easy to follow: Rely on criminal justice interventions\nother than incarceration for low-level offenses, with an emphasis on decriminalizing pos-\nsession of marijuana and other petty offenses (especially minor public order offenses). Yet\nthe difficulty is that the data do not allow us to know whether the mothers with a low\npropensity for incarceration are those incarcerated for the least serious crimes, although this\nassumption is plausible.\nResearch Article Maternal Incarceration and Child Wellbeing\nA third possibility is that families, like inmates (see the review in Wildeman, Turney, and\nSchnittker, 2014), learn how to cope with incarceration. In this regard, it might be the case\nthat mothers who have previously experienced incarceration or families who have previously\nexperienced paternal incarceration have a better strategy in place for dealing with maternal\nincarceration--possibly because the parent is periodically absent for other reasons--than do\nfamilies in which incarceration comes as more of a shock. This possibility, it seems to us, is\neminently reasonable, and it calls for a different public policy intervention. Specifically, this\npossibility suggests that family interventions--whether through the provision of childcare\nor some other direct intervention--that focus on families experiencing incarceration for the\nfirst time might especially help the children experiencing that event. Unfortunately, because\nwe do not know the direct mechanisms through which these effects might operate--through\nsocial psychological trauma, a reduction in childcare, or some other avenue--and there are\nvery few randomized control trials evaluating such interventions, it is difficult to know what\npolicy shift might be successful.\nIn closing, although we cannot say anything definitive regarding public policy, the\ndata and corresponding discussion provide some insights as to how policies might respond\nto children of incarcerated mothers, especially children unlikely to experience maternal\nincarceration. These analyses, which provide the first broadly representative quantitative\nevidence about heterogeneity in the relation between maternal incarceration and child\nwellbeing, makethreeessentialcontributions to theresearchontheconsequences ofmaternal\nincarceration for children. First, we show that the effect heterogeneity strongly motivated\net al., 2012) and across quantitative research (e.g., Foster and Hagan, 2013; Wildeman\nand Turney, 2014) also can be detected in population-based quantitative data by testing for\nheterogeneous treatment effects (e.g., effects by the propensity for experiencing maternal\nincarceration). Second, they bring together the seemingly disparate findings from previous\nquantitative research, as we find substantial detrimental effects on children of mothers\nvery unlikely to be incarcerated, as has previous research (e.g., Hagan and Foster, 2012b;\nHuebner and Gustafson, 2007), and no evidence of detrimental effects on children of\nmothers most likely to be incarcerated, as has previous research (Wildeman and Turney,\n2014). Finally, and most importantly, our analyses provide an important \"reality check\"\nfor those critical of the great emphasis placed on the effects of mass incarceration, relative\nto the effects of criminality and other forms of disadvantage, on families and children\nthe effects of maternal incarceration shift from harmful to nonexistent, we show that\nthe deleterious consequences of maternal incarceration for children are limited to those\nunlikely to experience that event. In this regard, to construct the most accurate social ledger\nof incarceration possible and to broaden understanding about the implications of mass\nimprisonment for inequality (Sampson, 2011), future research must seriously consider the\nheterogeneous effects of paternal incarceration on children.\n148 Criminology & Public Policy\nTurney and Wildeman\nReferences\nBurlington: Department of Psychiatry, University of Vermont.\nAllison, Paul D. 2001.

Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects\nAppendix A\nRobustness Checks\nIt is possible that this striking pattern of findings results from (a) the measurement of\nmaternal incarceration or (b) the reliance on caregiver-reported problem behaviors. We\ninvestigate these two possibilities in a series of robustness checks.\nFirst, we replace the measure of maternal incarceration with a more conservative\nmeasure of incarceration. In this conservative measure, we code incarceration affirmatively\nif there is direct or indirect evidence of incarceration (and not if mothers were reported\nto be \"never incarcerated\" at the 1-year interview and then reported to have been \"ever\nincarcerated\" at a subsequent interview with no additional evidence of incarceration). This\nalternative specification--which, because of the smaller number of mothers considered\nincarcerated (N = 153), necessitates examining differences across only two strata--produces\nsimilar findings. These results show that, for children of mothers with a low propensity\nfor incarceration (those in stratum 1), maternal incarceration is associated with large and\nstatistically significant increases in problem behaviors (b = 1.106, p < .001 for internalizing\np < .01 for early juvenile delinquency), but there is no effect for children of mothers with\na high propensity for incarceration (those in stratum 2). The Level 2 coefficients show\nthat the between-stratum differences are statistically significant (p < .001 for internalizing\nproblem behaviors, p < .001 for externalizing problem behaviors, and p < .01 for early\njuvenile delinquency).\nIn the second set of robustness checks, we estimate both teacher and child reports of\nproblem behaviors at the 9-year interview. Teacher-reported problem behaviors are mea-\nsured by responses to the internalizing and externalizing scales of the Social Skills Rating\nSystem (Gresham and Elliott, 2007). Child-reported internalizing and externalizing prob-\nlem behaviors are measured by responses to the Self-Description Questionnaire (Marsh,\n1990). Because not all teachers and children were interviewed, these analyses necessitate\nrelying on fewer observations (N = 2,004 for teacher-reported behaviors and N = 3,008\nfor child-reported behaviors). The patterns of results are consistent with those estimat-\ning caregiver-reported problem behaviors. Children in stratum 1 experienced increases in\n.05) problem behaviors as a result of maternal incarceration. The between-stratum differ-\nences, shown by the Level 2 coefficients, are statistically significant in estimates of teacher-\nreported internalizing problem behaviors (p < .01) but not in estimates of teacher-reported\nResearch Article Maternal Incarceration and Child Wellbeing\nT A B L E A 1\nDescriptive Statistics of Variables Used in Analyses\nVariable Baseline Sample Analytic Sample\nMean (SD) Mean (SD)\nMother Race (b)\nMother Education (b)\nFather Education (b)\nMother Relationship with Child's Father (y1)\nContinued\n154 Criminology & Public Policy\nTurney and Wildeman\nT A B L E A 1\nContinued\nVariable Baseline Sample Analytic Sample\nMean (SD) Mean (SD)\nNotes.

Additionally, children in stratum 1 experience increases\nproblem behaviors, and the between-stratum differences are statistically significant (p <\n.05 for both child-reported internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors). The results\nare consistent when restricting the sample to children with mother-reported outcomes.\nResearch Article Maternal Incarceration and Child Wellbeing\nTherefore, the similarities of caregiver-reported findings to those of teacher- and child-\nreported findings suggest the data are both valid and reliable.\nSensitivity Analyses. The preceding analyses suggest that the negative consequences of\nmaternal incarceration are concentrated among children unlikely to experience maternal\nincarceration. It is still possible that these effects result from social selection forces.\nTo investigate this possibility, we present results from Rosenbaum bounds sensitivity\nanalyses, which evaluate how sensitive the propensity score results are to unobserved\ncharacteristics. These unobserved characteristics can be correlated with selection into\nincarceration. We restrict these Rosenbaum bounds to those observations where we\nfind significant effects, those in stratum 1 (n = 814). These findings show that\nany unobserved characteristics not included in the propensity score would have to\nincrease the odds of being incarcerated by 70% ( = 1.7) for internalizing problem\n( = 2.5) for early juvenile delinquency. To contextualize just how substantial a missing\nsource of unobserved heterogeneity would have to be to render our results statistically\nnonsignificant, consider the results from the logistic regression model estimating the\npropensity score (not presented). Those results show that exposure to domestic violence\nis associated with only a 60% increase in the odds of incarceration. Similarly, maternal\nsubstance use during pregnancy and paternal incarceration, respectively, are associated with\na 110% and 30% increase in the odds of incarceration. Thus, unobserved selection forces\nwould need to be substantial to render these results statistically nonsignificant.\n  is an assistant professor of sociology at the University of California--Irvine.\nHer research investigates the complex, dynamic role of families in creating and exacerbating\nsocial inequalities. Specifically, she examines the collateral consequences of incarceration\nfor family life, the effects of depression on individuals and children, and the causes and\nconsequences of childhood health inequalities. These substantive interests are accompanied\nwith a methodological interest in causal inference.\n  is an associate professor in the Department of Policy Analysis and\nManagement at Cornell University and a visiting fellow at the Bureau of Justice Statistics.\nHis research considers (a) the consequences of mass imprisonment for inequality, with\nemphasis on families, health, and children; and (b) child maltreatment and the foster care\nsystem.
