Individual factors associ-\nated with later sexual debut included adolescents' feel-\nings about importance of religion, making a pledge of vir-\nginity, perceived likelihood of early death, number of\nhours worked per week, perceived physical maturity com-\npared with peers, and grade point average (GPA).\nWave III of Add Health provides an opportunity to de-\ntermine whether factors that influence age of sexual de-\nbut also influence longitudinal trajectories of risk for\nSTIs--using biological tests. In this study, we test the hy-\npothesis that family, school, and individual factors as-\nsociated with increased duration of virginity during ado-\nlescence at wave I16 longitudinally decrease risk of\ninfection with C trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, or\nTrichomonas vaginalis at wave III.\nMETHODS\nAdd Health is a prospective cohort study following up almost\nschool-based sample of middle and high school students in\nthe United States. Wave I interviews were conducted in 1995.\ninterviews of original participants (N=14 322) and testing for\nC trachomatis and N gonorrhoeae by ligase chain reaction and\nT vaginalis by polymerase chain reaction. The original sam-\npling design, and all Add Health procedures, have been de-\nwhether the wave I variables associated with age of sexual de-\nbut16 predict STI status at wave III. The University of North\nCarolina at Chapel Hill Institutional Review Board approved\nall study procedures.\nMEASURES\nOutcome Variable\nThe outcome variable was a positive test result for C trachoma-\ntis, N gonorrhoeae, or T vaginalis on wave III urine specimens.\nIndependent Variables\n22, 23, or 24 years and older. All participants who reported that\nthey were of Hispanic or Latino origin were coded as Latino.\nAll other participants were coded as white, African American\nor black, Native American, or Asian American. Family struc-\nture during adolescence was measured by self-report at wave\nI, and coded as living in a 2-parent home (biological or non-\nbiological) or not. Highest level of maternal education was mea-\nsured by the mother's report if she was interviewed at wave I\nor by the adolescent's report at wave I, and coded as less than\nhigh school, high school graduate, or college or beyond.\nWave I Family Variables. Previously described measures of fam-\nily connectedness (Cronbach =.88), perceived parental dis-\napproval of adolescent sex (Cronbach =.90), and perceived\nparental disapproval of contraception (Cronbach =.91) were\ncreated from items scored on Likert-type scales.16,22 Family sui-\ncide attempts and/or completions were measured by the fol-\nlowing question: \"Have any family members tried to kill them-\nselves or succeeded in killing themselves over the past 12\nmonths?\"\nWave I School Variables. A previously described measure for\nfeelings of being connected to school was created using an 8-item\ndance for the participants' school and school type (coded as\nparochial or not) were obtained from wave I school adminis-\ntrator questionnaires.\nWave I Individual Variables. The importance of religion was mea-\nsured by the following questions: How important is religion to\nyou? (There were 4 response categories, ranging from very to not\nat all.) How often do you pray? (There were 5 response catego-\nries, ranging from at least once a day to never.) What is your re-\nligion? Responses to the first 2 items were recoded from 0 to 1 so\nthat lower values represented lower importance of religion, and\nthe mean of the 2 items was calculated as an index of religious\nimportance. Respondents who reported not having a religious af-\nfiliation and who did not answer these questions were coded as\n0. Respondents who did report a religious affiliation had to an-\nswer at least 1 of the first 2 questions to receive a score. The in-\ndex was then standardized to have a mean of 0 and an SD of 1.\nRespondents who reported feelings of attraction toward a per-\nson of the same sex or a romantic relationship with a person\nof the same sex were coded as having same-sex attractions or\nrelationships. The perceived risk of an early death was mea-\nsured by asking participants to indicate the chance that they\nwill live until the age of 35 years. The number of hours en-\ngaged in paid work in a typical nonsummer week was coded\nas at least 20 per week or less. Self-report of physical appear-\nance was used to measure whether participants believed they\nlooked older or younger than most others their age. Grade point\naverage was calculated from self-report of grades in the most\nrecent grading period in English/language arts, mathematics,\nhistory/social studies, and science. Virginity pledge was mea-\nsured by the following item: Have you taken a public or writ-\nten pledge to remain a virgin until marriage?\nANALYSES\nDescriptive frequencies were derived from unweighted data. All\nother analyses used data weighted to reflect a nationally repre-\nsentative sample using survey estimation commands in com-\nputer software (Stata)23 that account for the stratification, clus-\ntering,andunequalprobabilitiesofselectioninthestudydesign.20\nWe examined bivariate relationships between sociodemo-\ngraphic characteristics, wave I independent variables (family,\nschool, and individual), and having a positive STI test result at\nwave III. We conducted multivariate analyses to determine the\nability of family, school, and individual variables to predict STI\nstatus, while controlling for sex, age, race/ethnicity, family struc-\nture, and level of maternal education. Because many factors in-\nfluencing sexual behaviors and risk of STIs may differ by sex,\nwe assessed separate multivariate models for female and male\nadolescents.\nIn bivariate analyses, the range of each scaled variable was\ndivided into thirds. In multivariate regression analyses, these\nvariables and age, mean school attendance, and GPA were mod-\neled as continuous variables after confirmation that the as-\nsumption of linearity was met.

The 2 most strongly correlated variables\nwere perceived parental disapproval of sex and contracep-\ntion (=0.57 in the full model). All other correlations were\nbelow 0.40. Results did not change substantively when per-\nceived parental disapproval of contraception was excluded\nfrom final models.\nRESULTS\nOf the 18 924 Add Health participants in the nationally\nwere located and agreed to participate in wave III. Of these\nmen and 226 (1.6%) were unable to provide a specimen\nat the interview. Furthermore, 421 (2.9%) of the speci-\nmens could not be processed due to shipping or labora-\ntory problems and 951 (6.6%) did not have results for\nall 3 STI tests.21 In sum, test results were available for\nC trachomatis, N gonorrhoeae, and T vaginalis for 11 594\n(81.0%) of the wave III participants.\nIncluding participants who did and did not undergo\nurine testing, just more than half (52.8%) of the study\nsamplewasfemale).Mostparticipants(54.2%)werewhite,\nwith substantial representation of African Americans\nNative Americans (1.0%) (percentages do not total 100\nbecause of rounding). Participants' mean age was 22.0\nyears (SD, 1.8 years).\nwave III respondents had a positive test result for C tra-\nchomatis, N gonorrhoeae, or T vaginalis.\nThe prevalence of a positive test result for C tracho-\nmatis, N gonorrhoeae, or T vaginalis was slightly higher\namong young adult females than males later (Table 1).\nThe prevalence was highest among African Americans and\nNative Americans, intermediate among Latinos, and low-\nest among Asian/Pacific Islanders and whites. The preva-\nlence was higher among young adults with mothers who\ndid not graduate from high school and those with moth-\ners who had only completed high school when com-\npared with those with mothers who had some college edu-\ncation or a college degree. Young adults who lived in a\n2-parent home during adolescence had a lower preva-\nlence of positive test results than those who did not live\nin 2-parent homes. The prevalence of positive test re-\nsults did not significantly vary by age.\nIn bivariate analyses, adolescents' perceptions of their par-\nents' approval of sex predicted their likelihood of hav-\ning STIs 6 years later (Table 2). Of the participants who\nperceived that their parents strongly disapproved of sex\nduring adolescence, only 5.5% later tested positive com-\nTable 1.

This study focuses on determining whether modifi-\nable family, school, and individual factors associated with\nincreased duration of virginity during adolescence also\nprotect against having STIs 6 years later.\nAdolescents who perceive that their parents more\nstrongly disapprove of their having sexual intercourse as\nan adolescent are less likely to be infected with C tra-\nchomatis, N gonorrhoeae, or T vaginalis 6 years later. To\nour knowledge, this is the first report of a longitudinal\nlink between perceptions of parental opinions about sex\nduring adolescence and biologically measured STIs. This\nfinding is consistent with previous research showing that\nthe more disapproving adolescents perceive their moth-\ners to be toward their engagement in sexual inter-\ncourse, the less likely adolescents are to become preg-\nnant24 and to self-report STI diagnoses.25\nFrom a practical perspective, if parents who disap-\nprove of their adolescent children engaging in sexual in-\ntercourse convey this attitude effectively, then the long-\nterm risk of STIs may be reduced. Unfortunately, effective\nconveyance of parental attitudes about sexual inter-\ncourse seems to be challenging. Adolescents often have\ninaccurate perceptions of their parents' attitudes about\ntheir engaging in sexual intercourse, and the tendency\nis for adolescents to underestimate parental disap-\nparent and child reports of whether they have discussed\nsexual topics is often low, and many parents underesti-\nmate their adolescent children's engagement in sexual ac-\ntivity.26,28,29 Taken together, this suggests a need to iden-\ntify strategies to increase the congruence between\nadolescents' perceptions of parental attitudes about sexual\nintercourse during adolescence and actual parental atti-\ntudes. Strategies will need to take into account the com-\nplex process of conveying parental attitudes to chil-\nTable 2.

This finding is consistent with\nprevious research showing that adolescents with higher\ngrades are less likely to participate in high-risk behav-\niors across many domains,16 and that adolescents with\nhigher intelligence are less likely to engage in risk-\nassociated sexual behaviors.30 We cannot exclude bidi-\nrectional relationships between academic achievement\nand long-term risk of STIs. Others31 have reported bidi-\nrectional influences between academic achievement and\nage of sexual debut, with variation in these relation-\nships among adolescent boys and girls.\nOur results show that the longitudinal risk of STIs is\ninfluenced by perceptions of parental disapproval of sex\nfor adolescent girls, but not adolescent boys. The link be-\ntween parental disapproval of sex and lower likelihood\nof STIs in late adolescence likely works through influ-\nences on sexual behaviors (eg, fewer partners, fewer in-\ncidents of sexual activity, or more consistent condom use)\nor some aspect of partner choice (eg, monogamous re-\nlationship, marriage, or \"safer\" partners). There is lit-\nerature32 documenting sex-differentiated socialization by\nparents, with adolescent boys being more likely to be en-\ncouraged to be independent and adolescent girls more\nlikely to be encouraged to be obedient. Borawski et al33\nalso found that adolescent girls report less negotiated un-\nsupervised time than adolescent boys. The link between\nperceived parental disapproval of sex and lower longi-\ntudinal risk of STIs among adolescent girls may be, at least\nin part, the result of internalization of more conven-\ntional standards or a stronger desire among adolescent\ngirls to behave in ways that will not result in parental dis-\napproval.\nWe also found sex differences in the protective rela-\ntionship between higher GPA and lower longitudinal STI\nrisk. Previous research30 has shown that adolescents with\nhigher scores on a standardized measure for vocabulary\nare less likely to engage in vaginal intercourse and other\nnoncoital sexual behaviors than those with lower scores,\nand that this relationship is stronger among adolescent\ngirls than adolescent boys. Our findings are generally con-\nsistent with this observation. However, GPA is influ-\nenced by many factors other than verbal ability, and it is\npossible that higher grades, especially for adolescent girls,\nmay be another manifestation of internalization of con-\nventional standards and a desire to avoid parental dis-\napproval--which in the realm of sexual development may\nbe linked to less risky sexual behaviors and partner\nchoices. Further research will clearly be needed to bet-\nter understand predictors of longitudinal risk of STIs for\nadolescent girls and boys, and how and why these pre-\ndictors may differ by sex.\nOverall, our negative findings are perhaps the most\ninteresting. Family, school, and individual factors linked\nto delayed sexual debut among adolescents16 in large part\ndid not predict STI status 6 years later. Perhaps the cor-\nrelation between early sexual debut and risky sexual be-\nhaviors (and, therefore, risk of STIs)12-15 weakens as ado-\nlescents approach adulthood. Furthermore, it may be\nunrealistic to expect broad protective models based on\nthe adolescent resiliency literature to longitudinally pre-\ndict complex health outcomes. Future research will be\nneeded to better understand our negative findings.\nThere were several limitations of this study. First, we\ndid not investigate the process by which family, school,\nand individual factors influence risk of later STIs, in-\ncluding the potential role of sexual behaviors. Second,\nthe original Add Health sample was school based, so drop-\nouts were excluded. However, Add Health has followed\nup all originally enrolled participants, including drop-\nouts, and previous research suggests that potential bias\nbecause of missing out-of-school youth in Add Health is\nsmall.34 Third, 24.3% of the original wave I sample could\nnot be located at wave III, and results of all 3 STI tests\nwere not available for 19.0% of wave III respondents. How-\never, careful assessment has shown that risk of wave III\nnonresponse bias seems minimal,35 and comparisons of\nwave III participants who did and did not provide urine\nspecimens for STI testing have shown few differences.36\nFourth, the performances of STI tests on urine speci-\nmens are not perfect,21 which influences the accuracy of\nour main outcome variable. We are reassured by previ-\nous analyses quantifying the effect of nonresponse and\ntest performance on prevalence estimates that show the\nTable 3.

All rights reserved.\nrisk of this potential bias seems small.3 Fifth, if wave III\npositive STI test results represent infections that have per-\nsisted since wave I, we would overestimate the influ-\nence of our predictive model. However, it is unlikely that\nthese STIs would persist for 6 years because of the pro-\npensity of infections to resolve spontaneously37 or be ef-\nfectively treated with antibiotics,38 which may be given\nfor other reasons. Of more concern, our STI outcomes\nmost likely reflect recent sexual behaviors; no serologic\nstudies were available to test for antibody responses to\nSTIs, which would more closely approximate cumula-\ntive risk of infection. Sixth, the reliability and validity of\nmost independent variables have not been evaluated and\nmeasures included few items (eg, perceived parental dis-\napproval of sex). Seventh, our independent measures may\nnot have captured important dimensions of family and\nschool context during adolescence that may influence later\nrisk of STIs (eg, familial patterns of health care use), lim-\niting the predictive ability of our model.\nIn summary, our results show that adolescents' aca-\ndemic success and perceptions of parental disapproval\nof sexual intercourse diminish the risk of acquiring STIs\nin young adulthood, particularly for females. Further\nresearch will be needed to understand how these factors\ndiminish STI risk, and to identify other strategies to\nreduce STI prevalence among adolescents and young\nadults. Parents should be encouraged to convey clear\nmessages that they do not approve of their children\nhaving sexual intercourse during adolescence. Finally,\nprevention and intervention programs will need to\naccount for the complex phenomena that contribute to\nhealth problems faced by adolescents and young\nadults, including STIs and the human immunodefi-\nciency virus.\nCorrespondence: Carol A.
