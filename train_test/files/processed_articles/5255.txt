Factors that contributed to fewer Black1 teachers in\nthe profession have also been attributed to school desegrega-\nfor college (Irvine, 1988), standardized testing for teachers\naccess and opportunity to pursue other professional careers\nTracing the history of Black teachers in the United States,\nFoster (1997) reported that Black teachers grew more than\nPrior to the Brown vs. Board decision in 1954, approximately\n50% of all Black professionals in the United States, some\nwho were graduates of Historically Black Colleges and\nUniversities (HBCUs), were teachers (Madkins, 2011).\nHowever, after the Brown v. Board ruling, nearly 40,000\nBlack teachers lost their jobs in 17 southern states from 1954\n2004). From that time, the percentage of Black teachers con-\ntinued to decline to the point where they represented 7% of\nent decade, the Black teacher workforce is approximately\n8% (National Center for Educational Statistics, 2010), while\nBlack students represent 16% of the school population\n(Madkins, 2011). There is great disparity between the per-\ncentage of Black teachers in the workforce and the percent-\nage of Black students enrolled in U.S. schools (Fine, 2004;\ncal that teacher education programs become proactive in\nrecruiting and preparing Black teachers to teach in urban\nsettings.\nWhile all teachers, regardless of race, can be trained to be\neffective teachers of Black students (Leonard, 2008), some\ntheorists believe \"minority teachers are particularly adept at\nmotivating and engaging minority students because they\noften bring knowledge of student background to the class-\nroom that enhances students' educational experience\" (i.e.,\nculturally responsive pedagogy [CRP]; Mitchell, 1998, p.\ners of color familiar with students' cultural backgrounds are\nmore likely to build positive relationships between the home\nand school to enhance student learning. Black teachers are\nimportant in the teacher workforce because it is important for\nBlack students to see them as successful role models (Cooper,\n1998). Although behaviors cannot be generalized, Black\nteachers are more likely to be familiar with the cultural\nnuances and vernacular of Black students and have the skills\nand ability to motivate them to learn.

Black students are more likely\nto succeed when they have teachers who meet their aca-\ndemic, psychological, social, and emotional needs (Mitchell,\n1998). In this era of accountability and teacher reform, it is\nimperative to recruit and retain Black teachers to prepare\nBlack students (and all students) to be productive citizens\nand to lead productive lives. Teacher preparation programs\nare critical to the recruitment and development of diverse\nteacher candidates.\nThe purpose of this article is to examine teacher prepara-\ntion from the perspective of the novice teacher (i.e., less than\n3 years experience). We will discuss traditional and alterna-\ntive teacher preparation programs and Black teachers' expe-\nriences in these programs. These teachers'voices are missing\nfrom the literature regarding teacher retention and attrition.\nMoore (2012) found that Black teachers were dissatisfied\nwith their jobs after analyzing School and Staffing Survey\n(SASS) teacher data using school environment factors to\npredict school dissatisfaction. In this article, we examine the\nexperiences of five teachers enrolled in alternative certifica-\ntion programs and one additional teacher who completed a\ntraditional teacher preparation program. Teachers were inter-\nviewed to determine their experiences during teacher prepa-\nration and induction. These six Black teachers comprised a\nsample of convenience that entered the teaching field from\ndifferent pathways. Black teachers' counterstories about\ntheir experiences in teacher education programs and in urban\nschools are important if we are to understand the reasons\nwhy they chose to teach, stay in teaching or leaving the field.\nPrior to presenting and analyzing data collected from the par-\nticipants, the conceptual framework and literature review on\nteacher quality and teacher certification programs are pre-\nsented below.\nConceptual Framework\nThe conceptual framework that undergirds the principles in\nthis article is critical race theory (CRT), and the constructs\nthat support this theory are culturally responsive pedagogy\n(CRP) and social justice pedagogy (SJP). CRT allows for\nexamination of deeper questions around equity and race,\nchallenging the colorblind approach of a traditional liberal\ncivil rights stance, and examining how citizenship and race\ncept of CRP emerged from the multicultural education litera-\npedagogy as \"using the cultural knowledge, prior experi-\nences, frames of reference, and performance styles of ethni-\ncally diverse students to make learning encounters more\nrelevant and effective for them\" (p. 29). CRP is based on the\nassumption that \"responsiveness to cultural differences is\nfundamental to effective teaching and learning\" (Gay, 2009,\np. 190). It is validating, comprehensive, multidimensional,\nempowering, transformative, and emancipatory (Gay, 2000).\nCRP creates the opportunity for students to learn in a third\nspace where ethnic ways of knowing are valued alongside\ndominant canons of knowledge (Gay, 2000; Lipka et al.,\n2005). CRP is an attempt to use the cultural capital that stu-\ndents bring from home and community as a springboard to\nlearn. Cultural capital embodies the norms, ideologies, lan-\nguage, behavior, mores, and practices of a particular group\nand is transmitted to children as cultural knowledge (Howard,\nRather than adhering to a deficit theory, teachers should\nview students' culture as an asset on which to build new\nknowledge. It is critical to understand the importance of\nother ways of knowing and other forms of mathematical\nactivity (Greer, Mukhopadhyay, Powell, & Nelson-Barber,\n2009). Culture is embedded in the natural world and influ-\nences every aspect of our lives. According to Nieto (2002),\nCulture is the ever-changing values, traditions, social and\npolitical relationships, and worldview created and shared by a\ngroup of people bound together by a common history, geographic\nlocation, language, social class, and/or religion and how these\nare transformed by those who share them. (p. 53)\nWe define SJP as holding specific social-justice-related\nperspectives and actions that provide all students with oppor-\ntunities to learn core content in meaningful ways that seek to\nimprove the economic and social conditions of marginalized\nindividuals and groups and that work toward the reduction (if\nnot the complete elimination) of deficit-oriented beliefs and\nmathematics example as the authors are both faculty in math-\nematics education. The Young People's Project (YPP), an\noutgrowth of the Algebra Project, uses critical literacy to\nengage students in community-based and social-justice-ori-\nented mathematics activities. Critical literacy means \"to\napproach knowledge critically and skeptically, see relation-\nships between ideas, look for underlying explanations for\nphenomena, and question whose interests are served and\nwho benefits\" (Gutstein, 2006, p. 5). The mission of YPP is\nto use mathematics literacy as a tool to develop young lead-\ners and organizers who radically change the quality of educa-\ntion and quality of life in their communities so that all\nchildren have the opportunity to reach their full human\npotential (YPP, n.d.).\nTeacher Quality\nTeacher quality has become a major issue in education in the\nUnited States in the last decade with the requirements of the\nNo Child Left Behind Act (NCLB; 2002). According to the\nUnited States Department of Education, a highly qualified\nteacher is one who has a bachelor's degree, full state\nEvans and Leonard 3\ncertification or licensure, and can demonstrate content\nknowledge in the subject area (U.S. Department of Education,\n2004). Evidence for the final criterion is provided by com-\npletion of a content area major or equivalent number of cred-\nits, and passing a standardized content examination. Poor\nteacher quality can have a direct and negative impact on the\nlearning of Black students (Desimone & Long, 2010), espe-\ncially in mathematics, which we know is a gatekeeper course\nfor access to college education (Martin, Gholson, & Leonard,\n2010). Students' standardized mathematics scores are corre-\nlated to school variables more so than standardized reading\nscores, which are associated with home variables (Barr et al.,\n2006). Thus, teachers' content knowledge and pedagogical\npractices in mathematics have a tremendous impact on stu-\ndents, particularly Black students whose mathematical expe-\nriences have largely been shaped by a teaching style known\nas the \"pedagogy of poverty\" (Haberman, 1991), which pro-\nmotes seatwork over critical thinking and problem solving.\nWhile content knowledge is an important variable, prior\nresearch has found that students'trust in teachers and the belief\nthat teachers care about them (i.e., \"ethic of care\") are strong\nvariables for academic success, particularly among Black chil-\ntraditional programs may need strong intentional support from\ntheir educational programs and professional development to\nfoster the instilment of trust and care in their students, the\nquick immersion of alternative certification teachers into the\nclassroom makes the development of an \"ethic of care\" more\ncritical for these teachers. This is particularly true for teachers\nwho have students who have been conditioned by prior experi-\nence to expect apathy from teachers who have not exhibited\ngenuine concern and care (Haberman, 1991).\nStudent learning can and should be measured in a myriad\nof ways, including grades and creative products and produc-\ntions (e.g., essays, reports, oratorical contests, acting in\nplays, mathematical modeling, science fair projects, music,\nand artistic ability). In addition to academics, education\nshould focus on the development of the whole child, which\nnot only includes intellectual but psychological, social, and\nemotional growth (Haynes & Comer, 1990). The affective\ndomain is just as critical in motivating children to learn and\nshould be considered in the teaching and learning process\nTeacher Education Programs\nSince the publication of A Nation at Risk (National\nCommission on Excellence in Education, 1983), teacher\neducation has undergone several decades of change. In 1980,\n\"there was a shift in teacher education away from the train-\ning approaches\" where \"prospective teachers were taught to\nengage in classroom specific behaviors that had been shown\nto be effective through programs of research correlating\nclassroom processes\" with student achievement (Cochran-\nSmith, 2004, p. 8). Instead, teacher education began to focus\non \"teacher thinking, teacher knowledge, and teacher learn-\ning\" (Cochran-Smith, 2004), particularly as it is related to\ncontent knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge\nThe 1990s ushered in the Standards movement, and\nteacher educators shifted toward inclusion of standards-\nbased practices in content-based methods courses. By the\nyear 2000, the context shifted toward accountability along\nwith the passage of NCLB in 2001, which led to a focus on\nstudent outcomes. About the same time as teacher prepara-\ntion programs began to focus to outcomes-based assess-\nment, another trend emerged that focused on the theme of\nteaching for social justice in teacher education programs\n(Enterline, Cochran-Smith, Ludlow, & Mitescu, 2008).\nSocial justice orientations are also critical in helping teacher\ncandidates develop dispositions to work with poor urban\nstudents and students of color whose backgrounds differ\nfrom the teachers and to build classroom environments that\nfoster deep learning.\nTraditional Education Programs\nTraditional teacher education programs are generally housed\nin schools or colleges of education. Many programs, but not\nall, are designed to grant teacher licensure after completion\nof a bachelor's degree with a program of study in early child-\nhood, elementary, or secondary education. Other programs\nonly grant teacher licensure at the graduate level. Most of\nthese traditional teacher preparation programs reflect demo-\ngraphics that reveal about 80% to 93% of teacher candidates,\ndepending on the region of the country, identify as White\nhave noted the need for more diversity in the teaching force\nCollaborative on Diversity in the Teaching Force, 2004).\nFurthermore, regardless of entry level, almost all tradi-\ntional education programs require teacher candidates to pass\nPraxis examinations prior to admission to candidacy in a\nteacher education program. Some researchers contend that\nuse of Praxis examinations as a basis of admission to teacher\neducation is one reason for the decline of Black teacher can-\nthat Praxis tests do not predict teacher effectiveness and are\nnot valid measures of teacher preparation. Yet, these assess-\nments have become the norm in the current political climate.\nIn response to low passing rates among Black teacher candi-\ndates, HBCUs have responded by offering test preparation\nprograms to improve the passing rate of their teacher candi-\ndates. Nevertheless, traditional programs are rigorous and\nrequire completion of a major or minor in the content and\ntica and student teaching) at the undergraduate level, or 18\nmonths to 2 years of intensive study at the graduate level\nwith student teaching.\n4 SAGE Open\nAlternative Certification Programs\nAlternative certification programs have been promoted as a\nsolution to teacher shortages in less affluent high-need urban\nschools highly populated by Black and Latina/o students\n(New York City Teaching Fellows [NYCTF], 2012a; Teach\nfor America [TFA], 2011a). Alternative certification pro-\ngrams allow candidates to enter the teaching profession in\nurban schools by quickly entering the classroom and teach-\ning with a temporary certificate while earning a master's\ndegree in education and initial certification. While these pro-\ngrams have been criticized as quick fixes to teacher shortages\nand placing teachers in classrooms without a great deal of\nprior training, these nontraditional routes to teacher certifica-\ntion have expanded tremendously over the past 30 years\n(Madkins, 2011). Furthermore, these programs tap a differ-\nent pool of teacher candidates than traditional programs,\nwhich includes older career changers and minority teacher\ncandidates (Fiestritzer as cited in Madkins, 2011). Programs\nlike TFAand the NYCTF program have had minimal to some\nsuccess in recruiting Black teachers to teach in urban schools\n(Evans, 2010). Other programs, such as Teach Tomorrow in\nOakland (TTO), have been successful in recruiting diverse\ncandidates into teaching. TTO claimed that a TTO teacher\nwill be a \"qualified, culturally diverse, educator who lives in\nand is dedicated to the Oakland community\" (TTO, 2013).\nThe TFA and NYCTF programs quickly immerse teacher\ncandidates into the teaching profession over the course of\nseveral months. While they receive full teacher salaries\nbeginning in September, they are given summer stipends\nwhen they begin the program in June and receive subsidized\ntuition at their partnering universities throughout their time\nspent in the programs. TFA and NYCTF teachers also take\ngraduate education courses taught by professors in their pro-\ngrams at partnering universities. In New York, for example,\nthese alternative certification teachers receive a Transitional\nB license, which is a temporary and conditional teaching\nlicense issued by the New York State Education Department,\nwhich allows them to teach for 3 years before earning initial\ncertification. TFA teacher candidates may also be licensed in\nother states through a similar process. Each of the two pro-\ngrams is described below.\nTFA Program. TFA is a nonprofit organization that began in\n1990 with the goal of sending high-achieving college gradu-\nates to high-need schools to teach underserved students in\nurban and rural communities. Wendy Koop, TFA's founder, a\ngraduate of Princeton University, was interested in doing\nsomething substantial after graduation (Kopp, 2003). Koop\nrealized that many recent college graduates at highly ranked\nuniversities in the United States would consider teaching if\ngiven the opportunity. TFA developed into a teacher corps\nthat allowed new graduates of prestigious universities, with\nan interest in teaching, to quickly begin teaching students in\nthe communities with the highest need. Kopp considered\nTFA could be like the Peace Corps in the 1990s and that\nteachers would stay in education or go into other sectors but\nremain advocates for public education.\nTFA's mission \"is to build the movement to eliminate edu-\ncational inequity by enlisting our nation's most promising\nfuture leaders in this effort\" (TFA, 2011b), and TFA's vision\nis that \"one day, all children in this nation will have the\nopportunity to attain an excellent education\" (TFA, 2011c).\nTFA recognizes the importance of SJP and makes every\nattempt to recruit teacher candidates who have dispositions\namenable to SJP, and TFA claims to address it in their\nteacher-training program (W. Seamans, personal communi-\ncation, April 5, 2010). The TFA program requires that recent\ncollege graduates commit to teaching for 2 years while tak-\ning coursework in teacher education, and they would serve in\nhigh-need schools throughout the United States in urban and\nrural communities. Approximately 68% of TFA teachers are\nAccording to the TFA 2010 annual report, there are more\nthan 20,000 TFA alumni throughout the United States (TFA,\n2011d). On completion of the commitment to the program,\nnearly two thirds of alumni stay in the field of education,\nwhich is about 13,000, with about half of those alumni\nremaining in the classroom, which is about 6,500 (TFA,\n2011d). This means that about one third of TFA alumni stay\nin the classroom on completion of their commitment. For\nthose who stay in the classroom, about 90% of them teach in\nunderserved communities (TFA, 2011d). However, critics of\nTFA believe that after becoming certified, many TFA teach-\ners leave the field (Darling-Hammond, Holtzman, Gatlin, &\nTFA teachers reported planning to teach 10 years or more.\nTeacher quality in TFA. The findings on TFA teacher qual-\nity have been mixed. Darling-Hammond et al. (2005) found\ncertified teachers had significantly higher student achieve-\nment gains as compared with uncertified teachers, including\nuncertified TFA teachers. Laczko-Kerr and Berliner (2002)\nfound that students of equally inexperienced, but fully cer-\ntified teachers performed better than the students of TFA\nteachers. It appears that certification is a key factor because\nstudents of uncertified TFA teachers performed at the same\nlevel as did students of other uncertified teachers (Darling-\nContrary to these findings, TFA teachers had significantly\nhigher student achievement in mathematics when compared\nwith certified teachers from Grades 4 to 8, and there was an\nadvantage for TFA teachers, specifically in the middle school\nyears (Boyd, Grossman, Lankford, Loeb, Michelli, et al.,\nTaylor's (2008) study of secondary mathematics and science\nteachers found that uncertified TFA teachers were more\neffective, as measured by student achievement variables,\nthan traditionally certified teachers, including more experi-\nenced traditionally certified teachers. Xu et al. (2008) noted\nEvans and Leonard 5\nTFA \"recruits and selects graduates from some of the most\nselective colleges and universities across the country\" (p. 2),\nand 62% of TFA teachers were educated at the most selective\nand very selective higher education institutions while only\n22% of non-TFA teachers were educated at these institutions.\nXu et al. (2008) further claimed that TFA teachers had higher\nstandardized tests scores than did non-TFA teachers, point-\ning out that \"disparities do exist between TFA and non-TFA\nteachers in terms of their academic preparation\" (p. 17). Xu\net al. (2008) concluded perhaps TFA teachers were able to\noffset their lack of experience through better academic prep-\naration or motivation.\nAccording to TFA (2009) documentation, the National\nPrincipal Survey found that more than 90% of the 1,248 prin-\ncipals surveyed reported they were satisfied with TFA teach-\ners: TFA teachers made a positive impact in their schools;\nTFA teachers were as effective as other beginning teachers in\noverall performance and impact on student achievement; and\nTFA teachers had comparable teacher preparation. Nearly\n90% of principals said they would hire TFA teachers again\nand that the impact of TFA teachers on student achievement\nwas excellent or good. Of particular interest is that nearly\n90% of principals found TFA teachers to be knowledgeable\nin their subject matter.\nNYCTF Program. The NYCTF program is an alternative certi-\nfication program developed in 2000 by the New Teacher\nProject and the New York City Department of Education\n(Boyd, Lankford, Loeb, Rockoff, & Wyckoff, 2007) with the\ngoal of bringing professionals from other careers to fill the\nlarge teacher shortage in the public schools of New York.\nWhen the program began, there was a predicted shortage of\n7,000 teachers, which raised fears that there could be up to\ntury (Stein, 2002). The mission of NYCTF is \"to recruit and\nprepare high-quality, dedicated individuals to become teach-\ners who raise student achievement in the New York City\nclassrooms that need them most\" (NYCTF, 2012b). NYCTF\nteachers, often called Teaching Fellows, generally teach in\nhigh-need urban schools throughout the city (Boyd, Gross-\nThe NYCTF program is the largest alternative certification\nprogram in New York (Kane et al., 2006), and it grew rapidly\nduring its early years: \"Fellows grew from about 1% of newly\n(Boyd et al., 2007, p. 10). Teaching Fellows represent about\none fourth of all New York mathematics teachers (NYCTF,\nFellows, which represented about 11% of all teachers work-\nin the NYCTF program are persons of color (NYCTF, 2012b),\nwhich makes NYCTF a model for one of the most diverse\nrecruitment and retention programs in the nation.\nRetention of Teaching Fellows has been comparable with\nthe retention of traditionally prepared teachers (Kane et al.,\npleted their 1st year of teaching, 75% completed at least 3\nyears of teaching, and more than half had taught for at least 5\nyears (NYCTF, 2012c).

Sipe and\nwere in their 2nd year of the program intended to stay in\neducation.\nTeacher quality in NYCTF.Teaching Fellows have, on\naverage, higher content test scores than other teacher can-\ndidates (Boyd et al., 2007), as measured by content certifi-\ncation examinations. They also generally have high content\nknowledge (Kane et al., 2006), as measured by undergradu-\nate grade point average and mathematics SAT scores. How-\never, few differences were found between the mathematics\nachievement levels of students in Grades 3 through 8 taught\nby Teaching Fellows compared with traditionally prepared\nteachers (Boyd, Grossman, Lankford, Loeb, Michelli, et al.,\nstudents assigned to teaching fellows [sic] performed similarly\nto students assigned to certified teachers in math . . . This\naverage difference belies somewhat larger gaps among novice\nteachers . . . and no difference between teaching fellows [sic]\nand certified teachers with multiple years of experience. (p. 41)\nAfter several years of teaching experience, however, the stu-\ndents of Teaching Fellows outperformed the students of tra-\nditionally prepared teachers (Boyd, Grossman, Lankford,\nMethod\nCRT uses counternarratives as a method for qualitative anal-\nysis (Sol\u00f3rzano & Yosso, 2002) to tell the stories of \"people\nwhose experiences are not often told, including people of\ncolor, women, gay, and the poor\" (Sol\u00f3rzano & Yosso, 2002,\np. 26). Counterstories are important because they present the\nnarratives of marginalized people, which often stand in con-\ntrast to dominant narratives. We use counterstories in this\narticle as a method to capture the voices and concerns of nov-\nice Black teachers, some who left and others who remain in\nthe teaching profession.\nSetting\nWe chose to interview teachers who were trained in tradi-\ntional or alternative certification programs in the Mid-Atlantic\nregion of the United States. Our assumption was that these\nteachers had a variety of experiences and would most likely\nwork with predominantly Black and linguistically diverse\nchildren in large urban districts. Four of the teachers we\n6 SAGE Open\ninterviewed were trained in alternative certification programs\nin New York City and another in Washington, D.C. We also\ninterviewed one teacher who completed a traditional prepara-\ntion program in Philadelphia. These teachers consequently\nworked in predominantly Black school districts in New York,\nWashington, D.C., and Maryland, respectively.\nParticipants\nWe conducted interviews with six Black teachers who had\ntaught 3 years or less. They ranged from 22 to 60 years of age\nwhen they began teaching. However, given that some of\nthese teachers had more teaching experience than others,\ntheir ages ranged from 25 to 60 when they were interviewed.\nFive of the teachers were female and one was male.\nPseudonyms are used for anonymity. Two of the teachers,\nDana (25 years old) and Faith (25 years old), were licensed\nto teach through TFA--one in New York and one in\nWashington, D.C., respectively. Three of the teachers, Carol\n(24 years old), Alice (53 years old), and Benjamin (60 years\nold) obtained licensure through the NYCTF program. The\nsixth teacher, Elizabeth (31 years old) was licensed by com-\npleting a traditional graduate teacher education program.\nThese teachers taught a variety of levels from first grade to\nmiddle school and regular to bilingual and special education\nstudents.\nInterviews\nWe developed a protocol that was emailed to each of the\nteachers for completion. Then, we telephoned each teacher to\nfollow up on the interview protocol with additional queries.\nField notes were recorded during the telephone interview.\nInterview responses and field notes yielded two pages of\nresponses per participant.\nAnalysis\nWe analyzed the interview data for themes and patterns using\nthe constant comparison method (Glaser & Strauss, 1967).\nThe analysis involved the two authors reading and rereading\nthe transcribed text separately, sharing independent ideas,\nand then coming to consensus on the interpretative of data.\nFindings\nThe themes that emerged, while a direct result of the protocol,\nwere (a) perceptions of program quality, (b) perceptions of\nteacher preparedness, (c) teaching styles, and (d) teacher\nretention and attrition. Summary statements and direct quotes\nwill be presented to examine these six Black teachers'experi-\nences in terms of induction, mentoring, and support.Although\ntheir teaching experiences ranged from 8 days to 3 years, the\nvoices of teachers new to the field are needed to understand\nretention and attrition issues among Black teachers.\nPerceptions of Program Quality\nAs teaching for social justice has become a watchword in\nmany teacher education programs (Enterline et al., 2008),\nwe specifically queried whether SJP was part of these six\nteachers' training. Five of the six teachers reported that\nSJP was part of their training. The male teacher, Benjamin,\nwho was trained in the NYCTF program, was the only\nteacher who did not think SJP was a major focus of his\nprogram: \"I think people step around it, but don't address\nit too much . . . \" Alice, another NYCTF stated that SJP\nwas only emphasized in one course. Carol was more spe-\ncific stating, \"There is disparity of resources in high-needs\nschools, specifically in special education; wealthier com-\nmunities have more resources.\" Among the TFA teachers,\nthere was a mixed response. Faith, the D.C. teacher with\nTFA training, stated that SJP was not part of her TFA train-\ning but part of the graduate program through a Foundations\nof Education course. Dana, who was new to the TFA pro-\ngram reported that SJP was part of TFA training and gradu-\nate courses. Dana's self-report is consistent with Seamans'\npersonnel communication that TFA addressed SJP in the\nteacher training program. However, Seamans' comment\nwas based on his experience in the Western United States.\nThe information reported here reveals that emphasis on\nSJP may vary within TFA for different regions of the\ncountry.\nIn addition to SJP, the teachers were queried about the\nstrengths of their teacher education program. Self-reports\nfrom the teachers reveal the following:\nI had two different field placements focused on urban schools.\n(Elizabeth, traditional program)\nTeach for America offer [sic] a lot of support both inside and\noutside of the classroom to its corps members. It is as if they\nhold you by the hand through the process. While the work is\ndemanding, it is both necessary and important. (Dana, TFA)\nRigorous lesson planning with a collaborative team led by an\nexperienced Teach for America teacher for five weeks; graduate\nschool alternative certification and master's program with other\nstudents new to teaching in the same school district; strong\ncourse reading materials; TFA support throughout the year.\n(Faith, TFA)\nThe program strength is centered on child psychology and\nhuman development and the different courses and different\nprofessors we have. The social justice aspect in one course really\nhelped me. Currently, I'm taking human development and it has\nthis [SJP] aspect to it and is interesting. (Alice, NYCTF)\nPrepared you for what will see in terms of curriculum and\nbehaviors (classroom management). (Benjamin, NYCTF)\nCurriculum planning and resources to connect to the Common\nCore State Standards; lesson planning. (Carol, NYCTF)\nEvans and Leonard 7\nAnalyses of these responses reveal Elizabeth, the tradi-\ntional teacher, focused on field placement in urban schools,\nwhich was probably important to her as a Black teacher.\nInterestingly, a key word that was used by both of the TFA\nteachers was support. Dana and Faith talked about the types\nof support they received from the TFA network. However,\nFaith was explicit in terms of describing the rigorous training\ninvolved in learning to teach, specifically as it related to les-\nson planning. A common thread among NYCTF teachers\nwas curriculum and courses.Alice resonated positively about\nher child development courses, which were most likely\nimportant to her as a middle school teacher. Benjamin was\nthe only teacher to mention classroom management at this\njuncture. However, this was no doubt important to him as a\nmiddle school special education teacher of autistic children.\nWhen asked what they would change about their teacher\neducation program, the responses reveal changes in policies\nor procedures that these novice teachers believed would\nimprove the quality of their teacher education program:\nMore diversity among graduate students. (Elizabeth, traditional\nprogram)\nI would allow people to obtain graduate degrees in more than\njust teaching. I think there are other graduate programs that\nwould equip corps members with the proper training and\npreparation to be a successful influence in urban communities.\n(Dana, TFA)\nNot feeling like we are using summer school students as \"guinea\npig\" subjects. (Faith, TFA)\nIt needs to be a little bit longer. Just having the summer and then\ngoing into the schools is difficult. Sometimes you're lucky and\nhave great colleagues, who will help, but I have classmates who\ngo into schools without any help, and this is difficult on first-\nyear teachers. We have a lot of knowledge, but we don't know\nwhere to start. It took a year to figure a lot of this out. They need\nto give us more than 2-3 months before becoming teachers.\n(Alice, NYCTF)\nI took an autism workshop but hadn't done a lesson plan for an\nautism class. How do I structure a unit or a lesson plan to meet\nthe body of students who cannot understand? That's challenging!\n(Benjamin, NYCTF)\nMore workshops where we can have hands on materials and\nactually create something. (Carol, NYCTF)\nInterestingly, these teachers' comments are program spe-\ncific. Elizabeth's comment about lack of diversity in tradi-\ntional teacher education programs concurs with the literature\nDana, while new to TFA, suggested the program broaden its\navailability of support for other types of graduate study. This\ncomment, while unintentional, actually creates a barrier to\nretaining Black teachers in the field of education. Expanded\nopportunities for Blacks to attain other degrees led to the\ndecline of education majors (Madkins, 2011). Faith's com-\nment reveals her personal values and mores about using stu-\ndents as subjects to learn about practice. Whether contrived\nor not, it is important for teachers to have field experiences.\nLearning can be dialectic in such settings in which students\nand teachers learn from each other. Notably, all of the\nNYCTF mentioned receiving more training in terms of field\nexperience (Alice), lesson planning (Benjamin), or develop-\nment of curriculum resources (Carol). These comments, too,\nconcur with some critics of alternative teacher education pro-\ngrams that early immersion is detrimental to teachers and\nstudents (Darling-Hammond et al., 2005).\nPerceptions of Teacher Preparedness\nThe teachers in the NYCTF program indicated they felt well\nprepared by their programs. Alice also mentioned emphasis\non social justice in her program. The others indicated plan-\nning and curriculum as program strengths. While Benjamin\nindicated he felt well prepared by his program to teach urban\nstudents, Alice and Carol indicated that it took them more\ntime to feel comfortable. They both alluded to not being pre-\npared for the lack of resources in the schools. In the case of\nTFA teachers, Dana believed, although she had not yet\ntaught, that she would be well prepared by her program.\nFaith also indicated that she felt well prepared and identified\nclassroom management courses and the TFA summer insti-\ntute as assets that helped to prepare her for teaching in urban\nschools. Elizabeth reported that her field placements were of\nsignificant assistance in her preparation, particularly in\nworking with urban students. Elizabeth also mentioned prep-\naration in cultural relevance and SJP as part of her program\nto prepare her to work with urban children.\nTeaching Styles\nWhen the data were analyzed, themes related to teaching\nstyles also emerged. Because mathematics achievement is\nmore aligned with school variables (Barr et al., 2006), we\nasked teachers if they connected SJP to their teaching of\nmathematics. When it came to pedagogy, Alice indicated\nthat she connected mathematics instruction to social justice\nby attempting to connect the content to her students' experi-\nences and lives. She emphasized economics and used every-\nday purchases as examples. An example of her mathematics\nconnection to increase student motivation included collect-\ning data on the music produced by famous hip-hop artists,\nwhich also made connections to CRP. Carol, who had 2\nyears of prior teaching experience and taught early child-\nhood special education students, indicated that she did not\nconnect mathematics to social justice as frequently as she\ndid with English and social studies, particularly noting that\nconnections to social justice were made during Black\nHistory month. Benjamin had only been teaching for 8 days,\n8 SAGE Open\nand he reported not having the opportunity to make connec-\ntions to social justice. Benjamin also stated he believed his\nautistic students were too low functioning to connect this\nwell, but claimed he made connections to social justice with\nparents and other teachers. However, he did not provide any\nexamples. Dana (TFA), who did not have the opportunity to\nteach in an actual classroom setting prior to the interview,\nindicated\nI will try to. Teaching in an urban community, the issue of social\njustice is important. Its importance should be obvious to the\nstudents. If it is not naturally obvious, I think it is our jobs as\neducators to make it known.\nElizabeth, who taught first-grade students in a large urban\nschool district in Maryland, reported using SJP only in liter-\nacy but did not incorporate CRP even though her methods\ncourses addressed cultural relevance and funds of knowl-\nedge. On further probing, she reported she was simply too\noverwhelmed with curriculum implementation and class-\nroom management to make consistent links to CRP and SJP.\nWhen queried, Faith stated that she did not use CRP or SJP\nto teach core curriculum even though she taught PreK-5\nEnglish Language Learners. However, on further probing\nshe explained that she did use elements of culture to help her\nstudents understand English vocabulary. Perhaps the\ndemands placed on these two teachers in Maryland and\nWashington, D.C., inhibited them from going the extra step\nto ensure their lessons were more relevant to the lives of their\nstudents. New teachers have many tasks to attend to (e.g.,\ntaking attendance, collecting lunch money, communicating\nwith parents, classroom management, and lesson planning),\nand, as a result, CRP and SJP may simply be overlooked.\nWhen it came to implementing lesson plans, all three\nNYCTF teachers indicated that they do not follow a script in\ntheir teaching, which meant they had some freedom in their\ninstruction. It should be noted that New York State has\nadopted the Common Core State Standards, which allows\nteachers to develop their own lesson plans as long as the\nStandards are met. Unlike the NYCTF teachers, Elizabeth\nand Faith indicated they were more inclined to teach with a\nscript because the districts strictly aligned lesson planning to\nStandards and were preoccupied with making Annual Yearly\nProgress (AYP) as required by NCLB (2001).\nTeacher Retention and Attrition\nWhile three of the teachers had taught less than 1 year,\nteacher retention and attrition emerged as a theme among\nthis group of novice Black teachers. Two of the NYCTF\nteachers with less than 1 year of experience were older\nnontraditional teacher candidates. Recall that Alice was 53\nand Benjamin was 60. Alternative certification programs\noften attract older teacher candidates who are most likely\nto be career changers (Madkins, 2011). While it is difficult\nto speculate what the attrition rate would be among teach-\ners with less than 1 year of experience, Alice (NYCTF)\nstated,\nI plan to stay in teaching and get certified in autism. This is the\nbiggest population I'm working with. I plan to teach for at least\nthe next 10 years and stay in special education. Maybe I'll be in\nan administration position eventually. I work with the PTA, and\nI think it's important to create a school community. Everyone\nworking together is like the village raising the child. We need\nthe sense of community, and we don't have this. There is not a\ncommunity investment. The only way to do that is to create\nactivities that create the school community. Students succeed\nwhen there's a strong school community.\nAlice's remarks reveal a strong sense of commitment to\nteaching, students, parents, and the community. Her care,\nconcern, and values align with those of older teachers found\nin Mitchell's (1998) study. Mitchell considered teaching as\nmore than the mere transfer of academic knowledge, but\nconsidered variables in the affective domain such as cultur-\nally relevant pedagogy. Teaching was meaningful and engag-\ning work with ramifications that went beyond the schoolhouse\ndoor. Like the teachers in Mitchell's study, Alice spent\nmoney out of her own pocket on her students. Teaching was\nnot a profession but a calling. This evidence suggests that\nAlice would most likely remain in education despite current\nchallenges.\nThis was not the case, however, for Faith and Elizabeth.\nRecall Faith was a TFA teacher prepared in Washington,\nD.C., and Elizabeth received licensure after completing a\ngraduate teacher education program. They were 24 and 26,\nrespectively, when they left the teaching profession. Both of\nthese young Black women were talented and gifted. They\ngraduated at the top of their high school classes and attended\nprestigious undergraduate institutions in the Midwest. They\nhad very high ideals and goals when they entered the teach-\ning profession and were committed to their students. Faith\nreported that she often stayed up until 10 or 11 p.m. prepar-\ning her lessons and only had 4 or 5 hours of sleep during the\nweek. Elizabeth often went to work at 6:30 a.m. and stayed\nuntil 4 p.m. during her first 2 years to prepare her lessons and\nmake sure she attended to her first-grade students' academic\nand developmental needs. When asked why they left the\nfield, they responded,\nI did not like the testing requirements for students to measure\nAYP. I had to proctor students who were in special education\nwhile my own students had a sub because only certified teachers\ncould proctor special education students. It was a lot of stress\nand confusion. My first-grade students did not like testing. We\nwere encouraged to minimized areas of instruction in health,\nsocial studies, and the arts because they were not aligned with\nthe testing. I left teaching because I felt stifled and was not able\nto be the creative teacher that I wanted to be. (Elizabeth,\ntraditional program)\nEvans and Leonard 9\nI did not feel like I had the support I needed from the school\ndistrict to succeed without stressing. I had met my two-year\ncommitment, and I was ready to move on. (Faith, TFA)\nElizabeth and Faith left the teaching profession after only\na few years, adding to the high rate of attrition and the teacher\nshortage. According to Ingersoll (2002), about one third of\nnew teachers leave the field in the first 3 years. At the time of\nthis interview, Elizabeth was pursuing a doctorate degree in\neducation and planned to enter the professoriate. Thus,\nalthough she left the classroom, she did not leave the field of\neducation and perhaps could make a difference in teacher\npreparation. Faith, however, left the field of education alto-\ngether. She recently began her own business and was work-\ning in New York in the fashion and cosmetic industry. While\nthe sample is too limited to draw any conclusions from the\ndata on teacher attrition, it is clear that school environment\nfactors such as overemphasis on student outcomes and lack\nof support caused these two young Black teachers dissatis-\nfaction and ultimately caused them to leave their schools.\nDiscussion\nWhile the sample of teachers interviewed in this study was\nvery small and cannot be generalized, the vignettes and find-\nings delineated above shed important insight into these six\nBlack teachers' experiences as teacher candidates and as\nteachers in urban schools. First, they all believed their pro-\ngrams were of high quality and prepared them well to teach\nin urban spaces. However, the traditionally trained teacher\nwas keenly aware of the lack of diversity in her program. If\nteacher education programs are going to make a difference in\npreparing teachers for urban schools, they must be serious\nabout the recruitment and retention of teachers of color in\ntheir teacher preparation programs. This involves more than\nputting pictures of diverse teacher candidates on brochures\nbut rather truly examining admission criteria and assessing\nprograms to ensure candidates from diverse ethnic and lin-\nguistic backgrounds are made welcome, treated fairly, and\nreceive the supports they need to succeed. This also involves\nrecruiting and retaining teacher educators of color who can\nserve as mentors and advocates for teacher candidates of\nSecond, some NYCTF teachers had expressed concern\nthat the swift immersion into the classroom may not be ideal\nfor them or their students. Being thrust into a classroom\nwithout sufficient field experience and opportunities to\ndevelop best practices can be disastrous. It forces new teach-\ners to sink or swim, and in many cases the teachers sink,\nleaving the profession far too soon and thus doing more dam-\nage to urban students who should receive the best teachers\nThird, teacher educators must model how to engage in\npedagogical practices that research has shown to be effective\nwith children of color (e.g., CRP and SJP; Cochran-Smith,\nFour of the six teachers in this sample who were actual class-\nroom teachers did not fully use CRP and SJP to their advan-\ntage. One in particular noted that she only made connections\nduring Black History month. While use of CRP or SJP is not\na panacea, research has shown that these pedagogies can\nmotivate children of color to learn (Lipka et al., 2005;\nshould investigate to what extent novice teachers have the\nflexibility to incorporate CRP and SJP into the curriculum\ngiven the current impetus on student outcomes. It is impor-\ntant that all teachers learn to teach for cultural relevance and\nsocial justice to motivate and empower all students (affective\ndomain) and attend to content knowledge to impact student\noutcomes (cognitive domain) to prepare more students for\ncollege and inspire some of them to pursue teaching as a\ncareer.\nFinally, the collective experiences of these novice Black\nteachers can be communicated to teacher candidates in initial\nlicensure programs and potential administrators in principal\nlicensure programs. Moreover, teacher educators and deans\nof schools and colleges of education should be aware of the\nbarriers that inhibit the enrollment of Black teachers in tradi-\ntional teacher education programs. While admission require-\nments such as passing Praxis I & II may be difficult to waive,\nsupport such as tutorials like those offered at HBCUs\n(Madkins, 2011) or financial support in the form of waivers\nto take the exams can be provided. Principals and superinten-\ndents should be made aware of variables that contribute to\nteacher satisfaction. For example, teacher autonomy and\ncontrol over the curriculum are highly correlated with teacher\nsatisfaction (Moore, 2012). Administrators should use such\ninformation to create school environments that encourage\nteacher retention.\nPolicy Implications\nRecently, teacher education programs have taken criticism in\nregard to training high-quality teachers for urban classrooms\n(McNeil, 2012). Secretary of Education,Arne Duncan, stated\nthat \"teacher preparation is broken and that the best educa-\ntors need to be teaching the highest-need children\" (McNeil,\n2012, n.p.). The teacher pipeline has become a \"revolving\ndoor\" where one in five teachers quit annually (Ingersoll,\nimprove student outcomes on high-stakes tests have been\nlinked to teacher dissatisfaction (Moore, 2012). Recent\nchanges in education policy in regard to meeting AYP have\nresulted in 33 states receiving waivers to opt out of NCLB\n(Resmovits, 2012). It remains to be seen what impact this\nwill have on student performance and teacher retention.\nTwo of the six teachers interviewed in this study quit within\nthe first 3 years. Interestingly, both teachers felt compelled to\nteach scripted lessons and listed teacher stress when queried\nabout their decisions to quit. One identified lack of resources\nand the other excessive testing, as additional reasons for leav-\ning the classroom. Once teachers are prepared and licensed,\nschools and colleges of education have little to do with the\nschool environment where teachers work. Schools and dis-\ntricts must also be accountable for teacher retention. Arne\nDuncan surmised that there are no schools or districts that\n\"work `systematically'to identify the best teachers and princi-\npals, then place them with the children with the highest needs\"\n(McNeil, 2012, n.p.). Going a step further, we know of no\nschool or district that provides the newest teachers with the\nbest resources and latitude to creatively work with students\nwithout mandates. School environments must be conducive to\nteaching and learning and trust that teachers, who have com-\npleted more rigorous requirements than ever in the history of\neducation, can do the job. Rather than deskilling teachers, we\nmust find ways to restore respect for the position.\nRecruiting and training Black teachers to work with Black\nstudents in urban and small urban school districts should be\na national priority. High school dropout rates remain dispro-\nportionally high among African American students and col-\nlege attainment among underrepresented students of color is\nbelow the national norm (Leonard & Evans, 2012; Mitchell,\nof the teacher workforce so that all students can experience\nthe passion and plurality that teachers of different back-\ngrounds bring to the classroom. Past history reveals that\nBlack teachers made a significant difference when it came to\neducating Black children, even in the face of limited\nAlternative certification programs continue to increase in\nsize. These programs appear to be more attractive to older\ncareer changers and prospective Black teachers. Rather than\ncriticizing these programs, perhaps schools and colleges of\neducation should work with leaders of alternative programs\nto ensure that more diverse teachers are recruited, supported,\nand trained to teach effectively in urban schools. Clearly,\nchanging the direction of the current course in teacher educa-\ntion is needed if teacher preparation, as we know it, intends\nto remain relevant. Adhering to the concerns voiced by the\nteachers in this study may increase teacher satisfaction and\nreverse the exodus of Black teachers from the field.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNote\n1.
