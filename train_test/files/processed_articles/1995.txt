While there are\nnumerous studies that established the inverse rela-\ntionship between low birth weight and blood\npressure (BP) in adults, few pediatric studies\nHypertension is the single most important risk\nfactor for cardiovascular events in adulthood.12\nEpidemiologic and clinical data also support a\nstrong link between obesity and hypertension.13\nUnfortunately, children in Canada rank among the\nmost obese children in the world. Windsor,\nOntario, and London, Ontario, rank as the 4th and\n5th most obese cities in Canada, respectively.14\nThey reflect a large proportion of the catchment\narea of Children's Hospital, London Health Sci-\nences Centre. We undertook a cross-sectional study\nof children attending our institution and compared\nthe BP (expressed as age-independent z scores) with\nbody mass index (BMI) (expressed as age-indepen-\ndent BMI z score), birth weight, gestational age,\nand maternal prepregnancy BMI. The objective of\nthis study was to establish the determinants of BP z\nscore in childhood. To prove that the Barker\nhypothesis applies to children, a negative correla-\ntion between BP z score and birth weight and ges-\ntational age was to be expected. If a high BMI, a\nhigh birth weight, or maternal obesity were more\nimportant, a positive correlation between BP z\nscore and these determinants was to be expected.\nThe investigation was a prospective cohort study\nusing the convenience sample of patients attending\nChildren's Hospital, London Health Science Centre.\nAfter obtaining approval from the institutional eth-\n18.58 years, were recruited into the study from the\nemergency department and large outpatient clinics\nincluding orthopedic surgery, cardiology, gastroen-\nterology, nephrology, endocrinology, neurology,\nneurosurgery, respirology, and others. All clinics\nwere invited to participate; however, some small\nclinics elected against participation because of\nunderstaffing. Between 60% (orthopedic surgery\nclinic) and 93% of patients or parents (emergency\ndepartment) agreed to participate in the study.\nPatients younger than 2 were not considered for\nthis study because of the lack of reference intervals\nto calculate BMI z scores. Eligible participants were\nall patients who gave informed consent. Patient\nenrollment commenced during a 9-month period\nenrolled. We were unable to enroll all patients since\nthe emergency department recruitment only occurred\nbetween noon and 8 pm every day. Excluded were\npatients for whom no consent was obtained or\nwho attended the clinics outside of recruitment\nhours. After obtaining written informed consent, a\nquestionnaire was filled out by the parents to deter-\nmine birth weight, duration of pregnancy, and\nmaternal prepregnancy height and weight. Random\nBP measurements using a standardized protocol\nwere taken at the clinic visits using automated\noscillometric BP machines (patient seated, calm,\nsecond of two measurements performed 5 minutes\napart with either Walch Allyn Spot Vital Signs LXi\n(Walch Allyn, Skaneateles Falls, NY) or Dinamap\nMonitor (Criticon, Tampa, FL). Anthropometric\nmeasurements (height, measured by stadiometers\n[Infant stadiometer from Perspection Enterprises,\nPortage, MI; otherwise Seca 242 mechanical per-\nsonal measuring rod, Hanover, MD]; weight mea-\nsured using a high-precision industrial scale at both\ninstitutions [Scale-Tronix scales 6002 for wheel-\nwise; Scale-Tronix, Wheaton, IL]) were obtained as\nclinical routine. BMI was calculated from the ratio\nof weight (kg) and the square of the height (cm).\nAge-independent BMI z scores were calculated\nusing the methodology provided by the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC) Web site\nwith age- and sex-matched controls taken from the\nNational Center for Health Statistics (United\nStates). We used the most recent National Health\nand Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III\nCenter for Health Statistics 2000 CDC Growth\nat http://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/]). We also\ncalculated height and weight z scores as well as\nBP z scores using the published Box-Cox\ntransformations.\nFor a subset of 658 patients born in London, we\nlinked data to an existing maternal fetal database to\ntest agreement between the reported and measured\nprepregnancy weight, height, and birth weight.\nTo study the effect of prepregnancy BMI and\nbirth weight, we classified the data according to the\nfollowing birth weight groups: birth weight <1500 g\n>4500 g (significantly elevated birth weight). Simi-\nlarly, we divided the prepregnancy BMI into\nthe following groups: <18.5 kg/m2 (underweight);\nTo study the effect of age after birth, we also divided\nthe patients into two age groups of younger than or\nolder than 8 years, as the effect of prematurity on\ncardiovascular risk factors has been described\nbeyond 8 years of life.\nStatistical analysis was performed with the\nGRAPHPAD PRISM version 4.02 for Windows\n(GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Contiguous\ndata were analyzed for normal distribution with\nthe Shapiro-Wilk normality test. Mean and stan-\ndard deviation were reported for normally distrib-\nuted data; otherwise, median and quartiles were\ngiven. Simple descriptive tests were employed, using\nappropriate parametric tests for normally distrib-\nuted data and nonparametric tests otherwise. Com-\nparison between groups was performed using\nstandard t test for normally distributed parameters\nand the Wilcoxon signed rank test otherwise. Asso-\nciations between variables (eg, date of presentation\nand BMI z score) were assessed with standard\nregression analysis. Multivariate regression analysis\nwas also performed to control for BMI z score\nwhen analyzing the relationship between BP z score\nand birth weight. Agreement between variables\nwas assessed using Bland & Altman analysis. A P\nvalue of <.05 was considered statistically signifi-\ncant. For the current study, we only included the\n3024 complete data sets of children older than\n2 years, therefore no adjustments were needed for\nmissing values.\nRESULTS\npatients were included into the study (1373 female,\n45.4%). Patients were from the emergency depart-\nendocrinology clinic (86), and other clinics (164).\nWe tested for agreement between the reported\nand measured parameters after linking with an\nexisting perinatal database in 658 cases. Spearman\nrank correlation between reported and actual\nprepregnancy BMI data revealed a strong positive\npregnancy BMI, with a median underestimation\nof 0.875% of the reported prepregnancy BMI\n(P<.0001). For the birth weight, Spearman rank\nteristics and appropriate z scores for all measure-\nments are summarized in Table I.\nInterestingly, we found no significant correlation\nbetween systolic BP z score and birth weight\nwas there a correlation with gestational age (r=.30,\nP=.098, Spearman rank correlation). Systolic BP z\nscore correlated with diastolic BP z score (r=.556,\nP<.0001, Spearman rank correlation), BMI z score\nSpearman rank correlation).\nWith regards to the diastolic BP z score, we\nfound a weak but significant positive correlation\npositive correlation with gestational age (r=.052,\nP=.005, Spearman rank correlation).

There was a significant positive corre-\nlation between birth weight and BP z scores (Pillai's\nFor the between-subjects effect, we found a signifi-\ncant correlation between birth weight and systolic\nBP z score (0.026) as well as with diastolic BP z\nscore (0.018). Due to the lack of a nonparametric\ntest, we used a general linear model (y=A+B * BMI\nz score+C * birth weight), where A, B, and C are\nconstants. We further considered two age groups:\n8 years (n=1742). Similar multivariate analysis was\napplied for the two age groups. Results found for\nthe younger group of patients indicated the pres-\nence of a significant positive correlation between\nbirth weight and BP z scores (Pillai's Trace, 0.000;\nRoy's Largest Root method, 0.000). For the\nbetween-subjects effect, the analysis demonstrated a\nsignificant correlation between birth weight and\nsystolic BP z score (0.001) as well as with diastolic\nBP z score (0.000). For the older group of patients,\nthere was no significant correlation between birth\nweight and BP z scores (Pillai's Trace, 0.064; Wilks\nLargest Root method, 0.057). We did not find a\nsignificant correlation between birth weight and\ning to the Barker hypothesis, BP should have corre-\nlated negatively with the birth weight.\nTo address the potential for a developmental lag\nfor the development of hypertension secondary to\nlow birth weight, we compared two age groups:\nyounger than 8 years and older than 8 years. The\nreason for choosing the cut-off of 8 years of age\nstems from studies in prematurely born children in\nwhom hypertension typically developed beyond the\n8th year of life. There was a significant difference\nin the systolic BP z score between both groups\n(adolescents median, 0.289; children younger than\ntest) as well as the diastolic BP z scores (adolescent\nthere was a significant difference between the\nmaternal prepregnancy BMI (median for adoles-\never, there was no correlation between birth weight\nand systolic BP z score in both groups (younger\nwhereas the diastolic BP z score correlated weakly\nbut positively in the younger group only (r=.079,\nP=.005, Spearman rank correlation).\nFinally, we tested BP z scores in relationship to\nvarious groups of birth weight and prepregnancy\nBMI as outlined in the methods, using the nonpara-\nmetric Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance test and\nfound significant differences in the BP z scores\namong the birth weight groups (Table II). Interest-\ningly, when repeating the analysis of systolic BP for\nthe subgroup of patients older than 8 years, there\nwas no significant difference in medians of these\ngroups (P=.1570). The same applied for the dia-\nstolic BP in the older group (P=.2139). By contrast,\nthere was a significant positive relationship between\nthe prepregnancy BMI and the systolic and diastolic\nBP (Table III). This suggests that offsprings of big\nmoms are a greater risk factor for childhood hyper-\ntension than small babies.\nDISCUSSION\nAccording to the Barker hypothesis, disturbed intra-\nuterine growth and low birth weight have a negative\ninfluence on the development of the cardiovascular\nsystem and favors the occurrence of hypertension in\nadult life. This hypothesis was not tested in children.\nThe current study attempts to fill this gap.\nNumerous large studies have recently confirmed\nthe relationship between low birth weight and raised\nBP, as recently elegantly reviewed by Do\nmechanism for the development of hypertension due\nto low birth weight has not been well defined, but\nmay include both renal16 and extrarenal mecha-\nnisms. Renal mechanisms may include the reduction\nof nephron number, which is encountered in patients\nand animals with low birth weight.17 According to\nthe so-called Brenner hypothesis, this may lead\nto increased arterial BP.18,19 Another important\nrenal mechanism is the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone\nsystem, which appears to be more active on a num-\nber of levels in persons with low birth weight.20\nInterestingly, we did not find any relationship\nbetween low birth weight and an elevated BP z score.\nThis was even true when analyzing older patients\nseparately.\nIt could be argued that the entire process of\nhyperfiltration as a consequence of reduced nephron\ndosing responsible for the development of hyperten-\nsion might take longer than the childhood to occur.\nClearly, young adults born with a very low birth\nweight have higher BP.21 The time effect, especially\nwhen aggravated by excessive weight gain, is well\nrecognized.22 To test this hypothesis, we chose a cut-\noff of 8 years because it has previously been shown\nthat low birth weight already affects BP at age 8.23\nSurprisingly, we found absolutely no negative corre-\nlation between birth weight and BP z score even in\nthe older patients analyzed separately, thereby ques-\ntioning the applicability of the Barker hypothesis to\nadolescents. It is important to point out that in utero\ngrowth restriction due to famine was responsible for\nthe increased rate of hypertension and cardiovascular\nmorbidity,1,2 but we currently rarely see famine but\nrather feast.\nToday, we witness an unprecedented obesity epi-\ndemic.5 Even within our study, we were able to\ndemonstrate increased obesity within a single dec-\nade: both BMI z scores for children older than 8\nand their mother's prepregnancy BMIs were signifi-\ncantly lower than the younger children. It is possi-\nble that being leaner confounded the effect of low\nbirth weight; however, in the multivariate models,\nthere was a positive correlation between birth\nweight and BMI z score. Matched with the results\npresented in Table III, this would suggest an\nadverse effect of high birth weight on future BP. It\nis impossible to derive from the data whether this\nis due to prenatal programming or the environment\nin which the child grows up.\nIn a study of 739 children from Brazil, children\nwith both a low and a high birth weight had higher\nBP when using covariance analysis.24 It was con-\ncluded that weight gain during childhood adds to\nthe risk. It appears that both famine and feast dur-\ning pregnancy are unfavorable for BP. In other\nwords, both small babies/tiny moms and big\nbabies/big moms are both a risk factor. In contrast\nto these findings, the data from the current study\nsuggest that a high prepregnancy BMI and a high\nbirth weight are the most important factors for\nhigher BP in childhood. The socioeconomical envi-\nronment in Canada and Brazil differ.\nOur data raise the question of whether child-\nhood hypertension could be the result of feast in\npregnancy. Prevention of hypertension might have\nTable II. Comparison Between Birth Weight Groups\nVariable\nAbbreviation: BMI, body mass index. a(25%, 75%). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) Kruskal\u00adWallis P value for systolic blood pressure (BP) z score =.0092 for diastolic blood\nto start before pregnancy.25 Prepregnancy BMI,\ninsulin resistance during pregnancy, and weight\ngain after birth are all potentially modifiable and\nmay well be the target to improve the overall car-\ndiovascular risk factors later in life.\nLimitations and Strengths\nAbout one third of patients were seen in the clinics\nfor chronic diseases. Certainly in the nephrology\nclinic, a patient selection toward hypertension may\nhave occurred. Furthermore, the inclusion of hospi-\ntal children could induce a potential bias from the\ndetrimental effect of chronic disease on the growth\nparameters.26\u00ad29 However, few datasets contain\nprepregnancy, pregnancy, and childhood informa-\ntion. Without all such time points, life course effects\nwill remain only partially understood.30 This study\nis unique in that it enlists the necessary information\nand is verified from an existing perinatal database.\nDespite expected growth retardation, height as well\nas BMI z scores in our study group were higher than\ntheir American counterparts. Particularly, the emer-\ngency department and orthopaedic clinic patients,\nwho reflect a more normal patient cohort, were\nparticularly taller than the NHANES III study group.\nA large study sample also enhances the validity of\nour observations. A mixed patient representation\nfrom different clinics minimizes a potential selection\nbias. Nonetheless, the sample taken from patients\nattending our hospital represents a bias with a pre-\ndominantly white patient clientele from a predomi-\nnantly blue-collar background. Unfortunately, we\ndid not collect ethnicity, socioeconomic background,\nor other descriptors of our patient cohort.\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur study suggests that the potentially modifiable\nfactor of BMI forms the single most important\ndeterminant for BP z score. In less than a decade,\nthe problem of high BMI z score is increasing, and\nfocusing on effective prevention and intervention is\na priority. It appears that a high pregnancy BMI\ncontributes to elevated BP. Targeting a healthy\nprepregnancy BMI also has to become a priority.\nThe effect of the unmodifiable risk factor of low\nbirth weight is of lesser importance. Our study sug-\ngests that big moms may be a more significant risk\nfactor for childhood hypertension than small babies.\nDisclosure: This study was funded by a grant to GF by the\nChildren's Health Foundation in London, ON, Canada.\nREFERENCES\n1 Eriksson J, Forsen T, Tuomilehto J, et al.
