Pain was evaluated with a visual analogue scale (VAS) before and at 1, 3, and 6 months\nafter TAESI. Health-related quality-of-life was evaluated using the Short Form 36 (SF-36)\nquestionnaire 6 months after TAESI.\nResults: There were no significant differences in VAS scores after TAESI between statin users\n(n \u00bc 40) and statin nonusers (n \u00bc 253). The SF-36 subgroup: role limitations due to emotional\nproblems score was significantly lower in statin users than statin nonusers. There were no\nsignificant between-group differences in any other SF-36 parameter.\nConclusion: Statin use had no effect on pain scores after TAESI.\n",

As well\nas their broad use as lipid-lowering drugs,\nstudies have found immunomodulatory and\nanti-inflammatory activities for statins, both\nin vivo and in vitro, which may be relevant to\ntheir therapeutic effects in neuroinflamma-\nhave been shown to alleviate neuropathic\npain in a rat model.14 The impact of statin\nuse on response to epidural steroid injections\nremains unknown, however.\nThe aim of the present study was to test\nthe hypothesis that statin use results in lower\npain scores (assessed using a visual analogue\nscale [VAS]) both before and after TAESI in\npatients with low back pain, compared with\nthose patients not taking statins. The effect\nof statin use health-related on quality-of-life\nwas also assessed.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nThis prospective, single blind study included\nall patients aged !18 years scheduled to\nundergo TAESI for low back pain at the\nDepartment of Algology, Adnan Menderes\nUniversity, Aydin, Turkey, between April\nTAESI included radicular pain, lumbar disc\nhernia, lumbar canal stenosis or failed back\nsurgery. Treatment was prescribed by a pain\nphysician who was blinded to the patient's\nstatin use (O.N.A.). Exclusion criteria were:\nprior TAESI; known allergy to steroids;\nindication for surgery; ongoing workers'\ncompensation claims; unstable opioid use;\npsychiatric disorders; drug or alcohol abuse\nwithin the previous 6 months; severe medical\nillness that could interfere with the inter-\npretation of study outcomes; myocardial\ninfarction within the previous 6 months;\npregnancy. Patients were stratified between\ntwo groups: statin users (20 mg atorvastatin\nfor !3 months) or statin nonusers.\nMorphometric and demographic data (age,\nsex, weight and height), statin type and\ndosage, duration of symptoms, surgical his-\ntory and a detailed history of low back pain\nwere recorded. A detailed pain history was\nobtained.\nThe study was approved by the\nInstitutional Review Board of Adnan\nMenderes University, Aydin, Turkey, and\nall patients provided written informed con-\nsent prior to enrolment.\nTAESI\nBefore TAESI, all patients provided a VAS\nscore (0 \u00bc no pain, 10 \u00bc most severe pain\npossible). Vascular access was established\nand a 0.9% isotonic sodium chloride drip\nwas set up. Patients were premedicated with\nmidazolam 0.02 mg/kg and fentanyl 1 mg/kg,\nplaced in the prone position on the fluoros-\ncopy table, and monitored for heart rate,\nblood pressure and oxygen saturation. The\nskin was cleaned with iodine-based antisep-\ntic solution and then covered, in line with the\nintstitute's standard sterilization protocol.\nAll procedures were carried out under local\nanaesthesia using C-arm fluoroscopic\nguidance.\nThe TAESI procedure was initiated by\nplacing the C-arm scope in anteroposterior\nposition to determine the intervention level.\nThe scope was then brought into an\nimage of the intervertebral foramina. The\nskin and subcutaneous region was infiltrated\nBraun, Melsungen, Germany) was guided\ninto the intervertebral foramen. When fron-\ntal, anterior and lateral images indicated\nthat the point of the needle was in the correct\nposition, 0.5\u00ad1 ml of contrast agent was\ninjected to verify the typical anterior epi-\ndural spread. The image was further verified\nwith anteroposterior and lateral projections.\nSubsequently, a mix of 80 mg triamcinolo-\nnacetonide (Sinokort A ampoule, 40 mg/ml,\n_\nI.e.ulagay ilac\n\u00b8 sanayi, _\nIstanbul) and 3 ml of\n0.5% bupivacaine (Bustesin, Vem ilac\n\u00b8\nsanayi, _\nIstanbul) was injected accompanied\nby negative aspiration. The total injection\nvolume was 4 ml if the procedure involved a\nsingle level, or 3 ml/level if more than one\nlevel was involved. The same pain physician,\nwho was blinded to the patient's statin use\n(O.N.A.) performed all the procedures.\nAfter the procedure, all patients were\nmonitored in the recovery room for 2 h\nbefore returning to the ward. Patients with\nno complications were discharged after 6 h\nand were followed-up after 2 weeks (routine\npostprocedure assessment). Pain scores\n(VAS) were assessed 1, 3 and 6 months\nafter TAESI. Health-related quality-of-life\nwas evaluated using Short Form 36 (SF-36)\n6 months after TAESI.\nStatistical analyses\nData were presented as mean \u00c6 SD.\nBetween-group comparisons were made\nusing Student's t-test with Bonferroni's cor-\nrection for multiple comparisons.

Demographic and clinical par-\nameters are shown in Table 1. There were no\nsignificant between-group differences in\ndemographic characteristics except age and\nduration of pain.

This may be due\nto the small number of patients in the statin\ngroup or the significant between-group differ-\nence in age.\nLong-term statin use is associated with\nperipheral neuropathy and myotoxicity.22,23\nMuscle symptoms are a principal reason for\nnonadherence and/or discontinuation, con-\ntributing to adverse cardiovascular out-\ncomes.24 These side-effects can also result\nin pain, and may be a possible explanation\nof the lower then expected pain relief effect\nseen in statin users in the present study.\nStatin-associated myopathy with elevated\nserum creatinine kinase (CK) is a rare but\nserious side-effect, affecting between 0.01\nand 0.1% of people taking standard statin\ndoses.24 Statin-associated muscle symptoms\ncover a broader range of clinical presenta-\ntions, usually with normal or minimally\nelevated CK levels, with a prevalence of\n7\u00ad29% in registries and observational stu-\ndies.24 Preclinical studies indicate that sta-\ntins decrease mitochondrial function,\nattenuate energy production, and alter\nmuscle protein degradation, thereby provid-\ning a potential link between statins and\nmuscle symptoms.24 Controlled mechanistic\nand genetic studies are necessary to further\nelucidate this effect, although none of the\npatients in the present study experienced any\nside-effects.\nNeuropathic pain adversely affects\nhealth-related quality-of-life, and reduces\nphysical and emotional function. The lack\nof a between group difference in health-\nrelated quality-of-life in our study may be\nrelated to the absence of long-term decreases\nin pain score. Alternatively, there may be\nunresolved secondary gains or other\nunknown factors.\nOur study has several limitations. The\nsample size was small and patients were not\nrandomized. Larger, randomized studies are\ntherefore required to confirm our findings.\nIn addition, the duration of statin use may\naffect the outcome, but this parameter was\nnot included in our study design.\nFurthermore, chronic pain has variable\nemotional and affective consequences that\nshould be addressed. Including SF-36\nassessment at the beginning of the study\nperiod as well as 6 months after TAESI\nwould have provided valuable additional\ninformation regarding the effect of the pro-\ncedure on health-related quality-of-life.\nIn conclusion, we found no significant\neffect of statin use on the efficacy of TAESI\nfor chronic low back pain. Randomized,\ndouble-blind, longitudinal studies with\nlarger sample sizes are required to confirm\nthis finding.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
