The causes of foodborne\nillness include viruses, bacteria, parasites,\ntoxins, metals, and prions, and the symptoms of\nfoodborne illness range from mild gastroenteritis\nto life-threatening neurologic, hepatic, and renal\nsyndromes. In the United States, foodborne\ndiseases have been estimated to cause 6 million\neach year (2-5). However, ongoing changes in the\nfood supply, the identification of new foodborne\ndiseases, and the availability of new surveillance\ndata have made these figures obsolete. New,\nmore accurate estimates are needed to guide\nprevention efforts and assess the effectiveness of\nfood safety regulations.\nSurveillance of foodborne illness is compli-\ncatedbyseveralfactors.Thefirstisunderreporting.\nAlthough foodborne illnesses can be severe or\neven fatal, milder cases are often not detected\nthrough routine surveillance. Second, many\npathogens transmitted through food are also\nspread through water or from person to person,\nthus obscuring the role of foodborne transmis-\nsion. Finally, some proportion of foodborne\nillness is caused by pathogens or agents that\nhave not yet been identified and thus cannot be\ndiagnosed. The importance of this final factor\ncannot be overstated. Many of the pathogens of\ngreatest concern today (e.g., Campylobacter jejuni,\nEscherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes,\nCyclospora cayetanensis) were not recognized as\ncauses of foodborne illness just 20 years ago.\nIn this article, we report new estimates of\nillnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths due to\nfoodborne diseases in the United States. To\nensure their validity, these estimates have been\nderived by using data from multiple sources,\nincluding the newly established Foodborne\nDiseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet).\nThe figures presented include estimates for\nspecific known pathogens, as well as overall\nestimates for all causes of foodborne illness,\nknown, unknown, infectious, and noninfectious.\nData Sources\nData sources for this analysis include the\nFoodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Net-\nwork (FoodNet) (6), the National Notifiable\nDisease Surveillance System (7), the Public\nHealth Laboratory Information System (8), the\nGulf Coast States Vibrio Surveillance System (9),\nthe Foodborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance\nSystem (10), the National Ambulatory Medical\nCare Survey (11), the National Hospital\nAmbulatory Medical Care Survey (12-14), the\nTo better quantify the impact of foodborne diseases on health in the United States,\nwe compiled and analyzed information from multiple surveillance systems and other\nsources. We estimate that foodborne diseases cause approximately 76 million\nhospitalizations, and 1,800 deaths. Three pathogens, Salmonella, Listeria, and\nToxoplasma, are responsible for 1,500 deaths each year, more than 75% of those\ncaused by known pathogens, while unknown agents account for the remaining 62\ndiseases appear to cause more illnesses but fewer deaths than previously estimated.\nEmerging Infectious Diseases Vol. 5, No. 5, SeptemberOctober 1999\n \nTable 1.

FoodNet\nconducts active surveillance for seven bacterial\nand two parasitic foodborne diseases within a\ndefined population of 20.5 million Americans (6).\nAdditional surveys conducted within the FoodNet\ncatchment area provide information on the\nfrequency of diarrhea in the general population,\nthe proportion of ill persons seeking care, and the\nfrequency of stool culturing by physicians and\nlaboratories for selected foodborne pathogens.\nThe National Notifiable Disease Surveillance\nSystem (7) and the Public Health Laboratory\nInformation System (8) collect passive national\nsurveillance data for a wide range of diseases\nreported by physicians and laboratories. The\nGulf Coast States Vibrio Surveillance System\ncollects reports of Vibrio infections from selected\nstates (9), and the Foodborne Disease Outbreak\nSurveillance System receives data from all states\non recognized foodborne illness outbreaks\n(defined as two or more cases of a similar illness\nresulting from ingestion of a common food) (10).\nAs components of the National Health Care\nSurvey, the National Ambulatory Medical Care\nSurvey and the National Hospital Ambulatory\nMedical Care Survey measure health care use in\nvarious clinical settings, including physician\noffices and hospital emergency and outpatient\ndepartments (11-14). These surveys collect\ninformation on patient characteristics, patient\nsymptoms or reasons for visit, provider diagnosis,\nand whether the patient was hospitalized. Up to\nthree symptoms are recorded using a standard\nclassification (17), and up to three provider\ndiagnoses are recorded according to the Interna-\ntional Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision,\nClinical Modifications (ICD-9-CM,18) (Table 1).\nThe National Hospital Discharge Survey,\nanother component of the National Health Care\nSurvey, is a representative annual sample of\ndischarge records from approximately 475\nnonfederal short-stay hospitals (15). The\ninformation collected includes up to seven\nprincipal discharge diagnoses classified by ICD-\n9-CM codes (18). Because these data include\ninformation on condition at discharge, they can\nbe used as a source of information on in-hospital\ndeaths. Additional information on food-related\ndeaths was obtained from the National Vital\nStatistics System, which collects death certifi-\ncate data on causes of death classified by 3- or 4-\nIn addition to information from these formal\nsurveillance systems, we used data from two\npublished population-based studies. The\nMichigan, with an emphasis on households with\nyoung children (19). Households were tele-\nphoned weekly to identify incident cases of self-\ndefined diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, or stomach\nupset. The Cleveland study was conducted\namong a selected group of 86 families followed\n \n \nrecorded occurrences of gastrointestinal ill-\nnesses and associated symptoms on a monthly\ntally sheet. Both studies also collected informa-\ntion on extraintestinal illnesses (e.g., respiratory\nillness). Other studies with similar designs were\nnot included in our analysis, either because they\nwere relatively small or because they did not\nprovide information on the desired endpoints.\nThe Study\nFood-Related Illness and Death from Known\nPathogens\nTotal Cases\nTo estimate the total number of foodborne\nillnesses caused by known pathogens, we\ndetermined the number of reported cases for\neach pathogen, adjusted the figures to account\nfor underreporting, and estimated the propor-\ntion of illnesses specifically attributable to\nfoodborne transmission. Although data from\nvarious periods were used, adjustments for\nchanges in population size had minimal effect on\nthe final estimates and were therefore omitted.\nCases may be reported in association with\ndocumented foodborne outbreaks, through\npassive surveillance systems (e.g., the National\nNotifiable Disease Surveillance System, the\nPublic Health Laboratory Information System),\nor through active surveillance systems (e.g.,\nFoodNet). Sporadic illness caused by some\npathogens (e.g., Bacillus cereus, Clostridium\nperfringens, Staphylococcus aureus) is not\nreportable through passive or active systems;\nhence, the only cases reported are those related\nto outbreaks. For these pathogens, we have\nassumed that if diagnosed sporadic cases were\nreported, the total number would be 10 times the\nnumber of outbreak-related cases. This multi-\nplier is based on experience with pathogens for\nwhich data are available on both sporadic and\noutbreak-associated cases (e.g., reported cases of\nSalmonella or Shigella, Table 2). For all\npathogens, the number of outbreak-related cases\nwas calculated as the average annual number of\nthe most recent years for which published\noutbreak data are available. For pathogens also\nunder passive surveillance, we used the average\nnumber of cases reported to CDC from 1992\nthrough 1997, and for pathogens under active\nsurveillance through FoodNet, we used the\naverage rate observed for the surveillance\nthe total 1997 U.S. population (with some\nmodification for E. coli O157:H7; Appendix).\nIrrespective of the surveillance system,\nmany cases of foodborne illness are not reported\nbecause the ill person does not seek medical care,\nthe health-care provider does not obtain a\nspecimen for diagnosis, the laboratory does not\nperform the necessary diagnostic test, or the\nillness or laboratory findings are not communi-\ncated to public health officials. Therefore, to\ncalculate the total number of illnesses caused by\neach pathogen, it is necessary to account for\nunderreporting, i.e., the difference between the\nnumber of reported cases and the number of\ncases that actually occur in the community. For\nSalmonella, a pathogen that typically causes\nnonbloody diarrhea, the degree of underreporting\nhas been estimated at ~38 fold (Voetsch,\nmanuscript in preparation) (21). For E. coli\nO157:H7, a pathogen that typically causes\nbloody diarrhea, the degree of underreporting\nhas been estimated at ~20 fold (22). Because\nsimilar information is not available for most\nother pathogens, we used a factor of 38 for\npathogens that cause primarily nonbloody\ndiarrhea (e.g., Salmonella, Campylobacter) and\n20 for pathogens that cause bloody diarrhea (e.g.,\nE. coli O157:H7, Shigella). For pathogens that\ntypically cause severe illness (i.e., Clostridium\nbotulinum, Listeria monocytogenes), we arbi-\ntrarily used a far lower multiplier of 2, on the\nassumption that most cases come to medical\nattention. Details of the calculations for each\nspecific pathogen and rationale are provided in\nthe Appendix. Where information from both\nactive and passive reporting was available, we\nused the figure from active surveillance when\nestimating the total number of cases.\nHaving estimated the number of cases caused\nby each pathogen, the final step was to estimate\nfor each the percentage of illness attributable to\nfoodborne transmission. The total number of\ncases was then multiplied by this percentage to\nderive the total number of illnesses attributable\nto foodborne transmission. The rationale for each\nestimate is presented in the Appendix; although\nprecise percentages are generally difficult to\njustify, in most instances there is ample support\nfor the approximate value used.\nResults are presented in Tables 2 and 3.\nKnown pathogens account for an estimated 38.6\nEmerging Infectious Diseases Vol. 5, No. 5, SeptemberOctober 1999\n \nTable 2.

Excluding illness caused by\nListeria, Toxoplasma, and hepatitis A virus (three\npathogens that typically cause nongastrointestinal\nillness), 38.3 million cases of acute gastroenteri-\ntis are caused by known pathogens, and 13.6\nmillion (36%) of these are attributable to foodborne\ntransmission. Among all illnesses attributable to\nfoodborne transmission, 30% are caused by\nbacteria, 3% by parasites, and 67% by viruses.\nHospitalizations\nTo estimate the number of hospitalizations\ndue to foodborne transmission, we calculated\nfor each pathogen the expected number of\nhospitalizations among reported cases by\n \n \nTable 3.

Not\nall illnesses resulting in hospitalization are\ndiagnosed or reported. Health-care providers\nmay not order the necessary diagnostic tests,\npatients may have already taken antibiotics that\ninterfere with diagnostic testing, or the condition\nleading to hospitalization may be a sequela that\ndevelops well after resolution of the actual\ninfection (e.g., Campylobacter-associated\nGuillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome). Therefore, to account\nfor underreporting, we doubled the number of\nhospitalizations among reported cases to derive\nfor each pathogen an estimate of the total\nnumber of hospitalizations. Finally, we multiplied\nthis figure by the proportion of infections\nattributable to foodborne transmission. Because\nof gaps in the available data, this approach\ncould not be used for some parasitic and viral\ndiseases (Appendix).\nOverall, the pathogens listed in Table 2 cause\ntransmission (Table 3). Excluding hospitaliza-\ntions for infection with Listeria, Toxoplasma,\nfor acute gastroenteritis are caused by known\nable to foodborne transmission. Overall, bacte-\nrial pathogens account for 60% of hospitaliza-\ntions attributable to foodborne transmission,\nparasites for 5%, and viruses for 34%.\nEmerging Infectious Diseases Vol. 5, No. 5, SeptemberOctober 1999\n \nDeaths\nLike illnesses and hospitalizations, deaths\nare also underreported. Precise information on\nfood-related deaths is especially difficult to\nobtain because pathogen-specific surveillance\nsystems rarely collect information on illness\noutcome, and outcome-specific surveillance\nsystems (e.g., death certificates) grossly under-\nreport many pathogen-specific conditions. To\nestimate the number of deaths due to bacterial\npathogens, we used the same approach described\nfor hospitalizations: first calculating the number\nof deaths among reported cases, then doubling\nthis figure to account for unreported deaths, and\nfinally multiplying by the percentage of\ninfections attributable to foodborne transmis-\nsion. As with hospitalization, this approach could\nnot be used for some parasitic and viral diseases.\nOverall, the specified pathogens cause an\nare attributable to foodborne transmission\n(Table 3).

Bacteria\naccount for 72% of deaths associated with\nfoodborne transmission, parasites for 21%, and\nviruses for 7%. Five pathogens account for over\n90% of estimated food-related deaths: Salmo-\nNorwalk-like viruses (7%), Campylobacter (5%),\nFood-Related Illness and Death from\nUnknown Pathogens\nSome proportion of gastrointestinal illness is\ncaused by foodborne agents not yet identified.\nThis conclusion is supported by well-documented\nfoodborne outbreaks of distinctive illness for\nwhich the causative agent remains unknown\n(e.g., Brainerd diarrhea) (26), by the large\npercentage of foodborne outbreaks reported to\nCDC for which no pathogen is identified (25), and\nby the large number of new foodborne pathogens\nidentified in recent years.\nTo estimate food-related illness and death\nfrom unknown pathogens, we used symptom-\nbased data to estimate the total number of acute\ngastrointestinal illnesses and then subtracted\nfrom this total the number of cases accounted for\nby known pathogens; this difference represents\nthe illness due to acute gastroenteritis of\nunknown etiology. To determine how much of\nthis illness was due to foodborne transmission,\nwe used the percentages of foodborne transmis-\nsion as determined above for acute gastroenteri-\ntis caused by known pathogens.\nTotal Cases\nTo determine the rate of acute gastroenteri-\ntis in the general population, we used data on the\nFoodNet population survey. This survey did not\ncollect data on the rate of vomiting among\npersons without diarrhea, however, so we relied\non the Tecumseh and Cleveland studies for\ninformation on the frequency of this symptom.\nBecause young children were overrepresented in\nthe Tecumseh and Cleveland studies relative to\nthe current U.S. population, rates of illness for\nthese studies were age-adjusted. For the\nTecumseh data, we used the reported age- and\nsymptom-specific rates. For the Cleveland study,\nwe used the method described by Garthright (27)\nto derive an overall age-adjusted rate of\ngastrointestinal illness; we then multiplied this\nrate by the relative frequency of symptoms to\nderive age-adjusted rates for specific symptoms.\nthe overall rate of diarrhea was 1.4 episodes per\nperson per year, and the rate of diarrheal illness,\ndefined as diarrhea (3 loose stools per 24-hour\nperiod) lasting >1 day or interfering with normal\nactivities, was 0.75 episodes per person per year\n(H. Herikstad, manuscript in preparation). We\nused the lower 0.75 rate for our analysis. To this\nwe added the average age-adjusted rate of\nvomiting without diarrhea from the Tecumseh\nand Cleveland studies (0.30, Table 4) to derive an\noverall estimate of 1.05 episodes per person per\nyear of acute gastrointestinal illness character-\nized by diarrhea, vomiting, or both.\nPrevious studies have shown that some cases\nof acute gastrointestinal illness are accompanied\nby respiratory symptoms; although the causes of\nthese illnesses are generally unknown, such\ncases have traditionally been attributed to\nrespiratory pathogens (20,27). Data on the\nfrequency of concomitant respiratory symptoms\nbut were 20% to 27% among patients with acute\ngastroenteritis in the Tecumseh and Cleveland\nstudies. Therefore, we adjusted downward our\nestimate of acute gastroenteritis by 25%,\n \n \nTable 4.

Extrapolated to a population of 267.7\nmillion persons, the U.S. resident population in\nepisodes each year in the United States.\nAs determined previously, 38.3 million of\nthese 211 million episodes of acute gastroenteri-\ntis are attributable to known pathogens. A small\nproportion of the remaining 173 million episodes\ncan be accounted for by known, noninfectious\nagents (e.g., mycotoxins, marine biotoxins);\nhowever, most are attributable to unknown\nagents. Because we cannot directly ascertain\nhow many of these illnesses of unknown etiology\nare due to foodborne transmission, we used the\nrelative frequency of foodborne transmission for\nknown pathogens as a guide. For illnesses of\nknown etiology, foodborne transmission ac-\ncounts for 36% of total cases. Applying this\npercentage yields an estimate of 62 million\ncases of acute gastroenteritis of unknown\ntransmission each year.\nHospitalizations\nThe National Ambulatory Medical Care\nSurvey/the National Hospital Ambulatory Medi-\ncal Care Survey data were searched for visits due\nto symptoms of diarrhea, vomiting, or gas-\ntrointestinal infection (reason for visit classifica-\nvisits resulting in a diagnosis of infectious\nVisits associated with respiratory symptoms\ninfluenza (ICD-9-CM code 487) were excluded.\nbefore analysis.

In addition, we included the nonspe-\ncific ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes 009 (infectious\ngastroenteritis) and 558.9 (other and unspecified\nnoninfectious gastroenteritis and colitis). De-\nspite the description, many of the illnesses\nbe either infectious or due to agents possibly\ntransmitted by food. For example, in the absence\nof laboratory testing, sporadic cases of viral\ngastroenteritis may be coded as 558.9. Under the\nprevious ICD-8 classification, these same cases\nwould have been assumed to be infectious and\n1996 were weighted according to National\nCenter for Health Statistics criteria and\naveraged to derive national estimates of annual\nhospitalizations.

Because these data depend on the\nrecording of a diagnosis and not just a symptom,\nit is likely that they underestimate the rate of\nhospitalization for acute gastroenteritis.

While technological advances\nsuch as pasteurization and proper canning have\nall but eliminated some disease, new causes of\nfoodborne illness have been identified. Research-\ners have used various methods to estimate the\nillnesses and deaths due to foodborne diseases in\nthe United States. In 1985, Archer and Kvenberg\ncoupled information on underreporting of\nsalmonellosis with data on other foodborne\npathogens to derive estimates of 8.9 million\nillnesses due to known pathogens and 24 million\nto 81 million illnesses due to all foodborne agents\nTable 5.

Estimated frequency of foodborne illness in the United States.\nfigures for all known infectious diseases and\ndetermined the proportion of each due to various\nmodes of transmission. Summing these figures,\nthey concluded that foodborne transmission of\nknown pathogens caused 6.5 million illnesses\nTodd used a combination of methods, including\nextrapolation from Canadian surveillance data,\nto derive an estimate of 12.5 million foodborne\nillnesses and 522 related deaths each year (4).\nFinally, in 1994, a task force convened by the\nCouncil for Agricultural Science and Technology\n(CAST) reviewed available studies and esti-\nmated the overall number of food-related\nillnesses at 33 million cases per year (5). These\nvarious estimates often refer to different entities.\nThe estimates of 6.5 million and 8.9 million refer\nto illness caused by known pathogens, whereas\nthe estimate of 33 million refers to all causes of\nfoodborne illnesses, known and unknown,\ninfectious and noninfectious.\nOur estimates are based on data from a wide\nvariety of sources and differ from previous\nestimates in several respects. For known\npathogens, our estimate of 13.8 million illnesses\nper year is substantially higher than the\nprevious estimates of 6.5 million and 8.9 million\n(2, 3), an increase attributable largely to our\ninclusion of foodborne illness caused by\nNorwalk-like viruses. For foodborne illness of all\netiologies, our estimate of 76 million illnesses is\nwithin the range proposed by Archer and\nKvenberg (2) but considerably higher than the\npoint estimate of 33 million presented in the\nCAST report (5). Both our estimate and the\nCAST estimate assume that foodborne transmis-\nsion accounts for ~35% of acute gastroenteritis\ncases caused by unknown agents. The disparity\nbetween the two stems from differences in the\nestimated annual frequency of acute gastroen-\nteritis overall: 211 million cases for our estimate,\n99 million for the CAST estimate.\nWhereas our estimates of illness are\ngenerally higher than those of previous studies,\nour estimates of death are generally lower. We\nestimate that foodborne illness causes 5,020\nEmerging Infectious Diseases Vol. 5, No. 5, SeptemberOctober 1999\n \ndeaths annually (1,810 deaths due to known\npathogens and 3,210 deaths due to unknown\nagents), a total that is slightly more than half the\nBennett estimate includes 2,100 deaths due to\ncampylobacteriosis, 1,200 deaths due to staphy-\nlococcal food poisoning, and 1,000 deaths due to\ntrichinosis: our total for all three of these\ndiseases is 101 deaths. Our estimated case-\nfatality rates for several other diseases are also\nlower than those used in the Bennett report,\neither because better data are available or\nperhaps because treatment has improved.\nOur analysis suggests that unknown agents\naccount for approximately 81% of foodborne\nillnesses and hospitalizations and 64% of deaths.\nAmong cases of foodborne illness due to known\nagents, Norwalk-like viruses account for over\nof deaths. The assumptions underlying the\nNorwalk-like viruses figures are among the most\ndifficult to verify, and these percentages should\nbe interpreted with caution (Appendix). Other\nimportant causes of severe illness are Salmo-\nnella and Campylobacter, accounting for 26%\nand 17% of hospitalizations, respectively. The\nleading causes of death are Salmonella, Listeria,\nand Toxoplasma, which together account for\ncaused by known pathogens. Many of the deaths\ndue to toxoplasmosis occur in HIV-infected\npatients; recent advances in HIV treatment may\ngreatly reduce deaths due to toxoplasmosis.\nOf necessity, our analysis entails a number of\nassumptions. The first major assumption\nconcerns the degree of underreporting. Well-\ndocumented estimates of underreporting are not\navailable for most pathogens; therefore, we\nrelied on multipliers derived for salmonellosis\nand other diseases. For salmonellosis, the\nmultiplier of 38 has been independently derived\nby investigators in the United States using\ndifferent data sources. The U.S. figure is five to\ntenfold higher than multipliers for Salmonella\nand Campylobacter recently derived in Great\nBritain (31). However, this difference is nearly or\nwholly offset by far higher per capita rates of\nreported infections in Great Britain. Neverthe-\nless, when extrapolated to other pathogens,\nthese multipliers may result in under- or\noverestimates, and clearly studies such as those\nconducted for Salmonella are needed to develop\nbetter multipliers for these other diseases.\nHowever, in our analysis, changing the\nmultipliers for individual diseases has a minimal\neffect on the overall estimate of foodborne illness.\nOur second set of assumptions concerns the\nfrequency of foodborne transmission for indi-\nvidual pathogens. We have used published\nstudies when available, but these are rare. As\nwith underreporting multipliers, errors affect\nestimates for individual pathogens but have\nminimal effect on the estimate of overall illness\nand death from foodborne diseases. The one\nnotable exception is the estimate for Norwalk-\nlike viruses. Because these viruses account for\nan especially large number of illnesses, changes\nin the percentage attributed to foodborne\ntransmission have a major effect on our overall\nestimates. For example, if the actual number of\ninfections due to foodborne transmission were\n30% rather than 40%, the overall estimate would\ndecrease from 76 million to 63 million illnesses\nper year. Interestingly, our overall estimate is\ninfluenced far less by the Norwalk-like virus case\nestimate itself. It would require a 100-fold\nreduction in the estimated number of Norwalk-\nlike virus cases to reduce the overall estimate\nA third assumption concerns the frequency\nof acute gastroenteritis in the general popula-\ntion. The rate we used is based in part on recent\ndata from the FoodNet population survey, a\nretrospective survey involving more than 9,000\nhouseholds. The overall rate of diarrhea as\nrecorded by the survey was 1.4 episodes per\nperson per year; however, we used the surveys\nfar lower rate of 0.75 episodes of diarrheal illness\nper person per year. Furthermore, we limited\nour definition of acute gastroenteritis to\nsymptoms of diarrhea or vomiting and reduced\nthe rate to account for concomitant respiratory\nsymptoms. As a result, our final assumed rate of\n0.79 episodes of acute gastroenteritis per person\nper year is very similar to respiratory-adjusted\nestimates derived from the prospectively\nstudies (27). All three studies are based on\nhousehold surveys, and thus the rates of illness\nare not influenced by changes in health-care\ndelivery. Compared with rates of diarrheal\nillness from studies conducted in Great Britain,\nour estimated rate is higher than in one recent\nIn addition to these assumptions, our\nanalysis has several limitations. Differences in\n \n \navailable surveillance information prevented us\nfrom using the same method to estimate illness\nand death from bacterial, parasitic, and viral\npathogens. Furthermore, because of a paucity of\nsurveillance information, we did not include\nspecific estimates for some known, occasionally\nfoodborne pathogens (e.g., Plesiomonas,\nAeromonas, or Edwardsiella), nor did we develop\nspecific estimates for known noninfectious\nagents, such as mushroom or marine biotoxins,\nmetals, and other inorganic toxins. However,\nmany of these agents cause gastroenteritis and\nare therefore captured in our overall estimate of\nfoodborne illness. With the exception of a few\nimportant pathogens (Appendix), we have not\nestimated the number of cases of chronic\nsequelae, although these may be part of the\noverall burden of foodborne diseases. Finally,\nfuture research will refine our assumptions and\nallow for more precise estimates.\nMethodologic differences between our analy-\nsis and previously published studies make it\ndifficult to draw firm conclusions regarding\noverall trends in the incidence of foodborne\nillness. In general, the differences between our\nestimates and previously published figures\nappear to be due primarily to the availability of\nbetter information and new analyses rather than\nreal changes in disease frequency over time. For\nexample, E. coli O157:H7 was estimated to cause\nstudies of patients visiting a physician for\ndiarrhea. Recent FoodNet data have allowed a\nmore detailed estimation of mild illnesses not\nresulting in physician consultation. Our esti-\nincorporates these milder illnesses and should\nnot be misconstrued as demonstrating a recent\nincrease in E. coli O157:H7 infections. Whatever\nthe limitations on retrospective comparisons, the\nestimates presented here provide a more reliable\nbenchmark with which to judge the effectiveness\nof ongoing and future prevention efforts.\nFurther refinements of foodborne disease\nestimates will require continued and improved\nactive surveillance. Beginning in 1998, the\nFoodNet population survey was modified to\ncapture cases of vomiting not associated with\ndiarrhea; further enhancement to capture\nconcomitant respiratory symptoms should refine\nthe FoodNet survey data. Expansion of\nlaboratory diagnostic capacity could lead to\nbetter detection of certain pathogens, estimates\nof the degree of underreporting for additional\ndiseases, and estimates of the proportion of\nspecific diseases transmitted through food.\nHeightened surveillance for acute, noninfectious\nfoodborne diseases, such as mushroom poisoning\nand other illnesses caused by biotoxins, could\nfurther improve estimates of illness and death\nfrom foodborne illness. Emergency department-\nbased surveillance systems (33) or poison control\ncenter-based surveillance might provide such\ninformation. Finally, identifying new causes of\nenteric illness and defining the public health\nimportance of known agents (e.g., enteroaggre-\ngative E. coli) would improve foodborne disease\nprevention efforts.\nAppendix\nMethods, assumptions, and references for pathogen-specific\nestimates\nBacterial Pathogens\nPathogen: Bacillus cereus\nReported cases: Cases not routinely reported.

Although little is\nknown about the incidence of these infections in the United\nStates, these pathogens have been linked to both outbreaks\nand sporadic illnesses. Limited studies suggest that the\nimportance of some of these organisms in the United States is\nseriously underestimated (see Nataro and Kaper [49]).\nAlthough clearly a heterogeneous collection of organisms, we\nassume that these pathogens as a group have similar modes of\ntransmission and mortality rates as ETEC.\nPathogen: Listeria monocytogenes\nand comparable sentinel site surveillance (51), extrapolated\nTotal cases: Because it is a severe illness, assumed to be 2\ntimes the number of reported cases.\nHospitalization rate: Based on hospitalization rate for\nunpub. data).\nPercent foodborne: Although foodborne transmission\naccounts for all reported domestic outbreaks (52), the\npotential for nosocomial transmission has been demonstrated\nComments: Figures include both perinatal and nonperinatal\ndisease.

Active surveillance estimate based on extrapolation of the\nTotal cases: Published studies suggest that ~2% of all stools\ntested for Cryptosporidium are positive (68, 69). We assume\nthis rate of infection applies to all patients visiting a health-\ncare provider for acute gastroenteritis. Using an estimate of\n~15 million physician visits for diarrhea each year (see text),\ncryptosporidiosis per year.

Assumed to be no more\nthan 10 deaths annually.\nPercent foodborne: Assumed to be 10%. Recreational water\nis probably the major source of transmission (76-78); however,\nseveral foodborne outbreaks have been reported (79,80).\nPathogen: Toxoplasma gondii\nReported cases: Not routinely reported.\n \n \nTotal cases: Based on national serologic data collected\nyears old are seropositive for toxoplasmosis (CDC, unpub.\ndata). Assuming equal rates of infection over time, at least\n0.6% of the population experiences an acute infection each\nyear. Approximately 15% of infections are symptomatic.\nHospitalization rate: Varies widely according to host\nimmune status. Data from NHDS indicate that from 1992 to\n1996, toxoplasmosis was the first listed diagnosis for\napproximately 5,000 hospital discharges each year. We have\nused this figure as a conservative estimate of the number of\nactual hospitalizations.\nCase-fatality rate: Varies widely according to host immune\nstatus. Of the approximately 5,000 hospital discharges\nannually for which toxoplasmosis is the first listed diagnosis,\napproximately 750 involve a deceased patient. We have used\nthis figure as a conservative estimate of the number of actual\ndeaths.\nPercent foodborne: Although the proportion associated\nwith eating contaminated food varies by geographic region,\nwe assume an overall average of 50%. Recent unpublished\ndata from Europe suggest that 60% of acute infections are\nfrom contaminated food (Ruth Gilbert, pers. comm.).\nComment: Typically, infection with Toxoplasma gondii\nproduces an asymptomatic illness or a mild viral-like febrile\nillness with lymphadenopathy. Acute diarrhea is not\ncommonly associated with acute infection. Estimates from\nthe Massachusetts Department of Health suggest that one\ncase of congenital toxoplasmosis occurs for every 10,000\nUnited States, an estimated 400 children are born with\ncongenital toxoplasmosis. Based on calculations by investiga-\ntors from Stanford University, each year approximately 6,000\nwomen who experience an acute infection during pregnancy\nand who do not receive treatment give birth to a child with\ncongenital toxoplasmosis, which results in chronic sequelae\n(82).

In 10% to 20% of cases\nneurologic or cardiac symptoms develop, many severe and\npotentially leading to chronic illness.\nViral Pathogens\nPathogen: Rotavirus\nReported cases: Not routinely reported.\nTotal cases: Because every child has at least one\nsymptomatic infection (84-86), the number of cases is\nCase-fatality rate: Very low: 20 to 40 deaths per year (89).\nPercent foodborne: probably very low (<1%) (90).\nPathogen: Astrovirus\nReported cases: Not routinely reported.\nTotal cases: Because every child has at least one\nsymptomatic infection, the number of cases is assumed to\nHospitalizations: Assumed to equal 25% of number of\nCase-fatality rate: Very low (<10 deaths per year).\nPercent foodborne: Probably very low (<1%) (91).\nPathogen: Norwalk-like viruses (NLV).\nReported cases: Not routinely reported.\nTotal cases: Very few data are available for assessing the\ndisease burden associated with Norwalk-like viruses, and\nvery few studies have been conducted using the most\nsensitive diagnostics for NLVs. One community-based study\nfrom the Netherlands found 17% of cases of acute\ngastroenteritis were associated with Norwalk-like viruses,\ncompared with 6% of controls, using reverse transcriptase\npolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for detection of NLVs\n(92). An Australian study detected NLVs in 15% of\nhospitalized patients using immune electron microscopy (93).\nStudies have generally been conducted exclusively among\nyoung children or used less sensitive detection methods\n(electron microscopy); in these studies, NLVs have been\nrecent study incorporating RT-PCR for viral detection among\nchildren 2 months to 2 years of age found that 21% of cases of\nacute gastroenteritis were associated with NLVs (99). Given\nthese data, we assume that 11% of all episodes of acute\nprimary gastroenteritis are due to NLVs (using the data from\nthe best of the studies) (92).\nHospitalizations: NLV assumed to account for 11% of\nCase-fatality rate: Low. NLV assumed to account for 11% of\nan estimated 2,800 fatal cases of viral gastroenteritis each\nPercent foodborne: We assume that the proportion of all\nNLV-associated illness that is foodborne is 40%. This\nestimate is based on a recent report which found that 47% of\nNLV-associated acute gastroenteritis outbreaks in the\nUnited States in which the modes of transmission were\nknown were foodborne (101). Since we would assume that\nfoodborne-associated outbreaks might be more likley to be\nreported than Norwalk-like virus-associated outbreaks with\nother mechanisms of spread, the proportion was lowered to\n40%. This estimate is in general agreement with other\nreviews (102-104). No data are available to directly determine\nthe proportion of cases of NLV-associated disease attribut-\nable to foodborne transmission.\nPathogen: Hepatitis A\nEmerging Infectious Diseases Vol. 5, No. 5, SeptemberOctober 1999\n \nTotal cases: Assumed to be three times the number of\nHospitalizations: Thirteen percent; based on data from\nCDC Sentinel Counties Studies (106);\nCase-fatality rate: 0.3%; based on data from the viral\nHepatitis Surveillance Program and the CDC Sentinel\nthe case-fatality rate to reported cases.\nPercent foodborne: Foodborne transmission accounts for\napproximately 5% of outbreaks of known source (105). Note\nthat the source is not determined in approximately 50% of\nhepatitis A outbreaks, and foodborne transmission could\naccount for a far higher percentage of cases.\n"
