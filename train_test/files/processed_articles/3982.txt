    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe term anti-Americanism has become common in public and academic debate in the last decade. Yet we have only limited\n(EU) respondents disapproved of U.S. policy in all five dimensions the surveys examined. Following the literature, this consistent\nopposition is defined as anti-American. Anti-Americans exhibit systematic differences in age, education, geographical location,\npolicy preferences, and nationality. In addition, although anti-Americanism is associated with a preference for greater\nEuropean independence, perhaps surprisingly, it is also linked to a desire for a less federal and hence less powerful Europe. In\nboth sets of attitudes, to the United States and to the EU, there are substantial variations within countries between different\ntypes of locality, which reinforces the view that it is too simplistic to describe a country as being anti-American or being\npro-European integration.\n",

W. Bush and especially\nafter 9/11, it seemed to some that the United States adopted\nradically changed attitudes to its allies and to its enemies.\nAllies were to be led, not accommodated, and alliances were\nto be temporary and purpose-specific. Enemies might be\nattacked preemptively, and their regimes changed, and if\npossible democratized in an American approved style. The\nUnited States exhibited a new isolationism of perspective\nalong with a wider, more vigorous projection of its power\nUnsurprisingly, this apparent major change created a\nEuropean crisis of trust, which is now discussed openly by\npoliticians, commentators, and scholars. We want to examine\nsome solid data that could help us determine the strength of\nEuropean citizens'views of the United States at this apparent\npoint of change, and to allow an analysis of their different\ndimensions, and the characteristics of those who held them.\nIn particular, we want to explore whether opposition to\nAmerican policies was accompanied by a desire for a more\nintegrated and powerful European Union (EU), one that\nmight become a countervailing economic and political power\nto the United States. This leads us to try to link--at least\nempirically--two hitherto largely separate literatures: that\non anti-Americanism with that on attitudes toward EU\nintegration.\nThe data are drawn from three Eurobarometer surveys for\nthe European Commission: those of March-April 2003,\n2006 survey is the most recent available that includes the\n2003 survey's questions on EU respondents' attitudes to\nAmerican policy. For the 2003 survey, during whose collec-\ntion period, the Iraq War began, some 23,000 citizens in the\nthen 15-member union were questioned, using face-to-face\nhome interviews in their national language. In the 2005 and\nEU were surveyed.1 The sample frame was those aged 15\nand above, but we want to study the views of those who\ncould influence policy, that is voters, so we analyze respon-\ndents aged 18 and above. The surveys' multi-stage random\nprobability design ensures a representative sample with\nrespect to metropolitan, urban, and rural areas.

Lawson1,2 and John Hudson1\n Keywords\nanti-Americanism, European Union, federalism, regionalism, anti-capitalism\n2 SAGE Open\ninterviewee, the data included age, sex, educational level,\nincome, and nationality, plus some attitudinal variables.\nWe focus on the EU electors' answers to two sets of\nquestions:\n1. Whether the respondent felt the United States played\na positive, negative, or neither a positive nor negative\nrole in (a) the search for world peace, (b) the fight\nagainst terrorism, (c) the fight against world poverty,\n(d) the protection of the world environment, and (e)\nworld economic growth. We are less interested in the\nresponses to any specific question than in the totality\nof such responses. In particular, building on Berman\n(2004), we define an anti-American mind-set as one\nthat consistently disapproves of U.S. policies across a\nrange of different policy dimensions.\n2. Whether the respondent felt that independent EU\ndefence, security and foreign policies were desirable.\nWe look for possible links between respondents`\nanswers to these questions and their views on U.S.\nforeign policy.\nWe aim to answer three basic questions:\nResearch Question 1: Is there clear evidence of the exis-\ntence of anti-Americanism as we define it?\nResearch Question 2: Is anti-Americanism random, or is\nit linked to certain personal characteristics, for example,\nnationality, level of education, or residence in a particular\npart of a country?\nResearch Question 3: Do those with anti-American\nviews also share an identifiably similar set of opinions on\neither the foreign or security policies of the EU or its\nfuture political development?\nThe \"Literature Review\" section of this article discusses the\ndefinition of anti-Americanism and surveys the literature. It\nalso reviews the literature on voters' attitudes to European\nIntegration. The \"Attitude Determination\" section provides the\njustification for the model of attitude determination that under-\nlies the empirics. The \"Data and Analysis\" section gives the\nresults, and the \"Conclusion\" summarizes our conclusions.\nLiterature Review\nHere, we define anti-Americanism and review the existing\nliterature on its extent and causes.\nDefining Anti-Americanism\nAs O'Connor (2012) observes, this term has been widely and\nsometimes loosely used. What is needed is a definition that\ncorresponds to observable phenomena. For example, Spiro\n(1988) defines anti-Americanism as \"a persistent pattern of\ngross criticism of the main values of the US Constitution\" (p.\n120). This is both too vague, for the values need to be defined,\nand too specific. For example, why is it confined to the\nConstitution?\nAlternatively, Krastev (2004) defines anti-Americanism\nas \"opposing any policy simply because it is endorsed by the\nUS government\" (pp. 6-7). This is an appealing definition,\nbecause it incorporates a significant theoretical distinction\nbetween opposition based on the effects of American policy\nand opposition to the policy because it isAmerican. However,\nEurobarometer data do not allow us to establish why voters\nhave specific views. Other definitions include \"any hostile\nact or expression that becomes part and parcel of an undif-\nferentiated attack on the foreign policy, society, culture and\nvalues of the United States\" (Rubinstein & Smith, 1988,\np.36) and \"a psychological tendency to hold negative views\nof the United States and of American society in general\"\nBerman (2004) provides a more tractable definition that\nfocuses on opposition to specific American policies, or\ngroups of policies. This allows a search for clusters of oppo-\nsition, across policies, countries, or respondents, without\nprejudging their cause. Such a definition is value neutral and\noperational. Blaydes and Linzer (2012) empiricalize this by\naveraging the normalized responses to seven questions relat-\ning to whether people had favorable views of the United\nStates and Americans, attitudes to the spread of American\ncustoms, American ideas about democracy, ways of doing\nbusiness culture, and scientific advances. Chiozza (2009a)\nalso defines anti-Americanism as an attitude and a political\nbelief that can be measured through the answers individuals\ngive to survey questions.\nWe think it is worth extending the range of opinions that\nare used to assess the pattern of anti-Americanism, by\nincluding policy effects as well as policies. We also narrow\nour focus onto those who hold consistently negative views\nof U.S. policies or of their effects. Our measure of anti-\nAmericanism is similar to that of Blaydes and Linzer\n(2012) in being based on several different responses. But\nunlike theirs, it is not a continuous variable but a binomial\none based on those who consistently have a negative opin-\nion of the United States. We extend the range to both poli-\ncies and policy effects, because it is not clear that\nrespondents distinguish between them, and Eurobarometer\nquestions involve both. We confine our description of anti-\nAmerican to those who have consistently negative views in\nall five of the examined U.S. policy dimensions because\nwe want to explore links with their views on the EU.\nOpposition to an individual policy could arise for a myriad\nof reasons, and have little or no linkage to common con-\ncepts of anti-Americanism. In addition, if there is nothing\nunusual in our narrowly defined anti-American group's\npattern of views on the EU, then in the survey data, there\nare likely to be few interesting links between the wider\ngroup of European voters' views of the United States and\ntheir views on the future of the EU.\nLawson and Hudson 3\nThe Literature on Attitudes Toward the United\nStates and Its Policies\nOpinion poll evidence for European anti-American views in\nthe early years of this century, summarized by Linn (2004),\nrevealed a growing negative view of the United States,\nthough with marked differences across European states, and\nmore positive views in recent EU members. Kohut (2003)\nWhere 78% of Germans said they had a favorable view of the\nU.S. That fell to 61% in our (Pew Research Center) 2002 poll--\nand to 45% in the survey conducted (in spring 2003). Opinion of\nthe U.S. in France has followed a similar track: 62% positive in\nHowever, according to both Linn and Kohut, although EU\npublic opinion has changed, the U.S.\u00adEU \"value divide\" is\nnot widening. Linn (2004) defines \"basic values\" as \"views\nregarding fundamental, life and death issues that are embed-\nded in traditional culture and do not vary quickly or signifi-\ncantly over time\" (p. 13). Such values might be the roles of\nthe individual and the state, belief in God, or the necessary\nconditions for a just war. These he contrasts with \"`public\nopinion' [which although it] refers to views and perceptions\nmainly on matters of current politics or events . . . \" can and\ngenerally does \"also cover and reflect basic values\" (Linn,\n2004, p.13). These authors believe that the recent growth in\nanti-Americanism reflects changing European public opin-\nion rather than a basic value change.\nHowever, even if there has been no profound change in\nEuropean values, some American commentators have taken\na very combative line. For example, Ceaser (2003) claims\nthat anti-Americanism in Europe influenced Islamic terror-\nists. He traces anti-Americanism back to the 18th-century\nbiological degeneracy thesis that all species, including\nhuman beings, thrived less well in the New World. By the\nlate-18th century, this then dominant view also appeared in a\npolitical variant that asserted the inferiority of the American\npolitical system because it was not grounded in tradition. For\nCeaser, anti-Americanism\n. . . is a construct of European thought . . . anti-Americanism\nmakes rational discussion impossible, it threatens the idea of a\ncommunity of interests between Europe and America. Indeed it\nthreatens the idea of the West itself. (p. 16)\nOne does not have to accept Ceaser's extreme account to\nagree that the United States's power, and hence its pervasive\ninfluence, has created the preconditions for distrust of its\nmotives. The U.S. response to 9/11, and especially the inva-\nsion of Iraq, produced widespread European opposition. The\nmore radical criticism went beyond policy disagreement and\npurported to examine alleged flaws in the American psyche\nthat led to the violent and intimidating behavior that, some\nargued, has marked America since its inception (Sardar &\nA common view in the literature argues that attitudes to\nthe United States are strongly influenced by views of\nAmerican leaders and what they do, but also by views of the\nclaims that non-Americans can and do distinguish between\n\"what America is\" and \"what America does\" (Keohane &\nKatzenstein, 2007a, p. 2). The latter argue that because\nAmerica encompasses a very wide range of values and life-\nstyles, it provides foreigners with many reasons for attraction\nand repulsion. This helps explain the phenomenon of those\nwho may oppose its foreign policy but still wish to work\nthere.\nThe degree of distrust of America varies across European\ncountries, most plausibly because of past contacts. However,\nopinions are constantly evolving. Germany and France pro-\nvide two examples. Although relatively pro-American,\nGermans have recently become more distrustful. Berman\n. . . there is a specific German continuity from pre-1989\nCommunist anti-Americanism to post-Communist anti-\nAmericanism, which has been particularly relevant, given the\nrole of the former Communist Party--the Party of Democratic\nSocialism (PDS)--and its ability to influence the larger German\npolitical landscape. (p.29)\nOther influences he cites are the\n. . . association of Americans with \"capitalism in a negative\nsense\"; a \" . . . pre-democratic anti-Americanism (that) finds\nexpression in contempt for aspects of American mass culture,\"\nand \"a post-democratic anti-Americanism . . . driven by\nresentment that the United States has been unwilling to cede\nsovereignty to the structures of international governance.\"\nHowever, French opinion is arguably the most anti-Amer-\nican. Meunier (2005) argues that \" . . . France is the country\nwith the deepest, most sedimented reservoir of Anti-\nmentator sympathetic to the United States, argued that after\nits critical help to the United States in the War of\nIndependence, France looked in vain for a \"special relation-\nship\" with the new state. Instead, relations were punctuated\nby intermittent tensions. For example, France interpreted the\n1898American attack on the Spanish empire in the Caribbean\nand the Philippines as a threat to all European empires. The\nUnited States did not forgive France its First World War\ndebts. Roosevelt initially favored Vichy over the Free French\nand wanted a retributive postwar military government for\nFrance. But even such an unpromising legacy cannot explain\nthe severity of some criticisms. Toinet's explanation is that\nFrench commentators see a clash between the ideals of\nFrench civilization and American advocacy of its view of\ndemocracy. For the commentators, American democracy has\nled to and entails an unacceptably rapacious and uncaring\n4 SAGE Open\nIt is possible to construct a systematic and wide-ranging\nexplanation of anti-Americanism by focusing on its origins\nin domestic European politics. For example, Fabbrini (2002)\nnotes that \" . . . in (continental) Europe, anti-Americanism\nseems to be one of the few public philosophies that can unite\nlarge sections of the left, the right and the Catholic Church\"\n(p. 3). He argues that there are clear, though different, rea-\nsons why these diverse movements should exhibit this phi-\nlosophy. On the left is the legacy of the Cold War, former\ncommunist parties explicitly opposed to the United States,\nand socialist parties opposed to the perceived excesses of\nAmerican capitalism. On the right are parties that are dis-\ntrustful of American liberalism, individualism, and anti-\npaternalism. The Catholic Church's skepticism he argues\noriginates in the key role of protestant sects in American reli-\ngious life, the separation of Church and State in theAmerican\nconstitution, and the individualism that lies at the heart of\nAmerican identity. Despite this, the evidence presented in,\nfor example, Keohane and Katzenstein (2007b) shows little\nevidence of any consequences of anti-Americanism on the\nUnited States itself.\nIn terms of specific empirical econometric analysis,\nChiozza's (2009a) analysis of people across the world is of\nparticular importance. He shows that variation in anti-Ameri-\ncan sentiment is explained more at the individual level rather\nthan at the level of the country. He also finds that no single\nvariable is of primary importance in explaining anti-Ameri-\ncanism and that the impact of socio-economic characteristics\nvaries in different parts of the world. Finally, he shows that\nanti-Americanism, except perhaps in some Islamic countries,\nis not an entrenched philosophy around the world. Blaydes\nand Linzer (2012) in their study of anti-Americanism in the\nIslamic world link anti-Americanism to both individual socio-\neconomic characteristics and country-level variables.\nThe Literature on Citizens' Attitudes to European\nIntegration\nHaas (1961) argues that European co-operation would lead,\nthrough a \"spillover\" mechanism, to unintended conse-\nquences that would eventually lead to firms, governments,\npolitical parties, and citizens to orient their expectations and\npolitical behavior toward the EU. Moreover, the citizens of\nEuropean countries would gradually come to view \"Europe\"\nas the natural focus for their political activities and loyalty\n(Haas, 1968). Thus, integration would gradually produce a\nconvergence of beliefs, values, and aspirations that would\nunite the peoples of the European community. Haas (1976)\ndid later become more skeptical of this view, as it seemed as\nif progress in the EU to further integration had slowed down,\nalthough the subsequent development of the single market,\nthe Schengen Agreement, EU enlargement toward the east,\nand the birth of the euro expanded co-operation over both\nfunctions and territory (Fligstein, Polyakova, & Sandholtz,\nincreased co-operation does not seem to have been matched\nby a growth in public support for the EU or a shared European\nidentity. In part, this may be because issues such as immigra-\ntion, the \"war on terror,\" and slow economic growth and the\nfinancial crisis have caused citizens to focus more on their\nnational governments. But also following the 1992 Maastricht\nTreaty, the balance in the EU has shifted from economic\ntoward political and cultural integration (Fligstein et al.,\n2012). For some Europeans, such developments and the\nexpansion in the EU institution's role in governance threaten\nnational identity while formalizing a European supranational\nidentity (Fligstein et al., 2012). This may have resulted in the\nEU being looked on less favorably by some citizens (Shore,\n2000). But equally perhaps, it may have led others to identify\nmore with the EU; that is, it may have polarized views.\nThese are important developments because there is evi-\ndence that less supportive citizens are more Eurosceptic\n(Usherwood & Startin, 2013). In addition, governments are\nunlikely to support further political, social, or economic inte-\ngration if their citizens are not supportive of the EU (Down\n& Wilson, 2013). Hence, an understanding of the determi-\nnants of public support for the EU and for European integra-\ntion is also important if we are to understand the direction the\nEU is likely to move in over the coming decades.\nVerhaegen, Hooghe, and Quintelier (2014) argue that sup-\nporting greater EU integration involved a cost\u00adbenefit calcu-\nlation, a view empirically supported by Gabel (1998) and\nSanchez-Cuenca (2000). This implies that the winners from\nEU integration will tend to be in favor of integration, and\nsupport the EU itself, whereas the losers will tend to hold\nopposite views. Consistent with this perspective, Fligstein\net al. (2012) argue that European economic and cultural inte-\ngration have tended to involve those from the higher end of\nthe socio-economic spectrum. However, blue-collar, lower\nwhite-collar, service, and older workers have benefited less\nand will tend to favor their own governments over the EU. In\nterms of empirical work, Verhaegen et al. examine percep-\ntions that EU membership is good for the country and per-\nceptions of a European identity, rather than attitudes to\nfurther integration per se. They find personal characteristics\nsuch as age and gender to be significant in determining sup-\nport for the EU, as well as occupational variables, the indi-\nvidual's financial position, and country variables linked to\nthe economic situation, the date of joining the EU, and\nEurozone membership. The pattern of significance tends to\nsuggest, as indicated above, that the winners, in terms of\nthose who are doing well, tend to support the EU more than\nothers.\nKuhn and Stoeckel (2014) analyze support for European\neconomic governance, again using survey data. In practice,\ntheir dependent variables are averaged perceptions of whether\na greater EU role in economic governance in several dimen-\nsions would or would not be effective, rather than whether the\nindividual would support such a development. The most sig-\nnificant variable is, unsurprisingly, trust in EU institutions.\nLawson and Hudson 5\nOther socio-economic variables, for example, age, gender,\neducation, and occupation, are not that significant.\nKritzinger (2003) presents an alternative view to the eco-\nnomic self-interest based approach and emphasizes the polit-\nical, economic, cultural, and historical contexts in which\nattitudes developed. The key role of national concerns in\nEuropean parliamentary elections supports this hypothesis\n(Franklin, Van der Eijk, & Marsh, 1995). Lacking specific\nEU knowledge, voters use their evaluations of domestic poli-\ntics (Anderson, 1998). Much of their general EU information\nis also filtered through national politicians. Garry and Tilley\n(2009) also argue that apart from a cost\u00adbenefit calculation,\nattitudes are influenced by national identity. But there is little\nagreement on the nature of this influence. Carey (2002) links\na strong sense of national identity with anti-integration\nviews. Haesly (2001) finds the opposite. Garry and Tilley\nreconcile these conclusions by arguing that the impact\ndepends on the country's situation, for example, with respect\nto income per capita. In passing, we note that their control\nvariables included age, sex, employment status, and educa-\ntion level, finding support for the EU to be associated with\nbeing relatively highly educated, middle class, male, and sat-\nisfied with the country's economic performance.\nOrdinary citizens may link their views of national and EU\npolitics in one of two opposed ways. The \"equal assess-\nments\" hypothesis suggests that people interpret both from\nsimilar viewpoints, perhaps because national politicians also\nparticipate in inter-governmental meetings (Anderson,\n1998). A counter perspective sees national and EU politics as\nalternatives, even rivals: Those disillusioned with one may\nsee the other as a more attractive way forward. Using 1994\nEurobarometer data, Kritzinger (2003) concludes that \"the\nEU is used as a proxy for symbolic protest against the present\nnational political and economic situation\" (p. 237).\nThe impact of anti-Americanism on EU citizens'views on\ndefense policy has been analyzed by Ray and Johnston\nfor the EU-15 members, and concluded that anti-American-\nism was positively associated with support for EU, rather\nthan NATO-led defense policy. They also noted that \" . . .\nanti-Americanism does push some Europeans away from\nmultilateral defense policymaking altogether\" (Ray &\nnational approach to defense policy.\nAttitude Determination\nRespondents' Attitudes Toward U.S. Policies\nBecause anti-Americanism, the key variable that we analyze,\nis binary, we use probit regression. The literature review\nshowed that there has been some empirical research into\nanti-Americanism, much of the early work focusing on dif-\nferences between countries rather than on individuals within\ncountries. However, more recent work has focused on\nindividual attitudes across a range of countries (Blaydes &\nties in this article are that it uses a different variable to mea-\nsure anti-Americanism, one based on consistent opposition\nto American policies, rather than a continuous variable. It\nalso analyzes the evolution of attitudes across several years.\nFinally, it includes the first empirical analysis that explores a\npossible link between EU citizens' opinions on U.S. policies\nand their opinions on EU integration. There has been specu-\nlation on whether anti-Americanism has had adverse effects\non the United States, for example, on its political influence\nand economic interests. But there has been much less analy-\nsis of the effects on other countries.\nA theoretical determination of citizens' views of the United\nStates's policies is not set out formally here. Our purpose rather\nis to explore whether there are any interesting empirical regu-\nlarities in the data. We do not presuppose that respondents'\nviews are in the main irrational or prejudiced. Neither do we\npresuppose the contrary. A predisposition to take a positive or\nnegative view of U.S. policy may be perfectly consistent with a\nset of goals that respondents could have articulated, but we can-\nnot deduce from their recorded answers. We neither assume nor\ncan deduce their answers reflect any predisposition.\nThe primary independent variables of interest are those\nrelating to the individual's characteristics, the country fixed\neffects, and the individual's policy preference variables. We\nfocus on four policy issues: terror, the economy, defense, and\nthe environment, using a simple measure that reflects\nwhether the individual thought they were important. These\nare included because, for example, individuals' attitudes to\nU.S. policies may in part depend on the relative importance\nthey place on the environment as compared with terrorism as\npolicy issues. Country-specific attitudes will differ, and\nagain memory will be relevant, although this time, it is likely\nto be the collective memory of a nation that, as noted above,\ndetermines attitudes to the United States.\nFollowing common practice in analyzing political atti-\ntudes, and also consistent with some of the work we have\nreferenced, our control variables include the socio-economic\nvariables of age, education, sex, occupation, a measure of the\nrespondents' household income relative to their country's\naverage household income, and a variable that reflects\nrespondents' trust in big business. Underlying their inclusion\nis the belief that individual attitudes are partially determined\nby individual circumstances and knowledge. Not all these\nvariables are available for all three surveys.\nThe variables are defined in the appendix. A brief ratio-\nnale for their inclusion is as follows.\nThe literature survey indicated that views of U.S. policy\nor its effects may be influenced by respondents' views of the\nU.S. government, people, culture, power, and social and eco-\nnomic systems. Attitudes toward these factors have changed\nover time and location.Attitudes may be partly influenced by\nknowledge, including personal experience. To some extent,\nthey may be related to social norms and hence reference\n6 SAGE Open\ngroups, conventional wisdom, and even irrational bias. In\nturn, these influences can sometimes be linked to the inde-\npendent variables used here.\nFor example, educated people may be more aware of\nissues such as the violation of human rights in Abu Ghraib,\nor climate change, which in turn could fuel a blanket opposi-\ntion to U.S. policies. Variables such as age, sex, and educa-\ntion may be related to direct experience of American culture,\nincluding music, films, or fast food outlets that may be fac-\ntors influencing respondents' attitudes to America. Age may\nalso be relevant in providing a direct memory of periods such\nas the Cold War and the Second World War2 when American\npower was often viewed more favorably than in the Bush era.\nLocation can also influence exposure to American culture:\nFor example, exposure to fast food outlets or U.S. multina-\ntionals is more likely in large cities than rural areas.\nRespondents' Attitudes to European Integration\nThe focus is on policies with international spillovers, defense\nrelated foreign policy, and also the EU constitution. We fol-\nlow Verhaegen et al. (2014) and others, and assume those\nwho favor greater European integration feel that they will\nbenefit from it--individually or altruistically, or both. Their\nviews are uninfluenced by the appropriate service delivery\nlevel (Oates, 1999), because this is a given. International\ninfluence and defense capability increase with economic\nsize. Hence, a united EU voice has more impact than any\nsingle member country, and possibly more than the sum of\nall members. But integration also entails a loss of sover-\neignty, and a country may become committed to support and\nfinance policies it opposes.\nIndividual differences toward EU integration will thus\narguably largely depend on how the individual perceives the\nnational interest and the extent to which they are willing to\ntrade national sovereignty for a greater global role. Such atti-\ntudes are likely to be driven by national pride and identity, and\ntherefore, we include the socio-economic factors that are stan-\ndard in this type of analysis as well as country fixed effects.\nIn addition, we also include attitudes to the United States.\nThere are two possibilities. The first and most obvious is that\nanti-Americanism will drive European integration. This is\nconsistent with an analysis of the institutional choices of EU\nconstitutional delegates in the area of EU foreign policy\n(Jensen, Slapin, & Koenig, 2007). They found that delegates\nfrom states that had not deployed troops in support of the\nU.S.-led Iraq invasion were more likely to support EU inte-\ngration. Their explanation was that such states would be\nmore interested in creating a European foreign policy capa-\nble of counterbalancing the United States because they are\nmore opposed to U.S. policy. But with individual citizens'\nattitudes, there is also the reverse possibility: that people are\nopposing a superpower and will not want to see a second\nsuperpower grow from the nations of Europe, although, or\nperhaps especially as, they will be part of that superpower.\nData and Analysis\nWe have already described the Eurobarometer sample frame\nand interview procedures. Our probit regressions use the sur-\nvey's attitudinal and characteristics data to explore their\ninter-linkages. The variables are defined in the appendix.\nThe key variable is, of course, the one relating to anti-Amer-\nicanism, and it is measured by sustained opposition to\nAmerican policies across five dimensions of policies: peace,\nterrorism, poverty, the environment, and world growth.\nAttitudes to the EU are measured in relation to voter sup-\nport for a greater co-ordination of defense policy, foreign\npolicy, an EU military rapid reaction force, a common crisis\nresponse position, and greater independence of foreign pol-\nicy from the United States. In the two more recent surveys,\ndata on the last three were not available, but there was infor-\nmation on support for an EU constitution. The constitution\napart, these are predominantly foreign policy and defense\nissues that could be addressed by inter-state agreements.\nHence, greater EU co-ordination implies a reduction in\nnational sovereignty. Of course, to an extent, this is also the\ncase for the EU constitution. In our analysis of the 2003 sur-\nvey, the individuals'incomes were approximated by the mid-\npoint of the income range in which the survey placed them.\nTheir relative income was calculated as the ratio of this\napproximation to the country average. In the later surveys,\ndata on income were not reported, but data on life satisfac-\ntion and, in the 2005 survey, on individual personal circum-\nstances in the recent past were available and were used.\nVoters' Views on U.S. Policies\nTable 1 reports attitudinal variables. The first column in the\ntop half of Table 1 records the proportion classified as anti-\nAmerican in 2003, that is, disapproving of U.S. policy with\nrespect to all five policy areas of peace, terror, poverty, envi-\nronment, and growth. The alternatives include positive\nviews and respondents with neither positive nor negative\nfeelings. The proportions are quite high and much higher\nthan would be the case if views were randomly distributed\nbetween alternatives across the different issues.

But it is\nclear on this that \"new Europe\" is less disapproving of the\nUnited States than \"old Europe.\" The difference between\nFrance and the United Kingdom has narrowed throughout\nthe 3 years, with both countries showing some convergence.\nNonetheless, based on the 2006 regression, 3.1 for a \"repre-\nsentative individual,\"5 the probability of being opposed to\nU.S. policies on all 5 issues is .23 in the United Kingdom and\nsubstantially greater at .31 in France.\nWe also show at the foot of the table the different log like-\nlihoods from (a) excluding country fixed effects and (b)\nincluding just country fixed effects. The log likelihoods of\nthe former are consistently much closer to zero, indicating\nhigher explanatory power than the latter. This implies that\nLawson and Hudson 11\nmost of the variability in responses is between countries\nrather than across socio-economic characteristics.\nVoters' Views of EU Policies\nTable 1 also shows basic data on respondents'attitudes toward\nEU policies. Specifically, it shows the proportion who\napproved of greater EU integration or co-operation out of all\nthose surveyed, including \"don't knows.\" In 2003, a large\nmajority of respondents in all EU countries favored foreign\npolicy independence from the United States. Other foreign\nand defense issues follow a similar pattern. The only excep-\ntion was U.K. respondents' views on a more coordinated\nforeign policy, with slightly less than half of those questioned\nin favor. This general pattern of support was largely repeated\nIn Table 4, we focus on the relationship between respon-\ndents' attitudes to the United States and their support for\nEuropean integration. The regressions have been estimated\nby ordered probit. In the 2003 sample regressions, the binary\nvariable, \"anti-American,\" reflecting negative attitudes\nalong the five dimensions of support for the United States, is\nsignificant. That is, those classified as anti-American are\nmore likely to support an EU foreign policy more indepen-\ndent of the United States's. They are, however, less likely to\nsupport EU defense policy co-ordination and also foreign\nTable 4.

Men were also more\nfavorable to an expanded EU role in foreign and defense\nissues, including a rapid reaction force.

Responses reflect both attitudes to\nintegration and willingness to project military force.

However, there was an additional question on the EU\nconstitution. The results were largely consistent with those\nfor 2003 with respect to the impact of anti-Americanism.\nThey were also similar with respect to education and atti-\ntudes to the economy, although the latter was less significant\nin 2006. Concern for the environment and terrorism was,\nhowever, significant in affecting attitudes in both 2005 and\n2006. In addition, those whose personal situation had dete-\nriorated tended to be more hostile to a strengthening EU.\nDistrust of big business and government also tended to\nreduce support for EU integration.\nWe again show at the foot of the table the different log\nlikelihoods from excluding country fixed effects and includ-\ning just country fixed effects. In this case, the two are much\ncloser together than for the anti-Americanism regressions.\nThis implies that socio-economic characteristics are rela-\ntively much more important compared with country charac-\nteristics in determining attitudes to the EU than in explaining\nanti-Americanism. This result may well reflect the fact that\nthe EU has a much greater direct impact on European citi-\nzens than American policies.\nConclusion\nWe defined anti-Americanism as consistent opposition to\nU.S. policy and focused our study on those EU voters who\ntook a negative view of that policy in all of the five dimen-\nsions covered in the Eurobarometer surveys. Our three ques-\ntions were as follows:\nResearch Question 1: Is there clear evidence of the exis-\ntence of anti-Americanism in the EU electorate?\nResearch Question 2: Is anti-Americanism random, or is\nit linked to certain personal characteristics?\nResearch Question 3: Do those who consistently disap-\nprove of U.S. policies also share an identifiably similar\nset of opinions on the foreign policy or future political\ndevelopment of the EU?\nThe first of these questions may seem like something of a\nnon-issue given the amount of work that has been done on\nthis. But our results are based on a different measure of anti-\nAmericanism than has been used before. In addition, our\nresults show evidence for both anti-Americanism and pro-\nAmericanism sentiments within the countries of the EU,\nalthough we focus almost solely on the former. But we do not\nfind, as does Chiozza (2009a), that individual characteristics\nare more important than country ones, although, of course,\nthis relative importance will depend on the heterogeneity\nwithin and between countries in the sample analyzed.\nNonetheless, our results show strong evidence of anti-Amer-\nicanism linked to age, education, policy preferences, national\norigin, and in particular, mistrust of big business. The latter\nstrongly suggests that a root cause of anti-American attitudes\nis anti-capitalism. If so, the financial crisis and economic\nthe United States, notwithstanding the considerably greater\npopularity of President Obama outside America, compared\nwith that of his predecessor.\nIn \"old Europe,\" anti-Americanism is less common in the\nUnited Kingdom,7 Italy, Ireland, and Sweden. Greece,\nFrance, and Spain stand out in having consistently more\nunfavorable attitudes. As we noted, this pattern is consistent\nwith these countries' historical experiences. However, atti-\ntudes to the United States are in general considerably more\npositive in \"new\" than in \"old Europe.\" EU expansion does\nappear to have made its members, at least on average, less\nhostile to U.S. policy.\nExcepting Ireland, this pattern of country support also\nmatched explicit initial support for the Iraq war. It may also\nhave adversely affected American multinationals and U.S.\nexports (Anholt & Hildreth, 2004). The lesson is that a \"hard\npower\" victory can come at the expense of a \"soft-power\"\nEuropean hostility to America also has implications for\nthe EU. We showed that EU voter anti-Americanism leads to\na demand for less dependence on the US, though not for an\nEU to rival America. Indeed, the reverse is the case--disap-\nproval of American policies was not linked to a desire for\ngreater European defense and foreign policy integration, nor\nfor an EU constitution. Hence, we have identified an impact\nof anti-Americanism, not on the United States itself or its\npolicies, but on the EU. In the main, EU voters who feel\nAmerican policies have been bad for the world do not want a\nmore powerful EU. This may be because the EU is perceived\nas closely aligned with the United States, or because the\nUnited States represents an example of what the EU could\nbecome. It may, however, be that in the future, the EU does\ndevelop in a way that brings it more into conflict with the\nUnited States both politically (McNamara, 2011) and eco-\nnomically. In this case, it is possible that anti-Americanism\nwill be associated with support for a more integrated EU.\nFinally, it is important to stress that there are important\ndifferences across the countries between urban and rural\nLawson and Hudson 13\nareas. Therefore, it can be an oversimplification to label a\ncountry as being pro-EU integration or anti-American pol-\nicy. Our analysis has also shown that within country differ-\nences have a much more similar impact on attitudes to\nbetween country differences, than was the case for anti-\nAmericanism. Hence, if the EU is to increase support for\nintegration, then it has to focus on both levels, that is, on\nthose within countries who are skeptical and on those coun-\ntries that are most skeptical. In comparing our results with\nothers, the diversity of empirical definitions that have been\nused to proxy both anti-Americanism and EU integration\nshould be borne in mind.\nThe conclusions we have reached provide an extensive\nand nuanced answer to the question in our title \"Who Is anti-\nAmerican in the European Union.\" We relied on large scale\nand repeated surveys of public opinion. But it is worth recall-\ning an important limitation of this type of analysis. The data\ndo not allow us to distinguish opinion from distrust or indeed\nbias and prejudice. That limitation can be important if the\nviews we have recorded influence EU or EU member states'\npolicy. The obvious extension to our research would be to\nexplore the impact of European anti-Americanism on\nEuropean policy and relations with the United States.\nAppendix\nData Definitions\nIndividual Independent Variables:\nMale: female = 0, male = 1.\nAge: Respondent's age in years.\nVillage/Town: Coded 1 if the individual lived in a village\nor rural area/town; otherwise zero.\nEducation: Age an individual finished full-time educa-\nyears.\nSelf-employed, unemployed, house person, manual\nworker: Coded 1 if the respondent fell into any of these\ncategories; otherwise zero.\nHousehold income relative to country average:\nMeasured by the ratio of household income to average\nincome in a respondent's country.
