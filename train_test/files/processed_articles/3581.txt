For example,\neven small-scale farmers are gathering information pas-\nsively collected by precision agricultural equipment, and\nmany farmers are using information from large datasets\nand precision analytics to make on-farm decisions. John\nDeere fits all of its tractors with sensors that stream data\nabout soil and crop conditions and the corporation\ninvites farmers to subscribe (and pay) for access to infor-\nmation that can help them decide, for example, where to\nplant crops. John Deere tractors are proprietary and the\ndata they collect are not openly accessible to farmers. We\ncan see from this one example that the use of large infor-\nmation sets and the digital tools for collecting, aggregat-\ning and analysing them \u00ad together referred to as Big Data\n\u00ad has the potential to wade in on long-standing relation-\nships between players in food and agriculture (e.g.,\nbetween farmers and agricultural corporations). Despite\na solid body of critical data scholarship, there has been\nno attention given to Big Data's implications in the realm\nof food and agriculture. In this commentary, we argue\nthat current understandings of Big Data would benefit\nfrom a focus on their material consequences in food and\nagriculture, and we lay out suggestions as to how a line of\ninquiry across the fields of data studies and food studies\ncould facilitate such an improved understanding.\nBig Data in agriculture?\nArguably, farming has been empirically driven for over a\ncentury but the data collected was not digital.\nAgriculture Canada's family of research centres (circa\n1920s) meticulously accounted for wheat yields across\nfarms and weather patterns in order to increase efficiency\nin production. Big Data is different from this historic\ninformation gathering in terms of the volume and the\nanalytical potential embedded in contemporary digital\ntechnologies. Big Data proponents promise a level of\nprecision, information storage, processing and analysing\nthat was previously impossible due to technological limi-\ntations (see Datafloq, 2015). Compare a notebook\nwherein a farmer might log information about his or\nher crop performance with a digital phone `app' used\nto predict and direct future production practices.\nLogging information using the application can be done\nmore efficiently (even by voice recognition) and the\nvolume of information the farmer may access is pro-\nfound: agricultural management tools provide access to\ninteracting with datasets that stretch way beyond the\nindividual farm. Still, the nature of the distinction\nbetween historic farm monitoring and Big Data is an\nopen research question; systematically tracing the digital\nrevolution in agriculture and charting the affordances as\n1St. Thomas University, Canada\n2Carleton University, Canada\nCorresponding author:\nKelly Bronson, St. Thomas University, 51 Dineen Drive, Fredericton,\nNew Brunswick E3B 5G3, Canada.\nEmail: kbronson@stu.ca\nBig Data & Society\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav\nbds.sagepub.com\nCreative Commons NonCommercial-NoDerivs CC-BY-NC-ND: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Com-\nmons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 License (http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/) which permits\nnon-commercial use, reproduction and distribution of the work as published without adaptation or alteration, without further permission provided the\noriginal work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\nwell as the limitations of Big Data-driven decisions\nshould be a broad research goal for Big Data scholarship\nin the realm of food and agriculture.\nOur existing review of current Big Data applications\nin the agri-food sector has revealed several Big Data\ncollection and analytics tools that may have implica-\ntions for relationships of power between players in\nthe North American food system. Under a platform\ncalled Integrated Field Systems (IFS), Monsanto\nCorporation has a suite of digital tools for collecting\nand analysing farm data. Farmers are being encouraged\nto use Monsanto's IFS tools to collect information\nabout soil conditions, weed varieties and weather.\nThis information, they are told, will help them minim-\nize risk and streamline decision-making. IFS raises\nquestions, however, about the relative benefits of the\ncollection and use of Big Data in farming. In the case\nof Weed I.D., which helps farmers to identify weeds and\nmap weed pressures in a digital mapping tool, there are\nlikely also benefits to the corporation, namely, promot-\ning proprietary chemicals and identifying new chemical\nneeds and therefore areas of possible investment in\nresearch and development. That there are corporate\nbenefits attached to Big Data in agriculture seems evi-\ndenced by the recent purchasing habits of Monsanto,\nwhich bought the digital tool developer Climate\nCorporation in 2013. Climate Corp. itself is acquiring\n`start-ups' (640 Labs and Solum) who are focused on\ntools for collecting farm-level information.\nThe acquisition of these companies by Monsanto\nsuggests that Big Data has implications not just for\nfarmers but also for stakeholders throughout the agri-\nfood system. For instance, food processors are\nmonitoring social media data in an effort to predict\nconsumer sentiment and secure social approval or\n`license' (Prno and Slocombe, 2012). Sysmos\nCorporation has developed an analytics tool called\nHeartbeat, which combs social media for patterns rele-\nvant to food marketing trends and consumer interests.\nThe use of social media data to steer corporate priori-\nties is useful for food producers and retailers but it is\npotentially problematic, not least because social media\ndata is necessarily selective (e.g., only 18.5 million rela-\ntively young Canadians use Facebook, Oliviera, 2013).\nIt may be that the implications of Big Data relate\ndirectly to their context of development, namely, for-\nprofit, non-profit or public. The Agroclimate Impact\nReporter (AIR) is an application built by government,\nspecifically Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada's\nNational Agricultural Information Services (NAIS).\nClimate data from volunteers, farmers and media\nreporting is gathered using this tool and then the data\nis anonymized and mapped by NAIS, which maps can\nthen be used by anyone interested in information about\ncurrent/historical weather conditions municipally,\nregionally or nationally. The tool is explicitly intended\nto help producers mitigate weather-related risks but it is\nalso used to support them when they make claims to the\nCanadian Drought Monitoring and Livestock Tax\nDeferral program.\nThinking carefully about Big Data in\nagriculture: New directions in critical\ndata studies?\nThinking carefully about the context of the production\nand use of Big Data is precisely what critical data studies\nscholars do when they highlight Big Data as actively\nframed and interpreted by people, in particular social\n1995). `Data [do] not just exist', Lev Manovich explains,\nscientists have suggested that Big Data cannot be treated\nas a technical accomplishment separable from the social,\nand in particular from questions of justice and ethics\nhave, for example, revealed how much `crowd-sourced'\ninformation is primarily benefitting marketers and other\nelite interests, rather than the crowd (Qualman, 2009).\nFacebook has been accused and legally tried for the\nunauthorized collection of user data, from which it is\nsaid to profit handsomely (Matlack, 2012).\nThe critical data studies framework therefore allows\nfor the careful examination of the possible ethical impli-\ncations that appear to be arising from particular config-\nurations and uses of Big Data in the realm of food and\nagriculture. Some possible research questions for future\nwork in this area are as follows: Who retains ownership\nof the data generated by applications like Weed I.D.?\nAre there privacy implications with the data gathered\nby precision agricultural equipment? Who ought to\nhave access to the data generated by John Deere's pre-\ncision agricultural equipment? How are corporate scien-\ntists and consultants interfacing with data gathered by\ntools like Weed I.D. and are they doing so in service of\nprofit-generating innovations (like new chemicals)?\nExploring the ethical implications of Big Data in food\nand agriculture not only builds on critical data studies\nbut it also extends food studies scholarship, which has\nhistorically focused on the effects of technologies on\nfarmers and food systems (Clapp, 2012; Friedmann,\nthe development of genetically modified seeds, for\ninstance, has revealed that these technologies further\ninequities between farmers and large chemical corpor-\nations, not least because of a legal regime that limits\nfarmers' access to the technology (Bronson, 2015).\n2 Big Data & Society\nWe predict that particular agricultural systems may\nbe perpetuated not just in the design and use of Big\nData--say, for the disproportionate gain of powerful\nagri-food corporations--but also in the marketing of\nBig Data technologies. It is obvious that the imagined\ntypical user for John Deere's Big Data analytics is a\nfarmer who unproblematically adopts the newest tech-\nnologies. In the promissory images of the Farm\nForward marketing video (see John Deere, 2012), the\nfarmer is pictured using digital weather apps and living\nin a completely automated or `smart' house. The ima-\ngery of John Deere's Farm Forward marketing cam-\npaign is imbued by a long-standing cultural bias\ntowards farming that can be `rationally managed' as\ntechnology-maximizing, profit-oriented businesses \u00ad\nthis is called a `productivist' model for farming\n(Kneen, 1995). Food studies scholars have revealed\nproductivism as a model of over-production of inex-\npensive low-nutrient food that has brought great com-\nmercial gain to a handful of agri-food conglomerates,\nbut for the rest of the world it has resulted in serious\necological (Moore Lappe, 1971), economic (Lang and\nand sociocultural consequences (Esteva, 1996; Kneen,\n1995), without notably alleviating hunger and malnu-\ntrition in the long term (De Schutter, 2015, para. 6).\nThe marketing pitches for Big Data applications \u00ad\nalong with sensors, meters and other data-generating\ntools \u00ad arguably promise farmers the same thing that\ntractors and genetically modified seeds were and still\nare promised to do: `make the farm pay' (Kneen,\n1995). John Deere is said to be `revolutionizing' farm-\ning with Big Data. One description of their Big Data\ntools suggests that they will enable farmers to `enhance\nproductivity and increase business efficiency' (Datafloq,\n2015). Similarly, Monsanto's IFS is described online as\nintegrating `innovations in seed science, agronomy,\ndata analysis, precision agriculture equipment and\nservice to provide farmers with hybrid matches and a\nvariable rate planting prescription to improve corn\nyield opportunity' (Monsanto, 2014). These are not\nnew promises; rather, they reflect a long-standing pair-\ning between the good life and the effective application\nof new technologies to labour (Marx and Roe-Smith,\n1994). They arguably also reflect a bias against farming\nmethods that forgo high technologies by implicitly\npainting them parochial, folksy and backward, which\nbegs for critical reflection on Big Data in agriculture. A\nkey research question here is: In what ways do the\nimages circulating in the promotion of Big Data tools\nnormalize hegemonic farming systems?\nWhile many concerns in the area of Big Data in food\nand agriculture may have to do with data ownership\nand the furthering of inequity between food system\nplayers, we suspect that the issues are even more\ncomplex. While crowdsourcing Big Data tools rely on\nfarmers' knowledge, they do not necessarily invite\nfarmers to shape the context in which that knowledge\nis collected. Some possible research questions here are:\nWho has a role in deciding on the context for the data\nproduction, storage and use of particular data tools\nused in food and agriculture? Who decides which\nkinds of data are to be collected, given the functioning\nof current big digital collection and analytics tools? Are\nthere farming systems (like holistic farm management\nsystems) whose material realities cannot be captured by\napplications for collecting quantitative information\nNow is the time for critical data\nscholarship in food and agriculture\nBig Data is poised to reproduce long-standing relation-\nships between food system players \u00ad between farmers\nand corporations, or between organic and conventional\nfarmers \u00ad and thus it deserves scholarly attention by\nboth critical data and food studies scholars. Big Data\nis an important field of study, for `the era of big data\ntime for scholarly intervention into Big Data because\nthe consequences of Big Data and its social infrastruc-\nture (laws, mores) are not yet fixed. It is a technology's\ninteraction with the social ecology that determines its\nenvironmental, social and human consequences (Bijker\nOnce in place, the social system surrounding technolo-\ngies is notoriously difficult to analyse (Bowker and Star,\nporations and government scientists clamour for access\nto large datasets in order to drive their decision-\nmaking, significant questions are emerging about how\nthese data ought to be understood and managed. Big\nData scholarship ought to add to this understanding by\nasking questions about the context of data shaping and\nuse in agri-food \u00ad about how datasets are being con-\nstructed and used, by whom they are being used and for\nwhose benefit, and the potential limitations or biases of\nthe datasets under use.\nCritically examining Big Data in food and agricul-\nture provides a new site of scholarship for critical data\ntheorists and one that allows for the probing of the\nlinks between Big Data and the material aspects of\ndata use. Current enthusiasm for the material effects\nof social processes \u00ad the new materialist turn in social\nscience \u00ad has focused less on digital shifts, perhaps\nbecause `things always seem to be disappearing'\ning the material consequences of digital tools for\ngenerating and analysing agricultural information can\nraise questions of survival if it turns out that Big Data\nBronson and Knezevic 3\ndevelopments are supporting particular agricultural\nsystems of production, and thus particular farmer live-\nlihoods, at the expense of others.\nWe have raised questions that carry cultural, polit-\nical, ecological and material significance. A deliberate\nand sustained dialogue between data scholars and food\nscholars on the topic of Big Data in food and agricul-\nture seems a pressing research priority.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nAlbritton R (2009) Let Them Eat Junk: How Capitalism\nCreates Hunger and Obesity.
