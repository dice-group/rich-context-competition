Little is known about the factors\nunderlying this disparity.\nObjective: We explored whether childhood sociodemographic fac-\ntors (parental education, single-mother household, number of sib-\nlings, number of minors in household, birth order, and female\ncaregiver's age) were associated with the gender disparity in obesity\nprevalence in young black adults in the United States.\nDesign: An analytic data set (n \u00bc 7747) was constructed from the\nnationally representative National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent\nHealth. Childhood sociodemographic factors were assessed in 1994\u00ad\nfactor, we evaluated whether the prevalence difference (female obe-\nsity minus male obesity) was modified by the factor. We described\nthe contribution of each variable category to the overall prevalence\ndifference.\nResults: In unadjusted and multivariable-adjusted models, parental\neducation consistently modified gender disparity in blacks (P \u00bc 0.01).\nThe gender gap was largest with low parental education (16.7% of\nmen compared with 45.4% of women were obese) and smallest with\nhigh parental education (28.5% of men compared with 31.4% of\nwomen were obese). In whites, there was little overall gender differ-\nence in obesity prevalence.\nConclusions: To our knowledge, this was the first study to document\nthat the gender disparity in obesity prevalence in young black adults is\nconcentrated in families with low parental education. In these low-\nsocioeconomic-status families, obesity development is either under the\ncontrol of distinct mechanisms in each gender, or men and women from\nthese households adopt different obesity-related behaviors.

In contrast, there was\nvirtually no gender disparity in obesity prevalence in whites:\nwhite men (3).\nNHANES has monitored gender-specific obesity prevalence\nfor the past 35 y (4). During most of that time, the gender dis-\nparity among US blacks remained stable at '15 percentage\npoints, but has increased to 20 percentage points in more recent\nsurveys (2, 4). Although this gender disparity is well docu-\nmented, little is known about factors underlying the disparity: in\nfact, we know of no studies that have investigated factors as-\nsociated with this gender gap in obesity in blacks.\nBecause this gender disparity in obesity prevalence emerges in\nchildhood (2, 5), we hypothesized that the disparity observed in\nyoung adults is associated with characteristics of the childhood\nenvironment. Several sociodemographic characteristics of the\nchildhood family environment, such as parental education and\nbirth order, have been found to be associated with obesity risk in\nadolescence and adulthood (5\u00ad17). We hypothesized that soci-\nodemographic characteristics of the childhood family environ-\nment may differentially affect obesity risk in male and female\nchildren (18) and thus affect the magnitude of the gender dis-\nparity in obesity prevalence in black adults.\nWe were particularly interested in whether socioeconomic\nstatus (SES) was associated with gender disparity in obesity.

Nonetheless, a recent review\ntions between SES and obesity reversed in black men and\nwomen (20). This finding implied that the gender disparity\nwould be larger in high-SES than in low-SES black adults.\nHowever, this more recent research focused on an older pop-\nulation. In younger adults, it remains unclear whether, in the\nmore recent time period, the gender disparity in obesity was\nlarger in low-SES or in high-SES blacks.\nWe used data from a nationally representative prospective\ncohort study of adolescents followed into young adulthood to\ninvestigate the associations between sociodemographic charac-\nteristics of the childhood family environment and gender dis-\nparity in obesity prevalence in young black adults in the United\nStates. We replicated all analyses in US whites to detect common\npatterns in blacks and whites and to contextualize the disparities\nobserved in blacks.\nPopulation\nData were from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent\nHealth (Add Health). Add Health began as a nationally repre-\nsentative survey of all US public and private school students\nenrolled in grades 7 through 12. The Add Health survey focused\non adolescent risk behaviors and includes a wealth of behavior\ndata. The survey was cluster-sampled by school and also over-\nsampled some subgroups, including black students with a parent\nwho had completed college or attained a professional degree.\nistered to each student and to the student's primary in-residence\nstudentsexceptthosein12thgradeatbaselinewerere-interviewed.\nheight and weight were measured.\nWe restricted our sample to non-Hispanic blacks and whites, at\nleast one of whose parents was born in the United States. Race\nwas defined by a combination of child self-report and parent self-\nreport data (21). We restricted the sample to adolescents with\na US-born parent (22) because our theoretical framework pre-\nsumed that shared cultural and historical experiences shape how\nobesity-related beliefs, behaviors, and desired norms may be\ntransmitted differently to each gender. In immigrant families,\nthese constructs could be additionally influenced by the cultural\ncontext of their parents' countries of origin. We also restricted\nour analysis sample to those eligible to be interviewed at all\nwere excluded. All study procedures were approved by the In-\nstitutional Review Board of the University of North Carolina at\nChapel Hill.\nOutcome\nThe main study outcome was the prevalence difference for\nobesity (obesity prevalence in women minus that in men) at the\n7-y follow-up visit. Obesity was defined as body mass index\nA prevalence difference of 0 repre-\nsents an equal obesity prevalence for men and women, .0 in-\ndicates that women were more likely to be obese, and\n,0 indicates that men were more likely to be obese.\nWe considered modeling 6-y incidence rather than prevalence.\nIncidence is advantageous when one is estimating causal asso-\nciations and seeks to exclude bias from reverse causation and\nfrom confounding by differential outcome duration. However,\nour intention was not to calculate causal estimates. Furthermore,\nwe believe that reverse causation and differential outcome du-\nration are of limited importance in this analysis. First, it is un-\nlikely or impossible that a child's obesity status would affect\nparental education, family structure, female caregiver's age at\nchild's birth, number of minors in household, birth order, or\nnumber of siblings. Second, obesity is generally a persistent state.\nIn Add Health, over a 6-y period, obesity was maintained 80\u00ad\n90% of the time in black and white males and females (1). By\nmodeling prevalence, we produced estimates that can be directly\ncompared with other surveillance data and can be easily in-\ncorporated into estimates of public health burden.\nExposures and covariates\ninterviews of respondents and their caregivers. Six exposure var-\niables were examined: number of full siblings (including re-\nspondent), birth order, number of minors (age  18 y) living in the\nrespondent's household (including respondent), parental educa-\ntion, family structure, and female caregiver's age at the time of the\nrespondent's birth. Both birth order and number of siblings were\ndefined in terms of the respondent's full sibship, ie, all children of\nboth respondents' biological parents. Parental education was de-\nfinedas thehighesteducationattainedbyeitheroftherespondent's\nbiological parents (5). We categorized family structure into 4\ngroups: household headed by single mother; by both biological\nparents; by 2 parents, at least one of whom was nonbiological; and\nother (22). Ninety-two percent of the identified female caregivers\nreported being the respondents' biological mothers.\nOther variables included in all multivariable models were\ncategorical age and the respondent's biological sex. Although we\nuse a variable for biological sex, our theoretical framework pre-\nsumes that the obesity disparity observed between black men and\nwomen results from both biological (``sex'') and cultural (``gen-\nder'') influences (24). For lack of a more precise term, throughout\nthis article, we use the word ``gender'' to connote the confluence\nof biological and cultural influences.\nExclusions\nOverall, 78.3% of those eligible participated in the 7-y\nrespondents, 7.7% were excluded from the present analysis.\nAbout 5% of respondents were excluded because they were\nmissing baseline exposure information (4.6%), mostly female\ncaregiver's age at child's birth, which was missing for 3.6% of\nrespondents. Others were excluded because they were outside\nthe desired age range (0.01%), lived alone at baseline (0.2%),\nwere pregnant at the time of the follow-up visit [2.2% overall\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\n(4.5% black women; 4.0% white women)], or were missing\nmeasured and self-reported height or weight data (0.9%). Self-\nreported height or weight was substituted for missing measured\ndata for 5.4% of respondents (7.2% of black females, 6.4% of\nblack males, 5.6% of white females, and 4.2% of white males).\nwhite respondents.\nData analysis\nEffect modification of the prevalence difference\nOur primary hypothesis was tested by examining whether there\nwas effect modification of the prevalence difference in obesity\nby any of 6 exposure variables. Specifically, this analysis tested\nwhether the prevalence difference varied across categories of\neach childhood sociodemographic factor. All sociodemographic\nfactors were analyzed as nominal categorical variables. We first\ncalculated obesity prevalence by race for each gender within each\nexposure category. We then estimated the obesity prevalence\ndifference in each stratum of each exposure. Finally, effect\nmodification of the prevalence difference by each exposure was\ntested by using modified Wald tests (25).\nAll estimates were corrected for Add Health's complex survey\ndesign (25). Both unadjusted and multivariable-adjusted esti-\nmates were calculated for all analyses (Stata 9; Stata Corp, Col-\nlege Station, TX). To allow multivariable-adjusted associations to\nvary independently by gender, all variable categories had inter-\nactions with gender. Calculating adjusted prevalence estimates\nfrom multivariable logistic regression models required us to set\nmodel covariates to specific values (26). We chose to standardize\nthe multivariable-adjusted estimates to hypothetical race-strati-\nfied populations with covariate distributions similar to those of the\nsample population. For each race group, we set each covariate\ncategory's value at the mean proportion of respondents in that\ncategory over the 2 genderes (Microsoft Excel, Redmond, WA).\nThe one exception was respondent's age, for which data from the\n2 race groups were combined before determining the mean pro-\nportions. The delta method was used to calculate 95% CIs for\nprevalence differences.\nBecause some of our 6 exposures were likely to be associated\nwith each other, we screened for multicollinearity. We used\nbivariate multinomial logistic regression models with each var-\niable as an outcome and each of the other 5 variables separately as\nan exposure. We found that female caregiver's age at the time of\nthe respondent's birth was strongly associated [odds ratio (OR) \n3.0] with most other exposure variables. To examine this further,\nwe ran multivariable models both including and excluding the\nfemale caregiver's age variable. The estimates for other variables\nchanged very little, so we report estimates from multivariable\nmodels including female caregiver's age at the time of the\nrespondent's birth.\nWe also observed a strong bivariate association (OR  3.0)\nbetween birth order and number of siblings. To separate the\nassociations with birth order compared with those with the\nnumber of siblings, we created joint variables that allowed us to\nexamine associations between prevalence differences in obesity\nand either birth order or size of sibship while holding the other\nfactor constant. These analyses indicated that birth order was the\nfactor more strongly associated with differential obesity preva-\nlence by gender (data not shown). Therefore, our final multi-\nvariable logistic regression models included gender, categorical\nage, 5 exposure variables (excluding number of full siblings), and\ngender interaction terms with all variables.\nDecomposition of the prevalence difference\nWe used the Kitagawa decomposition technique to divide the\noverallgenderdisparityintocomponentsduetodifferencesbetween\nmen and women in their stratum-specific obesity prevalences (27).\nFor each variable, the standard population was assigned the average\nexposure distribution of the 2 gender groups. We modified the Ki-\ntagawa method by dividing each stratum-specific component by the\nsum of the absolute values of the stratum-specific components in-\nstead of dividing by the overall prevalence difference. This ap-\nproach simplifies interpretation when stratum-specific estimates\nhave different signs. In addition, this approach explores only dis-\nparity due to differences in stratum-specific obesity prevalence by\ngender, not that which may be due to men and women having dif-\nferent likelihoods of being in a given stratum. Any disparity due to\ndifferences in the percentage of men and women in each stratum is\nreflected in the difference between the overall gender disparity and\nthe sum of the stratum-specific components.\nRESULTS\nThe mean age, obesity prevalence, and distributions of the\nexposure variables across the 4 race-gender groups are shown in\nTable 1. The distributions of the exposure variables differed\nbetween blacks and whites but generally varied little between\nmales and females of the same race. As expected, obesity\nprevalence was higher in black women than in black men: the\nestimated prevalence difference was 11.9 percentage points\nference in obesity prevalence: the prevalence difference was\nThe distributions of unadjusted prevalence differences across\nthe 6 exposure variables in whites and blacks are shown in Table\n2. In blacks, the prevalence difference, or magnitude of black\nwomen's excess obesity prevalence compared with black men,\nwas not uniform across the exposure variables. For instance,\nthe prevalence difference in blacks varied markedly depending\non parental education (P \u00bc 0.01). In families in which neither\nparent completed high school, obesity prevalence in black\nwhich corresponded to a large prevalence difference of 28.8\npercentage points (Table 2). In contrast, in blacks with at least\none parent with a college degree, the prevalence difference was\nonly 2.9 percentage points. There was also some statistical\nevidence that the gender disparity in blacks varied with birth\norder (P \u00bc 0.11). Because tests of modification are weakly\npowered and therefore prone to type II error, cutoffs as high as\n0.20 are often recommended to identify variation in an effect\nmeasure (28\u00ad30). In whites, the prevalence difference did not\nvary across any exposures to the same degree as it did for\nparental education in blacks, but the prevalence difference in\nwhites did tend to vary with parental education (P \u00bc 0.05), age\nMultivariable-adjusted prevalence differences are shown in\nFigure 1, A\u00adE.

These prevalence differences are indicated on\nthe figures by the dashed lines. The P values associated with\nFigure 1 (A\u00adE) are from tests of the association between each\nsociodemographic factor and the gender disparity in obesity\nprevalence: the tests evaluated whether the prevalence difference\nvaried between categories of each exposure variable. The most\nstriking association with the obesity gender disparity was found\nfor parental education in blacks (Figure 1A; P \u00bc 0.01). The\nprevalence difference was greatest among those whose parents\ndid not complete high school and was smallest among those with\na parent who completed college. In whites, as in blacks, the\noverall trend was that women from the lowest-educated families\nhad a higher risk of obesity risk than did men from similar fam-\nilies.

To our knowledge, this study was the\nfirst to examine family factors as possible correlates of the gender\ngap in obesity prevalence in blacks. Parental education was the\nonly sociodemographic variable that was strongly associated with\nthe gender disparity in obesity in blacks. In fact, nearly half of the\noverall gender gap was concentrated among the one-fifth of\nyoung black adults whose parents did not complete high school.\nWhereas young black women from low-education families were\nat the greatest risk of obesity, young black men from these same\nfamilies appeared to be at the lowest risk.\nAlthough US research addressing gender disparities in obesity\nprevalence is scarce, there is a body of relevant work examining\ninternational differences in obesity prevalence (31\u00ad35). The\nassociation between SES and obesity varies both by gender and\nby a country's degree of economic development [as assessed by\nthe United Nations' Human Development Index (HDI)] (35).\nFor men in poor, low-HDI nations, SES is positively associated\nwith obesity; studies of men in medium-HDI nations (eg, Brazil\nand Saudi Arabia) find fewer positive associations and more null\nassociations; and in men from high-HDI nations (eg, the United\nStates and Australia), null and negative associations are most\ncommon. Women in low-HDI and medium-HDI countries tend\nto show trends similar to those observed for men, but, in high-\nContributions of population subgroups, defined by childhood sociodemographic factors, to the female-male disparity in the prevalence of obesity in US black\nContribution to gender gap Contribution to gender gap\nPopulation\nweights2 Unadjusted model Multivariable model\nPopulation\nweights2 Unadjusted model Multivariable model\n% percentage points (%) % percentage points (%)\nParental education\nFamily structure\nFemale caregiver's age at child's birth\nNo. of children in household\nNo. of children in full sibship\nBirth order\n1 HS, high school.\n2 These population weights are race-specific averages of males' and females' population distributions of the variable, adjusted for Add Health's clustered\nsampling design and unequal probability of selection.\n3 These decomposition estimates (from the modified Kitagawa decomposition technique) divide the overall female-male disparity into stratum-specific\ncomponents. Because of rounding, the components may not add up to the total female-male disparity (all values in this column).\n4 These decomposition estimates (from modified Kitagawa decomposition) express the stratum-specific components of the female-male disparity as\npercentages of the sum of the absolute values of the stratum-specific components of the female-male disparity (all values in this column).\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nHDI countries, negative associations are more common in\nwomen than in men (35).\nOur findings for whites conformed to patterns observed for\nhigh-HDI countries, but our findings for blacks did not. The\ngender disparity in young black adults more closely resembled\nthe profile of a medium-HDI country, where obesity prevalence is\nusually much higher in women than in men (32, 36). Within\nmedium-HDI and high-HDI nations, historical subgroups can be\nclassified as living in contexts less developed than the larger\nnation's because the subgroup is not fully integrated into the\nnation's social and economic systems (33, 35). As in American\nIndians in the United States or in Maoris in New Zealand, black\nAmericans in the high-HDI United States could be classified as\nliving in a medium-HDI context: legally sanctioned mechanisms\nbarred them from full participation in American social and\neconomic life until well into the 20th century (37).\nMoreover, the divergent associations between SES and obesity\nthat we observed in young US blacks (men: positive; women:\ninverse) resemble those of a medium-HDI country in the midst of\nrapid nutrition transition. In these countries, the obesity burden\nshifts from high-SES individuals to low-SES individuals (34),\nand this shift generally occurs in women before it occurs in men\n(31, 34, 38). Thus, the prevalence of obesity in women may be\ninversely associated with SES, while the prevalence of obesity in\nmen may retain its positive association. Furthermore, as obesity\nprevalence stabilizes or decreases among women of high SES, it\nmay continue to increase among men, causing the gender gap to\ndecrease. However, over the past 35 y, the magnitude of the\ngender disparity in obesity among US black adults has not de-\ncreased (2, 4). Further research should explore whether the\nobesity patterns of black Americans conform to the model ob-\nserved in rapidly developing medium-HDI nations.\nOur results appear to differ from conclusions reached by\na recent review, which argued that, in blacks with less than a high\nschool education, women had a lower and men had a higher\nprevalence of obesity relative to other black adults of the same\ngender (20). This conclusion was based largely on Zhang and\nSeveral aspects of that analysis differed from ours. Most notably,\n(39), whereas the average age of our cohort was '21 y; a pre-\nvious study found age differences in the gender-specific rela-\ntions between obesity and SES for young black adults aged\nprevalence differences; they examined an adult's own educa-\ntional attainment whereas we used parental education; their ed-\nucation categories (9th grade, 10th\u00ad12th grade, and college or\nhigher) differed from ours (,12th grade, some college, college\ndegree, and higher than college); and their sample of blacks was\nsmaller than ours, which resulted in more unstable estimates.\nOur analysis was not without limitations. First, we examined\na narrow age range within young adulthood; therefore, our\nfindings may not generalize to older adults. Second, we did not\ninvestigate the respondent's adult SES independent of his or her\nparents' educational attainment; the age range examined is\na highly complex transitional period, in which it is difficult to\nclassify SES independent of family of origin. Third, we were\nlimited in using preexisting data. For instance, family structure\nand number of minors in the household were only examined\nduring adolescence; perhaps examination at a younger age or of\ncumulative exposure over a longer period would have produced\ndifferent results. Furthermore, comparedwith tests ofmain effects\nin data sets of the same size, tests of modification tend to have\nrelatively low power, which would increase the likelihood of\na possibility of differential selection bias by gender, especially\namong blacks. Only students enrolled in school were eligible for\nthe study, and black males drop out of school at a higher rate than\ndo black females. In addition, fewer black male respondents than\nfemale respondents were retained in the young adult follow-up\nsample. However, the Add Health sample weights were designed\nto account for this differential loss-to-follow-up.\nOur study had many strengths. To our knowledge, Add Health\nis the only nationally representative data set with an adequate\nsample size and diversity of variables suitable for this work.\nFurthermore, blacks with college-educated parents were over-\nsampled, which allowed us to produce relatively precise estimates\nfor parental education. In addition, we had access to both in-\ndividual-level (reported by the respondents) and household-level\n(reported by the respondents as well as their parents) variables,\nwhich is rare in a study of this size. Height and weight data were\nmeasured by trained staff; there is evidence that associations\nbetween obesity and SES differ when anthropometric data are\nself-reported rather than measured (35). Additionally, retention\nrates were good over the 7-y follow-up period. Finally, our\nanalysis of effect modification of prevalence differences allowed\nus to make meaningful comparisons across race and across ex-\nposure variables.\nIt remains a puzzle why black boys and girls from similar\ngenetic, family, and community backgrounds have such different\nrisks of developing obesity by young adulthood. In low-SES\nfamilies, it is apparent that black sons and daughters either adopt\nvery different and gender-specific obesity-related behaviors or that\nobesity development occurs through different mechanisms for\nthese young women and men. We found that parental education,\nbut not other examined family factors, strongly predicted the\ndegree to which obesity prevalence differed by gender. Perhaps,\ncommunity characteristics related to SES are more important than\nwithin-family dynamics in explaining the gender difference in\nobesity prevalence in young adults. Future research on the causes\nunderlying the decades-old gender difference in obesity prevalence\namong US blacks should examine mechanisms by which behav-\nioral and community characteristics of blacks from low-SES\nfamilies may differentially affect obesity risk in males and females\nduring adolescence and young adulthood.\nSpecial "
