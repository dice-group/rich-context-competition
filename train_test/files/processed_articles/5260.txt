Semistructured interviews were conducted on 11 nurses with more than 5\nyears of clinical experience in addition to more than 3 years of experience in neurology wards. Senior nursing officers from\neach hospital selected the participants. In general, these nurses expressed distress over the inevitable progression of disease.\nNurses talked about the \"basis of dedication,\" \"conflicts with dedication,\" \"reorganization for maintaining dedication,\" and\n\"the reason for the change from conflict to commitment.\" \"Reorganization for maintaining dedication\" meant that nurses\nwere able to handle the prospect of rededicating themselves to their patients. Furthermore, \"the reason for the change\nfrom conflict to commitment\" referred to events that changed nurses' outlooks on nursing care, their pride as nurses, or\ntheir learning experiences. They felt dedicated and conflicted both simultaneously and separately. While committing to their\npatients' physical care, nurses were empowered to think positively and treat patients with dignity in spite of the care taking\nmuch time and effort, as well as entailing considerable risk.\n",

This includes motor neuron diseases such as amyo-\ntrophic lateral sclerosis, spinocerebellar degeneration,\nmultiple system atrophy, Parkinson's disease, and multiple\nsclerosis. Most of these diseases are progressive and ulti-\nmately prevent patients from living independently.\nIndividuals often feel that their life is not worth living when\nthey are diagnosed or when their condition progresses\nPolicy and Practice for Intractable\nNeurological Disease in Japan\nThe Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare\n(MHLW) has supported policies aimed at intractable dis-\neases since 1973. This effort has the following goals: (a) to\npromote research, (b) to develop and maintain appropriate\nhealth care facilities, (c) to reduce the burden of self-health\ncare costs, (d) to expand and improve available health care\nby working with affiliated organizations and institutions, and\n(e) to promote measures to improve the quality of life (QOL)\nof individuals with 1 of the 27 neurological diseases included\n(Japanese Intractable Diseases Information Centre, n.d.-a).\nThe health care facilities of interest are long-term care\nand acute hospitals, advanced treatment hospitals, and\nresearch institutes. People with intractable neurological dis-\neases may be living in one of these facilities or at home.\nHowever, patients in advanced treatment hospitals or acute\ncare hospitals may not receive long-term care. Such hospitals\ntreat patients and educate health care professionals, but do\nnot have the facilities or abilities necessary for long-term\ncare. Thus, these hospitals are generally used for diagnoses,\ntreatment of acute symptoms, and outpatient care.\nJapanese researchers have recently begun to address\npatient experience, enhancement of home care systems, and\nwelfare development. \"Welfare\" refers to a social movement\nthat provides basic physical and material well-being and\nfinancial support for these patients (Japanese Intractable\nDiseases Information Centre, n.d.,-b, MHLW). Previous\nstudies reported that nurses caring for patients with intracta-\nble neurological diseases may be conflicted, but the reason\nfor this is unclear. One possibility is that these nurses may\n1Juntendo University, Urayasu, Japan\nCorresponding Author:\nMasako Nagase, Associate Professor, Faculty of Health Care and Nursing,\nEmail: mnagase@juntendo.ac.jp\nCaring for Patients With Intractable\nNeurological Diseases\nMasako Nagase1, Mayumi Takaya1, Kumiko Uzawa1,\nKiyoko Aoki1, and Keiko Hino1\n Keywords\nqualitative research, intractable neurological diseases, nursing specialty, conflict, commitment/dedication, nursing attitudes,\nnursing profession, patient care\n2 SAGE Open\nfeel a sense of powerlessness due to the gap between the\nideal situation and reality.\nProfessionalization of Nurses\nWhy do nurses go through conflicts in caring for these\npatients? Professionalization of nursing might be one reason.\nAccording to Sandelowski (2000), nurses claimed to be pro-\nfessionals because they introduced and used devices and new\ntechnology; this change altered nurses' position of providing\n\"tender loving care.\" However, nurses who care for patients\nwith intractable neurological diseases do not use devices or\nnew technology. Therefore, there is no doubt that their work\nis truly nursing.\nWhile nursing may also involve spiritual care, many nurses\nin Japan do not understand the concept of spirituality (Nagase\net al., 2013). In certain functional or acute care hospitals, nurses\nwho care for patients with intractable neurological diseases\nmay be aware that their patients suffer from spiritual distress.\nHowever, they may believe that it is unnecessary or inappropri-\nate to provide \"spiritual care.\" Rather, they are committed to\nhelping patients execute activities of daily living (ADLs).\nBy the late 1980s in the United States, despite historically\nhigh salaries, multithousand dollar signing bonuses, wide-\nopen career ladders, work that produced immediately tangi-\nble results, great opportunities for learning, and visual\nguarantees of employment for nurses who wanted to work,\nnearly one third of the registered nurses in the United States\nwere not practicing nursing (Reverby, 1987). Part of the rea-\nson may lie in the inherent contradiction of being \"ordered to\ncare,\" which means that emotional work, usually spontane-\nous, is a required part of the job. Smith (1992) categorized\nnursing as emotional labor.\nOutcomes of Research in Social Science\nMany theorists and researchers have addressed the issues of\nhealth, illness, well-being, suffering, and caring. Galvin and\nTodres (2013) attempted to show how a personal philosophy\ntoward life and research can offer valuable ways to approach\nthe relationship of health-related caring and well-being. The\nlifeworld concept is used in philosophy and in some social\nsciences, particularly sociology. An important and central\ntheme of work of Galvin and Todres is caring for well-being,\nwhich refers to providing specific and delineated directions\nfor care. \"Directions for care\" means providing resources to\nensure the well-being of a patient based on symptoms and\ndisease progression.\nThe work of nurses has been described as both dirty and\ngood. McMurray (2011) considered what happened when\nnurses established specific roles and hierarchically organized\nprofessional divisions. Charting the struggles of a group of\nadvanced nurse practitioners, the article considered the ways\nin which claims to license, place, and mandate are employed\nto negotiate new occupational places. In a departure from\nsituations that place managerialism and entrepreneurialism\nabove professionalism, the article showed how the executive\nauthority that comes with entrepreneurial ownership could\nbolster professionalizing claims, thus disrupting and revers-\ning hierarchically organized professional divisions. In addi-\ntion, Simpson, Slutskaya, Lewis, and H\u00f6pfl, 2012) described\nthe complexity, fluidity, and contingency of dirty work--\nhow occupational boundaries, work practices, and the mean-\nings associated with dirt and cleanliness are accordingly\nmore fluid and subject to reinterpretation and change, rather\nthan being fixed, stable, and rooted in a job task--in addition\nto how individuals manage and construct the \"clean/dirty\"\ndivide and how dirty workers negotiate taint in the manage-\nment of identity.\nMission\nIn the present article, we analyzed the narratives of 11 nurses.\nDespite what was reported by Nagase et al. (2013) regarding\nthe spiritual distress of patients and the nurse's role in pro-\nviding spiritual care, the nurses interviewed spoke eloquently\nof their own nursing care, beliefs, policies, and so on. In the\nstudy by Nagase et al., researchers believed that nurses pro-\nvided spiritual care and could talk about their own spiritual\ncare; however, the nurses said that they did not provide spiri-\ntual care that patients evidently needed.\nWe used these data (Nagase et al., 2013) to clarify nurses'\ndiffering levels of dedication and conflict. We clarified that\nnursing is a professional occupation even without the use of\nnew technology. In this study, we define nurses' dedication\nas their strong love, care, and support for patients and their\nfamilies, as well as the expenditure of time or energy. In\naddition, we define nurses' conflict as a situation in which\nthere are opposing ideas, opinions, feelings, or wishes on\nnursing care for patients with intractable neurological dis-\neases in acute hospital setting.\nMethod\nSemistructured interviews using our own interview guide\nwere conducted during this qualitative descriptive study. To\ndate, little research has focused on nursing for patients with\nintractable neurological diseases in acute care hospitals. The\nquestions addressed to participants fell into the following\ncategories: the value of nursing, the patient's distress, and\nwhat they did and felt at work. We also asked what, based on\ntheir impressions and experiences, were the most important\nparts of treating patients and whether they experienced any\ninternal conflicts. Individual interviews were conducted in a\nquiet private room to protect privacy. One interviewer con-\nducted and recorded the interviews, which were then tran-\nscribed. The transcripts were then analyzed by four\nresearchers. The interviews lasted approximately 60 to 90\nmin per person, and took place between August 2011 and\nBefore the interview, we explained the purpose of the\nstudy, the methods, and ethical considerations, after which\nNagase et al. 3\neach participant gave written consent. A withdrawal form\nwas also distributed in advance for participants who might\nwish to leave the study after the interview. This study was\napproved by the Ethics Committee for the Faculty of Health\nCare and Nursing, Juntendo University. The mention of the\ntranscripts was anonymized, and the transcripts will be\ndestroyed after the end of this study.\nWe interviewed 11 nurses with experience in caring for\npatients with neurological intractable diseases; each had\nmore than 5 years of clinical experience in addition to more\nthan 3 years of experience in neurology wards. The senior\nnursing officer at each hospital was asked to select the par-\nticipants. While the right to withdraw was offered, no partici-\npant withdrew from the study. In addition, two acute care\nhospitals and three wards were involved.\nWe collected data through interviews and performed a\ncontinuous comparative analysis of the data as they were\nobtained.\nResults\nThe nurses had worked for 6 to 20 years as a nurse and for 6\nto 9 years of experience in a neurology ward. Five of all par-\nticipants had cared for only patients with brain or neurologi-\ncal diseases. The remaining five nurses of all had worked in\na mixed ward, including ophthalmology, orthopedics, and\nneurology facilities.\nThey talked about \"the basis of dedication,\" \"the conflict\nwith dedication,\" \"reorganization for maintaining dedica-\ntion,\" and \"the reason for the change from conflict to com-\nmitment\" (see Table 1). They experienced dedication and\nconflict both simultaneously and separately.\nThe Basis of Dedication\nCommitment to Patient Hope\nNurses are aware that intractable neurological diseases grad-\nually reduce the ability of patients to perform ADLs and ulti-\nmately render them unable to live independently. One\nparticipant said, \"There is limited time left for the patient and\nhis family. That's why we hope they value every minute of\nthe here and now.\" They thought that patients and their fami-\nlies should concentrate on the positive aspects of the\nsituation.\nIt was often too difficult to provide disabled patients with\nthe level of personal care that allows proper performance of\nADLs. Time and physical effort is necessary to fully support\nand care for these patients. For example, when a patient\nwants to sit in a chair, the nurses do not simply transfer him\nor her from the bed to a chair. Nurses must manage this trans-\nfer safely while keeping the patient comfortable. By moving\nto a chair, the patient can better talk with others, draw a pic-\nture, read a book, or use a computer. Thus, the nurses help\ntheir patients with intractable neurological diseases to live\nlife with dignity. However, they said that there are not enough\npersonnel to provide sufficient support to maintain the QOL\nof patients.\nPride in Their Own Nursing\nAll participants mentioned that they thought of the nursing\nprofession as more than just caring. One of the participants\nexpressed the following: \"Our nursing care allows patients to\nimprove their conditions. Improvement in the quality of life\nis the outcome of nurses' care, because nursing care is based\non nursing assessment.\"\nNursing care is also about recognizing the patient's pre-\nferred lifestyle and supporting that way of life and their val-\nues. Participants mentioned that nurses to help patients meet\nthe needs of daily life. The work is hard but also challenging\nand rewarding. The reason behind the nurses' comments is\ntheir belief that nurses are health care professionals. The\nmajority stated, \"Because we are nurses, we provide care on\nthe basis of evidence and think that we should do our best.\"\nPromoting the Progress of Recovery\nParticipants stated that an underlying belief in nursing care is\nthat neurological function will be restored and that nursing\ncare will use wisdom and innovative ideas to assist in the\nrecovery of the function. If nurses do not perform their\nduties, patients'physical abilities will rapidly decrease; how-\never, if nurses empower their patients, the patients may be\nable to live independently for much longer, which would\npromote patients' QOL. Nurses are deeply concerned about\nhaving a negative impact on patients' QOL, such as causing\nTable 1.

The following quote is an example of such\nremorse:\nI thought that there might have been a better way to do it. For\nexample, it might have been better if we had worked in\ncollaboration with the physical therapists more, or if we had\nasked a doctor for an adjustment of the medication. That way,\njust maybe, she [the patient] could walk now . . . but we need\nmuch more time, I think . . .\nThe Conflict With Dedication\nDifficulty in Sustaining Interest in Patients\nNurses who care for patients with intractable neurological\ndiseases use a great deal of time and energy. Doing all this\nwork alone leads to burnout. One participant said, \"If you\nwork in that ward long-term, or for a long time, you will lose\nyour mind.\" This was her concern; however, she also men-\ntioned that nurses are emotionally wounded when the dignity\nof their patient is not protected.\nYou think about how drastically the patient's life is altered when\nhe or she becomes unable to use the bathroom or to eat in\neveryday life . . . to provide care is such an unglamorous task . .\n. when you're changing diapers 30-odd times during a night\nshift, you just wonder what you're doing . . . you think to\nyourself, \"What am I doing with my life?\" . . . but, as difficult as\nit may be to merely change diapers or take a patient to the\nbathroom, I think you have to remember how important such\ncare is. Providing nursing care for patients with intractable\nneurological diseases is a really unglamorous task, and it's not at\nall dramatic . . . it really wears you down. (I know this might be\nwrong, but) I honestly think I can empathize well with family\nmembers who engage in abuse. For family members, care is a\n24-hr job. If someone were to tell me, \"You must stay in the\nward for 24 hours,\" I would quit. Without a doubt . . . so, in other\nwords, I'm up to my neck in working in this ward . . . when a\npatient's human dignity, for example going to the bathroom or\neating, is threatened, it throws his or her psyche out of kilter, and\ntakes a toll on us staff, too . . . if a patient says, \"I want to go to\nthe bathroom, but I can't\" or \"If I can't even go to the bathroom,\nI don't want to live,\" it's understandable. But, when the patient\nmakes a nurse call saying \"I want to go to the bathroom\" on an\nhourly basis, and you have to take the same patient to the\nbathroom over 10 times each night, you get driven to the point\nof insanity.\nSome nurses were seriously worried about not making a\ncommitment to the patient and had a guilty conscience.\nThese narratives refer to it (being difficult to sustain an inter-\nest in patients).\nPowerlessness or Impatience\nParticipants said that it was difficult for patients to under-\nstand that intractable neurological diseases are unlike cancer.\nIn the case of cancer patients, nurses can relieve pain and\nother symptoms, and prepare for the patient's death.\nHowever, in the case of patients with intractable neurological\ndiseases, the patient and their families, and even nurses and\nphysicians do not necessarily have to immediately deal with\nthe prospect of the patient's death. The patients try to stay\nalive as long as possible and do not give up on the possibility\nof further treatment, which can add to the time and energy\nspent by nurses in caring for these patients.\nSome of all participants also mentioned feeling helpless\nabout slowing the progression of the disease or preventing\nthe development of symptoms. Relapses disappoint patients\nand nurses.\n\"I can no longer do things (for instance, walk, eat, sit during the\nday, so on). Even though I want to go to the toilet, my legs don't\nmove! Then I don't want to keep living\" one patient says. But\nthese demands are a patient's right and they deserve dignity. So,\nwe say to patients, \"Shall we go to the toilet?\" But it is very\ndifficult work, and we are driven almost to the brink if a nurse\ncall for needing the bathroom sounds every hour or 10 times a\nnight. It is just what does really the truth. Exactly!\nHowever, one participant said, \"Nurses in other wards say\nthat nursing care should be rationed because of a limited\nworkforce and time.\" They do not understand the point of\ncare and do not think that such care requires a professional.\nThis may be because they are in acute care hospitals, where\nmedical care requires the use of new technologies. \"I often\nfeel bereft,\" said one participant.\nHesitation to Perform the Work\nCaring for patients with intractable neurological diseases\nmakes nursing students feel good. However, the students\nobtain a nursing qualification and begin to work with neuro-\nlogical patients, and the pleasure fades drastically. They\nwork desperately for the first few years instead of thinking\nabout better care. They mature as a nurse, and begin to doubt\nwhether the work they are doing is actually nursing. \"I\ncouldn't believe that our work is nursing when I was an inex-\nperienced nurse,\" some of the participants said.\nIn the first few years on the job, new nurses are working\nfrantically instead of thinking about providing better care.\nAfter several years, many nurses begin to experience doubts\nabout whether they made the right professional choice.\nMany complain that their responsibilities seem more similar\nto a care worker than a nurse. There is a national qualifica-\ntion in Japan for \"care workers.\" Care workers assist with\nthe daily life of the older people and disabled, but they are\nnot involved in health care. Thus, while some of their work\nNagase et al. 5\noverlaps that of nurses, care workers are not officially pro-\nfessional nurses.\nReorganization for Maintaining\nDedication\nConsidering the Division of Roles Between Staff\nNurses\nThe participants in this study were all expert nurses. Their\ndifficult work was made easier by younger nurses providing\nsome of the necessary care for ADLs. \"Younger nurses have\nsuch patients (seriously ill patients), and older nurses can\ntake care of other seriously ill patients,\" some participants\nsaid, in addition to, \"it wasn't as difficult and tough because\nof the younger nurses.\"\nInformation Sharing\nNurses share information regarding patient's care and cur-\nrent conditions. Some of the participants said, \"We want to\ntake care of any important needs for the patient.\"\nWhen each of the nurses understands the patient's needs, a lot of\ntime isn't required for nursing care, and we have less stress. The\nchief nurse is informed about the patient's needs and demands\nfrom staff nurses and shares how to care for the patient. We have\nconferences for such things.\nControlling Emotions\nNurses are dedicated to patients but not overly committed.\nParticipants said that they were able to shift certain emo-\ntional gears to keep from feeling depressed or bereft.\nReasons for the Change From Conflict\nto Commitment\nEncounters With Many Patients\nParticipants met many patients with intractable neurological\ndiseases and some of these patients became aware of the\namount of work required.\nAt first, I wasn't particularly concerned about patients with ALS\n(Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis). The reason is, I was a less\nexperienced nurse, I think.After I gained experience and became\nin charge of some ALS patients, the experience let me notice\ntheir suffering or hope. It's something that I understood only\nafter I've been experiencing it.\nFurthermore, participants commented that patients with\nintractable neurological diseases have survived and are often\ndetermined to defeat the illness. The reason for this is not\nclear, but the participants feel full of vitality or passion\nwithin the patients' own.\nFor example . . . if a patient catches pneumonia, physicians try\nto give him treatment for as long as necessary. I thought it's just\nthat. But the people who expect treatment are really the patient\nand his/her family. That's to say, the patient and his/her family\nprefer to get treatment rather than give up . . . I have been\nthinking that a person really survives until his end . . . that the\npatient lets me feel his will to live such as he has the will to eat\nsomething by mouth, or to walk or stand or sit.\nGaining Experience\nMost of the participants said that it was difficult to maintain\ndedication and concern. The majority of new nurses felt\n\"conflict with dedication\" and most of them changed to feel-\ning a sense of commitment because they gained experience\nand were at ease with themselves.\n. . . When I became a nurse, a lot of doubts arose because of that\nfeeling of still being a student . . . Then I had resigned myself to\nwhat cannot be helped . . . when I became competent in handling\nmy duties, and when I could understand our ward completely,\nother doubts arose in my mind again, like the right to self-\ndetermination or ethics.\nPride as a Nurse\nThe participants regained pride as nurses when they were\nable to persuade themselves that their work was truly nurs-\ning. In other words, nurses need to understand the meaning\nand effectiveness of nursing care, as well as persuade them-\nselves that they fulfill patients' needs and demands.\n\"How are we nurses different from other caregivers without a\nnurse's license?\" I've thought that. But there is a difference,\nclearly. Other caregivers help patients, but nurses attend to the\npatient as a whole . . . the basic human needs are satisfied for\npatients with intractable neurological diseases, and the\nfundamental human rights are demanded for them . . . that's just\nthe nursing care at this ward, I think. We shouldn't forget it.\nDiscussion\nBenner (1984) proposed a phenomenological nursing theory\ncomprising five stages in which nurses become experts. First\nis the novice stage, which refers to focusing only on patient\ndata, such as vital signs, regardless of the situation. Next, in\nthe advanced beginner stage, nurses begin to recognize and\nfocus on meaningful situations that occur repeatedly. In the\ncompetent stage, that is, the third stage, they can provide care\nbased on the nursing care plan. In this stage, nurses typically\nhave 2 to 3 years of experience in the same area or in similar\nday-to-day situations. In the proficient stage, that is, the\nfourth stage, nurses are able to understand the overall situa-\ntion. Finally, in the expert stage, they can intuitively grasp\nthe situation, and their performance is now fluid, flexible,\nand highly proficient.\n6 SAGE Open\nIn the present study, all participants were expert nurses.\nAt university hospitals in Japan, nurses generally accumulate\nexperience through 2- to 4-year ward rotations. Rarely does\na nurse work in one ward for more than 6 years. There are\nhardly any nurses limited to specific fields except advanced\npractice nurses (APNs), certified nurse specialists, and certi-\nfied nurses. Therefore, the present participants' experiences\nare very valuable.\nParticipants talked about their experiences, including\nwhat they thought, felt, and believed. They initially under-\ntook their jobs expecting to promote patient' needs and to\nprovide care to patients and their families; however, after a\nfew years, they were caught in a vicious cycle known as \"the\nconflict with dedication.\" They needed to find a reason to\nbecome recommitted (\"reasons for the change from conflict\nto commitment\"), and to develop their own strategies such as\n\"reorganization for maintaining dedication.\" Through this\nprocess, they experienced \"the basis of dedication.\"\nThe hospital nurse is fundamentally an organization\nmember; therefore, nurses are subordinate to hospital author-\nities and numerous physicians. In modern medicine, highly\ntechnological practices, such as those used in intensive care\nunits, mechanical heart and lung units, dialysis units, and\nmedical research, are considered most important. In other\nwords, nurses' commitments to their patients and the profes-\nsion's goals are not regarded as meaningful to medicine.\nThe MHLW, the Japanese Council of Nursing Universities,\nand the Japanese Council of Nursing are considered creating\na new APN designation in Japan. The APN system may offer\nprofessionalization and specialization for nurses within spe-\ncific medical fields. This internal stratification of professions\nis often rife with specialization. Professional tasks can be so\ncomplex that they require considerable specializations, and\nindividual professionals develop enduring identification\nwith specialty work. Our feeling is that if APN is adopted,\nother nurses may hold normal nursing in low regard because\nit is \"dirty work.\" The job of a nurse is both considered \"dirty\n\"tender loving care,\" as pointed out by Sandelowski (2000).\nIf anyone is able to perform the majority of \"unspecialized\"\nnursing tasks, nursing may no longer be considered profes-\nsional work. This is just one of the changes that institutional-\nization and specialization will bring with the introduction of\nan internal hierarchy (Hughes, 1951). This has been dis-\ncussed by numerous sociologists as the theory of profes-\nsions. It is difficult for nurses to accept this, and many nurses\nhave devised a stratagem to deal with professionalization.\nHowever, patients still need nursing care--the \"dirty\nwork\"--especially patients with intractable neurological dis-\neases. They require a high level of nursing care to lead satis-\nfying lives. Caring for these patients is really dirty work and\nnew technologies are not necessary. \"Dirty work\" refers to\nwork that nobody wishes to do. If the proposition that nurses\nwish to become specialists is true, they would not think that\ntheir work consists solely of taking care of patients. Some\nbelieve that \"advanced nursing practice\" involves nursing\npractice that utilizes the latest medical technology or is asso-\nciated with the latest treatment methods. As mentioned by a\nnumber of participants, neurology wards are not a popular\nchoice in terms of wards that novice nurses who have just\ngraduated from university wish to be assigned to. This is\nbecause the work performed in neurology wards appears at\nfirst glance to be \"simply providing care for patients,\" in\nother words, to resemble the work performed by care work-\ners. However, as pointed out by Nagase et al. (2013), the\nability to make clinical judgments and assessment ability\namong nurses are necessary for realizing a high patient QOL.\nThe nurses accepting these responsibilities should be rec-\nognized for performing \"true nursing\" and highly specialized\nwork. It is necessary to visualize and label nursing actions/\ninterventions, such as \"true nursing.\" Labeled actions and\ninterventions are recognized as a form of technology by both\nthe public and health care professionals (including diagnos-\ntic and spiritual care by nurses at the end of life); therefore,\nspiritual healing that nurses usually provide through attend-\ning to patients' daily needs should be labeled \"spiritual care\"\nand recognized as care by a nursing professional, as well as\nhighly specialized care. Presently, it is too easy to call spiri-\ntual healing just \"spiritual care,\" because the contents of\nspiritual care are poorly understood and nonsystematic.\nConclusion\nNurses were empowered to think positively and treat patients\nwith dignity while remaining committed to the physical care\nof their patients. Such care requires time and effort, as well\nas considerable risk. Participants in the present study talked\nnot only about their current thoughts and experiences but\nalso about past experiences. They expected nursing to be a\ngood job and were dedicated to their patients; however, after\na few years, they got caught up in a vicious cycle known as\n\"the conflict with dedication.\" They had to rebuild pride as\nnurses and recommit to the profession to find \"reasons for\nthe change from conflict to commitment\" and to develop\ntheir own strategies, such as \"reorganization for maintaining\ndedication.\" Through this process, they acquired \"the basis\nof dedication.\"\n"
