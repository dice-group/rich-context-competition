The children of long-lived parents may therefore age\nmore successfully than the children of short-lived parents.\nMethods. We used three major cross-sectional population-\nbased surveys to study the association of parental longevity\nwith successful aging in offspring. The measures of aging were\nhand-grip strength, cognitive performance (Mini Mental State\nExamination and a cognitive composite score), self-reported\ndiseases, and self-rated health.\nResults. For every additional 10 years the parents lived, their\nchildren's grip strength increased by 0.32 kg (95% CI \nparental life was associated with a reduction by approximately\n0.20 in the adjusted odds ratio for their children having each\nof the following conditions: diabetes; hypertension; ischemic\nheart disease; heart failure; stroke; or fair, poor, or very poor\nself-rated health. Almost all the effects were seen solely in the\ncohort of 70-year-olds, but not among middle-aged or nona-\ngenarian subjects.\nConclusions. Parental life span is positively associated with\nthe children's physical and cognitive functioning and avoid-\nance of some of the common chronic diseases. However, the\neffects are small and are seen among offspring who are\nelderly, but not among the middle-aged or the oldest old.\nKey words: aging, twins, oldest-old, parents, longevity, hand strength, cognition.\nMaintenance of high physical and cognitive\nfunctioning and avoidance of disease and dis-\nability are central to \"successful\" aging.1 Ever\nsince Rowe and Kahn1 introduced the concept of suc-\ncessful aging, a number of mainly environmental predic-\ntors (eg, education, income, social network, physical\nactivity, and smoking status) have been shown to influ-\nence the components of successful aging.2,3 In recent\nyears, researchers have also begun to investigate the\ncontribution of genetic factors to successful aging.4\u00ad6\nStudies of elderly twins suggest that genetic factors ac-\ncount for a substantial proportion of the variance in\nphysical7 and cognitive8,9 functioning, and a moderate\nproportion of variance in life span.10 An important ge-\nnetic component to some of the major diseases of aging,\nsuch as cardiovascular diseases,11 diabetes and impaired\nglucose tolerance,12 and some cancers (breast, prostate,\nand colorectal),13 has also been found. Long-lived indi-\nviduals are rare and may be selected in part for the\ngenetic factors that promote successful aging. The chil-\ndren of long-lived parents may therefore age more suc-\ncessfully than the children of short-lived parents. What-\never the mechanism, not much is known about the\ninterplay between parental longevity and the aging of\noffspring. Here we use three major Danish nationwide\nsurveys of middle-aged, elderly, and oldest-old people to\nstudy the association of parental life span with the re-\nspondents' physical and cognitive functioning, as well as\nspecific illnesses.\nMethods\nSample\nThe sample comprised participants in three nation-\nwide population-based surveys: the Study of Middle-\nAged Danish Twins (MADT),14 the Longitudinal Study\nFrom the 1Institute of Public Health, Epidemiology, and 3Danish Center for\nDemographic Research, University of Southern Denmark, Odense; 2Department\nof Psychology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN; and 4Max Planck\nInstitute for Demographic Research, Rostock, Germany.\nAddress correspondence to: Henrik Frederiksen, Institute of Public Health,\nEpidemiology, University of Southern Denmark, Sdr.

In brief, participants\nin the MADT and LSADT studies were identified in the\nsurvey were identified in the Danish Civil Registration\nSystem, both nationwide, population-based registers\nthat are continuously updated. The eligible participants\nin the MADT study represented a random sample of 120\n1952. The eligible participants in the LSADT were\nsurveys were conducted in periods of 3\u00ad6 months in\n2,262). All three studies used a highly comparable struc-\ntured interview, which was home-based and included\nphysical and cognitive testing performed by lay inter-\nviewers from the Danish National Institute of Social\nResearch. All interviewers had substantial experience\ninterviewing the elderly and furthermore completed a\ndetailed training program by a physician and were\nclosely monitored during the interview periods.\nAll studies were approved of by the Danish scientific\nethical committees, and all participants provided in-\nformed consent.\nParental Age at Death\nInformation on parental age at death was obtained\nduring the interview in the LSADT and 1905 studies\nthe MADT study. The twins within the intact pairs\n(both twins in a pair participating) reported their fa-\nther's age at death with a correlation of 0.99 (95%\nstudy, and their mother's age at death with a correlation\nMADT and LSADT studies both twins in a pair were\nexcluded if they differed by 5 or more years in their\nreport of either their father's or mother's age at death\n(N  244 individuals). The average of the fathers' and\nmothers' ages at death, as well as fathers' and mothers'\nages at death separately, was used in the analyses.\nPhysical Functioning\nHand-grip strength, which has been shown to reflect\noverall muscle strength,18 was measured with a hand\ndynamometer (Smedley's dynamometer TTM, Tokyo).\nWe identified the maximum value of three measures\nwith each hand in the LSADT and MADT studies, and\nof three measures with the preferred hand in the 1905\nstudy. Participants with fewer than three attempts, or\nwith a difference of 20 kg or more between two mea-\nsures, were excluded from this analysis (N  268).\nCognitive Functioning\nIntegrated in the interview was a series of cognitive\ntests including the Mini Mental State Examination\n(MMSE) (in the LSADT and the 1905 studies only), a\ntest of fluency (number of animals named in 1 minute),\nforward and backward digit span, and a modified 12-\nword learning test. The scores of the four latter tests\nwere standardized and summed to form a cognitive com-\nposite score that was used in the analysis.\nHealth\nIn all surveys the participants were asked whether a\nphysician had ever told them that they suffered from\nvarious diseases. Participants who answered \"Yes, previ-\nously\" or \"Yes, currently\" were subsequently asked to\nconfirm that this was a diagnosis made by a doctor,\nbefore the answer was accepted as valid.\nData Analysis\nWe divided participants into five groups by average\n85) and compared these groups with regard to physical\nand cognitive functioning as well as a number of self-\nreported diseases. Several potential confounding charac-\nteristics (body mass index, smoking habits, alcohol con-\nsumption, and education) were confirmed to be\nunrelated to parental life span. Both parents were de-\nceased for about half of the participants in the MADT\nstudy. In the LSADT study only 15 participants had one\nparent still alive, and in the 1905 cohort study none of\nthe participants had living parents. All measures were\nage- and sex-adjusted by subtracting age (in 5-year in-\ntervals) and sex-specific means from the actual scores.19\nThe residuals are presented in the figures. In all subse-\nquent analyses, participants with parents who on average\ndied before age 54 were excluded (N  243) as a result\nof the large proportion of deaths not related to the\nbiology of aging (eg, accidents and suicides) before this\nage. After this, the effect of increasing the mean parental\nage at death by 10 years was assessed by entering the\ncategorized value as a continuous measure in a multivar-\niate linear regression model for continuous outcomes\n(grip strength and cognitive tests) or in a logistic regres-\nsion model for dichotomous outcomes (self-reported dis-\neases), controlling for the age and sex of the participants.\nA model with parental age at death as a continuous\nvariable and a model with parental age at death in\n10-year groups gave virtually the same results and com-\nparable Bayesian information criteria. To account for\nthe nonindependence of the observations on twins,\ntwins from pairs in which both participated were ana-\nlyzed as clusters of two in the multivariate models. Thir-\nand the LSADT survey. The data from both surveys of\nthese participants were used in the analyses because they\nwere so few and sampled with an interval of 6 months.\nResults\nTable 1 shows the basic characteristics of the partic-\nipants in the three surveys. Table 2 shows the number of\nparticipants across categories of parental longevity.

In the\ner's, and both parents' age at death within 4 years.\nMean parental age at death was only modestly asso-\nciated with physical and cognitive functioning, as seen\nin Figures 1\u00ad3 and Table 3. For each 10-year increase in\nparental life span, average grip strength increased by\neffect was seen only in the LSADT cohort (mean age\nmid-70s), but not among the twins who were middle-\naged (MADT), or the cohort of nonagenarians (1905).\nLikewise, the relation of cognitive functioning to paren-\ntal age at death was seen solely in the LSADT cohort;\neach 10-year increase in parental age at death was asso-\ncomposite points (Table 3). The analyses used for Table\n3 were repeated using parental age at death as a contin-\nuous variable in the multivariate linear regression mod-\nels. The coefficients were, when multiplied by 10, vir-\ntually identical to the ones in Table 3 (results not\nshown).\nA number of self-reported diseases were associated\nwith parental life span (Table 4). Again the effect was\nmainly present in the LSADT cohort. In this cohort the\nage- and sex-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for having either\nprevious or current diabetes, hypertension, ischemic\nheart disease, heart failure, or stroke each decreased by\nroughly 0.20 for every 10-year increase in mean parental\nage at death (Table 4). Also, the odds for having fair,\npoor, or very poor self-rated health were associated with\nMADT and LSADT cohorts by 10-year increase in\nparental age at death. Pulmonary disease, cancer, osteo-\narthritis, and osteoporosis were not associated with pa-\nTABLE 1.

In the 1905\ncohort, parental life span was not associated with any\ndisease or self-rated health. In the MADT cohort there\nwas a borderline association of parental life span with\nhypertension and stroke, but not with any other disease\n(Table 4). Because the associations observed between\nparental life span and stroke, ischemic heart disease, and\nheart failure could reflect confounding from the associ-\nation also seen with hypertension and diabetes, we sub-\nsequently used a model for stroke, ischemic heart dis-\nease, and heart failure including hypertension and\ndiabetes only in the LSADT sample. The point esti-\nmates from these models for these three diseases were\nvirtually unaltered.\nDiscussion\nThe relationship between long-lived parents and suc-\ncessful aging has been reported in one previous paper.20\nVaillant studied a cohort of 188 males age 65 years who\nfrom the top half of their classes in college (Harvard\nUniversity). When the 16% with longest maximum\nancestral longevity were compared with the 16% with\nshortest ancestral longevity, long-lived ancestors pre-\ndicted \"sustained health\" on a crude 1\u00ad5 scale.\nA number of issues in our study need to be addressed.\nThe information about parental life span was based on\nself-report from the participants, which could be subject\nto error, although it is reassuring that the twins within\nthe intact pairs reported their parents' age at death with\nhigh correlations. The proportion able to report the\nparental age at death (3 years) compared with death\ncertificates has previously been found in Sweden to be\nTo estimate the effect of potential misclassification of\nparental age at death, we repeated the analyses exclud-\ning those in which the interviewers stated that the\ninterview was completed with difficulties (of any kind\nand severity) (N  1,324). The point estimates after this\nrestriction were very similar to those reported here,\nalthough the confidence intervals widened.\nWe report here the results of the analyses using the\naverage of the mothers' and fathers' age at death as the\ncovariate of interest. This approach enabled us to use the\nFIGURE 3.

However, the results were not sys-\ntematically different between the two (results not\nshown). The results from the participants with one or\ntwo parents still alive were censored from the analyses.\nAs seen in Table 2, the number of participants omitted\nfor this reason was only considerable in the MADT\ncohort and may have contributed to the lack of associ-\nation between parental age at death and the outcomes in\nthis cohort.\nParticipants who did not provide information on pa-\nrental age at death were more cognitively impaired than\nthe rest (Figures 2\u00ad3). These participants were also ap-\nparticipants without missing information (mean 70.9 \n15.8). The direction of the potential bias introduced by\nthe lack of information from these participants is not\nevident.\nWhen analyzing MMSE score as the outcome, we\nused methods that rely on a normal distribution of the\ndata. Because the MMSE score is highly skewed, we\nrepeated the regressions using bootstrap methods.22 The\nconfidence intervals differed only in the third decimal\nplace (data not shown).\nWe found that parental life span is associated with\nphysical and cognitive functioning and health in the\ncohort of 70 year olds. Age-related differences in func-\ntioning and health among middle-aged individuals may\nnot be large enough to detect a small effect of parental\nlongevity. In the nonagenarian 1905 cohort, it would\nhave been surprising if parental life span had had an\nimpact, because reaching an age of 92 may in itself be\nregarded as successful aging.\nIn conclusion, we found that at older ages parental\nlife span is positively associated with physical and cog-\nnitive functioning and avoidance of some of the quan-\ntitatively important diseases. However, the overall ef-\nfects are small in absolute terms and are seen only among\nTABLE 3.
