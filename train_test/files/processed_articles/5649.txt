    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis study aims to investigate how a group of Chinese university teachers developed their cognitive models by using \"English\nas a Foreign Language (EFL) teachers\" metaphors. The research method includes an open-ended questionnaire, a checklist\nquestionnaire, and verbal reports. The goal for this research is twofold. First, we will present those metaphors we believe\nto be the most frequently used or most central in shaping the thoughts or ideas they have had for EFL teaching and learning.\nSecond, we will provide a description of their internal process of developing cognitive models, as well as factors that could\naccount for such models. The findings showed that (a) most of us had three ways of understanding EFL teachers in terms of\nthe educational journey metaphor, the educational building metaphor, and the educational conduit metaphor; (b) we used\nsuch a cluster of converging cognitive models as the instructor model, the transmitter model, and the builder model to\nconstruct definitions for EFL teachers, with the instructor model as a central model; and (c) metaphor can actually serve as a\nuseful, effective, and analytic tool for making us aware of the cognitive model underlying our conceptual framework.\n",

Language\nteaching and learning are no exception. With the new ideas\nof cognitive science introduced into language education,\nresearchers are looking beyond the mere examination of\nteacher behaviors and are studying teacher cognitions from\nBrown and Barid (1993) have recommended a more compre-\nhensive study of the wide variety of teachers' cognitions and\ntheir relationship to a broader repertoire of teaching actions\nin the classroom. Artzt and Thomas (2012) have conducted a\nsystematic investigation on a relationship between teacher's\ninstructional practice and their underlying cognitive models\nfrom a cognitive perspective, with the findings that knowl-\nedge, beliefs, and goals directly have formed a network of\ncognitive models that direct and control the instructional\nbehaviors of teachers in the classroom. Teacher cognition has\nplayed an active role in classroom decision making and is cru-\ncial to the process of teaching. Understanding teacher cogni-\ntion as a means of being better able to understand what it is to\nbe a language teacher is very fundamental (Borg, 2006). Work\nexamining the \"processes\" of teacher cognition is, to some\ndegree, correlated to significant change in teacher trainee's\nbelief, which would comprise teachers' professional practice\nimportance of examining teachers' cognitive models.\nFor English as a Second Language (ESL) or English as a\nForeign Language (EFL) teachers, the identification and\nresearch into cognitive models they develop can be a basis\nfor enabling them to voice their internal thought on their\ninstructional practice and underlying cognitions in a struc-\ntured, comprehensive manner. A close examination of the\ncognitive models may not only provide them with some\ninsights into their knowledge structure, but also provide ESL\nor EFL teachers with the same awareness, which, in turn, can\nhelp them to reorganize or make adjustments to their instruc-\ntional practice.

According to Lakoff (1987), people organize\nknowledge by means of structures called idealized cognitive\nmodels (ICMs), which, in turn, allow them to theorize, con-\nstruct, and understand the world. Such models come from\nfour sources: Fillmore's frame semantics, Lakoff and\nJohnson's theory of metaphor and metonymy, Langacker's\ncognitive grammar, and Fauconnier's theory of mental\nspaces (Lakoff, 1987). These models are derived from basic\nprinciples of cognition (Anderson & Lebiere, 1998). A cog-\nnitive model is a coherent, in large part nonlinguistic, knowl-\nedge structure, and a representation of multimodal conceptual\nentities (Evans, 2006) that can be used as a basis for percep-\ntual simulations (see Barsalou, 1999; and others, for exam-\nLakoff (1999) has established a theory of embodied cog-\nnition and claimed that our concepts and forms of reason\narise from our bodily structures, sensorimotor experiences,\nand interactions with the environment. In their claim, they\nhave also identified the importance of imaginative capacities\nand metaphor in cognition, without which we could not fur-\nther structure or understand our experience. Another one of\nthe most important claims they have made is that we are usu-\nally unaware of our thought process, which has been referred\nto as \"backstage cognition\" by Fauconnier (1994). In sum-\nmary, cognitive models relate to coherent bodies of knowl-\nedge, procedural knowledge, and knowledge of more abstract\nentities. They are built from our personal interaction with the\nsurrounding environment both linguistically and non-\nlinguistically, modified and renewed by ongoing experience.\nAs for the way cognitive models of ESLor EFLteachers are\nstudied, a number of researchers in language teacher education\nhave demonstrated that metaphors represent cognitive and\naffective distillations of teachers' fundamental knowledge\nabout teaching (Cortazzi & Jin, 1996). Metaphor, as a mediat-\ning psychological tool, plays an important role in cognitive\nmodeling, and is held to serve as evidence of its role in structur-\ning not only how we talk but also how we think and act (Lakoff,\n1984). The essence of metaphor is seen in how one mental\ndomain is conceptualized in terms of another (Lakoff, 1993).\nAccording to Lakoff and Johnson, metaphor is what makes our\nabstract thought possible, and a large part of self-understanding\nis the search for appropriate personal metaphors that make\nsense of our lives. The purpose of self-understanding is the\ncontinual development of new life stories about ourselves.\nMetaphors can serve as a means for teachers to verbalize their\n\"professional identity\" and have, thus, played an important\nrole in teachers'personal practical knowledge. In other words,\nmetaphors can indicate the way teachers think about teaching\nand, therefore, direct the way they act in the classroom\nmediate understanding of their beliefs about teaching in the\nclassroom and accordingly to predict behaviors likely to fol-\nlow from them (de Guerrero & Villamil, 2002). Provenzo,\nMcCloskey, Kottkamp, and Cohn (1989) have pointed out that\nit is only by a process of critical reflection on metaphors that\nlanguage teachers can understand and combine the unknown\ninto what they already know. Hart (2009) has conducted an\nintensive investigation into the effects of sharing and discuss-\ning metaphors for cognition in terms of writing and found that\ndiscussing metaphors can promote mutual understanding\nbetween students and teachers and, thus, resolve classroom\nconflicts. In a sense, metaphors can function as a powerful tool\nin gaining insight into students' and teachers' cognition (Li,\n2011). Metaphor is a useful way of bringing implicit assump-\ntions to awareness, encouraging reflection, finding contradic-\ntions, and fostering change in educational beliefs and practices\n(see, for example, Cameron & Maslen, 2010; de Guerrero &\nRecognizing the critical role metaphors play in conceptu-\nalizing fields of knowledge, educational researchers have\nbeen using metaphor as a research tool to investigate lan-\nguage teacher's cognition (Cameron & Low, 1999). The\nstudy of teachers' metaphors appears to be a fruitful, indi-\nrect way to reveal important aspects of teachers' cognition:\nfor example, how teachers plan or make decisions, or how\nthey give meaning to their experience (Munby, 1986). In\nshort, metaphor is an essential mental tool, which should be\nharnessed as an instrument of imaginative rationality\n(Lakoff & Johnson, 1980), or a problem-solving device\napplicable to all fields, including language learning and\nteaching. Metaphors have a function of organizing system-\natic concepts in teacher's cultural-cognitive models of learn-\ning (Riley, 1997). It has been documented that metaphor has\na preponderant place as a cognitive tool (Green, 1993; Petrie\nThus, one method of making EFL teachers more aware of\ntheir cognitive models is to encourage them to examine the\nway they use metaphors to describe their understanding of\nlanguage teaching.\nThe Study\nResearch Questions\nThis empirical research was designed to address three ques-\ntions as follows:\nXiong et al. 3\nResearch Question 1: How do Chinese EFL university\nteachers use metaphors to describe their beliefs concern-\ning English teachers?\nResearch Question 2: What cognitive models do Chinese\nEFL university teachers develop by using such metaphors?\nResearch Question 3: What are the factors that might\nresult in the differences in EFL teachers' cognitive\nmodels?\nParticipants\nThere were two groups of participants taking part in this\nstudy during two stages. The first group participating in the\nstudy during the first stage was comprised of 20 EFL univer-\nsity teachers randomly selected from 11 Chinese universities\n(5 engineering colleges and 6 regular universities), most of\nthem are Chinese visiting scholars to the University of\nCalifornia (UC), Berkeley or other universities so as to\nensure the representativeness and reliability of the samples.\nAll the participants of this study have at least 8 years of\nEnglish teaching experience, 18 of whom have received PhD\ndegrees in applied linguistics or American literature.\nThe second group was comprised of 30 EFL teachers ran-\ndomly selected from the Department of Foreign Language at a\nuniversity in China. Compared with the first group, the degrees\nthe second group have received are comparatively lower, and\n95% of them have just received MA degrees in linguistics or\nliterature. In total, 15 participants from the second group have\nadmitted taking part in some professional teaching training\nbefore or after their engagement in English teaching.\nInstruments\nThree methods were used in the whole research: The first\nmethod was an open-ended questionnaire, the second method\nwas a checklist questionnaire, and the third method was ver-\nbal reports. Below is a detailed description of each.\nOpen-ended questionnaire.To validate how efficiently EFL\nteachers could generate metaphors to make sense of their\nown experiences and understanding of the English language,\nteaching, and learning in a very natural way, a questionnaire\n(Appendix A) was worked out and conducted among the first\ngroup of 20 EFL university teachers during the first stage in\nframework on metaphor elicitation and consisted of two\nparts: (a) their demographical information, such as educa-\ntional background, current academic position, years of teach-\ning experience, and so on; and (b) a metaphor elicitation task\nby asking them to complete three specific open-ended ques-\ntions: (i) An English teacher is . . . , because . . . ; (ii) English\nlearning means . . . ; and (iii) The English language is . . . . To\nensure the validity of questionnaire results, all the participants\nin the first group were required to write down at least three\nsentences but not more than five as the answers to each ques-\ntion in metaphorical language, the length of each sentence\nbeing limited to 10 words, for in this way, participants would\nbe prevented from using a single metaphor repeatedly while\nothers would use a broader range. All of these instructions\nwere given orally before the questionnaire. As the research\naims to investigate how participants used metaphors to\ndescribe their very basic cognitive beliefs as EFL teachers, it\ndoes not matter whether they use the same conceptual meta-\nphors repeatedly. All the data obtained from this part would\nserve as the basis for the checklist questionnaire.\nChecklist questionnaire. The author has collected 60 sentences\nfrom the first group of participants in the open-ended question-\nnaire. After that, the author analyzed all the sentences through\nthe traditional approach outlined by Cameron and Low (1999)\nand found that only 20 of them were analyzable and, therefore,\nvalid. To illuminate underlying themes in our participants'\nresponses, the authors systematically examined some influential\nbooks in the field of both language teaching and general educa-\nVygotsky, 1978) and included four metaphors (English teacher\nas competitor, mind-and-behavior controller, repeater, and\nentertainer) from studies conducted by other researchers\n(Oxford et al., 1998) as well as two metaphorical statements\n(English teacher as conduit and nurturer) made by educational\ntheorists and methodologists (Oxford et al., 1998), all six meta-\nphors being common and popular in the field of EFL teaching\n(Oxford et al., 1998). Combined with the above-mentioned\nmetaphors, a checklist questionnaire consisting of 26 metaphors\n(Appendix B) was distributed to the second group of 30 EFL\nteachers randomly selected from the Department of Foreign\nLanguage at a university in China. The questionnaire was\ndesigned to address two questions: (a) How similar or different\nare EFL teachers' metaphors of the English language teaching\nand learning compared with the group members? and (b) How\nare the metaphors EFL teachers have generated in their instruc-\ntional practice linked to their cognitive models?\nVerbal reports.There are a variety of procedures that could\nbe used to investigate how human beings think through tasks,\namong which verbal reports are considered as an appropriate\ndata source (Hamilton, Nussbaum, & Snow, 1997; Leighton\nal's description of his or her internal processes and, there-\nfore, is used to develop cognitive models (Ericsson & Simon,\n1993). Verbal reports are usually conducted using one-to-one\ninterviews. Thus, in this research, to investigate the factors\ndetermining differences in cognitive models, 10 EFL teach-\ners were asked to verbalize every thought that came to mind\nwhen the metaphor was generated or selected.\nThe questions from the interview are shown inAppendix C.\nData Collection and Analysis\nAll the linguistic metaphors EFL teachers generated to\ndescribe their knowledge about English language teaching and\nlearning, and selected from other studies, were first coded and\n4 SAGE Open\nthen categorized into conceptual metaphors by following the\ntraditional approach created by Cameron and Low (1999),\nwhich involves four steps: (a) naming/labeling, (b) sorting\n(clarification and elimination), (c) categorization, and (d)\nanalyzing data (also see Saban & Kocbeker, 2007).\nAccordingly, each linguistic metaphor was analyzed to iden-\ntify three elements: a source domain (i.e., an English teacher),\na target domain (i.e., the term with which the source domain\nis compared), and a source-to-target mapping (i.e., a struc-\ntural correlation between a source domain and a target\ndomain). Then, based on the inferential structure of the meta-\nphor, on the entailments, and on the similarities with other\nmetaphors, three conceptual categories were generated from\nthe 26 metaphors, and they were ranked from the most fre-\nquently chosen to the least frequently chosen. One point the\nauthor attempted to make is that there seems to be no corre-\nspondence between the number of metaphors participants\nused and the frequency of metaphors as options. As shown in\nTable 1, we have nine options for the \"journey\" metaphor, 13\nfor the \"building\" metaphor, and four for the \"conduit\" meta-\nphor, but the most frequently used metaphor is the journey\nmetaphor (T 147), rather than the building metaphor (T 136).\nResults\nTable 1 shows the three conceptual categories and the total\nnumber of participants who used each conceptual metaphor,\nwhich are represented by the alphanumeric code T 147, T\n136, and T 40, respectively. It also can be seen from Table 1\nthat there were some differences in interpretations of images\nand emphasis of EFL teachers in the categories of journey,\nbuilding, and conduit metaphors, although not so marked.\nThree Main Categorizations of Metaphors\nTable 1 lists 26 distinct metaphors, which were later classi-\nfied as species of the three conceptual metaphors. It is impor-\ntant to stress that the author was not only seeking to identify\nevery metaphor used in the text but also to present those EFL\nteachers believed to be the most frequently used or most cen-\ntral in shaping their thoughts or ideas when it comes to EFL\nteaching and learning, based on the results of the checklist\nquestionnaire.\nEducational journey metaphor. We start with this perspective\nbecause, from all the responses to either the open-ended\nquestionnaire or the checklist questionnaire we received, this\nwas the most prevalent and frequently used image of EFL\nidentified two common ways we structure the events: the\nLocation Event-Structure and the Object Event-Structure\nmetaphors, both of which make use of the primary meta-\nphors Causes Are Forces and Changes Are Movements. In\nthe Location Event-Structure metaphor, events are conceptu-\nalized as a change of states viewed as movement from one\nbounded region in space to another with a desired location\n(destination) as goal or purpose. Therefore, we can move\nfrom one state to another over a period time to reach a final\nstate. In the Object Event-Structure metaphor, events are\nconceptualized as the acquisition or loss of attributes viewed\nas possessable objects. For instance, Harry can get a head-\nache or lose his headache. Therefore, purposes are conceptu-\nalized in this metaphor as desired objects--things you want\nto get.\nAs specific types of events, EFL teaching and learning are\noften conceptualized in terms of these same metaphors.\nGiven the Location Event-Structure metaphor, English lan-\nguage teachers and learners start from their first language,\nand move along the path toward the desired purpose as des-\ntination. In this case, EFL teaching and learning can be\nviewed as a journey with a number of intermediate purposes,\nwhich is in accordance with what Lakoff (1999) has outlined\nin Long-Term Activities Are Journeys metaphor, derived\nfrom the Location Event-Structure metaphor, where EFL\nlearners are travelers and teachers serve as guide. The cur-\nriculum can provide a plan or itinerary. This is referred to as\nthe educational journey metaphor. EFL teachers in this cate-\ngory were described either as tour guide (T 26), or instructor\nTable 1. Summary of Categorization of Metaphors.\nCategories Participants\nEducational journey metaphor 147\n English teacher as instructor 24\n English teacher as director 17\n English teacher as tour guide 26\n English teacher as candle 11\n English teacher as bridge to different cultures 20\n English teacher as lover 10\n English teacher as nurturer 15\n English teacher as learning partner 15\n English teacher as entertainer 9\nEducational building metaphor 136\n English teacher as manufacturer 11\n English teacher as competitor 3\n English teacher as judge 9\n English teacher as doctor 12\n English teacher as mind-behavior controller 4\n English teacher as coach 20\n English teacher as flintstone 12\n English teacher as engineer 10\n English teacher as machine 8\n English teacher as parent 7\n English teacher as scaffolder 11\n English teacher as cook 7\n English teacher as activity designer 19\nEducational conduit metaphor 40\n English teacher as envoy 10\n English teacher as conduit 10\n English teacher as a repeater 9\n English teacher as ambassador 11\nXiong et al. 5\n(T 24), or director (T 17), or learning partner (T 15) who can\nwalk learners from a beginning, help set study goals, and\nfind the right path to reach the goals. If students were hin-\ndered by difficulties from moving forward, or if something\nblurred their learning, teachers would be responsible for aid-\ning or providing more instructional support to allow them to\nmove along the learning path, just as a candle (T 11) or a\nbridge (T 20) functions. Besides, in China, a compulsory\nEnglish exam has exerted heavy pressure on students since\nthey started university. It is, therefore, not surprising to expe-\nrience what is called anxiety or low motivation in the process\nof English learning. Thus, EFL teachers are expected to show\ncompassion and listen empathically to them to help reduce\nsuch anxiety in a way a nurturer (T 15) or a lover (T 10)\nbehaves. Because a journey may have a guide who points out\nthings of interest along the way, learners also expect their\nteachers to be just like an entertainer (T 9) so as to stimulate\ntheir interest in English language learning.\nEducational building metaphor.This metaphor is very com-\nmon and popular in the education and psychological litera-\nture. In the building metaphor, five aspects are emphasized:\ncontent, progress, basicness, strength, and structure, referred\nto by Lakoff and Johnson (1980) as the Argument Is a Build-\ning metaphor. In this metaphor, the outer shell and founda-\ntion of the building constitute the content. Basicness lies in\nthe building's foundation, the deeper, the more basic.\nStrength shows how strong or weak the internal connection\nis and consists of both the building's capacity to maintain an\nupright and balanced posture and capacity to withstand\nexternal force and harm. Structure refers to shape, form, and\noutline of the building. In the belief that education is primar-\nily concerned with constructing the mind and character of\nevery child and therefore can ensure the well-being of soci-\nety, students are taken as objects, school as a factory, and the\nteacher as machine (T 8), manufacturer (T 11), controller\n(T 4), and engineer (T 10), shaping the student into the pre-\nscribed mold by strictly following a set of standardized sci-\nentific practices. In addition, an increasing demand for a\ncompliant, faithful, skilled, and knowledgeable workforce\nhas framed students in a very passive role, where teachers are\nportrayed as competitor (T 3), doctor (T 12), judge (T 9),\ncoach (T 20), strict parent (T 7), and activity designer (T 19),\nwho have had absolute dominance and implemented rules. In\nthe above situation, teachers were encouraged to have strict\ncontrol over students, and treat students as a standardized\nsocial product rather than a creative individual. The goal of\nlearning was to shape students into mechanical and passive\nindividuals, who waited to be led by others into a prescribed\nset of skills, knowledge, or values.\nTeacher as scaffolder (T 11) suggests a very different edu-\ncational building metaphor. The scaffolding, as a temporarily\nerected structure used to support a building under construc-\ntion, can be gradually removed bit by bit, when the building\nitself emerges and grows stronger and more stable. It fits the\nwhere the teacher just provides basic structural guidance and\nassistance, which is progressively withdrawn as students\nmove toward mastery of a particular skill or activity. The\nscaffolding is constructed by a teacher and later gradually\nremoved, as the structure of the students'learning is gradually\nbuilt up. This metaphor is now widely used in education.\nEducational conduit metaphor. As illustrated above, two of the\nmost fundamental metaphors of structuring events are the\nObject Event-Structure metaphor and the Location Event-\nStructure metaphor. Based on the Object Event-Structure\nmetaphor, English language teaching can be conceptualized\nas transmission, which involves the transmitting or deliver-\ning of knowledge to learners, whereas learning can be acqui-\nsition, which involves the acquisition or reception of\nknowledge from teachers. This fits what Michael Reddy\n(1993) has referred to as the teacher as conduit metaphor,\nwhere the teacher (unidirectional information-giver) puts\nideas (objects) into words (containers) and transmits them\n(through a conduit) to a student (information-receptor) who\ntakes the idea/objects out of the word/containers. In the met-\naphor of teacher as conduit (T 40), the English language is\ntaken as an object of study, and the language teacher must\nexert strong control over both the content and the students,\nwhich is actually an instance of Achieving a Purpose Is\nAcquiring an Object, an entailment of the Object Event-\nStructure metaphor. The metaphor Achieving a Purpose Is\nAcquiring an Object pertains not just to communication, and\nto arriving at satisfying interpretations of linguistic forms,\nbut to any attempt to achieve a purpose. This is in line with\nwhat the conduit metaphor entails. In all of these metaphors,\nEFL teachers were compared to conduit (T 10), envoy (T 10),\nambassador (T 11), and repeater (T 9), all considering\nthe teacher as an information or cultural transmitter who\ntreated language as an end or object rather than as a means of\ncommunication.\nTeachers' Responses to the Open-Ended\nQuestionnaire and Interviews\nIn the open-ended questionnaire, the 20 EFL teachers were\ninvited to answer the three questions concerning English\nteachers, English teaching, and English learning in meta-\nphors. The results showed some agreement with respect to\nteacher as \"instructor,\" \"director,\" \"tour guide,\" \"flintstone,\"\n\"cultural transmitter,\" \"builder,\" \"engineer,\" and \"bridge.\"\nWhen asked what was the key role EFL teachers can play, 20\nagreed with the \"instructor\" and \"director\" metaphors and\nindicated that they were their initial belief about the role of\nEFL teachers, while 15 insisted on the view that EFL teach-\ners should be an assistant or tour guide during the English-\nteaching-learning process, help the students through the\nprocess, and lead them to a destination. As to the question\nregarding the way to conceptualize EFL teachers, 8 assumed\n6 SAGE Open\nTable 2. Individual Interview.\nItems Category Number\n1 Reasons for selecting the metaphors: \n Folk model (very common and basic knowledge) 10\n Educational theory learning (influence from pedagogical learning) 6\n Years of teaching practice and interaction with students 10\n2 Other factors: \n Cultural model (long-standing Chinese tradition) 4\n Personal experience 10\n3 Focal elements of defining EFL Teachers \nInitiator 6\n Knowledge transmitter 7\n4 Choice is consistent with pedagogical behaviors/Yes 10\n5 First consideration in implementing teaching practice \nStudents 6\n Teaching scheme 4\nTeachers 0\nthat EFL teachers should be a nurturer and therefore be\nresponsible for taking care of students and facilitating their\npersonal development as a parent, while 9 of them mentioned\nthe necessity of teachers' responsibility for establishing a\nbridge and transmitting the English culture to the students.\nTo investigate how they conceptualized the role of EFL\nteachers by means of metaphors, 10 EFL teachers were asked\nto participate in the interview and verbalize every thought\nthat came to mind when the metaphor was generated or\nselected with a list of five predetermined questions (see\nAppendix C). All the feedback was recorded and analyzed,\nthe results of which are shown in Table 2.\nAs Table 2 shows, Chinese cultural model, personal learn-\ning and teaching experience, and their frame of knowledge\nwere the factors that could determine their choice of meta-\nphors. Besides, their interpretation of the category of EFL\nteachers was found consistent with the metaphors they gen-\nerated. To show how they structured the role of EFL in meta-\nphors, the details of interviews with three EFL teachers'\nchoice of metaphors are outlined below.\nRong Ou. Rong Ou has been an EFL teacher for almost 20\nyears. Her perceptions of EFL teachers were shaped by the\nfollowing metaphors she used: teacher as instructor, director,\nand builder.As for the reasons for such choice, she explained\nthat Chinese traditional culture and personal experience\ncould account for it. Rong Ou remarked,\nI see myself not only as an instructor and director but also mind\nbuilder that was traditionally primary function of teachers. I\nwould instruct and direct my students in the process of English\nlearning. I would be shaping the minds of these \"budding\"\nadults. As an instructor, I want to interest my students in English\nstudies, and thus it is very important for me to stimulate their\nlearning motivation. In this case, English teachers should try to\nshow their class in an interesting, and humorous way just like an\nentertainer does and makes this learning journey more relaxing\nand pleasant.\nYingmei Qu.Yingmei Qu, coauthor of this article, has been\nan EFL teacher for 15 years. In the interview, she expressed\nthe metaphors of English teacher as instructor, English\nteacher as tour guide, English teacher as scaffolder, and Eng-\nlish teacher as flintstone. She clarified the teacher as the flint-\nstone of the building metaphor in that one of the primary\nfunctions for English teachers is to usher students into Eng-\nlish learning, provide very basic assistance, and then with-\ndraw after they have established their own structure, which\nseems to be consistent with what English teacher as scaf-\nfolder has suggested, a different educational construction\nmetaphor. When asked to explain how she could conceptual-\nize EFL teachers as such, Yingmei Ou remarked:\nMy perceptions of EFL teachers are manifest on several levels.\nFirst, for me, EFL teachers should be responsible for conveying\nknowledge in various ways and finding the right track for\nstudents to reach their targets, just as an instructor or a tour\nguide behaves, which is [in] line with long-standing Chinese\ntraditions. Second, English teachers should provide basic\nstructural guidance and then ignite their passions for English\nlearning. Similarly, English teachers should withdraw such help\nlater when students have built up their own structure. To this\nend, I usually link myself to a scaffolder or a flintstone and all\nthe metaphors I have used to structure EFL teachers are out of\nmy personal teaching experience and educational theories.\nHong Fei. Hong Fei has been an EFL teacher for almost 25\nyears. She said that the metaphors she used for defining EFL\nteachers followed a long-standing tradition of holding teachers\nXiong et al. 7\nin respect and a traditional view of good teacher. A good\nteacher in a traditional view has always been expected to\nwork hard at providing professional guidance and, thus,\nstimulating students' potential, which is, to a larger extent,\ndependent on the class the teachers organized. Thus, teacher\nas organizer and teacher as judge were the two primary met-\naphors she has generated for the category of EFL teachers.\nShe also said that she did not agree with the teacher as\ninstructor metaphor, and she explained this as follows:\nEducational theories I have learnt have influenced me a lot. I see\nmyself as an organizer or judge, rather than an instructor to my\nstudents. I don't want to instruct my students. For a smaller class,\nI am more willing to be an organizer and make more room for my\nstudents. For a larger class, I choose to be a judge, who can not\nonly decide what materials are suitable to students but also decide\nwhat strategies students could use to finish the task. Teacher as\njudge is a reflection of Construction Metaphor, where teachers,\nsometimes, have to take total control over teaching materials,\nmethods and molding students, which is quite similar to a judge\nwho rolled a judge, jury and executioner into one in court.\nAs illustrated above, cultural, societal, and cognitive fac-\ntors could account for the participants' selection of the three\nconceptual metaphors to define EFL teachers. Although\nthere was a discrepancy in their choices, a cluster of four ele-\nments such as instructor, initiator, knowledge transmitter,\nand builder were found to be important for conceptualizing\ntheir roles as such.\nCognitive Models\nAccording to Lakoff (1987), any element of a cognitive\nmodel can correspond to a conceptual category, which is\ncharacterized with its prototype effect. Prototypes are usu-\nally considered as the most representative members of a cat-\negory. In many cases, prototypes act as cognitive reference\npoints of various sorts and form the basis for inferences\nfactors, such as degree of category membership, internal cat-\negory structure, nature of cognitive models, and so on.\nFrom the responses to both the open-ended questionnaire\nand the checklist questionnaire, we found that three\nmetaphors--Educational Journey Metaphor, Educational\nBuilding Metaphor, and Educational Conduit Metaphor--\nwere involved in defining the category of EFL teachers. As\nseen in Table 1, the Educational Journey Metaphor was the\nmost prevalent and frequently chosen item (T 147), the\nEducational Building Metaphor the next most frequently\nchosen item (T 136), and the Educational Conduit Metaphor\nwas the least frequently chosen item (T 40). It seemed that\nparticipants used the three conceptual metaphors, but with a\nrelatively distinct weight, to partially structure the concept of\nEnglish teacher.\nAs shown in Table 2, a cluster of four elements were\nfound to be important for defining the category of an English\nteacher by metaphors. Instructor (T 10), initiator (T 6),\nknowledge transmitter (T 7), and builder (T 3) are the most\nimportant elements of the prototype of an English teacher.\nThe author found that participants, when asked for focal ele-\nments of the category of EFLteachers, varied in their choices,\nsome of which seemed to conflict with others. Three partici-\npants told the author that sometimes they had a quite differ-\nent conceptual category of EFL teachers according to the size\nand type of lessons. For a larger class, they preferred to be a\nbuilder and controller, whereas for a smaller one, they chose\nto be an initiator who just led students in and then provided\nsome instruction. When it comes to what factors could\naccount for their selection among the 26 metaphors, it was\nfound there were many factors such as their basic under-\nstanding or knowledge as teachers (T 10), which is referred\nto as a folk model by cognitive anthropologists, influence\nfrom the learning of educational theory (T 6), years of teach-\ning experience (T 10), cultural models (T 4), personal experi-\nences (T 10), and so on. Besides, there was apparent\nconsistency between their use and choice of metaphors and\npedagogical behaviors. In total, 10 participants claimed that\nthe metaphors they have selected or generated were more or\nless in alignment with what they have practiced in their lan-\nguage classroom, consciously or unconsciously. The way\nthey have selected the metaphors also suggested some differ-\nences in their first consideration in implementing their teach-\ning practice. A total of 6 out of 10 accepted students as the\nmost important, 4 accepted teaching scheme, and none\naccepted teachers as their first consideration before they\nhave implemented their teaching practice.\nDiscussion\nThe results from the two questionnaires and verbal reports,\nwhich indicated the various conceptual metaphors EFL\nteachers have generated or chosen, converge on a certain\nprototypical cognitive model of an English teacher. Such a\nprototypical cognitive model is not restricted to a single\nmodel. In fact, it involves a number of cognitive models that\ncombine to form a complex cluster. The cluster is psycho-\nlogically more basic than the models taken individually\nAt the follow-up interviews, participants' responses to\nfive predetermined questions suggested that EFL teachers\ntook instructor, initiator, cultural transmitter, and builder as\nthe focal elements of the category of EFL teachers, and this\nwas the reflection of the prototypical cognitive models, which\nwas in line with what they have selected from the 26 meta-\nphors. It can be inferred from their metaphors and follow-up\ninterviews that no single model could cover the full range of\nEFLteachers. EFLteacher is based on a cluster of models, which\ncan be represented as instructor model, transmitter model, and\nbuilder model. In the first model, teachers are usually expected to\nprovideinstruction,aroledesignatedbyafolkmodel,whereteach-\ners are described as being knowledgeable and, thus, responsible\n8 SAGE Open\nfor guiding and educating students. In a transmitter model,\nteachers are often perceived as the knowledgeable individual\nor master, derived from people's common knowledge without\nany technical expertise, and their function is to convey knowl-\nedge, such as culture, science, and so on. The builder model is\nconsistent with the long-standing Chinese traditional culture\nthat teachers are soul engineers, and they should build and\nmold their students' minds. For the 10 participants who have\ntaught EFL in China for at least 7 years, it became obvious\nthat they usually used a cluster of converging cognitive mod-\nels with the instructor model as a central model to construct\ndefinitions for EFL teachers.\nFor the reasons why the teachers would conceptualize their\nroles as such, the cultural and social models of Chinese tradi-\ntional education should form a part, which is subsequently\nlinked to their personal experiences, self-understanding, and\nprofessional role that motivated them to believe in, identify\nwith, and make decisions around the nature of language\nteaching, language learning, and the language learners in and\nout of their class. To most of the EFL teachers who were\nbrought up in a Chinese traditional culture, two key aspects of\ncultural models of language education and teaching are their\ninstructional force as well as their emphasis on social order.\nIn such a model, teachers are usually endowed with a duty to\ninstruct and construct students' minds and behavior and,\ntherefore, maintain social harmony and stability, where teach-\ners should be a knowledgeable person, social leader, and\npowerful educator. Such culture has served to reinforce their\nviews on the importance of intellectual and social responsibil-\nity teachers should take in language teaching. Thus, it is\nimperative that language teachers not only guide and instruct\nstudents' learning, but also shape and build their minds to\nensure a harmonious society. However, in the development\nand advancement of educational theory, where attention has\nbeen shifted from being teacher-oriented to students-oriented,\nnew attributes have been added for language teachers and the\nneed to inspire students' full potential has become more\nprominent and stronger, which may experience some change\nfrom the social builder who has committed himself or herself\nto molding the next generation to a cultural bridge rather than\njust an instructor.\nConclusion\nSituated in a Chinese context of EFL teaching, the present\nstudy demonstrates that teachers'cognitive models are, more\nor less, in line with the metaphors they used or generated,\nwhich corresponds with Cameron and Low's (1999) and\nCameron and Malsen's (2010) claim that metaphor has been\nused as a research tool to investigate language teacher's cog-\nframework on metaphor elicitation, the study achieved the\nfollowing conclusions.\nFirst, all the metaphors EFL teachers have generated or\nselected to describe their knowledge, beliefs, and goals on\nEFL teaching were later categorized into three metaphors:\nEducational Journey Metaphor, Educational Construction\nMetaphor, and Educational Conduit Metaphor. As for the\nfactors that determine their selection from 26 metaphors,\nbasic knowledge (folk model), influence from the learning of\neducational theory, years of teaching experience, cultural\nmodels, and personal experiences influenced their choices,\namong which personal teaching and learning experience\nwere considered the most important.\nSecond, as far as cognitive models are concerned, the\nstudy showed most of us did not have a single coherent\nunderstanding of EFL teachers. Instead, we had three con-\nverging cognitive models--instructor model, transmitter\nmodel, and builder model--each with distinct focal entail-\nments, to structure the category of EFL teachers. The find-\nings showed high consistency between cognitive models and\nmetaphors teachers have generated or selected.\nThird, on the basis of the above analysis, we assume that\nmetaphors can actually serve as a useful, effective, and ana-\nlytic tool for making us more aware of the cognitive model\nunderlying our conceptual framework for EFL teaching.\nBesides, it can allow us to identify some of the important\nassumptions we have made in EFL teaching and, therefore,\nchoose to take responsibility for our pedagogical behaviors.\nBy understanding how we structure the category of EFL\nteachers in terms of metaphors and their associated cognitive\nmodels, we can more effectively, critically reflect and evalu-\nate our teaching practice with the purpose of promoting EFL\nlearning.\nLast, this research has just been a quantitative study and\nlimited in three aspects. First, metaphor and cognitive mod-\nels involve a variety of disciplines, such as psychology, biol-\nogy, cognitive science, sociology, and so on; consequently,\nthey are difficult to categorize. Second, as our study focuses\non the participants from only one university, a larger scope of\nEFL teachers at the same level cannot be investigated; there-\nfore, the findings of the present study are not generalizable.\nAppendix A\nOpen-Ended Questionnaire\nPlease complete the following information as required.\n1.
