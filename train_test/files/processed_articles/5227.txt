Whereas\nfemales were consistently more intrasexually competitive the higher the socio-economic\nstatus of their parents, males with parents of the lowest socio-economic status tended to be\nmore intrasexually competitive than those with parents of medium socio-economic status,\nand nearly as intrasexually competitive as those with parents of high socio-economic status.\nOnly among adolescents with parents of low socio-economic status were males more\nintrasexually competitive than females. Among males and females, higher levels of\nintrasexual competitiveness were related to a higher family income, to a higher\noccupational status of the father as well as of the mother, and to a higher educational level\nof the mother. Only among females were higher levels of intrasexual competitiveness\nassociated with a higher educational level of the father. Males whose fathers had only\nelementary education had a relatively high level of intrasexual competitiveness.

For example, in a 12-year study of wild meerkats,\nClutton-Brock et al. (2006) found that, among females, reproductive success was more\nskewed than among males and, concurrently, more aggression occurred among females\nthan among males. With respect to humans, evidence is increasing that women may be\nintrasexually quite competitive and even aggressive (e.g., Bettencourt and Miller, 1996;\nBenenson (2009), women rely heavily on the investment of one partner for provision and\nfor protection of themselves and their offspring. Therefore, they have to compete\ncontinuously to attract and keep a male partner. Among men, on the other hand, intrasexual\ncompetition is to some extent dampened by the importance of collaborating with other men\nin groups. In line with this rationale, Benenson et al. (2009) found that women tend to\naccept stresses and strains in their peer relationships less easily than men.\nIntrasexual competition among women is not limited to monogamous mating\nsystems. In a cross-cultural examination, Burbank (1987) found that in polygynous\nsocieties co-wives often compete intrasexually over food and money, over paternal care for\ntheir offspring, and over their offspring's inheritance. In 61% of the 137 cultures Burbank\nanalyzed, women engaged in physical aggression, typically fighting with other women over\nmen.\nEven though both sexes may be intrasexually competitive, male and female\nintrasexual competition differs in various ways. First, reviewing many species, including\nhumans, Rosvall (2011) concluded that females tend to compete more over high quality\nmates than males do. Second, among humans, males tend to be more physically aggressive,\nwhereas females tend to be more verbally aggressive and ostracizing (e.g., Benenson, 2009;\nCampbell, 2002; Cashdan, 1998). Third, among humans, males and females compete--in\npart--in different domains, i.e., in the traits that are most preferred by the opposite-sex (see\nWhile throughout human history men have competed more in the domains of status and\ndominance, women have probably competed more in the domain of physical attractiveness\n(e.g., Cashdan, 1998). Overall, when confronted with rivals in romantic as well as\nprofessional situations, women tend to respond with higher levels of jealousy to attractive\nrivals, whereas men respond to socially dominant rivals (e.g., Buunk, aan `t Goor, and\nIntrasexual competition is quite salient among adolescents, who tend to be very\nsensitive to hierarchies and pay close attention to indicators of their own place in the\nhierarchy (e.g., Fournier, 2009; Hibbard and Buhrmester, 2010). Whereas individuals may\nbecome more certain about their actual and potential status as they age, young men are\nparticularly uncertain about their current status and their possibilities of obtaining a high\nstatus in the future. As noted by Barkow (1989) in his seminal book Darwin, Sex and\nStatus, adolescents are seeking to determine the actual and symbolic groups in which they\nmay attain a high position. Whereas young women may receive attention from the opposite\nsex on the basis of being physically attractive alone, young men are more likely to need\nsome type of status (e.g., having money to spend, driving a nice car, playing in a rock band,\nstudying for a high status job) to receive such attention. Intrasexual competition may have\nserious consequences for young people, and may explain the higher rate of criminal\nactivities among young men (e.g., when they realize that they can easily obtain resources in\nParental social status and intrasexual competitiveness among adolescents\nthis way) and the higher rate of school drop-out among boys (e.g., when they perceive that\nthey won't be able to attain high status through education). Some have even argued that\nintrasexual competition is associated with the occurrence of eating disorders among young\nwomen, as they aim to be thinner and less fat than other young women (see, e.g., Campbell,\nshowed that competition with other women for mates was related to both anorexia and\nbulimia.\nIn the present research, we examined in a large sample of adolescents how\nintrasexual competitiveness was related to the social status of the parents. The research was\npart of the TRacking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey (TRAILS) prospective cohort\nstudy, which focuses on the determinants of psychopathology. The current research was\nprimarily exploratory, as different predictions can be made for the effect of parental status\non intrasexual competitiveness depending on the theoretical framework adopted. If, as is\noften assumed, intrasexual competition revolves in part around competition over mates, one\nwould expect women to show higher levels of intrasexual competitiveness with increasing\nstatus of their parents. Whereas men are more willing to \"marry down,\" (i.e., marry with\nsomeone of lower social status), women tend to prefer partners of at least their own social\nstatus. Therefore, among women with a high social status, there is potentially a stronger\ncompetition over mates than among women with a low social status. An extreme example\nof this is found in societies with strongly patrilineal and patrifocal marriage and inheritance\nsystems, where the marriage prospects of women of the highest socio-economic levels are\nrelatively poor because it is considered unacceptable for women to marry into a lower\nsocio-economic class, whereas men can marry women of lower socio-economic levels\nWe did not examine the various types of intrasexual competition that may differ\ndramatically between lower-class and upper-class women. For example, research by\nCampbell (2002) has shown that extreme manifestations of female intrasexual competition,\nsuch as thefts, assaults, and homicides, are more common in lower and working-class\nwomen than in middle-class or upper-class women. In contrast, discrete, indirect forms of\nintrasexual competition may be more common among middle-class or upper-class women.\nWe focused on intrasexual competitiveness (i.e., the extent to which one views the\nrelationships with same-sex peers in competitive terms). The predicted higher intrasexual\ncompetitiveness among women from higher socio-economic levels would be in line with\nthe observation that anorexia nervosa is more prevalent among women from these levels,\nassuming that, as Mealey (2000) suggested, anorexia is at least partly the result of\nintrasexual competition. Although an early review concluded that there is no consistent\nrelationship between anorexia nervosa and socio-economic status (Gard and Freeman,\n1996), a number of recent, well-designed studies in countries with quite divergent cultures,\nincluding Sweden and Brazil, do show that the risk of anorexia is higher among girls from\nthe higher socio-economic levels (McClelland and Crisp, 2001; Moya, Fleitlich-Bilyk, and\nGoodman, 2006; Nevonen and Norring, 2004). In contrast, men a with low social status\nwill face competition not only from men within their own social stratum, but also from men\nof higher status levels. Therefore, whereas women with a low social status may show a\nrelatively low level of intrasexual competitiveness because of their options of marrying up,\nmen with a low social status may show relatively enhanced levels of intrasexual\nParental social status and intrasexual competitiveness among adolescents\nOne may also argue that for both sexes there will be an overall effect of parental\nsocio-economic status on intrasexual competitiveness. That is, on the one hand, one might\nexpect that there will be more competition in a context of scarce resources (i.e., in the\nlower socio-economic classes). Indeed, in a experiment among 3- and 4-year-olds, McKee\nand Leader (1955) found that, when paired with someone of one's own sex and socio-\neconomic level for a building task, children from lower socio-economic levels exhibited\nrelatively high levels of competition in a play situation (i.e., behavior of which the intent\nseemed to be to increase or to communicate one's superiority). On the other hand, one may\nargue that the higher the parental social status, the more one has to lose in terms of access\nto well-paying jobs, prestige, and respect when, for example, one is not able to finish a\nhigher education. Because losing one's status (in this case the status one had because of\none's parents) is generally an extremely painful experience (cf. Gilbert and Allan, 1998),\nintrasexual competition (and probably competition in general) might be more, not less,\nprevalent among young men from high socio-economic levels than among young men from\nlow socio-economic levels. Indeed, in a longitudinal study of adolescents, Faris and\nFelmlee (2011) found that among those of higher social status--assessed with network\ncentrality--the more aggression occurred to same-sex as well as to opposite-sex others,\nalthough those at the very top of the hierarchy showed relatively low levels of aggression.\nIn human societies, and especially in current modern societies, social status is a\ncomplex phenomenon, and status in one domain, such as intelligence, creative ability, or\nprestige may be far from perfectly correlated with status in another domain, such as\nincome, resources, or occupational level. For example, as noted by Christ et al. (2012), a\nfire-fighter or university professor may have high prestige without actually having a high\nincome or (in the case of fire fighters) a high education. Conversely, bankers these days\nhave low prestige even though they tend to earn high salaries. In their recent analysis of\ndata from a nationally representative sample of over 380,000 U.S. workers, Christ et al.\n(2012) found that lower occupational prestige was, independent of income and educational\nattainment, associated with higher mortality from various causes including cancer,\ncardiovascular disease, and respiratory disorders. Although we did not have a direct\nmeasure of occupational prestige, we could examine the relationship between intrasexual\ncompetitiveness and three different dimensions of parental social status: occupational level\nof both the father and the mother, educational level of both the father and the mother, and\nfamily income. We first examined how intrasexual competitiveness was related to a\ncomposite measure of social status that was based on all aforementioned aspects (see\nVeenstra et al., 2005). Next, we assessed which of the three dimensions drives the effects\nof the composite measure.\nAs noted previously, to assess the levels of intrasexual competitiveness, we did not\nexamine various intrasexual competitive behaviors and strategies. Instead, we examined\nintrasexual competitiveness by using a scale that assessed intrasexual competition as an\nattitude (Buunk and Fisher, 2009). This scale was constructed to be gender-neutral and\nassesses the degree to which one views the confrontation with same-sex individuals,\nespecially in the context of contact with the opposite-sex, in competitive terms. This\ncompetitiveness implicates a number of phenomena that have been well-described in the\npsychological literature--albeit not in a mating context--including the desire to beat others\nrather than to perform well (cf. Van Yperen, 2003); the desire to view oneself as better than\nothers (cf. self-enhancement; Zuckerman and O'Loughlin, 2006); envy and frustration\nParental social status and intrasexual competitiveness among adolescents\nwhen others are better off and negative feelings towards such others (cf. Smith and Kim,\n2007; and malicious pleasure when high achievers (\"tall poppies\") lose face (cf., Feather,\n1994). In the scale used here, these phenomena were operationalized on dimensions\nrelevant to mating, or formulated in mating contexts. There is increasing evidence that the\nscale is related to other variables in theoretically meaningful ways. First, overall, the scale\ncorrelates with sibling rivalry, and among women with a lack of agreeableness, and among\nmen with a high level of neuroticism and extraversion (Buunk and Fisher, 2009). Second,\nin a within-subjects design, Cobey, Klipping, and Buunk (2013) found that pair-bonded\nwomen reported significantly lower levels of intrasexual competitiveness (as measured\nwith the present scale) while using hormonal contraceptives than while regularly cycling at\neither fertile or non-fertile cycle stages. This effect remained significant when controlling\nfor age, length of relationship, and relationship satisfaction. Third, intrasexual\ncompetitiveness as measured with the present scale was found to be lowest among women\nof medium height--i.e., women who tend to be most preferred as partners and who tend to\nexperience the lowest levels of jealousy (e.g., Buunk, Pollet, Klavina, Figueredo, and\nfound that in work situations, intrasexual competitiveness (as measured with the present\nscale) was related to jealousy among men in response to socially dominant rivals, and\namong women in response to physically attractive rivals.\nTo summarize, in a large, representative sample of adolescents we examined to\nwhat extent intrasexual competitiveness of adolescents was related to the socioeconomic\nstatus of their parents, including the occupational and educational levels of both parents as\nwell as the family income. Although the study was primarily exploratory, we expected that\nintrasexual competitiveness would be relatively more elevated among female adolescents\nfrom higher socio-economic levels and among male adolescents from lower socio-\neconomic levels. However, we reasoned that it is possible that, overall, intrasexual\ncompetitiveness would be more elevated among those from the higher socio-economic\nlevels.\nMaterials and Methods\nProcedure\nThe TRacking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey (TRAILS) is a prospective\ncohort study of Dutch adolescents with the aim of charting and explaining the development\nof mental health from preadolescence into adulthood (Huisman et al., 2008). The present\narticle involves data from the first and fourth assessment waves, which ran from March\nstudy was approved by the Dutch Central Committee on Research Involving Human\nSubjects. For recent extensive information on the sampling and procedure, see, e.g., Ormel\net al. (2012) and Nederhof et al. (2012). The following procedure is based on these last two\npublications. Participants were selected from five municipalities in the North of the\nNetherlands, including both urban and rural areas. Children born between October 1, 1989\nand September 30, 1991 were eligible for inclusion provided that their schools were willing\nto cooperate and that they met the study's inclusion criteria (de Winter et al., 2005). Over\n90% of the schools, accommodating 2,935 eligible children, agreed to participate in the\nstudy. Through extended efforts, the final response rate of the parents was 76% (n = 2,230,\nParental social status and intrasexual competitiveness among adolescents\nreports, which were available for 40.7% of the non-responders, revealed that the non-\nresponders were more likely to be boys, to have a low socio-economic background, and to\nperform poorly at school. Non-responders did not differ from responders regarding\nassociations between socio-demographic variables and mental health outcomes (Huisman\nAt the first wave, the interviewers were university graduates extensively trained in\ninterviewing skills, in the study background, and in the content of the interview. At T4 the\nadolescents had reached the age of 18 or 19, and parental consent was no longer needed for\nparticipation. At this wave, a custom research company (CRC) was hired to recruit and\nassess all respondents that had participated at T1 and at T2 or T3 and had not refused\nfurther participation. After participants had given informed consent, the CRC sent login\ninformation for a web-based questionnaire. A gift certificate of 10 was included.\nAdolescents who did not respond to the questionnaire within 2\u00ad3 weeks were contacted by\ntelephone with the request to participate. When they still did not respond after several\nreminders, or when adolescents could not be reached by telephone, a CRC employee paid\none or two home visits, both announced and unannounced. This resulted in a response rate\nof 72% (n = 1,610). Participants who had not completed any assessments with the CRC\nwere contacted by the research team. These extensive recruitment efforts led to the\ninclusion of 271 additional participants, resulting in a response rate of 84.3% at T4.\nSample\nThe final sample included a total of 1,881 respondents, with a mean age of 19.1 (SD\nMeasures\nIn the TRAILS project, biological, psychological, and social information has been\ncollected from multiple sources: adolescents, their parents, their teachers, and their peers.\nHuisman et al. (2008) provide an overview of all measurements of the first three waves.\nThe fourth wave was comparable to the earlier waves, with a few adaptations.\nStatus indicators. These variables were assessed at T1. Occupational status of both\nparents was assessed using the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO;\nGanzeboom and Treiman, 1996), which distinguishes the following nine levels: (1)\nelementary occupations; (2) plant and machine operators and assemblers; (3) craft and\nrelated trades workers; (4) skilled agricultural and fisheries workers; (5) service workers,\nshop and market sales workers; (6) clerks; (7) technicians and associated professionals; (8)\nprofessionals; and (9) legislators, senior officials, and managers. As there were no mothers\nwho were skilled agricultural and fisheries workers, and few fathers (1.2%) in this\ncategory, this category was combined with that of service workers, shop and market sales\nworkers.\nEducational level consisted of five levels corresponding to the Dutch educational\nsystem: (1) elementary education, (2) lower tracts of secondary education, (3) higher tracts\nof secondary education, (4) senior vocational education, and (5) university education.\nMonthly family income (minus tax) consisted of nine categories. As the lowest category\nParental social status and intrasexual competitiveness among adolescents\ncontained only a few individuals, this category was combined with the second-to-lowest\ncategory, resulting in eight categories.\nNext, we used the aggregate measure of socio-economic status that was developed\nin the TRAILS project (Veenstra et al., 2005) by averaging the five indicators of status:\nfamily income divided into three categories (i.e., low income: less than 2,500;\nlevel of both parents, and occupational level of both parents after standardization. The\nlowest 25%, intermediate 50%, and highest 25% of the scores were considered to represent\nlow, intermediate, and high socio-economic status, respectively. The aggregate socio-\neconomic status index captured 61.2% of the variance in the five items, with a Cronbach's\nalpha of 0.84. Missing values (e.g., when there was only one parent in the family) did not\naffect the association between the socio-economic status measure and other variables (see\nIntrasexual competitiveness. This variable was assessed at T4 and consisted of a\nslightly adapted version of the scale for intrasexual competition developed by Buunk and\nFisher (2009). The original scale consists of 12 items such as \"When I go out, I can't stand\nit when women/men pay more attention to a same-sex friend of mine than to me,\" \"I tend to\nlook for negative characteristics in attractive men/women,\" and \"I just don't like very\nambitious men/women.\" Because this was a sample of adolescents, we omitted the two\nitems of the scale that would only be relevant for adults (i.e., the items that referred to\nhiring an attractive or competent colleague at work). Each item has seven possible answers\nvarying from 1 = \"not at all applicable\" to 7 = \"completely applicable.\" Cronbach's alpha\nfor the current ten item scale was very high ( = .89).\nResults\nWe first examined to what extent the intrasexual competitiveness of adolescents\nwas related to overall socio-economic status of their parents, and next the relationship to\noccupational level as well as the educational level of both parents, and to the family\nincome.\nSocio-economic status. An ANOVA with socio-economic level and sex as\nindependent variables and intrasexual competitiveness as the dependent variable showed a\npartial 2 = .005. As shown in Figure 1a, overall the level of intrasexual competitiveness\nwas higher as the socio-economic level of the family in which one grew up was higher, but\nthis applied particularly to women: The post-hoc LSD tests among women showed that all\nthree levels differed significantly from each other (ps < .008). However, among men, the\npost-hoc LSD tests showed that only the highest and medium level of socio-economic\nstatus differed significantly from each other (p < .001), but that the medium socio-\neconomic level did not differ significantly from the lowest level (p = .39), and the high\nsocio-economic level only marginally differed from the lowest level (p = .06). Thus, both\nmen and women who came from families with a higher socio-economic status were the\nmost intrasexually competitive. However, whereas women were consistently more\nintrasexually competitive the higher the socio-economic status of their parents, men who\nParental social status and intrasexual competitiveness among adolescents\ncame from families with the lowest socio-economic status tended to be as intrasexually\ncompetitive as those who came from families with a medium socio-economic status.\nNevertheless, they were still somewhat less intrasexually competitive as those who came\nfrom families with a high socio-economic status. Put differently, whereas men and women\ndid not differ from each other in their levels of intrasexual competitiveness, in the medium\nlevel, men displayed a higher level of intrasexual competitiveness than women, t(324) =\nAfter these global analyses of the effects of socio-economic level, we did additional\nanalyses to examine which aspects of socio-economic level were in particular responsible\nfor the effects (i.e., family income, educational level and occupational status of both\nparents).\nIncome. An ANOVA with family income and sex as independent variables and\nintrasexual competitiveness as the dependent variable showed a significant main effect of\nwas dropped from the model. As shown in Figure 1b, the higher the income, the higher the\nlevel of intrasexual competitiveness. Although it would seem that among men there is a\ndrop in intrasexual competitiveness from the second-to-highest to the highest income\ncategory, a post hoc LSD test showed that this drop was not significant, p =.17.\nFigure 1. Intrasexual competitiveness as related to (a) overall socio-economic level and (b)\nincome of the parents\nEducational level. In the next series of analyses, we examined the effects of\neducational level of the parents. These analyses showed that the effects of fathers'\neducational levels were quite different from the effects of mothers' educational levels. An\nANOVA with the educational level of the mother and sex as independent variables and\nParental social status and intrasexual competitiveness among adolescents\nintrasexual competitiveness as the dependent variable showed a highly significant main\n2 = .003, and this interaction was therefore dropped from the model. As shown in Figure\n2a, the higher the educational level of the mother, the higher the level of intrasexual\ncompetitiveness among both men and women. Thus, the educational level of the mother did\nnot seem to drive the different effects of socio-economic level for men and women.\nAn ANOVA with educational level of the father and sex as independent variables\nand intrasexual competition as the dependent variable also showed a highly significant\ninteraction effect (see Figure 2b) was in part similar to that of overall socio-economic level\n(see Figure 1a), suggesting that the educational level of the father in particular drove the\neffects of socio-economic level. That is, the effect of fathers' educational level was\nconsiderably weaker among men than among women. A separate ANOVA among women\nshowed a highly significant effect of fathers' educational level, F(4,773) = 11.60, p <\nAs shown in Figure 2b, among women there was a clear linear and steep effect of\neducational level of the father: The higher the father's educational level, the higher his\ndaughter's level of intrasexual competitiveness. In contrast, a separate ANOVA among\nmen showed a significant, but not very strong effect of fathers' educational level, F(4,649)\nsignificant--the contrast of university education with the two tracks of high school\neducation (ps < .01)--whereas the contrast between university education and elementary\neducation was not significant. Thus, men with a father who had a high school education\nhad a lower level of intrasexual competitiveness than men whose father had a university\neducation, but men whose father had only elementary education did not differ in intrasexual\ncompetitiveness from men whose father had a university education.\nNext, we examined whether the effects of fathers' and mothers' educational levels\nwere independent of each other. Assortative mating with respect to education was evident\nfrom the positive correlation between the education of the mother and the education of the\nfathers' and mothers' educational level on the level of intrasexual competitiveness among\nsignificant effect, in part due to the high correlation between the two variables. In contrast,\nwhen examining female intrasexual competitiveness, we found a significant effect of\nimportant effect of one's father's education on intrasexual competitiveness among women.\nFigure 2. Intrasexual competitiveness as related to educational level of (a) the mother and\n(b) the father\nParental social status and intrasexual competitiveness among adolescents\nOccupational status. Finally, we performed a series of similar analyses for the role\nof occupational status. These analyses showed that the effects of fathers' occupational\nstatus were quite similar to the effects of mothers' occupational status. An ANOVA with\noccupational status of the mother and sex as independent variables and intrasexual\ncompetitiveness as the dependent variable showed a significant main effect of occupational\nand this interaction was therefore dropped from the model. Thus, the occupational status of\nthe mother affected men and women to a similar degree. As shown in Figure 3a, the higher\nthe occupational status of the mother, the higher the level of intrasexual competitiveness.\nAn ANOVA with occupational status of the father and sex as independent variables\nand intrasexual competitiveness as the dependent variable showed a highly significant main\nand this interaction was therefore dropped from the model. Thus, also the father's\noccupational status affected men and women to a similar degree. As shown in Figure 3b,\nthe higher the occupational status of the father, the higher the level of intrasexual\ncompetitiveness was.\nNext, we examined to what extent the effects of fathers' and mothers' occupational\nstatus were independent of each other. Again, assortative pairing was observed, this time\nwith respect to the occupational status of the mother and of the father (Spearman r = .43; n\n= 1392; p < .0001). A single ANOVA simultaneously examining the effect of fathers' and\nmothers' occupational status on the level of intrasexual competitiveness among women\neffect (although the maternal effect was marginally significant), in part due, of course, to\nthe high correlation between the two variables. In contrast, when examining male\nintrasexual competitiveness, we found a significant effect of fathers' occupational status,\nParental social status and intrasexual competitiveness among adolescents\nFigure 3. Intrasexual competitiveness as related to occupational status of (a) the mother\nand (b) the father\nDiscussion\nIn the present exploratory research among Dutch adolescents, we examined the\neffect of parental socio-economic status on intrasexual competitiveness, assessed as the\ntendency to view same-sex others as competitors in the realm of mating, resources, and\nstatus. We expected that this tendency would be relatively more elevated among male\nadolescents from lower socio-economic levels and among female adolescents from higher\nsocio-economic levels, but we argued that it is possible that, overall, intrasexual\ncompetitiveness might be more elevated among those from the higher socio-economic\nlevels. In fact, for men we found evidence for both seemingly contradictory effects,\nwhereas for women we found only support for our last prediction. In general, the findings\nprovide clear evidence that intrasexual competitiveness among adolescents is directly\nrelated to the socio-economic status of the parents, and seem to suggest two distinct effects.\nFirstly, there tends to be a higher level of intrasexual competitiveness among adolescents as\ntheir parents have a higher social status. That is, among both men and women, higher levels\nof intrasexual competitiveness were (with some deviations) associated with a higher family\nincome, to a higher occupational status of the father as well as of the mother, and to a\nhigher educational level of the mother. This can be interpreted as a status maintenance\neffect: Adolescents who grow up in a family with a high social status have more to lose\nthan adolescents who grow up in a family with a low social status, and may therefore be\nmore competitive towards same sex others to maintain their high status (cf., Faris and\nFelmlee, 2011). Secondly, we found, in line with our predictions, evidence for a number of\nParental social status and intrasexual competitiveness among adolescents\nsex differences: Whereas among women higher levels of intrasexual competitiveness were\nlinearly and rather strongly related to overall parental socio-economic status, among men\nthose with parents with the lowest socio-economic status tended to be equally intrasexually\ncompetitive as those with parents with a medium socio-economic status, and slightly less\nintrasexually competitive than those with parents with a high socio-economic status. In\nfact, although there was no overall sex difference in intrasexual competitiveness, men were\nmore intrasexually competitive than women among adolescents with parents of a low\nsocio-economic status. This sex difference seemed to be mainly due to the educational level\nof the father, which had a similar effect as the overall socio-economic level. That is, among\nwomen, the higher the educational level of their fathers, the more intrasexually competitive\nthey were. In contrast, among men, those with a father who had only elementary education\nwere nearly as intrasexually competitive as those with a father who had a university\neducation, whereas those with a father who had an intermediate level of education were the\nleast intrasexually competitive. This sex difference may be interpreted as a differential\nstatus striving effect, and is in line with our suggestion that because men are more willing\nto marry with someone of a lower social status, social status will affect male and female\nintrasexual competitiveness differently. That is, men with the lowest social status not only\nhave to compete for mates (and for the status and resources that give access to mates) with\nmen of their own level of social status, but also with men of higher status levels (of course,\nthe need to maintain one's status will still result in a high level of intrasexual\ncompetitiveness in this group). In contrast, women of a low social status have more options\nof marrying up, and may therefore show less intrasexual competitiveness than men of a low\nsocial status. At the same time, because women tend to prefer partners of at least their own\nsocial status, among women with a high social status there will be a stronger competition\nover mates than among women with a low social status. Thus, the curvilinear effect of\nsocial status on intrasexual competitiveness observed in men may be a consequence of a\nstatus maintenance effect in combination with a differential status striving effect.\nIt is not directly obvious why the educational level of the father and not of the\nmother had this differential effect on men and women. A possible explanation is that the\nfather's educational level still determines the societal status of a family more than the\nmother's educational level. Furthermore, the issue arises as to why it was educational level,\nand not income or professional status that drove the effects. It may be that, in Western\nsocieties, educational level is the most unequivocal indicator of prestige and is least likely\nto be subject to negative societal evaluations in comparison to, for example, income, as\nillustrated by the low prestige of bankers these days. Even more so, in Western societies,\neducational level may affect the culture in the family more than income or professional\nstatus. Moreover, attaining a higher educational level requires intelligence and persistence;\ntherefore, a male with a father with a low education may respond rather negatively to men\nwho are doing better in this respect. It must be noted though that among men, but not\namong women, the occupational status of the father had a stronger effect on intrasexual\ncompetitiveness than the occupational status of the mother. This may be due to the fact that\nmen identify more with their father than with their mother, and that the profession of one's\nfather is a more observable characteristic than income or education.\nThe present research has a number of strong points as well as limitations. To begin\nwith the latter, the sex differences were relatively minor given the large sample size, and\nwe can only speculate about the processes responsible for the observed effects. In addition,\nParental social status and intrasexual competitiveness among adolescents\nwe did not examine here the behavioral manifestations of intrasexual competition such as\nphysical aggression, submission, or derogating one's rivals. For example, Buss and Dedden\n(1990) identified numerous strategies of the latter, including derogating a competitor's\nintelligence, calling a competitor promiscuous, or dominating a competitor. As noted by\nCampbell (2002), forms of intrasexual competition such as violence and thefts are more\nprevalent among women from lower socio-economic levels. Furthermore, this research\ncannot demonstrate that parental social status has direct causal effects on intrasexual\ncompetitiveness. As we assume that intrasexual competitiveness is a trait, it may follow the\nsame pattern as many other psychological traits, and be moderately heritable.\nDespite these limitations, strong points of our research include the use of a large\nsample representative of Dutch adolescents, as well as differentiated measures of social\nstatus. Moreover, this research is the first to systematically study the effects of socio-\neconomic status on intrasexual competitiveness and suggests that competitiveness with\nsame-sex others is a robust phenomenon, despite the fact that currently, in the labor market,\nmen and women compete more with one another than ever before. Whereas male\nadolescents from the lowest socio-economic levels may be as competitive as those from the\nhighest levels, such competition is overall more, not less, prevalent among female\nadolescents from higher socio-economic levels. These findings may help in explaining a\nvariety of processes, including the relative high prevalence of criminal behavior among\nboys with low educational levels--assumedly a way to attain status and resources that boys\nwith higher educational levels may attain through education--as well as the assumed\nhigher prevalence of anorexia nervosa among girls from the higher socio-economic levels\nThe present research may also have practical implications. It may sensitize\nprofessionals working with adolescents and their families to the important role intrasexual\ncompetition may play, especially among female adolescents from high socio-economic\nlevels and among male adolescents from low socio-economic levels. Addressing and\nmoderating intrasexual competitiveness in these groups may help in preventing a variety of\ndeviant behaviors, from criminal acts to anorexia (cf., Campbell, 2002; Mealey, 2000). In\ngeneral, the present research may add to a better understanding of why and how social\nstratification in society is maintained, and thus links evolutionary thinking to classic\nsociological and social psychological issues.\n"
