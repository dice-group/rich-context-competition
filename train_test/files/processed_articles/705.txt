For example, a\nrecent study found that fewer small employ-\nbut was unable to explain why offer rates\nhave fallen.3 This paper presents evidence that\nthe strong economy is having a positive effect\non health insurance coverage for children.\nSecond, the increase in employment-based\ncoverage of children has a number of implica-\ntions for policy, including its impact on the\nState Children's Health Insurance Program\n(CHIP). The increase will affect future enroll-\nment in the CHIP program and ultimately ex-\npenditures on the program. In addition, the\npotential that CHIP coverage has to \"crowd\nout\" employment-based health insurance cov-\nerage may become much smaller as more chil-\ndren obtain employment-based coverage.\nThe increase in employer coverage also has\nimplications for the Medicaid program. Since\n1993 the percentage of children covered by the\nprogram has been declining, despite expan-\nsions to the program beginning in 1990. Fewer\nchildren are eligible for Medicaid because\nmore parents became employed on a full-time,\nfull-year basis; family income increased; and\nthe likelihood of being covered by an employ-\nment-based health plan increased between\nmains strong, we can expect a continued in-\ncrease in the percentage of children with em-\nployment-based health insurance coverage,\nwhich will reduce reliance on the Medicaid\nprogram and reduce the portion of federal and\nstate budgets devoted to Medicaid.\nTo design effective policies that will pro-\nvide health insurance to uninsured children,\nwe need to understand who is covered by em-\nployment-based coverage and why coverage\n\u00a91999ThePeople-to-People Health Foundation,Inc.\nPaul Fronstin is a senior research associate at the Employee Benefit Research Institute in Washington, D.C.\nH E A L T H T R A C K I N G : T R E N D S\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ S e p t e m b e r / O c t o b e r 1 9 9 9\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

This paper provides data\non the factors affecting these trends between\nnumber of uninsured children across selected\nfactors (age, family income, race, parents'\nwork status, and job characteristics) and\nfinds that the distribution of children by fam-\nily income shifted away from the poor to\nhigher income levels; the distribution of chil-\ndren by parents' work status shifted toward\nmore children in families with a mother or\nfather working all year and full time; and\nworking parents were more likely to be em-\nNonwhite children experienced significant\nincreases in employment-based health insur-\nof increased employment of their parents in\nfull-year, full-time jobs with access to health\ninsurance.\nThe data for this paper come from the March\nrent Population Survey (CPS).4 Each year's\nsurvey contains detailed data on approxi-\nswers to questions on labor-force participa-\ntion, work experience, family income, demo-\ngraphics, and health insurance coverage. The\nquestions on basic demographic variables re-\nfer to the month the survey was fielded, but\nthe questions on health insurance coverage re-\nfer to the prior calendar year.

If respondents answered the ques-\ntions accurately, the uninsured should in-\nclude only those persons who were without\nhealth insurance for the entire twelve months.\nIt is unclear, however, whether respondents\nare answering the question correctly or are\nproviding information concerning their cur-\nrent health insurance status. Comparisons of\nthe CPS health insurance data with other sur-\nveys generally have found that the CPS more\nclosely resembles a point-in-time estimate\nrather than a calendar-year estimate, leading\nresearchers to believe that at least some re-\nspondents actually answer the health insur-\nance questions with reference either to a par-\nticular point in time or for some period of time\nthat is less than a full year.5\nTo understand why the percentage of chil-\nH E A L T H T R A C K I N G : T R E N D S\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ V o l u m e 1 8 , N u m b e r 5\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

For example, even if the percentage\nof children covered by an employment-based\nhealth plan remained the same across all in-\nchildren would be covered by an employ-\nment-based health plan in 1997 as long as the\nincome distribution shifted to higher income\nlevels.

An increase in\nthe likelihood of being covered by an employ-\nment-based plan combined with population\ngrowth to cause the increase. Population\ngrowth accounted for approximately 40 per-\ncent of the increase in the number of children\ncovered. The increased likelihood of having\nemployment-based coverage is due in part to\nthe changing characteristics of children. This\nsection presents the data on these changing\ncharacteristics and also shows how the likeli-\nhood of having coverage has changed within\neach characteristic.

The distribution of children\nby family income shifted most toward the\nhigher end, 400 percent of poverty or higher.\nThis trend alone would account for the in-\ncrease in employment-based coverage among\nchildren. However, the change in the distribu-\ntion must be combined with some lower-\nincome groups' experiencing an increase in\nthe likelihood of being covered. For example,\nchildren in families with incomes under the\npoverty level experienced a 1.5-percentage-\npoint increase in the likelihood of being cov-\nered by an employment-based health plan.\nWhile this group did experience an increase\nin the likelihood of having employment-based\ncoverage, most of the increase in coverage was\nthe result of the shifting income distribution.6\nn RACE. Overall, children of all races ex-\nperienced an increase in the percentage cov-\nered by an employment-based health plan be-\nmost among nonwhite children (Exhibit 3).\nSpecifically, blacks experienced a 5.3 percent\nincrease, Hispanics a 3.7 percent increase,\nother races a 5.1 percent increase, and whites\nonly a 0.6 percent increase.

The explainable factors\ninclude changes in the characteristics of the\npopulation, such as (1) more children in high-\nincome families relative to low-income fami-\nworking parents who were more likely to be\nemployed by large firms relative to small firms\nin 1997. The unexplainable factors include the\nincrease in the likelihood of being covered by\nan employment-based plan among poor chil-\ndren from birth to age six and the increase in\ncoverage among nonwhite children.\nThe increased likelihood of having employ-\nment-based coverage among nonwhites is one\nof the most interesting findings in this paper.\nFurther analysis finds that nonwhite children\nwere significantly more likely in 1997 than in\n1994 to have a working father or mother em-\nployed full time, all year.8 It is likely that as\nmore nonwhite parents gain full-time, full-\nyear employment, access to health insurance\ncoverage will increase.

Despite recent re-\nports, small employers will have a difficult\ntime dropping coverage, and large employers\nwill have a difficult time shifting the cost of\ncoverage during a period of very low unem-\nployment when employers are competing for\nscarce labor resources.9 However, this trend\ncan easily reverse itself if the economy experi-\nences a recession.\nAny views expressed in this paper are those of the\nauthorand should not be ascribedto the officers,trus-\ntees,members,orother sponsorsoftheEmployeeBene-\nfit Research Institute (EBRI), EBRI's Education and\nResearchFund,or their staffs.\nNOTES\n1. The increase in coverage is significant at the 1\npercent level. These data points are slightly\nlower than those published by the Census Bu-\nreau. The difference stems from how private in-\nsurance is treated when it is obtained from\nsomeone outside the household. The Census Bu-\nreau treats private insurance obtained from out-\nside the household as employment-based cover-\nage. In contrast, this paper does not treat insur-\nance received from someone outside the house-\nhold as employment-based coverage because\nthere is no way to confirm that the source of\ncoverage is related to employment.\n2. Whether or not a person has insurance coverage\nis part of a larger dynamic process composed of\nsome people getting coverage who did not pre-\nviously have it, and other people losing coverage.\nBecause the results in this paper did not follow\nmillion increase in the number of children with\ncoverage studied here represents a net increase.\nThis increase includes both children who both\nhave gained employment-based coverage and\nthose who lost such coverage.\n3.
