In the course of intensifying\nprocesses of economic and cultural globalization, however,\nthe civic\u00adethnic dichotomy lost much of its previously\nappealing touch. To further shatter an already feeble concep-\ntual construction, various scholarly critiques have convinc-\ningly demonstrated that Hans Kohn's original idea of\ndistinctively civic (Western) nations and distinctively ethnic\n(Eastern) nations can neither be sustained on theoretical nor\nempirico-historical grounds (e.g., Hansen & Hesli, 2009;\nArguably, the point to be taken from such criticism is not\nnecessarily to categorically refute all analytical references\nto civic and ethnic dimensions in studies of national\nphenomena (e.g., people's national identities or the [re]\ninvention of national myths) but to appreciate that in an\nincreasingly interconnected world, whole nations and\nnational populations cannot be meaningfully conceived in\nterms of monolithic agglomerates of either the civic or the\nethnic type.\nAround the globe, public opinion on different national\nphenomena varies within as much as across different coun-\ntries and depending on people's individual experiences and\nperceptions, and more often than not legal definitions of\nnational membership are subject to change over time. The\npresent article aims to support this line of argument, with a\nparticular interest in associations between people's level of\nformal education and their evaluations of ancestry as marker\nof Britishness/Germanness.\nAncestry as Marker of National\nMembership\nIn today's world, it is not at all unusual to hear of people\nwho \"trade internationally, work internationally, love inter-\nnationally, marry internationally, do research internationally,\n1National Autonomous University of Mexico, Coyoac\u00e1n, Mexico\nCorresponding Author:\nAndreas P\u00f6llmann, Instituto de Investigaciones Sociales, National\nAutonomous University of Mexico, Circuito Mario de la Cueva s/n, Ciudad\nde la Investigaci\u00f3n en Humanidades, Ciudad Universitaria, C.

Through personal expe-\nriences of (voluntary or forced) migration, people can come\nto love and respect a country other than their parents' country\nof origin, with a strong sense of belonging and the desire for\nactive citizenship. They can learn new societal rules and regu-\nlations--even to converse in a new language. Their ancestral\nbackground, however, might be \"concealed but never realisti-\nin this sense that ancestry constitutes an exclusivist criterion\nfor national membership that fails to do justice to the complex\nrealities of contemporary multicultural societies.\nThe question as to whether ethnic components are vital\n\"to forge a `nation' today\" (Smith, 1986, p. 17) evokes much\ndebate. Ontologically speaking, ethno-national communities\nare imagined (Anderson, 2006). As symbolical constructs\n(Cohen, 1985), they rely on a myth of common ancestry\n(Smith, 1993) rather than on historically indisputable factual\naccounts. But even if there is good reason to conceive ances-\ntry as a flawed (and unnecessarily divisive) criterion for\nnational membership (Eller & Coughlan, 1993; Habermas,\nof ethno-national bonds can hardly be denied (Barth, 1969;\nIn people's perceptions, ideas of \"ethno-national bonds\"\nor a \"shared ancestry\" may well be mistaken for \"historical\ntruths\" rather than recognized as socially constructed mythol-\nThe sense of unique descent, of course, need not, and\nin nearly all cases will not, accord with factual history.\nNearly all nations are the variegated offspring of\nnumerous ethnic strains. It is not chronological or\nfactual history that is the key to the nation, but sentient\nor felt history. All that is irreducibly required for the\nexistence of a nation is that the members share an\nintuitive conviction of the group's separate origin and\nevolution. (p. 382, italics in original)\nConsequently, people's notions of legitimate national\nmembership can differ significantly from official definitions\nand laws. Their subjective realities and felt identities do not\nneed to converge with preestablished ethnic categories or\nlabels (Jamieson, 2002). A census, for example, may \"fit\"\npeople into particular categories (e.g., \"British\" or\n\"German\"), but this does not mean that people actually iden-\ntify themselves or others with these categories (Herrmann &\nThe subsequent discussion focuses, therefore, not only on\nlegal definitions of Britishness/Germanness but also on peo-\nple's perceptions1--on whether and to what extent they con-\nsider ancestry as an important criterion for legitimate\nnational membership. To begin with, however, let us take a\nlook at some recent developments in British and German\nnationality law.\nDevelopments in British and\nGerman Nationality Law\nNon-British residents in Britain have long faced compara-\ntively fewer legal and cultural barriers on the way to full\ncitizenship status and recognition than non-German resi-\nIn the late 1980s, for instance, immigrants to Britain had to\nwait only half as long for permanent residency status as\n(nonethnic German) immigrants to Germany (Soysal, 1994).\nNot surprisingly thus, the naturalization rate in Germany has\nGermany's 1913 Citizenship Act has been characterized\nas a \"system of pure jus sanguinis[2], with no trace of jus\nsoli[3], [which] continues to determine the citizenship status\nof immigrants and their descendants\" (Brubaker, 1992,\nwhen reflecting upon his personal travel experiences in\nreunified Germany:\nThe criterion of citizenship remains one of ethnic\ndescent on the basis of jus sanguinis. . . . To most\noutsiders, and to many Germans, it seems absurd that\na Turk, born and brought up in Germany, should be\nunable to become a citizen, while a German from\nSiberia, with no history of residence in the country\nand little language competence, should be entitled\nto citizenship and to extensive settlement assistance.\n(p. 76, italics in original)\nIt is right to draw attention to jus sanguinis--a long-\nestablished marker of German nationality that entails\nsignificant privileges for ethnic Germans--most notably\nthe immediate entitlement to full citizenship (Brubaker,\nThe legal foundations of German identity, however, do\nnot--as Ignatieff (1994) suggests--\"remain defined by the\nethnic nationalist past\" (p. 76).

But since then,\nBritish citizenship has been accorded predominantly\non the basis of jus sanguinis, whether or not the child\nis born in the United Kingdom. (p. 324, italics in\noriginal)\nThese gradual developments toward increasing cross-\nnational similarities in nationality law coincided with broader\nsociopolitical trends. Although in the late 1950s, the political\nculture in Germany (FRG) could plausibly be described as\ncomparatively less \"civic\" than in Britain (Almond & Verba,\nlost their empirical basis and, consequently, their conceptual\nSimple binary distinctions into civic and ethnic nations\nwould not only misrepresent legal realities and sociopolitical\ntrends in 21st-century multicultural societies such as Britain\nand Germany, but in evoking ideas of a \"general national\ncharacter\", they would also distort the fact that different\npeople--within and across different countries--ascribe\ndifferent degrees of importance to markers of national mem-\nbership. To illustrate this central point, the following section\nfocuses on people's perceptions, drawing on representative\nsurvey data for England5 and Germany.\nPublic Opinion in England and Germany\nThis section reports results from the International Social\na series of questions on national consciousness and national\nidentity and covers various countries around the globe,\nincluding England and Germany. The respective data were\nGeneral Population Samples\nTable 1 lists the different levels of importance that ISSP\n2003 respondents in England and Germany attribute to\nancestry in terms of what they think it means to be \"truly\"\nBritish/German.6\nAs quickly becomes evident, the respective survey data\nhardly serve to support notions of a distinctively ethnic\nGerman nation. In both England and Germany, slightly more\nthan 48% of respondents ascribe little or no significance to\nancestry as marker of national membership. The respective\nresults for England and Germany differ on some answer cat-\negories (\"fairly important\" and \"very important\") and are\nclose to identical on others (\"not very important\" and \"not\nimportant at all\")--with no consistent trend of cross-national\ndivergence.\nAlthoughformanypeople--inEnglandandinGermany--\nancestry does not appear to constitute an important criterion\nfor national membership, Table 1 also shows that slightly\nmore than every second respondent does indeed consider\nancestral ties as fairly or very important in terms of what he\nor she thinks it means to be \"truly\" British/German. Before\ngetting back to this finding in the concluding section, it will\nbe interesting to see to what extent the respective results vary\naccording to respondents' level of formal education.\nPublic Opinion by Respondents' Level of\nFormal Education\nInstitutions of formal education play an important part in\nthe formation of national identities (Bernstein, 1996;\npromote intercultural encounters and global learning, while\nchallenging antiforeigner sentiment, national stereotypes,\nP\u00f6llmann, 2009). Across different national contexts, higher\nlevels of formal education have been shown to correlate\nwith lower levels of ethnic exclusionism, nationalism, and\nTo examine associations between people's educational\nbackground and the importance that they ascribe to ancestry\nas marker of national membership, let us now compare sub-\nsamples of respondents with comparatively low and com-\nparatively high levels of formal education. For the purposes\nof this article, I define those ISSP 2003 respondents who\nclassified their level of formal education within one of the\nfollowing categories as having a high level of formal educa-\ntion: \"higher secondary completed,\" or \"above higher sec-\nondary level,\" or \"university degree completed.\"\nFurthermore, I regard those respondents who classified their\nlevel of formal education within one of the following cate-\ngories as having a low level of formal education: \"no formal\nqualification,\" or \"lowest formal qualification,\" or \"above\nTable 2 shows significant variations in people's percep-\ntions of ancestry as marker of Britishness/Germanness\ndepending on their level of formal education.\nIn England as well as in Germany, respondents with com-\nparatively high levels of formal education are significantly\nless likely to regard ancestry as important in terms of what\nthey think it means to be \"truly\" British/German.

Yet, neither large-scale\nsurvey data nor legal provisions confirm this expectation. If\nanything, public opinion in Germany seems to reflect recent\ndevelopments toward more ethnically inclusive legal defini-\ntions of Germanness.\nAs a matter of fact, respondents in Germany do not tend\nto ascribe more importance to ancestry as marker of\nnational membership than respondents in England. While\nthe respective ISSP data reveal only minor cross-national\nvariations in public opinion (see Table 1), they do provide\nconclusive evidence that--in both countries--respondents\nwith comparatively high levels of formal education are sig-\nnificantly less likely to regard ancestry as important in\nterms of what they think it means to be \"truly\" British/\nGerman (see Table 2).\nHowever, even if in the eyes of many respondents--\nparticularly the comparatively \"more educated\"--ancestry\ndoes not seem to constitute an important criterion for national\nmembership, the respective survey data also demonstrate\nthat a majority (albeit a narrow one) does indeed consider\nancestral ties as fairly or very important.\nBased on a simple answer to a survey question, it would, of\ncourse, be inadequate to stigmatize respondents who ascribe a\nhigh importance to ancestral ties as (potential) racists or xeno-\nphobes.And yet, the respective results cannot be entirely sepa-\nrated from the fact that ethnocentrism, racism, and xenophobia\nare alive and well in contemporary multicultural societies--\nincluding Britain and Germany (Chakraborti & Garland,\neasily, the perceived right to national membership can be\ngrounded in exclusionary notions of a \"shared ancestry\"--\noften paired with an emphasis on what Weber (1968) calls the\n\"esthetically conspicuous differences of the physical appear-\nance\" (p. 390)--skin color being a pertinent example.\nIn a time of increasing global interconnectedness, with\nsoaring levels of international migration across ethno-cul-\ntural boundaries, research on civic and ethnic dimensions in\npeople's notions of legitimate national membership--of\nwhat they think it means to be \"truly\" British, German,\nChinese, Indian, Russian, or Mexican--deserves a sustained\nacademic interest. International comparative research on the\nexplanatory impact of people's educational background\nseems particularly promising in this context. In any case,\nhowever, future research can do without crude distinctions\ninto civic and ethnic nations.\n"
