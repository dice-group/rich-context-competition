Mixtures of these contaminants could act together to\ninduce more pronounced effects than the sum of the individual contaminants. To evaluate the effects of such mixtures, it is\nof importance to assess the co-variance amongst the contaminants. Thirty-seven environmental contaminants representing\ndifferent classes were measured in blood samples from 1016 individuals aged 70 years. Hierarchical cluster analysis and\nprincipal component analysis were used to assess the co-variation among the contaminants. Within each identified cluster,\npossible marker contaminants were sought for. We validated our findings using data from the National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES) 2003--2004 study. Two large clusters could be identified, one representing low/medium\nchlorinated polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) (r6 chlorine atoms), as well as two pesticides and one representing medium/high\nchlorinated PCBs (Z6 chlorine atoms). PCBs 118 and 153 could be used as markers for the low/medium chlorinated cluster and\nPCBs 170 and 209 could be used as markers for the medium/high chlorinated cluster. This pattern was similar to data from the\nNHANES study. Apart from the PCBs, little co-variation was seen among the contaminants. Thus, a large number of chemicals\nhave to be measured to adequately identify mixtures of environmental contaminants.\nKeywords: mixtures; environmental contaminants; multivariate analysis\nINTRODUCTION\nnumber of these chemicals are considered environmental\ncontaminants as they are toxic, persist in the environment,\nbiomagnify through the food web, and pose a risk of causing\nadverse effects in humans and animals. Some of those have been\nbanned for use in Europe and the USA, such as dichlorodiphenyl-\ntrichlorethane (DDT) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), but\nDDT is still used in numerous developing countries and, owing to\nits long-range transport characteristics, is still spread around the\nglobe. Other chemicals with proven or suspected negative health\neffects are still in high-volume production, such as bisphenol A\n(BPA) and phthalates. Furthermore, health problems associated\nwith the industrial use of some metals, including aluminum,\ncadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), and copper, are still of\nglobal concern.\nFrom this perspective, it is apparent that we are exposed to a\ngreat variety of chemical compounds in our daily lives, a fact that\nhas been highlighted by many authorities. A recent report from\nthe EU, for example, was devoted to this issue of ``mixture\ntoxicology'',2 in which it was pointed out that, in the experimental\nsetting, this type of toxicology has become more central and well-\ndeveloped over the last decade. It is now accepted that a mixture\nof contaminants could induce more pronounced effects than the\nsum of its individual components.3 However, very little is known\nabout the effects of these mixtures of compounds in humans, as\nmuch of our knowledge is based on experimental studies of\nlaboratory animals. For obvious reasons, it is not possible to\nexpose humans to mixtures of compounds in a controlled fashion.\nThus, we have to rely mainly on measurements of circulating or\nurinary levels of the compounds for an assessment of exposure.\nHowever, only a few studies of reasonable size have determined\ncirculating or urinary levels of a large number of environmental\ncontaminants. Thus, we have only limited knowledge of how\nenvironmental contaminants derived from different sources co-\nvary. There have been some studies regarding the grouping of\nPCBs4--6 and although the scope and conclusions differ slightly\namong the studies, they suggest at least some co-variation among\nPCBs in humans.\nThe investigation of the co-variation among a large number of\nenvironmental contaminants is an important first step in the\nevaluation of mixtures in humans, as if there is considerable\nshared variation between the different contaminants, we only\nhave to measure some selected marker contaminants to assess\nmixtures. If the contaminants show small intercorrelations, one\nhas to measure a larger number of chemicals to be able to study\nthe health effects of mixtures.\nIn the Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala\nSeniors (PIVUS) study,7 we focused on measurements of circulat-\ning levels of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) listed in the\nStockholm Convention. The POPs studied were 16 PCB congeners,\nthree organochlorine (OC) pesticides, one dioxin, and one\nbrominated flame retardant.8 The study also included 11 metals,9\n4 phthalate metabolites, and BPA A measured in 1016 subjects in\n1Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden; 2Department of Medicine, Uppsala University, University\nHospital, Uppsala, Sweden; 3Uppsala Clinical Research Center, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden; 4MTM Research Centre, School of Science and Technology, O\n\u00a8 rebro University,\nO\n\u00a8 rebro, Sweden.

The second aim was to contrast\nour findings for the PCBs to the grouping suggested in the\nliterature. Finally, we validated our findings using data from the\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Study.11\nThe PIVUS Study\nEligible to the study were all subjects aged 70 living in the community of\nUppsala, Sweden. The subjects were randomly chosen from the register of\ncommunity living. A total of 1016 subjects participated in the baseline\ninvestigation, giving a participation rate of 50.1%. The subjects went\nthrough an extensive physical examination and were subjected to blood\nwithdrawal. Blood samples were drawn in the morning after an overnight\nfast. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Uppsala\nUniversity and all the participants gave their informed consent before the\nstudy. More details on the cohort can be found elsewhere.7\nThe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)\nStudy\nNHANES is an annual investigation designed to assess the health and\nnutritional status in a representative sample of the US population. The\nstudy combines questionnaires with thorough physical examinations, and\ndata from this study can thus be used to monitor time trends of major\ndiseases and risk factors. Some of the environmental contaminants\nmeasured in our study were also measured in the NHANES study and\nvalidity of our findings in an independent data set.11\nChemical Analysis\nMetals. All 11 metal elements in this study were determined in whole\nblood. The analysis was performed using inductively coupled plasma-\nsector field mass spectrometry after microwave-assisted digestion with\nnitric acid12 according to a method accredited for 10 of the 11 metal\nelements tested, with aluminium being unaccredited. Further details can\nbe found elsewhere.9\nBPA and Phthalates. Human serum was analyzed for levels of BPA and\nten phthalate metabolites (mono-[2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl] phthalate;\nmono [2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl] phthalate; mono-[2-ethylhexyl] phthalate\n(MEHP); monobenzyl phthalate; monocyclohexyl phthalate; monoethyl\nphthalate (MEP); monoisobutyl phthalate (MIBP); monoisononyl phthalate;\nmonomethyl phthalate (MMP); and mono-n-octyl phthalate (MOP)) at ALS\nCanada following the general procedures presented by the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention.13,14 Detectable levels were found in\nalmost all subjects for four phthalate metabolites, MEHP, MEP MIBP, and\nMMP. Further details can be found elsewhere.10\nPersistent Organic Pollutants. POP levels were analysed in stored\nplasma samples.8 A total of 23 POPs were measured: 16 PCBs; five OC\npesticides: p,p0-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p0-DDE), hexachloro-\nbenzene (HCB), cis-chlordane, trans-chlordane and trans-nonachlor (TNC);\noctachlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin (OCDD); and one polybrominated\ndiphenyl ether (BDE47). Briefly, samples were prepared using solid-phase\nextraction and analysed using high resolution gas chromatography\ncoupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry. Among the 23 POPs\nmeasured, the detection rate was above 95.5% for all POPs except OCDD\nchlordane, with detection rates of less than 10% in the study population\nwere not included in the final statistical analyses. Plasma concentrations\nwere lipid adjusted and are expressed as ng/g lipid.\nStatistical Methods\nIdentifying clusters of contaminants. Hierarchical cluster analysis was\nused to assess possible clustering of contaminants. The cluster analysis uses\nthe similarities between the elements and constructs variable clusters based\non these similarities. For this analysis, we defined the similarity using\nHoeffding's D statistic,15 which allows for non-linear and non-monotonic\ndependencies between the variables. The value of 30*D ranges from \u00c00.5 to\n1, with \u00c00.5 indicating complete independence and 1 indicating complete\ndependence. In the presence of a large number of ties, however, the value\ncould be smaller. We used complete-linkage clustering in which the distance\n(1-similarity) between clusters at each stage is determined by the distance\nbetween the two points, one from each cluster, that are farthest away from\neach other. Cluster stability was assessed using multiscale, multistage\nbootstrapping.16 The procedure assesses the frequency of which the\nobserved clustering is similar in repeated resampling, with sampling\nfractions ranging from 0.5 to 1.4, from the original data. These observed\nfrequencies correspond to bootstrap probability values (BP) and z-scores for\nthe BP-values for each sampling fraction were calculated according to\nz \u00bc F\u00c01(BP), where F\u00c01( \u00c1 ) is the inverse of the standard normal distribution\nfunction. For each cluster, a line is then fitted to the z-values by\nz l\n\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc a\nffiffiffi\nl\np\n\u00fe b\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nffi\np\n, where l denotes the sampling fraction. Asymptoti-\ncally unbiased probability values (AU) were then calculated for each cluster\nby AU \u00bc F(\u00c0a \u00fe b).17 We defined a stable cluster if a cluster had an\nfraction to evaluate the cluster stability. Additional analyses were done by\nexamining the clustering pattern by body mass index (BMI) divided into\nIdentifying Suitable Markers within Each Cluster/Subgroup. We used\nprincipal component analysis (PCA) to identify possible marker contami-\nnants. To render the PCA more effective, the contaminants were\ntransformed using a nonlinear, additive transformation.18 Briefly, each\ncontaminant was expanded as restricted cubic splines with five knots and\nthe transformation that had the highest correlation with the best linear\ncombination of the remaining contaminants, that is, the first canonical\nvariate, was used. Each cluster/subgroup was represented by the first\nprincipal component score resulting from a PCA of the variables in each\ncluster/subgroup. We then used a multiple linear regression model to\nmodel the cluster/subgroup score, using restricted cubic splines with three\nknots placed at the 10th, 50th and 90th percentiles of the contaminant\ndistribution for each contaminant, and assessed the decrease in R2\nresulting from dropping each contaminant at a time until no contaminants\nremained in the model. The contaminants left in a model that had an R2 of\nat least 0.95 against the cluster/subgroup summary score could then be\nused as markers for the entire cluster/subgroup.\nAssessing the Pattern of Missing Values. Values below the limit of\ndetection (LOD) were replaced by LOD/O2. The pattern of missing values\namong the contaminants was assessed with hierarchical cluster analysis,\nusing the fraction of missing data in common between any two variables\nas a similarity measure. All analyses were made using R19 version 2.10.0,\nwith functions from the Hmisc20 and pvclust17 packages.\nValidation Using NHANES Data. To validate our findings, we used\ncorresponding contaminants and repeated our analyses using subjects\naged 70 years or older. The contaminants that were determined across the\nindividuals included in the NHANES data was 1128, although the number\nof POP samples ranged from 240 to 260 and the number of metal samples\nwas 976. We performed additional exploratory analyses and investigated\nthe clustering pattern in younger individuals as well.\nRESULTS\nDescriptive statistics for the studied variables are presented in\nTable 1. As can be seen when comparing the percentiles, almost\nCo-variation of environmental contaminants\nLampa et al\nall variables are right-skewed. The total fraction of missing values\nwas 5.7%. Observations tended to be missing according to type,\nthat is, if one PCB was missing, the rest of the PCBs also tended to\nbe missing and so on. No obvious correlation between the\ncontaminant types could be seen in the pattern of missing values\nand therefore we did not impute the missing values. Figure 1 (top)\nshows the result of the hierarchical cluster analysis and the\nsubsequent stability analysis in the PIVUS data. Two clusters of\nPCB could be identified: one corresponding to low/medium\nchlorinated and one corresponding to medium/high chlorinated\nPCBs. TNC and HCB were parts of the low/medium chlorinated\nPCB cluster. PCB126 and PCB 169 did not seem to cluster with the\nother PCBs. The rest of the investigated contaminants do not\nseem to co-vary much. Figure 1 (bottom) shows the observed\nclustering in the NHANES data. Additional analyses in younger age\ngroups in the NHANES data revealed a similar picture. PCBs 138,\ncluster in individuals aged younger than 50 (data not shown).\nTwo principal components were enough to explain 490% of\nthe variablility in the medium/high chlorinated cluster. All PCBs\nloaded negative on the first component, whereas PCBs 194, 206\nand 209 loaded negative on the second component as well. PCBs\ncomponent, suggesting two subgroups within the medium/high\nchlorinated cluster. Figure 2 shows these findings. For the low/\nmedium chlorinated cluster, three components were needed to\nexplain 4 90% of the cluster variability. All contaminants in the\nlow/medium chlorinated cluster, except HCB, loaded negative on\nthe first component. For the contaminants that loaded positive on\nall loaded negative on the third component, suggesting two\nsubgroups within the low/medium chlorinated cluster as well.\nFigure 3 (top) shows the loadings for those contaminants in the\nlow/medium chlorinated cluster that scored positive on the third\ncomponent and Figure 3 (bottom) shows the loadings for the\ncontaminants that loaded negative on the third component. From\nFigures 2 and 3 it seems plausible that four subgroups exist within\neach cluster and that HCB and TNC really are not part of the low/\nmedium chlorinated cluster. No obvious clustering could be\ndiscerned for the remainder of the variables. Using linear\nregression within each subgroup with the subgroup-specific\nfirst principal component score as the outcome variable, we\ndeduced that PCBs 118 and 153 could be useful markers for the\nTable 1.

PCBs 118 and\nsubgroup's variance. This indicates that some clustering occurs\namong the contaminants, but in general the contaminants co-vary\nlittle. The additional analysis by BMI did not alter the conclusions\nas the clustering pattern was very similar in the three BMI groups\nas shown in Figure 4.\nDISCUSSION\nThe main findings in the present study was that except for two\nPCB-clusters and four subgroups within them, little shared\nvariation was seen for the circulating levels of the investigated\nenvironmental contaminants. The practical implication of this\nfinding is that when studying the effect of mixtures of these\ncompounds, one has to analyze circulating levels of most of these\ninvestigated compounds. Only for the PCBs could a reduction in\nmeasured circulating congeners be performed using marker\ncontaminants.\nas TNC and HCB, were similar to those reported in men21 and\nwomen22 from the general population of Sweden. This is hardly\nsurprising, as the studied subjects originate from the same area,\neven though subjects in our study were slightly older. Two distinct\nclusters could be identified among the POPs based on measure-\nments of circulating levels, one cluster representing the low-\nchlorinated PCBs and one representing highly chlorinated PCBs.\nPCBs have previously been classified into group depending on their\ndegree of chlorination5 or their biological properties.4,6 It is evident\nfrom the dendrogram in Figure 1 (top), however, that the unifying\ntheme within the two clusters is the degree of chlorination so our\nresults tend to agree more with the grouping into three categories\nbased on the level of chlorination proposed by Moysich et al.5 There\nare PCBs with six chlorine atoms in both clusters so the degree of\nchlorination is not alone responsible for our findings. PCBs 156 and\n157 have six chlorine atoms but are co-planar as opposed to PCBs\n153 and 138 so the structure may also have a part for PCBs with six\nchlorine atoms. The number of chlorine atoms in the PCBs is the\nmajor determinant of lipid solubility and thereby of the toxicoki-\nnetic properties of the compounds. It is well known that PCBs with a\nhigh degree of chlorination have a considerably longer half-life than\nthose with a lower degree of chlorination. We believe, therefore,\nthat the two PCB clusters are derived from the same sources of\nexposures and are retained in the body in a similar way because of\ntheir similar elimination half-life. However, similar elimination half-\nlife is not sufficient for the POPs to cluster in the present analysis.\nDDE, a breakdown product of DDT, has a similar elimination rate to\nthe highly chlorinated PCBs, but is not found, despite this\ncharacteristic, in the medium/high-chlorinated PCB cluster. This\nmight indicate that the route of exposure is not similar to that seen\nfor the high-chlorinated PCBs. Another explanation might be the\ntiming of the peak of exposure. In Sweden, DDT was banned several\nyears before PCBs were banned. Thus, even if the toxicokinetics of\nDDE and the medium/high chlorinated PCBs share similarities in\nterms of elimination half-life, the timing of exposure might\ninfluence the degree of co-variation between the compounds.\nFor further analysis of health effects of mixtures of POPs, a few\nmarker PCBs may be chosen from the low/medium chlorinated\nPCB cluster and from the medium/high chlorinated cluster,\nMo\nNi\nMEP\nBPA\nMMP\nZn\nMIBP\nDDE\nHg\nPb\nOCDD\nHCB\nTNC\nCr\nMEHP\nAl\nCu\nMn\nCd\nCo\nPIVUS\nDissimilarity (1 - 30 * Hoeffding D)\nCd\nPb\nHg\nOCDD\nNHANES\nDissimilarity (1 - 30 * Hoeffding D)\nFigure 1.

Most of the variation in circulating levels within those\nclusters is covered by these marker compounds. Based on our\nmarkers for the low/medium chlorinated cluster, and PCBs 170\nand 209 for the medium/high chlorinated cluster, each represent-\ning a subgroup within the clusters. PCBs 126 and 169, congeners\noften used in experimental research, do not co-vary with the other\nPCBs, and must therefore be measured in analysis of health effects\nof mixtures. Thus, the 16 measured PCBs could be reduced to four\nmarker PCBs, apart from PCBs 126 and 169, without any major loss\nof information. PCBs 153 and 156 have previously been suggested\nas markers of PCB exposure in a similar population.21 A difference\nbetween that study and this is that they sought markers that\npredicted the total amount of PCB, that is, a sum of the individual\ncongeners, whereas we used principal component scores as our\nsummary measures. This study confirms the suitability of PCB 153\nas a marker contaminant and that PCB 156 does cluster with PCBs\ncontaminant, so in general our results agree with those in Glynn\net al.21 However, they did not find markers for low-chlorinated\nPCBs, whereas we found two markers that were representative of\nthe low/medium chlorinated cluster.\nDDE has often been used a marker substance of POP exposure.\nOur study shows that as the correlation with other POPs is poor,\nmeasurements of DDE must be complemented by measurements\nof other POPs to obtain the greater picture needed for the study\nof health effects of mixtures.\nPlastic-Associated Compounds\nThe plastic-associated compounds analyzed in the present study,\nBPA and phthalates, are high-volume chemicals that have been\nused for decades. These compounds have a considerably faster\nelimination compared with the POPs. Short-branched phthalates\nare excreted in urine as its monoester, whereas more\nlong-branched phthalates undergo several biotransformations.23\nFrom this standpoint, it is not surprising that the plastic-associated\ncompounds do not cluster with the POPs, as the kinetics and\nthe daily exposure of these agents are very different from the\nPOPs. Thus, in order to evaluate the toxic effects of mixtures\nof POPs and the plastic-associated compounds, it is obvious\nthat measurements of these compounds in the circulation must\nThird principal component  0\nFirst principal component\nSecond principal component\nTNC\nThird principal component < 0\nFirst principal component\nSecond principal component\nHCB\nFigure 3.

It is therefore not surprising that they do not\nco-vary with each other or with the POPs or plastic-associated\nchemicals. Thus, measurements of circulating levels of these\ncompounds must also be included in the evaluation of the\nbiological effects of mixtures of environmental compounds.\nAge, Gender and BMI\nThe present examination was performed in an elderly population.\nAs levels of POPs tend to increase by age because of their\nchemical properties and as the highest levels of BPA are found in\nchildren,24 it is evident that the findings in the present study\ncannot automatically be extrapolated to younger subjects. The\nadditional analyses in the NHANES data in younger age groups\nrevealed similar patterns, although the clustering of the PCB\ncongeners with six chlorine atoms differed slightly, possibly\nindicating a third cluster giving further support to the grouping\nproposed by Moysich et al.5 Furthermore, as exposure to some\nPOPs, like the OC pesticides and PCBs, is lower nowadays\ncompared with some decades back, each generation is exposed\nto different mixtures of environmental pollutants, a fact that has to\nbe remembered when evaluating the biological effects of\nenvironmental exposures in humans. Although gender differences\nhave been reported for some of the chemicals evaluated in the\npresent study, we did not find any major differences between\nmen and women regarding the co-variation of the environmental\npollutants evaluated in the present study (data not shown). With\nlevels of contaminants in human tissue over time being possibly\ninfluenced by BMI, under the assumption of a similar total body\nuptake,25 clustering patterns could also differ depending on BMI.\nIn this study, we could not demonstrate differences in clustering\npatterns, indicating that the relationships between the contami-\nnants are not affected much by differences in BMI.\nValidation Using the NHANES Data\nA comparison with data from the NHANES study reveals a striking\nsimilarity. It is not surprising that levels of the individual conta-\nminants differ, as we are comparing individuals from different popu-\nlations, but the fact that the contaminants cluster in a similar\nmanner gives further weight to our findings.\nMethodological Considerations\nAs cluster analysis results are sensitive to the method used to\ncalculate the distances between the clusters, we applied several\nmethods and visually compared the results. Clustering based on\ndifferent methods provided similar results. Two clusters of PCBs\ncould be discerned and they appeared somewhat correlated with\neach other in some graphs. We chose the complete-linkage\nmethod for ease of interpretation as it seeks to form as compact\nclusters as possible, in contrast to the single-linkage technique,\nwhich tends to maximize connectedness between clusters. Other\nclustering techniques tend to produce results in between the\ncomplete- and the single-linkage methods. Other dissimilarity\nmeasures, such as the absolute value of the ordinary Spearman\nrank correlation or the squared Spearman rank correlation,\nshowed similar clustering patterns, indicating possible non-linear\nbut not necessarily non-monotonic relationships between the\ncontaminants.\nWe chose to transform the contaminants using canonical variate\nanalysis. Other approaches may be the natural log-transform or the\nthe Box-Cox transformation, but our choice is more tailored to this\nspecific situation in that it maximizes the correlation between\nthe transformed variables and thereby makes them more useful for\nthe PCA.\nIn conclusion, there seems to be little co-variation among\nenvironmental contaminants in the circulation. PCBs clustered into\ntwo cluster and four subgroups within the clusters mainly based on\ntheir chlorination, that is, the number of chlorine atoms. This has\nimplications for further studies on the health effect of mixtures of\ncontaminants, as one has to measure the circulating levels of a large\nnumber of individual contaminants to obtain necessary information\non exposure of different compounds, with the exception of the\nPCBs where certain marker compounds could be used.\nABBREVIATIONS\nBMI, body mass index; BPA, bisphenol A; Cd, cadmium; Co, cobalt;\nDDT, dichlorodiphenyltrichlorethane; HCB, hexachlorobenzene;\nHg, mercury; LOD, limit of detection; MEHP, mono-2-ethylhexyl\nphthalate; MEP, monoethyl phthalate; MIBP, mono-isobutyl\nphthalate; MMP, mono-methyl phthalate; NHANES, National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey; OC, organochloride;\nOCDD, octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin; Pb, lead; PCA, principal\ncomponent analysis; PCBs, polychlorinated biphenyls; PIVUS,\nProspective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors;\nPOPs, persistent organic pollutants; TNC, trans-nonachlor\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\n"
