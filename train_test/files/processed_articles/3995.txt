    "abstract": "Abstract\nWe explored themes related to sexual desire (lust) and romantic desire (love) in the lyrics of popular music over the past\n40 years. We examined whether there have been changes in the prevalence of lust and love themes and changes in how\nthese themes inter-relate in music lyrics over time. The study sample consisted of the top 40 songs of Billboard Year End Hot\nsongs with a love theme and in the proportion of songs with a combination of lust and love themes. In contrast, there was\na significant increase in the proportion of songs with a theme focusing on lust in the absence of love. Themes of lust in the\nabsence of love were especially prevalent in hip-hop/rap music, although music genre did not account for the changing themes\nover time. These shifts in themes found in popular music may both influence cultural norms and reflect a cultural shift toward\nacceptance of sexuality outside of love relationships.\n",

Although these media portrayals likely\nreflect current cultural norms related to sexuality, they may\nalso help shape young people's sexual attitudes and sexual\nscripts, especially given a lack of personal experience to\ndraw upon (cf. Huston et al., 1992). In fact, U.S. teens rank\nmass media as one of the most important sources of sexual\ninformation (Sutton, Brown, Wilson, & Klein, 2002). Popular\nmusic contains more sexual content than other forms of\nmedia directed toward young people (Pardun, L'Engle, &\nBrown, 2005), and music is among the most popular forms\nof media for this age group (Rideout, Foehr, & Roberts,\nspent an average of 16 hr a week listening to music, a large\nincrease over previous years (Rideout et al., 2010).\nStudies have documented relatively high rates of sexual\ncontent in popular music. For instance, more than a third of\npopular songs in 2005 contained references to sexual activity\n(Primack, Gold, Schwarz, & Dalton, 2008). The sexual con-\ntent of popular music tends to reflect stereotyped gender\nroles, with women presented as sexual objects for the plea-\nsure of men. For instance, in music videos, women (both art-\nists and secondary characters in the videos) are much more\nlikely than men to be scantily clad, to be held to strict stan-\ndards of physical attractiveness, and to be shown dancing in\na sexually provocative manner (Aubrey & Frisby, 2011).\nMoreover, sexual content varies by musical genre, with rap\nmusic tending to feature the highest levels of sexual\nobjectification of women and country music featuring the\nlowest levels (e.g., Aubrey & Frisby, 2011; Primack et al.,\n2008). Moreover, hip-hop and rap lyrics are more likely to\ndisplay men as hyper-masculine and sex-focused than are\nother genres (Ward, 2013). Of particular concern, there is\nevidence that exposure to sexually explicit music and music\nvideos is associated with more permissive sexual attitudes,\nbehavior, and intentions among young adults (Pardun et al.,\ninitial evidence suggests that exposure to objectifying and\ndegrading music in early adolescence may increase the like-\nlihood of early sexual activity (Martino et al., 2006).\nNot surprisingly, popular music has changed over time\nwithin Western society. For example, since the 1960s, popu-\nlar music has become sadder-sounding (Schellenberg & von\nScheve, 2012), as well as louder and less variable in pitch\nand timbre (Serr\u00e0, Corral, Bogu\u00f1\u00e1, Haro, & Arcos, 2012).\nContent analyses of music lyrics have indicated increases\nover the past 30 years in self-focused and antisocial words\n(DeWall, Pond, Campbell, & Twenge, 2011) and in refer-\nences to alcohol and other recreational substances\n(Christenson, Roberts, & Bjork, 2012). However, just one\nstudy has examined long-term changes in the sexual content\n1Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada\nCorresponding Author:\nKim Bartholomew, Simon Fraser University, 8888 University Drive,\nBurnaby, British Columbia 5A 1S6, Canada.\nEmail: bartholo@sfu.ca\nThemes of Lust and Love in Popular Music\nYasaman Madanikia1 and Kim Bartholomew1\n Keywords\nmedia, music, lyrics, love, sexualization, culture\n2 SAGE Open\nof popular music. Hall, West, and Hill (2012) examined sex-\nualization, primarily defined as the sexual objectification of\n10-year intervals). The proportion of songs with sexualiza-\nthe range of 6% to 11%; in contrast, there was a jump in the\n(Hall et al., 2012). Although songs performed by men and by\nnon-White artists were more likely to contain sexualization\nthan those performed by women and White artists, the 2009\nincrease in sexualization was observed independently of art-\nist demographics.\nPrior studies focusing on the sexual content of popular\nmusic have taken varied approaches to coding sexual con-\ntent. Often researchers have coded whether song lyrics or\nvideos contain references to specific sexual acts or specific\nsome studies, researchers have combined any indications of\nsexuality (including presentation of dating, kissing, nudity,\nsexual intercourse, etc.), based on some findings that overall\nproportion of sexual content is more important than the par-\nticular form of sexuality shown (e.g., Brown et al., 2006;\nPardun et al., 2005). In other studies, researchers have distin-\nguished between objectifying or degrading sexual content\nand less offensive sexual content based on the expectation\nthat it is objectifying content that is likely to have a more\ndetrimental effect on adolescents' attitudes, scripts, and\nbehaviors (e.g., Martino et al., 2006; Primack, Douglas, Fine,\n& Dalton, 2009). However, sexualization, objectification,\nand degradation are conceptualized differently across studies\nand have often been defined quite broadly. For example, Hall\net al. (2012) included evidence of a large sexual appetite as\nan indicator of sexualized lyrics (also referred to as degrad-\ning lyrics), and Aubrey and Frisby (2011) considered an art-\nist engaging in provocative dance to be objectifying\nthemselves. Moreover, there was a strong overlap between\nrating lyrics as degrading and as being about casual sex in\nMartino and colleagues' (2006) study of teen music con-\nsumption, suggesting that casual and explicit sexual refer-\nences were, with few exceptions, categorized as degrading.\nCurrent Study\nThere is widespread public concern that sexual content is\nincreasing in the media, and that this content may have harm-\nful effects on impressionable youth (Hetsroni, 2007).\nMoreover, there is growing evidence that sexual content in\npopular media, including popular music, can help to shape\nviewers' conceptions of sexuality and sexual behavior (e.g.,\nBleakley, Hennessy, Fishbein, & Jordan, 2008; Martino et\nstudy of sexual content in music lyrics can help provide a\nhistorical perspective on the current state of sexuality in pop-\nular music, as well as helping to anticipate future trends.\nHowever, there is limited information on long-term trends in\nthe depiction of sexuality in popular music. Although a few\nstudies have considered trends based on qualitative analyses\nand/or over just a few years (e.g., Bretthauer, Zimmerman, &\nassessed sexualization in the lyrics of popular music over a\nperiod of decades.\nWe sought to conceptually replicate Hall et al.'s (2012)\nstudy of sexualization in the lyrics of popular music over 40\nyears, as well as to extend and build on this work. First, we\ntook a somewhat different approach to coding the sexual\ncontent of music lyrics. Rather than coding specific sexual\nacts or making difficult judgments about whether particular\nlyrics are objectifying or degrading, we assessed the underly-\ning themes presented in music lyrics. We examined whether\nsongs included an expression of sexual desire for another\nperson or persons, what we refer to as a theme of lust.\nSecond, in addition to considering sexual themes in music\nlyrics, we considered whether there have been any shifts in\nthe prevalence with which songs deal with themes of roman-\ntic love. By considering both lust and love themes in popular\nmusic, we were able to examine whether there have been\nchanges in how these two themes inter-relate in music lyrics\nover time. Finally, we assessed music lyrics at 5-year inter-\nvals, rather than 10-year intervals, as done by Hall et al.\n(2012), in the hope that this would provide a clearer picture\nof any changes over time.\nWe also considered two potential mediators of any\nchanges in the themes found in popular music over time: art-\nist gender and musical genre. Based on previous research\nindicating that male artists are more likely than female artists\nto sing songs with sexualized and degrading lyrics (e.g., Hall\net al., 2012), we examined whether artist gender was related\nto lust and love themes in popular music and, in turn, whether\nartist gender accounted for changes in lust and love themes\nover time. Based on previous research suggesting that sexual\nobjectification is more common in some musical genres than\nothers (e.g., Aubrey & Frisby, 2011), we examined whether\ngenre was related to lust and love themes in popular music\nand, in turn, whether genre accounted for changes in lust and\nlove themes over time.\nTo summarize our research questions,\nResearch Question 1: Have themes related to lust and\nlove, and how these themes inter-relate, changed in popu-\nResearch Question 2: Is artist gender related to lust and\nlove themes in popular music, and do changes in artist\ngender account for changes in these themes from 1971 to\nResearch Question 3: Is music genre related to lust and\nlove themes in popular music, and do changes in music\ngenres account for changes in these themes from 1971 to\nMadanikia and Bartholomew 3\nMethod\nProcedure\nWe identified the top 40 songs from the Billboard Year End\nBillboard Charts rank songs according to sales and down-\nloads, frequency of radio airplay in the United States, and\nfrequency of digital streaming. The final sample consisted of\nmost recent year available when data collection began).\nThere were three song lyrics with non-English content: one\nin German and two a combination of English and Spanish.\nThe non-English lyrics were translated into English with\nGoogle Translate, and a native speaker of each non-English\nlanguage then reviewed the translations and made any neces-\nsary revisions.\nSong lyrics were coded for references to the themes of\nlust and love. Two coders first reviewed lyrics from 40 songs\nnot included in the sample to clarify the codes and establish\nan acceptable level of reliability. One coder (the first author)\ncoded all lyrics in the target sample. A second coder coded\nas a reliability check. Reliability for the categorical lust and\nlove themes was assessed via percent agreement and Cohen's\nKappa.\nMeasures\nLust. The theme of lust was defined as expressions of sexual\ndesire or longing for another person or persons. A lust theme\nmay or may not include explicit references to sexual acts or\nto sexually attractive characteristics of the person of interest.\nAs well, a lust theme could take place in a variety of rela-\ntional contexts, including no contact with the desired person\n(e.g., observing the person dancing in a club), a casual sexual\nencounter with the desired person, and an ongoing romantic\nrelationship with the desired person. Thus, the lust theme\nmay or may not take place within the context of a loving\nrelationship. Percent agreement was .88 for the lust theme\nLove.The theme of love was defined as expressions of\nromantic love or caring for a potential, current, or past\nromantic partner, as well as any content that involved a\nromantic relationship. The theme of love may or may not\nalso involve expressions of sexual desire. Percent agreement\nwas .94 for the love theme (Kappa = .88).\nSecondary variables. To allow us to explore how lust and love\nthemes may relate to one another over time, we derived three\nadditional secondary codes based on the primary lust and\nlove coded variables. Lyrics that contained the love theme,\nbut not the lust theme, were classified as love only. For\nexample, a lyric expressing love to a desired, actual, or past\nlove interest without any expression of sexual desire would\nbe classified as love only (see Table 1 for an example lyric).\nConversely, lyrics that contained the lust theme, but not the\nlove theme, were classified as lust only. For example, a lyric\nfocusing on sexual desire toward a desired or actual sexual\npartner, with no accompanying expression of caring or lov-\ning, would be classified as lust only (see Table 1 for an exam-\nple lyric). Finally, lyrics that contained both lust and love\nthemes were classified as combined lust and love. For exam-\nple, a lyric expressing a combination of both sexual desire\nand love for a romantic partner would be classified as com-\nbined lust and love (see Table 1 for an example lyric).\nGender of artist. Gender of the recording artist was coded as\neither male (for male soloists or all-male duos/groups),\nfemale (for female soloists or all-female duos/groups), or\ncombined gender (duos or groups).\nMusical genre. Because there are no sources that categorize\nall individual songs by genre, we used the genre of the per-\nforming artist as an indicator of the song genre. Artist genre\nwas determined through iTunes 11.1.3. Each artist was cate-\ngorized under one of the following genres: pop, rock, dance,\nhip-hop/rap, R&B/soul, alternative, country, jazz, musique\nfrancophone, reggae, electronic, foreign, Latino, singer/song\nwriter, inspirational, vocal, and blues. Thus, artists were\nidentified by their main genre only. Songs performed by mul-\ntiple artists from different genres were given multiple genre\ncodes.\nResults\nTo analyze potential changes in the proportion of lyrics with\nvarious themes over the 9 years studied, we undertook a series\nof ANOVAs with year as the independent variable and theme\ncodes as the dependent variables. We considered unweighted\nlinear, quadratic, and cubic trends over time. In reporting\nresults, we describe significant trends over time only.\nLust and Love Themes\nPrevalence of themes.To clarify associations between the\ntwo primary themes coded (lust and love), we have presented\nthe proportion of the music lyrics with each theme in\nTable 2.1 Across the entire sample, 80% of lyrics contained\nthemes of lust and/or love, with 39% of lyrics containing a\ntheme of lust and 62% containing a theme of love (as indi-\ncated by the marginal proportions). The secondary classifica-\ntions (lust only, love only, and combined lust/love) indicate\nhow the two primary codes inter-relate. Specifically, 19% of\nlyrics showed lust only (with no love theme), 42% showed\nlove only (with no lust theme), and 20% of music lyrics con-\ntained themes of both lust and love. Thus, about half of lyrics\nwith lust themes also had love themes, whereas about one\nthird of lyrics with love themes also had lust themes.\n4 SAGE Open\nFigure 1.

There was a lin-\near trend toward an increasing proportion of women artists,\ntions between artist gender and any of the identified themes\n(lust, love, lust only, love only, or combined lust/love). For\ninstance, lyrics coded as lust only made up 19% of songs\nperformed by male artists, 16% of songs performed by\nfemale artists, and 28% of songs performed by combined\ngender artists. We repeated all of the analyses examining\nchanges in themes over time controlling for gender of artist\nand the findings remained unchanged. Thus, gender of artist\ndid not account for the systematic changes in lust and love\nthemes in popular music over time.\nMusic Genre\nThe breakdown by genre across the entire sample was as fol-\n4% dance, 4% country, 2% alternative, and 6% other.2 There\nwere some systematic shifts in song genres appearing in the\ntop 40 songs of Billboard Year End Hot 100 over time.\nassociated with the lust and love themes. Hip-hop/rap was\nstrongly associated with less love (24% vs. 67% in all other\ngenres) and love only (5% vs. 46% in other genres) themes,\nand more lust (74% vs. 34% in other genres) and lust only\nwith less lust (25% vs. 42% in all other genres) and lust only\nWe repeated all of the analyses examining changes in\nthemes over time controlling for the hip-hop/rap and rock\ngenres. We did not control for the other genres because they\nwere not related to music themes and therefore could not\nmediate changes in themes over time. Rock had minimal\nimpact on changes in themes over time, with all findings\nremaining unchanged. Although the hip-hop/rap genre\naccounted for significant variation in all themes other than\ncombined lust/love, controlling for this genre did not alter\nthe general pattern of previously reported changes in\nthemes over time. Notably, all linear trends remained the\nsame--with love and combined lust/love decreasing over\ntime and lust only increasing over time. Thus, music genre\ndid not account for the shifts in lust and love themes over\ntime.\nDiscussion\nWe examined themes related to lust, the expression of sexual\ndesire, and love, the expression of romantic desire, in the lyr-\nics of the 40 most popular songs over the past 40 years.\nThemes of love were more common than those of lust, with\n62% of lyrics containing a love theme and 39% containing a\nlust theme across the entire sample of songs. Contrary to the\ngeneral trend in Western society toward an increased visibil-\nity and accessibility of sexual content across multiple soci-\netal domains (Attwood, 2009), we did not find that themes of\nlust increased systematically over the study period. However,\nthe proportion of songs with a theme of love did decrease\nover the study period. Interestingly, moving into this century,\nthe proportion of songs with themes of lust became compa-\nrable with, and even surpassed, the proportion of songs with\nthemes of love.\nThe shift in lyric themes was clarified by examining how\nthe themes of lust and love inter-related over time. From the\novertures were most common, followed by combined themes\nof lust and love. From 2001 onward, we observed a shift\ntoward themes of lust only becoming more common and out-\nstripping themes of lust and love combined. Put another way,\nthere was a notable shift from lust themes being presented in\nthe context of romantic feelings toward lust themes being\npresented in the absence of romance. We suspect that these\nchanges reflect a growing cultural acceptance of sexuality\noutside of the constraints of committed romantic relation-\nships (Garcia, Reiber, Massey, & Merriwether, 2012).\nFigure 2. Themes of lust only, love only, and combined lust/love\n6 SAGE Open\nOur findings are broadly consistent with Hall et al.'s\nwas defined largely in terms of sexual objectification,\nwhereby a person's value comes from his or her physical\nattractiveness and sexual appeal. We expect that sexualiza-\ntion would overlap substantially with lust only themes within\nour coding system because sexual desire in the absence of a\nrelational context or romantic interest is most likely objecti-\nfying (that is, only physical attraction comes into play). Hall\net al. (2012) found that sexualization did not increase from\nwith this pattern, we observed a notable increase in lust only\nthemes from 2001 onward. Our findings build on those of\nHall et al.'s (2012) by suggesting that the increase in objecti-\nfying sexual content is not a function of a general increase in\nsexual content, but rather stems from a drop in romantic con-\ntent and a disentangling of sexual content from romantic\ncontent.\nShifts in themes of lust and love in music lyrics likely\nreflect cultural changes in attitudes toward sexual and roman-\ntic relationships. We also considered other factors, specifi-\ncally gender of the performing artists and changes in the\npopularity of musical genres, which might play a role. In the\ncurrent study, artist gender was not associated with themes of\nlust and love. In contrast, Hall et al. (2012) found that male\nartists were more likely to perform songs containing sexual-\nization, although this effect was modest (male artists 14%,\nfemale artists 7%, and combined artists 13%). It is difficult to\ndirectly compare the current findings with those of Hall et al.\n(2012) because of different coding methods, samples, and\ntime points. As well, our smaller sample size (n = 360 vs. n =\n600 lyrics) may have compromised the power of our study to\ndetect small effects. Most importantly, however, in neither\nstudy did artist gender account for the observed changes in\nthe sexual content of popular song lyrics over time.\nThere have been systematic shifts in the genre makeup of\nthe top 40 songs of Billboard Year End Hot 100 over the past\n40 years. Based on iTunes genre classifications, songs in the\nhip-hop/rap, pop, and alternative genres have become\nincreasingly prevalent in the top 40, whereas rock has\nbecome less prevalent. However, just two genres were asso-\nciated with lust and love themes. Most notably, compared\nwith all other music genres, hip-hop and rap songs contained\nfewer love themes (both love and love only) and more lust\nthemes (both lust and lust only). In fact, lust only themes\nwere four times as likely to be found in hip-hop/rap music as\nin other musical genres. Consistent with this finding, previ-\nous research has documented more references to objectifying\nand degrading sex in rap music than in other popular genres\n2008). In contrast, rock music tended to contain fewer themes\nof lust and lust only than other musical genres. However, in\nspite of the strikingly high incidence of lust-related themes in\nthe hip-hop/rap genre, song genre did not account for the\nobserved changes in themes of lust and love in popular music\nover time.\nThe current findings may have implications for research\ninvestigating the potential impacts of sexual references in\npopular music. Martino et al. (2006) found that teen con-\nsumption of music with degrading sexual references, a desig-\nnation that largely overlaps with sex in a casual content as is\ncommon in hip-hop and rap music, was prospectively related\nto initiation of sexual activity. In contrast, consumption of\nmusic with non-degrading sexual references, largely sex\nwithin a relational context as is common in rock music, was\nnot associated with earlier sexual activity (Martino et al.,\n2006). These effects can be understood in terms of observa-\ntional learning (Bandura, 1977), whereby adolescents learn\nand internalize sexual attitudes and behaviors depicted in\nmedia. Moreover, according to cultivation theory (Gerber,\nGross, Morgan, & Signorielli, 1994), adolescents can come\nto believe that media reflects actual normative experiences of\nsexuality. Thus, lyrics with lust only themes may influence\nthe attitudes and behavior of some young listeners, perhaps\nnormalizing casual sex and earlier sex. Moreover, our find-\nings suggest that such non-relational sexual content has\nbecome increasingly prevalent in the most popular music.\nOn the other hand, experimental studies of the impact of\ndegrading music on sexual attitudes have been inconsistent\nat best (e.g., Alcorn & Lemieux, 2011; Sprankle & End,\nQuatman, & Heesacker, 1997). As well, findings of other\ncorrelational studies indicate that adolescents' exposure to\nsexual media content in general, regardless of the particular\nforms or themes of sexuality portrayed, is associated with\ntheir sexual activity, intentions, and normative perceptions\nlence of sexuality in any form is of most relevance, then con-\ncerns about the increased sexualization of popular music\nmay be unfounded given that sexual themes have not\nincreased systematically in popular music in the past 40\nyears.\nLimitations and Future Directions\nWe assessed song lyrics every 5 years over the past 40 years\nto explore changes in the themes of popular songs. It is pos-\nsible that some time-related changes between the chosen data\npoints have been overlooked. Although 5-year intervals do\nprovide a somewhat more detailed portrait than 10-year\nintervals (for instance, as used by Hall et al. [2012)] and\nChristenson et al. [2012]), it would be ideal to include popu-\nlar songs for every year of the time period under study. In\nparticular, more fine-grained analyses might help to clarify\nthe major shift in sexual and romantic themes that appears to\nhave taken place around the beginning of the 21st century.\nWe examined only the top 40 songs of the top 100 songs\nof each year. Inclusion of the top 100 songs would have\nallowed for greater generalization to all popular music. As\nMadanikia and Bartholomew 7\nwell, this approach systematically underrepresented some\ngenres of music that are popular with subgroups of the popu-\nlation, but that are not well represented in the Billboard\ncharts. For instance, sexual objectification is quite rare in\nwhich accounted for only 4% of songs in the current study.\nThus, we expect that a broader sampling of musical genres\nmay have revealed a lower level of lust themes than we\nuncovered. On the other hand, the top 40 songs of Billboard\nYear End Hot 100 represent those songs that are most popu-\nlar, and therefore potentially most influential, among adoles-\ncents and young adults.\nMore broadly, popular music is just one form of media,\nand other media such as television and cinema may differ in\ntheir depictions of sex and love over time (Wright, 2009).\nInterestingly, studies assessing changes in sexual content in\nteen-centered films and in prime-time television over the\npast three decades have failed to confirm the common\nassumption that sexual content is increasing across a range of\nmedia (Callister, Stern, Coyne, Robinson, & Bennion, 2011;\nHetsroni, 2007), although these studies did not consider the\nsocial context of sexual content. Research examining the\nimpact of media sexuality portrayals on youth sexuality out-\ncomes is shifting from a focus on individual media in isola-\ntion to consideration of exposure to multiple media\n(Annenberg Media Exposure Research Group, 2008).\nCorrespondingly, future research documenting shifts in\nmedia content over time would benefit from considering\nmultiple media in combination.\nWe coded themes portrayed in popular music by analyz-\ning written transcripts of music lyrics. A more holistic study\nof popular music themes would take into account contextual\nfactors such as artist portrayals, music video features, and\nmusical properties. As well, our coding of lust and love\nthemes failed to capture meaningful variation within these\nthemes. Although lyrics focusing on sex in a casual context\nare sometimes coded or interpreted as degrading (e.g., Hall\nlyrics coded as lust only contained positive and even ideal-\nized images of the person desired. Only a small minority of\nthese lyrics portrayed unwanted, disrespectful, or humiliat-\ning desire, often communicated through the use of deroga-\ntory words such as \"ho.\" Conversely, not all songs with lyrics\nof love presented positive portrayals of romantic desire;\nrather, a sizable portion of these lyrics portrayed unrequited\nlove, infidelity, and romantic rejection. Thus, it would be\nhelpful for future research to consider subthemes of lust and\nlove. Given that individuals of different ages and back-\ngrounds may interpret the same lyric in different ways, it\nwould also be informative to consider how consumers of\nthese popular songs interpret the lyrics.\nOur goal was to examine changes in sexual and romantic\nthemes in popular music over the past 40 years. We cannot\naddress the reasons for the observed changes, although the\nfindings suggest that these changes cannot be explained by\nshifts in artist gender or in the popularity of musical genres.\nMoreover, we did not address the potential impacts of the\nobserved changes in the sexual and romantic themes found in\npopular music. We expect, however, that popular media such\nas music, both reflect changing cultural norms and influence\nchange in cultural norms. At the individual level, we expect\nthat there is a reciprocal influence between individuals' sex-\nual attitudes and their exposure to popular music with sexual\ncontent (cf. Bleakley et al., 2008). In addition to further\nresearch examining the potential impacts on individuals who\nconsume music with particular themes, it would be valuable\nfor future research to consider how popular music themes\nrelated to sexuality change over time in relation to normative\nchanges in sexual attitudes and behaviors (cf. DeWall et al.,\nIn conclusion, contrary to popular assumptions that popu-\nlar music is becoming increasingly sexualized, our findings\nindicate that sexual themes in popular music have not\nincreased systematically over the past 40 years. However,\nthere has been a significant increase in the proportion of\nsongs with themes of lust in the absence of love.\nCorrespondingly, fewer songs portray sexual desire in the\ncontext of romantic feelings. Thus, by considering themes\nrelated to romantic desire as well as themes related to sexual\ndesire, we were able to provide further insight into the chang-\ning portrayal of sexuality in popular music.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNotes\n1.
