    "abstract": "Abstract\nClassic models of democratic political behavior imply that eliminating opportunities to vote early in person (EIP) negatively\naffects the political participation of voters who prefer to use that option. Nevertheless, several U.S. state legislatures recently\npassed or proposed laws to scale back their EIP voting operations. Such efforts have met with opposition, as both academic\nresearchers and federal courts have found that minority voters, especially African Americans, now utilize EIP voting at\nsignificantly higher rates than White voters. Prior to the 2012 presidential election, this argument was central to a federal\ncourt's decision to temporarily block legislation in Ohio that sought to cut several days from the state's EIP voting period.\nA post-election legal battle is reconsidering this matter, and the outcome will shape Ohio's voting rules going forward. This\narticle contributes empirical results to the discourse by estimating EIP voting take-up rates, by race, during the 2008 and 2012\nU.S. presidential elections in Ohio's three largest counties. Ecological inference models reveal that African Americans in all\nthree study areas voted EIP at substantially higher rates than White voters during both elections. These results are supported\nby decile tables that report early voting behavior for relatively racially homogeneous geographies, and by geovisualizations\nthat depict direct relationships between the spatial distributions of minority persons and EIP voting usage. Collectively, the\nfindings suggest that the potential effects of Ohio's proposed policy changes would not be equally distributed between racial\ngroups.\n",

Indeed, over the past two decades, casting bal-\nlots other than at the precinct place on the day of an election\nhas become commonplace in American politics (Gronke,\nAmong the variety of convenience voting options presently\nin use, there is a \"[r]apidly expanding list\" of U.S. jurisdic-\ntions that offer early in person (EIP) balloting opportunities\nthe precise rules and hours of availability for this voting\nmethod vary between and within states, the general idea is\nthat voters are permitted to cast ballots prior to an election, in\nperson, at satellite polling stations or county elections offices\n(Gronke, 2008). Such programs expand an eligible individu-\nal's set of voting options, which effectively reduces partici-\npation costs, and can therefore boost overall turnout (Gronke\nDespite this common perception that turnout is positively\nrelated to the diversity and quantity of voting opportunities\n1Texas State University, San Marcos, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nRussell Weaver, Department of Geography, Texas State University, 601\nEmail: rcweaver@txstate.edu\nThe Racial Context of Convenience\nVoting Cutbacks: Early Voting in\nPresidential Elections\nRussell Weaver1\n Keywords\nearly voting, elections, electoral geography, race, U.S. politics, voting behavior\n2 SAGE Open\nrecently passed or proposed laws designed to scale back their\nstatewide EIP voting operations (Brennan Center for Justice,\nchanges include increasing efficiencies in or reducing the\ncosts of elections (e.g., Enns, n.d.; Viewpoint Florida, 2011).\nHowever, many observers question whether the motivations\nfor these policies are purely administrative (Hasen, 2013).\nFor instance, some civil rights advocates claim that cutting\nback on EIP voting programs disproportionately affects\nminority voters, insofar as minorities seem to exercise the\noption at greater rates than White voters (NAACP, 2011).\nOther participants in the discourse take this line of reasoning\nfurther into the realm of politics, by suggesting that minority\nvoters tendentially affiliate with the Democratic Party; hence,\nany policy changes that disproportionately affect minority\nvoters will also disproportionately affect one of the major\nU.S. political parties relative to its rival(s) (Greenblatt, 2011).\nCasting the partisan dimension of the above argument\naside, the preceding observations do speak to a need to\naddress the question of who votes EIP. Regardless of legisla-\ntive intent, if minorities in fact utilize EIP voting in greater\nproportions than White voters, then changes to such institu-\ntions can have inequitable effects. Previous studies have con-\ncluded that the universe of convenience voters in general is\ndominated by relatively wealthy, politically informed, and\neducated individuals, and that White voters frequently pos-\nsess these characteristics at higher rates than racial and eth-\nnic minorities (Alvarez et\nNevertheless, a growing body of research is finding that, for\nEIP balloting more narrowly, the opposite situation might\n& Salling, 2012). Federal courts even acknowledged recently\nthat minority and low-income voters often exhibit higher\npropensities to vote EIP compared with other socioeconomic\nand demographic groups (Hasen, 2013; Obama for America\n[OFA] v. Husted, 2012 [see Preliminary Pretrial Order]).\nThus, there is no clear-cut answer to the aforementioned\n\"who\" question, and this ambiguity creates a demand for\nnew empirical research on the topic (e.g., Gronke et\nal.,\nThe current article begins to fill this gap by empirically\nestimating EIP voting behavior, by race, during the 2008 and\n2012 presidential elections for the three largest counties in\nthe state of Ohio: Cuyahoga, Franklin, and Hamilton. The\narticle relies on King's (1997) method of ecological infer-\nence to produce its estimates, which are supported with\ndecile tables and geovisualizations. By focusing on the larg-\nest counties in Ohio, the article intends to, first, study the\nearly voting behavior of a relatively large share of voters in\nthe state and, second, offer immediate contributions to Ohio's\nearly voting policy discourses. Explicitly, newly passed leg-\nislative measures in Ohio aimed at reducing EIP voting\nopportunities were temporarily blocked by a federal court\nprior to the 2012 presidential election, and a post-election\nlegal battle will now determine the (immediate) fate of the\nOhio early voting policy going forward (NAACP v. Husted,\nThis article seeks to add timely evidence to these current\nlegal and political proceedings.\nCritically, the findings produced herein broadly support\nthe growing narrative that minority voters, particularly\nAfrican Americans, cast EIP ballots at higher rates than\nWhite voters. This finding implies that more African\nAmericans than Whites in Ohio's largest counties would\nhave to adjust their voting behavior under the proposed EIP\nvoting rule changes. It is plausible that similar voting pat-\nterns are present elsewhere within Ohio, as well as in juris-\ndictions across the United States. Thus, assertions that\nminority voters will be disparately affected by reductions in\nEIP voting opportunities (e.g., NAACP, 2011) are seemingly\nwell founded. These observations have important implica-\ntions for public policy.\nBackground\nA detailed overview of convenience voting is beyond the\nscope of this article, and such information can be found in\nthe work of Gronke (2008) and his collaborators (Gronke\nidentify the racial characteristics of one specific class of con-\nvenience voters: those who cast ballots in person prior to\nElection Day. The decision to focus on race as opposed to\nother characteristics that influence political behavior, such as\nage, gender, education, or income, is based on the present\nstate of legal affairs in the American voting rights commu-\nnity. Briefly, several U.S. states that recently faced or are fac-\ning opposition to their efforts to change EIP voting rules\nhave been challenged under the federal Voting Rights Act\n(e.g., State of Florida v. U.S., 2012). For many challenged\njurisdictions, this places a burden of proof on the state to\ndemonstrate that proposed early voting reforms will not have\nretrogressive effects on minority voting efficacy once they\nare implemented (e.g., Hasen, 2013). More explicitly, the\nnew rules cannot decrease the strength of minority voters,\nwhich includes increasing their costs of voting, relative to\ning the merit of cutting back on EIP voting opportunities,\nthen, it is of crucial importance to determine whether or not\nminorities and Whites utilize the method at differential rates,\nand, by extension, whether different racial groups will be\ndisparately affected.\nEmpirical evidence related to this question is somewhat\nmixed, though this situation might be an artifact of timing.\nFor instance, prior to the 2008 U.S. presidential election,\nAmerican political scientists supported the idea that conve-\nnience voters as a whole were politically active, well edu-\ncated, and members of higher income classes--attributes\noften associated disproportionately with White voters. In\nfact, Berinsky (2005) described this perspective on conve-\nnience voting as the \"single conclusion\" among political\nscience scholars. Yet, whereas such a conclusion might have\nbeen appropriate at the time of that writing, more recent stud-\nies intimate that the unparalleled efforts of the 2008 Barack\nObama presidential campaign to get-out-the-vote early\namong minority voters possibly brought about a change\npoint in group convenience voting behavior (e.g., Alvarez\n2011). Namely, there is growing evidence of an inchoate\nshift in the electorate, whereby minority voters in many\njurisdictions now appear to have a greater propensity than\nWhite voters to cast EIP ballots (Alvarez etal., 2009;Alvarez\nConsider, for example, that judges in a recent federal elec-\ntion law case denied the state of Florida preclearance to\ndecrease its existing early voting time period because known\n(administrative) data showed that minority voters exercised\nthe EIP option at significantly higher rates than White voters\nin four out of the prior five federal elections, including at a\nsubstantially higher rate in the 2008 presidential election\n(Hasen, 2013). This observation led the judges to opine that\nsuch a pattern is likely to continue into the future (State of\nFlorida v. U.S., 2012 [see Per Curium Opinion]). Unlike the\nFlorida example, though, most states, including Ohio, do not\ncollect racial information on individual voters (e.g., King,\nof U.S. states cannot appeal to known administrative data to\ndescribe EIP voting patterns by race in their jurisdictions, for\nthe simple reason that such data do not exist. In that sense,\nthe earlier \"who votes EIP\" question can be an extremely\ndifficult one to answer.\nTo address this challenge, comparable studies for Ohio\nhave adopted a proportionality rule, or \"neighborhood\nmodel,\" to allocate EIP voters to racial groups using popula-\ntion data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Under this rule, EIP\nvoters are aggregated to census geographies, and the percent-\nage of the census population in a given geographic unit that\nis, say, African American, is assumed to equal the African\nAmerican share of EIP voters in that area (Robbins & Salling,\n2012). For example, if the racial composition of census tract\nXYZ is 40% African American, and if 100 EIP ballots were\ncast in tract XYZ, then according to the proportionality\nassumption, tract XYZ is home to 40 African American EIP\nvoters. Although findings from neighborhood model studies\nfor Ohio (Robbins & Salling, 2012) fit with the recent litera-\nture suggesting that minorities vote EIP at higher rates than\nallocation method is not a reliable technique for inferring\ngroup voting behavior (Garza v. County of Los Angeles,\ncurrent article relies instead on King's (1997) method of eco-\nlogical inference (King's EI) to derive estimates for EIP take-\nup rates by race. King's EI has been viewed favorably by\nfederal judges in voting rights cases (Greiner, 2007), and it is\nused widely in similarly motivated social science research\nVoss & Miller, 2001). Nonetheless, the method is not without\nGreiner, 2007), and, consequently, the estimates that it pro-\nduces are supported by, and discussed within the context of,\nsupplementary decile analyses and geovisualizations (refer\nto the \"Data and Method\" section below).\nStudy Area and Regional Context\nIn 2005, all registered voters in Ohio were granted eligibility\nto vote in person during the full 35-day period prior to\nElection Day, including weekends (OFA v. Husted, 2012 [see\nOpinion and Order Granting Preliminary Injunction]).\nFollowing a series of proposals to change that program, the\nEIP voting for all voters on weekends, and to terminate the\nEIP balloting period for non-military voters on the Friday\nbefore an election. Under the original regulations, this latter\ntermination date fell 3 days later, on the Monday immedi-\nately prior to Election Day (OFA v. Husted, 2012 [see Opinion\nand Order Granting Preliminary Injunction]). Shortly after\ntheir passage, these proposed rule changes were legally chal-\nlenged by the 2012 presidential campaign of Barack Obama\n(OFA), which sought to maintain the full 35-day EIP voting\nperiod that was implemented in 2005. OFA argued that EIP\nvoters disproportionately tend to be members of minority\ngroups--especially African Americans--and the working\nclass, and thus, shortening the EIP voting period would\nunduly harm these historically disadvantaged populations\nGranting Preliminary Injunction]). To support this assertion,\nOFA pointed to election studies that utilized the proportional\nrule (i.e., neighborhood model) with U.S. census data to esti-\nmate the minority share of Ohio's EIPvoter universe. Perhaps\nthe most influential of these studies found that more than half\nof 2008 EIP voters hailing from Ohio's largest county,\nCuyahoga County, were African Americans (Robbins &\nUltimately, these arguments and empirical findings fac-\ntored into a federal judge's decision to grant OFA a prelimi-\nnary injunction, thereby temporarily upholding the existing\nHusted, 2012 [see Opinion and Order Granting Preliminary\nInjunction]). Currently, the court is preparing to hear addi-\ntional arguments from civil rights groups and the state of\nOhio, as there remains uncertainty over the fate of Ohio's\nearly voting period (OFA v. Husted, 2012 [see Preliminary\nPretrial Order]; NAACP v. Husted, 2014). Accordingly, the\nissue is not necessarily settled either legally or as a public\npolicy matter. For that reason, studies that aim to systemati-\ncally estimate the differences between racial group EIP vot-\ning take-up rates--both for other study areas in Ohio and for\n4 SAGE Open\nmore elections--are potentially valuable new contributions\nto the discourse. It is toward these ends that the subsequent\nanalyses are directed.\nData and Method\nFollowing the examples set forth by research that entered\ninto the Ohio early voting legal proceedings prior to the 2012\ngeneral election (OFA v. Husted, 2012; Robbins & Salling,\n2012), this article examines EIP voting behavior for Ohio's\nthree largest counties--Cuyahoga, Franklin, and Hamilton\n(Figure 1). Although it would perhaps be preferable to con-\nduct the analysis for all counties in the state, necessary voter\ndata (as discussed below) are maintained by individual\ncounty-level Boards of Elections (BOE). As a consequence,\ndata must be acquired by public information requests on a\ncounty-by-county basis. It follows that all data management\nand processing operations must similarly occur on a county-\nby-county basis. To perform such activities for all 88 Ohio\ncounties would be quite demanding. In an effort to econo-\nmize, this article focuses only on the three counties named\nabove. By design, the selected counties contain the three\nmost populated cities in Ohio, as well as a large number of\nsuburban and low-density communities. What is more, the\nselected counties are geographically dispersed throughout\nthe state (Figure 1), and they contain nearly 30% of Ohio's\nvoting-age population (VAP) and registered voters (Ohio\nSecretary of State). Arguably, three counties with significant\nurban settlements cannot possibly represent a full cross-sec-\ntion of an 88-county state. However, if any potentially dis-\nproportionate impacts from the desired election law changes\nare observed in these large population regions, then one can\nconclude (with some confidence) that a sufficiently sizable\nbloc of Ohio voters--again, the three counties are home to\nFigure 1. Study areas: Cuyahoga, Franklin, and Hamilton Counties, Ohio, USA.\nroughly 30% of all registrants in the state--might be nega-\ntively affected by the rule changes. Such a result would argue\nagainst rushing into the proposed policy changes, and instead\nsuggest that additional analyses ought to be undertaken.\nHaving specified the study areas, the U.S. census tract is\nselected as the geographic unit of analysis for its advantages\nwith respect to data availability and completeness. In con-\ntrast to smaller census block groups or census blocks, only a\nnegligible number of census tracts in the study areas are\nunpopulated and/or not matched to voters who participated\nin the selected elections (Table 1). Such \"zero\" units are gen-\nerally dropped from the analysis when constructing the\nbounds needed to estimate early voting rates by race using\nThe upshot is that very few census tracts must be dropped\nfrom the analysis to facilitate the desired estimation proce-\ndure, which is not true of smaller spatial units. That being\nsaid, for each census tract in each county, data were collected\non four quantities of interest: (a) the number of voters who\n(b) the number of individuals who cast any type of ballot in\nthese elections, that is, the number of voters who partici-\npated; (c) the size of the VAP; and (d) the racial characteris-\ntics of the VAP.\nData on individual voters who participated in the selected\nelections (Quantity 2) and lists of voters who cast EIP ballots\nduring those elections (Quantity 1) were obtained through\npublic information requests made to the relevant county\nBOEs. All voter records were then batch geocoded in Esri\nArcGIS 10.1. The resultant data points were aggregated to\ncensus tracts, where they were merged with 2010 U.S. decen-\nnial census tract-level VAP data (Quantities 3 and 4). The\n2010 decennial census figures are used for at least two rea-\nsons. First, federal district court judges in OFA v. Husted\n(2012, see Opinion and Order Granting Preliminary\nInjunction) recently relied on a study of the 2008 general\nelection to form their judicial opinion, and that study instruc-\nSecond, reliable full count tract-level data for the years 2008\na convenient compromise. Table 1 summarizes the key infor-\nmation from each county-specific data set.\nAlongside the summary data, Table 1 also reports a hand-\nful of negligible discrepancies between the voter data fur-\nnished by the County BOEs, the official turnout results\navailable on the Ohio Secretary of State Elections website,\nand the fraction of voters that were successfully georefer-\nenced (and hence, included in the analysis). Because the\nTable 1.

Moreover, insofar as the\ndata were received directly from the BOEs through public\ninformation requests, they are taken to be reliable. Finally,\nthe sufficiently high percentages of voter records from the\nBOE data files that were successfully matched during the\ngeocoding processes add to our confidence in the analytical\nsamples (Table 1, columns 5 and 9).\nAs stated earlier, because the vast majority of states do not\ncapture data related to an individual's race or ethnicity dur-\ning the voter registration and ballot casting processes, racial\ngroup disparities in voter participation or the type of ballot\ncast cannot be ascertained from most state registration\nRushton, 2008). Rather, to evaluate these questions, voter\nrecords must be merged with data from other sources--here,\nthe U.S. Census Bureau--that collect racial information on a\nsuperset (voting-age persons) of the target population (vot-\ners). When aggregated and overlaid, these multiple data lay-\ners begin to reveal details about the unobserved behavior of\ninterest. One technique for deducing early voting behavior\nby race with such data is to examine the take-up of EIP vot-\ning in relatively racially homogeneous geographies, and to\nhypothesize that the behavior observed therein is relatively\nrepresentative of voters from the given racial group (Brace,\nIn Table 2, decile analyses reveal that voters in relatively\nhomogeneous African American census tracts (90% of\nVAP) in Cuyahoga, Franklin, and Hamilton Counties utilized\nEIP voting at substantially higher rates than voters in largely\nnon\u00adAfrican American (<10% of VAP) tracts during the\nexpect that more sophisticated statistical estimation tech-\nniques will find that African American voters use EIP voting\nat much higher rates than, for instance, White voters, in the\nstudy areas.\nConclusions drawn about individuals based on aggregate\ndata in this fashion, so-called \"ecological inferences,\" are\nNevertheless, the homogeneous geographies approach to\nmaking such inferences is not the only option. Indeed, a large\nbody of statistical literature explores ways to overcome the\n\"solution\" to the problem (King's EI) to estimate EIP usage\nby race. King's EI is widely used in studies of group voting\nit has gained \"favorability\" among federal judges in voting-\nconsidered to be an \"established method\" for this type of\nFor present purposes, King's EI involves first estimating\nvoter turnout by race for each county of interest, by drawing\non known census tract-level data for the (a) size of tract VAP,\n(b) percentage of VAP that voted in the selected elections,\nand (c) racial breakdown of tract VAP. Following existing\nOhio early voting studies (Robbins & Salling, 2012), we\nfocus here on two racial groups: non-Hispanic Whites\n(White), and non-Hispanic African Americans (Black). For\neach of these racial groups, turnout estimates for all tracts in\neach of the three counties are first constrained by determinis-\ntic (feasible) bounds based on the observed U.S. Census data\n(King, 1997). Next, all feasible turnout values for each cen-\nsus tract are analyzed in the context of maximum likelihood\nto derive point estimates and standard errors for tract-level\nracial group turnout (Roch & Rushton, 2008). The point esti-\nmates for turnout are then used to generate \"step two\" esti-\nmates of EIP take-up rates by race for each county, via\nestimating second-step King's EI equations in much the\nsame way as above (King, 1997; see also Roch & Rushton,\n2008). These quantities allow one to draw conclusions about\nwhether minorities--in this case, African Americans--uti-\nlized EIP voting disproportionately relative to Whites in the\nelections. Answering this question is of central importance\nfor managing conflicts in Ohio and throughout the United\nStates over proposed cutbacks to EIP voting opportunities\nOpinion and Order Granting Preliminary Injunction];\nPer Curium Opinion]).\nFinally, because King's (1997) method is not without crit-\nare supported with geovisualization techniques that make\nuse of choropleth mapping and three-dimensional extrusion\nto simultaneously map two geographic distributions across\nthe three county study areas. The distributions of interest are\n(a) African Americans as a fraction of VAP and (b) EIP votes\nas a fraction of all ballots cast. The resultant three-dimen-\nsional maps further support the notion that EIP voting is not\nequally practiced by members of different racial groups.\nResults\nThe global results from estimating the basic King's EI\ncounty-level models for White and African American voters\nare presented in Table 3. For each county, a Step 1 EI model\nfirst estimates racial group turnout as a fraction of racial\ngroup VAP. A Step 2 model then estimates racial group usage\nof the EIP ballot option as a fraction of group turnout from\nEach global estimate is listed in Table 3 with its correspond-\ning standard error and the approximate number of individu-\nals included in the given category. The latter quantity is\ncalculated by distributing the King's EI (%) estimate through\nthe relevant population count. Falling in line with contempo-\nrary academic literature (e.g., Gronke et\nreports by civil rights groups that study the effects of the\nBarack Obama candidacy on minority electoral participation\n(e.g., NAACP, 2011), the Step 1 EI estimates reveal that the\nturnout gap between African Americans and Whites is clos-\ning. In fact, for Cuyahoga County, the estimated African\nAmerican turnout exceeded the estimated White turnout in\nHence, the Step 1 EI estimates comport with the idea that the\nObama candidacy potentially reshaped the electorate to\ninclude more traditionally underrepresented voters relative\nto all previous presidential elections (Gronke etal., 2009).\nMore central to this article, Step 2 estimates for the\ngroup rates of EIP voting are extremely racially unbal-\nanced. In 2008, African Americans in Cuyahoga County\nwere approximately 26 times more likely than Whites to\nvote EIP, and approximately 20 times more likely than\nWhites to exercise the option in 2012. To put this difference\nTable 2.

VAP = voting-age population; EIP = early in person.\naValues reflect sample statistics (refer to Table 1 for a description of the samples); All VAP data come from the 2010 U.S. decennial census.\n8 SAGE Open\naccounted for an estimated 29% of the overall electorate;\nyet, the racial group represented a staggering 77% of the\nEIP voter universe. This substantial disproportionality\nimplies a crucial difference in inter-group voting prefer-\nences, and it suggests that minority voters are likely to be\nnegatively affected if opportunities to vote EIP are elimi-\nnated. Similar results hold for Franklin and Hamilton\nCounties. In Franklin County, African American voters uti-\nlized EIP voting at roughly a four-to-one rate relative to\nsame ratio was approximately nine-to-one for Hamilton\nCounty. As is estimated to be the case in Cuyahoga County,\nthe early voter universes in both Franklin and Hamilton\nCounties were significantly, disproportionately African\nAmerican when compared with the White and Black shares\nof the jurisdictions' overall voter turnout (Table 3).\nNotably, the EI estimation results are highly consistent\nwith the homogeneous geographies (decile) analyses from\nthe \"Data and Method\" section (Table 2). This consistency\nlends credibility to the EI output from Table 3. Still, to add\nmore depth to the results, Figures 2 to 4 map the geo-\ngraphic distributions of African American voting-age per-\nsons in each county, by census tract, relative to the county's\ntract-level EIP take-up rates. For each figure, census tracts\nthat are symbolized with blue hues represent areas where\nAfrican Americans make up relatively small shares (40%)\nof total tract VAP. Tracts that are symbolized with red hues\nare those territories where African Americans hold rela-\ntively strong majorities (>60%) in the local VAP. The verti-\ncal height of each tract corresponds to its average EIP\ndential elections. That is, the height (extrusion) is\ncalculated by adding a given tract's 2008 EIP take-up rate\nto its 2012 EIP take-up rate, and dividing by two. Height,\ntherefore, falls in the range of zero to one. Note that the\naverage EIP take-up rates are mapped in the figures for\neconomy, rather than creating separate figures for each\nelection. Mapping the averages not only cuts the number\nof necessary figures in half, but also, it eliminates some-\nwhat redundant information, as the patterns for 2008 and\n2012 do not show much temporal change (or spatial varia-\ntion from the average patterns).\nIn all three figures it is evident that, in the main, tracts\nwhere African Americans make up a majority of the VAP are\nalso those tracts where EIP usage is greatest in magnitude.\nThis pattern is particularly striking in Cuyahoga County\n(Figure 2), where the \"red\" tracts tower over all but one\n\"blue\" tract. Falling in line with the decile analyses (Table 2)\nand the EI results (Table 3), Figures 2 to 4 support the\nhypothesis that the negative effects from scaling back EIP\ninstitutions in Ohio will not be equitably distributed between\nall racial groups in the state (e.g., Hasen, 2013; OFA v.\nHusted, 2012 [see Opinion and Order Granting Preliminary\nDiscussion\nThe results presented in the preceding two sections offer\nconsistent quantitative support for the notion that minori-\nties in Ohio, especially African Americans, tend to vote\nEIP at much higher rates than White voters. In consider-\nation of prior empirical work (Alvarez etal., 2012; Kropf,\n2012), as well as anecdotal evidence from electoral poli-\ntics (Gustafson, 2008), this finding is not altogether unex-\npected. What makes the results somewhat surprising,\nTable 3.

Earlier estimates derived under the\nproportional rule or \"neighborhood model\"--that is, by\nassuming that the fraction of VAP within a given observa-\ntional that is African American is strictly equal to the frac-\ntion of EIP votes cast by African Americans in the same\narea--suggested that about half of Cuyahoga County's\n2008 EIP voters were African Americans (Robbins &\nSalling, 2012). In contrast, estimates derived using King's\nEI method, which are supported by supplementary decile\nanalysis (Table 2), suggest that African Americans consis-\ntently accounted for more than three quarters of the\nCuyahoga County EIP voter universe during both the 2008\n72% of all EIP voters in Franklin and Hamilton Counties.\nOne potential reason for the large discrepancy between\nthe neighborhood and EI estimates for Cuyahoga County\nis that by limiting a racial group's share of the EIP uni-\nverse to equal that group's share of the overall VAP, the\nneighborhood approach likely misrepresents the behavior\nof minority voters in predominantly non\u00adAfrican\nAmerican geographies (e.g., compare the first and last\nrows in each decile table contained in Table 2); where\nKing's EI method allows for more possibilities.\nNevertheless, prior to the 2012 presidential election, fed-\neral judges relied exclusively on proportional (neighbor-\nhood) estimates when they decided to temporarily block\nOhio's proposed early voting changes (OFA v. Husted,\n2012 [see Opinion and Order Granting Preliminary\nInjunction]).\nIt is worth mentioning, then, that the findings from this\narticle imply that the extent of the adjudged \"injury\" to minor-\nity voters from Ohio's proposed rule changes might be even\ngreater than what the court acknowledged at the time of its\ndecision. In that sense, one can speculate that if federal judges\ntemporarily blocked the proposed early voting cutbacks in the\nstate based on proportional estimates of EIP voting by race in\none large county, then, given the King's EI estimates derived\nhereinbefore for Ohio's three largest counties, the current\nround of legal proceedings is likely to disfavor policies that\nwill decrease early voting opportunities in the state.\nFigure 2.

EIP = early in person; VAP = voting-age population.\nConclusion\nIt is almost tautological to claim that a policy that reduces\nEIP voting opportunities in a given jurisdiction will nega-\ntively affect voters who prefer to use the EIP option. Thus,\nthe question at issue in the legal discourse is not whether\ncutting back on early voting operations will affect existing\nearly voters--it is whether or not such changes will affect\nthose voters equitably. Along these lines, the results from\nabove reaffirm prior claims that minority voters, particularly\nAfrican Americans, account for a disproportionately large\nshare of the EIP voter universe in Ohio (Robbins & Salling,\n2012). Although this is not to say that minority voters in\nOhio's largest counties will necessarily be excluded from\nvoting because of the proposed state law changes, a practical\ninterpretation of the results is that eliminating opportunities\nto vote EIP effectively raises the cost of voting for more\nAfrican Americans than for Whites. This is the case because\nthe former group contains substantially more EIP voters,\nboth in relative and absolute terms, than the latter (Table 3).\nHence, more minority voters than White voters in Ohio will\nface new adjustment costs under the proposed rule changes.\nThat being said, political science literature collectively\nagrees that voting costs and political participation are\ncaused by a shortened early voting period, should that out-\ncome occur, will most likely be driven by decreases in minor-\nity participation. Put differently, regardless of the intent of\nthe early voting law changes, based on the racial disparities\nobserved in early voting behavior, the new rules could have\nan inequitable effect in Ohio's largest counties.\nIn this context, although the present study focused only on\nthe two most recent presidential elections in three Ohio\ncounties, more and more evidence is accumulating to suggest\nthat African American voters across the United States prefer\nto exercise EIP voting options at greater rates than Whites\nexample, in the state of Florida, where racial data are col-\nlected on individual voters, a federal three-court judge in\n2012 denied the state preclearance for proposed reductions in\nthe number of days it offers EIP balloting, given that racial\nminorities were found to vote EIP at substantially higher\nrates than Whites (State of Florida v. U.S., 2012 [see Per\nCurium Opinion]). Similar to Florida, Georgia collects racial\ndata on individual voter registrants, and studies of early vot-\ning behavior in that state find a \"higher incidence of [EIP]\nturnout\" among African Americans, especially for the 2008\npresidential election (Hood & Bullock, 2011).\nConsidered in tandem with this complementary evidence\nbased on known racial group voting behavior, the foregoing\nresults imply that policies that set out to eliminate conve-\nnience voting opportunities should not be pursued in\nisolation of empirical insights into the racial characteristics\nof affected voters. Additional research on the topic, espe-\ncially in the form of program evaluations that identify causal\nrelationships between new early voting policies and voter\nturnout, is needed to explore actual behavioral adjustments,\nby race, to the types of cutbacks discussed throughout this\narticle. At present, however, based on the current state of the\nliterature, it is prudent to recognize that further legislative\naction toward the early voting reductions in Ohio and else-\nwhere in the United States demands greater attention to the\nracial context of the proposed rule changes.\n"
