Kozlowski7\n Introduction\nCotinine is the primary proximate metabolite of nico-\ntine. On an average, 72% of nicotine is converted to\ncotinine, ranging from 55% to 92% (1). The half-life\ncotinine is 16 to 19 hours and its ready availability in\nsaliva, blood, and urine makes it widely practical as a\nbiomarker of nicotine uptake and exposure to both active\nand secondhand tobacco smoke. For smokers with a fairly\nconsistent smoking pattern (about 80% of adult smokers\nreport smoking each day; ref. 2), serum cotinine levels\nreach a steady state, varying only by 15% to 20% over the\ncourse of the day with lower levels usually in the morning\nas there is typically minimal exposure to cigarette smoke\novernight (1). Racial and ethnic differences in the number\nof cigarettes smoked per day (cpd; refs. 3\u00ad5) and in serum\ncotinine concentration per cigarette smoked have been\nwell established (6\u00ad11). In U.S. studies, non-Hispanic\nblack smokers (hereafter referred to as black) have con-\nsistently been found to have higher serum cotinine con-\ncentrations per cigarette smoked than non-Hispanic\nwhite smokers (hereafter referred to as white; refs.\n7,10). The reasons for these differences are not well\nunderstood but may include a combination of factors,\nAuthors' Affiliations: 1Office on Smoking and Health, National Center for\nChronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, 2Division of Laboratory\nScience, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention; 3RTI International, Atlanta Regional Office; 4Bios-\ntatistics, Inc.; 5Institute of Public Health, Georgia State University, Atlanta,\nGeorgia; 6Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health,\nColumbia University; 7School of Public Health and Health Professions,\nUniversity at Buffalo, State University of New York, New York; and 8Penn\nState Cancer Institute, Division of Population Sciences, Penn State Col-\nlege of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania\nCorresponding Author: Ralph S.

Most recent\nFederal Trade Commission (FTC) data show that menthol\nbrands represented about 26% to 27% of market share of\ncigarette brands sold in the United States during that\nperiod were Newport, Marlboro Menthol, Kool, and\nSalem; however, there are many other menthol cigarette\nbrands that are sold in the United States. The leading\nmenthol brands, similar to nonmenthol brands, have a\nvariety of subbrands. These menthol subbrands of the\nsame brand vary in FTC-measured nicotine levels. For\nexample, the leading menthol brand Newport has sub-\nbrands which range in FTC-measured1 nicotine levels\nfrom 0.8 mg (Newport Slim Light) to 1.4 mg (Newport);\nMarlboro Menthol has subbrands in which nicotine\nyields vary from 0.5 mg (Marlboro Menthol Ultra Light)\n(Kool Ultra) to 1.4 mg (Kool Super Longs); and Salem\nfrom 0.5 mg (Salem Ultra Lights) to 1.4 mg (Salem).\nSimilarly, these menthol brands and its subbrands also\nhave different concentrations of the additive menthol in\nit; however, menthol is also present at low levels in many\nnonmenthol brands. In a study conducted by Celebucki\nand colleagues (13), the authors found that subbrands of\nNewport ranged in menthol per cigarette and in menthol\nper gram of tobacco. In addition to the type of cigarettes\nsmoked (menthol or nonmenthol, amount of menthol,\namount of nicotine), cigarettes are smoked differently\n(e.g., puff volume, depth of inhalation, retention time\nof smoke in the lungs, potential blocking ventilation\nholes) and differences in nicotine metabolism or elimina-\ntion among individual smokers and between racial\ngroups exist.\nDocumenting and quantifying differences in serum\ncotinine concentration between smokers of menthol\nand nonmenthol brands (within and between race com-\nparisons) are best done under natural smoking conditions\nas opposed to conditions set in a laboratory. Serum\ncotinine variability has been extensively studied in rela-\ntion to race/ethnicity. Number of cigarettes smoked per\nday, and to a smaller degree, cigarette types like menthol\nhave also been studied. However, these 3 factors are\nhighly interrelated, and their independent effects on\ncotinine levels have not been well studied.\nWe report here an assessment of serum cotinine levels\nusing models based on nationally representative data that\nsimultaneously include number of cigarettes smoked per\nday, race, and smoking a menthol or nonmenthol cigar-\nette brand.\nCotinine is a biomarker of current exposure to nicotine.\nBecause the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is\nexamining options for regulating menthol cigarettes, it\nis important to determine whether smoking a menthol\nbrand is associated with higher nicotine uptake under\nnatural smoking conditions. Such information may help\nto understand reasons for the disparities between the risk\nof smoking-related diseases and aspects of nicotine\ndependence such as quit rate between black smokers\nand white smokers in the United States.\nMethods\nWe measured serum cotinine concentrations among a\nnationally representative sample of white and black\nsmokers according to the type of cigarettes they smoked\nin the past 2 days. Specifically, we determined serum\ncotinine concentrations as a function of self-reported\ncigarettes per day among the 2 racial groups by type\nof cigarette. Cigarette type was determined by the brand\nthey smoked at the time of the home interview and\ncategorized as menthol or nonmenthol, as well as by\npack descriptors and data reported annually to the Fed-\neral Trade Commission (FTC) for mainstream smoke\nnicotine yield. The serum cotinine concentration was first\npreadjusted for the day the last cigarette was smoked\n(today or yesterday), the number of smokers who smoked\ninside the home in the past 7 days, whether the subject\nphysically showed the cigarette pack to the interviewer in\nthe home interview, age, and body weight, as subse-\nquently described.\nDescription of NHANES\nThe National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey (NHANES) consists of a number of question-\nnaires administered in the household followed by\nstandardized physical examinations and additional\ntobacco use questions administered in specially\nequipped mobile examination centers (MEC), which\non an average occur about 2 weeks after the household\ninterview. The NHANES target population is the civi-\nlian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population. This nation-\nally representative sample permits calculation of\nnational estimates. Related to our study, NHANES\noversamples low-income persons, persons 60\u00fe years\nof age, and non-Hispanic blacks. We used NHANES\ndata collected between January 2001 and December\npermitted statements concerning tar and nicotine yields if they were based\non the Cambridge Filter Method, sometimes called the FTC method. At the\ntime, the Commission believed that giving consumers uniform, standar-\ndized information about tar and nicotine yields of cigarettes would help\nthem make informed decisions about the cigarettes they smoked. In 2008,\nhowever, the scientific consensus was that machine-based measure-\nments of tar and nicotine yields based on the Cambridge Filter Method\ndid not provide meaningful information on the amounts of tar and nicotine\nsmokers received from cigarettes, thus the FTC method was flawed. The\nFTC method is no longer valid to provide information to consumers about\ntar and nicotine yields in cigarettes.\nCaraballo et al.\nCancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 20(7) July 2011 Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention\nResearch.\ncebp.aacrjournals.org\nDownloaded from\nThe MEC tobacco questionnaire, administered via\ncomputer-assisted personal interview (CAPI), asked par-\nticipants, \"During the past 5 days, on the days {you/he/\nshe} smoked, how many cigarettes did {you/he/she}\nsmoke each day?\" This number was our independent\nvariable. Cigarettes smoked per day was not a calculated\nvariable. It is a directly reported respondent impression\nof the \"average\" number of cigarettes smoked, on the days\nthey smoked cigarettes. NHANES did not ask for the\nnumbers of cigarettes smoked on each of the last 5 days\nbut did ask when they smoked their last cigarette (today,\nyesterday). Finally, another MEC questionnaire item\nasked about when the respondent smoked last: \"When\ndid {you/he/she} smoke {your/his/her} last cigarette?\"\nPossible responses were \"today,\" \"yesterday,\" or \"3 to\n5 days ago.\" Those who answered \"3 to 5 days ago\" were\nexcluded from the analyses.\nThe analytic sample for this study included smokers\naged 20 years and older who had smoked on the day of or\non the day preceding the MEC visit, who were recoded by\nNHANES as non-Hispanic white or non-Hispanic black/\nAfrican American, who had a serum cotinine measure-\nment and provided tobacco use information in the MEC.\nWe excluded smokers who had used any other tobacco\nproduct (pipes, cigars, chewing tobacco, or snuff) or\nnicotine patches, gum, or other nicotine products during\nthe 5 days preceding the MEC visit.\nolder who completed the NHANES home interview,\nMEC tobacco questionnaire. Of these, 2,188 had smoked\ncigarettes during the past 5 days and had a serum\ncotinine measurement. Of these, 2,095 had smoked on\nthe day of or the day preceding the MEC exam; 2,034\nreported using no sources of nicotine other than cigar-\nettes. Among these, 91 were excluded due to missing\ncigarette brand information. The final analytic sample\nMenthol cigarette brand\nDuring the CAPI household interview, respondents\nwere asked whether they now smoke cigarettes every\nday, some days, or not at all. Respondents who indicated\nthey smoke every day or some days were asked to show\ntheir cigarette pack for the cigarette brand they usually\nsmoke. Interviewers then entered the 8- or 12-digit Uni-\nversal Product Code (UPC) into the computer, which then\ndisplayed the brand name from a stored list for verifica-\ntion by the respondent. If the respondent's brand was not\ndisplayed or the respondent did not show the pack, the\nbrand (reported by the respondent) was selected from a\nlist of brands/types. If the respondent's usual brand was\nnot on the computer list, the interviewer asked the\nrespondent about the usual brand's characteristics to help\nclassify the brand according to filter, menthol, length, and\nstudy participants showed their cigarette pack and about\nbrand's characteristics. Using this method, we deter-\nmined whether the cigarette brand currently smoked\nby the respondent was menthol or nonmenthol.\nIndividual level measures\nDemographics and exposure to secondhand smoke\nwere measured by using CAPI. Most interviews were\nconducted in the home. Race and ethnicity were based on\nself-report. Age at interview was categorized as 20 to 24,\nweight in kilograms, measured by using a digital scale,\nand 80 kg or more. Reported exposure to secondhand\nsmoke at home was based on the following questions\nposed to 1 member of the household (usually the head of\nthe family or spouse of the head): \"Does anyone who live\nhere smoke cigarettes in the home?\" The number of\nhousehold members who smoked cigarettes in the home\nwas categorized as 0 or 1 (not exposed or exposed).\nSource for cigarette nicotine data\nIn addition to cigarette brand characteristics obtained\ndirectly from the cigarette pack or from the smoker's\nreport, we obtained machine-generated nicotine levels\nfrom annual reports to the FTC (12). These were cate-\ngorically coded in NHANES at the time of the UPC\nmatch, if any. FTC machine\u00addetermined levels were\nlinked to each respondent's brand by first matching\nthe brand name and characteristics provided by the\nparticipant to the brand characteristics (brand name,\npackage type, and menthol) in the FTC listing of main-\nstream smoke yields by brand and variety (12).\nRespondent's brand was matched to the FTC data for\nthe year of the NHANES interview or the most recent\nyear available prior to the year of the NHANES inter-\nview (14). These were also augmented by the merging of\ndata from the FTC (15). The augmented data contained\nsecondary sources for brand nicotine in addition to\nbrand name, length, filter, package type, strength,\nand menthol. A combined outcome was created by\nselecting the UPC outcome for each cigarette attribute,\nif a match with the UPC database occurred and there\nwas useable data, otherwise the original NHANES\ndetermination was used. We conducted analyses using\nFTC nicotine levels as a continuous variable. For illus-\ntration purposes, we used 0.8 and 1.1 mg of FTC\nmachine\u00admeasured nicotine levels.\nSerum cotinine measurement\nBiochemical determination of tobacco exposure was\nperformed by measuring serum cotinine levels in blood\nspecimens obtained by venipuncture in the MEC. The\ncotinine assay involved isotope dilution, liquid chroma-\ntography, and tandem mass spectrometry. Cotinine data\nare reported in nanograms per milliliter. The limit of\ndetection (LOD) for this procedure was 0.015 ng/mL\n(16). No smoker in the study had serum cotinine con-\ncentrations below LOD.\nSerum Cotinine Levels among Smokers of Menthol Cigarettes\nResearch.\ncebp.aacrjournals.org\nDownloaded from\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was carried out in 2 stages.\nStage 1: Preadjustment and removal of nuisance variation.\nFirst, serum cotinine levels were adjusted for sources of\nnuisance variation within each of the 4 race/ethnicity\ntimes sex categories. Nuisance variables were as follows:\ntime since last smoked (today), whether the respondent\nshowed his/her cigarette pack (yes), and number of\nsmokers in the home (only the respondent). We did not\nadjust for cigarettes smoked per day in stage 1, as this was\nthe focus of the stage 2 analysis. Nonlinear and quadratic\nfunctions of age, sex, and body weight were also used to\nimprove the adjustment for those not in the appropriate\nreference category. Predicted serum cotinine levels for\nrespondent covariate combinations not in the reference\ncategories were calculated by setting the covariates to\nthese reference levels before calculating the predicted\nvalues. The ratio of predicted cotinine values for reference\ncovariate levels to predicted cotinine values for observed\ncovariate levels was calculated. Adjusted cotinine values\nwere calculated by multiplying the observed cotinine\nvalues by this ratio. We also preadjusted for time since\nlast cigarette. We preadjusted for the decay by using\nregression to predict within each race and sex what the\ncotinine would have been had they been measured on the\nday they smoked their last cigarette (i.e., today). Those\nresults, for all adjustment factors, were generally consis-\ntent in the direction of the change in the coefficient signs\nacross all 4 races by sex strata, which lends some addi-\ntional internal validity to the approach. The amount of\nadjustment was data driven through the coefficient mag-\nnitude within each race and sex. The procedure simulta-\nneously accounted for other factors such as age and body\nweight. The resulting models were adequately fit and\nhighly consistent. People who smoked their last cigarette\n3 to 5 days ago were excluded from the analyses because\nof considerably more variability in serum cotinine con-\ncentration than those who smoked the day blood was\ncollected or the day before.\nStage 2: Exponential models for cigarettes per day by menthol\nbrand status. In the second stage, nuisance-adjusted coti-\nnine values were regressed on cigarettes per day and\ncigarette menthol status, controlling for FTC-measured\nnicotine levels, respondent body weight, and gender.\nSurvey weights were used to adjust for differing prob-\nabilities of selection, nonresponse, and to adjust the\nsample to reflect the demographic distribution of the\nU.S. population. SAS was used for all analyses. We\nassessed the adequacy of the fit of the exponential regres-\nsion models by using plots of the residuals versus the\npredicted values.\nDetermination of adjusted serum cotinine levels by the\nnumber of cigarettes smoked per day and menthol brand\nstatus involved fitting nonlinear exponential regression\nmodels of the form: ln(adjusted cotinine \u00fe 1.0) \u00bc b0\nX) \u00fe error, where ln(\u00c1) is the natural logarithm; X\nis the number of self-reported cigarettes smoked per day;\nare parameters that describe the exponential\nrelationship; and error is the residual error left unex-\nplained by the model. This exponential equation models\nserum cotinine as a monotonically increasing function of\nthe number of cigarettes smoked, with cotinine increas-\ning at a decreasing rate toward an upper asymptote. The\nvariable b0\nrepresents the upper bound (maximum\nachievable level) of ln(adjusted cotinine \u00fe 1.0) at the\nhighest levels of daily smoking, and b1\nwork\ntogether to control the span and steepness curvature of\nhow cotinine increases with daily consumption.\nThe base model, stratified by race (separate models\nwere run by race), included the 3 parameters described\nabove. After fitting the base model, 2 different covariate\nadjusted models were fit. Model 1 investigated the rela-\ntionship between serum cotinine and cigarettes smoked\nper day after adjustment for FTC nicotine levels, body\nweight, and gender. Model 2 added cigarette menthol\nstatus to the model 1 variables.\nIn a preliminary investigation, we analyzed the data\nwith and without the stage 1 adjustment and the models\nwere similar, except that the stage 1 adjustment resulted\nin serum cotinine intercepts closer to the origin, as would\nbe expected if all nuisance factors were accounted for\nwhen cigarettes per day is near 0.\nResults\nTable 1 shows the sociodemographic characteristics\nand the type of cigarettes smoked for white and black\nsmokers. c2 tests of the association between race and\nsociodemographic and cigarette characteristics showed\nthat the distributions were statistically different (P < 0.01)\nacross the 2 racial groups. While white smokers had a\nwomen), black smokers were predominantly men\n(61.9%). Also, age distribution differences were observed\namong smokers by race. Only 19.5% of white smokers\nwere living below the poverty level, whereas about 31.7%\nof black smokers were living below the poverty level.\nDifferences in body weight were also observed; a higher\nproportion of black smokers (50.3%) weighed 80 kg or\nmore compared with 43.4% of white smokers. A higher\nproportion of black smokers were exposed to secondhand\nsmoke in the home (78.9%) compared with white smokers\nAs expected, only a minority (19.4%) of the sample of\nwhite smokers smoked menthol cigarettes, whereas the\nmajority (73.9%) of black smokers smoked a menthol\nbrand. Accordingly, black smokers smoked cigarette\nbrands that were on an average higher in FTC-measured\nnicotine than white smokers, as the specific menthol\nbrands smoked by black smokers (e.g., Newport) had\nhigher FTC machine\u00addetermined deliveries of nicotine\nthan nonmenthol brands smoked by white smokers (e.g.,\nMarlboro Light). About 3 of 4 white and black smokers\nsmoked their last cigarette the same day their blood was\nCaraballo et al.\nCancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 20(7) July 2011 Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention\nResearch.\ncebp.aacrjournals.org\nDownloaded from\ndrawn. About 9 of 10 white and black smokers reported\nsmoking every day. Finally, black smokers smoked fewer\ncigarettes per day than white smokers.\nFigure 1 illustrates cumulative percentages of FTC-\nmeasured nicotine levels of the cigarettes smoked by\nwhite and black smokers. Menthol cigarettes smoked\nby black smokers (1.24 mg) were on an average higher\nin FTC nicotine levels to the menthol cigarettes (0.94 mg)\nsmoked by white smokers (P < 0.01). Nonmenthol cigar-\nettes smoked by black smokers (1.01 mg) were on an\naverage higher in FTC nicotine levels to the nonmenthol\nFinally, for white smokers, the menthol cigarettes (0.94\nmg) they smoked were on an average higher in FTC\nnicotine levels than the nonmenthol cigarettes (0.88\nUnadjusted analysis shows that at the lowest cigarette\nsmoking level (1\u00ad3 cpd), black smokers had geometric\nmean serum cotinine concentrations (94.4 ng/mL) almost\n3 times that of white smokers (32.7 ng/mL; Table 2). The\nmedian number of cigarettes smoked in whites was 18\nand the median in blacks was 10 (results not shown).\nTable 1.

The potential health risks associated with\nmenthol flavoring of cigarettes is a topic of considerable\ninterest, in part because menthol cigarettes are dispro-\nportionately preferred by black smokers. It has been\nproposed that the anesthetic and cooling sensation prop-\nerties of menthol allow smokers of menthol cigarettes to\ninhale more smoke from each cigarette than smokers of\nnonmenthol cigarettes (17, 18). It has been hypothesized\nthat the resulting higher smoke exposure over time\nresults in higher smoking-related diseases among smo-\nkers of menthol cigarettes (19). As previously stated, our\nresults showed that a higher percent of black smokers\nsmoked a menthol cigarette brand and cigarettes with a\nhigher FTC nicotine level than white smokers. Also, on an\naverage, the specific menthol brand and subbrands black\nsmokers smoked had a higher FTC nicotine levels than\nthe nonmenthol brands (the preferred type of cigarette\nsmoked by whites) smoked by white smokers.\nAt least 2 previous studies have found higher cotinine\nconcentrations among smokers of mentholated cigarettes\nTable 3.

In our study, we found no evidence\nof higher serum cotinine concentrations among smokers\n(white or black) of menthol cigarettes compared to smo-\nkers of nonmentholated cigarettes when smoking the\nsame number of cigarettes smoked per day. Among black\nsmokers specifically, we found no differences in serum\ncotinine concentration between smokers of menthol and\nnonmenthol cigarettes, nor in the number of cigarettes\nsmoked per day even after adjustment for the FTC nico-\ntine yield (9.1 vs. 9.3, respectively; results not shown);\nlikewise, we found no differences in the number of\ncigarettes smoked per day by whites who smoked\nmentholated or nonmentholated cigarettes (results not\nshown). In contrast, in a cross-sectional study of 19,545\nsmokers hospitalized for non\u00adtobacco-related diseases,\nMuscat and colleagues noted that among both whites and\nblacks, menthol brands were more often listed by smo-\nkers of 1 pack per day or less, compared with heavier\nsmokers (28). In particular, black and white smokers of\nmenthol cigarettes did not have higher mean serum\ncotinine concentrations than smokers of nonmenthol\ncigarettes. If serum cotinine concentration is, in fact, a\nproxy for overall smoke exposure, our findings provide\nno evidence of higher exposure to overall smoke among\nsmokers of menthol brands. This conclusion would be\nstrengthened by data showing no effect of cigarette\nmentholation status on smoking topography and by\npatterns of cigarette consumption by mainstream smoke\nmenthol levels.\nA key question that remains to be answered is what\naccounts for racial differences in serum cotinine concen-\ntrations between black and white smokers if smoking a\nmenthol or nonmenthol brand does not explain the\ndifference? (7) When looking at racial differences by\nFTC-measured nicotine levels, levels that in fact are\nhighly correlated with menthol cigarette brands, we\nfound that black smokers consistently had higher serum\ncotinine concentrations at a cpd of 5 of less than white\nsmokers regardless of the FTC-measured nicotine level\n(0.8 or 1.1 mg). In a study conducted by P\nerez-Stable and\ncolleagues in a clinical investigation of smokers who\nsmoked half to one pack per day, they concluded that\nthe higher levels of serum cotinine concentrations in\nblack smokers compared with white smokers was\nexplained by higher nicotine intake (30% more) per\ncigarette and slower cotinine clearance in the black sub-\njects (29). The NHANES data we used for our study\nshowed a much higher intake of nicotine per cigarette\nin black smokers, especially at the lower levels of cigar-\nettes smoked per day. We found that at lower levels of\ncigarette smoking (1\u00ad3 and 4\u00ad9 cpd), black smokers had\nthat of white smokers, and at higher smoking levels (!10\ncpd), they were 22% to 35% higher in black smokers than\nwhite smokers. It is important to note that serum cotinine\nconcentration increased rapidly up to 10 to 15 cpd, more\nso among black smokers than white smokers, before\nleveling off at approximately 15 to 20 cpd. Muscat and\ncolleagues (30) pointed out that this plateau effect partly\nexplains why the frequency of daily smoking is only\nmoderately correlated with cotinine levels. Because the\nsmokers studied by P\nerez-Stable and colleagues all\nsmoked one half pack or more per day, it is unknown\nwhether there are even greater racial differences in intake\nor clearance at low levels of smoking that would account\nfor our findings. It is possible that other factors such as\nextreme inhalation at the lowest levels of cigarette smok-\ning (<10 cpd) and time to first cigarette after waking may\nexplain some of these differences. The higher percent of\nblacks in NHANES who were at the poverty level might\nexplain the much higher intake smoke, where persons of\nlow income need to maximize their nicotine intake per\ncigarette. Finally, more research needs to be conducted to\nassess why black females appear to be different from\nwhite females in serum cotinine concentration.\nOur study has limitations. As mentioned, we were not\nable to measure the actual concentration of menthol on\neach cigarette brand smoked by smokers in this study,\nalthough the difference in mainstream smoke menthol\nconcentration between menthol and nonmenthol brands\nis an order of magnitude greater than the between-brand\ndifference for any 2 menthol brands (13). Still, our study\nassessed the relation between smoking a menthol brand\nand serum cotinine levels and not the relation of the\namount of menthol in each cigarette brand and serum\ncotinine levels. Second, cigarette brands, including\nmenthol brands, may have changed over time in the\namount of menthol flavoring or nicotine they have in\nit; thus, our study is specific to brands used by smokers in\nOur study also has some methodologic advantages\nover previous population-or laboratory-based studies.\nFirst, our study sample represents the U.S. noninstitutio-\nnalized population, including smokers, and thus we were\nable to assess serum cotinine concentrations among smo-\nkers in the United States who smoked their cigarettes\nunder natural smoking conditions. Second, the informa-\ntion we collected on cigarette brand was collected first by\nthe interviewer looking at the pack used by the smoker\nand then verified using the specific UPC bar code infor-\nmation on the side of the cigarette pack, allowing accurate\nascertainment of whether the brand was menthol or\nnonmenthol. In contrast, self-reports of types of cigarettes\nsmoked are subject to bias (31).\nThe dangers of smoking have been known for dec-\nades (32, 33), and during that period, many policy\noptions for reducing those dangers have been devel-\noped (34, 35). The focus on tar, nicotine, and carbon\nmonoxide testing after the 1964 report on smoking and\nhealth (32) led to multiple product changes (36), but\nthese product changes did not promote public health.\nCaraballo et al.\nCancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 20(7) July 2011 Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention\nResearch.\ncebp.aacrjournals.org\nDownloaded from\n(37) The FDA now has the authority to regulate cigarette\nadditives and labels, smokeless tobacco, and roll your\nown tobacco and the potential to change the landscape\nof accessibility to cigarettes and other tobacco products.\nFDA can also require changes in the composition of\ntobacco products, reduce the amount of nicotine in\ncigarettes, and require changes in other potentially\nharmful ingredients to reduce exposure to toxic and\ncarcinogenic emissions in people who continue to use\nthe products and nonusers exposed to the smoke of\nsome of these products. The FDA is now examining\noptions for regulating menthol cigarettes; although,\nthere is no statutory requirement for FDA to make a\ndecision or take action on menthol cigarettes. Formula-\ntion and implementation of product-based policies\nrequire further studies like ours as part of an effort to\nimprove our ability to predict metabolic, behavioral,\nand health consequences of changes in tobacco product\ndesign.\nDisclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest\nThe findings and conclusions in this article are those of the authors and\ndo not necessarily represent the official position of the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention.\nThe costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part by the\npayment of page charges.
