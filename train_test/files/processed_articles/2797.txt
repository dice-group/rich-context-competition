In contrast to RCTs, which elegantly assess the\ncausal efficacy of a specific treatment in a specific population, PBE examines associations among many treatments\nand outcomes. It is an observational approach that does not disrupt the treatment setting and assesses the full range\nof treatments used across all patients. PBE seems a good match for the rehabilitation paradigm of multiple rehabi-\nlitation practitioners providing many individualized inputs concurrently. SCIRehab advances earlier studies that\nintroduced the PBE methodology to rehabilitation research: the Post-Stroke Rehabilitation Project (PSROP)1 and\nthe Joint Replacement Outcomes in Inpatient Rehabilitation Facilities and Nursing Treatment sites (JOINTS).2\nThe methodology also is being applied in an ongoing study of traumatic brain injury rehabilitation.\nSince the unique focus of PBE is on the complexity of the treatment process, the database developed in the\nSCIRehab project is perhaps one of the most comprehensive of any observational research study. Its use of specialized\nsoftware on electronic handheld personal digital assistants (PDAs) to capture detailed data at the point of care for\neach patient interaction by each clinician involved in the patient's treatment provides a wealth of information that\nmay be explored in attempts to identify associations between the many facets of rehabilitation care and better\npost-rehabilitation outcomes. In addition to details of clinical interaction, extensive patient and treatment data\nwere abstracted from medical records and a broad array of outcomes were collected through follow-up interviews\nat six- and twelve-months post injury.\nThis PBE approach is critically dependent on the participation of clinicians who take part in the care process to\nprovide detailed and timely data. It appears that, with the documentation of over 500,000 treatment interventions\nby over 1000 clinicians, the methodology has succeeded in engaging the participation of clinicians. Lead clinicians\nfrom each discipline at each of the six study centers fully participate in design, analysis, and dissemination efforts\nas evidenced by authorship in the initial Journal of Spinal Cord Medicine series of SCIRehab articles (June 2009)\nthat presents the rehabilitation taxonomy as well as this current series that describes details of the treatment\nprocess and variation in interventions associated with patient characteristics. The final proposed series will associate\ntreatment characteristics with outcomes at discharge and one-year post injury, after controlling for patient and injury\ncharacteristics.\nLimitations of the PBE approach however, must be recognized as the SCIRehab study moves forward examining the\nrelationship of treatments to outcomes. It must be emphasized that associations found may be important and may lead\nto changes in practice; however, they do not allow for drawing causal conclusions. In fact, PBE has been criticized for\nimplying causal relationships3 and committing type I errors because sample sizes were not sufficient to split the sample\ninto two random subgroups so that initial analytic models could be developed on one sample and replicated on a second\nsubsample from the same study.4 To address these concerns analytic plans for the SCIRehab study include splitting the\nfull dataset of 1,377 patients into two subsamples, analyzing one and validating findings on the other.\n\u00a9 The Academy for Spinal Cord Injury Professionals, Inc. 2011\nThe next phase of the SCIRehab project will demonstrate the utility of the PBE approach, highlight its weaknesses,\nor most likely, some of both. The potential strength of PBE lies in its ability to identify many promising relationships\nin one large study when the current field of SCI rehabilitation has little evidence base. SCIRehab certainly provides a\ndatabase containing many details of the rehabilitation process, and next, the project will explore whether the combi-\nnation of the detailed process data and patient characteristics produce meaningful insights into what interventions\nand treatment approaches are associated most strongly with positive outcomes for particular groups of patients.\nThe series of SCIRehab papers in this issue clearly documents wide variation in the type and amount of treatment\nprovided to patients with SCI that is not explained by patient and injury characteristics alone; this leaves plenty of\ntreatment variation to be associated with outcomes in the next project phase. However, a risk is that functional out-\ncomes at the time of rehabilitation discharge will be explained largely by the level and completeness of injury, leaving\nlittle remaining variance to be explained by patient or treatment characteristics. On the other hand, more distal out-\ncomes such as societal participation and satisfaction with life may be influenced by a myriad of factors and the influ-\nence of treatment variables may be relatively small or not yet fully realized at only 12-months post injury. But despite\nthese cautions, the third series of SCIRehab papers (to be published in this journal) will examine relationships\nbetween treatments and outcomes to identify those treatments associated with better outcomes after controlling\nfor patient differences. It also should provide considerable insight into the relative value that PBE methodology\nbrings to SCI rehabilitation research.\nReferences\n1 DeJong G, Horn S, Conroy B, Nichols D, Healton E.
