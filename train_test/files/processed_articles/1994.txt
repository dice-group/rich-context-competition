Relatively high doses of perchlorate can inhibit iodine uptake and impair thyroid function, and\nthus could impair neurological development in utero. We examined human exposures to perchlorate in the Imperial Valley\namong individuals consuming locally grown produce and compared perchlorate exposure doses to state and federal\nreference doses. We collected 24-hour urine specimen from a convenience sample of 31 individuals and measured urinary\nexcretion rates of perchlorate, thiocyanate, nitrate, and iodide. In addition, drinking water and local produce were also\nsampled for perchlorate. All but two of the water samples tested negative for perchlorate. Perchlorate levels in 79 produce\nsamples ranged from non-detect to 1816 ppb. Estimated perchlorate doses ranged from 0.02 to 0.51 mg/kg of body weight/\nday. Perchlorate dose increased with the number of servings of dairy products consumed and with estimated perchlorate\nlevels in produce consumed. The geometric mean perchlorate dose was 70% higher than for the NHANES reference\npopulation. Our sample of 31 Imperial Valley residents had higher perchlorate dose levels compared with national reference\nranges. Although none of our exposure estimates exceeded the U. S. EPA reference dose, three participants exceeded the\nacceptable daily dose as defined by bench mark dose methods used by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard\nAssessment.\nCitation: English P, Blount B, Wong M, Copan L, Olmedo L, et al.

It is primarily synthesized for use as an oxidant\nin solid rocket propellant. Perchlorate has been detected in food\nand drinking water from various regions of the U.S. [1\u00ad3], and\nhuman exposure to perchlorate is widespread in the U.S.\npopulation [4]. At high doses (mg/kg of body weight/day),\nperchlorate can affect the ability of the thyroid to absorb iodine\nand can limit the production of thyroid hormones, which are\nimportant for proper development in children [5]. Continued\ninhibition of iodine uptake can lead to hypothyroidism, which can\nresult in metabolic problems in adults and abnormal development\nduring gestation and infancy. Low doses (mg/kg/day) of\nperchlorate have been associated with decreased thyroxine and\nincreased thyroid-stimulating hormone levels in women with low\nurinary iodine levels [6]. Even small changes in thyroid hormone\nlevels are cause for concern, as mild hypothyroidism during\npregnancy has been associated with subtle cognitive defects in\nchildren [7\u00ad9]. Other compounds that inhibit iodine uptake are\nthiocyanate (SCN) and nitrate (NO3\n) [10]. These compounds are\nalso present in dietary and water sources, and SCN is a major\nmetabolite of cyanide found in cigarette smoke, so these\ncompounds are important to consider when examining perchlo-\nrate's antithyroid effects [11].\nAlthough perchlorate exposure is widespread in the U.S.\npopulation, some locations may have higher exposure than others.\nOne such location is the Lower Colorado River region. In Nevada,\nammonium perchlorate manufacturing activities contaminated\nground and surface waters, and eventually, Lake Mead and the\nColorado River (Figure 1). The U.S. Environmental Protection\nAgency (EPA) and the State of Nevada are currently overseeing\ncleanup operations for the area. The Colorado River is a primary\nsource of drinking water for 15 million\u00ad20 million people in\nArizona, Nevada, and California and also serves as the sole source\nof irrigation water for California's Imperial Valley. Imperial\nfamilies are below the poverty level. Potentially elevated chemical\nexposures in this low-income population may raise issues of\nenvironmental equity.\nThe California Environmental Health Tracking Program\n(CEHTP) conducts surveillance on environmental exposures and\nenvironmentally-related chronic diseases. Due to concerns ex-\npressed about levels of perchlorate in produce grown in the lower\nColorado River region [12] and the lack of human exposure\nstudies [13], CEHTP partnered with the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention (CDC), the California Department of\nPublic Health (CDPH) Food and Drug Laboratory Branch\n(FDLB), the California Department of Toxic Substances Control\n(DTSC), and 2 nongovernmental organizations (Commonweal\nand Comite\n\u00b4 Ci\n\u00b4vico del Valle) to measure perchlorate exposure in\nthe Imperial Valley among persons consuming locally grown\nproduce.\nMaterials and Methods\nWe recruited a convenience sample of 31 residents living in\nImperial County, California, from attendees of a community\nmeeting related to local environmental concerns. Written\ninformed consent was obtained from each participant. Adult\nresidents who consumed local produce were eligible to participate.\nWe designed a short questionnaire to elicit information on\nparticipants' demographic and personal characteristics (e.g.,\ngender, age, weight, and height), smoking history, primary source\nof drinking water, water filter use in the home, water consumption,\nand source of produce. We also asked participants to complete a\n24-hr dietary recall and a food diary to be completed for the 24-hr\nstudy period. All materials were available in Spanish and English.\nWritten informed consent was obtained from all participants. All\nhuman subject protocols were approved by the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention's institutional review board. Participants\nreceived their individual results from the laboratory tests of urine,\nproduce, and water and were also provided materials to help\ninterpret the results. Group findings were presented at a\nparticipant meeting, and a local clinician was available for\nconsultation with participants for any health concerns related to\nthe study.\nIn addition, participants were asked to collect samples of all\ndrinking water and all local produce consumed during a 24-hr\nperiod. Study staff provided standardized containers to partici-\npants for collection of all samples. Participants were instructed to\ncollect approximately 2 ounces of each produce sample in a plastic\nbag. Produce samples were stored in participants' freezers until\ncollected by study staff. Participants were also instructed to collect\na 24-hr urine specimen, beginning after the last void of the day.\nUrine was chilled in coolers or participants' refrigerators during\nsample collection and transported in coolers by study staff. Total\nurine volume was measured volumetrically and recorded for each\nstudy participant. Urine sample aliquots (5 mL) were removed\nfrom the vessels storing the 24-hr urine samples, transferred to\nFigure 1.

Produce\nsamples were shipped to the CDPH FDLB, and water samples\nwere analyzed by the DTSC.\nWater samples were analyzed to detect perchlorate by using\nEPA method 6850 (liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry)\nwith a detection limit of 1 mg/L. Perchlorate was resolved by high-\nperformance liquid chromatography from the sample matrix,\nionized by using negative electrospray ionization, and partially\nfragmented by mass spectrometry (MS). Perchlorate was further\nfragmented into daughter ions upon collision with an inert gas and\ndetected by tandem MS using mass-to-charge (m/z) ratios 83\n) [14]. Quantitation and\nidentification of perchlorate were performed by comparing the\nratios of the primary perchlorate mass transitions to internal\nstandard mass transitions and by using retention times. Upon\npositive detection, 2 samples were further analyzed to confirm\naccuracy and precision. Samples were transferred to a clean\ncentrifuge tube and evaporated to dryness under a stream of\nnitrogen at 70uC. The samples were then resuspended in 1.0 mL\nof deionized water.\nProduce was analyzed for perchlorate by using ion chromatog-\nraphy-tandem MS [15]. The produce was chopped with a food\nprocessor (Robot Coupe USA, Inc., Jackson, MS, USA) until the\nmatrix was homogeneous. A portion of chopped produce (10 g)\nwas transferred to a 50 mL polypropylene tube, and 100 mL of\n3.0 mg/mL (300 ng) labeled internal standard was added. This\nmaterial was acidified by addition of 20 mL of 1% (vol/vol)\nsodium hydroxide acetic acid, hand-shaken for 2 minutes and\npassed through a 500 mg\u00ad6 mL SupelcleanTM ENVI-CarbTM\ncartridge (Sigma-Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI, USA) preconditioned\nwith 6 mL of water by applying vacuum such that the flow rate\nwas approximately 100 mL/second. This extract was filtered\nthrough a 0.20 mm PTFE filter and analyzed by ion chromatog-\nraphy-tandem MS using a Waters Quattro microTM API triple-\nquad mass spectrometer operating in negative ion multiple\nreaction monitoring mode. The m/z transition from 99 to 83\nwas primary for quantitating perchlorate, and the m/z transition\n-labeled sodium perchlorate\n(ICON Services, Inc., Summit, NJ, USA) served as internal\nstandard for monitoring the m/z transitions from 107 to 89 and\n109 to 91 for quantitation and confirmation, respectively. The\nlimit of quantitation was 1 ng/g. All produce results were reported\nusing the wet weight of the edible portion of produce.\nPerchlorate and related anions (thiocyanate, nitrate, and iodide)\nwere measured in urine by ion chromatography-tandem MS [16].\nAnalytes were quantified on the basis of the peak area ratio of mass\ntransitions for analyte to stable isotope-labeled internal standard.\nand 500 mg/L, for perchlorate, iodide, thiocyanate, and nitrate,\nrespectively. Analytic accuracy and precision were tested by\nconcurrent analysis of quality control materials in the same\nanalysis batch as the unknown specimen. Reported results met the\naccuracy and precision specifications of the quality control and\nquality assurance program of the Division of Laboratory Sciences,\nNational Center for Environmental Health, CDC [16]. All\nanalytes were detected in all samples with the exception of 4\nurine samples that did not contain measurable levels of nitrate;\nnitrate levels in these two samples were assigned an imputed value\nof half the detection limit for calculating the geometric mean of the\ndistribution.\nUrinary creatinine concentrations were determined by using an\nautomated colorimetric method on a Roche/Hitachi Modular\nAnalytics SWA system (Roche Diagnostics Corp., IN, USA).\nCreatinine excretion rate (g/24-hr) was calculated by multiplying\nmeasured urinary creatinine concentration by the total volume of\n24-hr urine collected. The calculated 24-hr creatinine excretion\nrate was then compared with expected 24-hr creatinine excretion\nrate based on the study participant age, sex, height, and weight\n\u00bd \n\u00f0 \u00de\u00c3\nwt kg\nWe computed perchlorate dose in urine by multiplying the\nperchlorate concentration by the 24-hr urine volume and dividing\nthe product by body weight (mg/kg/day). Total iodine intake was\nestimated by multiplying urine iodide concentration by 24-hr\nurine volume.\nFinal perchlorate doses were compared to the U.S. EPA\nReference Dose of 0.70 mg/kg/day [19]. We also compared\nmeasured perchlorate doses with an ``acceptable daily dose''\ncomputed based on the current methodology of the California\nOffice of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) (C.\nSteinmaus, personal communication). In its Public Health Goal for\nPerchlorate, the OEHHA computed the health-protective water\nconcentration for perchlorate [20] as follows:\nConcentration~BMDL|RSC| BW=WC\n\u00f0 \u00de=UF\nIn this formula, BMDL = the lower limit of a one-sided 95% CI of\na perchlorate dose that reduces mean thyroidal iodine uptake by\n5%; RSC = relative source contribution; BW/WC = the ratio of\nbody weight to tap water consumption rate; and UF = an\nuncertainty factor of 10 to account for sensitive populations such\nas pregnant women and infants. Using current OEHHA\nmethodology, we computed an acceptable daily dose (ADD) as\nfollows:\nSurvey questionnaire data were double-entered into Excel\nspeadsheets (Excel version 2003, SP3, Microsoft, Redmond,\nWA, USA) and then imported into SAS for analysis (SAS version\n9.1.3., SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA). We calculated\ngeometric means and CIs for perchlorate, nitrate, thiocyanate, and\ntotal iodine intake. For each person, perchlorate concentration was\nsummed for all produce sampled. Total number of servings of\ndairy products (i.e., milk, yogurt, and ice cream) was also summed\nfor each person. We used the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test to\ncompare levels of perchlorate dose by total dairy servings and\nperchlorate concentration in produce [21]. The perchlorate dose\nwas log-normally distributed, so total servings of dairy and total\nconcentration of perchlorate in produce were regressed on the log-\nnormal perchlorate dose in linear regression models.\nResults\nParticipant Characteristics\nThe age of participants ranged from 18 to 88, with an average\nschool education, 12.9% were high school graduates, and 12.9%\nhad at least a college degree. Almost all (97%) participants were\nMeasurement of Perchlorate Exposure Biomarkers\nMarch\nHispanic, except for 1 non-Hispanic white. Eighty-one percent of\nparticipants elected to have the interview conducted in Spanish.\nSixty-five percent of the participants were female, none of whom\nreported being pregnant at the time of the interview. Seventy-five\npercent of the women were of reproductive age (ages 15\u00ad49). Only\n1 participant reported being a tobacco smoker. Two respondents\nreported working in agriculture. When asked to identify the\nprimary source of drinking water in the home, 36% of participants\nreported bottled water, 23% reported tap water, and the\nremaining respondents reported various sources, such as well\nwater, delivery truck, and grocery store dispensers. Forty-five\npercent of participants consumed ,25% of their water away from\nhome. Total dairy consumption averaged 1.05 servings per person\nper day, with a range of 0\u00ad5 servings.\nWater and Produce Perchlorate Results\nResults of water confirmation analyses showed consistency\nwith original, primary sample results. Additionally, method\nblanks, method standard recoveries, and sample duplicate\nanalyses' results were all within accepted control limits and\npercentages. Only 2 of 68 water samples had detectable levels of\nperchlorate (2.4 and 2.5 mg/L perchlorate), both of which were\nless than half the California regulatory standard of 6 mg/L.\nPerchlorate levels in the 79 produce samples ranged from\nnondetectable to 1816 ppb (ng of perchlorate per g of net weight\nof edible portion) (Table 2). The highest perchlorate levels were\ndetected in nopales (cactus) (maximum of 1398 ppb) and quelites\n(Mexican greens) (2 samples tested, with levels of 1720 and\n1816 ppb, respectively). Many produce categories, such as\nlettuce, broccoli, grapefruit, tomatoes, watermelon, and corn,\nhad perchlorate levels #4 ppb. For 14 samples with perchlorate\nlevels falling below the detection limit, we used an imputed value\nof half the detection limit. The mean perchlorate level of all\nproduce was 80.8 ppb. Most produce types had too few samples\nper type to compute a representative average. Among those\npersons who provided produce (n = 24), the mean perchlorate\nlevel in their produce was 266 ppb per person. Produce\nperchlorate levels were in the range of similar kinds of produce\ntested by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in\nnationally representative samples, except for celery and cucum-\nbers, which were higher in our samples, and tomatoes and\nwatermelon, which were lower (Table 2).\nUrine Results\nThe 24-hr creatinine output was normally distributed with a\noutput was compared with the predicted 24-hr creatinine output\n[17] to evaluate completeness of urine collection. The average\nratio of measured-to-predicted 24-hr creatinine was 1.03,\nindicating good compliance of the study participants for collecting\nall urine within the defined 24-hr study period.\nPerchlorate concentrations in urine ranged from1.08 mg/L to\nbody weight/day.

Although all study participants had\nmeasurable perchlorate levels in their urine, none of the exposure\ndoses exceeded the U.S. EPA reference dose of 0.70 mg/kg/day.\nWe also compared perchlorate exposure estimates with the\nacceptable daily dose (0.37 mg/kg/day) derived by using current\nmethodology of the California Office of Environmental Health\nHazard Assessment. Three study participants had perchlorate\nexposure dose estimates in excess of this acceptable daily dose. The\nhealth implications of this perchlorate exposure are unknown.\nThe developing fetus is thought to be a particularly sensitive life\nstage for perchlorate exposure [5]. Measurement of perchlorate in\namniotic fluid confirms that perchlorate can cross the placenta\n[22]. Therefore, we further examined perchlorate exposure in the\n48% of our study population who were women of reproductive\nage. We found that 1 of these women exceeded the acceptable\ndaily dose calculated by using OEHHA methodology. Among the\niodine intake (below the RDI). Continued perchlorate exposure\nabove the OEHHA threshold among these women could increase\ntheir risk of subclinical hypothyroidism, which has been linked to\nsubtle cognitive defects in children. To what degree perchlorate\nexposure contributes to the prevalence of subclinical hypothyroid-\nism (2%\u00ad3%) in women of reproductive age is unknown [23].\nPerchlorate exposure is of health concern because perchlorate\ninhibits uptake of iodine, which is essential for thyroid function.\nTable 2.

S. residents from the National Health and\nMeasurement of Perchlorate Exposure Biomarkers\nMarch\nThiocyanate (elevated after exposure to cyanide in tobacco smoke,\nfor example) and nitrate may interact with perchlorate in an\nadditive fashion that also inhibits iodine uptake [10]. The levels of\nthiocyanate and nitrate found in this study were comparable to or\nlower than levels found previously in other populations [4]. We\nalso evaluated urinary levels of iodine in this population. The\ngeometric mean for iodine was found to be 158 mg/day, indicating\na generally adequate intake of iodine. If a person's estimated\niodine intake was less than the recommended daily intake of\n150 mg/day, then he or she was advised to increase iodine intake\nthrough diet or by taking iodine-containing supplements. Addi-\ntionally, for study participants who chose to add salt to their food,\nwe mentioned iodized salt in small amounts as an effective iodine\nsource.\nWe did not find that the drinking water samples collected in the\n24-hr study period had significant levels of perchlorate. Only 2\nsamples had detectable levels (.1 mg/L detection limit), and both\nwere below the Maximum Contaminant Limit (6 mg/L) for\nCalifornia. Conversely, we found several samples of produce\nconsumed by participants to have high levels of perchlorate,\nnotably nopales (opuntia cactus) and quelites, with levels exceeding\n1700 ppb. These results are consistent with other published\nmeasurements of relatively high levels of perchlorate in opuntia\ncactus [24]. Perchlorate levels in some produce tested, such as\ncantaloupe, grapefruit, pepper, broccoli, and lemon, are in the\nsame range as levels that have been reported previously [1,27],\nand others, including watermelon and tomato, had lower levels\nthan previously detected. We found moderate perchlorate\ncontamination in cucumbers (439.8 ppb), similar to previously\npublished results [25].\nConsistent with the scientific literature, we found that\nperchlorate dose was related to intake of dairy products and\nproduce. Dairy products, fruits and vegetables have been\ncharacterized by other scientists as contributing significantly to\nperchlorate intakes [26,27]. In our study we found that each\n10 ppb of perchlorate measured in produce was related to a\nmarginally-significant 1% increase in estimated perchlorate dose\n(p = 0.09). Similarly we found that each serving of milk/dairy\nproducts, based on questionnaire data, was associated with a 24%\nincrease in estimated perchlorate dose (p = 0.04). While our\nregression modeling indicates that dairy consumption and produce\nperchlorate levels are directly related to estimated perchlorate\ndose, these models only explained a relatively small amount of the\ntotal variance in estimated perchlorate dose in the study\npopulation (13\u00ad14%). The most plausible explanation of the low\nrelatively R2 of our regression models is that we could not include\na variable for the total intake amount of perchlorate from produce\n(no serving size data) and milk/dairy products (no measurement of\nperchlorate levels of serving size). Furthermore, the physiological\nhalf life of perchlorate in the human body (,8 hrs) would lead to\nimperfect overlap between questionnaire data and perchlorate\nexcreted into the 24-hr urine, and consumption of other food items\nbesides local produce during the study period would introduce\nfurther variability.\nThis study had several strengths and limitations. To our\nknowledge, this is the first effort to directly measure perchlorate\nexposure biomarkers in this population with potentially elevated\nexposure. In addition to perchlorate, we also measured toxicolog-\nically-related anions thiocyanate, nitrate, and iodide in each study\nparticipant's urine. Our exposure assessment was further strength-\nFigure 2. Geometric mean perchlorate dose in urine (mg/kg of body weight/day) and 95% confidence intervals in study participants\nby total dairy servings, Imperial County, California, 2009.\nMeasurement of Perchlorate Exposure Biomarkers\nMarch\nened by measuring these anions in a 24-hr urine sample so that the\ndata was less variable than spot urine measurements. Furthermore,\nthis biomonitoring data was paired with simultaneously collected\nproduce and drinking water samples to assist in identifying\npotential exposure sources. However, we were able to only assess\ndairy consumption through interview and were unable to directly\nmeasure perchlorate levels in dairy samples. Instead, we reference\npreviously published perchlorate levels in dairy milk in this region\nOur perchlorate dose estimate method assumed that exactly\n24 hrs worth of urine was collected. Comparison of measured 24-\nhr creatinine with predicted 24-hr creatinine indicates that, on\naverage, the predicted and measured creatinine excretion agree\nremarkably well (average ratio = 1.03). However, 1 woman\nexcreted only 54% of the creatinine expected for her age and\nbody weight, perhaps due to differences in lean body mass or to\nincomplete collection of the urine samples within the 24-hr period.\nThus, our exposure estimates for this 1 study participant may be\nbiased towards being lower than actual exposure levels.\nAdditional limitations include the small convenience sample of\nstudy participants which prevent us from generalizing these results\nto Imperial County residents and the single sampling day, which\ndid not enable us to study variability of exposure across days and\nseasons. Additionally, we did not examine any health or thyroid\nendpoints.\nIn conclusion, we found that our sample of 31 Imperial Valley\nresidents had higher perchlorate dose levels compared with\nnational reference ranges. Additionally, 3 participants exceeded\nthe acceptable daily dose calculated by using methods of the\nCalifornia Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment.\nSeveral produce samples collected had high perchlorate levels,\nexceeding 1700 ppb. Continued biomonitoring of perchlorate\nexposure in this population could help evaluate whether reducing\nperchlorate contamination of the Colorado River over time leads\nto reduced human exposure.\n"
