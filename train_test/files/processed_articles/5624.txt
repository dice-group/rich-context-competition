These models are framed by an assertion\nthat our planet holds a vast reserve that could define the 21st century as profoundly as oil has shaped the 20th century.\nThey are premised on a comparison: Unlike oil or mineral ores whose global volume is just a sum of their deposits across\nthe world, the 21st-century reserve--the yet-to-be-tapped scientific knowledge embedded in biologically opulent landscapes\nand seascapes--grows in volume and worth in the context of evolutionary, ecological, and other relationships that transcend\nregions and political borders. They are grounded in legacy-investment opportunities whose competitiveness and prestige grow\nalong with the geographical footprint of the research they underwrite. While various stages of these models' conceptualization\nand validation have been published in scholarly journals and enriched with endorsements by several members and officers of\nthe United States National Academy of Sciences and by heads of state and UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific,\nand Cultural Organization) leaders, this article is the first comprehensive presentation of both.

Oil\nbecame deeply intertwined with national strategies and global\npolitics and power. To a large extent, national economies of the\n20th century can be viewed as oil economies.\nThe onset of the 21st century is marked by a rapid transi-\ntion of the global economy toward a knowledge economy,\ncreating knowledge societies (United Nations Educational,\nScientific, and Cultural Organization [UNESCO], 2005).\nThe 21st century is also widely regarded as the century of\ninvestments in education and science by Qatar (Clark,\n2013), United Arab Emirates (Ahmed & Abdalla Alfaki,\n2013), and other petroleum-rich countries striving to diver-\nsify their economies away from oil herald this trend.

I have argued that our planet holds a vast reserve\nthat could define the 21st century--a reserve that ought to be\nmobilized and nurtured with the same vigor as are research\nparks, scientific cities, and knowledge-based industries in\nbuilding viable and sustainable knowledge economies.\nThis reserve is embedded in the still largely unspoiled\nlandscapes and seascapes of our planet, involving such fea-\ntures as rain forests, coral reefs, and other spectacularly bio-\ndiverse habitats and harboring geologic history rich in fossil\nrecords. These extraordinary natural environments, most\nopulent in the world's tropics and within the borders of\ndeveloping countries, are treasuries of potential scientific\nknowledge. I view these natural assets as prime repositories\nof the knowledge mineral, the raw material for the knowl-\nedge economy. My basic claim is that countries abounding in\nbiodiversity and other natural riches of scientific importance\ncould achieve influence and wealth comparable in magni-\ntude--and incomparably superior in endurance--with those\nthat oil-rich countries have traditionally enjoyed.\nThis dramatic redefinition of the geography of wealth is\nconditioned on strategies that disregard national borders. A\ncomparison between the geography of the knowledge min-\neral and the geography of oil reveals a striking difference.\nWhether we look at the global, regional, or national distribu-\ntion of oil reserves, the overall amount of oil is no more than\nthe sum of these reserves. Connecting two or more reserves\ndoes not increase the volume and quality of the oil contained\nin these reserves. In contrast, the knowledge-mineral resource\ncan be fully assessed and valued only in the context of evo-\nlutionary, ecological, and other relationships that have and\ncontinue to distribute natural capital across geographies and\npolitical boundaries. These relationships--of conservation\nand scientific value--complement and enhance the knowl-\nedge content and worth of the individual natural heritage\nassets they conjoin.\nHence, I assert, the value of natural resources does not\ndiminish in the knowledge economy; it may well increase,\nmeasured in terms of \"knowledge content\" and developed on\nscales that shift the emphasis to layers of knowledge min-\neral--knowledge veins--sculpted by correlations and rela-\ntionships among multiple reservoirs of these resources.\nThe critical question becomes, \"How are we to ignite and\nsustain the potential of the natural resource-based knowledge\nstock as a source of wealth, one not meant to replace oil\nwealth but to outperform it in lasting benefit to humanity?\"\nThe answer I propose might, at first, seem surprising, even\nstartling: The international resort industry and resort-styled\nprivate estates, predisposed toward locations of outstanding\nnatural beauty and interest, are superbly positioned to become\nthe principal business partner in this scientific consolidation\nof vast stores of new knowledge. Thus, while tourism-based\neconomies and knowledge economies, viewed in conven-\ntional terms, seem to involve two dramatically different sce-\nnarios of economic development, I argue that they can be\ncombined to yield a major new economic model because they\nshare a resource base of critical importance to their strength\nand growth potential--yet under threat and gradually disap-\npearing throughout the world.\nThe Vision, Proofs, and Guarantees: A Paradigm\nin Progress\nThe goal of this article is to consolidate the aforementioned\npositions by bridging a retrospective of their genesis and\nvalidation with the unfolding perspective of their translation\ninto transnational sustainable-development strategies. Thus,\na collective mission with the capacity to strengthen the role\nof science in international policy making and diplomacy is\ncreated along with the ability to engender legacy opportuni-\nties that invite both financial and intellectual investment that\nwill produce major returns for humanity for generations to\ncome. This goal defines the article's structure.\nA prelude, \"Nature and Knowledge: An Economic\nFrontier,\" is a reflection on the existing interpretations and\nvaluations of the relationship between natural resources and\nthe knowledge economy. The original work presented in this\narticle starts with the Retrospective that is divided into two\nsections and related to some of the latest market trends and\nadvancements in the evolutionary sciences.\nThe first section, titled \"The Economic Geography of\nWonder,\" revolves around insights I have charted into the\nuntapped economic and social relevance of the dynamics and\nrelationships that pervade the natural world within and across\nnational jurisdictions. I demonstrate how these insights, and\nthe development blueprints I devised around them, have bol-\nstered national pride about natural wealth enclosed within a\ncountry's borders, increased the stature of science in the eyes\nand acts of political leaders, and laid foundations for science-\nfueled and conservation-benefiting economic collaborations\non regional and trans-regional scales.\nThe second section, \"Business Model With a Mission,\"\nsummarizes a complementary, multiyear effort I have carried\nout to devise and test an investment platform that redefines the\nworth, stature, and appreciation potential of properties located\nacross the world's most naturally privileged locations--loca-\ntions that are now entering the market greatly undervalued by\nbeing reduced to just prime real estate. This platform unlocks\nthe potential of these properties to excel as highly privileged\nstaging areas for a new breed of resort facilities catering to\nworld travelers and invited to invest in scientific discoveries\nalong far-reaching stretches of the earth's natural fabric on the\npremise of major business returns (including the capacity to\noffer unique, ever-changing experiences that are immune to\nimitation and possess the ability to command ever-greater\ncompetitive strength and prestige). Importantly, these business\nreturns are not conditioned on the investors' ownership of the\nunlocked knowledge as intellectual property and can be cou-\npled with formidable legacy rewards if backed by assurances\nthat the underwritten knowledge harvests will benefit the\nnations harboring the natural cradles of these harvests as well\nas the local communities as custodians of these cradles and as\npartners strengthened through conservation- and research-spe-\ncific training and employment. These lofty goals converge in\nan ideal partnership, but there is nothing idealistic about their\ncontent. They are backed with a well-grounded business per-\nspective for a powerful industry that will increasingly be\ndriven by travelers' thirst for knowledge and has the potential\nto become the strongest conservation force in the world.\nA paramount goal behind the synergistic efforts discussed\nin these two sections has been to empower conservation with\neconomic foundations that guard against reducing nature to a\ncommodity and that honor and value knowledge advanced\nthrough basic scientific research as public good. This goal--\nand the Retrospective--extend into the Perspective unveiled\nby this article and also subdivided into two highly synergistic\nsections.\nThe Perspective's first section, titled \"Wealth Infrastructure\nAttuned to Nature,\" introduces a pilot transnational project,\nThe Pacific Bridge to Noble Wealth (PBNW). The project's\npurpose is to engender and shepherd a sustainable multina-\ntional economy structured as innovative knowledge bridges\nthat empower science diplomacy as the engine of the new\neconomy's governance while guarding its precious stock of\nnatural riches. The design of this megaproject revolves around\nbuilding a knowledge supra structure that discloses and har-\nnesses the collective scientific importance of the connections\nand dynamics that distinguish the Pacific Island Region's\nspectacularly diverse natural heritage and that expand further\nin their collective worth along affinities that tie islands and\necosystems of the Pacific coast of the Americas with those\nalong the ocean-linked biological networks of the larger Indo-\nPacific Region. This consolidation of a grand knowledge\nbank is intended to inspire an extension of the World Heritage\nrecognition to relationships and processes that span multiple\nnatural sites or regions and are of exceptional scientific value\nand to form a novel economic block with the formidable\ncapacity to generate discoveries that will fuel major advances\nin science, medicine, and other fields of value to humanity.\nThe business model whose evolution is chronicled in this\narticle's Retrospective enters the PBNW design on the prem-\nise of utmost selectivity: selectivity in terms of the magni-\ntude of the environmental and social benefit that each\ninvestment will spur and, deservingly, will capitalize on by\nacquiring limitless potential to appreciate in stature, market\nworth, and legacy rewards. This model is employed to yield\na portfolio of legacy investments in hospitality\u00adscience part-\nnerships that is master-planned to function as a self-sustain-\ning system through which research funding and expertise\nflow into the most precious reservoirs of this planet's heri-\ntage, injecting economic justification into their protection\nand converting the guardianship of humankind's most irre-\nplaceable possessions into a vibrant job market that benefits\nthe neediest. A top priority is to use this system to ignite a\nshift from the traditional development scenario of \"tourism\nfor tourism-economy\" to a new-generation alternative, \"tour-\nism for knowledge-economy\" that is a trail-blazer in terms of\ninternational competitiveness and environmental sustainabil-\nity with widely shared benefits. The endorsements and sup-\nport that this pilot project has already received from leaders\nof several Pacific Island nations, UNESCO, and the\nUniversity of the South Pacific, and the project's inaugura-\ntion at the Arnold and Mabel Beckman Center of the United\nStates National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and\nMedicine--the West Coast Headquarters of the National\nAcademies--have laid the ground for an unprecedented sus-\ntainable-development teamwork.\n\"Turning a Vision Into a Sustainability Partnership,\" the\nPerspective's second section, reveals a strategy to reinforce\nthis teamwork's promise and endurance and to stimulate its\noutgrowth into a global opportunity. Novel environmental,\nlegal, business, and other aspects and their interface will\ndefine the implementation of the PBNW--and of my entire\nmission and aspiration to help chart a new geography, diplo-\nmacy, and legacy for the knowledge economy. Equipping all\nthese efforts with perpetual assurances of academic preemi-\nnence and receptivity to new opportunities became impera-\ntive. Acting on behalf of the Pangea World organization I\nfounded, I have been honored to initiate a strategic alliance\nwith the University of California (UC), anchored by UC\nIrvine and fortified in its potency by the presence of the West\nCoast Headquarters of the National Academies adjacent to\nthe campus. This nascent alliance has the capacity--and the\nopportunity--to ensure that knowledge derived from natural\nresources in a particular country is shared with and benefits\nthat country, while the knowledge yielded by research\ninsights into transnational threads of the earth's evolutionary\nand ecological fabric is treated as a global asset that benefits\nall of humanity. I convey my commitment to this opportunity\nwith a tribute to the late Ralph Cicerone, former National\nAcademy of Sciences President and UC Irvine Chancellor,\nwhose advice and encouragement have greatly enriched the\nPangea World journey since its formative stages.\nNature and Knowledge: An Economic\nFrontier\nThe relationship between natural resources and the knowl-\nedge economy has, thus far, been largely a function of\nimprovements in exploration and extraction techniques vis-\n\u00e0-vis the stock of economically useful oil or mineral reserves\nor productive land. A 2002 World Bank study well defines\nthis relationship and offers numerous supporting examples\n(deFerranti,Perry,Lederman,&Maloney,2002).Application\n4 SAGE Open\nof knowledge can even create new natural resources, as dem-\nonstrated by Norway's accomplishment in transforming\nwaterfalls into hydropower (Ville & Wicken, 2015).\nBrazil deserves a special look, for it challenges the contin-\nued perception of knowledge economies and natural resource\neconomies as being at two ends of a continuum of economic\ndevelopment. Bound (2008) deems Brazil a natural knowl-\nedge-economy on the premise that Brazil's bounty of natural\nresources, assets, and endowments is a key area of opportu-\nnity for science and innovation. She observes that Brazil's\ncompetitive advantage as a natural knowledge economy\ngains vigor and momentum as climate change, the environ-\nment, food scarcity, and rising worldwide energy demand are\nmoving to the forefront of global consciousness. While in\nlarge part physically enclosed within Brazil's national bor-\nders, the Amazon rain forest ecosystem is boundless as a cru-\ncial factor in the global climate equilibrium. Similarly, the\nAmazon's biodiversity is of irreplaceable value to all of\nhumanity as one of the most significant resources for the\nactive ingredients for new medicines and cures. And these\ntwo universal values of the Amazon asset are deeply inter-\ntwined, thus offering a high-profile manifestation of the\nglobally meaningful relationship between biodiversity, eco-\nsystems, and the economy. Heal (2007) summarizes this rela-\ntionship as follows:\n. . . biodiversity is a fundamental part of an ecosystem, and its\nloss is thought by biologists to affect mainly the robustness and\nproductivity of ecosystems. We can think of ecosystems as\ncapital assets. Ecosystems matter economically because they\nprovide services that are of great value to human societies. (p.\nThis brings me to a relatively new focus of environmental\neconomics that, albeit not identified with or confined to the\nknowledge-based economy, is of direct relevance to the sub-\nject of this article, for it bridges national and global perspec-\ntives. At the heart of this focus is the imperative that we think\nof ecosystems as providers of services crucial to the func-\ntioning of the earth's life support systems. In addition, we\nmust quantify the contribution of these services to human\nwell-being--also as returns on investment in conserving or\nrestoring the natural capital (for an overview and key refer-\nences, see Barbier, 2014). For example, the capacity to con-\nsume carbon during photosynthesis and, thus, reduce\ngreenhouse gas emissions is now a pivotal argument in sup-\nport of rain forest conservation. This argument, premised on\nthe enormous environmental services these biodiversity-rich\necosystems provide to the rest of the world, gained an\nunprecedented political backing from the world's govern-\nments at the global climate agreement adopted by 195 coun-\ntries in Paris in December 2015. Article 5 of the Paris\nAgreement sets the stage for forests to play a major role in\nthe fight against climate change, financed by results-based\npayments from developed to developing countries (United\nNations/Framework Convention on Climate Change/\nThe launch, in 2012, of the Ecosystem Services journal\nhas added a voice and publication channel to the quest for\nbetter knowledge of the ecological systems that provide the\nservices, of the economic systems that benefit from them,\nand of the institutions that ought to be established to develop\neffective codes for sustainable use (Braat & de Groot, 2012).\nEstimation of the global accounting value of ecosystem ser-\nvices in monetary units is a particularly daunting task (de\nGroot et al., 2012). From the pioneer estimate of US$33 tril-\nlion as the economic value of 17 ecosystem services for 16\nbiomes (Costanza et al., 1997) to the estimated loss of\nbetween US$4.3 and US$20.2 trillion/year due to the loss of\necosystem services caused by global land-use changes\nimations of the magnitude of global ecosystem services are\ninvaluable for raising global awareness about the unsustain-\nability of these services' present location largely outside the\nmarket.\nMy own search for a globally relevant model and strategy\nfor reckoning the natural capital's value for enlightened eco-\nnomic development that would yield lasting benefits for the\nenvironment and humanity has centered on the economically\nuncharted yet uniquely unifying territory of the earth's evo-\nlutionary and ecological fabric and on the priceless knowl-\nedge resource woven into this fabric. This focus--and the\nactions it has engendered--is not meant to replace or deni-\ngrate any of the existing directions and achievements in envi-\nronmental economics, science diplomacy, international\nconservation, or any other field or discipline. It seeks to\ncomplement and, hopefully, enrich and accelerate the exist-\ning efforts and their convergence in facilitating the world's\njourney toward knowledge-powered sustainable prosperity\nand environmental security.\nThe Economic Geography of Wonder\nA National Perspective\nInvitations from two nations--Fiji and Panama, respectively\nand consecutively--presented extraordinary opportunities\nfor refining in concept (in Fiji) and validating (in Panama) an\neconomic-development model I built on the assertion that\nthe scientific value of a nation's heritage bounty could\nbecome the nation's principal economic resource (H. Ayala,\nFiji, the South Pacific nation comprised of more than 350\nislands, boasts a myriad of island types, ecologies, geological\nformations, and fossil records that together offer unparalleled,\nyet largely overlooked testimony to the evolution of islands\nand coral reefs over millions of years. Panama is a geological\nwonderland packed with marine fossils that chronicle the\nbonding of a vast archipelago into the present-day isthmus\nthat divides oceans and unites continents and along which\ncountless plant and animal species have migrated and inter-\nmingled between the Americas, endowing it with breathtak-\ning botanical and faunal diversity.\nExamined nationwide, the spectra of Fiji's and Panama's\nrespective natural diversities position these two countries\nahead of most of the world's nations as mega-reserves of\nknowledge for deciphering the planet's past and planning its\nfuture. This astonishing potential of added value reveals\nitself--in both cases--only at the level of the entire country.\nRigorous research themes that would crisscross the country\nin search of novel and vital linkages among areas possessed\nof natural legacies would captivate the growing environmen-\ntal and learning interests of international leisure travelers\nwhile consolidating a knowledge resource of global signifi-\ncance. They would provide a unique foundation upon which\n\"Tourism, Conservation, and Research\" (TCR) could be\nmaster-planned to grow together and become a catalyst of\nnational well-being and international prestige fed by a labo-\nratory of knowledge valuable to multiple sectors of the\neconomy.\nThe Fiji I deemed an unparalleled heritage bank and eco-\nlogical theater--in contrast with the existing, homogenized\nmarket image of that country as an island paradise--inspired\nthe TCR economic-development platform (H. Ayala, 1995b,\n1995c). Panama served as the ideal receptor for the TCR\nplatform's validation via the TCR Action Plan for Panama,\nrenowned Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI)\ncomplemented that country's heritage bounty with another\nsingular asset that had also been entirely omitted in the tradi-\ntional economic-development plan and outlook. STRI's\nworld-class research, I argued, embodied an outstanding\nbusiness value in view of the global recognition and lasting\nappeal it would inject into a TCR platform for Panama's sus-\nDid she mean that STRI would be expected to give practical\nadvice upon which other people would be making substantial\nfinancial investment? . . . Here our work is expected to have an\nimmediate relevance to society . . . I am happy to pledge STRI's\nThe involvement of STRI's executives and experts con-\ntributed cutting-edge substance to the TCR Action Plan's key\noutcome: a nationwide network of 23 heritage routes based\non themes that span Panama on various spatial scales, reach\nmillions of years back in time, and simultaneously profile\nand strengthen the economic, conservation, and research val-\nues of the heritage assets they interlink. For example, The\nRoute of the Three Oceans exalts the discovery that--on the\nPacific side--Panama adjoins two distinctive oceanographic\nzones. These two zones, in terms of their ecology, represent\ntwo different oceans and, thus, paired with the Atlantic,\nendow the country with three oceans. Comparative genetic\nstudies that would be carried out simultaneously in these\nthree oceans of Panama would be of extraordinary signifi-\ncance for deciphering species evolution and adaptation.\nApart from its obvious scientific and conservation impor-\ntance, the three-ocean theme offers an effective tool for posi-\ntioning Panama as an international leisure destination.\nThe heritage-theme network has anchored a pilot union of\nhotel partners (H. Ayala, 2000b) and inspired novel architec-\ntural, legal, and capacity-building models and strategies\nthen National Secretary of Science, Technology, and\nInnovation--led the Panamanian Government's support and\ninvolvement, defined this pilot national project's overall\nvalue as follows:\nThe Tourism-Conservation-Research Action Plan is an\ninnovative opportunity . . . in which our country's natural capital,\ngeographical features, cultural heritage, and geological history\nare conjoined to generate sustainable tourism development, a\nsolvent conservation policy, and an ever-increasing knowledge\nbase of our nation's assets. (p. 76)\nFormally endorsing the TCR model and its pilot applica-\ntion in Panama on behalf of the American Association for the\nAdvancement of Science (AAAS), Nicholson (1999) high-\nlights this model's potential to use science in the promotion\nof human welfare and human progress on a scale that could\nnot otherwise happen. Yet, using a scale defined by a nation's\nborders only scratches the surface of this opportunity. A\npolitical line cannot define a geographical area within which\nto appreciate, engage, and guard a data bank pool fashioned\nby nature.\nA Regional Perspective\nPanama's natural capital and its knowledge content are inter-\ntwined with those of the entire Central American land bridge\nthat harbors some 10% of the world's biodiversity. In the\nmarine realm, they are an integral part of a biological corri-\ndor engendered by the convergence of major oceanic cur-\nrents, nurturing an exceptional spectrum of marine life, and\nreaching deep into the Pacific. Similarly, Fiji's treasure trove\nof evolutionary and ecological legacies contributes to and\ngrows in prominence amid the daunting diversity and com-\nplementarity of natural environments all across the Pacific\nisland ecosystems--a diversity currently outside traditional\neconomic-development strategies.\nAt the invitation of the UNESCO Office for the Pacific\nStates, I prepared a study that recognized the South Pacific\nIsland Region as an exquisite candidate for a development strat-\negy that would interlink, value, and protect the region's geologi-\ncal formations, archaeological legacies, and land and marine\necosystems (H. Ayala, 2005). Ranked as the biologically most\n6 SAGE Open\nopulent places on earth, many of these areas would serve as\nimmense data banks that are systematically unlocked through\nscientific exploration in concert with developing a regional\ntourism industry second to none. Noteworthy is this strategy's\nsynergy with \"Vaka Moana--Ocean Roads of the Pacific,\" a\ncultural program of UNESCO that seeks to assist the Pacific\npeoples to further develop their shared heritage and to promote\neconomic development consistent with the conservation and\ncareful use of the region's resources (Voi, 2005).\nHowever, the boundaries of the Pacific Island nations'\nportfolio represented by the UNESCO Pacific Office are not\nthe final markers of a geographical area within which to\nappreciate, engage, and guard nature's data bank pool.\nRecent studies of the geography of coral reef diversity (i.e.,\nof the pattern of species richness on coral reefs, which is a\nfundamental precondition for informed decisions regarding\nthe conservation and management of these globally threat-\nened and declining hotbeds of biodiversity) are disclosing a\nfascinating mosaic of cradles of species richness and of dis-\npersal routes that draw affinities among variously distant\nocean regions and archipelagos. Major contributions along\nthese lines (Reaka & Lombardi, 2011; Reaka, Rodgers, &\nKudla, 2008) have revealed that the diversity of the primary\ngroups of contemporary Indo-West Pacific coral reef organ-\nisms peaks in the East Indies triangle (Malaysia, Indonesia,\nNew Guinea, and the Philippines) of the Indo-Australian\nArchipelago, reaches a lower peak in East Africa and\nMadagascar, and declines in the central Indian Ocean and\ncentral Pacific. What a splendid, yet untapped, resource this\nexploration reveals for the development of intellectual\ndelights that would give a visitor to any one of these diversity\nhotspots insights into the coral reef heritage of the entire\nIndo-Pacific. What an opportunity this resource opens for\npositioning the rarity, inspiration, and educational value of\nsuch insights as business incentives for investments in the\ncontinuation of this ground-breaking research and its transla-\ntion into conservation and sustainable-management mea-\nsures of international scope and influence.\nA global scale is the only scale with which to fully dis-\nclose, consolidate, value, and protect the natural reserves of\nthe knowledge stock, within a multiplicity of overlaying\nunits delimited by geological, evolutionary, and ecological\nmarkers.\nA Transnational/Global Perspective\nThe subject of connectivity is becoming ever more prominent\nand relevant as a conservation imperative. Based on their\nstudy of connectivity conservation projects and experiences\nthroughout the world, Worboys, Francis, and Lockwood\n(2010) offer guidance for national and international connec-\ntivity conservation initiatives, with emphasis on large-scale,\nnaturally interconnected areas--also as critical strategic and\nadaptive responses to climate change. They demonstrate the\nimportance of connectivity conservation for sustaining the\necosystem services of terrestrial and marine environments\nand for enabling plant and animal movement between habitat\npatches as well as for preserving connectedness required by\nspatially dependent evolutionary processes.\nThere is another dimension of connectivity that could be\nreferred to as contextual connectivity and that both shapes\nand is shaped by bold research endeavors of transnational\nscales but of trajectories that are spatially patchy in the pres-\nent world. Reaka's (2014) novel approach to deciphering the\npatterns of global endemism and diversity brings to light evo-\nlutionary linkages that tie various ocean biotas to ancient\nmarine-diversity centers elsewhere in the world. These link-\nages do not entail any physical or functional connectivity at\npresent, but they are of immense value to science and conser-\nvation as well as of considerable potential to boost the worth\nand stature of currently overlooked heritage assets and their\nlocales. Reaka confirms that, today, the pinnacles of global\nmarine and terrestrial diversity occur in the Old World Indo-\nAustralian tropics, the New World tropics, and, to a lesser\nextent, the southwestern Indian Ocean. But it was not always\nso, she asserts. Two hundred million years ago, a single global\ncenter of diversity occurred in the Tethys Seaway (Europe,\nNorth Africa, and the contiguous Americas). This fertile cen-\nter of endemism and diversity spawned most of our modern\nmarine and terrestrial organisms. It is within this retrospective\nthat some endemic corals in Brazil, found to belong to old\nrelict lineages known from fossil representatives in the Tethys\nSeaway, acquire a universal-legacy rank. More disclosures of\nsuch priceless living relics can also be expected in retracing a\nsecond center of diversity and endemism that arose (~100-50\nmillion years ago) in the New World tropics as the Atlantic\nOcean opened and as Africa and the southern continents\ncrashed northward into Eurasia. The eastern Tethyan species\nmigrated south and east, forming new centers of diversity in\nthe southwestern Indian Ocean and SoutheastAsia as recently\nas 20 million years ago. Understanding the dynamics of spe-\nciation and extinction across these ancient gateways--with\ntheir legacy biotas as well as their newly sprouted species--\nby using recently available genetic techniques is, according to\nReaka, one of the greatest challenges and opportunities of the\nThe concept of Pleistocene Parks or Phylogeographic\nSanctuaries (Avise, 2008) dovetails a visionary, cutting-edge\nscience with another contextually blended yet now spatially\nfragmented perspective synergistic with Reaka's.\nResearching and interpreting the spatial distribution of gene-\nalogical lineages, especially within and among closely\nrelated species--which is the essence of phylogeography, a\nbiological field he founded--Avise has discovered that many\nof these distinctive lineages began diverging from one\nanother in unglaciated biological refugia of the Pleistocene\nEpoch or earlier. The aggregate scientific and conservation\nimportance of these legacy biotas underpins his call for a\ncarefully designed network of phylogeographic reserves on\neach continent and in each marine region that could be\npromoted and distinguished in a similar fashion as historical\nlandmarks honoring important events in human affairs.\nComparative phylogeography is shedding a new light on\nthe origins of marine biodiversity. Across the world's tropical\noceans, the biodiversity hotspots (prominently the already\nmentionedEastIndiesCoralTriangle,aswellastheCaribbean)\nhave been widely recognized as evolutionary incubators of\nnew species and contrasted with endemism hotspots (such as\nHawaii and Red Sea). Phylogeographic studies are now shat-\ntering this distinction: Both biodiversity hotspots and ende-\nmism hotspots are important in producing novel evolutionary\nlineages and may work together to enhance biodiversity on the\nThe connectivity-enhanced appreciation and mutual rein-\nforcement of the natural knowledge banks will unfold along\npaths that stretch beyond national jurisdictions. This poses a\nunique challenge, underscored by the following excerpt from\nthe January 2010 report on New Frontiers in Science\nDiplomacy (Koppelman, Day, Davison, Elliott, & Wilsdon,\n2010), an international event hosted by the Royal Society of\nLondon in partnership with the AAAS:\nInternational spaces beyond national jurisdictions--including\nAntarctica, the high seas, the deep sea and outer space--cannot\nbe managed through conventional models of governance and\ndiplomacy, and will require flexible approaches to international\ncooperation, informed by scientific evidence and underpinned\nby practical scientific partnerships. (p. 18)\nI would add that these international spaces will also require\nnovel, internationally viable, and sustainable strategies of\nbasic research funding.\nBasic scientific research is largely the domain of govern-\nment funding; it does not involve capital market valuation. It\nhas been bypassed by the recent boom in science philan-\nthropy spearheaded by some of the richestAmericans (Broad,\n2014). The dependence on government funding can and\noften does become a major hindrance to the ambition and\nexecution of research visions, particularly in basic science\nprojects that transcend national borders.\nThe knowledge resource pool rooted in earth's evolution-\nary and ecological fabric is transnational. While knowledge\nderived from natural resources in a particular country should\nbe shared with and benefit that country, the knowledge yielded\nby research insights into transnational threads of earth's natu-\nral fabric ought to be treated as a global asset that benefits all\nof humanity. I conceived this position with a business model in\nmind and have made this model's refinement--and empower-\nment via science diplomacy--the centerpieces of my work on\nthe geography of wonder for some 20 years.\nBusiness Model With a Mission\nIn their pioneer assessment of the value of the world's eco-\nsystem services and natural capital, Costanza et al. (1997)\nmake the following point:\nIf ecosystem services were actually paid for, in terms of their\nvalue contribution to the global economy, the global price\nsystem would be very different from what it is today. The price\nof commodities using ecosystem services directly or indirectly\nwould be much greater. (p. 259)\nAn analogy can be drawn in the context of the global\nrepository of the knowledge mineral. The world over,\nhotspots for resort ventures and for investments in resort-\nstyled private retreats coincide with some of the most diverse,\nbiologically rich, and often intricately linked ecosystems that\nare yet to be revealed as treasure troves of currently undis-\ncovered knowledge. These exceptional locations are entering\nthe global market as merely premier real estate, grossly\nunderappreciated and undervalued as contributors to a\nknowledge economy. Both the host countries and the inves-\ntors bear the loss, which opens a unique opportunity for\nchanging the status quo on the premise of hard-nosed\neconomics.\nThe resort industry's enthusiasm for capitalizing on the\nwonder premium found in many of its information-dense set-\ntings to create experiences that engage the intellect is in its\ninfancy compared with the sophistication achieved in the\nconcept and delivery of hospitality and service. Entirely dor-\nmant, in business capitalization, are many of these settings'\nlinks to much larger realms of wonder.\nPeer-reviewed tourism and hospitality publications have\nbecome venues for a series of articles in which I first defined\nthis argument; suggested planning, design, and management\nphilosophies that would translate it into solutions; and demon-\nstrated the benefits on a pilot hotel portfolio I guided in Panama\nobjective, limned in my continued work on the subject, has\nbeen to bring science--and, through science, conservation--\ninto the heart of a business model in which product quality,\ncompetitiveness, and prestige grow along with the geographi-\ncal footprint of the underwritten research. Here is how.\nScience holds the key to unlocking the context of the\nresort's setting. One dimension of this context is the setting's\nconnection to a larger ecosystem. Moreover, science can\nreveal affinities (evolutionary, ecological, and other) that con-\nnect the destination's natural heritage resources with those\nfound in various parts of the destination's broader region and\nelsewhere in the world. Through such revelations, science can\nempower the resort to capitalize on its setting as a window into\na far-reaching labyrinth of wonder. The experience--live,\nuniquely meaningful, and uniquely immune to imitation by\nbeing offered from a vantage point inside this labyrinth--will\nbe profoundly different from experiences gained in a museum.\nA strategic alliance that would enable the resort to nourish this\nexperience with ongoing access to scientific exploration\nwould offer to reward patrons with first-class intellectual plea-\nsures and to continuously upgrade--with the help of exhibits,\nimages, and other tools--the novelty and educational value of\nthese delights through access to a flow of discoveries.\n8 SAGE Open\nThis business strategy generates robust incentives for an\ninfusion of investments--not donations--into research,\ntraining, development of scientific infrastructures (such as\nresearch stations), conservation-tailored employment, and\nother safeguards of the project's business performance across\nvast landscapes and seascapes--beyond the resort's property\nlines--where traditional models of economic development\nwould collide with the carrying capacities of these environ-\nments. This creates benefit zones that surpass, in scale and\ncapacity for sustainable development, existing approaches to\nlinking business models with destinations' conservation and\nsocial priorities. And this also opens new frontiers for the\nwork in economics that has explored the distinctive proper-\nties of knowledge as a public good.\nIn their influential articles, Nelson (1959) and Arrow\n(1962) reveal the limitations of private profit opportunities to\ndraw socially desirable quantity of resources into basic\nresearch--limitations fueled by the business value of monop-\noly over the funded research findings. Making the case for\nbasic scientific research as the prime source of significant\nadvances in knowledge, Nelson (1959) notes,\nOften the new knowledge is of greatest value as a key input of\nother research projects . . . For this reason scientists have long\nargued for free and wide communication of research results, and\nfor this reason natural \"laws\" and facts are not patentable. (p.\nAs Arrow (1962) explains, appreciating and capitalizing on\nknowledge as a precursor of future knowledge does not align\nwith the operation of private enterprise system and its empha-\nsis on property rights:\nTo appropriate information for use as a basis for further research\nis much more difficult than to appropriate it for use in producing\ncommodities; and the value of information for use in developing\nfurther information is much more conjectural than the value of\nits use in production and therefore much more likely to be\nI assert that the international resort enterprise is well posi-\ntioned and economically motivated to defy the free-enter-\nprise economics of basic research and to become the principal\nbusiness partner in science-oriented valuation and consolida-\ntion of the geographies-bridging knowledge-mineral veins.\nWorthy of emphasis is the fact that the extraction and appre-\nciation of the knowledge resource in the context of tourism,\nwhich is primarily an exercise in interpretation, does not\ninvolve the ownership of knowledge as intellectual property\nand, thus, is fully compatible with the underwritten scientific\ndiscoveries' sharing and conducive to their cross-fertiliza-\ntion--as seeds of new harvests of wonder--within multiple\nresearch endeavors. The more prominent and \"expansive\"\nwould the scale and scientific importance of a resort-engaged\nknowledge vein be, the greater would also be the business\nincentive to help value and protect large swaths of naturally\nprivileged areas across the world, without depriving the host\ncountries of their ownership and without denying conserva-\ntion-minded access to these areas by others. As a result, the\nreturns on investment would encompass a formidable\nlegacy.\nIt is the legacy reward that aligns the momentous trend of\necophilanthropic ventures with this immense opportunity\nwaiting to be tapped. Ecophilanthropy, which counts some of\nthe world's wealthiest individuals including high-profile cor-\nporate leaders and celebrities among its champions, involves\npurchases of natural areas to protect them or to restore their\necosystems. Increasingly, these land acquisitions or private\nconcessions, often of daunting scales, are introducing and\nunderwriting biological and ecological research programs\nwithin their boundaries. More and more frequently, they also\ninclude luxury hotel projects intended to both support and be\nsupported by these private natural reserves and are master-\nplanned to become vanguard models of environmental sensi-\nRush, 2005). One can observe a growing synergy and pro-\ngressively blurred line between these hotel-anchored\necophilanthropic ventures and the sustainability theme\nembracing trophy purchases of private islands and other\nexceptional properties in naturally prominent settings, such\nas the recent purchases of Lana'i by Oracle's Chief Larry\nEllison (Mooallem, 2014) and of Blackadore Caye off the\ncoast of Belize by the actor and environmental activist\nHowever, these laudable development models and their\nresearch missions do not recognize or capitalize on their\npotential to acquire an entirely enhanced spatial dimension\nand generate business and legacy premiums on the wings of\necological, evolutionary, and other affinities that tie the tour-\nism- and philanthropy-courting property with its larger eco-\nsystem and with natural legacies elsewhere in the world. The\npursuit of such contextual amplification--amplification that\nwould be mapped by science and achieved and enjoyed\nthrough interpretive tools--would not be conditioned on\npurchasing any additional real estate. It would be entirely\nexempt from the backlash that some of the large-scale\necophilanthropic acquisitions have encountered in the host\ncountries and local communities that become suspicious\nabout the motives behind them (Wolford, 2012). The contex-\ntually amplified properties would also be eminently primed\nfor partnerships of shared capacity to champion daring cross-\nnational science and conservation initiatives in a pragmati-\ncally effective and economically sustainable fashion. Such\njoined endeavors would empower each participating prop-\nerty to develop intellectual bounty nurtured by multiple won-\nder hotspots, prompting ever more ambitious research\nquestions and, with them, ever more intriguing insights into\nvarious global ecosystem networks that entail ever grander\nlegacy opportunities. They would be highly conducive to\ntreating the knowledge mobilized through transnational\nresearch of natural legacies as a global asset destined to\nbenefit all of humanity, because such an approach and its\nstewardship would further augment the stature of the partici-\npating estates and their owners.\nCentral to this perspective and strategy is the disclosure of\nthe unmatched potential of the resort enterprise to reap major\nbusiness dividends from investments in geographically unre-\nstrained, monopoly-free basic research endeavors and, in the\nprocess, to facilitate the transformative scale of the economic\nmodel that treats the knowledge-rich natural capital as a life-\nline of the global knowledge economy. The pursuit of this\npotential will in no way diminish the prospective benefits\nthat the knowledge exploited to enrich the rewards of world\ntravel may carry for the agricultural and fishing industries,\nfor education, as well as for other sectors of the destinations'\neconomies. No doubt, the discoveries brought to light along\nthe global paths of knowledge veins, through comparisons\nand correlations among multiple research sites and themes,\nwill generate unprecedented opportunities for investigating\nand employing natural substances to foster human well-\nbeing. Countries transected by these veins of discoveries will\ngain a strong standing as partners in potential wider exploita-\ntion of the unearthed knowledge by the medical (pharmaceu-\ntical) or other global industries.\nAvise (2008) commends this business-model-with-a-mis-\nsion for its capacity to promote science and protect biodiver-\nsity as an integral part of the business plan itself, yielding \"a\nglobal archipelago of interconnected `wonder sites' where\nthe scientific study and preservation of nature are the explicit\nand formal motivation for linking sustainable economics\nwith science\" (p. 11567). The road map for employing this\nbusiness model is embedded within a still larger ambition to\nawaken the extraordinary potential of the global crop of\nenvironmentally progressive resort and private estates col-\nlectively to provide an economic and logistical foundation\nfor building transnational knowledge economies that both\ndraw strength from and strengthen the world's premier natu-\nral heritage reserves. Integral to this ambition is to demon-\nstrate that blocks of natural heritage\u00adrich countries, shaped\nby tectonic activity, evolution, and other forces that have\nmolded the world's most opulent veins of the knowledge\nmineral, could shape this emerging knowledge economy as\nprofoundly as oil-rich countries have influenced the tradi-\ntional economy.\nI have embarked on the pursuit of this ambition backed by\nthe Pangea World organization I founded to serve as a cata-\nagain, the focal point.\nWealth Infrastructure Attuned to\nNature\nA formalized partnership between the UNESCO Office for\nthe Pacific States and Pangea World (ratified on October 9,\n2008) set the stage for the launch--at the West Coast\nHeadquarters of the National Academies on April 15,\n2009--of Pangea World's pilot transnational project\n(Brennan, 2009). Named The Pacific Bridge to Noble\nWealth, this project singles out the Pacific as a superb cross-\nroads of heritage themes of global significance. It seeks to\nbuild a knowledge supra structure that will release, harness,\nand value the collective reservoir of dormant scientific\nknowledge enclosed in the past and present connections,\ndynamics, and relationships that transcend the mega-diverse\nnatural heritage of the island-dotted tropical Pacific; that\nreach to and interface with islands and ecosystems of the\nPacific coast of the Americas; and that further augment this\ncollective natural reservoir of knowledge capital along the\nocean-linked biological networks of the larger Indo-Pacific\nregion. It offers a platform for combining the argument\nabout the economic value of ecosystem services with the\nargument about the economic potential of the veins of the\nknowledge mineral as repositories of the raw material for\nthe knowledge economy that double in market worth as\nsources of wonder for high-value experiences of the\nPacific's--and the world's--natural splendors.\nA core task behind the envisioned supra structure of\nknowledge is to engender a development model that con-\ntrasts with the conflict-ridden contests over the use of natural\nresources that plague many parts of the world and are often\ncompounded by competing views of what is desirable: eco-\nnomic development for immediate wealth creation versus\nconservation of resources for the benefit of future genera-\ntions. The PBNW multinational supra structure of knowl-\nedge veins is master-planned from its earliest conceptual\nstage on proactive guarantees of borderless social benefit,\neconomic energy, and political support.\nThe PBNW master plan invites the University of the\nSouth Pacific--an international teaching and research body\nowned by and spread across 12 Pacific Island countries--to\nbecome a prominent partner in the mapping and exploration\nof these countries' knowledge veins and, in the process, to\nfurther develop the university's research might and its capac-\nity to shape the region's future. The master plan also revives\nmy earlier proposal to UNESCO that they consider extend-\ning the World Heritage designation to heritage themes and\nrelationships of exceptional scientific and conservation\nimportance, anchored by networks of heritage assets that\nreveal them (H. Ayala, 2005). Even though they will initially\nradiate from and across the Pacific region, these relation-\nships are expected to disclose value-adding affinities among\nheritage sites on trans-regional and global scales.\nThis strategy in no way substitutes, compromises, inter-\nferes, or competes with national, regional, or global conser-\nvation efforts and laws, nor with the existing protection\nstatus of a heritage resource. In fact, quite the opposite will\noccur in terms of contributions toward the economic security\nof conservation. In the PBNW context, the delimitation of\nknowledge veins and their positioning as routes of wonder\nentails a financial mechanism that will systematically\nencourage the open-ended, geographically unrestrained sci-\nentific exploration that is beyond the reach of the conven-\ntional government-based research grants and beyond the\nfocus of the corporate funding of immediate profit-making\nideas. It entails a proactive layout of an investment network\nof staging areas, that is, sites selected because of their ideal\nlocations at the crossroads of future insights into multiple\nroutes of wonder and, to the maximum degree possible, also\nbecause of their overlay with properties that currently are or\nlikely will be promoted and traded as high-value real estate\nassets. This investment scenario enjoys a considerable\nmomentum because it is tailored to an investment trend that\nalready exists, namely, the rise--and vanishing line--\nbetween ecophilanthropic ventures, which are increasingly\ncombined with luxury hospitality projects, and purchases of\nprivate islands and other valuable natural properties for\nupscale ecoresort developments that increasingly support\ntheir image of exclusivity with sustainability initiatives. It\noffers to take the transformative influence of this unfolding\ninvestment trend to an entirely new level of benefit and pres-\ntige. This focus is pragmatic in that it treats the wealth that\ndefines the high-end market pool behind this trend as an\nopportunity to launch projects of the stature and power to\nmake environmental and social contributions of a magnitude\nthat will draw international attention and seed inspiration\nacross the world.\nEmbedded in the expansive supra structure of routes of\nwonder, the staging areas will endow the facilities they sup-\nport--be it private estates or resort operations--with the\ncapacity to pursue unprecedented ecophilanthropic aspira-\ntions and to appeal to the deep curiosity of people about the\nworld we live in, without sacrificing the traditional pleasures\nof present-day luxury resorts and private retreats. Individually\nand collectively, these facilities will have the capacity to set\nnew standards of excellence in experience management by\nprocessing and packaging the science-mediated revelation of\nwonder in a manner that generates economic energy, facili-\ntates new scientific breakthroughs, creates novel employment\nopportunities in resource conservation, and portrays invest-\nments in knowledge-weighted appreciation of natural capital\nas emblems of business stewardship. The wonder-route\nmatrix with its clusters of staging areas are especially devised\nto ensure that the science-mapped, interpretation-consoli-\ndated routes across ecologically sensitive ecosystems and\ninto economically depressed and remote rural areas do not\nsubject them to harmful visitor traffic while opening them to\nsocial and environmental benefits whose spectrum will be\noptimized in consultation with UNESCO Pacific. A key\nobjective and function of the staging areas is to encourage and\nfacilitate the setup of research stations and laboratories along\nthe routes of wonder, thus building and strengthening the host\ncountries' own capacity to utilize their knowledge mineral\nwhile producing a lasting economic incentive to protect the\nprime natural repositories of this resource. As a result, each\nroute of wonder, which will typically wind across multiple\ncountries, will become a potent catalyst of a \"cross-national\nunit of sustainable development.\"\nThis offer of robust appreciation of the staging-area\ninvestment in stature, market worth, and legacy rewards is\nguided by utmost selectivity: selectivity in terms of the mag-\nnitude of the environmental and social benefits that the\ninvestment will spur along the paths of contextual access\nexclusive to each staging area. This notion and execution of\nexclusivity is most inclusive in that it strengthens the natural\ntreasuries of the knowledge capital that belong to the host\nnations and, at the transnational level, to humanity. It offers\nto empower these nations to move from their current depen-\ndency on donations and foreign aid to true independence and\neconomic stewardship, fueled by high-quality investments\nthat both nurture and are nurtured by the region's collective\nheritage bounty.\nAccording to Pongi (2009), the approach shepherded by\nthe PBNW project\nintegrates UNESCO's goals into a broader aspiration to plant,\nacross the Pacific Island Region, a model sustainable economy\nthat derives strength from the spectacular scientific value of the\nregion's natural heritage. It seeks to employ Pangea's tool of the\n\"Hospitality-Science\" alliance as a strategic and investment\nframework for interlinking and accelerating the pursuits of the\nregion's development needs and conservation priorities.\nThis approach also stimulates a paradigm change of\nimmense promise for sustainable development: a change\nfrom the established practice of protecting natural assets by\nsetting them aside from the economy to bringing them into\nthe very heart of economic-development strategies in a man-\nner that guarantees their protection.\nThe implementation path is strongly grounded in science\ndiplomacy. A gathering of Pacific Island leaders titled\nEngaging With the Pacific was held in Fiji in July 2010. On\nJuly 23, this gathering hosted the regional unveiling of the\nPacific Bridge vision and strategy (Fiji's Ministry of\nInformation, 2010). The political support engendered by this\nunveiling gave birth to an important alliance. Speaking at an\ninternational event at the United Nations International School\nRatu Epeli Nailatikau (2010) confirms the announcement he\nmade at the Fiji gathering 2 months earlier:\nI accepted the invitation to become Chair of the initiative to\nextend The Pacific Bridge to Noble Wealth right across the\nentire region of the Pacific Island nations. The regional leaders\nat that meeting honored me with their support . . . I accepted this\nrole in the very strong belief that this initiative can transform our\nregion into an economic power house.\nKiribati's President Anote Tong added his endorsement:\nThe Pacific Bridge to Noble Wealth advocated under the Pangea\nWorld Project provides the economic rationale for protecting the\nnatural heritage of future generations and is an innovative\nconcept which offers options available at a time when climate\nchange has highlighted human abuse of this planet. (Embassy of\nLegacy Investments as Cradles of Earth-Nurturing\nEconomic Partnerships\nA symposium cohosted by the West Coast Headquarters of\nthe National Academies and UC Irvine on February 7, 2014,\nreinforced the academic credentials of the PBNW invest-\nment strategy and showcased the prospective multiplier of\nbenefits from just one staging area.\nThe event's agenda placed an emphasis on the mutually\nreinforcing relationship that intertwines Pangea World's leg-\nacy-investment business model and the science-guided sus-\ntainable-development strategy, and on this relationship's\nrelevance and expected contribution to sustainability\nscience.\nMichael Clegg, the Donald Bren Professor of Biological\nSciences at UC Irvine and foreign secretary of the U.S. National\nAcademy of Sciences, underscored the importance of the Pangea\nWorld concept as a model for sustainability. \"In order to improve\nthe quality of human life in the face of increasing demands on\nour earth's resources, we must develop scientific approaches to\nproblems of sustainability,\" Clegg said. \"Pangea World's vision\nembodies strategic synergies linking the creation and utilization\nof scientific knowledge to a business model firmly grounded in\nlegacy investment opportunities.\" (UC Irvine, 2014)\nEach legacy investment--and the resort or private legacy\nestate driving this investment--will engage and yield bene-\nfits across a transnational geographical unit that defies politi-\ncal borders. The symposium introduced Panama's Las Perlas\nArchipelago, off the country's Pacific coast, as a model set-\nting of immense biological, ecological, and geological inter-\nest and transnational connectivity--across the Central\nAmerican isthmus and the larger Pacific--as a laboratory of\nevolution. An investment in harnessing this setting's formi-\ndable capacity to offer science-fueled insights into a monu-\nmental ecosystem complex would acquire limitless potential\nto appreciate in stature and legacy rewards. It could help\ntransform from donations dependent to investment worthy\nsuch vital conservation projects as the Pacific-Asia\nBiodiversity Transect (PABITRA), which seeks to interlink\nthe naturally fragmented Pacific-wide biomes into a compre-\nhensive network for a regional approach to biodiversity\nresearch and conservation management. It could engender an\nunprecedented economic and conservation partnership\nbetween countries spanned by PABITRA and the Central\nAmerican nations linked via PABITRA's analog, the\nMesoamerican Biological Corridor, and stimulate an expan-\nsion of this novel sustainable-development alliance across\nother countries along the ocean-linked biological networks\nof the larger Indo-Pacific Region.\nIn many Pacific island nations--which are among the world's\ntop biodiversity hotspots threatened by climate change--the\nPangea World transnational model for the global knowledge\neconomy can offer a lifeline for their peoples' future. \"Pangea\nWorld's strategy of interlinking and valuing multiple pools of\nknowledge-rich natural capital with a legacy investment in the\nPanama islands can provide a new economic geography for the\nfuture benefit of our people,\" said Winston Thompson, Fiji's\nambassador to the United States. \"We remain strongly committed\nRedefining the Global Transformative Role of the\nPacific\nLeon Panetta, then the U.S. Secretary of Defense, stated in a\nspeech he delivered in Singapore in June 2012: \"While the\nU.S. will remain a global force for security and stability, we\nwill of necessity rebalance toward the Asia-Pacific region\"\nTrade Representative Michael Froman announced successful\nconclusion of the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations,\naimed at easing trading between the United States and 11\nother Pacific Rim nations--Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile,\nJapan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore,\nand Vietnam (Chappell, 2015). My assessment of the Pacific\nas a region of vital importance to the United States has a\ncomplementary but very different premise, focused on the\nisland-dotted ocean region circled by the Rim. This premise\nlinks this Pacific nation, whose world-class academic\nresources, business foresight, and investment power make it\nan icon of the existing definition of knowledge economy,\nwith a horizon line beyond which, hidden to the eye, lies a\nvast, priceless pool of knowledge-mineral veins upon which\nthe future of national, regional, and global economies will be\nfounded. It invites economically savvy science and conser-\nvation collaborations among nations, corporations, and insti-\ntutions not yet perceived as strategic partners in the current\nscenarios of international trade.\nTurning a Vision Into a Sustainability\nPartnership\nAccording to a United Nations press release, Pangea World's\nmultinational approach represents \"an unprecedented oppor-\ntunity to fortify a knowledge bank with incalculable value to\nstrengthen and sustain the emerging global knowledge econ-\nomy, one that could elevate the conservation of the planet's\nmost exquisite and vulnerable places into an economic imper-\native\" (United Nations Department of Public Information,\nIt became a foremost priority for me to endow this oppor-\ntunity with the propensity to grow in vigor and endurance as\nit materializes, starting in the Pacific context. It became an\nequally important priority for me to ensure that Pangea\nWorld's endeavor to assist, complement, and accelerate the\nexisting efforts of international government to protect and\nsustain common pool resources does and will perpetually\nadhere to the highest standards of ethics and integrity. The\nearlier mentioned symposium held at the West Coast\nHeadquarters of the National Academies and cohosted by\nUC Irvine on February 7, 2014, served as a catalyst for the\npursuit of these priorities.\nThe vision and transnational effort spearheaded by\nPangea World will, inevitably, continue evolving, because\nthey will follow and engage the advancing frontiers and\ncapabilities of scientific exploration across a dynamic\nworld. Their essential capacity for change is synergistic\nwith the imperative of excellence-nurturing creativity and\nreceptivity to new opportunities that defines top-caliber aca-\ndemic environments, embodied by UC Irvine and its sister\nUC campuses. It was on the premise of this synergy that I\nused the event's stage to announce formally my desire to\nbond the future of Pangea World's mission with the UC and\nto anchor its headquarters in the distinguished context of UC\nIrvine's academic preeminence--and that of its neighbor,\nthe National Academies' West Coast Headquarters--and in\nthe pledge of this mission's and headquarters' eventual pas-\nsage to this university.\nI have been honored by the reception that greeted my\ndesire and aspiration (Drake, 2014). The event \"revealed a\nnascent strategic partnership that could place UC Irvine at\nthe forefront of high-level science diplomacy for global sus-\ntainability\" (UC Irvine, 2014). It also underscored that the\ntime had come to appreciate--at national, regional, and\nglobal levels--the existing and planned protected areas as\nknowledge banks whose consolidation will unfold along\nvery different paths from those defining the expansions and\nmergers of their financial counterparts: paths paved by geo-\nlogical, evolutionary, and other forces that have molded the\nnatural capital across geographies.\nNovel designs of conservation networks that double in\nvalue and function as research networks are pivotal to this\nperspective. This is where California holds a great asset in\nthe UC Natural Reserve System--the world's largest uni-\nversity-administered network of protected areas (Fiedler,\nGee Rumsey, & Wong, 2013). Born from a visionary idea to\nencompass the spectacular ecological diversity of California\nin a network of undisturbed environments for research, edu-\ncation, and public service, this collection of reserves has\nbeen leveraged for such prominent research projects as the\nstudy of the effects of climate change on California ecosys-\ntems by the UC-wide Institute for the Study of Ecological\nand Evolutionary Climate Impacts. However, this asset is\nyet to be awakened in its value as a unique competitive edge\nand assurance of the sustainability of California's economic\nmight in this century of biology. Aiding this awakening\nwhile inviting the UC expertise into transnational laborato-\nries for heritage-nurtured knowledge economies is a pros-\npect I embrace.\nIt will be highly symbolic to navigate the geographies-\nbridging trajectory of the Pangea World journey from\nCalifornia: a Pacific state assembled, over the last 100 mil-\nlion years, via a series of seafloor eruptions and island arcs'\ncollisions, and linked through plate tectonics to various parts\nof the present-day Indo-Pacific (McPhee, 1993). This trans-\nPacific geological identity makes California a most fitting\nportal into the Pacific- and, eventually, the globe-spanning\neffort to release knowledge woven into the earth's evolution-\nary and ecological fabric as a source of wealth that could\nprofoundly augment the global strength and sustainability of\nthe knowledge economy, foster a culture of peace (Mayor,\n2014), and bolster conservation measures to mitigate rising\ntemperatures around the world.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nAguilar, E., & Saied, A.
