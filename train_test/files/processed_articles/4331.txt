From a phylogenic\nperspective, humans have evolved certain anatomical and physiological configurations which\nresult in cognitive attributes that influence learning (Gazzaniga, 2008). Our anatomical and\ncognitive structures equip us to make sense of the world beginning in the early stages of\ndevelopment (Gazzaniga, 2008). For example, \"na\u00efve theories,\" evident as early as infancy,\nwhich may have been selected for their usefulness in thinking and reasoning in natural\nenvironments, place constraints on learning in academic and informal educational settings.\nDevelopmentalists describe major milestones in learning as the process of overcoming the\nhow learners are endowed with \"intuitive biases\" or \"folk knowledge\" of biology, mathematics,\nphysics, and psychology. Geary argues that folk knowledge or na\u00efve theories form a basis for\nlearning and can facilitate some learning tasks, such as the acquisition of language. The learning\nKnowledge and acceptance\nof more complex concepts, such as those associated with mathematics or physics, may be\nhampered by the presence of folk knowledge or na\u00efve theories. These findings are leading to the\nemergence of a new discipline, \"evolutionary educational psychology\" (Carlson and Levin,\nEvolutionary educational psychology seeks to understand learning as an evolved ability.\nOne goal of this emerging discipline is to understand how the evolution of human cognition\ndifferentially impacts domains of study. Specifically, it is speculated that domains that build on\nthe fundamentals of our folk knowledge of psychology, biology, and physics are considered to be\nbiologically primary because interactions within these domains have been of fundamental\nimportance to survival (Geary, 2008). Applying this same line of reasoning, it is postulated that\ndomains stemming from cultural inventions such as reading, algebra, or Newtonian physics pose\ndifferent challenges for learning and motivation. Since these areas of study extend well beyond\nour evolved learning skill set they are considered to be biologically secondary.\nEvolutionary educational psychology seeks to understand the advantages of learning in\nthese domains, but also the challenges of overcoming cognitive biases associated with the\ncorresponding foundational folk knowledge. These biases may have developed to provide useful\nshorthand techniques for recognizing and categorizing objects and others in the environment, but\nwhen in contradiction with scientific knowledge in the disciplines, biases may lead to the\ndevelopment of misconceptions. For example, infants are very good at recognizing faces, but our\namazing ability to recognize faces may lead to a tendency to superimpose faces when they are\nnot there (such as the face many perceive as the \"man in moon\"). Thus, biologically primary\ncontent may be easy to learn but comes with \"baggage\" that makes overcoming the associated\npotential biases pedagogically challenging.\nAn understanding of the evolved nature of our learning skills and motivational\ndispositions in the context of different domains may be used to develop more effective\ninstruction. The application of evolutionary educational psychology in the context of domain\nknowledge can be illustrated by the following example. Children acquire oral language, a\nbiologically primary skill, with relative ease and therefore tend to require less formal instruction\nto learn to speak, whereas reading, a biologically secondary skill, tends to require systematic\nstructured instruction and sustained effort on the part of the learner to acquire proficiency. The\nrecognition of these domain differences and other aspects of learning that can be understood\nusing an evolution-based perspective supports the possible utility of evolutionary educational\npsychology.\nThe increasing reference to evolutionary psychology in cognition research and the\nassociated theory refinement raises the question of whether there is a cadre of researchers or\nuniversity instructors in education domains (what we call educational professionals) with\nsufficient comprehension and acceptance of biological evolution to adequately and objectively\nevaluate the merits and validity of this perspective. We contend that this requires experience with\nscientific research and a working knowledge of and openness to biological evolution. To our\nknowledge, educational professionals' levels of understanding and acceptance of biological\nevolution levels have never been documented.\nKnowledge and acceptance\nKnowledge and acceptance of evolution\nDevelopments in evolutionary educational psychology provide justification to examine\neducational professionals' preparedness to evaluate the merits and plausibility of this\nperspective. Despite the volumes of evidence supporting the scientific explanation of biological\nmaterials available to support teaching evolution (Alters and Alters, 2001; National Academy of\nSciences [NAS], 1999), research shows that the scientific understanding of biological evolution\ncontinues to remain elusive to many (Alters and Alters, 2001; Gallup, 2008). It is argued that\nevolution is complex and controversial, accounting for why it is either poorly taught or not\nHowever, studying biology in post-secondary education increases the opportunity to gain deeper\nunderstanding of evolution (Alters and Nelson, 2002; Lawson and Worsnop, 1992). This\nsuggests that the number of college level biology courses completed by an individual is a\npotential indicator of preparedness to evaluate the merits of evolution-based research.\nWorking knowledge of biological evolution requires the acceptance of natural selection\nand descent with modification as plausible scientific explanations for speciation and an\nunderstanding of the associated variables and processes (Alters and Alters, 2001; Gallup, 2008;\nRutledge and Warden, 1999). An accurate understanding of the processes that make up the\nstructure of evolutionary theory is required to effectively generate related models and hypotheses\n(Alters, 2004; McComas, 2006). We contend that more accurate conceptions of biological\nevolution enhance the capacity to comprehend and evaluate the plausibility of evolutionary\neducational psychology. Since advanced courses in biology or evolution are not required for a\nterminal degree in psychology, educational psychology, or most education fields, it is worth\nasking whether educational professionals are sufficiently prepared with knowledge of evolution\nto effectively understand or scientifically evaluate evolutionary educational psychology.\nMiller, Scott, and Okamoto (2006) report that the majority of individuals in the United\nStates do not believe in (accept) evolution, which is typically viewed as different from\nunderstanding evolution (Rutledge and Warden, 1999; Smith and Siegel, 2004; Southerland,\nSinatra, and Matthews, 2001). It has been argued that belief and knowledge are sufficiently\ndifferent constructs that both must be examined when considering individuals' perspectives on\nevolution (Shtulman, 2006; Southerland et al., 2001). Those that make this distinction posit that\nbelief is based on faith, whereas knowledge is acquired through observations, logical proof, or\nempirical evidence (Smith, 1994; Southerland et al., 2001). The distinction may be critical\nbecause as Palmquist and Finley (1997) report, professional scientists transitioning to careers in\neducation had difficulty distinguishing their beliefs from their knowledge. Research on\nacceptance and knowledge of evolution has revealed these constructs to be either associated\n(Nadelson and Southerland, under review; Rutledge and Mitchell, 2002) or independent (Bishop\nSoutherland, McConaughy, and Demastes, 2003). The variation in results from research supports\nthe need to investigate these two constructs with our population of interest.\nThe strong association between acceptance of evolution and belief systems makes\nindividual attitudes toward evolution resistant to change (Southerland and Sinatra, 2003). Over\nKnowledge and acceptance\nthe course of instruction, evolution acceptance is not anticipated to change to the same degree as\nevolution knowledge (Lawson and Worsnop, 1992). We argue that acceptance of evolution\nwould be predictive of an individual's motivation to engage in the objective evaluation of the\nmerits of evolutionary educational psychology. We contend that rejection of the theory of\nbiological evolution would impede an individual's willingness to give full consideration to this\nperspective. Individual consideration of whether to accept or reject evolutionary educational\npsychology requires willingness to objectively examine the idea as plausible, compelling, and\ncomprehensible (Dole and Sinatra, 1998).\nReligiosity and evolution\nDespite an abundance of evidence supporting the scientific explanation of biological\nevolution, the majority of individuals in the U.S. neither understands nor accepts the theory\nbelieve humans develop only with the influence of God. This reveals perhaps one of the\nstrongest indicators of evolution rejection, an individual's level of religious commitment, also\nsignificance of the relationship between acceptance and religiosity is made evident by the anti-\nevolution movements that have been motivated by individuals who hold strong religious beliefs\n(Alters and Alters, 2001; Scott, 2005). Although anti-evolution activities have been documented\nprimarily in the United States, recent reports indicate similar movements are occurring in Europe\n(Graebsch and Schiermeir, 2006) and in Australia (Sutherland, 2005). Lack of evolution\nacceptance and resistance to learning about the theory are often due to individuals' religious\nconvictions that may conflict with the scientific perspective on humans' phylogenetic\nrelationships to other organisms (Alters and Alters, 2001).\nThe acceptance or rejection of evolution based on religious perspectives is\npsychologically analogous to situations in which personal beliefs influence the decision to\nengage in the consideration of new evidence or perspectives (Kuhn, 1999). The influence and\napplication of personal conceptions or beliefs on decision making can impede the ability to\nreason scientifically (Tversky and Kahneman, 1982). Kuhn contends that individuals' inability to\nrecognize the influence of their personal beliefs on the evaluation of evidence and concepts\nconstrains their capacity for objective scientific reasoning. Biases against evolution may\ncontribute to the development and reinforcement of fallacies about the theory. The documented\nassociation between the rejection of the theory of evolution and levels of religiosity (Alters and\nAlters, 2002; Trani, 2004) suggests that the constructs interact to impede impartiality required\nfor objective evaluation. The documented influence of religious beliefs on the willingness to\nconsider evolution-based conjectures provides warrant for assessing levels of religiosity in our\npopulation of interest.\nEvaluating scientific research\nProfessional experience conducting and evaluating research enhances the domain-general\nabilities to analyze evidence, scrutinize research methodology, and judge logical arguments\nsupporting new perspectives (Schauble, 1996). The ability to apply scientific reasoning skills that\nKnowledge and acceptance\nare both domain-specific and domain-general is particularly important with evolutionary\neducational psychology which combines content domains, sources of evidence, research\nmethodologies, and logical arguments (Carlson and Levin, 2007).\nAssessing an individual's knowledge and capability to effectively and objectively weigh\nscientific evidence regarding evolution is a relatively complex process. There are, however,\nfactors which may serve as proxies for assessing domain-general scientific reasoning capacity.\nWe contend that experience judging evidence (Schunn and Anderson, 1999), conducting\nresearch (Kuhn, Amsel, and O'Loughlin, 1988) and evaluating research (Schoenfeld, 1985), are\nindicators of capacity for effective decision making.\nThe ability to evaluate scientific research requires expertise in analyzing and critiquing\nscientific evidence, hypotheses, and theories (Hogan and Maglienti, 2001; Kuhn et al., 1988;\nKuhn and Pearsall, 2000). Acquiring expertise in evaluating scientific research is a long term\nprocess of developing understanding of when and how to attend to critical variables, explain\neffects, interpret data, and test hypotheses systematically (Klahr and Simon, 1999; Schoenfeld,\n1985). This suggests that the development of the domain-general ability to effectively evaluate\nscientific research is influenced by exposure and opportunity to engage in and review scientific\ninvestigations. Therefore, it stands to reason that increases in educational professionals'\nacademic rank, highest held degree, institutional responsibility, experience with researching or\nteaching of science, and years of academic experience, would be accompanied by a\ncorresponding increase in the domain-general capacity to effectively evaluate scientific research.\nThis relationship provides justification for assessing professional academic histories and\ncharacteristics.\nScientific reasoning\nAdvances in science require experts to be informed and prepared to reason scientifically\nto accurately examine and critique new developments (Kuhn, 1970). Sadler and Zeidler (2004)\nreport greater domain-specific content knowledge results in higher quality reasoning abilities.\nThis suggests that scientific reasoning is domain-specific, with individuals' abilities to\nunderstand explanations and supporting evidence within a field constrained by their content\nknowledge. The domain specificity of scientific reasoning is supported by research suggesting\nindividuals can effectively evaluate evidence in some domains but not in others (Schoenfeld,\nWe argue that scientific reasoning is best viewed as a combination of domain-general\nreasoning ability resulting from engagement in the research enterprise (Kuhn et al., 1995;\nSchauble, 1996), and domain-specific abilities based on content knowledge (Hogan and\nMagleinti, 2001; Schoenfeld, 1985). Therefore, we posit that the ability to objectively evaluate\nthe merits of evolutionary educational psychology is dependent on individuals' domain-specific\nknowledge of the theory of evolution, and their domain-general professional scientific research\nand academic experiences.\nStudy objectives\nThe purpose of our study was to determine the propensity for a sample of members of\nKnowledge and acceptance\neducational professional organizations in the USA to engage in the objective consideration of the\nmerits or shortcomings of evolutionary educational psychology. Our research assessed\nparticipants' key personal characteristics, level of religious commitment, research and academic\nexperience, knowledge of evolution (specifically understanding of the process of biological\nchange through natural selection), and levels of acceptance of the theory of evolution. The\nmeasured data was used to form a structural model representing educational professionals'\npreparedness and willingness to objectively examine the validity and credibility of evolutionary\neducational psychology.\nThe questions guiding this investigation were:\n1. What are the levels of acceptance and knowledge of evolution held by this sample of\neducational professionals?\n2. What is the relationship among participants' knowledge of evolution, acceptance of\nevolution, and levels of religiosity?\n3. How do levels of acceptance and knowledge of evolution vary among the participants\nin relation to their academic rank, years of academic work, primary academic\nresponsibility, and highest held degree?\n4. Do academic experience, individual characteristics, evolution knowledge and\nacceptance relate to the willingness and ability to objectively consider the plausibility\nand coherence of evolution-based conjectures?\nMethods\nParticipants\nStudy participants were 337 educational professionals recruited through their\nmembership in Division 15 (Educational Psychology) of the American Psychological\nAssociation (APA), and Division C (Learning and Instruction) of the American Educational\nResearch Association (AERA). The membership of these two organizations is composed in large\npart of professors, doctoral level researchers, and other graduate students, with primary\nprofessional involvement in teaching or research in education or educational psychology. We\nanticipated the members of AERA Division C and APA Division 15 were to be most likely to\nencounter situations in which they would be evaluating the merits of evolutionary educational\npsychology; therefore, we limited our sampling to membership of these two Divisions.\nA total of 406 individuals completed the demographics survey, but only 337 completed\nall three of the study surveys. To maintain confidentiality we did not ask participants to identify\ntheir professional affiliation, therefore, we were not able to determine the proportion of the APA\nDivision 15 or AERA Division C membership that responded. However, our goal was not to\nachieve a representative sample of the population, but instead, to determine if there was a cadre\nof education professionals prepared to evaluate the plausibility of evolutionary educational\npsychology.\nData analysis was conducted on the 337 participants who completed all surveys and\nprovided us with full data sets. Of the 337 valid responses, approximately 60% were female and\nKnowledge and acceptance\n40% were male. The greater number of women than men in our sample was representative of the\ngender distribution found in the field of education (Organization for Economic and Co-operation\nand Development, 2004). Sixty-seven percent held either a Ph.D. or Ed.D. The majority of the\nparticipants' degrees were in education, psychology, or educational psychology. About 40% of\nour respondents indicated that research was their primary institutional activity, 30% indicated\nteaching, with the remaining 30% indicating administration, service to patients, and other\nactivities (such as graduate student or retired). Almost 45% were tenured or tenure track. Over\nhalf had either taken zero or one undergraduate biology course and 80% indicated having taken\nno graduate level biology courses. The average number of biology courses reported taken by the\nscience, science education, or science learning. The average age was 45.37 years (SD = 13.82).\nSee Table 1 for demographics by highest earned academic degree.\nTable 1. Demographics based on highest academic degree.\nHighest\nAcademic\nDegree\nn Sex Age\nYears of\nAcademic\nExperience\nCollege\nBiology\nCourses *\nExperience\nResearching or\nTeaching Science\nEducation\nM/F M(SD) M(SD) M(SD) Yes/No\n*Number of college level biology courses completed by the participants\nMaterials and Procedures\nThe leadership of both APA Division 15 and AERA Division C distributed an e-mail to\nthe organizations' list-serves requesting members' participation in our study. The letter detailed\nthe intent of our investigation and provided a link to a web page that contained instructions for\nparticipation, a link to our consent form, and links to our study measures.\nAll surveys were administered and data collected through Zoomerang, an internet based\nsecure survey web site. Participation was anonymous. Those who did participate were asked to\nprovide the same last five digits of any phone number for each measure which we used as a\nunique code in our data analysis to track individual responses to our three study measures.\nParticipants were requested to consent to partake in the study and then complete our\nKnowledge and acceptance\ndemographics survey and two study instruments. We used a series of web pages to guide\nparticipants through the completion of the surveys, starting with the informed consent, followed\nby demographics, which included our religious beliefs questions.\nOur demographics survey was used to gather personal characteristics data, including\ngender, ethnicity, highest academic degree, academic rank, and years of academic experience\nand educational background. We also included items that asked participants to rate their\nfamiliarity with the theory of evolution (a measure of participants' perceptions of their general\nevolution knowledge), level of religious commitment (a measure of religiosity), personal\nperceptions of the importance of religion (a measure of religiosity), and perceived level of\nconflict between their individual religious views and personal acceptance of evolution (a\nmeasure of evolution acceptance) an item similar to one used by Evans and colleagues (2007).\nThe participants were asked to respond to these four items using a five point Likert scale, with 1\nindicating the lowest degree to which the statement was true and 5 the highest degree in which\nthe statement was true. See Table 2 for the average responses to these items.\nOnce the participants completed our demographics survey, they were directed to the\nMeasure of Acceptance of the Theory of Evolution (MATE) (Rutledge and Warden, 1999). This\n20-item evolution acceptance questionnaire is scored from 20-100 possible points, with 20 being\nthe lowest level of acceptance and 100 being the highest level of acceptance. The MATE uses\nitems such as, \"The theory of evolution is incapable of being scientifically tested,\" and five point\nLikert scale with responses ranging from \"Strongly Agree\" to \"Strongly Disagree.\" In the\ninstrument validation study of participating high school teachers, the reliability of the instrument\nwas determined to be 0.98. The high level of internal reliability reported from previous studies,\nthe construct validation confirmed with high school biology teachers, and the instrument's\nmeasure of evolution acceptance, suggest that the MATE was appropriate for use in our study.\nThe corresponding scores and categories for acceptance are; 89-100, Very High Acceptance; 77-\nFollowing the completion of the MATE instrument, the participants were directed to the\nConceptual Inventory of Natural Selection (CINS) (Anderson, Fisher, and Norman, 2002). The\n20 item CINS instrument uses scenarios and corresponding selected response items to assess\nknowledge of natural selection, which is a fundamental concept of the theory of evolution\n(Gould, 2002; Miller, 1999). There are multiple processes guiding evolution, however, natural\nselection is an essential and dominant mechanism. The salience of natural selection to the\nunderstanding of evolution provided justification for inferring our participants' general\nknowledge of evolution based on their CINS scores. Further, there is a dearth of extant\ninstruments available to assess general knowledge of evolution. Therefore, we used the CINS, an\ninstrument with established reliability and validity, to assess our participants' knowledge of\nnatural selection and infer their general knowledge of evolution from these scores.\nIn the development of their instrument, Anderson et al. (2002) assessed undergraduate\nstudents targeting a level of difficulty of 50%, and achieved a level of 46.4% correct. This\nindicates that individuals with a science background similar to that of an undergraduate would be\nexpected to answer about 50% of the questions on the CINS correctly. In their description of the\nKnowledge and acceptance\nCINS instrument Anderson and colleagues reported sufficient construct validity and adequate\nlevels of reliability (KR20\n= .64). The validation with undergraduates with limited biology\nknowledge, the demonstration of instrument internal reliability, and the assessment of knowledge\nof natural selection supports the use of the CINS as an appropriate assessment of participants'\nknowledge of evolution. Once the CINS was completed the participants were directed to a web\npage which thanked them for their participation and again provided them with our contact\ninformation.\nResults\nInstrument reliability\nWe began our analyses with a determination of the reliability of the MATE and the\nCINS. Our analysis of the MATE began with recoding the reverse coded items. Maintaining the\nfive point Likert scale, the SPSS based internal reliability analysis produced a Cronbach's alpha\nvalue of .96, indicating a high level of instrument reliability.\nThe CINS responses where recoded to dichotomous values of 0 for incorrect and 1 for\ncorrect. Although it is appropriate to apply the Kuder-Richardson-20 test of reliability for\ndichotomous data, the outcome and process used in SPSS for the calculation of the KR-20 and\nCronbach's alpha resulted in the same values. The Cronbach's alpha reliability analysis of the\nCINS using SPSS resulted in a value of .86, indicating that for our application the instrument\nwas revealed to have a high degree of internal reliability.\nReligiosity views\nOur participants responded to the question regarding their level of religious commitment\nwith a mean of 2.66 (SD = 1.35) which would fall between \"minimally religious\" and \"somewhat\nreligious\" on our Likert scale (see Table 2). Approximately 49% of participants responded as\n\"not religious\" or \"minimally religious,\" 21% responded as \"somewhat religious,\" and 31%\nresponded with \"religious\" or \"very religious\". It is interesting to note that the participants were\nnearly equally distributed on the five point scale, which indicates that our sample includes\nindividuals with a broad range of religious commitment. In an effort to provide a context for\ninterpreting our participants' level of religiosity and to establish a reference for future analysis,\nwe made an attempt to compare the religiosity of our sample to outcomes from Gallup (2008)\nand other reports of various behavior measures associated with religious commitment of the\ngeneral public (e.g. church attendance). However, we could not locate any data that were similar\nenough to allow for a direct comparison of the religious commitment of our sample and the\ngeneral public.\nKnowledge and acceptance\nTable 2. Means and standard deviations for the Measures of Religiosity, and the Knowledge of\nEvolution and Acceptance of Evolution scales (n = 337).\nMeasure M SD\nThe distribution of participants' responses to our question regarding personal importance\nof religion was very similar to our item assessing perceived religious commitment. The average\nof 2.95 (SD = 1.47) placed our participants very near \"somewhat important\" for our measure of\nthe personal importance of religion (see Table 2). The similarity in responses to our importance\nof religion item and the previous item examining religious commitment provided evidence of\nconsistency in our measures of religiosity. The correlation between religious commitment and\nimportance of religion was r(337) = .90, p < .01. This indicated there was a high level of shared\nvariance between these two items. The high level of correlation between these items provided\njustification for combining the two measures to form a single composite variable representing of\nour participants' levels of religiosity.\nAcceptance and knowledge\nWe began our main analyses of interest by examining our first research question: What\nare the levels of acceptance and knowledge of evolution held by this sample of educational\nprofessionals? The MATE measure of evolution acceptance uses a scale of 20 (representing no\nacceptance) to 100 (representing full acceptance). Over 75% of our participants scored in the 80\nto 100 range on the MATE. This indicates that the majority of our participants rated their level of\nacceptance of the theory of evolution as High to Very High acceptance (Rutledge, 1996). The\np < .01] than the levels of acceptance of a previous study that examined the acceptance of\nevolution of 552 high school biology teachers in which Rutledge and Warden (2000) reported a\nmean of 77.59 (SD = 4.26) on the same scale. This indicates that participants in our sample had\nsignificantly higher levels of acceptance of the theory of evolution than the biology teachers\nassessed in a prior study. This was intriguing since our participants reported taking about half the\nnumber of college level biology courses on average (M = 5.26, Mdn = 4.0 SD = 4.79) than\nrecommended for biology teacher certification (National Science Teacher Association, 1992).\nSee Table 2 for the means and standards deviations of the MATE.\nKnowledge and acceptance\nTo further assess acceptance of evolution we examined the response to our single item\nwhich asked participants to rate the compatibility between their religious beliefs and evolution.\nApproximately 78% of our sample indicated \"compatible\" or \"very compatible\" with a mean of\n3.97 (SD = 1.15) placing them near \"compatible\" on our Likert scale. In comparison, a Gallup\n(2008) survey of the U.S. public with regard to their perspectives of evolution, creation and\nreligion, reported that about 35% of the U.S. public expressed personal views in the context of\nevolution indicating they perceived that science and religion conflict with each other. It is\nimportant to note that the wording of the questions can result in shifts in the percentages of\nacceptance responses. Overall, the polls reflect relatively little change in acceptance over the past\n40 years. This indicates that a greater proportion of our study participants perceive no conflict\nbetween science and religion than one would expect to find in the general public. This is a\nnotable finding as it indicates a higher degree of comfort level with evolution and personal\nbeliefs than we would most likely detect in the general public. Again, comparing the perspectives\nof our participants and the general public is important to establishing a frame of reference for the\noutcome on our measure of compatibility.\nWe conducted a correlation analysis to determine the consistency of the acceptance of\nevolution outcomes from the MATE and our item asking participants' to rate the level of\ncompatibility between evolution and their religious beliefs. The results revealed the MATE was\npositively correlated with our measure of compatibility of religious views and the scientific view\nof evolution, r(337) = .49, p < .01. This indicated that these two measures had some consistency.\nHowever, over 75% of the shared variance remained unaccounted for, indicating that our\nmeasures also assessed some unique aspects of evolution acceptance.\nAnalysis of the CINS, our measure of evolution knowledge (inferred from knowledge of\nnatural selection), revealed that approximately 65% answered correctly on 75% or more of the\nquestions. Anderson et al. (2002) reported that the CINS instrument was designed to have a 50%\ncorrect targeted level of difficulty, and achieved a 46.4% correct with a large sample of\nundergraduates. In comparison our sample had a mean of 77.05% correct (SD = 21.25%), which\nwas greater than the expected 50% targeted level of difficulty. This indicates that the majority of\nour participants scored above the average expected levels of understanding of natural selection\n(our measure of knowledge of evolutionary processes) for this instrument. See Table 2 for the\nmeans and standards deviations of the CINS.\nTo extend our assessment of evolution knowledge we examined the responses to our\nsingle item which asked participants to rate their familiarity with the theory of evolution. The\nparticipants self-reported a perceived average level of familiarity with evolution of 3.62 (SD =\n.91) which fell between \"somewhat familiar\" and \"familiar\" on our Likert scale. All 337 of our\nparticipants rated their familiarity at or above \"minimally familiar\" with 32% responding at\n\"somewhat familiar,\" 38% at \"familiar,\" and about 18% at \"very familiar.\" We were unable to\nlocate any appropriately similar studies that we could justify using for comparison to the general\npopulation, but our awareness of research on levels of evolution knowledge suggests our\nparticipants considered themselves more familiar with evolution than the general public would\nTo determine the extent of the relationship between our two measures of evolution\nKnowledge and acceptance\nknowledge, we conducted a correlational analysis between the CINS and our single item\nassessing familiarity with evolution. The results revealed the CINS was positively correlated\nwith our measure of evolution familiarity, r(337) = .27, p < .01. This indicated that these two\nmeasures had some level of consistency. However, over 92% of the shared variance remained\nunaccounted for indicating that these two measures were likely assessing nearly independent\naspects of evolution knowledge.\nRelationship between acceptance, knowledge and religiosity\nOur second research question asked: What is the relationship among participants'\nknowledge of evolution, acceptance of evolution, and levels of religiosity? We examined the\ncorrelations among participants' ages, years of academic experience, the religiosity composite,\nMATE scores, the measure of compatibility of personal beliefs and evolution, the measure of\nperceived familiarity of evolution, CINS scores, number of biology courses as variables, and\nexperience with research or teaching of science (see Table 3 for the correlation matrix). The\nresults revealed acceptance scores on the MATE to be significantly correlated with knowledge of\nevolution (as measured by the CINS), r(337) = .38, p < .01. The MATE scores were also found\nto be significantly correlated with perceived evolution familiarity, r(337) = .28, p < .01. Further,\nthe CINS was found to be positively significantly correlated with evolution compatible views,\nr(337) = .35, p < .01. This indicated that as evolution acceptance increased there was a\ncorresponding increase in evolution knowledge, which is a relationship that has been\ninconsistently detected in prior research on the association within populations of undergraduate\nand graduate college students (Bishop and Anderson, 1990: Demastes et al., 1995; Lawson and\nWorsnop, 1992; Nadelson and Southerland, under review; Rutledge and Mitchell, 2002; Sinatra\nConsistent with other research in this area (Gallup, 2008; Trani, 2004), we found\nreligiosity to be significantly inversely correlated with acceptance of evolution (MATE scores),\nr(337) = -.45, p < .01, and inversely correlated with compatibility of beliefs and evolution,\nr(337) = -.12, p < .05, such that higher levels of reported religiosity were associated with lower\nlevels of reported acceptance and of evolution compatible views. In addition, religiosity was also\nfound to be significantly and negatively correlated with the CINS, r(337) = -.13, p < .05. It is\ninteresting to note that we failed to detect a correlation between religiosity and participants'\nperception of their familiarity with evolution. Our results show that as religious commitment\nincreases there were significant decreases in both evolution acceptance and knowledge. This\ncorresponds with the interpretation of Gallup poll results (2008) which report that understanding\nof evolution, acceptance, and level of religious commitment are related in the same directions as\nfound in this study.\nKnowledge and acceptance\nTable 3.

Experience teaching or\nresearching science\n--\nVariations with academic experience\nOur third research question asked: How do levels of acceptance and knowledge of\nevolution vary among the participants in relation to their academic rank, years of academic\nwork, primary academic responsibility, and highest held degree?\nAcademic rank. We conducted an ANOVA to explore differences among the measures\nwith respect to academic rank. Levels of academic rank were used as the grouping factor and\nacceptance of evolution, knowledge of evolution, level of religiosity, and experience with\nresearch or teaching of science served as dependent measures. The results revealed significant\ndifferences in the acceptance of evolution (MATE) depending on academic rank, F(5,331) =\n5.97, p < .01. Post hoc analysis revealed that Instructors had significantly lower levels of\nacceptance than Lecturers (p < .05), Assistant Professors (p < .05), Associate Professors (p <\n.05), and Full Professors (p < .01). Further analysis of the pairwise comparisons revealed that\nGraduate Students had significantly lower levels of acceptance of evolution than Assistant\nProfessors (p < .05) and, Full Professors (p < .01). All other post hoc comparisons were not\nsignificant.\nKnowledge and acceptance\nWe then conducted an ANOVA to determine if compatibility of religious beliefs with\nevolution differed by levels of academic rank. This result was significant F(5,331) = 3.19, p <\n.01. The post hoc analysis identified Instructors as reporting significantly lower levels of\ncompatibility than Full Professors (p < .05). All other post hoc comparisons were not significant.\nKnowledge of evolution (as measured by the CINS), familiarity of evolution, experience\nwith researching or teaching science, and levels of religiosity were not found to vary by\nacademic rank. The means and standard deviations for acceptance, knowledge, religiosity,\ncompatible beliefs, and engagement in science research and teaching by academic rank are\npresented in Table 4.\nTable 4.

To determine if measures of acceptance, knowledge, religiosity,\nand experience with research or teaching science were related to highest degree obtained, we\nconducted an ANOVA using the highest degree obtained as the grouping factor. The results of\nthis analysis revealed that levels of acceptance of evolution (MATE) varied with respect to the\nrevealed those holding a Ph.D. had significantly higher levels of acceptance than those holding a\nM.A. (p < .01) or an M.Ed. degree (p < .01). The ANOVA also revealed significant differences\nin levels of compatibility of religious beliefs with evolution by highest degree earned, F(5,331) =\n2.46, p < .05. Post hoc analysis revealed a significant difference between M.Ed. and Ph.D.\nparticipants (p < .05). The nature of this difference was that those holding a Ph.D. had higher\nlevels of compatibility than the M.Ed. participants. The ANOVA examining evolution\nknowledge (as measured by the CINS) by highest degree obtained was revealed to be significant,\nKnowledge and acceptance\nF(5,331) = 3.85, p < .01. The post hoc analysis indicated that those holding a Ph.D. showed\nsignificantly higher understanding scores than those holding M.A. degrees (p < .01). It is\ninteresting to note that the ANOVA examining perceptions of evolution familiarity, failed to\nreach significance. This further confirmed our analysis that the CINS and evolution familiarly\nwere assessing different aspects of our participants' evolution knowledge.\nWe detected no significant differences for religiosity or experience with researching or\nteaching science across degree groups. This led us to conclude that these measures were not\ndifferentially distributed within the degree groups. The means and standard deviations for the\nexamined measures are presented in Table 5.\nTable 5.

We conducted a correlational analysis between age and years of\nacademic experience and found a significant relationship, r(337) = .84, p < .01. This strong\npositive correlation suggested that analysis conducted using both age and years of experience as\nindependent variables would result in redundant outcomes. Furthermore, years of academic\nexperience was our construct of interest. Therefore, we did not use age but only used years of\nacademic experience in our subsequent analysis. See Table 3 for all correlational outcomes.\nWe conducted a correlational analysis to determine if years of academic experience were\nsignificantly related to acceptance of evolution, knowledge of evolution, experience with\nresearching or teaching science, and religiosity. Our results indicate that years of experience was\nsignificantly correlated with acceptance of evolution (MATE) r(337) = .14, p < .05. Years of\nexperience was also found to be significantly correlated with compatibility of faith and\nevolution, r(337) = .12, p < .05. Our correlational analysis failed to detect significant\nKnowledge and acceptance\nrelationships between years of experience and understanding of evolution (as measured by the\nCINS), perceived familiarity of evolution, experience with researching or teaching science, or\nlevels of religiosity.\nThis indicates that years of academic experience is not a predictor of evolution\nknowledge or religious commitment, but as years of experience increased there was an increase\nin the acceptance of evolution. This was consistent with our argument that an individual's years\nof academic experience is linked to the development of domain-general scientific reasoning\nabilities which increases their capacity to objectively consider the plausibility of evolution.\nCollege level biology courses. The number of college level biology courses was found to\nbe significantly correlated with understanding of evolution (CINS), r(337) = .16, p < .01, and\nfamiliarity, r(337) = .41, p < .01. This indicates that as the number of biology courses increased\nevolution knowledge also increased. The number of college level biology courses was also found\nto be significantly correlated with experience with research or teaching science, r(337) = .21, p <\n.01, which indicated that as the number of biology courses increased so did experience with\nresearching or teaching science. However, the number of college level courses was not found to\nbe significantly correlated with acceptance (MATE) or with our measure of compatibility leading\nus to conclude that study in biology does not necessarily lead to increased levels of evolution\nacceptance. No correlational relationship was detected between the number of college level\nscience courses and religiosity.\nInstitutional responsibility. We conducted an ANOVA using primary institutional\nresponsibility as the grouping factor and our two measures of evolution acceptance, two\nmeasures of evolution knowledge, experience with researching or teaching of science, and\nreligiosity as dependent variables. Our analysis revealed significant differences in MATE scores,\nF(4,332) = 4.20, p < .01, but no significant difference was found for evolution compatible views.\nA significant difference between institutional responsibility groups was found for CINS scores,\nF(4,332) = 2.53, p < .05, but no difference was detected for our perceived familiarity with\nevolution item. Post hoc analysis showed that those whose primary professional responsibility\nwas providing service to clients or patients held significantly lower MATE scores than\nparticipants who indicated that their primary responsibility was research (p < .01), teaching (p <\n.01), or other (retired, educational assessment, etc.) (p < .01). Our post hoc analysis revealed that\nthose whose primary activity was service to clients or patients had significantly lower CINS\nscores than participants who indicated that their primary responsibility was research (p < .05).\nWe did not detect any relationships between primary institutional responsibility and religiosity or\nexperience with research or teaching science. See Table 6 for the means and standard deviations\nfor the measures presented by primary institutional responsibility.\nKnowledge and acceptance\nTable 6.

As discussed previously, we\nhypothesized that there would be a significant interaction between knowledge of evolution,\nacademic and research experience, and acceptance of evolution on the ability to objectively\nconsider the merits of evolutionary educational psychology. We set out to determine if it was\npossible to model the relationships between these variables in a manner that would be indicative\nof the interplay of the measures associated with the objective consideration of the plausibility\nand applicability of the proposed evolutionary educational psychology. The three latent variables\nfrom our model are presented with the corresponding measured variables in Table 7.\nKnowledge and acceptance\nTable 7.

Research or Teaching Science\nThe measurement model\nThe analysis to confirm our proposed model began with a test of our measurement model,\nfollowed by a test of our full structural model. We tested all models using EQS 6.2 structural\nequation software (Bentler, 1995), and consulted Byrne (2006) for confirmation of our outcome\ninterpretation.\nIn our measurement model we tested three factors; experience with academic research,\nknowledge of evolution, and willingness and ability to engage in the consideration of the\nplausibility and merits of evolution-based conjectures. To test our measurement model, we\nlimited most of the model measures to a single factor, with two exceptions. Both the measure of\nevolution knowledge (CINS) and the measure of research engagement were linked to our\nknowledge factor and willingness factor. We fixed the residuals to be uncorrelated, placed no\nconstraints on the loadings, and allowed the factor covariances to be freely estimated.\nWe used both the fit indices and the factor correlations as empirical indicators for\njustification in the formation of a hypothesized model. Goodness-of-fit indices indicated a decent\nAGFI = .94, Standardized RMS = .05, RMSEA = .06, and the 90% Confidence Interval of the\nRMSEA between .04 and .08. See Figure 1 for correlations and measurement model structure.\nKnowledge and acceptance\nFigure 1.

The Knowledge\nof Evolution and Experience latent variables are independent and the Acceptance of Evolution latent variable is\ndependent.\nAn assessment of the fit indices indicated that the three factor inclusion was justified in\nKnowledge and acceptance\nour model. Further, the resulting correlations, presented in Table 8 revealed a reasonable level of\ncorrelation between capacity to engage in the objective consideration of evolution developments\nbased on factors for acceptance, academic experience, and knowledge of evolution. This led us\nto presume that there were acceptable levels of consistency in the measures, and no obvious\noccurrences of collinearity of measurement. The correlation of r = .01 between our academic\nexperience and knowledge of evolution latent variables (see Table 8) indicates that these\nvariables are measures of different constructs that are responded to with different consistencies.\nYet, the considerably higher correlations between our experience variable and acceptance\nvariable (hypothesized to be a predictor of the likelihood of engaging in the consideration of\nevolutionary developments) and our knowledge and acceptance variables (r = .29 and r = .34\nrespectively), provides justification for the use of knowledge and experience as predictors of\nacceptance in our proposed model.\nTable 8. The correlations among the three study latent variables.\nKnowledge Acceptance Experience\nKnowledge\nof Evolution\n--\nAcceptance\nof Evolution\nExperience in\nAcademics\nA proposed model\nBased on the outcome of the measurement model, the content analysis of the factors, and\nthe literature, we maintain that the ability to objectively engage in scientific thinking is a\ncomplex interaction of variables. Our analysis indicated a significant correlation between our\nthree factors; knowledge of evolution, academic experience, and capacity to objectively consider\nthe plausibility and merits of evolution-based developments. This provided empirical support for\nour position that educational professionals' capability to objectively judge the merits of, and\nevidence for, an evolutionary perspective of educational psychology is dependent on several\nfactors. Thus, we relied upon both theoretical and empirical support in the development of our\nmodel.\nTaking these factors into consideration, we proposed and tested the following model\nrepresenting the influence of knowledge of evolution and academic experience on the ability to\nengage in the objective consideration of the plausibility and merits of evolution-based\ndevelopments (see Figure 2). We developed this model based on the notion that both domain-\ngeneral reasoning abilities and domain-specific knowledge influence the ability to engage in\nunbiased examination and interpretation of evidence. In our proposed model, the objective\nconsideration of the plausibility of evolution-based developments is directly influenced by\nKnowledge and acceptance\nknowledge of evolution (domain-specific knowledge) and academic experience (domain-general\nreasoning abilities). Our model reflects the notion that the domain-specific and domain-general\nvariables that we measured can be used directly and indirectly to predict educational\nprofessionals' ability to engage in the unbiased evaluation of evolution-based developments. We\nposit the ability to engage in unbiased evaluation of evolution-based developments predicts the\npropensity for the objective consideration of the merits of evolutionary educational psychology.\nFigure 2.

The results\nrevealed that most fit statistics were near the suggested threshold values suggested by Byrne\n.94, Standardized RMS = .05, RMSEA = .05, and the 90% confidence interval of the RMSEA\nLevels of acceptance are critical to objective evaluation of the merits of a proposed\nhypothesis (Kuhn, 1970). In our model, we represented willingness to engage in the\nconsideration of the merits of evolution-based conjectures as measured by evolution acceptance,\nknowledge, and religiosity. We combined the influences of domain-specific knowledge of\nevolution and domain-general experience with research to forecast willingness to engage in the\nevaluation of evolution-based developments. Applied to our research this suggests that levels of\nunderstanding of evolution and academic experience predicts the likelihood that an individual is\nprepared to objectively evaluate the merits of evolutionary educational psychology.\nThe analysis of our model confirmed the direct influence of acceptance of evolution,\nreligiosity, knowledge of evolution, and experience with researching and teaching science, on the\nwillingness and capacity to engage in evaluating evolution-based developments. We also\nconfirmed the indirect influence of academic experience measures and additional knowledge of\nevolution measures. This supports our posited relationship between measures of domain-specific\nevolution knowledge, domain-general research experience, and measures of acceptance of\nevolution as key indicators of the willingness and capacity to engage in unbiased evaluation of\nevolutionary educational psychology research and hypotheses.\nDiscussion\nEvolutionary educational psychology (Carlson and Levin, 2007) is a new and emerging\nsub-discipline within the field of educational research. Our interest and experience researching\nstudents' and teachers' knowledge and acceptance of evolutionary biology led us to question\nwhether there was a cadre of educational researchers and other post secondary education\nprofessionals who were prepared to interpret, utilize, and evaluate the merits of this new\nperspective. To our knowledge, no other study has examined levels of knowledge and acceptance\nof biological evolution within a select sample of the community of educational psychologists,\neducational researchers, and other education professionals who teach and mentor the next\ngeneration of educators and educational researchers.\nOur results suggest that there is an informed, sizable subgroup (recall our sample size\nwas well over 300 individuals) of educational professionals that exhibit preparedness to evaluate\nthis new view of learning and cognition. In interpreting these findings, is important to note that\nour participants do not constitute a random or a representative sample of the populations of all\neducational psychologists, educational research, or education professionals. Although efforts\nwere made to recruit as many participants as possible from the population of educational\nprofessionals, only those who had the time and interest in participating completed our surveys.\nThis process of self selection for participation means we cannot generalize from this sample to\nmake any claims characterizing the population of all educational psychologists and other\nKnowledge and acceptance\neducation professionals. However, it is important to note that accurately describing the\npopulation of professional educators as a whole, while a worthwhile endeavor, was not our\nobjective. Rather we sought to determine if there was a sufficient base of individuals within the\neducational professional community to effectively evaluate evolutionary theory's relevance to\neducational psychology. This base of individuals does not have to be representative of the\nmembers of our discipline any more than determining whether there is a cadre of biologists\nprepared to conduct taxonomic analyses of certain microbial extremophiles. As with our study, it\nwould be reasonable to determine if there were professionals within the population of biological\nscientists with the potential to accurately classify these unique organisms. Our results suggest\nthat there is an informed group among those in the profession who likely can evaluate\nevolutionary educational psychology.\nAnother limitation of our study was that although we achieved a high level of reliability\nwith both of our instruments, they are self-report measures. Due to our desire to limit the scope\nof the surveys, minimize the time required to complete them, and maximize the completion rate,\nwe chose not to collect qualitative data that may have provided additional insight into the\nperspectives held by the participants. This is an excellent direction for future research.\nAn additional instrument related limitation of our study is the reliance on the CINS\n(Anderson et al., 2002) as a measure of general knowledge of evolution. We recognize the CINS\nis constrained to assessing knowledge of natural selection, albeit from a broad perspective.\nHowever, given the limitation of extent instruments to assess comprehensive knowledge of\nevolution, and the centrality of natural selection to broader themes in evolution, we chose the\nCINS for its clear utility for examining our research questions. The development of an\ninstrument that assesses comprehensive evolution knowledge is an excellent focus for future\nresearch.\nOur findings indicate that the relationships among understanding and acceptance of\nbiological evolution and experience with research and scientific reasoning may impact the ability\nof educational professionals to objectively evaluate the merits and evidence supporting\neducational evolutionary psychology (Hogan and Maglienti, 2001; Kuhn and Pearsall, 2000).\nAlthough our participants' range of knowledge of evolution, acceptance of evolution and\nmeasures of religiosity were found to be consistent with previous research, (Anderson, et al.,\nof knowledge of evolution (specifically the process of natural selection) than expected, higher\nlevels of acceptance of evolution than expected, and greater compatibility of religion and\nevolution than found in previous studies. This is likely due to the self-selected nature of our\nsample of participants, and this finding cannot be generalized to educational professional as a\nwhole.\nOur analyses revealed that several variables including years of academic experience,\nprincipal academic responsibility, level of education, number of college level biology courses,\nexperience with researching and teaching science, and degree of religiosity, were significantly\nassociated with the acceptance and/or the understanding of evolution. It is important to note the\nresults revealed no correlation between the number of courses and acceptance of evolution. This\nsuggests that knowledge of evolution requires exposure to domain-specific content, but\nKnowledge and acceptance\nacceptance may come from domain-general understanding of theories and scientific knowledge.\nThis lends support to our argument that the combination of domain-specific and domain-general\nmeasures are essential for determining capacity to objectively consider evidence for an\nevolutionary educational psychology perspective.\nAs new developments and evidence emerge in evolutionary educational psychology, it is\nessential that future generations of educational professionals are prepared to evaluate the merits\nof new findings. Our data indicates that there are individuals within the profession who may be\npositioned to respond to this need. Our results also revealed that participants with M.A.s and\nM.Ed.s had constrained knowledge of evolution, experience in scientific research, and\nsubsequent levels of evolution acceptance. If these participants are the next generation of\nscholars, there is a necessity to address their preparedness. These needs may be attended to by\nincluding aspects of evolutionary educational psychology into the professional education\ncurriculum and by extending opportunities for gaining experience with scientific research. This\nis critical to assure that in the future there is a cadre of educational professionals who are\nprepared to continue to evaluate the plausibility and applicability of evolutionary educational\npsychology or other developments without bias.\nWe recommend that those individuals with the background and interest in this emerging\nfield examine evolutionary educational psychology to determine its possible relevance and utility\nfor their research programs and potential applications to other fields of study. Further, we\nencourage scholars who employ the evolutionary educational psychology framework to seek\ninvestigation methods that are capable of empirically testing learning and cognition based on this\nperspective. For example, research that explores the relative ease of learning in biologically\nprimary versus biological secondary domains from an evolutionary educational psychology\nperspective would be useful to examine this speculated distinction and more fully appreciate the\nlearning implications of the domain differences. In addition, we encourage educators who teach\ntheory courses to include elements of evolution-based explanations for cognition in their\ncurricula so that future scholars can develop awareness of this perspective and be prepared to\nconsider the utility of evolutionary educational psychology in their research programs.\nReferences\nAlters, B.
