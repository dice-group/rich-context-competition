    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nIt has recently been proposed that hypothalamic glial cells\nsense glucose levels and release lactate as a signal to activate\nadjacent neurons. GK (glucokinase), the hexokinase involved\nin glucose sensing in pancreatic b-cells, is also expressed in\nthe hypothalamus. However, it has not been clearly\ndetermined if glial and/or neuronal cells express this protein.\nInterestingly, tanycytes, the glia that cover the ventricular\nwalls of the hypothalamus, are in contact with CSF\n(cerebrospinal fluid), the capillaries of the arcuate nucleus\nand adjacent neurons; this would be expected for a system\nthat can detect and communicate changes in glucose\nconcentration. Here, we demonstrated by Western-blot\nanalysis, QRT\u00adPCR [quantitative RT\u00adPCR (reverse transcrip-\ntion\u00adPCR)] and in situ hybridization that GK is expressed in\ntanycytes. Confocal microscopy and immunoultrastructural\nanalysis revealed that GK is localized in the nucleus and\ncytoplasm of b1-tanycytes. Furthermore, GK expression\nincreased in these cells during the second week of post-natal\ndevelopment. Based on this evidence, we propose that\ntanycytes mediate, at least in part, the mechanism by which\nthe hypothalamus detects changes in glucose concentrations.\n",

It has been proposed that\nmetabolic interactions between glial cells and neurons may\nbe required for glucose sensing in the brain a short time after\nfeeding. Thus the glycolytic metabolism of glucose by glial\ncells and transfer of lactate to neighbouring neurons may\nlead to enhanced ATP synthesis in the latter and thus\ncontribute to the closure of KATP\nchannels (Ainscow et al.,\nHypothalamic neurons are associated with highly elon-\ngated glial cells, namely tanycytes. There are four different\ntypes of tanycytes, a1, a2, b1 and b2 (Akmayev and Popov,\nlateral wall of the third ventricle and develop cell processes\nthat contact neurons in the arcuate nucleus as well as\ncapillaries in the hypothalamus (Garcia et al., 2001). Thus\nperiventricular hypothalamic tanycytes, which contact the\nCSF (cerebrospinal fluid) and the neuronal soma, may\nmetabolically couple neurons from the arcuate and the\nventromedial nucleus, regulating glucose-sensing activities.\nWe demonstrated that GLUT2 (glucose transporter 2) is\nexpressed in tanycytes; however, we observed a reduced\nhybridization and immunohistochemical reactivity of GLUT2\nin neuronal soma, indicating low-to-absent expression of\nGLUT2 in arcuate nucleus neurons (Garcia et al., 2003). The\nexpression of GLUT2 in a- and b-tanycytes suggests that\ntanycytes contacting ventromedial hypothalamic neurons (a)\nand arcuate nucleus neurons (b) are involved in glucose\nuptake using the same low-affinity transporter. In both types\nof cells, the localization of GLUT2 is observed in the proximal\npole of tanycytes, which contacts the CSF (Garcia et al.,\n2003). Thus tanycytes may be primarily involved in detecting\nglucose concentration in the CSF of the ventricular system.\nSimilar localization of GLUT2 and GK (glucokinase) has been\ndetected in ependymal cells of the cerebral aqueduct and\ndorsal third ventricle (Maekawa et al., 2000), indicating that\n1 Correspondence may be addressed to either of these authors (email frnualart@udec.cl or mgarcia@udec.cl).\nAbbreviations: CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; DIG, digoxigenin; DTT, dithiothreitol; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; GLUT2, glucose transporter 2; GK, glucokinase; GKRP, GK\nregulatory protein; RT\u00adPCR, reverse transcription\u00adPCR; TFIIB, transcription factor IIB.\nE 2010 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/\nlicenses/by-nc/2.5/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\n2 These authors contributed equally to the present study.\ndifferent cells facing the ventricular system may be involved\nin glucose sensing.\nGK plays a fundamental role in glucose homoeostasis,\ncatalysing the high-Km\nphosphorylation of glucose in different\ntissues involved in glucose sensing. Glucose is transported by\nGLUT2, which has a high Km\nfor glucose, and then glucose is\nphosphorylated by GK or hexokinase IV. GK has a low affinity\nfor phosphorylating glucose (Km\nis not inhibited by glucose-6-phosphate.

GK\nmRNA was selectively identified by RT (reverse transcription)\u00ad\nPCR as well as in situ hybridization in rat hypothalamus (Kang\nimmunoblotting and enzyme assays have confirmed the\npresence of GK in rat and human hypothalamic extracts\nhypothalamus, regulating reproductive function, glucocorticoid\nsecretion, food intake and hypothalamic gene expression (Yang\net al., 2007). Thus GK plays a key role in the neuroendocrine\nregulation of metabolic economy. Kang et al. (2006) confirmed\nthat GK is a critical regulator of neuronal activity in freshly\ndissociated ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus neurons.\nThe hypothesis that the hypothalamus can detect changes\nin glucose levels requires the identification of the cells\ninvolved in this process. Consequently, the aim of the present\nstudy was to study whether tanycytes express GK and to\ndefine its subcellular distribution in the hypothalamic\nperiventricular region.\nAnimals\nWeusedadultSprague\u00adDawleyrats.TheAnimal Experimentation\nCommittee at the University of Concepcion, Faculty of Biological\nScience, approved all animal experiments.\nImmunocytochemistry\nRat brain samples (Sprague\u00adDawley) were dissected and\nfixed directly by immersion in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde\nsections (40 mm) were cut with a cryostat, and the sections\nwere processed free-floating. For immunohistochemical co-\nlocalization analyses, we used the following antibodies and\ndilutions: anti-GLUT2 (1:100, Alpha Diagnostic International,\nSan Antonio, TX, U.S.A.), rabbit anti-GFAP (glial fibrillary\nacidic protein; Dako, Campintene, CA, U.S.A.), mouse anti-\nvimentin (1:100; Boehringer\u00adMannheim, Mannheim,\nBiotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, U.S.A.), and sheep anti-GK\n(1:200, provided by Dr Mark Magnuson, Vanderbilt\nUniversity, Nashville, TN, U.S.A.). Sections were incubated\nwith the antibodies overnight at 20\u00b0C in a humid chamber.\nThe antibodies were diluted in a Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.8)\ncontaining 8.4 mM sodium phosphate, 3.5 mM potassium\nphosphate, 120 mM NaCl and 1% BSA. After extensive\nwashing, the liver or pancreas sections were incubated for 2\nDako). The peroxidase activity was developed using a DAB\n(diaminobenzidine) substrate kit (ImmunoPure; Pierce\nBiotechnology, Rockford, IL, U.S.A.). For immunofluores-\ncence and co-localization analyses, the brain tissues were\nincubated with the primary antibodies overnight and\nadditionally with Cy2- or Cy3-labelled secondary antibodies\n(1:200; Jackson Immuno Research). These samples were\ncounterstained with the DNA stain, Topro-3 (Invitrogen,\nRockville, MD, U.S.A.). The slides were analysed using\nconfocal laser microscopy (D-Eclipse C1 Nikon, Tokyo,\nJapan).\nUltrastructural immunohistochemistry\nBrain tissues were immersed for 2 h in a fixative containing\n2% paraformaldehyde and 0.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M\nphosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The samples were dehydrated in\ndimethylformamide and embedded in London Resin Gold\n(Electron Microscopy Science, Washington, DC, U.S.A.).\nUltrathin sections were mounted on uncoated nickel grids\nand processed for immunocytochemistry (Peruzzo et al.,\n2000). For immunostaining, rabbit anti-GK antibody was\nsodium phosphate, 3.5 mM potassium phosphate, 120 mM\nNaCl and 1% BSA. After extensive washing, the ultrathin\nsections were incubated for 2 h at 20\u00b0C with 10-nm\ncolloidal gold-labelled anti-rabbit IgG (1:20). Uranyl\nacetate/lead citrate was used as contrast, and samples\nwere analysed using a Hitachi H-700 electron microscope\nIn situ hybridization\nA PCR product of 510 bp obtained from the hypothalamus\nwas subcloned into pCR-4-Blunt-TOPO (Clontech, Palo Alto,\nCA, U.S.A.) and was used to generate sense and antisense DIG\n(digoxigenin)-labelled riboprobes.

The slides\nwere covered with glass coverslips and placed in a humidified\nchamber at 42\u00b0C overnight. After the removal of the\ncoverslips, the slides were rinsed in 46 SSC (16 SSC is\nperformed by incubation with a monoclonal antibody\ncoupled with alkaline phosphatase (anti-DIG alkaline phos-\nphatase Fab fragments diluted 1:500; Boehringer\u00adMannheim)\nat 20\u00b0C for 2 h. Nitro Blue Tetrazolium and BCIP (5-bromo-4-\nchloroindol-3-yl phosphate; Boehringer\u00adMannheim) were\nused as substrates for the alkaline phosphatase. Controls\nincluded the use of the sense riboprobe and omission of the\nprobe.\nThe brain of each rat was removed and the hypothalamic area\nwas taken out and further dissected until a region close to the\nependymal layer was obtained, and total RNA was isolated using\nTRIzolH (Invitrogen). For RT\u00adPCR, 1 mg of RNA was incubated in a\n, 20 units of RNase inhibitor, 1 mM dNTPs,\n2.5 mM of oligo(dT) primers, and 50 units of MuLV (murine\nleukaemia virus) reverse transcriptase (New England Biolabs,\nIpswich, MA, U.S.A.) for 10 min at 23\u00b0C followed by 30 min at\n42\u00b0C and 5 min at 94\u00b0C. Parallel reactions were performed in the\nabsence of reverse transcriptase to control for the presence of\ncontaminant DNA. For amplification, a cDNA aliquot in a volume\n(Gibco-BRL, Carlsbad, CA, U.S.A.) and 0.4 mM primers was\nseparated by 1.2\u00ad1.5% agarose-gel electrophoresis and visua-\nlized by staining with ethidium bromide. The following set of\nprimers was used to analyse the expression of GK: sense 59-\nATCATGCCGACCTCACATTGGC-39 (expected product of 510 bp).\nAdditionally, the following set of primers was used to analyse\nthe expression of b-actin: sense 59-GCTGCTCGTCGACAACGGCTC\nand antisense 59-CAAACATGATCTGGGTCATCTTCTC-39 (expected\nReal-time PCR\nRNA samples were treated with DNase I before reverse\ntranscription processing to remove genomic DNA contamina-\ntion. A total of 2 mg of RNA from each sample was reverse\ntranscribed into cDNA using the SuperScriptTM III first-strand\nsynthesis system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's\nsuggested protocol. QRT\u00adPCR (quantitative RT\u00adPCR) reactions\nwere prepared with a LightCycler reaction kit in a final volume\nof 20 ml containing 2 ml of 250 ng of reverse-transcribed total\nand 2 ml of LightCycler\nFastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I (Roche Applied Science).\nPCR reactions were carried out in capillaries in a LightCycler 2.0\ninstrument (Roche Applied Science Biosystem, Forster, CA,\nU.S.A.) and were cycled 40 times. The following set of primers\nwas used to analyse the expression of the housekeeping gene,\ncyclophilin: sense 59-TGGAGATGAATCTGTAGGAGGAG-39 and\nantisense 59-TACCACATCCATGCCCTCTAGAA-39 (expected\nproduct of 382 bp). The primers used to detect GK mRNA\nexpression were the same as those used for non-quantitative\nPCR. The thermal cycling conditions consisted of a pre-\nextension for 10 s at 72\u00b0C. All experiments were done in\ntriplicate to verify the results. The relative expression of GK\nmRNA to cyclophilin mRNA was calculated using the 22DDCt\nmethod. The statistical analysis was performed using Prism\nversion 4.0 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA,\nU.S.A.). GK expression in each group was compared using the\nKruskal\u00adWallis test (nonparametric ANOVA).\nImmunoblotting\nTotal protein extracts were obtained from rat periventri-\ncular hypothalamus, liver and pancreas by homogenizing\nthe tissue in buffer A (0.3 mM sucrose, 3 mM DTT, 1 mM\nEDTA, 100 mg/ml PMSF, 2 mg/ml pepstatin A, 2 mg/ml\nleucopeptin, and 2 mg/ml aprotinin) and sonicating on ice\nresolved by SDS/PAGE (70 mg per lane) in a 5\u00ad15% (w/v)\npolyacrylamide gel, transferred to PVDF membranes (0.45\nmm pore, Amersham Biosciences., Piscataway, NJ, U.S.A.),\nand probed with rabbit anti-GK or sheep anti-GK\nantibodies. The reaction was developed using the ECLH\nWestern-blot analysis system (Amersham Biosciences,\nPittsburgh, PA, USA).\nNuclear extract preparation\nTo analyse the subcellular localization of GK in situ,\nhypothalamic nuclear extracts were prepared using the\nfollowing protocol. Unicellular suspensions were obtained\nfrom the dissected tissues by trypsinization followed by\ndisruption in ice-cold PBS with protease inhibitors, DNase I,\n3 mM DTT and 1 mM EDTA.

After centrifugation at 850\ng for 1 min, the cell pellets were resuspended in hypo-\nKCl, pH 7.9). The nuclei were isolated by centrifugation at\n4600 g (Micromax RF centrifugue; IEC) for 1 min, and the\nnuclear pellets were resuspended in extraction buffer (20\n20% glycerol, pH 7.9) and agitated on an orbital shaker at\nmaximum speed in a cold chamber for 45 min followed by\ncentrifugation at 9300 g for 5 min. Nuclear extract aliquots\nwere frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 280\u00b0C. All\nprocedures following the cell disruption were performed on\nice or at 4\u00b0C. The purity of the nuclear extracts was\nconfirmed by Western-blot analysis using the antibody TFIIB\n(transcription factor IIB; sc-225, Santa Cruz Biotechnology),\na nuclear marker.\nRESULTS\nGK is expressed in the hypothalamus\nThe expression of GK in rat hypothalamus was analysed by\nRT\u00adPCR with primers specific for GK mRNA (Figure 1A, lane\n1). The amplified DNA band was approx. 510 bp, which was\nthe expected size for the GK amplification product. The PCR\nproduct was sequenced and showed 100% homology with\nhepatic or pancreatic GK (results not shown). The PCR\nconditions were optimized using RNA from rat liver and\npancreas as positive controls for GK expression (Figure 1A,\nlanes 2 and 3) and spleen tissue as a negative control\n1994). No amplification product was observed in samples of\nhypothalamus in the absence of reverse transcriptase\n(Figure 1A, lane 5). GK expression was also evaluated by\nWestern-blot analysis using protein extracts isolated from\nrat liver, pancreas and hypothalamus. First, we verified the\nreactivity of two different anti-GK antibodies (sheep and\nrabbit) (Figure 1B, lanes 1 and 2). Both antibodies\nrecognized the same band (54 kDa) in liver extracts.\nAdditionally, a similar band was detected in pancreas and\nhypothalamic protein extracts using rabbit anti-GK\n(Figure 1B, lanes 3 and 4). Rabbit anti-GK specificity was\nfurther analysed by immunohistochemistry in control\ntissues: liver, pancreas and insulinoma INS-1 cells (see\nSupplementary Figures S1A\u00adS1G at http://www.asnneuro.\nstrated that rabbit and sheep anti-GK antibodies showed\nthe same GK distribution in liver cells (Supplementary\nFigures S1H\u00adS1J). Thus sheep anti-GK was used to perform\nGK and GLUT2 co-localization analyses in brain cells.\nCytoplasmic GK expression was confirmed in ventricular\nependymal cells (Figures 1D and 1G), which also express\nGLUT2 localized in the cilia (Figures 1C and 1F).\nMorphological characterization of tanycytes and\nGK mRNA distribution\nPrior to analysing GK in hypothalamic tissue, anti-vimentin\nantibodies were used to define the exact localization of\ntanycytes in the rat brain (Figure 2). Using confocal microscopy\nanalysis and Z-stack projection in the X\u00adY and X\u00adZ planes\n(Figure 2C), we observed strong immunoreaction for the anti-\nvimentin antibodies in the periventricular bodies of cells and\nprocesses that are in contact with the ventromedial (a) and\narcuate nucleus (b) neurons (Figures 2A\u00ad2C). Additionally,\nultrastructural analysis (Figures 2D\u00ad2F) confirmed the classical\nmorphological characteristics of ventricular b-tanycytes:\nnamely microvilli and bleb projections in the apical region\nof cells (Figures 2D and 2E) and long processes that are in\ndirect contact with hypothalamic neurons (Figure 2F,\narrows). This structural association is essential for glia\u00ad\nneuron metabolic interaction. Scanning microscopy analysis\nrevealed the transition between ciliated ependymal cells and\ntanycytes (Figures 2G\u00ad2I) with microvilli (a-tanycytes) or\nblebs (b-tanycytes) in the apical membrane.\nWe analysed GK mRNA expression by in situ hybridization\nusing DIG-labelled cRNA probes specific for GK (Figures 3A\u00ad3F).\nA positive hybridization signal concentrated in the region facing\nthe third ventricle was detected in both a and b hypothalamic\ntanycytes (Figures 3C\u00ad3E). Although neurons showed a very low\nhybridization signal, the signal was not concentrated in the\narcuate or the ventromedial nucleus (Figures 3D and 3F). The\nreaction detected in tanycytes was completely abolished when\nthe sense probe was used (Figure 3B).\nOptic and ultrastructural analyses of nuclear and\ncytosolic GK distributions in hypothalamic\ntanycytes\nTo establish the precise localization of GK in the hypothal-\namus of adult rats, immunocytochemical detection and\nconfocal microscopy analyses were employed (Figure 4).\nIntense anti-GK immunoreactivity was detected in periven-\ntricular glial cells co-expressing vimentin (Figures 4A and 4B).\nA weaker reaction was observed in some hypothalamic\nneurons (Figure 4A); however, astrocytes and endothelial cells\nwere negative (Figures 4E\u00ad4L). Quantitative immunoreaction\nanalysis revealed that GK was preferentially expressed in\nperiventricular glial cells or tanycytes (Figure 4D). Addi-\ntionally, we demonstrated that GK was preferentially\nlocalized in tanycyte nuclei (Figures 4M\u00ad4O). A lower\nimmunoreaction was also detected in the tanycytes cytosol\n(Figure 4O and the inset). In order to confirm GK nuclear\ndetection, Western-blot analysis was performed using nuclear\nprotein extracts isolated from the periventricular hypothal-\namus. The purity of the nuclear extracts was confirmed using\nanti-TFIIb (Figure 4P) and GK localization was confirmed by\nusing rabbit anti-GK.\nUltrastructural immunohistochemistry showed GK nuclear\nlocalization in tanycytes (Figures 5C and 5D).

A diffuse GLUT2 distribution was detected in\ntanycytes (Figures 6A and 6D); however, most of the cells\nshowed stronger immunoreactivity in the apical region\n(Figure 6D). After Z-stack projection analysis, GK immunor-\neaction was clearly detected in the nuclei as well as the apical\nregion of tanycytes (Figures 6B and 6E). GK and GLUT2 co-\nlocalization was mainly detected in the apical region of the\ncells but not in the nucleus (Figures 6C and 6F).\nAdditionally, immunofluorescent staining and confocal\nmicroscopy were used to demonstrate broad GK distribution\nin different hypothalamic regions (Supplementary Figure S2\nGK is induced during post-natal development in\nhypothalamic tanycytes\nGK levels during post-natal development were assessed by\nimmunohistochemistry and RT\u00adPCR analyses (Figure 7).

Whereas GK was initially present in\nthe hypothalamus at equivalent levels for the first 5 days,\nadditional brain post-natal development was accompanied by\na marked increase in the amount of GK. Specifically, on days\nfold greater than that on day 1 respectively.\nDISCUSSION\nDifferent hypothalamic areas as well as others regions within\nthe brain, specifically the area postrema, medulla oblongata\nand tractus solitarius nucleus, are believed to have glucose-\nsensing mechanisms that modulate feeding behaviour\ncells of the pancreas, previous studies indicate that GK and\nGLUT2 expression in these brain areas is essential to detect\nchanges in blood glucose concentration (Bady et al., 2006;\nIn situ hybridization analysis has revealed GK and GLUT2\nexpression in a region of the hypothalamus containing neurons\nYang et al., 1999). However, the low resolution capacity of the\nradioautographic detection of the GK probe prevented\nidentification of the cell types expressing GK and GLUT2. The\nin situ non-isotopic hybridization carried out in the present\nstudy clearly identifies a- and b-tanycytes as the main\nhypothalamic cells positive for GK expression; however, a\nreduced hybridization signal in neuronal soma (arcuate\nnucleus) was also detected. Additionally, we performed a\ndetailed immunohistochemical analysis of GK expression in rat\nhypothalamic tanycytes using two different antibodies that\nshowed the same pattern of immunostaining. The tanycyte\nsubpopulation expressing GK and GLUT2 was also identified.

In pancreas and insulinoma\nISN-1 cells, GK was not detected in the nucleus; positive\nimmunostaining was observed only in the cytoplasm, con-\nfirming the specificity of GK antibodies. Other hypothalamic\ncells, such as astrocytes and endothelial cells, were consistently\nnegative for GK immunoreactivity; however, some neurons in\nthe arcuate nuclei were positive for GK. To increase GK\ndetection, we used 40 mm slides for confocal laser microscopy\nand Z-stack projection, confirming nuclear GK distribution as\nwell as its localization in the apical cytoplasmic region of\ntanycytes and ependymal cells of the third ventricle.\nOur results are consistent with initial immunocytochemical\nanalyses of GK expression, which revealed that this protein has\na wide distribution in the ependymal cells of ventricular\ncavities (Maekawa et al., 2000). GK and GLUT2 expression has\nbeen localized in ciliated ependymal cells of the cerebral\nventricles, specifically in the cell membrane of the cilia\n(Maekawa et al., 2000), which is similar to our results. However,\nno immunoreaction was observed in the low wall of the third\nventricle, the tanycytes region. It is possible that the difference\ncould be attributed to the use of different antibodies. The\nantibodies used in the present study recognize pancreatic and\nhepatic GK; however, the antibody used by Maekawa et al.\n(2000) reacted specifically with the pancreatic isoform.\nNuclear GK localization in tanycytes strongly suggests GKRP\nco-expression in these cells. Alvarez et al. (2002) demonstrated\nGKRP expression in the hypothalamus; GKRP mRNA was\ndetected in the periventricular nucleus. However, a detailed\nFigure 4 GK and vimentin are co-localized in the ventricular tanycytes\n(A and B) Frontal hypothalamic sections immunostained with anti-vimentin and anti-GK antibodies and using a secondary antibody\nlabelled with Cy3 (red) and Cy2 (green).

Therefore subcellular\ntranslocation of GK may regulate its activity in tanycytes in\naccordance with the metabolic needs of the cell.\nUsing rat hypothalamic slices, Sanz et al. (2007) reported\nGK expression and functional activity in ventromedial\nhypothalamus and lateral hypothalamus areas. They also\nanalysed the effects of glucose and insulin on GK activity in\nrat hypothalamus and demonstrated that GK activity was\nmodified by these molecules. Additionally, they postulated\nthat altered GK activity may be associated with specific cells\nin defined brain areas. Because tanycytes express GK and are\nin contact with ventromedial and lateral hypothalamic\nneurons, tanycytes may also modify GK activity.\nIn the periventricular hypothalamus, the interaction\nbetween hypothalamic neurons and glial periventricular cells\nmay be necessary for glucose sensing. Our previous study\nrevealed that astrocytes were absent from areas containing\na- and b1-tanycytes. In the hypothalamus, tanycytes are the\nprimary glial cell in contact with the CSF, blood and neurons\n(Garcia et al., 2001). Therefore the expression of GLUT2 and\nGK in hypothalamic tanycytes may have important physio-\nlogical consequences. An elevated Km\nfor glucose transport\nand the presence of GK imply that tanycytes increase their\nglucose uptake rate in direct proportion to extracellular\nchanges in glucose concentration. This property of GLUT2 and\nGK determines their participation in the glucose-sensing\nTherefore GLUT2 and GK may play a similar role in\nhypothalamic tanycytes. Sanders et al. (2004) injected\nalloxan, a GK inhibitor and toxin, into the third ventricle,\ndemonstrating that treated rats exhibited impaired feeding\nbehaviour and blood glucose concentration. These impaired\nresponses were associated with the destruction of third\nventricle tanycytes, neuronal swelling and decreased arcuate\nnucleus neuropeptide Y mRNA. However, 2 weeks after\nFigure 5 Ultrastructural immunocytochemistry of hypothalamic vent-\nricular wall\nFrontal section through the rat medial basal hypothalamus.

Interestingly, in genetic complementation\nexperiments in which a GLUT2 cDNA was expressed in\nRipglut1;glut22/2 mice under the control of the GFAP (glial-\nspecific) or the synapsin (neuron-specific) promoters,\ncounter-regulation was restored only when GLUT2 was\nexpressed in glial cells (Marty et al., 2005). According to a\npreviously published hypothesis, the glia cell may take up\nglucose through GLUT2, catabolize it to lactate and transfer\nlactate to neurons via monocarboxylate transporters for\nproduction of ATP through further degradation by the\ntricarboxylic acid cycle (Ainscow et al., 2002).\nGK levels were strongly up-regulated during the second\nweek of post-natal development. This suggests that GK\nfunctional activity is increased when the blood\u00adbrain barrier\nreaches the mature level with the weaning (Vorbrodt et al.,\n2001). In the second week, GK was broadly distributed in the\ncytoplasm of the tanycytes but not in the nucleus. A similar\nsubcellular distribution has been observed in liver cells.\nBefore day 11 post-partum, only some hepatocytes were\nimmunostained, and a positive reaction was found in the\ncytoplasm but not in the nucleus of the cells (Toyoda et al.,\n1995b). These results suggest that nuclear compartmentaliza-\ntion may be associated with post-natal GKRP co-expression, a\ncondition that has not been analysed in hypothalamic\ntanycytes or liver cells.\nFigure 7 GK levels during post-natal tanycyte development\nFrontal hypothalamic sections through the rostral hypothalamic region immunostained with rabbit anti-GK (green) or and anti-\nvimentin (red).
