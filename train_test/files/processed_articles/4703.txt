The Problem-\nBehavior Theory provides a useful framework for explaining both health-compromising and health-enhancing behaviors by\nconsidering several personal and environmental factors. The present study used a model with seven independent variables\nincluding age, gender, attitudes, locus of control, risk behavior tendency, stress, and parent/peer models of health behavior to\npredict two health-compromising behaviors (alcohol drinking and risky driving) and two health-enhancing behaviors (physical\nactivity, healthy eating) in a sample of 347 Albanian young adults (157 men and 190 women, M\nage\nmeasuring instrument was based on the Health Behavior Questionnaire developed by Jessor, Donovan, and Costa. Results\nshowed that the model explained 26.1% of the variance in risky driving behavior, and the significant predictors included,\nrisk behavior tendency, gender, and attitude toward health. These same three variables also significantly predicted drinking\nbehavior, explaining 16.8% of the variance. Also the model explained 14.2% of the variance in healthy eating behavior and the\nsignificant predictors included, models of significant others, gender, locus of control, attitude toward health, and age. Finally,\nthe only two significant predictors for physical activity were risky behavior tendency and perceived stress, which accounted\nfor 13.2% of the variance. Findings are discussed in the context of suggestions for future research and practical implications\nfor policy making.\n",

Certainly, the consideration\nof personal and environmental variables separately consti-\ntutes a major limitation to the proper understanding of the\noverall context in which health behaviors are established.\nMoreover, research has shown that although separately con-\nsidered in studies, both personal and environmental variables\nare involved as predictors of health behavior (Cairney, Kwan,\nVeldhuizen, & Faulkner, 2014; Silva, Lott, Mota, & Welk,\n2014). Another argument along these lines is the repeatedly\nfound relationship between the several health behaviors\nthemselves (i.e., individuals engaged in physical activity also\nhave a healthy diet; conversely, smoking and drinking also\ngo together); hence, it might be expected that they also have\ncommon personal or environmental predictors (although the\nrelevance of the specific predictors might vary on the spe-\ncific behavior; for example, Kwan, Cairney, Faulkner, &\nPullenayegum, 2012). The identification of common predic-\ntors for different health behaviors has an important practical\nrelevance especially as regards health behavior interven-\ntions, that is, they might target simultaneously factors related\nto more than one behavior (Hingson, Zha, Iannotti, &\nIn this context, the PBT (Jessor, 1991) provides a useful\ntheoretical framework for understanding health behaviors in\n1European University of Tirana, Albania\nCorresponding Author:\nErika Melonashi, European University of Tirana, Blv.

Although PBT was not originally a health-behavior\ntheory, it has proved to be quite successful in explaining a\nwide range of health risk behaviors among adolescents and\nyoung adults, both cross-culturally and longitudinally\nTurbin, 2014). More specifically, the theory considers the\ninteractions of three main systems of variables including (a)\nperceived environmental variables, (b) personality system\nvariables, and (c) behavior system variables. Variables in the\nenvironment or personality systems might serve both as con-\ntrols or instigators of the specific health behavior (Jessor,\nTurbin, & Costa, 1998). Studies have indicated that the the-\nory is useful in explaining both health-compromising (e.g.,\ndrinking) and health-enhancing behaviors (e.g., physical\nactivity, healthy eating; Jessor, Turbin, & Costa, 2010).\nPBT Components: Perceived Environmental\nVariables\nThe perceived environmental variables comprise two main cat-\negories: proximal variables (i.e., variables whose link to the\nspecific behavior is direct) and distal variables (i.e., variables\nwhose link to the specific behavior is not direct but requires\ntheoretical explanations; Jessor et al., 1998). Behavioral mod-\nels have been considered among the most influential proximal\nenvironmental variables; thus, parents' or friends' behavior\nmight promote health-compromising/enhancing behaviors\naccordingly. Examples might include, alcohol drinking among\nindividuals who have drinking parents or healthy eating among\nindividuals growing up in families with healthy eating habits.\nOn the other hand, models might also inhibit both types of\nbehavior, for example, abstaining from alcohol drinking among\nindividuals whose friends/peer groups do not drink, or having\nunhealthy eating habits among individuals whose friends/peers\neat junk food. Research studies have supported the relevance of\nfamily models in the establishment of drinking patterns or eat-\nal., 2000). Peers also serve as important models influencing\nhealth behaviors such as alcohol consumption or physical\nStress, on the other hand, represents an important though\ndistal environmental variable. The relationships between\nstress levels and health-compromising behaviors are by now\nwidely accepted. More specifically, research has indicated\nthat higher levels of perceived stress are related with\nincreased alcohol drinking, overeating/less healthy eating,\nand reduced physical activity (J\u00e4\u00e4skel\u00e4inen et al., 2014;\nStults-Kolehmainen & Sinha, 2014). Findings have been\nexplained in terms of stress management efforts, for exam-\nple, drinking or overeating to reduce anxiety levels, negative\nfeelings, and so on (e.g., Park & Iacocca, 2014; Read,\nRadomski, & Borsari, 2015) or negative stress outcomes\n(e.g., poor motivation and low energy to engage in physical\nactivity; Gerber, Jonsdottir, Lindwall, & Ahlborg, 2014).\nPBT Components: Personality System Variables\nPersonality system variables include a set of variables both\nsocial and cognitive in nature, such as attitudes, general ori-\nentations toward the self or society, and so on (Jessor et al.,\n2010). Relationships between attitudes and behavior have\nbeen thoroughly investigated by now (e.g.,Ajzen & Fishbein,\n1977), although controversy still exists on their relevance of\nattitudes in the context of other predictors of behavior. As\nregards the impact of personal risk-taking tendencies on\nactual behavior, several controversial findings have been\nreported, for example, either supporting or discarding its rel-\nevance (Appelt, Milch, Handgraaf, & Weber, 2011; Lauriola,\nPanno, Levin, & Lejuez, 2014). Thus, the debate over the\nrespective influence of this variable in the context of other\ndeterminants of behavior is ongoing, as research is focusing\nmore and more on the conditions under which one compo-\nnent or the other acquires greater importance (e.g., Kopetz et\nal., 2014). In this context, the increased specificity in defin-\ning risk behavior tendency (i.e., in terms of the specific\nbehavior investigated such as unprotected sex, risky driving,\netc.), increases the relevance of this variable as a predictor of\nhealth behavior (e.g., Shuper, Joharchi, & Rehm, 2014).\nResearch has provided evidence indicating relationships\nbetween variables such as risk motivation and risky driving\nbehavior, sensation seeking and drinking behavior, and so on\n(Aklin, Luejez, Zvolensky, Kahler, & Gwadz, 2005; Romer,\norientation seems to be an instigator of health-compromising\nbehaviors such as drinking or risky driving, although its rel-\nevance depends also on the other factors investigated. Also,\nthe relationship might not be very straightforward when it\ncomes to health-enhancing behaviors such as physical activ-\nity or healthy eating.\nIndeed health-enhancing behaviors seem to be better\nexplained in terms of another personality variable, that is,\nlocus of control. Research has supported the relevance of\nlocus of control in explaining health-related behaviors;\nthus, individuals who believe that they are in control of\ntheir behavior and feel responsible for their own state of\nhealth (internal locus of control) are engaged in more\nhealthy behaviors than those who think they are not respon-\nsible for their health (Helmer et al., 2012; Song & Ling,\nThus, internal health locus of control seems to be an insti-\ngator of healthy eating behavior, and physical activity,\nwhile serving as control for alcohol drinking or risky driv-\ning behavior.\nThe Context and Purpose of the Study\nThe present study uses a theoretically driven predictive\nmodel with the purpose of explaining two health-compro-\nmising behaviors, alcohol drinking and risky driving, and\ntwo health-enhancing behaviors: healthy eating and physical\nactivity in a cross-sectional sample ofAlbanian young adults.\nAs compared with other European countries, Albania has a\nMelonashi and Shkembi 3\ncomprised almost 40% of the whole population; Albania\nAs research studies indicate, adolescence and young adult-\nhood represent a critical period for the establishment of\nhealth behaviors, as individuals move further away from\nparental control and acquire greater independence in choos-\ning their lifestyles (e.g., kinds of foods they eat, how much\nthey drink, physical activities they are involved, and so on;\nWalther, Aldrian, St\u00fcger, Kiefer, & Ekmekcioglu, 2014). In\nthe specific Albanian social context, changes in the politi-\ncal regime (from communism to democracy) have been\naccompanied with increasing rates of smoking, alcohol and\ndrug use, malnutrition, and unsafe sexual practices as com-\nthere is a fast increase in the number of traffic accidents in\ngeneral and fatal accidents in particular among adolescents\nand young adults; alcohol use has been identified as one of\nthe strongest predictors of this outcome (together with\nyounger age; Qirjako, Burazeri, Hysa, & Roshi, 2008).\nMost concerning, the long-term negative effects of increas-\ning health risk behaviors are already becoming evident.\nAccording to the Albanian Public Health Institute, there is\nan alarming increase in the prevalence of lifestyle diseases\nsuch as cardiovascular diseases, obesity, diabetes, and so on\n(Family Health International, 2006; Public Health Institute,\n2013). In this context, it has been argued that the ongoing\nreform of the health care system in Albania must place\ngreater focus on prevention (involving the identification\nand control of risk factors) in addition to patient care\n(Dumi & Sinaj, 2014). Hence, factors related to or\nexplaining health behaviors need to be identified and\naddressed properly.\nIn this context, the present study aimed to examine the\nimpact of (a) perceived environmental variables: models of\nparents/friends and perceived levels of stress; (b) personality\nvariables: attitude toward health, (internal) health locus of\ncontrol, and risk orientation on two health-compromising\nbehaviors: alcohol drinking and risky driving, and two\nhealth-enhancing behaviors: healthy eating and physical\nactivity. Age and gender patterns for all four behaviors were\nalso examined.\nMethod\nParticipants and Procedure\nParticipants were 347 students of the European University of\nage\npose of the study, stratified sampling was used, so that the\nsample reflects the real proportions of first-, second-, and\nthird-level students studying in the three faculties of the\nuniversity (Economics, Law, and Social Sciences). Table 1\nshows the classification of participants by faculty and level\nof study.\nThe study procedure extended over 10 days and was\nguided by a previously designed scheme taking into account\nthe schedule of classes for each faculty and each level. In\ncollaboration with the university professors, project collabo-\nrators entered the classrooms during the last 15 min and dis-\ntributed the questionnaires together with the informed\nconsent forms. Students were assured of the anonymity and\nconfidentiality of the data and were free to withdraw from\nthe study at any time.\nMeasuring Instruments\nThe measuring instrument was based on the Health Behavior\nQuestionnaire developed by Jessor et al. (1991). Relevant\npermission was acquired by authors. For the purpose of the\nstudy, only parts of the instrument measuring the variables of\ninterest were used. The translation and back-translation\nmethod was used to ensure the correct translation of the\nselected items. Hence, the items were translated intoAlbanian\nby two professional translators and subsequently the two\nversions were back-translated into English by two other pro-\nfessional translators. English versions were compared against\neach other and the original. Inconsistencies were noted down\nand addressed in the respective Albanian versions. Both\nAlbanian versions were piloted among 10 students. The\nrespective scores correlated highly (r = .85) and students did\nnot report any difficulties with the items. A subsequent dis-\ncussion with students (focus group) was conducted to resolve\nthe differences in wording between the two versions of the\nquestionnaire (e.g., which version was most clear according\nto them?) and come up with one final version.\nThe first part of the questionnaire provided information\non participants' age, gender, as well as level and program of\nstudy. Healthy eating was measured with four items, with\nhigher scores showing more frequent healthy eating behav-\nior. Examples included, \"How often do you eat vegetables/\nfruit?\" The subscale showed good internal consistency ( =\n.83). Driving behavior was also assessed with four items,\nwith higher scores showing more frequent risky driving.\nExamples included, \"During the last 6 months, how often did\nyou drive after having one or two drinks?\" This subscale also\nTable 1. Participants by Faculty and Levels of Study.\nFirst level Second level Third level Total\nFaculty\n4 SAGE Open\nhad acceptable internal consistency ( = .77). Drinking\nbehavior was measured with a single item assessing fre-\nquency of getting drunk in the past 6 months, with higher\nscores showing a higher frequency. Physical activity was\nalso measured with a single item assessing the amount of\ntime spent with different physical activities per week; higher\nscores indicated more time spent with physical activities.\nAttitude toward health/value placed on health was mea-\nsured with seven items, with higher scores indicating more\nimportance placed on health. Examples included, \"How\nimportant is it for you to feel in good shape?\" The subscale\nhad acceptable internal consistency,  = .79. Health locus of\ncontrol was assessed with four items, with higher scores\nindicating stronger internal locus of control. Examples\nincluded, \"If I do things right, it's easy to stay in good\nhealth.\" The subscale had acceptable internal consistency, \n= .70. Risk behavior tendency was measured with four items,\nwith higher scores indicating a stronger tendency toward\nrisk-taking behavior. Examples included, \"In the past 6\nmonths, how often have you done something dangerous just\nfor the thrill of it?\" \"In the past 6 months, how often have\nyou taken chances with your safety when you were out at\nnight because it was exciting?\" This subscale also had\nacceptable internal consistency,  = .78.\nModels of behavior were assessed with eight items group-\ning together parent/peer models of the four behaviors of\ninterest; the scores on the two health-compromising behav-\niors (drinking/risky driving) were reversed, so that higher\nscores on the subscale ultimately indicated more healthy\nmodels of behavior. Examples included, \"Does your mother/\nfather/closest friend pay attention to eating a healthy diet?\"\nThe subscale had acceptable internal consistency,  = .73.\nFinally, perceptions of stress were measured with three items\nassessing reported stress in different settings. Examples\nincluded, \"In the past 6 months, how much stress or pressure\nhave you felt at home?\" Higher scores indicated higher stress\nlevels and the subscale had low but acceptable internal con-\nAnalyses and Results\nDescriptive Analyses\nDescriptive analyses indicated that 41.3% of the sample\nreported they never got drunk in the past 6 months, 50.6%\nreported this behavior as occurring rarely to sometimes, and\n8% reported getting drunk often. In terms of risky driving\nbehavior, 27.6% of the sample reported they never engaged\nin risky driving behavior in the past 6 months, whereas the\nremaining 72.4% reported at least one form of risky driving\nbehavior during this time period. In terms of physical activ-\nity, only 24.5% of the sample reported not being engaged in\nany form of physical activity on a weekly basis. As regards\nhealthy eating behavior, only 1.8% of the sample reported\ntotal lack of any healthy eating habits; the rest of the sample\nreported at least one healthy eating habit (e.g., eating fruits\nand vegetables), and 26.4% of the sample reported all four\nlisted habits. Descriptive statistics on attitude/value placed\non health indicated that only 75.6% of participants consid-\nered feeling healthy as \"important\" or \"very important,\"\nwhereas the remaining 24.4% as little or somewhat\nimportant.\nMultivariate Regression Analysis\nCorrelations between the dependent variables indicated that\nhealthy eating correlated positively with physical activity, r\n= .16, p < .01, so that individuals following a healthy diet\nalso tended to do more physical activity. Drinking behavior\ncorrelated positively with risky driving behavior, r = .48, p <\n.01, so that individuals who reported getting drunk more fre-\nquently also reported more risky driving behavior.\nConsidering the multiple dependent variables, which also\ncorrelated with each other, multivariate regression was per-\nformed with healthy eating, drinking behavior, physical\nactivity, and driving behavior as dependent variables, and\ngender, age, attitudes, locus of control, risk behavior ten-\ndency, models of behavior, and stress perceptions as inde-\npendent variables. Results showed that the proposed model\nwas better at predicting driving behavior, R2 = .261, followed\nand physical activity, R2 = .132. Table 2 indicates only the\nresults that showed statistical significance.\nThe only significant predictors of risky driving behavior\nin order of importance were risk behavior tendency, gender,\nand attitude toward health (see Table 2). These same three\nvariables also significantly predicted drinking behavior (the\nonly difference was that gender ranked third in order of\nimportance). Hence, youth who reported more frequent\ndrinking and risky driving behaviors in the past 6 months,\nalso reported a stronger risk behavior tendency, put less\nvalue on health, and were more likely to be men.\nThe strongest predictor of healthy eating was \"models of\nsignificant others,\" followed by gender, locus of control, atti-\ntude toward health, and age (see Table 2). Hence, youth who\nreported healthier eating habits, also reported healthier\nbehavior models (parents and friends); also they were more\nlikely to be women, had stronger internal locus of control,\nput more value on health, and were older in age. Finally, the\nonly two significant predictors for physical activity were\nrisky behavior tendency and perceived stress (see Table 2).\nThus, youth who engaged more in physical activity reported\na stronger tendency toward risk behavior, and also lower lev-\nels of stress.\nMelonashi and Shkembi 5\nDiscussion\nThe present study used a theoretical driven model to predict\ntwo health-compromising (alcohol drinking, risky driving)\nand two health-enhancing (healthy eating, physical activity)\nbehaviors in a sample of Albanian youth. Results indicated\nthat the majority of participants reported healthy eating hab-\nits, engaged in physical activities, and also reported never or\nrarely getting drunk. However, as regards risky driving\nbehavior, about 70% of current drivers reported at least one\nform of risky driving during the last 6 months (speeding up/\nnot wearing seatbelts/crossing with red light, etc.). These\nresults are particularly concerning considering the increasing\nrates of accident-related deaths in Albania (e.g., Qirjako et\nal., 2008) and should be also further investigated in future\nresearch. Factors, which might promote this massive non-\ncompliance with driving regulations in Albania, should be of\nmajor concern. Although this aspect was beyond the scope of\nthe present study, findings provided some explanation of\nrisky driving at least in terms of individual-level factors;\nindeed, the suggested model proved to be mostly useful in\nexplaining risky driving behavior (as compared with the\nother three behaviors of interest).\nRisky Driving and Drinking Behavior\nBoth risky driving and drinking behavior were explicable in\nterms of risk behavior tendency, gender, and attitude toward\nhealth. The relevance of these three individual difference\nvariables raises once more the debate of internal versus\nexternal determinants of behavior. These findings are in line\nwith existing research finding associations between health\nbehaviors and risk orientation (Aklin et al., 2005; Romer,\nin this case serves as a promoter for both health-compromis-\ning behaviors investigated in the study. Male gender is also\nan important predictor for both health-compromising behav-\niors, a finding which is in line with current cross-cultural\nresearch (Khan, Cleland, Scheidell, & Berger, 2014; \u00d6zkan\nWilsnack, & Harris, 2000). Conversely, female gender not\nonly serves as a control of health-compromising behaviors\nbut also as an instigator of healthy behavior (e.g., eating hab-\nits). These findings are in line with existing research and\nhave been explained in terms of weight control and body\nimage concerns (Leblanc, B\u00e9gin, Corneau, Dodin, &\nHealthy Eating Behavior\nApart from gender, attitude toward health (value placed on\nhealth) also was relevant in explaining not only the two\nhealth-compromising behaviors but also healthy eating\nbehavior. Thus, the value individuals place on health seems\nto act as a control in the cases of risky driving or drinking\nbehavior, but as an instigator in the case of a health promot-\ning behavior such as healthy eating. Hence, despite the lack\nof specificity (e.g., Ajzen & Fishbein, 1977), this variable\nseems to be important across a range of different health\nbehaviors, a finding which has implications especially in\nterms of prevention/intervention programs addressing atti-\ntudes to health. Indeed, in the present sample, almost one\nfourth of participants considered health to be little or some-\nwhat important and this figure might be much higher in other\nparts of the population (e.g., in youth who do not have uni-\nversity education). This finding is important considering that\nAlbania is still a country where regular check-ups are still a\nbehavior of the minority, where self-medication is the most\nfrequent form of self-reliance, and professional assessment is\nlimited only to urgent or grave cases (De Soto, Gordon,\nTable 2. Multivariate Regression for Healthy Eating, Physical Activity, Drinking Behavior, and Driving Behavior.\nIndependent variables Dependent variables F value Significance 2\nNote. Model for risky driving behavior, R2 = .261; model for drinking behavior, R2 = .168; model for healthy eating, R2 = .142; model for physical activity,\n6 SAGE Open\nApart from gender and attitude, healthy eating behavior\nwas also predicted from behavioral models, locus of control,\nand age. These findings are in line with research suggesting\nthe importance of family models in the acquisition of healthy\net al., 2014) and the relevance of internal locus of control in\nhealth behavior maintenance (e.g., Helmer et al., 2012; Song\nage has also been associated with more healthy eating habits;\nit has been suggested that increasing age provides the neces-\nsary knowledge and control to adopt a healthier lifestyle\nPhysical Activity\nFinally, physical activity was significantly predicted by only\ntwo variables, risk behavior tendency and perceived stress.\nThe positive association between risk behavior tendency and\nphysical exercise is a quite controversial finding which needs\nto be addressed in future research. A possible explanation is\nthat engagement in physical exercise might provide a\n\"healthy\" way to manage the individual tendency toward\nrisk taking. However, this proposition cannot be tested in the\npresent research because the study did not assess motives for\nexercising or the types of physical activities individuals were\nengaged in (e.g., extreme sports?). On the other hand, the\nnegative relationship between physical activity and levels of\nstress replicates research suggesting the stress management\nfunction of physical activity (e.g., Cairney et al., 2014).\nLimitations and Suggestions for Future Research\nTo summarize, findings indicated that the model did best in\nexplaining health-compromising rather than health-enhanc-\ning behaviors. Moreover personal, rather than environmental\nvariables proved to be more relevant in predicting all four\nhealth behaviors. Despite its' contribution in suggesting\nsome of the determinants of health behaviors in the Albanian\ncontext, the study also has some limitations which need to be\ndiscussed and addressed in future research. For instance, the\nbroad scope of the present study (four different health behav-\niors) makes it quite difficult to discuss or analyze in depth the\nparticularity of each health behavior. Future research might\nconsider apart from macro-level variables, also behavior-\nspecific variables (e.g., attitude toward drinking, rather than\njust attitude toward health in general). Along these lines,\nthere are also several methodological shortcomings which\nneed to be acknowledged. First, considering that the sample\nincluded students from only one Albanian university, care\nshould be taken in generalizing the findings for the student\npopulation in Albania. Moreover, Albanian youth who did\nnot pursue university studies might provide a quite different\npicture from the one discussed in the present research. Hence,\nit is suggested that future research should be conducted with\nmore representative samples, where education might also be\nconsidered as a variable. Another limitation has to do with\nthe measure used; it is suggested that future research uses\nmore specific behavioral measures, and avoids single item\nmeasures. Nonetheless, despite its limitations, findings of the\npresent study provide useful directions for future research in\nthe area; for instance, a particularly interesting and important\nproblem to address might involve factors explaining the high\nnoncompliance rates with traffic regulations, including coun-\ntry-specific policies, or attitudes toward these policies.\nMoreover, the controversial findings concerning the relation-\nship between physical activity and risky behavior tendency\nalso need further research; thus, it might be quite interesting\nto explore the actual function of physical activity in individu-\nals prone to engage in risky behavior. Finally, issues related\nto gender roles, cultural norms, and health risk behaviors\nmight also represent a fruitful direction for future research in\nAlbania.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nAjzen, I., & Fishbein, M.
