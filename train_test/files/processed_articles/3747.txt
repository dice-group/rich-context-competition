    "abstract": "Abstract\nQualitative evaluations of courses prove difficult due to low response rates. Online courses may permit the analysis of\nqualitative feedback provided by health care providers (HCPs) during and after the course is completed. This study describes\nthe use of qualitative methods for an online continuing medical education (CME) course through the analysis of HCP feedback\nfor the purpose of quality improvement. We used formative and summative feedback from HCPs about their self-reported\nexperiences of completing an online expert-facilitated course on tobacco dependence treatment (the Training Enhancement\nin Applied Cessation Counselling and Health [TEACH] Project). Phenomenological, inductive, and deductive approaches\nwere applied to develop themes. QSR NVivo 11 was used to analyze the themes derived from free-text comments and\nresponses to open-ended questions. A total of 277 out of 287 participants (96.5%) completed the course evaluations and\nprovided 690 comments focused on how to improve the program. Five themes emerged from the formative evaluations:\noverall quality, content, delivery method, support, and time. The majority of comments (22.6%) in the formative evaluation\nexpressed satisfaction with overall course quality. Suggestions for improvement were mostly for course content and\ndelivery method (20.4% and 17.8%, respectively). Five themes emerged from the summative evaluation: feedback related to\nlearning objectives, interprofessional collaboration, future topics of relevance, overall modifications, and overall satisfaction.\nComments on course content, website function, timing, and support were the identified areas for improvement. This study\nprovides a model to evaluate the effectiveness of online educational interventions. Significantly, this constructive approach to\nevaluation allows CME providers to take rapid corrective action.\n",

The TEACH\ncurriculum consists of three courses: (1) an online introduc-\ntory course on tobacco control pillars (10.5 hours), (2) a\nclassroom-based or online Core Course on the fundamentals\nof tobacco dependence treatment (19.5 hours), and (3) a\nclassroom-based or online Specialty Course focused on a\nvariety of populations or topics where tobacco dependence\ntreatment requires adaptation (13.5 hours). Course evalua-\ntion is a critical component to quality assurance and improve-\nment. The TEACH Project's comprehensive evaluation\nframework7 includes course evaluations completed by learn-\ners following each course module (i.e., formative evaluation)\nin addition to a summative evaluation immediately adminis-\ntered post training. Learners also complete a follow-up eval-\nuation at 3 and 6 months post training.\nTo create a learner-centered program that supports rapid\nexperiential learning8 and expands reach by building\ncapacity among HCPs unable to travel for classroom-based\ntraining, TEACH courses have been adapted for the online\nenvironment, utilizing best practice principles in e-Learn-\ning. Despite administering comprehensive quantitative\nsurveys, a qualitative evaluation was designed to inform\nquality improvement of the TEACH online Core Course.7\nData obtained from written questionnaires with predefined\nanswers may be less contextually rich than that obtained\nthrough qualitative approaches9 (i.e., free-text or open-\nended comments). With qualitative response options, par-\nticipants can respond to the questions as they would like to\nanswer them and the researcher can investigate the mean-\ning of these responses. However, we recognized that the\nqualitative feedback may not be representative of the all\nHCPs who participated in the online Core Course, and\ntherefore, quantitative data from an online survey were\nalso obtained.\nThe goals of this article are to (1) introduce curriculum\ndesigners to an innovative use of qualitative methods in both\nformative and summative course evaluations and (2) describe\nthe qualitative findings elicited from TEACH-trained HCPs\nfollowing their participation in the TEACH online Core\nCourse for program evaluation.\nMethods\nThis article reports thematic analysis of HCPs' opinions\nexpressed in feedback data from four cohorts of the TEACH\nonline Core Course. These data were collected in January,\nMay, July, and October 2015 during and after the course was\ncompleted. HCPs were asked to provide free-text comments\nafter each of 10 modules (i.e., formative) and respond to a\nseries of open-ended questions following the end of the\ncourse (i.e., summative), in addition to quantitative ques-\ntions. Demographic information, professional discipline, and\nnumber of years providing tobacco cessation interventions\nwere also collected. At the time this study was designed, the\nCentre for Addiction and Mental Health Research Ethics\nBoard deemed that formal review and approval was not\nrequired for our study.\nIn this phenomenological study, we used a hybrid process\nof inductive and deductive thematic analysis to interpret the\nfree-text comments from the formative evaluations and\nopen-ended questions from the summative evaluations.\nInductive codes were based on prominent themes that\nemerged from HCPs' free-text comments. Our deductive\ncodes were based on concepts that we explicitly asked HCPs\nabout (e.g., what overall modifications to the course do you\nsuggest) through open-ended questions, in which we\nsearched for attributes of Henri's model.10 This strategy\nallowed us to examine our study questions (i.e., through our\nquestions in the summative phase and through deductive\ncodes) while capturing other key themes that emerged from\nthe data (i.e., free-text comments through inductive codes\nthat allowed the data, rather than theory, to drive coding).11\nWe used the Braun and Clarke model12 for our thematic anal-\nysis as it is a flexible approach that can be used across a\nrange of research questions applying the following six\nphases: (1) Free-text comments and responses to open-ended\nquestions were read and reread to familiarize the researchers\nwith the data; (2) a range of initial codes were generated to\nindex common features across comments; (3) these initial\ncodes were examined to determine prevalent themes; (4)\nthemes were reviewed for internal homogeneity and external\nheterogeneity, to combine similar themes into overarching\nthemes and draw coherent links or distinctions between\nthem; (5) the overarching themes were firmly defined, orga-\nnized in relation to their collated data extracts, and then ana-\nlyzed for subthemes; and (6) the report was produced.\nSeveral steps were taken to ensure methodological and ana-\nlytical rigor in this investigation. Two independent raters\n(A.E.A. and M.B.) coded the transcripts. Before the analysis\nof the data, the raters met to discuss any discrepant codes until\nconsensus was met in regard to the final codes.Aquarter of the\ndata were double-coded to check for consistency, for which\nthere was >90% agreement between researchers (A.E.A. and\nM.B.). To minimize the risk of bias, the prominence of main\nthemes and their respective subthemes was determined\nthrough discussion between two authors. These authors read\nthe free-text comments and answers to open-ended questions\nEbn Ahmady et al 3\nas well as reviewed all coded quotations for each theme.\nUnanimity among the two coders was required. When una-\nnimity was not achieved, comments were discussed until con-\nsensus was reached. Quotes are presented in the results to\nillustrate the themes and subthemes identified. To validate the\nfindings, first hand quotes are presented word-for-word within\nthe results in Table 2.13 Also, further evidence of validity was\nobtained by comparing emergent finding with the literature.\nThe qualitative software QSR NVivo 11 was used to perform\ncontent analysis of the themes derived from the comments.\nResults\nIn total, 96.5% of participants completed the course evalua-\ntions. A breakdown of the sample for each cohort appears in\nTable 1. Participants were asked to select their professional dis-\ncipline. Overall, 44% (n = 124) of the participants were nurses.\ncomments through free-text comments and answers to open-\nended questions within the study questionnaires, describing\ntheir satisfaction with their learning experience and sugges-\ntions for improvement of the TEACH online Core Course.\nFormative Evaluation\nThe five central themes identified from 349 comments within\nthe data are presented with their subthemes alongside quota-\ntions as examples. Table 2 lists these themes in the following\ncategories: positive feedback and suggestions for improve-\nment. The overall focus of the study was on \"suggestions for\nimprovement,\" and a high proportion of the comments (61%\nof comments) provided feedback to improve the following\ncourse areas: content of the course (20.4% of comments),\ndelivery system (17.8% of comments), evaluation of the\ncourse (11.7% of comments), timing of the course (8.3% of\ncomments), and overall quality (2.6% of comments).\nMore general positive comments emerging from the data\n(39% of comments) typically consisted of 1-word responses,\nsuch as \"good\" or \"excellent.\" Positive responses were\ngrouped into the following themes: overall quality (22.6% of\ncomments), content of the course (14% of comments), deliv-\nery method (1% of comments), timing of the course (0.6% of\ncomments), and evaluation of the course (0.3% of comments).\nThe majority of comments made by HCPs in the formative\nevaluation were positive, expressing satisfaction with overall\ncourse quality. Comments on course content and the delivery\nmethod were identified as key areas for improvement. HCPs\nalso wanted the course designers to address problems with\ncontent flow, repetition, and relevance of concepts.\nSummative Evaluation\nFive themes emerged from 341 of the participants' responses\nto open-ended questions in the summative evaluation admin-\nistered at the end of each course. The themes, subthemes, and\ncorresponding examples are shown in Table 3.\nTheme 1: Learning objectives--23.5% of comments.Partici-\npants were asked to comment on one knowledge or skill they\nlearned the most about and were planning to use in their\nclinical practice. Qualitative responses included the follow-\ning knowledge or skill areas: motivational interviewing,\npharmacological interventions, screening and assessing\ntobacco use, developing treatment plans, harm reduction, the\nglobal impact of tobacco use, advocacy and system-level\nchange, specific populations with high tobacco prevalence,\nimplementation, and facilitating smoking cessation groups.\nThe most commonly reported knowledge or skill areas were\nmotivational interviewing, pharmacological interventions,\nments, respectively). These are aligned with the learning\nobjectives of the course.\nTheme 2:Interprofessional collaboration and networking--12.1%\nof comments. Participants generally had positive comments\nin addition to suggestions for improvement related to oppor-\ntunities for interprofessional collaboration and networking\nduring the course. Overall, only 5.4% of the comments under\nthis theme indicated participants were pleased to have oppor-\ntunities to collaborate with fellow learners.\nTheme 3:Future topics of relevance--8.2% of comments.When\nwe asked participants about future cessation topics of rele-\nvance for professional development, they reported 11 con-\ntent areas, respectively: (1) mental illness and substance use\ndisorders; (2) tobacco dependence treatment; (3) tobacco\ncessation for women across the lifespan; (4) motivational\ninterviewing; (5) implementation; (6) harm reduction; (7)\nadvocacy and system-level change; (8) pharmacological\ninterventions; (9) tobacco interventions for youth and young\nadults; (10) tobacco interventions for First Nations, Inuit,\nand M\u00e9tis populations; and (11) chronic disease prevention.\nAlso, other approaches to cessation related to working with\nspecific populations such as immigrant populations and older\nadults were reported.\nTheme 4: Overall modification--37.8% of comments. The par-\nticipants' perceptions regarding overall modifications to the\ncourse were categorized into four subthemes: course content,\nwebsite function, course timing, and course support. A prom-\ninent subtheme was course content (17.2% of comments).\nThis subtheme was attributed to less repetitive evaluation\nsurveys following modules, more lengthy and knowledge-\nbased quizzes, more videos, the incorporation of live webi-\nnars to connect with participants and faculty, and more case\nstudies and interactive exercises to enhance skill\ndevelopment.\nFor the website function subtheme (11.6% of comments),\nparticipants reported some difficulties with loading the vid-\neos and navigating through the course content. Comments\nregarding course timing and scheduling (6% of comments)\ndescribed the importance of revising the module timing to\nmake it flexible for HCPs with busy schedules (e.g., having\nall modules open at the same time). Participants also\nrequested continuous access to the course materials after the\ncompletion of the course so that they could refer back to con-\ntent and use it as a reference and resource in the future. The\nfinal subtheme emerging under suggestions for improvement\nwas course support (3% of comments). Some participants\nalso commented that they were dissatisfied with the course\nregistration process.\nTheme 5: Overall satisfaction--18.4% of comments. When we\nasked participants about general comments regarding the\ntraining provided, they typically responded positively with\n1-word responses, such as \"good\" or \"excellent.\" The central\nsubthemes emerging from this section included course use-\nfulness, course support, web usability, and timing.\nMany participants described how the design and the\ndelivery of the course content were useful which included\nboth static content (e.g., resources and readings) and interac-\ntive content (e.g., videos, webinars, interprofessional col-\nlaboration, and quizzes). Course support also garnered\npositive feedback highlighting participants' satisfaction with\ncourse administrators. Web usability, including course\ndesign, ease of navigation, and loading of webpages and vid-\neos, accounted for 1.7% of comments of overall satisfaction.\nFor example, a very small number of participants (0.2% of\ncomments) stated that they would have preferred taking this\nTable 1.

Fewer comments for overall satisfaction\ncould be found under the timing subtheme (mentioned in 0.3\n% of comments).\nTEACH online Core Course content is iteratively updated\nto incorporate the latest advances and evidence-based\napproaches in tobacco cessation, in addition to HCPs' feed-\nback. However, upon reviewing the results across the four\ncohorts in 2015, there were a number of changes that needed\nto be made to enhance the learner experience and align the\ncourse with best practice approaches in adult learning. The\nTEACH online Core Course has recently undergone a major\nrevision incorporating knowledge-based and case-based\nquizzes, clinical video demonstrations, self-reflections,\nopportunities to practice clinical skills through case studies,\nand collaborative projects that require participants to work\ntogether on activities in the online environment. Course fac-\nulty are now required to provide individual and customized\nfeedback on course assessments so that participants can\nincrease their awareness of knowledge and skill areas for fur-\nther improvement. Website design and functionality has been\naddressed by providing further instructions regarding course\nnavigation, streamlining course content to reduce complex\nnavigation requirements, and ensuring that the course\ncontent is functional across a number of website browsers.\nThis revised course was launched in July 2016, and evalua-\ntion results are forthcoming.\nDiscussion\nThis study was initiated to demonstrate two goals and pro-\nvides several important and novel findings. First, this phe-\nnomenological study, through thematic analysis of 690\ncomments and emerging 10 main themes, highlights the\nimportance of employing a hybrid process of inductive and\ndeductive thematic analysis for formative and summative\nqualitative evaluations, and also highlights the importance of\ncollecting qualitative feedback (in addition to quantitative\nfeedback) for program evaluation. This article provides a\ncomprehensive understanding of the TEACH Core Course\nthrough qualitative analysis and evaluation. We found new\nlearning needs emerged during the course implementation\nphase from the participants' perspective. Using a strong\nqualitative evaluation for the TEACH online Core Course\nallows us to advance learning objectives focused on tobacco\ndependence treatment and implement research on education\noutcomes and the features that improve them, which has also\nbeen demonstrated in a meta-analysis for the effectiveness of\nonline learning.1\nProblem identification and needs assessment for the target\naudience should be administered prior to curriculum develop-\nment; however, as learners might not fully know their needs\nuntil exposed to the subject matter, and their needs may evolve\ndue to learner characteristics (e.g., discipline and years of\nexperience), recurrent needs assessments should be built into\ncourse evaluations.14-17 These important steps have been con-\nsidered through our formative and summative course evalua-\ntions. Skeff et al18 have also noted that individuals often do not\nfully appreciate their professional development needs until\nthey have been exposed to the subject area.\nThe current qualitative study could be considered as a\nmodel for determining the success of educational programs\nand used as a learner needs assessment to guide iterative\nrevisions to curriculum, the most important steps in the cur-\nriculum development and evaluation process.17 Cronbach,\nwho is one of the pioneers of the quantitative method, stated\nthat a well-designed qualitative evaluation is important and\nemphasized the significance of its application to determine\nthe success of educational programs.19\nSecond, the main themes emerging from this study are\nbased on the feedback provided by HCPs across four course\ncohorts. Given the large sample size included in this qualita-\ntive research coupled with a high response rate (96.5%), a\nwide range of participant views were captured. This high\nresponse rate demonstrates that online training and evalua-\ntion can be deployed for HCPs without compromising learner\noverall satisfaction. However, many of the HCPs who\nresponded to the qualitative evaluations may have had defi-\nnite views regarding the course they completed (e.g., either a\npositive or negative learning experience), and it is possible\nthat many of the participants who did not respond with quali-\ntative comments either did not have suggestions for improve-\nment or did not feel comfortable sharing negative feedback.\nThis result also is consistent with past literature regarding\nevaluating online training for HCPs.20\nA total of 349 comments came from the formative evalu-\nations, and five themes emerged through an inductive\napproach: (1) overall quality, (2) content, (3) evaluation, (4)\ntiming, and (5) delivery method. A total of 341 comments\ncame from the summative evaluations and were related to the\nfollowing five categories derived from a deductive approach:\n(1) learning objectives, (2) interprofessional collaboration\nand networking, (3) future topics of relevance, (4) overall\nmodification, and (5) overall satisfaction.\nNearly all of the positive comments elicited from the for-\nmative evaluation were focused on the overall quality and\ncontent of the modules, and more than 75% of the overall\nsatisfaction in the summative evaluation was related to the\ncourse content. Our findings are consistent with earlier\nresearch which indicated that learners give more feedback on\nthe overall quality and content of the curriculum than on\nother course areas.14\nThose participants who provided comments related to sug-\ngestions for improvement in the formative evaluations were\nlooking for more knowledge-based quizzes and fewer repeti-\ntive module evaluations at the end of each module. However,\ncompletion of the module evaluation was not mandatory. Our\nresults confirm that participants would like to have more vid-\neos and live webinars to increase interactivity, a technical\nsolution for loading videos, more case studies and scenario-\nbased quizzes to check knowledge retention and application,\nmore opportunities for collaboration with fellow learners,\nfeedback from facilitators regarding knowledge and skills,\nand for course designers to focus on troubleshooting issues\nassociated with video loading. Our results are consistent with\npast literature indicating that a technology-mediated course\nthat matched learners' needs can facilitate understanding of\nthe subject.20-22 Several participants reported the usefulness of\ncourse administrative support, believing that this was helpful\nin addressing any technical or logistical issues in a respectful\nand timely manner. In addition, many participants felt that\ncourse discussion boards should be actively monitored by\nfacilitators to encourage proactive conversation and provide\nfurther insight on the topics discussed by learners. This sup-\nports Boettcher's best practices23 for teaching online that\nemphasize the importance of creating a supportive online\ncourse community. In most online courses, the dialogue\nbetween faculty and participants is supported through weekly\ncoaching and reminders. To enhance dialogue between par-\nticipants in our online course, we have since added weekly\nlive webinar sessions for enhanced interaction and problem\nsolving and have added in additional discussion boards for\nreflective practice and coaching.\nParticipants also suggested that the course administrators\nshould open all the modules at once, remove time constraints\nacross the course (i.e., assignment deadlines), and continue\nto keep the course accessible after it has ended so that they\ncan refer back to content and resources at a later date.\nProviding training to HCPs that will enhance practice skills\ncan often be difficult given their competing clinical demands\nand priorities.24 E-Learning can help address some of these\nchallenges by offering more flexible timelines, eliminating\ntravel, and offering a diverse learning environment without\ncompromising leaner satisfaction.20 A very small number of\nHCPs stated that they would have preferred taking this\ncourse in a classroom-based setting.\nThere are several limitations in this study. Participants\nwere not followed up with to elicit more information about\ntheir comments. The analysis of free-text comments and\nopen-ended responses in this context did not allow for the\nopportunity to probe respondents for further detail or expla-\nnation.25 Our study did not collect demographic characteris-\ntics such as gender and ethnicity; therefore, we cannot be\ncertain that our sample is reflective of the general Ontarian\nHCP population. Despite its limitations, there are some valu-\nable conclusions to be drawn from this study. HCPs find\nTEACH to be a valuable program for tobacco dependence\nEbn Ahmady et al 9\ntreatment training. This article adds a new perspective to the\ncurrent literature regarding online courses in tobacco depen-\ndence treatment for HCPs, presents a model to evaluate\neffectiveness of online educational interventions, and pro-\nvides tailored suggestions to improve online courses which\ncan be applied in other contexts.26 To complete the cycle of\nquality improvement, these findings will inform future\ncourse iterations' development and revisions. Tracking eval-\nuation outcomes and learner feedback by developing a strong\nevaluation component to online curricula allows educators to\nadvance the science of education and increase evaluative\nresearch on education outcomes and the features that improve\nConclusion\nUsing a combined technique of inductive and deductive the-\nmatic analysis, this formative and summative qualitative\nevaluation has highlighted an approach that demonstrates\nrigor within a quality improvement research study. This pro-\ncess made it possible to describe participants' satisfaction\nwith their learning experience. Areas of strength and needed\nimprovements of the online course have been examined from\nthe perspective of HCPs through qualitative feedback col-\nlected across four course cohorts. Curriculum designers\nshould incorporate opportunities for monitoring and feed-\nback by expert facilitators to foster a supportive online learn-\ning environment. CME providers should consider the\nimportance of collecting qualitative feedback from their par-\nticipants to elicit concrete and relevant suggestions to\nimprove the experience for future learners. This qualitative\nevaluation approach can be replicated by other evaluation\nscholars and can assist them in evaluating the effectiveness\nof online educational interventions, in the context of CME\nand beyond.\nAuthors' Note\nAEA conceived and designed the study, coded the transcripts, per-\nformed data analysis, and wrote the manuscript.
