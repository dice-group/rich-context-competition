We\nexamined the association of prenatal tobacco, postnatal tobacco, and environmental lead exposure\nwith CD in children 8\u00ad15 years of age (n = 3,081). We measured prenatal tobacco exposure by par-\nent report of cigarette use during pregnancy, and postnatal tobacco using serum cotinine levels. We\nassessed lead exposure using current blood lead concentration. Parents completed the Diagnostic\nInterview Schedule for Children to determine whether their children met criteria of the Diagnostic\nand Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV) for CD.\nRESULTS: Overall, 2.06% of children met DSM-IV criteria for CD in the past year, equivalent to\n560,000 U.S. children 8\u00ad15 years of age. After adjustment, prenatal tobacco exposure was associ-\nated with increased odds for CD [odds ratio (OR) = 3.00; 95% confidence interval (CI),\n1.36\u00ad6.63]. Increased blood lead levels (fourth vs. first quartile) and serum cotinine levels (fifth vs.\n1.47\u00ad6.90) increased odds of meeting DSM-IV CD criteria. Increasing serum cotinine levels and\nblood lead levels were also associated with increased prevalence of CD symptoms (symptom count\nCONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that prenatal tobacco exposure and environmental lead expo-\nsure contribute substantially to CD in U.S. children.\nKEY WORDS: conduct disorder, cotinine, epidemiology, lead poisoning, NHANES, tobacco smoke.\nlevels than the levels currently seen; thus,\ninferences may not be directly relevant to\ncontemporary children with lower blood lead\nlevels (Dietrich et al. 2001; Needleman et al.\nhave observed associations between blood lead\nlevels below the current Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention recommended action\nlevel of 10 \u00b5g/dL and cognitive and behav-\nioral deficits (Braun et al. 2006; Lanphear\net al. 2005). It is unclear whether lower blood\nlead levels are associated with more severe\nbehavioral problems such as CD in children.\nThe purpose of this study was to provide\nan estimate of the national prevalence of CD\ndefined using DSM-IV criteria and to test the\nhypothesis that exposures to ETS and child-\nhood lead exposure were associated with CD\nin a large nationally representative sample of\nU.S. children.\nMaterials and Methods\nData source. The data for this analysis came\nfrom the National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES), conducted\ncross-sectional household survey of the non-\ninstitutionalized civilian population. NHANES\nused a complex, multistage probability sam-\npling design, with oversampling of adolescents\nlow-income persons, Mexican Americans, and\nnon-Hispanic blacks. This method of over-\nsampling allows for more valid and precise\nestimates to be derived among subgroups\nthan a simple random sampling methodology\nwould. Details regarding interviews, examina-\ntion procedures, and sample collection have\nbeen described elsewhere (National Center\nAssessment of CD. The National Institute\nof Mental Health's Diagnostic Interview\nSchedule for Children\u00adCaregiver Module\n(DISC) was used to assess for the presence of\nmental health disorders based on DSM-IV\ncriteria. The DISC is a structured diagnostic\ninterview instrument designed for use by lay\ninterviewers in clinical and epidemiologic\nstudies. Reliable versions are available in\nShaffer et al. 2000). Caregivers of children\n8\u00ad15 years of age completed the CD DISC\nmodule in English or Spanish by phone\n2\u00ad4 weeks after the child's NHANES Mobile\nExamination Center (MEC) visit, providing\ninformation about the child's CD symptoms\nover the preceding 4 weeks, 12 months, and\nlifetime. DISC algorithms were used to deter-\nmine whether the child met the criteria for\nCD diagnosis within the last 4 weeks,\n12 months, and lifetime. For this analysis, our\nprimary outcomes were meeting DSM-IV CD\ncriteria (dichotomous) and CD symptom\ncount in the preceding 12 months. Children\nmet DSM-IV CD criteria if they had three or\nmore symptoms in the preceding 12 months,\nwith at least one symptom in the preceding\n6 months. Symptom counts during the pre-\nage ranged from 0 to 12 symptoms.\nEnvironmental exposures. We used parent\nreport to measure children's exposure to\ntobacco products. Measurement of prenatal\ntobacco smoke exposure consisted of the ques-\ntion, \"Did the child's biological mother smoke\nat any time while she was pregnant with\nhim/her?\" No information on the quantity or\nbrand of cigarettes smoked during pregnancy\nwas collected.\nInformation on postnatal ETS exposure\nincluded parent report about the presence of a\nsmoker in the home, the number of packs of\ncigarettes smoked in the home, and the\nchild's serum cotinine levels. Exposure to\nhousehold ETS was assessed by asking, \"Does\nanyone who lives here smoke cigarettes, cig-\nars, or pipes anywhere inside this home?\" In\naddition, interviewers asked for the number\nof cigarettes smoked per day inside the home.\nCotinine, a metabolite of nicotine, was meas-\nured using high-performance liquid chro-\nmatography\u00adtandem mass spectrometry\n(Bernert et al. 2000). The limit of detection\nlevel. Cotinine levels > 10 ng/mL (n = 82) are\nindicative of active smoking; thus, children\nwith values above this level were excluded\nfrom all analyses (Benowitz et al. 1983).\nBlood lead concentration was determined\nby graphite furnace atomic absorption spec-\ntrophotometry (Miller et al. 1987; Parsons\n38 children had blood lead levels below this\nthreshold. We ran secondary analyses exclud-\ning children with blood lead levels  10 \u00b5g/dL\n(n = 6) to determine whether they had exces-\nsive influence on our models.\nCovariates. We examined covariates\nthought a priori to possibly confound the rela-\ntionship between CD and prenatal tobacco\nsmoke, postnatal ETS, and lead exposure.\nDemographic variables included the child's\nage, sex, race, socioeconomic status as meas-\nured by poverty-to-income ratio (PIR), and\nmother's age at child's birth (< 18 years vs.\n 18 years). PIR is the ratio of household\nincome to the poverty threshold for a family of\na given size in the respective year of the inter-\nview. PIR provides for a better measure of\nsocioeconomic status by controlling for both\nincome and household size. PIR values were\ncoded into four categories to reflect the current\nstandards used in government-financed welfare\n> 3.0). Because low birth weight and neonatal\nintensive care unit (NICU) admission may act\nas intervening variables on the causal pathway\nbetween prenatal tobacco smoke exposure and\nCD, we did not include these two variables in\nour multivariate analyses.\nStatistical analysis. We used logistic\nregression to analyze the associations among\nenvironmental, demographic, and medical\nfactors with meeting DSM-IV CD criteria in\nthe past year (yes/no). We used Poisson\nregression to analyze the association between\nchildren's symptom count in the preceding\nyear and demographic, medical, and environ-\nmental factors. We used Poisson regression\nmodels to compare the ratio of symptom\ncounts across demographic, medical, and\nenvironmental variables along with respective\nmean symptom counts within strata of these\nvariables. We did not use an offset term in\nour Poisson models.\nBecause cotinine provides a more objec-\ntive measure of ETS exposure than parent\nreport, we used it in our primary analyses.\nSerum cotinine and blood lead levels were\ncategorized into quintiles and quartiles,\nrespectively, using weighted percentages.\nWe conducted a secondary analysis to\ndetermine the effect of postnatal ETS expo-\nsure among children without prenatal tobacco\nsmoke exposure. To provide more precise\nestimates of the effect, we conducted this\nanalysis using only CD symptom counts\n(Poisson models).\nWe used logistic regression models to\ncalculate the odds of meeting DSM-IV CD cri-\nteria within each quintile of cotinine exposure\nor quartile of lead exposure, using the first\nquintile or quartile as the common referent\ngroup. We fit Poisson regression models with\nthe same quintile and quartile categorical vari-\nables that we used in logistic regression models.\nRegression diagnostics identified influen-\ntial observations, overdispersion, or collinear-\nity, and we observed no collinearity or\noverdispersion. Potential influential observa-\ntions were identified in the logistic regression\nmodels (n = 4) and Poisson regression models\n(n = 20) using standardized residuals. The\nexclusion of these outliers did not appreciably\nalter the estimates of prenatal tobacco smoke\nexposure, postnatal ETS exposure, or blood\nlead levels.

Our analyses confirm\nprior observations that prenatal tobacco smoke\nexposure is associated with disruptive behavior\ndisorders in children. We also found increases\nin the number of CD symptoms among chil-\ndren exposed to postnatal ETS. Finally, we\nfound that lead exposure, measured using blood\nlead levels, was associated with increased odds\nof CD and increased CD symptom count in\nthe past year.\nOur results are the first to use a DSM-\nIV\u00adbased instrument to assess conduct prob-\nlems in a nationally representative sample of\nU.S. children.

Estimates of\nthe prevalence of CD may differ across stud-\nies because of variations in diagnostic instru-\nment, informant, time period for assessing\npsychiatric status, and source population. As\nnoted by Lahey et al. (1999), small changes in\nthe diagnostic instrument can produce large\nchanges in the prevalence.

The difference in our results\nmay be attributable to differences in the con-\nfounders that were controlled for. Fergusson\net al.

Our\nstudy is the first to use an objective biomarker\nof tobacco smoke exposure to examine the\nassociation between postnatal ETS exposure\nand severe behavior problems among children.\nOur results indicate that a substantial pro-\nportion of children are exposed to ETS out-\nside of the home, leading to elevated serum\ncotinine levels. Previous studies have reported\nsimilar findings (Boyaci et al. 2006; Cornelius\net al. 2003). Future studies would be well\nadvised to use cotinine as a measure of ETS\nexposure in children given the high likelihood\nof exposure misclassification.\nChildren with blood lead levels  1.5 \u00b5g/dL\nhad a 8.64-fold increased odds of having met\nDSM-IV CD criteria in the past year com-\npared with children with levels from 0.2 to\n0.7 \u00b5g/dL.

However, the results of our logis-\ntic regression models were very imprecise\nbecause of the small number of cases.\nThe relationship between environmental\ntoxicant exposure and disruptive behavior dis-\norders is not surprising given the wealth of\nanimal literature showing adverse effects of\nnicotine and lead exposure on behavior (Ernst\nhas been hypothesized that tobacco smoke\nexposure elicits its neurotoxic effects through\ntwo mechanisms: a) fetal hypoxia as a result of\ncarbon monoxide exposure and b) the direct\ninteraction of nicotine with the developing\nbrain (Wakschlag et al. 2002). Exposure to\nlead has been observed to cause changes in\nneurotransmitter concentrations and neuro-\ntransmitter receptor density (Lidsky and\nSchneider 2003). Nicotine interacts with nico-\ntinic acetylcholine receptors, which are present\nin the developing fetal brain. These receptors\nare involved in the modulation of neurotrans-\nmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, and\n-amino butyric acid. Thus, prenatal nicotine\nexposure may produce secondary effects\nthrough these other systems (Ernst et al.\nnicotine exposure is associated with regional\nabnormalities in cell number and macromole-\ncule content in rats. In addition, he found that\nprenatal exposure to nicotine results in a pre-\nmature switch from cell replication to cell dif-\nferentiation.

First, the cross-sectional nature of the\ndata makes it difficult to infer causal relation-\nships. The results of our study are consistent\nwith previous birth cohorts that prospectively\ncollected exposure information (Dietrich et al.\n1992). Concurrent blood lead levels may not\nbe the optimal biomarker of a child's risk for\nlead-associated behavior problems if lead\ninduces neurotoxic effects during early devel-\nopment. However, recent studies indicate that\nconcurrent blood lead level is a stronger pre-\ndictor of lead-associated IQ decrements and\nbehavior problems than is blood lead meas-\nured during early childhood (Chen et al.\npotential source of bias in cross-sectional data\nis exposure misclassification. Mothers of chil-\ndren with behavior problems may be more\nlikely to recall gestational intake of potentially\nharmful substances, such as tobacco, owing to\na drive to identify a cause of their child's dis-\norder. On the other hand, mothers may fail\nto report prenatal and postnatal tobacco\nsmoke exposure because of social stigma (i.e.,\nsocial desirability bias) or tobacco smoke\nexposures outside of the home. We mini-\nmized the possibility that postnatal ETS\nexposures were misclassified by using cotinine\nas a marker of exposure. Prior research indi-\ncates that mothers can accurately recall gesta-\ntion intake of tobacco with sensitivities and\nAnother limitation to the NHANES data\nis that prenatal tobacco smoke exposure was\ncollected only as a dichotomous variable, and\nwe were unable to examine its relationship\nwith CD in more than two categories. This\nwould result in our effect estimate being biased\ntoward the null if the effect of prenatal tobacco\nsmoke exposure on CD diagnosis is greater at\nhigher levels of prenatal tobacco consumption.\nAlthough we were able to adjust for some\nconfounders, we were unable to adjust for\nmaternal education, family functioning, care-\ngiving environment, parenting practices,\nprenatal alcohol use, and parental psycho-\npathology. These factors tend to be associated\nwith greater exposure to environmental toxi-\ncants and greater risk for CD. NHANES does\ncollect data on maternal education and prena-\ntal alcohol use, but these data were not avail-\nable in the public-use NHANES data files. We\ndid attempt to control for many confounders\n(or their proxies) in the relationship between\nenvironmental toxicants and CD, including\nrace/ethnicity, maternal age at child's birth,\nand socioeconomic status (PIR). Still, it is\nunlikely that these confounders would have\nbeen strong enough to eliminate our observed\nassociations, given the previous literature show-\ning robust effects even after controlling for\nnumerous confounders.\nFinally, the small number of exposed cases\nin our logistic regression model created impre-\ncise estimates of the effect of lead exposure and\nlimited our ability to adequately assess for an\ninteraction between prenatal tobacco smoke\nexposure and blood lead levels. Still, the consis-\ntency of our results using the CD symptom\ncounts suggests that exposure to environmental\ntoxins may result in a shift of the symptom\ncount distribution that would result in an\nincreased number of CD-diagnosed children.\nThe reported prevalence of CD may be an\nunderestimate of the true national prevalence\nbecause we relied on parents as the infor-\nmants of CD symptoms (Loeber et al. 2000;\nShaffer et al. 2000). Many disruptive or delin-\nquent behaviors in children are not recog-\nnized by their parents. Although maternal\nand child report of CD symptoms are corre-\nlated (Burt et al. 2005), some studies found\nthat child informants were twice as likely to\nmeet the diagnostic criteria for CD compared\nwith parent or caregiver informants (Ezpeleta\nThis study confirms the previously\nobserved associations between prenatal\ntobacco smoke exposure and CD. In addition,\nthis study provides support that elevated blood\nlead levels are a risk factor for CD. Future\nresearch should be directed at confirming this\nobservation in prospective birth cohorts,\npreferably using serial biomarkers of prenatal\ntobacco smoke exposure and environmental\nlead exposure. Despite dramatic reductions in\nchildren's exposures to tobacco smoke and\nenvironmental lead, these results suggest that\nmillions of contemporary children may be\nexposed to levels of these toxicants sufficient\nto increase the risk for persistent, disruptive,\nand even violent behavior problems.\nREFERENCES\nAmerican Psychiatric Association. 2000.
