Our\nobjective was to determine if differences in income, education, and insurance, as well as differences in the prevalence\nof stroke risk factors, accounted for the association between ethnicity and stroke.\nMethods--We used data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES III), a cross-sectional sample of\nthe noninstitutionalized US population (1988\u00ad1994), and included blacks and whites aged 40 years or older with a\nself-reported stroke history. Income was assessed using a ratio of income to US Census Bureau annual poverty threshold.\nhypertension, treated diabetes, claudication, higher C-reactive protein, and inactivity; whites had a higher prevalence of\n3 risk factors: older age, myocardial infarction, and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Ethnicity was\nindependently associated with stroke after adjusting for the 8 risk factors (adjusted odds ratio, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.04 to\n1.67). Ethnicity was not independently associated with stroke after adjustment for income and income was\nCI, 0.82 to 0.95).

Self-reported ethnicity was\ncategorized as white, black, and other.\nIncome was assessed using the income to poverty threshold ratio\n(IPTR). The numerator of the IPTR is the midpoint of the self-\nreported family income category and the denominator is the US\nCensus Bureau poverty threshold for the year in which the partici-\npant was enrolled in NHANES.11 Participants were asked to sum the\nincome of all family members (eg, earnings, unemployment com-\npensation, Social Security).11 Each participant was assigned a\npoverty threshold, which varies with the number and ages of family\nmembers.11 Poverty thresholds are revised yearly to account for\ninflation; therefore, poverty threshold values adjust for changes in\ninflation between calendar years.12 Higher ratios indicate greater\nincome.\nEducational attainment was examined in years of schooling.\nInsurance status was examined using type of insurance and any\ninsurance. Because of missing values in the type of insurance\nvariable, any insurance was used in the multivariable analysis.\nEmployment was assessed by self-reported occupation and current\nemployment. Because of missing values in occupational category,\ncurrent employment was used in the multivariable modeling.\nData Analysis\nAll analyses were performed using SAS 8.2 (SAS Institute). Student\n2-sided t tests were used to compare differences between dimen-\nsional variables, 2 tests were used to compare differences between\ncategorical variables, and the Cochran\u00adArmitage test was used to\nassess trends across ordinal variables.\nMultivariable Analysis Strategy\nOur multivariable analysis strategy was developed to evaluate the\nimpact of income, education, and insurance on the stroke\u00adethnicity\nassociation and involved the following 6 steps. In step 1, we used\nforward-stepping multivariable logistic regression analysis to iden-\ntify clinical factors that were associated with stroke, excluding\nethnicity, education, insurance status, and income to poverty thresh-\nold ratio. In step 2, we used logistic regression to model stroke and\nincluded the variables that were independently associated with\nstroke (from step 1) and added ethnicity. In step 3, we used the\nmodel from step 2 (including ethnicity) and added the income to\npoverty threshold ratio. In step 4, we used the model from step 2\nand added education. In step 5, we used the model from step 2 and\nadded insurance status. In step 6, we used the model from step 3\nand added insurance status. We did not include education in step\n6 because education was not independently associated with stroke\nin step 4.\nAs part of step 1, the following stroke risk factors were evaluated:\nage, sex, history of hypertension, systolic and diastolic blood\npressures, history of myocardial infarction, claudication, congestive\nheart failure, atrial fibrillation, treated diabetes, untreated diabetes,\nglycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), insulin sensitivity, current smok-\ning, tobacco use (pack-years), alcohol use, activity, body mass index,\nwaist circumference, C-reactive protein, triglycerides, high-density\nlipoprotein cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.\nThese clinical factors were identified on the basis of clinical\njudgment and previous research. Clinical significance was accepted\nat an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 1.3 (for categorical variables) and\nstatistical significance was accepted at P0.05. Variables that were\nassociated with stroke, using both clinical and statistical significance,\nwere retained in the multivariable analyses. An events-per-variable\nMissing Values\nEthnicity, insurance status, and educational attainment were known\nfor all participants.

The proportion of patients with stroke\nwith stroke had lower educational attainment compared with\nparticipants without stroke (meanstandard deviation:\nwithout insurance were less likely to have been told by a\ndoctor that they had a stroke than participants with insurance\nrently employed participants were less likely to have a stroke\nEthnic Differences in Stroke Risk Factors\nEight clinical factors were independently associated with\nstroke: older age, history of hypertension, treated diabetes,\nclaudication, myocardial infarction, higher C-reactive pro-\ntein, lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and inactiv-\nity. Blacks had a higher prevalence of 5 factors: history of\nhypertension, treated diabetes, claudication, higher C-reactive\nprotein, and inactivity. Whites had a higher prevalence of 3\nfactors: age, myocardial infarction, and high-density lipopro-\ntein cholesterol (Table 1).\nInfluence of Income, Education, and Insurance on\nthe Ethnicity\u00adStroke Association\nTable 2 provides the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for stroke\n(adjusted for the 8 factors independently associated with\nstroke) from the multivariable analyses evaluating the role of\nincome, education, and insurance on the ethnicity\u00adstroke\nassociation.

First, given the\ncross-sectional design of the NHANES, no temporal relation-\nship can be established for the insurance\u00adstroke relationship.\nSome patients without insurance might have had a stroke and\nthen become eligible for disability insurance (thereby increas-\ning the association between insurance and stroke). Second, in\nthe US, there is a strong correlation between increasing age\nand having Medicare insurance. Given the relationship be-\ntween increasing age and stroke risk, the insurance\u00adstroke\nassociation may be confounded by age. However, because the\nmultivariable analysis included adjustment for age, this hy-\npothesis seems less plausible. Third, the insurance variable\nwe used was a crude measure (any versus no insurance) and\nmight not have adequately described a person's coverage for\nor access to health care. Fourth, patients with insurance may\nbe more likely to have a physician and consequently more\nlikely to have stroke diagnosed.\nOne additional hypothesis requires examination, specifi-\ncally that prejudice might contribute to ethnic disparities.21\nAlthough numerous studies have demonstrated ethnic dispar-\nities in stroke incidence, outcomes, and care, these studies\nhave not attributed the disparities to prejudice. Our study was\nTABLE 1.

Our results should\nbe evaluated within the context of 2 important limitations: the\nNHANES sample included noninstitutionalized participants\nand the NHANES data are cross-sectional.\nBecause NHANES includes only noninstitutionalized par-\nticipants, subjects with the most severe strokes are not likely\nto be included. Specifically those patients with stroke who\ndied from their stroke or who required skilled nursing home\ncare would not be included. Similarly, stroke survivors with\nimpaired communication skills are also not likely to have\nbeen included. Given that blacks have greater stroke severity\nand stroke mortality than whites, it is probable that NHANES\nunder-represents blacks with stroke.22,23 Our finding that\nstroke rates were similar for blacks and whites may be caused\nby this sampling method. Future research should include\nparticipants living in a variety of settings and should examine\nincident stroke to avoid excluding patients who have died.\nAnother important limitation is that because of the cross-\nsectional methodology used in NHANES, we cannot ascer-\ntain the temporal sequence of the vascular risk factors or the\nsocioeconomic status variables and stroke. For example,\nsome of the clinical factors (eg, hypertension) that were\nassociated with stroke may have been identified after the\nstroke. However, the vascular risk factors that were associ-\nated with stroke in the current study have all been associated\nwith stroke in other studies. The cross-sectional nature of the\ndata should be considered when evaluating the results that\ndescribe the association between socioeconomic status and\nstroke, because we do not know the participants' income,\ninsurance, or employment status before their stroke.\nBecause the NHANES did not include an assessment of\nwealth (eg, owning property), our evaluation of socioeco-\nnomic status was confined to income, education, insurance\nstatus, employment, and occupation.\nThe primary outcome measure in the current study was\nself-reported stroke history. Previous authors have demon-\nstrated strong agreement between self-reported stroke history\nand medical record review.24,25 For example, the question,\n\"Have you ever had a stroke?\" had a sensitivity of 95% and\nspecificity of 96% compared with a home assessment, clini-\ncian interview, and medial record review.24 However, the\nself-report stroke question used in NHANES does not discern\nstroke subtype. Ethnic differences exist in stroke subtypes\nincidence;17,26,27 however, our study is unable to examine the\nrole of socioeconomic status by stroke subtype.\nWe have described the subjects for whom the income to\npoverty threshold value was unknown. Although missing data\nmight have biased our findings, it is unlikely to have had a\nlarge effect given that the influence of the IPTR had a very\nsmall or no effect on the ORs of the 8 factors other than\nethnicity in the multivariable models. Also, our results did not\nchange after imputing the mean IPTR for missing data.\nWe included white and black NHANES participants aged\n40 years and older. Because cause and epidemiology differ\nfor stroke in young versus older patients, research that\nfocuses on stroke in adults often uses an age cutoff of 45\nyears and older.23,28,29 Given that blacks have an increased\nrisk of stroke at earlier ages than whites,30 we chose to use\n40 years age demarcation to ensure that our sample in-\ncluded adequate numbers of blacks with stroke. The 40\nyears age cutoff has been used by other studies about ethnic\ndifferences in stroke risk.2,31\nConclusions\nGiven our findings that in a group of community-dwelling\nstroke survivors, blacks had a higher prevalence of several\nTABLE 2.
