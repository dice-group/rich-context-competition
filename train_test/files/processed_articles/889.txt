Drawing upon sociological theories of social integration and social exchange, this research\nexamines two domains of social relations which are expected to influence assessed health. In addition, the study uses a\ncross-national sample (N = 3,407) of noninstitutionalized older people from the Republic of Korea, Fiji, Malaysia,\nand the Philippines to determine if modernization conditions the relationships between social relations and health.\nResults indicate that social integration has a positive effect on subjective health assessments in all nations, whereas\nsocial contributions are significant only in Korea. Findings suggest that health assessments by elders in the most\nmodernized nations appear to be much more influenced by the contributions they make to the social order than is the\ncase in nations which are less modernized.\nHEALTH has long been interpreted as a state of complete\nphysical, mental, and social well-being and not merely\nthe absence of disease or infirmity (World Health Organiza-\ntion, 1958). In order to capture this overall state of health\nreflecting morbidity, function, and well-being, researchers\nhave often turned to self-assessments of health as one of the\nmost parsimonious and reliable indicators available (Engle\nDespite the limitations inherent in a single item to measure a\ncomplex concept, it remains one of the most valuable indica-\ntors of health and predictors of health service use and\nmortality (e.g., Idler and Angel, 1990; Rakowski, Mor, and\n(1986) proposed that subjective evaluation of health is a\ncombination of both illness and role performance reflecting\nthe dominant concepts in the medical and social functioning\nmodels of health and illness.\nWhile self-assessed health continues to be widely used\nand command the attention of researchers, relatively little\nattention has been given to how social context and social\nrelations may affect health assessments. There is a substan-\ntial literature on the subject of social relations as protective\nof health, the majority of which emphasizes the finding that\nsocial support leads to better health (Berkman, 1984; Gott-\nStevens, 1992). Nevertheless, some empirical evidence has\nshown that social support may also bring negative effects to\nhealth because of ineffective \"help,\" excessive help, and\nunwanted or unpleasant interactions (Krause, 1995; Rook\nResearch on how social relations may influence health\nassessments, beyond the effects due to morbidity and func-\ntion, suggests that people who are dissatisfied with their\nsocial relations actually rate their health poorer (Auslander\nfound that extensive informal assistance may have the unin-\ntended effect of making health ratings more negative, pre-\nsumably because of the dependency in the relationship. The\nevidence is increasingly clear that social relations influence\nhealth assessments, but the mechanisms of the influence are\nstill unclear. This study seeks to contribute to our under-\nstanding of social relations and health assessments among\nolder people in two ways. First, drawing from two sociologi-\ncal theories, we examine if and how two salient dimensions\nof social relations affect health assessments. Second, while\nvirtually all studies are conducted within one country, the\npresent research is cross-cultural. Drawing from moderniza-\ntion theory, samples of elders from four Western Pacific\nnations are used to determine if social integration and social\ncontributions influence the way older people assess their\nhealth. We first consider the research literature in light of\ntwo major sociological theories and then turn to moderniza-\ntion theory for specifying anticipated effects in a cross-\ncultural context.\nTheoretical Background\nTwo theories are considered helpful for better explicating\nthe possible relationships between social relations and health\nassessments in this research: social integration and social\ngration revealed the importance of social relationships such\nas marriage, parenthood, religious involvement, and em-\nployment for promoting well-being (i.e., reducing suicide)\nby providing a sense of meaning and purpose in life.\nDurkheim pointed out that social integration creates a set of\nconstraints or controls on individual behavior such that the\ntraditional and stable rules of conduct characteristic of so-\ncially cohesive groups give members a sense of certainty and\npurpose in living. Although integration in social groups may\nnot always promote health, from this perspective, it is\nusually better to be integrated than isolated. Social integra-\ntion often leads to social support, thereby protecting the\nperson against the uncertainty and despair that may lead to\nSocial integration theory, therefore, focuses on the ways\nin which social linkages and social networks may control or\nregulate an individual's behavior or thoughts and feelings in\nways that generally promote better health or well-being.\nSocial integration, as defined by House, Umberson, and\nLandis (1988), refers to \"the existence or quantity of social\nties or relationships, which may in turn be distinguished as to\ntype (e.g., marital, kin/nonkin) andfrequency of contact. A\nperson's degree of social integration/isolation is a function\nonly of the number of relationships s/he has with other\npeople or the frequency of interaction with those people'' (p.\n302; emphasis in original). It is important from an integra-\ntion perspective to gauge the sociometric linkages individ-\nuals have, for these are seen as pivotal in shaping health and\nmorale. Previous research generally shows that structural\nproperties are important, but more consequential to health\nand well-being are the content of those relations (Krause,\n1984). For the present study, therefore, we hypothesize that\namong persons with similar levels of health status, social\nintegration will independently affect health assessments.\nAlthough social integration may have positive or negative\neffects on health, we hypothesize that social integration will\nbe associated with more favorable evaluations of health.\nThe second theoretical perspective considered is social\nexchange theory, which views social life as analogous to\neconomic transactions and shares many tenets with behav-\nioral psychology. \"Any action provides some rewards and\nentails some costs. Rewards can assume many forms includ-\ning not only money, goods, and services, but also prestige,\nstatus, and approval by others\" as people attempt to \"maxi-\nmize rewards and minimize costs\" (Michener, DeLamater,\ntheory maintains that people will establish stable relation-\nships only if they find it profitable to continue their exchange\nof goods and/or services. An individual judges the attractive-\nness of a relationship by comparing the profits it provides\nagainst the profits available in other, alternative relation-\nships. The profit available in the best alternative relationship\nis termed the individual's comparison level for alternatives\nIt is quite common that people entering advanced old age\ntend to become more dependent on others helping them with\nactivities of daily living or health maintenance functions\n(Dowd, 1975). After a lifetime of typically giving more to\nyounger persons than they received from them, elders must\nincreasingly come to accept beneficence; for parents, the\nbeneficence most often comes from children (Dowd, 1984).\nThis is difficult for many, despite the fact they have estab-\nlished a \"social credit\" from past contributions, because\nthey may have less to offer to balance the relationship. In\nother words, their growing dependency on adult children\nmay make them feel awkward. In such cases, it is possible\nthat in addition to the actual health problems influencing\nhealth assessments, the awkwardness of continually receiv-\ning beneficence without being able to contribute meaning-\nfully to social relationships may make them more negative\nabout life and their health. The key issue appears to be what\nthe older person can contribute to a relationship to foster a\nsense of reciprocity.\nWhile several studies have examined help given to the\ntowski, 1981), according to exchange theory, help given by\nelders may be more important for understanding how they\nfeel about themselves and life. If they give to the relation-\nship, they are probably more independent, but if they give\nlittle to the relationship, social dependency may be more\nlikely. Therefore, we hypothesize that among persons with\nsimilar levels of functional health status, elders who contrib-\nute more to their social networks will more positively assess\ntheir health. (There is also the possibility that high levels of\nsocial contributions may be associated with poorer health\nratings because of feelings of uncompensated exchanges.\nWe hypothesize the positive effect but will conduct two-\ntailed tests.) Although it may risk oversimplification, social\nintegration theory focuses on how structural linkages in-\nfluence outcomes, while social exchange theory focuses on\nhow contributions to the networks are consequential.\nMost of the literature on social relations and health assess-\nments comes from single-nation studies, many of them\nsurveying Americans. Still, there are other investigations\nwhich examine these issues in Canada (McDaniel and\nMcKinnon, 1993) or other developed nations such as France\nSheppard, and Andersson, 1991). Most of these studies\nshow that older people who are less integrated assess their\nhealth more negatively (Auslander and Litwin, 1991; Mul-\nlins, Sheppard, and Andersson, 1991; McDaniel and\nMcKinnon, 1993). Despite these single-nation studies, we\nare unaware of any comparative studies related to this topic.\nSocial integration theory was developed after the industrial\nrevolution, in part, because many social linkages were\nsubstantially altered by modernization. Social exchange the-\nory is even more recent, and it is conceivable that the\nutilitarian emphasis of the perspective may make its applica-\ntion more appropriate for modern societies. There is a dearth\nof research on how social relations affect health status and\nhealth assessments in less developed nations, let alone com-\nparative studies. Yet, different social and cultural contexts\nmay shape the way social relations influence health and\nhealth assessments.\nModernization theory asserted that elders' status is gener-\nally higher in the less developed nations (Cowgill, 1986;\nCowgill and Holmes, 1972) and, with the exception of\nsimple nomadic societies, some empirical research supports\nOn the other hand, there is a substantial literature from\nanthropologists, historians, and sociologists showing that\nmodernization theory oversimplified the \"plight\" of older\nadults (Haber and Gratton, 1994). For instance, the decline\nin status for older people may have actually preceded mod-\nernization and been caused by cultural change, not industri-\ntions of modernization theory for specifying causal\nmechanisms, it may be useful as a heuristic framework for\nhypothesizing associations between social relations, mod-\nernization, and orientations to health. If elders are more\nrevered in traditional cultures -- especially the Asian cul-\ntures studied here -- one might hypothesize that contribu-\ntions to the social order to maintain reciprocity will be less\nimportant in the traditional nations, where elders' status is\ngenerally higher than in modern nations. We would also\nexpect social integration to be greater in less developed\nnations and characterized by more proximate and enduring\nties. Thus, one might hypothesize that social integration in\nless developed nations will have a stronger effect on health\nassessments than would be the case in more developed\nnations. The rationale for this expectation is that people on\nthe low end of the integration distribution in traditional\nsocieties would feel slighted in comparison to their peers\n(while limited integration in modern societies may seem less\nimportant). Of course, this is an empirical question and\nintegration effects may vary by type (e.g., family vs associa-\ntions). Given the lack of previous cross-cultural research on\nthe topic, the present investigation seeks to enhance our\nunderstanding of how social relations affect health assess-\nments by considering older adults from four Western Pacific\nnations at various stages of modernization. To summarize,\nwe anticipate that social integration's effect on health assess-\nments will be stronger in traditional societies, but that the\neffect of social contributions on health assessments will be\nstronger in more modern societies.\nMETHOD\nSamples\nSocial and Health Aspects ofAging in Fiji, Korea, Malaysia\nand the Philippines, sponsored by the World Health Organi-\nzation. This cross-national survey was conducted in 1984\nand obtained interview responses from 3,577 individuals.\nAlthough the survey was conducted a decade ago, its suit-\nability for cross-national comparison and tests of social\ntheories of aging make it unique for this study.\nThe same questionnaire was used to sample older people\nliving in households in all four countries. To improve com-\nprehension and validity of the questionnaire across different\ncultures, the questionnaire for each nation was translated\ninto the language and dialect, and back-translated into En-\nglish to compare the differences and minimize problems\nassociated with cultural differences (Andrews, 1986). Dif-\nferent sampling designs were used for each country, and\nresponse rates were generally quite high -- over 90%,\nexcept for the urban Philippines sample (Metro Manila),\nwhich had a response rate of 83.5%.\nThe samples in the Republic of Korea (n = 981) and Fiji\n(n = 769) were designed to cover the entire countries and\nrandom samples were applied, while in Malaysia (n =\n1,000) the survey included only Peninsula Malaysia, where\npurposive sampling was used. In the Philippines (n = 981),\nthe Tagalog region of Luzon (21 % of the Philippine popula-\ntion) was sampled with a three-stage stratified cluster design.\nThe samples, except in Fiji, were weighted to be viewed as\nrepresentative of the populations for these areas for persons\naged 60 years and older, by sex, and by rural and urban\nEsterman and Andrews (1992) show that living arrange-\nments in the four countries are fairly similar: respondents\n\"lived in households which had an average size ranging\nfrom 5.1 persons in Malaysia to 6.0 in the Philippines\" (p.\n276). There were relatively few elders who lived alone in\nthese four countries. The percentage of elders living alone\nranges from 2.0 in both Fiji and the Philippines to 5.7 in\nMalaysia. As suggested by Esterman and Andrews (1992),\nthis is in direct contrast to the situation in most Western\nnations, where up to 60 percent of elderly people live alone.\nIn fact, elderly people in the Western Pacific region are\nalmost twice as likely to live in extended households as their\nwith a spouse, and only 13% lived with a relative other than a\nspouse [U. S. Bureau of the Census, 1991].)\nDespite the similarities in living arrangements, there is\nconsiderable variability among the four nations. Table 1\nprofiles the four nations on 11 ecological indicators reflect-\ning state of modernization. The Republic of Korea is clearly\nthe most modernized of the four, especially evident on\nindicators of energy consumption, telephones, TV, and\nphysicians per capita. The Philippines is probably the least\nmodernized of the four, with Fiji closer to the Philippines\nand Malaysia more similar to South Korea.\nThe analysis is based on a sample of 3,407 noninstitu-\nFijians, and 919 Koreans. Approximately 58 percent of all\nrespondents are female. The average age for all respondents\nis 70.24; Korean and Malaysian respondents are slightly\nolder than Filipinos and Fijians. Although three of the\nsamples were weighted to assure accurate representation,\nsome caution is warranted when combining the surveys\nbecause of bias due to different sampling designs.\nMeasures\nThe surveys asked a number of questions that were related\nto the concepts under investigation: health assessments, func-\ntional health, social integration, social contributions, and\nstatus characteristics. Except for the status characteristics,\nmultiple measures for each concept were available. The\nanalysis began by creating a series of additive indexes with\nthe items for the indexes selected based on extant research\nand theory (Fillenbaum, 1988; House, Umberson, and Lan-\nmeasures had very solid alpha reliabilities, but one of the\nthree measures of social relations had a reliability below .60\nand one below .70. Therefore, factor analyses were used to\noptimize the linear relationship among the items. The results\npresented below are derived from principal components fac-\ntor analysis with an oblique rotation, but similar results were\nalso obtained from factor analysis with unweighted least\nsquares estimation procedures. The same sets of items were\nidentified in the factor analyses as were specified a priori.\nHealth. -- A total of 13 survey questions were used to\nmeasure various dimensions of health status (Wilson and\nCleary, 1995). These included 2 questions on the subjective\nevaluation of health and 11 questions on functional health\nstatus. The first dimension of functional health, physical\nTable 1.

Responses were coded unable (0),\nable with help (1), and able without help (2). (See Fillen-\nbaum's [1988] Multidimensional Functional Assessment of\nOlder Adults). The second dimension, labeled instrumental\nADL (IADL), was denned by the following items: ability to\nget to places out of walking distance, to go shopping for food\nand clothes, and to handle money. The third dimension of\nfunctional health, sick days, was composed of two items: (1)\nhow many days respondents were so sick that they could not\ncarry on usual activities -- such as going to work or working\naround the house, and (2) how many days in the last month\nthe respondent was in a hospital for physical health prob-\nlems. The distributions for these two items were grouped\ninto five categories ranging from none (coded 5) to 22-31\ndays (coded 1). (All health items were coded so that high\nvalues reflect better health.)\nSelf-assessed health was based on two items: \"How do\nyou feel about your present health: do you feel quite\nhealthy?\" Responses were yes and no, coded 2 and 1,\nrespectively. The second question was very similar to the\nwidely used self-rating of health: How would you evaluate\nyour present health; is it: (5) very good, (4) fairly good, (3)\naverage, (2) fairly bad, (1) bad? The factor based on these\ntwo items is the dependent variable for the analysis. A\ndescription of all variables in the analyses for each country\nand the four countries together is presented in Table 2 with\nranges of variables, means, standard deviations, and factor\nloading scores where appropriate. (Factor variables are pre-\nsented in the first row of each block.)\nSocial relations. -- Seventeen indicators of social rela-\ntions were examined in the preliminary analyses. By exam-\nining the distribution for each item, the correlations among\nthe items, and properties of alternative additive indexes, a\ntotal of 10 items on social relations were selected for further\nanalyses. These were identified as indicators of three dimen-\nsions of social relations: social contributions, integration in\nvoluntary associations, and integration in family and friend\nnetworks (House, Umberson, and Landis, 1988). Additive\nindexes were created for these three domains in preliminary\nanalyses, but the index for social contributions had an alpha\nreliability less than .60. In order to optimize the linear\nrelationship among the items, factor analysis was used (the\nfactor pattern that emerged was identical to that specified\nearlier). As shown in Table 2, social contributions gauge\nhow much help an elder provided. Whereas beneficence for\nelders in these four countries is typically high, at least higher\nthan in the West, higher levels of help provided probably\nindicate a balance in exchange relations. The three items\nprobe help offered in both family and community relations.\nIntegration in voluntary associations was based on three\nitems: (1) whether the respondent belongs to a social group;\n(2) the respondent's degree of participation (a leader, active,\nsome, or no participation); and (3) whether the respondent\nbelongs to a group for elderly people. Integration with\nfamily and friends was constructed from four items: (1) how\noften the respondent attends family functions; (2) how often\nrespondent sees relatives; (3) number of people respondent\nknows well enough to visit; and (4) whether the respondent\nsees family and friends frequently enough. While the fourth\nitem is a more subjective indicator than the other three, it is\nuseful as an indicator of perceived integration. (Also, corre-\nlations between it and the other three are similar to those\namong the other three.) Missing data in small proportions on\nthe social relations indicators were recoded to the mean for\nrespondents from each country (Hertel, 1976).\nStatus characteristics. -- The measurement of other vari-\nables is fairly straightforward and is depicted in Table 2.\nEach of the status characteristics considered has been shown\nin previous research to be important in predicting health\nassessments.\nTable 2.

While Durkheim's thesis stresses the role of integra-\ntion on health and well-being, certain dimensions of health\nmay affect social integration. In particular, functional dis-\nability may limit some types of integration. Sensitivity to\nthis issue is important while interpreting the findings, but the\nfocus of this research is on how social relations affect health\nassessments after controlling for functional disability. In\naddition, careful examination of the social relations indica-\ntors shows that most are oriented to belonging or social\ncontributions based on advisory roles (e.g., family sage) and\nare not directly hinged on functional ability.\nRESULTS\nA series of hierarchical regression analyses were per-\nformed to estimate the relationships between self-assessed\nhealth and the predictor variables (Ordinary Least Squares:\nOLS). We first examine the relationships among all coun-\ntries together, including dummy variables for three of the\nfour nations. Next, we examine whether the relationships are\ndifferent across the four nations by analyzing each nation\nseparately (i.e., test for statistical interaction). Table 3\npresents unstandarized and standardized regression coef-\nficients along with both R2 and adjusted R2 values for the\nhierarchical models estimated on all countries simultane-\nously. (Although the measure of health assessment used is a\nconstruct of two items, supplementary analyses using or-\nTable 3.

Sixteen percent of the variance is\naccounted for by ADL, IADL, and sick days alone. Taking\nstatus characteristics into consideration, as shown in Model\nII, females and more educated elders are more likely to report\npositive health while there are no differences by age and\nhousehold size. Model III adds the variable measuring social\ncontributions and reveals that elders who are providing help\nto their families or communities are more likely to report\ngood health. Model IV substitutes social integration for social\ncontributions and shows that integration in voluntary associa-\ntions is nonsignificant, but integration in family and friend\nnetworks contributes to better self-assessed health. The ef-\nfects of all variables are quite similar in Model V, which\nincludes both social contributions and social integration.\nModel VI adds three dummy variables (0,1) for the\ncountries, with Korea serving as the reference group. Re-\ngression slopes for Malaysia, the Philippines, and Fiji show\nthat elders in these three nations are more likely than Korean\nelders to favorably evaluate their health status, even after\ncontrolling for all other variables. Among these three na-\ntions, respondents from the Philippines assess their health\nmost favorably followed by Malaysia and Fiji. (A glance\nback at Table 2 shows Malaysian elders with the best health\nbased on ADL, IADL, and sick days, but Filipinos assess\ntheir health more favorably in the multivariate analysis.)\nThere is little change in the effects of the independent\nvariables in Model VI, except that voluntary associations has\na weak positive effect. The findings are consistent with\nprevious research in the U.S. showing that women, the\noldest elders, and those with higher education are more\nlikely to have positive health assessments (e.g., Cockerham,\n1979). Overall, Model VI explained nearly one-fourth of the\nvariance in assessed health; the R2 value is comparable to that\nreported by others on U.S. samples (Idler and Angel, 1990;\nRakowski and Cryan, 1990; Seeman, Seeman, and Sayles,\n1985). As hypothesized, social integration and social contri-\nbutions positively affect health assessments.\nSupplementary analyses treating the indicators of social\ncontributions separately reveal that the more an elder can\nhelp to make family decisions, the more likely the elder\npositively evaluates his or her health. On the other hand,\nhelp looking after children and consultation regarding com-\nmunity problems were nonsignificant in predicting health\nassessments.\nCountry-Specific Regression Analysis\nAs the regression equation for Model VI of Table 3\nsuggests, there are differences among countries in self-\nassessed health. We can also see the difference between self-\nassessed health, functional health, voluntary associations,\nfamily and friends, and social contributions among the four\ncountries in Table 2. Therefore, country-specific OLS regres-\nsion analyses were conducted to test for different associations\nbetween the predictor variables and outcome variable for each\ncountry. Moreover, in order to see if there is interaction\nbetween countries and other predictor variables, models were\nestimated separately for each country. Rather than simply\ncomparing slopes, tests of differences of slopes (t-value) were\ncalculated according to the following formula:\nMSE\\ + SE\\\nwhere b refers to the unstandardized coefficient and SE refers\nto the standard error of b (Marascuilo and Levin, 1983, p.\n101). Table 4 presents unstandarized coefficients, standard-\nized coefficients, standard error of regression coefficients,\nand R2 values for each country. Standardized coefficients are\nprovided for interpretations within a given country but\nshould not be used for cross-national comparisons. As be-\nfore, Korea serves as a reference group for the analysis of\ndifferences in slopes.\nIn Korea, all forms of social relations affected health\nassessments and each effect is in the hypothesized direction.\nSocial relations appear to most affect the health interpreta-\ntion process in the most modernized of the four countries. As\nmentioned earlier, according to modernization theory, we\nhypothesized that contributions to the social order will be\nless important in the less developed nations and more impor-\ntant in more modernized nations. In the country-specific\nanalyses, we find that Korea, as the most modern nation in\nthe analysis, is the only nation where social contributions are\nsignificant in affecting elders' health assessments. Cultural\nimages of productivity and the ability to contribute to family\nor society apparently influence self-assessments of health\nthrough the exchange process.\nResults for Malaysia indicate that functional health status,\neducation, and interaction in voluntary associations and\nfamily and friend networks significantly affect assessed\nhealth. The t-values for age and for voluntary associations\nreflect interactions: the oldest elders in Korea are more\nfavorable in evaluating their health but this is not the case in\nMalaysia; integration in voluntary associations in Malaysia\nis negatively related to health assessments, but it is posi-\ntively related in Korea.\nThe regression model for Fiji shows that functional health\nhas a significant influence on elders' health assessments, but\nthe effect of sick days is not as strong as in Korea. Women\nand those with more education rate their health more favor-\nably. Better assessed health is also found among elders with\nhigher levels of voluntary association integration. An inter-\naction between social contributions and country suggests\nthat, unlike Koreans, social contributions do not influence\nhealth assessments among Fijian elders.\nFinally, in the Philippines, the youngest and least modern-\nized of the four countries, social contributions do not signifi-\ncantly affect health assessments. While social contributions\nhave a substantial positive effect on subjective health assess-\nments among Korean elders, no such effect is present among\nFilipinos (and the respective slopes are significantly differ-\nent). Examining other contrasts for the Philippines and\nKorea shows that IADL and age contribute less to health\nassessments in the Philippines. The only variables which\nsignificantly influence assessed health among Filipinos are\nthe functional health indicators and integration in family and\nfriend networks.\nDISCUSSION\nThis research was designed to contribute to our under-\nstanding of how social relations influence the health interpre-\ntation process. The two major aims identified were to exam-\nine (1) how two important domains of social activity affect\nself-assessed health among older adults, and (2) whether\nTable 4.

While previous research suggested the importance\nof each, most studies suggested that content of relations and\nactive contributions to relations would be more important\nundertaken, only social integration was found to be an\nimportant influence on health assessments in all countries.\nIntegration in family and friend networks aided health as-\nsessments in Malaysia, the Philippines, and Korea while\nintegration in voluntary associations had a positive effect\nonly in Fiji and Korea. Unexpectedly, voluntary association\nintegration had a slight negative effect on health assessments\nin Malaysia, perhaps because of the unique character of\nvoluntary associations oriented to needy elders there. What-\never the case, there is ample evidence of the importance of\nsocial network integration in shaping health assessments,\nconsistent with social integration theory (Durkheim, 1951\nThe significant effect is always positive for these countries\nwhen it comes to integration in family and friend networks.\nThe effects due to voluntary association integration are\ngenerally weaker, but positive in two out of the four nations\nand negative in only one. While some caution is needed\nwhen generalizing regarding modernization from just these\nfour nations, it appears that voluntary association integration\nis least consequential -- either positive or negative -- when\nthe level of modernization is low (i.e., the Philippines).\nWhile it has received previous little attention in survey\nresearch, we also considered elders' contribution to others in\nsocial exchanges. Despite hypothesizing that such contribu-\ntions would favorably influence health evaluations, this\nrelationship was observed only among people of the Repub-\nlic of Korea, the most modernized nation of the four. This\nprovides some support for social exchange theory because\nthe content of exchanges, in addition to structural properties,\nHowever, this relationship was not observed in any of the\nother, less modernized nations. Thus, it appears that contri-\nbutions to the social order are more important in modernized\nsocieties, presumably because productivity is valued more.\nIf elders contribute to exchange relationships in modern\nsocieties, their health assessments, and we may speculate\nmorale, are more favorable. On the other hand, in more\ntraditional societies, perhaps especially traditional Pacific\nand Asian societies, structural integration is sufficient to\nbolster health assessments in the face of poor functional\nhealth, and social contributions do not further aid subjective\nhealth.\nEvaluating one's health status does not occur in a social\nvacuum; and the health interpretation process is shaped not\nonly by physical health problems and status characteristics\nbut by social status, structure, and participation. The lack of\nan effect on health assessments due to contributions to the\nsocial order among three of the four countries should cer-\ntainly not be interpreted as a refutation of social exchange\ntheory. There is clearly a need for further research on how\nlevels of modernization influence health interpretations, and\nthe measures of social relations available in this survey are\nlimited. Yet, the findings presented here should temper\nassertions about the role of reciprocity when beneficence to\nelders is normative, especially in less developed countries or\neven in subcultural contexts. Structural integration was im-\nportant to health interpretations across all societies consid-\nered here, but the importance of elders actively contributing\nto the social order was consequential in the most modern\nsociety only: Korea. In summary, we hypothesized that\nmodernization should increase the impact of social contribu-\ntions on health assessments, and these results confirm that\nhypothesis. We also hypothesized that modernization should\ndecrease the impact of social integration on health assess-\nments, but there is insufficient evidence to support this\nhypothesis: integration was influential in all four countries.\nAge differences in health assessments have also attracted\nattention among researchers because they are not always\nintuitively understood. There is an emerging body of litera-\nture in the United States that the oldest members of the senior\npopulation do not always have more negative health rating\ndespite their higher levels of morbidity and functional limita-\ntion (e.g., Cockerham, Sharp, and Wilcox, 1983; Ferraro,\nstudy also finds that the oldest members of the senior\npopulation in Korea are more positive in evaluating their\nhealth after controlling for functional health status. Of\ncourse, the flip side of this interpretation is that the younger\nmembers of the elderly population are somewhat pessimistic\nin evaluating their health. As we observed this effect only\namong the Korean elders suggests, once again, that cultural\nimages constructed from productivity and retirement may be\npart of the reason researchers have observed a more negative\ntone in health interpretations among those close to, ap-\nproaching, or recently entering the \"retirement years.\"\nThis research is not without its limitations. First, for\nMalaysia and the Philippines, the surveys cover only selected\nregions of the nation whereas for Korea and Fiji, the surveys\ncover the entire country. This is not a serious flaw given the\ncomparative emphasis here and the dearth of related research,\nbut it does constrain external validity for those two nations.\nSecond, no measures of morbidity were available in the\nsurvey. While the three sets of indicators of functional health\nexplain respectable levels of variance in health assessments\n(similar to reports by Idler and Angel, 1990; Rakowski and\nhave preferred to include morbidity indicators in the analysis.\nOf course, measuring morbidity across cultures is no simple\nmatter given differences in actual morbidity as well as liter-\nacy, educational attainment, and cultural definitions of ill-\nnesses. Whereas our hypotheses focused on the role of social\nrelations, adequate measures of functional health are even\nmore important given the correlation between the two. Never-\ntheless, the absence of indicators of morbidity merits caution\nwhen interpreting the results. Third, the analysis did not\nexamine the possibility of reciprocal linkages between social\nrelations and health assessments. Although thefindingsin the\nstudy suggest that social relations have a positive effect on\nhealth assessments, it is also possible that better health leads\nto stronger social integration and social contributions. Defini-\ntive tests of such interpretations, however, are not generally\nfeasible with cross-sectional data. Fourth, because different\nsampling designs are used in the four nations, some caution is\nneeded regarding external validity. Finally, the measures of\nsocial contributions are limited. Contributions to family in-\ncome and wealth were not measured, but may be important as\nwell.\nDespite the limitations, this is the first study of which we\nare aware that examines the contributions of social relations\nto the health interpretation process in a cross-cultural frame-\nwork. The data clearly show the importance of social rela-\ntions influencing health assessments above and beyond ef-\nfects due to functional health and status characteristics.\nSocial integration has a salubrious effect in all four nations,\nbut contributions to the social order influence health assess-\nments only in the most modernized nation. The findings\nsuggest not only that social life is important to health\ninterpretation but that the social status of elders and norms of\nbeneficence, reflected in these four cultures, are also impor-\ntant when older people seek to classify their state of bodily\nfunction and overall health.\n"
