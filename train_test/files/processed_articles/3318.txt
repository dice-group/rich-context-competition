Our previous studies have shown that THL can modulate immune responseand inhibit tumor\ngrowth. In this study, we further evaluated the effect of THL on anticancer immune response in mice vaccinated with\n-ray-irradiated tumor cells. Methods. The antitumor effect of THL was determined in mice vaccinated with low-tumorigenic\nCT-26-low colon cancer cells or -ray-irradiated high-tumorigenic CT-26-high colon cancer cells. The number of natural\nkiller (NK) cells and T lymphocytes in the spleen was analyzed by flow cytometry. The tumor-killing activities of NK cells\nand cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) were analyzed by flow cytometry using YAC-1 and CT-26-high cells, respectively, as\ntarget cells. The levels of IFN-, IL-2, and TNF- were determined by ELISA. Results. THL suppressed the growth of CT-\n26-high tumor in mice previously vaccinated with low-tumorigenic CT-26-low cells or -irradiated CT-26-high cells. THL\nincreased the populations of NK cells and CD4+ T lymphocytes in the spleen and enhanced the tumor-killing activities\nof NK cells and CTL in mice vaccinated with -irradiated CT-26-high cells. THL increased the production of IFN-, IL-2,\nand TNF- in mice vaccinated with -irradiated CT-26-high cells. Conclusion. THL can enhance the antitumor immune\nresponses in mice vaccinated with killed tumor cells. These results suggest that THL may be used as a complementary\nmedicine for cancer patients previously treated with killed tumor cell vaccines, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy.\n",

Unlike CTLs, the killing by NK cells\nis not through antigen/MHC recognition. NK cells kill\nmany types of tumor cells, especially cells that have\nreduced MHC class I expression and can escape killing\nby CTLs.11 Many in vitro and in vivo studies have sug-\ngested that tumor cells are recognized as NK cell tar-\ngets.12 NK cells also act as regulatory cells to influence\nvarious other cells, such as dendritic cells, helper T-cells,\nCTLs, and B cells.13 Therefore, many studies for cancer\nimmunotherapy were focused on enhancing the activity\nof NK cells and CTLs.14\nImmunotherapy using whole tumor cell vaccines has\nbecome an alternative strategy for cancer treatment.15,16\nFor example, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating\nfactor-expressing tumor cell vaccines are very efficient in\ninducing tumor-specific immune response in mice and in\npreliminary clinical trials.17-19 In addition, -ray-irradiated\napoptotic tumor cell vaccines can induce a potent immune\nresponse in vivo probably through the cross-presentation\nof tumor antigens to CTLs by dendritic cells.20,21 Our pre-\nvious studies have shown that THL has immunomodulat-\ning activity and can modulate the antigen-stimulated\ncytokine production by T-cells.22,23 Moreover, several\nmajor ingredients of THL have been reported to be able to\nmodulate immune response.24,25 For instance, CS, RA, PG,\nand GR can increase the cytotoxic activity of murine NK\ncells. OD can increase the cytotoxic activity of murine\nCTLs. CS and GR can increase the secretion of interleukin\n(IL)-1 by murine macrophages. RA, PG, and GR can\ninduce the secretion of interferon- (IFN-) by mouse\nspleen cells. CS, OD, PU, RA, PG,AMR, LLA, and GR can\ninduce the secretion of IL-2 by mouse spleen cells.\nTogether, these results suggest that THL can modulate\nantitumor immunity in tumor-bearing mice. In this study,\nwe used -ray-irradiated apoptotic tumor cells as a vaccine\nto immunize mice and investigate whether THL could\nenhance the antitumor immunity in tumor cell\u00advaccinated\nmice. We found that THL could enhance the tumor-killing\nactivities of NK cells and CTL and increase the production\nof IFN-, IL-2, and TNF- in mice vaccinated with\n-irradiated tumor cells.\nMaterials and Methods\nCell Culture\nThe mouse colon carcinoma cell lines, CT-26 (including\nCT-26-low and CT-26-high), were established and pro-\nvided by Dr Sheng-Hong Tseng (Department of Surgery,\nNational Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan).\nTheir tumorigenicity was confirmed, as shown in Table 1.\nThese cells were routinely grown in Dulbecco's modified\nEagle medium (DMEM; GIBCO BRL Life Technologies,\nGrand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine\nserum (FBS) in 5% CO\n. The mouse lymphoma cell line,\nBRL Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% FBS in\n.\nHandling of THL\nTHL (obtained from China-Japan Feida Union Co, Ltd,\nHong Kong) is an aqueous preparation of herbal mixture\nand consists mainly of extracts from 14 Chinese medicinal\nherbs as mentioned previously. For the in vivo mice xeno-\ngraft experiment, THL (200 \u00b5L/d) was orally given to mice\ndirectly. The dose of THL for each mouse was calculated as\nfollows. The dosage of THL for a cancer patient (60 kg) is 1\nmL/kg/d.26 The given dosage (D) of THL in mice was cal-\nculated according to the Meeh-Rubner conversion formula\nbetween human and mouse: D\nmouse\n= D\nhuman\n\u00d7 (K\nmouse\n/K\nhuman\n),\nwhere K is the conversion factor (K\nmouse\nhuman\n=\nTable 1.

This dose of THL did not cause toxic effects in\nthe mice in our preliminary study.\nPreparation of Tumor Vaccines\nCT-26-high cells were irradiated with 72-Gy -rays, and\nthe viability of the irradiated cells was analyzed by prop-\nidium iodide (PI) staining and flow cytometry. The\nmajority of irradiated CT-26-high cells were found to be\ndead, and the irradiated cells were promptly inoculated\nsubcutaneously on the back of BALB/c mice (1 \u00d7 106\ncells, suspended in 100 \u00b5L of phosphate-buffered saline\n[PBS]).\nExperimental Animals\nAll animal experiments in this study were performed fol-\nlowing the Guidelines for Animal Experiments in National\nTaiwan University and were approved by the Institutional\nAnimal Care and Use Committee in College of Medicine,\nNational Taiwan University (IACUC Approval No.:\npurchased from Laboratory Animal Center at College of\nMedicine, National Taiwan University (Taipei, Taiwan)\nand given food and water ad libitum. The mice were ran-\ndomly divided into 2 groups for oral feeding with THL or\nwater (200 \u00b5L; each day) throughout the experimental\nperiod. The experimental schedule for assessing the\nimmune-enhancing effect of THL in tumor-bearing mice is\nsummarized in Figures 1A and 2A. The body weight and\ntumor size of mice were measured at different time points\nfollowing tumor implantation, and the tumor volume was\ncalculated according to the following formula: 1/2 (Length\n\u00d7 Width2).\nPreparation of Splenocytes\nSpleens were removed aseptically, placed in RPMI\nmedium, gently homogenized, and passed through a\n200-\u00b5m-mesh (Becton Dickinson Bioscience, San Jose,\nCA) to generate single-cell suspension. Erythrocytes were\nrapidly washed and lysed by the RBC lysis buffer (0.15 M\nNH\n, 0.1 mM EDTA), and the spleno-\ncytes were resuspended at a density of 1 \u00d7 107 cells/mL in\nRPMI medium.\nFlow Cytometry Analysis of NK Cells and T\nLymphocytes in Spleen\nThe lymphocytes from spleens were stained with fluores-\ncence-labeled antibodies in PBS for 30 minutes, followed\nby 3 washes with PBS, and then analyzed by flow\ncytometry (Becton Dickinson Bioscience). Fluorescence-\nlabeled antibodies against CD4, CD8a, and CD49b (pan-\nNK) were all purchased from Becton Dickinson\nBioscience.\nFigure 1.

Before the coincubation of effector and target cells,\nCFSE (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 15 minutes in\nserum-free RPMI medium, washed once, and diluted in\ncomplete RPMI or DMEM medium. In the NK killing\nassay, lymphocytes and CFSE-labeled YAC-1 cells were\ncocultured in 5-mL Falcon tubes (Becton Dickinson\nBioscience) at 25:1 or 50:1 of the effector cell versus target\ncell (E:T) ratio. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 4 hours, the\nsamples were resuspended in PI solution (0.25 \u00b5g/mL PI\nand 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS) and ana-\nlyzed by flow cytometry. The CFSE+/PI+ YAC-1 cells\nwere considered as killed target cells. In the CTL-killing\nassay, lymphocytes were stimulated in vitro with 72-Gy\n-irradiated CT-26-high cells at a 40:1 ratio (lymphocytes\nvs -irradiated CT-26-high cells) and 1 ng/mL of IL-2.\nAfter incubation for 5 days, lymphocytes and CFSE-\nlabeled viable CT-26-high cells were cocultured in 5-mL\ntion at 37\u00b0C for 4 hours, the samples were resuspended in\nPI solution and analyzed by flow cytometry. The CFSE+/\nPI+ CT-26-high cells were considered as killed target cells.\nCytokine Production by Cultured Splenocytes\nand Tumor Xenografts\nIsolated splenocytes (1 \u00d7 106/mL) from water- or THL-\ntreated mice were ex vivo stimulated with concanavalin A\n(Con A; Sigma-Aldrich, Inc, St Louis, MO) at 5 \u00b5g/mL for\n24 hours. The levels of IFN- , IL-2, and tumor necrosis\nfactor  (TNF-) secreted in the culture supernatant\nwere measured by ELISA (BioLegend, San Diego, CA).\nTo measure cytokine levels in tumor xenografts, tumor\ntissues were taken, weighed, minced, and homogenized with\n; 1 mM ethylene glycol\ntetraacetic acid (EGTA); 100 mM NaF; 1 mM Na\nVO\nglycerol; and 1\u00d7 protease inhibitor cocktail from Roche\nApplied Science). The supernatant of the homogenized sam-\nutes), and the levels of IFN-, IL-2, and TNF- in the\nsupernatant were assayed by ELISA (BioLegend).\nStatistical Analyses\nData are presented as mean \u00b1 standard error. The signifi-\ncance of the difference between groups was evaluated with\nthe Student's t-test; P < .05 was considered significant.\nResults\nTHL Suppresses Tumor Growth in Tumor\nCell\u00adVaccinated Mice\nTo investigate the antitumor activity of THL in mice, 2\nmurine CT-26 colon cancer cell lines, CT-26-low and\nFigure 2.

Subcutaneous injection of 5\ntumor formation in syngeneic BALB/c mice. In contrast, in\nmice subcutaneously injected with 3 \u00d7 106 low-tumorigenic\nCT-26-low cells, only about 50% of mice showed tumor\nformation (Table 1). We hypothesized that CT-26-low cell\nmay be used as a tumor vaccine to elicit an antitumor\nimmune response in mice. To test this possibility, we com-\npared the tumor-inducing ability of CT-26-high cells in\nmice previously injected with CT-26-low cells with that in\nmice not injected with CT-26-low cells. We found that\ninduce 100% tumor formation in mice not injected with\nCT-26-low cells previously, a much higher number (~5 \u00d7\ntumor formation in mice previously injected with CT-26-\nlow cells (data not shown). This result suggests that CT-26-\nlow cell injection may elicit antitumor immune responses\nagainst CT-26-high cells. Next, we tested whether THL\ncould suppress tumor growth in mice vaccinated with\nCT-26-low cell. To do this, mice were first injected with 3 \u00d7\ngroups: one orally fed with THL and the other orally fed\nwith water. Then 56 days later, the number of tumor-free\nmice in the THL-treated group was 12, whereas that in the\nwater-treated group was 5, indicating that administration of\nTHL reduced the frequency of tumor formation. The mice\ncells as indicated in the experimental protocol shown in\nFigure 1A. Mice were fed with either THL or water through-\nout the entire experimental period (200 \u00b5L; twice a day). At\n42 days after second tumor-cell injection, 4 out of 12 THL-\ntreated mice remained tumor free, whereas only 1 out of 5\nwater-treated mice was tumor free. The average tumor vol-\nume of THL-treated mice was about 48% that of water-\ntreated mice at 42 days after second tumor-cell injection\n(Figure 1B). These data indicate that THL can suppress\ntumor growth in tumor cell\u00advaccinated mice, and this\ntumor-suppressing activity of THL may be, at least, partly\nmediated through its ability to promote antitumor immune\nresponses.\nTo further study the enhancement of antitumor immunity\nby THL, we used -ray-irradiated CT-26-high cells to immu-\nnize syngeneic BALB/c mice. Briefly, BALB/c mice were\ncells. One week after the second injection of the -irradiated\ncells, the mice were subcutaneously injected with 5 \u00d7 106\nviable CT-26-high cells, and the growth of tumor xeno-\ngrafts was monitored and measured for 21 days (see Figure\n2A for the experimental protocol). As shown in Figure 2B,\nthe tumor growth was slower in THL-treated mice than in\nwater-treated mice. At day 21 after tumor cell implanta-\ntion, the average tumor volume of the THL-treated mice\nweight loss (Figure 2C) or other side effects, such as hair loss\nand lethargy, during the experimental period. These results fur-\nther demonstrate that THLpossesses potent tumor-suppressing\nactivity, and this antitumor activity may, at least partly, be a\nresult of its ability to enhance antitumor immune responses.\nTHL Increases NK Cell and CTL Activities in\nTumor Cell\u00adVaccinated Mice\nNK cells and CTLs represent 2 major populations of cyto-\ntoxic lymphocytes and play a vital role in antitumor\ndefense.9,10 To elucidate the mechanisms for the anticancer\nefficacy of THL in tumor cell\u00advaccinated mice, splenocytes\nwere isolated from the mice of the above experiment (see\nFigure 2), and the populations of NK cells (CD49b+) and T\nlymphocytes (CD8+ or CD4+) were analyzed by flow\ncytometry. As shown in Figures 3A and 3B, the populations\nof NK cells and CD4+ T lymphocytes were higher in the\nTHL-treated mice than in the water-treated mice. To inves-\ntigate whether the activities of NK cells and CTLs were\nincreased following the THL treatment, ex vivo assays for\ntumor cell killing by NK cells and CTLs were performed.\nAs shown in Figures 3C and 3D, the tumor-killing activities\nof NK cells and CTLs of the THL-treated mice were higher\nthan those of the water-treated mice. Together, these results\nindicate that THL may inhibit tumor growth through the\nenhancement of the NK cell and CTL activities.\nTHL Increases the Cytokine Secretion in Tumor\nCell\u00adVaccinated Mice\nCytokines, such as IFN-, IL-2, and TNF-, play an essen-\ntial role in NK cell and CTL activation. We thus investi-\ngated the effect of THL on the production of cytokines\nIFN-, IL-2, and TNF- from Con A\u00adstimulated spleno-\ncytes isolated from mice vaccinated with -irradiated\nCT-26-high cells by ELISA. As shown in Figure 4A, sple-\nnocytes isolated from the THL-treated mice produced\nhigher levels of IFN-, IL-2, and TNF- than splenocytes\nisolated from the water-fed mice. In addition, the infiltrat-\ning cytokines in tumor xenografts were also examined by\nELISA analyses. Similarly, the levels of IFN-, IL-2, and\nTNF- were higher in THL-treated tumors than in water-\ntreated tumors (Figure 4B). Together, these data indicate\nthat THL increases the production of IFN-, IL-2, and TNF-\n in tumor cell\u00advaccinated mice and suggest that THL\nmay promote the activities of NK cells and CTLs by induc-\ning cytokine production.\nDiscussion\nTHL is a Chinese herbal mixture that has been used as an\nanticancer dietary supplement for many years. It has been\nsuggested that the antitumor activity of traditional Chinese\nherbs is mediated through the augmentation of the immune\nresponses.27 It also has been reported that THL can modu-\nlate immune responses.22,23,28 However, it is still not clear\nwhether THL could suppress tumor growth through enhanc-\ning antitumor immunity. In this study, we investigated the\nimmune-enhancing activity of THL. We found that THL\ncan efficiently suppress the growth of CT-26-high tumors in\nsyngeneic BALB/c mice previously vaccinated with either\nlow tumorigenic CT-26-low cells or -irradiated CT-26-\nhigh cells. We also found that the tumor-killing activities of\nNK cells and CTLs in the THL-treated mice were signifi-\ncantly higher than those in the water-treated mice, which\nwas correlated with the increased production of cytokines,\nincluding IFN-, IL-2, and TNF-, in THL-treated mice.\nTogether, these results indicate that THL can enhance the\nantitumor immune responses.\nTo investigate the ability of THL to induce antitumor\nimmunity, we used viable low-tumorigenic CT-26-low cells\nor -irradiated CT-26-high cells as tumor vaccines to immu-\nnize syngeneic BALB/c mice. Both viable CT-26-low cells\nand -irradiated CT-26-high cells were capable of inducing\nantitumor immune responses because a much higher num-\nber of CT-26-high cells was required to induce tumor for-\nmation in mice previously injected with viable CT-26-low\ncells or -irradiated CT-26-high cells compared with mice\nnot previously injected with these cells (data not shown).\nFigure 3. Tien-Hsien liquid (THL) increased the populations and tumor-killing activities of natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic\nT lymphocytes (CTLs) in mice previously vaccinated with -irradiated CT-26-high colon cancer cells. Mice from the experiment\nin Figure 2 were killed humanely at 21 days after viable CT-26-high cell injection. The splenocytes were then isolated and used to\ndetermine the amounts and cytotoxic activities of NK cells and CTLs. The populations of NK cells (A) and T lymphocytes (B) were\ndetermined by flow cytometry. Values represent mean \u00b1 standard error (SE); n = 9 mice per group. *P < .05 versus the water-treated\ngroup. The cytotoxicities of NK cells (C) and CTLs (D) were determined by flow cytometry as described in the Methods section.\nValues represent mean \u00b1 SE; n = 6 mice per group. *P < .05 versus the water-treated group.\nThe observation that -irradiated apoptotic tumor cells can\ninduce a potent antitumor immune response in vivo has\nbeen reported before.20,21 We found that THL can effec-\ntively suppress the growth of CT-26-high tumor in mice\npreviously vaccinated with CT-26-low cells or -irradiated\nCT-26-high cells (Figures 1 and 2). This tumor-suppressing\neffect of THL is most likely mediated by its ability to\nenhance antitumor immunity in tumor cell\u00advaccinated\nFigure 4. Tien-Hsien liquid (THL) increased the level of cytokines in mice previously vaccinated with -irradiated CT-26-high\ncolon cancer cells. Mice from the experiment in Figure 2 were killed humanely at 21 days after viable CT-26-high cell injection. The\nproduction of interferon (IFN)-, interleukin (IL)-2, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- from splenocytes isolated from mice (A) and\nin tumor xenografts (B) was determined. (A) Splenocytes were cultured with 5 \u00b5g/mL concanavalin A for 24 hours, and the levels\nof IFN-, IL-2, and TNF- in the supernatant were measured by ELISA. Values represent mean \u00b1 standard error (SE); n = 6 mice\nper group. *P < .05; ***P < .001 versus the water-treated group. (B) The levels of IFN-, IL-2, and TNF- in tumor xenografts were\nmeasured by ELISA. Values represent mean \u00b1 SE; n = 4 mice per group. *P < .05 versus the water-treated group.\nmice, based on the following reasons. First, THL signifi-\ncantly increased the tumor-killing activities of NK cells and\nCTLs in tumor cell\u00advaccinated mice (Figure 3). Second,\nTHL significantly increased the secretion of IFN-, IL-2,\nand TNF- in tumor cell\u00advaccinated mice (Figure 4). Third,\nour preliminary data indicated that THL could only slightly\ninhibit the growth of CT-26-high tumor in nonvaccinated\nmice (statistically not significant). This result suggests that\nTHL's tumor-suppressing activity is largely mediated by its\nability to enhance antitumor immunity rather than by its\nability to kill CT-26-high tumor cells directly.\nOur previous studies have shown that THL has immune-\nmodulating activity and can modulate the antigen-stimulated\ncytokine production by T-cells.22,23 More recently, Kuo et al26\nreported that in a phase IIa trial, THL showed immune-modu-\nlating effects in patients with refractory metastatic breast can-\ncer. The levels of T lymphocytes (CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+),\nB lymphocytes (CD19+), and mature NK cells (CD16+/\nCD56+) in peripheral blood of THL-treated patients were\nelevated.26 In the present study, we further showed that THL\ncould increase the tumor-killing activities of CTL and NK\ncells in tumor cell\u00advaccinated mice (Figure 3). This effect of\nTHL may be derived from its ability to stimulate the produc-\ntion of IFN-, IL-2, and TNF- in tumor cell\u00advaccinated mice\n(Figure 4). IFN- is known to play a central role in the induc-\ntion of host defenses against tumors.29,30 Its antitumor effects\ncan be mediated directly through inhibition of tumor cell\ngrowth and/or indirectly by activation of CTLs, NK cells, and\nmacrophages, which are involved in innate as well as adaptive\nantitumor immune responses.31-33 IFN- also facilitates anti-\ngen processing and presentation by both the MHC class I and\nII pathways in tumor cells and antigen-presenting cells, lead-\ning to tumor recognition and subsequent destruction by\nCTLs.32-37 IL-2 has long been considered as a T-cell growth\nfactor and thought to play an important role in mediating\nclonal expansion of T-cells38-41 and in driving effector differ-\nentiation to CTLs.42,43 It can promote tumor-reactive lympho-\ncyte proliferation and cytotoxicity.38,44 TNF- is an important\neffector molecule in CTLand NK cell killing of immunogenic\ntumor cells.45-47 When expressed locally by immune cells,\nTNF- can destroy tumor blood vessels and induce the apop-\ntosis and necrosis of tumor cells.9,47 TNF- has also been\nshown to be able to inhibit the growth of tumors through the\nrecruitment of macrophages and NK cells.48 Together, these\nstudies suggest that the above cytokines may exert their anti-\ntumor activities directly through inhibiting tumor growth or\nindirectly through modulating innate as well as adaptive\nimmune responses against tumors. Our finding that THL can\nsuppress tumor growth and promote the tumor-killing activi-\nties of NK cells and CTLs may be related to its ability to stim-\nulate the secretion of IFN-, IL-2, and TNF-.\nIn addition to the immune-enhancing and tumor-sup-\npressing activities, depending on the tumor microenvironment,\ncytokines can also promote the initiation, progression, inva-\nsion, and metastasis of cancer through various mechanisms,\nincluding modulation of the immune system.49,50 For exam-\nple, TNF- has been shown to participate in the initiation,\nprogression, and metastasis of cancer.47,49 Anumber of stud-\nies also showed that IFN- may be intimately involved in\nimmunosuppressive mechanisms.51 In this study, we cannot\nexclude the possibility that cytokines stimulated by THL\nalso display tumor-promoting activities. Further investiga-\ntion is needed to clarify the exact roles of these cytokines in\nour tumor model.\nChemotherapy and radiotherapy are the major therapeutic\nmodalities commonly used for treatment of a variety of cancer\npatients. However, in many cases, chemotherapy or radiother-\napy alone cannot achieve a satisfactory therapeutic outcome\nbecause of severe adverse effects induced at therapeutic\ndoses.52 Manipulation of the immune system has been consid-\nered an alternative strategy for the prevention and cure of can-\ncers and as a promising means of suppressing tumor growth\nwithout harming the host.7,8 Here, we show that THL can\nenhance the antitumor immunity in mice previously injected\nwith -irradiated tumor cells. Both chemotherapy and radio-\ntherapy can induce tumor cell apoptosis. The tumor antigens in\nthe apoptotic cells may be processed and presented by profes-\nsional antigen-presenting cells and induce antigen-specific\nimmune response in the presence of immune-enhancing agents\nsuchasTHL.Theobservationthatherbalmixturescanenhance\nthe therapeutic efficacy of ionizing radiation and augment anti-\ntumor immune response in tumor-bearing mice has been\nreported before.53 THL has been shown to be a safe adjuvant\nregimen for patients with refractory metastatic breast cancer in\na phase IIa trial and can effectively palliate cancer-related syn-\ndromes and improve quality of life.26 It is possible that THL\ncan be used as a complementary medicine to enhance the\ntherapeutic efficacy and lower therapeutic doses of chemo-\ntherapy or radiotherapy in cancer patients. Immunotherapy\nusing -irradiated tumor cell vaccines is an alternative strategy\nenhance the therapeutic efficacy of -irradiated tumor cell vac-\ncines via augmenting antitumor immunity.\nConclusions\nTHL, a Chinese herbal mixture, has been shown to have\nvarious anticancer activities. In this study, we further show\nthat THL can suppress tumor growth in mice previously\nvaccinated with -irradiated tumor cells. This function of\nTHL may be related to its ability to enhance the tumor-\nkilling activity of NK cells and CTLs and increase the\nsecretion of IFN-, IL-2, and TNF- in mice vaccinated\nwith -irradiated tumor cells. Together, these results\nsuggest that THL may be used as a complementary\nmedicine for cancer patients previously treated with\n-irradiated apoptotic tumor cell vaccines, radiotherapy,\nor chemotherapy.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This\nwork was supported by a grant from Ching-Hsing Medical\nFoundation, Taipei, Taiwan.\nReferences\n1.
