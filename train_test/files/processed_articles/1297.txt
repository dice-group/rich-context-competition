While smoking is associated with increased levels of inflammatory\nmarkers and accelerated atherosclerosis, few studies have examined the impact of smoking\ncessation on levels of inflammatory markers. The degree and rate at which inflammation\nsubsides after smoking cessation are uncertain. It also remains unclear as to whether traditional\nrisk factors can adequately explain the observed decline in cardiovascular risk following\nsmoking cessation.\nMethods and Findings\nUsing data from 15,489 individuals who participated in the Third National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), we analyzed the association between smoking and\nsmoking cessation on levels of inflammatory markers and traditional cardiovascular risk factors.\nIn particular, we examined changes in C-reactive protein, white blood cell count, albumin, and\nfibrinogen. Inflammatory markers demonstrated a dose-dependent and temporal relationship\nto smoking and smoking cessation. Both inflammatory and traditional risk factors improved\nwith decreased intensity of smoking. With increased time since smoking cessation,\ninflammatory markers resolved more slowly than traditional cardiovascular risk factors.\nConclusion\nInflammatory markers may be more accurate indicators of atherosclerotic disease.\nInflammatory markers returned to baseline levels 5 y after smoking cessation, consistent with\nthe time frame associated with cardiovascular risk reduction observed in both the MONICA and\nNorthwick Park Heart studies. Our results suggest that the inflammatory component of\ncardiovascular disease resulting from smoking is reversible with reduced tobacco exposure and\nsmoking cessation.\nOpen access, freely available online PLoSMEDICINE\nIntroduction\nIn addition to the role of smoking in cancer initiation and\npromotion, cigarette smoking accelerates atherogenic cardi-\novascular disease in both a dose- and a duration-dependent\nmanner through several concurrent pathways. Smoking\nincites an immunologic response to vascular injury, described\nas oxidative stress leading to lipid peroxidation, endothelial\ncell dysfunction, and foam cell proliferation in the tunica\nmedia [1,2]. Smoking also enhances platelet aggregation,\nimpairs lipoprotein metabolism, depresses high-density lip-\noprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and reduces distensibility of\nCigarette smoking is associated with increased levels of\ninflammatory markers. During the acute phase of inflamma-\ntory states, there are quantifiable increases in C-reactive\nprotein, white blood cell count, and fibrinogen, and decreases\nin serum albumin [5\u00ad8]. Acute inflammatory markers have\nbeen shown to be both prognostic and predictive of future\ncardiovascular events in several populations. For example, C-\nreactive protein has been discussed extensively as a marker of\ncardiovascular disease risk [9\u00ad16].\nC-reactive protein in particular is also increasingly being\nimplicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis [17\u00ad19]. C-\nreactive protein is a pentaxin, highly conserved across species\n1b [22\u00ad25]. Previously believed to be synthesized by the liver,\nrecent evidence suggests that C-reactive protein is also\nproduced at the site of atherosclerosis by smooth muscle\ncells [17]. In the vessel wall, it induces expression of adhesion\nmolecules on endothelial cells and increases monocyte\nchemotactic protein-1, which attracts monocytes and T cells\ninto the vessel wall [26\u00ad28]. Additionally, C-reactive protein\nreduces endothelial nitric oxide synthase, upregulates the\nproatherosclerotic NF-jB pathway, enhances low-density\nlipoprotein (LDL) uptake by macrophages, which become\nfoam cells, and facilitates T-cell- and complement-mediated\nThus, C-reactive protein is increasingly described not only as\na marker of the inflammatory response, but also as a mediator\nin the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease\n[2,27]. Other inflammatory markers may also have causal\nproperties, but are not as well understood. The inflammatory\nresponse therefore not only indicates atherosclerotic poten-\ntial, but may accelerate atherosclerosis.\nSeveral studies have described a prevalent inflammatory\nstate in smokers. Despite the known impact of smoking on\ncardiovascular disease progression, few studies have exam-\nined the impact of smoking cessation on levels of inflamma-\ntory markers or on cardiovascular risk reduction [6,32]. The\nlevel to which the inflammatory response subsides following\nsmoking cessation and the rate at which the inflammatory\nresponse subsides are uncertain. Furthermore, it remains\nunclear whether traditional risk factors can adequately\nexplain the decline in cardiovascular risk following smoking\ncessation.\nUsing the Third National Health and Nutrition Examina-\ntion Survey (NHANES III), a population-based representative\nsample of United States adults, we investigated the associa-\ntion between smoking and smoking cessation and levels of\ninflammatory markers and traditional cardiovascular risk\nfactors. We examined the association between changes in the\ninflammatory markers--C-reactive protein, white blood cell\ncount, albumin, and fibrinogen--and the traditional risk\nfactors--total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides,\nsystolic blood pressure, and diabetes--with decreased smok-\ning intensity and increased time since smoking cessation. Our\nprimary objective was to investigate changes in C-reactive\nprotein in an effort to characterize the excess cardiovascular\nrisk associated with smoking and any associated decline in\nrisk with smoking cessation. We also aimed to characterize\nwhether the inflammatory markers or traditional risk factors\nexplained observed cardiac risk reduction following smoking\ncessation.\nMethods\nStudy Population\nThe NHANES III survey and data collection procedures\nhave been described in detail elsewhere [33,34]. Briefly,\nNHANES III was a national probability survey conducted\nstage, stratified cluster sampling design to obtain a repre-\nsentative sample of the non-institutionalized civilian United\nStates population. Participation included a home examina-\ntion and a visit to a mobile examination center in one of 89\nlocations. For those unable to travel to a mobile examination\ncenter, a special home visit was arranged.\nNHANES III population, we excluded 3,021 persons for\nwhom C-reactive protein levels were missing, given that this\nwas our primary marker of interest. Another 292 persons\nwere excluded because they were pregnant, and 816 people\nwere excluded because they reported cigar, pipe, snuff, or\nchewing tobacco use. Data for 15,489 persons were analyzed.\nMeasures\nSelf-reported race/ethnicity was categorized as non-His-\npanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican-American, or\nother. The self-reported poverty to income ratio, a marker\nof socioeconomic status used in multiple prior studies [35,36],\nSelf-reported clinical factors were dichotomized for anal-\nysis. Participants reported on use of non-steroidal anti-\ninflammatory drugs, estrogen replacement therapy, and\nvitamin supplements. Use of any alcohol in the past 24 h\nwas measured by dietary recall questionnaire. Prior physi-\ncian-diagnosed angina, myocardial infarction, or stroke was\ndefined as prevalent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease\n(ASCVD). Prevalent inflammatory disease was defined as the\npresence of rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, emphysema, or\nchronic bronchitis. Presence of acute illness was indicated by\na positive answer to the question: ``In the past few days have\nyou had a cough, cold, or other acute illness?''\nAdditional clinical factors were measured by a combina-\ntion of participant self-report and clinical exam and were\nalso dichotomized for analysis. Hypertension was indicated by\nuse of anti-hypertensive medication, an average systolic blood\npressure over 140 mm Hg, or an average diastolic blood\npressure over 90 mm Hg, over four readings. Diabetes\nmellitus was considered present if the participant reported\nphysician diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (excluding diagnosis\nduring pregnancy), was taking diabetes medications, had\nfasting plasma glucose over 7 mmol/l (126 mg/dl), or had non-\nSmoking and Cardiovascular Disease Risk\nfasting glucose levels over 11.1 mmol/l (200 mg/dl). Finally,\nserum cholesterol and triglyceride levels were measured\nenzymatically (Hitachi 704 analyzer, Boehringer Mannheim,\nMannheim, Germany). LDL was calculated using the Friede-\nwald equation and measured fasting triglycerides, total\ncholesterol, and HDL cholesterol. LDL cholesterol and\ntriglycerides were included as continuous variables and were\nlogarithmically transformed to approximate the normal\ncurve.\nSmoking history was categorized based on both self-report\nand serum cotinine levels. Persons who gave a history of\ncurrent smoking and/or had serum cotinine levels greater\nthan 56.8 nmol/l (10 ng/ml) were considered current smokers.\nCurrent smokers were categorized into four roughly equal\ndefined by self-report as having smoked over 100 cigarettes in\ntheir lifetime and as having quit smoking. Former smokers\nwere categorized by years since smoking cessation. Since the\nzero year since cessation point is subject to misclassification\nbias, the following levels were used in analyses: ,1, 1\u00ad3, 3\u00ad5,\n5\u00ad7, 7\u00ad9, and .9 ysince cessation. Never smokers were\ndefined by self-report and as having serum cotinine levels\nunder 56.8 nmol/l (,10 ng/ml). Passive smokers with cotinine\nlevels over 56.8 nmol/l (10 ng/ml) were categorized as smokers\nat the lowest dose-intensity level.\nOur main outcome variable, C-reactive protein, was\nmeasured using a latex-enhanced Behring Nephelometer\nAnalyzer System (Dade Behring, Deerfield, Illinois, United\nStates). Because the presence or absence, rather than the\nabsolute level, of C-reactive protein appears to be associated\nwith cardiovascular risk, we compared undetectable versus\ndetectable levels of this marker. This is consistent with\nprevious research, given the nonlinearity of C-reactive\nprotein interpretation [37,38]. Since the limit of detection\nfor the latex-enhanced nephelometry assay was 2.1 mg/l, we\ndefined undetectable as less than 2.1 mg/l. Other outcome\nvariables were treated continuously. White blood cell count\nwas determined using a fully automated Coulter S-PLUS JR\nhematology analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, California,\nUnited States). Albumin was measured using the bromocresol\npurple method. Fibrinogen was measured using a quantita-\ntive assay of clotting time compared to a known standard.\nStatistical Methods\nThe distributions of traditional risk factors, inflammatory\nmarkers, and clinical and sociodemographic factors were\nexamined by smoking status. Chi-square and analysis of\nvariance tests, as appropriate, were performed to test for\nstatistically significant differences. Variables identified as\npotential confounders by these bivariate analyses were\nincluded in multivariate models, as were the cofactors\nbelieved to be clinically relevant.\nFor multivariate analyses, our primary independent vari-\nables were smoking intensity and time since smoking\ncessation. Our primary dependent variables were the inflam-\nmatory markers--C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, white blood\ncell count, and serum albumin--and the traditional risk\nfactors--systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, triglycer-\nides, HDL, LDL, diabetes, and alcohol use. Two sets of\nmultivariate models were developed. The first set of analyses\n(minimally adjusted) were adjusted for age, sex, and race,\ngiven previously reported differences in the distribution of\ninflammatory markers in those groups. The second set of\nanalyses (fully adjusted) were adjusted for all covariates and\npotential confounders: age, sex, race, poverty to income ratio,\nbody mass index, prevalent cardiovascular disease, prevalent\ndiabetes, prevalent chronic inflammatory condition, current\nacute illness, and use of alcohol, non-steroidal anti-inflam-\nmatory medication, aspirin, and estrogen replacement.\nFor inflammatory markers and traditional risk factors that\nwere measured continuously, linear regressions were used to\nmodel the relationship to smoking intensity and time since\nsmoking cessation. Least square means were calculated. C-\nreactive protein (a dichotomous variable) was modeled with\nlogistic regression, using never smokers as the reference\ncategory. Odds ratios, however, do not approximate risk\nratios, given that the prevalence of elevated C-reactive\nprotein is over 10%.\nThe dose\u00adresponse relationship between both smoking\nintensity and time since smoking cessation and each of the\noutcomes was assessed using Mantel tests for trend. Three sets\nof tests were performed, evaluating the trends: (1) among\ncurrent smokers by cigarettes per day; (2) among former\nsmokers by time since cessation; and (3) among smokers,\nformer smokers, and non-smokers, despite the potential\nnonlinearity between groups. To further explain the relation-\nship between smoking exposure and C-reactive protein, to\nincrease the power to detect a trend, and to reduce residual\nconfounding, C-reactive protein was categorized into three\nelevated), and 10.0 mg/l (clinically significant).\nLastly, blocked group comparisons were done using\nadjusted chi-square tests. Inflammatory and traditional risk\nfactors were compared across current, former, and never\nsmokers to validate findings from previous studies.\nAll analyses were weighted to represent the total civilian,\nnon-institutionalized United States population; they are,\ntherefore, population prevalence estimates. Analyses were\nconducted in SAS (version 8.02; SAS Institute, Cary, North\nCarolina, United States) and SUDAAN (version 9.0; Research\nTriangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, North, Carolina,\nUnited States), incorporating sampling weights to account for\nnonresponse and oversampling. All analyses were conducted\nusing two-sided tests with alpha set to 0.05.\nResults\nas never smokers, 3,459 were classified as former smokers, and\n4,365 were classified as current smokers. The average time\nsince smoking cessation for former smokers was 13 y. The\naverage cotinine level for current smokers was 1,255 nmol/l\n(221 ng/ml); for both former and never smokers the average\ncotinine level was ,3 nmol/l (,0.5 ng/ml). Weighted\ndescriptive statistics are given in Table 1.\nBivariate analyses of smoking status showed that among the\ninflammatory risk factors, unadjusted C-reactive protein,\nwhite blood cell count, and fibrinogen were all significantly\nand positively associated with smoking status (p , 0.01).\nAlbumin levels were similar across smoking categories.\nAmong traditional risk factors, smokers had higher total\ncholesterol and triglycerides, but were otherwise younger,\nhad lower body mass index, and had lower blood pressure,\nSmoking and Cardiovascular Disease Risk\nand a smaller proportion were diabetic. Former smokers were\nmost likely to have prevalent atherosclerotic cardiovascular\ndisease.\nBivariate analyses of the inflammatory markers showed that\nC-reactive protein was significantly associated with older age\nblack race (p , 0.01). Serum albumin and serum fibrinogen\nshowed similarly significant associations. White cell count was\nassociated with race (p , 0.01), but not with age or sex.\nAmong traditional risk factors, analyses showed that total\ncholesterol, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol,\nand systolic blood pressure were each associated with age, sex,\nand race (all p , 0.01). Diabetes was associated with age and\nrace only (p , 0.01). Alcohol use was associated with age and\nsex only (p , 0.01). All models, therefore, were adjusted for\nage, race, and sex.\nTable 2 displays abatement of the inflammatory response\nwith (1) reduced intensity of smoking and (2) increased time\nsince smoking cessation, adjusted for age, sex, and race. C-\nreactive protein, white blood cell count, and fibrinogen were\nall positively associated with increased smoking intensity (p \n0.01) and were all significantly negatively associated with time\nsince smoking cessation (p , 0.05). Similarly, albumin showed\na negative association with intensity of smoking (p  0.01),\nbut no relationship after cessation. All acute phase reactant\ninflammatory markers had significant trends overall, from\ncurrent to former to never smokers (p  0.01) (Figure 1).\nDifferences in the traditional cardiovascular risk factors\nare shown in Table 3, adjusted for age, sex, and race. Total\nand HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, alcohol usage, and systolic\nblood pressure all showed a dose-dependent association with\nsmoking intensity (p , 0.05). Triglycerides and alcohol use\nshowed time-dependent associations with smoking cessation\n(p  0.01). Overall trends (from current to former to never\nsmokers) were present for alcohol use, triglycerides, total\ncholesterol, and HDL cholesterol, as shown in Figure 2. In\nmodels fully adjusted for all covariates (not shown), dose-\ndependent associations persisted for HDL cholesterol and\ntriglycerides (p  0.01). Both total cholesterol and triglycer-\nides showed an association with time since smoking cessation\n(p = 0.03 for both) and an overall trend from current to never\nsmokers in fully adjusted models.\nLastly, the inflammatory markers were examined in fully\nadjusted models. C-reactive protein continued to show\nabatement of the acute phase response with reduced smoking\nintensity and increased time since cessation despite adjust-\nment for covariates (Table 4). White blood cell count and\nalbumin were associated with smoking intensity but not with\ntime since cessation. All positive acute phase reactants\nshowed an associated decline from current to former to\nnever smokers in fully adjusted models (p  0.01); albumin,\nlikewise showed a significant increase (p-trend  0.01).\nAnalyses using pack-years were also done (not shown); the\nresults were unchanged using this measure. Additionally, data\nwere reanalyzed excluding those individuals with prevalent\ncardiovascular disease (not shown); results were again\nunchanged and measures of association were even slightly\nstronger. Overall, we observed the following associations: (1)\nimprovement in both inflammatory markers and traditional\nrisk factors with decreased intensity of smoking, and (2)\nTable 1.

The NHANES III\ndataset allowed us to utilize both self-reported smoking and\nserum cotinine levels to minimize misclassification error. It\nalso allowed us to control for a wide range of confounders\nand assess consistency across measures by analyzing four\nacute phase proteins and several traditional risk factors. By\nexamining both traditional risk factors and inflammatory\nmarkers of cardiovascular risk, this study contributes to the\nliterature by providing a more complete analysis with regard\nto the effects of smoking and smoking cessation.\nIt is known that after smokers give up smoking, their risk of\nmortality and future cardiac events declines [32,39], but there\nis little data quantifying the rate of risk reduction and when,\nor even whether, cardiovascular risk for former smokers\nsmoking-associated inflammatory response subsides within 5\ny after smoking cessation. This suggests that the vascular\neffects are reversible and that cardiovascular risk subsides\ngradually with reduced exposure. The time to risk factor\n``correction'' was longest with C-reactive protein; only one\ntraditional risk factor--triglycerides--showed a similar pat-\ntern. Our findings are consistent with prior studies, suggest-\ning that the full benefit of smoking cessation may be achieved\nTable 2.

Prior studies also\ndid not control for known cardiovascular risk factors, did not\nuse serum cotinine levels, did not examine the associated\nchange in inflammatory markers post-cessation, or grouped\nparticipants into broad categories of current, former, and\nnever smokers, increasing residual confounding while failing\nto explore the relative effects within each group [9,12,49].\nNevertheless, it remains unclear whether C-reactive protein's\nongoing decline in former smokers simply indicates a\nprevalent underlying burden of atherosclerotic plaque, or\n``simmering'' ongoing disease processes. The direct associa-\ntions of C-reactive protein with mortality decrement seen in\nthese other studies--and the dose\u00adresponse seen in our own\nstudy--suggest the latter.\nThree studies have systematically examined inflammatory\nmarkers following smoking: the MONICA Study (Monitoring\nTrends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Disease) [46], the\nCardiovascular Health Study (CHS) [48], and the Northwick\nPark Heart Study [45]. The Cardiovascular Health Study\nfound no association between inflammatory markers and\nsmoking status itself, although C-reactive protein was strongly\nrelated to lifetime smoking exposure as measured by pack-\nyears. Our results, while based on more complete modeling,\nsupport findings from the Northwick Park Heart Study and\nMONICA Study, both of which found that fibrinogen levels\n(adjusted only for age) reached normal levels within 5 y.\nOur study supports the hypothesis that cardiovascular risk\nfalls with inflammatory abatement, and that inflammatory\nmarkers are better indicators of such risk reduction. In this\nanalysis, triglycerides showed the strongest dose-intensity and\ntemporal trends of the traditional cardiovascular risk factors.\nThis is both consistent with prior research and not surprising\nsince the strongest association between C-reactive protein\nand lipid measures is for triglycerides. Despite the colinearity,\nthe inflammatory markers studied appear to have a much\nclearer trend and longer lasting effect after smoking cessation\nthan traditional risk factors. This would suggest their greater\nutility in being more accurate markers of disease, particularly\ngiven C-reactive protein's increasingly apparent role in the\npathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Alternative explanations\ninclude (1) the presence of multiple independent causal\npathways leading to cardiovascular disease and (2) traditional\nrisk factors correlating more closely with mortality than\nmorbidity or underlying pathophysiology. The relative value\nof novel inflammatory markers versus traditional risk factors\nLimitations of this study include measurement error from\nself-reporting, residual confounding from use of indicator\nvariables, smoking recidivism, lack of newer measures such as\ninterleukin-6 and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [52], and\nlack of data on secondhand smoke. Recent studies have\nsuggested that toxin exposures from secondhand smoke may\nimpact the biomarkers used in this study [53,54]. We\nattempted to adjust for bias in self-reporting and secondhand\nexposure by using serum cotinine levels, but residual\nconfounding may exist. It has also been suggested that\ncirculating C-reactive protein levels may not reflect all\nrelevant inflammatory effectors, owing to post-transcrip-\ntional regulation of C-reactive protein [22]. We chose C-\nreactive protein, however, for its clear role in the inflamma-\ntory response and for its increasing clinical relevance. Lastly,\nit is noteworthy that we are not using a linear scale, but\nmeasures of both intensity and duration. Time since cessation\nand cigarettes per day are distinctly different measures, and a\ndiscontinuity arises at cessation.\nFurther research should explore the acute phase response\nintervals of less than a year since cessation have not been\nassessed adequately in other studies nor in this study because\nof sample size limitations of the NHANES III data. Addition-\nally, if cardiovascular risk subsides gradually upon smoking\ncessation, do vessel wall damage and pro-aggregatory\ncascades all completely reverse course upon cessation? Future\nresearch should continue to explore the relationship between\nthe inflammatory cascade and alterations in the vessel wall\nThis and other similar studies suggest that smoking\ncessation should play a larger role in public policy. Linked\nto poverty, decreased productivity, and premature death,\ntobacco remains the second major cause of preventable death\nin the world and fourth most common risk factor for disease\nworldwide [59]. While tobacco is clearly a worldwide concern,\nstates and localities are left responsible for addressing\ntobacco use and smoking in a comprehensive manner. Our\nresults suggest that policy-makers faced with escalating\nFigure 2. Trends in Traditional Risk Factors with Smoking Intensity and\nTime since Cessation Are Given, Adjusted for Age, Sex, and Race\nSmoking and Cardiovascular Disease Risk\nhealth-care costs should look to smoking cessation as an\nopportunity to achieve both long- and short-term health-care\ncost savings through cardiovascular risk reduction [60]. If\ncardiovascular benefits are, in fact, readily attainable, there\nexists an opportunity for short-term gain from smoking\ncessation. This may be sufficient to induce policy change.\nLarger scale action is also needed. Arguments persist in the\ndeveloping world regarding the forced opening of tobacco\nmarkets as a result of the Global Agreements on Tariffs and\nTrade. Guidance may be forthcoming, however, from the\nWorld Health Organization Framework Convention on\nTobacco Control, which began operation in February 2005\nas an international treaty aimed at controlling tobacco\npackaging, marketing, and use [61]. Over 60 nation-states\nare currently parties to the Framework Convention on\nTobacco Control, including many European nations and\nJapan, although the United States has yet to approve this\ntreaty. Opportunities for tobacco control remain available,\nand it is becoming increasingly clear that smoking cessation\nmodels deserve high priority both in research and in any\npreventive health care system.\nReferences\n1.

Available: http://www.who.int/\nPatient Summary\nBackground Smoking is associated with an increased chance of getting\ncardiovascular abnormalities, such as atherosclerosis, which can lead to\nheart attacks and other illnesses. One of the ways in which smoking\ncauses damage is by causing inflammation; this inflammation can be\nmeasured by looking at the levels of various substances (such as C-\nreactive protein, white blood cells, albumin, and fibrinogen) in the blood.\nStopping smoking decreases the chances of developing cardiovascular\ndisease, and this decreased risk may be related to the levels of the\ninflammatory markers in the blood.\nWhat Did the Researchers Do? They compared the levels of the\nmarkers of inflammation measured in the blood of around 15,000 people\nwho had taken part in a National lifestyle study in the United States with\ninformation about whether these people had ever smoked and whether\nthey smoked currently.\nThe researchers found that the markers of inflammation were lowest in\nthose people who had never smoked, and decreased as the time since\nstopping smoking increased. It took five years after stopping smoking for\nthe inflammatory makers to return to normal.\nWhat Do These Findings Mean? Smoking is the second most important\ncause of death worldwide, and one of the main ways it causes death is\nthrough cardiovascular disease. This work confirms that the risk of\ncardiovascular disease does decrease after stopping smoking, and is\nmarked by changes in the levels of inflammatory markers. Encouraging\npeople to give up smoking is very important to reduce the amount of\ncardiovascular disease caused by smoking, but the markers of\ninflammation, and hence the risk of getting cardiovascular disease,\nmay take several years to return to normal.\nWhere Can I Find More Information?
