Since the 1990s, it has been broadly recog-\nnized that knowledge and expertise create the basis for com-\npetitiveness in most organizations (Camargo-Borges &\nthe private sector, the public sector is also facing the need for\nextensive structural changes, and due to the changes in the\noperational environment, there are major economic and\npolitical pressures putting emphasis on achieving better effi-\nciency. The concept of New Public Management was intro-\nduced with the aim of improving quality, increasing customer\norientation and customer satisfaction, reducing administra-\ntive costs, and increasing cost-effectiveness and productivity\nIn this article, we examine how a state of common under-\nstanding evolves via reciprocal dialogue in one public sector\norganization that went through a merger 1 year prior to this\nstudy. The organization operates under the Ministry of\nEconomy and the Employment and consists of three, previ-\nously separate, governmental offices with different areas of\nexpertise (employment and economy, transport, and environ-\nment). The head of the organization arranged a development\nproject where the personnel and management could share\ntheir views and discuss the current situation. This process\nprovided an opportunity for members of the organization and\nresearchers to reflect on the merger of the organization\ntogether. For managers, it also meant that they exposed\nthemselves to critique from the workers.\nIn this article, our focus is on the process of constructing\nthe identity of an organization. According to Foreman and\nWhetten (2002), organizational identity has become an\nestablished means of analyzing several aspects of an organi-\nzation. The momentum to study organizational identity also\nstems from the rediscovery of the relevance of meaning and\nemotion in organizational life (Albert, Ashforth, & Dutton,\n2000) that is particularly relevant in the times of fundamental\norganizational change such as a merger.\nInstead of discussing the organization's change, culture, or\nmanagement in depth (Taskinen, 2011), we concentrate on\nanalyzing the interactive processes of the organization, such as\ndialogue. For example, Scott and Lane (2000) argue that orga-\nnizational identity emerges \"from complex, dynamic, and\nreciprocal interactions among managers, organizational mem-\nbers, and other stakeholders\" (p. 44).

In other words,\nidentity ambiguity implies multiple possible interpretations\nabout which fundamental and core features should define the\nchanged organization. As members cope with and try to man-\nage the sense of ambiguity, they create meanings for the iden-\ntity from the events, actions, and discussions within the\norganization, regarding what the organization is becoming,\nand this is reflected in their speech (Corley & Gioia, 2004).\nThus, by using empirical data, we describe how members of\nthe organization move from the separate groups and disunited\npractices reflected in their speech toward joint action and a\nmore collective interpretation of their organizational identity.\nWe ask, \"How does dialogic speech evolve during the research\nprocess and how does speech reflect the construction of orga-\nnizational identity?\"\nThe theoretical viewpoint of this article is based on theo-\nries of organizational identity and professional interaction.\nThe latter manifests itself in various ways that can be classi-\nfied as different forms of interaction. Through our chosen\nconceptual framework, we want to clarify the role and sig-\nnificance of collaboration and examine dialogical interaction\nas a means of communication and relationship building, to\noutline its connection to the construction of organizational\nidentity. The roots of the notion of a collective identity of an\norganization are based mainly in the theories of James\nCooley, George. H. Mead, and Erving Goffman, on the theme\nof social identity (see Albert & Whetten, 1985). According to\nsocial identity theory, people have \"a natural tendency\" to\ncategorize themselves and others into different categories,\nsuch as organizational membership, to help them define oth-\ners in a somewhat systematic manner. This results in having\nto face issues such as individual autonomy, dependence,\nidentity and belonging, and connection (Gergen, 2009).\nIdentity and community present focal points of inquiry for\nsocial scientists interested in how we express ourselves and\nconnect with others. Simultaneously, social classification\nalso helps the individual locate or define himself or herself in\nthe social environment where he or she operates (Ashforth &\nMael, 1989). We argue that this tendency becomes particular\nnoticeable in times of change.\nIdentity of an Organization\nThere are a very limited number of studies where the con-\nstruction of identity would have been studied from a dia-\nlogue and discourse perspective. However, Hardy, Lawrence,\nand Grant (2005), who studied the relationship between dis-\ncourse and inter-organizational collaboration, argue that\ninter-organizational collaboration can be understood as the\nproduct of sets of conversations that draw on existing dis-\ncourses. While it is our understanding that it is not always\npossible or even desirable to achieve interpretations that are\neven somewhat similar across the organization, during major\norganizational changes, an organization can benefit from\nactive, conscious identity work.\nIdentity stories can be regarded as narratives that are con-\nstructed to provide meaning and closure to different phases\nin organizational life (Ashforth & Mael, 1996). This notion\nis also supported by Albert and Whetten (1985) who argue\nthat \"normally\" organizational identity seems latent, but\nwhen an organization faces a substantial need for change--\nsuch as during a merger--dimensions of organizational iden-\ntity will become salient. Ashforth and Mael (1996) also point\nout that organizational identity is most likely to be explicitly\ndiscussed during, for example, major changes. According to\nChreim (2007), the mainstream of studies dealing with merg-\ners has focused on financial implications, adopting a mana-\ngerial orientation, and emphasizing strategic decisions and\nundertakings. He continues, stating that studies have given\nmuch less attention to interpretive activities during mergers.\nOne of the aims of an organizational merger is to promote\ncollaboration and find synergies. Therefore, at a practical\nlevel, the topic is relevant, as Hardy et al. (2005) argue, col-\nlaboration has the potential to produce powerful results, and\ncollective identity is critically important in achieving effec-\ntive collaboration. They elaborate that discursive conceptu-\nalization of collective identity helps significantly in\nfacilitating understanding of the dynamics of collaboration,\nbecause it situates collective identity in the language in use\nin the organization. Hardy et al. (2005) continue by arguing\nthat this approach shifts attention from the intentions and\nattitudes of individuals to their observable linguistic prac-\ntices and the effects of those practices on social relationships\nand action. However, it is difficult to conceptualize and eval-\nuate the mode of interaction needed and desired in a new\nsituation. According to Chreim (2007), sense-making pro-\ncesses evolve in the organizational context, and their role is\nparticularly highlighted during the processes of organiza-\ntional change. How the members of an organization interpret\nissues related to change affects their commitment and their\ninvolvement in the merger process (see Puusa, 2009) and\nreflects in the way organizational members speak about the\norganization.\nFrom the narrative point of view, the identity of an orga-\nnization is constructed in different groups and different con-\ntexts (Brown, Humphreys, & Gurney, 2005; Hatch & Schultz,\n2002) and it is affected by time, social interaction, and inter-\npretations and reinterpretations by different parties. So, by\nnature it is complex, social, and changes with time. In orga-\nnization studies, collective identity was predominantly first\nintroduced by Albert and Whetten in 1985. According to\nthem, identity in an organizational context can be understood\nby analyzing the characteristics the members of the organiza-\ntion perceive as central, distinctive, and enduring when the\npast, present, and future are taken into account (Albert &\nWhetten, 1985). The way these convergent beliefs are inter-\npreted affects the way members feel and behave within the\norganization.\nM\u00f6nkk\u00f6nen and Puusa 3\nAccording to Scott and Lane (2000), organizational iden-\ntity is dynamic, reciprocal, and interactive in nature. An\nemotional element describing the intensity of how strongly\npeople believe in the unique and distinctive nature of their\norganization has also been identified as a characteristic of the\norganizational identity (Puusa, Kuittinen, & Kuusela, 2013).\nLike many other researchers, we believe that identity of\nan organization is a socially constructed, intersubjective phe-\nnomenon. According to Ashforth and Mael (1996), organiza-\ntional identity exists to the extent that people believe it does.\nThey elaborate that while identity can be regarded as a\nsocially constructed, intersubjective phenomenon, \"the\ngreater the consensus among organizational members regard-\ning the perceiver organizational identity is, and the more\nconfident are the members of the veracity of their percep-\ntions, the stronger an organizational identity is said to be\"\nHowever, at the beginning, the functionalist perspective\ndominated the conceptualization and research of organiza-\ntional identity (Gioia, 1998), and identity research only took\ninto account the perspective of the management. The basic\nassumption was that the members of the organization act\nconsistently in relation to the organization's identity.\nHowever, little by little, the perspective altered, and cur-\nrently, organizational identity is most often conceived as a\nshifting, process-like, discursively formed phenomenon\nand Humphreys (2002) consider narratives to be the fore-\nmost means of working fragmented experiences into a com-\nprehensible and coherent form. Discourses are then used as\nthe main instruments of identity construction, and personnel\ncan either adapt to or oppose, to differing degrees, the\ndemands of their organization (Kuhn, 2006). According to\nHardy et al. (2005), from a discursive perspective, a collec-\ntive identity exists as a discursive object produced in and\nthrough conversations. In other words, organization mem-\nbers collectively engage in the discursive practices that pro-\nduce and reproduce a meaningful identity for the group in\nidentity cannot be measured with all the connotations of\nmeasurement. Instead, identity at both an individual and\norganizational level may be the last refuge of the qualitative\nin a world of invading armies wielding rulers and compasses.\nAn identity may express a need for uniqueness and privacy:\nThe vast majority of researchers have adopted the view\nthat organizational identity as a phenomenon has a collective\nnature. Organizational identity refers to the answers to the\nquestions of \"who are we really as an organization\" or \"who\ndo we want to be\" (Albert & Whetten, 1985; Corley & Gioia,\nAccording toAshforth and Mael (1996), \"the quest to answer\n`Who are we?,' is a quest for the soul of the organization, for\nmeaning and justification\" (p. 29). Similarly, it is our prem-\nise that identity is a negotiated, interactional accomplishment\nthat can, but not necessarily will, be a construct of collective\nmeanings and interpretations. Identity, therefore, is a volatile\nsocial construction that bases its existence and significance\nlargely on the interpretative preferences of an organization's\nmembers, who both shape and are shaped by their organiza-\ntional membership through this dynamic dialectic process.\nThe notion of holographic identity describes a situation\nwhere there are a considerable number of shared interpreta-\ntions and a significant degree of collective understanding of\norganizational identity across the organization (Albert &\nzations, in turn, individuals display subunit-specific identi-\nties (Ashforth & Mael, 1989). While the meaning and\nimplications of it remain unresolved, the idea of multiple\nidentity organizations has been presented by numerous orga-\nnizational identity researchers (Albert & Whetten, 1985;\nLane, 2000). Thus, as is typical for individuals, organiza-\ntions, particularly developing organizations, can also acquire\nmultiple identities (Albert & Whetten, 1985). Therefore,\nAshforth and Mael (1996) argue that organizations are per-\npetually in \"the process of becoming, occasionally in an\nuneven state of it\" (p. 26).\nAs Bakhtin (1978) wrote, people create their notion of\ntruth together with others via communication and social\ninteraction processes where our experiences, new thoughts,\nand emotions are filtered through our surroundings. In addi-\ntion, Shotter (1993) has argued that identity should not be\ndealt only as an individual information processing system\nwithout understanding its social context. This idea is high-\nlighted in the concept of dialogue: In an organizational con-\ntext, it emphasizes the relevance and meaning of reciprocal,\nmultivoiced interaction. According to Nonaka, Toyama, and\nKonno (2000), there is still very little understanding of how\norganizations actually create and manage knowledge dynam-\nically, or how the processes of constructing a shared under-\nstandinginregardtoanorganization'sdefiningcharacteristics\nFive Forms of Organizational Discourse\nThe dialogical aspect of workplace communication and man-\nagement and the capacity for dialogical interaction are\nincreasingly perceived to be important parts of work compe-\ntence in the future (Haslam, Reicher, & Platow, 2010; Isaacs,\n1999). Dialogical interaction can be seen from two points of\nview: first, as a means of communication and a way to build\ncommon understanding with each other, and second, as a\nmeansofbuildingcollaborationandrapport(seeAvtonomova,\nSociologist Carl J. Couch's (1986) theory of cooperative\naction is based on five elements of interaction, \"acknowledged\nattentiveness, mutual responsiveness, congruent functional\n4 SAGE Open\nidentities, shared focus and social objective\" (pp. 116-119),\nwhen focusing on behavior in small-group situations.\nCouch's theory in the context of working community places\nand client work, and renamed these elements the five hierar-\nchical forms of interaction: presence in situation, social influ-\nence, game, cooperation, and collaboration. However, these\nforms should not be seen as fixed and permanent but as inter-\nactions that involve movement in different forms, and from\ntime to time, some discourse may be more dominant than oth-\ners (see Markov\u00e1 & Gillespie, 2007). As presented in this\narticle, we have analyzed our data by using a modification of\nthe forms presented by the first author and argue that in an\norganizational context, reaching \"cooperation and collabora-\ntion\" can be regarded as desirable and as an indicator of a form\nin which the construction of a more collectively shared under-\nstanding of identity has been reached through the process of\ndialogue.\nIn the first form, presence in the situation, people acknowl-\nedge the presence of others but have little to no contact with\neach other. People behave very formally, and do not share\nthings or tasks with one another. This reflects a kind of cul-\nture where people work individually, groups work in sepa-\nrate silos, tasks are not shared with others, and a common\ngoal is missing. In group theories, this form is not seen as\ngroup work at all. Individuals focus on their own tasks, rather\nthanontheissuesofthegrouportheorganization(Engestr\u00f6m,\nThe second form is one-sided social influence. In this\nform, interaction can be unidirectional when one participant\nhas power over a group or another individual in an interac-\nple, the group leader determines the dynamics of the\ninteraction while the others have the role of follower. In such\na case, the communication is asymmetrical and the element\nof power is obvious, creating room for the element of unpre-\ndictability. According to Couch (1986), in power interac-\ntions, asymmetry occurs when the opinions of the others are\nonly \"counted\" in. The relevance of good interaction and\nparticipation are recognized and dealt with in official dis-\ncourse, but in reality, internal control and unidirectional\nCouch (1986) also brings up the fact that in a power relation-\nship, there is an element of unpredictability, because the ele-\nment of asymmetry of power is obvious. In the organizational\ncontext, strong critique of the traditional management of the\norganization is reflected in this form as well.\nThe third form of interaction is termed game. In this form,\nrivalry between people or teams is apparent. The participants\ndo not have a shared focus, they compete for resources, and\nconsequently, the idea of common organization does not\nexist or is lost (see Couch, 1986). Members of an organiza-\ntion may share a common goal, but they do not collaborate in\nachieving it. Instead, each party focuses on winning the game\n(Maxwell, 2002). In the context of organizational change,\nthis can be detected in the form of different kinds of tensions,\nsuch as defense and frustration, and working in isolated silos\n(Yankelovich, 2001). Competition is often evident in the\nearly phases of an organizational fusion process when a per-\nson's role in the bigger corporation cannot yet be identified.\nThe fourth form of interaction, cooperation, differs from\nthe previous ones due to its inclusion of shared focus and tar-\ngets, which are achieved through mutual contracts between\nworkers. In this form, the role of control is to ensure that the\ngoals are achieved. This form has been described as team\nwork, group work, or with the definitions of cooperation in\ngeneral (Leonard, Graham, & Bonacum., 2004). This cannot\nyet be classed as collaboration because trust and common\neration, challenges and targets are shared, and the workers,\ninstead of promoting their own interests, start to share ideas\nand thoughts, as well as produce solutions to common prob-\nlems. This approach has also been used to describe multidisci-\nplinarity and multiprofessionality (Mikkeli & Pakkasvirta,\n2007). Multidisciplinarity gathers different disciplines\ntogether, and research focuses on the same theme. However,\nthe disciplines still operate as traditional, separate disciplines.\nInterdisciplinarity, in turn, assimilates different perspectives\nand creates totally new approaches.\nFinally, we argue that cooperation is a phenomenon that\nhas antecedents that can be very ambiguous, complex, and\nabstract by nature. It is thus recognized that cooperation\namong participants, such as organizational members, cannot\nbe secured, for example, through hierarchical authority or\nforms of control. Instead, it is dependent on the relationships\namong participating members. The relationships, in turn, are\nbeing negotiated on an ongoing basis throughout the life of\nThe fifth form is collaboration. There are a variety of defi-\nnitions for collaboration and thus among researchers there is\nlittle agreement as to how the concept should be defined\n(Hardy et al., 2005). In this article, the collaboration stage is\nassociated with confidence, which diminishes the need for\ncontrol. The discourse within the organization in general is\nalso more future oriented. At this level, there is trust and\ncommitment between workers, and every member of the\nteam contributes to the overall whole (see Engestr\u00f6m, 1992;\nare outlined generally in a productive team-building process\nwith a common task, cooperation, and team spirit, thus com-\nbining team productivity with personal productivity (see\nJohnson & Johnson, 2012). In the organizational context, we\nlook at these points only in terms of how the informants\ndescribe their relationship with others. In this form, interac-\ntion is based on a genuine dialogue.\nThe term dialogue originates from words \"dia\" and\n\"logos,\" and their combination is described as \"joint accu-\nmulation of the world.\" The theoretical background of dia-\nlogue research is based on the work of Mikhail Bhakti and\nM\u00f6nkk\u00f6nen and Puusa 5\nLev Vygotsky. All researchers of dialogue share a view of\nintersubjectivity in human life and social interaction (e.g.,\ncess with the aim of advancing collective understanding\namong an organization's members (Puusa, M\u00f6nkk\u00f6nen, &\nbe delving more deeply into the theoretical base of dialogue;\ninstead, we will only be discussing it in regard to its role as\nan important part of collaboration.\nIn Table 1, we outline the interconnectedness of organiza-\ntional identity and elements of interaction. In the section that\nfollows, we take our theoretical analysis further using the\nempirical data.\nMethod and Data\nThis is a qualitative case study in which the aim is to under-\nstand the target phenomenon by analyzing textual data\nological and therefore epistemological choices are premised\non social constructionism, which emphasizes the idea that\nthe social world is a subjective construction created by indi-\nviduals who, through the use of language and interactions,\nare able to create and sustain a social world of shared mean-\nrapid transformations in work environments, social con-\nstructionism is a useful approach to investigate change in\norganizations. There have also been ethical implications that\nhave caused a move away from expert-based, hierarchical,\nand result-focused studies, to more participatory, co-cre-\native, and process-centered ones (Camargo-Borges &\nBillig et al. (1988) have criticized studies that attempt to\nsimplify people's argumentation into a measurable attitude\nor an opinion, ignoring the context of the argumentation and\nlooking only for universal patterns of thinking. There are\nmany social phenomena that cannot be turned into statistical\nmeasures (Markov\u00e1 & Gillespie, 2007), in addition to which,\norganizations are very complex and phenomena should be\nseen more as \"wicked\" problems than \"tame\" problems,\nwhich are easily resolved after diagnosis (Rittel & Webber,\ndialogue- and discourse-oriented studies of organizational\nidentity focus on the processes through which a collective\nidentity is produced via the creation of texts. The attention is\nfocused on the constructive effects of conversations in which\nparticipants describe themselves as a collective. Therefore,\nwe identified collectively shared discourses (if and when\nthey appeared) in the data to describe the section regarding\nconstruction of organizational identity. Because organiza-\ntions are polyphonic, the description and analysis of evolv-\ning narratives is relevant. We chose a narrative approach; the\nresearch departs from the notion that through free argumen-\ntation, the participants fumble their way toward an attitude\nbroadly regarded as a way of knowing, a nature of knowl-\nedge, research data, analysis of data, or the practical meaning\nThe data were gathered during a 1-year process, and the\ntextual data were gathered five times during the year. Initially,\nwe asked the participants to describe their experience of the\nprevious organization (before the merger). After the analysis,\nwe arranged the first joint seminar where the analysis was\npresented and then discussed openly. The dialogues between\nus as researchers and the participants were recorded and later\nused as a basis for the subsequent data collections. After the\nfirst stage, we collected four more sets of data and organized\nfive seminars in between the data collections. The questions\nincluded themes on topics such as \"who we are as an organi-\nzation\" and \"where are we going.\" Altogether, during 1 year,\norganization members. The total number of employees was\nduring each of the five phases of the research process. For\nqualitative study, the data are sufficiently comprehensive.\nThe respondents were professionals, managers, and adminis-\ntrative personnel. On the basis of these free-form written\ncomments, we examined how a merger is discussed in gen-\neral terms. After this, we itemized the sections in the com-\nments where various interactions appear, after which the\nTable 1.

Due to the long process, combined with the participa-\ntory element, the research process featured many elements\ntraditionally linked to action research (Graumann, 1992;\nWhen the identity of an organization is just forming,\ndefense of one's own territory and maintenance of differ-\nent (structural or imaginary) borders are apparent, but as\nthe process proceeds, the borders become less relevant and\nthe sense of a mutual organization starts to dominate (see\ncould be seen as a natural part of constructing identity and\nargumentation. Common sense provides the individual\nwith the seeds for contrary themes, which can conflict in\ndilemmatic situations. Based on this, we wanted to deal\nwith the data as constructive, unfinished argumentation\nabout their organization. Using textual analysis, we have\noutlined the construction process for collective identity\nthrough the five forms of interaction (M\u00f6nkk\u00f6nen 2002,\nIn the following section, we describe how interaction with\nothers is constructed just after the merger and how it evolves\nin time. We analyze, as previously framed by the first author,\nhow the different forms of interaction--(a) formally together,\n(b) unidirectional interaction, (c) juxtapositions, (d) con-\nstruction of commonality, and (e) state of joint action--are\npresent in our data. Although these forms of interaction are\ndescribed as linear steps, it is important to note that all forms\nof interaction were partly present throughout the whole pro-\ncess of the merger, due to the individual differences of the\nresearch participants.\nThe quotes are marked with the letter E, referring to an\nemployee, or the letter M, referring to a manager.\nResults\nForms of Interaction\nFormally together. It was very apparent in our data that all the\nmembers who used to belong to different, \"old\" offices felt\nthat communality and solidarity used to be better there. They\nalso felt more satisfied with the management previously, and\nfelt that the managers and employees used to be more tightly\nconnected to one another. This was seen, for example, in the\nfollowing ways:\nThe organization where we were before was an open\ncommunity in which people shared common knowledge about\nwhat was going on. The meaning of the work was clear, and\nour work was respected. Administration was fluent, the unity\nof the organization was apparent without distinction between\n\"us\" and \"them.\" (E)\nOur old organization was not as bureaucratic a community as the\ncurrent one is, and there was an atmosphere where everyone\nhad the opportunity to participate, and real democracy was\nimplemented. It was a team-based organization with a low\ndegree of hierarchy. (E)\nThe managers also had positive feelings on the previous\norganization. One manager, for example, stated that \"the\nmission was clear and employees were motivated . . . now\nthe future perspectives are much more unclear.\" The com-\nparisons with the new, current entity were presented in a very\nblack and white manner: The old organization was perceived\nvery positively whereas the new organization as a whole\naroused confusion and suspicion. This phenomenon has been\nidentified in prior studies: The past is seen in a romantic\nlight. For example, Bakhtin (1978) wrote that the past is usu-\nally seen as a paradise where life was much easier and more\nnatural; people feel the need to hang on to the past and pro-\ntect the interests they feel might be under threat. The actual\nchallenge is whether an organization is able to overcome this\nstage and direct efforts toward accepting and building a new\norganization.\nAccording to the data, the members of the organization\ncollectively felt a lack of common goals. This was due to not\nknowing others and the work they do. The new organization\nconsisted of two previously separate offices with different\nareas of expertise; therefore, the connection between both\nissues and people was interpreted as being very shallow and\nformal. This became evident when analyzing comments that\nstated how members of the different units questioned the\nneed for the organizational merger in the first place and\nregarded the new entity as artificial. There was \"no common\nground,\" and the large physical distance between offices pre-\nserved that perception. A feeling of separation and being in\ntheir own silos, as well as a lack of a common goal were\ndominant in discourse at the beginning of the process.\nWe hardly know each other and what kind work is being done in\nthe other offices . . . we have not been introduced to other people\nor the work they do. (E)\nWe still potter about in our own \"foxholes.\" Common interfaces\nhave been sought in the area of substance, but none have been\nfound as far I understand . . . we have conflicting goals . . . What\nis the common target then? (M)\nIt's no use putting tasks together by force . . . I wouldn't put all\ntasks in the same category. Flexibility is necessary from\nmanagers as well, not only workers. (E)\nThis stage as a whole was characterized by many juxtapo-\nsitions between teams, units, and professional areas, as well\nas between the management and personnel, with a belief that\nwhat occurred was inevitable and could be explained by the\norganizational merger. Ashforth and Mael (1989) have\nargued that the salience, stability, and internal consistency of\nidentity affect the internalization of it. According to our\ninterpretation, organizational identity at this point was very\nfragmented (Sveningsson & Alvesson, 2003). At the same\nM\u00f6nkk\u00f6nen and Puusa 7\ntime, the personnel highlighted that a common organization\ncan be created only when people get to know each other,\nunderstand and value what others do, and give up maintain-\ning artificial boundaries based on prejudice and the old\norganizations.\nUnidirectional interaction. In particular, at the beginning of the\nresearch process, the texts included a lot of critique toward\nthe management and their \"traditional management style.\"\nThe critique by the managers in turn was targeted to top man-\nagement and the steering ministry. The amount and quality of\nadministrative regulations were seen as a problem.\nIn the process of building a new organization, a lot of\ncommunication and different arenas for communication are\nneeded. However, the organization members perceived col-\nlective meetings as a means for the management to give one-\nway information about current issues. The meetings were\ninterpreted as having failed somewhat in making sense of the\norganizational merger, or creating trust between personnel\nand management or between different units. On the contrary,\nfeelings of mistrust and control seemed to strengthen:\nThere's a feeling that we are all doing our work without\nresponsibility and there are many methods being used to control\nthe personnel. (E)\nWe employees are afraid of making any decisions without the\napproval from our superiors nowadays. They announced to us\nthat the change was taking place but we are the ones left carrying\nit through. Discussions with my superior are one-sided\nmonologues where he sets the boundaries and timetables in a\nvery authoritarian manner. There is no trust! (E)\nAll throughout the research process, there was criticism\ndirected toward the traditional, control-based management\nstyle, which was also interpreted as a typical characteristic of\npublic sector management. In addition to this, the partici-\npants felt that a constant reduction of resources while inten-\nsifying demands and expectations in terms of performance\nresulted in passivity, leading to a situation where workers\nonly did the bare minimum. This was described, for example,\nin the following ways:\nIt's micro-managing, small details are the focus, minor issues\nare being controlled. (E)\nThere are times when the demands and expectations from the\nmanagement seem very unreasonable--Sometimes I feel like\nI'm in an army. (E)\nDon't keep the leash too tight . . . otherwise the workers do only\nthe minimum. (E)\nAlong with the increasing element of control, the partici-\npants also felt that bureaucracy had increased. This discus-\nsion was interestingly dilemmatic (Billig et al., 1988). On\none hand, top\u00addown steering from management was criti-\ncized, while on the other hand, the need for common rules\nwas accepted, as it was perceived as ensuring fairness and\nequity:\nThe number of new rules and regulations became overwhelming.\nIn principle it is fine to have common rules, but no one can\nreally read all of them. (E)\nWhy on earth should the bureaucracy be decreased? If\nbureaucracy means instructions and regulation, it can only be\npositive. It is good that someone has thought through the\nprocedures already, if they are obeyed the chances of making\nmistakes are decreased. (M)\nAt the organizational level, there was no clear, common\nobjective. This stage (and this line of discourse) is almost an\ninseparable and a natural part of an extensive organizational\nmerger process at an early stage. People feel the need to hang\non to the past and protect the interests they feel might be\nunder threat. The actual challenge is whether an organization\nis capable of overcoming this stage and directing efforts\ntoward accepting and building a new organization.\nJuxtapositions. In addition to the lack of solidarity and team\nspirit, we also detected a competitive setting between differ-\nent teams and units. There was talk of \"us\" and \"them\"\ndetectable between groups or teams, between different\nregions and units, between professional fields, and between\nthe personnel and management. In the comments, the partici-\npants felt that both administrative and professional boundar-\nies were easily identifiable. It was also acknowledged that\nthis weakens the atmosphere, and therefore, the members of\nthe organization expressed a strong desire for a merger in\nattitude regarding the matter. It was described, for example,\nas in the following:\nWe should lower the barriers between different units. (E)\nWithin our new organization, the old ones still exist. (E)\nThe organization's elements of friction can be seen and heard\ninside the company: Unfortunately, similar messages are also\ncoming from outside the organization. This sort of flailing\naround is also seen to a regrettably large extent as personnel\nmotivation problems and fears, as well as general dissatisfaction\nwith the organization's operations. (E)\nThe rivalry was not malevolent but as a consequence of\nuncertainty and established organizational processes. At the\nbeginning of the change process, it seemed difficult to see\nany congruence in tasks with other professionals while it\nseemed easier for staff to identify with and relate to their own\nprofessional group. The basic tasks of different units were\ninterpreted as being very different, even incompatible.\n8 SAGE Open\nThe tasks in the different units are far too different. Sometimes\nthe interests of business and the environment collide. (M)\nBased on the above, we conclude that, at this stage, the\nspeech reflects the existence of multiple, conflicting, and/or\ncompeting identities (Foreman & Whetten, 2002). There\nseem to be many contradictions and conflicts that arise,\namong other things, from competing identity claims and\noverall identity ambiguity (Pratt & Foreman, 2000). However,\ndespite the rivalry, suspicion, and the lack of a common goal,\na unifying element across the new organization, according to\nthe data, seemed to be professional pride and customer\norientation.\nConstructing Communality\nThe bigger picture becomes clear. In the data, expressions high-\nlighting the need for cooperation became more evident and\ncommon with time. A sense of community and interactivity\ncame to the fore in all the data, and themes were segmented\nfrom many perspectives. This can be interpreted to mean that\ninteractive understanding was something multiple different\nparties wanted: The personnel were trying to consider and\nunderstand matters not only from their perspective but also\nfrom the perspective of management, and at the same time, the\npersonnel had a strong need to feel appreciated and understood\nby the management, especially regarding their experiences of\nthe merger. Management, however, should position itself and\nits operations in relation to the control system: In other words,\nthey should bring up different aspects, their grounds, and the\nassigned boundary conditions connected with the transition\nconcerned more effectively and more often.\nAs our research project continued, the strong confronta-\ntion and critique directed toward management that had\nemerged at the outset began to gradually change. Empathy\nwas shown toward management, and people started to con-\nsider the existing skills among direct subordinates, as well as\npersonal roles in supervisor/subordinate interaction and, in\nthe same vein, the impact of their own attitude and behavior\non management behavior.\nThe fourth form of interaction manifested itself in our tex-\ntual data in the form of comments where the members of the\norganization started talking about shared challenges, where\nthey expressed their desire to collaborate or reflect on the\ndistribution of work in the context of common goals and a\ncommon organization. As we argued earlier, this form differs\nfrom the previous one due to shared focus and targets, which\nare achieved through mutual contracts between workers.\nTalk of a common organization and common areas started to\nincrease, as did the desire to do things together.\nCooperation over the boundaries of units has increased. (E)\nEveryone should have an open mind when viewing what others\ndo, everyone should have curiosity and I mean it in a positive\nway--being interested in others and what they do, showing\nappreciation, and helping others when needed. (E)\nIn the relations between personnel, there was also a desire\nfor improvement in the spirit of interactivity and community,\nfor example, between various areas of responsibility or work\ntasks.\nAll of us should be able and willing to break away from familiar\nsocial--and coffee--groups, let's sit at a strange table, and no\none should have a negative attitude towards a plucky person like\nthat! On the contrary, one should be glad and make sure that the\nnewcomer is included in the discussions and enjoys him/herself.\nIt all starts with small gestures and expressions. (E)\nThe feeling of pulling together, working together towards a\ncommon goal. There is no jealousy over another unit's business.\nPeople are not jealous about other people's things. (E)\nCollective appreciation.As demonstrated earlier, the data\nincluded descriptions of how solidarity and team spirit had\nevolved alongside with the attitudes of personnel.\nLet's try to achieve a common organization and give up going\non about old units . . . we should talk about us . . . there is only\none organization. Individual employees sit where they sit, do\nwhatever needs to be done, some might be teleworking, some in\na different unit, but at the end of the day, the end result is quality,\nprofessional work and results. (M)\nIn the descriptions concerning collaboration or the need for\nit, the collective view was to perceive work as a united entity--\nThe perspective seemed to evolve from the individual form to\nthe form of teams and the entire organization. The develop-\nment, which according to the respondents had taken place, was\ndescribed as the evolution of appreciation and trust. The words\n\"we,\" \"us,\" and \"ours\" appeared more often in the comments.\nIt's important to adopt the idea that the work that is being done\nis the work of our organization. It is not mine or yours, it is ours.\nI'm calling for adjustment, acceptance and appreciation. (E)\nWe all should acknowledge that other important tasks exist in\nthe world, and that our own ones are not the only ones. We all\nshould adopt an appreciative attitude towards the work others do\nand appreciate their professionalism. We should learn to identify\nwith others, to put ourselves in another's shoes, including the\nadministrative personnel. Everyone's effort is needed, not only\nthe supervisors'. We all work for the whole, which cannot be\nwhole if a part is missing. Management needs to advance the\nculture of communality. (E)\nRemoving professional boundaries.Little by little, the focus\nbroadened from individual form reflections toward consider-\nations for teams, units, and the entire organization. Many\npeople wrote about the need to cross and eventually elimi-\nnate the existing boundaries:\nM\u00f6nkk\u00f6nen and Puusa 9\n\"The boundaries between different organizational units are way\ntoo high and they need to be lowered\" wrote one of the\nprofessionals. (M)\nIn the third study, we asked about the overall expectations\nconcerning the management and the organization as a whole.\nIn these data in particular, the collectively shared agenda\nseemed to be the need to lower the boundaries and to enhance\nthe sense of common organization, unity, and togetherness.\nHowever, although the need was clearly expressed, at this\npoint in the change process, only very few were able to sug-\ngest concrete activities or new ways of doing things to\nachieve the desired goals. At both practical and attitudinal\nlevels, many expressed skepticism toward the possibility of\nactually finding common ways of working together even\nthough it was perceived as ideal. In addition, although these\nvoices faded toward the end of our study, some wrote about\ntheir doubts throughout all data. Another important notion at\nthis point was that the reflections concentrated more on the\nfuture instead of the past. It seems that in the context of\nmerger, the question \"who do we want to be\" becomes more\nrelevant, and the construction of a consensual answer to the\nquestion requires active, conscious identity work.\nWorkers in different professions made a conscious attempt\nto understand each other's work and way of thinking. In the\nprocess of renewing organizations, the best outcome is\nachieved when the organization's new collective identity is\nconstructed through dialogue. We placed this kind of dis-\ncourse in the fifth form of interaction, which we outline\nbelow.\nState of joint action.As our research project proceeded, we\nidentified strengthening narratives that illustrated the fifth\nform of interaction. The content of the description included\nsections highlighting cooperation and communal spirit. The\ninformants do not present themselves as ideals, but coopera-\ntion, communal spirit, and open dialogue exist, and opera-\ntions are characterized by a future-oriented mind-set instead\nof the limitations of old organizational structures. Organiza-\ntional identity stems from when an organization's core func-\ntions,whichareinterpretedasshared--earlierseparate--parts\nof the organization (units, areas of expertise, teams, and indi-\nviduals) seem to be amalgamating or are at least seen as a\ncrucial part of one whole.\nEarlier, we described how a good atmosphere was called\nfor and how members of the organization perceived an attitu-\ndinal change--showing appreciation--as a \"tool\" for achiev-\ning it. This form of communication shows a positive\natmosphere characterized by trust, which is also related to\ncooperation and more efficient operations. Shared future\ngoals were described as a joint problem-solving mentality\nwhere responsibility is perceived in a collective manner:\nWe work together as a team, as well as facing challenges together\nand solving problems as a team. (E)\nTeam spirit and polyphony manifested themselves in\ndescriptions where joint action was perceived as meaningful.\nDifferent views are perceived as opportunities instead of\nthreats.\nGood team spirit at the workplace has always being important to\nme. It gives meaning to work . . . collaboration and cooperation.\n(E)\n. . . Readiness and enthusiasm to face and listen to other people\nwho do something different or do something differently. (E)\nThe speech on the topic of collaboration strengthened\nafter two things: First, it required experiences of doing\nactual, concrete work together, and second, the opportunity\nto reflect on their work not only individually and with close\ncolleagues but also with a larger group. The management, at\nthe minimum, sped up the adaptation process by agreeing to\nthis participative research project and by creating forums and\narenas for the personnel to express their feelings and thoughts\nin a structured manner, individually via the comments and\ncollectively (the seminars).\nWhile doing so, management did not shy away from criti-\ncism directed toward them. By allowing and encouraging\nmultiple voices and views to come out, management enabled\nthe construction of a more coherent and collective identity,\nwhich seemed to play an important role in breaking the pat-\ntern of holding on to the past and to old groups.\nDespite the uncertainty of the future, we commit ourselves to\nworking for the benefit of our joint organization. We really need\nto think about how we can advance and move forward. It starts\nwith everyone committing themselves to doing their core tasks\nwith care. It is also about understanding that the core can change\nwhile the organization is changing. (E)\nAn illustrative example of an element of common identity\nwas seen when one member of the organization stated,\nOf course conflicts of interest may occur, people interpret things\nfrom their own perspectives. It's compromising, but my point is\nthat all of us should be willing to have an open mind, to broaden\nour perspectives to include the whole instead just our own. The\nbigger picture is that we aim for the well-being and vitality of our\nregion. To achieve that task includes all of our areas of expertise\n. . . we should all work together towards a common goal. (E)\nThe idea of collective identity is grounded in a variety of\ntraditional sociological concepts addressing the \"we-ness\" of\na particular group (Hardy et al., 2005). Next, we sum up the\nresults of data.\nConclusion\nDuring the first stage of our research process, the members of\nthe organization described an interaction that can be regarded\nas very formal and devoid of acts of collaboration, which we\ninterpret as the first form of interaction. In the second form of\ninteraction, the interplay was determined by hierarchical\ninteraction. In other words, it was less spontaneous and col-\nlegial and more one way in nature, where one is a sender and\nthe other a mere receiver. In this form, interaction and com-\nmunication are one sided and scarce except between close\ncolleagues. When interaction and genuine dialogue exist only\nbetween a select few individuals or groups, it is inevitable\nthat identity-related interpretations at organizational level\nwill remain very fragmented, whereas wide-ranging dialogue\nallows a consensus to be reached (see also Ashforth & Mael,\nIn the third form, the members of the organization\ndescribed the prevailing tensions between units, teams,\npositions, and individuals. The atmosphere was character-\nized by doubt, rivalry, and mistrust. Collaboration was faint,\nbut at the same time the desire to find common ground\nincreased significantly. This stage seems to be an important\nadaption phase where members of the organization slowly\nstarted letting go of the past and considered the possibility\nof partaking in building and identifying with something\nnew. In the fourth form of interaction, the perspective broad-\nened, and the organization was perceived as a whole. The\ndesire to work together and advance the construction of a\npositive organizational atmosphere that was identified ear-\nlier slowly became concrete. There was willingness to cross,\nfor example, administrative and professional borders.\nFinally, in the fifth form of interaction, the texts embody a\nstrong sense of working as a team, characterized by open\ndialogue, trust, and joint action. Our findings concur with\nthe study conducted by Hardy et al. (2005). They also con-\ncluded that organizational identity plays a fundamental role\nin achieving collective, or as we call it, joint, action in the\ncontext of collaboration. They argue that \"the discursive\nconstruction of a collective identity enables participants to\nconstruct themselves, the problem, and the solution as part\nof a collaborative framework in which the potential for joint\naction is both significant and beneficial\" (Hardy et al., 2005,\np. 63). We argue that if the members of an organization can-\nnot get past the first three stages of interaction, organiza-\ntional identity will inevitably remain fragmented (Albert &\nIn Figure 1, we summarize the forms of interaction\nDiscussion\nIn our article, we have examined how a state of common\nunderstanding evolves via interaction in a public sector orga-\nnization going through a merger. With the help of our empiri-\ncal data, we have discussed texts that illustrate different\nforms of interaction, simultaneously highlighting how con-\nstruction of a collective identity evolves after a merger. In\naddition to this, feelings of uncertainty, skepticism, and cyni-\ncism can bring about active resistance to change (Reichers,\nWanous, & Austin, 1997; Stanley, Meyer, & Topolnytsky,\nFormally\ntogether\nUnidirectional\ninteraction\nJuxtapositions\nConstruction of\ncommonality\nState of joint\naction\nThe \"big picture\" clarifies\nPerspecve broadens\nSpeech about appreciaon\nRemoving professional\nboundaries\nOrientaon towards the future\nOne-sided, top-down\ncommunicaon\nFeeling of external\ncontrol and increased\nbureaucracy\nTensions\nRivalry\nTalk about \"us\"\nand\"them\"\nUnfamiliarity with others\nand their work\nIdenficaon with the\nold organizaon\nFeeling of separaon\nCollaboraon\nTeam-spirit\nCollecve \"we\"\nPolypfony\nTrust\nDialogue\nFigure 1. Forms of constructing organizational identity.\nM\u00f6nkk\u00f6nen and Puusa 11\n2005). Discussion and the arguments put forward by differ-\nent people during a merger are also dilemmatic (Billig, 1991;\nBillig et al., 1988); on one hand, there is a critique of the\ncommon rules, yet on the other hand, the need for them is\naccepted as they are perceived as ensuring fairness and\nequality. If the emergent meanings and interpretations are\nnot coherent or conflict with each other, then the identity\nremains unstable, in a state of either identity ambiguity or\npossible identity conflict (Corley & Gioia, 2004).\nThe development of organizations is not merely a matter\nof progress from one stage of development to another.\nConversely, people look for change in their thoughts and atti-\ntudes, and interaction is built with dialogue as well as within\nthe tensions between doubt and inspiration, independence\nand community. Corley and Gioia (2004) argue that all\nchanges involve processes of \"moving from an existing clar-\nity of understanding to doubt, uncertainty, and ambiguity,\nand ultimately to a state of renewed clarity that resolves into\nan altered form\" (p. 174). This seemed to be the case in our\nstudy as well.\nAccording to Harr\u00e9 and Van Langenhove (1998), people\ncreate positions that deviate considerably from each other in\nvarious situations, and these may vary within the same cir-\ncumstances or within the same discussion. This interactive\ndynamism does not, however, exclude the fact that more per-\nmanent development is also recognizable in the development\nof groups in the direction of an integrated group, and this is\nclearly discernible particularly in transitions affecting orga-\nnizations. In uncertain situations, it is natural to be on guard,\nbut by doing things together, those borders gradually begin\nto erode. In changes affecting large public organizations,\nhowever, this may take several years (Buhanist, Haramo,\nIn an organizational merger, the method of management is\nimportant, but the kinds of forms the joint effort takes are\nalso important. Awareness of the fact that personnel should\nbe encouraged to work for change is already growing.\nParticipation assumes various formats: It may be formal,\nbuilt on "
