This\nspeculation is based on findings including\nthe association between NS and lymphoma\nin some cases, relapse coinciding with infec-\ntion, response to various immunosuppres-\nsive medications, and imbalances of a\nSeveral cytokines and other soluble plasma\ncomponents may also be associated with\nNS.13,14 A case has been described in which\nSSNS disappeared after bone-marrow trans-\nplantation,10 suggesting that hematopoietic\ncells are involved in the pathogenesis of\nSSNS. SRNS has been shown to recur after\nkidney transplantation in some patients,\nsuggesting that the pathogenesis of this\ncondition resides outside the kidney; in\naddition, the efficacy of plasmapheresis in\nmost recurrent cases indicates the presence\nof circulating factor(s) that cause SRNS.15,16\nHowever, these contributing factors remain\nto be identified and validated.17\u00ad20 Although\nimmunosuppressive agents are effective in\nsome patients with SRNS, there are cur-\nrently no tools to determine the optimal\ntreatment for a patient before a therapeutic\ntrial, or for predicting recurrence after\nComprehensive information regarding\nNS would lead to a better understanding\nof the pathogenesis of the disease, mechan-\nism of relapse, optimal medication choice,\nand prediction of prognosis. Thus, the\npresent study applied whole-transcriptome\nsequencing of peripheral blood mono-\nnuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with\nNS, using a next-generation sequencing\n(NGS) method of RNA sequencing.22\nPBMCs were used because of the high\nprobability of immune system involvement\nin the pathogenesis of NS, and their easy\naccessibility, a prerequisite for a useful bio-\ntechnologies, RNA sequencing can capture\nthe dynamic range of transcriptomes in\nterms of both expression profiling and dif-\nferentially expressed isoforms (DEIs) on a\nmassive scale.25\u00ad27 We report the prelimin-\nary results of signature gene sets of NS and\nsteroid responsiveness.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nThe study recruited children aged <18 years\nwho were newly diagnosed with idiopathic\nNS at Seoul National University Children's\nHospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea, between\nwho were on long-term treatment prior\nto transfer to our hospital were excluded\nfrom the study. Pathological diagnosis was\nobtained only in patients with SRNS.\nThe study was approved by the Seoul\nNational University Hospital Institutional\nparticipants' parents or legal guardians\nprovided written informed consent prior to\nenrolment.\nSample collection\nPeripheral blood samples were collected from\npatients and PBMCs were isolated using\nFicoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifuga-\ntion, then stored at \u00c080C until RNA extrac-\ntion. Nephrotic samples were collected at the\ntime of onset or relapse of NS, before\ncommencing any treatment. Remission sam-\nples were collected from patients with SSNS\nduring remission, when having not been\ntaking steroids for >2 months.\nWhole-transcriptome sequencing\nTotal RNA was extracted from PBMCs\nusing a QIAamp RNA mini kit (Qiagen,\nAustin, TX, USA). Libraries were prepared\nbased on the Illumina protocol according to\nthe manufacturer's instructions, and 54 bp\nof paired-end RNA sequencing data were\ngenerated using the Illumina Genome\nAnalyzer IIx (Illumina, San Diego, CA,\nUSA). The prepared libraries were quanti-\nfied using quantitative polymerase chain\nreaction (PCR) according to the quantifica-\ntion protocol guide in the manufacturer's\ninstructions. The read quality was checked,\nthen the differentially expressed gene (DEG)\nsequences were identified using R package\ning the reads and assessing the distribution\nof count differences between samples. Raw\nread quality scores and read counts were\nsummarized.\nFor annotation, RNA sequence reads\nwere aligned to the human reference\ngenome (University of California, Santa\nsupplied annotations, a set of gene-model\nannotations and known transcripts, and the\n\u00adno-novel-juncs option to disable mapping\nfor novel splice junctions.29\u00ad31 The aligned\nreads were quantified with Cufflinks (version\n1.3.0) to obtain the fragments per kilobase\nof exons per million fragments mapped\n(FPKM) values for the genes or gene tran-\nscripts, and then merged into an expression\ntable for the next analysis step, outlined in\nFigure 1 and conducted as described.31\nExpression profiling and functional\nannotation\nThe average number of reads produced from\neach sample was 74 million. Only those of\nprotein coding genes listed on the UCSC\nGenome Browser32 were analysed. Loci with\nlow variance in FPKM values or zero reads\nacross all samples were removed. Variance-\nstabilizing normalization and upper-quartile\nnormalization were applied to the boost\nsensitivity without a loss of specificity.33\nThe DEGs were obtained from one-way\nanalyses of variance (ANOVA) for\neach group, and false discovery rate (FDR)\nmultiple testing corrections were applied.\nPost-hoc analyses were performed to detect\nthe relationships between groups via the\nTukey's honest significance test. Analyses of\nDEIs were performed similarly, but no\nsignificant DEIs were obtained.\nThe DEGs of the groups of interest were\nobtained by t-tests. For functional annota-\ntion and clustering, the Gene Set Enrichment\nAnalysis (GSEA) program (version 2.0.8)\nwith the Molecular Signatures Database\nAnnotation, Visualization and Integrated\nDiscovery (DAVID, version 6.7) were used\nto enhance understanding of the underlying\nbiological relevance.35,36 Clustering analysis\nwas performed using the kmeans function in\nR 3.0.2, which performs k-means clustering\n(K \u00bc 10 clusters specified) on a given expres-\nsion profile for DEGs. The hypergeometric\ndistribution is used to compute P-values for\nGene Ontology (GO) annotation for clusters\nwith the Molecular Signatures Database\n(version 5.1).34 For upstream analysis of\nDEGs, gene-sets of microRNA targets\n(n \u00bc 221) and transcription factor targets\n(n \u00bc 615) from Molecular Signatures\nDatabase (version 5.1) were downloaded\nand compared with DEGs.34\nResults\nIn total, 18 patients with idiopathic NS were\nenrolled (15 males/3 females; mean age\nThe median age at onset of NS was 5.9 years\nFigure 1.

Pathological\ndiagnosis was obtained only in those with\nSRNS, and was focal segmental glomerulo-\nsclerosis in all cases. Of the four patients\nwith SRNS, two responded to cyclosporine\ntreatment (calcineurin inhibitor [CNI]\nresponders [CRs]), and two responded to\nneither steroids nor CNI (nonresponders\n[NRs]). A total of nine remission samples\nwere collected from patients with SSNS.\nThe gene expression profile was deter-\npatients (one patient provided both a neph-\nrotic sample and a remission sample) and 18\n551 genes. Statistical analyses identified\nto the remission group (n \u00bc 9) (Figure 2).\nFunctional annotations of these genes\nrevealed that these DEGs were related to\ndorsal/ventral pattern formation (enrich-\nment score [ES] 2.05), extracellular matrix\nstructural constituents (ES 1.75), and actin\nbinding (ES 1.36) according to the DAVID\nfunctional annotation module. Based on the\nGSEA, compared with the remission group,\nthe gene-expression profile of the NS group\nwas enriched with genes pertaining to ster-\noid hormones, matrix metalloproteinase\n(i.e., enzymes that degrade the extracellular\nmatrix)-inducing cytokines, extracellular\nmatrix-receptor interaction, acyl chain\nremodelling of phosphatidylglycerol, G b:g\nsignalling through PI3Kg, CTLA4 inhibi-\ntory signalling, the early response to\nTGFb1, IL4 receptor signalling in B\nlymphocytes, pantothenate and CoA bio-\nsyntheses, the syndecan 3 pathway, and the\nmTOR signalling pathway.\nMore stringent criteria (P < 0.01 and\n>2-fold changes of expression) were applied\nto identify the highly significant genes in\nidiopathic NS.

These DEGs were enriched\nwith extracellular matrix structural constitu-\nent/actin binding/cytoskeletal protein bind-\ning according to the GO term of molecular\nfunction, as well as cytokine and/or immune\nsystem signalling related to steroids;\nCTLA4, TGFb1, IL4, and mTOR according\nto GSEA. IL4 is a representative cytokine of\nTh2 immune reactions, and Th2 immune\nreactions have been reported to be predom-\ninantly associated with childhood NS.11\nAdditionally, CTLA4 and TGFb1 are\nrelated to immune regulation, and impaired\nregulatory T cell function has been reported\nin idiopathic NS.39 Upstream analysis\nshowed that DEGs of NS were enriched\nwith targets of MIR-370, which is related to\nWilms tumour of the kidneys, suggesting\nrelevance of DEGs affecting the kidneys.40\nFurthermore, among 12 upstream genes,\nITGAL, MEF2A, STAT6 are members of\nsteroid responsiveness panel genes in U.S.\npatents.41 Therefore, the findings of the\npresent study generally agree with know-\nledge regarding NS. Further refinement of\nthese results in larger studies will improve\nour understanding of NS.\nFigure 3.

In search of markers for steroid\nresponsiveness in paediatric NS, we identi-\ngenes based on more stringent criteria.\nInterestingly, the DEGs of patients with\nSSNS (vs SRNS) were enriched in genes\npertaining to the cell cycle and the targets of\nition to those related to cytokines. The\nemergence of cell cycle-related genes may\nimply differences in the proliferative proper-\nties of SSNS and SRNS, which could be\nutilized for the development of novel thera-\npeutic options. The 23 genes that were\nselected as markers of steroid responsiveness\nseem heterogeneous, but following refining\nwith different sets of samples for validation,\nlist of genes or part of this list can be used as\nmarkers of steroid responsiveness.\nInterestingly, comparison of the signature\ngenes of SSNS with those listed as SSNS in\nthe patent for ``Kit and method for identify-\ning individual responsiveness to steroid\ntherapy of nephrotic syndrome''41 did not\nreveal any common genes, despite the simi-\nlarity of the methods, indicating that clinical\nutilization of this approach requires further\nstudy. Notably, previously proposed circu-\nlating factors indicative of SRNS (cardio-\ntrophin-like cytokine factor 118 and\nurokinase-type plasminogen activator\nTable 4.

These proposed circulating factors\nwere discovered in patients with recurrent\nNS after kidney transplantation in which\nsteroid treatment can achieve remission in\nthe majority of patients.\nThe present study has several shortcom-\nings. First, the sample size was small, limit-\ning the statistical power. Additionally, some\nrelevant DEGs may not have been identified\ndue to this small sample size. The DEGs\nidentified in this study were able to clearly\nclassify the groups, so our approach seems\nvalid and justifies further studies to identify\ndisease/therapeutic response markers for\nclinical applications. Secondly, although\nRNA sequencing was used rather than\nmRNA microarrays, DEIs and alternative\nsplicing pattern differences between groups\nwere not identified. To discover novel splice\nsites and rare transcripts, deep sequencing of\nrequired (according to the guidelines of the\nEncyclopaedia of DNA Elements Project42).\nThe insufficient number of reads of this study\n(mean 77 million reads with up to 75% of the\nreads properly aligned against a reference\ngenome) could be the reason for the failure in\nthe DEI search, in addition to the small\nnumber of samples per group. Finally, the\nvalidation of candidate markers of NS or\nsteroid responsiveness was not performed in\nthis study. Clearly, many of the DEGs are\nnot linked to pathogenesis but rather are the\nresults of or surrogate changes due to disease.\nA validation study may be helpful in dis-\ncriminating these differences.\nIn conclusion, whole-transcriptome\nsequencing of PBMCs found that DEGs of\nNS were enriched in immune system signal-\nling, and potential therapeutic targets were\nsuggested. Further studies with larger num-\nbers of patients will provide more compre-\nhensive information to enable the application\nof precision medicine to paediatric NS.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research was supported by the Seoul\nNational University Hospital (SNUH) Research\nResearch Foundation of Korea (NRF, funded by\nthe Ministry of Education) [grant number NRF-\nProgram]; and the Korean Health Technology\nR&D Project by Ministry of Health and Welfare\nin the Republic of Korea [grant numbers\nReferences\n1.
