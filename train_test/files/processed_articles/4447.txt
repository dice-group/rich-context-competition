Evolutionary theorists have argued that competitive\ndisadvantage may lead to adoption of a life strategy characterized by discounting of long-\nCompetitive disadvantage and attitudes towards rape\nterm consequences and gain and greater focus on short-term gains, which may in turn lead\nto short-term mating strategies and risky and aggressive behavior, including sexual\ncoercion (e.g., Lalumi\u00e8re, Harris, Quinsey, and Rice, 2005; Mishra and Lalumi\u00e8re, 2008;\nQuinsey, Skilling, Lalumi\u00e8re, and Craig, 2004; Thornhill and Palmer, 2000; Wilson and\nThere is some correlational evidence suggesting a link between competitive status\nand perceptions of rape. A meta-analytic review found a small but significant association\nbetween lower socioeconomic status (SES) and greater endorsement of justifications and\nOkamura, 1997). Lalumi\u00e8re and Quinsey (1996) found that lower SES was associated with\ngreater endorsement of beliefs supportive of violence towards women, hostility towards\nwomen, and sexual coercion.\nNumerous theories and models of sex offending assert that attitudes towards a\nbehavior mediate the likelihood of engaging in that behavior (e.g., hierarchical-mediational\nconfluence model [HCM; Malamuth, 2003], integrated theory of the etiology of sexual\noffending [Marshall and Barbaree, 1990], structured risk assessment model [Thornton,\n2002], judgment model of cognitive distortions [JMCD; Ward, Gannon, and Keown,\n2006]). This is also the case for nonsexual aggression (e.g., general aggression model\n[GAM; Anderson and Bushman, 2002], social learning theory [Bandura, 1973]), general\ncrime (e.g., personal, interpersonal, and community-reinforcement [PIC-R] model\n[Andrews and Bonta, 2006]), and general behavior (e.g., theory of reasoned action [Ajzen\ninfluence of attitudes on general behavior is moderated by a number of variables, such as\nthe accessibility and stability of the attitude (Glasman and Albarrac\u00edn, 2006; Kraus, 1995),\nthe relationship between attitudes and behavior can be strong. Meta-analyses have revealed\nGlasman and Albarrac\u00edn, 2006) average correlations between attitudes and subsequent\nbehavior.\nFocusing specifically on rape, there is some evidence that rapists endorse excuses\nand justifications for rape more than men who have not committed rape (Bumby, 1996;\nDeGue, DeLillo, and Scalora, 2010; Murnen, Wright, and Kaluzny, 2002). Researchers\nhave also found that greater self-reported likelihood to rape is associated with more\npositive attitudes towards rape and more positive outcome expectancies for rape (Bouffard,\n2002; Nunes, Hermann, and Ratcliffe, 2011). Taken together the available research\nindicates that attitudes, expected costs and benefits, and more general cognitions about rape\nare associated with sexual aggression. Consistent with the empirical evidence and theory,\nthe focus on offence-supportive cognitions in sex offender risk assessment (Olver, Wong,\nNicholaichuk, and Gordon, 2007) and treatment (McGrath, Cumming, Burchard, Zeoli, and\nEllerby, 2010) clearly indicates that they are widely thought to be important determinants\nof sexual aggression.\nThe effects of competitive disadvantage on cognitions about rape have not yet been\nexamined in experimental studies. Experimental research examining more general risky\nbehaviors has found that disadvantage (Mishra and Lalumi\u00e8re, 2011) and high need states\n(Mishra and Lalumi\u00e8re, 2010) lead to greater risk-taking. Similarly, shorter life expectancy\nCompetitive disadvantage and attitudes towards rape\nhas been linked to aggressiveness in both experimental (Dunkel, Mathes, and Papini, 2010)\nand correlational (Wilson and Daly, 1997) research. Being at a competitive disadvantage in\nterms of genetic quality and power would greatly limit a man's ability to mate with\ndesirable partners. He lacks the genetic quality for desirable women to find him of interest\nfor short-term mating and he lacks the resources to make him attractive for long-term\nmating (e.g., Penke et al., 2008). The perception that one has reduced mate value due to\ncompetitive disadvantage may induce a state of high need, which may cast risky, antisocial,\nand, in particular, sexually coercive behavior in a more positive light \u00ad from a reproductive\nfitness perspective, what does he have to lose? The purpose of the current study is to\nexperimentally manipulate competitive status to observe its effect on beliefs about rape.\nWe hypothesized that perceived competitive disadvantage would lead to less negative\nattitudes towards rape and endorsement of more justifications and excuses for rape.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nThe final sample consisted of 120 heterosexual male undergraduate students at\nCarleton University who received course credit for their participation in this on-line survey\nstudy. Although 181 participants started the on-line survey (advantage n = 90, disadvantage\nn = 91), 37 were excluded because they (a) did not respond to any questions (n = 15), (b)\ndid not consent to the use of their data after the deception was revealed (n = 1), (c) were\nfemale (n = 4), or (d) self-reported primary sexual attraction to men (n = 7) or both men\nand women (n = 6). Note that some participants met more than one of these exclusion\ncriteria. Of the remaining 144 participants, 24 were excluded for missing data on any of the\nmain measures.\nAll participants reported that they understood written English. Median age was 20\nto 21 years old; the youngest age category was 17 and the oldest was 40 to 44. In terms of\nromantic relationship status, 61.7% were single, 29.2% were in a romantic relationship,\n5.0% were living with a romantic partner, 4.2% were married, and none were separated or\ndivorced. In light of their relevance to competitive status, data on access to resources,\nphysical characteristics, and grades were also gathered. In terms of living arrangements,\n7.6% were living alone, 42.4% with a parent or guardian, and 50.0% with a roommate.\nApproximately one third reported that they owned their own apartment or house (30.8%).\nfoot 7 inches). In terms of physical shape, 54.2% reported an average/mixed build, 24.2%\nreported a muscular build, 6.7% reported being overweight/obese, and 15.0% reported\nbeing underweight/thin. Median overall grade point average (GPA) was B (ranged from A+\nto D-) among those who knew their GPA; 25.0% did not know their GPA. This project was\napproved by the Carleton University Ethics Committee for Psychological Research.\nCompetitive disadvantage and attitudes towards rape\nMeasures\nRape Semantic Differential Scale. Rape was rated on six bipolar scales.\nSpecifically, participants were presented with \"Rape is\" and selected a response on each 7-\npoint scale ranging from -3 (e.g., very negative) to +3 (e.g., very positive), with zero being\nneutral. The bipolar anchors for the response scales were very negative to very positive,\nextremely not fun to extremely fun, very bad to very good, very wrong to very right, very\nimmoral to very moral, and very unenjoyable to very enjoyable. The six scales were\nsummed to compute a total score, which can range from -18 (indicating an extremely\nnegative attitude towards rape) to +18 (indicating an extremely positive attitude towards\nrape). Internal consistency was high in the current study (Cronbach's alpha = .83).\nRape Outcome Expectancies (ROE) Scale. The ROE Scale (Nunes et al., 2011) is\ndesigned to measure outcome expectancies for rape. Three self-generated outcomes of\n\"forcing a woman to have sex with you\" are rated on their perceived likelihood (\"How\nlikely is it that this outcome would happen?\") and evaluation (\"How positive or negative\nwould this outcome be for you if it did happen?\"). Participants are asked to think of one\npossible outcome of sexual assault and then rate the perceived likelihood of that outcome\non a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (never happen) to 7 (guaranteed to happen). They then\nrate the evaluation of that outcome on a 7-point scale ranging from -3 (very negative) to +3\n(very positive); the midpoint on the scale is 0 (neutral). These likelihood and evaluation\nratings are repeated for the second and third outcomes.\nThe measure produces two total scores: an evaluation score and an overall score.\nThe ROE Evaluation Scale total score is computed by summing the evaluation ratings of\nthe three outcomes. Total evaluation scores can range from -9 to +9, with higher values\nindicating a more positive evaluation of the outcomes of rape considered by the participant.\nThe ROE Scale total score is computed by multiplying the likelihood rating by the\nevaluation rating for each outcome and summing the products across all three outcomes.\nROE Scale scores can range from -63 (indicating an extremely negative attitude towards\nrape) to +63 (indicating an extremely positive attitude towards rape). We have found that\nhigher scores on both the evaluation and overall ROE Scale are associated with higher self-\nreported likelihood to rape (Nunes et al., 2011).\nRAPE Scale. The RAPE Scale (Bumby, 1996) is a self-report measure of\njustifications and excuses for rape. Thirty-six items are scored on a 4-point scale ranging\nfrom 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). Total scores can range from 36 to 144,\nwith higher scores reflecting stronger and/or more frequent endorsement of justifications\nand excuses for rape. Sample items are, \"If a woman does not resist strongly to sexual\nadvances, she is probably willing to have sex\" and \"I believe that, if a woman lets a man\nkiss her and touch her sexually, she should be willing to go all the way.\" The scale has\nexcellent internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and good construct validity (Arkowitz\nand Vess, 2003; Bumby, 1996). There is also good evidence for the construct validity of the\nRAPE scale. For example, it is correlated (r = .33 to .50) with other established measures\nof beliefs supportive of rape (Arkowitz and Vess, 2003; Bumby, 1996) and rapists score\nhigher than non-sex offenders (Bumby, 1996). Internal consistency was high in the current\nstudy (Cronbach's alpha = .93).\nCompetitive disadvantage and attitudes towards rape\nProcedure\nAll measures and materials were administered through an on-line survey (Survey\nConsole). The materials were presented to all participants in the following order: 1) initial\nconsent form; 2) several background questions about age, gender, financial status\nindicators, height, physical shape, and grades; 3) competitive status manipulation; 4) rape\nsemantic differential scales; 5) ROE Scale, 6) RAPE Scale; 7) manipulation check\nquestions; 8) revelation of deception; 9) final consent form; and 10) debriefing information.\nWe created the competitive status manipulation for the current study. Participants\nwere pseudorandomly assigned to one condition, such that assignment to the advantage or\ndisadvantage condition alternated between consecutive participants. For example, the first\nparticipant was assigned to the disadvantage condition, the second to the advantage\ncondition, the third to the disadvantage condition, and so on. The following instructions\nwere presented to all participants: \"Please carefully read the following information from a\nrecent survey of male students at Carleton University. You will be asked some questions\nabout this information later.\" The disadvantage condition was designed to make one feel\ndisadvantaged compared to male peers in terms of financial, physical, and intellectual\npower by presenting a fictional, exaggerated description of the typical male student at the\nuniversity:\nMost male students at Carleton University are doing well financially. The\naverage male student earns over $20,000 per year, has considerable savings,\nand is less than $2,000 in debt. He owns his own car. He does not live with\nhis parents but rather in his own apartment or house off-campus. He also\nowns nice clothing and the latest electronics (cell phone, laptop computer,\niPod, etc.).\nThe average male Carleton student is also physically impressive. Most are in\ngood shape compared to the national average, are athletic and muscular, and\nAcademically, the average male Carleton student is also excellent. The\nmajority of male students get As in most of their courses.\nThe advantage condition was designed to make one feel advantaged compared to\nmale peers in terms of financial, physical, and intellectual power by presenting a fictional,\nunderstated description of the typical male student at the university:\nMost male students at Carleton University are not well off financially. The\naverage male student earns under $2,000 per year, has under $50 in the\nbank, and is more than $20,000 in debt. He does not own his own car and\nmust use public transit. He lives with his parents. His clothing is cheap and\nout-of-style and he does not have up to date electronics (cell phone, laptop,\niPod, etc.).\nThe average male Carleton student is also not very physically impressive.\nMost are out of shape, not athletic, and 5 foot 5 inches or shorter.\nAcademically, the average male Carleton student is struggling. The majority\nof male students get Ds in most of their courses.\nCompetitive disadvantage and attitudes towards rape\nManipulation Check. To assess the effectiveness of the manipulation, participants\nwere asked to rate themselves compared to the typical male Carleton University student\ndescribed in the manipulation. Specifically, they rated their relative position on finances (1\n[much better] to 5 [much worse]), height (1 [much taller] to 5 [much shorter]), physical\nshape (1 [much better] to 5 [much worse]), and course marks (1 [much higher] to 5 [much\nlower]).\nResults\nMissing Values\nAs noted in the Participants section, 24 participants had only partially complete data\non the main measures (16.67%). More specifically, 7 participants were missing some or all\nitems of the ROE Scale (and ROE Evaluation Scale), 4 were missing some or all items of\nthe rape semantic differential scale, and 15 were missing some or all items of the Bumby\nRape Scale. A series of t tests indicated that compared to those with complete data on the\nBumby Rape Scale, those with missing data tended to have higher scores on the ROE Scale\n(p = .051) and significantly higher scores on the rape semantic differential scale (p = .019).\nOtherwise the participants with and without missing values on each measure did not differ\nsignificantly on the other main measures. Chi-square analyses indicated that the proportion\nof missing values for the main measures was not significantly different across experimental\nconditions.\nGroup comparisons\nParticipants did not differ significantly between experimental conditions on age,\nromantic relationship status, earnings, savings, debt, vehicle ownership, vehicle cost,\naccommodations, home ownership, physical build, or course grades. However, despite\npseudorandom assignment to condition, participants did differ on height: Those assigned to\nthe advantage condition were significantly taller (Mdn = 5 foot 11 inches) than those\nassigned to the disadvantage condition (Mdn = 5 foot 10 inches). To address whether this\nheight difference posed a threat to the internal validity of the study, we examined the\ncorrelations between height and the main variables. Height was not significantly correlated\nwith any of the measures of beliefs about rape in either condition (r = -.05 to .12). Results\nwere virtually identical with non-parametric correlations (Spearman's rho).\nA series of t tests indicated the manipulation was effective. Specifically, compared\nto participants in the advantage condition, those in the disadvantage condition rated\nthemselves worse off financially (Mdn = 3 vs. 2), shorter (Mdn = 3 vs. 2), in worse physical\nshape (Mdn = 3 vs. 2), and as having lower course marks (Mdn = 4 vs. 2) than the average\nmale student at the university (all ps < .001). Non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney U)\nproduced the same results.\nDescriptive statistics on the main variables by experimental condition are presented\nin Table 1. Outlying scores were reduced to one point above the highest non-outlying value\nin their respective conditions on the rape semantic differential scale (2 extreme high scores\nin the advantage condition and 2 extreme high scores in the disadvantage condition), the\nROE Evaluation Scale (1 extreme high score in the advantage condition and 2 extreme high\nCompetitive disadvantage and attitudes towards rape\nscores in the disadvantage condition), and the ROE Scale (1 extreme high score in the\nadvantage condition and 3 extreme high scores in the disadvantage condition). There were\nno outlying values on the Bumby Rape Scale. To examine the magnitude of the differences\nbetween experimental conditions, Cohen's d was calculated for each comparison. By\nlarge effect sizes, respectively (Cohen, 1988). The 95% confidence interval around d was\nalso reported to provide an indication of the range of values for d that would be expected in\n95% of other samples from the same population. Statistical significance of d can be\ndetermined from the confidence interval. If the 95% confidence interval does not contain\nzero, the effect size is significantly different from zero (p < .05).\nAs shown in Table 1, the disadvantage condition had less negative attitudes towards\nrape as measured by the rape semantic differential scale and the ROE Evaluation Scale\n(medium effect sizes). Although small effects in the same direction were found for the\nROE Scale and the Bumby RAPE Scale, these differences were not statistically significant.\nWe also computed the average effect size across all four dependent measures using\n(0.14, 0.50), indicating that, on average, participants in the disadvantage condition\nendorsed beliefs more supportive of rape. Correlations between the measures are shown in\nTable 2. All measures were moderately to strongly intercorrelated.\nTable 1.

However, contrary to our expectations, competitive disadvantage did not\nsignificantly affect justifications and excuses for rape as measured by the Rape Scale. The\ndifferences between groups were in the expected direction for all measures and the effect\nsizes were small to medium. The average effect size across all four measures was small but\nsignificant, indicating that participants in the disadvantage condition generally endorsed\nbeliefs more supportive of rape than participants in the advantage condition.\nOur findings are generally supportive of a causal link between competitive status\nand perceptions of sexual coercion. The results are consistent with past theory and research:\nNegative comparison with male peers should lower one's self-perceived mate value, which\nin turn would lead to increased focus on immediate gains rather than long-term benefits and\nal., 2008). Thus, rape may seem less negative for competitively disadvantaged men because\nthe alternative for them may be to not mate at all or mate only with less desirable females\nA number of limitations warrant caution in interpreting our findings. First, the\nabsence of a control condition in which perceived status was not changed (i.e., a neutral\ncondition) makes it difficult to determine whether the disadvantage condition made\nperceptions of rape more positive, the advantage condition made perceptions of rape more\nnegative, or both. Second, because we attempted to manipulate several aspects of\ncompetitive status at once (resources, physical size and strength, and intelligence), it was\nnot possible to isolate the aspects responsible for the observed effects. Third, the height in\nthe disadvantage condition appeared to be too low given that our sample was taller than\nexpected (median height was 5 foot 11 inches). Future research should include a control\ncondition, isolate the different status indicators, and generally refine the status\nmanipulation. In addition, it would be interesting to explore whether the perceived\ncompetitive status manipulation interacts with individual differences in perceived\ncompetitive status and history of sexual coercion.\nCompetitive disadvantage and attitudes towards rape\nThe purpose of this study was to explore competitive disadvantage as an\nexplanation for sexual coercion, but we did not examine potential mediating mechanisms of\nthe relationship between perceived disadvantage and attitudes towards rape. For example,\nperceived competitive disadvantage may induce frustration (e.g., Dollard, Doob, Miller,\nMowrer, and Sears, 1939), anticipatory narcissistic reactance (Baumeister, Catanese, and\nWallace, 2002), low self-esteem (Kavanagh, Robins, and Ellis, 2010; Marshall, Anderson,\nand Wright, 2004), which may in turn influence attitudes towards rape (Nunes, Malcom,\nand Pettersen, 2010). Future research should explore whether these and other potentially\nrelevant factors mediate the effects of competitive disadvantage on attitudes towards rape.\nFuture research should also attempt to replicate our current findings, extend them to other\nsamples and other manipulations, and explore the effects of competitive disadvantage on\nsexually coercive behavior (e.g., self-reported likelihood to rape or analogue measures) and\nthe extent to which attitudes towards rape mediate the relationship between disadvantage\nand behavior. Although the link between attitudes and behaviors was not examined in the\ncurrent study, in previous research we have found significant correlations between self-\nreported likelihood to rape and some of the attitude measures examined in the current study\n(ROE Scale and ROE Evaluation Scale; Nunes et al., 2011). If our findings were replicated\nand extended to sexually aggressive behavior, this would suggest that facilitating increased\nrelative status through legitimate means may be an effective intervention for many young\nThe current study contributes to the existing literature in two important ways. First,\nwe focused specifically on attitudes towards rape defined as summary evaluations of rape\ncognitions (e.g., rape myths, cognitive distortions) that have typically been examined in the\nis the first study that we know of to experimentally test the effects of perceived competitive\ndisadvantage on beliefs about rape. We designed a brief, simple, and effective manipulation\nof competitive status and found that perceived disadvantage led to less negative attitudes\ntowards rape. Future studies using this or similar experimental manipulations (e.g., Mishra\nand Lalumi\u00e8re, 2011) can complement correlational studies and may contribute to greater\nclarity, precision, and sophistication of research and theory on the role of competitive\ndisadvantage in rape.\n"
