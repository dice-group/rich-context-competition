About 20%\nof community-dwelling persons 65 years of age and\nolder in the United States report having some diffi-\nculty with ADLs (Van Nostrand, Furner, & Suzman,\n1993). This prevalence doubles for those over the age\nof 85, with women having higher rates than men.\nWithout reductions in these age-specific preva-\nlences, ADL functional limitations will become even\nmore important from a public health perspective as\nthe population ages.\nAge-specific prevalences of ADL limitations do not\nby themselves capture the true dynamics of func-\ntional change. Physical function can improve, stay\nthe same, or worsen over time (Branch, Katz, Kniep-\nStrawbridge, Kaplan, Camacho, & Cohen, 1992;\nVerbrugge & Balaban, 1989). Furthermore, functional\nlimitations are one of many competing outcomes,\nsuch as death, for older persons. Knowledge of the\ndynamics of health transitions is critically important\nfor understanding and elucidating the natural history\nof function as well as for planning medical care and\nUniversity of Chicago Hospital Home Care Research Grant; IBM Corpora-\ntion Faculty Research Fund at the Graduate School of Business, The Univer-\nsity of Chicago.

Most studies\ndichotomize ADL function, classifying respondents\nas either limited or nonlimited with regard to physi-\ncal function. Because ADL functioning has many lev-\nels and is not, therefore, a truly dichotomous mea-\nsure, these analyses mask potentially important\ninformation about more subtle levels of physical\nability as well as movement among various states of\nlimitation.\nMovement, or change in function, has typically\nbeen examined using just two independent mea-\nsurements. As physical function is related to a variety\nof medical conditions and social factors that fluctu-\nate over time, we believe that transitions among\nstates of functional limitation are both diverse and\nhighly dynamic. A more longitudinal perspective,\nincorporating multiple measurements, may better\ncapture the subtleties of movement among states as\nwell as any patterns in this movement.\nCommon stereotypes of aging depict death as a\nlogical extension of limited functional ability. Yet,\nprevious studies have shown that fatal conditions\ndiffer from the conditions associated with functional\nlimitations (Rudberg & Cassel, 1993). Although few\nstudies have explicitly examined the relationship be-\ntween functional limitations and death, we believe\nthat these two conditions are not highly linked.\nIn this article, we examine the six-year history of\nfunctional limitations in a sample of noninstitutional-\nized men and women, 70 years of age and older, who\nare living in the United States. The primary purpose of\nthe article is to examine the probabilities of making\ntransitions from one state of limitation to another,\nusing death as a competing outcome, over a series of\ntwo-year time periods. In so doing, we are able to\ndocument the degree of change experienced by per-\nsons in the study sample and to detect typical patterns\nof change. The analyses are adjusted for gender and\nage, because these variables have been found to be\nstrongly associated with functional limitations.\nMethods\nData\nThe Longitudinal Study on Aging (LSOA), a joint\nproject of the National Institute on Aging and the\nNational Center for Health Statistics, is a prospec-\ntive study of the changes in health and functional\nability that accompany the process of aging in the\nLSOA monitored a representative sample (n =\n5,151) of the nation's noninstitutionalized civilian\npopulation, 70 years of age and older, for six years\neach subject's health, functional abilities and other\ncharacteristics was obtained through in-home inter-\nviews in 1984. Follow-up information was collected\nevery two years through telephone interviews and\ncontinuously through Medicare records and the Na-\ntional Death Index.\nMeasures\nADL Functional Limitation Measures. -- In this\narticle, functional limitations are defined as self-\nreported difficulty (yes/no) with the following ADLs:\n(a) bathing, (b) dressing, (c) eating, (d) getting in/out\nof bed/chair, and (e) toileting. At each time period,\nthe level or state of a person's functional limitation is\nthe sum of these ADL limitations. This measure\ntherefore ranges from 0 (no functional limitations) to\n5 (complete functional limitations).\nSelf-reported difficulty with an activity is used to\nmeasure functional limitation in order to best repre-\nsent a person's ability. Compared with other mea-\nsures of functional ability (e.g., receiving help with a\nparticular activity), difficulty performing an activity\nmay be more influenced by a person's individual\ncapacity and less reflective of environmental influ-\nences. Previous studies have also shown self-\nreported ADL limitations to be a valid measure (Elam\nFunctional Limitation Pathways. -- Interviews for\nthis study, those years correspond to the time points\nt = 0, 1, 2, 3. Each time point is called a wave, and\neach wave represents a two-year time history. Per-\nsons with missing data were excluded from the study\nsample so that each person can be represented by a\nfourtuple, each element of which represents his or\nher ADL state or level for a particular wave.\nWe define a functional limitation pathway for a\nperson as the fourtuple\n),\nwhere ADL, denotes a person's ADL limitation state at\ntime t. For example, a person who had no ADL\nrepresented by the sequence (0,2,2,4). A person who\nhad four ADL limitations in 1984, five ADL limitations\nthe sequence (4,5,D,D), where D represents death.\nAnalyses\nWe modeled the wave-to-wave probabilities of\ntransitioning among levels of functional limitation\nand of dying. The ADL states 0,..., 5 are called tran-\nsient, because a person may move from any one of\nthese states to any other. Conversely, death is\ndeemed an absorbing state (see Figure 1).\nTwo separate discrete data regression models\nwere used to model the transitional probabilities at\neach wave. In examining the relationship between\nfunctional limitation and death, we used a binary\nlogistic regression model. An ordinal logistic regres-\nsion model (Walker & Duncan, 1967) was used to\nexamine the transitions among levels of functional\nlimitations. In both models, we controlled for pre-\nvious functional limitation status and gender. We\nadjusted for age by stratifying the study sample into\nage and older, based on age at the outset of each\nwave. Separate models were then fit to each age\nstrata. We tested for time homogeneity in the model\nparameter estimates using a Wald type test, de-\nscribed in detail later. As the data are time-\nhomogeneous, we combined the waves and pro-\nduced one set of parameter estimates for each\nmodel.\nModeling the Relationship Between Functional\nLimitations and Death. -- We use Dit\nto denote the\ndeath status of the /'th individual at wave t, with O,f\n=\n1 denoting dead, and Dit\n= 0 indicating that the\nrespondent was alive at the outset of wave t. We\ndefine previous functional limitation state at time t-\n1 as ADL,;M\nand gender as gender^ Males are coded as\nAt each transition, we fit the following regres-\nsion model:\nlogit[Prob(Dit\n= 1 | ADL,^, gender,, D,M\nK + ,.M\n= s) + Vb\n,,genderif\nwhere the notation l{ADLit\n^ = s) is defined as\n(1 if individual / has ADL state s\nat wave t-1\n0 otherwise\nThe 7x1 parameter vector p, = (po\n,,,Pv, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 /PU' is\nestimated using the maximum likelihood method.\nFrom this we obtain the estimate (3, and an associated\ncovariance matrix.\nWe are interested in testing the hypothesis Ho\n: $,\n- P\n, which would be true if the death process\nFigure 1: Diagram of possible ADL functional limitation\ntransitions.\nis time homogeneous. Because we have repeated\nmeasurements on individuals, the estimates p, are\ncorrelated. Let F denote the estimated covariance\nmatrix of the vector p = (p1;\n/&3)'/ obtained using a\ndenote the 7x7 identity matrix and define the matrix\nThe hypothesis Ho\nmay be represented\nas Ho\n: Cp = 0. The resulting Wald test statistic is 7 =\npC'(CTC)-1Cp, which is distributed as x?4\nunder the\nnull hypothesis.\nIf we fail to reject Ho\n, we may pool our data and\nestimate one logistic model. Maximum likelihood\nestimation assuming independent observations will\nproduce a consistent estimate, but the resulting co-\nvariance estimate will be incorrect because it fails to\naccount for the correlation among observations from\nthe same person. We therefore use a robust covari-\nance matrix estimate described in Diggle, Liang, and\nZeger (1994) to obtain an asymptotically consistent\ncovariance estimate.\nAssuming time homogeneity, we will obtain an\nestimated parameter vector p for each age strata. The\nequality of these three parameter vectors may be\ntested using the same procedure used to test for time\nhomogeneity.\nModeling the Transitions Among Levels of Func-\ntional Limitations. -- At each transition, we fit the\nfollowing ordinal logistic regression model:\nlogit[Prob(ADLit\n^ k \\ ADL^, gender,, Dlt\n+ ^ = s) + ^gender,,\nThis model is conditional on an individual remaining\nalive for the duration of the wave. As with the logistic\nmodel, the parameter vector p, = (po\n,t/\npi,f/\n,,)' is\nestimated using the maximum likelihood method,\nresulting in the estimated vector p, and an associated\ncovariance matrix.\nWe use the same testing procedure as mentioned\nin the previous section to test the hypothesis Ho\n: $, =\n. If we fail to reject Ho\n, we may pool the data\nand obtain one parameter estimate p. As before, a\nrobust covariance matrix estimate is needed because\nwe have repeated measures on the same individuals.\nAssuming time homogeneity, the estimated transi-\ntion probabilities may be displayed in a 6x6 transi-\ntion probability matrix of the following form:\nPigender, age strata) = (p/y\n) =\nState at\nPoo\nPio\nPso\nState at Time\nPoi\nPsi\nt\nPM\nPis\nPss\nEach row in the matrix represents a state from which\npersons may move, and each column represents a\nstate to which persons may move. For a given age\nstrata and gender,\npkl\n= Prob(ADLt\n= / | ADLt\n_, = k, age, gender,\nis calculated using the pooled estimate of p. Note\nthat the sum of each row in the transition matrix is\nequal to 1.\nLife Expectancy. -- The discrete data regression\nmodels produce estimates for (a) the probabilities of\ndying within two years, conditional on current func-\ntional limitation state, age strata and gender, and (b)\nthe probabilities of transitioning to another func-\ntional limitation state (excluding death) within two\nyears, conditional on the same variables. By combin-\ning these probabilities (and assuming time homoge-\nneity of the parameter estimates), we obtain a 7x7\ntransition probability matrix, which conveys the\nprobabilities of transitioning among different levels\nof functional limitation while accounting for death as\na competing risk factor:\nPdgender, age, strata) = (p/y\n) =\nState at\nPcoo\nPio\nco\nP$o\nPso\nPoi\nPn\nState at Time\nP*\nPh\nP\u00ab\nP\u00ab\nPM\nPM\nt\nP^s\np*\nPis\nDeath\nPoo\nPAD\nPso\nFor a given age strata and gender,\npkD\n= Prob(Dt\n= 1 | ADL,_i = k, ageit\ngender),\nand\npi, = Prob(ADL, = I \\ ADL,., = k, ageif\ngender) =\npk\n,(\\-pkD\nNote that the sum of each row in the transition matrix\nis equal t o 1 .\nWith the complete transition probability matrix,\nwe can estimate the average duration of time a per-\nson will spend in each limitation level using a simula-\ntion study. We simulate 1,000 people, with a particu-\nlar age, gender and initial limitation level in 1984. We\nthen use the complete transition probability matrices\nto simulate the movement of these people until\ndeath, recording how often an individual visits any\nlimitation level. By averaging over all 1,000 individ-\nuals, we obtain expected life expectancy and ex-\npected time spent in each functional limitation level.\nMissing Data and the Study Sample\nThe LSOA followed a core sample of 5,151 men and\nwomen through all four waves of data collection. Of\ndata at all waves, or complete ADL data prior to\ndeath. These 3,890 respondents are included in our\nanalyses.\nThe remaining 1,261 respondents were missing\ndata on one or more ADL measures across the four\nwaves of the study. In some cases (e.g., the respon-\ndent was in a nursing home or hospital, or the re-\nspondent had moved and could not be located) no\nfollow-up interview was conducted. For most per-\nsons, the reason for noninterview was unspecified.\nAlternatively, some respondents who were inter-\nviewed refused to answer one or more questions\nrelating specifically to ADL function.\nOf the 1,261 respondents excluded from the sam-\nple, only 15 had missing ADL data across all four\nwaves of the study; 10 of the 15 were respondents\nwho died having never provided complete ADL in-\nformation at any previous wave. Excluding the 55\nrespondents with missing ADL data at baseline, 266\nrespondents out of 1,206 had missing ADL data in\nhaving provided complete ADL information only at\nbaseline. These data indicate that the vast majority of\nexcluded respondents did not fail to respond to an\nADL question and then permanently drop out of the\nsample due to death or to continued nonresponse.\nRather, most persons with missing ADL information\nin a given wave provided complete ADL data at the\nnext interview.\nIn order to determine whether and how the 3,890\npersons included in our study sample differ at base-\nline from the 1,261 who were excluded, we com-\npared the sociodemographic characteristics, func-\ntional limitations, and health status of the two\ngroups. In 1984, the average age of members of the\nyears (see Table 1). Eighty-eight percent of the sam-\nple were white and 62% were female; 19% had a post\nhigh school education. Excluded respondents had\nvery similar characteristics. This group had an aver-\nEighty-five percent of the sample were white and 69%\nwere female; 14% had a post high school education.\nThe two groups also had similar distributions of\nADL limitations and levels of self-reported health at\nexcluded from the sample, 55 were missing ADL data\nat baseline; therefore, the values displayed in Table 2\nare based only on the 1,206 respondents with com-\nplete data in 1984. Twenty-two persons in the study\nsample and 16 persons in the excluded sample failed\nto report on their health status at baseline; they are\nexcluded from Table 3. Because of the similarity in\nhealth status and sociodemographic characteristics\nbetween our study sample and the excluded sample,\nwe felt no need to impute the missing cases.\nResults\nADL States\nThe number of persons per wave with each level of\nADL limitation is displayed in Table 4.

Approxi-\nmately 15% of the remaining sample died during\neach wave.\nMost persons are free of any functional limitations\nat each wave, though this number decreases from\n81% in the first wave to 58% in the final wave. Of\nthose with some level of limitation, the most com-\nmon state at each wave is one ADL limitation. Func-\ntional limitation levels 2 though 5 have a similar\ndistribution of counts across waves.\nTable 4. Counts by ADL State per Wave\nADL State\nDeath*\n\"Counts for death are cumulative.\nTable 5. Functional Limitation Pathways Occurring at Least 10 Times\nNumber of\nOccurrences\nFunctional\nLimitation\nPathway\nNumber of\nOccurrences\nFunctional\nLimitation\nPathway\nPathways\nA total of 1,554 functional limitation pathway com-\nbinations are possible; however, only 401 pathways\nwere experienced by this sample. Of these, 190, or\nnearly 50%, occurred only once. Forty-three path-\nways occurred at least 10 times; these common path-\nways are listed in Table 5. Over 50% of the common\npathways involve death. When these pathways are\nexcluded, only 18 functional limitation pathways are\nreported by 10 or more respondents, illustrating the\ngreat diversity of experience with functional ability in\nthe sample.\nThe most common pathway (followed by 34% of\nthe study sample) is (0,0,0,0), the pathway of no\nfunctional limitation at each wave. The second most\ncommon pathway is (0,D,D,D), or no functional limi-\ntation followed by death. The pathways (0,0,D,D)\nand (0,0,0,D) are the third and fifth most common.\nsix-year period occurred among respondents with no\nfunctional limitations at any previous wave. An addi-\ntional 1% of deaths occurred among respondents\nwho had experienced a functional limitation in the\npast, but had reported no limitations at the preced-\ning interview.\nThe Relationship Between Functional Limitations\nand Death\nUsing the Wald-type test outlined in the Methods\nsection, we find that for each age strata, the parame-\nter estimates are time homogeneous (all p values >\n.05). The resulting parameter estimates from combin-\ning the wave information for death in each age strata\nare displayed in Table 6. The test for equality of the\nparameter estimates in each age strata is significant (p\nand 80- to 89-year-olds, all regression covariates are\nstatistically significant (p < .01). For those 90 years of\nage and older, several covariates are not statistically\nsignificant; these effects are described later.\nUsing the covariates significantly associated with\ndeath, the predicted probabilities of dying within two\nyears, conditional on age, gender, and current func-\ntional limitation status, are presented in Table 7. Pre-\ndicted probabilities are given along with standard\nerrors of the estimate. Given the same function limita-\ntion level, the probability of dying increases with age.\nFor example, women 70 to 79 years old reporting\ndifficulty with three ADLs have a 21% (with a 95%\nTable 6.

This pattern holds across\ndifferent levels of functional limitations as well as for\nmales.\nGender is also an important determinant of risk for\ndeath in the two younger age strata. Men in the two\nyounger cohorts are more likely to die than women\nwith similar levels of functional limitation. The risks\nwith the same functional limitation level as the\nwomen just described (three ADL limitations) are\nrelative advantage for women holds across all levels\nof limitation. This notable sex-effect disappears in\nthe oldest age group. Men and women 90 years of\nage and older with similar levels of physical function\nare equally likely to die during the succeeding mea-\nsurement interval (p = .11).\nThe addition of one ADL limitation has different\neffects on the probability of death depending upon\nage and the previous number of limitations. For 70-\nto 79-year-olds, the probability of dying is roughly\nequal given difficulty with two, three, or four ADLs,\nfor both men and women. For 80- to 89-year-olds, the\nrelationship between functional limitation and death\nis more clearly incremental; each additional limita-\ntion significantly increases the risk of death. In the\noldest age group, men and women reporting one\nADL limitation are no more likely to die within the\nsucceeding two-year period than those with full\nfunctional ability (p = .16). Thereafter, however, the\nrisk of dying is significantly elevated with each addi-\ntional ADL limitation.\nIn general, men and women with higher levels of\nfunctional limitations are at greater risk for death\nthan those reporting no difficulty with ADL measures\nor low levels of functional limitations. Among 80- to\n89-year-old women, those with five ADL limitations\nare five times more likely to die in the ensuing two-\nyear interval than women with none, and 1.5 times\nmore likely to die than women with three ADL limita-\ntions. Nonetheless, women's probability of dying\nwithin a two-year period given five ADL limitations\nmen and women with five ADL limitations have a\ntwo-year probability of survival greater than 30%.\nTherefore, although functional limitation confers ad-\nditional risk for death, these phenomena, are not\nalways closely associated.\nTransitions Among Levels of Functional Limitations\nUsing the Wald-type test outlined in the Methods\nsection, we find that for each age strata, the parame-\nter estimates are time homogeneous (all p values >\n.05). The resulting parameter estimates from combin-\ning the information across waves are displayed in\nTable 8. The test for equality of the parameter esti-\nmates among the 3 age strata was significant (p =\n.012), indicating an age effect for functional transi-\ntions. Unlike the relationship between functional\nlimitations and death, the transitions older people\nmake from one level of functional limitation to an-\nother are not influenced by gender. In each age\ngroup, men and women are equally likely to experi-\nence a shift in ADL status within the two-year mea-\nsurement interval. The estimated transition matrices\nusing the significant variables from the ordinal logis-\ntic regression model are displayed in Table 9.\nTransitions are influenced by age and by the level\nof functional limitation reported in the previous\nmeasurement wave. Men and women reporting no\nfunctional limitations are most likely to remain in this\ncategory two years later, though that probability de-\ncreases with age. Limitation-free individuals 70 to 79\ntaining full functional ability during the succeeding\nhighly limited men and women -- those reporting\ndifficulty with all five measured ADLs -- are most\n89-year-olds, the probability of reporting five func-\ntional limitations at two consecutive interviews is\n63% with accuracy of \u00b130% for the younger age\nthose at least 90 years of age, this probability in-\ncreases to 75%. However, this last estimate is particu-\nlarly unstable due to the small number of persons\nwith such characteristics.\nPersons with levels of functional limitation some-\nwhere between these two extremes display a signifi-\ncant degree of movement among ADL states over\nTable 8.

Although the data indicate a great deal of het-\nerogeneity in these transitions, some general trends\nare noted. Given one to three ADL limitations, youn-\nger men and women are more likely to transition to a\nlower level of functional limitation than older indi-\nviduals. Among those reporting two ADL limitations,\n32%) probability of reporting one limitation and a\ntions at the next interview. For 80- to 89-year-olds,\nthe probability of transitioning to either of these\nFor those 90 years of age and older, the likelihood of\nexperiencing these improvements in functional abil-\nestimate is very unstable due to the the small number\nof persons with such characteristics.\nBy contrast, given four or five previous limitations,\nmen and women in all three age groups show similar\nand low probabilities of reducing their level of func-\ntional limitation. The probability of reporting any\ndegree of improved function, given four ADL limita-\ntions at the previous interview, is less than 50% for all\nage groups. The probabilities of returning to a\nand 4% (3%-6%) for those in the youngest to the\noldest age cohorts, and 2% or less at any age for\nthose with five ADL limitations.\nComplete Transition Matrices and Life Expectancy\nBy combining the probabilities of dying with the\nprobabilities of moving among functional limitation\nstates, we are able to create complete functional\ntransition matrices (see Tables 10 and 11). These\nmatrices convey the probabilities of transitioning\namong different levels of functional limitation while\naccounting for death as a competing risk factor. For\nexample, limitation-free women, 70 to 79 years of\nfull functional ability during the succeeding interval.\n(30%-45%), respectively. These probabilities are\nlower than those found in Table 9, where the com-\npeting risk of death is not considered.\nThe probability of experiencing a specific func-\ntional limitation pathway may be computed using the\ntransition matrix. For example, for an 87-year-old\nman with no limitations in 1984, the probability of\ngoing through the pathway (0,0,0,0) is given by\nexperiencing a transition to another level of limita-\ntion or dying over the study period is therefore 87%.\nThe pathway likelihoods just described are condi-\ntional on the initial functional limitation state. To\ncalculate the unconditional likelihood of experienc-\ning various pathways, we need the initial age and\ngender-specific state probabilities. For example, for\n70- to 79-year-old women, the probability of having\nno ADL limitations in 1984 is estimated from the data\nto be 85%. The unconditional likelihood of a 78-year-\nold woman experiencing the pathway (0,1,1,2) is\nGiven an initial ADL functional limitation level,\nTables 12 and 13 show the average length of time in\nyears persons will spend in each state prior to death\nmales with three previous ADL limitations will spend\nan additional 1.2 years in that state, 2.7 years with no\nlimitations, and a fraction of a year in all other\nlimitation states. The sum of these durations equals\nthe average life expectancy (in years) for similar\nindividuals.\nThe tables show a clear decline in life expectancy\nbased on initial ADL limitation level, regardless of\nage and gender. Seventy-year-old men with no pre-\nvious limitations live, on average, 1.5 times longer\nthan those with two initial limitations and 2.6 times\nlonger than those with five. Nonlimited 80-year-old\nmen live 1.5 and 2.5 times longer than more limited\nmen (those with two and five limitations) the same\nthan their more limited age-mates. A similar diminu-\ntion in relative life expectancies is experienced by\nwomen. Absolute life expectancy for nonlimited\nmen ranges from 10.9 years for the youngest age\ngroup to 6.1 years for the oldest group.\nDiscussion\nLongitudinal data collected for the LSOA over a six-\nyear period and at four separate interviews provide a\nTable 9.

Conceptualizing limitation in\nterms of levels or degrees rather than as an either/or\nphenomenon allows us to more accurately describe\nlimitations in older persons, detect changes in their\nfunctional ability, and describe patterns in these\ntransitions. Given current demographic trends, this\ninformation is becoming increasingly vital.\nMen and women in this sample are extremely\nheterogeneous with respect to the patterns of limita-\ntion they experience. Few limitation pathways are\nfollowed by 10 or more people, and over 50% of the\npathways are unique. Most transitions have a signifi-\ncant probability of occurring. However, the probabil-\nity of acquiring additional limitations or of regaining\nphysical function is not a purely random process;\nrather, it is strongly influenced by age and by pre-\nvious level of functional ability.\nIn general, men and women with either high or\nlow levels of limitation tend to maintain this status,\nwhereas those with medium levels of limitation show\na great deal of movement and approximately equal\nprobabilities of transitioning to any level of limita-\ntion. Age is an important modifying factor in this\nprocess. The probabilities of acquiring additional\nlimitations generally increase with age, whereas the\nprobabilities of regaining physical function de-\ncrease. However, these effects are not entirely uni-\nform; each age group exhibits unique likelihoods of\nacquiring or improving functional limitations based\non their previous status.\nIn this study, gender is unrelated to movement\namong levels of functional limitation; men and\nwomen are equally likely to experience improve-\nments or declines in function over the study period.\nThis finding contradicts the results of previous stud-\nies, which have generally shown women to be more\nlikely to experience declines in function. However,\nmany of these studies fail to account for death as a\ncompeting risk for older persons. Because male mor-\ntality is generally higher than female mortality, the\nprobability of women experiencing a transition is\nlikely to be higher, given their relative longevity.\nWhen morbidity and mortality are examined as dis-\ntinct outcomes and the conditional probabilities of\nexperiencing each are calculated, this gender effect\nfor transitions may disappear.\nAs in other research, we found gender to be an\nimportant determinant of risk for death in all but the\noldest persons studied. This study demonstrates\nthat men are more likely to die than women who are\nthe same age with the same level of functional limi-\ntation. One likely explanation for the disappearance\nof this gender effect for mortality has to do with the\nincreasing and eventually overriding importance of\nage. The differential effects of gender on morbidity\nand mortality found in this study demonstrate the\nneed to apply separate models to the study of these\noutcomes.\nAlthough popular stereotypes portray aging as a\nprocess involving a decline in physical function fol-\nlowed by death, we found numerous exceptions to\nthis relationship. Indeed, nearly half of the study\nsample die having never reported an ADL limitation\nat the previous interviews. Among men and women\nreporting ADL limitations, we documented a graded\nrelationship between the number of limitations and\nthe subsequent risk of death, which is higher for men\n(except in the oldest age group) and increases with\nage, but is not entirely uniform. Yet, even highly\nlimited men and women have a probability of dying\nthat is less than 50% until age 90. In addition, average\nlife expectancy for men with five ADL limitations\nranges from 3.0 to 4.1 years, and for women with five\nADL limitations from 3.0 to 5.9 years. Therefore,\nalthough the probabilities of dying are greater given\nhigh limitation levels, death is not imminent, even\nfor the highly limited.\nKnowledge of the degree and pattern of functional\nlimitation transitions has important implications for\nthe provision of health services for older persons and\nfor the formulation of public policy. This information\nmay help us to better predict future transitions and\ndevelop strategies to postpone the acquisition of ad-\nditional limitations in community-dwelling older pop-\nulations. These findings also underscore the need to\nensure the provision of services that accommodate\nthe needs of older persons who differ widely in terms\nof functional ability and whose limitation status is\nhighly dynamic. Finally, this study highlights the need\nfor further research that examines how medical con-\nditions, health care utilization, and environmental\ninfluences affect limitation status and the transitions\nof older persons among levels of limitation.\nReferences\nBranch, L.
