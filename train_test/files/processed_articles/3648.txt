Globalization,\nshifting social and demographic trends, enhanced knowl-\nedge of workforce, and rapid technological innovations\nhave created a need among organizational top manage-\nment to utilize all their efforts toward bringing organiza-\ntional change (Graetz, 2000). Leadership is identified as\none of the most important factors for this successful trans-\nformation (Kotter, 1995). It is considered as a key con-\ntributor towards building organizational capacity for\nchange (Judge, 2011), as organizations aim to enhance\ntheir capacity to change requires effective and trustworthy\n2006). These leaders organize and align followers toward\na common goal by giving them direction and defining the\nmost appropriate behaviors and attitudes needed for\ntrusting followers that ultimately leads to enhanced capac-\nity for organizations to change (Judge, Bowler, & Douglas,\nThe available literature provides evidence that the busi-\nness environment is changing rapidly and becoming impul-\nsive and volatile. Organizations try to cope with such\nenvironment and initiate change, but at times they fail due to\npoor change management and lack of change leadership\nleaders and organizational change agents are essential to deal\nwith the unpredictable and hypercompetitive organizational\nenvironment (Judge, 2011). Therefore, new dimensions for\neffectively managing changes are continuously explored to\nhelp an organization best handle the process of change.\nOrganizational change capacity (OCC) is a relatively new\ntheoretical development for effectively managing change\n1Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Johor Bahru, Malaysia\n2Dhofar University, Salalah, Oman\n3Abbottabad University of Science and Technology, Havelian, Pakistan\nCorresponding Author:\nMuhammad Yasir, Faculty of Management, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,\nEmail: Ymuhammad4@live.utm.my\nLeadership Styles in Relation to\nEmployees' Trust and Organizational\nChange Capacity: Evidence From\nNon-Profit Organizations\nMuhammad Yasir1, Rabia Imran2, Muhammad Kashif Irshad3,\nNoor Azmi Mohamad1, and Muhammad Muddassar Khan1\n Keywords\nleadership styles, employees' trust, organizational change capacity, non-profit organizations\n2 SAGE Open\nmultidimensional capability that enables an organization to\nupgrade or revise existing organizational competencies, while\ncultivating new competencies that enable the organization to\nsurvive and prosper\" (p. 14). Comprehension of the OCC\nconstruct is still in its refinement stages (Judge, 2011).\nTherefore, empirical researchers are required to observe its\nefficacy and the impact that various related concepts (i.e.,\nleadership and trust) can place on it (Judge, 2011; Soparnot,\n2011). Effective navigation of the organization through\nchange capacity development requires involvement of all the\nemployees. It requires trust of the employees in leadership\nship, via building trust of the employees, can surely get them\nparticipating in the change process, thereby contributing to\nthe change capacity of an organization. Therefore, the change\ncapacity of an organization, to a great extent, depends upon\nthe leaders. This is the reason that leadership is extremely\nimportant and crucial for the effective management and\nimplementation of organizational change (Higgs, 2003; Higgs\nPakistan is an important part of Asia-South Pacific, where\nphilanthropic and voluntary activities have a long history.\nThese activities are accomplished in the areas of health, civil\nrights, social welfare, and education. Such activities emerge\nout of national culture with strong influence of Islamic ideol-\nogy. The people of Pakistan trust these organizations more\nthan the government organizations and donate generously to\nthem; despite being a developing country, Pakistani society\ncontributes massively to the non-profit organizations\n(Pakistan Center for Philanthropy, 2015). Thus, non-profit\norganizations play an important role in Pakistan and to meet\nthe philanthropic needs of the growing population of\nPakistan, they should continuously improve and upgrade\nthemselves. Therefore, research is needed to observe the fac-\ntors that influence the change process, and for this reason,\nthis research intends to examine the factors (leadership and\nemployees' trust) that influence the change capacity of these\norganizations.\nThe current study focuses on finding the effect of leader-\nship styles on OCC through the mediating role of employees'\ntrust. The study is novel and original for many reasons. First,\nfew studies in the previous literature depict that there is a\nlack of empirical research on the notion of OCC both in the\nWestern and Asian contexts, and relatively little is known\nabout its antecedent conditions (Judge, 2011; Judge et al.,\nSecond, the literature on the relationship between OCC and\nleadership (i.e., transformational leadership, transactional\nleadership, and laissez-faire leadership) lacks attention.\nThird, the study incorporates employees' trust as a mediator\nin the relationship between leadership styles and OCC.\nFinally, the study is based on the evidence from non-profit\norganizations that have been working in Pakistan for decades\non social, economic, and developmental issues.\nObjectives of the current study are to examine the rela-\ntionship between leadership styles (transformational, trans-\nactional, and laissez-faire) and OCC, to investigate the\nrelationship between leadership styles and employees' trust,\nand to examine employees'trust as a mediator in the relation-\nship between leadership styles and OCC, specifically in the\nnon-profit organizations working in Pakistan.\nLiterature Review\nLeadership\nOrganizations exist for different purposes. Such as, commu-\nnity-based organizations exist to empower the community,\nwhereas business-oriented organizations are to generate and\nmaximize profits. To achieve their objectives, leadership of\nthese organizations plays an important role. Several leader-\nship models exist; however, the full range leadership model\nproposes that the leadership process is a continuum that\nstarts from the non-effective leadership approach that is lais-\nsez-faire leadership and moves toward an involving leader-\nship approach that is transactional leadership and ends at\ntransformational leadership, a motivating and inspiring lead-\nTransformational leadership is known for its change ori-\nented leadership style at the organizational, group, and indi-\nvidual level of analysis with positive outcomes (Judge &\nPiccolo, 2004). Transformational leadership comprises four\nidealized influence is the degree to which the leader instills\nvalues, beliefs, respect, a strong sense of purpose, and collec-\ntive sense of mission; intellectual stimulation is the ability to\naccept different perspectives and stimulate thinking; indi-\nvidualized consideration is appreciating each individual's\ncontribution; and inspirational motivation is the ability to\nmotivate and inspire subordinates. These leaders are able to\ncommunicate considerable standards, encourage and pro-\nmote followers to align with organizational goals to attain\nperformance objectives (Imran, Zahoor, & Zaheer, 2012;\nKelloway, Barling, & Helleur, 2000), and assist in enhancing\nemployee satisfaction and innovative work behavior (Fatima,\nHowever, transactional leaders accomplish goals by reward-\ning subordinates who meet their expectations (Bass & Avolio,\n1990a). These rewards may come in the form of pay increase,\nadvancement, and recognition. However, employees who fail\nto perform well are penalized. Such transactions or exchanges\nare characterized as effective transactional leadership (Bass,\nAvolio, Jung, & Berson, 2003). Moreover, a laissez-faire lead-\nership refers to indifferent or a lack of leadership (Xirasagar,\n2008). Therefore, scholars view that both transformational and\ntransactional leadership styles are necessary for an organiza-\ntion in different circumstances. As transformational leadership\nperforms well when an organization is experiencing rapid\nYasir et al. 3\nchange, transactional leadership is suitable for an organization\noperating in a stable environment (Castiglione, 2006).\nOCC\nOCC is known as the combination of organizational and\nmanagerial capabilities that allows an enterprise to adapt\nmore effectively and quickly than its competition to chang-\ndescribed OCC as \"a dynamic, multidimensional capability\nthat enables an organization to upgrade or revise existing\norganizational competencies, while cultivating new compe-\ntencies that enable the organization to survive and prosper\"\n(p. 14). This dynamic capability is critical for all forms of\norganizations at some point of time (Oxtoby et al., 2002) and\nis associated with higher levels of organizational perfor-\nenables organizations to adapt and settle old capacities as\nwell as to cope with newly emerging opportunities (Judge &\nOCC is affected by human capabilities, structural arrange-\nments, statutes, rules, and regulations that are important for\nroutine operations and new developments (Judge & Douglas,\ndistinct but interrelated dimensions of OCC concerning\nissues of formal organizational processes, informational\norganizational culture and human capabilities. The identified\ndimensions of OCC are as follows:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Trustworthy leadership is the ability of top manage-\nment to earn the trust of employees and to guide them\nalong the path to achieve collective goals.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Innovative culture is the ability of an organization to\nencourage innovative activities and establish norms of\ninnovation.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Involved mid-management refers to the ability of mid-\ndle managers/supervisors to effectively link senior\nofficials with the rest of the organization.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Trusting followers is the ability of non-executive\nemployees' willingness to follow a new path provided\nby the organizational top management, or to construc-\ntively dissent it.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Capable champions refers to the ability of an organi-\nzation to attract, empower, and retain change leaders\nto emerge and evolve.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 System thinking is the ability of an organization to rec-\nognize interdependencies within and outside the\norganization.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Effective communication refers to the ability of an\norganization to effectively communicate horizontally,\nvertically, and with customers.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Accountable culture is the ability of the organization\nto successfully meet pre-determined deadlines and to\ncarefully manage resources (Judge & Douglas, 2009).\nLeadership and OCC\nLeadership has been linked to a variety of positive outcomes\nin the previous literature (Khan et al., 2014; Yasir &\nMohamad, 2016). There is lucid evidence that leadership\nplays a key role in the process of change and its significant\nimpact on successful change implementations (Higgs, 2003;\nDa Silva, 2013). Transformational leadership is considered\nto be the most appropriate leadership style for effectively\nmanaging the change process. These leaders not only influ-\nence the change process but also facilitate the change process\nwith their interactive leadership style (Long & Mao, 2008;\nNorthouse, 2007). These leaders are good mentors who\nevoke emotions, foster a trustworthy climate (Harms &\nCred\u00e9, 2010), and provide a vision for change (Bennis &\nthat individuals must incorporate and adopt the behaviors of\nthe transformational leadership style for successfully manag-\ning and implementing organizational change. Thus, this\nstudy assumes that transformational leadership will be posi-\ntively associated with OCC. Therefore, it is postulated as\nfollows:\nHypothesis 1: Transformational leadership is positively\nrelated with OCC.\nChange is facilitated by a transactional leadership style as\nit rewards the positive outcomes (Lowe, Kroeck, &\nSivasubramaniam, 1996). Scholars view that leaders should\nbe interactive, supportive, and dynamic to acknowledge the\nefforts of the employees and their achievements by reward-\nTherefore, previous literature shows a positive relationship\nbetween transactional leadership and organizational change\n(Long & Mao, 2008). Moreover, when transactional leaders\nfocus on rewards (contingent reward), managing incentives,\nand meeting quality standards, they play an important role in\nsupporting and managing organizational change process\n(Bass &Avolio, 1990a). Therefore, the present study assumes\nthat transactional leadership will be positively associated\nwith OCC. Thus, it is hypothesized as follows:\nHypothesis 2: Transactional leadership is positively\nrelated with OCC.\nDuring the change phase, a continuous interaction\nbetween the leader and followers is vital for success (Kotter,\n1995). However, in the case of laissez-faire leadership, there\nis minimal interaction between leaders and followers\n(Northouse, 2007). Therefore, laissez-faire leadership nega-\ntively influences the organizational change process (Lutz\nAllen et al., 2013) and negatively influences the change\ncapability of an organization (Long & Mao, 2008). Therefore,\nthe current study assumes that laissez-faire leadership will\n4 SAGE Open\nhave a negative relationship with OCC. So, this study pro-\nposes the following:\nHypothesis 3: Laissez-faire leadership is negatively\nrelated with OCC.\nEmployees' Trust\nEmployees' trust in their leadership is widely acknowledged\nas a critical determinant of organizational effectiveness\n(Chughtai, Byrne, & Flood, 2015). Previous literature shows\nthat employees trust in their leadership can lead toward desir-\nable outcomes, such as a higher level of performance (Neves\n& Caetano, 2009) and greater exchange of ideas and knowl-\nedge (Renzl, 2008). In previous literature, trust has been con-\nceptualized in several different ways. For instance, Nyhan\nand Marlowe (1997) viewed trust as \"the level of confidence\nthat one individual has in another's competence and his or her\nwillingness to act in a fair, ethical, and predictable manner\"\n(p. 616). Moreover, Rousseau, Sitkin, Burt, and Camerer\n(1998) defined trust as \"a psychological state comprising the\nintention to accept vulnerability based upon positive expecta-\ntions of the intentions or behavior of another\" (p. 395). Thus,\ntrust comprises the individuals' beliefs, assumptions, and\nexpectations regarding the positive outcomes of others'future\nbehavior (Robinson, 1996). In addition, previous literature\nshows that individuals with varying cultural, social, and intel-\nlectual background differ in their propensity to trust (Hofstede,\nLeadership and Employees' Trust\nSuccessful leaders create and maintain employees' trust\nthrough their leadership behavior (Bennis, 2002). Likewise,\na transformational leader understands the individual capa-\nbilities and needs of followers, and demonstrates that they\ncare about followers; therefore, these leaders can be trusted\nTransformational leaders' practice individualized support\nand foster acceptance of group goals, which are positively\nrelated to trust in leadership (Butler, Cantrell, & Flick, 1999;\nMacKenzie, Podsakoff, & Rich, 2001). Similarly, Gillespie\nand Mann (2004) argued that, when leaders act in a way that\nbuilds respect, pride, and confidence of their followers, they\nwill be trusted. Therefore, employees who believe that their\nsupervisors are engaged in transformational leadership\nbehavior will have a higher degree of trust in their leadership\n(Holtz & Harold, 2008). Therefore, this study hypothesizes\nthe following:\nHypothesis 4: Transformational leadership is positively\nrelated with employees' trust.\nThere exists mixed reporting on the effect of transactional\nleadership on employees' trust. Transactional leadership, in\ncontrast to transformational leadership, is believed to not\nacquire a higher level of trust between leaders and followers\n(Jung & Avolio, 2000). Some empirical studies report that\ntransactional leadership does not influence employees trust\nin the leader (Pillai, Schriesheim, & Williams, 1999;\nPodsakoff, MacKenzie, Moorman, & Fetter, 1990), whereas\nother studies report a positive association between transac-\ntional leadership and employees' trust in the leader (Dirks &\nsubordinates for their compliance with the set directions\n(Bass & Riggio, 2006) and leadership style, equipped with a\ncontingent reward will contribute toward trust-building pro-\ncess (Gillespie & Mann, 2004). These leaders admire a fol-\nlower's achievements through providing contingent rewards,\nthus building employees' trust in their leadership (Shamir,\n1995). Therefore, this study proposes the following:\nHypothesis 5: Transactional leadership is positively\nrelated with employees' trust.\nLaissez-faire leadership has an unattractive characteristic\ntoward the trust-building process (Bass, 1985). Employees'\ntrust in their leadership requires leadership's presence, con-\nstant support, and input from the leaders. However, laissez-\nfaire leadership style means absence of leadership with no or\nminimal interaction with employees (Northouse, 2007).\nTherefore, scholars assert that laissez-faire leadership fails to\ndevelop employees' trust in the leader (Gillespie & Mann,\nfollowing:\nHypothesis 6: Laissez-faire leadership is negatively asso-\nciated with employees' trust.\nEmployees' Trust and OCC\nOCC requires the trust of employees in their organization\nchange attempts are stifled, if employees'trust in their leader\nis inadequate (Ert\u00fcrk, 2008). Moreover, employees' trust in\ntheir leadership and organization makes them dedicated to\nbring about successful change with greater commitment;\nthus, the trusting followers become an aide for the overall\nchange capacity of the organization (Judge, 2011). Thus,\nscholars argue about the significance of employees' trust for\nOCC in an organization (Judge & Douglas, 2009; Soparnot,\n2011). Therefore, this study hypothesizes the following:\nHypothesis 7: Employees' trust is positively related with\nOCC, Employees' Trust, and Leadership\nScholars argue about the significance of trust as a core emo-\ntional and cognitive process in the dynamics of the\nYasir et al. 5\nleader\u00adfollower's relationship (Bligh & Kohles, 2013). Trust\nleads to greater employee confidence in a leader's fair inten-\ntions behind the change (Harvey, Royal, & Stout, 2003). Past\nresearch demonstrates that trust in leadership is an important\nelement for organizational change (Smollan, 2013), and\nmight be as a consequence or a predecessor of the relation-\nship at work (Neves & Caetano, 2009; Saunders & Thornhill,\nScholars argue that effective goal achievement by the\nemployees of an organization during the change phase is\nsolely dependent upon the level of trust employees have in\ntheir leadership (Kotter, 1995). Scholars also identified that\ninterpersonal trust within the team members is important for\nan organization to perform well during the change phase. It\nis dependent upon the way a leader treats her or his subordi-\nnates or team members (Ferrin & Dirks, 2003). Therefore,\nthis study proposes the following hypotheses:\nHypothesis 8: Employees' trust mediates the relationship\nbetween transformational leadership and OCC.\nHypothesis 9: Employees' trust mediates the relationship\nbetween transactional leadership and OCC.\nHypothesis 10: Employees' trust mediates the relation-\nship between laissez-faire leadership and OCC.\nMethod\nSampling\nThe current study was based on the survey of 11 non-profit\norganizations in Pakistan. The sampling frame addressed the\nnon-profit, community, and project-based organizations\nworking for women's development (civil rights, education,\nhealth, and economic empowerment) in Pakistan. Data were\ncollected from a convenient sample of managers, coordina-\ntors, officers, community facilitators, social organizers, and\nactivists through questionnaires. A total number of 250\nrespondents were sent the questionnaire, and usable ques-\ntionnaires were 204 with a response rate of 81%. The sample\nbelonged to the age group of 25 to 40 years, and 21% employ-\nees belonged to the age group of 40 to 55 years.\nInstruments and Control Variables\nLeadership styles (transformational, transactional, and lais-\nsez-faire) were measured by using the \"Multifactor\nLeadership Questionnaire\" by Bass and Avolio (1995). The\ninstrument comprises 36 items, that is, 20 items for transfor-\nmational leadership, 12 items for transactional leadership,\nand four items for laissez-faire leadership. A sample item\nfrom the instrument is as follows: \"My supervisor expresses\nconfidence that goals will be achieved.\" The employees'\nlevel of trust in their leader was measured by a scale devel-\noped by Robinson and Rousseau (1994). It comprises seven\nitems with a sample item as follows: \"In general, I believe\nmy supervisor's motives and intentions are good\" and \"I am\nnot sure that I fully trust my supervisor\"; the latter item was\nreverse coded. The capacity of an organization for change\nwas measured through the OCC scale developed by Judge\ninclude the following: \"Do frontline employees have oppor-\ntunities to voice their concerns about change?\" All items\nwere rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale, anchored at 0 = not\nat all, 1 = once in a while, 2 = sometimes, 3 = fairly often, and\n4 = frequently, if not always.\nAge, gender, level of experience, current position, and\nlevel of education were tested as control variables to test\ntheir effect on dependent variables. The results indicated that\nthese demographic variables had an insignificant effect on\nthe dependent variable OCC; thus, they can be treated as\ncontrol variables.\nResults\nThis section illustrates the results of statistical procedures\napplied to test the hypothesized model. This section is\ndivided into two parts. First part deals with the reliability and\nvalidity of the measurement model using Cronbach's alpha\nand inter-construct correlation. In addition, this part also pro-\nvides the descriptive statistics of the constructs. Second part\ndeals with the structural model validation through direct and\nindirect effects.\nTable 1 exhibits the mean, standard deviation, reliability\nstatistics, and correlation matrix of the variables. Results\nindicate values for Cronbach's alpha which are .93 for OCC,\n.87 for transformational leadership, .81 for transactional\nleadership, .73 for laissez-faire, and .88 for employees' trust.\nAll these values are within the acceptable range which is\nTable 1 demonstrates that OCC is significantly and posi-\ntively correlated with transformational leadership (r = .74,\nemployees' trust (r =.59, p < .05), whereas laissez-faire lead-\nership (r = -.29, p < .05) is significantly but negatively cor-\nrelated with OCC. This correlation measures the extent and\ndirection of the relationship between the variables of interest\nMoreover, Table 1 reveals that transformational leader-\nship is significantly and positively correlated to employees'\ntrust (r = .68, p < .05). The table shows that transactional\nleadership and employees' trust (r = .16, p < .05) are signifi-\ncantly and positively correlated. Whereas laissez-faire lead-\nership and employees'trust (r = -.32, p < .01) are found to be\nsignificantly but negatively correlated.\nCommon Method Bias\nScholars argue about the effects of common method bias in\nself-reporting variables (Conway & Lance, 2010). Therefore,\n6 SAGE Open\nTable 3. Model Fit Indices.\nNote. CMIN/DF = chi-square/degree of freedom ratio; GFI = goodness\nof fit index; AGFI = adjusted goodness of fit index; NFI = normed fit\nindex; CFI = comparative fit index; RMSEA = root mean square of\napproximation.\nprevious literature has identified several statistical remedies\nto detect and control for any possible common method bias\n(Chang, Van Witteloostuijn, & Eden, 2010). This study used\nHarman's one-factor test to check for common method bias.\nTable 2 shows the overall variance of 21.255%, which is less\nthan the 50% threshold for substantive common method\nvariance.\nModel Evaluation\nFor the analysis, structural equation modeling (SEM) has\nbeen used. Preacher and Hayes (2008) suggested path analy-\nsis technique to investigate mediation using bootstrapping\ntechnique to overcome criticism raised on Baron and Kenny\n(1986) four-step mediation model. Therefore, SEM has\nrecently become a widely used statistical tool applied in aca-\ndemic research (Hayes, 2009). For this study, two models\nhave been tested. Model 1 represents the direct effect between\nleadership styles and OCC, whereas Model 2 represents the\nindirect effects. Fit indices and path coefficient are shown in\nTable 3 describes the models fitness indices using Amos\n21 software. The suggested value for chi-square/degree of\nfreedom ratio (CMIN/DF) is minimum 2 and maximum 5,\nwhereas the value for goodness of fit index (GFI), adjusted\ngoodness of fit index (AGFI), normed fit index (NFI), and\ncomparative fit index (CFI) should be greater than 0.90 and\nroot mean square of approximation (RMSEA) should not be\ngreater than 0.08, indicating a good model fit (Hair et al.,\n2006). Table 2 shows the model fit values for the hypothe-\n0.070, this indicates a good fitness of the hypothesized\nModel 1. For Model 2, the values are CMIN/DF = 4.2, GFI =\n= 0.040, this indicates a good fitness of the hypothesized\nModel 2. Therefore, both the models fulfill the threshold val-\nues of GFI, AGFI, NFI, CFI, and RMSEA (see Table 3).\nPath coefficients were examined for Model 1, and all the\npaths are found to be significant and in line with the stated\nhypothesis. Transformational leadership is found to be posi-\ntively related with OCC having path coefficient value .67 and p\nvalue less than .05, which provides evidence to support\nHypothesis 1.

Path analysis indicates\nthat transformational leadership has a positive direct effect on\nemployees' trust with a path coefficient .63 having p value\nless than .05; so, Hypothesis 4 is supported. Transactional\nleadership has an insignificant relationship with employees'\ntrust; therefore, Hypothesis 5 is not supported, whereas,\nHypothesis 6 is supported with path coefficient -.21 and p\nvalue less than .05, and indicates a negative relationship\nbetween laissez-faire leadership and employees'trust. Finally,\nemployees' trust and OCC were found to have a positive\ndirect relationship, with path coefficient .59 and p value less\nthan .05; therefore, Hypothesis 7 is supported (see Figure 2).\nThis study investigated the mediating role of employees'\ntrust in the relationship between leadership styles and OCC.\nTherefore, indirect effects have been examined as suggested\nby Preacher and Hayes (2008) using bootstrapping technique\nwith 1,000 iterations to test the significance of indirect\neffects (see Table 4).\nThe indirect effect of transformational leadership\n(TFL) on OCC through employees' trust (ET) is having\npath coefficient value .37 and is significant with p value\nless than .05. Ratio of indirect effects to the total effect is\nlower confidence level was 0.11 (zero is not between the\nlower and upper confidence level). Thus, ET mediates the\nrelationship between TFL and OCC; hence, Hypothesis 8\nis supported.\nThe indirect effect of transactional leadership (TSL)\non OCC through ET is having path coefficient value .03\nand is insignificant, which indicates that employees'\ntrust does not mediate the relationship between transac-\ntional leadership and OCC; thus, Hypothesis 9 is not\nsupported.\nThe indirect effect of laissez-faire leadership (LFL) on\nOCC through ET is having path coefficient value -.12 and is\nsignificant with p value less than .05. Ratio of indirect effects\nto the total effect is 72.3%.

OCC = organizational change capacity.\n8 SAGE Open\nDiscussion\nFindings from this study, based on 204 employees from the\nnon-profit organizations of Pakistan, provided enough sup-\nport to all of our propositions with the exception of two.\nFirst, there was no significant relationship found between\ntransactional leadership and employees' trust. Second,\nemployees' trust was not found to mediate the relationship\nbetween transactional leadership and OCC.\nPast literature provides evidence that leadership plays an\nimportant role toward OCC, as transformational leadership is\nfound to have a positive impact on the change process\n(2011) identified that transformational leadership plays a sig-\nnificant contribution toward OCC of an organization.\nMoreover, Lutz Allen et al. (2013) suggested that individuals\nmust adopt the behaviors of transformational leadership style\nfor successful implementation of organizational change, par-\nticularly in non-profit organizations. Thus, transformational\nleadership facilitates OCC and increases the likelihood for\nsuccessful management and implementation of change.\nPrevious literature also shows the existence of a positive\nassociation between transactional leadership and change\nMoreover, Lowe et al. (1996) suggested that change is\nalso facilitated by the transactional leadership style as it\nrewards the positive outcomes. Therefore, transactional lead-\ners who acknowledge their subordinate's efforts by encour-\naging and rewarding them will play an important role in\nsupporting OCC. The current research also proposed a nega-\ntive relationship between laissez-faire leadership and OCC.\nFindings from the study also reported this relationship.\nPrevious literature shows that laissez-faire leadership is neg-\natively associated with change capability of an organization\n(Long & Mao, 2008). As the interaction between leaders and\nfollowers is essential for successful change phase (Kotter,\n1995), however, in laissez-faire leadership, there exists mini-\nmum interaction between leaders and followers (Northouse,\n2007). Therefore, laissez-faire leadership negatively affects\nthe change process, particularly in non-profit organizations\n(Lutz Allen et al., 2013). Hence, individuals with laissez-\nfaire leadership behavior will negatively affect OCC.\nThe results of this study reveal a positive relationship\nbetween transformational leadership and employees' trust in\nthe leader. Our findings are similar to the previous literature\nwhich identifies the positive relationship between transfor-\nmational leadership and employees' trust in leaders (Conger\nScholars assert that transformational leadership behavior\nbuilds confidence of their followers (Gillespie & Mann,\nand shares a vision of the organization with them, which con-\ntributes toward the trust-building process (Pawar & Eastman,\n1997).

However, the current\nresearch exhibits that there is no association between trans-\nactional leadership and employees'trust in non-profit organi-\nzations of Pakistan, as mixed evidences of the nature of\nassociation between transactional leadership and employees'\ntrust exist in previous literature. Pillai et al. (1999) and\nPodsakoff et al. (1990) provided empirical evidence that\ntransactional leadership does not influence a follower's trust.\nThe concept of transactional leadership is based on contin-\ngent rewards, which is rewarding the positive outcomes and\npunishing for poor performance (Northouse, 2007). However,\ntransactional leaders are unlikely to motivate, inspire, and\naddress individual needs of the followers; hence, transac-\ntional leadership behavior does not assist in developing an\nemployee's trust in the leader, specifically in the non-profit\norganizations of Pakistan. However, there is an existence of\na significant though negative relationship between laissez-\nfaire leadership and employees' trust. Findings of this\nresearch are congruent with the postulations of early\nresearchers (Northouse, 2007), as laissez-faire leadership has\nan unattractive behavior toward trust-building process due to\ntheir minimal input, support, and interaction with followers.\nThus, laissez-faire leadership behavior negatively affects an\nemployee's trust in their leadership.\nTable 4.

TFL = transformational leadership; ET = employees' trust; OCC = organizational change capacity; TSL = transactional leadership; LFL = laissez-faire\nleadership.\nYasir et al. 9\nScholars' argue that employees' trust in their leader\nplays a crucial role in achieving a higher level of OCC; in\naddition, trust can be strengthened (or destroyed) during\nthe course of discussions and acts (Soparnot, 2011). Thus,\nemployees' trust in their leader positively contributes\ntoward OCC, as results of the current study reveal a sig-\nnificant and positive relationship between employees' trust\nand OCC. Findings of the present research are in line with\ncessful change process depends upon the level of employ-\nand employees who trust their leaders will assist the change\ncapacity of an organization (Judge, 2011). Therefore,\ntransformational leaders build trust of the employees in\ntheir leadership for the reason that they engage employees\nin the change process, inspire them, and appreciate them\nfor their contribution, which positively affects OCC.\nPrevious literature also identifies that laissez-faire leader-\nship negatively affects trust of the employees in their lead-\nership (Northouse, 2007) and organizational change (Long\nof the current study show that if employees' trust their\nleaders, even if they have laissez-faire leadership behavior,\nemployees' trust will assist in decreasing the negative\neffects of laissez-faire leadership on OCC. Although, in\nmost cases, laissez-faire leadership fails to produce\nemployees'trust, therefore, its positive contribution toward\nOCC through employees' trust can be an exceptional case\nfrom the non-profit organizations of Pakistan. But, employ-\nees' trust was not found to play a mediating role in the\nrelationship between transactional leadership and OCC,\nbecause transactional leadership behavior fails to build\nemployees' trust in the current study findings. However,\ntransactional leadership has a positive relationship with\nThe current study has laid the foundation to test the newly\nemerging concept of change management with other vari-\nables. The study examined the relationship of leadership\nstyles (i.e., transformational leadership, transactional leader-\nship, and laissez-faire leadership) with OCC, which is a\nnovel contribution to the literature of leadership and change\nmanagement. The research has also created a link between\nthe two change management paradigms, that is, management\nand complex. The study has found a significantly positive\nrelationship between transformational leadership and OCC.\nTransformational leadership is a part of the driving dimen-\nsion of the management paradigm in the theories and con-\ncepts of change management (Klarner, Probst, & Soparnot,\n2007), whereas OCC is a part of the complex paradigm\n(Judge & Elenkov, 2005). Establishing a link between the\ntwo different components of management paradigm and\ncomplex paradigm, that is, transformational leadership and\nOCC, is a promising and unique contribution within the\nchange management literature.\nLimitations and Future Research\nConstructs of leadership styles, employees' trust, and OCC\nhave been examined unidimensionally. Impact of the facets\nof leadership behavior, that is, idealized influence, inspira-\ntional motivation, intellectual stimulation, individualized\nconsideration, contingent reward, management by excep-\ntion-active, and management by exception-passive, are rec-\nommended to be tested individually with OCC in a future\nstudy. Moreover, the current study sample is from the non-\nprofit organizations. Future studies should consider the role\nof leadership styles and employees' trust for OCC in private\n(for profit) or public sector organizations. Another limitation\nwas its cross-sectional research design. Also, the examina-\ntion of the process of leadership behavior and employees'\ntrust, and its impact on OCC requires a relatively longer\nperiod. For instance, the relevance of pre-existing levels of\ntrust and tendency to trust were not examined. Therefore, a\nfollow-up of this study may be performed with a longitudinal\nstudy design, which will present a true picture of perceived\ntrustworthiness of change leaders. In addition, a more\nenriched comparison should be completed with culturally\ndiverse organizations exploring cross-cultural replication of\nthis study, thereby adding depth to the existing knowledge.\nFinally, the present study respondents were from both long-\nand short-term projects of the non-profit organizations.\nFuture studies may examine the current model in long- and\nshort-term projects separately, or make a comparative study\nof it. The current research uses a convenient sampling design\nthat is simple to use but is vulnerable and lacks generaliz-\nability. Future researches may use a reliable sampling design.\nConclusion\nOrganizations aiming toward successful transformation,\nbased on their capacity to change, need to focus on their\nleadership behavior. For successful implementation and\nmanagement of the change process, organizations are\nrequired to develop their capacity for change, which\ndemands active, supportive, responsive, interactive, and\ntrustworthy leadership. Transformational leadership is\nfound to be much more successful in developing the change\ncapacity of an organization, because the leaders are inspir-\ning, active, and supportive. Similarly, transactional leader-\nship also seems to have an important role, while laissez-faire\nleadership negatively influences the change capacity of an\norganization. Therefore, top management, while going\nthrough the change phase, needs to avoid the laissez-faire\nleadership style, and focus more on the transformational\nleadership behavior with a complementing role of transac-\ntional leadership behavior to the extent of rewarding\nemployees' efforts for successfully managing the change\nphase. Finally, employees' trust plays a crucial role in\ndeveloping OCC as the present study shows that, if employ-\nees trust their leaders, even if they have the laissez-faire\nleadership behavior, the trust factor can minimize the direct\nnegative effect of laissez-faire leadership on OCC.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAvolio, B.
