The objective was to explore\ngender differences in ED visits related to nonmedical prescription opioid use in a nationally\nrepresentative sample.\nMethods: Data from the 2011 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Substance Abuse and\nMental Health Services Administration's Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) were analyzed to\ncompare visit characteristics between women and men. Logistic regression models were developed to\nexamine the association between gender and specific drug presentations and clinical outcomes.\nResults: There were an estimated 426,010 DAWN-defined visits involving prescription opioid use in 2011.\nThe prevalence of drugs in opioid-involved visits was similar between women and men. Ingestion of\nanother drug along with opioids was associated with increased odds of hospital admission for both\nwomen and men, and types of opioids ingested were similar between women and men. However, gender\ndifferences were noted in clinical outcomes, depending on the specific drug combination.\nConclusions: Gender differences exist in ED presentations related to prescription opioids. Further\nresearch is needed to understand these differences and any implications for gender-specific emergency\ncare and brief interventions.\nEmergency Medicine\nOver the past decade, there has been a marked\nincrease in prescription opioid misuse and\nabuse.

The existing litera-\nture demonstrates great heterogeneity in all aspects of\nopioid use: motives for opioid use, medical needs of the\nuser, the source of the drug, concurrent other drug use,\nand comorbidities.\nGender has emerged as a distinguishing factor in the\nepidemiology of prescription opioid abuse.3\u00ad7 For exam-\nple, although men still make up the majority of nonmed-\nical users of prescription opioids, the rate of rise in fatal\nprescription opioids overdoses in women has been\nhigher: deaths among women have increased by 400%\ntic--only partially understood--highlights the impor-\ntance of further investigations into the phenomenon of\nprescription opioid use and how and why outcomes\nmay be affected by gender.\nStudies have demonstrated gender differences influ-\nencing initiation and ongoing nonmedical use of pre-\nscription opioids, including high-risk times of\nconsumption, routes of administration, and particularly\nmotives for using prescription opioids.9 Men have been\ndescribed as using opioids more often for pleasurable\nFrom the Department of Emergency Medicine, Warren Alpert Medical School and the School of Public Health, Brown University\n(EKC, TG), Providence, RI; and the Department of Emergency Medicine, Boston University (CD), Boston, MA.\nThis work was presented at the American Public Health Association Annual Meeting, Boston, MA, November 2013.\nThe authors have no potential conflicts to disclose.\nSupervising Editor: Mark Mycyk, MD.\nAddress for correspondence and reprints: Esther Choo, MD MPH; e-mail: esther_choo@brown.edu.\naspects or to enhance amusement, similar to the posi-\ntive expectancies noted in male alcohol misuse. In con-\ntrast, women may engage in nonmedical use of opioids\nmore often to deal with negative emotions and address\nlikely than men to use additional medications such as\nsedatives to enhance the therapeutic effects of prescrip-\ntion opioids12; co-ingestion is a known risk factor for\nmortality from prescription opioids. In addition, women\nare more likely than men to be prescribed prescription\npain medications, are given higher doses, and use them\nfor longer time periods than men.8\nIf gender is indeed a significant factor in opioid use\nand misuse, it may affect how and why women and\nmen present to the ED, as well as the treatments and\nservices they need once they engage with ED care pro-\nviders. To date, gender patterns in ED presentation for\nnonmedical use of prescription opioids have not been\ndescribed. Using the Drug Abuse Warning Network\n(DAWN) of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health\nAdministration (SAMHSA), a nationally representative\nsample of drug-related ED visits, we sought to examine\ngender differences in prevalence of visits for nonmedi-\ncal use of prescription opioids; drugs used in combina-\ntion with opioids as a proxy for gender-based\ndifference in use patterns; and outcomes of opioid-\nrelated ED visits, including disposition and mortality.\nMETHODS\nStudy Design\nThis was a retrospective cohort study using SAMHSA's\nDAWN database. As this study used only existing, pub-\nlically available, deidentified data, it was exempt from\ninstitutional review board review.\nStudy Setting and Population\nDAWN collects data from a nationally representative\nsample of hospitals throughout the United States,\nincluding Alaska and Hawaii.13 Nonfederal, short-stay,\ngeneral surgical and medical hospitals with a 24-hour\nED are eligible for inclusion. This analysis used the 2011\ndata set, the last year DAWN was funded to collect ED\nvisit data.\nStudy Protocol\nwere identified; by applying poststratified weights to\nthe data received from the participating sampled hospi-\ntals, the submitted cases were extrapolated to an esti-\nestimated 126 million total ED visits. Of these drug-\nmisuse or abuse, with the balance involving adverse\nreactions and accidental ingestions. DAWN does not\ncapture any other data on individual visits, including\nadmission diagnoses, measures of illness severity, pro-\ncedures needed, length of stay, or service of admission,\nexcept for psychiatric admissions.\nFor this analysis, we selected out visits involving adults\n(18 years of age) and nonmedical use of pharmaceuti-\ncals and excluded those related to adverse reactions,\naccidental ingestions, or only involving illicit and/or\nalcohol use. The 3,300 individual drugs captured by\nDAWN in 2011 were reviewed by the study team to\nidentify those falling into categories of prescription opi-\noids, illicit drugs, antidepressants, or anxiolytics. Both\nsingle and combination prescription opioids were\nincluded in the first category. All drug names were\nreviewed by two authors (EKC and CD), and any unrec-\nognized drugs were confirmed against a toxicology\ndatabase. Alcohol was a predefined variable in the\nDAWN data set. We created individual variables to indi-\ncate if the prescription opioids involved in the visits\nwere taken alone or in combination with other sub-\nstances (primary outcomes). Other variables of interest\nextracted for this study included gender, age, race, and\nclinical disposition, including hospital admission or\ntransfer, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, referral to\noutpatient detoxification, admission for inpatient detoxi-\nfication or psychiatric care, and death.\nData Analysis\nWe calculated proportions and 95% confidence intervals\n(CIs) for demographic and drug use variables and com-\npared differences between women and men using uni-\nvariate (chi-square) analysis, defining as significant\nnonoverlapping 95% CIs. We identified the top three\nmost frequently used drugs for women and men in each\ndrug/drug combination category; however, in present-\ning this list, we did not include the nonspecific category\n\"Narcotic analgesics NOS,\" which was at or near the\ntop for all subgroups, and reported rankings of specifi-\ncally named opiates only.\nWe then developed logistic regression models to\nexamine the associations between gender and specific\ndrug presentations and clinical outcomes, adjusting for\nage and race. These were selected a priori, rather than\nthrough sequential or stepwise processes, based on evi-\ndence in the literature. Model variables were examined\nfor evidence of collinearity. Model fit was evaluated\nusing Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit testing for\nsample survey data. We also examined interactions\nbetween gender and race; however, these did not have\nsignificant effects in any model. Adjusted odds ratios\n(aORs) for which the 95% CI did not cross the null value\nof 1 were considered statistically significant. For all\nanalyses, we used \"svy\" commands in Stata to account\nfor weights and clustering and obtain accurate point\nestimates, standard errors, CIs, and tests of hypothesis.\nRESULTS\nED visits were for nonmedical use of prescription\nopioids. There were no significant differences between\nwomen and men with opioid use in the proportions of\npatients represented across age or race categories\n(Table 1). Visits by women and by men were equally\nlikely to involve illicit drug use, including subsets of\ncocaine and heroin use and anxiolytics; however,\nwomen were more likely to present with antidepressant\nuse, while men were more likely to present with alcohol\nco-ingestion (Table 1).\nThere were no significant overall differences between\nwomen and men in clinical outcomes examined, includ-\ning proportions referred to outpatient detoxification or\nadmitted for detoxification or psychiatric reasons, hos-\npital admission or transfer, ICU admission, or death\n(Table 1). More than 30% of both women and men\nrequired hospital admission, and of those, more than\n20% required ICU admission. Death was a rare outcome\nfor both genders.\nWhile \"narcotic analgesic NOS\" was one of the most\nfrequently coded prescription opioids, when the agent\nwas identifiable, the most commonly listed individual\nopioids were acetaminophen/hydrocodone (Vicodin),\nsingle-entity oxycodone, and acetaminophen/oxycodone\n(Percocet). The three most commonly reported specific\nopioids, by drug/drug combination category and gen-\nder, are shown in Table 2.\nIn the gender-stratified multivariable analyses\n(Table 3), women who presented with prescription opioid\nmisuse with either concurrent illicit drug use or antide-\npressant use were more likely to require general hospi-\ntal admission. Among men, presentations for opioids\nwith alcohol and with heroin increased the odds for\ngeneral hospital admission. Opioids in combination with\nantidepressants were associated with ICU admission in\nboth women and men, although for men, wide CIs for\nthis outcome reflect the small numbers of male patients\nwith this combination. Opioids in combination with\nanxiolytics were also associated with ICU admission. No\nstudied drug combination was associated with increa-\nsed odds of death.\nIn both women and men, using opioids alone, rather\nthan in combination with alcohol or other drugs or\nmedications, was associated with decreased odds of\ngeneral hospital admission. Of note, several models\nevaluating association with ICU admission and death\ndemonstrated poor fit, likely due to the small sample\nsizes for these outcomes (Table 3 and Data Supplements\nS1 and S2, available as supporting information in the\nonline version of this paper).\nDISCUSSION\nPrevious literature has demonstrated a tremendous het-\nerogeneity among opioid users in terms of patterns of\nuse and the interactions between types of use and sub-\ngroups of gender, race/ethnicity, familial substance\nabuse, routes of administration, concurrent drug use,\nWith the premise that understanding the needs of spe-\ncific subgroups of users may help develop more effec-\ntive screening and treatment approaches, we examined\na gender-stratified, nationally representative population\nof opioid users seeking ED care.\nOpioid use in the study population was high, and men\nand women were equally represented among opioids\nusers. Although men and women used similar types of\nprescription opioids in combination with alcohol, illicit\ndrugs, and antidepressants, there were differences\nbetween them in clinical outcomes within drug combina-\ntion categories. This may be due to patterns or amounts\nof drugs taken, polysubstance use, or different thresh-\nolds for seeking health care. The difference may also be\nbiological: observed sex differences include greater\nsusceptibility to adverse effects of drugs, which may also\ncontribute to gender differences in hospital admission\nand ICU care involving these drug combinations.\nFor both men and women, opioids taken alone posed\nsimilarly lower risks for need for hospitalization com-\npared to when taken in combination with other sub-\nstances, an intuitive finding that confirms the higher\nrisk of co-ingestion observed in previous studies.18,19\nFurther, the lower risk of single agent was similar\nbetween genders, even though the specific agent\ninvolved differed between men and women who pre-\nsented with opioids alone.\nAmong the drug combinations studied, ICU admis-\nsion was associated with opioids and antidepressants\nfor both women and men and with opioids and anxio-\nlytics only for men. Although this study did not examine\nthe characteristics of the nonopioid drugs involved in\nthe ED visits, it may be that the long-acting formula-\ntions available for these drug categories played a role in\nthe need for ICU-level care. There may be additional\nfactors underlying the gender differences observed for\nopioids and anxiolytics, such as the quantities or formu-\nlations of anxiolytics taken by men who presented to\nthe ED with this drug combination.\nWomen in the DAWN data set were more likely to\nhave opioid ingestions in combination with antidepres-\nsants and men more likely to use opioids with alcohol,\nconsistent with previous literature that described\nCharacteristics of ED Visits With Prescription Opioid Use\nCharacteristic\nProportion\nProportion\nAge category, yr\nRace\nBlack or African-\nAmerican\nGeneral hospital\nadmission or\ntransfer\nICU = intensive care unit.\n*Statistically significant difference between women and men.\nICU visits are presented as proportions of inpatient visits.\ngender-specific reasons for opioid use.20 We also found\nthat these particular combinations were clinically severe\n(i.e., were associated with elevated odds of hospitaliza-\ntion) for each gender. Further study is needed to under-\nstand the explanation for this; it may be that social\nexpectations or biases on the part of medical/behavioral\nhealth care providers make women more likely to have\nopioids and antidepressants prescribed together, pre-\nscribed in a way or used or metabolized by women in a\nway that creates higher risk for presentation to the ED\nand hospitalization. Similarly, alcohol and opioids may\nbe a particularly dangerous combination in men,\nwhether because of gender-determined differences in\nthe way opioids and alcohol are taken together or less\ncaution in screening for alcohol problems or prescrib-\ning opioids to men with histories of high-risk alcohol\nuse.\nWith ED visits for prescription opioid misuse still on\nthe rise, our study adds to the literature supporting an\nimportant role for the ED in examining and preventing\nmedication safety errors, improving safer prescribing of\nopioids, and educating patients about combinations and\ndrug\u00addrug interactions.21,22 Our study underscores the\nimportance of considering the patient's history of sub-\nstance abuse and mental health conditions and current\nmedication lists--such as referencing a prescription\nTop Three Drugs Involved in Prescription Opioid-implicated ED Visits, in Order of Frequency, by Gender*\n1.

While these data cannot elucidate\nthe root cause of these differences, they provide impe-\ntus for a deeper, gender-specific understanding of the\ncomplex factors that may lead to serious morbidity from\nprescription opioids.\nLIMITATIONS\nThe DAWN data were collected through retrospective\nchart review, and thus the determination of eligibility\nfor an individual case was dependent on the quality and\naccuracy of clinical information captured in the patient\nchart. It is possible that biases on the part of clinicians\ncould lead to overrepresentation of drug misuse for one\ngender or the other. Clinical information captured in\nDAWN is limited. Although we could observe drugs\nand drug combinations implicated in visits, we are not\nable to correlate these with clinical diagnoses, pain-\nrelated complaints, co-occurring medical or psychiatric\nissues, or other specific information that would enable\nus to more thoroughly evaluate potential confounders of\nthe relationship between opioid use and gender. The\ndata were confined to individuals 18 years and older;\nthus, findings may not generalize to younger popula-\ntions presenting to the ED. Finally, in this exploratory\nanalysis, we did not achieve good fit for some of the\nmodels examining drug combinations and the rarer out-\ncomes of ICU admission and death. These associations\nmerit further exploration in a larger dataset powered to\nexamine these serious outcomes more closely.\nCONCLUSIONS\nEmergency department visits related to prescription opi-\noid misuse are numerous and often involve combinations\nwith other substances. We found gender differences in\nthese visits, especially in patterns of co-ingestions of\nother substances and associations between specific drug\ncombinations and hospital admission. A better under-\nstanding of the gender factors involved in the initiation,\nmisuse, treatment needs, and clinical outcomes may\ninform the development of gender-specific interventions\nand preventive measures.\nReferences\n1.
