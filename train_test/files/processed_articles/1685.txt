The normal weight category took 7,190 \u00b1 SE 157 steps/day, and\nspent 25.7 \u00b1 0.9 minutes/day in moderate intensity and 7.3 \u00b1 0.4 minutes/day in vigorous intensity physical\n3.2 \u00b1 0.4 minutes/day. Across BMI categories, increasing gradients and significant trends were apparent in males for\nsedentary time and decreasing gradients and significant trends were evident in time spent in light intensity,\nmoderate intensity, and vigorous intensity. For females, there were only consistent gradients and significant trends\napparent for decreasing amounts of time spent in moderate and vigorous intensity.\nConclusions: Simple indicators of physical activity volume (i.e., steps/day) and time in light, moderate or vigorous\nintensity physical activity differ across BMI categories for both sexes, suggesting that these should continue to be\ntargets for surveillance.\nBackground\ntion Survey (NHANES) data indicate that more than\none-third of U.S. adults are obese (BMI  30 kg/m2),\npotential contributor to this state of affairs is reduced\nphysical activity.

Perhaps the best\nexample is a study of Old Order Amish who reject\nmotorized technologies and practice a traditional life-\nstyle of `living off the land'[11]. Men from this group\ntake approximately 18,000 steps/day and women take\n14,000 pedometer-determined steps/day. This is in stark\ncontrast to data collected in two U.S. pedometer-based\nbetween these Amish (reflective of an earlier pre-\ntechnology time) and more contemporary values ranges\nerosion of daily steps began earlier in the past century,\nbut it is only as these transitions have proliferated and\ncompounded, reaching a \"tipping point\" in the 1980s in\nthe USA, that we have been able to trace obvious indi-\ncators of the increasing obesity epidemic. Developing\nnations are now experiencing a similar process [14].\nConsidering these diverse behavioral suspects, it is\nnecessary to capture a full range of physical activity/\ninactivity estimates concurrently in normal weight, over-\nweight, and obese individuals if we are to better estab-\nlish a comprehensive physical activity profile [15]\nassociated with obesity. The concept of physical activity\nprofiling (e.g., examining a complete panel of physical\nactivity/inactivity indicators simultaneously) attempts to\nmove beyond single point estimates of time spent only\nin moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), for\nexample [15,16]. Physical activity profiling is an essential\nfirst step to teasing out which aspects of a full physical\nactivity spectrum may most likely be contributing to the\ngrowing obesity problem and can also point the way to\na minimal data set necessary for surveillance purposes.\nObjective monitoring by accelerometry produces a\nwealth of information that can be distilled and examined\nto better understand the complex nature of a full range\nof human physical activity/inactivity behaviors. For\nexample, NHANES now uses accelerometers to objec-\ntively capture free-living physical activity behaviors as\npart of its surveillance system. The accelerometer used\n(Actigraph AM-7164) produces raw outputs of minute-\nby-minute steps (depicting a movement event; released\nity counts (denoting acceleration of movement in\nNHANES). These raw activity counts can be trans-\nformed to produce a number of indicators of physical\nactivity/inactivity. For example, since the ActiGraph\ndata are time-stamped, it is possible to derive duration\nspent in different intensities of activity (including seden-\ntary time) using activity counts/minute cut points (e.g.,\nthose established for the NHANES data) [17]. The\nto identify prevalence of achieving minimal public health\nguidelines (based on intensity bouts and their duration)\n[17]. The same data were used to analyze time in seden-\ntary behaviors, defined as time spent < 100 activity\n2006 data to provide population and sex-specific epide-\nmiology of accelerometer-determined steps/day with\nand without censoring steps detected at very low inten-\nsity [19]. Accelerometer data can also be manipulated to\nexpress physical activity as a summed volume of activity\ncounts engaged in over the course of the day or as a\nrate (either activity counts/minute or steps/minute) con-\nsidering time worn [20]. Recently, Healy et al. [21] have\ndemonstrated that breaks in sedentary time transitions\n(e.g., moving from sitting to standing) can be counted\nusing ActiGraph data and may be associated with meta-\nbolic risk.\nThe opportunity at hand is to describe a comprehen-\nsive accelerometer-derived physical activity/inactivity\nprofile in body mass index (BMI) defined normal weight,\noverweight, and obese men and women using the 2005-\n2006 NHANES data. Although BMI has recognized lim-\nitations as an indicator of body fatness/obesity (e.g., it\noverestimates body fat in muscular individuals and can\nunderestimate body fat in those who have lost muscle\nmass), it is a favoured measure of excess weight in epide-\nmiological studies focused on relative risk of disease [22].\nMethods\nNHANES began in the early 1960s as a periodic health\nsurvey and became continuously implemented since\nand physical examinations each year and the data are\nreleased in two-year intervals.

Troiano, personal communication)\nand whether or not instruments remained calibrated\nupon their return. Reliable data are clearly indicated for\nready use. The National Center for Health Statistics\n(NCHS) Ethics Review Board approved the original sur-\nvey protocols, and informed consent was obtained for\nall NHANES participants. The Pennington Biomedical\nResearch Center's Institutional Review Board approved\nof this analysis.\nData Treatment\nAccelerometer time worn (hours and minutes) was com-\nputed using a specifically designed SAS macro provided\nby the National Cancer Institute (NCI) at http://riskfac-\ntor.cancer.gov/tools/nhanes_pam/. This macro infers\nnon-wear from at least 60 contiguous minutes of zero\nactivity count data points. This decision rule results in a\nmore comprehensive data set when compared to 20\nminutes, for example [23].\nThis analysis was focused on adult participants  20\nyears of age. Of the 4,372 eligible men and women in\nthe sample, we excluded 171 with NHANES-designated\nunreliable data and 185 with accelerometers determined\nnot to be in calibration upon return. Since this analysis\nfocused on BMI-defined weight categories, we excluded\n269 women who self-reported pregnancy and a single\nindividual with a BMI > 100 kg/m2. We also excluded\n224 individuals who did not have at least one valid day\ning with previous analyses [18,19]. A more thorough dis-\ncussion of the appropriateness of using a single day of\nwear is available elsewhere [19]. Ultimately, this analysis\neligible sample. We did not present a summary of our\nresults on accelerometer data for men and women with\na  18.5 kg/m2 (technically considered underweight)\nbecause such data were available only for 69 adults, a\nsample size we feel is too small for informative\ninterpretation.\nTable 1 summarizes the panel of indicator variables\ncomprising a comprehensive accelerometer-derived phy-\nsical activity/inactivity profile of U.S. men and women.\nAll indicator variables have been previously defined and\nused in the literature; we did not create anything new\nfor this specific analysis. Physical activity volume indica-\ntors included daily totals of activity count and step data\naveraged over the number of days worn to produce\nactivity counts/day and steps/day, respectively. Following\npreviously published methods [19], steps/day were\nfurther transformed after censoring out those steps\ntaken at an intensity < 500 activity counts/minute\n(equivalent to low intensity and sedentary behaviors,\ndefined further below). Since the ActiGraph is known to\nbe more sensitive to low force movements than accepted\nresearch quality pedometers, leading to relatively higher\nwas necessary to bring the accelerometer-determined\nsteps/day more in line with current pedometer-based\nscales [26] and comparable surveillance studies\nintensity derived from the activity count data is unaf-\nfected. In this analysis we present both uncensored (i.e.,\nraw) and censored steps/day.\nPhysical activity rate indicators included activity\ncounts/minute, uncensored steps/minute, and censored\nsteps/minute, each computed considering time worn.\nEach of the daily 1,440 minutes recorded for each indi-\nvidual were categorized by intensity according to specific\nactivity counts/minute values that have been previously\nused to analyze NHANES data [17] to produce a series\nof time indicators. In particular, 2,020 activity counts/\nminute is considered the threshold value indicative of\nmoderate intensity activity and 5,999 activity counts/\nminute stands for minimally vigorous intensity activities.\nTime spent at < 100 activity counts/minute (after\nremoving non-wear time was identified as engaging in\nsedentary behaviors [18]. Non-wear time (which logically\nincludes sleep time) represents the difference between\n1,440 minutes and wear time (that is, wear time is cal-\nculated by subtracting macro-determined non-wear time\nminute) intensity activities consistent with previous ana-\nlyses that have looked at finer gradations of intensity\ncategories simultaneously [20]. In that previous study,\nTudor-Locke et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity 2010, 7:60\nactivity counts/minute < 500 were originally labeled\n\"inactive\" intensity; for clarity and consistency we have\nchosen to re-label it here \"low\" intensity. Daily minutes\nin each intensity category were summed. Total daily\nminutes within intensity categories were summed and\nsubsequently divided by the number of days worn to\ncompute daily average time spent in non-wear, seden-\ntary behaviors, and low, light, moderate, and vigorous\nintensity activities.\nWe accessed another NCI-supplied SAS macro (located\nat http://riskfactor.cancer.gov/tools/nhanes_pam/) to\ndetermine achievement of public health guidelines to\naccumulate 30 minutes of at least moderate intensity in\nmodified 10-minute bouts on at least 5 of 7 days using a\nBayesian approach to interpret information from all indi-\nviduals with one or more valid days [17]. A modified\n10-minute bout was defined as 10 or more consecutive\nminutes above the moderate intensity activity count\nthreshold, with allowance for interruptions of 1 or 2\nminutes below threshold. In keeping with previous ana-\nlyses, a bout was terminated by 3 minutes below thresh-\nThe number of transitions or breaks in sedentary time\nwere counted as occasions when activity counts rose\nity counts in the subsequent minute [21].

Data were examined for\nevidence of consistent gradients across BMI categories\n(consistent increasing or decreasing pattern vs. a ran-\ndomly fluctuating pattern) and statistical tests were con-\nducted to evaluate significant trends, also across BMI\ncategories.\nResults\nTable 2 summarizes the accelerometer-derived volume,\nrate, and break in sedentary time indicators for 2005-\n2006 NHANES U.S. adults. All volume and rate indica-\ntors show a clear and significant decreasing gradient\nacross BMI categories, and they were also consistently\nhigher for males compared to those for females. The dif-\nference in breaks in sedentary time across BMI cate-\ngories appears to be minimal (a difference of only 1-2\nbreaks per day) but does show a similar gradient, how-\never this was only statistically significant in the males.\nAcross BMI categories, however, females consistently\ntook relatively more breaks in sedentary time compared\nto males.\nFigure 1 displays the percent achieving public health\nguidelines by BMI category and sex. Overall, achieve-\nment of public health guidelines is relatively uncommon\n(i.e., < 5%). Still, a decreasing gradient is apparent across\nBMI categories and also between sexes (males >\nfemales).\nFigure 2 is a bubble graph that displays daily time\nspent in each of the time indicators across sex-specific\nBMI-defined normal weight/overweight/obesity cate-\ngories. The size and height of the bubble represents the\nnumber of minutes/day. Across BMI categories and\nbetween sexes the greatest minutes/day were spent, in\ndescending rank order, in non-wear time, sedentary\ntime, low intensity, light intensity, moderate intensity,\nand vigorous intensity. Although there was no apparent\ngradient in non-wear time across BMI categories in\nmales, the trend was significant and most obvious for\nobese males. Time spent in low intensity activities\nshowed no gradient across BMI categories in males, and\nthere was no significant trend. Increasing gradients and\nsignificant trends were apparent in males for sedentary\ntime and decreasing gradients and significant trends\nwere evident in time spent in light intensity, moderate\nintensity, and vigorous intensity. For females, there were\nonly consistent gradients and significant trends apparent\nfor decreasing amounts of time spent in moderate and\nvigorous intensity. No other time indicators were signifi-\ncant in females across BMI categories. Within BMI cate-\ngories, males (compared with females) consistently spent\nless time in non-wear time and in low intensity time\nand more time in light intensity and moderate intensity\nacross BMI categories. No other differences were\nconsistent.\nFigures 3 (males) and 4 (females) present percents\nclassified by step-defined activity levels. Considering\nboth sexes together, there were relatively more over-\nweight and obese individuals classified as taking basal\nactivity and limited activity. This pattern was reversed in\nthose classified as low active, active, and high active. An\nexception to these patterns was evident in those classi-\nfied as somewhat active; relatively more overweight indi-\nviduals were classified as such compared to either\nnormal weight or obese individuals. By sex, there were\nrelatively more males classified in the somewhat active,\nactive, and highly active categories whereas relatively\nmore females were classified in the basal activity, limited\nactivity, and low active categories.\nDiscussion\nThis analysis presents the most comprehensive set of\naccelerometer-derived indicators of physical activity/\ninactivity using the largest nationally representative data\nset yet available. As a nation (excepting pregnant\nsteps/day, and after considering non-wear time, they\nspend approximately 56.8% of the rest of the waking day\nintensity, 2.6% in moderate intensity, and 0.2% in vigor-\nous intensity. Overall, approximately 3.2% of U.S. adults\nachieve public health guidelines.\nExamined across BMI categories for both sexes, a con-\nsistent decreasing and statistically significant gradient is\napparent for all physical activity volume indicators, as is\nexpected. With regards to time indicators (i.e., measured\ntime spent in various intensity categories), there was a\nclear moderating effect of sex. Significant gradients were\nobserved for non-wear time, sedentary time, light time,\nmoderate time, and vigorous time (but not low intensity\ntime) in males. For females, only gradients in moderate\nand vigorous intensity time were significant. Further,\ndespite the fact that achievement of public health guide-\nlines, is, overall, a rare phenomenon (at least as mea-\nsured by the ActiGraph accelerometer), a decreasing\ngradient was still evident across BMI categories. Strath\net al. [16] have also reported a relationship between\ntime in MVPA and markers of obesity in U.S. adults\nsectional analysis, we are not able to conclude whether\nTudor-Locke et al.

Other evidence suggests that\nboth mechanisms are at work on an individual level\n[29,30]. Body weight status is a complex function of\nother contributors, including dietary intake, although\nthis is not a focus of this analysis.\nThe observed gradient in breaks in sedentary time was\nminimal (a difference of 1-2 breaks/day across BMI\ncategories) and only statistically significant in males.\nTherefore, although these are only cross-sectional data,\nthese minimal differences would suggest that this speci-\nfic aspect of sedentary behavior may not be an impor-\ntant contributor to the obesity epidemic [31] (but this\ndoes not negate a possible contribution to other impor-\ntant health-related outcomes). Previous reports linking\nsedentary behavior to obesity have used questionnaire\nmethods to recall sitting time [32,33], but also the same\nbrand and model of accelerometer as used by NHANES\n[21,34]. We also used the same definitions of sedentary\ntime [34] and breaks in sedentary time [21] as these pre-\nvious accelerometer-based reports so the very minimal\ndifferences we observed cannot be explained by differ-\nences in either instrumentation or cut point choices.\nWe observed a similar decreasing gradient across BMI\ncategories in rate indicators, however, these are ratios\nand as such need to be interpreted cautiously since they\nare affected simultaneously by both the numerator and\nthe denominator (in this case, time monitored by accel-\nerometer). Although we observed no consistent differ-\nences in non-wear time across BMI categories, variation\nin either the physical activity volume indicator or time\nthat the accelerometer was worn, or both, can distort\nconclusions. That being said, a post-hoc analysis of cov-\nariance was performed to adjust mean time spent in\neach intensity for wear time. The results of this analysis\nwere very similar to the unadjusted results. For example,\nwhen examining time spent in the sedentary intensity\nfor males, the trend across BMI categories stayed signifi-\ncant with a p-value of 0.0001 compared to the unad-\njusted p-value of 0.007. Furthermore, the analysis for\ntime spent in the low intensity produced a p-value of\nwhen not adjusted. All categories were examined and\nwere found to produce the same conclusions as the\nunadjusted model.\nActivity counts corresponding to a MET-defined mod-\nerate intensity physical activity appear to be much lower\nin older and overweight/obese populations. Specifically,\nLopes et al. [35] conducted an ActiGraph calibration\nstudy and determined that 1,240 activity counts/minute\nrepresented the threshold for moderate intensity activity\nin such a population, a value that is less than what has\nbeen conventionally used to describe the same intensity\nbehavior in this and other NHANES analyses (i.e., 2020\nactivity counts/minute) [17]. Physical activity is a beha-\nvior and it is quantified herein objectively as steps taken\nor time above a specific activity count threshold; this\nthreshold captures movement as acceleration. Although\nconclusions about the metabolic cost of this behavior\nappear to be affected by factors known to influence\nenergy expenditure (e.g., body mass), we remain none-\ntheless confident that differences (or lack of differences)\nbetween BMI-defined weight categories in objectively-\nmonitored steps taken or their acceleration are real. To\nemphasize, energy expenditure is higher in obese indivi-\nduals due to their higher body mass [36]. In terms of\nphysical activity, however, we found that obese\nFigure 1 Percent achieving public health guidelines by BMI\nTable 2: Indicators of volume, rate, and breaks in sedentary time: 2005-2006 NHANES U.S. Adults (Continued)\n*averaged over number of days worn\n**10 or more consecutive minutes above the moderate intensity activity count threshold, with allowance for interruptions of 1 or 2 minutes below threshold.

International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity 2010, 7:60\nindividuals (regardless of sex) take fewer steps/day and\nspend less time in moderate and vigorous intensity\nactivity.\nIt was not surprising that overweight and obese indivi-\nduals tended to take fewer steps/day and that normal\nweight people tended to take more steps/day. As is evi-\ndent from Figures 3 and 4, within each step-defined\nactivity group, the percent of normal weight, overweight,\nand obese must add up to 100%; along the physical\nactivity continuum the normal/overweigh/obese gradient\n\"switches\" from an upwardly sloping gradient to a\ndownwardly sloping gradient. However, we did not\nexpect to find that more overweight individuals were\nsteps/day) compared to both normal weight and obese\nindividuals. It is plausible that overweight individuals\nwere more likely to modify their physical activity to\naffect their weight, and then this collective behavior was\npicked up as a distortion to the expected gradient. A\nprevious analysis of 1-year tracking of pedometer-\ndetermined physical activity showed that the percent of\nobese individuals who increased their physical activity\nover the previous year was higher than those who\ndecreased their behavior; further, as a group the obese\nwere less stable (that is, more change occurred) in their\nbehavior compared to a normal weight group [37]. The\nrelative instability of physical activity behavior by BMI\ncategory requires more research for confirmation.\nIn keeping with surveillance of reported leisure time\nphysical activity [3] and inactivity [38] that show sex-\nspecific differences, NHANES males were consistently\nmore physically active (i.e., physical activity volume\nand rate indicators were higher and they spent more\ntime in light and moderate intensity activity) and less\nphysically inactive (i.e., they spent less time in non-\nwear time and low intensity time) than females across\nBMI categories. A consistent pattern in sedentary time\nwas not evident between sexes across BMI categories.\nHowever, across these same categories, females took\nrelatively more breaks in sedentary time compared to\nmales. There were also relatively more males classified\nin the somewhat active, active, and highly active\nFigure 2 Sex-specific percent of the 1,440 minute day represented by all time indicators across BMI categories. * p < 0.05,  < 0.01, \nTudor-Locke et al.

No other patterns (i.e., consistent\nresults between sexes across BMI categories) were\napparent.\nAcknowledging the limitations of cross-sectional ana-\nlysis, by scrutinizing a full panel of concurrent estimates\nof physical activity/inactivity across BMI-defined weight\ncategories, we can begin to identify specific activity\nparameters that maximally differentiate between nor-\nmal/overweight/obese samples and therefore best inform\non-going surveillance efforts and physical activity inter-\nventions. An important caveat to keep in mind, how-\never, is that this was a population analysis and the\nresults do not necessarily apply to all individuals. Caus-\nality can only be substantiated, however, in longitudinal\nand intervention study designs.\nConclusions\nSimple indicators of physical activity volume (i.e., steps/\nday) and time in moderate or vigorous intensity physical\nactivity differ across BMI categories (regardless of sex),\nsuggesting that these should continue to be targets for\nsurveillance. In addition, longitudinal and intervention\ndesigns are needed to confirm a causal role in the obe-\nsity epidemic. Despite the current interest in breaks in\nsedentary time, we found little evidence to support a\nnoteworthy difference in this accelerometer-determined\nbehavior across BMI categories. This does not necessa-\nrily negate its impact on other outcomes not examined\nwithin the scope of this analysis.\nAuthors' contributions\nCT-L, WDJ, and PTK worked together to conceive and design the analysis.
