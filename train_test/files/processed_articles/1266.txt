Women infected\nfor the first time during pregnancy are especially likely to transmit CMV to their fetuses. More children\nsuffer serious disabilities caused by congenital CMV than by several better-known childhood maladies such\nas Down syndrome or fetal alcohol syndrome\nMethods: Using CMV seroprevalence data from the nationally representative Third National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey, we estimated CMV incidence among the general United States population\nand among pregnant women. We employed catalytic models that used age-specific CMV seroprevalences\nas cumulative markers of past infections in order to derive estimates of three basic parameters: the force\nof infection, the basic reproductive rate, and the average age of infection. Our main focus was the force\nof infection, an instantaneous per capita rate of acquisition of infection that approximates the incidence of\ninfection in the seronegative population.\nResults: Among the United States population ages 12\u00ad49 the force of infection was 1.6 infections per 100\nsusceptible persons per year (95% confidence interval: 1.2, 2.4). The associated basic reproductive rate of\n1.7 indicates that, on average, an infected person transmits CMV to nearly two susceptible people. The\naverage age of CMV infection was 28.6 years. Force of infection was significantly higher among non-\nHispanic Blacks (5.7) and Mexican Americans (5.1) than among non-Hispanic Whites (1.4). Force of\ninfection was significantly higher in the low household income group (3.5) than in the middle (2.1) and\nupper (1.5) household income groups. Based on these CMV incidence estimates, approximately 27,000\nnew CMV infections occur among seronegative pregnant women in the United States each year.\nConclusion: These thousands of CMV infections in pregnant women, along with the sharp racial/ethnic\ndisparities in CMV incidence, are compelling reasons for accelerating research on vaccines and other\ninterventions for preventing congenital CMV disease. Nevertheless, the relatively low force of infection\nprovides encouraging evidence that modestly effective vaccines and rates of vaccination could significantly\nreduce CMV transmission.\n\u00a9 2007 Colugnati et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0),\nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBackground\nCytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common opportunistic\ninfection among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-\ninfected individuals, a major source of serious viral com-\nplications among organ-transplant recipients, and a lead-\ning cause of hearing loss, vision loss, and mental\nretardation among congenitally infected children. In fact,\nmore children suffer serious disabilities caused by congen-\nital CMV than by several better-known childhood mala-\ndies such as Down syndrome or fetal alcohol syndrome\nLike other herpesviruses, primary CMV infection is fol-\nlowed by the establishment of lifelong latent infection\nfrom which periodic reactivation is common [2,3]. Symp-\ntoms are usually absent during primary infection and\nreactivation, but CMV can be shed in various bodily secre-\ntions, particularly urine and saliva [4]. CMV is transmitted\nperson-to-person via close non-sexual contact, sexual\nactivity, breastfeeding, blood transfusions, and organ\ntransplantation [4]. For pregnant women, important\nsources of infection include sexual activity and contact\nwith the urine or saliva of young children, especially their\nCongenital CMV infection is most likely to occur follow-\ning a primary infection in the mother during pregnancy\n[8]. However, maternal CMV reactivation or reinfection\nwith a different CMV strain can also lead to fetal infection\n[8]. Approximately 10 percent of congenitally infected\ninfants are symptomatic at birth, and of the 90 percent\nwho are asymptomatic, 10\u00ad15 percent will develop symp-\ntoms over months or even years [9].\nIncidence of primary CMV infections has been estimated\nonly in small or specialized populations, such as pregnant\nwomen or day care providers. The most comprehensive\nstudy of CMV incidence was carried out by Griffiths and\ncolleagues in the United Kingdom [10], in which they esti-\nmated that more than three seronegative women per 100\nseroconvert each year. However, their study was limited to\npregnant women and was hospital-based rather than pop-\nulation-based. Robust, nationally representative estimates\nof CMV incidence are essential for 1) assessing the burden\nof primary CMV infection in the United States popula-\ntion, especially among pregnant women; 2) examining\nwhether there are racial/ethnic disparities in primary\nmaternal infection rates, which might be responsible for\nracial/ethnic disparities in congenital infection rates; and\n3) evaluating how effective a vaccine or other intervention\nmust be in order to reduce the incidence of congenital\nCMV disease. To obtain estimates of CMV incidence in the\nUnited States, we employed mathematical models that\nused age-specific CMV seroprevalences from the Third\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\nMethods\nStudy population and design\nvides nationally representative estimates of the health and\nnutritional status of the civilian, noninstitutionalized\npopulation of the United States. In order to produce pop-\nulation-representative estimates, NHANES III used a\nmultistage, stratified, clustered sample design and gener-\nated sample weights proportional to the probability of\nparticipant selection. All our analyses used the NHANES\nIII sample weights and sample design variables to correct\nthe CMV seroprevalence point estimates for population\nrepresentativeness and the interval estimates for the\nmultistage complex sample design. The study protocol\nwas approved by the authors' institutional review board.\nMore details about NHANES III can be found in the offi-\ncial documentation [11]. Serologic testing for CMV\nimmunoglobulin G (IgG) was conducted as described\nThe main focus of our models of CMV incidence was the\nthis age range had sera available for CMV testing (N =\n11,859) so that seroprevalence estimates were representa-\ntive of the United States population. More importantly,\nthis age range included women of childbearing age and so\nhas key relevance for congenital CMV disease. Although\nsurplus sera was only available for approximately 70 per-\nthis age group to assess whether incidence rates differed\nby race/ethnicity. Nationally-representative CMV sero-\nprevalence estimates were not available for children less\nthan six years old.\nDescription of models\nHere we give an overview of the models of CMV inci-\ndence. A more detailed description is provided in the\nAppendix. We employed catalytic models [13,14] that\nused age-specific CMV seroprevalences as cumulative\nmarkers of past infections in order to derive estimates of\nthree basic parameters: the force of infection, the basic\nreproductive rate, and the average age of infection. The\nforce of infection is the instantaneous per capita rate of\nacquisition of infection [13] and will be expressed in this\narticle as the number of primary CMV infections per 100\nseronegative persons per year. The basic reproductive rate\nis a function of the force of infection and is the average\nnumber of secondary infections produced when one\ninfected individual is introduced into a host population\nwhere everyone is susceptible. The average age of infection\nis also a function of the force of infection and is the age at\nwhich an individual in a given population typically\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nacquires a specific infection. We considered parameter dif-\nferences to be statistically significant when corresponding\nconfidence intervals did not overlap.\nForce of infection can be estimated as time-dependent,\nage-dependent, or both. Since our data were taken from a\nsingle, cross-sectional survey, we could not model time\ndependence. To evaluate age-dependence, we visually\ninspected the slope of the age-specific seroprevalence\ngraph (see Appendix). We observed no extreme depar-\ntures from linearity for the overall population, with the\nslope appearing fairly constant as a function of age. How-\never, because we saw age-dependent changes in slope\nwithin some subpopulations (e.g., Figure 1), we used\npiece-wise log-linear models that allowed the slope to\nyears. With the exception of this modification for the sub-\ngroup analysis, our final models were the time- and age-\nindependent ones proposed by Griffiths et al. [10] for\nmodeling CMV incidence, where the force of infection is\nestimated as the slope of the log-linear regression line hav-\ning the seronegative prevalence as the response variable\nand age as the explanatory variable. For all models age was\ntreated as a continuous variable.\nThe models made the following assumptions: CMV infec-\ntion does not affect the mortality rate; seroprevalence in\nnewborns equals zero; the death rate is type I, meaning\neveryone survives until a specific age, after which the sur-\nvival probability is zero; and every person in the popula-\ntion is equally susceptible (i.e., homogeneous mixing).\nVariables\nWe estimated the model parameters for the entire United\nStates population and for specific population groups strat-\nified by sex, race/ethnicity, and/or household income.\nRace/ethnicity was a self-reported variable that consisted\nof non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks, Mexican\nAge-distribution of cytomegalovirus (CMV)-seropositive proportion among U.S. women\nAge-distribution of cytomegalovirus (CMV)-seropositive proportion among U.S. women.

We\nmultiplied this risk by the proportion of women who are\nCMV seronegative to obtain risk of CMV infection during\npregnancy for the entire population (i.e., seronegative and\nseropositive) of women. We then multiplied the risk of\ninfection in the entire population of women by the aver-\nage number of live-birth pregnancies per year for the years\nannual number of women with a primary CMV infection\nduring pregnancy.\nResults\nThe overall force of CMV infection in 12\u00ad49 year-olds in\nthe United States was 1.6 per 100 persons per year (Table\n1). The associated basic reproductive rate of 1.7 indicates\nthat, on average, an infected person transmits CMV to\nnearly two susceptible people. The average age of CMV\nforce of infection was significantly higher among non-\nHispanic Blacks (5.7) and Mexican Americans (5.1) than\namong non-Hispanic Whites (1.4) (Table 1). These differ-\nences were reflected in the average age (in years) of infec-\nMexican Americans, and 29.3 for non-Hispanic Whites.\nForce of infection was significantly higher in the low\nhousehold income group (3.5) than in the middle (2.1)\nand upper (1.5) household income groups.\nWe observed considerable variation in force of infection\nwhen we stratified by age and sex (Figures 1 and 2).\nAmong adolescent girls (ages 12\u00ad19 years), non-Hispanic\nblacks had a substantially higher force of infection (9.9)\nthan the other groups. In contrast, among pre-adolescent\ngirls (ages 6\u00ad11 years), Mexican Americans had the high-\nest force of infection (11.0). Among adolescent boys (ages\n12\u00ad19 years), force of infection was highest in non-His-\npanic blacks (6.4) and Mexican Americans (8.7).\nAmong seronegative women ages 20\u00ad49 years, risk of pri-\nmary CMV infection during a full-term pregnancy was\nestimated to be 1.38 percent among non-Hispanic\nWhites, 3.40 percent among non-Hispanic Blacks, and\n3.85 percent among Mexican Americans (Table 2). How-\never, among 12\u00ad19 year-old seronegative women, risk was\nmuch higher for non-Hispanic blacks (7.33 percent) than\nfor Mexican Americans (2.21 percent) and for non-His-\npanic whites (0.15 percent). The estimated annual\nnumber of women ages 12\u00ad49 experiencing primary CMV\ninfection during pregnancy was approximately 27,000.\nMost of these infections occur in non-Hispanic Whites\nbecause they are the largest racial/ethnic group in the U.S.\nHowever, non-Hispanic Blacks and Mexican Americans,\nespecially those under age 30, are disproportionately\nlikely to have pregnancies in which they experience pri-\nmary CMV infections.\nDiscussion\nRobust estimates of the frequency of new CMV infections\nare essential for understanding and preventing viral trans-\nmission. This study provides the first estimates of CMV\nincidence that are based on population-representative\ndata. We found that among CMV-seronegative individuals\nverts each year.\nThis relatively low force of infection indicates that CMV is\nless easily transmitted than some other infections, such as\nmeasles or rubella. For these infections, high vaccine effi-\ncacy and coverage are required in order to interrupt trans-\nmission [18]. In contrast, a CMV vaccine would not need\nto have such high efficacy and coverage to substantially\nprevent CMV transmission. Griffiths et al. [10], who esti-\nyear in the United Kingdom, showed that modest rates of\nvaccination (~60 percent) would be able to eradicate CMV\ninfection from the human population. Our estimates,\nwhich are similar but even lower overall (force of infec-\ntion = 1.6/100 persons/year), provide further evidence\nthat modestly effective vaccines and rates of vaccination\ncould significantly reduce CMV transmission.\nOur models identified large racial/ethnic disparities in the\nfrequencies of new CMV infections. The force of infection\nfor CMV was considerably higher in non-Hispanic Blacks\nand Mexican Americans than in non-Hispanic Whites.\nThe nearly three-fold differences in risk of primary CMV\ninfection among seronegative women could be responsi-\nble for much of the racial/ethnic disparities in rates of\ninfants born with congenital CMV [19]. Racial/ethnic dif-\nferences were especially pronounced among adolescent\ngirls (ages 12\u00ad19 years), among whom primary infection\nwas 50 times more likely in seronegative non-Hispanic\nblacks and 15 times more likely in seronegative Mexican\nAmericans than in non-Hispanic whites. These higher\nforces of infection (i.e., incidence in seronegative individ-\nuals) suggest that CMV is circulating more frequently in\nthese racial/ethnic groups. Thus, seropositive, pregnant\nnon-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans may be at a\nhigher risk of suffering re-infection with a different strain\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nof CMV, which also places their infants at risk of sympto-\nmatic congenital CMV [8]. These disparities indicate that\ninterventions, such as vaccines or education campaigns,\nmay need to be tailored to meet the needs of different\nracial/ethnic groups and different age groups.\nIn addition to race/ethnicity, low household income was\na risk factor for CMV infection. People with low house-\nhold income may be more likely to have a larger family\nand experience crowding, thus facilitating CMV transmis-\nsion via close contact. However, because force of infection\nTable 2: Risk and frequency of CMV primary infection during pregnancy in the United States.\nAges (years) % Seronegative Risk among seronegative\npregnancies*\npregnancies\nNo. live-birth\nNo. women with\nprimary infection during\nlive-birth pregnancies\nNon-Hispanic White\nNon-Hispanic Black\nMexican American\nTable 1: CMV force of infection, basic reproductive rates, and average age of infection among persons 12\u00ad49 years old in the United\nStates.\nForce of Infection (95% CI)* Basic reproductive rate (95% CI) Average age of infection in years (95% CI)\nSex\nRace/Ethnicity\nIncome per family size\n*Number of infections per 100 susceptible persons per year.

Circles represent point estimates and lines represent 95% confidence intervals.\nNegative values for force of infection can occur because the models treat the CMV seroprevalences as if they come from a sin-\ngle cohort followed over time, when in fact they are age-specific seroprevalences of a population at a single point in time. Thus,\nin the younger ages where the sample sizes are smaller, it is possible for an older age group to have a somewhat lower sero-\nprevalence than a younger age group, which can lead to a negative value for force of infection.

A more detailed analysis\nof risk factors for CMV infection in NHANES III can be\nfound in Staras et al. [12].\nAmong women ages 20\u00ad49 years, force of infection\nappeared to be independent of age, suggesting that risk of\ninfection during pregnancy is fairly constant during these\nages, and that interventions to prevent congenital CMV\nmust target all women of childbearing age. CMV had a\nhigher force of infection than infections transmitted pri-\nmarily via sex or injection drug use, such as herpes sim-\nplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) or hepatitis B virus (HBV). This\nsuggests either that CMV is more easily transmissible\nthrough such behaviors [20] or, more likely, that CMV is\ntransmitted via other, additional routes. Given that CMV\nhas been shown to be transmitted via urine or saliva dur-\ning close, non-sexual contact, it is likely that this sort of\ntransmission plays a major role in the dynamics of CMV\ninfection [7].\nWe estimated that each year in the United States more\ninfection and are thus at high risk of giving birth to a child\nwith congenital CMV infection. This estimate does not\ninclude any fetal losses that may have been caused by pri-\nmary CMV infection, nor does it include the many preg-\nnancies affected by CMV reactivation or reinfection\namong seropositive women. The burden of primary CMV\ninfections during pregnancy falls disproportionately on\ndisadvantaged women--those of low income and racial/\nethnic minorities. Furthermore, teenaged minority\nwomen are at especially high risk of primary CMV infec-\ntions during pregnancy, due to their high prevalence of\nsusceptibility, high force of infection, and high pregnancy\nrates.\nThe risk of primary CMV infection during pregnancy\namong seronegative women is similar to previous esti-\nmates [4]. For seronegative women, CMV infection repre-\nsents one of the highest risks for fetal damage that they\nexperience during pregnancy [21]. Because CMV transmis-\nsion is potentially preventable [1], CMV antibody screen-\ning prior to or near the beginning of pregnancy should be\nevaluated as a means of identifying women at high risk for\nhaving congenitally infected infants. Studies should pur-\nsue whether knowledge of high risk status is a useful moti-\nvational tool for modifying behaviors, such as hand\nhygiene, for reducing risk of infection [22]. Such screening\nmay also lead to the administration of CMV hyperim-\nmuneglobulins or antiviral drugs for prevention or ther-\napy of fetal infection and disease [23,24].\nIn this study the modeling assumptions appeared to have\nbeen reasonably satisfied. On a population level, CMV\ninfection does not contribute significantly to mortality\namong infected individuals. Nearly all members (=99 per-\ncent) of the population are susceptible at birth, and infec-\ntion is believed to induce life-long immunity. The type I\ndeath-rate cut-off was chosen as 70 years to approximate\nthe U.S. life expectancy during the years that NHANES III\nwas conducted, but modifying the cut-off had little effect\non the model results. The assumption of homogeneous\nmixing is unlikely to be completely true, but because CMV\ninfection is common and has multiple transmission\nmodes, susceptible individuals are likely to have similar\nrisks of exposure to CMV.\nAn important limitation of our models was that the data\nwere from a single, cross-sectional study so that time\ntrends were not able to be addressed. Thus, high CMV\nseroprevalence in cohorts of older people might not\nreflect current incidence and could cause the models to\noverestimate the force of infection [12]. We sought to\nminimize this potential bias by focusing most of our anal-\nyses on a limited age range (12\u00ad49 years). It is also impor-\ntant to note that our younger, age-specific force of\nwere imprecise, with wide confidence intervals. Further-\nmore, the models implicitly assumed that seroprevalence\nwas monotonically increasing with age, as if this cross-sec-\ntional study were a cohort study in which seroprevalence\nwas measured at various ages of follow-up. However, this\nassumption was violated for some of the younger subpop-\nulations. As a result, we occasionally obtained negative\nestimates for the force of infection (Figure 2), although\nthese estimates were not statistically different from zero.\nThe calculations of risk of primary infection during preg-\nnancy required several assumptions, one of which was\nthat the force of infection was the same for pregnant and\nnon-pregnant women. Women who are pregnant may\nhave fewer sex partners (and thus lower risk of exposure to\nCMV) during pregnancy; on the other hand, pregnant\nwomen may be more likely than non-pregnant women to\nbe exposed to young children (a group that frequently\nsheds CMV). Pregnant women may also have a higher risk\nof acquiring infections because of pregnancy-induced\nimmune depression [25].\nBased on our models, we would estimate that more than\none million United States women have experienced pri-\nmary CMV infections during pregnancy since CMV was\ntion of these infections would have led to congenital\ninfections, leaving thousands of children with lifelong\ndisabilities. Children from disadvantaged racial/ethnic\ngroups are likely to have been disproportionately\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nimpacted. These many affected children are a compelling\nargument for accelerating research on vaccines and other\ninterventions for the prevention of congenital CMV [28].\nConclusion\nEach year, thousands of CMV infections occur in pregnant\nwomen in the United States, putting numerous unborn\nbabies at risk for serious disabilities. Incidence of CMV\ninfection in pregnant women is not distributed evenly,\nbut exhibits sharp racial/ethnic disparities, especially\naffecting non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans.\nBecause of the magnitude of the problem and its associ-\nated health disparities, there is an urgent need to acceler-\nate research on vaccines and other interventions for\npreventing congenital CMV disease. Nevertheless, the low\nincidence of CMV infection relative to other vaccine-pre-\nventable infections provides encouraging evidence that\nExample of piece-wise log-linear model among non-Hispanic black women\nExample of piece-wise log-linear model among non-Hispanic black women.\nAge (y)\nCMV Seronegative proportion\nTable 3: Comparison of force of infection for different viruses for selected* age ranges.\nVirus Force of infection (per 100\npersons per year)\nAges modeled Study sample Citation\n*Ages were selected to be roughly comparable with the ages we modeled; in general, young children were not selected for comparison because\nthey often had much higher forces of infection.

All authors read and approved the final manu-\nscript and revised it critically for important intellectual\ncontent.\nAppendix\nTo estimate CMV incidence by using the force of infection,\nwe used the catalytic model approach described in Far-\nrington [14] and Anderson [13]. We began by assuming\nthat the force of infection was age-dependent, so that\nwhere a is age and S-(a) is the age distribution for the\nseronegatives. To assess the shape of the integral above we\nproceeded as Farrington, by visual inspections. (x)was\nevaluated as an exponential decay function and as a poly-\nnomial of third or lesser degree. Despite permitting (x)\nto be a complicated function, force of infection was\napproximately constant as a function of age (i.e., force of\ninfection was age-independent). Therefore, we used the\nlog-linear approach where the force of infection is the\nslope of the regression model (i.e., (x) equals the con-\nstant ) given by ln(S-(a)) = -(\n+ a). This model, used\nby Griffiths [10] to estimate CMV force of infection, also\nseemed to fit the NHANES III data in most cases, where \nplays the role of the natural logarithm of the age-adjusted\nseronegative proportion. We made one modification to\nthis model when we estimated force of infection within\nsubgroups:  was treated as constant within pieces of the\nyears (Figure 3).\nWith the age-independent assumption, the average age of\ninfection, A, and the basic reproductive rate, R0\n, were esti-\nmated by:\nwhere L = 70 is the threshold age for the type I death rate.\nWhen estimating force of infection for different subgroup\ncategories, one category was chosen to be the referent cat-\negory and the others were represented by indicator varia-\nbles and were included in the models with interaction for\nage. For example, in the case of race/ethnicity, which had\n3 categories and White as the referent category, the model\nwas:\nln(S-(a)) = -(\n+ \na + \n[White - Black] + \n[Mexican] +\n\n[White - Black]a + \n[Mexican]a),\nwhere  [X] = 1 if X and 0 otherwise.\nThe final models were estimated using the STATA 8.0\n(College Station, TX) svypoisson command (log-linear\nmodel), which is appropriate for complex survey estima-\ntion. The sample weight, cluster, and strata variables sug-\ngested by the NHANES III analytical guidelines were used\nto adjust the estimates for the sample design. The variance\nwas estimated by the linearization method [29]. The R0\nand A and their confidence intervals were estimated using\nthe nlcom command for non-linear transformations of\nthe regression parameters.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Kay Radford, Ashley Schoenfisch and Minal Amin for serologic\ntesting and Geraldine McQuillan for technical assistance.
