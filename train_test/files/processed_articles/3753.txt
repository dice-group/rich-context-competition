This is the\nquestion our article sets out to address. Our main hypothesis\nis that the higher the degree of mutual trust between manage-\nment and works councils, the stronger the preference of both\nparties for plant-level bargaining. The basic rationale for this\nhypothesis is the assumption that trust furthers interaction\nbetween the bargaining parties (Axelrod, 1984; Thompson,\nWang, & Gunia, 2010) and reduces uncertainty. This implies\na higher preference for plant-level bargaining and a lower\npreference for supraplant-level bargaining, that is, multiem-\nployer bargaining. We will elaborate the hypothesis and the\nrationale in detail below.\nRelationships of trust and bargaining do not exist in a social\nvacuum. They are rather embedded in both a legal and factual\nregulatory framework and a discursive context. Currently, in\nGermany, quantitative working conditions (e.g., the number of\nworking hours and above all pay) are still primarily negotiated\nat the regional and industry levels, that is, between unions\n(e.g., the metal workers union IG Metall) and employers asso-\nciations (in this example, Gesamtmetall for the metal industry;\nconclude their own enterprise or company-level agreements\nwith a trade union, Germany has, compared with other\nindustrialized countries, a medium (industry- or region-wide)\ncollective bargaining coverage rate (Keller & Kirsch, 2011).\nGermany were covered by industry-wide agreements (63%\nMultiemployer bargaining is still significant, but develop-\nments since the 1990s indicate an erosion of the typical\nGerman system of collective bargaining. First, the rate of\nemployees covered by industry- or region-wide collective\nagreements is slowly and steadily decreasing. Accordingly, an\nincreasing proportion of employees (7% and 13%, respec-\ntively, in 2010) work either in companies with an enterprise or\ncompany-level agreement or in companies that are not bound\nby any collective agreement (37% of all employees in western\nare many reasons for this development, including the tendency\nfor newly founded firms not to organize in employers'associa-\ntions and for existing firms to leave them.

Third, the character of collective agreements itself is\nchanging; an increasing proportion of industry-wide collective\nagreements contain what are known as \"opening clauses\"\n(\u00d6ffnungsklauseln), which allow deviations from the agreed\nstandards and give partial bargaining rights to works councils\nand management at the company level. All these factors com-\nbine to produce a development that can be characterized as the\n\"decentralization of bargaining,\" with a stronger emphasis on\ncompany or plant-level bargaining (see Haipeter, 2011a,\nThese material changes have been accompanied by a con-\ntroversial political discussion on the decentralization of\nbargaining--whether a shift in bargaining from the supra-\nplant and collective level to the plant or company level\nshould be supported, welcomed, or opposed, and to what\nextent. Critics of the German multiemployer bargaining sys-\ntem regard the industry-wide, supraplant-level bargaining of\nwages, working hours, and so on by unions and employers\nassociations as inflexible (see Berthold & Stettes, 2001;\nposition, multiemployer bargaining agreements should, at\nmost, encompass framework regulations because through\ndecentralized bargaining, better consideration would be\ngiven to company-specific circumstances, which in turn\nwould increase efficiency. According to the Works\nConstitution Act (1972), works councils and management\nare allowed to conclude works or company agreements, but\nit is illegal for works agreements to deal with remuneration\nand other conditions of employment that have been or are\nnormally fixed by collective agreement (except a collective\nagreement expressly authorizing the making of supplemen-\ntary or divergent works agreements by way of the \"opening\nclauses\"). Some critics, nevertheless, call for multiemployer\nbargaining agreements to be completely replaced by works\nagreements (see Bispinck, 2004). This raises the question of\nthe consequences for the bargaining parties at the company\nlevel. Interestingly, we know not only very little of the con-\nsequences but also of the preferences of the central actors\nresponsible for bargaining at the company level, in particular\nworks councillors and human resource managers. This is\nsurprising because a clear break from the multiemployer bar-\ngaining system would mean that they would have to bear all\nthe consequences, negative as well as positive. Preferences\nfor or against different systems of bargaining are not least\ninfluenced by the social relationship between the bargaining\nparties, in particular the relationship of trust. One of our\nmain theoretical assumptions here is that the preference for\nplant-level bargaining is influenced by the level of trust\nbetween the bargaining parties. We will return to this in the\ntheory section below, but the argument in brief is as follows:\nA high level of (mutual) trust furthers a positive preference\nfor bargaining between the parties in the relationship of trust;\nthis implies a preference for plant-level bargaining. Low\n(mutual) trust, thus, has a positive effect on a preference for\nindustry- or sector-level bargaining. To test these assump-\ntions, we draw on data from a questionnaire survey of 1,000\nmanagers and 1,000 works councillors involved in joint bar-\ngaining relationships regarding their position on decentral-\nized bargaining. We also measure the mutual trust of these\nprotagonists using a well-tested trust scale. Specifically, we\nask how high or low the level of trust is, that is, the extent of\ntrust placed in the respective bargaining party; how fre-\nquently configurations of mutual mistrust, unilateral trust,\nand mutual trust occur; and how the level of trust and trust\nconfigurations affect the preference for decentralized bar-\ngaining and a specific bargaining partner.\nOur study draws on country-specific data, but it also aims\nto answer a more general question by analyzing the relation-\nship between trust relationships and bargaining processes at\nthe plant level. Although the data refer to the German bar-\ngaining system, the research question and the results should\nbe transferable to countries with different systems, particu-\nlarly those with works councils, but also with other bargain-\ning relationships, for example, plant-level bargaining\nbetween unions and management or industry-level collective\nbargaining between unions and employers associations.\nThe article begins by outlining the state of (theoretical\nand empirical) research on trust relationships between man-\nagement boards and works councillors and on the prefer-\nences of these actors in terms of decentralized bargaining\n(see section titled Previous Research). We then go on to for-\nmulate our hypotheses (section titled General Theoretical\nIdeas and Hypothesis for Further Analysis). The data and the\noperationalization of the variables are described in the sec-\ntion titled Data and Operationalization, and the results of our\nanalysis in the Results section. The article concludes with a\ndiscussion of the findings and conclusions for further\nresearch (Discussion and Conclusions (For Research)).\nPrevious Research\nWhy does trust play such an important role in industrial\nrelationships (Fox, 1974) and particularly in relationships\nbetween management boards and employee representatives?\nAnd why do we suppose trust between management and\nworks councils to have a positive effect on their preference\nfor decentralized (plant-level) bargaining? Trust can be of\nbenefit to bargaining (Kerkhof, Winder, & Klandermans,\n2003). A high degree of trust in the other party increases the\nprobability of integrative bargaining and reduces that of\ndistributive bargaining (Walton & McKersie, 1965); the\nprotagonists define their respective situation less as a zero-\nsum game, and their willingness to compromise increases\nturn, mutual trust between management and works councils\nshould therefore also influence preferences as to whether\nworking and pay conditions are negotiated at the plant level\nor, alternatively, at the supraplant level--thereby effectively\nNienhueser and Hossfeld 3\ndelegating bargaining and reducing the potential for conflict\nat the plant level.\nFindings relating to trust relationships (e.g., mutual trust,\nunilateral trust, or mistrust) between management boards\nand works councils are scarce. Kerkhof et al. (2003) used a\nshortened form of the Organizational Trust Inventory\n(Cummings & Bromiley, 1996) in the Netherlands (in two\nsurveys) to measure the degree of trust over 300 works coun-\ncillors placed in their respective management boards. They\nfound a relatively high level of trust but also quite consider-\nable differences from company to company. The question\nremains open as to how management trusts works council-\nlors and what impact this has on a preference for decentral-\nized bargaining.\nOnly a few surveys explicitly deal with managers' prefer-\nences for decentralized bargaining, but these studies do not\nexamine the reasons for the differences in these preferences.\nBahnm\u00fcller (2002) carried out a survey of managers and\nworks councillors in three sectors that also addressed the\nevaluation of the multiemployer bargaining system. Only the\nresults of companies bound to collective agreements were\nincluded in the report. In all, 23% of managers believe that\nthere is no need for change, 60% believe that changes are\nnecessary although the system has proven itself, and 14%\nsay that the system has not proven itself and bargaining\nshould only take place at the plant or company level. Around\n3% are of the opinion that only individual agreements should\nbe concluded and that collective bargaining agreements\nshould be done away with altogether. The proportion of man-\nagers who believe the multiemployer bargaining system to\nhave proven successful thus stands at 83%.\nAt first glance, and maybe not very surprisingly, members\nof works councils massively reject decentralization of bar-\ngaining. This is repeatedly shown in surveys of works coun-\nbelieve that decentralized bargaining should be \"welcomed,\"\nwhereas almost a third (30%) are \"undecided,\" and 53%\nthink it would prove to be \"generally problematic.\" However,\na closer look reveals that the picture is not quite so clear:\n49% think that the works council would have more freedom\nof scope and 48% that circumstances at the respective com-\npany could be better taken into account through decentral-\nized bargaining. In the Bahnm\u00fcller (2002) survey, on one\nhand, 56% of works councillors believe that the multiem-\nployer bargaining system has proven itself and requires no\nchange, and only 4% think the system has not proven itself\nand bargaining should take place at the plant, company, or\nindividual level. On the other hand, a sizable 40% think it\nhas proven itself but is in need of change.\nIn summary, first, there are no reliable results relating to\nthe level and configuration of trust between management and\nworks councils. Second, no study exists that simultaneously\nanalyzes the preference for decentralized bargaining and\nother characteristics of both bargaining parties within the\nsame company. Third, the influence of trust on the\npreference for decentralized bargaining has not been investi-\ngated. This study aims to close these research gaps.\nGeneralTheoretical Ideas and\nHypothesis for Further Analysis\nOur general theoretical idea is simple: The preference for\ndecentralized bargaining is dependent on trust and also on\nthe objective situation of the company and the perceived\nconsequences of decentralized bargaining.\nOur main hypothesis is that management and works coun-\ncil will take a more positive (or less negative) stance on\ndecentralized bargaining (i.e., plant-level bargaining) if it\ndeems the other party trustworthy. Mutual trust implies that\nthe behavior of the other party is more predictable and that\nthe perceived probability of integrative and less distributive\nbargaining is higher compared with a situation of low trust.\nAhigh level of trust does not only mean a reduction of uncer-\ntainty and expectations of a win\u00adwin situation. It also means\nlower expected transaction costs, for example, a lower level\nof conflict or a less time-consuming bargaining process.\nTrust also furthers interaction between the parties, which\nthese factors together lead us to the assumption that the pref-\nerence for decentralized bargaining (plant-level bargaining)\nwill be stronger in a situation in which both parties trust each\nother. The less trust put in the other party, the lower the\nacceptance level of that party in terms of decentralized bar-\ngaining. In this situation, the party will have a higher prefer-\nence for more centralized bargaining, that is, with the help of\na more powerful partner, in other words the employers asso-\nciation for the employer (or management) and the trade\nunion for the works council. Expressed in statistical terms,\nwe expect both a main effect and an interaction with respect\nto trust. In a configuration characterized by mutual trust,\nboth sides should be more likely to regard plant-level bar-\ngaining as a win\u00adwin situation. By contrast, a party that mis-\ntrusts the other respective party would focus more strongly\non the relative benefits of supraplant bargaining, such as the\nexternalization of conflicts (or transaction costs), and be less\ninclined to support decentralized bargaining.\nPrimarily, our interest focuses on the effects of trust; how-\never, other potential influencing factors are also taken into\naccount in the form of control variables.\nObjective factors (such as economic context or size of\nfirm) do not exert their assumed influence on both corporate\nparties to an equal extent and in the same direction. We\nhypothesize that managers in a company experiencing an\nunfavorable economic situation would be more aware of the\nbenefits of decentralized bargaining and, in such a situation,\nmore likely to be in favor of decentralized bargaining.\nConversely, the same economic situation could have the\nopposite effect on the position of a works council if it fears\nthat a greater level of decentralized bargaining could result\nin wage reductions and/or longer working hours. The effects\n4 SAGE Open\nof company size also require differentiation: In larger com-\npanies, the management position on decentralized bargain-\ning is expected to be one of skeptical opposition because the\nsavings effect of multiemployer collective bargaining agree-\nments in terms of bargaining costs is more relevant in their\ncase. Although even potential bargaining with individual\nemployees is comparatively straightforward and not overly\ntime-consuming in small enterprises, bargaining regimes\nthat offer more comprehensive cover generally prove less\ncostly in larger companies. In the case of works councils, the\nimpact could well be the same, albeit for a different reason.\nWorks councils in large companies potentially have greater\nbargaining power and thus see themselves better equipped\nfor a shift of bargaining to plant level. We furthermore argue\nthat the existing form of bargaining (or the existing degree of\ndecentralization) could have an effect on the preferences for\nplant-level bargaining. In particular, the existence of a bind-\ning multiemployer collective agreement could have a posi-\ntive or negative effect on the preference for decentralized\nbargaining, depending on the experience with this type of\nregulation and the respective protagonist. The degree of\nunionization (of the works council) can have a negative\neffect with respect to management, because the latter may\nwell be reluctant to get involved in major conflicts with a\nhighly organized and possibly confrontational works coun-\ncil. The effect of this particular variable on the works council\nis unclear because it is difficult to interpret. On one hand, a\nhigher unionization rate is equated with greater bargaining\npower and consequently with a positive effect on the prefer-\nence for decentralized bargaining; on the other hand, higher\nunionization reflects a stronger alignment of union positions,\nwhich could be accompanied by a negative effect, namely,\nrejection of decentralized bargaining.\nAnother important factor is the influence of the antici-\npated consequences of decentralized bargaining. Essentially,\nthe assumption is that the more the protagonists associate\npositive consequences with decentralized bargaining, the\ngreater the preference for decentralized bargaining will be.\nData and Operationalization\nData\nIn 2005, a representative telephone survey was carried out\n(by TNS EMNID) involving 1,000 personnel managers and\n1,000 works councillors in as many companies, each with at\nleast 100 employees. In each company, a management rep-\nresentative responsible for negotiating with the works coun-\ncil was identified and interviewed. Taking this person as a\nstarting point, the interviewers then also questioned a mem-\nber of the works council (responsible for bargaining with the\nmanagement).\nA random sample was drawn from the Hoppenstedt data-\nall those companies with at least 100 employees from all\nsectors--with the exception of agriculture and forestry, the\nfishing industry, and the educational sector. Thus, our results\nare primarily representative of manufacturing companies and\nlarge companies with a works council.\nOperationalization of Variables\nTrust and trust relationships. The following statements\n(drawing on a questionnaire by Kerkhof et al., 2003) were\napplied to measure perceived trust (here in the formulations\nused in relation to management trust in the works council):\n1. The works council abides by agreements.\n2. The management can rely on the works council if\nthe company experiences a difficult situation.\n3. The works council is trustworthy.\n4. The works council deems the achievement of a\nmutual solution to be important when bargaining\nwith the management.\n5. The works council is open to management propos-\nals.\n6. All in all, the works council and management have\na good relationship.\nThe trust the works councils place in management was also\nanalyzed using the respective questions for works councillors.\nFactor analyses show a one-factor solution for managers\nand works councillors alike (explained variance: 62% for\nmanagement and 63% for works councils). Cronbach's alpha\nwas .88 for both scales. For ease of interpretation, the trust\nindex adds the affirmative responses for each respective\nquestion and divides the sum by the number of questions. In\naddition, dichotomous variables that can assume the values 0\n(low degree of trust) and 1 (high degree of trust) are com-\nputed; the limits by which \"low\" and \"high\" are determined\nhave yet to be established. This point will be addressed later\nin the study.\nTrust relationships are conceptualized by cross-classifying\nthe dichotomized management and works council trust vari-\nables, which logically results in four possible combinations: a\nlow degree of mutual trust, unilateral trust on the part of the\nworks council, unilateral trust on the part of the management,\nand a high degree of mutual trust.\nPreference for decentralized bargaining. The preference for\ndecentralized bargaining is measured on the basis of three\nquestions derived from surveys carried out by the Institute of\nEconomic and Social Research in the Hans B\u00f6ckler Founda-\ntion, Germany (Bispinck, 2005) and the general debate on\ndecentralization and decentralized bargaining.\nThe first question relates to the perception that collective\nbargaining agreements should only function as framework\nregulations. \"In the past, framework regulations were negoti-\nated in many collective bargaining agreements that had to be\nimplemented at the plant level (e.g., working hours). This is\nNienhueser and Hossfeld 5\nconsequently regarded as a `decentralization' of pay rate\npolicy and `decentralized bargaining' of work and pay\ncondition regulations. How would you evaluate this develop-\nment?\" (scale: extremely positive\u00adpositive\u00adneutral\u00adnegative\u00ad\nextremely negative). For the logistic regression analysis, we\ncalculate a dummy variable, that is, the first two positive val-\nues are coded as 1, otherwise as 0.\nThe second question seeks to ascertain the position vis-\u00e0-\nvis a greater shift of bargaining to plant level and the incor-\nporation of plant protagonists: \"There is also increasing\ndiscussion about whether collective bargaining should take\nplace less at the supraplant level between employer associa-\ntions and unions. Many suggestions call for a greater shift of\ncollective bargaining to plant level, in other words, between\nmanagements and works councils. How would you evaluate\nthese suggestions?\" (scale: extremely positive\u00adpositive\u00ad\nneutral\u00adnegative\u00adextremely negative). The dummy coding\nis the same as for the first question.\nThe third question relates directly to a rejection or\nendorsement of multiemployer collective bargaining agree-\nments: \"All in all, I endorse a more intensive break away\nfrom a system of multiemployer collective bargaining\"\n(scale: I fully agree\u00adI tend to agree\u00adI tend to disagree\u00adI\ntotally disagree). For the logistic regression analysis, we cal-\nculate a dummy variable with the positive values (agree)\ncoded as 1 and the negative (disagree) as 0.\nThe above questions refer to different aspects of bargain-\ning decentralization and hence they are used separately as\nspecific dependent variables.\nContext or control variables. One important context variable\nis the present type of bargaining regulation, or in other words,\nthe existing degree of decentralization. The type or form of\nregulation is measured by a variable with the four following\nattributes: (a) existence of an industry-wide collective bar-\ngaining agreement; (b) existence only of a plant collective bar-\ngaining agreement with a trade union; (c) no binding collective\nbargaining agreement, but a collective agreement is used as\norientation (i.e., firms not covered by collective agreements\nare influenced by the regulations set in industry-wide agree-\nments by the \"orientation\" of their managers toward such\nagreements); or (d) no existing collective agreement and no\norientation toward a collective bargaining agreement. These\nstatements will also be used as dummy variables (reference\ncategory: existing industry-wide collective bargaining\nagreement).\nIndustry-sector affiliation is also to be included as a con-\ntrol variable (manufacturing sector; yes = 1).\nThe size of a company is measured by the number of\nWe hypothesize that managers in companies located in the\nnewly formed German states (=1), recently established\ncompanies (founded after 1990 = 1), and companies in an\nunfavorable economic position (achieved profit = 1, otherwise\n0) would tend more toward decentralized bargaining because\nthey would attach greater importance to the anticipated posi-\ntive consequences of decentralized bargaining (particularly\nalignment and pay reduction). Any future organizational\nchange could also play a role in terms of the preference for\ndecentralized bargaining (production or products will change\nwithin the next 2 years = 1). To control for other potential dif-\nferentiations in corporate structure and processes, we incorpo-\nrate the demographic composition of the workforce by using\nthe proportion of academics, women, and skilled workers as\nproxies.\nThe degree of unionization of the works council members\n( median 80% = 1) should prove a better indicator than the\nunionization rate of a firm's total workforce. With regard to\nthe (perceived) power of the works council, both parties\nwere asked, \"In your opinion, how much influence does your\nworks council have in comparison with other companies?\"\n(1 = above average, 0 = average/below average). With\nregard to management preference for decentralized bargain-\ning, we draw on the manager's own assessment of power; for\nthe works councils' preference for decentralized bargaining,\nwe likewise draw on their own assessment.\nAssessments of the consequences of decentralized bar-\ngaining are obtained by considering a large number of\nstatements (drawing on Bispinck, 2005) relating to the spe-\ncific consequences of a greater \"break away from multiem-\nployer bargaining agreements--in other words, a more\nintense use of opt-out clauses and a shift of bargaining to\nthe plant level involving the works councils and manage-\nments.\" The interviewees could express their endorsement\nor rejection (on a respective four-stage scale ranging from\n\"totally agree\" to \"totally disagree\") of the following state-\nments: (a) would take the different company situations bet-\nter into account, (b) would lead to conflicts within the\ncompany, (c) would result in lower pay, (d) would give\nmore power to the unions within the company, (e) would\nweaken the power of unions in Germany, (f) could help\nsave jobs, (g) would give the works council more influence\nand freedom of scope, (h) would give the management\nmore influence and freedom of scope, (i) would unduly\nexpend too much time and effort, (j) would overtax the\nworks council, and (k) would overtax the management. To\neliminate the possible effect of the response option order, the\norder of most of the statements was randomly changed from\ninterview to interview. A factor analysis, the results of which\nare not reported in detail here, led to a three-factor solution\nfor both management and works councils. The first factor\ncan be interpreted as a cost factor encompassing transaction\ncosts (conflicts, time consumption) and production costs\n(primarily pay reductions). The second factor is regarded as\nan alignment and workplace effect factor, whereby the\nassigned values for the following items were particularly\nhigh: greater influence for the corporate protagonists,\nenhanced alignment in terms of corporate concerns, and a\npositive impact on jobs. The third factor ascertains the weak-\nening of the unions in both a company and supracompany\n6 SAGE Open\nsense. Overall, these three factors account for 55% (man-\nagement) and 58% (works council) of the variance.\nResults\nDescriptive Findings\nOn average, the degree of trust (Table 1) is surprisingly high\nin both parties (see Table 3 for descriptive statistics). The\nmanagement achieves levels of affirmative responses between\n83% and 98% in the form of statements indicative of high\ntrust, whereas the levels attained by the works council are\nonly slightly lower (between 73% and 88% depending on the\nstatement). The summarizing statement \"All in all, a good\nrelationship\" achieves affirmative response levels of around\n90% in respect of both parties (management 92%, works\ncouncil 88%). The trust index, which principally varies\nbetween 1 (low degree of trust) and 4 (high degree of trust),\nConsequently, a problem arises if a distinction is to be\nmade between \"high\" and \"low\" trust.\nWe calculated two different dichotomized trust variables\nfor each party. For Trust Variable 1, trust is coded as high (=1)\nif all six questions receive an affirmative response; otherwise\nthe value of the variable will be zero. For Trust Variable 2, a\nhigh value is allocated (=1) if at least four questions receive\nan affirmative response (0 otherwise).\nBoth trust values are then cross-classified. The four pos-\nsible combinations are shown in Table 2.\ntrust level value is allocated only when all the statements\nreceive an affirmative response, then \"only\" 49.5% of cases\nfall into the \"mutual trust\" constellation. If the threshold is\nlowered and a high trust level value is allocated for four\naffirmative responses, then the percentage of relationships\ncharacterized by mutual trust rises to 78%.\nPreference for decentralized bargaining. Managers and\nworks councils differ in their degree of preference for decen-\ntralized bargaining (Table 4). Only between 20% and 31% of\nworks councillors endorse decentralized bargaining, whereas\nthe corresponding percentages for managers are between\nOverall, this provides a clear picture: Managers take a\nnegative position against a multiemployer collective bar-\ngaining system and show a high degree of preference for\ndecentralized bargaining. The evaluations of the works coun-\ncils are largely a mirror image of the managers' evaluations.\nOnly a minority of works councils (20%) were in favor of a\nbreak away from a system of multiemployer collective bar-\ngaining, compared with 83% of the managers.\nThe question now is whether we can explain such differ-\nences. We hypothesize that trust relationships between the\nworks councils and management (independent of other\ncompany characteristics and the consequences of decentral-\nized bargaining) will have an impact.\nTable 1.

Although the focus is\non the impact of the trust relationship, we also want to know\nwhether, and to what degree, other (contextual) factors may\nalso have an effect. We estimate a binary logistic regression\nmodel. Trust is conceptualized using the trust constellation\nvariable (Version 1, see Table 2) and coding each constellation\nas a dummy variable. For instance, \"low mutual trust\" is\ncoded as 1 if each party shows a low level of trust; otherwise\nthe variable is coded as 0. Thus, we apply three dummy vari-\nables; the reference category is \"high degree of mutual trust.\"\nThe results are presented in the two following tables, which\nencompass a total of six regression analyses.\nTo begin with, let us look at the effects relating to the man-\nagers' preference for decentralized bargaining (Table 5).2\nTrust has no statistically significant effect on the preference\nfor decentralized bargaining among managers; the strength\nof the effect is negligible. The only nonsignificant effect\ncoefficient worth reporting on account of its strength does\nnot coincide with our hypotheses: In a situation where there\nis a low degree of mutual trust, the chance that a manager\nwill endorse a break away from a multiemployer collective\nbargaining system is higher by a factor of 1.602.3 As such,\nour trust hypotheses are not corroborated in relation to three\ncore aspects of the preference for decentralized bargaining\n(collective bargaining agreements as a framework, shifting of\nbargaining to plant level, and endorsement of a break away\nfrom multiemployer collective bargaining agreements).\nBy contrast, the form of regulation has a relatively strong\nimpact. When compared with the situation in companies\nbound by multiemployer collective agreements, the chance\nof a manager endorsing a break away from this multiem-\nployer bargaining system is around 11 times higher in the\ncase of managers at companies not bound by collective\nagreements and not using such agreements for orientation\n(effect coefficient = 11.322). That the anticipated conse-\nquences of decentralized bargaining have a relatively strong\nand significant effect is compellingly evident: Those who\nanticipate higher costs in relation to decentralized bargaining\nare likelier to reject it or, in the case of managers, endorse\nit to a lesser extent. Those who perceive enhanced alignment\nas a consequence are likelier to endorse decentralized\nbargaining.\nFor the works councillors (Table 6), the pattern of results\ncorresponds with our trust hypothesis. We find a consistently\nnegative effect of low mutual trust on all three dimensions of\nthe preference for decentralized bargaining. In a constella-\ntion of low mutual trust (compared with the reference cate-\ngory), the preference for collective bargaining agreements\nonly in the form of regulating frameworks is significantly\nlower (effect coefficient = 0.404). For the two other dimen-\nsions, the effect coefficients are negative as hypothesized,\nbut not significant. Although we view these findings as a\n(albeit weak) corroboration of our trust hypothesis with\nregard to the works councils, we must admit that we weigh\nthe direction (and to some extent also the strength) of the\ncoefficients higher than their significance.\nIt is interesting that the preference for decentralized\nbargaining--in relation to shifting bargaining to the plant\nlevel and a general break away from the multiemployer col-\nlective bargaining agreement system--is significantly stron-\nger among works councils in companies that use collective\nbargaining agreements merely for orientation than among\nthose in companies bound to collective bargaining\nagreements.\nTable 4.

No effect can be identified in the case of managers. It is\nnow necessary to check whether these findings are indeed\nreliable, for example, by including further variables and\nother means of operationalization. This is dealt with below.\nDiscussion and Conclusions (For\nResearch)\nThe effects of trust on the preference for decentralized\nbargaining in relation to the level of regulation are not verifi-\nable in terms of the management. From a works council\nperspective, mutual trust has (albeit weak and in part nonsig-\nnificant) positive effects on the preference for decentralized\nbargaining in general and on the preference for bargaining at\nthe plant level. This fact notwithstanding, a number of ques-\ntions and problems still need to be addressed, and these are\ndiscussed in the following section.\nOverestimation of the Level ofTrust\nThe degree of trust appears to be very high, and it could well\nbe that it has been overestimated. We have, therefore, subse-\nquently considered whether only companies in which a high\ndegree of trust prevailed actually responded. No information\nTable 6.

In this situation, it is\nnot possible to determine the potential basis for overestima-\ntion definitively. The fact that we used well-tested and only\nslightly modified items for measuring trust means that few\nmeasurement problems are likely to arise. Ultimately, the\nassumption relating to overestimation can only be clarified\nin further surveys. Perhaps the very reason why trust is so\nimportant in industrial relationships, which are characterized\nby contrasting interests and latent or manifest conflicts, is\nbecause it is so fragile. This is conceivably one reason why\nthe protagonists are more likely to provide affirmative\nresponses to the generally positively formulated trust-item\nquestions. Other comparative measurement procedures\nshould thus be used to measure the extent of trust and its\nvarious constellations.\nPreference for Decentralized Bargaining\nIn conformity with other studies, the preference for decen-\ntralized bargaining on the part of works council members\nis marginal. Conversely, managers show a strong preference\nfor decentralized bargaining. There is no evidence of\nmeasurement problems. As the correlations relating to the\nNienhueser and Hossfeld 11\nconsequences are contextually plausible in practically all\ninstances and are also sufficiently high, we conclude that the\nmeasurement was valid.\nDeterminants Relating to the Preference for\nDecentralized Bargaining\nFirst, we cannot rule out the possibility that we have not\ncovered all aspects of the regulation of bargaining for all\ncompanies. For instance, we do not measure whether \"wild\"\ndecentralization, in other words, firms illegally deviating\nfrom binding collective agreements, is used as a way out of\nthe collective bargaining system. Similarly, we do not know\nhow long a firm is bound or not bound to a collective agree-\nment; this may be significant because the length of experi-\nence with the respective bargaining regulation could\ninfluence the preference for decentralization.\nIn terms of the preference for a specific level of bargain-\ning, trust has no significant or notably strong effect on the\npreference for decentralized bargaining among managers. In\nthe case of works councils, we tend to regard our hypothesis\non the positive effects of mutual trust as at least partly cor-\nroborated. The second point thus concerns the open question\nas to why such an effect is apparent in one case and not in the\nother. One assumption is that works councils are less power-\nful; it follows that trust relationships, and consequently the\ndifferences in trust relationships, have greater significance\nfor them than for management. Those who have less power\nare more reliant on interpreting the actual and anticipated\nbehavior of those with greater power. Trust accordingly\nplays a role in this context. The party with the greater power\ncan also impose its will on the other party--consequently\ndefining power--and has no need for trust. It may show\ntrust, but it is not obliged to do so. Moreover, differences in\ntrust are not relevant in terms of the more powerful party\nimposing its will on the less powerful. The relationship\nbetween power and trust would be an important subject for\nfurther research.\n"
