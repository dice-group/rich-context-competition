This study examines the association between over-\nall diet quality and academic performance.\nrents were surveyed as part of the Children's Lifestyle and School-performance Study.\nInformation on dietary intake, height, and weight and sociodemographic variables\nwere linked to results of a provincial standardized literacy assessment. Diet Quality\nIndex--International was used to summarize overall diet quality. Multilevel regression\nmethods were used to examine the association between indicators of diet quality and\nacademic performance while adjusting for gender and socioeconomic characteristics\nof parents and residential neighborhoods.\nRESULTS: Across various indicators of diet quality, an association with academic perfor-\nmance was observed.

A number of factors are re-\ncognized as affecting school performance including\ngender, ethnicity, quality of school and school experi-\nence, nutrition, child health, and socioeconomic fac-\ntors.4 This paper focuses on the importance of\nnutrition, specifically overall diet quality, to academic\nperformance.\nIn past decades, poor diet, characterized by excess\nintake of dietary fat and refined sugars and inade-\nquate intake of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains,\nhas been identified as one of the primary mecha-\nnisms underlying the rising prevalence of overweight\nand obesity in school-age children.5,6 The prevalence\nof childhood overweight and obesity is particularly\nhigh in North America and more specifically in the\nprovince of Nova Scotia where the prevalence of child-\nhood overweight is significantly higher than the\nnational average.7-9 Examination of the prevalence\nof overweight among grade 5 students in Nova Scotia\nindicates that 32.9% of students were at risk for over-\nweight, with 9.9% being overweight.10 The diminish-\ning diet quality and increasing body weights among\nchildren draw renewed public health attention to the\neffects of diet on academic performance and future\nhealth.\nThe relationship between diet and academic perfor-\nmance is often stated; however, few studies have\nexamined the effects of diet quality on academic per-\nformance. Studies of nutrition and academic perfor-\nmance have typically focused on hunger, malnutrition,\nand micronutrient deficiency.11-13 Undernourished\nchildren have been shown to have decreased atten-\ndance, attention, and academic performance as well\nas experience more health problems compared to\nwell-nourished children.11,14 More recently, studies\nhave examined the impact of breakfast on cognition,\nbehavior, and academic performance of school-age\neffect of breakfast on performance of specific cognitive\nining the long-term effects of breakfast on school per-\nformance and how the observed effects of breakfast\non cognition are modified by age, sex, and nutritional\nstatus.11,17 The single study not restricted to breakfast\ndemonstrated a positive association between the con-\nsumption of regular meals and school performance.18\nThe predominant approach to studying diet has\nfocused on the role of individual nutrients or foods.19\nHowever, individuals do not consume single nutrients\nbut combinations of foods.20 In recognition of the mul-\ntidimensional nature of diet, studies of the interrela-\ntions of nutrition and health have examined the\neffects of overall diet quality using summary measures\nof food and nutrient intake.20,21 The current study em-\nploys such an approach to investigate the association\nbetween diet quality and academic performance in\na sample of 5200 grade 5 students in the province of\nNova Scotia, Canada.\nMETHODS\nSubjects\nThe 2003 Children's Lifestyle and School-perfor-\nmance Study (CLASS) is a large study of health, nutri-\ntion, physical activity, school performance, and\nsocioeconomic determinants among grade 5 students\nin Nova Scotia, Canada, where 98.4% of students\nattend public school.22 Of the 291 Nova Scotia public\nin the recruitment of participants by distributing a con-\nsent form and short survey to parents. Parental consent\nwas received for 5517 students, giving an average\nresponse rate of 51.1% per school. Trained CLASS rep-\nresentatives visited participating schools during school\nhours to administer a survey on children's activities and\na modified version of the Harvard Youth/Adolescent\nFood Frequency Questionnaire (YAQ).23 Height and\nweight of participating students were also measured\nby CLASS representatives in a discreet manner behind\na mobile screen in student classrooms. Height was mea-\nsured to the nearest 0.1 cm after students had removed\ntheir shoes and body weight to the nearest 0.1 kg on\ncalibrated digital scales. Generally, the administra-\ntion of the surveys and measurement of heights and\nweights took less than 45 minutes to complete. Further\ndetails on the conduct of the CLASS are provided\nEthics Approval. This study, including the\ninformed consent procedure, was approved by the\nHealth Sciences Human Research Ethics Board of Dal-\nhousie University. Informed consent was obtained\nfrom parents before the participation of their children.\nInstruments\nAssessment of Diet Quality. The YAQ is a validated\nfood frequency questionnaire suitable for grade 5\nstudents. Information obtained from the YAQ\nallows calculation of student's intake of foods from\nrecommended food groups as well as energy and\nnutrient intakes. On the basis of the latter, we calcu-\nlated the Diet Quality Index--International (DQI-I),\na composite measure of diet quality.26 A composite\nmeasure of diet quality is preferable to multiple analy-\nses of nutrients and food groups.20,21 The DQI-I overall\nscore ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicat-\ning better diet quality. Further information on the\ndevelopment, validation, and scoring of the DQI-I is\nThe DQI-I has been demonstrated as an effective\nmeans of cross-national comparisons of diet quality.26\nHowever, it has been suggested that DQI-I scoring is\nmore in line with US recommendations, and therefore,\nDQI-I interpretations should be carefully interpreted in\nother countries where dietary recommendations are\nbased on existing food patterns that are different from\nthose in the United States.28 In order to provide a com-\nparative measure of overall diet quality, the Healthy\nEating Index (HEI), an alternative measure of diet qual-\nity, was also calculated based on YAQ responses.29\nIn addition to examining the association between\noverall diet quality and academic performance, it is\nalso valuable to determine which specific aspects of\ndiet quality are most important to academic per-\nformance. The DQI-I was chosen as it encompasses\nadequacy, variety, balance, and moderation as com-\nponents of diet quality and provides a score for each.26\nThe association between each of these DQI-I compo-\nnent scores and academic performance was examined\nindependently. The dietary adequacy component ofthe\nDQI-I represents the intake of foods and nutrients\nessential to a healthy diet such as fruits, vegetables,\ngrains, dietary fiber, protein, iron, calcium, and vitamin\nC. Intake of less healthful dietary components such as\nsaturated fat, salt, and ``empty calorie foods'' is reflected\nin the DQI-I moderation score. The DQI-I variety score\nreflects the diversity of foods in the diet, whereas over-\nall dietary balance, in terms of the proportion of energy\nintake from carbohydrate, fat, and protein, is indicated\nby the DQI-I balance score.26\nIncreased consumption of fruits and vegetables and\nmoderate fat intake are considered as indicative of\nhigh-quality diet and are emphasized as part of the\ntotal diet approach to improving nutrition among\nchildren.5,20 In order to determine their specific associ-\nations with academic performance, the number of serv-\nings of fruits and vegetables and percentage of caloric\nintake from dietary fat were examined independently.\nWith the exception of DQI-I balance component score,\nwhich had a skewed distribution, diet quality indicators\nwere considered as tertiles.\nAssessment of Academic Performance. The Ele-\nmentary Literacy Assessment is a standardized test\nadministered by the Nova Scotia Department of Edu-\ncation in the fall of 2003. The assessment was admin-\nistered approximately 6 months following the CLASS\nsurvey when participating students were enrolled in\ngrade 6. Completion of the assessment required stu-\ndents to read a variety of materials and answer writ-\nten questions based on those readings. Materials\nincluded a short story, information texts, a poem,\nand a visual media text. Reading and writing assess-\nments were marked centrally by a team of experi-\nenced grade 6 teachers under the supervision of the\nNova Scotia Department of Education. Both individual-\nand school-level test results were linked to the CLASS\ndatabase and were considered in the present study.\nData available from the Nova Scotia Department of\nEducation included individual results as a dichoto-\nmous outcome (pass/fail) for both the reading and the\nwriting assessments. At the student level, academic\nperformance was treated as a dichotomous variable\nwith good academic performance defined as passing\nboth the reading and the writing assessments and\npoor academic performance as failing either the read-\ning or the writing assessment or both. Of the 4966\ngrade 5 students remaining after exclusion for outly-\nwere successfully linked with the Elementary Literacy\nAssessment. At the school level, the percentage of\nstudents passing both assessments was a marker of\nperformance.\nAssessment of Other Covariates. At risk for over-\nweight and its more severe form, overweight, were\ndefined using the international body mass index cut-\noff points established for children and youth by the\nWorld Health Organization's International Obesity\nTask Force.30 The Nova Scotia public school system is\nadministered through 7 school boards, 1 of which did\nnot allow height and weight measurements to be taken.\nFor the 816 students without these measurements,\nweight status was considered as a missing category. So-\nciodemographic factors including student gender,\nurban or rural residency, parental marital status, edu-\ncation, and income were assessed using the question-\nnaire completed by parents of the participating\nstudents. Age was not considered as a covariate as the\nvast majority of grade 5 students were either 10 or 11\nyears old at the time they completed the CLASS survey.\nSchool neighborhood income was estimated by averag-\ning postal code\u00adlevel estimates of household income,\navailable through Census Canada, of students attend-\ning that particular school. School neighborhood aver-\nage income was divided into tertiles for analysis.\nData Analysis\nMultilevel logistic regression was used to examine\nthe associations between indicators of diet quality and\nacademic performance. Multilevel methods account\nfor the clustering of student's observations within\nschools and allow for quantification of second-level\nfactors such as neighborhood income and school-level\nacademic performance. Gender of the student and\nparental marital status, income, and educational\nattainment were considered as first-level covariates.\nOdds ratios and 95% confidence intervals are pre-\nsented for all analyses. Missing values for all covari-\nates were considered as separate categories, but their\nestimates are not presented here.\nOf the 5517 children who received parental con-\n(4.5%) students with outlying observations based on\nkcal/day in accordance with established recommenda-\ntions for outliers in nutritional research.31 Following\nestablished recommendations, all analyses involving\ndietary factors were adjusted for energy intake.31\nExamination of cross-level interactions revealed no\nsignificant effects. All analyses were performed using\nthe HLM6 (Scientific Software International, Inc.,\nLincolnwood, IL) software program.\nResponse Weights. Evaluation of nonresponse was\nconducted using postal code\u00adlevel estimates of house-\nhold income available through Census Canada for\nparticipating and nonparticipating grade 5 students.\nAs participation rates were slightly lower in residen-\ntial areas with lower postal code\u00adlevel estimates of\naverage household income, weighting factors were\nconstructed to adjust for this difference. These weight-\ning factors were used in all statistical analyses in or-\nder to adjust for nonresponse and provide provincial\nestimates.\nRESULTS\nInformation on the sociodemographic characteris-\ntics of study participants is presented in Table 1. Of\nthe 4589 students with complete information on diet\nor both of the components of the literacy assessment.\nTable 2 presents unadjusted results for DQI and other\ndietary indicators on school performance. The overall\naverage score of 62.4. Students reporting increased\ndiet quality were significantly less likely to fail the lit-\neracy assessment. Relative to students in the lowest\nDQI-I tertile, students in the second and third tertiles\nwere 26% and 41% less likely to fail. Variety and ade-\nquacy rather than moderation and balance were the\nDQI-I components most significantly associated with\nacademic performance. Students with an increased\nfruit and vegetable intake and lower caloric intake of\nfat were significantly less likely to fail the assessment.\nAnalysis of HEI, an alternative summary measure of\ndiet quality, yielded results similar to the association\nbetween DQI-I and academic performance.\nRelative to girls, boys were twice as likely to fail\ntheir literacy assessments (Table 3). Increased paren-\ntal income and educational attainment were sig-\nnificantly associated with decreased odds of poor\nacademic performance. Parental marital status was\nalso associated with academic performance: those\nchildren living in a lone-parent household had\nincreased odds of failing 1 or both assessments. Stu-\ndents attending school in an urban area were signifi-\ncantly less likely to fail than those living in rural\nareas. Additionally, school neighborhood income was\nfound to be significantly associated with academic\nperformance. Children living in neighborhoods with\nincreased average income levels were less likely to fail\n1 or both assessments. Meanwhile, children attending\nschools with a poorer average performance on the lit-\neracy assessment had significantly increased odds of\nfailing the assessment.\nAdjusting for differences with respect to gender,\nparental income and education, and school, students\nin the second and third DQI-I tertiles were, respec-\ntively, 18% and 30% less likely to fail the literacy\nassessment (Table 3). Parental education and income\nremained significantly associated with students'\nacademic performance. Overall school performance\ncontinued to be strongly associated with student's\nacademic performance. Urban or rural residence,\nweight status, and marital status of parents were not\nindependently associated with academic performance\nafter adjustment.\nTable 1.

Dietary adequacy and variety were identified\nas specific aspects of diet quality important to aca-\ndemic performance, thereby highlighting the value of\nconsuming a diverse selection of foods in order to\nmeet the recommended number of servings from each\nfood group. Additionally, fruit and vegetable con-\nsumption and dietary fat intake, 2 critical nutritional\nconcerns among children,5 were demonstrated as\nimportant to academic performance. The contribution\nof diet to academic performance is frequently stated;\nhowever, the focus of much of the research has been\non hunger, malnutrition, micronutrient deficiency,\nand the effects of breakfast on cognition. In separate\nreviews, Taras and Rampersaud conclude that the pro-\nvision of a healthy breakfast through school breakfast\nprograms is effective in improving cognitive function-\ning and academic performance, especially among\nundernourished populations.11,16 This study extends\ncurrent knowledge in this area by demonstrating the\nindependent importance of overall diet quality to aca-\ndemic performance and by identifying specific dietary\nfactorsthat contribute to the association between nutri-\ntion and academic performance. The consistency of this\nassociation across various indicators of diet quality\ngives emphasis to the importance of children's nutri-\ntion not only at breakfast but also throughout the day.\nAcademic performance influences future educa-\ntional attainment and income, which, in turn, affect\nTable 2.

Moreover, as increased levels of educational\nattainment and income facilitate increased under-\nstanding of nutrition messages and access to healthy\ntaged families are more likely to consume healthy diets.\nIncreased diet quality among these children will pro-\nvide further benefit to their academic performance and,\nin terms of health, contribute to healthy child develop-\nment, which influences health throughout the life\ncourse. In addition, healthy eating behaviors adopted\nin childhood are likely to continue through adoles-\ncence and adulthood and result in decreased risk of\nchronic diseases.34 Alternatively, children from socio-\neconomically disadvantaged backgrounds are more\nlikely to have poor diets and poor academic perfor-\nmance resulting in lower levels of educational attain-\nment and poorer health outcomes. Over time, the\ncyclical and compounded effects of socioeconomic fac-\ntors and diet quality on academic performance may\ncontribute to future increases in socioeconomic dispar-\nities in health. This research supports previous research\ndemonstrating that academic performance varies ac-\ncording to the student's gender and that male students\nare more likely to perform poorly in terms of literacy.4\nThis relationship has been observed as steady across\ndifferent levels of socioeconomic status.4\nIn light of the current childhood overweight epi-\ndemic and underlying poor dietary habits, prevention\nis a public health priority. Our findings suggest\nenhanced learning as an additional benefit of a\nhealthy diet in childhood. In a review of overweight and\nstudent school performance, Taras and Potts-Datema\nnote the consistency of the association between child-\nhood overweight and poorer levels of academic\nachievement.35 Clearly, overweight results from an\nimbalance between diet and physical and sedentary\nactivities, and thus, each of these lifestyle factors may\nhold an association with academic performance. How-\never, in the present study, weight status was not inde-\npendently associated with academic performance\nwhen the associations between diet quality, socioeco-\nnomic factors, and academic performance were consid-\nered. The lack of an independent association of weight\nstatus suggests that underlying diet quality may be\nlargely contributing to the previously observed associ-\nation between childhood overweight and academic\nachievement. School-based programs that promote\nhealthy eating and physical activity may therefore be\neffective in both preventing childhood overweight and\nimproving academic performance.25,36 Our findings\nfurther highlight the importance of promoting dietary\nadequacy and variety, increased fruit and vegetable\nintake, and moderate consumption of dietary fat as\nkey nutrition messages for school-based programs and\npolicies.\nThis study involved a population-based sample in\na relatively homogenous setting where almost all ele-\nmentary school children attend public schools that\nare similarly funded. The high response rate, relative\nto other school-based surveys requiring parental con-\nsent, and the use of a weighting factor in analyses to\nadjust for nonresponse bias should be considered as\nstrengths. Conversely, the rate of nonresponse does\nintroduce the potential for bias of results. Systematic\ndifferences between responders and nonresponders\nother than income may introduce bias, which would\nadversely affect the results and limit the generalizabil-\nity of the findings.\nOur analyses were adjusted for various confound-\ners, most importantly socioeconomic confounders;\nhowever, we may not exclude confounding by factors\nthat were not considered. The consistency of the rela-\ntionship between diet quality and academic perfor-\nmance across the various indices of diet quality is\na further strength of the present study. A variety of\noutcomes for academic performance have been exam-\nthat it linked nutritional information with census-level\ndata and standardized test results, minimizing bias in\nthe assessment of academic performance. However,\nthis study is limited by the extent to which 2 standard-\nized tests accurately measure academic performance.\nThe nutritional information was collected using the\nYAQ, a validated food frequency questionnaire suitable\nfor this age-group; however, self-administered re-\nsponses remain subject to error. Results of this study\nhighlight the associations between diet quality and\nacademic performance. However, the direction of\nthese associations cannot be ascertained from a cross-\nsectional study. Interpretation of the demonstrated\nassociation between diet quality and academic perfor-\nmance is based on the literature surrounding this asso-\nciation and related theory that led to the development\nof the research objectives. In order to demonstrate the\ntemporal sequence of the relationship, further longitu-\ndinal research examining diet quality and academic\nperformance would need to be conducted. These\nstrengths and limitations should be considered when\ninterpreting the present findings and making compar-\nisons with other studies.\nIn summary, we demonstrated that, above and\nbeyond socioeconomic factors, diet quality is impor-\ntant to academic performance. This association is\nimportant to children's future educational attainment\nand herewith future income, socioeconomic status,\nand health. These findings support the broader imple-\nmentation and investment in effective school nutri-\ntion programs25 that have the potential to improve\nstudent's diet quality, academic performance, and, over\nthe long term, their health.\nREFERENCES\n1.
