We hypothesized that risk\nfactor levels and clustering of risk factors would be\nprogressively elevated among unaffected women\ncompared with women with histories of gestational\ndiabetes and compared with women with diagnosed\ndiabetes. We also hypothesized that these associations\nwould be attenuated after adjustment for risk factors,\nparticularly for waist circumference.\nThe study population was a sample from the\nNHANES III, which was conducted using a multi-\nstage sampling design representative of the noninsti-\ntutionalized civilian population in the United States\nobjectives and data collection procedures of the\nNHANES III has been reported previously.9 Briefly,\neach NHANES wave consists of a detailed standard-\nized medical examination in a mobile examination\nunit and an interview to obtain information on socio-\ndemographic characteristics and cardiovascular risk\nfactors. Participants were selected at random for\nfasting glucose testing. The selection process was as\nfollows: Each household was randomly assigned to\neither a morning or an afternoon/evening examina-\ntion session. Plasma glucose values were not obtained\nfor people who did not participate in the examination\n(n811), were examined at home where fasting was\nnot required (n209), were examined in the after-\nnoon/evening (n311), had medical and safety rea-\nsons for exclusion (n10), became faint or ill (n2),\nrefused the venipuncture (n28), had unsuccessful\nvenipuncture (n27), fasted for less than 9 hours\nunknown fasting time (n89), and for other reasons\n(n137). Plasma glucose values were obtained after\npeople (77%). There were no statistically significant\ndifferences in a variety of sociodemographic and\nclinical variables between subjects assigned to the\nmorning session compared with subjects assigned to\nthe afternoon/evening session. In addition, for those\nin the morning session, there were no significant\ndifferences between subjects for whom plasma glu-\ncose values were obtained compared with those for\nwhom plasma glucose values were not obtained.\nThus, data from the subsamples are considered to\nrepresent the entire NHANES III sample.10 For the\npurposes of this report, we excluded women who\nwere nulliparous, pregnant at the time of data collec-\ntion, or had missing data regarding pregnancy status\nor previous diabetes or histories of gestational diabe-\ntes diagnoses, for a total sample of 4,631 women. This\nstudy was declared institutional review board exempt\nby the University of Michigan institutional review\nboard.\nParous women were stratified based on their\nhealth status at the time of the NHANES interview\nand categorized hierarchically based on their risk\nstrata as having diabetes, histories of gestational dia-\nbetes, or neither condition. Women were asked 1)\nHave you ever been told by a doctor that you have\ndiabetes or sugar diabetes? 2) Were you pregnant\nwhen you were told you had diabetes? 3) Other than\npregnancy, has a doctor ever told you that you have\ndiabetes or sugar diabetes? Based on these questions,\nwomen were classified as having diagnosed diabetes if\nthey reported a diagnosis of diabetes, either type 1\ndiabetes mellitus or type 2 diabetes mellitus, outside\nhaving histories of gestational diabetes without cur-\nrent diabetes if they reported having a diagnosis of\ndiabetes made during pregnancy and no diagnosed\ndiabetes at interview (n85). Women were classified\nas unaffected if they did not have histories of gesta-\ntional diabetes or diagnosed diabetes (n218). Be-\ncause we were focused on the risk factor profile of\nwomen with histories of gestational diabetes who had\nnot yet developed diabetes, women who had diabetes\nand histories of gestational diabetes (n29) were\nclassified as having diagnosed diabetes. In the\nNHANES III, it is not possible to combine partici-\npants with diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes for\nrisk analysis, because the denominator for the esti-\nmate of undiagnosed diabetes is different from the\none for the estimate of diagnosed diabetes; undiag-\nnosed diabetes was assessed in a subsample of nondi-\nabetic persons who were randomly assigned to a\nmorning fasting examination, whereas diagnosed di-\nabetes was assessed for the entire sample. Therefore,\nfor the purposes of this report, fasting glucose levels\nwere not used to identify women with diagnosed\ndiabetes.\nInformation on age, sex, race/ethnicity, family\nhistory of diabetes, income, smoking, and alcohol\nintake were collected by interview.9 Women were\nclassified as having a family history of diabetes if a\nfirst-degree relative (biologic parents or siblings) had\ndiabetes. The poverty index was calculated using\nself-reported family income and the poverty threshold\nvalue produced annually by the U.S. Census Bu-\nreau.12 Measurements of height, weight, and waist\ncircumference were performed in a standardized\nmanner, and body mass index (BMI) was calculated\nas weight in kilograms divided by height in meters\nsquared. Leg length, a measure of early life socioeco-\n876 Kim et al Risk Profile Among Women With Histories of GDM OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY\nnomic deprivation, was calculated by subtracting\nsitting height from standing height.13,14 A history of\ncardiovascular events was determined if women an-\nswered \"yes\" to any of the following questions: 1) Has\na doctor ever told you that you had a heart attack? 2)\nHas a doctor ever told you that you had a stroke? 3)\nHas a doctor ever told you that you had congestive\nheart failure?\nWe defined risk factors for cardiovascular disease\nusing the Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines.15\nCardiovascular risk factors included self-report of the\nfollowing risk factors: age older than 55 years; family\nhistory of cardiovascular disease; current cigarette\nsmoking; and presence of diabetes, hypertension, or\ndyslipidemia. Family history of cardiovascular disease\nwas defined as a first-degree male relative with car-\ndiovascular disease aged younger than 55 years or a\nfirst-degree female relative with cardiovascular dis-\nease at younger than 65 years. Hypertension was\ndefined as a systolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg or\nmore or diastolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg or more\nupon examination, or participant report of physician-\ndiagnosed hypertension on at least two occasions with\ncurrent use of antihypertensive medication. Dyslipi-\ndemia was defined as a total cholesterol 240 mg/dL or\nmore or participant report of physician-diagnosed\ndyslipidemia that was currently treated with lifestyle\nmodification or medication.\nMetabolic syndrome was defined as the presence\nof three or more of any of the following components:\nwaist circumference 35 inches or more; systolic blood\npressure 130 mm Hg or more or diastolic blood\npressure 85 mm Hg or more; fasting blood glucose\nhigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (HDL) 50\nmg/dL or more (1.29 mmol/L or more); and total\nor more).16 If participants used hypertensive medica-\ntion or statin medication, they were classified as\nhaving elevated blood pressure or dyslipidemia, re-\nspectively. Newer criteria for metabolic syndrome use\nthe fasting blood glucose cutoff of 100 mg/dL, but we\nused the older definition because this was the one in\nuse when the data were collected. Levels of low-\ndensity lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides,\ninsulin, and glucose were estimated using the morn-\ning fasting sample of participants; insulin and glucose\nwere not measured on persons with diagnosed diabe-\ntes who were on insulin therapy. Albuminuria is\nexpressed as milligrams per gram of creatinine: nor-\nmal (less than 30 mg/g creatinine), microalbuminuria\nAll analyses accounted for the complex, multi-\nstage, stratified, cluster-sampling design of NHANES\nIII by using sample weights, strata, and primary\nsampling units provided by the survey designer as\npart of the public data. First, we compared unaffected\nwomen, women with histories of gestational diabetes,\nand women with diagnosed diabetes across exposure\nand outcome variables. For continuous variables, we\nconducted tests of trend using the Fisher-Yates test,\nand for categorical variables, we conducted 2 tests. In\nmultivariable models, we calculated predicted mar-\nginal probabilities and 95% confidence intervals for\nlevels of individual cardiovascular risk factors and\nmetabolic syndrome components.18\nMultivariable models were constructed in several\nstages. The first set of models (Model 1) adjusted for\nage, race/ethnicity, family history of diabetes, ciga-\nrette smoking, and alcohol intake. Next, we added\nwaist circumference, a measure of central obesity\n(Model 2). The third set of models also adjusted for\nself-reported cardiovascular disease (Model 3). The\nnext model also adjusted for leg length (Model 4). The\nlast model also adjusted for the poverty-index ratio as\na measure of current, rather than early-life, socioeco-\nnomic deprivation (Model 5). Due to the fact that\nboth leg length and education are measures of early-\nlife deprivation,13,14 we used leg length rather than\neducation in the models.\nWe also constructed multivariable models for the\npresence of metabolic syndrome (yes/no), defined as\nthe presence of three or more metabolic syndrome\ncomponents, as well as adjusted models for the pres-\nence of three or more cardiovascular risk factors.\nAdjusted predicted marginal probabilities were esti-\nmated from each model and used to calculate ad-\njusted prevalence ratios for the histories of gestational\ndiabetes and diagnosed diabetes groups (referent\ngroup, unaffected women). Due to the small number\nof cardiovascular events, we did not examine actual\ncardiovascular events as an outcome. The models\nexamining metabolic syndrome did not additionally\nadjust for waist circumference, because these were\nalready included in the definition of metabolic syn-\ndrome. Statistical analyses were conducted using\nSUDAAN 9.0 (SUDAAN, Research Triangle Insti-\ntute, NC) software.\nRESULTS\nThe characteristics of women in our sample are\nillustrated in the first section of Table 1. Women with\ndiagnosed diabetes were significantly older than\nwomen with histories of gestational diabetes or unaf-\nfected women and were more likely to report African-\nAmerican or non-Hispanic African-American race/\nethnicity, family history of diabetes, the least\nfavorable poverty to income ratios, the fewest number\nof alcoholic drinks per day, and the greatest waist\ncircumferences. Unaffected women tended to have\nthe longest leg length and women with histories of\ngestational diabetes more often tended to be current\nsmokers, but these associations were not significant.\nIn unadjusted comparisons, women with diag-\nnosed diabetes had worsened levels of cardiovascular\nand metabolic syndrome factors than unaffected\nwomen (Table 2). In comparison, differences between\nwomen with histories of gestational diabetes and\nunaffected women were less marked. Women with\nhistories of gestational diabetes actually had more\nfavorable cholesterol subtypes and blood pressure\nlevels than unaffected women. The exceptions were\nfasting insulin and glucose levels. Fasting insulin and\nglucose did increase across categories of glucose\nintolerance (Table 2). When we examined the num-\nber of metabolic syndrome components or cardiovas-\ncular risk factors, which dichotomized risk factor\nlevels, the number of components was greatest in\nwomen with diagnosed diabetes, followed by women\nwith histories of gestational diabetes. Self-reported\ncardiovascular was uncommon, reported in 6.7%\n(n18) of women with diagnosed diabetes, 0.7%\n(n2) of women with histories of gestational diabetes,\nWhen we adjusted for patient covariates, the largest\ndifferences were again seen between women with diag-\nnosed diabetes and other groups (Table 3). After adjust-\nment for age, race/ethnicity, family history of diabetes,\ncigarette smoking, and alcohol intake (Table 3, Model\n1), women with diagnosed diabetes had similar risk\nfactor patterns compared with unadjusted analyses.\nWomen with diagnosed diabetes had poorer LDL,\nHDL, total cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, insulin,\nglucose, and microalbumin levels than unaffected\nwomen. The exception to this pattern was that uric acid\nlevels, triglyceride levels, and diastolic blood pressure\nlevels no longer differed significantly. Women with\ndiagnosed diabetes were also more likely to have met-\nabolic syndrome and to have three or more cardiovas-\ncular risk factors than unaffected women. Women with\ndiagnosed diabetes also had poorer HDL and total\ncholesterol, fasting glucose, and microalbuminuria than\nwomen with histories of gestational diabetes.\nAfter adjustment (Table 3, Model 1), women with\nhistories of gestational diabetes still tended to have\nmore favorable risk factor levels compared with un-\naffected women, although these comparisons were\nnot significant. Women with histories of gestational\ndiabetes had a similar chance of having metabolic\nsyndrome and of having three or more cardiovascular\nrisk factors as unaffected women.\nAfter additional adjustment for waist circumfer-\nence (Model 2), women with diagnosed diabetes no\nTable 1.

Women with diabetes were still more likely\nthan unaffected women to have three or more cardio-\nvascular risk factors compared with unaffected\nwomen. After additional adjustment for waist circum-\nference (Model 2), women with diagnosed diabetes\nstill had worsened microalbuminuria, insulin, glucose,\nand total cholesterol compared with women with\nhistories of gestational diabetes. After adjustment for\nwaist circumference, women with histories of gesta-\ntional diabetes were still more likely to have three or\nmore cardiovascular risk factors compared with unaf-\nfected women. The addition of waist circumference to\ndemographic risk factors (Model 2) explained a sig-\nnificantly greater proportion of variance than demo-\ngraphic factors alone (Model 1). When waist circum-\nference was not included as an adjuster, as was the\ncase when metabolic syndrome was the outcome, the R2\nfor multivariable models was much lower than the R2\nfor the cardiovascular models where the outcome was\nalso dichotomous.\nFurther adjustment for cardiovascular, leg length,\nand poverty-index ratio did not change this pattern\nfor individual cardiovascular risk factors or for the\nmetabolic syndrome and number of cardiovascular\nrisk factors (results not shown). Of note, the additional\nproportion of variance or the increase in R2 in Models\n3, 4, and 5 tended to be slight compared with Models\n1 and 2. In other words, models adjusting for demo-\ngraphic factors, behavioral factors, and waist circum-\nference explained similar variance to models that also\nadjusted for cardiovascular, leg length, and poverty-\nindex ratio. This may be because the number of\ncardiovascular events was low and only small differ-\nences in leg length were observed, and/or the effects\nof these factors were mediated through others.\nIn sensitivity analyses, we substituted BMI for\nwaist circumference to determine if this increased the\nexplained variance of the model or otherwise\nchanged point estimates. We found that these BMI\nmodels had slightly lower R2 than models with waist\nTable 2.

Therefore, we report\nresults with waist circumference. Relatively few\nwomen had microalbuminuria levels that were more\nthan 30 micrograms/g, so in multivariable models,\nthe urine microalbuminuria/creatinine was dichoto-\nmized as less than 30 micrograms/g compared with\nmore than 30 micrograms/g and the results expressed\nin predicted marginal probabilities. We examined\nwhether using the newer cutoff of FPG100 mg/dL\naffected the metabolic syndrome definition; propor-\ntions were not significantly different (results not\nshown). Finally, among women classified as having\nhistories of gestational diabetes, eight (9.4%) had\nfasting glucose levels more than 126 mg/dL, and\namong women classified as unaffected by either his-\ntories of gestational diabetes or diagnosed diabetes, 50\nmg/dL. In a sensitivity analysis, we examined only\nwomen who had a fasting glucose as well as fasting\ndid not alter our pattern of effects, so the larger\nsample is included in this report.\nDISCUSSION\nThis cross-sectional study of the female population of\nthe United States suggests that women with histories\nof gestational diabetes who have not developed diag-\nnosed diabetes had similar levels of each metabolic\nsyndrome factor and each cardiovascular risk factor\ncompared with unaffected women, with the exception\nof insulin and glucose levels. When factors were\ndichotomized, women with histories of gestational\ndiabetes only had only a slightly greater number of\nmetabolic syndrome components and cardiovascular\nrisk factors than unaffected women. In contrast,\nwomen with diagnosed diabetes had a significantly\nworsened profile than other women.\nIn a cross-sectional analysis of the Genetics of\nNon\u00adInsulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (GENNID)\nstudy, Carr and colleagues8 found that women with\nhistories of gestational diabetes were more likely to\nhave metabolic syndrome and to experience cardio-\nvascular events than women without histories of\ngestational diabetes, and moreover, that these cardio-\nvascular events occurred at a younger age. In their\nstudy, the definitions of histories of gestational diabe-\ntes and diagnosed diabetes were not mutually exclu-\nsive, so that more than 90% of women with histories\nof gestational diabetes had developed diabetes, and\n63% of the women without histories of gestational\ndiabetes had developed diabetes. The high preva-\nlence of diabetes was presumably due to the study\nrequirement that at least two first-degree relatives be\naffected by diabetes. Other studies have documented\nthe presence of metabolic syndrome among women\nwith histories of gestational diabetes as well.5,19,20 Our\nresults may have differed from these studies for\nseveral reasons. Carr and colleagues examined a\npopulation at extremely high risk for diabetes,\nwhereas we examined a population-based sample.\nSimilarly, for other hospital-based analyses, it is pos-\nsible that the women with histories of gestational\ndiabetes who return for follow-up represent a higher-\nrisk cohort, perhaps having greater glucose dysregu-\nlation during pregnancy. Second, we surmise that\nwomen with histories of gestational diabetes at highest\nrisk for diabetes (and other risk factors) may have\nalready developed the condition before their\nNHANES interview, and thus only women at lower\nrisk for diabetes (and other risk factors) remain in the\nhistories of gestational diabetes sample. Had we been\nable to examine women closer to delivery, before\nanyone in the cohort developed diabetes, we might\nhave detected greater differences in cardiovascular\nrisk factors or metabolic syndrome components.4\nThe women with histories of gestational diabetes\nin our study may have fairly benign risk factor profiles\nfor reasons other than their lack of development of\ndiabetes. It is possible that inadequate time has\nelapsed to allow progression of their profiles. How-\never, after we adjusted for age, the relationship was\nnot changed. In addition, women with histories of\ngestational diabetes had similar leg length to women\nwith diagnosed diabetes, suggesting that they had\nexperienced similar deprivation in early life. Alterna-\ntively, women with histories of gestational diabetes\nwho do not develop diagnosed diabetes may be\nhealthier than women with histories of gestational\ndiabetes who do develop diagnosed diabetes, or\nwomen with histories of gestational diabetes may\nhave had their risks of early life deprivation modified\nby improved circumstances in later life.21 Along these\nlines, women with histories of gestational diabetes\nmay have adopted lifestyle changes that prevent them\nfrom developing diabetes and also improved their\ncardiovascular risk profile. However, in other popu-\nlation-based surveys, the physical activity level and\ndietary intake of women with histories of gestational\ndiabetes were poor.22\nThe addition of waist circumference to the mul-\ntivariable models notably increased the proportion of\nvariance in cardiovascular risk factor levels explained\nby the models, beyond the variance explained by\ndemographic factors and behavioral factors such as\nalcohol intake. Greater waist circumference ac-\ncounted for differences in HDL cholesterol and blood\npressure levels between women with diabetes com-\npared with unaffected women and women with dia-\nbetes compared with women with histories of gesta-\ntional diabetes, although it did not account for\ndifferences in glucose and insulin. Waist circumfer-\nence and waist\u00adhip ratio are commonly used mea-\nsures of central obesity,23 and the importance of\ncentral obesity as an independent predictor of cardio-\nvascular risk as well as mortality has been recognized\nin prospective cohort studies in women.24,25 Our\nfindings about the poor cardiovascular risk factor\nprofiles of women with diabetes are similar to those of\nprevious studies, particularly in NHANES.26,27\nThe study has several limitations. NHANES is\ncross-sectional, and observations regarding levels of\nmetabolic syndrome components or cardiovascular risk\nfactors across worsening glucose intolerance states do\nnot necessarily reflect disease progression in individuals.\nAs mentioned earlier, we deliberately selected healthier\npopulations by examining women who had not devel-\noped diabetes, so our results do not apply to the women\nwith histories of gestational diabetes who develop dia-\nbetes. We included approximately 90 women with\nhistories of gestational diabetes, comparable to others'\nreports, and although NHANES can distinguish be-\ntween women with histories of gestational diabetes and\nwomen with histories of gestational diabetes and diag-\nnosed diabetes, the numbers of women in these sub-\ngroups were too few to allow comparisons.\nIn conclusion, women with histories of gesta-\ntional diabetes may have elevated cardiovascular risk,\nbut this risk may be most evident through their risk\nfor diagnosed diabetes. Although we expected to see\ngreater metabolic dysfunction in women with histo-\nries of gestational diabetes, this may represent a\ngreater opportunity for prevention of future glucose\nintolerance and associated metabolic dysfunction.\nPostpartum screening after delivery for glucose intol-\nerance and diabetes prevention interventions may\nalso be the most effective measures for lowering of\ncardiovascular risk.\nREFERENCES\n1.
