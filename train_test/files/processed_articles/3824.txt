    "abstract": "Abstract\nWithin the social sciences, there is a wealth of literature that examines the challenges and ethical dilemmas encountered\nby researchers in conceptualising, conducting and understanding their research. In this article, we share our reflections on\nexperiences we encountered carrying out a qualitative evaluation of a prison gardening intervention with male substance\nmisusing prisoners. Our aim is to suggest that there is much we can gain when researchers engage in a process of reflexivity,\nwhich includes consideration to the intersection of identity of the researcher, the researched and the forces of various kinds,\noperating upon and within such situations. As such, here we share our fieldwork experiences and shed light on how, for us,\nthe evaluation was a subjective, power-laden, emotional, embodied experience. We highlight how a human geographer and\na sociologist working as part of a multidisciplinary evaluation team encountered issues associated with choices in terms of\nhow we conduct our work, the emotional labour expended and how we had to assume both chosen and imposed identities.\nWe have been challenged to consider and reflect upon aspects of gender, class, age and professional status throughout our\nresearch experience, with the `researched' and between the `researchers'. Finally, we suggest that embarking on qualitative\nresearch in a prison setting is an outcome of complex negotiations, but in theorising our subjectivities is a means of illuminating\nissues that often remain invisible within prison research.\n",

This is because there are a myriad of ways in which\nresearchers are present and connected to the research they\nundertake. This article illuminates the various ways in which\nthe researchers' identities, whether externally or internally\ninscribed, intersect with the evaluation context, participants\nand subject under investigation. Our article contributes to the\ngrowing body of research which recognises the importance of\npositionality in prison research.\nPositionality\nOver the past 12months, we (Lizzi and Geraldine) have been\npart of a multidisciplinary team from Coventry University\nevaluating a horticultural intervention (the Master Gardener\nProgramme (MGP)) at HM Prison Rye Hill (see Brown et al.,\n2015). Over this period, we spent, in total, an estimated\n152hours in the field engaging both formally and informally\nwith participants (and staff) on the MGP allowing us to spend\ntime working alongside participants, engage in conversations\nwith participants and staff and gaining an insight about other\nparts of the prison estate (such as visiting the recovery wing,\nindustries and staff canteen). Consequently, there is a core eth-\nnographic dimension to our evaluation in which we used a\nvariety of research tools to capture participants'experiences of\nthe MGP and over the evaluation period we collected a wide\nrange of data (detailed in the `Methodological approach' sec-\ntion) month by month. As noted by Jewkes (2012), `a small\nminority of ethnographers acknowledge the emotional content\nof prison studies' (p. 63). Here, we argue that the knowledge\nwe produce is enhanced by having time to gain an understand-\ning of the context in which the evaluation was undertaken, get-\nting to know the participants and staff delivering the\nprogramme was an insightful experience. Our approach ena-\nbled us to situate ourselves in this process, which has meth-\nodological and epistemological implications such as how\nemotions, memory and subjectivities became entangled within\nWorking in a prison setting\nThe prison in which the research took place is a private training\nprison which opened in 2001 and is run by G4S, a leading\nglobal integrated security company (www.g4s.com). At the\nstart of the evaluation, the prison was designated as a category\n`B'training prison holding 664 sentenced male adults. The sen-\ntence requirement at HMP Rye Hill (2014) is for prisoners who\nreceivemorethan4yearswith18monthslefttoserve.However,\nat the midpoint of the evaluation, the prison was designated as\none of eight prisons in England and Wales to undertake a re-\nroll1 of its population, and since Spring 2014, the prison has\nhoused men incarcerated for a sex related offence. Today, the\nprison remains a training prison with a capacity of 635 and acts\n`as a national resource for sentenced male adults who have\nbeen convicted of a current or previous sex offence(s)' (www.\nhmpryehill.co.uk) and who have been sentenced to over 4years\nand have at least 12months left to serve on their sentence.\nThe evaluation took place between August 2013 and\nDecember 2014. At the start of our evaluation, the prison was\nin the process of introducing a new approach to supporting\nprisoners with a substance misuse issue. A key part of this\nincluded the development of a recovery wing alongside a wider\nsuite of substance misuse programmes. In Phase 1 of our evalu-\nation, we spent 6months with a group of `mainstream' prison-\ners, and due to the re-roll of the prison to a vulnerable persons\n(VP) population, Phase 2, the final 6months of the evaluation\nwas undertaken with sex offenders.All participants included in\nour evaluation experienced substance misuse and were\nrecruited on the garden from the dedicated recovery wing; the\ngarden was part of a wider suite of programmes provided and\nbeing developed by the substance misuse team.\nAs in the work of Phillips and Earle (2010), our field\nnotes, and the conversations we have had about our study,\nreveal an aspect of the research that often remains hidden in\nrelation to how we felt about the MGP, participants, staff in\nthe prison setting and generally about our role in conducting\nthis study. Indeed, our notes and conversation often had an\nemotional or subjective dimension. This enables us, like\nPhillips and Earle, to focus attention on how factors such as\ngender, `race' and class unravelled during the process and\nour fieldwork experiences. However, our reflection here also\nincludes how perceptions associated with age and experience\nalso impacted fieldwork experiences:\nLizzi: I am a Senior Research Assistant with a research\nbackground in human geography and 6\nyears' experi-\nence of working in the academy. I have worked on many\nagri-food-related projects, including in the area of food\ngrowing and the social and community aspect of this.\nPrior to this evaluation, I had no experience of working\nin prisons; my fieldwork experiences have involved\nworking with people around food growing spaces in the\nUnited Kingdom and internationally. My part-time PhD\nfieldwork focused particularly on food growing spaces\non housing estates and disadvantaged areas in London\nwhere I critically sought to understand the broader\nexperiences and motivations of citizens from a critical\nrealist perspective. I am a White, British female from a\nprofessional family. As someone who became disen-\ngaged with school and particularly in subjects that did\nnot interest me, my need to work in a job that was mean-\ningful and captivating coupled with work experience at\na research institute gave me a concern for real world,\npractical research which contributes towards `making\na difference'. The working-class area of the country\nwhere I went to school comprised a host of socio-\neconomic issues which may have prompted my interest\nin undertaking a human geography degree and MSc. in\nurban regeneration research and policy. My Christian\nfaith (not one I grew up with) is central to my identity\nand as such is of key importance to my reflections\naround my research experience.\nBrown and Bos 3\nGeraldine: I am an experienced researcher (albeit quite\njunior in the academic hierarchy), and I have been\ninvolved in social research (initially as a Research\nAssistant and now as a Research Fellow) for over 15years.\nMy academic background is in sociology and social pol-\nicy, and the research I have conducted has largely focused\non exploring issues that have been identified as dispropor-\ntionately negatively impacting groups identified within\nUK policy as `excluded', `marginalised', `disadvantaged'\nand more recently categorised as `vulnerable'. Hence, this\nwork has included research with teenage parents, Black\nand minority ethnic communities, women, older people\nand offenders. I am an unmarried mother from African\nCaribbean descent and the first of my siblings to attend\nHigher Education. I was born and grew up in inner city\nBirmingham, which is one of the United Kingdom's larg-\nest metropolitan cities. As a Black female researcher, I\noften find myself navigating between two worlds \u00ad as a\nBlack woman working and researching in what remains a\nWhite-dominated institution and as a woman who lives in\nand is part of a wider Black community. This is challeng-\ning as I am continually reminded of how my background,\ngender and racial identity mediate the research process in\ndiverse ways (Brown, 2015). As a Black feminist, there is\na political goal that underpins much of the research I have\nundertaken in that my aim is to `allow space for groups\nwho are often absent from debates to be included', pro-\nviding an opportunity to give voice to those who have\nbeen silenced (Hill Collins, 1990: xiv). This reflects how\nfor me the personal is a political act (Mills, 1959). I hope\nto undertake research that is not merely an attempt to gen-\nerate new intellectual insights as while this is important,\nfundamental to the research I undertake is for my work to\nmake a difference in the lives of those I engage in the\nprocess (see Letherby and Bywaters, 2007).\nCohen and Taylor (1981) describe prison as places of\nintensely managed emotions where institutional interests in\nformal order coincide and conflict with the raw exigencies of\nontological survival in an alien and austere environment.\nConsequently, the stress and anxiety imposed by closed and\ncrowded living conditions, and limited privacy have to be\nendured daily by prisoners. It is therefore to be expected that\nanxiety defences are mutually at play for both researchers\nentering this world from the relative comforts of life outside\nand prisoners themselves:\nLizzi: My previous personal and research experiences\nundertaken had not prepared me for research in prisons. In\nall honesty, I was quite apprehensive about going in to\nthis space and there was an element of fear in terms of not\nbeing able to relate to the participants and a fear of being\n`rejected'. However, as Geraldine was confident about the\nprocess, I felt comfortable placing my trust in her.\nAlthough I felt the need to `find a place' in this new\nresearch environment as discussed by Warren (1988, cited\nin Jewkes, 2012), working as part of a team made this\nprocess somewhat easier. Warren suggests that finding `a\nplace' can be\ntricky for the female ethnographer within a strange culture ...\nbecause not only does she have to conform to assumptions about\nwomen being unchallenging and compliant but she must also be\nseen to be operating successfully in a male-dominated public\nOur gender was not a barrier to working with the partici-\npants, but for me age, or how I felt others perceived this, was.\nI knew Geraldine would be great at working with the guys,\nwhich comforted me but also made me question my ability.\nHowever, being more reserved, introverted and somewhat\nshy in an unfamiliar environment, I was nervous about not\nknowing what would happen. Going into any unfamiliar set-\nting, in an intense manner (for the whole day in a confined\nspace) with a group of males (who I had never met before)\nwould have given me some degree of apprehension, of which\nthe `offender' status added to. The (un)predictability of the\nparticipants was something I was initially cautious of, which\nmay have been to do with perceptions around their substance\nmisuse issues. The fact that we would be entering their space\nas outsiders \u00ad in the whole sense of the meaning \u00ad outside to\nthe regime, outside of their cultural norms \u00ad meant that I did\nnot know how I should act, which perhaps reflected my level\nof research experience generally (and did make me self-\nreflect, recognising the importance of the experience for\nresearchers). As such, I can concur that as a `novice prison\nresearcher', I experienced anxiety about entering the field\nalthough not with observing and talking to the participants on\na one-to-one basis, as Jewkes (2012) asserts. This is due to the\nspace of the garden and the methodological approach we took\nin our evaluation, which moved beyond the formal researcher\u00ad\nparticipant interview. I did, at the start of the visits, observe\nGeraldine's behaviour and mirrored it to a certain extent \u00ad\ninformally and somewhat unconsciously knowing what was\n`acceptable' and the kind of things to ask, talk about, and so\non. I was surprised and comforted at how polite, welcoming,\nwarm, friendly and sensitive in tune with their emotions the\nparticipants were, which made our prison visits enjoyable.\nGeraldine and I became a familiar part of the garden space,\nwhich allowed for a closeness to the participants (and the gar-\nden) over a period of time.\nI felt as though for me, prisons were a forgotten place and\nprisoners were a forgotten people. I was never made to think\nabout prisons or prisoners and therefore I had a very limited\nknowledge or connection to the prison system. I am reminded\nof a friend \u00ad before the prison evaluation, Tom* who as well\nas experiencing quite severe mental health problems, was\nalso tagged. Although this gave me a little insight and prepa-\nration for the prison, it enabled me to consider Tom's\ncircumstances and complex needs. This project along with\n*indicates use of a pseudonym\n4 Methodological Innovations\nother events has taken me on a complex and unforgettable\njourney shaping my inseparable personal (Christian) and\nprofessional values:\nGeraldine: I was excited about the opportunity of working\non this project. I have had some previous experience of\nresearching in a prison environment and also had some\npersonal experiences in terms of friends and family mem-\nbers who had come to the attention of the UK Criminal\nJustice System. At the point of starting this project, one of\nmy oldest friends was coming to the end of a 5-year prison\nsentence and I had visited him on a number of occasions\nso I had some understanding of the prison regime. This is\nnot to suggest that I was not initially nervous about doing\nthis work, but my nervousness was not associated with the\nthought of working with prisoners. If I am honest, I was a\nlittle more anxious about the relationship I would have\nwith those employed to work in the prison. Indeed, I\nunderstand what Phillips (2010) means when she writes\nabout the marginalising experiences often reported in\naccounts of empirical research carried out by Black and\nminority and female researchers. Phillips accepts that this\nundoubtedly holds epistemological value but simultane-\nously is evidence of how `race', gender and class remain\ncentral to how individuals experience the social word.\nFurthermore, fully aware that having some understanding\nand knowledge about prison through knowing friends and\nfamily members who had been incarcerated did not auto-\nmatically designate me as an insider. Like Lizzi, I too rec-\nognised my outsider identity. However, being an outsider\nfor me as a Black woman working in the Academy is not\nunusual. There are numerous occasions that working in\nthe academy, for me, equates to feelings like being a body\nout of place (Mirza, 2006) as I am often required to enter\nplaces and spaces in which my racial identity positions\nme as an outsider. For me, my anxiety similar to that noted\nby Phillips (Phillips and Earle, 2010) related to the uneas-\niness I perceived I would encounter from those working\nwithin the institution in which I would be undertaking this\nwork.\nI was aware that Jane was apprehensive at the start of the\nproject as she had spoken to me about her feelings prior to\nstarting. I had tried to reassure her that we were a team and we\nwould conduct the data collection together. As a Principal\nInvestigator (PI), I explained that I was responsible for ensur-\ning her safety and that meant she would not be expected to\nwork alone with prisoners, we would ensure that we had\nopportunity to share how we were feeling about the work and\nshe could talk to me about any concerns she may have; I\nwould support her in any way I could. The first fieldwork date\nwas set by the commissioners while I was on annual leave. I\nhad tried to get the date changed or suggested that another\nsenior member of the team attend the meeting, but was told in\nno uncertain terms that as I was PI on the project it was\npreferred that I attend the initial meeting with the evaluation\nparticipants. Despite explaining that I would be in Singapore\nand returning to the United Kingdom the morning of the visit,\nthe date remained the same alongside the expectation that I\nattend.After a 13-hour flight, I jumped on a train from London\nHeathrow to Coventry and was picked up by a member of the\nteam and driven to the prison to conduct the research team's\nintroduction to participants and participants' introduction to\nthe evaluation. On reflection, it is possible to see the very\ninsistence that I attend and my acquiescence to this request as\nan example of an internal fear and how our own racial posi-\ntioning (and awareness thereof) informs how we make sense\nof and react in certain situations (Rollock, 2012).\nMethodological approach\nThe decision to primarily adopt a number of qualitative\nmethods for our evaluation of the MGP is in acknowledge-\nment of the limitations associated with research designed to\nuncover fixed patterns. A mixed-method approach drawing\non a range of qualitative tools is a recognition that human\nbehaviour is complex and fluid, and there are factors that are\noften overlooked in research that primarily focuses on\nuncovering fixed patterns alone. As we detail below, while\nthe aim of the MGP was to work with substance misusing\noffenders, these prisoners were diverse in terms of age, eth-\nnicity, drugs used, educational background, length of offence\nand offences perpetrated. As such, it was decided that an\nappropriate way of understanding the relationship between\nthe MGP and its impact was to design an evaluation that was\nflexible and focus on the process, capture small scale situa-\ntions, stresses, diversity and variability in terms of the range\nof perspectives held by participants engaging in the pro-\ngramme and key stakeholders involved. However, while the\nprimary approach to the evaluation rested on using a range of\nqualitative methods, the evaluation was also informed by a\nsurvey administered to staff working at the prison but who\nhad no direct input to the gardening intervention. Data were\nalso collected from participants' families in survey form and\nin addition, the research team carried out an analysis of data\nthat were routinely collected by the prison. Demographic\ndata were also collected from participants via a short survey.\nTables 1 and 2 demonstrate the type and amount of data col-\nlected during Phases 1 and 2 of the evaluation from pro-\ngramme participants and programme-related personal (see\nTable 3 in Appendix 1 for a description of the tools used).\nPhase 1 data were collected from September 2013 to March\nTherefore, in total, the research team has\n\u00b7\nhours conducting participant\nobservations;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Facilitated three focus groups;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Conducted seven staff interviews;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Collected 50 completed staff feedback forms;\nBrown and Bos 5\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Gathered 58 completed reflective diaries, 46 com-\npleted circles of change, 25 demographic surveys;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Analysed three portfolios;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Collected four family surveys.\nReflexivity: understanding the\nrelationship between self and `others'\nPhillips and Earle (2010) argue that the attraction of reflex-\nivity lies not in confessional or testimonial exhortation but\nin its capacity to acknowledge researchers as active partici-\npants whose identities, like those of research subjects, may\nbe variously shaped by powerful hierarchies of race/ethnic-\nity, gender and class. Furthermore, consideration of such\ndynamics enables us to see how our own positions and\ninterests are, sometimes discretely, imposed throughout the\nresearch process, influencing the questions we ask, the ones\nwe do not, who we interview and who we do not, how we\ninterview, how we listen and how we do not and ultimately\nhow we understand (Hertz, 1997). For this reason, they\nforesee reflexivity as providing a guide to sociological\npractice somewhat immunized against `the single, central,\ndominant ... quasi-divine, point of view that is all too eas-\nLizzi: I was aware that on first impressions, I felt a dif-\nferent age and background from the group. This with\nthe mainstream prisoners was a point of conversation,\nwith them asking my age, where I was from, how I grew\nup and where I did my food shopping. One of the guys\nwas curious about my upbringing and asked whether I\ngrew up on an estate; the same participant also asked\nwhether I shopped at Waitrose alluding to me being\nposh (neither of which was true!). I welcomed this dis-\ncussion as it allowed me to have some further social\ninteraction and facilitated a bond with the group.\nAdditionally, I was aware of how I feel others have\nperceived me in the past, which I brought with me to the\nprison project. I was conscious of my age, demeanour,\npersonality traits and professional position. Being more\nof an introvert who prefers to `blend in' to group set-\ntings contributed towards the anxiety I initially experi-\nenced. One point to note is that upon reflection, it is\nlikely I would have felt anxious in any group setting at\nfirst. I initially tried the approach of blending in which\nwas not too easy given the setting. I actively tried to\nengage in group discussions by taking notes and show-\ning active listening skills \u00ad an acceptable tactic in the\nacademe. However, this opened the perception of me as\nsomeone in authority quietly observing, watching and\nassessing. Although I was observing and watching, this\nwas my role during the visits \u00ad a subordinate role to\nGeraldine's which involved the more challenging task\nof facilitating the group, ensuring data were collected as\nwell as their engagement with the evaluation. This made\nme further reflect on myself, and my behaviour and\nactually made me laugh as the perceptions of the par-\nticipants was quite opposite to my reality. It forced me\nto question my positionality.\nThis sense of power the participants instilled in me was\nnot something I had experienced before and made me feel\nuncomfortable. This experience was more apparent when\nsupporting Geraldine with a focus group as part of another\nproject (due to the absence of one of the research teams on\nthe project). I was the only White person in the room and the\nonly female apart from Geraldine; my role was to note-take\nand to ensure we obtained completed consent forms. I took\nmy place around the table, tried my strategy of blending in\nthrough keeping quiet and making notes (as I had limited\noverview of the project and experiences of participants).\nThis however triggered the participants to question my posi-\ntion, asking whether I was Geraldine's boss. Again, this per-\nception of me, being so far from my reality where I have felt\nTable 1.

MG programme related personal.\nSemi-structured\ninterviews\nFocus group Staff survey Family survey Observations\nMG: The Master Gardener Programme.\naThe low rate of survey completed in Phase 2 was related to the re-roll.\n6 Methodological Innovations\njunior, young and inexperienced, not only made me feel\nextremely awkward but also led me to consider my position-\nality and how others perceive me (which may be the opposite\nto how I perceive myself) and the `power' I have.\nI was also consciously aware of my appearance, with\nsome participants stating I look younger than I am, some-\ntimes making me feel less capable of my job role, or that my\ncapability was being questioned. Upon reflection, I attended\nthe first visit dressed in a quite masculine way \u00ad wearing\ntrousers, limited make up and my hair tied back in a low bun\n(which is uncommon for me). Over time, my comfortable-\nness with being a female was apparent in being more relaxed\nby dressing and looking how I would normally would, and\neven wearing my hair down on one occasion. Like Adams\n(2000), my presentation of self is something that raised\ndoubts about `authenticity and integrity, as she feared pre-\nsenting an \"unreal\" or \"false\" self' (Adams, 2000, cited in\nidentity which was not a point of discussion (although it was\nmentioned by Geraldine) despite my visible wedding ring;\nperhaps, this subject was perceived as `too personal'?\nGeraldine openly talked about where she was from and being\na mother, allowing this to be an area of discussion. This made\nme consider what information was appropriate to share.\nFinally, I soon realised that while it is important to consider\nand reflect on the above, for me, regarding the participants as\n`people' and listening to their experiences was central.\nOverall, trying to blend in actually created barriers (internal\nand external) and can be perceived as pretentious, as such\n`finding a place' even before entering the research environ-\nment is important:\nGeraldine: The majority of those recruited to the interven-\ntion identified themselves as White European, hence, of\nthe 25 participants engaged in the intervention, only three\nrespondents identified as non-White. What became clear\nduring the study is how perception held by some of the\nparticipants in regard to my racial identity in this setting\nhelped to facilitate positive relationships with prisoners.\nParticipants were often keen to share information about\ntheir families, life prior to entering prison and life in\nprison. In addition, in Phase 1, participants spoke can-\ndidly about their substance misuse both inside and outside\nprison. Rarely did they refuse to answer questions asked,\nthere were occasions in which participants would share\nthings they had written additional too what we asked them\nto do. I felt that my racial identity provided me with a\nproxy insider status; during one visit, I was told that I was\n`real' that I was `O.K.' and that they trusted me.\nIn this setting, notions associated with my racial identity\nwere perceived by participants as signalling that I would\nhave an understanding of their experiences and that I shared\na connection. Hence, engagement was problem free.\nAlongside this, the fact that I spoke with a recognisable local\ndialect, turned up in jeans, lived in the same city of some of\nthe participants on the programme or grew up in an inner city\narea that shared familiar characteristics to that in which some\nparticipants had lived prior to their sentence likely added to\nmy acceptance. It appeared that I challenged their perception\nor the ideas they had about being an academic. This sense of\nfamiliarity was something I also experienced and I remember\nfeeling a sense of acceptance and warmth towards partici-\npants. I was aware of how my personal experiences of sup-\nporting friends and family who had come to the attention of\nthe criminal justice system lent itself to seeing beyond the\noffender label to the person underneath. Bourne (1983) notes\nthat respondents and researchers can experience a kaleido-\nscope of emotions during the course of a research project and\nlists emotions such as laughter, tears, love hate, happiness,\nlonging, fear grief and loss are all feelings that we may\nencounter and observe in others when we undertake research.\nFurthermore, not only is a range of emotions experienced\nduring the course of a project but we may also experience in\nobserved a range of emotions in the field. I was conscious of\nhow an aspect of our evaluation allowed for the humanisa-\ntion of prisoners. I was conscious that I wanted them to know\nthat I did not share the judgemental attitude that is often asso-\nciated with those awarded with the offender label. This is not\nto suggest that this did not pose some challenges during\nPhase 2 of the project that led to multiple conversations with\ncolleagues.\nPhillips and Earle (2010) argue that this sense of empathy\ncan be viewed as represented a sense of working-class align-\nment in which there is an emotional recognition of shared\nclass heritage. This is in conjunction with perceptions held\nthat being Black, I was working from an informed position\nthrough having experience of criminal justice system and\ndrugs. To participants, my primary identity, irrespective of\nthat I was the PI on the project, was not related to my position\nwithin the academy but the subordinate position that per-\nceived I held in wider society. For them, it was Lizzi they\ninitially identified as the `boss' or indeed any other member\nof the team that accompanied me on a visit. Rollock (2012)\nargues that an explanation rests in how it has been argued that\nracialised Others occupy a liminal space of alterity; a position\nat the edges of society from which their identities and experi-\nences are constructed irrespective of class. However, it is also\npossible to understand the engagement of participants as\nreflecting how they viewed the work we were carrying out\nand how they welcomed the opportunity to contribute to pro-\nviding an evidence base that would support sustaining the\nMGP at the prison and its expansion to other prison setting.\nAs such, it is possible to see that engagement was also facili-\ntated by participants and the researchers having a shared goal\nin wanting a smooth execution of the evaluation to elicit evi-\ndence that demonstrated the wider range of health, social and\neducational benefits they identified from being involved,\nwhich superseded certain notions of difference.\nBrown and Bos 7\nFinal reflections\nIn writing this article, we attempt to make visible how as\nresearchers we are rarely neutral, objective bystanders in the\nwork we undertake. In so doing, we want to add our voices\nthat of researchers working in secure settings as a way of\nshowing as noted by Amanda Coffey (1999) that\nFieldwork is personal, emotional and identity work. The\nconstruction and production of self and identity occurs both\nduring and after the fieldwork. In writing, remembering and\nrepresenting our fieldwork experiences we are involved in\nprocess of self-presentation and identity construction. In\nconsidering and exploring the intimate relations between the\nfield, significant other and the private self we are able to\nunderstand the processes of fieldwork as practical, intellectual\nand emotional accomplishments. (p. 1)\nLizzi: The experience of working with a senior Black\nresearcher has given me insight into considerations of\n`race', class and age in the research environment, both in\nterms of professional and participant interactions. While\nGeraldine has been forced to reflect on `race', class and\ngender throughout her professional life, I, on the other\ncontrary, have never really been forced to question my\nwhiteness (and power that goes with it) until this research\nexperience, demonstrating one of the advantages of\nbeing part of a multidisciplinary team. While this experi-\nence has been uncomfortable at times, with participants\ntrying to `work me out', it has enabled and challenged\nme to have a greater understanding of my own position-\nality and how aspects of my (self-constructed) identity\n(and others), and how others perceive me, implicitly\nshape and are fundamental to the research process.\nGeraldine: Situating ourselves in the research process\nhighlights some of the methodological and epistemologi-\ncal challenges encountered when engaged in research. It is\npossible to suggest that in relation to Lizzi, I was in a privi-\nleged position and my identity as a Black African\nCaribbean woman not only helped to facilitate access to\nmy participants but also provided an insight that enabled\nme to explicate stories that can be hidden when research-\ning in a prison setting. Yet, as noted by Phillips and Earle\n(2010), this is not to suggest that this is always the case.As\nsomeone with over 15\nyears' research experience, I am\nalso aware of the emotional labour one may encounter\nwhen engaged in social research (Hochschild, [1983]\n2003). Yet, the emotional work experienced during this\njourney cannot be under stated conversations about sui-\ncide, death, abuse and self-harm. The emotional work\nexperienced was in part my reaction to the stories recounted\nand I acknowledge that none can ever be truly an insider\n(Naples, 1996) and can never share or understand all par-\nticipants' views and experiences. Nonetheless, it was a\nreminder of why it is important to challenge the dehuman-\nising stereotypes often associated with prisoners.\nOur evaluation would be very different if we had\ndecided to remain invisible or taken a position with the\nexpectation that we remained the `objective'. Embarking\non qualitative research with ethnographic dimensions in a\nprison setting is an outcome of complex (re)negotiations\nbut in theorising our subjectivities (Letherby, 2013) is a\nmeans of illuminating issues that often remain invisible\nwithin prison research.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship and/or publication of this article.\nNote\n1.

The purpose of participant observations is to observe the delivery of the Master Gardener scheme in a prison\nsetting and to capture first-hand participants' views, behaviour and interactions.\nSemi-structured interviews. Semi-structured interviews allow the research team to explore issues arising from participant observations and\nother methods used.\nFocus groups. Focus groups were conducted with staff working in the Substance Misuse Team and participants.\nPortfolio of work. As part of the gardening intervention, participants are required to complete a work-based portfolio. The portfolio\ncontains information related to personal development \u00ad practical, factual and transferable skills learnt or developed as part of the\ngardening programme worksheets \u00ad record of skills covered as part of the gardening intervention, motivation and expectation in relation\nto involvement in the gardening intervention and to also include some biographical information.\nReflective diaries. On a monthly basis, participants were asked to complete a reflective diary. The diary is designed to capture individual\nparticipants' feelings and experiences about being on the programme. Participants were asked to consider sharing their experiences,\nfeelings, what they feel has changed over the month, and generally capture their perceptions about the gardening intervention.\nCircle of change. On a monthly basis, participants were asked to record their perceptions about how they feel the programme has\nencouraged and/or supported them to make changes in areas of their lives.\nPrison data. This is information that is routinely captured as part of the prison management regime; these data include adjudications,\nearned privilege level and category.\nDemographic survey. A one-off survey used as a way to gather socio-economic data when participants in the programme consent to take\npart in the evaluation.\nStaff survey uses as a way of gaining an insight as to the perceptions of changes observed by members of staff not directly involved in\nthe Master Gardening Programme but who may come into contact with participants as part of their roles, on a bi-monthly basis a short\nsurvey is administered to a random selection of staff.\nFamily survey used as a way of gaining an insight as to the perceptions of changes observed by participants' family members a short survey\nwas administered to family members attending a family event as part of the Master Gardener Programme."
