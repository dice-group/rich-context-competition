    "abstract": "Abstract\nRecent studies examine the use of rhetorical boundaries to produce intra-racial othering within whiteness. I expand this\nproject by exploring the textual and social codes in Jeff Foxworthy humor that demarcate the boundaries between the\nredneck and the non-redneck. Such boundaries are complex, porous fault-lines that use symbolic pollution embedded in\nhumor to stigmatize White outsiders. Social codes referencing symbolic pollution establish boundaries to define and insulate\na normative, mainstream White identity from the intra-racial threat of redneck identity. This project provides a novel\naddition to whiteness studies by taking redneck humor analytically seriously and concludes by drawing comparisons between\ncodes found in Foxworthy humor and those levied against rural Whites during the eugenics era.\n",

Solidified by comedian Jeff\nFoxworthy in the 1990s, the term redneck has been reinter-\npreted as an identity salient to a mass audience (Hartigan,\n1997). When redneck is used as a self-description or as a way\nof indicating otherness, it becomes a means of establishing\nidentity boundaries. To expand research exploring the\nnuances of whiteness, this article seeks to illuminate how,\nand why, redneck identity is being constructed in this humor.\nSpecifically, I seek to address three interrelated questions.\nResearch Question 1: How is redneck defined according\nto Foxworthy humor?\nResearch Question 2: How does this humor construct the\nboundaries between the redneck and non-redneck?\nResearch Question 3: Do the boundaries utilized in this\nhumor help us understand the production and mainte-\nnance of a more normative, mainstream whiteness?\nTo address these questions, I conducted a semiotics-\ninspired narrative analysis of more than 300 Foxworthy red-\nneck jokes derived from his comedy routine and posted on\nMy analysis is organized around four broad themes that per-\nmeate these jokes: lifestyle and fashion, rural living, sex and\ngender, and poverty. I explore the textual and social codes\nused to define redneck identity and construct the boundaries\nbetween the redneck and the non-redneck. I locate this proj-\nect within whiteness studies literature and conceptualize the\nanalysis via boundary theory and the notion of symbolic\npollution.\nHowever, it is important to recognize that although\nFoxworthy's redneck humor provides an important and\ninfluential interpretation of redneck identity, I am not sug-\ngesting that his humor should be viewed as the final, authori-\ntative word on the issue. There are many facets to redneck\nidentity and the term has a long history. Indeed, although it\nappears to have originated in the British Isles, the first known\nrecorded use of the term in the United States was in an 1830\ntravel book by A. Royall, titled Southern Tour (Goad, 1998;\nredneck to describe a group of Presbyterians in Fayetteville,\nbroadly used to describe rural White laborers in theAmerican\nsouth, as it had become associated with the effects of long\nhours of laboring in the sun (Huber & Drowne, 2001;\n1Ivy Tech Community College, Evansville, IN, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nJ. David Thomas, School of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Ivy Tech\nJeff Foxworthy's Redneck Humor\nand the Boundaries of Middle-Class\nAmerican Whiteness\nJ. David Thomas1\n Keywords\nwhiteness, redneck humor, pollution ideology, boundary theory, social constructionism\n2 SAGE Open\nRoebuck & Hickson, 1982). The term might have also been\nreinforced by a vitamin deficiency called pellagra, which\ncauses the neck and other parts of the body to redden.\nRoebuck and Hickson (1982) state that rural southern Whites\nfrequently suffered from ill health due to poor diets and a\ngeneral lack of medical care. Pellagra was common through-\nout the southern United States, especially in the 1930s, when\nmany believe that redneck became a nationally recognized\nIn states such as West Virginia, eastern Kentucky, south-\nern Illinois, and Indiana, the term redneck also became syn-\nonymous with unionization and its radical politics (Huber,\n1994). Rednecks would wear red bandanas around their\nnecks as a sign of solidarity, particularly while striking. The\nterm redneck was both embraced and used pejoratively to\ndescribe members of the United Mine Workers of America,\nas well as their rural background (Huber, 1994).\nRedneck took on more currency in popular culture in the\n1970s, particularly through the influence of country music.\nWith songs including Johnny Russell's Rednecks, White\nSocks and Blue Ribbon Beer, the Bellamy Brothers Redneck\nGirl, and David Allen Coe's Longhaired Redneck, it entered\nAmerica's popular lexicon and began to transcend its asso-\nciation with a strictly southern rurality. When Foxworthy's\nredneck humor first arrived in the early 1990s, redneck was\na nationally recognized term, and this humor has no doubt\nhad a significant impact on reshaping its meaning in the pop-\nular imagination. It is explicitly to that end that this article is\nfocused. What kind of redneck is being constructed in this\nhumor? What identity boundaries are being negotiated, and\ndoes this speak to mainstream whiteness?\nWhiteness, Boundary Theory, and\nSymbolic Pollution\nWhiteness studies are designed to exam and expose the \"ter-\nritory of white\" to bring it under critical analysis (Ignatiev &\ngrowth of whiteness studies and the sheer number of disci-\nplines impacted has been remarkable. Arnesen (2001) argues\nthat \"few branches of the humanities and social sciences\nhave escaped the increasing gravitational pull of `whiteness\nstudies'\" (p. 4). The study of whiteness has been dominated\nby the \"systemic racism camp,\" which focuses on the role of\npower and structural inequality (Foster, 2009; Roediger,\n1991). The systemic racism camp associates White identity\npredominantly with privilege and oppression (Harris, 1993;\nWiegman, 1999). Perhaps, the most ambitious analysis of\nwhiteness in this tradition is Painter's (2010) tome The\nHistory of White People. Painter (2010) ultimately roots the\norigins of whiteness--and by extension the \"white race\"--in\nthe labels and perceptions of social elites, yet acknowledges\nthe socially situational nuances of whiteness, particularly\nthrough how it has been impacted by class and gender. One\nof the fundamental assumptions of whiteness studies is that\nWhite racial identity and its associated privileges are largely\ninvisible, particularly to White individuals. As Perkinson\n(2004) states, \"White America is largely unconscious and\nmute, unable to address the question of its identity as white.\nPower does not normally have to give an account of its own\nbasis of operation\" (p. 1). As such, exploring White identity\nand exposing White privilege serves as foundational theo-\nretical concerns in this field. Perkinson (2004) notes that\nsuch exposure must occur on multiple levels--from the\noperation of structural privilege, to the organization of cul-\ntural habit, to the face-to-face politics of personal power.\nWith this focus on power and privilege, whiteness does not\nrepresent a color as much as it represents a condition \" . . . a\nstructured advantage that channels unfair gains and unjust\nenrichments to whites . . . \" (Lipsitz, 2011, p. 3).\nOf course, whiteness studies are not without critics. The\nmost well-known critique of whiteness studies comes from\nhistorian Eric Arnesen (2001). Arnesen argues that whiteness\nstudies scholars in general, and labor historians working\nwithin the framework of whiteness studies in particular,\nengage in serious methodological and conceptual flaws--\nparticularly conceptual inflation, conceptual substitution,\nand analytical overreach (Arnesen, 2001). Arnesen argues\nthat whiteness studies scholars inaccurately equate whiteness\nwith White supremacy, but that the two concepts are not nec-\nessarily equivalent. Arnesen (2001) worries that whiteness\nstudies scholars \" . . . reduce a complex, many faceted racial-\nization process to the matter of `becoming white'\" (p. 17).\nHowever, the claim that whiteness studies scholars are over-\nsimplifying a complex process is not a fair or accurate accu-\nsation, for exploring complexity and nuance in racial identity\nis a significant feature of whiteness studies. Jacobson (1999)\nperhaps put it best when he noted,\nThe contest over whiteness--its definition, its internal\nhierarchies, its proper boundaries, and its rightful claimants--\nhas been critical to American culture throughout the nation's\nhistory, and it has been a fairly untidy affair. (p. 5)\nOne of the many interesting discoveries of whiteness\nstudies scholars is the historical flexibility of White racial\nidentity. For example, throughout much of U.S. history,\nmany light-skinned immigrants of eastern and southern\nEuropean descent, the Irish, and even poor rural Whites,\nwere often not viewed as fully White and did not always\nreceive the benefits of whiteness (Painter, 2010). Roediger\nsouthern and eastern European immigrants in particular were\nfrequently racialized as \"in-between\" peoples; they neither\nexperienced the full racism of people of color, nor experi-\nence full inclusion as White Americans. Yet, many scholars\nhave concluded that the epistemological and ontological\nassumptions of the systemic racism camp in whiteness stud-\nies have greatly limited the study of White identity (Ching &\nRecent work within a stricter social constructionist tradition\nhas challenged the systemic racism camp for its tendency to\nreify and essentialize whiteness (Bonnett, 1998; Eichstedt,\nthat whiteness studies are moving toward a \"third wave,\"\nseeking to unify salient aspects of both the systemic racism\nand constructionist approach. They state,\nWhile whiteness often is synonymous with regimes of terror,\ngenocide and white supremacy, a third wave perspective on\nwhiteness rejects the implicit assumption that whiteness is\nonly an unconditional, universal and equally experienced\nlocation of privilege and power. (Twine & Gallagher, 2007,\nA core conceptual distinction between the systemic and\nconstructionist approach centers on the boundaries of White\nidentity. In the systemic approach, whiteness is believed to\nbe primarily or even exclusively established through a con-\nfrontation with blackness (Ignatiev & Garvey, 1996; Lipsitz,\nnow exploring how factors such as geographic region, gen-\nder, and socio-economic status establish gradations within\nWhite identity. For example, the labels White trash and hill-\nbilly highlight the stratified social terrain of White identity\nby illustrating a tradition of contempt and intra-racial other-\nlabels are used to mark certain White identities as Other even\nas they remain White as such, we can broaden our conceptual\nunderstanding of the formation and maintenance of White\nidentity. It is precisely this process of intra-racial othering\nthat this article seeks to explore through the boundaries con-\nstructed in this humor.\nIn the redneck humor of Jeff Foxworthy, certain Whites\nare marked as Other through the use of symbolic pollution.\nMax Weber (1946) was the first prominent social theorist to\nnote how individuals occupying lower statuses are often per-\nceived as dirty and that interacting with members from lower\nstatus groups can lead to impurity. However, Mary Douglas\n(1990) was the first theorist to explore thoroughly the sym-\nbolic construction and use of the concept \"dirt.\" Douglas\nIf we can abstract pathogenicity and hygiene from our notion of\ndirt, we are left with the old definition of dirt as a matter out of\nplace . . . It implies two conditions: a set of ordered relations and\na contravention of that order . . . This idea of dirt takes us straight\ninto the field of symbolism and promises a link-up of symbolic\nsystems of purity . . . In short, our pollution behavior is the\nreaction which condemns any object or idea likely to confuse or\ncontradict cherished classifications. (p. 155)\nBecause the notion of social disorder is important for\nunderstanding symbolic pollution, the application of sym-\nbolic pollution to a social group implies their challenge to\nsome normative aspect of that social order (Bean, 1981;\n\"People who hold dangerously ambiguous roles are seen\nas antisocial: `dirt, obscenity, and lawlessness' character-\nize them\" (p. 165). I contend that redneck identity is a\ndangerously ambiguous identity because it is a low status\nidentity occupied by Whites. This ambiguity poses an\nintra-racial threat because it challenges important assump-\ntions and beliefs related to normative whiteness, including\nWhite supremacy, American individualism, and meritoc-\nracy. Beliefs and values about dirt, garbage, or trash are\nconsistently used to make claims and counter-claims\nabout the character of one's status and identity (Douglas,\ndirty is \" . . . itself a weapon\" for clarifying and strength-\nidentity is associated with symbolic pollution because it\nstands outside of conventional whiteness and, thus, threat-\nens cherished concepts important to mainstream White\nidentity. In the course of this intra-racial othering, sym-\nbolic pollution becomes the principal means of establish-\ning boundaries between us/them, and in the process\nracializes the White Other via similar mechanisms used to\nracialize minorities (Jarosz & Lawson, 2002). In this\nunique contribution to the study of redneck identity and\nWhite intra-racial othering, I argue below that it is through\nfrequent reference to symbolic pollution that Foxworthy\nhumor actually constructs a particular type of pop culture\nredneck identity. Through this analysis, I will locate these\nreferences to symbolic pollution and explore what they\nmean for the construction of contemporary redneck iden-\ntity as well as whiteness.\nData and Method\nThe data consist of Foxworthy redneck jokes posted on the\nwebsite Country Humor. Jeff Foxworthy released the com-\nedy album You Might Be a Redneck If . . . in 1993, ushering\nin a new era for the social construction of redneck identity.\nFoxworthy and Foxworthy-inspired redneck humor are cul-\ntural narratives articulating norms, values, beliefs, and life-\nmaterial spanning over 25 years, Foxworthy has become the\nlargest selling comedy recording artist in history. At the time\nof this analysis, Country Humor had 300 of Foxworthy's You\nMight Be a Redneck If jokes derived from his stand-up and\nprinted material. I employed narrative analysis and incorpo-\nrated semiotic concepts to give denotative and connotative\nreadings of these jokes, exploring both literal, \"common\nsense\" references in this humor as well as the humor's more\nsymbolic meanings. My denotative and connotative readings\nexplore specific codes embedded in these jokes.\n4 SAGE Open\nCommunication is in part composed of employing and\ninterpreting culturally available codes (Barker, 2003;\nChandler, 2002). Codes serve as a key, or set of instructions,\nfor translating a message (Barthes & Duisit, 1975; Chandler,\nthe form of binary oppositions that structure both the prag-\nmatic use and symbolic meaning of language (Chandler,\n2002). Codes help simplify phenomena to make it easier to\ncommunicate experiences (Gombrich, 1982). Although\ncodes might not directly determine the meaning of a text,\nthey do constrain meaning so as to push for a preferred read-\ning (Hall, 1980). Different types of codes can be important\nfor different levels of analysis (Merrill, 2007). Indeed, most\ntexts have a multitude of interacting codes, and analysis\noften involves considering these codes and their inter-rela-\nOne type of code is the textual code (Chandler, 2002).\nTextual codes help to facilitate literary or communicative tra-\nditions. For example, some textual codes that can help struc-\nture the narrative genre include destinator/receiver, subject/\nobject, and assistant/traitors (White & Taket, 2000). While\ntextual codes can provide structure so as to conform to a par-\nticular genre, the text might also contain other codes that\nreflect the narrator's cultural values, attitudes, beliefs,\nassumptions, and practices. These codes can be referred to as\nsocial codes (Chandler, 2002). Social codes convey bodily,\nbehavioral, verbal, and commodity-based dimensions of\nsocial life (Chandler, 2002). Hence, textual codes are more\nspecific to genre structure, whereas social codes communi-\ncate broader aspects of collective existence.\nTextual and social codes help inform this analysis in two\nways. First, I focus on the textual code subject/object because\nthis is a fundamental component of Foxworthy's redneck\nhumor. The code subject/object is essential to understanding\nwhat does and does not constitute redneck identity in this\nhumor. Also, this code is important because it highlights how\nFoxworthy jokes can be viewed as elementary narratives.\nNarratives often follow an initial state  disruption  new\nstate sequence (Franzosi, 1998), and Foxworthy jokes unfold\nin a similarly linear pattern. The typical structure of a\nFoxworthy redneck joke is,\nIf you [pause] have a half-built truck engine in the front yard of\nyour trailer home [pause] you might be a redneck.\nTherefore, you can be determined to be the subject, a half-\nbuilt truck engine in the front yard of your trailer home a\ncomposite of social codes, and redneck the object. The humor-\nous message of the joke is partially predicated on the collapse\nof the code subject/object. The initial state of the linear narra-\ntive sequence is the absence of a redneck identity, which can\nbe viewed as the preferred state. The disruption occurs during\nthe gist of the joke, which presents a culturally compacted\nimage of redneck identity referencing one or more social\ncodes. The new state of the narrative is the association of\noneself, one's relatives, friends, acquaintances, or at least a\ngeneralized other, with this new identity of redneck. When the\nbinary collapses, threatening either your or another associ-\nate's identity, the juxtaposition of incompatible ideas has\noccurred and laughter ensues (Meyer, 2000).\nSocial codes referencing symbolic pollution (i.e., pollu-\ntion codes) also provide important elements of the humor-\nous message. This particular type of social code is important\nfor understanding the cultural connotations found in this\nhumor. Pollution codes establish symbolic boundaries\nbetween types of people. Such pollution codes often take\nform in the binaries cleanliness/dirtiness, civilized/uncivi-\nlized, ordered/unordered, moral/immoral, and others. For\nexample, the pollution code cleanliness/dirtiness is signi-\nfied when a joke states that you might be a redneck if the\nSalvation Army \"declines your mattress.\" In this particular\nexample, the pollution code cleanliness/dirtiness is used to\nconstruct redneck identity as dirty, and then, it becomes\nassociated with all the negative connotations such dirtiness\nentails. Therefore, pollution codes specify the multitude of\nways in which status hierarchies are being implicitly con-\nstructed in redneck humor. These pollution codes generally\nfocus on one of two patterns: excess or inappropriate juxta-\nposition. These two patterns conform to what one would\nexpect concerning the nature of humor (Gross, 2007;\nterns of excess and incongruent juxtaposition, these pollu-\ntion codes contaminate common systems of classification\nin modern, mainstream, White American social life. As\nillustrated below, the operation of these two patterns of\nhumor use divergent paths yet arrive at the same destina-\ntion, the marking of redneck identity as a polluted identity\noutside the realm of normative whiteness.\nAnalysis: Pollution Codes in Foxworthy\nRedneck Humor\nThrough exploration of pollution codes implied in Foxworthy\nredneck humor, this analysis illuminates but one way intra-\nracial othering occurs within White identity formation. There\nare four expansive themes permeating these jokes: lifestyle\nand fashion, rural living, sex and gender, and poverty. These\nthemes and the pollution codes found therein are offered as\nrepresentative of the themes and pollution codes found\nthroughout this humor.\nLifestyle and Fashion\nFoxworthy humor establishes boundaries to convey the char-\nacter of redneck identity. This humor often employs cultural\nand biological differences to separate rednecks from norma-\ntive whiteness. Employing many pollution codes simultane-\nously, these codes intersect and fuse so that any one joke can\nsignify multiple means of pollution. Associating redneck\nidentity with lack of hygiene occurs in the jokes below in\npart through an association with the codes culture/nature,\ncleanliness/dirtiness, and cultivated/trashy. As revealed in\nthese jokes, rednecks are constructed as prone to bodily\ninfestation by insects, animals, and/or diseases.\nYou might be a redneck if:\nChiggers are included on your list of top 5 hygiene concerns.\nBirds are attracted to your beard.\nYou have ever bathed with flea and tick soap.\nYou think that Campho-Phenique is a miracle drug.\nBecause the human body is a key component of racialized\nrhetoric, it is often a site of contention over definitions of\ncivilized/uncivilized (Hartigan, 2005). These particular jokes\ntake the culture/nature binary to the level of the physical\norganism; the living body is constructed as the site that is\npolluted. However, it is not simply nature's infestation of the\nbody that threatens the boundary between culture and nature.\nWe also see bodily excretions and waste threaten this bound-\nary. Human excrement is tabooed in all cultures because it\nthreatens the fundamental distinction between \"me and not\ntle emerge in this humor as human excretions associated with\nredneck identity. We see these references as well as others in\nthe jokes below.\nYou might be a redneck if:\nSomeone in your family says \"Cum'n heer an'lookit this afore I\nflush it.\"\nExxon and Conoco have offered you royalties for your hair.\nYou use lava soap more than three times a day.\nThese jokes illustrate the intersection of pollution codes in\nthis humor. The association of rednecks with feces and\ngrease is clear in these jokes, thus connecting redneck\nidentity with human excretions. Yet, in the first joke, it is\nnot simply the reference to human excrement that identi-\nfies the redneck, it is also the speech pattern. This speech\npattern intersects with those pollution codes associating\nredneck identity with laziness, rusticity, and a lack of edu-\ncation. We also see the intersection of human excretions, a\nlack of education, and immorality in the jokes addressing\nredneck tobacco use.\nYou might be a redneck if:\nYou keep a spit cup on the ironing board.\nYour family reunion features a chewing tobacco spit-off.\nYou participate in the \"who can spit tobacco the farthest\"\ncontest.\nRedman Chewing Tobacco sends you a Christmas card.\nThe focus on redneck spittle highlights the dirty, disgusting\nbehavior of redneck tobacco use. Instead of simply associat-\ning redneck tobacco use with secondhand smoke, the focus\non chew spotlights disgusting, tobacco-laden saliva. This\nfocus unifies human excretions with poor lifestyle choice,\nirresponsibility, and immorality. Below, we also see a more\ndirect relationship between rednecks and dirt through jokes\nportraying the unclean living conditions and habits of\nrednecks.\nYou might be a redneck if:\nYou keep a can of RAID on the kitchen table.\nThe Salvation Army declines your mattress.\nGoing to the laundromat means cleaning out the back of the\ntruck.\nYou clean your fingernails with a stick.\nYou prefer car keys to Q-tips.\nIn these jokes we see dirty, pest-infested living conditions\nintersecting with poor behavioral habits and lack of intelli-\ngence, or at least common sense. Poor hygiene and squalid\nliving conditions stand in symbolic opposition to cleanliness,\nwhich is associated with order, civilization, and morality\n(Bean, 1981). Order, civilization, and morality are chal-\nlenged by another stereotype that targets the moral fabric of\nredneck identity: excessive alcohol use. The image of a\ndrunken and abusive redneck demonstrates how immorality\nand excess serve as a central explanation for their misfor-\ntune. In the jokes below the use of alcoholic imagery solidi-\nfies the relationship between immorality and redneck\nbehavioral patterns.\nYou might be a redneck if:\nYou actually made a pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight with\nAlan Jackson.\nYou're a lite beer drinker, because you start drinking when it\ngets light.\nYou've ever parked a Camero in a tree.\nYou've ever put a six-pack in a casket right before they closed it.\nThe first joke in this set combines alcoholism with a domi-\nnant theme: rurality. The lyrics of famous country musician\n6 SAGE Open\nAlan Jackson serves as a bridge between alcoholic excess\nand rural Americans. In addition, the jokes discussing drink-\ning when it is light and getting into drinking and driving acci-\ndents illustrate how this excessive, polluted behavior is a\nlifestyle choice that can lead to dire consequences. The last\njoke illustrates how this poor lifestyle choice then transitions\ninto an unsavory death ritual.\nYou might be a redneck if:\nYou can't take a bath because beer is iced down in your tub.\nJack Daniels makes your list of most admired people.\nYou ever got too drunk to fish.\nYour beer can collection is considered a tourist attraction in\nyour home town.\nThe first joke in this set illustrates how alcohol interrupts\nimportant purity rituals. The denotative reading is that the\nredneck is unable to clean themselves; the beer is literally in\nthe way. A connotative reading can relate cleanliness to\npurity, and the redneck's inability to bath symbolically refer-\nences how alcohol serves to pollute redneck identity. Yet, in\nthe jokes above, it is not simply the consumption of alcohol\nthat serves as a means of pollution; it is the association of\nredneck identity with excessive alcohol use. It is not the con-\ntent of the joke but rather the relationship between the con-\ntent and a proclivity toward excessiveness that is key here.\nThe proclivity toward excessiveness proves to be a funda-\nmental way of differentiating the redneck from the non-red-\nneck in much of this humor. This supports Zuesse's (1974)\ncontention that it is gradations within categories rather than\nbetween categories that often differentiates the socially\nacceptable from the symbolically polluted.\nAnother example of this emphasis on gradations within\ncategories involves hunting and fishing. As per the jokes\nbelow, it is not the act of hunting and fishing that marks one's\nidentity as redneck; it is taking behaviors associated with\nhunting and fishing to bizarre extremes. An emphasis on\nexcess draws the recipient of the joke's attention to a lack of\nself-control. A lack of self-control is associated with child-\nishness, primitiveness, and immorality and helps explain\nwhy rednecks make poor lifestyle choices. Therefore, this\nhumor suggests that although a redneck/non-redneck might\nengage in the same activity, redneck behaviors lack taste and\nself-control.\nYou might be a redneck if:\nYou have the local taxidermist's number on speed dial.\nYou owe the taxidermist more than your annual income.\nYou've ever filled your deer tag on the golf course.\nThere is a stuffed possum anywhere in your house.\nYou own a homemade fur coat.\nYou'd rather catch bass than get some (if you can't guess . . . )\nWe also see the intersection of the pollution codes poor/rich,\npre-modern/modern, and virility/impotence in the jokes\nabove. To illustrate, rather than hunting for sport or hunting\nbig game, these jokes construct rednecks as hunting for util-\nity, such as producing clothing, or hunting small game for\ndecoration. Hunting for utility and hunting small game (rac-\ncoons, rabbits, possums) symbolically pollutes redneck iden-\ntity by associating it with pre-modern living conditions,\npoverty, and/or a lack of style. The third joke also confounds\ncivilized/uncivilized by implying that the redneck went hunt-\ning and shot a deer on a golf course, or was golfing, had a\ngun, and shot a deer in the process. In either instance, the\ncollapse of the boundary between golf, which is traditionally\nviewed as an upper-middle- or upper-class sport, and hunting\nprovides a key source of the humorous message. The sugges-\ntion is that rednecks do not know how to support or maintain\nimportant social boundaries--in this case, the boundary\nbetween upper-class golf and hunting. In addition, the last\njoke above draws redneck sexuality and virility into ques-\ntion, a theme that will be explored later, after we take a closer\nlook at rurality.\nPolluted Rural Spaces: Living in the Outskirts\nIn the code culture/nature, the rustic character of redneck\nidentity is directly connected with nature. This connection\nlocates redneck identity outside of civilization, as made\nexplicit in the following jokes.\nYou might be a redneck if:\nDirections to your house include \"Turn off the paved road.\"\nGetting a package from your post office requires a full tank of\ngas in the truck.\nRustics live \"out\" in the countryside, boondocks, boonies,\nsticks, and so forth, rather than \"in\" the city (Ching &Creed,\n1997). The association between the binary in/out and the\nbinary urban/rural draws our attention to the connection\nbetween rusticity and outness. Living in figurative outness\nis living external to the bounds of modern society, external\nto contemporary cultural norms (Ching & Creed, 1997). In\nthe culture/nature binary, this humor uses nature as a means\nof symbolic pollution. Yet, outside of this humor the reverse\nis often true, where civilization is constructed as dirty or\ncorrupt and nature as pure or pristine. There is much schol-\narly work that deals with the ideological implications of\nthis binary for the American political system and public\nKnoke & Henry, 1977). However, this ideological battle\noften misses some broader implications of the culture/\nnature binary. Kaika (2004) notes how the struggle between\n\"good water\" and \"bad water\" is analogous to the differ-\nence between \"good nature\" and \"bad nature.\" Good water\nis clean, processed, controlled, and commodified. Bad\nwater is dirty, gray, metabolized, non-processed, and non-\ncommodified. Bad water is found in rivers, streams, creeks,\nrainwater, sewage, and so forth, and is understood as dele-\nterious to the human body if consumed. Good water occurs\nthrough a process of technological and cultural transforma-\ntion. Good water is used for drinking, cleaning, swimming,\nand religious services. Water is \"good\" after it has been\ntransformed by human technology and culture (Kaika,\n2004). Likewise, only after nature has been transformed--\nfor example, from a dangerous wilderness to a national\npark--does it provide enough safety and security to be\nenjoyed as \"pristine.\" Associating an identity with \"good\nnature\" or \"bad nature\" is one means of marking status in\nmodernity (Kaika, 2004). Members of higher statuses might\nenjoy \"good nature\" by going to a ski resort, or taking a\nweekend fishing trip to a public or private lake. Good\nnature is good because it has the semblance of order; it is\nunder the will and domain of humankind. However bad\nnature is unwieldy and dangerous; it violates boundaries\nand is void of culture.\nIn Foxworthy humor, the breakdown of the culture/nature\nand order/disorder binaries also occurs through the break-\ndown of the inside and outside of the home. Living condi-\ntions is a prominent means of associating redneck identity\nwith symbolic pollution. The jokes below highlight the dis-\ntinction between culture/inside and nature/outside.\nYou might be a redneck if:\nYou have to go down to the creek to take a bath.\nYou have to go outside to get something `out of the fridge.'\nThe best way to keep things cold is to leave 'em in the shade.\nYour classes at school were canceled because the path to the\nrestroom was flooded.\nThe unification of civilization with order and nature with dis-\norder is most visible in jokes referencing the redneck home.\nKaika (2004) argues that \"the idea of the house as a means of\nseparating the inside from the outside, nature from human\nbeings, the public from the private sphere, has existed since\nantiquity\" (p. 265). In the process of imbuing the home with\ncultural and ideological meaning \"nature\" is extracted and\nthen selectively allowed back in after being produced, puri-\nfied, and commodified (Kaika, 2004). In Foxworthy humor,\nthe breakdown of the binaries inside/outside and culture/\nnature serves to pollute redneck identity.\nYou might be a redneck if:\nYou've ever raked leaves in your kitchen.\nYou've ever used a weedeater indoors.\nGoing to the bathroom at night involves shoes and a flashlight.\nYou have flowers planted in a bathroom appliance in your front\nyard.\nThis binary culture/nature, and rurality more broadly, also\nserves as an important explanation for another commonly\nassumed redneck characteristic: racism.\nYou might be a redneck if:\nThere is a sheet hanging in your closet and a gun rack hanging\nin your truck.\nJarosz and Lawson (2002) argue that middle-class Whites\nassociate extreme forms of racism with rural Whites in an\nattempt to free themselves from being implicated in institu-\ntional racism. By insisting that racism is a core quality of\nrednecks, middle-class Whites disassociate themselves from\nracism by locating it in the primitive and pre-modern aspects\nof White American culture. This reinforces the notion that\nracism is only a problem because of a particular kind of\nWhite identity. Therefore, rednecks free normative middle-\nclass whiteness of its complicity in racist practices (Jarosz &\nLawson, 2002). Moreover, the lack of education, being pre-\nmodern, a primitive lifestyle and ensuing racist sentiments\nall intersect with an association to southern regionalism.\nYou might be a redneck if:\nYou are still holding onto Confederate money because you think\nthe South will rise again.\nYou have started a petition to change the national anthem to\n\"Georgia on My Mind.\"\nMore than one living relative is named after a Southern Civil\nWar general.\nThe construction of redneck identity as pre-modern, rustic,\nout-of-touch, and often racist and regionalist creates a pol-\nluted identity that establishes boundaries for a more main-\nstream White identity. Yet, although the racist and regionalist\nsentiments associated with redneck identity help quell a\nmore normative whiteness's complicity in racist practices,\nthere is perhaps no better theme that illustrates the construc-\ntion of degenerate whiteness than themes involving sexual\nand gender taboo. I now explore how taboo sexual and gen-\nder behavior represents a major dimension of regressive\nwhiteness in this humor.\n8 SAGE Open\nPolluted Sexual and Gendered Practices\nTaboos are important means of boundary work, giving form\nto formlessness and explicitly delineating the divine from\nthe human elements of social life (Levine, 1986; Zuesse,\n1974). Taboo sexual behavior is particularly threatening to\nmultiple culturally valued boundaries (Davies, 1982). In\npopular culture, rustic sexual expression often takes the\nform of homosexual rape, incest, or bestiality (Ching &\nCreed, 1997). In this humor, homosexual rape manifests in\nargues that the film Deliverance unfolds in a narrational\ntension between nature and culture. In one particular scene,\nthe viewer witnesses the homosexual rape of one of the\nmain characters. The rape was committed by one of several\npoor, rural Whites, all of whom were carrying firearms.\nBelow, this homosexual rape reemerges to serve the pur-\npose of polluting redneck identity.\nYou might be a redneck if:\nYou think the mountain men in Deliverance were just\n\"misunderstood.\"\nThis particular joke also seems to poke fun at political cor-\nrectness. Stating that the mountain men were simply misun-\nderstood, combined with quotations indicating irony,\nsuggests a sarcastic play on the notions of cultural relativ-\nism and/or cultural sensitivity. Such irony is often meant to\nimply the opposite: that, this violent, homosexual rape is\nindicative of something more essential, be it cultural, or\nindividual pathology. However, incest is a much more prev-\nalent taboo in this humor than is homosexual rape. In popu-\nlar culture, incest is understood as typical redneck behavior\nand, therefore, rednecks are perceived as coming from a\ngene puddle instead of a gene pool (Goad, 1998). Indeed,\nincest serves as a key biological explanation for why red-\nneck identity fails to conform to the standards of a more\nnormative whiteness, and this biological explanation is one\nof the most transparent ways redneck identity is racialized.\nFollowing this tradition of racialization through an empha-\nsis on incest, sexuality is constructed as a \"family affair\" in\nthis humor.\nYou might be a redneck if:\nYou view the next family reunion as a chance to meet girls.\nYou can't get married to your sweetheart because there is a law\nagainst it.\nYou stand under the mistletoe at Christmas and wait for Granny\nand cousin Sue-Ellen to walk by.\nYou go Christmas shopping for your mom, sister, and girlfriend,\nand you only need to buy one gift.\nThese jokes suggest not only do rednecks freely engage in\nincestuous relations but also such relationships are common,\nculturally acceptable, and even expected. By transgressing\nthe incest taboo, the redneck is violating both the under-\nstanding of what helps make one human as well as what\nhelps connect humans to the divine (Levine, 1986; Zuesse,\n1974). In this way, the actual sex act is one means of pollu-\ntion, its outcome (inbred offspring) is another means of pol-\nlution, and the culture that supports this behavior is perceived\nas dysfunctional, degenerate, and immoral.\nYou might be a redneck if:\nYour brother-in-law is also your uncle.\nYour family tree doesn't have any branches.\nYour gene pool doesn't have a \"deep end.\"\nYou dated your daddy's current wife in high school.\nYou have to scratch your sister's name out of the message: \"for\na good time call . . . because you feel guilty about putting it\nthere.\"\nThe use of incestuous relationships as a means of polluting\nredneck identity offers a much-needed explanation for the\nvery existence of such an identity. Why are there White peo-\nple who are poor and live in rural areas? Why are they not\nmoving out of these areas and out of poverty? Their very exis-\ntence challenges the legitimacy of American meritocracy.\nTheir inability to conform to White middle-class norms\ndemands explanation and incest offers a powerful one. This\nbiological explanation conferring genetic weakness combines\nto reinforce, and be reinforced by, poor behavior and lack of\nself-control to explain the existence of such an identity.\nAnother common theme concerning redneck sexual\nbehavior is a lack of male romance and chivalry. As Davies\n(1982) notes, the strength of taboos often lies less in content\nthan in structure, in the separation of categories and in the\nkeeping apart of like and unlike elements. While associating\nredneck sexuality with homosexual rape or incest is more\nextreme than lack of male romance or chivalry, it is still used\nas a means of polluting redneck identity. Male sexual behav-\nior and mating patterns are constructed as uncultivated,\ninsufficiently romantic, and trashy.\nYou might be a redneck if:\nYour idea of talking during sex is \"Ain't no cars coming, baby!\"\nAfter making love you ask your date to roll down the window.\n\"Honey? Are the lights out? Is the door locked? Is the parking\nbrake set?\" is what you hear right before you and your wife/girl\nmake love.\nThese jokes pollute redneck identity by attacking their chiv-\nalry toward their partners. Courting and romance can be seen\nas an important means of separating the civilized man from\nthe primitive man. Such jokes imply that rednecks are not\nreally \"men\" because they lack the desire, the means, or the\nknowledge to properly court their partners or engage in\nromantic love making. Attacking the romantic virtue of\n\"primitive males\" has deep historical roots. For example,\nAfrican American male sexuality was constructed as primi-\ntive and lacking in chivalrous virtue by the antebellum south-\nern aristocracy (Bay, 2000). Considering the historical\nassociation of the term redneck with the American south,\nsuch jokes might reflect deeply embedded attitudes that\nestablished boundaries between southern gentlemen and\nunrefined rednecks.\nNonetheless, in contemporary popular culture, redneck\nidentity is also understood as a traditional and masculine\nidentity. The masculinity of redneck identity often intersects\nwith alcoholism, an abusive disposition toward women, and\nthe support of traditional gender roles.\nYou might be a redneck if:\nYou think \"loading the dishwasher\" means getting your wife\ndrunk.\nIn this humor, masculinity is more often constructed as a\ncharacteristic of redneck women. Redneck women are con-\nstructed as grossly masculine and lacking in feminine virtue.\nIndeed, rather than focusing on redneck identity as a means\nof enforcing traditional gender roles, most jokes focus on\nhow the feminine is polluted by the masculine in redneck\nidentity. Femininity is polluted by constructing the wife as a\nmanual laborer, as well as through behavior traditionally\nviewed as unbecoming of women.\nYou might be a redneck if:\nYour wife can climb a tree faster than your cat.\nYour wife wants to stop at the gas station to see if they've got the\nnew Darrell Waltrip Budweiser wall clock.\nYour wife's best pair of shoes is steel-toed Red Wings.\nYour wife's job requires her to wear an orange vest.\nSymbolic pollution is often associated with mundane, physi-\ncal work, and materiality (Bean, 1981). These last two jokes\nspecifically focus on how being working class and working\nin manual labor pollutes the feminine in redneck identity.\nThese jokes expressly address \"your wife,\" and then associ-\nate \"your wife\" with a masculine trait. Therefore, you know\nyou might be a redneck if \"your wife\" possesses overtly mas-\nculine, working class traits. Consequently, this humor uses\nredneck identity by associating it with redneck femininity. In\naddition, while working class manual labor pollutes redneck\nfemininity, so does an association with what is beautiful ver-\nsus what is ugly. Polluted appearances are unattractive and\ntacky. Because redneck identity is a polluted identity, and\nredneck femininity is polluted by working class masculinity,\nthen redneck women are, through symbolic touching,\nunattractive.\nYou might be a redneck if:\nYour wife's hairdo has ever been ruined by a ceiling fan.\nYour wife weighs more than your refrigerator.\nYour wife has a beer belly and you find it attractive.\nThe lack of self-discipline and being old fashioned are also\nsources of pollution. The first joke establishes a sense of the\nredneck woman's \"big hair,\" an old fashioned hairstyle taken\nto an extreme in this particular joke. Likewise, in the second\njoke all the cultural stereotypes associated with being over-\nweight serve to pollute redneck women, such as being lazy,\nlacking self-discipline, and being immoral. Also, the last\njoke in this set offers a good example of how most jokes\ntargeting redneck women are often still geared toward a male\naudience. It is not just that your wife has a beer belly--a\nstereotypically male phenomenon, and that the belly pollutes\nher identity. It is also that you find it attractive. In other\nwords, feminine identity being polluted by masculine iden-\ntity is not the only pollution code. It is also polluting those\nmen who choose such women, and it is often the men who\nare the primary targets of the joke. Therefore, the impact of\nthese pollution codes is dependent upon a firm dichotomy\nbetween man/woman and masculine/feminine. Any acts or\ncharacteristics that threaten these binaries are a menace to\nculturally valued boundaries, and thus, can serve as possible\nsites of pollution.\nAnother means of polluting redneck femininity with mas-\nculine traits is by associating redneck femininity with\ntobacco use and alcoholism.\nYou might be a redneck if:\nYour mom gives you tips on how to sneak booze into sporting\nevents.\nYour mother doesn't remove the Marlboro from her lips before\ntelling the State Trooper to kiss her ass.\nYour mother keeps a spit cup on the ironing board.\nThe tobacco chewers in your family aren't just men.\nSuch jokes challenge redneck femininity by associating red-\nneck women with two characteristics that strongly define\nredneck masculinity: alcohol and tobacco use. Yet, these\njokes also pollute redneck femininity by implicitly challeng-\ning the redneck woman's ability to perform a most cherished\ntraditional cultural role, that of mother. Tobacco and alcohol\nare not only a masculine redneck trait, excessive alcohol and\ntobacco use are seen as immoral regardless of one's gender.\nThe sneaking of alcohol into sporting events implies a dispo-\nsition toward criminality, drunkenness, or both. Likewise,\nthe three jokes discussing tobacco use also entail an uncouth\ndisposition and criminality. Such jokes imply that masculin-\nity is not the only danger associated with redneck femininity.\nRedneck femininity is also dangerous to a man's ability to\nform and/or maintain a wholesome family life. And, this\nhighlights an interesting component of Foxworthy's redneck\nhumor that I would like to make explicit: namely, the unspo-\nken gender scripts related to work and family life. This\nhumor operates with restrictive and traditional gender role\nassumptions. It is essentialist, as the masculine/feminine\nexists as an innate, natural binary. This humor is predicated\non the notion that femininity is inherently soft and emotive.\nIt presupposes the existence of clear boundaries and scripts\nthat are rooted in very traditional and conservative percep-\ntions of gender. These traditional and conservative percep-\ntions might reflect the educational distance and class-based\nassumptions of redneck and mainstream whiteness, because\nit is through their working class jobs, alcohol and tobacco\nuse, and comfort or embrace of violence, that redneck women\ntransgress acceptable gendered boundaries. As such, the\ntransgression of these boundaries not only pollutes their\nidentity but also pollutes the identities of those redneck\nmales associated with them.\nLast, I conclude this analysis of Foxworthy redneck jokes\nby exploring how poverty, education, and status intertwine\nand serve as a primary means of polluting redneck identity.\nThe Pollution of Poverty\nTrash is related to poverty both literally and figuratively.\nTrash is related to poverty literally because poverty often\nforces people to exploit what others have discarded as\n\"trash.\" Poverty is figuratively associated with trash through\nlabels such as White trash and other rhetorical means of sym-\nbolic pollution. Trash is physically relocated to the periphery\nof civilization, marking the boundary where civilization ends\nand nature begins (Keskpaik, 2001). Similarly, by associat-\ning redneck identity with literal and figurative trash, red-\nnecks are symbolically removed from mainstream culture.\nYou might be a redneck if:\nYour coffee table used to be a cable spool.\nYour stereo speakers used to belong to the Drive-in Theater.\nYou come home from the garbage dump with more than you went\nwith.\nYou buy your wife tube socks at the flea market.\nYou think \"taking out the trash\" means taking your in-laws to a\nmovie.\nIn the first four jokes above, we see how the boundary\nbetween literal and figurative trash often breaks down in\nsocial practice. The first three jokes connect redneck identity\nwith literal trash, things that have been discarded. The first\ntwo jokes can also be read in reference to immoral and/or\ncriminal behavior, because the cable spool and speakers\nmight have been stolen. The connection between redneck\nidentity and literal trash also associates redneck identity with\nfigurative trash. The transition from literal to figurative trash\nis complete in the last joke relating trash to \"in-laws.\"\nThings that are socially and symbolically \"discarded\" are\nMaterial objects that are physically relocated to special sites\nbecome trash. For example, the placement of a computer\nnext to a garbage bin designates that computer, no matter\nhow new or functional, as \"trash,\" again highlighting how\npollution leads to infection through contact (Levine, 1986).\nTrash is on the periphery, and similarly trailer parks are on\nthe periphery of American culture. The trailer park, as a\nsocial code, is so polluted that U.S. culture has a unique term\nfor individuals who live in trailer homes: trailer trash. The\njokes below show how redneck identity is polluted by an\nassociation with trailers and trailer trash.\nYou might be a redneck if:\nYer mom calls ya over t'help, cause she has a flat tire . . . on her\nhouse.\nYou own a home that is mobile and 5 cars that aren't.\nYou replace a flat tire on your truck with a tire from your house.\nYour home has more miles on it than your car.\nYour richest relative invites you over to his new home to help\nhim remove the wheels and skirt.\nThe theme emphasized in these particular jokes is the dichot-\nomy between home and mobility. Because trailer trash live in\n\"mobile\" homes, they lack roots in community, and hence\nare placeless. The mobile home replaces having deep roots in\na community with being a vagabond or tramp. In the jokes\nabove, we also see the juxtaposition of mobile homes and\nbroken down vehicles. The cultural image of the redneck\nlawn littered with broken down vehicles is a powerful one.\nTrash marks the external boundaries of culture (Keskpaik,\n2001) and the association between redneck identity and trash\noften occurs through this focus on the state and character of\nredneck vehicles. We see the connection between redneck\nidentity and trash more explicitly in the jokes below through\nthe direct focus on the pitiful state of redneck vehicles.\nYou might be a redneck if:\nThere are four or more cars up on blocks in the front yard.\nFewer than half of your cars run.\nYou have a rag for a gas cap (on a car that does not run).\nYou have a color coordinating rope that ties down your car\nhood.\nThis literal and figurative association makes special sense\nconsidering the impact automobiles have had on American\nculture over the course of the 20th century. Automobiles are\nsymbols ofAmerican freedom and individuality, and the type\nand state of one's vehicle can be viewed as a status symbol.\nFor the redneck, the automobile serves as a prime example of\ntheir polluted, lowly status.\nYou might be a redneck if:\nThe blue book value of your truck goes up and down depending\non how much gas it has in it.\nThe taillight covers of your car are made of red tape.\nYour vehicle has a two-tone paint job--primer red and primer\ngray.\nYou have a Hefty bag on the passenger side window of your car.\nThe image of the redneck trailer home on the outskirts of\ntown and physically resembling a junk yard uses two impor-\ntant American cultural symbols, the automobile and the\nhome, as a means of polluting redneck identity. This utilizes\nthe often porous boundary between literal and figurative\ntrash, and in the process establishes a polluted identity that\nconflates poverty with lifestyle choice, laziness, and immo-\nrality. This conflation marks redneck identity as a low status.\nYet, some jokes deal specifically with status by focusing on\nthe boundary between high culture and low culture, and con-\nnecting redneck identity with low culture. The low status of\nredneck identity is explained in part by cultural primitive-\nness. The redneck's lack of cultural refinement speaks\ndirectly to their low social status as they are constructed as\nhaving base interests and base cultural knowledge. These\nparticular jokes highlight how rednecks lack economic,\nsocial, and cultural capital. Redneck cultural knowledge is\nunderstood as limited, base, and inadequate. The jokes below\nare structured with an explicit schism between high culture\nand low culture.\nYou might be a redneck if:\nYou consider pork and beans to be a gourmet food.\nYou think a turtleneck is a key ingredient for soup.\nYou think the French Riviera is a foreign car.\nYou think that Dom Perignon is a mafia leader.\nYou consider a six-pack and a bug-zapper high-quality\nentertainment.\nIn these jokes, the juxtaposition of incongruent cultural\nobjects or knowledge is used to elicit humor. Cultural objects\nsuch as turtlenecks or Dom Perignon are falsely associated\nwith food and people. These jokes reinforce the claim that\nstatus is associated with bodily dimensions (Elis, 1994;\nHartigan, 2005) because redneck cultural knowledge is con-\nstructed as base knowledge, related to food, the human body,\nand generally vulgar entertainment. This is not surprising\nconsidering that tabooed behavior frequently clusters around\nbase activities that are \"most in need of `culturizing' and\nRedneck poverty is also explained by lack of education,\nwhich is often associated with the lack of innate intelligence.\nRedneck breeding patterns are seen as having created an\nidentity that lacks a \"genetic deep end.\" \"Bad breeding\" has\nbeen a consistent theme explaining rural White poverty since\nthe eugenics era at the turn of the 20th century (Hartigan,\nand bad breeding, redneck identity moves away from an\nindividual lifestyle choice and instead becomes a reflection\nof broader systemic degeneracy based in family structure,\nfamily behavior, and biology. The jokes below touch upon\nthemes of degenerate family structure and irresponsible fam-\nily behavior.\nYou might be a redneck if:\nThe most commonly heard phrase at your family reunion is\n\"What the hell are you looking at, Shithead?\"\nYou were shooting pool when any of your kids were born.\nYour Junior/Senior Prom had a Daycare.\nYou've ever climbed a water tower with a bucket of paint to\ndefend your sister's honor.\nThe lack of innate intelligence and educational attainment is\nconstructed as a cause and consequence of redneck degen-\neracy. Genetic inbreeding and limited education become\nconfounding factors that explain both why redneck identity\nexists and how it is fundamentally different from a more nor-\nmative, mainstream whiteness. For example,\nYou might be a redneck if:\nYour dad walks you to school because you're in the same\ngrade.\nYou think a subdivision is part of a math problem.\nYou think the stock market has a fence around it.\nThe fifth grade is referred to as \"your senior year.\"\nDuring your senior year you and your mother had homeroom\ntogether.\nIdiocy--rooted in an innate deficiency and a lack of educa-\ntional attainment--is the common theme in this humor. This\nlack of intelligence and common sense produces and then is\nreinforced by poor parenting skills on the part of both red-\nneck mother and father. As explored in the previous section,\nthe redneck woman is constructed as a danger to the tradi-\ntional family because she is overly masculine, uses alcohol\nand tobacco, is potentially violent and/or criminal, and lacks\nacceptable parenting skills. We see such themes recurring in\njokes more specifically targeting redneck parenting skills.\nYou might be a redneck if:\nYour kids take a siphon hose to \"Show and Tell.\"\nYour kids are going hungry tonight because you just had to have\nthose Yosemite Sam mudflaps.\nYour father encourages you to quit school because Larry has an\nopening on the lube rack.\nRedneck degeneracy is understood as the natural outcome\nof limited parenting skills, intelligence, and education, cou-\npled with cultural primitiveness and baseness. This in turn\njustifies the low status and poverty associated with redneck\nidentity. The social construction of rural Whites as degener-\nate is not a new phenomenon. Many of the pollution codes in\nthis humor that are used to construct the image of the degen-\nerate redneck are similar to the pollution codes used to con-\nstruct the image of the dangerous rural White during the\neugenics era. This stigmatized identity was infused into\nmainstream White understanding of the rural White Other.\nDiscussion\nI have offered a semiotics-inspired narrative analysis of the\nsocial construction of rednecks in Foxworthy and Foxworthy-\ninspired humor. I conducted this narrative analysis with a\nfocus on three interrelated research questions. First, how is\nthis concept redneck defined according to this humor?\nSecond, in the process of defining redneck identity, how are\nthe boundaries between redneck/non-redneck being negoti-\nated? Last, does the rhetorical boundary redneck help us\nunderstand the production and maintenance of normative,\nmainstream whiteness? This humor uses pollution codes to\nconstruct redneck identity as degenerate and primitive.\nPollution codes such as cleanliness/dirtiness, civilized/\nuncivilized, ordered/unordered, and moral/immoral establish\nthe boundaries necessary to articulate how rednecks exist on\nthe \"outside,\" in conflict with mainstream, White American\nmiddle-class identity. The boundary between the redneck\nand the non-redneck is at times a complex, porous fault-line\nthat defines a normative whiteness by using pollution codes\nto stigmatize White outsiders through the use of humor. By\nconstructing this boundary between the redneck/non-redneck\nand marking redneck identity as polluted this more norma-\ntive, mainstream whiteness is insulated and protected from\nintra-racial threats. For example, the very existence of poor\nrural Whites threatens any lingering attitudes of White\nsupremacy, and therefore, these poor rural Whites must be\naccounted for and their social condition justified. Likewise, a\npersistent underclass of poor rural Whites challenge cher-\nished notions of American individualism and meritocracy,\nand therefore, the existence of a persistent underclass must\nbe explained away with behavioral or biological factors.\nFinally, enduring institutional racism also threatensAmerican\nindividualism and meritocracy, and therefore, redneck iden-\ntity serves as a necessary scapegoat for many Whites who try\nto reconcile a \"color-blind\" society (Bonilla-Silva, 2003)\nwith the continuing existence of racism in the United States.\nIn the end, the most striking and profound means of pol-\nluting redneck identity in this humor comes by way of the\ncode culture/nature.\nThe line demarcating culture/nature, and the association\nof poor rural Whites with nature, is an old association. For\nexample, a series of studies in the early 20th century by the\nU.S. Eugenics Records Office (ERO) sought to demonstrate\nscientifically that a large number of rural Whites were genet-\nically defective (Wray & Newitz, 1997). This eugenics\nmovement was perhaps the most influential outgrowth of\nSocial Darwinism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries\nand greatly influenced social policy and popular attitudes\n\"The Jukes\" and \"The Kallikaks\" entered popular culture to\nillustrate the poor, dirty, alcoholic, and criminally and sexu-\nally perverse nature of many rural people (Wray & Newitz,\ncentury interpreted the White underclass as either a direct\nrevolt against, or simply the lack of, civilization (Hartigan,\ndeficiencies of rural society they supported \"aggressive\ninterventions to stop further declines in the quantity and\neugenics ideology, the concept of biological \"fitness\" was\nassociated with class and status distinctions, so that poor\ngene pool quality created a discernable qualitative difference\nbetween urban and rural people (McReynolds, 1997, pp.\nand the White underclass represented a racial poison threat-\nening both the purity of the White race as well as modernity\nitself (Hartigan, 2005). Stereotypes of rural poor Whites as\nincestuous and sexually promiscuous, violent, alcoholic,\nlazy, and stupid remain to this day (Wray & Newitz, 1997, p.\n2). While during the eugenics era the degeneracy of poor\nrural Whites threatened the legitimacy of White supremacy\nand the perceived future of the White race, today poor rural\nWhites continue to serve as instruments in the construction\nof a mainstream, middle-class whiteness. Today, redneck\nhumor is infused with pollution codes that create social dis-\ntance between the redneck/non-redneck rooted in these\nbodily and behavioral distinctions. These pollution codes are\nthe practical work of boundary production, and although the\noutcome of their use is less \"dangerous\" to poor rural Whites\nthan during the eugenics era, they still signify a process of\nintra-racial othering within White identity formation. Over\nthe course of the 20th century, the response to poor rural\nWhites who threatened modernity and its normative, White\nmiddle-class identity went from a project of forced steriliza-\ntion to a humor industry.\nConclusion\nI have argued that Foxworthy's redneck humor helps police\nthe boundaries of mainstream American whiteness by target-\ning and polluting the redneck other. However, like much\ncomplex social phenomena, humor can serve multiple, some-\ntimes contradictory functions simultaneously (Meyer, 2000).\nAlthough beyond the scope of this article, an interesting\nquestion to consider is what other functions might this humor\nserve? Can it be viewed as transformative or even libera-\ntional for rural White Americans? Can it provide ample\nsocial room to introduce \"play\" into the social imaginary,\nallowing serious social issues to be addressed in non-threat-\nening ways? The fact that this humor is often predicated not\non content, but explicitly on excess, might actually be the\nvehicle by which it can be viewed as liberating to rural\nAmericans, as they can be assured that their \"moderation\"\nsaves them from potential stigmatization. Perhaps this humor\neven serves to alleviate the status anxiety of upwardly mobile\nrural Americans? Although these questions are outside of the\npurview of this particular analysis, they all provide interest-\ning potential avenues for future research into redneck humor.\nIn conclusion, my analysis adds to the literature exploring\nthe stratified terrain of whiteness via a novel analysis of pol-\nlution codes imbedded in Foxworthy redneck humor. Lahiji\nand Friedman (1997) argue that modernity emerges from the\nbelief that man is fundamentally a clean body. Accordingly,\nthe pre-modern man is an unclean body. I argue the rhetorical\nboundary demarcating the redneck from the non-redneck is,\nin the end, the line between a modern, middle-class whiteness\nand a pre-modern White rusticity. We see references to the\npoor breeding habits of individuals who live in rural areas.\nSexual and gendered deviance lays the groundwork for dys-\nfunctional families that in turn reinforce immoral and trashy\nbehavior. In this way, a normative, mainstream whiteness is\nco-constructed alongside redneck degeneracy by targeting the\nredneck as a White Other. This White outsider fails to live up\nto the socio-cultural expectations of modern American white-\nness, thus distinguishing and protecting modern American\nwhiteness from intra-racial threats to its normative identity.\nThe boundaries between rednecks and non-rednecks call into\nquestion the popular assumption that White identity is a\nhomogeneous identity, constructed solely in opposition to\n2003). Instead, whiteness is also constructed in opposition to\n\"redness\" (Jarosz & Lawson, 2002), a status identity coupled\nwith those negative characteristics associated with pre-mod-\nern rusticity.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nArnesen, E.
