This study assesses unemployment rates among individuals with mental health problems before and during the current\neconomic recession.\nMethods: Using individual and aggregate level data collected from 27 EU countries in the Eurobarometer surveys of 2006\nand 2010, we examined changes in unemployment rates over this period among individuals with and without mental\nhealth problems.\nResults: Following the onset of the recession, the gap in unemployment rates between individuals with and without mental\nhealth problems significantly widened (odds ratio: 1.12, 95% confidence interval: 1.03, 1.34). This disparity became even\ngreater for males, and individuals with low levels of education. Individuals with mental health problems living in countries\nwith higher levels of stigmatizing attitudes regarding dangerousness of people with mental illness were more vulnerable to\nunemployment in 2010, but not 2006. Greater agreement that people with mental health problems have themselves to\nblame, was associated with lower likelihood of unemployment for individuals with and without mental health problems.\nConclusion: These findings study suggest that times of economic hardship may intensify social exclusion of people with\nmental health problems, especially males and individuals with lower education. Interventions to combat economic\nexclusion and to promote social participation of individuals with mental health problems are even more important during\ntimes of economic crisis, and these efforts should target support to the most vulnerable groups.\nCitation: Evans-Lacko S, Knapp M, McCrone P, Thornicroft G, Mojtabai R (2013) The Mental Health Consequences of the Recession: Economic Hardship and\nEditor: Randen Lee Patterson, UC Davis School of Medicine, United States of America\nCopyright: \u00df 2013 Evans-Lacko et al.

Unemployment has an impact upon the course\nand outcome of mental illness [7] and excludes individuals from\nsocial participation. A period of macro-economic recession may be\nparticularly difficult for people with mental health problems as\nthey may be at higher risk of losing their jobs and more\ncompetitive labour market conditions may make it more difficult\nfor them to find a new job in the first place [8]. This is especially\nimportant as research suggests that unemployment could present a\nspecific barrier to recovery from mental illness [9,10].\nUnemployment among people with mental illness may be\naggravated during times of economic hardship [7,11,12]. Negative\nattitudes towards marginalized groups (e.g., ethnic minorities or\nimmigrant groups) which often increase during an economic\nrecession [13] are one possible factor influencing this trend.\nRecent research from Germany suggests that the German public's\nunwillingness to recommend an individual with depression for a\nshowed improvements and declines which mirrored the economic\nand employment context of the country [7]. Findings regarding\nthe impact of economic recession on disparities [15] and the\nmechanisms involved, however, are mixed [15\u00ad18] and we need to\nbetter understand the complexity of this relationship. Interestingly,\none study [16] did not show that individuals with severe mental\nillness were at earlier risk of unemployment during times of\neconomic contraction; however, this study specifically investigated\nindividuals with severe mental illness who received occupational\nrehabilitation services and these results may not be broadly\ngeneralizable to the wider population of people with mental illness.\nFurthermore, the effects of the recession since 2008 on disparities\nare yet to be determined.\nIn addition to research which suggests that mental health\nproblems increase during times of economic recession, we\ninvestigate the impact of the economic recession on people with\nmental health problems and how this may be mediated by stigma.\nThis paper investigates the impact of economic hardship on\nunemployment rates of people with mental health problems using\nEurobarometer survey data collected from 27 EU countries in\neconomic crisis since 2008 has had a greater impact on\nemployment of people with mental health problems compared\nto people without mental health problems. We also hypothesise\nthat the impact on individuals with mental health problems is\ngreater for people living in regions with greater public stigma\ntowards people with mental illness, after controlling for regional\nunemployment rates. Additionally, as some research suggests that\ncertain population subgroups, such as men or individuals with low\nlevels of education [19], may be particularly vulnerable during\ntimes of economic recession, we investigate whether there is a\ndifferential impact of the recession on these subgroups in relation\nto unemployment.\nMaterials and Methods\nData Source\nFull details of the design and sampling for the Eurobarometer\nsurveys (Eurobarometer Mental Well-being 2006 and Eurobarometer\ncollected via face-to-face interviews among European Union (EU)\n27 member states (approximately 1,000 individuals per country\nper year). For our analysis we restricted the sample to adults of\nThe initial mental health Eurobarometer survey was conducted\nJanuary 2006). A second survey assessing attitudes toward mental\nillness and treatment-seeking was administered to a new sample of\nAll participants were recruited via multistage random probability\nsampling. Participants were representative of residents aged 15 or\nolder in the participating countries.\nAssessments\nMental health problems were assessed via the Mental Health\nInventory (MHI-5), a well-validated and reliable measure derived\nhas not been established for the MHI-5 [22], for the purposes of\nthis study, individuals scoring one standard deviation higher than\nthe standardised mean score were categorised as having mental\nhealth problems.\nStigmatising attitudes towards individuals with mental health\nproblems were assessed in Eurobarometer 2006 using four\nquestions about various stigmatizing beliefs: (1) People with\npsychological or emotional health problems constitute a danger\nto others; (2) People with psychological or emotional health\nproblems are unpredictable; (3) People with psychological or\nemotional health problems have themselves to blame and (4)\nPeople with psychological or emotional health problems never\nrecover. Participants were asked how much they agreed with each\nstatement. Response options were on a 4-point Likert scale from\n`totally disagree' to `totally agree'. Participants who responded\n`totally agree' or `tend to agree' to each statement were considered\nas agreeing with that statement. Responses were aggregated within\neach country to obtain a country-level measure of stigmatizing\nattitudes.\nindividuals finished full-time education), and urbanicity (i.e., size of\nlocality of respondent residence: large town, small or middle sized\ntown or rural area/village). Current employment was assessed via\nthe question: `What is your current occupation?' Individuals could\nendorse the following categories: (1) responsible for ordinary\nshopping and looking after the home, or without any current\noccupation, not working (referred to throughout the paper as\n`home-maker'), (2) student, (3) unemployed or temporarily not\nworking, (4) retired or unable to work through illness, or (5) in paid\nemployment.\nNational level unemployment rates\nwere taken from the Eurostat yearbook (http://epp.eurostat.ec.\neuropa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/ Europe_in_figures_-\n_Eurostat_yearbook). Eurostat is a Directorate-General of the\nEuropean Commission and the statistical office of the European\nUnion. The Eurostat figures for 2006 were moderately highly\ncorrelated with the national unemployment rates calculated from\nStatistical Analysis\nFour separate multivariable logistic regression models were used\nto examine predictors of unemployment for individuals with and\nvariables included age, gender, urbanicity, country-level attitudes\nregarding dangerousness, recovery, blameworthiness, and unpre-\ndictability of people with mental illness. Country-level variables\nwere computed as an average rating for each country and each\nvariable was standardized. Eurobarometer post-stratification\nweights, based on sex, age, region and size of locality, were used\nin all analyses to estimate the country-level averages. We used\ngeneralized estimating equations (GEE) with the robust variance\nestimates to model within-country correlations. In the absence of\ntheoretical reasons for specifying a correlation matrix structure, we\nused an unstructured correlation matrix [24]. In order to\ninvestigate whether individual unemployment status differed by\npopulation subgroups of interest (i.e., men, individuals with low\nlevels of education and younger individuals) following the\nrecession, we first tested the interaction between survey year and\nthese variables and then tested a three-way interaction between\nsurvey year, mental health problems and these variables. All\nanalyses were carried out using SAS version 9.3.\nMental Health Consequences of the Recession\nEthics statement\nEthical approval was not required as this was secondary data\nanalysis.\nResults\nSocio-demographic characteristics (Table 1)\nCompared to individuals without mental health problems,\nindividuals with mental health problems were disproportionately\nwith and without mental health problems had completed\neducation at least to 16 years of age; however, more of those\nwithout mental health problems finished education at age 20+ or\npeople with mental health problems had no formal education or\nIndividuals with mental health problems were less likely to be in\npaid employment or to be a student or home-makers and more\nlikely to be unemployed or disabled/retired, (x2 = 452.6, df = 4,\nTrends in unemployment among people with mental\nhealth problems\nUnemployment rates were higher among people with mental\nhealth problems compared to those without in both survey years\n(Table 1). Overall unemployment rates were also higher in 2010\ncompared to 2006. The gap in unemployment rates between\nindividuals with and without mental health problems widened in\nstatistically significant (odds ratio [OR] for the interaction term for\nmental health problems by year = 1.12, 95% confidence interval\n[CI]: 1.03, 1.34. We performed several types of sensitivity analyses\nto test the robustness of this relationship. We investigated\nadditional cutpoints for individuals scoring in the top ten and\nthe top five percent of mental health problems and their likelihood\nof unemployment relative to the rest of the population. The\ndifferential trend was also statistically significant for these groups:\nthe p-value for the interaction term for mental health problems by\nyear for the top ten percent was 0.020 and the top five percent was\n0.018. We also conducted additional sensitivity analyses applying\nan instrumental variable approach in which individual mental\nhealth problems were considered to be endogenous to the model\nand this also showed a significant relationship and the interaction\nterm for year and mental health problems was also significant\nRelationship between unemployment and mental health\nstatus\nIn each of the survey years, local unemployment rates\nascertained by Eurostat were strongly associated with the odds\nof being unemployed among participants both with and without\nmental health problems in Eurobarometer (Table 2).

However, age patterns of unemployment in\nboth survey years varied among those with and without mental\nhealth problems in that the younger age was more strongly\nassociated with unemployment among those without mental\nhealth problems (p,0.001). Indeed, the unemployed with mental\nhealth problems were significantly older than those without mental\nFewer years of education was significantly associated with\nunemployment among individuals with and without mental health\nproblems; however, education was more strongly associated with\nunemployment among individuals with mental health problems\ncompared to those without these problems (p = 0.001).

This interaction was also significant\namong the entire sample (p = 0.020), but not among those without\nmental health problems.\nUrbanicity (i.e., size of the town where participants were\nrecruited) did not play a major role in likelihood of unemployment\nexcept that individuals with mental health problems who lived in a\nlarge town relative to a rural area were more likely to be\nunemployed (Table 2), which could be interpreted as implying that\na larger labour market disadvantages those with mental health\nproblems.\nhealth problems only, living in a country where a higher proportion\nof the general public agreed that people with mental health\nproblems are dangerous was associated with a higher likelihood of\nbeing unemployed (Table 2). During 2006, individuals with mental\nhealth problems living in a country where a lower proportion of the\ngeneral public agreed that people with mental health problems\nhave themselves to blame were more likely to be unemployed.\nThis relationship was maintained in 2010. Living in a country\nwhere a higher proportion of the general public agreed that people\nwith mental health problems will never recover was associated\nwith a marginally higher likelihood of being unemployed among\nindividuals with mental health problems (p = 0.097).\nDiscussion\nEconomic recession has had enormous impacts across much of\nEurope; however, little information is available about the specific\nimpact of the recession on groups who are already vulnerable to\nsocial exclusion, specifically individuals with mental illness. This is\nthe first study to demonstrate that the European economic crisis\nhad a greater impact on people with mental health problems,\ncompared to people without mental health problems, as measured\nby exclusion from employment. Our study also identified\nimportant sub-groups which experienced greater impacts of the\neconomic recession in terms of unemployment, specifically men\nand individuals with low levels of education. Overall, males and\nindividuals with lower levels of education appear to have been\naffected disproportionately by the recession; both groups had a\nsignificantly greater increase in likelihood of being unemployed\nfollowing the recession. Moreover, for individuals with mental\nMental Health Consequences of the Recession\nTable 1.

This may be due to shifts in labour markets: other\nstudies have suggested that men may be more vulnerable to\nunemployment during the current recession in Europe as they are\nmore likely to work in construction and manufacturing jobs which\nare more vulnerable to decreases in demand and job loss [25],\nwhile other research suggests that this disparity is only evident\nduring the initial stages of a recession [11].\nThis study also showed that stigmatizing attitudes, specifically\nbeliefs regarding dangerousness of individuals with mental health\nproblems, could be an important mediator in the relationship\nbetween unemployment and mental health problems following the\nrecession. Living in a country where a higher proportion of\nindividuals believe that individuals with mental illness are\ndangerous was associated with a higher likelihood of unemploy-\nment for people with mental health problems, but did not\ninfluence employment rates for those without mental health\nproblems. Moreover, this became significant in 2010, following\nthe economic recession. Other studies have emphasised the\npersistence of attitudes related to dangerousness and their\nassociation with community rejection [26]. Research on racial\ndiscrimination suggests that stereotype amplification in relation to\nrisk and fear of victimisation plays an important role in the\nFigure 1.

A recent\nanalysis of trends in public attitudes toward people with mental\nhealth problems in England and older research from the U.S. also\nsuggested that attitudes to people with mental health problems\nmay harden during periods of economic crisis [7,29]; however,\nthere is a gap in research around this topic. Surprisingly, a higher\nproportion of the public endorsing blameworthiness was consis-\ntently associated with lower rates of unemployment among people\nwith mental health problems. Previous research has found that\nstigmatizing attitudes are highly specific in their relation to impact\non people with mental health problems. For example, living in a\ncommunity with stronger beliefs about blameworthiness of\nindividuals with mental illness is associated with lower rates of\nwillingness to seek professional help [30] but also lower levels of\nperceived discrimination among people with mental health\nproblems [31]. Other research has shown that world views such\nas stronger just world beliefs for self may be a double edged sword\nas they are associated with greater blameworthiness; but also lower\nself stigma among people with mental illness [32]. It could be that\nenvironments with greater endorsement of blame and controlla-\nbility of symptoms and/or illness also engender a context where\nthe guilt and blame associated with those who are not working is\nincreased. Thus, any intervention would need to carefully consider\nthe complexity of cultural factors and beliefs underlying individual\nand public attitudes.\nPrevious studies have demonstrated the impact of the recession\non public health more generally [33\u00ad35], however, the selective\nimpact of recession on people with mental health problems,\nespecially males or individuals with lower levels of education,\nshould be acknowledged through both research and policy.\nAnalysis of general government policy responses in Europe\nfollowing the crisis reveals deficiencies and problems and suggests\nthat governments should allocate resources toward keeping and\nreintegrating people into employment in addition to initiating\nprogrammes that help people cope with the negative effects of job\nloss to counteract the adverse health effects of the recession [33].\nHighlighting the population subgroups who are most vulnerable to\neconomic shocks and identifying ways to mitigate the effects of\nthese shocks is also important. It may be that investment in\ntargeted programmes such as debt advice for people with mental\nhealth problems may improve their mental health and financial\ncircumstances [36,37]. Given the cuts in mental health services\nacross Europe, the impact of the recession is likely to be felt among\na growing number of individuals alongside dwindling resources.\nLack of resources may strain mental health services during times of\nhigher need leading to decreased access in the face of increased\nneed. In Spain where the impact of the recent recession has been\namong the greatest, the prevalence of mental disorders diagnosed\nin primary care settings is increasing. These increases are\nassociated with increases in unemployment and also present\namong individuals whose employment is threatened and also those\nwho are struggling to make payments on their mortgage [38].\nRecent findings from both England and Spain suggest that the\nrecession is associated with a deterioration in population mental\nhealth [19,38]. In addition to people with mental health problems\ngenerally, it is important to acknowledge specific subgroups with\nmental health problems, such as males and those with lower\neducation. In addition to having a higher likelihood of unemploy-\nment, these subgroups have lower rates of help-seeking and more\nnegative attitudes about mental illness [29,39] and thus, may\nrequire specific forms of outreach.\nLimitations\nThis study presents new and important information about the\nimpact of macroeconomic downturn on people with and without\nmental health problems in Europe using nationally representative\ndata from 27 countries in Europe surveyed over two time points,\nbefore and after the onset of the current recession. Nevertheless,\nthe data were not collected with the specific aims of this study in\nmind and were not longitudinal in nature as the same individuals\nwere not interviewed in the two surveys. Mental health status was\ndetermined via a brief self-report measure and thus mental health\nproblems were not verified by a clinician. Additionally, type and\nseverity of problems were not assessed. Most previous research on\nemployment of individuals with mental health problems and also\non mental illness stigma has focused on those with severe mental\ndisorders which could not be identified in the Eurobarometer data.\nAdditionally, data on potentially important characteristics such as\nethnicity and immigration status or survey response rates were not\navailable. The investigation was limited to two time points only\nand although the impact of economic recession was clearly evident\nin 2010, long term effects could not be investigated. Relatedly, as\nthese are observational data, our analyses could not rule out\nreverse causality, and the potential that people who were\nunemployed were more likely to develop mental health problems\nin 2010. Other research has suggested that a large proportion of\nthe consequences of unemployment such as mortality are due to\nmental health related selection prior to becoming unemployed\n[40] suggesting that this is an important mechanism to investigate.\nOur main outcome of interest was unemployment; however, there\nmay be other important effects of the economic crisis in terms of\nsocial exclusion which we were not able to examine. As\nEurobarometer recruited individuals by household, we were not\nable to investigate individuals who may have transitioned into\nmore extreme types of exclusion i.e., individuals who became\nhomeless, were in care or hospital settings or were imprisoned.\nFinally, attitudes about people with mental illness were only\ncollected at one time point in 2006 which precludes assessment of\nchanges in public attitudes over time and its potential impact on\nunemployment trends. However, the assessment of attitudes\npreceded the economic crisis and so was not confounded by the\neffects of the recession.\nPast research has consistently shown that people with mental\nhealth problems tend to be excluded from employment, housing\nand social relationships, and that this exclusion has negative social\nand economic consequences [8]. This study suggests that times of\neconomic hardship are likely to heighten such exclusion for people\nwith mental health problems. The study also provides some\npreliminary clues as to which groups of individuals with mental\nhealth problems are especially vulnerable during times of\neconomic hardship, and what societal factors might moderate this\nadverse relationship. Use of both individual-level and aggregate-\nlevel data to explore this relationship provides new and important\nevidence about the impact of the macro-social context on\nindividuals during times of economic recession and facilitates\nmicro-macro research in relation to mental health and exclusion\n[41,42]. Findings suggest that programmes to combat exclusion\nand to promote mental health may be more important during\ntimes of economic crisis. Future research should examine the long\nterm effects of the economic recession on people with mental\nhealth problems and the relationship between different types of\nemployment and social welfare policies and unemployment rates\nfor people with mental health problems.\nMental Health Consequences of the Recession\n"
