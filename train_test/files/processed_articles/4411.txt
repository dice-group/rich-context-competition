What follows is a detailed\ncase study of the implementation of a victim\u00adoffender\nmediation pilot program. The impetus for this project, as\nwell as the sustained effort to achieve the desired outcome\nwas provided by the Restorative Justice Coalition of West\nMichigan (RJCWM).\nAs a case study, this research offers an inside look into the\nprocess of moving restorative justice theory into practice.\nThe authors describe the implementation process from the\nearly stages of planning through implementation. Presented\nin a chronological fashion, the authors explore the many\nchallenges faced throughout the process. Major obstacles\ninclude a lack of support from key stakeholders within the\ncriminal justice system, misconceptions surrounding the phi-\nlosophy of restorative justice, securing program funding, and\nstability of leadership among the implementation team.\nAlthough the campaign to implement a pilot program in\nrestorative justice was ultimately successful, the final prod-\nuct was far removed from the original vision of RJCWM.\nRestorative Justice\nRestorative justice continues to slowly emerge as an alterna-\ntive to the more familiar forms of retributive justice in the\nUnited States. While restorative justice has roots in antiquity\n(Braithwaite, 2002), and continues to serve as one of several\ncompeting philosophies of crime and justice in numerous\ncountries throughout the world (Van Ness & Strong, 2002), it\nhas been adopted in the United States in a limited and at best\npiecemeal fashion. This landscape is largely due to the real-\nity that restorative justice represents a major shift in both\nphilosophy and practice within the United States.\nUnder the current, retribution-based, criminal justice sys-\ntem, the main focus is on determining guilt and dispensing\npunishments. A criminal act is, by definition, a crime against\nthe state (Lemley & Russell, 2002). Unlike the retributive\nmodel, restorative justice defines crimes by the harms cre-\nated. The focus of restorative justice is to repair the harm\ncaused by crime, making victims whole, holding offenders\naccountable, and preventing the occurrence of similar harms\nA popular definition offered by Tony Marshall (1996)\nstates that restorative justice is \"a process whereby all the\nparties with a stake in a particular offence come together to\nresolve collectively how to deal with the aftermath of the\noffence and its implications for the future\" (p. 37). The pro-\ncess begins with the realization that crime signifies injury.\nOne goal, then, of restorative justice is to repair that injury, to\n1Grand Valley State University, Grand Rapids, MI, USA\n2Calvin College, Grand Rapids, MI, USA\n3Aquinas College, Grand Rapids, MI, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nPatrick Gerkin, Grand Valley State University, 401 W.

Victim(s) and offender(s), along\nwith other interested parties take part in a process of healing\nthe injury experienced by the victim (Roche, 2003). Victims\nand offenders are, ideally, participants. They are given a\ndegree of ownership in deciding an appropriate response to\nthe harm created by the offender's actions. Restorative jus-\ntice affords victims, offenders, and the community an oppor-\ntunity to participate in creating justice, allowing them to\ninsert their voice and regain a sense of control in their lives.\nMediation\nThe words \"restorative justice\" are used as an umbrella term\nto describe a variety of programs that view crime and the\nresponse to crime through a restorative lens (Zehr, 1990).\nSuch programs include victim\u00adoffender mediation, family\ngroup conferencing, community reparative boards, sentenc-\ning circles, and sentencing panels.\nThe first victim\u00adoffender mediation program emerged in\n\"victims and offenders the opportunity to meet one another\nwith the assistance of a trained mediator to talk about the\ncrime and come to an agreement on steps toward justice\"\nvictims were largely ignored by the criminal justice system.\nHowever, beginning in the 1970s, the victims' rights move-\nment began to push for greater victim participation in the\njustice process (Daigle & Muftic, 2016). It is no coincidence\nthat restorative practices such as mediation emerged during\nthis period.\nMediation, in accordance with the principles of restor-\native justice, seeks to maximize victim participation in the\nprocess of achieving justice. Through mediation, the parties\nmost directly affected by the harm (victims, offenders, and\nthe community) gather in search of healing, restoration,\naccountability, and prevention (Zehr & Mika, 1998). The\nmediation process is guided by a trained facilitator whose job\nit is to help the participants resolve the situation and to repair\nthe harm experienced by the victim. The mediator is there to\nassist the parties in making their own decisions about how to\nrepair the harm. He or she is not there to make these deci-\nsions for the parties.\nOne tangible outcome of a victim\u00adoffender mediation is a\nwritten agreement between the parties about how the harm\nwill be repaired. Victims play a central role in the creation of\nthe agreement, and offenders participate as well (Daigle &\nMuftic, 2016). Thus, the participants themselves become the\nowners of the justice process and its outcomes.\nThis stands in stark contrast to the offender-centric and\nstate-dominated criminal justice system that routinely disem-\npowers both victims and offenders as the state defines what\njustice should be (Zehr, 2013). This system is the result of a\nmajor paradigm shift that moved justice out of the commu-\nnity and into a state-run, rights-based model (Van Ness,\n1990). Restorative justice is part of a movement that hopes to\nshift some of the ownership in resolving these matters back\nto the primary stakeholders.\nOverall, restorative justice represents a clear shift in phi-\nlosophy and practice. Restorative justice places victims at\nthe center of the process rather than offenders. Instead of a\nfocus on determining guilt and dispensing punishments to\noffenders, restorative justice seeks to repair the harm caused\nby crime and prevent similar harms in the future (Zehr,\n2013). These were the philosophical underpinnings that\ngrounded the attempt to design and implement the pilot pro-\ngram in restorative justice described herein.\nThe Beginning\nFast Track Accountability Program (FTAP) was a pilot pro-\ngram implemented in 2010 within a Midwestern city of\nAccording to the U.S. Census, the city is composed of 59%\nnon-Hispanic Whites, 20%AfricanAmerican, 15% Hispanic/\nLatino, and 2% Asian (U.S. Census Bureau, 2015b). The\nincluding some 26% living below the poverty line (U.S.\nmore than 4,000 misdemeanor warrants authorized by the\nIn the case in question, the attempt to integrate restorative\nprinciples into a meaningful program came out of a group of\ncommunity advocates that banded together to form a restor-\native justice coalition. Ultimately the group settled on the\nname RJCWM. The organic grassroots beginnings of this\ngroup mirrored the philosophical ideal that restorative prac-\ntices should emerge from the communities, themselves,\nrather than being imposed from high-powered leaders\n(Hopkins, 2004). At the same time, the role of strong leader-\nship in the formation and maturation of this coalition cannot\nbe underestimated. Without the benefits afforded by the rela-\ntionships fostered and developed by its early leaders, FTAP\nwould never have reached the implementation stage.\nAlthough the groundswell for a restorative justice pro-\ngram ideally comes from the community itself, the reality of\na bureaucracy instituted to uphold a retributive approach\nnecessitates a pragmatic approach that requires the active\nassistance of high-powered leaders. In the case in question,\nthat high-powered leader was a City Commissioner.\nThe early planners included a rather diverse group of peo-\nple. Among the early members of RJCWM, there was a core\ngroup of local-level politicians, neighborhood association\nleaders, college professors, religious leaders, criminal justice\nreformers, and interested citizens. Virtually all of them were\nbrought to the table at the request of a City Commissioner\nwho once remarked that he would talk to anyone who would\nlisten and that he intentionally cast a wide net and hoped\nsome people would \"stick around\" (D. LaGrand, personal\nGerkin et al. 3\nIn retrospect, the early planners and designers echoed\nthemes identified by O'Conner (1997), who suggested that a\nkey to the success of restorative justice programs is leader-\nship that recognizes the unique environmental and social fac-\ntors that must be accounted for to facilitate development. The\nCommissioner's experiences in prosecution and private\npractice gave him insight into the environmental and social\nfactors at work in the local justice system.\nProgram Design\nThe City Attorney's office was identified as the gatekeeper to\nthe program. This was a strategic decision on behalf of the\nleadership of RJCWM. Other \"diversion\" programs had their\ninception within the state of Michigan's 61st District Court,\nmost notably the Drug and Sobriety Court founded in 1999 by\nJudge Patrick Bowler. In a similar manner to FTAP, the 61st\ndistricts'Drug Court emerged largely as the vision of one man.\nAs 61st Court administrator Josef Soper observed, \"[t]he fact\nof the matter is that programs such as drug courts are created\nbecause people in a position to implement them, do\" (Soper,\n2006). The decision to begin FTAPfrom outside the Court was\nguided largely by the fact that the City Attorney shared the\nCommissioner's vision, and the judges were less enthused.\nThe lack of enthusiasm on the judges' part was a point of\nmuch discussion in early planning meetings. The issue was\ndiscussed at numerous board meetings of RJCWM. The gen-\neral consensus of the board was that this program would\nnever be successful without the court's support. There would\nbe no cases to handle.\nDiscussion with officials at the 61st District Court indi-\ncated that the primary concern from the judges was one of\ncost. Once a defendant is charged with a crime, an automatic\ntimetable is set in motion with the court. To keep a case on\ntrack, the Court had no choice but to route individuals\nthrough both the current system and FTAP at the same time.\nIn cases where the offender did not fulfill his or her agree-\nment/contract, traditional court processing was the fallback.\nWhen offenders did fulfill his or her contract, charges were\ndismissed, and the Court had no avenue to assess fees and\ncosts that would normally offset the costs of all the pretrial\nwork. Thus, from the Court's perspective, FTAP represented\na cost with no possibility of recoupment. (See section titled\n\"Discussion\" for further consideration of this issue.)\nGiven the less than enthusiastic response from the judges,\nand the apparent interest of the City Attorney, the City\nAttorney's office became the obvious choice. Following a\npolice report, the City Attorney's office approves a misde-\nmeanor charge or warrant authorization. This initial step at\nthe City Attorney's office was also selected as an ideal point\nto screen out individuals who did not meet certain criteria for\nThe City Attorney's office stipulated that all eligible par-\nticipants would be adults who were arrested for misdemean-\nors where the maximum possible penalty did not exceed 1\nyear in jail. The three categories specifically targeted were\nremoving property not your own1 (commonly referred to as\nshoplifting), malicious destruction of property2 (MDOP),\nand meddling and tampering.3 Both removing property and\nMDOP are charged as misdemeanors, when the value of the\nproperty or the amount of the destruction or injury, respec-\ntively, is less than US$200.00. Under the current system, per-\nsons found guilty of these offenses are punishable by\nimprisonment for not more than 93 days and/or a fine of not\nwhichever is greater. The logic behind selecting these three\nparticular crimes was that they constituted the low hanging\nfruit for the 61st District. On average, there were approxi-\nmately 500 such cases each year in the 61st District Court.\nThere were a few additional stipulations put in place by\nthe City Attorney's office. Those eligible for the program\nincluded only those who pleaded not guilty at their arraign-\nment. Additional eligibility criteria set forth by the City\nAttorney included not being charged with an associated fel-\nony or violent misdemeanor. However, prior convictions of\nany kind would not prevent offenders from being eligible to\nparticipate.\nFTAP allowed offenders to have their charges appear as\n\"dismissed\" on their permanent record if they conceded to\nentering into mediation, negotiating a contract with the vic-\ntim, and fulfilling that contract. In other words, this program\nfunctioned as a diversion for eligible participants. Contracts\nfor the program needed to meet basic criteria established by\nthe City Attorney, including a sincere apology, full restitu-\ntion, and at least 20 hr of community service.\nProgram designers, optimistically hoping for room to\nnegotiate, raised several concerns. First, they expressed a\ndesire to cast a wider net, but found little room for negotia-\ntions with the City Attorney's office. Second, program\ndesigners pushed back against the agreement requirements,\nexplaining that the participants should have the freedom to\ncreate the stipulations put forth in the agreement, and noted\nthat although an apology was ideal, a forced or insincere\napology can actually lead to revictimization. Finally, pro-\ngram designers pushed back against the not guilty require-\nment. RJCWM took this as an opportunity to inform/educate\nthe practitioners about restorative principles, but again found\nlittle room for negotiations. In the end, the program design-\ners determined these were necessary concessions to keep\nthe pilot program moving forward. (See section titled\n\"Discussion\" for further consideration of this issue.)\nEligible individuals (hereafter referred to as offenders)\nwere to be contacted first and the program's nature and\nrequirements would be explained. Offenders were to be con-\ntacted for consent to participate before victims. This was\ndone to avoid revictimization by encouraging victims to par-\nticipate in a process only to find the offender unwilling. Only\nafter offenders agreed to participate were the victims to be\napproached. They too would receive an explanation of the\nprogram and would be invited to participate.\n4 SAGE Open\nThe City Commission approved US$60,000 for the proj-\nect from a Federal Justice Assistance Grant (JAG). The\nUS$60,000 was part of a larger grant received from the\nRecovery Act Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance\nGrant Program (Office of Justice Programs, 2009).\nFTAP benefitted enormously from the existence and\nexpertise of the Dispute Resolution Center (DRC). The DRC\nhad maintained a community victim\u00adoffender mediation\nprogram for 23 years prior to the start of the pilot program.\nThis meant that RJCWM did not have to create a program,\ntrain mediators, or find money for start-up costs. This enabled\nFTAP's design team to focus on expansion and integration\nwithin the judicial system rather than inception.\nBy the time of implementation, FTAP could best be\ndescribed as the result of a unique collaboration between the\nCity Attorney's office at the local District Court, the City\nCommission, a nascent nonprofit organization (RJCWM),\nand an established restorative justice nonprofit mediation\ncenter. The City Attorney's office functioned as a gatekeeper\nto the program; the District Court, somewhat reluctantly,\nallowed it as a diversion program. The City Commission pro-\nvided the funding, the coalition provided the idea, and the\nmediation center provided the actual service delivery. The\nprogram, at the point of implementation, was dramatically\ndifferent from the design RJCWM members had initially\nplanned. However, it did present an opportunity for the deliv-\nery of restorative justice to the public, and an opportunity for\nrestorative justice to prove that it could bring value to the\nadministration of justice.\nImplementation\nThe First 9 Months\nThe first 9 months spent establishing FTAP can be described\nas a period of education. Compared with the larger partisan\nState government, the City Commissioner's position afforded\nopportunities to affect change with less buy-in from other\nofficials. This was particularly true in the context of a city\nwith a weak mayoral system where more power rests with\nthe nonpartisan City Commission. Within the context of a\nseven-member commission, the City Commissioner needed\nonly three additional votes to move the restorative practices\nforward.\nAt this early stage, several key parameters for a successful\nprogram were identified. First, the program would need to be\nconceptually integrated into the existing judicial framework\nand it would need to be rigorously evaluated. This would\nrequire access to both the City Attorney's office and the 61st\nDistrict Court. The benefits of implementing restorative prac-\ntices would only be realized if the program was both philo-\nsophically guided and empirically supported. Satisfying\nvictims, holding offenders accountable, and engaging com-\nmunities may each contribute to a fairer system of justice, but\nwill likely do little to persuade entrenched criminal justice\npersonnel to adopt restorative practices (Hayes, 2007).\nMembers of RJCWM felt the most effective way to persuade\ngovernment officials would be to focus on the potential for\npositive economic benefits derived from the program. The\nemphasis on empirical evaluation was driven by a subcom-\nmittee of RJCWM that became known as the academic group.\nEarly on in the formation of RJCWM, participation was\nelicited from local colleges and universities' departments of\ncriminal justice, sociology, social work, and communication\nstudies. A core group of faculty from local universities\ncoalesced to mindfully consider how best to develop a pro-\ngram that could be evaluated with regard to the primary out-\ncomes of participant satisfaction, recidivism, and economic\nimpact. These outcomes are commonly found in evaluations\nof restorative programs (Latimer, Dowden, & Muise, 2001).\nThe second key to success was that the program should be\npresented to the community in a way that would encourage\nthe community to see value in the program. Proponents of\nthe restorative alternative are familiar with the need defend\nrestorative justice from the accusations that such programs\nare soft on crime (London, 2013). London describes this as\none of the challenges to restorative justice theory and prac-\ntice. He argues that proponents of restorative justice must\nreconcile \"its advocacy of a nonpunitive response to crime\nwith the public's insistence on deterrence and retribution\"\nFinally, the program needed to be sustainable. This meant\nsecuring funding and establishing a service provision struc-\nture that would perpetuate the program in the absence of its\ninitial leadership. In fact, this was the impetus for the entire\ncoalition. From his experiences with other victims' rights or\ncommunity mediation programs, the Commissioner believed\nthat any program would collapse without strong leadership.\nKeeping true to the restorative philosophy, the Commissioner\nset about cultivating interpersonal relationships guided by\nkey restorative values such as respect, individual dignity,\ninclusion, responsibility, humility, mutual care, reparation,\nand nondomination (Pranis, 2007). He routinely met with\nmembers of various constituencies (i.e., neighborhood asso-\nciations, police, judges, academics, service providers). It was\nhis hope that these individuals would help to sustain the pro-\ngram after his departure.\nIn developing relatively high-quality relationships, the\nprogram's leader charted a course guided by restorative val-\nues; yet, he remained concerned that his efforts to develop\nleader\u00admember relationships would devolve after his depar-\nture. He hoped that a partnership with the DRC would be a\nstabilizing factor in the case of his absence. The involvement\nof the DRC meant that there was a service delivery system in\nplace that was vested in sustaining these efforts.\nThe Second 9 Months: Clearing Obstacles\nThe second 9-month period was spent focusing on a few cru-\ncial elements of the program, including funding stability and\nGerkin et al. 5\nempirical evaluation. Prudently, these were not separate con-\nversations. Leadership, at this early stage, realized that\nalthough funding would hopefully be found to initiate a pilot\nprogram, any hope at sustaining that funding would need to\nbe tied to empirical evidence of effectiveness.\nIn this period, seed funding was secured through a local\ndenomination to pay a coordinator for 10 hr a week. She was\ncompensated to schedule meetings, compose email lists, and\norganize communications. Programs dependent on volun-\nteers to coordinate efforts have the potential to languish and\nslide into inaction. After the coordinator moved on, she was\nreplaced by a local attorney working with the DRC who pro-\nvided the consistency of communication and determination\nto pull together disparate elements and keep everything mov-\ning forward.\nMeanwhile, RJCWM began to openly recruit new mem-\nbers and elicit support for the cause of restorative justice.\nHow this initiative would manifest was still unclear.\nAccording to RJCWM meeting minutes, it was about this\ntime that meetings between coalition leaders, a retired judge,\nand the City Attorney and her staff began. Understanding\nwhat data were available from these stakeholders was a part\nof these discussions. With an eye toward the future, members\nof the academic group were already preparing for the evalu-\nation component.\nEvaluation\nEarly on in stakeholder meetings, it was discovered that the\ncity made almost no effort to obtain victim input data at all.\nInitially, it was thought that to demonstrate increases in vic-\ntim satisfaction, baseline data would need to be collected\nprior to program implementation. Eventually, and at the urg-\ning of the academic subcommittee of RJCWM board, this\nidea was done away with in favor of a pilot program design\nthat included both experimental and control groups.\nExamples of surveys were solicited from local dispute\nresolution organizations, academics, and restorative justice-\nbased programs in nearby cities such as Muskegon, Michigan,\nwhich had a well-established victim\u00adoffender mediation pro-\ngram. Over the following months, these surveys were revised\nto include quantitative measures on items such as fairness,\nrestitution, relationships between participants, satisfaction,\nand accountability. In addition, qualitative measures were\nincluded to assess mediator behaviors that facilitated (or\nfrustrated) mediation resolution, satisfaction, participant sin-\ncerity, fairness, and motivation for participation. The research\ninstruments were designed not only to demonstrate the suc-\ncess of restorative alternatives in satisfying participants,\nincreasing restitution, and reducing cost but also to begin to\narticulate clearer understandings of the how and why ques-\ntions that plague restorative justice research. Although sig-\nnificant positive results are observed in programs, what is\nless researched, and therefore less understood, is how and\nwhy restorative programs consistently produce those positive\nan area for further research, and the data currently being col-\nlected will hopefully add to this body of scholarship.\nEducation\nIt was approximately 3 months into this second 9-month\nperiod that RJCWM contacted the local newspaper and an\narticle about the proposed RJ pilot project appeared.\nAlthough this exposed a wider audience to the reality that\nsuch a program was being considered, reactions were mixed.\nIn an effort to define the scope of the program, RJCWM\ndescribed the program in several internal documents, and in\nthe article, as a program of the 61st District Court. Reaction\nfrom judges within the Court was swift and critical, as the\nCourt itself had little to do with the program's inception and\ndevelopment. (See section titled \"Discussion\" for further\nconsideration of this issue.)\nIn addition to some friction with the Court, public reac-\ntion focused on common perceptions that such a program\nwould be \"soft on crime,\" a criticism all too familiar to advo-\ncates for restorative justice. From these reactions, it was\nclear that educating the community, something the group had\nconsistently worked at, was going to be a never-ending proj-\nect. As a result of the reaction from numerous fronts, several\nchanges were made to the pilot program. First, the program\nwas no longer to be described as a 61st District Court pro-\ngram. Second, the pilot program was strategically renamed\nthe \"Fast-Track Accountability Program\" (FTAP). This was\na linguistic shift, designed to communicate the simplest and\nmost politically viable benefits of the pilot. Use of the term\naccountability (a staple of restorative justice) was chosen\nquite intentionally because of the more punitive connotation.\nThis, it was believed, might appease some concern, and also\ndemonstrated that the need for education about restorative\njustice continued to be necessary.\nFunding\nNearing the end of the second 9 months, two significant\nevents unfolded. First, an effort was made to acquire a Social\nVenture Investors grant through a local community founda-\ntion. The program made it to the final round of consideration,\nbut ultimately did not receive funding. The potential funders\nidentified the relatively limited scope of the program as a\nmajor concern. At the same time, however, RJCWM was\nmaking steps to solidify itself as an organization, adopting a\nconstitution, bylaws, and establishing a formal board of\ndirectors. The Board's election marks the turning point from\nan informal grassroots gathering to a codified, hierarchical\norganization with elected leadership, committees, and more\nclearly formalized and articulated responsibilities.\nIn the final 3-month push toward implementation, the\nnewly minted FTAP relied heavily on the clout of its Board\n(including City Commissioners, a retired judge, dispute\n6 SAGE Open\nresolution professionals, academics, and several well-known\nlocal community members). The relationships built over the\npreceding 18 months proved invaluable in coordinating the\npilot development and implementation. FTAP's first media-\ntion was conducted just short of 2 years after the City\nCommissioner took office.\nProgram Implementation: Continuing\nChallenges\nThe actual implementation of FTAP moved rather slowly,\nboth in terms of receiving the first program participant and\nin the number of participants who successfully completed\nthe process. After little more than a year into the program,\na total of 70 cases had been routed into FTAP. Of these, 25\ncases cleared the double consent needed to begin the pro-\ncess, and 15 have successfully completed mediations and\ncontracts. Several aspects of the implementation process\nhave contributed to the slow start: the complexities and\ninflexibilities of the current criminal justice system, and the\nprogram design itself.\nOne of the first major issues with implementation\nemerged at the point of arraignment. At arraignment, the\naccused pleads either guilty or not guilty. From a restor-\native justice perspective, FTAP was particularly interested\nin those who acknowledged they were at fault and pled\nguilty. However, these were precisely the people to whom\nthe current system denied access. Individuals who pled\nguilty at arraignment were routed through a summary sys-\ntem that quickly adjudicated and dismissed them. From the\nCourt's perspective, these were ideal cases, as they repre-\nsented financial income with minimal associated court\ncosts. Board members of RJCWM and others continue to\nexamine ways to reimagine this process. Instead, FTAP\nwas left with those who pled not guilty at arraignment.\nSome of these individuals likely believe themselves to be\ninnocent and others are simply unwilling to accept respon-\nsibility for their actions. Either way, they are not interested\nin meeting with a victim to discuss a crime for which they\ndo not feel responsible. In essence, the adversarial struc-\nture of the existing system reinforced nonparticipation by\noffenders.\nUnfortunately, the criminal justice system encourages\nindividuals interested in obtaining the best possible outcome,\neven if they may privately acknowledge guilt, to plead not\nguilty. Many defense attorneys will counsel their clients to\nplead not guilty, initially, to plea bargain for a better deal.\nAdmission of guilt is a bargaining chip to be played at the\nappropriate time in the process.\nThis status quo continues to be particularly problematic in\nthe context of restorative justice wherein offenders are\nencouraged to accept responsibility for their actions before\nparticipation. In fact, typically, an acceptance of responsibil-\nity is required before a case will enter victim\u00adoffender medi-\nation, lest an offender shows up and denies participation or\nresponsibility for his actions, causing the other party (the\nvictim) to feel revictimized.\nThere did remain one incentive for participation by eligi-\nble offenders. By participating, offenders found that they\ncould successfully complete the program and in doing so,\nkeep the charges from appearing on their record. However,\nparticipation in restorative justice is less than ideal when\ncoerced or forced. It continues to be essential for the practi-\ntioners to screen cases appropriately to determine whether\nand when an offender is participating for the wrong reason.\nIn addition to not being able to access individuals who\npled guilty, FTAP was also unable to help individuals avoid\nthe mechanisms of the traditional process entirely, thereby\ntaking on the functional approach of an add-on to the exist-\ning system, as opposed to an alternative to the existing sys-\ntem.The judges of the 61st District Court are held responsible\nfor their caseloads by the Supreme Court of Michigan. After\na case enters the 61st District Court's computer system, the\nCourt has a fixed timeline to process it before an automated\nnotice is sent to the Supreme Court. As a result, the judges\nwere unwilling to exempt FTAP participants from custom-\nary court appearances such as the pretrial and settlement\nconferences. For example, if John Doe went through FTAP,\nand spent 60 days working on his contract only to renege,\nthe court would be left with precious little time to process\nthe case when it flushed back into the traditional system\nbefore being censured by the Supreme Court. Consequently,\nindividuals enrolled in FTAP have been required to concur-\nrently attend all the same court proceedings as someone\ninvolved in the traditional system. This had the unfortunate\nconsequence of negating all the possible cost-savings asso-\nciated with avoiding time in a courtroom in front of a judge,\nand instead cost more money per case. From the Court's per-\nspective, the only way around this would be to move\nentrance into the program precharge, an approach that\nRJCWM is actively advocating.\nEven when cases were assigned to FTAP, establishing\ncontact with offenders and victims to offer participation\nproved difficult. The DRC was frequently unable to make\nany contact whatsoever, and only occasionally been able to\nsatisfy the double consent needed to even begin the process.\nAttrition as a result of individuals who do not answer their\nphones, have lost phone service, have moved, or are other-\nwise unavailable presented a serious obstacle to FTAP.\nSometimes the police records that the DRC relied on to make\ncontacts were inaccurate, due to clerical errors or false infor-\nmation provided. In addition, it was quite possible that some\nindividuals do not return calls because they are, or believed\nthey were, innocent. It was hoped that if/as the program con-\ntinues, community awareness of the program will make suc-\ncessful contact more likely. As these issues were being\ndiscovered, other aspects of the project struggled to prepare\nfor service delivery.\nThe evaluation of the program faced numerous challenges.\nFTAP's founders had been very explicit in their desire to\nGerkin et al. 7\nincorporate a rigorous evaluation into the design and imple-\nmentation of the program. To accomplish this, US$10,000\nof the US$60,000 total funding from the city for the project\nCommission approved the research funding. The research\nmonies were to be contracted to the Center for Social Research\n(CSR) at one of the local colleges. The CSR was to help over-\nsee the research design and data collection in cooperation\nwith the academic committee of RJCWM.\nThe academic calendar, however, moves differently\nthan that of the City or of politicians interested in results.\nThe program ultimately began before approval to study it\nhad been obtained, with the first participants entering in\nJuly 2009. In effect, the program started not only before\nthe research design had been fully delineated but before\nthe program itself had been completely conceptualized. At\nthe center of the entire project was the City Commissioner,\nwith existing relationships to all the spokes of the wheel,\nbut the spokes had little connection to each other except\nthe center. With pressure radiating from the center, the\nmany spokes moved awkwardly out of sync. The research\ndesign, and a fully coherent concept of the program itself,\nlagged behind service delivery, something that continues\nto cause problems.\nDespite having Human Subject Institutional Review\nBoard (HSIRB) approval, data collection only began to catch\nup with service delivery in December 2009. To address some\nof the issues that come from attempting to assemble a data\nset from multiple sources, CSR decided to house all the data\nin an online QuickBase database. This has enabled the vari-\nous agencies to input data relevant to their role in the process\ninto one common, real time receptacle.\nEven after finalizing the research design, attempts to\nmake changes to FTAPhave continued. One that has emerged\nis a result of difficulties with certain victims. At this point in\nthe program, 75% of the offenders have been individuals\ncharged with removing property not their own (shoplifting).\nMany victims of shoplifting are small retail chains. They\noften have neither the desire nor legal ability to engage in\nmediation with shoplifters. Although this is typical, the\nresponse from larger retail chains has been different. In gen-\neral, the large retail chains have been highly supportive of\nFTAP, some have even started referring their own cases to\nthe program and asking for the court's willingness to dismiss\nthe charges. As previously mentioned, certain restorative jus-\ntice programs have addressed similar situations through the\nuse of victim impact panels or accountability boards.\nRJCWM forwarded the possibility of such options to the\nCity Attorney's office, but the current low volume of cases\nmakes such a move unnecessary.\nGiven the whittling away of the sample from which data\ncan be drawn, a fully random experimental design is increas-\ningly untenable.Although this was one of the Commissioner's\nhighest hopes for the program, it has proven almost impossi-\nble to implement. Data gleaned from the small sample would\nstruggle to be statistically significant, and even statistical sig-\nnificance would be tarnished from an academic standpoint by\nsome of the structural problems with the program itself, par-\nticularly the exclusion of individuals who plead guilty. At this\npoint, there is not sufficient political capital to make the fun-\ndamental changes to the program that would allow it to func-\ntion as it was originally conceptualized.\nOne of the primary sticking points for the City Attorney's\noffice remains the \"Willie Horton\" concern. In 1987, Horton\nwas serving a life sentence without parole for murder, when\nhe was released on a weekend furlough program only to\ncommit assault and rape. The City Attorney's office does not\nwant to be responsible for an individual who is admitted into\nthe FTAP program, and while in diversion offends against\neither their original victim or someone else. Yet, this is the\nself-preservation of individuals and offices tethered to the\nadversarial system of justice whereby politics serves to dele-\ngitimize alternative justice approaches. The benefit of having\noffenders simultaneously involved in the traditional system\nis that a no-contact order between the alleged offender and\nvictim is automatically issued, and while hardly capable of\npreventing something from occurring, the order at least\nextends legal protection. Moving the program precharge\nwould mean losing that no-contact order, and accepting the\npotential political fallout with the community should some-\nthing occur. Members of RJCWM have forwarded the pos-\nsibility of offering victims the opportunity to file personal\nprotection orders (PPOs) as an alternative.\nIdeally, the community would be equally invested in\nrestorative practices, and agree to accept the possibility of\npotential isolated incidents in favor of the greater good. For\nit to succeed, the community must realize they have a stake\nin restorative justice, that the justice process belongs to the\nDiscussion\nSeveral lessons have been learned along that way are easily\ntransferable to other locations and efforts to implement\nrestorative justice. First, program designers and implement-\ners should recognize that the government must be both will-\ning and capable of shifting focus from punishing, to\npromoting accountability in the effort to repair harms. This\nshift represents a major philosophical change, one that\nrequires another significant practical change. It requires an\nalternative forum for the administration of justice. Members\nof RJCWM took on the role of change agents (Rogers, 1995)\nand toiled in the challenge to encourage the philosophical\nand practical shift necessary to implement the restorative\npractices. Although this may seem like common sense, it is\nreally about the actual assessment of the states' willingness\nto make these changes that is so important. Program design-\ners and implementers would also do well to be aware that\nthese changes are particularly difficult within a rights-based\nand adversarial system (Schiff, 2007). The authors would\n8 SAGE Open\nrecommend a thorough review of the diffusion of innovation\nliterature prior to even designing an innovative program.\nRestorative justice asks stakeholders to look at crime\nthrough a fundamentally different lens, one with which most\npolice officers, judges, and lawyers may have only cursory\nfamiliarity, at best. These justice professionals are asked to\nshift their role from that of expertise problem solver to that of\ncommunity facilitator. This shift requires not only the rei-\nmagining of roles (and the norms for behavior associated\nwith those roles) but also the reordering of priorities and\nFurthermore, within a restorative framework, justice profes-\nsionals are called not only to support these changes, but also\nto lead the paradigm shift as supporters and advocates.\nSecond, those designing and implementing restorative\nprograms should take great care in publicizing and promot-\ning their programs. Without being taught why and how\nrestorative justice benefits the community and holds offend-\ners accountable, program planners are likely to experience\nvarious levels of resistance. Program developers would do\nwell to remember that communities likely have no collective\nmemory of a time when they did handle their own problems.\nCommunity participation in justice has atrophied as the\nadversarial system has matured and become more complex.\nCommunities are unfamiliar with restorative justice and are\nlikely neither ready nor willing to participate. They will\nlikely be uncomfortable at even the thought of being asked to\ndo so. Others are likely to perceive restorative justice as soft\non crime and consequently of little value. Education is\nimportant. That includes the education of the state, as well as\nthe public.\nThird, funding and evaluation should be a top priority.\nThese issues are intertwined and any long term hope for the\nprogram will likely be tied to one or both of these. The pro-\ngram needs to demonstrate a value. Although saving money\nis always a benefit and one that is likely to generate contin-\nued support, programs that hold offenders accountable,\nrestore victims, and reintegrate offenders will bring the\ngreatest benefits to the participants and the community.\nFinally, program designers and implementers should\ncount as one of their own, a major player currently working\nwithin the retributive criminal justice system. Although not\nabsolutely necessary, implementing a program from the out-\nside is difficult.\nPrograms implemented within governmental structures\nfrequently face challenges involving postcharge, postpolice\nplayers such as prosecutors. Furthermore, they frequently\nstruggle to foster both community support and support from\nvictim service providers (Clairmont, 2005).\nConclusion\nFlexibility with participants' changing roles continues to be\nboth a strength and a challenge for RJCWM. In looking at\nthe notes from initial meetings, the shift in participants is of\nnote. In the early planning stage, participants included\nolder, more established researchers and academics. The\nacademics most intimately involved at the point of imple-\nmentation were all comparatively new to RJCWM, unten-\nured, and young. As with any other grassroots effort,\ndecisions are made, projects are completed, and progress is\nrealized not by the most highly qualified or positioned, but\nby those that are present.\nMembers of RJCWM discovered abundant truth in the\nwords of 61st Court Administrator Josef Soper who\nremarked that programs such as restorative justice are\nimplemented because people who are in a position to imple-\nment them, do (Soper, 2006). In the end, there was no one\non the board of directors for RJCWM, no one of note among\nthe design team who was realistically in a position to imple-\nment the program that was designed. Negotiating the actual\ndetails of the program to be delivered were not really nego-\ntiations. In several instances, RJCWM pushed back against\ndecisions made by those working in the system. Ultimately\nRJCWM had little power or authority to impose their will.\nIt would certainly be fair to say that there was some naivety\namong RJCWM about how difficult this task would be. As\nadvocates of restorative justice, members of the coalition\nsaw the value in implementing restorative practices.\nHowever, convincing those on the inside of the system was\nfar more challenging than expected.\nReflecting on the program that was eventually imple-\nmented, one board member noted, \"At the point of imple-\nmentation, several of us realized that what was being\nimplemented was so far removed from what we envisioned\nand what we designed that we were questioning why we\nwere even doing it\" (P. Gerkin, personal communication,\nwho have tried to implement restorative justice (Lemley &\nIronically, the City Attorney's office was taking note of\nthe paradigm shift that was taking place. The City Attorney's\noffice made some restorative changes before FTAP had even\nbeen fully conceptualized. Up until they were approached,\nthe City Attorney's office had virtually no communication\nwith victims of misdemeanors. The victim-centric vision of\nFTAP prompted the City Attorney to begin sending out a let-\nter to all victims of misdemeanors expressing regret and\noffering opportunities for involvement in the traditional sys-\ntem. Furthermore, the City Attorney became interested in the\nexperiences of victims within the traditional system. She\nbegan collecting survey data from victims about their satis-\nfaction with the City Attorney's Office and the processing of\ntheir case. This co-opting of restorative principles for incor-\nporation into the formal criminal justice system is not new\nIn Wagga Wagga, New South Wales, restorative practices\nwere inserted directly into the formal criminal justice system\n(Van Ness & Strong, 2002). Police officers, using their dis-\ncretion, began facilitating conferences with juveniles, adding\nGerkin et al. 9\nto the options of cautioning juveniles or referring them to the\njuvenile court (Van Ness & Strong, 2002). The officers them-\nselves became the mediators. Others have suggested that tri-\nals could become more restorative by holding jury\ndeliberations in front of the victim and defendant or by\nallowing jury members to ask questions during the trial (Van\nIt remains to be seen how the program and RJCWM will\nbalance the need of a pilot program to be flexible to craft a\nquality program while maintaining the academic rigor nec-\nessary to demonstrate the program's benefit. It is clear that\nsome very positive steps have been taken in to increase\nthe restorative character of justice in the community.\nCommunity stakeholders and politicians came together to\nbegin the difficult task of tackling a complex system, and\nobtained the necessary political and financial capital to\nimplement an experimental program that has had real ben-\nefits for those involved. At the same time, it is clear that\nbetter communication between the City Attorney's office\nand the 61st District Court and DRC is needed to move the\nprogram toward financial sustainability, and that a solution\nfor the problem of how to replace a no-contact order must\nbe found if this program is to succeed precharge. Moving\nforward, RJCWM must find ways to address these issues to\nmaintain the support of the City Commission. The coalition\nmust also be careful to maintain the support and service\nprovision of the DRC, and assist it in expanding its capaci-\nties, but substantial progress has been made. The City\nCommissioner has said that broken systems do not repair\nthemselves overnight.\nAs a postscript, the authors would like to acknowledge\nthat the political environment, processes, issues, and impli-\ncations discussed herein are unique and not necessarily rep-\nlicable across contexts.
