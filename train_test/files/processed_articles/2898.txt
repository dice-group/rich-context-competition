Evidence\nfor German savings banks\n\n\n\n1 Introduction\nSince the process of deregulation in the 1970s, the supervision of banks has mainly\nrelied on minimum capital requirements. This prominent role of minimum capital\nrequirements is particularly reflected in the Basel Capital Accord and the current\nprocess of its revision (Basel II). However, the importance attached to capital\nrequirements in the supervision of banks raises several questions: How do banks react to\ncapital requirements? Do they increase capital when they approach the regulatory\nminimum? Do they also adjust risk and how are these adjustments interrelated? And\nfinally, do minimum capital requirements also have an effect on well-capitalized banks?\nAn increasing branch of the theoretical literature has tried to assess the effects of\nminimum capital requirements on capital and banks' risk. This literature argues mainly\nwithin option pricing models or portfolio models and that capital regulation is motivated\nmostly by the assumption that banks commit moral hazard. Information asymmetries\nand deposit insurance shield banks from the disciplining control of depositors. Merton\n(1977) shows within an option pricing model that banks with limited liability can thus\nincrease shareholder value by decreasing capital and increasing risk. The increasing\ndefault probability is at the expense of the deposit insurance. Furlong and Keeley (1989)\nshow that \u00ad by exposing the bank's own funds to potential risks \u00ad flat capital\nrequirements can reduce, but do not eliminate the moral hazard incentives. This is\nmainly because the amount of capital the bank has to set aside against credit risk does\nnot depend on the bank's asset quality. Sharpe (1978) shows that risk-based capital\n____________________\n We thank J\u00f6rg Breitung, Claudia Buch, Kai Carstensen, Stefan Jaschke, Phil Molyneux, and Andrea\nSchertler for helpful comments.\nrequirements can completely eliminate moral hazard. Hence risk-based capital\nrequirements eventually lower the probability of default, thereby lowering the expected\ndeposit insurance liability.\nOther authors show within portfolio models that flat capital requirements may even\nincrease risk-taking incentives instead of lowering them. Koehn and Santomero (1980)\nargue that the forced increase in expensive capital financing reduces a bank's expected\nreturn. The bank, in turn, tries to increase its profitability by investing in riskier assets.\nIn some cases, the default probability may even increase. Kim and Santomero (1988)\nand Rochet (1992) point out that risk-based capital requirements can eliminate risk-\ntaking incentives if risk weights are correctly chosen.\nThe traditional moral hazard literature reviewed above abstracts from rigidities and\nadjustment costs. Accordingly, in those models, banks never hold capital in excess of\nthe regulatory minimum. In practice, however, banks may not be able to instantaneously\nadjust capital or risk due to adjustment costs or illiquid markets. Furthermore, under\nasymmetric information, raising equity capital could be interpreted as a negative signal\nwith regard to the bank's value (Myers and Majluf 1984), rendering banks unable or\nreluctant to react to negative capital shocks instantaneously. However, a breach of the\nregulation triggers costly supervisory actions, possibly even leading to the bank's\nclosure. Hence banks have an incentive to hold more capital than required (a \"capital\nbuffer\") as an insurance against a violation of the regulatory minimum capital\nrequirement. This incentive increases with the probability of breaching the regulatory\nminimum and, hence, with the volatility of the capital ratio. However, raising capital is\nrelatively costly compared to raising insured deposits. This trade-off determines the\nThe moral hazard theory and the capital buffer theory have different implications for\nhow banks adjust capital and risk in the light of minimum capital requirements. The\nmoral hazard theory predicts that when capital requirements force banks to increase\ncapital, they will react by also increasing risk. By contrast, the capital buffer theory\npredicts that the behaviour of banks depends on the size of their capital buffer: banks\nwith high capital buffers will aim at maintaining their capital buffers while banks with\nlow capital buffers will aim at rebuilding an appropriate capital buffer. Hence for banks\nwith high capital buffers, capital and risk adjustments will be positively related while,\nfor banks with low capital buffer, capital and risk adjustments will be negatively related.\nAn increasing number of empirical papers (Shrieves and Dahl 1992; Jacques and\ntheory. Most papers find a positive relationship between capital and risk adjustments,\nindicating that banks that have built up capital have, at the same time, also increased\nrisk. This finding has been interpreted as supporting the moral hazard theory.\nWe contribute to the literature in three important ways. First, to the best of our\nknowledge, we are the first to empirically test the capital buffer theory. To do so, we\nallow the relationship between capital and risk adjustments to depend on the size of the\ncapital buffer. Second, in contrast to much of the literature, we do not pool the data, but\nuse dynamic panel data techniques in order to account explicitly for bank-specific\neffects. And third, we use a new supervisory dataset collected by the Deutsche\nBundesbank. While most of the existing literature studies US banks, we study German\nbanks, thereby providing further evidence on non-US banks.\nOur paper is organised as follows. Section 1 specifies the empirical model and the\nhypotheses to be tested. Section 2 and 3 describe the data and the statistical\nmethodology. Section 4 shows the regression results. Section 5 concludes.\n2 The empirical model\n2.1 A simultaneous equations model with partial adjustment\nThe capital buffer and the moral hazard theory discussed above presume that banks\nsimultaneously determine capital and risk. Empirical tests of the relationship between\ncapital and risk must recognise this simultaneity. Hence we use a simultaneous\nequations model which builds on earlier work by Shrieves and Dahl (1992). The two\nequations of the model explain adjustments in capital and risk respectively.1 As the\nobserved adjustments are the result not only of the discretionary behaviour of banks but\nalso of exogenous shocks, adjustments are modelled as the sum of a discretionary\ncomponent and an exogenous random shock:2\nt\nj\nd\nt\nj\nt\nj\nCAP\nCAP\n,\n,\n,\n\n+\n\n=\n, , ,\nd\nj t j t j t\n =  + , (2)\nwhere CAPj,t\nand RISKj,t\nare the total observed changes, CAPd\nj,t\nand RISKd\nj,t\nare\nthe endogenously determined adjustments, and j,t\nand i,t\nare the exogenous random\nshocks in capital and risk levels, respectively, for bank j in period t.\n____________________\n1 Most empirical models do not try to explain the absolute levels of capital and risk. Instead, they\nexplain adjustments in capital and risk. The first reason for this is the fact that a theory of the\noptimal capital structure for banks does not exist. The theories referred to above, rather, have\nimplications for how individual banks adjust capital in reaction to adjustment in risk (and vice\nversa). To understand the second reason for this specification, let us assume a mean-variance\nframework such as in Kim and Santomero (1988). Banks with relatively low risk aversion will then\nchoose relatively high leverage and relatively high asset risk. We would, thus, expect to observe a\nnegative cross-sectional correlation between the level of asset risk and capital ratios due to cross-\nsectional variation in risk preferences.\n2 With respect to capital, exogenous shocks can be the result of unanticipated changes in earnings.\nWith respect to risk, exogenous shocks are mainly the result of unanticipated economic\ndevelopments, such as a changing asset or loan quality or a changing value of the loan collateral\nThe buffer theory additionally assumes that banks face rigidities and adjustment\ncosts that may prevent them from making instantaneous discretionary adjustments.\nHence we model the discretionary part of observed adjustments in capital and risk in a\npartial adjustment framework. This framework assumes that banks aim at establishing\noptimal capital and risk levels, the \"target levels\". Since exogenous shocks drive actual\nlevels away from target levels, banks will then adjust capital and risk to meet the target.\nHowever, full adjustment may be too costly and/or infeasible. Hence banks adjust levels\nonly partially towards the target levels. The partial adjustment framework assumes that\nthe adjustment is proportional to the difference between optimal and actual levels:\n)\n(\n,\n*\n,\n, -\n-\n=\n\nt\nj\nt\nj\nd\nt\nj\nCAP\nCAP\nCAP  , (3)\n*\n( )\nd\nj t j t j t\n\n-\n = - , (4)\nwhere  and  are the speeds of adjustments, CAP*j,t\nand RISK*j,t\nare the target\nlevels, and CAPj,t-1\nand RISKj,t-1\nare the actual levels of capital and risk, respectively, in\nthe previous period.\nSubstituting Eqs. (3) and (4) into Eqs. (1) and (2), the observed adjustments in\ncapital and risk can be written as\n*\n( )\nj t j t j t j t\n \n-\n = - + , (5)\n*\n( )\nj t j t j t j t\n \n-\n = - + . (6)\nHence the observed adjustments in capital and risk in period t are a function of the\ntarget levels and the lagged levels of capital and risk respectively as well as exogenous\nshocks.\n1.2 Definitions of capital and risk\nWe define capital (CAP) as the ratio of total capital to total assets (TCTA). Total capital\nconsists of all liable capital components permitted under the German Banking Act and\nis comparable to the definition used in the Basel Capital Accord.3 The definition of risk\nis more problematic. More advanced measures, such as value at risk, are not available.\nThe same holds for the volatility of the market price of a bank's assets. Instead, we\ndefine risk (RISK) as the ratio of risk-weighted assets to total assets (RWATA). The\nrationale for this definition is that the allocation of bank assets among risk categories is\nthe major determinant of a bank's risk.4\nAnother reason why we use TCTA and RWATA as definitions of capital and risk,\nrespectively is the following. The Basel I minimum capital requirement is defined as the\nratio of total capital to total risk-weighted assets. In order to comply with the 8%\nregulatory minimum, banks can adjust the numerator and/or the denominator of the\nBasel capital ratio. In the definitions chosen in this paper, dCAP reflects adjustments in\nthe numerator (capital) while dRISK reflects adjustments in the denominator (risk-\nweighted assets). Hence dCAP and dRISK can be interpreted as the two variables banks\nhave at their discretion to manage their Basel capital ratio. This interpretation is\nlogically independent of whether or not RISK is a correct measure of risk. The\ninterpretation as a measure of risk is correct only if the risk weights correctly reflect the\neconomic risk of the assets. However, empirical evidence shows that the Basel I risk\nweights and the economic risk of an asset are only weakly correlated (Avery and Berger\n1991). However, regardless of whatever additional risk measures they use in their daily\nbusiness, all banks still have to obey regulatory rules. In this sense, they will have to\nmanage their \"regulatory\" risk. Despite the shortcomings of RWATA as a measure of\nrisk and in line with the literature, we interpret RISK as a measure of risk in the\nremainder of the paper. However, readers with doubts might want to replace \"risk\" by\n\"risk-weighted assets\" in the following.\n____________________\n3 Total capital is defined as core capital plus additional capital minus corrective items specified by the\nBanking Act.\n4 Support for this measure can be found in Chessen (1987) and Keeton (1989). Shrieves and Dahl\n(1992) point out that, apart from allocation, a bank's portfolio risk is also determined by the quality\nof loans. In contrast, Jacques and Nigro (1997) argue that the RWATA captures the allocation as\nwell as the quality aspect of portfolio risk, whereas Avery and Berger (1991) and Berger (1995)\nargue that this ratio is positively correlated with risk.\n1.3 Variables affecting the target levels of capital and risk\nThe partial adjustment model presented in Eqs. (5) and (6) above suggests that banks\naim at establishing their target capital and risk levels. These target levels are not readily\nobservable. They depend on other variables specific to the individual bank. In the\nfollowing, these explanatory variables and their expected impact on the observed\nadjustments in capital and risk are presented.\nSize may have an effect on a bank's target capital level as the size of a bank is an\nindicator of the bank's access to capital. German law prohibits savings banks from\nraising Tier 1 capital via equity markets. Hence savings banks depend on retained\nearnings and capital injections by their public owners. However, big savings banks use\nsubordinated debt issues to raise Tier 2 capital.5 Thus, larger savings banks are more\nflexible in raising capital, which renders their target capital level smaller than the target\ncapital levels of smaller banks. Besides, size may also have an effect on a bank's target\nrisk level as the size of a bank affects its investment opportunities and diversification\npossibilities. The sign of this effect is, however, undetermined (Acharya et al 2002).\nHence we include the natural log of total assets (SIZE) in the capital and risk equations\nto capture size effects.\nSavings banks have to rely mainly on retained earnings to increase capital. Hence\nwe include the bank's return on assets (ROA) in the capital equation as a measure of\nprofits with an expected positive sign.\nCurrent loan losses affect the ratio of risk-weighted assets to total assets as they\nreduce the nominal amount of risk-weighted assets. Building on Rime (2001), we\napproximate these losses (LLOSS) with the ratio of new net provisions to total assets\nand include LLOSS in the risk equation with an expected negative sign.\n____________________\n5 Of the 50 banks with the highest number of subordinated debt issues in Basel Committee member\nstates 15 are German savings banks: 7 central giro institutions and 8 local savings banks (Basel\nBesides, we use two control variables which may also affect target capital and risk\nlevels. First, the savings banking sector has seen a merger wave in the last years. When\na savings bank faces financial troubles, it is merged with a healthy bank in the\nneighbourhood. We therefore expect to observe a decrease in capital and an increase in\nrisk for the take-over bank in the year of the merger. In order to capture these effects,\nwe include a merger dummy variable (MERGER) in the regression equations, which is\nunity in the year a savings bank takes over another bank and zero otherwise. Second, as\nsavings banks are the main lenders to local firms, we expect local firm insolvencies to\nhave a negative impact on capital and a positive impact on risk. Hence we approximate\nthese local insolvencies (INSOLV) with the ratio of firm insolvencies to the total number\nof firms in the German state where the savings bank is located. Finally, we also include\nyear dummy variables, which capture further year-specific macroeconomic effects.\nLast but not least, we have to find a criterion to distinguish between banks with high\ncapital buffers and banks with low capital buffers. The criterion used by the majority of\nthe literature builds on the capital buffer measured as the absolute difference between\nthe actual Basel capital ratio and the 8% regulatory minimum capital requirement (the\n\"absolute capital buffer\").\nIn order to test the capital buffer theory, another criterion which is based on the\nstandardised capital buffer is, however, more appropriate. Let us assume the existence\nof two banks, A and B, both having the same absolute capital buffer. Bank A's capital\nbuffer is less volatile than Bank B's capital buffer. Hence Bank A is better insured\nagainst a possible violation of the regulatory minimum in spite of both banks holding\nthe same absolute capital buffer. To capture this effect, we divide the absolute capital\nbuffer by the bank-specific standard deviation of the absolute capital buffer (the\n\"standardised capital buffer\"). Based on this criterion, we define a regulatory dummy\n(REG), which is unity if a bank has a standardised capital buffer equal to or less than a\ncertain cut-off value and zero otherwise. As cut-off values, we use both the 25\npercentile and the median standardised capital buffer. The Sargan (1958) test of\noveridentifying restrictions indicates, however, that our regressions based on the median\ncapital buffer are not valid. Hence we use the 25% centile in the following. For our\nsample, this threshold is at 1.6887 standard deviations of the capital buffer above the\n8% regulatory minimum.\nWe test three different effects of the size of the capital buffer on capital and risk\nadjustments. First, banks with low capital buffers may differ in the magnitude of their\ncapital and risk adjustments from banks with high capital buffers. Hence we include\nREG in the capital and risk equation. Second, we expect that, according to the capital\nbuffer theory, adjustments in capital and risk are positively related for banks with high\ncapital buffers while they are negatively related for banks with low capital buffers. In\norder to allow for the different relationships between capital and risk, we include dRISK\nand REG*dRISK (dCAP and REG*dCAP) in the capital (risk) equation. And third, we\ntest whether banks with low capital buffers adjust capital and risk faster than banks with\nhigh capital buffers. In order to do so, we include REG*CAPt-1\n) in\naddition to CAPj,t-1\n(RISKj,t-1\n) in the capital (risk) equation.\n1.4 Specification and hypotheses\nIn order to obtain the standard form of an endogenous lag model that can be estimated\nwith the software package DPD for Ox (Doornik et al 2002), we add CAPj,t-1\nand\nto both sides of Eqs.

Adjustments in capital and risk are positively related for\nbanks with high capital buffers as banks with high capital buffers try to maintain their\ncapital buffers. For this hypothesis to hold, it is sufficient that one of the two\ncoefficients is significant.\n<\n+\n<\n+ \n . Adjustments in capital and risk are negatively\nrelated for banks with low capital buffers as banks with low capital buffers try to\nrebuild their capital buffers. For this hypothesis to hold, it is sufficient that one of the\ntwo sums is significant.\n>\n . Banks with low capital buffers adjust capital faster than banks with high\ncapital buffers.\n>\n . Banks with low capital buffers adjust risk faster than banks with high\ncapital buffers.\n3 Data description\nThe German banking system is highly fragmented and heterogenous. Hence coefficients\nmay not be stable across the different banking groups. To avoid this problem, we try to\ncreate a homogenous sample. First, we regard savings banks only. Savings banks are the\nlargest banking group in Germany, representing 36% (48%) of the balance sheet total of\nall banks (universal banks) (according to the Bundesbank's Banking Statistics). Despite\nbeing publicly owned, they aim at maximising profits (Hartmann-Wendels et al 1998).\nHence the theories discussed above can indeed be tested on the basis of savings banks.\nSecond, we exclude the central giro institutions from the sample as their portfolio is\nvery different from those of local savings banks.6 Third, we keep only banks in the\nsample which remain in existence for at least four years during the observation period.\nFourth, we drop the 15 savings banks with capital ratios below 8% as they are under the\ncontrol of supervisors. And fifth, in order to ensure time series homogeneity, we drop\nthe years 2001 to 2003, which were affected by the burst of the bubble and the ensuing\neconomic downturn.7 As a result, our sample consists of about 570 local German\non risk-weighted assets were available for savings banks. The balance sheet data were\nobtained from the Deutsche Bundesbank, which collects bank-level data in its\nsupervisory function. The insolvency data was obtained from the Federal Statistical\nOffice (Statistisches Bundesamt).\nThroughout the observation period, the savings banks under review held an average\ncapital buffer of 2.57 standard deviations above the 8% regulatory minimum (see\nAppendix for some descriptive statistics of the variables).\n____________________\n6 Private savings banks (so-called free savings banks) are also excluded from the sample as they are\nnot subject to regional investment restrictions and therefore have more degrees of freedom in\ndeciding upon their loan portfolio.\n7 The Sargan test is very sensitive to coefficients not being stable over time and therefore indicates\nTable 1 gives the correlations for all non-categorical variables, including relevant\nfirst differences and lags. In addition, it gives the correlations for the capital buffer\nmeasured in absolute terms and in standard deviations above the regulatory minimum\n(based on the pooled sample). The correlation between levels of CAP and RISK as well\nas between first differences of CAP and RISK are positive. This finding stands in\ncontrast to Shrieves and Dahl (1992), who find a negative correlation between levels\nand a positive correlation between first differences. They argue that the negative\ncorrelation between levels is due to cross-sectional variation in risk preferences: Banks\nwith low risk aversion would choose low capital ratios and high risk, whereas banks\nwith high risk aversion would choose high capital ratios and low risk. However, in this\npaper, savings banks were deliberately chosen as they are assumed to be a rather\nhomogenous group of banks. Hence the absence of cross-sectional variation in risk\naversion is not surprising.\nTable 1: Correlations among variables\nbuffera\nCapital\nbufferb\nINSOLV\nCapital\nCapital\naMeasured as the Basel capital ratio minus the 8% regulatory minimum. \u00ad bMeasured in standard deviations above the 8% regulatory\nminimum.\n4 Methodology and regression results\nUnlike previous empirical studies (Shrieves and Dahl 1992; Jacques and Nigro 1997;\nwhich control for the bank-specific effects\nj\n\u00b5 and\nj\n .

Hence we only use a subsample of the whole history of the series as\ninstruments in the subsequent cross-section.10 Besides, a possible persistence in\n____________________\nt\nj\nCAP\n,\n is a function of\nj\n\u00b5 ,\n, -\nt\nj\nCAP is also a function of\nj\n\u00b5 .

Therefore, the fixed effects estimator will be biased (Nickell\n1981). Besides, the random effects GLS estimator is also biased because before applying GLS,\nquasi-demeaning is performed.\n9 We use the capital equation as an example in the following. The same considerations in the choice\nof instruments hold for the risk equation.\n10 The Sargan indicates using values of CAPj\nand RISKj\nlagged two and three times as instruments.\nobserved capital and risk adjustments may result in the problem of weak instruments\nand losses in asymptotic efficiency when using the Arellano and Bond GMM estimator\n(Blundell and Bond 1998). Hence we use the system GMM estimator suggested by\nBlundell and Bond (1998), which uses lagged differences of CAPj\nas instruments for\nequations in levels in addition to the Arellano-Bond instruments.11\nAs, for our sample, the one- and two-step Blundell-Bond system GMM estimators\nproduce quite similar estimates, we present only the (asymptotically) more efficient\ntwo-step estimates. However, the two-step estimates of the standard errors tend to be\ncompensate, we use the finite-sample correction to the two-step covariance matrix\nIn the case of the risk equation, the Sargan test indicates that we use invalid\ninstruments. We attribute this to the well-known characteristic of the Sargan test to be\nconservative and we still interpret the estimated coefficients with due caution.\n4.2 Regression results\nThe results of estimating the simultaneous system of Eqs. (7) and (8) are presented in\nTables 2 and 3 respectively in addition to the Sargan test and the tests of serial\ncorrelation in the first-differenced residuals. Each table contains the result for three\ndifferent specifications, which vary in the way the regulatory variable affects banks'\ncapital and risk decisions. Specification I allows adjustments in capital and risk to\ndepend on whether banks have low or high capital buffers (inclusion of REG);\nSpecification II additionally allows for higher speeds of adjustment in capital and risk\n(inclusion of REG and REG*CAPt-1\nand REG*RISKt-1\n, respectively); and, finally,\n____________________\n11 In addition, we also use LLOSSj\nand lagged levels of RISKj\nas instruments for dRISKj,t\n-dRISKj,t-1\nin\nthe difference equations and first differences as instruments in the level equations in order to\naccount for the simultaneity of capital and risk adjustments. In the specifications where we include\nand REGj\n*dRISKj,t\namong the regressors, we also use instrumental variables for these\ninteraction terms.\nSpecification III additionally allows for differences in the coordination of capital and\nrisk adjustments (inclusion of REG and REG*dRISK and REG*dCAP, respectively).\nThe results show that, as expected, the return on assets (ROA) has a statistically\nhighly significant and positive effect on capital. Hence savings banks seem to rely\nheavily on retained earnings in order to increase capital. However, loan losses (LLOSS)\nshow the expected significant and negative effect on risk only in Specification III. Bank\nsize (SIZE) has a statistically significant and negative effect on risk, but it seems to have\nno effect on capital. The negative effect of bank size on risk stands in contrast to most\nother papers and means that larger banks have lower target risk levels than smaller\nbanks.\nThe results in Tables 2 and 3 provide also some interesting insights into the impact\nof capital regulation on the coordination of capital and risk adjustments. The simplest\nway to model the regulatory impact is to include a regulatory dummy variable, thereby\nallowing banks with low capital buffers to differ in their capital and risk adjustments by\na certain amount from banks with high capital buffers. However, the coefficients of the\nregulatory dummy are significant only in Specification I, where they have signs\nopposite to what we expected. The results suggest that banks with low capital buffers\nincrease capital by 0.28 percentage points less and increase risk by 0.65 percentage\npoints more than banks with high capital buffers. This counterintuitive result may be\ndue to the fact that, whereas we measure regulatory pressure in Specification I simply\nby including a dummy variable, the impact of regulation is actually more complex.\nWith respect to lagged capital, we estimate and report (1-6\n) instead of 6\n. Hence\nwe have to subtract 1 and multiply by -1 in order to obtain the speed of adjustment. The\nestimated speeds of capital and risk adjustment are highly significant and, in line with\nthe literature, are found to be relatively low. The estimated speed of capital (risk)\nshocks to capital (risk) are halved within 7 and 9 years (18 and 24 years). The very low\nspeed of risk adjustment may be due to the illiquid market for asset-backed securities in\nGermany, which renders the banks' asset structure rather rigid. In Specifications II to\nIV, we additionally allow banks with low capital buffers to adjust capital and risk faster\nthan banks with high capital buffers. With respect to capital, we find that the coefficient\nof REG*CAPt-1\nhas the expected sign, but is significant in Specification II only. Hence\nwe find mixed evidence that banks with low capital buffers adjust capital faster than\nbanks with high capital buffers. The finding of a higher capital adjustment is in line\nwith the literature (Shrieves and Dahl 1992; Ediz et al 1998; Aggarwal and Jacques\n2001). With respect to risk, we find that the coefficient of REG*RISKt-1\nis not\nsignificant, so banks with low capital buffers do not seem to adjust risk faster than\nbanks with high capital buffers.\nThe coefficient estimates of dRISK and REG*dRISK in the capital equation are\nstatistically insignificant. Only in Specification I is the coefficient of dRISK\nsignificantly negative at the 10% level. The coefficient estimates of dCAP and\nREG*dCAP in the risk equation become statistically significant once REG*dCAP is\nincluded in Specification III. For banks with high capital buffers, the coefficient\nestimate of dCAP is positive while, for banks with low capital buffers, the coefficient\nestimates of dCAP and REG*dCAP add up to a negative number. The results suggest\nthat banks with low capital buffers decrease risk when they increase capital, thereby\nrebuilding their capital buffer. In contrast, banks with high capital buffers increase risk\nwhen capital increases, thereby maintaining their capital buffer. However, banks with\nlow capital buffers as well as banks with high capital buffers do not adjust capital when\nrisk changes. This result is confirmed by a Wald test of the joint significance of the\ncoefficients of dRISK and REG*dRISK.12 This finding indicates that the coordination of\ncapital and risk adjustments runs only from capital to risk and not vice versa. Although\nwe did not expect the coordination to be one-way, the findings support our hypotheses\n.\nWe additionally control for take-overs (MERGER) and local firm insolvencies\n(INSOLV). Our results suggest that, contrary to our expectations, mergers and local firm\ninsolvencies do not seem to have any effect on capital and risk adjustments. INSOLV\n____________________\nhas the expected significant and negative sign only in the capital equation in\nSpecification II. Finally, the significance of the year dummy variables indicates the\nexistence of further macroeconomic shocks which are not captured by local firm\ninsolvencies.\nTable 2: Blundell-Bond two-step system GMM estimates for CAPj,t\nCoefficient t-value Coefficient t-value Coefficient t-value\nNotes: The dependent variable is CAPj,t\n, which is defined as total capital over total assets.

A\ngrowing branch of the banking literature has dealt with the question of how banks\nconsider capital regulation in their capital and risk decisions. The two major theories in\nthis field are the moral hazard theory and the capital buffer theory (Marcus 1984, Milne\nand Whalley 2002), which have rivalling predictions for the behaviour of banks. The\nempirical literature has mainly tested the moral hazard theory. Building on a model\ndeveloped by Shrieves and Dahl (1992), we are the first to test hypotheses on the\nrelationship between capital and risk adjustments derived from the buffer theory. We\nfurther contribute to the literature by using dynamic panel data techniques that explicitly\ntake unobserved heterogeneity into account. And finally, we provide new evidence for\nnon-US banks by using a new dataset of supervisory data collected by the Deutsche\nBundesbank.\nWe find that capital regulation has an impact on capital and risk adjustments in\nseveral interesting respects. In line with the literature, we find that banks adjust capital\nfaster than risk. Besides, we find mixed (no) evidence that banks with low capital\nbuffers adjust capital (risk) faster than banks with high capital buffers. With respect to\nthe coordination of capital and risk, we find evidence that banks with low capital buffers\nattempt to rebuild an appropriate capital buffer by decreasing risk when capital\ndecreases. In contrast, banks with high capital buffers attempt to maintain their capital\nbuffer by increasing risk when capital increases. However, banks do not adjust capital\nwhen risk changes. In summary, our findings are in line with the hypotheses derived\nfrom the buffer theory.\n6 Appendix\nDescriptive statistics\nMean Minimum 5 Percentile Median 95 Percentile Maximum\nCapital buffera\nCapital bufferb\na Measured as the Basel capital ratio minus 0.08. \u00ad b Measured in bank-specific standard deviations above the 8% regulatory\nminimum.\nVariable means for each year of the observation period\na Measured as the Basel capital ratio minus the 8% regulatory minimum. \u00ad b Measured in bank-specific standard deviations above\nthe 8% regulatory minimum.\nVariable means for savings banks with low and high capital buffers\nBanks with low capital buffera Banks with high capital bufferb\na Savings banks with capital buffers lower than 1.6887 standard deviations above the 8% regulatory minimum. \u00ad b Savings banks\nwith capital buffers higher than 1.6887 standard deviations above the 8% regulatory minimum. \u00ad cMeasured as the Basel capital\nratio minus the 8% regulatory minimum. \u00ad dMeasured in standard deviations above the 8% regulatory minimum.\n7 References\nAcharya, V., I.
