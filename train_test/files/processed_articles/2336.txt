Since facial\nredness carries social meaning, the triggers that motivate patients\nto seek care for rosacea may include incidents in which facial\nerythema is misinterpreted in social contexts by others who do\nnot understand the disease process (2). Papules and pustules\nrespond well to standard treatments, but only recently have\ntreatments been developed that are highly effective in reducing\nredness (3,4). Frustration with treatments that do not relieve\nredness symptoms, as well as the intermittent, flaring nature of the\ndisease in many patients, may contribute to poor adherence to\nrosacea treatment (5,6).\nThe purpose of this study is to determine the main reasons for\noffice visits in rosacea patients, as well as the providers seen and\ntreatments used. Better understanding of the reasons rosacea\npatients visit physicians may strengthen efforts to reach out to\npatients not currently being treated.\nMethods\nWe analyzed nationally representative data from the National\nAmbulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS), collected annually\nby the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) to assess the\nprovision of ambulatory patient care in the United States. Roughly\n30 000 visits per year are selected by stratified random sampling,\nand are weighted to produce national estimates of the number of\nvisits with particular characteristics. All outpatient visits to non-\nfederally-employed, office-based providers who provide direct\npatient care are eligible for sampling. Collected data include\npatient demographics, diagnoses, reasons for visit, treatments\nused and providers seen.\nof rosacea (ICD-9-CM code 695.3) were selected and the number\nof rosacea visits to each specialty was recorded. The sole inclusion\ncriterion was a diagnosis of rosacea according to the ICD-9-CM\ncode. To describe the symptoms that caused patients eventually\ndiagnosed with rosacea to come to the office, reason-for-visit\ncodes linked to the selected visits were tabulated. The reason for\nvisit is intended to record as accurately as possible the patient's\ncomplaint in their own words, often symptoms rather than\nspecific clinical diagnoses, and is not necessarily associated\nwith a particular clinical diagnosis (ICD-9-CM code) used for\nbilling. The reason-for-visit code is useful for identifying the\nsymptoms or events that led the patient to make a visit. Unlike\nfor the diagnosis, there is no specific reason-for-visit code defined\nas \"rosacea\"; rosacea is included in a category called \"other\ndiseases of the skin\". Other reason-for-visit codes identify fre-\nquently associated clinical symptoms, such as skin rash, or types\nof routine visit, such as general medical examination.\nTo assess variation in patients' experience with different\nphysician specialties, leading reasons for visit in dermatology\nand primary care visits were tabulated. Leading treatments pre-\nscribed in each year were determined. Linear regression (SAS\nPROC SURVEYREG) was used to assess changes over time in the\nfrequency with which specific rosacea treatments were used. All\ndata analysis was performed using SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary,\nNC) and the study was declared exempt by the Wake Forest\nBaptist Hospital Institutional Review Board.\nResults\nCorrespondence: Scott A. Davis MA, Department of Dermatology, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Medical Center Boulevard, Winston-Salem, NC\nincluded other diseases of the skin (25.3%), skin rash (19.6%),\ndiscoloration or abnormal pigmentation (14.7%), acne or pimples\n(11.9%) and general medical examination (6.0%; Table I). \"Other\ndiseases of the skin\" includes rosacea, as there is no separate\nreason-for-visit code indicating rosacea. In dermatology visits, the\nleading reasons were other diseases of the skin (31.0%), skin rash\n(18.5%), discoloration or abnormal pigmentation (18.5%), acne or\npimples (14.5%) and dryness/peeling/scaling/roughness of skin\n(6.2%). In primary care visits, the leading reason was skin rash\n(25.8%). Other reasons had too few visits for a statistically valid\nestimate, but included general medical examination, other dis-\neases of the skin, acne or pimples, and medication (other and\nunspecified kinds).\nThirty-one percent of patient visits among all specialties were\nclassified as visits for a new problem. In these visits, the leading\nreasons for visit were skin rash (29.1%), discoloration or abnormal\npigmentation (17.6%), other diseases of the skin (13.9%) and acne\nRosacea visits were most commonly managed by dermatolo-\ngists (72.4%), general and family practitioners (12.9%), internists\n(7.0%) and ophthalmologists (3.4%; Table II). On a per physician\nbasis, dermatologists managed 159.8 visits annually per physician,\nor about 77 times more than primary care physicians, who\nmanaged 2.1 visits annually per physician.\nThe leading treatments prescribed were topical metronidazole\ncycline (7.9%) and oral metronidazole (6.9%; Table III).\nDiscussion\nRosacea is treated most often by dermatologists, but primary care\nphysicians also have an important role to play. Primary care\nphysicians typically observe rosacea in a general medical exam-\nination or in a visit with complaint of skin rash. By contrast,\nthe leading reason for visit to dermatologists was \"other diseases\nof the skin\", probably indicating rosacea had already been\ndiagnosed. Discoloration or abnormal pigmentation was also a\ncommon reason for visit to dermatologists, suggesting that\npatients are bothered by the erythema associated with rosacea.\nThe leading treatments were all among those recognized as\neffective for rosacea, suggesting that rosacea is being treated\nappropriately once recognized (7,8). However, prescribing the\nright treatment does not guarantee successful outcomes; more\nstudies are needed to determine why patients do not take their\nrosacea medications as directed (9).\nBased on the estimate of 16 million Americans having rosacea,\nthe number of rosacea visits observed in our study indicates that\ntreatment in an average year. The percentage could even be\nconsiderably lower, to the extent that those patients who are\ngetting treated are making multiple visits. Primary care physicians\nmanage only about two visits per physician annually with a\ndiagnosis of rosacea, which may increase the likelihood of mis-\ndiagnosis. They also may code a more generic diagnosis code,\nsuch as skin rash, or refer the patient without making a diagnosis.\nPrimary care physicians should be encouraged to refer patients\nwith possible rosacea symptoms to dermatologists if they are\nuncertain of the correct diagnosis.\nLimitations of the study include the lack of specificity in the\nreason-for-visit codes available in the NAMCS. The NAMCS also\nsamples only single visits, so it is not possible to determine what\nsequence of providers or treatments were used over the course of\nmultiple visits. The NAMCS also does not give specific clinical\ndata that would indicate whether a provider failed to diagnose\nrosacea in a patient who had it. Patients who did not receive a\ndiagnosis of rosacea could not be included in the dataset. Despite\nthese limitations, the nationally representative sample improves\nconfidence in the overall picture of rosacea treatment patterns\npresented here.\nTable II.

A. Davis and S. R. Feldman\nThere are many opportunities to improve the care of rosacea\nsufferers. Improving awareness among both patients and primary\ncare providers may increase the chance that people with rosacea\nwill get the care they need. Since non-dermatologists tend to get\nvery limited dermatology training, curricula should educate all\nphysician trainees on recognizing rosacea (10). Understanding the\ntypical patient experience with rosacea will then permit providers\nto design appropriate tools for ensuring good adherence to the\ntherapies now available.\nCapsule summary\n. Many rosacea sufferers are not receiving effective treatment.\n. Leading reasons for visit were other diseases of the skin,\nskin rash, and abnormal pigmentation; dermatologists\nmanaged almost three-quarters of visits.\n. Obstacles to effective rosacea treatment include lack of\nawareness, misdiagnosis and nonadherence.\nDeclaration of interest: The Center for Dermatology Research is\nsupported by an unrestricted educational grant from Galderma\nLaboratories, L.P.
