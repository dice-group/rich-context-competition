The objective of this study was to verify the\nassociations between weight status and musculoskeletal pain and related symptoms in different body regions among workers.\nThe sample comprised 203 factory workers. Anthropometric measures were assessed with standardized protocols and body\nmass index (BMI) was calculated. Participants were classified as nonoverweight (BMI  24.9 kg/m2) or overweight/obese (BMI\n 25 kg/m2). Musculoskeletal pain and related symptoms was assessed with the Nordic Questionnaire of Osteoarticular\nSymptoms. The association of BMI and musculoskeletal pain and related symptoms was analyzed with logistic regression.\nOverweight/obese participants were more likely to have musculoskeletal pain and related symptoms in the shoulders (odds\nratio [OR] = 2.129, p = .023).

Overweight and obesity\nare well documented to be associated with major chronic ill-\nnesses, including hypertension, diabetes, arthritis, heart dis-\neases, cancer, and all cause mortality (Christensen et al.,\nbody weight has also been shown to increase the risk for\nmusculoskeletal pain (Han, Schouten, Lean, & Seidell,\n1997), sick leave, and early retirement from the workforce,\ncausing high socioeconomic costs (Christensen et al., 2011;\nTunceli & Williams, 2006; Verweij, Coffeng, van Mechelen,\n& Proper, 2011;). Obesity is associated with negative conse-\nquences in working populations, including more frequent\nabsenteeism, workplace injury and disability pension claims,\nand higher health care costs (Linde et al., 2012).\nIt is also known that musculoskeletal disorders related to\nwork are a major cause of disability in working-age indi-\nviduals (Christensen et al., 2011; Verweij, Proper, Weel,\nHulshof, & van Mechelen, 2009). Several studies have\nlinked obesity with musculoskeletal disorders and the repet-\nitive work (Christensen et al., 2011; Miranda, Viikari-\nJuntura, Martikainen, Takala, & Riihim\u00e4ki, 2001; Tunceli &\nAs employed adults spend approximately half their wak-\ning time at work, worksites provide a logical setting in which\nthe environment might be reshaped to promote healthier\nbehaviors and improve weight control. Employers may be\nmotivated to make changes due to concerns about quality or\ncost of employee health care (Osilla, 2012), and worksites\nmay be in a unique position to develop resources and promote\n1University of Porto, Portugal\n2Maia Institute of Higher Education, Portugal\nCorresponding Author:\nIsabel Moreira-Silva, Faculdade de Desporto da, Universidade do Porto,\nEmail: Isabel.moreira.silva@gmail.com\nAssociations Between Body Mass Index\nand Musculoskeletal Pain and Related\nSymptoms in Different Body Regions\nAmong Workers\nIsabel Moreira-Silva1, Rute Santos1,2, Sandra Abreu1 and Jorge\n Keywords\nmusculoskeletal disorders, worksite, body mass index\n2 SAGE Open\nsocial support among coworkers for obesity preventive\nbehaviors (Samuel, Raleigh, Hower, & Schwartz, 2003).\nEnvironmental changes that make conceptual sense for obe-\nsity prevention include targeting food service (i.e., availabil-\nity of energy-dense foods, portion sizes, cost), the physical\nenvironment (e.g., opportunities for exercise), and informa-\ntion distributed to increase knowledge of behaviors related to\nobesity risk (French, Story, & Jeffery, 2001; Hill, Wyatt,\nAccording to public health perspective, effective well-\ndocumented initiatives for reducing weight, improving phys-\nical capacity, and reducing musculoskeletal pain among\nhealth care workers are therefore needed. Moreover, there is\nlack of evidence about the association between weight status\nand musculoskeletal injury in different body regions.\nThe aim of this study was to verify the associations\nbetween weight status and musculoskeletal pain and related\nsymptoms in different body regions among workers.\nMethod\nStudy Design and Sampling\nThe present study derives from a larger research project on\nPhysical Activity at Worksite, which is aimed to decrease\nphysical disability, indicated by musculoskeletal disorders\nand related symptoms; increase work ability; and decrease\nsickness absence among workers with high physical work\ndemands.\nThis study was conducted from November 2010 to\nSeptember 2011, in a multinational manufacturing appli-\nances company with office in Portugal. These 11 months\nincluded preliminary evaluation, selection of experimental\ngroup (EG) and control group (CG), the intervention pro-\ngram that lasts 6 months along with tests performed at base-\nline and at the end of the intervention.\nFor the purpose of this study, we only use the baseline\ndata and limited the analysis to the variables under the scope\nof this study.\nThis study began by carrying out several introductory\nmeetings about the project: the administration board, the\nmedical department, production department, human\nresources department, as well as, the workers.\nAt the beginning of this intervention, 221 employees were\nagreed to participate (88 men; 124 women) in baseline tests\nand measures. The employees who did not participate did not\nsignificantly differ from those who agreed to participate,\nwith regard to age, gender, and body mass index (BMI; p >\n.05, for all). Some participants were not included in our anal-\nysis (n = 9) because their weight and height information was\nmissing. Therefore, the final sample comprised 203 partici-\nAll the participants were full-time workers (40 hr/week)\nand employed in the company for at least 6 months.\nAll participants in this study were informed of its goals\nand provided written informed consent to participate. The\nstudy was approved by the Faculty of Sport, University of\nPorto Ethics Committee; it was conducted in accordance\nwith the World Medical Association's Helsinki Declaration\nfor Human Studies.\nAnthropometry Measures\nBody height was measured to the nearest millimeter in bare\nor stocking feet with the participant standing upright against\na stadiometer (Holtain Ltd., Crymmych, Pembrokeshire,\nUnited Kingdom). Weight was measured to the nearest 0.10\nkg, lightly dressed using a portable electronic weight scale\n(Tanita Inner Scan BC 532, Tokyo, Japan). BMI was calcu-\nlated from the ratio between body weight (kg) and body\nheight (m2). Participants were categorized as nonoverweight,\noverweight, and obese, applying the cutoff points suggested\nPercentage of body fat (% BF) was estimated using a bio\nimpedance scale (Tanita Inner Scan BC 532, Tokyo, Japan),\nwhich was set to \"standard\" for body frame, and the partici-\npant's age, height, and gender were entered.\nWaist circumference was measured twice, with a nonelas-\ntic metal anthropometric tape, midway between the lower rib\nmargin and the iliac crest at the end of normal expiration\n(Lohman, Roche, & Martorell, 1988). The average of the two\nmeasures was used for analysis. If the two measurements dif-\nfered by more than 1 cm, a third measurement was taken and\nthe two closest measurements were averaged.\nSociodemographic Variables\nParticipants answered a questionnaire that assessed several\nsociodemographic variables (age, marital status, etc.).\nParticipants were divided according to their job position in\nfactory, that is, \"white-collars\" (skilled occupations) and\n\"blue-collars\" (unskilled and manual jobs).\nMusculoskeletal Disorders\nand Related Symptoms\nMusculoskeletal pain and related symptoms were assessed\nby Nordic Questionnaire of Musculoskeletal Disorders\n(NMQ; Kuorinka et al., 1987), supplemented with questions\nabout localized pain intensity. This questionnaire has been\nvalidated to the Portuguese population (Mesquita, Ribeiro, &\ntions (yes or no). The questionnaire has three questions cor-\nrelating to nine anatomic regions (neck, shoulders, writs/\nhands, lumbar region, dorsal region, hips/thighs, knees,\nankles/feet)--\"had some troubles or pain in the last 12\nmonths,\" \"in the last 12 months felt some limitation caused\nby work in the daily activities,\" and \"had some troubles or\npain in the last 7 days.\" In the sense of facilitating the\nMoreira-Silva et al. 3\nidentification of the corporal areas, the questionnaire also\nincludes a corporal diagram detaching all of the involved\ncorporal areas (Kuorinka et al., 1987). The pain intensity in\nthe \"last 7 days\" was included in the numeric pain scale\nStatistical Analysis\nDescriptive characteristics of the participants were presented\nas means \u00b1 standard deviation and percentages. The\nKolmogorov\u00adSmirnov test was used to assess the assump-\ntion of normality. Two-tailed t test was performed to com-\npare groups for continuous variables and 2 test for\ncategorical variables. The association between weight status\nand musculoskeletal pain and related symptoms was ana-\nlyzed with logistic regression adjusted for age, gender, and\njobs position. Only the significant results of logistic regres-\nsion models are presented. The data were analyzed for statis-\ntical significance by using the statistical package of social\nscience (SPSS 20.0) software for Mac OXS. A p value below\n.05 was denoted as significant.\nResults\nIn the total sample (n = 203), 38.4% was classified as over-\nweight and 22.2% as obese (Table 1). Overweight/obese par-\nticipants had higher proportion of \"blue-collars\" jobs\ncompared with nonoverweight participants (76.4% vs.\n23.6%, respectively, p = .013). No significant differences for\nage and proportion of gender were seen between weight\nstatus.\nAs depicted in Table 2, the overweight/obese participants\nreported more frequently musculoskeletal pain and related\nsymptoms in the shoulders (p = .007) and wrist/hand in the\nlast 12 months (p = .04) compared with their normal weight\ncounterparts.\nLogistic regression analysis showed that overweight/\nobese participants were more likely to have musculoskeletal\npain and related symptoms in the last 12 months in the shoul-\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we found that overweight/obese participants\nreported higher pain intensity only in shoulders and wrist/\nhand compared with their lean counterparts. The results sug-\ngested that overweight/obese participants were more likely\nto have musculoskeletal pain and related symptoms in the\nlast 12 months in the shoulders. This association was not\nconfounded by age, gender, and jobs position as it remained\nsignificant after adjustments.\nIn this study, a higher proportion (60.6%) of overweight/\nobesity was seen among workers. Likewise, a cross-sectional\nstudy has found overweight/obesity prevalence above 60%\namong Kuwait Oil Company workers (Al-Asi, 2003). Choi\net al, (2010) in a longitudinal study also showed that the\nprevalence of overweight/obesity increased significantly\nweight and obesity are more prevalent among blue-collar and\nshift workers than among white-collar and office workers\n(Karlsson, Knutsson, & Lindahl, 2001; Nakamura,\nstudy, we also found a higher proportion of overweight/obe-\nsity in blue-collar workers. Furthermore, obesity may repre-\nsent an additional risk factor for diseases that result from\nworkplace exposures (Schulte et al., 2007). These findings\nemphasize that efficient weight loss programs are highly rel-\nevant as health promotion for this sector. Indeed, we find an\nexample in a Danish workplace health promotion study with\nworkers. The study consisted in promoting correct ergo-\nnomic setup, frequent rest, stretching and strengthening\nexercises and showed a reductionin a few degrees of the\nTable 1.

This participatory intervention\nresulted in a modest improvement in health status and pos-\nsible unmeasured secondary gains, such as improved morale\nand increased productivity (Siegel, Prelip, Erausquin, &\nKim, 2010). Thus, some studies highlight the importance of\nthe reduction of body weight in sedentary works, to decrease\nthe risk to related musculoskeletal disorders and occupa-\ntional-psychosocial stress, and improve life quality\nIn our study, we found a positive association between\nBMI and musculoskeletal pain and related symptoms in last\n12 months in the shoulder and in the wrist/hand. Several\nstudies observed a positive association between overweight/\nobesity and increased risk of musculoskeletal disorders, sick-\nness absence, work disability, cardiovascular disease, and\nmortality (Schmier, Jones, & Halpern, 2006). It has also been\ndescribed that obesity appears to have a significant positive\nassociation with absenteeism (measured as work loss days;\nBungum, Satterwhite, Jackson, & Morrow, 2003; Schulte\nworkers with different jobs and shifts in an engineering plant,\nfound a significant association (p < .001) between high BMI\nand increased scores of musculoskeletal discomfort and\noccupational stress.

Bihari, Kesavachandran, Pangtey,\nSrivastava, and Mathur (2011) also found in cross-sectional\nstudy that the risk of musculoskeletal pain among over-\nweight/obese individuals was 1.7-times more as compared\nwith nonoverweight participants.\nSome limitations of the present study should be acknowl-\nedged. As in every cross-sectional study, conclusions related\nto cause and effect cannot be drawn. With the use of self-\nreported musculoskeletal pain and related symptoms, one\ncannot rule out some reporting bias; however, the question-\nnaire has been previously tested (Mesquita et al., 2010).\nBMI may not be a sensitive measure of body fatness when\nthere are some sophisticated methods to accurately measure\nbody fat, such as magnetic resonance imagining or dual-\nenergy X-ray. However, such techniques are not feasible to\napply in work environment, because they are complex and\ntime-consuming. Thus, BMI has been widely used as an\nindex of relative adiposity among adults and in studies of\nthe impact of work on obesity.\nConclusion\nIn our study, we found that overweight/obesity is positively\nassociated with musculoskeletal pain and related symptoms\nin shoulders among workers. This study provides the insight\nto the health professionals about the relationship between\nBMI and musculoskeletal pain and related symptoms, to for-\nmulate well-designed training program to avoid overweight.\n"
