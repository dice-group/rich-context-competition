    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe article reports on findings from the TALIS (Teaching and Learning International Survey) 2013 study for Abu Dhabi which\ngathered teachers' views on teaching and learning with a focus on professional development. The aim of this study is to better\nunderstand teachers' perceptions of professional development needs and impacts as well as the barriers faced by teachers\nfrom secondary schools in Abu Dhabi. The study provides some insights into the variations of those perceptions relative to\nother independent variables such as teachers' age and gender, and type of schools. With regard to the perceived need for\nprofessional development activities, the most significant variation is observed with regard to public or private schools. With\nregard to the impact of those activities, male teachers almost consistently assign higher perceived impact scores than female\nteachers. Public schools also assign higher perceived impact scores for all activities that they participated in. However, female\nteachers assign significantly higher perceived barrier scores to five of the seven listed barriers to participating in professional\ndevelopment activities. The research has implications for professional development providers to ensure the effectiveness of\nprofessional development opportunities for educators in Abu Dhabi.\n",

Developing an effective means of supporting\nand retaining teachers is crucial to creating a quality learning\nenvironment for students and a supportive work environment\nfor teachers (Evers, Van der Heijden, & Kreijns, 2016; Polly\net al., 2015). Professional development is necessary to fill in\nthe gaps in the skill sets of new teachers, and to continue to\ndevelop the expertise of teachers (Evers et al., 2016).\nProfessional development is necessary to keep the teacher\nup-to-date with the continuously changing practices, and stu-\ndent needs.\nSuccess requires teachers to be active learners and be a\ncoherent part of other well-planned professional development\nactivities. To improve teaching in the classroom, professional\ndevelopment must be collaborative, long term, and content\ndriven (Guskey & Yoon, 2009). Research also stresses that to\nbe successful, teachers need professional development that is\na sustained, intensive effort to improve teaching and learning\n(Richardson, 2003). Researchers have identified professional\ndevelopment program design elements thought to maximize\nteacher learning, including a strong content focus, inquiry-\noriented learning approaches, collaborative participation, and\ncoherence with school curricula and policies (Garet, Porter,\nSantagata, Kersting, Givvin, & Stigler, 2011).\nThe Organization for Economic Co-Operation and\nDevelopment's (OECD) \"Teaching and Learning International\ncountries (TALIS, 2013). The survey focuses on dimensions\nrelated to the working conditions of teachers, the learning envi-\nronment in schools, and the various efforts of school leadership\n(TALIS, 2013). A major part of TALIS is related to the profes-\nsional development of teachers. The survey reflects teachers'\nexperiences with regard to professional development. The\nexperiences cover most activities related to advancing teachers'\n1Abu Dhabi Education Council, United Arab Emirates\nCorresponding Author:\nMasood Badri, Executive Director, Research and Planning Division, Abu\nDhabi Education Council, P.O.

TALIS focuses of the different types of\nprofessional development opportunities teachers receive which\nincludes induction and mentoring programs. It examines a\nrange of variables or constructs. The variables are related to\nteachers and schools. The variables are thought to influence the\ntype and amount of professional development that a teacher\nundertakes. The survey also covers professional development\nneeds, and perceived impacts. Teachers are also given the\nchance to identify the barriers that prevent them from attaining\ntheir desired professional development.\nAbu Dhabi participated in two TALIS 2013 options: lower\nsecondary education (International Standard Classification\nof Education [ISCED] 1) and upper secondary education\n(ISCED 2). The Abu Dhabi Education Council (ADEC) is in\ncharge of the school system across the Emirate ofAbu Dhabi.\nADEC has stressed how critical it is for teachers to have\nongoing and regular opportunities to participate in profes-\nsional development programs. Abu Dhabi education system\nis unique compared with most countries. This would explain\nsome of the results we might obtain in this study. The current\nresearch may be considered a case study based on in-depth\ninvestigation of Abu Dhabi school practices with regard to\nteacher's professional development. The objective is to pro-\nvide a detailed description of the institutional setting within\nwhich teacher professional development take place to\nimprove our understanding of the context in which the vari-\nous relationships may be interpreted. The study examines the\nvariation of professional development in Abu Dhabi schools.\nThe objective of this study is to better understand teachers'\nperception of professional development needs, barriers,\nimpact, and durations. The study also identifies the effects of\ncharacteristics of teachers (gender and years of experience)\nand schools (public, private, or vocational) on teachers' per-\nceptions of professional development. The significance of\nthe study outlines how this investigation improves school\npractices. It seeks to understand the teachers' experience as\nthey participate in professional development. The current\nstudy is also inspired by many writings that stress the signifi-\ncance of teachers' continuous professional development in\nimproving educational performance and effectiveness\n(Girvan, Conneely, & Tangney, 2016). This study may\ninspire many ADEC policy makers who support the rele-\nvance of career-long opportunities for professional\ndevelopment.\nReview of Literature\nProfessional development should provide an important tactic\nfor improving schools, increasing teacher quality, and\nimproving student learning (Girvan et al., 2016; Opfer,\nNational Staff Development Council (NSDC; 2001) stresses\nthat professional development is rapidly being viewed as\nhigh-quality ongoing training programs with intensive fol-\nlow-up and on-the-job support. Hill, Beisiegel, and Jacob\n(2013) provided evidence based results to show that profes-\nsional development is significantly linked to student achieve-\nment. These findings and similar reported evidences point at\nthe impact of developing teachers' competencies (Meissel,\nParr, & Timperley, 2016). Quality professional development\ncan lead to important qualitative outcomes such as the cre-\nation of a positive school culture, citizenship, improvement\nin individual teacher skills, and development of opportuni-\nties for peer learning (Willemse, Dam, Geijsel, van Wessum,\nNeeds for Professional Development Activities\nTeachers learn best through professional development that\naddresses their needs (Meissel et al., 2016). The theoretical\nframework of adult learning theory shares the need for ongo-\ning quality professional development, which requires teach-\ners to become lifelong adult learners (Eleonora, 2003;\nHiebert, Gallimore, & Stigler, 2002). Professional develop-\nment needs include many different activities. Some activities\nfocus on students with special needs and managing the class-\nroom. Other activities involve designing curriculum and unit\nplanning (Garet et al., 2001; Pehmer, Groschner, & Seidel,\n2015). From the school administrative side, some suggested\nmanaging budgets and purchasing (Sair & Memiolu,\ning strategy support, information on where to search for\nneeded resources, classroom management, and parental\ninvolvement. Daresh (2003) also cited activities necessary\nfor beginner teachers to include how to plan classes, manage\nstudent behavior, and work within district rules). He also\nmentioned personal concerns and teaching concerns. In a\nsurvey of new teachers, Yohon (2005) identified assessment\ntools, student motivation, curriculum development, lesson\nplanning, and standards documentation. The recognition and\nrespect for the leadership abilities of teachers and all mem-\nbers of the school community is essential (Witte & Jansen,\n2016). Teachers need to be empowered to further develop\nexpertise in subject matter content, technologies, and other\nessential elements that lead to high standards or quality\nteaching (Korkko, Kyro-Ammala, & Turunen, 2016; Witte &\ndards that all professional development should follow. They\ninclude content knowledge and quality teaching, research-\nbasis, collaboration, diverse learning needs, student learning\nenvironments, family involvement, evaluation, data-driven\ndesign, and teacher learning.\nImpact of Professional Development Activities\nDevelopers and policy makers call for more rigorous evi-\ndence that describes how professional development design\nelements affect the likelihood of program success (Witte &\nprofessional development have some impact on the teachers'\nBadri et al. 3\nability to acquire and develop knowledge and skills. Gabriel,\nDay, and Allington (2011) noted the importance of emotional\nintelligence skills essential to good thinking, planning, and\ndealing with students and colleagues. Desimone (2009) note\nthe importance of the positive impact of professional devel-\nopment on the teachers' ability to decide on and implement\nvalued changes in teaching. Bolam (2002) stresses the impact\nof professional development on leadership behavior so that\nteachers could educate their students more effectively, thus\nachieving a desirable balance between individual, school and\nnational need.\nResearch shows that some professional developments do\nnot meet the threshold needed to produce strong effects on\ntheir practice or on student learning (Darling-Hammond &\nAdamson, 2010). E. Powell, Terrell, Furey, and Scott-Evans\n(2003) noted that professional development has both imme-\ndiate and long-term impacts. They add that the ability to\nreflect gives teachers better skills to better evaluate the effec-\ntiveness of their practice. Harris, Cale, and Musson (2011)\nreported that professional development helped teachers to\nexperience immediate positive impact on their perceptions of\nphysical education. Some studies noted that the long-term\nimpact of professional development has to do with develop-\ning greater confidence with their practice (Buczynski &\nForms of Professional Development Programs\nStructural features that affect teacher learning include the\nform of the professional developmental activity, collective\nparticipation, and the duration of the activity (Haslam &\nFor many teachers, professional development has been\nviewed as a task that generally involves a 1-day in-service\ntraining or workshop, with little or no expectation of what the\nteacher should do with the information or how the teacher\nshould share the information with other colleagues (Garet\nPorter, and Garet (2000) argued that compared with activities\nof shorter duration, the activities of longer duration have more\nsubject-area content focus, more opportunities for active\nlearning, and more coherence with teachers' other experi-\nences. This is further reinforced by Garet et al. (2001) asser-\ntion that longer professional development activities are more\nlikely to provide opportunities for in-depth discussion of the\ncontent, pedagogy, and student conceptions/misconceptions.\nThe authors also suggest that activities that extend over time\nare more likely to allow teachers more time to try out new\npractices in the classroom and obtain feedback on their teach-\nWith regard to forms of professional development, TALIS\n(2013) included in its survey nine different choices: courses/\nworkshops, education conferences or seminars, qualification\nprogram, observation visits to other schools, participation in\na network of teachers, individual or collaborative research on\na topic, and mentoring and/or peer observation and coaching.\nThese and other forms are also discussed in other studies\n(i.e., Birman et al., 2000; Erickson, Noonan, Brussow, &\nCollective participation refers to the interest of groups of\nteachers from the same school, department, or class (or grade\nlevel) in professional development (Garet et al., 2001). With\ncollective participation, the professional development pro-\ngrams are designed to help contribute to a shared culture of\nall participants. As a result, teachers from the same school,\ngrade level, or subject develop a common understanding.\nCommon themes might include instructional goals, methods,\nproblems, and solutions (Diaz Maggioli, 2012).\nBarriers and Support for Participating in\nProfessional Development Programs\nStudies show that many challenges exist with regard to the\neffective implementation of professional development. The\nforms of support can consist of paid working time and substi-\ntutions (often discouraged for budget and organizational rea-\nsons), funding costs sustained by teachers, salary incentives,\nbeing a condition for salary progression and promotion,\nnational policies and campaigns (such as the one in Sweden;\nOECD, 2005). The availability of collaboration, time, long-\nterm commitment, and resources are important for the suc-\ncessful implementation of professional development (Maria\n& Garc\u00eda, 2016). Many believe that the level of intensity of\nparticipation in professional development activities are par-\ntially a function of the sort of backing that teachers get to\nparticipate in them or the type of barriers they encounter\n& \u00d6zkana, 2015). North Central Regional Educational\nLaboratory (NCREL) cited the need for the educational com-\nmunity to move away from prior professional development\nmodels that occur only on teacher workdays, after school or\non weekends. The reallocation of resources--especially\ntime--was stressed. Furthermore, the restructuring of the\nteacher's work to create \"mental space\" was highly recom-\nmended (Drage, 2010). Other cited barriers to their fulfill-\nment include time, accessibility, staff motivation, marketing\nand advertising, and financial issues (Geldenhuys &\nOosthuizen, 2015). Age, staff shortages, unsupportive man-\nagers, staff attitude, availability of programs, work pressure,\nfamily commitments, unsafe environments, and participation\non own time are also identified as barriers (Drage, 2010;\nFactors Affecting Variations in Professional\nDevelopment Perceptions\nIn TALIS 2008, one could analyze the disparity in the take-up\nof professional development within countries by examining\nparticipation with respect to teachers and schools\n4 SAGE Open\ncharacteristics. The teacher and school characteristics chosen\nreflected the interest of policy makers in each country. With\nregard to the duration of professional development activities,\non average, there was no statistically significant difference\nbetween male and female teachers across participating coun-\ntries. On average, younger teachers received more profes-\nsional development. This indicates that, on average,\nmore-experienced teachers receive less days of professional\ndevelopment than less-experienced teachers. On average,\nteachers from private schools had 1 day less professional\ndevelopment than their public school counterparts. However,\nthe difference is not statistically significant. A study by\nAmanulla and Aruna (2014) revealed that there are significant\ndifferences between male and female teachers, government\nand private schoolteachers, and more-experienced and less-\nexperienced teachers in the mean scores of items related to\nprofessional development.Alade and Odebode (2014) showed\nthat age, gender, educational qualification, and years of teach-\ning experience had no significant influence on the benefits\nderived by teachers' from the Professional Development\nProgram. Sair (2014) showed mixed results of for the differ-\nence between male and female teachers regarding certain pro-\nfessionaldevelopmentneeds.Basedonseniority,nosignificant\ndifferences were observed in teacher views regarding their\nprofessional development needs in most categories.\nIndependent Variables of Teacher's Age, Gender,\nand Type of Schools\nIn general, TALIS results showed that on average across par-\nticipating countries, there is no statistically significant differ-\nence between male and female teachers with regard to days\nof participation (TALIS, 2013). A study by (Hustler,\nMcNamara, Jarvis, Londra, & Campbell, 2003) showed that\nmale teachers were slightly less likely to have a positive atti-\ntude toward professional development than their female\ncounterparts although the difference was minimal.\nInternational literature identifies teacher's age as a deter-\nminant of professional development take-up (Desimone,\nSmith, & Ueno, 2006; Richter, Kunter, Klusmann, L\u00fcdtke, &\naverage, the amount of professional development that teach-\ners received decreased with the age of the teacher. This indi-\ncates that on average less-experienced teachers receive more\ndays of professional development than more-experienced\nteachers.\nThe TALIS (2013) results showed that on average\nteachers in public schools had 1 day more professional\ndevelopment than their private school counterparts, a dif-\nference that is not statistically significant. A study by the\nU.S. Department of Education (1997) concluded that pub-\nlic schoolteachers were more likely to participate in pro-\nfessional development activities. Their study showed that\npublic schoolteachers were more likely to participate in\nprofessional development.\nThe TALIS Study\nIn general, the TALIS survey, fairly represented the impor-\ntant features of teachers'professional development addressed\nby research. The survey addressed many variables. The vari-\nables include rate of participation, professional development\nactivities and topics (including subject matters), and the\nexperienced impact of professional development activities. It\nalso included some others skills that are addressed by the\nschool's human resource development requirements and\ncontinuous teachers' professional development. The survey\nalso covered preferred teaching strategies, and experienced\nneeds, and barriers to participation in professional develop-\nment. Other variables covered the relevant characteristics of\nthe school. The survey also required teachers to provide\nsome descriptive background characteristics (i.e., age, gen-\nder, and experience). Teachers were also asked to portray\ntheir attitudes and beliefs with regard to professional devel-\nopment activities.\nThe conceptual framework developed by TALIS related to\nteachers' professional development hypothesized some associ-\nations between the form and content of professional develop-\nment, with characteristics of teachers, schools, and the national\neducation context (TALIS, 2013). It focused on continuous\nprofessional development in schools, which has a particular\nimpact on co-operation within school teams, peer review, and\nhuman resources development. TALIS also asked teachers to\ndeclare the average number of teachers' days during the past\nyear. To identify best practices in professional development,\nresearchers then compare variability in program content with\nvariability in these outcomes (Meissel et al., 2016).\nMethod\nStudy Instrument and Distribution\nThe TALIS survey asked teachers about their participation in\nprofessional development activities during the 12 months\nbefore the survey. The survey was designed in an orderly\nfashion. It included dimensions (and items or variables) cov-\nering the support teachers received for undertaking these pro-\nfessional development activities, their impact or effect, the\nareas of their schoolwork that they found most in need of fur-\nther training and development, and the barriers they felt had\npaused some challenges to prevent them from undertaking\nadditional development activities. Teachers were provided\nwith 14 specific topics to identify which they have partici-\npated in. The topics included, approaches to individual learn-\ning, student evaluation and assessment practices, pedagogical\ncompetencies in teaching the subject field, and teaching stu-\ndents with special needs. For each of the 14 topics, they were\nasked to assign the appropriate impact on teaching score.\nThe TALIS survey also asked teachers about the form of\nsupport they got for their participation in the various profes-\nsional development activities. The type of option supports\nincluded scheduling of activities, providing salary supplement,\nBadri et al. 5\nand other non-monetary support (i.e., decreased teaching time,\nstudy leave, days off, etc.). To better understand participation in\nprofessional development and provide insight into potential\npolicy implications, TALIS asked teachers to indicate barriers\nto their participation.\nAbu Dhabi participated in TALIS 2013. The survey was\navailable online in both Arabic and English. The Arabic ver-\nsion of the survey was developed by ADEC with validation\nand feedback as well as final approval from the OECD. A\nletter from the Director General of ADEC and the OECD\nwent to the selected schools requesting their participation.\nStudy Sample\nThe sample of schools and teachers were identified randomly\nby the OECD team. In each participating country, a mini-\nmum representative sample of at least 20 teachers from each\nof 200 schools was randomly selected. The international tar-\nget population for TALIS included lower secondary teachers\nand their school leaders in both public and private schools.\nFor Abu Dhabi, teachers from both lower and upper sec-\nondary schools were included. Both public and private\nschoolteachers were asked to participate. Two types of public\nschools were involved: regular public schools and vocational\npublic schools. A total of 4,941 teachers participated. A total\nwere male (44.9%). This sample shows that a smaller pro-\nportion of teachers were female than in most other TALIS\ncountries (compared with 68.1% in OECD countries). The\nyears, and a mode of 40 years. Teachers from Abu Dhabi\nwere on average younger than those in most other TALIS\ncountries (relative to 42.9 years in OECD countries). On\naverage, teachers from Abu Dhabi had spent fewer years\nteaching than those in most other TALIS countries (12.8\nyears relative to 16.2 years). A smaller proportion of teachers\nhad completed a teacher education or training program than\nTeachers from both private and public schools were\nselected by the OECD to participate in TALIS. Around 2,352\nteachers from public schools and 2,553 teachers from private\nschools participated in the study. From the Abu Dhabi public\nschools, 152 teachers came from the technical or vocational\nschools. With regard to teachers' age, among the teachers\nyears or older.\nResearch Questions and Analysis\nIn general, the TALIS study is complex survey sample\ndata. The international TALIS (2013) documentation pro-\nvides guidance on the appropriate analysis and estimation\nprocedures. TALIS uses sampling weights with a complex\nmulti-stage cluster sample. Such sampling method requires\nappropriate software and analysis. The analysis incorpo-\nrates the replication weights to obtain appropriate variance\nestimates.\nThis research was done to express the professional\ndevelopment programs for teachers from Abu Dhabi using\nthe TALIS data. It is important to learn different approaches\nin different countries to get benefit from the good exam-\nples. In the field of education, Abu Dhabi has not received\nenough international attention. Results of this study would\nprovide more insights in the professional development of\nteachers in an era of education reform in Abu Dhabi. This\nstudy seeks to answer the following questions:\nResearch Question 1: What are the teachers' perceptions\nof the most needed professional development activities?\nResearch Question 2: What are the forms of professional\nactivities that produced the highest impact on teachers'\nknowledge for teaching?\nResearch Question 3: What are the main activities of\nprofessional development that teachers participated in?\nResearch Question 4: What are the teachers' perceived\nbarriers to their participation in professional\ndevelopment?\nResearch Question 5: How the various teacher percep-\ntions about professional development need and impact are\neffected by teacher features (gender, age, and\nexperience)?\nResearch Question 6: How the various teacher percep-\ntions about professional development need and impact are\neffected by school features (public/private) and (general/\nvocational)?\nPredominantly, descriptive statistics will be used to explain\nthe outcomes with regard to the study items. In addition, analy-\nsis of variance will be used to identify differences with regard to\nteachers'gender and age, type of school (public or private), and\ntype of public school (regular or vocational).\nWith regard to age of teachers (five categories),\nMANOVA will be conducted across the variables of\ninterest. MANOVA is used to determine whether there\nare any differences between independent groups on more\nthan one continuous dependent variable. It should be\nadded that MANOVA can detect differences too small to\nbe detected through individual ANOVAs. MANOVA can\nalso capture multivariate patterns if present (see Huberty\nAs a final initiative, a teacher's focus group will be\nformed. The ADEC Cluster Managers will be asked to pro-\nvide names of some distinguished teachers. Several teachers\nwill be invited from the various schools in Abu Dhabi. The\nteachers will be asked to elaborate on the results of this study.\nTheir feedback will be integrated with the recommendations\nof this research and its implications for ADEC or school\npolicy makers.\n6 SAGE Open\nTable 1.

Shaded cells indicate ANOVA significant\nResults\nProfessional Development Needs\nIn Abu Dhabi, in both public and private schools, teachers\nare not explicitly obliged to engage in professional develop-\nment activities. TALIS asked teachers to provide their per-\nception of the type of professional developments needed.\nThe survey included 14 topics or activities as shown in\nTable 1. Teachers were asked to rate their development need\nin various aspects of their work. A 4-point scale from \"low\nlevel of need\" to \"high level of need\" was used. The aspect\nof teachers' work that was, on average, most frequently\nrated by teachers as an area of high development need in\nAbu Dhabi was \"new technologies in workplaces\" and\n\"teaching students with special needs.\" Other aspects of\nteachers' work in which, on average, sizable proportions of\nteachers reported having a high level of development need\nwere \"approaches to develop cross-occupational competen-\ncies for future work/studies\" and \"information and commu-\nnication technology (ICT) skills for teaching.\" In contrast,\nthe aspects of teachers' work that, on average, received low-\nest scores were \"knowledge and understanding of my sub-\nject field(s)\" and \"knowledge of the curriculum.\"\nProfessional Development Activities' Impacts\nTALIS asked teachers to report on the impact of their profes-\nsional development activities on their own development as\nteachers. The survey first asked teachers whether they have\nparticipated in any of the previously mentioned 14 professional\nneed activities. For those teachers who provided a \"yes\" reply,\nthe survey further asked them to identify the impact of partici-\npating in those activities on teaching and learning. Teachers\nwere asked to rate their perception on a 4-point scale from low\nlevel of impact to high level of impact. Because TALIS reports\nteachers' self-perceptions, the results should be treated with\nsome caution, especially if teachers' perception of impact is to\nreflect the effectiveness of the professional development activi-\nties they participated in. Nevertheless, we could presume that if\nteachers feel that a certain professional developmental activity\nhas had limited impact, this is likely to affect their decisions\nregarding future participation in that activity.\nResults from Table 2 show that the three highest profes-\nsional development activities that teachers participated in are\nrelated to \"student evaluation and assessment practices\"\n(84.5%), \"pedagogical competencies in teaching own subject\"\n(79.9%), and \"student behavior and classroom management\"\n(78.1%). Table 2 also shows the mean scores of the general\nperceived impact of the activities teachers participated in on\nteaching. The teacher's consistent positive view of the impact\nof all types of professional development activities is noticeable\n(all values above 3.0). On average, in Abu Dhabi, teachers\nreported that the highest impact was related to \"knowledge of\nthe curriculum,\" and \"knowledge and understanding of my\nsubject field(s).\" It should be noted that those two activities\nreceived the lowest perception need scores as shown in Table 1.\nPerceived Barriers to Their Participation in\nProfessional Development\nTALIS asked teachers about the barriers to take more profes-\nsional development. It asked teachers to indicate the reasons\nBadri et al. 7\nthat had prevented them from enrolling in more activities.\nSuch information is thought to provide more information for\nbetter policy making with regard to professional develop-\nment with regard to its make-up. They were given seven\noptions to choose from. Table 3 provides the responses given\nby Abu Dhabi teachers. Results show that in general, the two\nfactors related to \"too expensive/unaffordable,\" \"lack of\nincentives,\" and \"professional development conflicting with\nwork schedule\" received the highest scores.\nAbu Dhabi also reports that \"conflict with work schedule\"\nwas most frequently reported as a barrier (42% of teachers).\nThe conflict with work schedule would find the timing of\ncertain professional development activities to be not appro-\npriate. Family, responsibilities were reported as a barrier by\n23.8% of teachers on average. Almost the same percentage\nof those who did not participate at all in professional devel-\nopment reported this as a barrier. In Abu Dhabi, teachers\nhave the option of enrolling in various professional develop-\nment activities for free, and during regular working hours.\nAs further inquiries, TALIS asked teachers about the type\nof support received for participating in professional devel-\nopment. Approximately 54.9% of Abu Dhabi teachers\nrecorded that they participated in certain professional devel-\nopment activities during regular working hours.\nApproximately 81.2% of teachers noted that they did not\nreceive a salary supplement for activities outside working\nhours. In addition, only 12.9% of teachers noted that they\nreceived non-monetary support for participating in certain\nprofessional activities outside working hours.\nType of Professional Development and Durations\nWith regard to impact of professional developments types, it\nis assumed that teacher responses are direct or indirect reflec-\ntions of the general experience. Table 4 shows nine types of\nprofessional development activities that teachers were asked\nto state whether they have participated in, during the current\nyear. The four types that received the highest percent partici-\npation were courses and workshops (83.6%), mentoring and\ncoaching (63.0%), education conferences or seminars\nThe two types that received the lowest participation scores\nwere qualification program (16.6%) and observation visits to\nother schools (29.9%). The table also shows that courses and\nworkshops (11.66 days) had the highest mean for the dura-\ntion of the professional development type.\nTeacher Gender Differences\nAnalysis of variance was performed to see whether there are\nsignificant differences between female and male teachers\nwith regard to their perceived needs for professional develop-\nment. Results in Table 1 show that there are no significant\ndifferences (.05) except with regard to three professional\nTable 2.

As\nTable 2 shows, significant differences were observed\nbetween male and female teachers with regard to the per-\nceived impact on teaching and learning of nine of those\nactivities. Three activities were related to the subject and\ncurriculum: knowledge and understanding of my subject\nfield(s), pedagogical competencies in teaching my subject\nfields(s), and knowledge of the curriculum. One activity\nwas related to ICT skills. The other activities were related\nto student evaluation and assessment practices, approaches\nto individualized learning, teaching students with special\nneeds, developing cross-occupational competencies, and\nnew technologies in workplaces.\nResults in Table 3 show that significant differences exist\nbetween male and female teachers with regard to certain bar-\nriers related to professional development. For both male and\nfemale teachers, the highest score was assigned to the barrier\nrelated to \"there are no incentives for participation.\" Male\nteachers assign significantly higher barrier scores to the fol-\nlowing five barriers: lack of employer support, conflict with\nwork schedule, not having time because of work schedule,\nfamily responsibilities, and lack of relevant provisional\ndevelopment offered.\nTable 4.

The activities that do not show significant differ-\nences are related to school management and administration,\nteaching cross-curricular skills (e.g., problem solving and\nlearning to learn), and approaches to develop cross-occupa-\ntional competencies for future work or future studies. Private\nschoolteachers show greater needs for almost all activities\nexcept for the activity related to teaching students with spe-\ncial needs; for this, public schoolteachers showed lower per-\nceived needs.\nAnalysis of variance shows that teachers from public and\nprivate schools show significantly different perceptions of\nthe impact of professional development activities (Table 2).\nSignificant differences are recorded with regard to three out\nof the 14 activities. No significant differences were recorded\nwith respect to activities related to student behavior and\nclassroom management, school management and administra-\ntion, and teaching in a multicultural or multilingual setting. It\nis interesting to note that teachers from public schools con-\nsistently assign higher impact scores with regard to all pro-\nfessional development activities they have taken.\nTable 3 shows that perceptions of professional develop-\nment barriers are significantly different between teachers\nfrom public and private schools with regard to five aspects:\n\"I do not have the pre-requisites,\" \"there is a lack of employer\nsupport,\" \"professional development conflicts with my work\nschedule,\" \"there is no relevant professional development\noffered,\" and \"there are no incentives for participating.\"\nTeachers from private schools assign higher barrier scores to\nnot having pre-requisites, lack of employer support, and no\nrelevant professional development offered. On the contrary,\nteachers from public schools assign higher barrier scores to\nconflict with work schedule, and lack of incentives for\nparticipating.\nDifferences Between General Public and\nVocational Public Schoolteachers\nWith regard to the perceived needs for professional develop-\nment activities, Table 1 shows that significant differences\nexist between teachers from regular public schools and voca-\ntional schools with regard to three activities only. The three\nactivities are related to knowledge and understanding of my\nsubject field(s), teaching students with special needs, and\nteaching cross-curricular skills (e.g., problem solving and\nlearning to learn). For all three activities, teachers from regu-\nlar public schools score relatively much higher needs.\nTable 2 shows that teachers from regular public schools\nand vocational public schools show significant differences in\nimpact for only six professional development activities. The\nactivities with significant differences for the two types of\nschools are knowledge and understanding of my subject,\npedagogical competencies in teaching my subject fields(s),\nknowledge of the curriculum, student evaluation and assess-\nment practices, approaches to individualized learning, and\nstudent career guidance and counseling. Interestingly, teach-\ners from regular public schools show higher impact scores\nfor all professional activities.\nTable 3 results show that teachers from regular public\nschools and vocational public schools show significant dif-\nferences for only three professional development barriers:\nnot having the pre-requisites, professional development con-\nflicting with work schedule, and lack of relevant professional\ndevelopment offered. Teachers from regular public schools\nassign higher barrier scores to not having the pre-requisites,\nwhereas teachers from vocational schools see that conflict\nwith work schedule and lack of relevant professional devel-\nopment offered pose larger barriers.\nAge Group Differences\nTable 5 provides the general MANOVA results. We used\nMANOVA to test the null hypothesis that the perceived\nneeds for professional activities are the same across the five\nteachers' age groups. The Wilks's Lambda provides a value\n.001 level. As a result, we followed the analysis up with a\nseries of one-way ANOVAs to see individual differences\nbetween the 14 professional development needs. Significant\nresults were resulted between almost all age groups. The\ninteresting thing here is that for most of the 14 variables, as\nthe teacher becomes older, the mean score related to per-\nceived need goes down (negative correlation). However,\nthere is a positive relationship between the teacher's age and\nperceived need only with regard to two professional develop-\nment activities. These variables include ICT skills for teach-\ning and new technologies in workplaces.\nTable 5.

MANOVA test reveals a sig-\nperceived barriers to participate in professional development\nactivities for the different teachers' age groups. The series of\none-way ANOVAs show that significant differences exist\nwith regard to teachers' age for all the seven barriers to pro-\nfessional development.\nIn general, results show that as teacher's age goes up, only\ntwo perceived mean barriers go down: \"I do not have the pre-\nrequisites,\" and \"there is a lack of employer support.\" With\nregard to the other barriers, mixed results are witnessed. For\nall seven barriers, the highest perceived barriers are claimed\nlowest perceived barriers are witnessed with teachers who\nare aged 25 years or less, and those who are aged 40 years or\nabove.\nOn average, amongAbu Dhabi teachers, the amount of pro-\nfessional development that teachers received decreased with\nage. If age of a teacher is associated with his or her work expe-\nrience as a teacher, then this finding indicates that, on average,\nless-experienced teachers received more days of development\nthan more-experienced teachers. With regard to age, signifi-\ncant differences were observed with regard to 10 of the 14\nprofessional development activities. For all four activities on\nthis construct, no significant differences with regard to age\nwere related to teaching in a multicultural or multilingual set-\npational competencies for future work or future studies (F =\np  .109), and student career guidance and counseling (F =\ndevelopment activities, as age of teachers increase, the per-\nceived level of need tends to go down.\nAnalysis of variance with regard to age of teachers and\nthe perceived impact of professional activities revealed the\nexistence of significant differences with regard to six activi-\nties only. These activities were related to knowledge and\nunderstanding of my subject field(s)/impact, pedagogical\ncompetencies in teaching my subject fields(s)/impact, stu-\ndent evaluation and assessment practices/impact, ICT skills/\nimpact, student behavior and classroom management/impact,\nand developing cross-occupational competencies/impact.\nAgain, in general, when age increases, the perception of\nimpact of professional activities decreases.\nOlder teachers assign significantly higher scores to almost\nall listed items than younger teachers (except for profes-\nsional development being too expensive and unaffordable)\nwhere no significant difference is recorded.\nDiscussions\nFor Abu Dhabi, many of the teacher professional develop-\nment programs were meaningful and relevant because they\nhad transferrable impact in the classroom and a focus on\nguided practice. Teachers felt that programs related to knowl-\nedge of the curriculum, knowledge and understanding of\none's subject field, and student evaluation and assessment\npractices had the greatest impacts. Out of the 14 professional\nneed activities, teachers also gave a high score for \"teaching\nstudents with special needs.\" This finding is significant,\nbecause TALIS targets population did not include teachers\nwho only teach students with special learning needs. It is\nprobably a reflection of current trends in educational policy\nparticularly in Abu Dhabi. The first trend deals with the inte-\ngration (or inclusion) of students with special learning needs\nin mainstream schools (inclusive education). The other trend\ndeals with the growing emphasis on equity. This result is an\nindication that teachers fromAbu Dhabi do not feel fully pre-\npared to cope with these challenges.\nAs further simple correlation analysis reveals a negative\noverall correlation of (-.705) existing between teachers'\noverall perception of the needs for professional development\nand the impact of professional development items. As the\nperceived need decreases, the perceived impact increases.\nThe negative correlation between teachers' perceived need\nfor and perceived impact of professional development should\nbe noted by ADEC and school decision makers. For Abu\nDhabi, results might indicate the lack of teacher understand-\ning of what professional development is needed.\nResults showed that male teachers perceived more need\nfor school management and administration, and more teach-\ning in a multicultural or multilingual setting. Most teachers\ncome from other cultures other than the United Arab\nEmirates. The findings are consistent with literature indicat-\ning that teachers' understanding of school management, in\nfact, is often dependent on their knowledge of students' cul-\nture and backgrounds, language proficiency, and academic\nneeds. Wong and Snow (2000) indicated that teachers must\nunderstand student culture and backgrounds, prior experi-\nences, culture, and language diversity to successfully teach\nthem, which is important for classroom management prac-\ntices to be successful and appropriate for the students' needs.\nInterestingly, the focused group discussions noted the fact\nthat teachers in private schools in Abu Dhabi may undertake\nprofessional development, and pay for them by themselves,\nto increase the possibility of obtaining a permanent position\nin public schools. Many teachers thought that such profes-\nsional development activities improve the rating of teachers\non which the appointment to public schools is based. Policy\nmakers may wish to explore approaches to engage teachers\nand procure their investment in the process, perhaps by\naccepting recommendations from teachers or teacher com-\nmittees about staff development priorities, setting aside time\nto meet with teachers about their professional development\nlearning plans, or speaking regularly to teachers to articulate\na vision for how the administrative professional develop-\nment priorities can enhance teachers' performance and even\njob satisfaction.\nThe most significant barrier to participating in profes-\nsional development was related to conflict with work sched-\nule. Literature on professional development frequently\naddresses scheduling and logistical issues, and such concepts\nmust be considered in any discussion of what it means to\nhave a sustained professional learning community (Witte &\nJansen, 2016) in which teachers are able to be learners in an\nongoing context. Family responsibilities were reported as a\nbarrier by 23.8% of teachers on average.\nThere is a significant negative correlation between the\nextent to which teachers reported a lack of incentives or suit-\nable professional development and the amount of profes-\nsional development they actually had. In Abu Dhabi, on\naverage, teachers who reported a lack of suitable incentives\nof participating in professional development actually partici-\npated in a smaller number of days of professional develop-\nment. As a result, there is a strong indication that there is\nhigh association between the perceived lack of suitable\ndevelopment opportunities and the amount of professional\ndevelopment teachers enroll in. The lack of incentives and\nlack of suitable professional development seem to be rela-\ntively acute in Abu Dhabi.\nThe teacher's focus group discussions revealed a lack of\nclear professional development program philosophy, stan-\ndards, and goals. They also revealed a lack of deep and\nmeaningful involvement on the part of teachers in profes-\nsional development planning, implementation, and evalua-\ntion.Again, references to the importance of a strong structure\nfor professional development programming, and the neces-\nsity of teachers being involved in the planning, implementa-\ntion, and evaluation of professional development existed\nThe teachers' focus group stressed that relatively little\nprofessional development program evaluation was con-\nducted to determine the value professional development has\non teachers' perception not only of the impact on their teach-\ning practice but also of the effect on student achievement.\nThis point is raised by other researchers too (Meissel et al.,\nneed assessment tools such as the NSDC's (2001) Standards\nfor Staff Development. In addition, ADEC and school policy\nmakers should conduct a need assessment regarding teach-\ners' professional development needs, and evaluate profes-\nsional development participation for impact regarding\neffective teaching practices.\nConclusions, Implications, Future\nResearch Directions, and Limitations\nADEC should seek to balance the academic and emotional\nlearning needs of teachers, particularly those who are new to\nAbu Dhabi and may be undergoing significant acculturation\nand adjustment experiences. If policy is not responsive in\nthis manner, teachers find themselves under increased bur-\nden, and they are unable to attend to what they perceive as\nthe much more important task of understanding their stu-\ndents'cultural backgrounds, family and home situations, and\nemotional needs. Increased time for teachers from other\nnationalities to gain better cultural understanding would\nallow teachers to devote time to supporting students in a\nmore effective manner.\nPolicy makers should allow for some participant choice in\ndetermining professional development offerings. Although\nresearch suggests that teachers need a core set of knowledge\nin specific topics, particularly with respect to diverse learn-\ners (Ballantyne, Sanderman, & McLaughlin, 2008), this\nstudy suggests that teachers find most opportunity for\nengagement when they have the chance to select among a\nmenu of topics and to customize their professional develop-\nment experiences to their experience, prior knowledge, and\nstudent populations. This may be accomplished by allowing\nparticipants to complete various differentiated activities, pro-\nviding a choice of face-to-face workshops, or some other\nmeans such as online workshops (Dede, Ketelhut,\nWhitehouse, Breit, & McClosey, 2009; Maria & Garc\u00eda,\n2016). Within Abu Dhabi schools, this study found the need\nto more effectively plan, implement, and evaluate profes-\nsional development program philosophy and activities and to\ninclude and engage teachers in these processes. Teachers\nshared that they are not meaningfully involved in the pro-\ncesses of professional development planning, implementa-\ntion, and evaluation. This finding was consistent with that of\nprevious research that details the value of involving teachers\nThe responses of Abu Dhabi teachers in this TALIS study\nsuggest that teachers appeared to identify classroom man-\nagement as an important topic for staff development. This is\nalso mirrored in the literature, where researchers suggest that\nclassroom management may, in fact, have a number of other\ncomponents which affect students'ability to successfully fol-\nlow requirements and achieve (Polly et al., 2015; Mastropieri\nIt should be noted that the Abu Dhabi education system\nhas a unique setting, especially with regard to public schools.\nBoys and girls are segregated starting from the fifth grade.\nAccording to ADEC records in 2015, in girl public schools,\nfemale UAE national teachers comprise 47.78% of the\nfemale teacher's workforce. On the contrary, in boys'\nschools, male UAE national teachers comprise less than\neign UAE teachers). According to ADEC 2015 records, for\nthe male teachers from public schools, teachers come from\nmore than 118 nationalities. As a result, Abu Dhabi has\nincreasing numbers of culturally and linguistically diverse\nteachers. Teachers whose professional development may not\nhave addressed those students' particular needs often find\nthat their skills and current knowledge base are not sufficient\nto help students. Therefore, an increasingly important area of\nteacher education and professional development involves\nproviding teachers information about cultural and linguistic\ndiversity, as it affects both typical and atypical learners, help-\ning teachers to identify effective teaching practices to meet\nthe needs of students.\nResults showed that teachers participated most in profes-\nsional development programs where a group of colleagues\nfrom their school or subject group actively communicated\nwith each other. The researchers recommend making social\nnetworking (face-to-face or online) a more frequent part of\nschool activities and professional development structures. As\nseveral teachers also indicated, some of their most formative\nlearning experiences came in the form of peer-to-peer inter-\nactions with colleagues. Mentoring activities, pairing teach-\ners for work on particular tasks or for participation in\nparticular professional development activities--all of these\nmay help to increase opportunities for teachers to interact\nwithin contexts, providing the opportunity for an exchange\nof knowledge. The results also suggest that school leaders\nmake an effort to consciously expand their expectations and\ntheir conceptual frameworks so as to view such informal\nsocial networking within the context of its relationship to\ntechnology. It may be easy for administrators to think that\nfaculty meetings should not include time to socialize or that\nsuch socializing distracts everyone from focusing on school\ngoals and objectives.\nSome related research addressed the causal links between\nteachers' continuing professional development, their active\nparticipation in professional development, and their beliefs\nabout learning and teaching (de Vries, van de Grift, & Jansen,\n2013). Because the TALIS survey includes variables related\nto teachers' beliefs and their need to participate in profes-\nsional development, future research should try to better\nunderstand the causal linkage between participation in pro-\nfessional development, activities, and teachers' beliefs about\nlearning and teaching.\nForAbu Dhabi schools, especially public schools, most pro-\nfessional development programs are centralized and mainly\noffered through ADEC. Future research should look into the\nquestion of the implications of this system-level factor.\nAlthough TALIS did not directly reference online learning\nexperiences, the researchers recommend that practitioners, as\nwell as researchers, continue to explore feasibility of, and\nteachers'responses to, online professional development initia-\ntives. For Abu Dhabi, the lack of teacher feedback or response\nto online professional development may, in fact, be more\nreflective of a lack of exposure to online professional develop-\nment opportunities, rather than a negative set of experiences in\nactual online experiences. The introduction of web-based\ninformation technology has presented new opportunities for\noffering professional development and knowledge online\n(Fore, Feldhaus, Sorge, Agarwal, & Varahramyan, 2015;\n2016). With their feature of no time or space limitations, web-\nbased resources can provide teachers with a more flexible way\nof pursuing professional development. While enhancing\nteachers' willingness to participate in online courses, it can\nalso motivate them to gradually change their teaching from\ntraditional ways (e.g., face-to-face lectures, single location) to\na more flexible and adjustable approach based on individual\nneeds (Hartley, 2010). Future research should try to link some\nTALIS variables with other variables related to web-based\nprofessional development of teachers.\nBecause the TALIS research involved teachers from only\nlower and upper secondary schools, the researcher recom-\nmends replicating this study to determine the generalizability\nand relevance of the findings across other schools and teacher\nor student populations. The new studies would provide use-\nful information to supplement, corroborate, or further con-\ntextualize the findings of this study. In addition, future\nresearch may replicate this study with a larger teacher popu-\nlation, so as to determine whether the same patterns, themes,\nand findings are consistent across a larger group of teachers\n(situated either in one school or in a cluster of schools).\nThe study's findings suggest that the structure and type of\nprofessional development offered in schools can affect the\ndegree to which teachers feel professional development\nmeets their needs. It is also recommended that researchers\nconduct further research on restructuring of school-based\nprofessional development opportunities so as to further\nteachers' engagement, investment, and ability for long-term\ninvolvement with a particular issue.\nFor Abu Dhabi, this study has given rise to important\nquestions that could be addressed by teachers and research-\ners working in partnership to expand the knowledge base in\nthe field of teacher professional development:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Under what conditions does teacher learning that is\nassociated with professional development get trans-\nferred to the classroom?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 What are the effects on student learning of teachers\nwho do not have backgrounds in the relevant disci-\nplines to teach students?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 How does professional development in the area of\ncultural understanding affect the way teachers teach\nchildren from culturally and linguistically diverse\nbackgrounds? What adjustments do teachers make as\na result of this knowledge?\nThe current study used teacher's age and gender, and type\nof school being public or private as the independent vari-\nables. Future studies should further consider teacher's teach-\ning experience, subject taught, and school size and school\nlocation. Related research considered these factors signifi-\ncant in measuring the effectiveness of professional develop-\nment (U.S. Department of Education, 1997).\nAlthough the study describes teacher's perceptions about\nprofessional development, it cannot describe school climate,\nachievement, or teacher knowledge/skills in any more gen-\neral context. The message for ADEC is that to provide pro-\nfessional development which aligns with teachers'\nperceptions of their needs, and procures the investment of\nthe teachers participating, it is important that schools and\nadministrators consider the diverse backgrounds of teachers\nas well as their students, provide inter-related and numerous\nopportunities for interaction among professional colleagues,\nand strive to create a school environment which maximizes\nopportunities for collaboration as well as for learning.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAlade, O., & Odebode, O.
