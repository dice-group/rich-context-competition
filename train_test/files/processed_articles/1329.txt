Grover, Louis Coupal, Hanna Zowall\n Key Words: blood pressure  cardiovascular disease\nOsteoarthritis is highly prevalent in the United States.\nAmong nearly 116 million US adults 35 years of age,\n24 million (21%) have osteoarthritis.1 Nonsteroidal anti-\ninflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly prescribed for\nosteoarthritis. NSAIDs inhibit the cyclooxygenase-1\n(COX-1) and COX-2 enzymes.2 One of the most serious side\neffects of nonspecific NSAIDs is upper gastrointestinal ul-\nceration and bleeding resulting from a reduction in the\nprostaglandins produced by COX-1.\nRecent clinical trials suggest that COX-2\u00adselective\nNSAIDs are associated with a reduced incidence of gastro-\nintestinal bleeding compared with nonselective NSAIDS.3,4\nThis reduced gastric toxicity has been primarily responsible\nfor the growing popularity of these drugs in the United States\nand Canada. With this increased use, other issues surrounding\nCOX-2\u00adspecific inhibitor toxicity are now receiving addi-\ntional attention. For instance, in the VIoxx Gastrointestinal\nOutcome Research (VIGOR) study, whereas rofecoxib was\nassociated with a lower risk of gastrointestinal events com-\npared with naproxen, myocardial infarctions were more\nfrequent with this COX-2\u00adspecific inhibitor.3 Controversy\ncontinues as to whether rofecoxib is associated with an\nincreased risk of myocardial infarction or whether naproxen\noffers protection against cardiovascular disease.5\u00ad10\nIt has been well recognized that nonspecific NSAIDs may\ninterfere with hypertension management. A number of meta-\nanalyses have concluded that this appears to be a class effect,\nwhereby systolic and diastolic pressure are increased among\npreviously controlled patients.11,12 Data surrounding the ef-\nfects of COX-2\u00adspecific inhibitors on hypertension have only\nrecently become available. Among hypertensive patients with\nosteoarthritis, recent head-to-head, double-blind, clinical tri-\nals have evaluated the blood pressure changes associated with\nCOX-2\u00adspecific inhibitors. In the SUCcessive Celecoxib\nEfficacy and Safety Study (SUCCESS) VI, 810 patients were\nrandomized to receive 200 mg of celecoxib or 25 mg of\nrofecoxib once daily. After 6 weeks of treatment, there was a\nsignificant increase in systolic blood pressure (2.6 mm Hg)\nfor rofecoxib compared with 0.5 mm Hg for celecoxib.13\nClinically important hypertension also developed in both\nFrom the Centre for the Analysis of Cost-Effective Care and the Divisions of General Internal Medicine and Clinical Epidemiology, the Montreal\nGeneral Hospital, Departments of Medicine and Epidemiology and Biostatistics, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.\nCorrespondence to Dr Steven A.

A similar result was observed in a second but larger\nstudy, SUCCESS VII.14\nThe prevalence of osteoarthritis increases with age, as does\nthe risk of cardiovascular disease. The prevalence of high\nblood pressure also increases with age. Accordingly, a sub-\nstantial number of patients with osteoarthritis are likely to be\nreceiving concurrent therapy for hypertension. We used the\nCardiovascular Life Expectancy Model,14 a validated Markov\nmodel, and data from the Third National Health And Nutri-\ntion Examination Survey (NHANES III)15 to estimate the\nimpact of small changes in blood pressure. These analyses\nfocus on American adults with osteoarthritis and hyperten-\nsion, treated and untreated, to estimate the potential clinical\nand economic impact of blood pressure destabilization after\nCOX-2\u00adspecific inhibitor prescription.\nMethods\nUsing blood pressure data provided by the SUCCESS VI study, we\nestimated the impact of blood pressure destabilization among hyper-\ntensive patients receiving COX-2\u00adspecific inhibitor therapy for the\ntreatment of osteoarthritis.13 The impact of blood pressure changes\non cardiovascular risk was modeled using the Cardiovascular Life\nExpectancy Model.14 This validated Markov model was used to\nestimate the increased risk of coronary events, cerebrovascular\nevents, and premature mortality after blood pressure changes. The\nincremental risk observed in the SUCCESS VI study was then\nextrapolated to the American adults diagnosed with osteoarthritis and\nreceiving treatment for hypertension. These analyses were based on\nthe distribution of risk factors among adults in the NHANES III\nsurvey.15 Finally, we also estimated the impact of blood pressure\ndestabilization on adults with osteoarthritis and untreated hypertension.\nBlood Pressure Changes Observed in\nSUCCESS VI was a 6-week randomized parallel group, double-blind\ntrial in patients with osteoarthritis who were 65 years of age and\nwere taking antihypertensive agents.13 Patients received 200 mg of\ncelecoxib or 25 mg rofecoxib once daily. Primary end points\nincluded changes in blood pressure and development of edema.\nApproximately 400 patients were entered into each arm of the\nstudy. Baseline characteristics were balanced between the 2 treat-\nment groups, including an average of 74 years of age, female gender\nin 66% of participants, baseline systolic blood pressure of 137 to\n138 mm Hg, and diastolic blood pressure of 76 mm Hg. During 6\nweeks of therapy, mean systolic blood pressure decreased in the\ncelecoxib-treated patients but increased among those receiving\nrofecoxib. The net difference between the 2 treatment arms increased\nelevated hypertension (prespecified as an increase of 20 mm Hg\nwith an absolute value 140 mm Hg) developed among 66 rofe-\ncoxib patients compared with 45 patients receiving celecoxib\n(P0.03). In summary, systolic blood pressure decreased by 0.36%\namong those receiving celecoxib and rose 1.9% among those\nreceiving rofecoxib. These net changes in blood pressure (2.26%)\nwere used to estimate the associated change in cardiovascular risk.\nEstimating Cardiovascular Events and\nLife Expectancy\nThe Cardiovascular Disease Life Expectancy Model was used to\nestimate the impact of the differential blood pressure effect of cele-\ncoxib versus rofecoxib.15 This Markov model estimates the annual\nprobability of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events on the basis of\nmultivariate logistic regression models developed using the Lipid\nResearch Clinics Prevalence Study.16 Independent risk factors in-\nclude age, gender, blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholester-\nol, mean arterial pressure, the presence of cigarette smoking,\ndiabetes, and diagnosed cardiovascular disease at baseline. The\nclinical criteria for cardiovascular events and the odds ratios (ORs)\nfor the independent risk factors have been reported previously.15\nA cohort of patients is entered into the model with specified levels\nof risk factors. Each year, subjects can die of coronary heart disease\nor of cerebrovascular disease or other noncardiovascular causes.\nSurviving subjects age 1 year and re-enter the model for the\nfollowing year. Mean life expectancy can be calculated by summing\nacross the total person years of life experienced by the cohort and\ndividing by the subjects at risk at entry into the model. The model\nhas been described in detail previously and shown to reasonably\nestimate events in 9 clinical trials of dyslipidemia or hypertension.15\nEstimating Risk of Cardiovascular Events Among\nAmerican Adults\nThe Third National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES III) was\nused to provide a representative sample of Americans with osteoar-\nthritis and hypertension (treated or untreated).17 This study was\nCigarette smokers included self-reported current smokers who had\nsmoked 100 cigarettes in their lifetime or subjects with serum\ncotinine levels 13 mg/mL. The presence of cardiovascular disease\nwas defined as a subject's self-report of a previous physician\ndiagnosis of heart attack, stroke, congestive heart failure, or symp-\ntoms consistent with angina (Rose questionnaire) or intermittent\nclaudication. Presence of diabetes was based on a patient's self-\nreport of previous physician diagnosis of diabetes or the American\nDiabetes Association criteria of a fasting plasma glucose 126\nSpecific weights were assigned to each sampled subject to\nestimate the total number of Americans represented by that subject\nafter adjustment for selection probabilities and nonresponse.\nPrimary Analyses\nUsing NHANES III data, the presence of osteoarthritis among adults\n50 years of age was based on a positive response to the question:\n\"Has a physician ever told you that you had arthritis?\" They were\nthen asked whether it was osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. We\nexcluded all patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Individuals were\nclassified as having treated hypertension if they had been told by\ntheir physician that they had hypertension and were taking prescribed\nmedication for it. Untreated hypertension was defined as a measured\nsystolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure\n90 mm Hg among individuals who were not taking prescribed\nmedication.\nThe Cardiovascular Disease Life Expectancy Model was then used\nto estimate the impact of a 2.26% net increase in systolic blood\npressure on the lifetime risk of cardiovascular events. Initially, the\nanalysis focused only on individuals with treated hypertension. The\nanalysis was then repeated for individuals with untreated\nhypertension.\nInitially, we calculated the fatal strokes and coronary events\n(undiscounted) that would be avoided if blood pressure is not\ndestabilized. We then calculated the person years of life saved\nbecause of premature mortality associated with an increased risk of\ncardiovascular disease. Finally, we calculated the direct health care\ncost savings associated with preventing cardiovascular disease.\nPerson years of life saved and cost savings were discounted 3%\nannually.\nEstimating Direct Health Care Costs of\nCardiovascular Disease\nThe economic perspective adopted in the present analysis is that of\na third-party payer providing comprehensive coverage of all health\ncare services. Cardiovascular disease treatment costs included the\ncosts of hospitalizations, physician fees, outpatient care, and emer-\ngency services where applicable. Physician fees, outpatient care,\nGrover et al Hypertension and COX-2 Inhibitors 93\nemergency services, and drug prescriptions also included in the\nmodel have been reported previously in detail.18\nAmerican health care costs were derived from published reports.\nHospital costs were based on the National Medicare Provider\nAnalysis and Review data and the National Sample of the Health\nCare Costs and Utilization Project.19,20 Laboratory tests and physi-\ncian fees were based on the Medicare Resource-Based Relative\nValue Scale.21 Annual medication costs were derived from the 1998\nDrug Topics Red Book.22\nRole of the Study Sponsor\nThis investigator-initiated study was supported by a grant-in-aid\nfrom Pfizer Canada, Inc, which manufactures celecoxib. The sponsor\nof the study had no role in data analysis, data interpretation, or\nwriting of the report. Before submission, the study sponsor made\nnonbinding suggestions to the study authors.\nResults\nUsing survey data from NHANES III, 26 million individ-\nuals were estimated to have physician-diagnosed osteoarthri-\ntis. The prevalence of osteoarthritis grew with increasing age\nfor men and women. The use of antihypertensive medications\nalso grew with increasing age. A total of 440 adults 50\nyears of age reported a diagnosis of osteoarthritis and were\ntaking antihypertensive medication. This represents a popu-\nlation of 7.3 million American adults. The prevalence of\ncardiovascular disease and associated cardiovascular risk\nfactors are summarized in Table 1. The average age of this\npopulation was 69 and 28% were male. Coronary heart\ndisease had been diagnosed previously in 26% of respon-\ndents, and 11% had experienced a cerebrovascular accident.\nCongestive heart failure was also present in 12% of respon-\ndents, and diabetes was reported in 28%. Blood pressure\naveraged 144/76 mm Hg among those who were receiving\ntreatment for hypertension.\nCompared with the baseline characteristics of patients\nenrolled in the SUCCESS VI study, the NHANES III popu-\nlation appears to be at somewhat higher risk of future\ncardiovascular events. In SUCCESS VI, the mean age was\n74, and 33.5% of participants were male. Coronary artery\ndisease was diagnosed in 18% of participants and conges-\ntive heart failure in 5%. Baseline blood pressure was also\nlower than in the NHANES III population, averaging 138/\n76 mm Hg. These data reflect the study exclusion criteria\nwhereby patients had to have a diastolic blood pressure of\n95 mm Hg and a systolic blood pressure of 160 mm Hg to\nenter the study. Those with New York Heart Association\nClass III or IV heart failure were also excluded. Presence of\ncigarette smoking, diabetes, and blood lipid levels were not\nreported.\nIn SUCCESS VI, rofecoxib was associated with a 2.26%\nnet increase in systolic blood pressure compared with cele-\ncoxib. We therefore estimated the cardiovascular events that\ncould be avoided if this increase in systolic blood pressure did\nnot occur (Table 2). Among American men and women 50\ndeaths would be avoided among 7.3 million individuals with\nosteoarthritis who are also taking antihypertensive medica-\ntion. The majority of these events would be prevented in\nwomen among whom osteoarthritis and hypertension are\nmore than twice as prevalent compared with men. After\ndiscounting future events 3% annually, this would translate\ndirect health care costs associated with treating cardiovascu-\nlar disease are also considered, the cost savings of maintain-\ning blood pressure control exceed $1.43 billion, including\n$227 million among men and $1.2 billion among women.\nThe potential benefits of not raising systolic blood pressure\nwere also considered for 3.8 million Americans with osteo-\narthritis who are not taking antihypertensives but had a blood\npressure of 140/90 mm Hg. The baseline characteristics of\nthis population are also summarized in Table 1. Compared\nTABLE 1.

Among these untreated hypertensive adults,\nsaved would be associated with better blood pressure control\nas well as $945 million in direct health care cost savings\n(Table 5).\nOverall, the potential benefits of maintaining blood pres-\nstroke deaths and 39 000 coronary deaths prevented,\ndirect health care cost savings.\nDiscussion\nThese analyses suggest that a small but significant net\nincrease in the average systolic blood pressure among indi-\nviduals receiving COX-2\u00adspecific inhibitors could translate\ninto a substantial increase in cardiovascular risk and prema-\nture mortality. Direct health care costs associated with treat-\ning cardiovascular disease would also increase. One must\nacknowledge these results are based on estimates derived\nfrom the Markov model simulation and not a large head-to-\nhead clinical trial. Nonetheless, there is a substantial body of\nevidence to support the conclusion that small changes in\nblood pressure among individuals with osteoarthritis and\nhypertension will prove to be clinically important and costly\nas well.\nThe benefits of treating systolic hypertension have been\nconfirmed in such studies as the Systolic Hypertension in the\nElderly Program (SHEP).23 During 4.5 years of follow-up,\nactive treatment was associated with a 12-mm drop in systolic\nblood pressure and a 4-mm drop in diastolic blood pressure.\nFor individuals 60 years of age, this resulted in a significant\n36% reduction in stroke and 27% reduction in clinical\nnonfatal myocardial infarction plus coronary death. However,\none must recognize that the blood pressure changes observed\nin SHEP were 4-fold greater than those observed in the\nIn the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE)\nstudy, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ramipril)\nwas compared with placebo among patients who were at high\nrisk for a cardiovascular event.24 Approximately 50% of the\npatients had documented hypertension, and the average blood\npressure at entry into the study was 139/79 (nearly identical\nto the baseline blood pressure of SUCCESS VI patients). At\nthe end of the study, systolic blood pressure among the\nramipril-treated group was 3 mm Hg lower than the placebo\ngroup. In spite of this small change in blood pressure,\nramipril significantly reduced the rates of death, myocardial\ninfarction, and stroke by 20% to 32%. The HOPE investiga-\ntors have used epidemiological data to suggest that the blood\npressure benefits observed with treatment could not fully\naccount for the entire observed reduction in stroke or myo-\ncardial infarction.25 However, recent re-analyses of blood\npressure data from the Framingham Heart Study suggest that\nthe benefits of reducing blood pressure may have been\nunderestimated previously in observational studies.26\nIn the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering treatment to\nprevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), the doxazosin arm of\nthe study was terminated prematurely after 3.3 years of\nfollow-up because of a significantly increased risk of stroke,\ncombined cardiovascular events, and congestive heart failure\nTABLE 3.

The recently\npublished final report of ALLHAT also demonstrated that the\nangiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril versus the\ndiuretic chlorthalidone was associated with a higher com-\nbined rate of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and heart fail-\nure.28 Once again, chlorthalidone was associated with a\ngreater reduction in systolic pressure of 2- to 3-mm difference\nin systolic blood pressure in favor of chlorthalidone.\nThe results presented herein are also consistent with an\nearlier analysis by Cook et al in which the impact of a 2-mm\nreduction in diastolic blood pressure was estimated to result\nin a 6% reduction in coronary heart disease events and a 15%\nreduction in stroke.29 This analysis was based on Framingham\nHeart Study data and population survey data from the\nNHANES II. A 2-mm reduction in diastolic blood pressure\napproximates a 4-mm drop in systolic blood pressure based\non an overview analysis of 14 randomized trials of antihy-\npertensive drugs published by Collins et al.25\nIn the absence of long-term clinical trial data, the estimates\npresented in these analyses have been necessarily conserva-\ntive. Only adults 50 years of age are included in these\nanalyses. NHANES III participants representing 1 million\nadults were also excluded from the analyses because of\nmissing data on cardiovascular risk factors. We also recog-\nnize that the diagnosis of osteoarthritis used in NHANES III\nwas based only on patient self-report. However, this data set\nprovided the complete assessment of cardiovascular risk\nfactors necessary for our analyses. Nonetheless, one would\nexpect that the absolute prevalence of osteoarthritis presented\nherein may be somewhat inflated. It should be recognized that\nin SUCCESS VI, clinically important blood pressure in-\ncreases were observed despite the fact that a patient's\nantihypertensive medication could be titrated upward as\nrequired by the treating physician.13 Blood pressure changes\nwere also more likely to be noticed in this clinical trial setting\nin which blood pressure was a primary outcome and mea-\nsured 3 over 6 weeks. Recent analyses of the NHANES III\ndata demonstrate that the diagnosis and treatment of hyper-\ntension on a national basis is probably less optimal. It is\nestimated that 31% of Americans were unaware that they had\nhypertension, and only 23% were taking medications that\ncontrol their hypertension adequately.30,31 Accordingly, it is\nreasonable to expect that blood pressure destabilization is\nmore likely to go unnoticed in routine clinical practice than\nthat observed in the SUCCESS VI study. Finally, although\nthese analyses focused only on COX-2 inhibitors, blood\npressure destabilization has also been observed with many\nSUCCESS VI was not large enough or long enough in\nduration to demonstrate a significant difference in coronary\nevents or stroke. Nonetheless, the significant increase in\nperipheral edema among rofecoxib-treated patients (9.5%)\ncases of congestive heart failure all among the rofecoxib\ngroup (P0.058) support the conclusion that small average\nchanges in blood pressure among a patient cohort are not\nbenign because they may represent large changes among a\nfew susceptible patients.13 Whereas a 3-mm increase is the\naverage change observed in the study, 17% of patients were\nsignificantly (P0.05) more likely to have a clinically\nimportant increase of 20 mm in their blood pressure in the\nrofecoxib group compared with 11% in the celecoxib group.\nIt appears that neither treatment is without any risk\nwhatsoever.\nAdditional data from a similar but larger study (SUCCESS\nVII) confirms an increased risk of edema and an increase in\nsystolic blood pressure among patients receiving rofecoxib\nversus celecoxib.14 In SUCCESS VII, additional analyses\nalso suggest that calcium channel blockers or diuretic model\ntherapy may protect against the blood pressure increases\nnoted with rofecoxib, suggesting that hypertension is avoid-\nable with appropriate detection and treatment.\nThe results of the 2 large COX-2\u00adspecific inhibitor gastric\ntoxicity trials and 2 observational studies also support the\nconclusion that rofecoxib may increase the risk of coronary\nevents. Cardiovascular outcomes were measured in 2 large,\nrecently published long-term studies. In the VIGOR trial,\nmyocardial infarction was observed in 0.4% of the rofecoxib-\ntreated patients versus 0.1% of the naproxen-treated patients\nA similar comparison between 400 mg of celecoxib twice\ndiclofenac twice daily demonstrated no significant increase in\ncardiovascular events in the celecoxib group (0.9) versus the\ncombined NSAID group (1.0).4 In a large cohort study\nconducted by Ray et al, the users of high doses of rofecoxib\n(25 mg) were found to be at increased risk of experiencing\nserious coronary heart disease compared with nonusers (in-\nAnother large cohort study by Mamdani et al found hospital-\nizations for congestive heart failure were more frequent in\nrofecoxib users relative to controls not exposed to NSAIDs\ncelecoxib users had a risk of congestive heart failure compa-\nrable to that of the NSAID\u00adnai\n\u00a8ve controls (adjusted rate ratio,\nrisk associated with rofecoxib versus celecoxib (adjusted rate\nMedicare beneficiaries by Solomon et al compared the\ncardiovascular safety of COX-2\u00adspecific inhibitors to un-\ntreated controls or those receiving nonspecific NSAIDs. In 1\nanalysis, rofecoxib use was associated with a significantly\nincreased risk of new onset hypertension relative to NSAIDs\n(OR, 1.4), celecoxib (OR, 1.6), or not taking any NSAID\n(OR, 1.6).33 In a second analysis of the same data set,\nrofecoxib was also associated with an increased risk of acute\nmyocardial infarction compared with celecoxib (OR, 1.24)\nand with not taking NSAIDs.34 Case-control studies cannot be\nused to prove causality, but these results and the others\npresented herein do suggest that rofecoxib is associated with\nblood pressure destabilization, which may result in increased\ncardiovascular complications.35\nPerspectives\nHypertension and osteoarthritis are common conditions\namong middle-aged and elderly Americans. The prescription\nof COX-2\u00adspecific inhibitors is likely to increase given the\nconcerns regarding NSAID-associated gastrointestinal toxic-\nity. Increases in systolic blood pressure have been observed\namong hypertensive patients receiving NSAIDs and COX-2\u00ad\nspecific inhibitors, and clinically important hypertension may\nalso occur. These changes may represent clinically important\nevents among specific patients. They should not be ignored\nbecause they could result in a substantial increase in cardio-\nvascular events and associated premature mortality. The\nestimated health care costs associated with treating these\ncardiovascular events appear to be substantial. Individuals\nwith hypertension who are also treated with an NSAID are at\nincreased risk of blood pressure destabilization. This may\nlead to an increased risk of cardiovascular events.\nReferences\n1. Singh G, Miller JD, Lee FH, Pettitt D, Russell MW.
