FRT\nrefers to the retail investors' willingness to accept the\nnegative changes in the value of investment or an\noutcome that is adversely different from the expected\nUnderstanding and assessing FRT plays a crucial role in\nindividualchoicesaboutwealthaccumulation,portfolio\nallocation, and all other investment and finance-related\ndecisions (Hanna, Gutter, & Fan, 2001) and in achieving\nfinancial goals. An advisor has to accurately assess FRT\nfor achieving his/her goal or the investor's goal. This is\npossible only if the advisor personally knows the client,\nfor example, high-net-worth individual (HNWI) inves-\ntors, but it is challenging for them while considering\nmass markets of small investors (Ardehali, Paradi, &\nAsmild, 2005). Nevertheless, it is important to measure\nFRT at best. Failure to do so leads to the choice of an\ninvestment option/portfolio which is inconsistent with\none's FRT resulting in investor disappointment, that\nis, unbearable loss to the client (Droms, 1987). Such a\nsituation may adversely affect the client\u00adadvisor rela-\ntionship (Larkin et al., 2013). In addition, it leads to\nan unfavourable impact on the advisor's career and\nexposes him to litigation, arbitration, and legal jeop-\nardy (Grable, Roszkowski, Joo, O'Neill, & Lytton,\n2009). This problem could be minimized by an investor\nhimself/herself measuring his/her FRT instead of FRT\nbeing measured by others (i.e., advisors) as there is a\nstrong relationship between investment behaviour of an\nindividual and his/her FRT (Bailey & Kinerson, 2005;\nUnderstanding the significance of measuring FRT\ncorrectly, financial advisors have been giving impor-\ntance to the behavioural aspects of an investor while\nmeasuring FRT. Measuring FRT is challenging as it is\na multidimensional attitude. Besides, it is an elusive\nconcept that appears to be influenced by a number of\npredisposing factors (Trone, Allbright, & Taylor, 1996)\nsuch as demographic, environmental, and psychoso-\ncial factors. The extant literature shows that among all\nthe factors, demographic characteristics are the most\nwidely investigated determinants of FRT (e.g., Grable\nHanna, 1998). In addition, demographic characteristics\ncould be used to differentiate retail investors in terms\nof FRT and classify them into different FRT categories\n(Grable & Lytton, 1999). Nevertheless, there are several\nother variables that may also be important determinants\nof FRT, for example, personality (a psychological factor)\nand genetics (a biological factor) of an individual.\nDespite the importance of FRT in financial and invest-\nment decision-making, specific theory related to the\nassessment and prediction of FRT is very limited (Hanna,\nGutter, & Fan, 1998), but theories related to non-finan-\ncial decisions (i.e., use of drug and alcohol) widely exist.\nFor example, risk attitudes and behaviours of an adoles-\ncent on the basis of predisposing factors were inves-\ntigated by Irwin Jr (1993). He classified these factors\ninto two categories, namely environmental factors and\nbiopsychosocial factors. Environmental factors included\nfamily situation, socioeconomic status, and social tran-\nsitions. Biopsychosocial factors included birth order,\ngender, personality traits, age, and ethnicity. As stated\nabove, the relationship between biopsychosocial factors\nand FRT is a relatively unexplored area as compared to\ndemographic factors. One such important study was\nconducted by Grable and Joo (2004). They adapted and\nexpanded Irwin's framework and tested it using predis-\nposing factors as determinants of FRT of faculty and staff\nof two universities. They found a significant association\nbetween biopsychosocial factors and FRT. With respect\nto psychological factors, extant literature shows that\nMayfield, Perdue, & Wooten, 2008), sensation seeking\n2004) have a consistent positive relationship with FRT.\nAs FRT is dynamic in nature, it changes over time. In\naddition, FRT is influenced by life experiences (Van de\nVenter, 2006). In the recent past, experiences of retail\ninvestors were severely affected by various financial\ncrises. For instance, the recent Greek crisis followed by\nglobal meltdown has increased the financial vulnera-\nbility of institutions as well as individuals. Individuals\nrather than institutions have mostly experienced the\nadverse impact of financial vulnerability by losing their\ninvestments and jobs and facing salary cuts (Bricker,\nBucks, Kennickell, Mach, & Moore, 2011). Such scenario\nchanges may or may not pull down the risk appetite\nof the financial advisors and investors. This empha-\nsizes the need for continuous assessment and accurate\nmeasurement of FRT to achieve the desired results (Yao,\nThere is no specific theory on the role of biopsychoso-\ncial factors in the financial services domain. This study\naims to identify the factors that are related to risk toler-\nance from outside the financial services domain such\nas psychology, economics, and bio-sociology. It deals\nmost specifically with the relationship between biopsy-\nchosocial factors and FRT. This study is expected to add\nvalue to the existing literature in a meaningful way.\nMoreover, those who are interested in assessing and\npredicting FRT can move closer to a theoretical account\nthat blends psychological and economic insights and\nsupplements the understanding of risk-taking atti-\ntudes and behaviour of retail investors. Such an under-\nstanding will help financial advisors, policy makers,\nand researchers in identifying the determinants of an\nindividual's FRT to suggest the suitable investment\nalternatives to their clients.\nOver the past three decades, capital market in India\nhas undergone various structural changes. A wide\nvariety of investment options has been thrown open\nto the investors' community. With the proliferation of\ninvestment options, the retail investors' community\nhas grown significantly in the recent years. The retail\ninvestors may choose from a number of investment\noptions according to the level of FRT. Since then, finan-\ncial advisors, policy makers, and researchers have\nshown their keen interest in identifying the determi-\nnants of an individual's FRT to suggest the suitable\ninvestment alternatives to their clients. A number of\nstudies have investigated the role of demographic\nfactors as a determinant of FRT (Grable & Joo, 1999;\nthere are other determinants such as financial consid-\nerations, that is, the need for financial liquidity and\nincome security and personal considerations (Boone\nspecific theory on the role of biopsychosocial factors in\nthe financial services domain. Therefore, this section\ndiscusses some of the most important factors that are\nrelated to risk tolerance from outside the financial\nservices domain such as psychology, economics, and\nbio-sociology.\n  Self-Esteem and FRT\nSelf-esteem is an important personality trait and\nacknowledged as a multidimensional trait as it encom-\npasses several characteristics such as goodness, skill\nand social competence, health, and worth (Baumeister,\nCampbell, Krueger, & Vohs, 2003; Liao, Hunter, &\nWeinman, 1995). It can be defined as `the perception\nof self-worth, or the extent to which a person values,\nprizes, or appreciates the self' (Blascovich & Tomaka,\n1991). Self-esteem could be either positive or negative\nand represents a favourable or unfavourable attitude\ntowards self (Rosenberg, 1965). An individual, who\npossesses positive self-esteem, tends to take a higher\nrisk than those who have negative self-esteem (Arch,\ninvestment decision will be known only in the future,\ninvestors have necessarily to deal with the uncertainty\nassociated with their investment choice, which leads\nto some level of anxiety, thereby, affecting their level of\nself-esteem (Taylor, 1974). For instance, individuals who\nhave higher self-esteem are likely to be higher achievers\nin all endeavours than those who have lower self-es-\nteem, because their performance should be consistent\nwith their perceived self-image (Korman, 1976).\nSimilarly, the driving force behind individuals' pursuit\nof wealth creation by choosing risky instruments is to\nmaintain their economic status, which is consistent with\ntheir perceived self-worth (Bragues, 2005).\nSelf-esteem affects one's portfolio allocation, wealth\ncreation, and trading behaviour (Chatterjee, Finke, &\nHarness, 2009). Retail investors, who have a higher level\nof self-esteem, are able to cope with anxiety of experi-\nencing losses, willing to invest in risky financial instru-\nments as well as instruments with which they do have\nlittle knowledge, willingness to trade the instruments\nthat have poor performance, and so on (Chatterjee et al.,\n2009). Individuals who have higher self-esteem never\nregret even when they make bad investments, that is,\ninvesting in under-performing investments as it lowers\ntheir self-esteem (Arkes & Blumer, 1985). Similarly,\nthey are unwilling to admit their investment failure,\nthat is, `sell the stock/portfolio that had generated a\nsmall loss than a stock/portfolio that had experienced a\nmore serious loss' (Tykocinski, Israel, & Pittman, 2004).\nWhen considering demographic factors, it is observed\nthat men with a positive self-esteem would trade more\nexcessively than women with a higher self-esteem and\nunder-perform in investments (Barber & Odean, 2001).\nWomen are more pessimistic than men and attempt to\nmitigate the drop in their own self-esteem in the event\nof investment failure (Mansour, Jouini, & Napp, 2006).\nIndividuals with positive self-esteem exhibit their will-\ningness to seek financial knowledge and financial\nadvice (Joo & Grable, 2001). Having financial educa-\ntion/knowledge would help individuals to know their\nfinancial situation and control their financial situation as\ndesired by themselves (Hogarth, Swenson, Gutenson, &\nNichols, 1995). Controlling these demographic factors\nsuch as gender, education, age, income, net worth, and\nfinancial knowledge, several studies have found that\nself-esteem is a significant as well as a positive predictor\n& Joo, 2004;). Therefore, it is expected that:\nH\n: Self-esteem is positively related to FRT.\n  Personality and FRT\nThe internal (psychological) and external environment\naffects an individual's human behaviour (Endler &\nEdwards, 1986) and thereby his decisions. Personality\ntype plays a significant role in determining investor\nbehaviour (Maital, Filer, & Simon, 1986; Sadi, Asl,\nRostami, Gholipour, & Gholipour, 2011). According\nto Myers\u00adBriggs Type Indicator (MBTI) personality\ntheory, every person has inborn preferences that\ndefine how he or she will behave in a certain situation\nthat investment advisors must consider an investor's\npersonality type in client profiling. Further, they can\nuse it for suggesting suitable investment options\n(Pompian & Longo, 2004). For instance, retail investors\ncan be grouped into two groups, viz., passive or active\nto help investment advisers to understand the nature\nof their clients and suggest suitable options (Barnewall,\n1987). Typically, passive investors are those who earn\nmoney without putting a great effort and earn wealth\nby risking the capital of others. Conversely, active\ninvestors like to earn wealth by risking their own\ncapital. In simple words, active investors have more\ntolerance for risk than passive investors (Barnewall,\n1987). Previous studies have investigated the relation-\nship between personality traits and investment deci-\nsions and found a relationship between personality\nand FRT (Barnewall, 1987; Bashir, Azam, Butt, Javed,\nThere are many ways of classifying people's personal-\nities such as the five-way model, MBTI, and Type A/B\ntraits method. In this study, Type A/B traits method\nis used to measure the retail investor's personality.\nType A personality generally refers to the individuals,\nwho are competitive, with an underlying tendency for\nhostility and aggressiveness, a sense of time urgency\n& Low, 1990). Conversely, Type B refers to the individ-\nuals who are a contrast to those with Type A person-\nality. Individuals with Type A personality trait tend\nto take greater risks than those more closely aligned\nwith the Type B personality profile (Carducci & Wong,\n1998). In addition, Type A individuals tend to pursue\ntangible accomplishments as a measure of one's well-\nbeing/worth because the society values only material\nsuccess. In this pursuit, they try to achieve more mate-\nrial success than others (Type B individuals) with less\nconcern for one's perceived personal limits (Price, 1982).\nType A individuals are more financial risk tolerant than\nType B individuals as they are associated with higher\nlevels of income (Thoresen & Low, 1990) and higher\nlevel of education, financial knowledge, and occupa-\ninstance, a higher level of income gives a kind of finan-\ncial security and makes it possible for Type A individ-\nuals to take greater financial risks than Type B individ-\nuals (Carducci & Wong, 1998). Very few studies have\nexamined the relationship between personality and\nFRT by classifying investors into Type A/B category. A\nfew studies have found that Type A individuals tend to\nbe more risk tolerant than Type B individuals (Carducci\nH\n: \nType A investors have more Financial Risk\nTolerance than Type B investors.\n  Sensation Seeking (SS) and\nFRT\nSensation seeking is yet another important trait which is\nconsistently related with FRT (Wong & Carducci, 1991).\nSensation seeking is defined as `the seeking of varied,\nnovel, complex, and intense sensations and experiences,\nand the willingness to take physical risks for the sake of\nsuch experiences' (Zuckerman, 1994). In simple words,\nthis type of behaviour is `due to the biochemical reac-\ntions in the brain' (Larsen & Buss, 2008). Typically, an\nindividual who has higher sensation seeking accepts\nrisk as a possible outcome for attaining the desired level\nof excitement and stimulation (Zuckerman & Kuhlman,\n1978). Such an individual tends to bet high and at higher\nodds in gambling for increasing the level of arousal\n(Anderson&Brown,1984).Thistraitrelatestothebehav-\nioural expressions that are generally described as risky\nsuch as high-risk sports, gambling, substance usage,\nrisky sexual experiences, alcohol use, holiday prefer-\nIndividuals with such a trait also exhibit a propensity\nto make risky financial investments (Harlow & Brown,\n1990). A few studies have investigated the relationship\nof sensation seeking with financial management behav-\niour, especially the use of credit card in particular (e.g.,\nKennison, & Bradley, 2011; Worthy, Jonkman, & Blinn-\nPike, 2010). They found that students exhibited risky\nfinancial behaviour such as accumulating more debt,\noverdrawing their accounts, borrowing money from\ntheir friends to pay their bills and so on. Nevertheless,\na very limited number of studies explored the relation-\nship between sensation seeking and FRT. Carducci and\nWong (1991) concluded that higher sensation seekers\nwould exhibit greater financial risk-taking tenden-\ncies. Further, they stated that men engaged in financial\nrisk-taking more than women. In the similar line, the\ngeneral trait of sensation seeking has some predictive\nvalue for financial risk behaviour (Grable & Joo, 2004;\nHorvath & Zuckerman, 1993). Therefore, it is expected\nthat:\nH\n: Sensation Seeking is positively related to FRT.\nThis article has conceptualized the research model with\nthe help of extant literature (Figure 1). The proposed\nrelationships were examined using Partial Least\nSquare-Path Modelling (PLS-PM).\nMethodology\nProcedure and Sample\nTounderstandtherelationshipbetweenbiopsychosocial\nfactors and FRT, the study used single cross-sectional\nsurvey research. The data were collected through\nstructured questionnaire (see Appendix) in Raipur,\nthe capital city of Chhattisgarh, India. A total of\n985 responses were collected by using a purposive\nsampling method from retail investors, who had\nexperience in investing in the capital market. To ensure\nthe appropriateness and validity of the scales, the\nresearchers conducted a pilot study. In addition, the\nresearchers had a discussion with financial advisors\nbefore conducting the final survey. Since the survey\ninstrumentwasinEnglish,theresearchershadrequested\nthe respondents to seek clarification from them if they\ndid not understand any part of the questionnaire. Even\nthough the majority of the respondents were able to\nread and understand English, some respondents sought\nclarifications and the same had been clarified by the\nresearchers for enhancing the quality of responses. In\norder to minimize the limitations of sampling method,\nthe study employed a large sample size. Out of 985\nresponses, 34 responses were incomplete and hence\nwere discarded. Finally, the study used 951 responses\nto achieve the objective of the study. The average age\nand income of the respondents were 35.19 years and\n674 respondents were male and the rest were female;\n61.30 per cent of the respondents were single and\n38.70 per cent were married. With regard to education,\n206 respondents were professionals (MBA, CA, etc.)\nand 745 were non-professionals (B.Sc, B.Com, M.Sc,\nM.Com, etc.); 67.50 per cent of the respondents were\nsalaried individuals. The summary of demographic\ncharacteristics is given in Table 1.\nFigure 1: Proposed Research Model\nSource: Conceptualization by the authors.\nTable 1: Summary of Demographic Characteristics\nVariables Classification Frequency % or Mean\nGender\nMarital Status\nEducation\nOccupation\nSource: Calculations by the authors.\nMeasurement\nDependent Variable\nAssessment of the client's risk preferences has now\nbecome an essential step in developing investment\npolicy statement (IPS). It has also become essential\nto document the same prior to making an invest-\nment and subsequent financial planning recommen-\ndations to the clients. Despite the importance of FRT\nin making optimal financial decisions (Moreschi,\n2004), the regulators of the financial market have not\nyet defined the term explicitly (Roszkowski, Davey,\n& Grable, 2005), and hence, FRT has been measured\nin diverse ways in practice (Van de Venter, 2006). For\ninstance, some financial advisors measure FRT using\nproxies--either demographic characteristics or qual-\nitative heuristics or combination of the both. Others\nuse psychometrically designed FRT scales (Grable\net al., 2009). Anecdotal evidence suggests that using\nthe psychometric scale would exhibit FRT relatively\nbetter than the demographic factors. In addition,\nfinancial advisers are warned about the potential\ndangers of using single items of any sort (Callan &\nJohnson, 2002). Therefore, it was suggested that\nassessing FRT using multi-items as well as psycho-\nmetrically designed scale with an appropriate level\nof reliability and validity would be better (Callan &\nal., 2005;). This study preferred to use such a scale for\nmeasuring FRT. Measuring one's FRT could be done\nby advisors or oneself. However, it was suggested that\nindividuals could best measure their FRT more accu-\nrately than the advisors (Hallahan, Faff, & McKenzie,\n2004). In addition, investment behaviour of an indi-\nvidual reflects the level of one's FRT which is meas-\nured by him/her, that is, self-assessment (Bailey &\nthis study used a self-type measurement of FRT using\nfive items on a 4-point scale that was developed by the\nresearchers based on four risk assessment concepts as\nsuggested by Maccrimmon and Wehrung (1986) and\ntested by Grable and Joo (2004). Responses are coded\nas 1, 2, 3, and 4 for strongly agree, tend to agree, tend\nto disagree, and strongly disagree respectively. Higher\nscores indicate higher FRT and vice versa.\nIndependent Variables\nThere are three variables namely sensation seeking,\npersonality type (A/B), and self-esteem. All the three\nvariables were measured on a 4-point scale as is the\ncase with FRT. The self-esteem scale was developed by\npositive self-esteem and vice versa. Type A/B person-\nality scale was developed by Grable and Joo (2004) with\nsix items. However, they were adapted and modified\nfrom Eaker and Castelli (1988). A higher score indicated\na greater likelihood of exhibiting type `A' personality\ntraits. Sensation seeking was measured using five items\nthat were developed by Grable and Joo (2004). However,\nthey were adapted from Arnett (1994) as is with type\n`A' personality. The reliability score of these variables\nis above 0.718, which is above the minimum threshold\nlevel for a variable (Nunnally, 1978). Therefore, all the\nconstructs have good reliability (see Table 2). Similarly,\nall the variables have convergent validity, which was\nverified by calculating Average Variance Extracted\n(AVE) value. Generally, constructs which have AVE\nenough to 0.50 are considered to have a good conver-\nTable 2: Quality Review of the Latent Variables\nVariable Alpha Composite Reliability AVE\nFinancial Risk\nTolerance (FRT)\nType A/B\npersonality (PT)\nSensation Seeking\n(SS)\nSource: Calculations by the authors.\nThe discriminant validity was tested by examining\nthe square root of the AVE that exceeds the inter-cor-\nrelation of the construct with the other constructs or\nsquared correlation between the constructs which\nshould be less than the AVE (Fornell & Larcker, 1981;\nHair & Black, 2006). All the constructs have good discri-\nminant validity (Table 3). Therefore, the measurement\nmodel was considered satisfactory with the evidence of\nadequate reliability and validity of constructs.\nTable 3: Latent Variable Correlations\nSource: Calculations by the authors.\nTools\nThe study used Partial Least Squares (PLS) approach\nto structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) to examine\nthe relationship of biopsychosocial factors with FRT\nusing Smart PLS Software. In addition, the study esti-\nmated the Global Fit measures for path modelling to\nvalidate the model globally.\nRESULTS\nDescriptive Statistics\nDescriptive statistics is shown in Tables 4\u00ad7. The\naverage summated score of FRT is 11.44, with a Standard\nDeviation (SD) of 2.57. The score indicates the level of\nFRT. Higher scores indicate higher FRT (Table 4)\nTable 4: Descriptive Statistics of Financial Risk Tolerance\nItem Mean SD\nI am more comfortable putting my money in a\nbank account than in the stock market\nWhen I think of the word `risk' the term `loss'\ncomes to mind immediately\nIn terms of investing, safety is more important than\nreturns\nSource: Calculations by the authors.\nTable 5 shows the summated score of each item as well\nas the total summated score of self-esteem.

PLS-PM is\na variance-based approach for assessing the interrela-\ntions of all the constructs simultaneously (Chin, 1998).\nIn addition, PLS makes no assumptions on distribu-\ntional requirements. The structural model was evalu-\nated using the R-square for the dependent constructs\nand the size, t-statistics, and significance for the path\ncoefficients. Path coefficients in PLS are standardized\nregression coefficients (Staples, Hulland, & Higgins,\n1998). In order to assess whether path coefficients are\nstatistically significant or not, bootstrap procedures are\nused to estimate standard errors for calculating t-values\n(Fornell & Barclay, 1983). The results are examined at 5\nper cent significance level and the t-statistic value at the\n0.05 level is 1.96. If the t-statistic value is greater than\n1983). Results from PLS-PM are given in Table 8 and\nFigure 2. Three variables namely self-esteem, personality\ntype, and sensation seeking are positively related with\nFRT. In addition, these relationships are statistically signif-\nicant at 5 per cent level.\nAnalysis of Global Fit Measures\nThe study also conducted Global Fit (GoF) measure for\npath modelling (Tenenhaus, Vinzi, Chatelin, & Lauro,\n2005) as it may serve as a cut-off value for global vali-\ndation (Wetzels, Odekerken-Schroder, & Van Oppen,\n2009). GoF is defined as the geometric mean of the\nAVE and average R2. The GoF value of this study is\nthat exceeds the small effect size of R2. This model has\nreasonable explaining power in comparison with the\nbaseline values of explaining power (GoF\nsmall\nmedium\nlarge\nstudy concludes that the model has adequate support\nto validate the PLS model globally (Wetzels et al., 2009).\nDISCUSSION\nSelf-esteem is positively related to FRT and is a signifi-\ncant predictor of FRT. This result is similar to Horvath\nby Lazarus (1991), individuals with higher self-esteem\ndo follow a two-stage assessment process in invest-\nment decision-making. In the first stage, they assess\nthe outcome of the decision which is positive or nega-\ntive. Second, they assess their knowledge in managing\ntheir investments efficiently and effectively. This is\npossible for only individuals with higher self-esteem\nas they have the ability to collect the necessary infor-\nmation and develop an appropriate strategy to achieve\ntheir desired goal. Moreover, this capability gives\na greater confidence in their ability to invest which\nalleviates the fear of a possible loss. If an individual\nperceives the expected benefits to exceed the cost of\ninvestment in terms of time and utility, an individual\nwith higher self-esteem assumes a greater likelihood of\nTable 8: Bootstrap Summary of Research Model and Hypotheses Results\nHypothesis Path Path Coefficients Standard Error T-Statistic Results\nPersonality\nFRT\nSelf-esteem\nFRT\nSensation Seeking\nFRT\nSource: Calculations by the authors.\nsuccess over time (Taylor, 1974) and accumulate more\nwealth. It helps maintain their self-image and self-\nworth. Conversely, individuals with lower self-esteem\nprefer to invest in safe and tangible assets, which tend\nto under-perform over a period of time (Chatterjee et\nal., 2009). On the other hand, individuals with a higher\nself-esteem would lose all their wealth through their\nsub-optimal behaviour as they may be over-confident\nof their knowledge and assessment. This adverse result\nwould result in a drop in their self-esteem that follows a\nnegative outcome resulting in the reduction in the level\nof risk-taking (Chatterjee et al., 2009). This emphasizes\nthe need for correct assessment of their self-esteem.\nOtherwise, it would lead to sub-optimal decisions.\nThe financial service industry should note that lack\nof understanding of self-esteem could be an impor-\ntant obstacle to the achievement of long-term financial\nsuccess and for maintaining the client relationship.\nPersonality type is another significant predictor of FRT.\nThe results are similar to those of Carducci and Wong\nIndividuals who belong to Personality Type A cate-\ngory are usually competitive in nature and are always\nconcerned about their personal achievement (Ray &\nBozek, 1980). Such individualities not only bring recog-\nnition for the community (Houston & Snyder, 1988), but\nalso mediate willingness of the individuals to take risk\n(Carducci & Wong, 1998). `As financial success is propor-\ntional, to some degree, to financial risk taken, Type A\nindividuals would be more willing to take greater finan-\ncial risks to achieve financial success and the recogni-\ntion such success would bring' (Carducci & Wong,\n1998). In addition, Type A individuals usually have\nhigher income level than Type B individuals (Thoresen\n& Low, 1990), which is another reason for having more\nFRT. However, individuals/advisors need to evaluate\ntheir financial security status carefully because over-\nstating one's position motivates one to choose risky\nfinancial investment options, thereby destroying one's\nwealth. Advisors need to recognize the consciousness of\npersonality in terms of their managing ability in rela-\ntion to financial and investment decisions because it\nis related to the way individuals think and act in the\nenvironment. Mismatching the personality and invest-\nment options would destroy the wealth of one's clients.\nAnother trait dealt in this study is sensation seeking.\nThis study finds that individuals with a higher level of\nsensation seeking tend to take more financial risk. This\nfinding is similar to that of Carducci and Wong (1991)\nFigure 2: Results of Structural Model\nSE\nPA\nFRT\nSS\nSource: Authors' analysis.\nand in contrast to Grable and Joo (2004). Individuals\nwho have a higher sensation seeking exhibit a propen-\nsity to make risky financial investments.\nThus, the results of the study confirm the proposition\nmade by Irwin (1993) with regard to determinants of\nFRT, biopsychosocial factors in particular. As hypothe-\nsized, this study finds that the biopsychosocial factors\nare positively associated with FRT. It indicates that an\ninvestor who has a higher level of sensation seeking\nand self-esteem and has Type A personality tends to be\nmore risk-tolerant.\nSUMMARY\nThe most prudent approach to asset allocation is to\nassess and integrate two types of information, namely,\nthe capital market-related factors and the inves-\ntors' FRT. In real life, the self-perceived FRT might be\ndifferent from the objective measurement of FRT as\nthe objective measurement of FRT varies with age. It is\nplausible that an individual's subjective (psychometric\nmeasurement) FRT does not change with age (Hanna\n& Chen, 1997). In recent years, financial planners have\noften preferred to use psychometric assessment of FRT\nto provide better services to the clients. This motivates\nthe researchers to explore the relationship between\nbiopsychosocial factors and FRT to identify the factors\nthat determine FRT. To achieve this objective, this study\nused three biopsychosocial factors namely self-esteem,\npersonality type, and sensation seeking. Findings of the\nstudy suggest that biopsychosocial factors are related\nto FRT. This study suggests to the practitioners, finan-\ncial planners, and policy makers that consideration of\nthese three factors would enhance the understanding of\nthe client in a better manner rather than relying on only\ndemographic factors. However, use of demographic\nvariables and contextual variables along with biopsy-\nchosocial variables is suggested. It is because a small\nvariation in any factor would be useful in preventing\nthe wrong asset allocation decisions.\nIMPLICATIONS\nIncorrect measurement of FRT may lead to the choice of\nincorrect investment options, which in turn may lead to\nthe diminution in the wealth and welfare of investors\nAs a result one may sell a good investment or invest\nin an incorrect portfolio, which are not good for finan-\ncial service providers. It will affect their credibility and\nreputation and result in loss of customers, and so on.\nA further research could consider other variables such\nas racial background, financial satisfaction, net-worth,\nhome ownership, birth order, age, gender, education,\nmarital status, family relationship, the number of\ndependents, and income along with the biopsychoso-\ncial factors. Future research could also consider finan-\ncial knowledge, financial satisfaction, and income level\nbecause knowledgeable individuals who possess a\nhigher level of income and education have a greater\nFRT as pointed out by Grable & and Joo (2004).\nAPPENDIX\nResearch Questionnaire\n1.
