Interior\nhouse paints containing lead were widely used be-\nfore and during the 1940s.2 The use of lead in paint\nwas greatly curtailed in the 1950s, and lead was\nphase-out, leaded paint is found in the majority of\nresidential buildings built before 1980.3 Other lead\nsources in a child's environment may include dust\nand soil contaminated by vehicle exhaust (lead was\nused as a gasoline additive until 1996), lead intro-\nduced into the home from parents' work exposures\nor hobbies, lead in ceramics used to cook and store\nfood, and lead in some ethnic folk medicines and\ncosmetics.4 Major risk factors for elevated blood lead\nlevels reflect these sources and include residence in\nolder homes, low family income, minority race, and\nresidence in larger urban areas.1,5,6\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n(CDC) periodically updates its recommendations for\ntesting children for lead exposure to reflect the cur-\nrent state of knowledge regarding lead's health ef-\nfects and the prevalence of lead exposure. Before\n1991, CDC recommended that at-risk children be\nscreened and given follow-up attention if their blood\nmended that virtually all children 1 to 5 years of age\nbe screened, and the level of concern was lowered\nto 10 g/dL.4 Most recently, CDC recommended\nthat screening efforts be targeted to high-risk neigh-\nborhoods and children, because the decreasing prev-\nalence of elevated blood lead levels has made\nuniversal screening throughout the United States un-\nnecessary.8 The American Academy of Pediatrics has\nconcurred with these recommendations.9,10\nFrom the *Division of Environmental Hazards and Health Effects, National\nCenter for Environmental Health, Centers for Disease Control and Preven-\ntion, Atlanta, Georgia; Health, Education, and Human Services Division,\nUS General Accounting Office, Atlanta, Georgia (the views expressed in this\narticle are those of the author and not necessarily those of the US General\nAccounting Office); and the \u00a7Center for Urban Epidemiologic Studies, New\nYork Academy of Medicine, New York, New York.\nReprint requests to (R.B.K.)

This analysis was un-\ndertaken to determine the frequency of lead screen-\nscreening was performed in accordance with major\nrisk factors for elevated blood lead levels among a\nnationally representative sample of children 1 to 5\nyears of age.\nMETHODS\nData on children's history of blood lead testing and on their\ncurrent blood lead levels were obtained from the Third National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). The\nNHANES is an ongoing series of national studies of the health and\nnutritional status of the civilian noninstitutionalized population.\nNHANES III was conducted in 2 phases: phase 1 ran from October\nthrough September 1994. A detailed description of the sample\ndesign has been published elsewhere.11 Briefly, sampling was\nbased on a stratified multistage probability cluster design, with\noversampling of blacks, Mexican-Americans, children 2 months to\n5 years of age, and people 60 years of age to increase the\nreliability of estimates for these groups. A household interview\nwas conducted in the home for each survey participant, followed\nby a separately scheduled physical examination at a mobile ex-\namination center. Only data for children 1 to 5 years of age were\nincluded in this analysis.\nDuring the physical examination, ethylenediaminetetraacetic\nacid-anticoagulated whole blood was collected by venipuncture\nfrom examinees 1 year of age. Specimens analyzed for lead\nremained frozen at 20\u00b0C until analyzed. Blood lead levels were\natomic absorption spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk,\nCT), using the method of Miller et al.12 The graphite furnace\natomic absorption spectrophotometer method included deuterium\nor Zeeman background correction and had a limit of detection of\n1.0 g/dL. The blood lead measurements were calibrated using\nstandards prepared from lead nitrate Standard Reference Material\n928 obtained from the National Institute of Standards and Tech-\nnology (Gaithersburg, MD). Blood lead levels were measured in\nduplicate, and the mean of the results was used in this analysis.\nBlood lead levels 10.0 g/dL were considered elevated in ac-\ncordance with CDC guidelines.4\nHemoglobin was measured as part of a complete blood count\non a Coulter S-PLUS JR quantitative, automated hematology an-\nalyzer (Coulter, Inc, Hialeah, FL) by a cyanmethemoglobin assay\nusing fresh blood.13 Hemoglobin was measured in duplicate, with\nthe mean value reported. The S-PLUS JR was calibrated directly\nwith Coulter each morning, using S-CAL calibrators and 5-C\nquality control materials. In this analysis, anemia was defined as\na hemoglobin level below CDC-recommended age-specific cutoff\nOne adult individual from each household responded to the\nhousehold interview. The respondent was the head of household\n(defined as the person owning or renting the home) or the spouse\nof the head of the household for 96% of children 1 to 5 years of age.\nThis individual provided information about the household and\nthe child's health history. History of lead testing was assessed by\nthe question: \"Was [child's name] ever tested for lead poisoning?\"\nThe variables included time of the survey, demographic charac-\nteristics, and factors related to the age and location of the family\nhome, health insurance, and use of medical services, anemia and\ngeneral health status, and characteristics of the child's mother and\nhead of household (Table 1).\nFor the questions regarding health insurance coverage, there\nwere multiple versions of the questionnaire, which differed with\nrespect to the time frame referenced. Approximately one half of\nthe respondents were asked about their Medicaid and private\ninsurance coverage within the previous month, and one half were\nasked about their Medicaid coverage within the previous year and\nabout their current private insurance coverage. Because informa-\ntion about Medicaid coverage within the previous year was miss-\ning for 61% of eligible children 1 to 5 years of age, it was assumed\nfor this analysis that those who had current private insurance but\nwere missing information on Medicaid did not have Medicaid\ncoverage. Information about Medicaid coverage within the previ-\nous month was missing for 1% of eligible children 1 to 5 years of\nage.\nThe relationship between each of these characteristics and the\nlikelihood of an elevated blood lead level, as well as history of\nblood lead testing, was assessed while controlling for the others\nusing multiple logistic regression. Model selection via backward\nelimination was used to identify independent correlates signifi-\ncant at   .05, based on t tests. After the initial model was\ndefined, potential predictor variables that had been eliminated\nduring the model selection procedure were individually tested for\nreintroduction into the model; any variables that achieved statis-\ntical significance on reentry were retained in the models.\nData from phases 1 and 2 of NHANES III are correlated to an\nunquantified degree because of the method used for allocating\nprimary sampling units to each survey phase.15 The assessment of\nsurvey phase as a covariate in the regression models was, there-\nfore, conservative, because the correlation between phases was\nignored (J. Eltinge, personal communication, 1998).\nThe number of children with elevated blood lead levels who\ndid not have a history of blood lead screening was estimated for\nphase 2 of the survey, broken down by selected characteristics\npredictive of blood lead level. These numbers were benchmarked\nto the March 1993 Current Population Survey population estimate\nfor the United States because this date represented the approxi-\nmate midpoint of phase 2 sampling.\nAll statistical analyses were performed using SAS and\nSUDAAN software with appropriate weighting and accounting\nfor the complex sample design of the survey.15\u00ad17\nRESULTS\nAmong individuals selected for study in NHANES\nIII, the household interview response rate was 94%\nfor participants 1 to 2 years of age and 91% for those\n3 to 5 years of age. The physical examination was\ncompleted by 87% of selected participants 1 to 2\nThere were 5787 NHANES III participants between\nTABLE 1.

Among those who were\nnot receiving Medicaid, 49% lived in homes built\nwho had elevated blood lead levels and no previous\nblack, non-Hispanic (Table 4).\nDISCUSSION\nThis analysis indicated that 10% of US children 1\nto 5 years of age had received blood lead testing\nbefore their participation in NHANES III in 1988\u00ad\n1994. Presumably, virtually all of these tests were\nscreens or follow-ups of screens among asymptom-\natic children, because symptomatic lead poisoning is\nrare in the United States. This result is a lower esti-\nmate than that found in a 1994 national survey in\nwhich 24% of parents interviewed reported that their\nchildren had undergone lead screening tests.18 Two\nfactors may have contributed to this discrepancy.\nOne is that screening rates may have risen over the\nscreening recommendations issued by CDC in 1991\nand by the American Academy of Pediatrics in\nrecommendations was greater in later years, because\nthe NHANES III data did not show a significantly\nsible to analyze the NHANES data by year of inter-\nview to assess whether this was the case.\nA second possibility is that the estimates were\naffected by selective nonparticipation in one or both\nsurveys. The response rate for the 1994 telephone\nsurvey was 56%, compared with over 90% for\nNHANES III.15,18 It is possible that parents who\nchose to participate in the 1994 survey were more\nlikely than nonparticipants to have children who\nwere screened for lead or more likely to remember\nprevious blood lead testing of their children.\nBlood lead screening is generally conducted in a\nTABLE 3.

Because blood may be drawn at these visits for\nroutine laboratory analyses and anemia testing as\nwell as for lead testing, parents may not always be\naware that a lead test is being performed. Thus, the\nestimates of testing prevalence found in this study,\nas well as in the 1994 telephone survey, may have\nbeen biased downward. However, a review of Med-\nscreening rate similar to that reported in NHANES\nThe estimated prevalence of elevated blood lead\nlevels may also be slightly inaccurate because blood\nlead data were missing for 21% of NHANES III par-\nticipants 1 to 5 years of age. The primary reason for\nmissing data was parental refusal of the blood\ndraw.15 Data were more likely to be missing for\nchildren living in the Northeast region of the United\nStates and for younger children, both of whom tend\nto have higher blood lead levels, and for phase 1\nrecipients, who were sampled when blood lead lev-\nels were higher. Thus, the prevalence estimate may\nhave been biased downward. However, data were\nalso more likely to be missing for children who were\nsampled in the fall and winter months, for those who\nwere not anemic, and for those who had an annual\nlower in the winter and spring, and both anemia and\nlower income were significantly associated with ele-\nvated blood lead levels on the bivariate analyses.\nThus, the overall direction or degree of any bias is\nunclear.\nCorrelates of an elevated blood lead level in this\nanalysis included being 1 to 2 years of age, being of\nminority race/ethnicity, having a lower income, and\nliving in an older home, all of which are well-known\nrisk factors whose relationships to elevated blood\nlead levels have been demonstrated in previous anal-\nyses of NHANES III data.1,5,6 Living in the Northeast\nwas also shown to be a risk factor in a previous\nNHANES III analysis.5 Season did not predict con-\ntinuously modeled blood lead concentrations in chil-\ndren in another NHANES III analysis but has been\nshown to predict blood lead levels elsewhere.6,20\nNote that because NHANES III physical examina-\ntions were generally conducted in the northern\nUnited States during the warmer months and in the\nsouthern United States during the cooler months, the\nincreased risk associated with residence in the\nNortheast and Midwest regions of the United States\nmight be overestimated if the categorical coding for\nseason incompletely controlled for the NHANES III\nexamination schedule.\nBeing on Medicaid, not having a regular doctor,\nliving in a household whose head has less than a\nhigh school education, and having a history of ane-\nmia were also independent risk factors in this anal-\nysis but were not evaluated in the previous NHANES\nIII studies. Anemia has previously been shown to be\ncorrelated with elevated blood lead levels.21 Being on\nMedicaid is a close correlate of poverty, another\nwell-known risk factor for lead exposure that prob-\nably reflects the condition of the child's home. Heads\nof household with less education may be less aware\nof lead hazards and, therefore, less able to protect\ntheir children, or lower education may be a proxy\nmarker of lower socioeconomic status and poorer\nhousing. Similarly, having a regular doctor may be a\nproxy for higher socioeconomic status or a more\norderly lifestyle in which children are less likely to be\nexposed to lead hazards.\nOf the correlates of blood lead testing, many were\nalso risk factors for elevated blood lead levels in this\nanalysis (being of minority race/ethnicity, living in\nan older home, living in the Northeast or Midwest\nregions of the United States, being on Medicaid,\nhaving a head of household with less than a high\nschool education, and having a history of anemia).\nTABLE 4.

Population numbers were estimated based on the Bureau of the\nCensus March 1993 undercount-adjusted Current Population Survey and rounded to the nearest thousand.\n These numbers do not exactly match those published elsewhere31 because the earlier publication used a slightly different weighting\nscheme for the race/ethnicity variable.\n Sample size was not sufficient to allow separate examination of other race/ethnicity groups.\nOf the remaining correlates of previous blood lead\ntesting in this analysis, having a female head of\nhousehold has been shown to be related to the like-\nlihood of elevated blood lead levels in other stud-\nies.22 Increased residential mobility has also been\nshown to be a risk factor for elevated blood lead\nlevels,23 but in this analysis a greater number of\nmoves was associated with a decreased likelihood of\nbeing screened for lead exposure. Children with par-\nents who spoke a language other than English at\nhome were less likely to have received blood lead\ntesting, perhaps reflecting less access to health care\namong these families.\nIn summary, these findings indicate that children\nwith known risk factors for elevated blood lead lev-\nels were more frequently screened. However, among\nchildren with elevated blood lead levels, only one\nthird had been tested previously. Clearly, many\npractitioners did not heed CDC's 1991 call for uni-\nversal screening. Several surveys of pediatricians\nwere conducted in the early 1990s to determine\nscreening practices. The proportion of respondents\nreporting that they universally screen patients\nranged from 12% to 75%, with higher proportions\nfound in later years.24\u00ad27 The proportion reporting\nthat they never screened patients ranged from 4% to\n25%, and the proportion that screened selected pa-\ntients ranged from 21% to 63%. These studies indi-\ncate that universal screening was more commonly\npracticed by pediatricians with more recent training,\nthose who practiced in academic or public clinic\nsettings, those who had a greater proportion of mi-\nnority or Medicaid patients, those who believed the\nbenefits of screening outweigh the costs, and those\nwho reported a high prevalence of elevated blood\nlead levels among their patients.24\u00ad26 Among selec-\ntive screeners, indicators for screening were gener-\nally in adherence with the 1991 guidelines of the\nCDC and included such factors as living in or regu-\nlarly visiting an older home, having a history of pica,\nbeing enrolled in Medicaid, having a parent who\nuses lead for work or for a hobby, and having a\nChildhood lead poisoning prevention programs\nthat are attempting to devise plans for reaching high-\nrisk children should focus on those risk factors that\ncan identify the greatest numbers of such children\nand can be assessed easily by pediatric practitioners.\nThe candidate risk factors evaluated in terms of ab-\nsolute numbers of high-risk children identified in\nthis analysis were Medicaid status, race/ethnicity,\nand year the home was built. (Region of the country\nwas not evaluated despite being a strong risk factor\nbecause of the possible bias introduced into the esti-\nmate by the survey design.) Among the factors eval-\nuated, Medicaid status identified the greatest num-\nber of high-risk children by far. Although Medicaid-\neligible children represented 30% of the NHANES\nIII, phase 2 sample, they represented 60% of the\nthe level at which children require clinical manage-\nment.8 In addition, since 1992 the Health Care Fi-\nnancing Administration has required that all chil-\ndren receiving Medicaid benefits be tested for lead\nexposure.28 However, among NHANES III, phase 2\nyears of age, 81% did not receive blood lead screen-\ning.29 Nonacceptance of federal screening policies\nand lack of oversight within state Medicaid pro-\ngrams have been identified as 2 reasons why many\nMedicaid-eligible children do not receive screen-\nwith elevated blood lead levels who were not Med-\nThus, focusing on the age of the child's home may be\nmore useful than focusing on the child's race for\nidentifying at-risk children among those who are not\nMedicaid-eligible. Year of housing construction has\nbeen also recommended as a factor on which health\ndepartments should base screening recommenda-\ntions for neighborhoods.8 In addition, physicians can\nask parents about the child's home during individual\nexaminations. Not all parents know when their home\nwas built (8% of respondents in this analysis did not\nknow); the conservative approach for physicians\nwould be to screen all such children.\nThe ideal approach to childhood lead poisoning is\nprimary prevention by removing exposure sources,\nand, in fact, the prevalence of elevated blood lead\nlevels among children 1 to 5 years of age has\nremoval of lead from gasoline, food and drink cans,\nhouse paint, and plumbing.1,6,30 However, remaining\nlead sources, such as deteriorating house paint, must\nbe addressed on an individual, rather than on a\npopulation, level. Therefore, secondary prevention\nthrough screening to identify exposed children, fol-\nlowed by environmental remediation and treatment,\nremains important. Physicians should screen Medi-\ncaid-eligible children and should follow health de-\npartment recommendations about identifying and\nscreening other at-risk children. In areas where no\nhealth department guidelines exist, physicians should\neither screen all children or screen based on known\nrisk factors.\nREFERENCES\n1.
