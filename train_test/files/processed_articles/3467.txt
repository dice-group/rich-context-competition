A growing\nbody of evidence indicates that the prothrombotic state can\nbe induced by the activated renin\u00adangiotensin system, which\nis more pronounced in hypertension.1,2 Antihypertensive\ntreatment and lifestyle modifications, with exercise being an\nintegral component, are the cornerstone treatment for blood\npressure (BP) control and prevention of cardiovascular dis-\nease (CVD) in hypertensive patients.3,4 Beneficial effects of\nphysical activity as well as of antihypertensive medical treat-\nment that blocks the renin\u00adangiotensin\u00adaldosterone system\n(RAAS) seem to be mediated by mechanisms independent of\nBP lowering.

The markers of hypercoagulability, fibrinolytic\nactivity, endothelial and platelet function that were chosen\nas markers of haemostatic system activation represent in\nparallel novel risk factors of atherosclerosis and predictors\nof acute coronary events in the high-risk population.\nMaterials and methods\nmen) with never-treated grade I\u00adII essential hypertension\nattending the out-patient clinic of our department were\nrecruited for the study. Diagnosis of hypertension was\nbased on both repeated office measurements and 24 h\nambulatory BP measurements, according to ESC/ESH\nguidelines.4 Echocardiography was performed in all\npatients at baseline evaluation. No signs of left ventricular\nhypertrophy were recorded.\nPatients with secondary hypertension, congestive heart\nfailure, previous myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy,\nstroke, cardiac valve diseases, history of coronary artery\nby-pass grafting, rhythm other than sinus, renal insuffi-\nciency, overt proteinuria, diabetes mellitus or lung disease\nand patients under medication for non-cardiovascular dis-\neases were excluded from the study. Patients who were not\nphysically able to perform exercise testing as well as those\ninvolved in a structured exercise programme, defined as\nmore than three 30-min workouts per week, were also\nexcluded from the study. None of the hypertensive patients\nwas being treated with a statin or cardioactive medication\nand none of the female patients was on hormone replace-\nment treatment. Informed consent was obtained from all\nparticipants in the study while the protocol was approved\nby the ethical committee of our hospital.\nThe first phase of our protocol (pre-treatment period and\nfirst exercise test) is described in our previous study report.9\nBriefly, in order to exclude coronary artery disease, all\npatients underwent a pre-treatment treadmill maximal exer-\ncise stress test (EST) according to the Bruce protocol. One\nweek later, each patient underwent a submaximal exercise\ntest on a bicycle ergometer and blood samples were drawn\npre-exercise, at peak exercise and 1 h post-exercise. The\nsecond phase of our protocol consists of antihypertensive\ntreatment with ramipril \u00b1 hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ)\ncommencing after the first submaximal exercise test.\nPatients were started on ramipril 2.5 mg and changed, if\nAfter a period of one month, patients were re-evaluated and,\nif necessary, either 25 mg HCTZ was added to 5 mg of rami-\nmg ramipril + 25 mg HCTZ. After this adjustment, all\nHCTZ and eight patients on ramipril only). Patients were\nalso advised to stop smoking, reduce salt intake and alcohol\nconsumption, lose weight and start walking at least three\ntimes per week. We revaluated the patients regarding their\nBP control at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after antihypertensive\ntreatment initiation. After approximately 13\u00b12 months of\ntreatment, patients underwent a second submaximal exer-\ncise test. The exercise protocol consisted of 45 min submax-\nimal exercise (65\u00ad70% of maximum predicted heart rate\naccording to the Bruce protocol) followed by 6 min of\nrecovery. BP and heart rate were recorded at baseline, every\n10 min during exercise and every 2 min during the recovery\nphase. Again, blood samples were drawn pre-exercise, at\npeak exercise and 1 h post-exercise.\nBlood samples were drawn by clean venepuncture (20-\ngauge needle) from an antecubital vein under controlled\nvenous stasis: (a) after 30 min rest (pre-exercise), (b) imme-\ndiately after exercise (peak exercise) and (c) one hour after\nexercise (post-exercise). All venipunctures were taken in a\nreclined position. Whole blood was collected in tubes con-\ntaining sodium citrate anticoagulant 3.2% and within 30\nroom temperature.\nProthrombin fragments 1+2 (PF 1+2) and thrombin\u00ad\nantithrombin complex (TAT) served as markers of throm-\nbin generation and D-dimers as markers of fibrin\nformation. Plasmin\u00ada2-antiplasmin complex (PAP) was\nused as an index of fibrinolysis. Endothelial function was\nevaluated by the levels of both von Willebrand factor anti-\ngen (vWf) and soluble thrombomodulin (sTM). Platelet\nfunctional status was assessed by measuring the levels of\nsoluble P-selectin (sPsel). Diurnal variation of haemo-\nstatic variables was avoided since blood samples were\ndrawn for each patient at approximately the same time\nof day.\nThe supernatant plasma was removed, divided into ali-\nquots, snap-frozen at -80\u00b0C and stored until assayed.\nPF1+2 (Enzygnost* PF1+2, Siemens, Germany), TAT\n(Enzygnost\u00ae TAT micro Kit, Siemens, Germany), PAP\n(PAP microElisa, DRG Diagnostics, Germany), sTM\n(Asserachrom\u00ae Thrombomodulin, Diagnostica Stago,\nFrance) and sPsel (Human sP-selectin, Diaclone) were\ndetermined by enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) with\ncommercially available kits. D-Dimers (STA\u00ae-Liatest\u00ae-\nD-Di, Diagnostica Stago, France) and von Willebrand fac-\ntor antigen (vWF Ag\u00ae Reagent, Siemens, Germany) were\ndetermined by immunoturbidimetricity in an STA analyzer.\nThe intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation for\n324 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 14(4)\nStatistical analysis\nAnormality test was performed for all variables. No param-\neter followed a normal distribution during the first exercise\nsession or the second exercise session, vWf levels excluded.\nRepeated measure analysis of variance (repeated\nANOVA) for normally and Friedman non-parametric test\nfor abnormally distributed values were performed in order\nto investigate whether changes of markers studied were sig-\nnificant either between the two sessions (1st and 2nd exer-\ncises) or across all time points in the 2nd exercise session\n(pre-exercise, peak exercise and post-exercise). Results are\nexpressed as means \u00b1 SD and minimum\u00admaximum values\nfor parametric variables and as medians and interquartile\nranges for non-parametric variables. The level of statistical\nsignificance was set at p<0.05. Data were analyzed using\nSPSS version 16.0 for Windows (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, IL).\nResults\nDemographic and clinical characteristics of all patients\nbefore initiation and after approximately one year antihy-\npertensive treatment are shown in Table 1. Body mass index,\nbody surface area and lipid levels did not differ within two\ngroups. All participants completed uneventfully a treadmill\nexercise stress test without evidence of myocardial ischae-\nmia or arrhythmia before the first submaximal exercise on\nthe ergometric bicycle. Both exercise sessions on the\nergometric bicycle were also successfully completed. Levels\nof markers of hypercoagulability, fibrinolysis, endothelial\nfunction and platelet function during the first exercise ses-\nsion are described in our previous study.9 In Figure 1, the\nexercise-induced changes in haemostatic parameters during\nboth submaximal exercise sessions are described.\nChanges in haemostatic parameters\ncompared with baseline\nAfter a period of antihypertensive treatment, significant\nchanges were observed in PAP, vWf and sTM compared to\npre-treatment levels, while PF1+2, TAT, D-dimers and sPsel\nremained unchanged. In particular, there was a marked ele-\nvation of PAP complex while vWf and sTM were mildly\nincreased in treated hypertensive patients (Table 2).\nThrombin generation and fibrin formation\nVariations in TAT were not significantly different between\nthe two exercise sessions. On the contrary, PF1+2 changed\nsignificantly between the two exercise sessions. In the first\nsession, a mild increase in PF1+2 was induced at peak exer-\ncise, which did not remain significantly elevated post-exer-\ncise. Interestingly, in the second session, PF1+2 levels were\nsignificantly decreased post-exercise compared with pre-\nexercise levels. Finally, D-dimer levels varied significantly\nthroughout the first exercise session whereas they remained\nstable during the second session.\nFibrinolysis\nBoth exercise sessions bought about a significant increase\nin PAP complex levels.

Twenty-four newly\ndiagnosed and never treated hypertensive patients partici-\npated in an exercise protocol which was repeated approxi-\nmately one year later while being on antihypertensive\ntreatment with ramipril. Our results showed that blocking\nRAAS for a year may lead to changes in some haemostatic\nvariables at rest and have a favourable impact on the hae-\nmostatic response to exercise.\nOn pre-exercise measurements, no effect of antihyper-\ntensive treatment was revealed on markers of hypercoagu-\nlability. On the contrary, the fibrinolytic capacity was\ngenerally enhanced. Present data on the effect of RAAS\ninhibition on fibrinolysis remain conflicting.10,11 This could\nbe partially attributed to the fact that patients included in\nthese studies are characterized by several phenotypes as\nwell as various level of RAAS activation, which may lead\nto a different response to specific treatments. Moreover,\nmarkers used to evaluate fibrinolysis do not always reflect\nthe endothelial fibrinolytic potential. Indeed, the TRAIN\nstudy failed to show any effect on plasminogen activator\ninhibitor-1 (PAI-1) antigen levels induced by a one-year\ntreatment with fosinopril. However, the study included\npatients with a high cardiovascular risk profile, suffering\nfrom comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus and cancer\nthat are known to decrease fibirinolytic capacity.12\nEvidence on the improvement of endothelial function\nby antihypertensive drugs remains inconclusive.13,14\nFibrinolytic capacity, sTM and vWf, which were evaluated\nin our study, represent three different aspects of endothelial\nfunction that are not regulated by the same metabolic and\nrelease mechanisms.15,16 High vWf levels are an early\nmarker of endothelial dysfunction and correlate with over-\nall cardiovascular risk in hypertensive patients.2 Scientific\ndata concerning the relationship between levels of circulat-\ning sTM and endothelial function are less consistent, how-\never.17,18 While experimental data have shown that the\nrelease of TM parallels the extent of cell damage, clinical\ndata remain conflicting. In the ARIC study, individuals\nwhose sTM levels were in the highest quintile had a signifi-\ncant reduction of cardiovascular risk compared with those\nin the lowest quintile.18 It could be hypothesized that\nTable 2.

It may be also assumed that\nthe level of endothelial dysfunction characterizing our\nhypertensive patients is not sufficient to impair the\nantithrombotic and anticoagulant effects of sTM. However,\nwe measured a further increase of sTM levels after antihy-\npertensive treatment. Whether this increase could be attrib-\nuted to the pleiotropic effects of antihypertensive agents\nremains to be studied. On the other hand, the simultaneous\nincrease of sTM and vWf might reflect hypertensive disease\nprogression and failure of the antihypertensive treatment to\nexert a beneficial effect on these facets of endothelial func-\ntion. It should be noted that evidence regarding the effect of\nantihypertensive treatment on endothelial functional indices\nis scarce while it seems that the effect on vWf and sTM\nlevels is rather neutral.13,19 Nevertheless, our results need to\nbe confirmed in a larger group of hypertensive patients.\nBiomarkers of endothelial function have been associated\nwith subclinical target organ damage (TOD) due to hyper-\ntension, representing either endothelial dysfunction (bra-\nchial artery flow-mediated dilation) or increased arterial\nstiffness (pulse wave velocity).20 In a recent study, which\nincluded 46 never-treated hypertensive patients, vWF and\nsTM levels were significantly higher in hypertensives than\nin normotensive controls but only vWF was an independent\ndeterminant of arterial stiffness.21 On the other hand, long-\nterm treatment with antihypertensive drugs targeting the\nRAAS, i.e. ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor block-\ners (ARBs), improves TOD. Indeed, RAAS antagonists\nlead to a reduction in arterial stiffness, improvement in\nendothelial dysfunction and regression of left ventricular\nhypertrophy, independent of the level of BP decrease.22\nIt has been reported that exercise can transiently increase\nthe risk of acute ischaemic events, especially in high-risk\npatients, and that the risk seems to correlate with exercise\nintensity and duration.23 In our study, treated hypertensive\npatients did not exhibit a hypercoagulable state after a bout\nof submaximal exercise. We should stress that the BP\nresponse during exercise was not exaggerated (no one had a\nsystolic BP response above 160 mmHg). This is probably\ndue to the fact that exercise was submaximal and the patients\nwere well treated. However, when these patients were newly\ndiagnosed, a small increase of thrombin generation associ-\nated with a mild increase in fibrin formation was evidenced\nby the increase of PF 1+2 and D-dimer levels, respectively.\nConversely, fibrinolysis was highly influenced in both\nexercise sessions. The plasmin\u00adantiplasmin complex\nreflects plasmin formation and has a half-life of about 120\nmin. Even though the fibrinolytic capacity of endothelium\nwas not measured directly, PAP complex represents the\ntotal fibrinolytic potential which is practically endothe-\nlium-driven. 16 It holds true that all biomarkers of fibrino-\nlytic status have different limitations. Free tPA released into\nblood from endothelial cells has a short half-time and rap-\nidly forms a complex with circulating PAI-1. Therefore,\ntPA antigen measures mainly inactive tPA/PAI-1 com-\nplexes. Moreover, measurement of plasma PAI-1 does not\nreflect the available PAI-1 because platelets contain\napproximately 90% of the total amount of PAI-1. Besides,\nit is still not clear whether total antigen or activity measure-\nments better reflect the physiological situation.24\nIn our study, PAP complex was found to be increased at\npeak exercise and to remain elevated post-exercise.\nExercise-triggered generation of plasmin in treated patients\noccurred in the absence of fibrin formation, indicating\ntissue plasminogen activator (tPA)-induced rather than\nthrombin-induced fibrinolysis activation.25\u00ad27 It has been\npreviously shown that in non-treated hypertensive patients\ntPA activity was higher immediately after exercise but\nreturned to resting levels within 30 min whereas decrease\nof PAI-1 antigen occurred only after 30 min.28 According to\nour results, exercise-stimulated tPA release is not impaired\nin hypertensive patients and this could have a protective\nrole for acute cardiovascular events during exercise. Indeed,\nthe ability of the endothelium to rapidly release tPAthat can\nreach the thrombus in an active and unbound state is critical\nfor the fibrinolytic process.29\nExercise-induced endothelium activation was also evi-\ndenced by increases of the same magnitude of vWf antigen\nlevels during both exercise sessions. Exercise promotes\nrelease of catecholamines which are known to trigger the\nactivation of endothelial cells and raise vWF plasma levels\nacutely owing to exocytosis from Weibel Palade bodies.30\nIncrease of vWf following an acute moderate or maximal\nexercise in healthy individuals has been demonstrated in\nvarious studies,31\u00ad35 while in patient population data are\nless consistent.36\u00ad39 It has been shown that acute intense\nexercise enhances shear-induced vWf binding to glycopro-\ntein platelet 1b (GP1b) receptors, as well as platelet activa-\ntion,32,33 while acute moderate exercise suppressed these\nevents.34 Moreover, results from experimental studies in\ncultured endothelial cells suggest that NO, whose bioavail-\nability increases during exercise training, is a possible\ninhibitor of endothelial vWF secretion.40\u00ad42 Further studies\nare needed in order to clarify whether exercise-related vWf\nrelease in hypertensive patients merely reflects the capacity\nof a healthy endothelium to respond to stress stimuli or\nwhether it is another facet of a prothrombotic state that\ncould be reversed by regular exercise training.\nThe sTM pathway was not activated during exercise,\neither before or after the treatment period. Scarce data exist\non exercise-mediated changes in sTM levels. However, it\nseems that exercise intensity levels and mechanical factors\nmay be involved in exercise-induced increases in sTM\n328 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 14(4)\nlevels. It has been shown that one hour of maximal speed\nrunning, but not swimming or cycling, significantly\nincreased sTM levels in male athletes.35,43\nP-Selectin is localized in the membranes of platelet a-gran-\nules and in Weibel Palade bodies of endothelial cells and\nmediates adhesion among leukocytes, platelets and endothe-\nlium. Raised levels of its soluble form imply platelet activa-\ntion.44 Available evidence suggest that short-term strenuous,\nbut not moderate, exercise induces transient platelet aggrega-\nHowever, in our study, moderate-intensity exercise in hyper-\ntensive patients, either un-treated or on antihypertensive treat-\nment, did not manage to increase sPsel secretion.\nStudy limitations\nOne of the major limitations of this study is the relatively\nsmall number of patients. Additionally, since HCTZ was part\nof antihypertensive therapy in two-thirds of the study group,\nour results may be influenced by HCTZ co-administration.\nWe should also state that endothelial fibrinolytic potential\nwas only indirectly measured, as t-PA and PAI-1 were not\nevaluated in this study. However, the fact that fibrinolytic\nactivity is our main interest in this study, may compensate for\nthe indirect estimation of endothelial fibrinolytic potential by\nPAP levels. Finally, our study included middle-aged, non-\ndiabetic subjects with mild-to-moderate hypertension.\nTherefore our findings may not be applicable to elderly\nhypertensive patients with more severe hypertension or with\nother co-morbidities.\nIn conclusion, in newly diagnosed, never-treated hyper-\ntensive patients, a small increase in thrombin generation\nand fibrin formation is evidenced as a response to an acute\nbout of submaximal exercise. Long-term treatment with\nramipril seems to have a favourable impact on exercise-\ninduced haemostatic response. The activation of the hae-\nmostatic system is attenuated while the endothelial\nfibrinolytic potential is unaffected, rapidly available after\nstimulus and preserved for at least one year after the initial\ndiagnosis of hypertensive disease and treatment initiation.\nIncreased fibrinolytic activity and endothelial activation\nare the dominant features of the submaximal exercise-\ninduced haemostatic response in treated hypertensive\npatients, but their clinical relevance has not yet been clari-\nfied. It may be of interest to investigate the changes in hae-\nmostatic response to exercise after a longer period of\ntraining, as well as antihypertensive treatment.\nConflict of interest\nNone declared.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any funding\nagency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
