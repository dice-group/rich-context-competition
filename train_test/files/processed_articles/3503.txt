One of the risk factors for obesity in\nearly life is rapid weight gain in infancy (Baird et al., 2005),\nbut risk is also conferred by the following factors: the\nmother's body mass index (BMI) as well as her weight\ngain during pregnancy (Cedergren, 2004), duration of\nbreastfeeding and bottle feeding (Dietz and Gortmaker,\n2001), the age at which solid foods are introduced (Ong\net al., 2006) and parental feeding practices (Brown and\nDecisions about feeding early in life, such as whether to\nbreastfeed and for how long, are important determinants of\ngrowthvelocity(SinghalandLanigan,2007).Breastfeeding\nis likely to contribute to responsive feeding since it is\nthought that mothers are more in tune with their baby's\nhunger and satiety cues. Mode of feeding, when solid\nfoods are introduced, what is fed during weaning, parental\nfeeding styles and behaviours during mealtimes shape\na parent's role is not to decide how much the child should\neat but to determine the type of food that children are intro-\nduced to, the portion size, the frequency with which it is\neaten and the social context within which eating occurs.\nThis has been used as a core construct within the NOURISH\ntrial: `mother provides, child decides' (Daniels et al.,\n2009). Moreover, feeding behaviours vary, and Blissett\n(2011) notes that each mother tends to follow a different\nfeeding style. For example, an authoritarian feeding style\n(a controlling type of feeding) is characterized by strict\nrules about food consumption, whereas an authoritative\n(more responsive in terms of warmth) feeding style\ninvolves placing high expectations upon the child's diet\n(i.e. healthy foods).\nBreast is best: Positive mealtime\ninteractions in breastfeeding mothers\nfrom Israel and the United Kingdom\nNetalie Shloim1, MCJ Rudolf2, RG Feltbower1, L Mohebati3\nand M Hetherington1\n Keywords\nbreastfeeding, feeding cues, infants, mealtime interactions, obesity\n1University of Leeds, UK\n2Bar-Ilan University, Israel\n3Brighton and Sussex Medical School, UK\nCorresponding author:\nNetalie Shloim, Institute of Psychological Sciences, University of Leeds,\nEmail: n.shloim@leeds.ac.uk\nIntervention Study\n2 Health Psychology Open \nFew studies have explored maternal characteristics and\ninfant feeding behaviours. However, Brown and Lee (2011)\ninvestigated maternal feeding style during weaning and\nnoted that mothers with a high BMI show a high level of\nconcern for their child's weight and attempt to control their\nchild's size. The findings by Brown and Lee (2011) there-\nfore suggest that mothers who scored high in the restraint\nand emotional eating sub-scales of the Dutch Eating\nBehaviour Questionnaire (DEBQ) were more concerned\nfor their child's weight compared to mothers who scored\nlower. Interestingly enough, those mothers who saw them-\nselves as heavy also perceived their infant's body size as\nlarger than average. In support, Rodgers et al. (2013) noted\nthat maternal dietary restraint predicted infant's change in\nBMI Z-scores.\nThese findings strengthen the claim that feeding is not\nonly about what the infant eats but also about how a mother\nand her infant interact during the meal. Understanding the\ncomplexity of early mealtime interactions and their effect\nin the long term is of considerable interest since early expe-\nriences of feeding predict eating later in life (Nicklaus and\nStudies have shown that infants are born with the ability\nto self-regulate their consumption of food and signal to\ntheir mothers when they are hungry and when they are full.\nBirch notes that parents may not recognize their infant's\nhunger and satiety signals; consequently, they over-feed\ntheir infant, potentially leading to a reduced ability to self-\nwere bottle-fed in early infancy were more likely to empty\nthe bottle or cup in late infancy compared to infants who\nwere fed directly from the breast. Breastfeeding is therefore\nassociated with the infant actively drawing the milk out of\nthe breast, thus controlling the pace of their meal and\nenergy consumption.\nFormula feeding or feeding breast milk from a bottle\nmay encourage a more passive form of feeding since moth-\ners can judge volume consumed and may be more able to\ncontrol the feed duration and amount. Therefore, feeding\nfrom a bottle is associated with parental feeding control and\nlower ability to self-regulate energy intake (Arenz et al.,\n2004). Thus, some feeding practices in early infancy are\npositively associated with poorer energy compensation,\noverconsumption and eventually the development of later\nobesity (Baker et al., 2004). A recent follow-up study by Li\net al. (2014) noted some long-term effects of early feeding\nstyles on eating behaviours at 6 years of age. Bottle-fed\ninfants were more likely to be encouraged to empty their\nbottles and showed lower satiety responsiveness at 6 years\nold compared to breastfed infants. Thus, feeding practices\ncan have an enduring impact on later eating traits.\nIn addition, excessive parental control over feeding such\nas restriction or pressure to eat may be adversely associated\nwith under- or overfeeding, respectively, potentially lead-\ning to feeding problems (Farrow and Blissett, 2006b;\nJohnson and Birch, 1994). Other studies suggest that lower\nlevels of feeding behaviour control promote healthier\neating behaviours in childhood (Faith et al., 2004; Fisher\nSeveral studies have now shown the high levels of herit-\nability in eating traits such as food fussiness or satiety\nresponsiveness (Llewellyn et al., 2010). This further sug-\ngests that parental feeding practices such as restriction or\npressure may be in response to inherent child eating traits.\nSome eating traits could place children at a higher risk of\nobesity, for example, rapid eating, eating in the absence of\nhunger, eating enjoyment and low satiety responsiveness.\nFisher and Birch (2002) demonstrated that obese children\nare more likely to eat in the absence of hunger and respond\nless to internal cues of satiety than healthy weight\nchildren.\nGiven the influence of eating traits on the risk of obesity\nand the role of parents in responding to these characteris-\ntics, mealtimes may hold the key to understanding the\ndynamic nature of the parent\u00adchild interaction in determin-\ning food intake and the development of appetite control.\nEating traits can be measured with questionnaires such as\nthe Baby Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (Llewellyn et al.,\n2011) or the Child Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (Wardle\nand Johnson, 2002). However, mealtime interactions are\nbest understood in real time and via recorded observations\nrather than recall. This presents a methodological challenge\ninsofar as it requires both the presence of an investigator\nduring mealtimes and a valid coding structure to score dis-\ncrete behaviours of the mother and the baby during the\nmeal.\nEven with validated coding schemes, such as the Nursing\nChild Assessment Feeding Scale (NCFAS; Hodges et al.,\n2007), there remain challenges including low reliability\nand low internal consistency of the scale for infants under\n12 months of age. In addition, coding behaviours is made\nmore difficult since mothers report difficulty in understand-\ning cues from their babies signalling hunger and satiety\nduring meals (Hodges et al., 2008). Notwithstanding the\ndifficulty of observing and characterizing mealtime interac-\ntions, the early feeding period provides an important win-\ndow into how caregivers affect infant self-regulation of\nenergy intake and also how responsive parents are to their\ninfant's temperament and eating traits. In particular, it is\nuseful to capture the mood, atmosphere and characteristics\nof the verbal communication during feeds since the meal-\ntime is not merely about the content of the meal but how it\nis delivered and what is said.\nThis study is nested within a larger study exploring feel-\nings, eating behaviours and infant feeding practices in\nIsraeli and UK mothers from pregnancy (Shloim et al.,\nShloim et al. 3\nThe rationale for comparing the two countries is primarily\nbased on cultural differences, for example, the greater iden-\ntification by Israeli women with American ideals of body\nimage. Laungani (2006) notes that body dissatisfaction is\nmore common in countries where people have a more\nWestern lifestyle with Israeli women being exposed to\naspects of Western values through media and by its close\nrelationships with the United States (Heesacker et al.,\n2000). Despite Western influences, Israel is considered\nnon-Western in terms of lifestyle (Heesacker et al., 2000),\nas being less affluent and privileged than the United States.\nThus, Israeli women show lower levels of body dissatisfac-\ntion compared to American women (Barak et al., 1994;\nance of the thin ideal in both countries.\nBoth Israel and the United Kingdom are Western-\nfocused, industrially developed countries. However, life\nin Israel is very different to that in the United Kingdom.\nIsrael is a relatively new country (established in 1948)\nconstantly battling for recognition within a hostile cli-\nmate. The average number of children in Israel is three per\nfamily (Israel Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), 2007;\n(Shaw and Giles, 2009). The majority of Israelis perceive\nchildless people to have empty lives (Remennick, 2000),\nwhereas studies from the United Kingdom report the\nincreasing numbers of voluntarily childless women (Shaw,\n2010). It is therefore possible that higher levels of stress\nin Israel, shorter duration of maternal leave and the threat\nof losing your child to military service all contribute to\nvery different experiences of motherhood, to well-being\nand to the eating behaviours of Israeli and UK women.\nPrevious comparisons of Israeli and UK mothers found\nno differences in infant eating behaviours, but across both\ncountries, heavier mothers tended to feed their infants\naccording to a schedule (Shloim et al., 2014). In support,\nthe EMPOWER study reported that obese mothers were\nobserved as responding during feeding with pressure to eat\nor a restriction on eating depending on the size of their\nTaking account of the importance of maternal BMI and\nthe possible influence of cultural differences as reported by\nShloim et al. (2013), the primary aim of this study was to\ninvestigate mealtime interactions of mother\u00adbaby dyads,\nwithin a sample of healthy weight and overweight/obese\nmothers. It was hypothesized that (a) heavier mothers\nwould have less positive feeding interactions than healthy\nweight mothers, (b) the babies of heavier mothers would\nhave a faster pace of eating and a greater interest in food\nand (c) breastfeeding mothers would be more in tune with\ntheir baby's signals during feeding and be less distracted by\nexternal cues. Moreover, as the length of maternity leave\nvaries between Israel and the United Kingdom (Shloim et al.,\nweeks following birth (compared to UK mothers who\nreturn to work 26\u00ad52 weeks post-partum), it was hypothe-\nsized that Israeli mothers would have fewer feeding experi-\nences than UK mothers, potentially resulting in a less\npositive mealtime interaction.\nMethods\nParticipants\nThe sample was drawn from 156 women in Israel (N=67)\nand the United Kingdom (N=89) who were participating in\na study to explore emotions and eating behaviours during\nticipated in the follow-up study (N=42; 59% (Israel),\nN\n=\n31; 41% (the United Kingdom)). These women were\napproached to take part in an in-depth study on feeding\ninteractions involving filmed feeding in the home every 6\nmonths for 2 years. A total of 41 mothers were filmed four\ntimes resulting in a total of 164 films exploring mealtime\ninteractions (in a 2-year follow-up). The results of the first\nrecorded mealtime are presented here. Although the sample\nsizeisrelativelysmall(furtheraddressedinthe`Limitations'\nsection), given the eventual recruited numbers and the\nacknowledged cultural differences between the two coun-\ntries, certain comparisons were made between Israeli ver-\nsus UK samples. Furthermore, large sample sizes are\ndifficult to obtain in studies of filmed mother\u00adinfant inter-\nactions as described by Khadr et al. (2011).\nProcedure\nThe researcher (N.S.) contacted all mothers between 5 and\n12 weeks after the birth of their child and set a date to visit,\nat a convenient time to film a `meal'. The researcher asked\nthe participants to feed their baby as normal and try to\nignore the presence of the researcher. The time of the meet-\ning was arranged in advance to coincide with the usual time\nof a feed, although this was more challenging with breast-\nfed infants. Mothers were interviewed on this occasion\nwith questions on mood, eating behaviours following preg-\nnancy, their infant's daily schedule and eating habits as\ndescribed elsewhere (Shloim et al., in press). Thus, on the\nfew occasions mothers suspected the baby was not yet\nready to eat, the researcher waited until the mother felt\nit was the right time to feed and then subsequently\ninterviewed the mother. Thus, in most of the occasions, the\nfeeding commenced after babies demonstrated hunger by\ncrying or by being unsettled.\nBreastfeeding was defined as a feed directly from\nthe breast, not expressed milk given by bottle. Non-\nbreastfeeding meals were defined as those where formula\nor solid foods such as pureed fruits, vegetables or bread\nwith soft cheese were offered to the infant.\n4 Health Psychology Open \nThe Simple Feeding Elements Scale\nThe Simple Feeding Elements Scale (SFES; Mohebati, in\npreparation) was developed from the Health Exercise and\nNutrition for the Really Young (HENRY) programme, an\nintervention aimed at preventing obesity within the first few\nmonths of an infant's life (Brown et al., 2013; Rudolf et al.,\n2010). The scale was also used as part of the EMPOWER\nclinical trial (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/\nprevent the development of obesity from infancy, results of\nwhich were submitted to the UK Department of Health in\nnally contained 7 feeding variables but was modified to\ninclude 10 variables pertaining to mother\u00adbaby feeding\ninteractions (see Box 1). Examples of the elements are the\npositioning item for which a higher score is awarded for\nfeeding the baby face-to-face, whereas a lower score is\nawarded when the baby is facing the TV. Another element is\nchild participation where the baby is encouraged to self-\nfeed, and as such, a lower score is awarded when mothers\nrestrict eating, such as when a mother removes a plate from\nher child in order to prevent him or her from eating indepen-\ndently. The SFES is rated on a 3-point Likert scale by a\ntrained observer, ranging from 1 (less ideal; indicating feed-\ning while the baby is distracted by TV or toys, feeding foods\nwhich are less healthy) to 3 (more ideal; feeding the baby\nface to face, pausing the feed while a potent disengagement\ncue occurs, etc.). Elements were coded separately as\nCronbach's alpha showed a weak correlation between the\nscale elements. Further details of the scale are available\nelsewhere (Nursing Child Assessment Satellite Training;\nBarnard et al., 1993; Mohebati, in preparation). All films\nwere viewed by the lead researcher (N.S.), a qualified psy-\nchotherapist with training in both the SFES and Nursing\nChild Assessment Satellite Training (NCAST). A second\nresearcher (C.N.), trained in the SFES, was asked to view\nthe films and code them independently. Finally, the third\nresearcher (L.M.; experienced NCAST and SFES coder)\nalso viewed and rated the material independently. For vari-\nables that did not reach an agreement of more than 75 per\ncent, L.M. adjudicated the final score.\nBox 1.

A less ideal feed is while\nno vocalization is observed.\nFruits, vegetables and breast milk The meal contains fruits, vegetables and/or breast milk.\nBMI and weight measurements\nBabies' weight, length/height and age at measurement\nwere recorded from the Child Health Parent Held Records\n(`red book' in the United Kingdom and equivalent in\nIsrael). Standardized Z-scores for weight (WHO, 2010)\nwere calculated for all infants and are presented as mean\nZ-scores for weight in Table 1. One infant was born\npre-term and the Z-score for weight was excluded from the\ntable. The results from this meal interaction were origi-\nnally removed as eating behaviours vary between pre-term\nand full-term babies. However, as no significant differ-\nences were observed when removed or retained, the data\nwere kept. Mothers were asked to report their own weight\nand height and then BMI was calculated as weight (kg)\ndivided by height (m) squared. Mothers were then\ncategorized as underweight (BMI<18.5kg/m2), healthy\nusing WHO classifications. The validation process for\nmaternal self-reported BMI was conducted using a sensi-\ntivity analysis. This was carried out by creating a second\nShloim et al. 5\nvariable where 2kg was added and subtracted to weights,\nand the BMI categories were re-checked. This analysis\nresulted in no difference in the distribution across the cat-\negories, providing confidence that the use of reported\nrather than measured BMI was acceptable. Due to the rela-\ntively low number of underweight and obese women\n=\n6, respectively), the categories were pooled\nand the analysis undertaken comparing healthy weight\n(N=13; BMI25kg/m2). The limitations of this proce-\ndure are further addressed at the end of this article.\nData analysis\nAnalysis was conducted using Stata version 12 and SPSS\nStatistics 20. Each film was scored according to the SFES.\nMann\u00adWhitney tests were applied to determine any potential\ndifferences between mothers according to sociodemographic\nvariables such as age and levels of education. An additional\nvariable to identify mode of feeding (breastfeeding vs other\nfeeding) was created and its correlation with BMI and SFES\nscores assessed. All scores were then compared by BMI cat-\negory and by mode of feeding (i.e. frequency of mothers\nobtaining ideal, average or less than ideal ratings for each\nelement) using the Mann\u00adWhitney test. Spearman's rank\ncorrelation test was applied to determine whether there was\nany evidence of correlation between each element of the\nSFES. Finally, the data were analysed to determine whether\nthere were differences in the results between the two coun-\ntries, using the Mann\u00adWhitney test.\nEthical considerations\nThe study was approved by the Ethics Committee at the\nInstitute of Psychological Sciences at the University of\nTable 1.

Table 1 presents the main\ncharacteristics of the participants who were filmed.\nMothers' mean age was 34.1 (3.8) years. Most were mar-\nparous. Maternal BMI was similar in both countries, and\nmost mothers were within the healthy weight range com-\npared to overweight/obese. At the time of filming, babies\nranged in age from 5 to 24 weeks. This reflected mothers'\navailability and willingness to arrange a filmed mealtime.\nMothers reported that they introduced solid foods between\n4 and 6 months. The findings were not in agreement with\nthe national recommendations in Israel and the United\nKingdom advising mothers to introduce solid food at 6\nmonths. (http://www.health.gov.il/English/SearchResults/\nPages/GlobalSearch.aspx; http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/\npregnancy-and-baby/pages/solid-foods-weaning.aspx).\nBabies' age was normally distributed with two outliers:\none baby being much younger (5 weeks of age) and one\nbaby older (27 weeks) than the main cohort. The average\nage of introduction to solid food was 16 weeks and did not\nvary significantly between countries. No significant differ-\nences were identified between countries for the age at\nwhich weaning commenced. Mode of feeding was similar\nin both countries, and significantly more women had ever\nbreastfed compared to those who had not in each country\n(p\n<\n0.01). Of the total sample, 83 per cent of women had\ninitiated breastfeeding and were either still breastfeeding or\nhad stopped at the time of the study. Nevertheless, only 48\nper cent of the women breastfed during the filmed interac-\ntions. Significantly, more women from the United Kingdom\nelected to breastfeed their baby during the mealtime com-\npared to the Israeli sample (p<0.01). This might be attrib-\nuted to the working status of mothers with higher levels of\nstay-at home mothers in the United Kingdom compared to\nIsrael. Thus, breastfeeding during the day (in which the\nfilms were recorded) was more common in the United\nKingdom simply due to work constraints. The higher levels\nin UK breastfeeding mothers were not significantly related\nto babies' age.\nSFES\nMost mothers scored the maximum for most of the ele-\nments of the scale (3). As such, mothers tend to feed a\nhealthy meal, not in front of the TV and did not use feeding\ncommands. In other words, this sample consisted of moth-\ners who were generally responsive to their infants. Their\nbehaviours were commensurate with a healthy level of\ninteraction, whether they elected to breastfeed, bottle-feed\nor provide their infants with solids during the mealtime.\nTable 2 presents the scores for the SFES, first for the total\nsample and then according to BMI category and mode of\nfeeding. Mean duration of the feed was 21 (4.8) minutes\n(range: 8\u00ad26 minutes) and was similar between breastfeed-\nminutes, respectively).\nRelation to maternal BMI\nAmong the healthy weight mothers, just over half elected to\nbreastfeed on the day of filming compared to feeding a\nmixed or solid food meal. Among the overweight mothers,\nfewer elected to breastfeed on the day of filming compared\nto offering a bottle or solid meal, but this was not signifi-\ncantly different either within the group or compared to\nhealthy weight mothers. BMI category revealed no signifi-\ncant differences in mealtime interaction scores in the SFES\n(Table 2, Figure 1).\nMode of feeding\nSignificant differences in SFES elements were found by\nmode of feeding (Figure 2, Table 3). For example, breast-\nfeeding mothers were more likely to feed without distrac-\ntion (the baby accepts the feed without being distracted;\np\n<\n0.01) and scored higher for setting (no distractions of\nTV or toys during mealtime; p<0.05). They were also more\nlikely to pause the feed during a potent disengagement cue\n(p\n<\n0.01), such as turning the head away or face gazing.\nBreastfeeding mothers by definition allowed the baby to\nself-feed and determine their own pace of eating.\nCorrelations between and within SFES elements\nThe duration of feeding correlated with feeding disengage-\n<\n0.05). Thus, the longer the feed, the\nmore likely mothers would pause in order to respond to dis-\nengagement cues such as arching the back or moving the\nhead away from the food or the breast.\nChild participation was negatively correlated with posi-\n<\n0.01) indicating that a face-to-face\nposition during the meal was associated with greater restric-\ntion of the child self-feeding (Table 3). Child participation\nwas also positively correlated with pacing (=0.62;\np\n<\n0.01), suggesting that children who fed themselves\ndetermined their own pace of eating. It was positively cor-\ntive aspects of verbal communication). Thus, the more\nmothers encouraged self-feeding, the fewer eating com-\nmands they issued, such as `eat this now', `eat more',\n`enough with the pasta'and so on, whether breastfed or oth-\nerwise fed. Mothers who did not use feeding commands\nwere also likely to pause feeding during a disengagement\nPacing was negatively correlated with positioning\n<\n0.01). An ideal interaction would involve\ncaregiver and infant having their faces aligned, as in a\nShloim et al. 7\nTable 2.

During a breastfeeding interaction, this\nwould mean the mother would have to make an effort to\nturn her head to the side; otherwise her face would be\nperpendicular to that of her breastfeeding infant's.

However, trends revealed more positive\nmealtime interactions within the UK sample. This could be\nexplained by the observation that UK babies' mean age and\nweight at filming were greater than for the Israeli women\n(Table 2), and significantly more UK women breastfed\ntheir infants during the filmed feeding.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we aimed to investigate mealtime interactions\nin mother\u00adinfant dyads when the infants were aged between\n2 and 6 months. No differences were seen between meal-\ntime interactions for healthy weight women and overweight\nor obese women or by country. However, breastfeeding was\nassociated with a more positive mealtime experience than\nother modes of feeding. Breastfeeding mothers were more\nin tune with their baby's signals during feeding and were\nless distracted by external cues. Thus, in this study, breast-\nfeeding mothers provided a more positive interaction dur-\ning feeding by distracting the baby less, providing a more\nideal environment, pausing the feed to respond to infants'\nsignals to stop and facilitating independence through self-\nfeeding. In addition, the longer the duration of the meal, the\nmore mothers responded to their infant's disengagement by\npausing during the expression of a satiety cue (e.g. arching\nthe back or moving away from the breast). This was sup-\nported by a slightly longer duration of feeding for mothers\nwho initiated breastfeeding.\nFewer commands were issued by mothers when self-\nfeeding was encouraged. The more mothers enjoyed the\nmealtime interaction (positive mood and atmosphere), the\nmore they encouraged self-feeding (allowing the baby to\nhold and touch the breast while breastfeeding, holding the\nbottle or finger food for solid food). Enjoyment did not dif-\nfer by mode of feeding. These findings are similar to Farrow\nand Blissett (2006) who demonstrated that breastfeeding\npredicts fewer negative mealtime interactions in 1-year-old\ninfants, mainly as mothers are less likely to pressure their\ninfants to eat. In support, Brown and Arnott (2014) noted\nthat mothers who follow an infant-led feeding approach\n(positively associated with breastfeeding) were more aware\nof their infant's hunger and satiety cues. Thus, breastfeed-\ning can facilitate sensitivity to the infant's appetite (Caton\nBreastfeeding mothers showed more positive outcomes\nin relation to pacing, responding to disengagement cues\n10 Health Psychology Open \nand providing fewer distractions, which can be transferred\nto the complementary feeding period. Transitioning to sol-\nids is an important time when less maternal control and\nmore encouragement of infant self-feeding and setting their\nown pace of eating (i.e. trusting the infant to know what is\nbest) may be important in establishing healthier future eat-\ning habits. The usefulness of SFES may reside in its ability\nto identify elements of feeding interactions in the first year\nof life which may potentially impact later eating behav-\niours. This is unique in comparison with other existing\nfeeding observation scales such as that developed by\nHodges et al. (2013), which are applied to feeding infants\naged 12 months and older.\nBreastfeeding establishes a strong bond between mother\nand infant (Kuzela et al., 1990), and many enjoy the inti-\nmacy being established in the feeding interaction with\nhigher levels of sensitivity to their infants 3 months post-\npartum (Britton et al., 2007). However, in this study, there\nwas no difference in the level of enjoyment between moth-\ners who breastfed or those who fed solids/formula during\nthe meal. This could be attributable to the young age of the\nbabies and the possibility that in the early stages of feeding\nthe baby is less likely to exhibit food refusal and challenging\nbehaviours, so creating a more joyful and positive experi-\nence for the mother and her baby. This might also be attrib-\nuted to the selectiveness of the sample (i.e. mothers were\ninterested in participating in a study about feeding their\nbabies) and were thus more attuned to feeding whether they\nelected to breastfeed during the filmed interaction or not.\nBreastfeeding produced a greater opportunity for posi-\ntive mealtime interactions, even accounting for elements\nof the scale which favour breastfeeding such as child par-\nticipation. This provides further confirmation of the bene-\nfits of breastfeeding beyond nutrition (Shah, 2013), and\nthe psychological benefit to mother and baby. However,\nfor the positioning element of the scale, breastfeeding\nmothers tended to exhibit only average or not ideal com-\npared to other elements. Thus, one might not expect a\nbreastfeeding mother to align her face with her child's dur-\ning breastfeeding as this is challenging given that the\nchild's mouth is facing the breast. However, a mother who\nfails to align her face with her child during feeding due to\ndistractions (e.g. mobile phone, watching TV or looking\nelsewhere) is less interactive and therefore coded as\nhaving a less positive mealtime experience than mothers\nwho face their baby.\nNo significant differences between countries emerged,\nand any findings were likely to be attributable to the differ-\nent modes of feeding chosen for the filmed interactions.\nThis may have been affected by the difference in paid\nmaternity leave entitlement between Israel and the United\nWomen in our study were highly educated and of a rela-\ntively high socioeconomic status, therefore more likely to\ninitiate and maintain breastfeeding within a generally\nhealthy lifestyle. This supports the findings of others\nincluding Crombie et al. (2009) who described how par-\nents' age, level of education and health knowledge all play\nan important role in food and feeding choices including\nrates of breastfeeding. Moreover, breastfeeding could serve\nas a learning experience for future feeding interactions, as\nsuggested by Britton et al. (2007). Breastfeeding mothers\nwho demonstrated more enjoyment in the feeding interac-\ntions might be more inclined to translate this into later feed-\ning by being more in tune with their infant's feeding cues\nand introduce healthier foods. We intend to follow up these\ninfants and mothers for 2 more years to explore any ongo-\ning effect of breastfeeding on larger mealtime interactions.\nFigure 3. Percentages of participants with more ideal scores distributed by country.\nNo significant differences.\nLimitations\nOur findings should be considered in relation to the limitations\nof the study. Women were self-selected and well-educated,\noriginating from a relatively affluent sub-population. This\nmight have impacted their decision and ability to breastfeed\nand might have contributed to a more positive feeding\ninteraction. Although the power calculations showed that\nthe sample size was sufficient to determine significant dif-\nferences between Israeli and UK babies' and mothers' BMI\n(for the combined sample of all four follow-ups), a larger\nsample size with a broader range of weight categories might\nhave permitted observing clearer differences in feeding\ninteractions between countries and differing BMI catego-\nries. Moreover, it is possible that overweight and obese\nwomen demonstrate different mealtime interactions which\nwere not considered here. This study combined both BMI\ncategories into a single BMI group. Thus, future research\ncould benefit by addressing possible differences for each\ncategory independently. This sample had a smaller propor-\ntion of overweight and obese women compared to levels\nfor the general population (WHO, 2010), perhaps due\nto the skewed socioeconomic distribution or that obese\nmothers may be less likely to agree to be filmed during\nmealtime interactions. Finally, this study involved feeding\ninteractions on one occasion and there-fore may be unrep-\nresentative of mother\u00adinfant feeding interactions more\ngenerally. This will be addressed in the future with further\nfollow-up periods for each dyad, over 2 years.\nConclusion and recommendations\nOur findings indicate the feasibility of assessing mother\u00ad\ninfant mealtime interactions in young infants and\ncontribute to previous research by providing evidence of\ndifferences between breastfeeding and other feeding during\nmealtime interactions. The study also emphasizes the\nimportance of exploring such interactions not only via what\nis given within a meal but also by understanding mother\u00ad\ninfant levels of enjoyment and emotional interactions\nduring a meal. Mealtime interactions offer an insight into\nthe quality of the early feeding experience, and few studies\nto date have achieved this within a natural setting. There is\na clear need to explore this area further within larger and\nmore diverse populations.\n"
