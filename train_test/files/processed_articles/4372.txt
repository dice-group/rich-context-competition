Aldosterone breakthrough has been associated with worsening congestive heart failure and chronic kidney\ndisease, yet the pathophysiology remains unclear. Breakthrough has not been associated with elevated peripheral blood\npressure, but no studies have assessed its effect on central blood pressure.\nMethods: Nineteen subjects with well-controlled peripheral blood pressure on stable doses of angiotensin-converting\nenzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker had aldosterone levels checked and central blood pressure parameters\nmeasured using the SphygmoCor system. The central blood pressure parameters of subjects with or without\nbreakthrough, defined as serum aldosterone >15 ng/dl, were compared.\nResults: Of the 19 subjects, six had breakthrough with a mean aldosterone level of 33.8 ng/dl, and 13 were without\nbreakthrough with a mean level of 7.1 ng/dl. There was no significant difference between the two groups in any central\nblood pressure parameter.\nConclusions: We found no correlation between aldosterone breakthrough and central blood pressure. The clinical\nimpact of aldosterone breakthrough likely depends on its non-genomic, pro-fibrotic, pro-inflammatory effects rather\nthan its regulation of extracellular volume.\n",

Aldosterone is primarily\nregulated by angiotensin II (ATII), serum potassium levels,\nand to a minor extent by serum adrenocorticotropic hor-\nmone (ACTH). Breakthrough has been shown in patients on\nARBs,6 indicating that ATII derived from non-ACE cataly-\nsis of angiotensin 1 (AT1) to ATII is unlikely to play a role\nin breakthrough. Additionally, hyperkalemia does not\nappear to be contributory, as potassium levels are not sig-\nnificantly different between patients with and without\nbreakthrough.7 There may be a role for the AT2 receptor, as\nexperiments in hypertensive rats with breakthrough on\nAldosterone breakthrough does not\nalter central hemodynamics\nAndrew Beenken and Andrew S. Bomback\n Keywords\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, central blood pressure, aldosterone\nbreakthrough, central pulse pressure, augmentation pressure, augmentation index\nDepartment of Medicine, Division of Nephrology, Columbia University\nMedical Center, New York, NY, USA\nCorresponding author:\nAndrew Bomback, Division of Nephrology, Columbia University, 622\nEmail Asb68@columbia.edu\nOriginal Article\n2 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System\nACEi subsequently showed reduced aldosterone levels after\nreceiving an AT2 antagonist.8\nObservational studies have shown that aldosterone\nbreakthrough is associated with increased morbidity in\npatients with chronic heart and kidney diseases, including\nincreased left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH),7 reduced\nexercise tolerance,9 increased albuminuria in CKD,10 and\naccelerated decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR).11\nTwo hypotheses could explain the clinical impact of\naldosterone breakthrough: (a) activation of pro-fibrotic\nand pro-inflammatory pathways by aldosterone leading to\ntemic pressure due to increased sodium absorption and\npotassium excretion. The former hypothesis implies that\nthe deleterious effects of breakthrough are based primar-\nily in aldosterone's non-epithelial effects, while the latter\nhypothesis implies that aldosterone's classic effects at the\nepithelial sodium channel are responsible for injury.\nStudies of aldosterone breakthrough, to date, have not\nshown that breakthrough leads to elevated peripheral\nblood pressure (PBP).4,10,15 Central blood pressure (CBP)\nand PBP often do not correlate,16 exemplified by the\nreduced CBP with amlodipine/perindopril compared to\natenolol/thiazide in the CAF\u00c9 subgroup of the ASCOT\ntrial despite statistically equivalent PBP.17 CBP parameters\nhave also been shown to be incrementally superior to PBP\nin predicting carotid hypertrophy and LVH,18 time to first\ncardiovascular event,19 microalbuminuria,20 and progres-\nsion to end stage renal disease (ESRD).21 Given that PBP\nmay not accurately represent CBP and that CBP has inde-\npendent value in predicting cardiovascular (CV) and renal\noutcomes, we investigated whether aldosterone break-\nthrough was associated with elevated CBP parameters in a\ncohort of patients on long-standingACEi andARB therapy\nwith well-controlled PBP.\nMethods\nParticipants\nThis cross-sectional study recruited volunteers from the\nnephrology clinics at New York Presbyterian Hospital. All\nsubjects signed an informed consent before enrollment.\nThe study was approved by the Institutional Review Board\nof Columbia University Medical Center.\nPatients were eligible for inclusion if they had well-con-\ntrolled PBP (<140/90 mm Hg) on stable doses of ACEi or\nARB for >1 year, as well as no changes to other anti-hyper-\ntensive medications for >1 year, including diuretics. Patients\nwere excluded if they had atrial fibrillation, a diagnosis of\nsecondary hypertension, known structural vascular abnor-\nmalities, potassium >5.5, or a prescription for a mineralo-\ncorticoid receptor blocker. It was not deemed necessary that\na patient be on maximal doses of ACEi to be included in the\nstudy, since no association has been found between the dose\nof ACEi and the incidence of breakthrough.22\nNon-invasive hemodynamic data acquisition\nParticipants were studied in the seated position, brachial\nsystolic and diastolic blood pressures were obtained\nusing an aneroid sphygmomanometer, and those pres-\nsures were in turn used to calibrate the SphygmoCor\nAtCor central arterial pressure device.23 Applanation\ntonometry of the radial artery provided waveforms that\nwere processed with pulse wave analysis according to the\nmanufacturer's guidelines to derive a waveform of the\nascending aorta. Systolic and diastolic CBP were meas-\nured directly from this derived central waveform, central\npulse pressure (CPP) calculated as the difference between\nsystolic and diastolic CBP, augmentation pressure (AP)\ncalculated as the difference between the second and first\nsystolic peaks, and augmentation index (AI) as the ratio\nof AP to CPP, normalized for a HR of 75. Estimations of\nCBP using applanation tonometry have been well vali-\ndated, and non-invasive measurements of CBP using this\ntechnique correspond closely to those obtained through\ncatheterization, with a mean error of only 1.1 mm Hg in\none meta-analysis.24\nDefinition and measurement of aldosterone\nbreakthrough\nA variety of different cutoffs have been used to define\naldosterone breakthrough including the mean value in the\nstudied population (ranging from 6\u00ad10 ng/dl). For this\nstudy, aldosterone breakthrough was defined using the\nstrictest available criteria for a cross-sectional study: an\naldosterone level above the upper limit of normal,22\ndefined as >15 ng/dl at our institution. Sample acquisition\nfor aldosterone levels was conducted in a seated, upright\nposture along with routine laboratory testing ordered at\neach participant's outpatient nephrology clinic visit. No\nrestrictions were imposed on participants regarding diet or\nfluid intake prior to sample acquisition.\nStatistical analysis\nData analysis was conducted using Student's t-test to eval-\nuate for difference between those patients with and with-\nout aldosterone breakthrough, with significance set at\np<0.05. Analyses were also performed separately for quar-\ntiles of aldosterone levels.\nResults\nPatient characteristics\nThe mean age of participants in the study was 53\u00b118 years,\nwith roughly equal representation of ACEi and ARB in\ntheir medication lists (Table 1). Diuretics were over-\nrepresented in the breakthrough group, but had been stably\ndosed for >1 year as per our inclusion criteria so that they\nBeenken and Bomback 3\nwould be without dynamic effect on the renin-angiotensin-\naldosterone system (RAAS) axis. CBP and AP are known\nto increase with age,16 but no significant difference was\nfound between the mean age of individuals with and with-\nout breakthrough. Women comprised only 26% of indi-\nviduals, and the majority of the participants were either\nHispanic or Caucasian by ethnicity. No significant differ-\nence in body mass index (BMI) could be seen between the\ntwo groups. Of the 19 subjects evaluated, six were found\nto have aldosterone levels >15 ng/dl, classifying them as\nhaving aldosterone breakthrough as per our pre-defined\ncriteria. Between those with and without aldosterone\nbreakthrough, there was no difference in serum potassium\nlevels but a significant difference was found in terms of the\nseverity of CKD. In addition to an increased prevalence of\nmacroalbuminuria, individuals with aldosterone break-\nthrough had a mean serum creatinine (Cr) 3.2\u00b11.9 mg/dl,\nsignificantly higher than those without breakthrough, who\nologies leading to CKD were represented in our study\ngroup (Supplementary Material, Table 1).\nCentral hemodynamics in aldosterone\nbreakthrough\nNone of the central hemodynamic parameters we meas-\nured had any significant difference according to aldoster-\none breakthrough status (Table 2). Mean CBP, CPP, AP,\nand AI were all without statistically significant differences\nbetween the two groups. Categorizing the subjects in terms\nof quartiles for serum aldosterone levels 0\u00ad6 ng/dl (n=5),\ncreated four groups each with statistically significant dif-\nferences in mean serum aldosterone level (Table 3).\nHowever, this grouping by quartiles did not reveal any sta-\ntistically significant differences between the first and\nfourth quartiles nor any statistically significant trends in\nthe overall dataset.\nDiscussion\nIn this cross-sectional study of 19 patients with CKD on\nlong-standing ACEi or ARB therapy with well-controlled\nPBP, we found no evidence that aldosterone breakthrough,\nmanifest in one-third of the study population, was associ-\nated with elevations in any CBP parameters. The absence\nof correlation between aldosterone breakthrough and cen-\ntral hemodynamics in our cross-sectional study suggests\nthat aldosterone's non-genomic effects, especially its\nupregulation of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic path-\nways, are likely responsible for the pathophysiology asso-\nciated with aldosterone breakthrough.\nAldosterone's effects on fibrosis and inflammation are\nwell documented: transforming growth factor-beta\n(TGF-b)- and Type I collagen expression are increased in\nrats with chronically elevated aldosterone levels,25 aldos-\nterone induces superoxide production,26 as well as apopto-\nsis through free radical production,27 while spironolactone\nreduces glomerulosclerosis in rat models.12 These mecha-\nnisms are believed to underlie aldosterone's deleterious\neffects on left ventricular function and GFR. The absence\nof any hemodynamic alteration associated with aldoster-\none breakthrough, either in PBP as documented in prior\nstudies,4,10,15 or in CBP as presented here, suggests that the\npathophysiology of aldosterone breakthrough is driven\nprimarily by its pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic effects.\nOn first pass, it would seem surprising that there is no\neffect on central hemodynamics from aldosterone break-\nthrough, especially in light of the differential effect of\nRAAS inhibition on central hemodynamics: ACEi/ARB\nhave been shown to reduce CBP to a greater degree than\nPBP17,28 and, in general, vasodilators inclusive of calcium\nchannel blockers and alpha-blockers are more potent at\nreducing central pressures when compared to non-vasodi-\nlators.29 But it should be borne in mind that aldosterone\nTable 1.

Central hemodynamics in aldosterone breakthrough.\nAI: augmentation index; AP: augmentation pressure; CBP: central blood\npressure; CPP: central pulse pressure.\n4 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System\nlevels in aldosterone breakthrough are not a function of\nATII activity and do not correlate with upregulated RAAS\npathway activation. In a study of 34 patients with CHF on\nmaximal recommended doses of ACEi, aldosterone break-\nthrough occurred despite maximal ACE inhibition as con-\nfirmed by measurement of ATII/ATI ratios,5 and the\nproportion of individuals experiencing aldosterone break-\nthrough remained the same whether on either ACEi or\nARB alone or on combined ACEi/ARB therapy.30 Since\nelevated aldosterone levels in aldosterone breakthrough\nare independent of ATII and its effect on vasoconstriction,\nit could be reasonably expected that central hemodynam-\nics remain unchanged following aldosterone breakthrough\nas seen in this study.\nOur study is notable for being the first to examine the\nimpact of aldosterone breakthrough on CBP. In addition,\nthis study and its CKD subject population provide inter-\nesting new data for the field of breakthrough. We report\nhere a 32% prevalence of aldosterone breakthrough in\npatients with CKD on ACEi or ARB therapy, using a\nvery conservative definition of breakthrough, but also\nfound that those with breakthrough had significantly\nworse kidney function compared to those without break-\nthrough. Reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate\n(eGFR) has previously been shown in a multivariate\nregression analysis to be predictive of the likelihood of\naldosterone breakthrough in a longitudinal study of\npatients with diabetic nephropathy, mean eGFR=45, and\nmacroalbuminuria.31 Our data likewise may suggest that\nreduced glomerular filtration or impaired renal handling\nof sodium, potassium, or the hormones of the RAAS in\nCKD could predispose individuals to aldosterone break-\nthrough. Although elevated Cr has in turn been corre-\nlated with increased CPP,21 our data show no such\nevidence of statistically significant differences in CPP\nbetween the groups.\nLimitations to our study include its inability to assess\ncausality given its cross-sectional design. The study's\nsmall size additionally may leave it underpowered to\nassess for statistically significant differences in hemody-\nnamic parameters between individuals with and without\naldosterone breakthrough. Finally, given the unequal gen-\nder and race distribution of the participants in our cohort,\nfurther study is necessary before these data can be applied\nto the population as a whole.\nIn conclusion, we show here that aldosterone break-\nthrough, in a cohort of CKD patients with well-controlled\nPBP, occurs in approximately one-third of patients on\nlong-standing ACEi or ARB therapy. We detected signifi-\ncantly worse renal function in those who demonstrated\nbreakthrough compared to those who did not. However,\nwe demonstrated no differences in CBP parameters\nbetween these groups, suggesting that aldosterone break-\nthrough does not appear to mediate an effect via the hor-\nmone's classical, epithelial actions.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.\nFunding\nThis project was funded with departmental resources from the\nDivision of Nephrology at Columbia University Medical Center\nReferences\n1.
