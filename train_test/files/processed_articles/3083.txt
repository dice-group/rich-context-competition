With a rapid extension of\nlife expectancy, the number of elderly people suffering from\ndementing illnesses is escalating. Cognitive impairment and\nmental diseases are among the most common morbid con-\nditions in later life.

Life expectancy without dementia or dementia-free\nlife expectancy (DemFLE) is defined as the average number of years a person\nis expected to live without dementia. Total life expectancy is equal to the sum of\nDemFLE and life expectancy with dementia. Estimations of DemFLE were based\non mortality data and incidence of dementia, using double-decrement life tables.\nResults Between the first and second cohorts, all-cause mortality rates declined, while\nthe incidence of dementia remained constant in both men and women. Among\nthe males, total life expectancy increased at a higher rate than DemFLE. Con-\nsequently, the duration of life with dementia was extended in the second cohort.\nConversely, among the females DemFLE increased at a higher rate than total life\nexpectancy, thus the duration of life with dementia decreased in the second cohort.\nThe median age of dementia onset was postponed by 2\u00ad3 years in the second\ncohort for females, and did not show any specific difference between the two\ncohorts in males.\nConclusion The trends of health expectancies suggest an extension of the duration of life\nwith dementia for males and a compression of dementia for females.

At an extreme limit, life\nexpectancy increases while healthy expectancy remains the\nsame; this figure leads to `the pandemic of mental disorders and\nchronic diseases'.11 Second, a more optimistic concept implies\na stagnation in life expectancy concomitant with an increase of\nhealthy expectancy; this theory is known as `the compression of\nmorbidity'.12,13 The third pattern, called `dynamic equilibrium',\ndescribes a stability of morbidity and health status levels, thus life\nexpectancy and healthy expectancy increase at the same rate.14\nDementia-free life expectancy (DemFLE) is defined as the\naverage number of years an individual at a given age is expected\nto live without dementia. This estimation is based on mortality\ndata and on the prevalence or incidence of dementia. To date,\nDemFLE has been estimated for European countries, Australia\nand Japan.15\u00ad20 In no previous studies has DemFLE been\nmeasured on similar populations at different periods. Thus, it\nis still unknown whether an increased life expectancy is asso-\nciated with an extension or a compression of the duration to be\nlived with dementia.\nIn the study reported here, data were derived from two\nchronological cohorts of subjects aged 65 years. These subjects\nwere all members of the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Pro-\ngram of Northern California (KPMCP-NC), one of the largest\nprepaid health maintenance organizations in the US.21 The\nKPMCP-NC provides comprehensive medical services to more\nthan two million members of all ages. In order to analyse trends\nin life expectancies free of dementia, two cohorts of approximately\n3000 elderly subjects each were followed for 9 years. For both\ndementia were recorded. Identical study designs and methods\nwere applied to each cohort. Estimations of DemFLE were based\non mortality and the incidence of dementia during the follow-\nup period.\nThe objective of the study is to examine the changes over\ntime of DemFLE among two populations of elderly Americans\nmembers of the KPMCP-NC, and to observe whether an increase\nin longevity is accompanied by an increase in the duration to be\nspent with dementia, i.e. a `longer life associated with worsen-\nMethod\nData collection\nThe study design has been published elsewhere.23 In brief, the\ndata were derived from medical records of two cohorts of elderly\nAmericans who were members of the KPMCP-NC between\nselection was stratified to attain equal numbers of observations\n70\u00ad79, 80 years. Outpatient records of the study subjects were\nabstracted for 9 years from the baseline year (January 1971 and\nA mortality search was performed using the California Auto-\nmated Mortality Linkage (CAMLIS). The CAMLIS uses vital\nstatistics tapes obtained from the California Department of Health\nServices to produce a weighted value that reflects the level\nof probability that a subject's death and vital statistics match.\nAll borderline values were reviewed individually to determine\nwhether the match was correct. During the follow-up period,\nonset of dementia, death, or withdrawal were recorded. In the\ndrew from the membership of KPMCP-NC before the end of the\nfollow-up period. Comparison of the withdrawal populations\nin the two cohorts did not show any significant differences in\nterms of sex, age, race, and education level.\nCalculation of incidence of dementia and mortality\nIncident cases of dementia were identified by chart review. The\nKPMCP-NC did not perform a screening programme to detect\ndementia. In order to be diagnosed as having dementia, patients\nhad to visit clinics. Under these circumstances, less severe cases\nof dementia or cases referred directly to a nursing home could\nhave been missed, and thus the number of cases could be under-\nestimated. Diagnosis was made by a primary care physician\nwhen the person visited the KPMCP-NC and, in most cases, was\nconfirmed by a neurologist. Dementia was diagnosed according\nto the International Classification of Diseases-9th revision (ICD-9)\ncriteria. Incident cases of dementia were defined as those\ndiagnosed after the baseline date. Severity of dementia was not\nconsidered in this study since such information was not avail-\nable for some cases.\nCases of dementia present at or before baseline were con-\nsidered as prevalent cases. Prevalent dementia was identified by\nreviewing the medical charts for 4 years before the beginning of\nprevalent cases of dementia were identified and excluded from\nThe age- and sex-specific incidence rates of dementia and the\nage- and sex-specific mortality rates during the follow-up period\nwere calculated with the person-years method.

The probabilities were estimated for each year\nof age and each sex.\nBecause the observed probabilities were somewhat unsteady\ndue to a smaller sample size at higher ages, a smoothing method\nwith logistic regression was used. In this method, the observed\nage-specific probabilities were fit to the exponential function:\nMx = e( +  ln x)\nwhere Mx represents the predicted probability at age x,  and\n the regression coefficients, and ln x the natural logarithm of\nage x. In the data presented here, all regression coefficients\nwere significant (P  0.001) and R2 of each model was between\nThe DemFLE corresponds to the number of years a person\ncan expect to live without dementia.

The association\nbetween dementia onset and potential risk factors of dementia\nwas examined using the Cox proportional hazards regression\nmodel. The dependent variable was the number of years from\ndevelopment of dementia. Independent variables included age,\nsex, education level, smoking status, and prevalence of specific\nmedical conditions, respectively.\nResults\nTable 1 presents the characteristics of the study subjects accord-\ning to the cohort.

Conversely, for females, with a faster progression\nrate of DemFLE compared to TLE, the %DemFLE improved and\nthe duration with dementia decreased in the second cohort.\nBefore interpreting the findings, we should point out the three\nmajor limitations of this study. First, while the two cohorts were\nsimilar in terms of sex and age distribution, education level and\nfrequency of outpatient visits, they differed in terms of race. The\nsecond cohort included less White subjects but more Black\nelderly. Differences in the dementia prevalence due to race are\ncontroversial. One study has reported a higher prevalence of\ndementia among Blacks,25 while two others showed no differ-\nence.26,27 Studies on race and incidence of dementia are scarce.\nThe present report is consistent with a recent survey which\nfound no significant difference in the incidence of dementia\nbetween the two races.27 Consequently, we may assume that\nthe difference in the race distribution between the 1971 and the\n1980 cohorts has not biased the comparison over time of the\nSecond, in the KPMCP-NC, the mental status of the members\nwas not routinely screened. The members had to visit the clinics\nin order to receive a dementia diagnosis. Some patients would\nbe unable or reluctant to visit when their mental status declined;\nalso, some cases would have been referred directly to nursing\nhomes or kept at home without a diagnostic evaluation. Under\nthese circumstances, some of the dementia cases would have\nbeen missed and, therefore, the incidence rate may have been\nunderestimated. As we will describe later, however, the incid-\nence of dementia in the populations we studied was consistent\nwith those of two previous population-based studies among\nThird, the attitude of both physicians and patients to dementia\nhas changed over the decades; consequently, these changes may\nhave affected the estimate of the rate of incidence of dementia.\nDiagnostic practices have varied between the 1970s and the\nestablished internationally and the definition of senile dementia\nappeared in DSM-III and ICD-9.30 Moreover, the development\nof standardized diagnostic interviews and mental examinations\nhas improved the detection of dementing illnesses. The use of\ncomputer tomography scans and other imaging tools has in-\ncreased dramatically between the two cohorts.23 Improvements\nin the detection of Alzheimer's dementia are reflected in the\ndementia distribution among each cohort.31 Moreover, physicians\nhave become more inclined to tell the patient and his/her\nfamily the true diagnosis. In addition, families of demented\nelderly patients are more aware of dementing illnesses, and seek\ngreater medical and social support. These changes in physicians'\nand patients' attitudes may have resulted in increased number\nof diagnosis of dementia. However, the present data showed\nthat the incidence of dementia did not change throughout the\nThe strength of the present study lies in the utilization of the\nsame method among comparable populations. The calculation\ninto consideration the incidence of dementia and mortality at\nthe same time.\nThe incidence of dementia in these two cohorts was consist-\nent with the results of two previous reports of population-based\nstudies in the US. Both studies showed higher incidence rate with\nolder age. In the Rochester study, incidence rates increased from\nfor the elderly aged 80 years.29 In the Framingham study, the\nrates were lower than in the present report because the severity\nof dementia was restricted to moderate and severe cases.28\nBetween the first and the second cohorts, mortality decreased,\nespecially among the males, while the incidence of dementia\nremained constant among both genders. Trends of increase in\nTLE and DemFLE were quite different between the two sexes.\nFor males, although both TLE and DemFLE increased, the degree\nof increase was more remarkable in the former than in the latter.\nAs a result, the duration to be spent with dementia or DemLE\nwas prolonged and an extension of morbidity took place among\nthe males. For females at younger ages, DemFLE increased by\nabout one year under the relatively constant TLE. Thus, com-\npression of morbidity was observed among females under 80\nyears of age. Women in their eighties presented a plateau in\nDemFLE; while women aged 85 years and over showed a\ndecrease in both TLE and DemFLE, supporting an equilibrium.\nHowever, estimations for the oldest ages should be considered\nwith the utmost caution since the probabilities of death and\ndementia in the life table were predicted by a logistic regression\nmodel according to the relationship between these events and\nage. The discrepancy between the actual value and the pre-\ndicted value increases with age, thus the estimate becomes less\nreliable at older ages.\nThe results of the present study indicate that, especially among\nfemales, DemFLE has grown in spite of a constant incidence rate\nof dementia. This fact could be explained by a postponement\nof dementia onset. In order to corroborate this trend, we have\ncalculated the median age of dementia onset for each year of\nfollow-up and have compared the results between both cohorts.\nMales did not show any specific trend but the median age of\ndementia onset was postponed by 2\u00ad3 years among females\nin the second cohort. The compression of morbidity among\nfemales was confirmed by the postponement of the median age\nA previous report on the same population has shown\ndecreased incidence rates of stroke for females in the second\ncohort; while males up to 75 years of age presented increased\nrates.23 A decreased incidence rate of stroke, one of the risk\nfactors for vascular dementia, may account for a later onset of\ndementia and partly explain the sex difference observed.\nThe gender difference in the trends of DemFLE suggests to\nus that sex-related factors may account for the risk and pre-\nvention of dementia. According to previous studies, oestrogen\nuse by post-menopausal women may postpone and decrease\nthe risk of Alzheimer's dementia.32,33 However, the use of oestro-\ngen in these two age/time cohorts is low. Moreover, the effect\nof oestrogen replacement therapy on the risk of Alzheimer's\ndisease needs to be fully explored, since the results are still\nIn line with previous studies on active life expectancy which\nreported a pandemic of disabilities,36,37 the present report shows,\ndespite a stable incidence of dementia within a decade, a similar\ntrend for dementia among men (i.e. an extension of the\nduration of life spent with dementia). A less pessimistic trend is\nobserved among women, supporting a compression of dementia\nassociated with a constant dementia incidence. The results\nsuggest that in women of the present cohorts, the onset of\ndementia is delayed, although it is not fully prevented.\n"
