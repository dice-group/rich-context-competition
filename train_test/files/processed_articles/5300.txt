Osteoporosis has been\nrecognized as a serious consequence of\nendogenous hypercortisolism since the first\nThe reported prevalence of osteoporosis\ndue to excess endogenous cortisol ranges\ntures, particularly in the vertebral spine,\ncan be the presenting manifestation of\nhypercortisolism.4,5 The proposed mecha-\nnism by which excess glucocorticoid leads\nto the development of secondary osteopo-\nrosis is multifactorial. Early identification\nof the characteristic changes in bone mass\nwith hypercortisolism assists with early\nidentification of bone mass loss and timely\ntreatment, thus reducing the occurrence of\nadverse events such as fractures.\nThe current study was performed\nto compare the characteristics of the\nbone mineral density (BMD) and bone me-\ntabolism in patients with ACTH-dependent\nor ACTH-independent hypercortisolism\nversus healthy controls and to analyze the\neffects of ACTH on BMD in patients with\nadrenal-dependent Cushing's syndrome\n(ACS) and Cushing's disease (CD).\nMaterials and methods\nPatients\nWe retrospectively analyzed data for\n78 patients with hypercortisolism, including\n52 patients with CD and 26 patients with\nACS. All patients had signs and symptoms\nof overt hypercortisolism.\nPatients were excluded from the study if\nthey had subclinical Cushing's syndrome,\nforms of hypercortisolism other than CD\nand ACS (e.g., ectopic ACTH syndrome,\nadrenocortical hyperplasia, or adrenocortical\ncarcinoma), recurring diseases, or comorbid\ndiabetes mellitus prior to admission. Finally,\nwere included in this study. Data for 18\nhealthy controls were collected from the\nphysical examination center of the Tianjin\nMedical University General Hospital.\nCushing's syndrome was diagnosed\nbased on clinical features and the following\nendocrine work-up: measurement of serum\ncortisol (UFC) excretion, evaluated as the\nmean value of three different samples col-\nlected on consecutive days; an overnight\nlow-dose dexamethasone suppression test\n(2 mg/d administered orally, with measure-\nment of urine cortisol the following day)\nand overnight high-dose dexamethasone\nsuppression test (8 mg/d administered\norally, with measurement of urine cortisol\nthe following day); and findings of a space-\noccupying lesion on adrenal computed\ntomography or pituitary magnetic reso-\nnance imaging. All healthy controls were\nconfirmed healthy based on their clinical\nhistory, physical examination findings, and\nroutine laboratory test results. The patients\nand controls were matched in terms of sex,\nage, body mass index (BMI), ethnicity, and\ngeographic origin.\nThe exclusion criteria for all patients and\nhealthy controls in this study were pregnan-\ncy, alcoholism, smoking, chronic disease,\nand previous or current exposure to drugs\naffecting the pituitary-adrenal axis or bone\nmetabolism.\nBiochemical evaluation\nIn all patients and healthy controls, blood\nsamples were obtained in a fasting state,\nand calcium, phosphorus, alanine amino-\ntransferase, creatinine, total cholesterol,\nand triglycerides in the plasma samples\nwas measured using standard enzymatic\nBiochemistry Analyzer; Hitachi, Tokyo,\nJapan). Serum thyroid hormones (free triio-\ndothyronine, free thyroxine, and thyroid\nstimulating hormone), gonadal hormones\n(testosterone and estrogen), adrenal cortex\nfunction (serum adrenocorticotropic hor-\nmone and cortisol), parathyroid hormone\n(PTH), and 24-h excretion of UFC were\nmeasured using chemiluminescent methods\n(Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Inc.,\nErlangen, Germany). The 25(OH)D3\nlevel\nin the plasma samples was measured\nusing an enzyme-linked immunosorbent\nassay (Immunodiagnostic Systems Ltd.,\nThe Boldons, UK). Serum bone turnover\nmarkers (serum osteocalcin [OC], procolla-\ngen type I N-terminal propeptide [PINP],\nand serum collagen type I cross-linked\nC-telopeptide [CTX]) were measured\nusing a chemiluminescent method (Roche\nDiagnostics Ltd., Mannheim, Germany).\nUrinary calcium was measured using a col-\norimetric method (Roche Diagnostics Ltd.).\nThis study was conducted in accordance\nwith the principles of good clinical practice\nand the Declaration of Helsinki and was\napproved by the ethics committee of the\nTianjin Medical University General\nHospital. All participants provided written\ninformed consent.\nAssessment of BMD\nBone densitometry was performed by dual-\nenergy X-ray absorptiometry using a\nProdigy-GE densitometer (GE Healthcare,\nChicago, IL, USA). The coefficient of var-\niation of the BMD measurements in our\nlaboratory was <0.1%. Data were analyzed\nusing absolute BMD values (g/cm2).\nStatistical analysis\nSPSS v19.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY)\nwas used for data analysis. All data were\ntested for a normal distribution. Normally\ndistributed data are reported as mean\n\u00c6 standard deviation. Statistical analyses\nwere performed using analysis of variance\nfor multiple-group comparisons among the\nACS, CD, and control (N) groups, and\nthe Student\u00adNewman\u00adKeuls test was used\nfor comparisons between two groups. The\nchi-square test was used for count data.\nCorrelations were tested using Pearson's\ntest. Linear regression analysis was used\nfor further correlation testing. Binary logis-\ntic regression analysis was used to compare\nthe correlations of categorical variables.\nStatistical significance was set at P < 0.05.\nResults\nPatient characteristics\nThis study included 21 patients with ACS,\n34 patients with CD, and 18 healthy con-\ntrols. Age, BMI, estimated disease dura-\ntion, renal function, blood glucose\nconcentrations, blood lipid concentrations,\nand thyroid hormone concentrations were\nnot significantly different among the ACS,\nCD, and N groups (Tables 1 and 2). The\nACS, CD, and N groups contained one,\ntwo, and one postmenopausal women and\ntwo, nine, and five men, respectively. The\nnumbers of postmenopausal vs. non-\npostmenopausal women and men vs.\nwomen were not significantly different\namong the three groups as shown by the\nchi-square test. The patients with hypercor-\ntisolism were divided into two groups\naccording to their gonadal status (those\nwith hypogonadism and those with\nnormal gonads). Sex, BMD, and age were\ntaken as independent variables.

The urinary cortisol concentration\nin the ACS group was significantly higher\nTable 4.

In the\npresent study, the patients with hypercortis-\nolism were divided into a hypogonadism\ngroup and a normal gonads group, and\nthe binary logistic regression analysis\nshowed that lumbar BMD and gonad func-\ntion had no correlation. Therefore, we\ndo not believe that sex hormones were a\nconfounding factor affecting bone density\nin this study.\nOsteoporosis is one of the most impor-\ntant clinical consequences of hypercortiso-\nlism. In the present study, the lumbar,\nfemoral, and whole-body BMDs were sig-\nnificantly lower in patients with ACS and\nCD than in the healthy controls, similar\nto a previous study.6 The differences in\nthe location and degree of decreased BMD\nshowed a trend that followed the underly-\ning cause of hypercortisolism, while a pre-\nvious study showed that patients with ACS\nhad significantly greater loss of bone mass\nthan did patients with CD.7 Patients with\nACS had poorer BMD in the lumbar\nregion than did patients with CD in the\npresent study, while femoral BMD was sim-\nilar between the two groups. The lumbar\nvertebrae contain more cancellous bone\n(trabecular bone) than do the femurs; there-\nfore, the lumbar vertebrae are more vulner-\nable to endogenous glucocorticoid\ndamage.8 This is one possible reason for\nthe differences among the various regions\nof BMD in patients with hypercortisolism,\nbut further studies on this topic are needed.\nThere were some differences in the\nbiochemical markers of bone metabolism\nbetween patients with hypercortisolism\nand healthy controls. In the present\nstudy, the serum calcium and phosphorus\nconcentrations were significantly lower in\nthe patients with ACS or CD than in the\nhealthy controls. The serum calcium that\nwe examined was the total serum calcium,\nwhich comprises both free calcium and\nprotein-bound calcium, and the level of\nprotein-bound calcium varies as does the\nlevel of serum albumin. Affected by the\nhigher levels of cortisol, the serum albumin\nconcentration in patients with hypercortis-\nolism is lower than that in healthy people;\ntherefore, the serum calcium concentration\ncorrected by albumin was not significantly\ndifferent among the groups in the present\nstudy. In patients with hypercortisolism,\nthe serum ALP concentration is slightly\nFigure 5. Correlation between adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) concentrations and lumbar\nbone mineral density (BMD) in patients with adrenal-dependent Cushing's syndrome (ACS) or Cushing's\ndisease (CD)\nhigher than that in healthy people; but the\nconcentration was not significantly different\namong the groups in this study. The ALP\nthat we measured was the total ALP, not\none of the bone isoenzymes of ALP.\nThe serum PTH concentration was signif-\nicantly higher in the patients with ACS or\nCD than in the healthy controls; similarly,\nhigher PTH concentrations were previously\ndetected in patients with hypercortisolism\nthan in healthy controls, and the authors\nsuggested that this reflected active bone re-\nsorption and secondary hyperparathyroid-\nism.9 Meng et al.10 showed that urinary\ncalcium excretion was higher in patients\nwith hypercortisolism and that hypercalciu-\nria might decrease the serum calcium. Thus,\nthe parathyroid glands were stimulated and\nthe PTH secretion increased. Excess PTH\nstimulates bone resorption. Rozhinskaia\net al.11 reported that secondary hyperpara-\nthyroidism was found in 25% of patients\nwith hypercortisolism.\nOf the bone turnover markers, OC is the\nmost abundant in the bone matrix and is\nproduced late in the bone formation pro-\ncess. It is synthesized by mature osteoblasts\nand then mixed into the bone matrix. Only\na small fraction enters the circulation.\nIts function is not clear; it might affect\nbone mineralization and play a negative\nfeedback role during bone remodeling. OC\nincreases with bone absorption by osteo-\nclasts; therefore, the OC concentration\nmight reflect not only the reactionary state\nof bone formation but also the comprehen-\nsive state of bone transformation. CTX, a\nbone resorption marker, is a product of the\ncleavage of type I collagen due to osteoclast\nactivity. PINP, a bone formation marker, is\na metabolite of the pyrolysis of total type I\ntropocollagen (synthesized and secreted by\nosteoblasts) under the action of polypepti-\ndase. Its serum concentration reflects the\nability of osteoblasts to synthesize collagen.\nThe serum OC and PINP concentrations in\npatients with hypercortisolism are lower\nand the CTX concentrations are higher\nthan those in healthy people, suggesting\nthat bone formation is suppressed and\nbone resorption is increased in hypercortis-\nolism. The bone marker concentrations in\nthe present study suggested significantly\ngreater suppression of bone formation and\nbone resorption in the patients with ACS\nthan in the patients with CD, which is sup-\nported by the lower lumbar BMD in\npatients with ACS than in those with CD.\nO'Brien et al.12 suggested that glucocorti-\ncoids directly or indirectly accelerate\napoptosis of osteoblasts and osteocytes\nand reduce osteoclast apoptosis, causing\nloss of bone mass. Recent studies have\nrevealed obviously lower OC concentra-\ntions in patients with hypercortisolism\nthan in healthy people; the concentrations\nquickly recovered postoperatively, reaching\nRegarding factors associated with BMD,\nthere was a significant correlation between\nthe ACTH concentration and lumbar BMD\nin the patients with CD; therefore, ACTH\ncould potentially have a protective effect on\nlumbar BMD. However, the same relation-\nship was not detected for the femoral neck\nand whole-body BMDs. ACTH reportedly\nstimulates proliferation of osteoblasts and\nincreases collagen I mRNA in the osteo-\nbinds to a specific member of the melano-\ncortin receptor family, MC2R, which is\nexpressed in osteoblastic cells in vivo and\nthen promotes osteoblast proliferation.\nIn vitro exposure of bone marrow stromal\ncells to ACTH and leptin promotes osteo-\nblast differentiation by increased gene\nexpression of osterix and collagen type I\nalpha.17 Furthermore, ACTH might stimu-\nlate proliferation of osteoblasts in a dose-\ndependent manner; i.e., ACTH at 10 nM\nstimulates proliferation, while lower\nACTH concentrations might oppose osteo-\nblast differentiation.15,16 In the present\nstudy, ACTH was not associated with\nlumbar BMD in the patients with ACS, in-\ndicating that ACTH might not have a pro-\ntective effect on lumbar BMD in patients\nwith ACS; this finding might have been re-\nlated to the low ACTH concentration in\nthis group. ACTH might have a protective\neffect on bone; however, it is not sufficient\nto act against the adverse effects of high\ncortisol levels on bone metabolism in\npatients with CD.\nConclusions\nLong-term exposure to excess glucocorti-\ncoids in patients with hypercortisolism\nresults in bone loss, with loss of lumbar\nbone occurring earlier and more extensive-\nly. To enable early identification and timely\nintervention for bone loss, BMD examina-\ntions should be prioritized to prevent frac-\ntures. At the same time, it is important to\nconduct imaging of the vertebrae for early\nidentification of fractures. Measurement of\nbone turnover markers (PTH, OC, CTX,\nand PINP) might help with early assessment\nof the influence of hypercortisolism on bone\nquality. ACTH might have a protective\neffect on bone; however, it is not sufficient\nto act against the adverse effects of high\ncortisol levels on bone metabolism.\nBecause of the limited sample size and ret-\nrospective design in the present study, the\neffect of endogenous hypercortisolism on\nbone mass should be examined in a larger\nprospective cohort of patients.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or\nnot-for-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
