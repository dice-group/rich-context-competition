Respondents with asthma or nonasthmatic\nchronic illness (cancer, diabetes mellitus, or epilepsy) were\ncompared with individuals without these conditions.\nMain Outcome Measures: Self-report of high school\ngraduation, ever having employment, currently having\nemployment, living with a parent/guardian, and ever re-\nceiving public assistance.\nResults: Three percent of young adults had nonasth-\nmatic chronic illness (cancer, diabetes, or epilepsy), and\n16.0% had asthma. Most young adults with chronic ill-\nness graduated high school (81.3%) and currently had em-\nployment(60.4%).However,comparedwithhealthyyoung\nadults, those with nonasthmatic chronic illness were sig-\nnificantly less likely to graduate high school, ever have had\nemployment,orcurrentlyhaveemploymentandweremore\nlikely to receive public assistance.

The inclusion\nof seasonal allergies or asthma of uncertain severity with\nmore serious conditions reflects a noncategorical ap-\nproach to childhood chronic illness, which is based on\nthe assumption that the effects of chronic illness are simi-\nlar across disease categories. The noncategorical ap-\nproach is well accepted; however, analytically combin-\ning common conditions with varying levels of severity,\nsuch as asthma and seasonal allergies, with more severe\nconditions may obscure the effects of more severe child-\nThis study examines 4 young adult outcomes that may\nbe associated with childhood chronic illness in partici-\npants in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent\nHealth (Add Health), a nationally representative US\nsample. We consider the following outcomes: high school\ngraduation, employment history, current living situa-\ntion, and receipt of public assistance. Based on previous\nliterature, we hypothesize that young adults with chronic\nillness other than asthma have lower rates of high school\ngraduation and employment and are more likely to live\nwith their parent/guardian and to receive financial sup-\nport from public programs. We also expect that young\nadults who report having asthma (severity not known)\nhave outcomes similar to those of young adults without\nchronic illness because much of this group will likely have\nmild asthma.\nMETHODS\nDATA\nWe used data from waves I and III of the Add Health contrac-\ntual data set. Add Health is a nationally representative sample\nlescents in 132 schools participated in the wave I in-school sur-\nyear. Wave III follow-up interviews (n=15 170) were con-\nresponse rate. As previously reported,17 total bias related to at-\ntrition is low (1%). More information regarding sampling pro-\ncedures and study design can be found elsewhere.18 Inclusion\ncriteria for the present analysis were participation in waves I\nand III (n=14 322) and complete data on all variables of inter-\nest (n=13 236). Data regarding socioeconomic status and race/\nethnicity are drawn from wave I; the remainder of the mea-\nsures are based on wave III.\nMEASURES\nChronic Illness\nAt wave III, when respondents were aged 18 to 28 years, re-\nspondents were asked whether they had ever been diagnosed\nas having asthma, cancer, diabetes mellitus, or epilepsy; no other\nchildhood chronic illnesses were asked about in the survey. Re-\nspondents who reported having asthma only were included in\nthe asthma group; respondents who reported at least 1 of the\nother illnesses (regardless of whether they also had asthma) were\nincluded in the nonasthmatic chronic illness group. All other\nrespondents were included in the healthy (no chronic illness)\ngroup. It was not possible to separate those with mild asthma\nfromthosewithmoresevereasthma,sothisheterogeneousgroup\nwas treated as a separate group. For analysis, dummy vari-\nables were created to indicate asthma, nonasthmatic chronic\nillness, and healthy (reference). A dichotomous variable was\nalso created to compare the healthy group with participants with\nany chronic illness, including asthma.\nYoung Adult Outcomes\nRespondents were coded as high school graduates (1) if they\nreported having a high school diploma or a GED (general equiva-\nlency diploma) and as not high school graduates (0) if they had\nneither. We included 2 indicators of vocational status: ever hav-\ning had full- or part-time employment and having current full-\nor part-time employment. Each was coded as a dichotomous\nvariable (1=yes and 0=no).\nSeveraldichotomouseconomicoutcomeswereexamined:cur-\nrently receiving support in the form of food stamps from the\nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and cur-\nrently receiving disability insurance/workers' compensation/\nunemployment benefits or SSI (1=yes and 0=no). In addition,\nlivingsituationwasassessedbasedonahouseholdrosterbygroup-\ning respondents who currently lived with a parent/guardian (1)\nseparately from those in other living situations (0).\nControl Variables\nAll analyses included controls for factors that could indepen-\ndently contribute to young adult outcomes: socioeconomic sta-\ntus of family of origin, race/ethnicity, sex, and age. Socioeco-\nnomic status was based on highest educational level for either\nparent/guardian as reported by the child/adolescent at wave I;\ndummy variables were created to code for less than high school,\nhigh school graduate, some college, college graduate, and school-\ning beyond college, with less than high school as the reference\ncategory. Race/ethnicity was based on wave I self-report and\nwas divided into non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, His-\npanic, and other, with non-Hispanic white as the reference cat-\negory. Age at wave III was kept as a continuous variable. Sex\nwas coded as male (0) or female (1).\nData Analysis\nBivariate associations between outcome variables and illness\nstatus were examined first across all 3 groups and then be-\ntween groups using the 2 test. Multivariable Poisson regres-\nsion was used to calculate risk ratios for dichotomous out-\ncomes, controlling for sex, age, race/ethnicity, and parent/\nguardian educational level.19 Multivariate analyses were\nconducted in multiple steps. In model 1, the nonasthmatic\nchronic illness and asthma groups were each compared sepa-\nrately with the healthy group. In model 2, the nonasthmatic\nchronic illness group was compared with the asthma group.\nAnalyses were conducted using statistical software (Stata ver-\nsion 11.0; StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas). Both models\nadjusted for the clustered, stratified survey design, and sample\nweights were applied to generate national population propor-\ntional estimates.\n\u00a92011 American Medical Association.

Based on 2 tests, all socio-\ndemographic characteristics were significantly associ-\nated with illness category (results not shown).\nTable 2 displays bivariate associations between illness\ngroups and young adult outcomes, with significance test-\ning across all 3 groups shown. All outcomes, except liv-\ning with a parent/guardian, were associated with illness\ncategory. Young adults with nonasthmatic chronic ill-\nness had the lowest rates of high school graduation, ever\nhaving had employment, and currently having employ-\nment and the highest rates of receiving financial sup-\nport from SNAP and SSI or disability insurance. The\nasthma group, compared with the healthy group, had\nslightly lower rates of currently having employment and\nliving with a parent/guardian and slightly higher rates of\never having had employment and receiving support from\nSNAP and SSI or disability insurance (Table 2).\nIn Table 3, we provide 2 models. The first model com-\npares the asthma group and the nonasthmatic chronic\nillness group with the healthy group. The second model\ncomparestheasthmagroupwiththenonasthmaticchronic\nillness group. The lower part of Table 3 displays asso-\nciations between control variables and young adult out-\ncomes as estimated in model 1. For model 1 there were\nsignificant differences between young adults with non-\nasthmatic chronic illness and their healthy peers for all\noutcomes except living with a parent/guardian. Young\nadults with nonasthmatic chronic illness were less likely\nto graduate from high school, to ever have had employ-\nment, and to currently have employment and more likely\nto receive SNAP support and SSI/disability insurance\n(Table 3). There were no differences on any of the young\nadult outcomes between those individuals with asthma\nand their healthy peers except that those with asthma were\nless likely to live with their parent/guardian.\nModel 2 shows that the nonasthmatic chronic illness\ngroup was significantly different from the asthma group\non all outcome variables. The nonasthmatic chronic ill-\nness group was less likely to have graduated high school,\nto ever have had employment, and to currently have em-\nployment and more likely to receive support from SNAP,\nto receive SSI/disability insurance, and to live with a par-\nent/guardian (Table 3).\nCOMMENT\nAt the time of interview, most young adults with the child-\nhood chronic illnesses assessed in this sample (cancer,\nTable 1.

However, compared with their healthy peers,\nthis group of young adults had poorer educational, vo-\ncational, and financial outcomes. These findings are con-\nsistent with other research and confirm in a nationally\nrepresentative US sample the negative association be-\ntween childhood chronic illness and important young\nadult outcomes. For example, the consequences of young\nadults with chronic illness not graduating high school\nhas real-world significance because adults without a high\nschool diploma earn approximately $7000 less per year\nthan do those with a high school diploma.20\nAsthma is the most prevalent chronic illness of child-\nhood, and young adults with moderate to severe asthma\nfrequently have unmet health needs and require ongo-\ning medical care.21,22 However, studies that include asthma\nor seasonal allergies in the chronic illness group with-\nout considering severity may be underestimating the effect\nof chronic illness on young adult outcomes. Studies based\non samples with large proportions of young adults with\nasthma or allergies that do not take severity into ac-\ncount show less effect of chronic illness on educational\noutcomes compared with studies that exclude those with\nmild severity.9 Conversely, a Finnish case-control study\nthat included only moderate to severe asthma in the\nchronic illness group showed lower educational attain-\nment and employment.7 The present findings from the\nanalysis of US young adults with chronic illness are con-\nsistent in demonstrating the need to distinguish asthma\nseverity levels. In studies with fewer participants, smaller\ndifferences that occur when asthma severity groups are\ncombined might not be detected; hence, including asthma\nwithout considering severity may lead to an optimistic\nbias regarding the young adult outcomes of those grow-\ning up with childhood chronic illness.\nThe noncategorical model for examining chronic ill-\nness is a valuable way of examining the outcomes of child-\nhood chronic illness because there is a plausible com-\nmonpathwaybetweenhavingsignificantchildhoodchronic\nillness and impaired young adult outcomes.1,15 There are\nmultiple mechanisms by which children with chronic ill-\nness might struggle to become successful young adults,\nincluding educational problems related to missing school,\npsychological distress related to health problems, and fam-\nily stress related to parental/guardian anxiety regarding a\nchild's health or finances.2,23-25 The exact mechanisms are\nnotyetknownandmaydifferbasedongenericanddisease-\nspecific characteristics. The present findings suggest that\nTable 3.

The 2002\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics policy statement on\nhealth care transitions acknowledges the role of physi-\ncians in facilitating such transitions and notes the im-\nportance of a close relationship between physician and\npatient.26 To promote the broader success of children\ngrowing up with chronic medical conditions, pediatri-\ncians must recognize that these children are at in-\ncreased risk for poor educational, vocational, and finan-\ncial outcomes as young adults.\nThe present analysis has several limitations. First, ow-\ning to data limitations, only 3 chronic illnesses could be\nincluded in the nonasthmatic chronic illness group. It is\nlikely that there are more children with significant chronic\nillnessthanthe3.0%identifiedbythepresentstudy.Ifother\nchronic illnesses have similar implications for adult out-\ncomes, the differences documented herein between the\nhealthy and chronic illness groups may be underesti-\nmates. Second, the present study did not take into ac-\ncountotherdetailsregardingthetiming,severity,andtreat-\nment of the conditions examined, which are all factors that\nmay affect young adult outcomes. Finally, there may be\nmediatorsofyoungadultoutcomesthatarespecifictothose\ngrowing up with diabetes mellitus, cancer, and epilepsy\nand that have distinctive implications. For example, those\nconditionscouldpotentiallyaffectcognitiveprocesses;cog-\nnitive impairment would negatively affect the young adult\noutcomes examined herein. This type of cognitive effect\ncontrasts with the more generic effects of growing up with\na chronic illness, such as increased family stress, finan-\ncial distress, missed school, and altered peer relations,\nwhich could affect young adult outcomes.27 Identifica-\ntion of the salient mediators is needed to develop tar-\ngeted interventions that support young adults with chronic\nillness as they enter adulthood.\nFuture study is needed to examine noncategorical and\ndisease-specific factors that affect the young adult out-\ncomes of those growing up with childhood chronic ill-\nness. Specific mediators, such as school absenteeism, cog-\nnitive impairment, parent/guardian financial stress, and\npsychiatric illness, warrant investigation. In addition, lon-\ngitudinal studies are needed to examine the trajectories\nthat children with chronic illness follow as they move\nfrom childhood/adolescence to adulthood. The mean age\nof young adults in this study was 22 years; further study\nof adult outcomes, such as college graduation, mar-\nriage, and other long-term psychosocial and financial out-\ncomes, is needed.\nIn conclusion, most young adults with chronic ill-\nness graduate high school, are employed, and do not re-\nceive governmental financial assistance. However, the re-\nsults of this study confirm the increased risk of poor\neducational, vocational, and financial outcomes in young\nadults with chronic illness. Continued efforts are needed\nto support children growing up with chronic illness to\nbecome successful adults, particularly interventions that\ntarget educational attainment and vocational readiness.\nPediatricianscanplayaroleinpromotingsuccessfulyoung\nadult outcomes by recognizing that such patients are at\nincreased risk for educational, vocational, and financial\nproblems.\nCorrespondence: Gary R.
