A P&I hospi-\ntalization was defined as a hospitalization for which an Interna-\ntional Classification of Diseases (ICD) code for pneumonia or in-\nthe discharge record. These codes include bacterial and viral pneu-\nmonia of known and unknown etiology [13, 14]. A P&I death was\ndefined as one in which an ICD code for pneumonia or influenza\nwas coded as the underlying cause of death.\nDefinition of influenza seasons. Because influenza seasons usu-\nally include winter months, they typically bridge consecutive cal-\nsurveillance data from the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-\nvention (CDC) to define an influenza season. The average weekly\nnumber of influenza virus identifications was calculated for each\nmonths in which the number of virus identifications for 1 week\nwas more than twice the weekly average number of virus identi-\nfications for the preceding October. The remaining months were\nconsidered outside the influenza season.\nEach influenza season was further defined on the basis of the\npredominant circulating viruses. An influenza A(H3N2) season was\ndefined as a season in which A(H3N2) viruses comprised 75%\nof that season's total influenza isolates. An influenza A(H1N1)/\ninfluenza B season was defined as a season in which one or both\nof these viruses together comprised 75% of the season's influenza\nisolates. A mixed season was defined as one in which neither in-\nfluenza A(H3N2) virus nor the combined number of influenza\nFigure 1.

The national total of hospitalizations can be estimated\nfrom the sum of the weights. Each NHDS record contains up to\n7 ICD-coded discharge diagnoses, usually listed in the order of\ntheir appearance on the original hospital discharge record. We ex-\ntracted all hospital discharge records fitting our definition of a P&I\nhospitalization and retained the weight variable, the patient's age,\nand a hospital admission date (month and year). For each of the\n26 years studied, national monthly numbers of P&I hospitalizations\nwere calculated for all ages and for 2 age groups (!65 and 65\nyears).\nValidation of NHDS data for estimating monthly hospitaliza-\ntions. In 1987, a sizable fraction of NHDS hospitals began pro-\nviding discharge records for only a subset of months each year [15].\nSince this potentially introduced a bias for the analysis of seasonal\ndata, we validated the use of monthly NHDS data for estimating\nexcess P&I hospitalizations during influenza seasons. A special\nincluded a variable (not found in the publicly available database)\nidentifying \"partially\" participating hospitals (i.e., those submitting\nrecords for some months) and \"fully\" participating hospitals (i.e.,\nthose submitting records for all months). We determined that the\nmonthly P&I hospitalization records submitted by the partially\nparticipating hospitals accounted for 10%\u00ad25% of the yearly total\nP&I records from NHDS for those 6 years (corresponding to\n9%\u00ad22% of US yearly total P&I hospitalizations). The monthly\ndata from the partially participating hospitals exhibited a seasonal\npattern of P&I hospitalizations, similar to the public data set, in-\ncluding peaks during the same months within the influenza seasons.\nWe concluded that the potential bias was minimal and that the\nNHDS public use data were suitable for analysis of monthly P&I\nhospitalization data.\nEstimation of excess P&I hospitalizations. A method recently\ndeveloped for analyzing monthly P&I mortality data was used to\nestimate excess P&I hospitalizations during each influenza season\n[12]. In brief, a baseline was constructed of the number of expected\nP&I hospitalizations in winter months in which influenza was ab-\nsent. First, a 3-month moving average of P&I hospitalizations was\ncalculated for 24 Novembers between January 1970 and December\n1995 that were not considered part of any influenza season. We\nthen raised this November baseline to best fit the level of P&I\nhospitalizations in the month of December during 6 seasons in\nwhich the influenza period started in January or later. This was\nachieved by iteratively adding a constant to the November baseline\nlevel until the squared distance between the increased November\nbaseline and the December estimates was minimized. The sum of\nP&I hospitalizations above the December baseline during an in-\nfluenza season was considered excess hospitalizations attributable\nto influenza.\nSeasonal numbers and rates of excess P&I hospitalizations were\ncalculated for the total population and for the age groups !65 and\n65 years by use of US census data (e.g., the 1970 census for the\nthe baseline levels of expected P&I hospitalizations were varied\nupward or downward by 30%, there was a 14% decrease and in-\ncrease, respectively, in the estimated numbers of excess P&I\nhospitalizations.\nComparison of excess P&I hospitalizations and deaths during in-\nfluenza seasons.

The average\ninfluenza season in this study was 4 months (range, 3\u00ad6 months;\ntable 1).

In contrast, among persons aged 65 years, there was\nno significant decline ( ) in excess P&I hospitalizationrates\nover the same seasons (table 3).\nAn analysis of excess P&I mortality showed a similar pattern\nof declining excess mortality rates in the younger age group\n3). Compared with the average excess mortality rate for the 4\nmost recent A(H3N2) seasons, rates of excess P&I mortality\ntimes higher during the next 5 A(H3N2) seasons. In contrast,\namong the elderly, rates of excess P&I mortality were only 2\ntimes higher during the 1968 pandemic than during the most\nrecent A(H3N2) seasons, and the pattern did not decline over\ntime.\nDiscussion\nThe national impact of influenza on hospitalizations has been\ndocumented less well than the impact on mortality.

Although average rates of excess\nlation), the younger age group accounted for more than half\nof the total number of influenza-related P&I hospitalizations.\nIn addition, the average number of excess P&I hospitalizations\nwas twice as high during seasons dominated by influenza\nA(H3N2) viruses as during those dominated by influenza B/\nOur findings are consistent with those reported by other in-\nvestigators. In a study of influenza-related hospitalizations that\nwas also based on NHDS data, the authors estimated an av-\nerage seasonal number of 172,000 excess P&I hospitalizations\nAlthough we used an entirely different statistical approach, we\nestimated an average of 175,000 excess P&I hospitalizations for\nthe same 5 seasons. Previous studies also showed that excess\nhospitalizations but not excess mortality could be documented\nin some seasons dominated by influenza B and A(H1N1) viruses\npitalizations per 100,000 population occurred during the influ-\nenza seasons without measurable excess in P&I mortality and\nthat most of those hospitalizations were among persons aged\n!65 years. A key finding was that the overall seasonal numbers\nof excess P&I deaths and excess P&I hospitalizations were lin-\nearly correlated, regardless of the predominant circulating types\nor subtypes of influenza virus. This observation is useful, be-\ncause it suggests that rates and numbers of excess P&I hos-\npitalizations can be extrapolated from national excess P&I mor-\ntality estimates, which are calculated routinely in the United\nStates by the CDC.\nAlthough some investigators have suggested that influenza-\nrelated hospitalizations might provide a more sensitive index\nthan mortality for assessing the severity of individual influenza\nepidemics [11], the direct annual estimation of excess P&I hos-\npitalizations poses some difficulties. First, hospitalization dis-\ncharge coding can be sensitive to changes in billing practices.\nSecond, NHDS data are derived from a 1% sample of US\nhospitalizations, and estimates of seasonal excess P&I hospi-\ntalizations derived from the sample are subject to considerable\nrandom error. Although Health Care Financial Administration\ndata cover most hospitalizations for persons aged 65 years\nin the United States and could be utilized (see [18]), such studies\nwould allow only estimates of influenza-related hospitalizations\nfor the elderly population. By contrast, annual national esti-\nmates of excess P&I mortality are based on complete mortality\nrecords for the United States. Extrapolating hospitalization es-\ntimates from mortality estimates on the basis of the linear re-\nlationship between overall excess P&I hospitalizations and ex-\ncess P&I mortality and the other considerations would be a\nreasonable approach for most years. In addition, the CDC's\nongoing surveillance for national P&I mortality data could be\nused to generate timely preliminary estimates of P&I hospital-\nizations after each influenza season [19]. However, for influenza\nseasons in which an unusual relationship between mortality and\nhospitalizations is suspected or for pandemic years in which\nthe introduction of a novel influenza virus is expected to result\nin substantially elevated morbidity and mortality, direct cal-\nculations of P&I hospitalizations would be preferable.\nIt is important to note that the analysis in this study was\nlimited to hospitalizations in which either pneumonia or influ-\nenza (P&I) was listed as the first condition on the discharge\nrecords. We did not attempt to estimate the total increase in\nhospitalizations attributable to influenza. Rates of hospitali-\nzations for other conditions, including acute bronchitis, chronic\nrespiratory disease, and congestive heart failure, may increase\nduring influenza seasons [18]. Another study would be needed\nto estimate the total impact of influenza on hospitalizations.\nThe large overall increase in P&I hospitalization rates among\npersons aged 65 years during periods outside influenza sea-\nsons was consistent with a general increase in infectious disease\nhospitalization rates among the elderly during the 1980s [20].\nThe basis for the increase is uncertain. It could reflect a true\nincrease in hospitalizations among the elderly, perhaps as a\nresult of the aging of that cohort, or, alternatively, changing\nhospital reimbursement practices [20]. Regardless, our method\nfor establishing a baseline of expected P&I hospitalizations in\nthe absence of influenza adjusted for this secular trend in the\ndata.\nA final observation of particular interest was the significant\ndecline in rates of excess P&I hospitalization among persons\naged !65 years during the influenza A(H3N2) seasons following\nthe 1968 pandemic. During the study period, persons aged !65\nyears accounted for a gradually declining proportion of excess\nP&I hospitalizations from 70% to 40% in the influenza\nwas seen in the elderly age group (table 3). In a previous study,\nwe described a similar, but even more dramatic, pattern for\ninfluenza-related mortality following all 3 pandemics in this\ncentury [12]. The major implication of these observations is\nthat excess hospitalizations and deaths during the next influenza\npandemic probably will increase substantially beyond rates in\nrecent A(H3N2) seasons among persons aged !65 years. By\ncontrast, rates of influenza-related hospitalizations and deaths\namong the elderly are almost always higher than in the younger\nage group, and our findings suggest that rates of influenza-\nrelated hospitalizations and deaths may increase only margin-\nally during the next pandemic. The potential for a dispropor-\ntionate increase in rates of influenza-related hospitalizations\nand deaths among persons aged !65 years during the next pan-\ndemic is important and should be taken into consideration by\nthose developing plans to diminish the health impact of the\nnext pandemic.\n"
