We hypothesize that men\nwill feel guiltier from imagined emotional rather than sexual infidelity, as it is most\nimportant for their partner's reproductive success. Similarly, we predict that women will\nfeel more guilt from imagined sexual rather than emotional infidelity. The findings indicate\na different pattern; men feel guiltier following sexual infidelity, whereas women feel\nguiltier following emotional infidelity. Results also show that both sexes believe their\npartners would have a more difficult time forgiving sexual, rather than emotional,\ninfidelity, but women and not men report that sexual infidelity would more likely lead to\nrelationship dissolution. These findings are discussed in view of evolved mating strategies\nand individual reproductive success.\n",

All infidelity is not the same, however,\nas women and men apparently do not perceive their affairs in an equivalent manner.\nWomen tend to state that their affairs are more emotional than sexual, while men tend to\nstate that their affairs are more sexual than emotional (Glass and Wright, 1985). This sex\nSex differences in guilt\ndifference in the emotional versus sexual characterization of infidelity has been echoed in\nnumerous evolutionary-based studies.\nOne of the most well documented, evolutionary-based sex differences in behavior is\nthat of jealousy resulting from a mate's infidelity. A myriad of investigations show that\nwomen tend to be more jealous of a mate's emotional infidelity, and men tend to be more\njealous of a mate's sexual infidelity (e.g., Brase, Caprar, and Voracek, 2004; Buss, Larsen,\nEmotional infidelity occurs when an individual who is in a committed relationship becomes\nemotionally involved with (e.g., feels romantic love towards) a person other than their mate\n(Brase et al., 2004), whereas sexual infidelity is sexual involvement with a third party. The\nexplanation for this sex difference lies in its importance to an individual's reproductive\nsuccess. Daly, Wilson, and Weghorst (1982) argued that male sexual jealousy evolved as a\ncuckoldry avoidance mechanism, because men are not assured of paternity and are at risk\nof providing for the progeny of another man. In contrast, women, who have full maternal\nconfidence, should be more threatened by emotional infidelity than by sexual infidelity,\nbecause their mating strategy involves finding and retaining a mate willing to provide long-\nterm investments in children. Emotional infidelity increases the probability that a man's\ntime, attention, and, ultimately, resources will be redirected to a rival woman and her\nchildren (Daly et al., 1982; c.f. DeSteno, Bartlett, Braverman, and Salovey, 2002, for an\nalternative explanation).\nGiven that jealousy due to infidelity has been well studied, it is curious that there\nhas been little attention devoted to the feelings of people who actually engage in, or at least\ncontemplate, infidelity. Undoubtedly, numerous emotions must result as a consequence of\ninfidelity. However, guilt should be a primary consequence, as unfaithful individuals will\nlikely perceive themselves as breaking a prior commitment or social contract. Guilt has\nbeen defined as \"an interpersonal phenomenon that is functionally and causally linked to\ncommunal relationships of people...It is a mechanism for alleviating imbalances or\ninequities in emotional distress within the relationship\" (Baumeister, Stillwell, and\nHeatherton, 1994, p. 243). Guilt is central to responsible behavior (Bear, Manning, and\nIzard, 2003) and may serve as a warning that one's actions are unacceptable to the partner\nand social group. The resulting aversive emotional state that follows from guilt may cause\ninfidelity to be viewed as an objectionable social transgression, making it unappealing and\nless likely to be repeated.\nWithin social species, guilt, which is associated with the threat of doing harm and\nthe desire for reparation, shapes the behavior of individuals and determines their social\nstanding and acceptance within the group (Drickamer and Vessey, 1982). Guilt fosters a\ngeneral interest in the wellbeing of others in the group, making individuals more responsive\nto each other's distress, and hence, more likely to offer sympathy and aid (Gilbert, 1997).\nThat is, one purpose of guilt is to stimulate individuals to examine the hardship that they\ncause others through their actions and, as a consequence, to evoke reparative behaviors.\nOnce a transgression has been committed, guilt may help to reestablish the individual as a\nmember of the group by motivating reparative behaviors. In the case of infidelity, the\ndisplay of guilt might help rebuild trust by indicating to the offended party that the\nperpetrator does not plan to repeat the behavior.\nPrevious research on extramarital sexual relationships has indicated that men report\nexperiencing less guilt following an infidelity and are more likely to see it as being justified\nSex differences in guilt\nthan women (Johnson, 1970). Similarly, although both sexes believe extramarital coitus is\nthe result of marital problems, women are more prone to feeling guilt following infidelity\nthan men (Spanier and Margolis, 1983). However, the experience of guilt does not seem to\ndepend on spousal knowledge of the infidelity (Spanier and Margolis, 1983). Moreover,\nMongeau, Hale, and Alles (1994) presented undergraduates with scenarios of sexual\ninfidelity that varied according to whether the infidelity was intentional or unintentional.\nParticipants were asked to imagine themselves as engaging in the infidelity. The results\nshowed that guilt was the only feature inversely influenced by intent. That is to say, the\nmore intentional the act, the less guilt was reported, demonstrating it to be a critical factor\nin studies of infidelity. These initial results on infidelity are promising, but limited. In\nparticular, they do not encourage evolutionary-based predictions, such as the comparison\nacross various forms of infidelity (i.e., sexual versus emotional). The present study allows\nus to directly test evolutionary-based theories, adding to the overall knowledge of guilt\nfollowing infidelity, and helps to bridge the gap between guilt and previous jealousy\nresearch. Additionally, as there is little known about forgiveness following infidelity and its\nrelationship to guilt, the secondary aim of the present research is to address this need.\nAlthough infidelity is a major cause of divorce (Atkins, Yi, Baucom, and\nChristensen, 2005; Betzig, 1989), not all couples choose to dissolve their relationship after\na transgression (Lawson, 1988). In part, the decision to forgive a mate instead of choosing\nto end the relationship stems from the form of infidelity that took place. Men, relative to\nwomen, find it more difficult to forgive a mate's sexual rather than emotional infidelity and\nare more prone to end the relationship following their partner's sexual infidelity\n(Shackelford, Buss, and Bennett, 2002). To date, however, there has been no investigation\nof guilt in conjunction with the decision to either forgive the mate or dissolve the\nrelationship, based on the form of infidelity.\nAs previously stated, the primary goal of the current study is to investigate sex\ndifferences in guilt and forgiveness with respect to infidelity. To draw comparisons with\nprior research on jealousy, the forced-choice measure of jealousy that is commonly used in\nthis line of research (i.e., Sexual Jealousy Scale; Buss et al., 1992, 1999) was adapted by\nsubstituting the term \"guilt\" for any mention of the term \"jealousy.\" There have been\ncriticisms about the use of forced-choice procedures in infidelity research, such as those\nsuggested by De Steno et al. (2002) who proposed that this format does not adequately\ncapture a participant's true intentions. They contended that the sex difference in infidelity\noriginates from the measurement format, and that there is a complex decision-making\nprocess involved that leads women to override any initial leanings towards sexual infidelity\nand to select emotional infidelity ultimately as the most distressing. If this contention were\ntrue, one would predict a longer reaction time in responses for women given the forced-\nchoice dilemma. However, an analysis of response times for choosing sexual versus\nemotional infidelity clearly negates this idea. Sch\u00fctzwohl (2004) found that men are far\nquicker at selecting sexual infidelity and women at selecting emotional infidelity. DeSteno\net al.'s (2002) claim was further refuted by Pietrzak, Laird, Stevens, and Thompson (2002)\nwho compared forced-choice responses with continuous rating scales and physiological\nmeasures that included heart rate, skin temperature, electrodermal activity,\nelectromyographic activity of the forehead muscle, and systolic and diastolic blood\npressures. All measures indicated the same outcome: men are more distressed by imagined\nsexual infidelity, and women by imagined emotional infidelity. Interestingly, men and\nSex differences in guilt\nwomen reported feeling more angry about the type of infidelity that distressed them, thus\nproviding the possibility that other emotions, such as guilt, may be important in people's\nexperience of infidelity.\nRegardless of the potential flaws with the format, our ultimate reason for using the\nforced-choice format is to examine guilt in the same manner as jealousy so that parallels\ncan be made between the two emotions. Hence, to permit comparison, we adopted the\ntypical style of measurement that has been used in this area of research (e.g., Buss et al.,\nSince one function of guilt is to prohibit people from behaving in undesirable ways\nwithin social relationships, individuals are likely to experience guilt with respect to the cost\nof the infidelity on their partner's reproductive success. Therefore, men are predicted to\nexperience more guilt from an imagined performance of emotional rather than sexual\ninfidelity, paralleling prior findings that women are more distressed by a mate's emotional\ninfidelity (e.g., Buss et al., 1992; Pietrzak et al., 2002). Likewise, it is hypothesized that\nwomen experience more guilt from the performance of an imagined sexual rather than\nemotional infidelity. Further, we propose that women will expect a partner to have more\ndifficulty forgiving sexual infidelity, and that sexual infidelity will be more likely to lead to\nrelationship dissolution. Similarly, we expect men to indicate that a partner will have more\ndifficulty forgiving emotional infidelity, and that emotional infidelity will be more likely to\nlead to relationship dissolution.\nMaterials and Methods\nheterosexual participants were solicited from various community locations in the\nmetropolitan city of Toronto, Canada. Fifty-seven percent of all participants claimed to be\nin a committed relationship, 10% reported being in a casual relationship, and 33% reported\nthey were not currently involved in a romantic relationship. Self-reported ethnicity of\nparticipants was varied; 33% reported that they were \"Caucasian/White descent,\" 22%\nreplied \"Canadian,\" 22% replied \"Asian/East Asian/South Asian,\" 14% replied\n\"African/Black descent\" and 9% replied \"other.\"\nThe survey was patterned after Buss et al.'s Sexual Jealousy Scale (1992, 1999).\nThe wording of the survey matched this measure as closely as possible, but was designed to\nprobe guilt rather than jealousy. The survey also introduced a third party, who was intended\nto be the person with whom the affair took place. The dilemmas were counterbalanced\nacross two versions of the survey, and through the alternation of response options within\neach survey. In Part 1 of the survey, participants were presented with the following\ninstructions:\n\"Please think of a serious or committed romantic relationship that you have had in\nthe past, that you are currently having, or that you would like to have. Imagine that,\nwithout your partner knowing, you have become interested in someone else (Person S).\nWhat would make you feel more guilt? Please circle only one answer.\"\nParticipants then answered the following forced-choice dilemmas. Dilemma 1:\n\"Imagining yourself enjoying passionate sexual intercourse with Person S\" or \"Imagining\nyourself forming a deep emotional attachment to Person S.\" Dilemma 2: \"Imagining\nyourself trying different sexual positions with Person S\" or \"Imagining yourself falling in\nSex differences in guilt\nlove with Person S.\" Dilemma 3: \"Passionate sexual intercourse with Person S\" or \"Deep\nemotional attachment to Person S.\" Dilemma 4: \"Imagining yourself having sexual\nintercourse with Person S, but you are certain that you will not form a deep emotional\nattachment\" or \"Imagining yourself forming a deep emotional attachment to Person S, but\nyou are certain that you will not have sexual intercourse.\" Dilemma 5: \"Imagining that you\nare still sexually interested in Person S, but are no longer in love with this person\" or\n\"Imagining that you are still emotionally involved with Person S but are no longer sexually\ninterested in this person.\" Lastly, Dilemma 6: \"Imagining you have sexual intercourse for\none night with Person S with no chance of any emotional involvement\" or \"Imagining you\nbecome emotionally involved with Person S with no chance of any sexual involvement.\"\nPart 2 of the study was derived from the work of Shackelford et al. (2002), who\nused the standpoint of jealousy to examine the influence of infidelity on a mate's decision\nto forgive or dissolve the relationship. Mentions of jealousy were replaced with guilt and\nthen participants were asked to assume the imagined affair had already occurred.\nParticipants were then asked three questions pertaining to infidelity and requested to choose\nbetween sexual or emotional alternatives. These three questions were: \"Which aspect of\nyour involvement with Person S would make you feel more guilty?\" (Dilemma 7), \"Which\naspect of your involvement do you think would be more difficult for your committed\npartner to forgive?\" (Dilemma 8), and \"Which aspect of your involvement with Person S\nwould be more likely to lead you to break up with your committed partner?\" (Dilemma 9).\nWith regards to procedure, a female researcher approached participants individually\nin a variety of public locations and asked them to participate in a brief study on personal\nrelationships. Individuals were solicited only if they appeared to be alone and unhurried.\nParticipants completed an informed consent form, followed by the survey, and a short\ndebriefing session. Completed surveys were returned in a sealed, unmarked envelope to the\nresearcher.\nResults\nA significant sex difference emerged for the six summated items of the survey (Part\n1), producing small to moderate effects according to the benchmarks of Cohen (1988).\nIndependent-sample t tests indicated that women (M = 3.2, SD = 2.0) chose imagined\nemotional infidelity as a cause of guilt significantly more than men (M = 2.6, SD = 1.6; t129\ninfidelity as a cause of guilt significantly more often than women (M = 2.7, SD = 2.0; t129\n=\nChi-square analyses for the individual items in Part 1 yielded three significant\nwithin-sex differences. dCox\nwas also calculated (see S\u00e1nchez-Meca, Mar\u00edn-Mart\u00ednez, and\nChac\u00f3n-Moscoso, 2003), a metric based on odds ratios, as a measure of effect size to allow\nthe benchmarks of Cohen's d effect size (1988) to be applied. Significantly more women\nreported that they would feel more guilt from falling in love rather than from trying\nof women was equivalent for the remaining dilemmas. Significantly more men reported\nthey would feel more guilty following sexual infidelity without emotional involvement\nrather than emotional infidelity without sexual involvement (Dilemma 3) (2 = 4.45, p <\n= 0.36), even when the sexual infidelity occurred on a one-night basis (Dilemma\nSex differences in guilt\n= 0.32). The proportion of men was equivalent for the remaining\ndilemmas.\nThe summated three items of the survey pertaining to partner forgiveness (i.e., Part\n2) did not yield a significant sex difference for emotional infidelity, (t129\nnor for sexual infidelity (t129\n= 0.76, p > .05). However, within-sex chi-square analyses\nyielded three significant differences. Although relatively equal numbers of males (2 =\nthem to feel guilty (Dilemma 7), both sexes thought that a partner would find it\nsignificantly more difficult to forgive sexual as opposed to emotional infidelity (Dilemma\nWomen, but not men, thought that their sexual infidelity would be more likely to lead to a\nbreak-up than would emotional infidelity (Dilemma 9) (2 = 6.06, p <.01, dCox\nDiscussion\nWomen have historically depended on men for resources and protection (e.g., Hrdy,\n1981). Hence, women may be sensitive to a partner's emotional infidelity, as it signals he\nmay allocate resources and protection to other women, and therefore, they express jealousy\nover a mate's emotional infidelity (e.g., Buss et al., 1992). This theory is extended to\npropose that men will feel more guilt over imagined emotional rather than sexual infidelity,\nas emotional infidelity may jeopardize a mate's reproductive success. Likewise, given\npaternal uncertainty, men may be more sensitive to women's sexual infidelity. Hence,\nwomen are predicted to feel more guilt over imagined sexual infidelity rather than\nemotional infidelity because it potentially decreases a mate's reproductive success.\nHowever, the results indicate the reverse of both these predictions to be true. That is, the\nfindings indicate that men feel more guilt over imagined sexual infidelity, and women feel\nmore guilt over imagined emotional infidelity. We now discuss a variety of possible\nreasons for these unexpected results.\nFirst, throughout evolutionary history, men have sought to establish paternal\nconfidence so as to avoid erroneously investing time, resources, and energy in children who\nare not biologically related to them (e.g., Daly et al., 1982). Thus, it is hardly surprising\nthat men are relatively more likely to express jealousy when their partners commit sexual\ninfidelity but less so over emotional infidelity. Perhaps men are prone to experience more\nguilt over sexual rather than emotional infidelity given the importance they place on it in\ntheir relationships. They may believe that their sexual loyalty is as important to their mates\nas it is to them, and consequently, feel more guilt after performing an act of sexual\ninfidelity.\nEmotional infidelity may effectively signal a lack of dedication towards one's mate.\nSince women have historically relied on men's resources (e.g., Hrdy, 1981), which are\nlikely allocated towards individuals with whom they feel emotional loyalty, this form of\ninfidelity should be important to women. Similar to the reasoning above, one explanation\nfor the results of the current study is that women cannot see past the importance they place\non emotional loyalty, and hence, it causes them the most guilt.\nSecond, the results suggest an absence of cross-sex mind reading (Haselton and\nBuss, 2000). When trying to ascertain the intentions of the opposite sex, individuals\nroutinely make errors and the findings of the current study may be another instance of this\nSex differences in guilt\nbehavior. If individuals do not correctly \"mind read\" the opposite sex then it might not be\npossible for them to feel guilt over the form of infidelity that could potentially harm a\nmate's reproductive success. Instead, if an individual assumes that everyone, regardless of\ntheir sex, is most concerned with the same form of infidelity that they themselves are most\nconcerned about, this person would consequently make false inferences leading to feelings\nof guilt. This faulty logic may then lead women to feel more guilt over emotional infidelity,\nunder the belief that men consider emotional infidelity most important. A similar process\ncould occur for men.\nThird, there are sex differences in how extra-dyadic relations are perceived. Glass\nand Wright (1985) found that women believe their affairs to be more emotional than\nsexual, and that men believe their affairs to be more sexual than emotional. It is possible\nthat women experience guilt over emotional infidelity because they actually perceive their\nrelationships to be primarily emotional. In contrast, because men perceive their affairs to be\nprimarily sexual, their guilt is focused on the sexual aspects of the relationship.\nFourth, it is possible that guilt is a consequence of intra-sexual competition. That is,\nas men know that other men, against whom they compete for mates, are most upset by\nsexual infidelity, men will thus feel most guilty about sexual infidelity in an attempt to\nminimize the likelihood or severity of competing males' retribution. The opposite is\npossible for women in that they feel the greatest guilt over emotional infidelity, as it is\nmore likely to trigger retributive actions by other women against whom they are competing\nfor mates.\nOur findings of a sex difference in guilt resulting from sexual or emotional\ninfidelity diverge further from the jealousy literature in that the differences we obtained are\nsmaller and seen for only three of the six dilemmas in Part 1. There are at least three\npotential explanations for this difference. First, guilt may be less suitable for the use of a\nself-report methodology than jealousy, in that it may be a deeper, more reflective emotion,\nand subsequently harder for individuals to report. However, we expect that both guilt and\njealousy fall victim to a social desirability bias. Second, perhaps the nature of the task\ncaused the difference, but this option seems unlikely as the limitations of the forced-choice\nquestionnaire and the use of imagined scenarios are the same format as was used in earlier\nstudies (see Shackelford et al., 2002, for discussion). Third, the divergence is partly\nexplained by differences in sampling procedure; the current investigation used a\ncommunity sample, but Buss et al., (1992), and Shackelford et al. (2002), tested\nundergraduate samples. Support for this contention was obtained by Voracek (2001), who\nfound that marital status is a stronger predictor of responses towards infidelity than\nparticipant's sex. It should be noted that in the current study the possibility of a marital\nstatus effect was examined but exploratory regression analyses on the data showed that it is\nnot a significant predictor. As well, it may be the case that the lack of difference is due to\nsome combination of these explanations and is not simply the result of a single factor.\nThe dilemmas pertaining to a mate's decision to forgive or dissolve the relationship\nare particularly illuminating. We hypothesize that it would be advantageous for each sex to\nfeel maximal guilt for the form of infidelity considered most important to the opposite sex\nbecause guilt should facilitate reparations within social relationships. We further predict\nthat this pattern would relate to forgiveness. Men should expect their partners to find it\ndifficult to forgive emotional infidelity and that it more likely leads to relationship\ndissolution. Similarly, the reverse is hypothesized to be true for women. Again, the results\nSex differences in guilt\nfor the items on forgiveness did not yield the expected findings. Women believe it would\nbe more difficult for men to forgive sexual infidelity, and sexual infidelity would be more\nlikely lead to relationship dissolution. Given that men are more distressed by sexual\ninfidelity, it is logical that women perceive it to be harder for men to forgive this form of\ntransgression. To clarify, this finding suggests that women are aware of the importance\nmen place on sexual loyalty. Contrariwise, men seem to believe that sexual infidelity would\nnot necessarily lead to a break-up more often than emotional infidelity, although men\nclearly find sexual infidelity more difficult to forgive than emotional infidelity. This result\nindicates that men are aware, to some extent, of the importance women place on emotional\nloyalty. Furthermore, one can speculate from these findings that men may believe women\nhave a stronger need for the relationship, and hence, they will be more tolerant of\ntransgressions by choosing to forgive rather than dissolve the relationship. This contention\nhas some support, as women are far less likely to terminate a relationship because of a\nhusband's infidelity (Betzig, 1989), whereas men are more likely than women to perceive a\nsexual infidelity as grounds for divorce (Shackelford, 1998). This finding suggests that\ncross-sex mind reading is in fact occurring, and that the second explanation for men feeling\nmore guilt over sexual infidelity and conversely women feeling more guilt over emotional\ninfidelity is thus not very likely. That is, it is unlikely that a failure to perform cross-sex\nmind reading is the cause of the unexpected results.\nOne on-going debate in the jealousy literature is whether participants interpret the\ntwo types of infidelity as distinct or overlapping. DeSteno and Salovey (1996) argued that\nmen perceive women's sexual infidelity as simultaneously signaling emotional infidelity\nbecause women rarely engage in sexual behavior without an emotional commitment. They\nposit that women believe men can engage in sexual infidelity without emotional infidelity,\nbut that emotional commitment automatically implies sexual activity. Using mutually\nexclusive wording of the dilemmas, Buss and colleagues (1999) concluded that the two\nforms are distinct. We included these dilemmas in the present study of guilt and found only\none to yield a sex difference. When asked which would lead to more guilt, emotional\ninvolvement with no chance of sexual involvement or sexual intercourse for one night with\nno chance of emotional involvement (i.e., Dilemma 6), men more frequently chose the\nlatter option. Perhaps no other dilemma captures the dichotomy between the infidelities as\nstrongly; people rarely expect nor seek emotional involvement from this type of\nrelationship. Since there are sex differences in involvement in one night stands (i.e., a\nsexual encounter where the participants met that night), in that males' infidelity is more\nlikely to take this form and involve someone of limited acquaintance (Humphrey, 1987),\nthe result may be partly due to plausibility. Perhaps women do not relate well to the idea of\nhaving a one-night stand, whereas men have no trouble, and this difference in believability\nhas implications for the results. There is at least partial support for this theory, as\nFenigstein and Peltz (2002) found that, although both women and men believe each\ninfidelity could occur independent of the other, participants felt sex-only infidelity was\nmore plausible for men and emotion-only infidelity more plausible for women. In\nconclusion, the two forms of infidelity seem distinct, but that the form of stimuli used in\njealousy research (and subsequently this study) may lead to a consistent sex difference\npartly because of plausibility.\nOne may readily identify the limitations of the current study. Participants were not\nnecessarily individuals who had experienced actual infidelity, and instead, imagined\nSex differences in guilt\nscenarios were used especially to replicate the original research on jealousy and infidelity.\nWith respect to jealousy, whether imagined responses parallel actual distress remains\nunresolved. Harris's (2005) review of the literature concluded that individuals involved in\nreal infidelity respond differently, often in contradiction, to those who are asked to imagine\ntheir response. However, Edlund, Heider, Scherer, Farc and Sagarin (2006) demonstrated\nthat the hypothetical findings remain robust when compared with those who experienced\nactual infidelity. Thus, it is not possible to yet determine whether imagined versus actual\ninfidelity will cause different results for perceptions of guilt. Also, as we used a\ncommunity-based sample as opposed to undergraduate students that may have limited\nexperience in relationships, it is possible that participants were better able to imagine\ninfidelity because they have experienced it at some time in their life.\nThere are many directions for further research. One immediate direction is for\nresearchers to collect reaction times in responding to the scenarios, perhaps using identical\nmethods of Sch\u00fctzwohl (2004). This procedure would address the issues surrounding the\nuse of a forced-choice procedure. Alternatively, one could explore the underpinnings of\ninfidelity that lead to guilt. As there are many cues to a partner's impending infidelity, such\nas sexual boredom or argumentativeness (Shackelford and Buss, 1997b), the subsequent\nexperience of guilt may be associated with the salience of these cues. That is to say,\nbecause sexual boredom is a strong cue for sexual infidelity, people who use this cue prior\nto engaging in sexual infidelity may experience relatively low guilt, as they believe that\nthey have forewarned the mate. When these signals lie undetected, the individual may\nbelieve that the mate is not concerned enough to respond. Similarly, it would be\ninformative to explore how people determine that an infidelity is justified, and how this\nperception corresponds with feelings of guilt.\nAnother area for research pertains to personal mate value. Women who have higher\nvalue for mating, in that they are more physically attractive than their husbands, may\nexperience less guilt following an infidelity, as they are aware that they can more easily\nfind a new relationship should the current one end (Shackelford and Buss, 1997a). In\ncontrast, women whose mate value is lower may feel guiltier, leading them to expend more\neffort on repairing the relationship. The same pattern could emerge for men.\nAlthough jealousy in conjunction with infidelity has been a frequent topic of\nresearch for over a decade, there has been little, if any, attention to the feelings of people\nactually engaged in or contemplating infidelity. One emotion experienced in this situation\nis guilt, so an exploration of whether feelings of guilt correspond to the form of infidelity\nthat is most important for a mate's reproductive success was undertaken. The findings offer\na much needed, alternative view to the ongoing story of jealousy research and represent a\npromising start to a new line of inquiry.\nReferences\nAtkins, D.C., Baucom, D.H., and Jacobson, N.S.
