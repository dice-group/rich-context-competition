It suggests that while a rationalist, common sense representation of\ncommunication may be functional in making research impact appear achievable within existing funding, it may be potentially\ncounter-productive in terms of ensuring that research contributes to society. A recent project is cited to illustrate some of\nthe intellectual challenges that are not indicated in the ESRC guide, and which demonstrate the value of social science insight.\n",

If it is\nill-informed, routinely mishandled, and/or embedded in\nunderlying assumptions that separate knowledge from prac-\ntice, or view practitioners merely as users and audiences for\nacademic research, then it may be counter-productive. Far\nfrom enabling research to be used, it could affirm the often\nnegative (U.K.) practitioner preconceptions about research\nas arrogant, remote, and impractical.\nThere are well-established fields of research on knowl-\nedge transfer, research dissemination, diffusion of innova-\ntion, research utilization and science communication. So, it\nis useful to ask whether current policy and guidance is\nalready sufficiently informed (and critiqued) by those fields\nof research. Or, whether there is still an important role for\nareas of social science with relevant insight and expertise,\nsuch as applied linguistics and social studies of science.\nRelevant insight and expertise includes, for example, the\nanalysis of networks of contingent elements within the\ndevelopment and the use of research claims (e.g., Latour,\n1987), so challenging any simplistic causal expectation\nof \"research impact.\" It includes analysis of the cross-\ninstitutional communication of research (e.g., Roberts &\nSarangi, 2003), and of the relations and positioning of\nresearch participants, potential users, and stakeholders within\nthe processes of research (e.g., Cameron, Frazer, Harvey,\n1PublicSpace Ltd., Research Dissemination, Lancaster, UK\nCorresponding Author:\nSimon Pardoe, Director, PublicSpace Ltd., Bletherbeck House, Ulverston,\nEmail: simonpardoe2@publicspace.ac.uk\nResearch Impact Unpacked?\nA Social Science Agenda for Critically\nAnalyzing the Discourse of Impact\nand Informing Practice\nSimon Pardoe1\n Keywords\nresearch impact, critical discourse analysis, recontextualization, knowledge transfer, knowledge exchange, research\ncommunication, research dissemination guide, ESRC impact toolkit\n2 SAGE Open\nof institutional discourses and genres both as social practice\nand as a focus and mechanism of social and professional\nMore broadly, social science offers expertise in juxtapos-\ning theoretical perspectives, empirical evidence, and reflec-\ntions on experience. For many social scientists, there is a\nfundamental belief in a need to put theoretical, \"logical\" and\n\"common sense\" accounts of the world up against empirical\nevidence, and vice versa, so that our understanding is neither\nrationalist (where socially located assumptions and logical\nreasoning replace the need for evidence) nor dogmatically\nempiricist (where assumptions within research questions and\nwithin observations of evidence can remain unchallenged).\nIn fields across social science, researchers have usefully\nchallenged rationalist and common sense accounts, includ-\ning of communication (e.g., Ivan\u00edc et al., 2009; Roberts,\n1997), the management of professional change (e.g.,\nTengblad, 2012), and the interactions between science and\nother spheres (e.g., Jasanoff, 2005). They use research evi-\ndence to critique and cumulatively inform theoretical and\npractical insight.\nThe intention of this article is to identify the urgent need\nfor such research to analyze, inform, and potentially chal-\nlenge (i) the evolving practices of communicating publicly\nfunded research insight across institutions, and (ii) the ways\nin which this communicative work is being demanded, repre-\nsented, and informed within current policy and guidance.\nThe urgency is not just because this communicative work\nis central to making university research available and use-\nable. It is also because current representations and guidance\nare problematic in familiar ways, which have long been ana-\nlyzed and critiqued. Left unchallenged, they may have seri-\nous consequences for the future integrity, value, and use of\npublicly funded research.\nSpecifically, I propose an agenda of three inter-related\ncontributions:\n1. Critical analysis of the policy and guidance dis-\ncourse from research funding bodies, including their\nrepresentations of (a) research knowledge, (b) impact,\n(c) researchers and users, and (d) the strategies and\nprocesses of this cross-institutional communication.\n2. Case study analysis of the communication of\nresearch in practice, including the intellectual chal-\nlenges, potential pitfalls, and strategies; (with the\nintention to understand not only how research can be\nmade useable for, and with, potential users and stake-\nholders, but also how it is selectively taken up or\nignored within policy, debate, and professional\npractice).\n3. Conceptual guidance to inform professional aca-\ndemic practice and reflection on practice in research\ncommunication, to take it beyond the problematic\nemulation of product marketing, and beyond the\noften banal and problematic notions of publicity,\ncommunication skills, and getting your message\nacross; the goal must be for this wider communica-\ntion of research to become both productive for soci-\nety and intellectually valued by researchers, rather\nthan the reverse.\nIn this article, I focus primarily on the first. As an exam-\nple, I analyze the \"Step-by-step guide to maximising impact\"\n(SSG) offered by the U.K. Economic and Social Research\nCouncil (ESRC) within its online \"Impact toolkit\" for uni-\nversity researchers. With the ESRC as its author, this toolkit\nis arguably the most authoritative and significant guidance\non generating research impact for U.K.-funded social sci-\nence researchers. Analysis of this guidance is necessary, first\nto show the need for informed input and critique, and second\nto show just how fundamental (even basic) the social science\ninsights need to be to challenge the current representations of\nthis professional activity.\nTo support this analysis, I also briefly illustrate the value\nof (2) and (3). I include observations from the experience of\na recent European Commission (EC) FP7-funded project to\nillustrate some of the intellectual challenges in practice. I\nalso briefly refer to some concepts that inform my own prac-\ntice, to illustrate the kinds of conceptual understanding that it\nis possible to offer. Together, they help support the core argu-\nment in the analysis, that the current ESRC guidance is not\nmerely simple, but simplistic.\nThe title \"Research impact unpacked?\" is a dual question.\nFirst, it is about whether current guidance usefully unpacks\nthe challenges, pitfalls, and strategies involved in communi-\ncating research findings to those who might use them.\nSecond, it is about the need to unpack a problematic rational-\nist discourse within current policy and guidance on \"maxi-\nmizing research impact.\" For the latter, the question mark\nkeeps open the question of whether we have ever fully iden-\ntified the ways in which it is problematic.\nMethod\n\"Unsuitable Terminology\": Constructing the\nObject of Interest\nThe term knowledge transfer is the most familiar and estab-\nlished term used by research funders and others to refer to\nthis area of communicative activity. Yet the term is also\nseverely critiqued by authors involved in informing policy.\nIn the context of applied social research, Davies, Nutley, and\nWalter (2008) describe it as one of \"a plethora of unsuitable\nterminology,\" which \"misrepresent the tasks that they seek to\nsupport\" (p. 188). They argue,\nThe metaphor . . . is, at best, one of gathering and integrating\nevidence from research, condensing this into convergent\nknowledge, and neatly packaging this knowledge for transfer\nelsewhere. . . . In other words, knowledge parcels for grateful\nrecipients. Such a view belies the inherent and, we would argue,\nlargely insurmountable challenges of doing so for any but the\nmost simple and incontrovertible of findings. Moreover, . . . the\nsubtlety and complexity of research use in context further\nmilitate against simple models of \"translate and transfer.\"\nIn this way, they suggest that the term and its use misrep-\nresent each element within this communicative practice: the\nknowledge or findings, the actors, the challenges, and the\nprocesses of communication. Partly in response to such cri-\ntiques, the ESRC now emphasizes the term knowledge\nexchange (KE; discussed below) as a means to \"maximize\nyour impact\":\nKnowledge exchange (KE) is about opening a dialogue between\nresearchers and research users so that they can share ideas,\nresearch evidence, experiences and skills. This can involve a\nrange of activities; from seminars and workshops to placements\nand collaborative research. By creating this dialogue, research\ncan more effectively influence policy and practice, thereby\nmaximising its potential impact on the economy and wider\nsociety. (ESRC, n.d.-b: Knowledge Exchange)\nA further common term is research dissemination, which\ninvokes the metaphor of sowing seeds. While it is problem-\natic in implying a one-way flow of insight, if the metaphor is\npursued it can also remind us that research ideas need to ger-\nminate in context, within professional practice, and will\ntherefore develop in ways that cannot be fully predicted.\nBourdieu and Wacquant (1992) argue that such terms,\nalong with their associated literatures, policy documents, and\npractices, \"pre-construct\" the object of our interest (p. 229).\nThey therefore have to be viewed as part of the policy dis-\ncourse to be analyzed. Put simply, a research problem may\nlie partly in the current ways of representing and understand-\ning that problem and its solutions. Analysis should therefore\n\"shift away from simply using socially pre-constructed cat-\negories or objects, towards exploring the practices involved\nin their construction and maintenance\" (Fairclough, Pardoe,\ncourse of \"impact\" and \"KE\" must be a focus for critical\nreflection and analysis.\nNevertheless, any analysis requires a term with which to\nrefer to, and potentially re-conceptualize, the set of profes-\nsional practices that are of interest. No term is neutral, so it\nneeds to reflect our intellectual and practical interest.\nHere I shall use \"research communication\" as a deliber-\nately general term to describe the diverse set of communica-\ntive practices by which academic researchers engage with\npeople in the domains of policy, professional practice, and\npublic debate beyond academia, with the intention to develop\nand communicate significant insights from their research.\nThe term has been used similarly, for example, by Scott\n(2000) within his scoping report for the European\nEnvironment Agency. In addition, the EC (2010) guide for\nresearchers in socio-economic sciences and humanities is\ncalled \"Communicating research . . . \"\nThe term research communication can reflect a social and\nlinguistic interest in the cross-institutional communication of\nresearch insight. In contrast to knowledge transfer, it can\nkeep in view the two-way and contingent nature of commu-\nnication. In contrast to KE, the issue of whether the commu-\nnication constitutes an exchange is not presupposed, but\nretained as a focus of analytic interest. In contrast to both\nterms, research communication avoids reifying knowledge,\nand so can keep in view the potentially negotiated, contex-\ntual and contingent nature of what is ultimately communi-\ncated. It can describe a process in which insight may be\ndeveloped and refined through that communication, rather\nthan just transferred or exchanged.\nI deliberately use the same term to embrace both dialogue\nand produced artifacts (such as introductory leaflets, research\narticles and reports, online demonstrations, video documen-\ntary, broadcast interviews, and media publications). This\nhelps to keep in view a core insight from Bakhtin (1986), that\neven such texts and artifacts are dialogic: They are con-\nstructed in anticipation of encountering a response.\nAnalyzing the Representation of Professional\nPractice in Discourse\nAs a framework to analyze the representation of research\ncommunication in policy and guidance, I draw on the con-\ncept of \"recontextualization.\" Originally from Bernstein\nlyze the representation of social and professional practices in\ndiscourse.\nothers, I am using the term discourse to refer to language-in-\nuse that represents (and so also constructs) the world in\nsocially and institutionally established ways. That includes\nrepresenting knowledge and things, as well as identities,\nsocial relations, actions, and social practices. (For example,\nvan Leeuwen, 2008, analyzes the representations of a child's\nfirst day at school within expert advice to parents, and of\nimmigration in an Australian newspaper article.) Texts, parts\nof texts, and individual utterances may instantiate and per-\npetuate a particular discourse, yet we can also draw on com-\npeting discourses unwittingly, deliberately, and creatively to\nnegotiate and contest established representations (Fairclough,\nBernstein's (1990) sociological concept of recontextual-\nization was prompted by observing what he described as the\n\"overwhelming and staggering uniformity\" of classroom\nactivity and teaching practices across cultures and across the\ncurriculum (p. 169). He argued that social and professional\npractices such as physics and woodwork (his examples) are\nrecontextualized by a \"pedagogic discourse\" which \"funda-\nmentally transforms\" them into classroom physics and\nwoodwork. Physics is \"delocated\" from the original social\n4 SAGE Open\nrelations and purposes of research and industry, and \"relo-\ncated\" within the social relations of a pedagogic discourse,\nwith its own purposes, sequencing, and systems of\nevaluation.\nVan Leeuwen (2008) usefully develops the concept\nbeyond pedagogy, as an analytical framework with which to\n\"analyse all texts for the way they draw on, and transform,\nsocial practices\" (p. 5). He describes his work as starting\nfrom the view \"that all discourses recontextualize social\npractices, and that all knowledge is, therefore, ultimately\ngrounded in practice, however slender that link may seem at\ntimes\" (van Leeuwen, 2008, p. vii). He uses the term dis-\ncourse explicitly in the Foucauldian sense of\n\"a socially constructed knowledge of some social practice\"\ndeveloped in specific social contexts. (van Leeuwen, 2008, p. 6)\nBy empirically analyzing Australian news reports and\nwritten guidance for parents on their child's first day at\nschool, van Leeuwen (2008) observes that discourses\nnot only represent what is going on, they also evaluate it, ascribe\npurposes to it, justify it, and so on, and in many texts these\naspects of representation become far more important than the\nrepresentation of the social practice itself. (p. 6)\nSpecifically, he argues that recontextualization can\ninvolve the substitution, deletion, rearrangement, re-\nlegitimation, and re-evaluation of elements of the social\npractice. As these \"transformations\" can be achieved by\ndiverse linguistic means, his inventory is \"sociosemantic\"\nrather than traditionally linguistic (van Leeuwen, 2008, p.\n23; Halliday, 1978). He argues that in a \"recontextualization\nchain,\" such transformations \"can happen over and over\nagain, removing us further and further from the starting\nTwo important notes are necessary. First, recontextualiza-\ntion is not itself pejorative: Any representation involves\nrecontextualization. Rather, it is an analytical concept with\nwhich to investigate and critically analyze representations of\nsocial and professional practice. Second, it is important not\nto reify a pure or true practice (such as physics, woodwork,\nor parenting) prior to its recontextualization (Pardoe, 1997);\nsuch practices are usually heterogeneous and contested.\nMoreover, a social or professional practice may be informed\nand transformed by the discourses that selectively represent\nit.\nDrawing Insight From Case Studies\nIn advocating case study analysis (agenda item 2, above), it\nis important to acknowledge that the ESRC offers a growing\nnumber of \"impact case studies\" online. However, these are\nprimarily retrospective reports of successes, rather than anal-\nyses of the intellectual, practical, interpersonal, and organi-\nzational challenges within the communicative process. I\nsuggest it is useful to draw a parallel with Latour's (1987)\nclassic methodological distinction between studying \"ready\nmade science\" and \"science in the making.\" Rephrasing his\ncore principle (p. 4), I would argue that\nour entry into understanding research impact should be through\nthe back door of impact-in-the making, not through the more\ngrandiose entrance of ready-made-impact.\nAs decades of research in social studies of science and\nelsewhere have shown, issues and challenges can be most\nexplicit at moments when the opportunities are uncertain,\nstrategies are not yet decided, and success is still unclear.\nArguably, these moments are as important for developing\nguidance as they are for research, because the challenges are\noften forgotten once they are resolved. Studies of impact-in-\nthe-making are likely to reveal complex networks of contin-\ngent factors that together generate, co-produce (and counter)\nimpacts in the short and long term. Only some will be within\nthe control of the researcher.\nWhen proposing case studies, it is vital to be clear about\nwhat insight can be drawn from them. As many have argued\nin qualitative and case study research, a case cannot simply\nbe generalized as truth or as a guide for future work. Instead,\nits value is to offer a situated and potentially \"telling case\"\nthat contributes to building deeper conceptual understanding\n(discussed in Platt, 1988). It may enable us to refine or refute\nuniversal claims produced from common sense or from less\ndetailed research.\nIt is with that aim that I include brief observations from one\nrecent inter-disciplinary project below. The intention is simply\nto show that the intellectual challenges of research communica-\ntion in practice are of a different intellectual order from those\nassumed within the ESRC guidance. This contrast helps to\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 refute the general categorical assertions within the\nguidance,\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 foreground the ESRC assumptions and problematize\nthe discourse,\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 illustrate why such guidance needs to be informed by\nsocial science.\nThe example project.As the U.K. partner for the EC FP7-\ncollaborative focus was on generating understanding of\nrecent research on computer-based (in silico) methods for\nassessing chemical toxicity. The project was timely because\nthe 2007 EU REACH regulations demand that industry\nassess many thousands of existing chemicals in the coming\nyears. This is predicted to cost billions and \"consume\"\nmany millions of animals in traditional animal testing,\ndespite EU policy to approve animal testing only \"as a last\nresort.\"\nThe project therefore set out to inform professional think-\ning among regulators, industry, and toxicologists about in\nsilico methods as a means to reduce in vivo testing. One of\nmany dissemination strategies was to conduct detailed inter-\nviews with researchers, regulators, potential industry users,\nand other stakeholders to investigate and analyze their priori-\nties and concerns, and the issues around take-up. These were\ncommunicated in a video documentary (Pardoe, Cazzato,\nGolding, Benfenati, & Mays, 2011) as well as online (www.\nin-silico-methods.eu) and in open access articles (e.g.,\nAs a final ORCHESTRA output, we reviewed the experi-\nence of the project to help inform science and technology\nresearchers in future EC projects. An updatable e-guide\n(Pardoe & Mays, 2012) identifies some of the intellectual\nand practical challenges for researchers of making science\nand technology research engaging, accessible, and useable,\nwhile also retaining the scientific rigor and integrity of the\npublicly funded research. The project was an affirmation that\neven when research lies firmly within the natural sciences,\nsocial science insight can offer a vital contribution to under-\nstanding the challenges and potential pitfalls involved in a\nwider communication, and informing strategies.\nThe U.K. ESRC Guidance as a Focus for\nAnalysis\nWhy Analyze Guidance From the U.K. ESRC?\nThe ESRC is \"the UK's largest organisation for funding\nresearch on economic and social issues,\" and describes itself\nas \"an international leader in the social sciences\" (ESRC,\nn.d.-a). It financially supports more than 4,000 researchers\nand postgraduate students at any one time. Its \"role is to\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 promote and support . . . high-quality basic, strategic, and\napplied research . . . in the social sciences\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 advance knowledge and provide trained social scientists . . .\n, thereby contributing to the economic competitiveness of\nthe United Kingdom, the effectiveness of public services\nand policy, and the quality of life\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 provide advice on, disseminate knowledge of, and promote\npublic understanding of, the social sciences. (ESRC, n.d.-a)\nWith decades of social science research funded by it, the\nESRC is in a unique position among the U.K. funding bodies\nto be able to do (in its guidance) exactly what it now demands\nfrom its researchers: to show the value of social science\nresearch for informing policy and professional practice. The\nESRC funds much of the U.K. research that could usefully\ninform (and critique) our understanding of research commu-\nnication and impact, including in education, linguistics, man-\nagement, and science and technology studies.\nAfter many years of development and refinement, the\nimpact toolkit is the ESRC's online guide for funded research-\ners on how to maximize the impact from their research.\nBefore analyzing part of it, it is useful to look briefly at the\ndiscourse around it that justifies and explains the demand on\nresearchers.\nFrom U.K. \"Global Economic Performance\" to\n\"Succinct Messages\"\nConsistent with its umbrella organization, the Research\nCouncils UK (RCUK), the ESRC defines research impact as\n\"the demonstrable contribution that excellent research makes\nto society and the economy.\" The ESRC elaborates this as\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 fostering global economic performance, and specifically the\neconomic competitiveness of the United Kingdom\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 increasing the effectiveness of public services and policy\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 enhancing quality of life, health and creative output. (ESRC,\nn.d.-b: What is impact?)\nThese societal and economic goals are articulated to\nexplain and justify the U.K. \"funding regime that . . . embeds\nknowledge transfer as a permanent core activity in universi-\nties\" (HM Treasury, 2004, p. 76). The required shift in pro-\nfessional practice for university researchers is represented in\nterms of \"the behaviour and attitudes that RCUK wishes to\nfoster\" (RCUK, n.d.).\nAt the level of implementation, the policy becomes a\ndemand for each funded project to produce a \"pathways to\nimpact\" plan, and to generate and demonstrate impact. The\nESRC's role includes evaluating impact plans and giving the\nadvice analyzed below.\nIn this chain of recontextualization, the policy goals and\nthe potential ways forward are progressively transformed or\nnarrowed by decisions about how they can be achieved\nthrough specific demands and procedures. By viewing these\npolicy statements in a sequence, from global economic pri-\norities, to researcher \"behavior and attitudes,\" to calls for\n\"succinct messages\" (below), social scientists and discourse\nanalysts can usefully recognize and question each successive\nnarrowing.\nWhile such analysis is not the focus of this article, such\nsuccessive transformations and narrowing can be observed\nwithin single texts. The extract below, from a page within the\nimpact toolkit titled \"Why is KE important?\" consists of a\nseries of categorical and potentially non-controversial state-\nments. The policy and rhetorical action is achieved through\nmaking them sequential. As is often observed in critical dis-\ncourse analysis (e.g., Fairclough, 1992b), the most ideologi-\ncal and problematic steps are those which are omitted, and\nwhich the reader has to presuppose to make sense of the text.\nThe UK has a strong science base, but performs less well in\ncapitalising on new research to generate innovation. Effective\nKE is vital in ensuring research is translated into policy and\npractice. As a funding body, the ESRC spends over \u00a3211 million\na year on research, training and knowledge exchange. We want\n6 SAGE Open\nto ensure that our funded research is not only of the highest\nquality, but also has a positive impact on society. KE is therefore\nfundamental to the way we work.\n(*)However good your research, there is little point in doing it if\nnobody knows about it. If your research is to make a difference\nto policy or practice it must be accessible to potential users and\nother interested parties. Thinking about who these might be and\nhow to actively engage with them through the lifespan of your\nresearch will help you to:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Gain a better understanding of the needs of potential users,\ntheir expertise and their perspectives on your chosen topics\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Inform and improve the quality and focus of your research\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Gain valuable new skills\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Increase the prospects of your research being applied.\n(ESRC, n.d.-b: Why is KE important?)\nFor example, the statement at (*) would appear to be\nutterly obvious in a profession so focused on peer review and\npublication. Yet juxtaposing it with the subsequent state-\nments potentially redefines \"nobody\" as \"nobody outside\nacademia,\" which has fundamental implications for research.\nThe extract ends by bringing the U.K. societal and eco-\nnomic goals right down to the personal \"gains\" and skills for\n\"you\" as a researcher. The role of the impact toolkit is then to\nguide social science researchers in how to achieve those\nsocietal, economic, and personal goals, by \"ensuring research\nis translated into policy and practice.\"\nThe ESRC's Impact Toolkit and \"Step-by-Step\nGuide to Maximising Impact\" (SSG)\nOur impact toolkit gives you everything you need to achieve the\nmaximum impact for your work.The toolkit includes information\non developing an impact strategy, promoting knowledge\nexchange, public engagement and communicating effectively\nwith your key stakeholders. (ESRC, n.d.-b, emphasis added)\nThe impact toolkit is the core of the ESRC's written\nadvice for its funded researchers. Launched in January 2011,\nit is described by the ESRC as \"a practical tool\" which\n\"draws on best practice from investments\" (ESRC, 2011).\nIt consists of more than a hundred separate web pages. Its\nsize is relevant to this analysis because any omissions are not\ndue to brevity. In some areas, it has surprising levels of detail.\nFor example, it offers advice on networking, including \"cre-\nating rapport\" and \"making small talk,\" including advice to\n\"ask an open rather than a closed question\" in a coffee queue\nand to \"match and mirror body language\" of the person you\nare talking to (impact toolkit: tools: networking: creating\nrapport). A section, called \"tools,\" offers extensive to do lists\non \"branding,\" \"digital communications,\" \"events,\" \"media\nrelations,\" \"networking,\" \"publications,\" and \"public\nengagement.\" So from brief observation, it might appear\nalmost encyclopedic.\nWithin that toolkit, I analyze the \"SSG\" because it is one\nof the most explicit and practical guidance sections.\nElsewhere in the toolkit, the researchers are directed to the\nSSG for \"practical guidance on planning research impact.\" It\nis a section in which the ESRC goes beyond merely reiterat-\ning demands and policy statements, to offer step-by-step\nadvice and understanding on what research communication\ninvolves in practice. (I have also reviewed pages across the\nimpact toolkit to check that an observed omission in the SSG\nis not simply located elsewhere.)\nThe ESRC claims that the SSG addresses the readers'\nneed, both practically and intellectually. The introductory\npage \"Developing a strategy\" claims that \"This part of the\ntoolkit gives guidance on how to maximises impact\" [sic], it\n\"takes you through each stage of the process.\" A page direct-\ning researchers to the SSG states,\nThis takes you through the issues you will need to think about and\ngives advice on planning activities to help you generate impact.\n(ESRC, n.d.-b: What the ESRC expects, emphasis added)\nThe page headings within the SSG identify the steps and\napproach. The introductory page (1) is followed by\n2. Setting objectives\n3. Developing messages\n4. Targeting audiences\n5. Choosing channels\n6. Planning activities\n7. Allocating resources\nMeasuring success. (ESRC, n.d.-b: Developing a strategy:\nStep-by-step guide)\nPages 2, 3, 4, and 5 are most specifically about communi-\ncation, so they are my focus in the analysis and the frequency\ntables below. But first, it is worth simply quoting from pages\n3 and 5 to offer a further sense of the conceptual understand-\ning of communication offered by the SSG, and of the style of\nthe toolkit as a whole:\n(3) Developing messages\nDrafting your messages An effective strategy needs to have\nclear, succinct messages that summarise your research . . .\nWhen drafting your key messages, avoid using overly complex\nstatements . . . Remember that key audiences such as journalists\nand policymakers are overloaded with information and may not\nremember your messages if they are too complex.\nEnsure that the language you use is appropriate for the audience . . .\nUsing different formats . . . It's useful to try out your messages\nin different formats, for example: a media release; a report; a\nresearch briefing; a newspaper article; a website page . . .\nCreating a brand In order to convey your messages more\neffectively you need to think about branding . . .\n(5) Choosing channels\nIt is important to consider the most appropriate channels to reach\nyour target audience . . . for example: . . . why an email bulletin\nrather than face-to-face contact?\nResearching your audience Find out how your target audience\nprefers to receive information . . . (ESRC, n.d.-b: Developing a\nstrategy: Step-by-step guide)\nComment: The SSG as an Example of Informing\nProfessional Practice\nAcross the SSG, and more widely in the impact toolkit, the\nguidance consists of simple and categorical statements of\nthis kind. The simplicity and conceptual repetition (and the\noften circular linking of pages) make the SSG and wider\ntoolkit far less comprehensive than it first appears.\nIt is perhaps necessary to remember that it is written for\nuse by social science researchers. Even if the reader is not\ninvolved in research specifically related to communication\nor knowledge claims, they are nevertheless involved daily in\ncomplex communicative practices ranging from engaging\nstudents to managing teams and institutional politics, and in\nmaking subtle decisions about their communication strate-\ngies in meetings, emails, reports, and academic articles.\nMany of the guidance statements above could be applied\nequally to those familiar communicative practices. If they\nwere, they might be criticized for merely stating the obvious.\nIn other words, such statements are generalized and decon-\ntextualized communication advice that does not capture what\nis different, new or challenging about communicating\nresearch insight across institutions to inform policy and pro-\nfessional practice.\nReading such guidance can prompt us to ask the basic\nquestions that we should ask of any text that aims to inform\nprofessional practice. Is it really informing the readers (here\nsocial scientists) of things they do not already know? Does it\nreally address the challenges they face (in communicating\ntheir research to people in other contexts and professional\nworlds)? Does it offer the kind of conceptual understanding\nand practical detail they need to achieve it? Moreover, from\nall that we know from research and practice, is this really the\nmost useful information that we are currently able to offer?\nWhen involved in a research communication project, I\nraise such basic questions and concerns with the team, and\nsuggest strategies for finding out the answers. I would raise\nvery serious concern if a research team produced a guide for\nprofessionals that diverged so markedly from the discourse\npractices of those professionals, was so devoid of explicit\nresearch insight or evidence to support the guidance, and was\nso universal, directive, and categorical. I would be concerned\nabout whether it could create a productive relationship with\nthe user, whether it would inspire or actually deter use of the\nresearch, and whether the team had really investigated or\nunderstood the challenges and the varied contexts of use.\nThose questions seem highly relevant in this case.\nI would argue that while the authorship of the SSG and\nthe ESRC's decision-making around its production might be\ninteresting, that is not the primary issue. The authority of this\nguide and the claims made for it (see previous section), make\nthe text itself the focus of interest. Moreover, it is no maver-\nick text. Its consistency with other texts across the impact\ntoolkit and beyond, and its durability over the years, mean\nthat the text itself and the policy discourse that it instantiates\nand perpetuates are the interesting and legitimate focus for\nanalysis.\nAnalysis\nVan Leeuwen identifies several ways in which a social or\nprofessional practice may be recontextualized and so trans-\nformed by representations of it. To structure this analysis, I\nexplore six potential transformations:\n1. Relocating purposes\n2. Rearrangements and (re)ordering of actions\n3. Evaluations: the concepts offered to guide and review\ncommunication\n4. Substitutions: the representations of policy makers,\npractitioners, and publics\n5. Substitutions: the representations of communicative\nactions\n6. Legitimating the guide and the demand to maximize\nimpact\nRelocating Purposes\nQuestions like \"why are we doing this?\" or \"what for?\" are\nas central to research communication as they are to any activ-\nity. Van Leeuwen (2008) observes that representations of\npractice in discourse can involve adding, articulating, and/or\npotentially transforming the purpose(s) of that practice,\nincluding the participants' own sense of \"what for\" (p. 20).\nA first observation of the purposes articulated within the\nSSG is that these are almost all internal to the ESRC's fund-\ning procedures; they are delocated from the kinds of societal\ngoals and personal goals in the policy statements. A second\nobservation is that the purposes are all nevertheless appar-\nently unique to \"you,\" the reader:\n. . . Every strategy is different, but you can use these steps as a\ntemplate to develop your own. Your strategy takes you from\nwhere you are now to where you want to be. (ESRC, n.d.-c)\nIn this way, the text simultaneously locates the purposes\nwithin ESRC procedures, yet also claims they are individual\nand come from \"you.\" This is a familiar feature in advertiz-\ning, in which demands are both personalized and mitigated\n8 SAGE Open\nby invoking notions of freedom and choice (Fairclough,\n1992b). It also echoes a pervasive and problematic discourse\nin education (critiqued in various fields including in Hyland,\nrequired to generate their own purpose and unique text, with-\nout the institution recognizing or making explicit the institu-\ntionalized practices, constraints, and purposes within which\nthat individual purpose has to develop and will be judged.\nThe guide presents \"you\" with the demand to be (already)\nclear about \"your objectives,\" but without any useful indica-\ntion of how those objectives might be developed and clari-\nfied (see reordering below). Only one example is offered: \"A\ntypical set of objectives might be to:\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Build awareness of the project among a defined audience\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Secure the commitment of a defined group of stakeholders\nto the project aims\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Influence specific policies or policy makers on key aspects\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Encourage participation among researchers or partner bod-\nies (ESRC, n.d.-b: Step-by-step guide: Setting objectives)\nArguably, these objectives are merely an extension of the\npolicy demands rather than useful intentions informed by\npractice. They appear irrefutable because in each case it\nwould be difficult to advocate the opposite. In van Leeuwen's\n(2008) terms they are \"moralized actions\": abstractions that\nmerely \"trigger intertextual references to the familiar dis-\ncourses and values that underpin them\" (p. 126). For the\nresearch team, each objective only begs the kind of practical\n(what, who, how, and why) questions that the team already\nface. They are about impacts, rather than about the people,\nideas, and communicative processes that might one day\nachieve those impacts. They contrast markedly, for example,\nwith the respectful, self-questioning, experience-based \"tips\"\nfor engaging with policy makers offered by Goodwin (2013).\nThe SSG offers no conceptual basis, and no investigative\nstrategies, from which readers can develop their own objec-\ntives, or review them. There is no link to case studies that\ncould usefully show, for example, (a) that it is necessary to\nfind out what the \"key aspects\" of the research are for policy\nmakers or (b) that for stakeholders to \"commit\" to the project\naims, the research team may need to engage in interactions\nthat develop trust and credibility over time. Similarly, it\noffers no downstream illustration of how such objectives\nmight inform the communication strategies.\nInstead, the ESRC merely tells researchers to \"make sure\nthat you set SMART objectives\": \"specific,\" \"measurable,\"\n\"achievable,\" \"relevant,\" and \"time-bound.\" This is a frame-\nwork available on many project management and business\nadvice websites. Its representation as a checklist of demands,\nwith these particular elaborations of each letter (cf. Jisc\nInfoNet, 2008), reinforces the ESRC demand that \"impact\nmust be demonstrable\" (impact toolkit: what is impact?).\nThis representation reflects a current managerial policy focus\non \"performance indicators\"; it is an interesting shift from its\noriginal use. Morrison (2011) and others attribute SMART to\nDoran (1981), and observe that as an industry consultant,\nDoran made it explicit that \"in certain situations it is not real-\nistic to attempt quantification\" (cf. \"measurable\"), and that it\n\"can lose the benefit of a more abstract objective\" (quoted in\nMorrison, 2011). Doran's caution is vitally important in\nresearch communication, given the temptation to pursue\nmeasurable and achievable performance indicators in place\nof the less tangible and more challenging long-term societal\nimpacts desired in U.K. policy.\nIn the FP7 ORCHESTRA project (see \"Drawing Insight\nFrom Case Studies\", above) the team started by investigating\nthe current policy commitments, professional practices, and\nconcerns and priorities of policy makers and potential users.\nAs in many projects, it became clear from interviews and\ndiscussions that knowing how to use the research in practice\nwas only one small part of the challenge faced by practitio-\nners. Merely \"building awareness\" and providing informa-\ntion from the research was not the route to professional\nuptake. Instead, the project needed to investigate and address\nwider issues, including current user experience, confidence\nand concerns, reliability in practice, and issues around the\nregulatory demands debates and acceptance.\nSecond, it became clear that to \"influence policy makers\"\nor \"secure the commitment\" of some users, as the ESRC sug-\ngests, would merely increase the concerns of others, and so\nposition the project on one side of an unproductive debate.\nTo retain the integrity and value of the research, we needed\nto critically inform the debate, rather than just join it. Social\nand historical studies of both science and education have\nshown that it has been the trajectory of too many new meth-\nods and technologies to be overstated initially, and then dis-\ncredited when they are misapplied or used too widely or used\nwith insufficient scrutiny. So in this case, instead of promot-\ning use of the technology, our objective was to promote a\ncritical understanding of it and of its limitations to inform a\nwise and appropriate use.\nIn other words, a credible, effective, and professionally\nresponsible approach required a long-term view of impact,\nand required objectives and strategies directly counter to\nsimply \"maximizing impact\" in the short term. In each way,\nthe intellectual challenge of developing and clarifying objec-\ntives is of a different order from the simple self-determined\nprocess advocated by the ESRC guide.\nRearrangements and (Re)ordering of Actions\nQuestions like \"where do we start?\" \"what do we do next?\"\nand \"where are we heading?\" are likely to emerge during any\nunfamiliar communicative endeavor. Addressing them can\nbe a potentially vital part of any guide. Yet van Leeuwen\n(2008) argues that in representations of practice, \"elements\nof the social practice, insofar as they have a necessary order,\nmay be rearranged\" (p. 18). Representations can reverse\naction and reaction, as well as the chronological or rhetorical\nsequencing.\nAs its name suggests, the step-by-step guide offers an\nordered or sequenced account of research communication. It\nstates that the starting point is \"your research,\" \"your strat-\negy,\" and \"your objectives.\"\nThe first stage of developing your strategy is to set out a clear\nstatement of your objectives. This should link to your goals and\nhow you will evaluate the success. (ESRC, n.d.-b: Step-by-step\nguide: Setting objectives)\nThe subsequent steps further represent research commu-\nnication as a self-determined process of the researcher\n\"setting objectives,\" \"developing messages,\" \"targeting\naudiences,\" and \"choosing channels.\" The decisions and\nrationale for the actions of research communication all derive\nfrom the research and the researchers, rather than from the\nusers and the contexts of use (further analysis below).\nArguably, this functions as a \"regulatory discourse\"\nstructs the social relations in such a way that the researcher\nappears as the main (or sole) actor, and so appears responsi-\nble for the success or failure of the impact. However, it also\nrepresents and potentially encourages a kind of arrogance\nthat researchers and research policy would be wise to avoid\nif U.K. research is to engage other professionals.\nBy contrast, I would argue that it is only through investi-\ngations and dialogue that a researcher can develop a sense of\n(a) what the research might contribute to professional prac-\ntice and debate, (b) what may be seen as significant by prac-\ntitioners, and (c) what may be needed to make it useable in\npractice. As in the ORCHESTRA example (see previous sec-\ntion), a primary element in almost any research communica-\ntion process will be to investigate what practitioners are\nalready doing, the understandings and implicit or explicit\ntheories that inform their practice, and the current issues,\nconcerns, and debates.\nContrary to the guide, I regard it as a primary organizing\nprinciple for research communication, that interaction\ninform the planning, and come before production. That inter-\naction is not merely to research the \"audience\" to inform the\npresentation. It is actually about content: that interaction may\ngenerate further understanding, may identify new areas of\nsignificance, and may present new challenges for the research\nevidence. This interactive and investigative process can\nbecome \"a different kind of peer review\" (Pardoe & Mays,\n2012). It can vitally inform the objectives and strategies.\nCase study observations of research communication prac-\ntice can usefully help us to understand alternative, but no less\nrigorous, orderings. For example, in the ORCHESTRA proj-\nect the dissemination actions and outputs had to be proposed\nby partners prior to the contract (as is usual in EC proposals)\nwith no opportunity for face-to-face discussion. Within the\nlater discussions, I realized that our agreed actions and out-\nputs functioned as \"boundary objects\" (Leigh Star &\nGriesemer, 1989), with partners from different disciplines\nholding very different assumptions about what an output\nwould be and what purpose it would serve. It was only when\nactually organizing the event or collaboratively writing the\noutput, that the different assumptions became apparent. At\nthat stage, making good decisions required explicit and rea-\nsoned discussion about the function and form of each output:\nthe leaflet, the workshop, the video, etc.\nSuch an ordering of actions is actually the opposite of the\nsimple ordering assumed by the ESRC. Yet it has a clear\nrationale: Each media and genre (\"channel\") is effectively a\n\"semiotic resource\" (van Leeuwen, 2005, p. 3) that brings\npossibilities for what can be communicated and to whom.\nHaving proposed a leaflet or video, the team is able to imag-\nine and discuss together what could be communicated and\npotentially achieved by them. In other words, the planned\n\"output\" or \"channel\" provides a frame for then collabora-\ntively \"developing messages,\" and developing and refining\nthe \"objectives.\" This reverse ordering does not displace the\nESRC ordering; both may be evident and useful. But under-\nstanding it is vital to enable researchers to see the value and\nthe potential for creativity and intellectual rigor within their\nown ordering. If researchers only have the ESRC model in\nmind as the goal, they may view their own collaborative pro-\ncess merely in frustration, as being a result of cross-\ninstitutional misunderstanding and a failure to define their\nobjectives and messages first.\nEvaluations: The Concepts Offered to Guide and\nReview Communication\nIn the various literatures around research communication,\nthere is an often-cited and valuable distinction between the\n\"instrumental utilisation of research\" and the \"conceptual\nutilisation of research\" (Caplan, Morrison, & Stambaugh,\nAn often quoted development of this point from Weiss\nInstrumental use is often restricted to relatively low-level\ndecisions, where the stakes are small and users'interest relatively\nunaffected. Conceptual use . . . can gradually bring about major\nshifts in awareness and reorientation of basic perspectives.\nDavies et al. (2008) further emphasize the value of the\nusing research in conceptual ways\non the ground, research and other forms of knowledge are often\nused in more subtle, indirect and conceptual ways: bringing\nabout changes in knowledge and understanding, or shifts in\nperceptions, attitudes and beliefs, perhaps altering the ways in\nwhich policy-makers and practitioners think about what they do,\nhow they do it, and why. (p. 189)\nThis conceptual/instrumental distinction is itself a good\nexample of a concept that offers practical value. Having\nheard it, it becomes a way to think about formulating and\ncommunicating research ideas, and about what conceptual\nunderstanding may be necessary for any impact.\nGiven the diversity of U.K. social research, and the diver-\nsity of potential users, stakeholders, and contexts of use, it is\nlegitimate to ask what conceptual understanding of commu-\nnication is offered by the SSG. Table 1 therefore lists the\nconcepts offered to researchers to inform and evaluate their\n\"strategies,\" \"messages,\" \"language,\" and \"channels.\"\nTable 1. Concepts to Inform the Communication.\nConcepts to inform strategies,\nmessages and language use\nConcepts to inform the\nchannels of communication\nEffective 3 Regular/quarterly 2\nSuccinct 2 Occasional 1\nAppropriate 2 Audience preference/\naudience needs\nSpecific 1 Well placed (in\nmedia)\nOver-arching 1 Time and money 1\nTargeted 1 Active membership 1\nRight 1 Two-way\ncommunication\nAccessible 1 Building relationships 1\nCapture attention 1 \nFormats 1 \nStories 1 \nCase studies 1 \nPackages of info 1 \nconceptual understanding of how to achieve it or how to\njudge that it has been achieved.\nIn practice, to produce a \"succinct\" text for an unfamiliar\nreadership is likely to involve investigating the professional\nexpectations of the genre, and more specifically, what infor-\nmation can be assumed and what needs to be articulated for\nthose readers. That kind of interactive investigation is vital if\nthe research outputs are to have professional credibility, and\nnot be dismissed as, say, abstract, patronizing, useless, or\nunreadable.\nThe concept of \"appropriate\" texts and language has been\na focus of critique for many years (e.g., Fairclough, 1992a).\nWhat it actually means when applied to a particular commu-\nnication is highly cultural, institutional, and genre specific.\nThe advice to make a text \"appropriate\" raises familiar ques-\ntions, but answers none.\nIn this way, the guide appears to draw on a familiar and\nmuch-critiqued discourse of communication as \"decontextu-\nalised skills\" (Ivan\u00edc et al., 2009), as if one can engage in\n\"appropriate\" and \"effective\" communication simply guided\nby a universalized notion of \"clarity,\" without knowing or\ninvestigating the specialist genres and discourses of the pro-\nfessionals you want to communicate with.\nThe SSG does offer one example of how to \"ensure that\nthe language you use is appropriate for the audience\":\nFor example, the Institute for Social and Economic Research\npublished a report called The Impact of Atypical Employment on\nIndividual Wellbeing. The press release had the more accessible\ntitle of \"What Kind of Work is Bad for Your Health?\" The\nfirst line of the release summed up the research finding:\n\"Temporary jobs and part-time employment do not have adverse\nconsequences for people's health.\"\nWhile the original press release may have been wise, its\ninclusion as a single example of \"appropriate\" language is\nhighly problematic, especially without any concepts with\nwhich to review it. It is likely to reinforce the common notion\nthat researchers need to adopt a more \"tabloid\" discourse to\ncommunicate beyond academia and generate impact. There\nare no warnings about the consequences.\nI would argue that if publicly funded university research\nis to have impact, then it needs to retain the integrity and\nrigor that is its strength and core value. So any advice on\nmaking research engaging and accessible must, above all,\ninclude advice on monitoring whether the original research\nclaims have shifted in the process. In her classic article,\nFahnestock (1986) analyzed \"the fate of scientific observa-\ntions as they passed from original research reports intended\nfor scientific peers into popular accounts aimed at a general\naudience\" (p. 275). She identified significant transforma-\ntions in the apparent focus of the research and the scientific\nclaim (e.g., here from \"atypical employment\" to \"kind of\nwork,\" and from \"well being\" to \"bad for you\"). She observed\nthat scientific claims can become more certain within\nVan Leeuwen (2008) observes that representations of\nsocial and professional practices involve such representa-\ntions of what is \"good\" or \"bad\" or \"useful\" or \"interesting,\"\nand why (pp. 18-21). In this case, the SSG reader already\nknows that \"clear,\" \"effective,\" and \"accessible\" are good,\nbecause the opposites are clearly not good. These are com-\nmon sense goals. What is absent is any basis for achieving\nthem. For example, the need to be \"succinct\" is obvious; the\nchallenge for researchers is how to achieve it for a particular\ntext and a particular audience. What is \"succinct\" in a report\nis not succinct in a leaflet. What may be a succinct report for\nan experienced practitioner may be inaccessible to a manager\nor policy maker. Yet each term is offered without any\npopularizations, as the theoretical perspectives, experimental\nconstraints, and elements of context are put aside in favor of\nsimply reporting a finding.\nThe ORCHESTRA project showed repeatedly the funda-\nmental socio-linguistic point that changing the language\nchanges the meaning. To increase the \"clarity,\" \"relevance,\"\nand \"accessibility\" of research findings often involves\nrequesting further conceptual clarity from the researchers. To\nensure that every statement is wise as well as true then\nrequires an iterative process that is (a) grounded in the\nresearch and (b) highly attentive to the implications of lexi-\ncal and grammatical changes. Without this, the pursuit of\nmore engaging outputs can mislead potential users and risk\nfatally undermining the integrity of the research.\nSubstitutions: The Representation of Policy\nMakers, Practitioners, and Publics\nSubstitution is described by van Leeuwen (2008) as \"the\nmost fundamental transformation\" (p. 17). Participants and\nactions can be particularized or generalized, aggregated or\nnominated in ways that can transform their apparent rela-\ntions and identities.\nIn the SSG, the researcher is individualized and activated\nas \"you\" with responsibility for all actions. At the same time,\nthe policy makers, industries, practitioners, and publics who\nmay use the research (and/or benefit or lose by its use) are all\naggregated and passivated. Of 58 references to other people,\n29 represent them as an \"audience.\" Indeed, 65% of all refer-\nences to other people define them solely in their relation to\n\"your research\" (Table 2, left column).\nThe right column shows the only groups identified spe-\ncifically by profession. (An additional linked pdf page sim-\nply lists sector categories such as \"Large business,\" \"SMEs,\"\n\"Senior Civil Servants,\" and \"Trade unions.\")\nOf these, MPs and journalists are two professions that can\ncreate visibility at government level for ESRC-funded\nresearch, and so may influence policy. A new section\nappeared in the toolkit in early 2012 on \"Taking the research\nto Westminster\" and \"Contact[ing] government organisa-\ntions.\" Yet a focus on them represents a potentially centrist,\ntop-down view of innovation and professional change. It is\nalso highly problematic in terms of achieving informed and\nwise impact for the U.K., since MPs and journalists are at\nleast one step removed from the detail of most professional\npractice.\nTaking U.K. university research directly to MPs and jour-\nnalists risks bypassing vital peer review from experienced\npractitioners. From experience, I would argue that profes-\nsionals in fields relevant to the use of the research are a vital\nsource of insight--about whether and how the research could\nbe useful in practice, what problems, concerns, and questions\nthere will be, and what might need to be communicated for\npeople to understand it. Practitioners are potentially the most\nable to trial it, challenge it, refine it, and initiate its use.\nThe SSG contains no reference to such dialogue with\npractitioners. There is nothing on what the researcher might\ngain or learn from them, or on the ways in which different\n\"audiences\" might use different aspects of the research in\ndifferent ways. This omission in the SSG contrasts with the\nESRC demand, for example, that\nby considering impact from the outset, we expect you to\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Explore who could potentially benefit from your work\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Look at how you can increase the chances of potential ben-\neficiaries benefiting from your work. (ESRC, n.d.-b: What\nthe ESRC expects)\nThese two investigative actions are fundamental to any\nprocess of research communication. The first is arguably the\nstarting point that should inform any impact objectives. So\none might expect a step-by-step guide to offer strategies for\nsuch investigations, and for drawing insight from them.\nSubstitutions: The Representation of\nCommunicative Actions\nThe page headings of the SSG represent the communicative\nprocess as \"setting objectives\" to deliver \"messages\" to\n\"audiences\" through \"channels.\" In the detail, the communi-\ncative process is similarly represented as material actions:\ndoing things. Table 3 lists the frequency of finite processes\nthat represent what a researcher does or says to (or with or\nfor) the \"audiences\" and other people.\nThere are no interactive processes like \"discuss\" or \"ask\"\nor even \"explain.\" Communication is represented as a\nmechanical process of information management, or \"shunt-\ning information\" (Smith, 1985), rather than generating inter-\naction and understanding. (The single reference to \"consider\"\nis the only finite process that explicitly represents a response\nto what the other people may say; \"two-way communica-\ntion\" is mentioned once as a noun.)\nTable 2. Representations of Those To/With Whom the\nResearcher Communicates.\nAudience 29 Organizations/individuals/\neveryone\nWho / those who may\nhave an interest\n3 MP; Backbench MPs;\nMPs' researchers\nYour contacts 3 Researchers 2\nUser groups 1 Journalists 2\npotential beneficiaries 1 Policy makers 2\nGatekeepers to your\naudiences\n CEOs and personal assistants 2\n Umbrella body and members 2\n Partner bodies 1\nTable 4. All Actions by Others.\nAccording to the guide, other people:\nBenefit 2 Take notice (of your work) 1\nPrefer 2 Read (your work) 1\nMay not remember 1 Tell you 1\nSuffer from info\noverload\n1 Determine whether your material\never reaches ...\nAre overloaded 1 Capture attention (of others) 1\nConsistent with this, the actions also passivate others as\nrecipients of activity or as being subjected to it. For example,\n\"journalists are worth cultivating too.\" The only actions\n(finite processes) for which other people are the agents are\nshown in Table 4, column 2, yet in each case their actions are\nreactions, and solely in relation to the research. (The acti-\nvated process in the right column is associated only with\nMPs, MPs' researchers, and CEO's assistants, discussed\nabove.)\nThere are pages elsewhere in the toolkit that can at first\nappear to counter this passivation of others. For example, a\npage alongside the SSG, titled \"How to maximise impact,\"\ncalls for \"establishing networks and relationships with\nresearch users,\" for \"involving users at all stages of the\nresearch,\" and for \"well planned public engagement and\nknowledge exchange strategies\" as \"key factors that are\nvital.\" This sounds like it is advocating dialogue. However, it\nremains consistent with the SSG: first, it gives all agency to\n\"you\", the researcher, and second, it offers no indication of\nwhat you may learn from doing it.\nThe reality of any research communication process is that\nthe potential users and other key \"audiences\" are likely to be\nalready informed by extensive professional experience, and\npossibly by other research. They will have well-established\ninstitutional practices, professional debates, current contro-\nversies, and concerns, and they may have commitments to\nexisting policies. All of that forms the context and the real\nchallenge of research communication.\nYet there is nothing in the SSG to prepare you for this. It\nimplicitly reproduces a view of research communication, and\nmore broadly of science and society, that has been much cri-\nwhich the professional and public worlds are unknowing,\nseparate from the research world, and a blank slate waiting to\nreceive the research.\nLegitimating the Guide and the Demand to\n\"Maximize Impact\"\nFinally, I turn to the issue of legitimation. Van Leeuwen\n(2008) argues that \"texts not only represent social practices,\nthey also explain and legitimate (or delegitimate, critique)\nthem.\" Texts explain (or assume) why a social or profes-\nsional practice \"must take place in the way that it does\" (p.\n20). In analyzing the SSG, I suggest it is useful to explore\nhow it legitimates (a) itself and (b) the demand for every\nresearch project to \"maximize impact.\"\nFor the guide itself, one source of legitimation is the use\nof an all-knowing expert voice: The categorical statements\nappear to know the problems \"you\" will face, and how to\naddress them. It is self-evidently in \"your\" interest to follow\nthe advice:\nAn effective strategy needs to have . . . ;\nit is worth . . . ; it is useful to . . . ; it is important to . . .;\nIn order to . . . you need to . . .\nA further source of legitimacy is simply that the advice\noffered is so basic that, in van Leeuwen's (2008) terms, it\nappears to be \"common sense and in little need of legitima-\nYet categorical claims and imperatives (like \"avoid using\n. . . ,\" \"ensure that . . . \" \"find out . . . ,\" and \"don't assume . .\n. \") usually need a further source of legitimation. In this case,\nit is provided implicitly by the role and status of the institu-\ntional author, the ESRC. This author has the ultimate power\nof judging \"your\" funding applications. So their advice is an\nindication of what will get research proposals funded. Indeed,\nin procedural terms, it can be useful for the ESRC-funded\nresearcher if the advice is singular and categorical.\nIt is therefore vital to recognize that this guide is not a\nmodel of the \"clear\" and \"succinct\" communication that\na social science researcher might use. Instead, it relies on a\nrelationship of authority; one that is in marked contrast to the\nrelationship between researchers and potential users of their\nTable 3.

When seeking to generate impact from research,\nresearchers usually have no decision-making role: like a con-\nsultant, they can only advise and suggest. In fact, they are\nlikely to be in the difficult role of an uninvited consultant,\nwho first needs to explain why other professionals should\neven want to hear about the research. That challenge can be\na source of considerable anxiety for researchers, yet it is not\naddressed here.\nPerhaps the most interesting observation in terms of legit-\nimacy is the ESRC's departure from academic and scientific\npractice. Within research, a traditional source of legitimacy\nis to cite and build on what others have said and done before.\nIn social science, legitimacy also involves offering empirical\nevidence of some kind. Those are the professional practices\nof the intended readers of this guide. As a research funder,\nthe ESRC usually insists on such practices. Moreover, there\nis a huge amount of research available to inform this guide.\nYet the ESRC breaks with academic practice, to offer no\nresearch insights or evidence. There are no social science ref-\nerences. Even in a policy document outside academia, we\ncould expect some support and referencing. In this case it\nappears that the institutional power of the author, and the\ncommon sense nature of the advice, make research and evi-\ndence unnecessary.\nThe ESRC guide and toolkit thereby place the practice of\nresearch communication, and the ESRC's process of guiding\nit, outside usual academic practice. Research communication\nis represented as not being a focus for intellectual interest or\ndebate. It is not something to be informed collectively by\nbuilding research insight. Instead, the guide can just describe\nwhat \"you\" need to do. In this way, the guide is more similar\nto a \"You can do it too\" manual from a DIY store, than a\nrealistic or informed account of the cross-institutional com-\nmunication of research.\nAn alternative approach could have been to make research\ncommunication intellectually attractive to researchers. The\nguidance could have concisely summarized at least some of\nthe academic insights which point to the challenges of\nresearch communication and which reveal it as an intellectu-\nally interesting activity. The equivalent guide from the EC\n(2010) does so. The ESRC guide could build on the tradi-\ntions of participatory and action research in the social sci-\nences, to inform a process of creating productive relationships\nwith stakeholders and potential users. Yet the ESRC chooses\nnot to do so.\nFinally, I turn to our second question of how the guide\nlegitimates the policy demand for every project to \"maximize\nimpact.\" This is the demand for impact generation to become\n\"a permanent core activity in universities\" (HM Treasury,\n2004, p. 76). The answer would appear to be precisely in sim-\nplistic nature of the advice. The representation of research\ncommunication as a series of self-evident and easy tasks,\nneeding only common sense strategies, makes impact appear\nachievable in practice within existing funding. The mislead-\ning deletion of complexity is potentially functional.\nIf the ESRC had drawn on the available literature and\noffered a fuller understanding of research communication\nand impact generation in practice, it would risk pointing to\nthe \"largely insurmountable challenges\" (Davies et al., 2008,\np. 189). Instead, the ESRC discourse echoes the commercial\ncompanies minimize the apparent task: You \"just\" do this.\nAs if anticipating this guide, van Leeuwen (2008) observes\nthat \"some texts are almost entirely about legitimation . . .\nand make only rudimentary reference to the social practices\nthey legitimise\" (p. 20).\nConcluding Comments\nIn this article, I have suggested a three-point agenda for\nsocial science to inform the cross-institutional communica-\ntion of research as a rapidly growing area of professional\nacademic practice. I have illustrated the need for a funda-\nmental critique of the current guidance discourse by analyz-\ning the ESRC's step-by-step guide. By contrasting the ESRC\nguide with brief examples from a single project, I have\nshown that the practical and conceptual challenges in\nresearch communication are of a different intellectual order\nto those in the guide.\nIronically, the guide provides a good example of why the\nuptake of research, and the connecting of research and prac-\ntice, is not just about making research accessible or avail-\nable. The guide is written by the U.K. organization whose\nfunction is to promote the use of social science research, and\nwhich has unique access to the body of research and to schol-\narly advice. It nevertheless chooses to put all this aside in\nfavor of informing a U.K. shift in professional practice on\nthe basis of a naively rationalist common sense discourse. It\ncan even seem functional to do so.\nA major challenge when communicating with policy\nmakers and practitioners is precisely to make the case that\nresearch insight may be useful in practice. It often involves\nstruggling with a dominant professional ideology that prac-\ntice is simply common sense, and that it is better guided by\nthe common sense of managers without reference to research.\nThis is a particular challenge for social scientists, where the\nfindings are not technologies or facts with self-evident value,\nbut may instead involve questioning the ways in which\nthings are currently understood. For example, generating\nimpact can be a challenge for researchers in applied linguis-\ntics, because common sense views of language and commu-\nnication are so powerful and problematic. It is therefore both\nironic and dispiriting to observe it within the ESRC\nguidance.\nSo does the guide matter? As always, practitioners may\nrealize the guidance is inadequate, and may draw on other\ninsights and develop their understanding from reflective\npractice to achieve some success. That is very likely in the\ncase of communicating research and generating impact.\nHowever, I suggest the inadequacy does matter in practice.\nFirst, it matters within the culture of universities.\nSeparating this vital activity from academic debate, and rep-\nresenting it as simple common sense, only serves to give it\nlow status in relation to research. Focusing the purposes and\nactions on bureaucratic and procedural demands separates\nand undermines it further. There is an already pervasive\nassumption that research communication happens after the\nintellectual work of research, rather than constituting part of\nthat work. This guide appears to confirm it. It therefore\nundervalues the intellectual work carried out by anyone who\ngenuinely wants to engage with practitioners and policy\nmakers to communicate their research. It is an example of\nhow to undermine and disengage the key actors on whom the\nwider use of U.K. research depends.\nSecond, it matters outside the university, in industry, pol-\nicy, and public arenas. In each part of the analysis above, I\nhave suggested that if the guide were actually followed, it\nwould risk producing uninformed actions that lack credibil-\nity among the intended \"audiences,\" and risk undermining\nthe integrity and rigor of the research. Moreover, the lack of\nstatus of the activity, the focus solely on the researchers'own\nobjectives, the lack of any recognition of the value of practi-\ntioner review, and the view of professionals simply as receiv-\ning \"audiences\" will not go unnoticed by those \"audiences.\"\nThe focus on quick visibility with politicians and journalists,\nrather than engaging with the complexities of practice, can\nonly undermine it further. In each way, the guidance can\nactually undermine the policy of maximizing the impact of\nsocial science research.\nThird, it matters within the funding councils themselves\nand the wider U.K. policy, because it institutionalizes an\nattractive and reductive understanding of research communi-\ncation among those who influence funding. The evident dan-\nger of institutionalizing such a simplistic view is that the\nESRC reviewers of research proposals may not recognize the\ndangers and the sheer inadequacy of proposals that merely\npromise to write to MPs and \"get the existing information to\neveryone for very little cost.\" Consequently, they may reject\nas \"over-evaluated\" and too costly, those proposals that rec-\nognize the challenges and that realistically cost the intellec-\ntual and practical work needed to distill the research in new\nways, engage with practitioners, and investigate current\npractices, concerns, and debates. If so, such funding deci-\nsions will run directly counter to achieving the goal of\nenabling social science research to contribute to society and\nthe economy.\nAuthor's Note\nEarlier versions of this analysis were presented at the ESRC confer-\nence \"Bridging the Gap Between Research, Policy and Practice\"\n(Pardoe, 2011a), and at the interdisciplinary conference on \"Applied\nLinguistics and Professional Practice\" (Pardoe, 2011b).
