This article estimates the percentage of lineages that include four or more generations for a sample of the\nU.S. population and explores how social status and race are related to lineage depth.\nMethods. We assembled data from Waves 1 and 2 of the National Survey of Families and Households in order to\nestimate the proportion of adults in four or more generations for the Wave 2 sample (1992\u00ad1994). When necessary, we\nused various decision rules to overcome an absence of information about specific generations. We examine relationships\nbetween lineage depth and sociodemographic variables by using logistic regressions.\nResults. The data show that 32% of the respondents were in lineages comprising four or more generations. Blacks and\nindividuals of lower social class were more likely to be in four-generation lineages, especially shorter-gapped lineages.\nWhites and individuals of higher social class were not more likely to be in longer-gapped, four-generation lineages.\nDiscussion. The majority of the adult population in the early 1990s was in three-generation lineages. The verdict is still\nout on whether population aging results in the wholesale verticalization of lineages. Social differentials in four-generation\nlineages in the early 1990s were mainly due to differences in the timing of fertility, rather than mortality.\nBENGTSON, Rosenthal, and Burton (1990) argued that the\n``demographic revolution'' has led to an increase in the\nnumber and proportion of families characterized by a ``bean\npole family structure'' or ``verticalization,'' defined as lineages\nthat comprise four or five living generations with each\ngeneration having few members (p. 264). More recently,\nBengtson, Lowenstein, Putney, and Gans (2003, p. 2) wrote,\n``We have added a whole generation to the structure of many\nfamilies.'' The belief that ``verticalization'' characterizes\ncurrent lineages is so strong that George and Gold (1991,\np. 72) conclude that it ``is probably the most consistent and\nimportant change in family structure during the past century.''\nMost of the evidence to support these contentions, however,\nrelies on simulations of intergenerational ties (e.g., Cherlin,\nthat families now routinely comprise four and five generations\nis widespread despite the fact that the limited empirical\nevidence suggests that even four-generation families are\nUhlenberg & Kirby, 1998; Winsborough, Bumpass, &\nAquilino, 1991). The first goal of this article, then, is to\nascertain the best estimation of the percentage of lineages\nthat include at least four generations from the perspective\nof a representative sample of adults in the U.S. population.\nThis article also explores social differentials as explanatory\nfactors in lineage depth. Mortality and timing of fertility are\nresponsible for lineage depth. It is well understood that in the\nprocess of demographic transition, declining mortality increases\nthe probability of four- or even five-generation lineages.\nHowever, disparities in mortality persist between different\nsocial groups. Research consistently shows educational differ-\nentials in mortality among men and women and among Whites\nand Blacks in the United States. College graduates have lower\nage-specific mortality rates than do high school graduates in both\nthe general level and specific causes of death (Elo & Preston,\n1996). Such inequality may be attributed to income inequality,\naccess to health care, health behaviors, or other psychosocial\nfactors (Kaplan, Seeman, Cohen, Knudsen, & Guralnik, 1987).\nMortality rates are also higher for Blacks than Whites at virtually\nall ages (Smaje, 2000). Elo and Preston reported that individ-\nual socioeconomic status accounted for only part of Black\ndisadvantage. Community characteristics, such as racial segre-\ngation and poverty, also contribute to racial gaps in mortality\n(LeClere, Rogers, & Peters, 1997). In light of such social\ndifferentials in mortality, people of higher socioeconomic status\nshould expect to have a greater probability of being in four- or\nhigher-order lineages. Similarly, proportionately more Whites\nthan Blacks should expect to be in such lineages.\nAlthough the relationship between the timing of fertility and\nrelated social differentials has been well documented in the\nliterature, researchers pay less attention to its role in forming\ngreat-depth lineages than they do to the role of mortality.\nEducation is found to be persistently associated with the timing\nof fertility in the United States. Using data from Current Social\nSurvey, Rindfuss, Morgan, and Offutt (1996) reported that\nwomen with college degrees postpone childbearing: During the\ngroup occurred after age 30. The desire for career-type jobs and\nreliance on paid childcare played major roles in this shift. But\nsuch a pattern was not observed among lesser educated women,\nwho had children at relatively young ages. Chen and Morgan\n(1991) also documented that the trend in the substantial delay\nof first births since 1979 only held for Whites and not for\nnon-Whites. The White/non-White divergence is dramatic and\nsustained and cannot be accounted for solely by educational\nattainment. A separate study based on a national sample of\nadolescents aged 15\u00ad16 found that Black respondents were\nabout four times more likely than White respondents to have\nJournal of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES Copyright 2006 by The Gerontological Society of America\never had sexual intercourse (Furstenberg, Morgan, Moore, &\nPeterson, 1987). Such race differences in the timing of sexual\ninitiation and fertility are affected by social norms, family\nbackground (such as parents' education), neighborhood\nsocioeconomic status, labor market experiences, school envi-\nHogan, Sun, & Cornwell, 2000). Consequently, in contrast to\nthe expectations related to mortality, people of lower\nsocioeconomic status can expect to have a greater likelihood\nof being in great-depth lineages given their shorter age intervals\nbetween generations. Similarly, Blacks are more likely than\nWhites to be in great-depth lineages.\nSocioeconomic status and race seem to be associated with\nmortality and the timing of fertility in a way that conversely\naffects the likelihood of being in a great-depth lineage.\nHowever, the mechanisms by which great-depth lineages are\nformed are different for Whites and for people of higher\nsocioeconomic status (for whom great-depth lineages are likely\nto stem from longer survival of older generations) than for\nBlacks and for people of lower socioeconomic status (for\nwhom earlier addition of younger generations is likely to be\nthe cause). As a result, one would expect that Whites and\nindividuals of higher socioeconomic status would tend to be in\ngreat-depth lineages that have longer age intervals between\ngenerations, whereas Blacks and individuals of lower socio-\neconomic status would tend to be in great-depth lineages with\nshorter age intervals. The overall differentials in the prevalence\nof great-depth lineages between social groups should be a net\nresult of these two competing mechanisms.\nThree research questions are addressed in this paper: (a)\nWhat percentage of lineages comprised four or more gen-\nerations in the U.S. population in the early 1990s from the\nperspective of adults aged 22 and older? (b) Are social\ncharacteristics (social class, race, and family background)\nassociated with lineage depth? and (c) Is early fertility or\ndelayed mortality a better explanation of great-depth lineages?\nMETHODS\nData Source\nInformation available from the National Survey of Families\nrespondents interviewed during Wave 2 (Sweet & Bumpass,\n1996). We defined the lineage depth from the perspective of\nrespondents. Ascending generations included respondents'\nparents, grandparents, and great-grandparents from both the\nfather's and the mother's sides. Descending generations included\nrespondents' biological and adopted children, grandchildren,\nand great-grandchildren. The respondent, not the lineage, was\nthe unit of analysis. It is likely that someone in an ascendant\ngeneration would report a larger number of generations in his or\nher lineage. A respondent may have no descendents, for example,\nbut, if his or her sibling does, from their parents' perspective the\nlineage would include more descendant generations.\nIn order to determine the proportion of respondents whose\nlineages comprise at least four generations, we required\ninformation about the existence of someone in all of the\ngenerations mentioned in the preceding paragraph. In both\nWaves 1 and 2 of the NSFH, respondents were asked to provide\ninformation about their parents, children, and grandchildren.\nFor approximately half of the respondents who had at least\none living parent at Wave 2, a parent was interviewed and asked\nabout the survival of the respondent's grandparents. Compara-\nble information was unavailable for respondents whose parents\nwere not interviewed. Even for parents who were interviewed,\nno information about great-grandparents was collected. Looking\ndown the lineage, no questions were asked about great-\ngrandchildren. These limitations made it necessary for us to\nmake educated guesses about whether respondents with miss-\ning information had living grandparents, great-grandparents,\nor great-grandchildren.\nEstimating the Prevalence of Four-Generation Lineages\nThe lineage types into which the Wave 2 respondents were\ninitially classified take into account uncertainty about the\nexistence of specific generations. To facilitate discussion, we\nassigned a lineage code to each lineage type (see Table 1). Each\nquestion mark in the table indicates the possible existence of an\nascending or descending generation, the result of a living parent\nTable 1.

The dotted arrow lines indicate the route of estimation; the solid\narrow lines represent the route on which the estimation was based.\naThe estimated number of four-generation lineages based on the methods\ndiscussed.\nbThe question mark results from the fact that respondents reported that\nthey did not know whether their parents were living.\nnot being interviewed or the absence of a requisite question in\nthe survey instruments. Using only information directly avail-\nable from the NSFH, we classified 8,203 of the respondents\n(82%) as having fewer than four generations; for 6,131 of these\n(75%), at least one lineage is represented by a question mark.\nThese respondents had the potential to be in at least a four-\ngeneration lineage.\nWe used evidence obtained from both the respondents\nand the interviewed parents to estimate the number of three-\ngeneration-or-fewer lineage types that was likely to include\nat least one member in generations represented in Table 1 by\nquestion marks. Table 1 shows the estimation method for\neach lineage; the dotted line points to the estimate to be made\nand the solid line refers to the distribution base on which we\nmade the estimate.\nRespondents in Lineage Code 31, for example, had no\nchildren but had at least one parent, at least one grandparent,\nand a question mark for the great-grandparent generation\n(because respondents with living parents were not asked about\ngreat-grandparents nor were their interviewed parents asked\nabout grandparents). To estimate the number of the respondents\nwho had great-grandparents, we determined the percentage of\nthe respondents at each chronological age who had grand-\nparents and assumed that living parents of the same age had the\nsame number of grandparents. In other words, we assumed the\nage-specific likelihood for parents having a grandparent to be\nthe same as that for respondents having a grandparent. We then\ncross-multiplied the frequency of parents for each chronolog-\nical age by the corresponding proportion for respondents who\nhad at least one surviving grandparent and summed the cross-\nproducts to obtain an overall frequency of four-generation\nfamilies for this lineage type.\nFor Lineage Code 32, we estimated the number of the\nrespondents' parents who had at least one living parent. We\nbased this estimate on the age-specific frequency distribution\nof parents and the age-specific frequency distribution of the\nrespondents who had at least one surviving parent, thus\nforming a four-generation lineage. For Lineage Code 33, the\npossibility of forming a four-generation lineage lies in the\nrespondents having great-grandchildren. Here we assumed\nthe age-specific likelihood of oldest children of respondents\nhaving a grandchild to be the same as that of respondents.\nFor Lineage Code 34, which has the potential to be a four-\ngeneration lineage from both ascending and descending\ngenerations, we adopted a combination of the decision rules\napplied above.\nAlthough there are only two generations reported for Lineage\nCode 21, because some of the respondents' parents were not\ninterviewed, there is a possibility that respondents' grand-\nparents and great-grandparents were still alive. We applied\nthe decision rule used for Lineage Code 31 to estimate this\nlikelihood. Similarly, for Lineage Code 23, if respondents'\ngrandparents were alive, the respondents' lineage would\ncomprise four generations. Based on the age-specific distribu-\ntion for respondents with at least one grandparent among\nthose whose parents were interviewed, we estimated the\nlikelihood of having a surviving grandparent for those\nrespondents whose parents were not interviewed. No\nestimates were made for one-generation lineages (Lineage\nCodes 11 and 12) or for lineages that included skipped\ngenerations (Lineage Codes 81, 82, and 83), although they are\nshown in Table 1.\nLinking Lineage Depth to Sociodemographic\nCharacteristics\nUnlike the previous estimates, which moved some rather than\nspecific respondents from one lineage type to another, the\nexamination of associations between lineage type and socio-\ndemographic variables required that each respondent be\nclassified. For both ascending and descending generations,\nwhen information did not extend far enough, we used age to\nmake educated guesses about the likelihood of there being\na living member in a particular generation.\nFocusing first on ascending generations, we assumed that\npeople who were aged 75 or older were the oldest generation\nin a lineage. This assumption is supported by two empirical\ndistributions in the sample: (1) Less than 1% of respondents\naged 75 or older had a living parent; and, (2) of respondents'\nparents aged 75 and older who were interviewed, only 4% had\na living parent. Based on the fact that only 3% of respondents\nolder than age 50 whose parents were interviewed had a\ngrandparent, we assumed that people older than age 50 who had\nliving parents did not have grandparents. For descending\ngenerations, we assumed that respondents whose oldest child\nwas aged 15 or younger did not have grandchildren. We based\nthis decision on the fact that none of the respondents' children\nhad a child before age 15 and that less than 2% of respondents'\nchildren aged 16 or younger had a child.\nBy applying these decision rules, we assigned 2,131\nrespondents in lineage types with question marks into one of\ntwo categories: (1) at least four generations or (2) less than four\nlineage types with complete information, we brought the total\noriginal sample). Compared with those excluded from this\nanalysis, respondents in the smaller, second sample were\nyounger, had more education, and included more men, more\nWhites, and more unmarried persons.\nIn order to examine how race and social status are associated\nwith different types of four-generation lineages, we further\ncategorized four-generation lineages into shorter-gapped and\nlonger-gapped lineages by using the age of the oldest member\nof each generation and calculating the age intervals between\nany two adjacent generations. For each lineage (which may\ninvolve two or three intervals depending on the number of\ngenerations), we calculated an average age interval. In order to\nguard against our analysis being an artifact of a specific choice,\nwe used the first, second, and third quartiles of the average\ninterval for this sample as thresholds to define shorter- and\nlonger-gapped lineages. For example, by using the first quartile,\nwe classified all the lineages with an average age interval below\nthe first quartile as shorter gapped and the other four-generation\nlineages as longer gapped.\nWe coded race in four categories: White, Black, Hispanic,\nand other. We used the respondent's educational attainment\n(less than high school, high school, some college, bachelor's\ndegree or higher) to measure current social class. Measures\nof social class background included father's and mother's\neducational attainment (less than high school, high school,\nsome college, bachelor's degree or higher, no answer) and\nwhether the respondent's family had ever received any form of\npublic assistance when the respondent was growing up (yes,\nno). Sociodemographic characteristics used as control variables\nmarital status (currently married, divorced, widowed, never\nmarried). We report frequency distributions for these variables\nin Table 2.\nWe used a logistic regression to examine how lineage depth\n(four generations or more vs fewer than four generations) was\nassociated with sociodemographic characteristics. We applied\nmultinomial logistic regressions to model three possible\noutcomes: being in a shorter-gapped, four-generation lineage;\nbeing in a longer-gapped, four-generation lineage; and being\nin a non\u00adfour-generation lineage. We applied weights for\nrespondents to all the statistical analyses.\nRESULTS\nThe Prevalence of Four-Generation Lineages\nColumn Four of Table 1 presents the estimated number of\nfour-generation lineages for the entire sample of respondents.\nNo estimates were necessary for Lineage Codes 41, 42, 43, and\n51; the numbers are identical to the original frequencies, which\nare presented in Column Three. From the remaining lineage\ntypes, an additional 1,429 were estimated to comprise at least\nfour generations, for a total of 3,230. This accounts for 32% of\nthe total sample. By using the decision rules discussed in the\nMethods section, we categorized approximately one third of the\nrespondents in the sample as members of lineages comprising\nfour generations or more.\nLineage Depth and Sociodemographic Characteristics\nWe present the associations between lineage depth and socio-\ndemographic characteristics in the form of cross-tabulations in\nTable 2. To save space, we only present the results on shorter-\nand longer-gapped lineages when the second quartile is used as\nthe threshold. Blacks overall were more likely than Whites to\nbe in four-generation lineages (34% vs 29%). The decompo-\nsition of these lineages revealed two opposite associations:\nAlthough Blacks were more likely than Whites to be in shorter-\ngapped lineages (22% vs 14%), Whites were more likely than\nBlacks to be in longer-gapped lineages (15% vs 11%).\nHispanics and people of other ethnic groups had overall lower\nprobabilities of being in four-generation lineages.\nGenerally speaking, higher levels of respondent educa-\ntion were associated with a lower probability of being in\nfour-generation lineages. This pattern is more apparent for\nshorter-gapped lineages: the percentage of respondents in\nshorter-gapped four-generation lineages declined from 22%\nfor those without a high school diploma to 5% for those with\nat least a bachelor's degree. Except for a reverse at the level of\nat least a bachelor's degree, the results also show that higher\nlevels of respondent education were associated with a higher\nprobability of being in longer-gapped lineages. These findings\nhold true for the associations between father's and mother's\neducation, and lineage depth. Ever receiving public assistance\nas a child was related to an overall higher probability of being\nin four-generation lineages, an even greater likelihood of being\nin shorter-gapped lineages, but a lower probability of being in\nlonger-gapped lineages.\nOf the controlled demographic factors, respondents aged\n50\u00ad59 had the highest percentage of being in four-generation\nlineages (both shorter and longer gapped), followed by the three\nyounger age groups, without substantial differences in the\noverall prevalence. The lowest percentage in four-generation\nlineages was for respondents aged 75 or older. Women were\nmore likely than men to be in any type of four-generation\nlineage. The married had the highest probability of being in\nTable 2.

These patterns, however, are cross-tabulations that\ndo not control for covariates.\nTable 3 shows the results of a logistic regression on the\nlikelihood of belonging to any four-generation lineage regardless\nof generational gap. The results largely confirm the aforemen-\ntioned findings, except that the family background measures\n(father's and mother's education, and ever receiving public\nassistance) were not significantly associated with lineage depth.\nThis may be attributed to the correlation between family\nbackground and respondents' own characteristics or to the mix\nof both shorter- and longer-gapped, four-generation lineages into\none category, which may obscure the effects of these variables.\nTable 4 presents the results of multinomial logistic regressions\non three outcomes of the lineage variable (in a shorter-gapped,\nfour-generation lineage; in a longer-gapped, four-generation\nlineage; with in a non\u00adfour-generation lineage as the reference).\nThree models based on the first (22.00 years), second\nage interval as the threshold were included.\nAlthough the results varied from model to model, the effects\nof race and respondents' education were similar. Compared\nwith Whites, Blacks were more likely to be in shorter-gapped,\nfour-generation lineages than in non\u00adfour-generation lineages.\nHowever, Whites were not associated with a higher probability\nthan Blacks of being in longer-gapped, four-generation\nlineages. In fact, the first model shows that Blacks were more\nlikely than Whites to be in longer-gapped, four-generation\nlineages. Respondent education was conversely related to the\npossibility of being in a shorter-gapped, four-generation\nlineage. The pattern echoes what is presented in Table 2.\nPersons with a high school degree and those with some college\neducation were not statistically different from individuals with\nless than high school education when it came to being in\nlonger-gapped, four-generation lineages. However, persons\nwith a bachelor's degree or higher were significantly associated\nwith a lower--rather than higher--probability of being in such\nlineages.\nThe results were mixed for family background measures.\nHigher level of father's education seemed to be related to\na greater likelihood of being in longer-gapped, four-generation\nlineages, but such a relationship only holds up to the level of\nsome college. There is some evidence that respondents whose\nmother had a higher level of education--especially bachelor's\ndegree or higher--were less likely to be in shorter-gapped,\nfour-generation lineages, which was similar to the effect of\nrespondents' own education. The association between ever\nreceiving public assistance and lineage depth is only significant\nin the second model, in which receiving public assistance is\nassociated with a greater likelihood of being in shorter-gapped,\nfour-generation lineages.\nThe associations between demographic variables (age, gender,\nmarital status) and lineage depth were largely consistent across\nthe three models and reflect the patterns shown in Table 2.\nDISCUSSION\nThe first goal of this analysis was to determine what\nproportion of respondents in a representative sample of the\nadult population was in a lineage comprising at least four\ngenerations. Our estimate is that in the early 1990s, 32% of\nrespondents aged 22 or older in a representative sample of the\nU.S. population were in such lineages. This percentage is\na sample of individuals aged 19 or older in the Boston\nmetropolitan area in the mid-1980s. It is considerably higher\nthan the 2.4% reported by Farkas and Hogan (1995) for people\naged 18 and older for a pooled sample of adults in seven\nFarkas and Hogan considered only adult children and grand-\nchildren and did not estimate the likelihood of four generations\nTable 3.

The inclusion of countries\nwith very low birth rates (e.g., Germany and Italy) undoubtedly\nalso contributed to their much lower estimate. Soldo and Hill\nU. S. sample aged 51\u00ad61 were in lineages that comprised at\nleast four generations. In the present sample, this age category\nhad the highest proportion in four-generation lineages, although\nour percentage was lower than Soldo and Hill's (37% for the\nsecond sample). The difference can be explained in part by the\nfact that Soldo and Hill included respondents' parents-in-law.\nFor a study of three-generation families in France, Attias-\nbetween the ages of 49 and 52. Of these, 60% reported having\nat least one living parent and one adult child. Although Attias-\nDonfut reported that 45% of the respondents were in four-\ngeneration families, slightly less than one third of those in\nthree-generation lineages were included in the next phase of the\nstudy and it is not clear from her report whether the smaller\ngroup of respondents was representative. The comparable\nfigure for this age category from the NSFH for our smaller\nin the United States, four generations or more was not the\nstatistical norm. According to figures presented in Table 1, the\nnorm was three-generation lineages, the category that captured\n44% of the respondents even after a portion of the respondents\nTable 4.

For the table, N \u00bc 6,235.\nwas reclassified as being in four-generation lineages. According\nto Uhlenberg (1995, p. 24), ``The paucity of empirical data has\nencouraged a misconception to develop that four- and five-\ngeneration families are becoming common under modern\ndemographic conditions.'' We make no claim that the findings\npresented here are definitive but, like the results of other\nanalyses, they seem to argue for caution when it comes to\nassuming that demographic change translates neatly into\nchange in depth of family lineages.\nIn this article we also explored whether lineage depth was\nrelated to current social class, race, and social class background\nwith age, gender, and marital status controlled. The analysis\nrevealed some important findings. First, generally speaking,\ncurrent social class was systematically conversely related to\nthe likelihood of being in four-generation lineages, and Blacks\nwere more likely than Whites to be in four-generation lineages.\nSecond, these patterns are even more striking for the likelihood\nof being in shorter-gapped, four-generation lineages. Third,\neducational attainment, which was the measure of current social\nclass, decreased the likelihood of being in longer-gapped, four-\ngeneration lineages. Compared with Blacks, Whites were not\nmore likely to be in longer-gapped, four-generation lineages.\nAlthough there is some positive association between father's\neducation and the chance of being in a longer-gapped, four-\ngeneration lineage, the supporting evidence is relatively weak.\nAs stated earlier, two demographic forces contribute to the\nformation of four-generation lineages: longer survival and\nearlier births. Based on what is known about the links among\nsocial class, race, mortality, and timing of births, we expected\nmore individuals of higher social class and more Whites to be\nin longer-gapped, four-generation lineages than individuals\nof lower social class and Blacks, who were expected to be\ndisproportionately in shorter-gapped, four-generation lineages.\nThe results support only half of this expectation. The differ-\nentials in shorter-gapped lineages received strong support from\nthe data, but there was no solid evidence for differentials in\nlonger-gapped lineages. This may be because even though\nindividuals of higher social class and Whites tend on average\nto live longer, they also have first children at older ages.\nDifferentials in four-generation lineages between these social\ngroups seem to be primarily a result of differences in the timing\nof births, not in the chance of longevity.\nThe findings reported on in this article are a snapshot of the\nearly 1990s. The data do not describe a trend in the incidence of\nfour-generation lineages over time. Our findings may seem to\nbe at odds with beliefs about the role of longevity, or mortality\nat large, in the formation of great-depth lineages. The long-\nterm trend in mortality decline, which is part of the general\ndemographic transition, certainly contributes to greater\nlineage depth in American families, and it is tempting to\nattribute social differentials in lineage depth to differentials in\nmortality or survival. These findings suggest, however, that, at\nleast in the early 1990s, it is the timing of childbearing, not\nincreased longevity, that accounts for being in four-generation\nlineages.\nIncomplete data was a major limitation of this study. The\ncriteria we adopted to classify the uncertain cases were\nconservative, and as a result we were able to classify only\n60% of the original sample. Compared with the original\nsample, more of the respondents in the second sample were\nmale, White, younger, and unmarried, and had higher levels of\neducation--characteristics that were significantly related to\nlineage depth. An evaluation of the degree to which these\ndifferences biased the results awaits the collection of complete\ndata on lineages in future studies.\nThe extremely low percentage (1%) of four-generation\nlineages among the oldest age group clearly is an artifact of\nthe conservative criteria employed to categorize respondents.\nIn Rossi and Rossi's (1990) sample, persons aged 71 or older\nhad the highest percentage (29%) of being in four-generation\nlineages, followed by those aged 50\u00ad60 (20%). In the present\nstudy, respondents who had children and an oldest grandchild\nolder than age 15 were eliminated from the final analysis\nbecause we could not decide with confidence whether a\ngrandchild had children. Undoubtedly, many grandchildren\nolder than age 15 already had children of their own. If we were\nto assume that all the respondents aged 75 and older whose\noldest grandchild was older than age 15 had at least one great-\ngrandchild, the percentage of four-generation lineages for this\nage group would increase from 1% to 67%. The exclusion of\nthese cases definitely leads to an underestimate for this age\ngroup. However, the underestimate for the oldest group does\nnot cause significant changes in the findings of the regression\nanalysis reported in the Results section. To test the robustness\nof our result, we assumed that respondents had a great-\ngrandchild if their oldest grandchild was older than 20, 25, or\n30, and we repeated the analysis for each age with the new\ncases included. The results were similar to those based on the\ncurrent sample.\nLongitudinal data on complete lineages would permit\ndocumentation of the changing incidences of various lineage\ntypes and analysis of the underlying demographic and social\nforces that lead to them. As Uhlenberg (1993) noted more than\na decade ago, ``There is nothing intrinsically difficult in\ncollecting information on lineage depth from a survey, but no\nestimates for the population based on representative samples\nexist'' (p. 229). Our hope is that the findings reported here,\nwhich clearly are provisional because they are derived from\nimperfect data, may lead to the collection of more complete\ndata in the future so that the issues raised here may be explored\nwith greater confidence.\n"
