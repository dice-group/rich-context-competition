Some studies report an interaction between 5-HTTLPR variation and stressful\nlife events affecting the risk for depression, others report a main effect of 5-HTTLPR variation on depression, while\nothers find no evidence for either a main or interaction effect.

In this paper, we describe the protocol for\na collaborative, consortium-based meta-analysis to in-\ncrease understanding of the role of 5-HTTLPR variation\nand stress in depression. The publication of this protocol\nserves several important purposes. First, we document\nour study protocols, design, and primary analysis deci-\nsions prior to conducting and publishing our study of 5-\nHTTLPR variation, stress, and depression, which will\navoid biased reporting later. Second, publication of these\ndetails will improve the ability of other researchers to in-\nterpret the results of this specific meta-analysis upon its\ncompletion. Finally, publishing our detailed protocol\nmay be helpful to future consortia by detailing key ana-\nlysis strategies and as a standard for transparency and\ncommitment to analytic plans set prior to meta-analysis.\nBackground\nBoth genetic and environmental factors influence depres-\nsion [1]. As with other psychiatric illnesses, research on the\netiology of depression has identified moderate heritability\nation studies (GWAS) have so far been unable to identify\nrobust and replicable loci associated with depression [7]. It\nhas been argued that some of this `missing heritability' is a\nresult of particular genes exerting an influence on risk for\ndepression only under specific environmental conditions,\nor `gene-environment interactions (GxE) [8,9]. One of the\nmost high profile reports of GxE involves a common func-\ntional polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) in the promoter region\nof the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTT). This gene en-\ncodes an integral membrane protein that transports the\nneurotransmitter serotonin from synaptic spaces into pre-\nsynaptic neurons, which terminates the action of serotonin.\nThe repeat length polymorphism has been shown to affect\nthe rate of serotonin uptake [10]. Specifically, the short (S)\nallele of the 5-HTTLPR is associated with less transcrip-\ntional efficiency of the promoter compared to the long (L)\nallele [11]. Additionally, a single nucleotide substitution\n(rs25531, A > G) within both alleles reduces transcription\nso that the LG\nallele becomes functionally equivalent to the\nS allele [12,13]. Studies have suggested grouping LG\nwith\nthe S allele to increase efficiency in predicting variation in\nserotonin transporter expression [14], although not all\nagree on this point.\nIn 2003, Caspi and colleagues reported evidence of a\nG\u00d7E interaction between 5-HTTLPR variation and\ncitations to date. Carriers of either one or two copies of\nthe S allele of the 5-HTTLPR were reported to be more\nlikely to develop major depressive disorder, increased\ndepressive symptoms, and suicidality in response to\nstressful life events and, separately, child maltreatment\nthan individuals homozygous for the L allele. Further-\nmore, there was evidence of a dose\u00adresponse relation-\nship, with risk of depression highest amongst those with\ntwo copies of the S allele compared to individuals with\nonly one copy in the presence of stress.\nIn the original report, no main effect of genotype was\nfound. If the genotype exerts an effect only on those\nexposed to the stressor, i.e. a diathesis-stress model, the\nlack of main effect may be due to insufficient power\n[16]. Alternatively, the genotypic effect may be one\nof differential environmental susceptibility [17], in which\nthe L-carriers are indifferent to the environment, whereas\nthe S allele confers environmental susceptibility, allowing\nS carriers to benefit more from positive experiences as\nwell as being more sensitive to stress, resulting in no\nnet genotype-depression association irrespective of sample\nsize [18]. Studying a large sample may distinguish these\npossibilities.\nSince the original report of a GxE interaction, hun-\ndreds of studies have investigated the combined impact\nof 5-HTTLPR variation and stress on risk for depression,\nsome of which reported replicating the original findings,\nwhile some did not. Meta-analyses, also, have come to\nBelow we discuss 4 key factors that complicate the in-\nterpretation of existing results related to the interplay\nbetween 5-HTTLPR variation, stress and depression.\n1. Study design. One factor complicating interpretation\nis differences in study design. Sample sizes vary, with\nthe majority modest or small. Underpowered studies,\ncombined with potential publication bias, can lead to\nan increased risk of Type 1 errors [26]. Sampling\nstrategies vary from population-based methods [15,27]\nto convenience sampling [28,29]. Different ancestral\npopulations have been included, with a preponderance\nof samples of European ancestry. The age range of\nsubjects varies, and it has been suggested that GxE\neffects are most consistently replicated in young adult\nThe studies contributing to our meta-analysis\nrepresent a range of study designs, so we will test\nwhether differing study design contributes to the\nheterogeneity of results.\n2. Timing of measurements. Brown and Harris [19]\nnoted that studies that have failed to replicate the\nGxE between 5-HTTLPR variation and life events\nhave measured the occurrence of stressful life events\nin the months immediately preceding the depressive\noutcomes [19]. In contrast, most of the positive rep-\nlications have been in keeping with the original study\nby Caspi and colleagues in measuring life events in\nthe five years prior to the outcome. Retrospective\nrecall of adversity over long periods of time may\nincrease the risk of forgetting or discounting of\nevents [30] or lead to a bias due to selective recall\nwhen those who are depressed self report [27,31].\nWhen only a lifetime diagnosis of depression is\navailable, information about relative timing of\nstressors and depression is lost.\nLongitudinal studies are largely able to avoid this\nbias, so our test of longitudinal vs. cross-sectional\ndesigns will also, in part, address the issue of timing\nof stress and depression.\n3. Type of environmental stressor. Different stressors\nhave been examined for interaction with 5-HTTLPR\nvariation. The most common are broad measures of\nstressful life events [32,33] and exposure to child\nmaltreatment [34,35]. The method of measurement\n(self report vs. interviewer), the type of stressors\n(e.g. chronic vs. acute) and the scale (binary ex-\nposed vs. not exposed, frequency as in the original\nstudy, or continuous variable) also vary. It has been\nsuggested that the varied methodology in assessing\nstressful life events in GxE studies may in part\nexplain the inconsistency of findings [18], and in a\nmeta-analysis that differentiated between stressors\n(child maltreatment, specific stressors, and stressful\nlife events), significant differences between types of\nstressors were found.\nWe will therefore perform heterogeneity analyses to\naccount for different types of stressors and\nmeasurements of stressors. One such test will be to\ncompare results from the studies that focused on\nspecific stressors (e.g. pregnancy, heart attack, medical\ninternship) to those from studies based on summary\nmeasures of diverse stressors (e.g. the LTE-Q).\n4. Type of outcome. Some studies used a categorical\nmeasure of depression diagnosis (e.g. DSM-IV or the\nICD-10) as an outcome, others used a symptom\ncount as continuous outcome, and some used both.\nSuch differences in outcome measures (e.g., continuous\nversus categorical) result in different assumptions\nand analytical approaches being used (see for a\nThe role of 5-HTTLPR variation and stress in the\ndevelopment of depression remains a topic of active\ndebate, in part because of the challenges outlined\nabove. Therefore, we are undertaking this collabora-\ntive meta-analysis using a standardized protocol to\nimprove understanding of this important issue.\nStudy objectives\nThe primary objective of this study is to increase under-\nstanding of the role of 5-HTTLPR variation and stress in\ndepression, where 5-HTTLPR variation is hypothesized\nas a moderator of the response to stress. To address the\ncomplexities of this topic, we will perform a coordinated\nmeta-analysis of all data available from collaborators,\nusing consistent de novo analyses and variables deter-\nmined a priori.\nIn keeping with the original finding by Caspi and col-\nleagues [15], we will test the following main hypothesis.\nThe risk of depression, evaluated either as a dichotom-\nous diagnosis or as a continuous phenotype, is greater in\ncarriers of the S allele versus those homozygous for the\nL allele in the presence of exposure to stress.\nThis main hypothesis will be examined in multiple set-\ntings to determine a range of conditions under which\nthe effect might be found. Additional hypotheses (e.g.\nwhether there is a main effect of 5-HTTLPR variation\non depression) will be examined to improve our under-\nstanding of this complex topic.\nMethods/Design\nOverview\nPlans for analysis, definitions of stressors and outcomes,\nas laid out in this protocol, were determined a priori by\nour study leadership team in consultation with contrib-\nuting study investigators, who provided input via confer-\nence calls and email. Individual study analyses will be\nperformed by the investigators who collected the data,\nusing standardized analysis scripts developed by the co-\nordinating team at Washington University to implement\na consistent analytical approach across sites. Results from\nthese analyses will be sent to the coordinating team for\nmeta-analysis. The consortium as a group will review and\ninterpret the results. We have previously developed and\nsuccessfully implemented this collaborative meta-analysis\napproach to investigate the genetics of addiction [37-39].\nThis coordinated meta-analysis approach has several ad-\nvantages over traditional literature-based meta-analyses\narising from the fact that a collaborative meta-analysis is\nbased on de novo, consistent analyses of harmonized vari-\nables in the primary data. First, the consistent analytic ap-\nproach and harmonized variables greatly ameliorate the\neffects of two of the chief causes of heterogeneity between\nindividual studies. In particular, meta-analyzing results de-\nrived from differing analytic approaches, such as the use\nof different covariates, different phenotype definitions, and\ndifferent analytical models, has a clear potential to bias\nliterature-based meta-analyses [40]. Second, the fact that\nthe results are based on de novo analyses allows for the in-\nclusion of previously unpublished data, both from re-\nsearchers who have not published on the topic before and\nthrough updated individual data from research groups\nwho have previously published. Third, coordinated de\nnovo analyses of primary data allow a collaborative meta-\nanalysis to conduct secondary analyses that can aid in the\ninterpretation of the main results. Finally, the coordinated\nmeta-analysis approach allows the examination of more\nhomogeneous subsets of the primary data than is possible\nthrough literature review.\nIdentifying studies\nOur goal is to invite participation from all studies with\ndatasets that have the 5-HTTLPR variant genotyped,\nand assessments of stress and depression, on at least 300\nsubjects. We set a minimum study size anticipating that\nthe individuals available for our de novo analyses would\ntypically be only a subset of the study individuals. Setting\nan arbitrary study minimum was intended to improve\nthe balance between the heterogeneity introduced by a\nnew study and the increased sample size. It also had the\npotential to ameliorate bias due to a possible publication\nbias amongst small studies. One drawback to this ap-\nproach of requiring large sample size is that it may ex-\nclude some studies with the most intensive assessments\nof stress and depression. Invitations were sent to groups\nthat had previously published on the topic. Additional\ninvitations were sent to groups, published or unpub-\nlished on this topic, suggested as a potentially qualifying\nstudy by a participating group. The goal of this inclusive\napproach is to minimize the potential impact of publica-\ntion bias. The participating collaborative studies are\nlisted in Table 1. All participating studies have approval\nfrom their local boards governing ethical conduct of re-\nsearch in human subjects to conduct the agreed upon\nstatistical analyses.
