They\nincorporate a more sophisticated depiction of impair-\nment, disability and service patterns, and greater\nintegration of mental and medical disorders. They will\nalso facilitate an in-depth examination of factors\ncontributing to psychopathology and service use dis-\nparities. The growing links between psychiatric\nepidemiology, clinical research and services research\nsuggest that the findings that emerge from the CPES\nwill influence phenomenology, etiology, and treatment\nresearch as well as public health and services policy.\nThe first two papers in this issue introduce two\nsurveys in the CPES that focus on minority popula-\ntions: the National Survey of American Life (NSAL)\n(Jackson et al., 2004) and the National Latino and\nAsian American Study (NLAAS) (Alegria et al.,\n2004). The NSAL is a study designed to explore racial\nand ethnic differences in mental disorders, distress and\nservice use from within the context of a variety of pre-\nsumed risk and protective factors in the African\nAmerican and Afro-Caribbean populations of the US\nas compared with white respondents living in the same\ncommunities. In addition to the core disorder instru-\nmentation contained in all of the CPES surveys, the\nNSAL has included detailed measures of health and\nsocial conditions, many of them similar to measures\nused in the National Survey of Black Americans con-\nAfrican-Americans over the past generation. Jackson\nand his colleagues highlight the incongruencies in the\nliterature regarding differences between blacks and\nwhites in vulnerability and mental disorder rates. The\nlarge sample size of the NSAL (over 6,000 adult\nrespondents) will allow this research team to tease out\nexplanations for the disparate and oft-times counter-\nintuitive relationships between distress, quality of life\nindicators, socioeconomic status and mental disorders\nreported previously.\nNext, Alegria and Takeuchi (Alegria et al., 2004)\npresent the NLAAS, the first study of its kind to mea-\nsure psychiatric epidemiology and service utilization\nGuest editorial\nAs the methods of psychiatric epidemiology have\nreached a greater level of sophistication, the field of\ndescriptive epidemiology has begun to reach maturity\n(Eaton and Merikangas, 2002). Worldwide prevalence\nestimates of mental disorders are now available, as well\nas their sociodemographic correlates, service patterns,\nand associated disability. Perhaps the most important\nfinding from psychiatric epidemiology research is that\naggregate mental disorders are the most prevalent of\nall chronic diseases in the general population. Indeed,\nfour of the top 10 causes of disability worldwide are\nmental disorders. Moreover, depression has now sur-\npassed cardiovascular disease as the leading cause of\ndisability worldwide (World Health Report, 2002).\nDespite major advances in the recognition and treat-\nment of mental disorders during the past decade, the\nvast majority of people with mental disorders in the\nUS still do not receive adequate services (Kessler et\nThe NIMH Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology\nSurveys (CPES) were initiated in recognition of the\nneed for contemporary, comprehensive epidemiologi-\ncal data regarding the distributions, correlates and risk\nfactors of mental disorders among the general popula-\ntion with special emphasis on minority groups. This\nproject joins three nationally representative surveys \u00ad\nthe National Comorbidity Survey Replication\n(NCS-R); the National Survey of American Life\n(NSAL) and the National Latino and Asian American\nStudy (NLAAS) \u00ad via a core interview structure that\nwas used across each of the studies. Previous publica-\ntions have provided detailed descriptions of the\nmethods of the NCS-R (Kessler et al., 2004), a replica-\ntion survey of the National Comorbidity Survey (NCS)\nconducted a decade ago (Kessler et al., 1994).\nThe CPES initiative has allowed the NIMH to\nestablish a twenty-first century benchmark of the dis-\ntribution and correlates of mental disorder prevalence,\nassociated impairments and mental health service use\npatterns across the US. The studies provide the first\nnational data with sufficient power to investigate cul-\nGuest editorial\namong Latinos and Asian-Americans using a nation-\nally representative sampling frame. Recognizing that\nlanguage barriers may discourage survey participation\nfor minorities who do not speak English, or are not\nfluent in it, the NLAAS instrument was translated\ninto seven languages. In addition to enriched samples\nof US residents of Latino and Asian descent, this study\nincludes modules that will permit an in-depth analysis\nof cultural influences on disorder manifestations and\nservice use patterns.\nThe third paper in this supplement by Pennell and\nher associates (Pennell et al., 2004) is one of the most\ncomprehensive descriptions of survey fieldwork ever to\nbe published in a journal supplement. This `soup to\nnuts' description serves multiple purposes. First, it\nunderscores the elaborate planning and coordination\ninvolved in conducting these surveys. Next, it\ndescribes triumphs and adversities, as well as the\nsurvey methodology theory and techniques used to\naddress issues as they were confronted. This project\nhad its challenges. Pennell and her colleagues do an\nexcellent job of walking the reader through the 5-year\nprocess that led, ultimately, to the successful comple-\ntion of over 20,000 CPES interviews. While the focus\nof this paper is on the adult portion of the project, the\nreader may keep in mind that a comprehensive study\nof adolescents and a 10-year follow-back study of origi-\nnal respondents of the National Comorbidity Survey\n(NCS) were being conducted in conjunction with\nthese adult surveys. Finally, this paper provides the\nfield with an up-to date account of the challenges con-\nducting household surveys in a post 9/11 America.\nHeeringa and his colleagues (Heeringa et al., 2004)\nhave carefully described the sampling designs and\nmethods for the CPES in the fourth paper. While the\ngoal of each of the studies was to be nationally repre-\nsentative, the strategies used to meet that goal were\ntailored to each study according to its sample require-\nments. Also described are the responsive design\ntechniques that were used to further refine the studies\nonce they were in the field. The end result is an\naccount of the application of state of the art in survey\nmethodology practically in `real time' as the surveys\nhave only recently been completed. Thus, the infor-\nmation contained therein will be useful to researchers\nand statisticians who may use CPES data and as a tuto-\nrial for students of survey methodology.\nThe last two papers in this issue are a preview of\nsome of the methodology work done by the individual\nstudy teams from within the context of the NSAL and\nthe NLAAS. Alegria et al. (2004b) describe the\nprocess the study team undertook to attain cultural rel-\nevance, equivalence and consistency among the scales\nused in the non-core sections of the survey instrument.\nJackson and his team (2004b) describe methodological\napproaches that address sampling challenges con-\nfronted when household members reside in\ninstitutional settings; a test of the consistency with\nwhich survey items were interpreted among respon-\ndents from the various cultures studied; and a method\nfor efficient collection of family history data. They also\ninclude a brief description of the clinical reappraisal\nstudy that was embedded in the NSAL design to cali-\nbrate the survey (layperson administered) generated\ndisorder diagnoses with diagnoses generated from a\nstructured clinical interview (administered by a\nmental health clinician).\nAlthough this work is comprised solely of sites within\nthe US, there will be greater integration of psychiatric\nepidemiology at the international level with the emer-\ngence of global initiatives in health. Moreover, as\nexemplified by the fields of cancer and cardiovascular\nepidemiology, current studies are increasingly incorpo-\nrating biological and genetic risk factors with emerging\nknowledge regarding their role in mental disorders. We\nanticipate having a prominent role in expanding the\ncontext of epidemiology to meet the needs and chal-\nlenges of psychiatric science. The CPES initiative is a\ngroundbreaking step into the future.\nLisa Colpe\nKathleen Merikangas\nBruce Cuthbert and Karen Bourdon\n(National Institute of Mental Health)\nReferences\nAlegria M, Takeuchi D, Canino G, Duan N, Shrout P,\nMeng X, Vega W, Zane N, Vila D, Woo M, Vera M,\nGuarnaccia P, Aguilar-Gaxiola S, Sue S, Escobar J, Lin\nK, Gong F.
