    "abstract": "Abstract\nPrevious studies indicate that individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) do not experience\noptical illusions in the same manner as individuals with typical development. This study uses\npupillary responses as an objective measure of perception of visual illusions, with the\nhypothesis that adults with ASD will show weaker pupillary constrictions to the illusions than\nadults without ASD. An eye-tracker was used to investigate the spontaneous pupillary changes to\nbrightness illusions in adults diagnosed with ASD (N \u00bc 11) and in a control group (N \u00bc 24).\nContrary to the hypothesis, the ASD group showed similar pupillary constrictions to the\nillusory bright stimuli as the control group. Therefore, this study does not support the idea\nthat individuals with ASD have a veridical perception of these types of illusions and instead\nsuggest that atypical perception of illusions does not constitute a universal characteristic of\naspect of high-functioning individuals with ASD.\n",

Some studies report that individuals with ASD do not experience\noptical illusions in the same way as individuals with typically development and that, in fact,\ntheir perceptions are more realistic or closer to the physical input. For example, Happe\nfound that individuals with ASD tended to show a lower susceptibility to visual illusions like\nthe Ebbinghaus (aka Titchener) illusion. The two central, black, circles were reported to be of\nthe same size, as they actually are, instead of smaller or larger when surrounded by larger or\nsmaller circles, respectively, as it is in the typical (illusory) perception.\nCorresponding author:\nBruno Laeng, Department of Psychology, University of Oslo, P.

Apparently, they all\ntake their starting point from the observation that perception in people with ASD is\ncharacterized by a greater reliance than normal on the sensory input, especially in\nambiguous situations (Lawson, Rees, & Friston, 2014). These accounts propose a weaker\ninfluence of top-down expectations on perception in people with ASD. Normally, prior\nexperiences with sensory information, either at the individual or species level, would shape\n``perceptual hypotheses'' (or ``unconscious inferences''; Gregory, 1980; Helmholtz, 1860) that\nassist the interpretation of incoming information, especially when ambiguous or unexpected\nIn the visual domain, optical illusions would constitute a paradigmatic example of the\noperation of top-down factors. That is, the perceptual experience goes beyond the\ninformation given and reflects an inference of what is either likely to be present (e.g., a\nspecific three-dimensional shape or scene given only two-dimensional cues) or what is\nabout to take place in the immediately near future (as in the flash-lag illusion or\nbrightness illusions; Changizi, 2009; Hohwy, Paton, & Palmer, 2016). As put by Palmer,\nSeth, and Hohwy (2015): ``What we are perceptually aware of, at any given moment, is\nthe state of the world that is calculated as being most likely to be causing the sensory\ninput that our brain receives'' and perception ``[. . .] specifies what sensory input would be\nreceived if a certain set of causes existed in the world'' (p. 377). Hence, people with ASD may\nprocess visual information not only in a different way than other people but, more\nspecifically, according to a cognitive style that can be described as resulting in a more\n``veridical'' perception (as suggested within a Bayesian perspective of vision; see Mottron\net al., 2013; Pellicano & Burr, 2012). Specifically, individuals with ASD may attend and\nperceive the sensory world in a manner that gives them (as a group) ``a privileged access\nto parts and details'' (Frith, 1989; Frith & Happe\nResearch on optical illusions can provide a rather privileged window into what ``prior\nhypotheses'' the visual system uses when attempting to make sense of ambiguous stimuli. In a\nprevious study from our laboratory on optical illusions of brightness, Laeng and Endestad\n(2012) showed that fast physiological adjustments of the size of the eye pupil occur when\nhealthy individuals viewed the brightness illusion (illustrated in Figure 1, left). Such a\nphysiological response seems consistent with the interpretation of a scene on the basis of\nthe natural statistics of the world, given that the convergent arrangement of the gradually\nlighter ends of the elements of the pattern is consistent with a perceptual inference of a bright\nsource of light, at the center of the figure, as it may occur in nature when looking directly at\nthe sun through a canopy of leaves. Intuitively, the experience of an individual (or perhaps of\nthe species) in similar situations has been associated with a particular physical state that\ncould likely lead to ``glare'' and therefore a ``dazzling'' effect of strong light on the eyes, a\nsituation that could temporarily incapacitate vision. Hence, a reduction in the size of the\npupil would seem to represent a very adaptive response of the visual system to a probable\nsituation, although according to the actual stimulation there is really no difference between\nthe spectral returns of the internal region of the figure and of its surrounding. Thus, visual\nillusions of this kind can be used to gauge the extent in which (groups of) individuals differ in\ntheir use of prior knowledge about the visual world, so that accuracy in perception or\n``closeness to physical reality'' may be either enhanced or reduced (Pellicano & Burr,\n2012). Moreover, physiological measures of illusion susceptibility may be particularly\nvaluable for understanding the relationship between autism and illusory perception, since\nsuch variables may be less influenced by decisional strategies. Finally, we note the fact that\npupil size is outside voluntary control, differently from eye movements or blinking (Laeng,\nSirois, & Gredeba\n\u00a8 ck, 2012), and that this measure therefore could provide a unique\nperspective into the ``nonconscious inferences'' of the perceptual system.\nHowever, not every study has found atypical illusion perception in individuals with ASD\nlikely that not every optical illusion may be affected (e.g., the Muller-Lyer illusion; Happe\n\u00b4 ,\n1996). Hence, it is relevant to document the occurrence and types of atypical perception in\norder to understand, at the empirical and theoretical levels, the whole constellation of\ncognitive changes that can occur in individuals with ASD. Specifically, charting what types\nof illusory phenomena are absent and which are preserved would contribute to identify\nperceptual and cognitive mechanisms that may be involved in the development of autistic\nfeatures. For example, Maule, Stanworth, Pellicano, and Franklin (2016) have observed that\ncolor adaptation seems to function typically in adults with ASD (in contrast to reduced\naftereffects for faces or numerosity; e.g., Ewing, Pellicano, & Rhodes, 2013; Turi et al.,\n2018). They concluded that, because color adaptation effects occur very early in the stream\nof visual processing (in part already in the retina), these effects may be less subject to\ndifferences in the influence of top-down expectations.\nThe previous studies included mainly children and adolescents and control\ngroups matched in age. However, younger children are in general less prone to\noptical illusions than adults, and there appears to be a developmental progression with age\nin the strength of illusory perceptions (e.g., Kova\nKiorpes, 2015). Hence, it is relevant to investigate individuals with ASD in other, older,\nage-groups.\nIn addition, studies of optical illusions in people with ASD (but also, in general, in\nindividuals with typical development) have been based on introspective reports about size\nor shape judgments. Yet, it is also possible to study responses to illusions with behavioral\nFigure 1. The brightness illusion (left) and its control image (right).\nLaeng et al. 3\nresponses (e.g., adjusting grip in the Ebbinghaus illusion) or with psychophysiological\nmethods that measure responses that cannot be voluntarily controlled, such as\nthe pupillary response. Indeed, in our laboratory, we found a constrictive response of the\neye pupil to illusory brightness in individuals with typical functioning (Laeng & Endestad,\n2012; Zavagno, Tommasi, & Laeng, 2017), as if the eye reacted (or prepared to react) to a\nphysical increase in light emission or reflectance. Most relevant, we compared pupil\nresponses to the illusory brightness display with an isoluminant control image,\ncorresponding to 180 rotations of all the gradients that induce the brightness illusion (as\nillustrated in Figure 1, right), that does not engender the same experience of glare in the\ncenter of the image (in fact, it tends to yield the impression of a darker and duller region\ncompared to original illusion's central hole as well as the surrounding background). Since the\nconstrictions in pupillary size when viewing the brightness illusion or its control image cannot\nbe ascribed to changes in physical light energy or visual contrast, these findings strongly\nreveal the influence of perceptual hypotheses at a very early level of sensory processing\nThis study explores the perception of brightness illusions in adults with ASD and a\ncontrol group of adults with typical development. An infrared eye-tracker was used to\nmeasure the pupil diameters of the participants while they observed the illusion of\nbrightness and a control image. If the group with ASD showed a weakened or absent\nillusory perception of brightness and related physiological changes, this would support the\nassumption that people with ASD tend to have a more veridical representation of the visual\ninput (Pellicano & Burr, 2012). Consistent with the expected change in physiological\nresponses, individuals with ASD should be less prone than controls to experience and\nreport the brightness illusion.\nMethods\nParticipants\nParticipants in the ASD group (N \u00bc 16) were recruited through Autismeforeningen i Norge\n(Norwegian Autism Association). All had been diagnosed with the ICD-10 (World Health\nOrganization, 1992) by experienced clinicians. Five individuals with ASD were excluded from\nall analysis, since they were not able to keep fixation within a region of interest (ROI) of 3 of\nvisual angle, centered on the fixation cross and overlapping the white central region within all\npatterns, for at least 90% of the time. Hence, 11 individuals with ASD were included in the\ntwo groups did not differ significantly by age; F(1, 33) \u00bc 3.3, p \u00bc .08. All participants had self-\nreported correct or corrected-to-normal vision (by use of glasses or contact lenses). No\nparticipants had other neurological or psychological conditions. The final ASD group\n(N \u00bc 11) had an average percent dwell time around fixation \u00bc 95.5%, whereas the Control\ngroup maintained gaze within the ROI for a 96.9% of the time. The two groups did not differ\nparticipants with ASD and 18 of the participants in the control group completed a test of\nfluid intelligence at the end of the session: the Standard Progressive Matrices by J. C. Raven\n(\u00dfOxford Psychologist Press Ltd). The ASD group had a lower average score (mean \u00bc 36.5;\ninformed consent was obtained from all participants, and the project was approved by The\nRegional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics (REK S\u00f8r-\u00d8st; approval\nStimuli, Apparatus, and Procedure\nThe stimuli consisted of a version of the Asahi brightness illusion (Kitaoka, 2005), since\nearlier studies have found this to be a powerful illusory stimulus, as documented by the\nprofile of perceptual responses or psychophysics as well as the physiological response of\npupillary constriction (see Laeng & Endestad, 2012). As done in the previous\ninvestigations, responses to the brightness illusion were compared with those to a control\npicture (Figure 1) in which the illusory-inducing gradients diverge so as to disrupt, in fact\nreverse, the brightness illusory effect so that the central area appears relatively darker than\nthe background in the control stimulus. In the pupillometry experiment, the brightness\nillusion and its darker control were shown in isolation for 4 s, and three colored patterns\n(yellow, purple, or green) were presented during the test, with size varying between 6 and 10\nof visual angle, resulting in a total of six pseudorandomized trials intermixed to filler images\nof other geometrical patterns (e.g., checkerboard-like patterns). Participants were instructed\nto maintain fixation on the central cross throughout all trials and did not give any explicit\nresponses to the stimuli.\nThe participants also completed a task where the three illusory patterns were shown\npairwise and side by side (twice by positioning the ``bright'' pattern to the left and to the\nright of the ``dark in each trial).'' The participants reported verbally which of the two patterns\nlooked brighter in its center.\nSMI (SensoMotoric Instruments, Berlin, Germany) software (iView 3.2\u00d5 Experiment\nmonitor with display resolution set to 1,680 \u00c2 1,050 pixels. Participants seated with their eyes\n55 cm from the screen and they responded verbally to the experimenter who registered the\nresponses in the computer.\nIn the pupillometry experiment with the bright illusion, after a simple 4-point calibration\nprocedure, the eye-tracker sampled eye positions at a rate of 60 Hz using a SMI RED500\nremote eye-tracking device by SensoMotoric Instruments (SMI, Germany). Right before the\npresentation of each pattern stimulus, isoluminant blank images appeared for 1,000 ms. Pupil\nresponses (in mm) to each baseline were subtracted from the corresponding pupil response to\na pattern so as to obtain the main dependent variable of ``pupillary change.'' During the task,\nparticipants maintained fixation on a little dot at the center of each pattern without making\nany verbal or manual response.\nResults\nAll measures of pupil size in a same individual and to the bright and dark stimuli, from onset\nuntil the offset of the stimulus (4,000 ms), were averaged to obtain a mean pupillary change.\nThese were first analyzed in a repeated-measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Group\n(ASD vs. Controls) and Illusion (bright vs. dark) as the between-subject and within-subject\nfactors. Contrary to the prediction that the effect of brightness illusions on pupil sizes would\nbe weaker or absent in the ASD group than the control group, there was no indication of a\ndifferential pupillary change when looking at the illusory bright versus dark stimuli. As\nexpected and shown in Figure 2, pupils did constrict to the bright illusions, F(1, 33) \u00bc 17.8,\np \u00bc .0002. This finding replicates the presence of a pupillary reduction to bright illusions\npreviously reported by Laeng and Endestad (2012).\nThere were, however, neither a main effect of Group, F(1, 33) \u00bc 0.87, p \u00bc .77, nor an\ninteractive effect of Illusion and Group, F(1, 33) \u00bc 0.24, p \u00bc .63. The effect sizes of the\nresponses of the ASD group and Control group to the ``bright'' or the ``dark'' patterns\nLaeng et al. 5\nappeared to be similar (bright: Cohen's d \u00bc 0.0; dark: Cohen's d \u00bc 0.179). When exploring the\nillusory effects in the two groups with separate ANOVAs, there was a strong effect size of the\nIllusion in both the Control group (Cohen's d \u00bc 0.813; Lambda \u00bc 17.8; Power \u00bc .99) and the\nASD group (Cohen's d \u00bc 0.779; Lambda \u00bc 7.5; Power \u00bc .70). Figure 3 illustrates the pupillary\nchange evolution in each group for the ``bright'' and ``dark'' patterns; as the shaded stripes\n(i.e., the 95% confidence intervals around the mean) indicate, the graphs reveal a substantial\noverlap in pupillary changes over time in the two groups.\nIn addition, we analyzed the present results with a Bayesian repeated-measures ANOVA\nusing the statistical software JASP (https://jasp-stats.org/). This analysis had Group (ASD\nvs. Controls) and Illusion (bright vs. dark) as the between-subject and within-subject factors.\nWe used as prior a value of 0.2, which is the default for Bayesian repeated-measures ANOVA\nin JASP. We found that the Group's BF10\n\u00bc 0.363 and the inclusion Bayes Factor (based on\nFigure 2. ``Violin plots'' of mean pupillary changes in millimeters to the (bright) illusion (top panel) and the\n(dark) control pattern (bottom panel) in the ASD group and the CNTRL group. The plots show the density of\nthe data with markers for the median of the data and the interquartile range. Overlaid on this box plot is a\nkernel density estimation. ASD \u00bc autism spectrum disorder; CNTRL \u00bc Control.\nmatched models) for the Group \u00c2 Illusion interaction is 0.391, indicating that the present\nresults are 2.56 more likely under H0 than under H1. However, the Illusion factor had a\n\u00bc 653.4, indicating strong evidence for a pupillary difference when viewing stimuli like\nthe ones in Figure 1.\nConsistent with their pupil responses, both groups made similar judgments of relative\nbrightness, as the (``bright'') pattern was judged as ``brighter'' than the (``dark'') control in\nits center by both the individuals with ASD (Mean % choices \u00bc 81.7 %; SE \u00bc 8.1) and the\nA series of regression analyses failed to reveal a predictive role of either participants' age\non either mean % ``brighter'' choices (r \u00bc .02, p \u00bc .93) or the mean pupil changes to the bright\nillusion (r \u00bc .09, p \u00bc .90). Similarly, scores in the fluid intelligence test (Raven Matrices) failed\nto predict mean pupil changes to the bright illusion for either ASD (r \u00bc .003, p \u00bc .99) or\nControl participants (r \u00bc .11, p \u00bc .68), as well as the participants' mean % ``brighter'' choices\nDiscussion\nThis study is the first exploration of pupillary responses to illusory brightness in individuals\nwith ASD. Based on recent accounts of ``veridical'' perception in this group (e.g., Mottron\net al., 2013; Pellicano & Burr, 2012), it was hypothesized that the ASD group would differ\nfrom the control group by showing an absent or reduced constriction of the pupil to illusory\nFigure 3. Mean pupillary change in millimeters to the ``bright'' pattern (top panel) and the ``dark,'' control\npattern (bottom panel) in the ASD group (red lines and shading) and the Control group (green lines and\nshading). The shaded stripes indicate 95% confidence intervals around the mean. ASD \u00bc autism spectrum\ndisorder; CNTRL \u00bc Control.\nLaeng et al. 7\nlight as well as a reduced proportion of reports of illusory effects. This prediction was based\non recent accounts of increased reliance on sensory input or reduced reliance on perceptual\nhypotheses (or ``hypo-priors'' or ``aberrant precision'' of predictions; Lawson et al., 2014;\nPellicano & Burr, 2012) in individuals with ASD compared to individuals with typical\ndevelopment.\nThe present results did not reveal a difference in either perceptual reports or physiological\nadjustments to the above patterns. Therefore, this study does not support the hypothesis that\nthe optical illusion of enhanced brightness or glare differs in the perceptual processing of\nindividuals with ASD. Such a negative conclusion is consistent with other failures to replicate\nshould also consider that the physiological evidence collected here would seem immune to\neffects of task demands (Rosenthal & Rubin, 1978), since the pupil response cannot be\ncontrolled at will (Laeng & Sulutvedt, 2014) and constitute a ``honest signal'' related to\nthe experience, whereas responses in the typical tasks can be controlled voluntarily (e.g.,\neither responding verbally or when performing adjustments of the perceptual elements, like\nin Ropar & Mitchell, 1999, 2001). Thus, based on the present findings, it seems instead that\natypical processing related to visual illusions does not constitute a universal aspect of visual\nprocessing in individuals with ASD and it is not a necessary element for the development of\nother difficulties related to ASD (cf., Behrmann et al., 2006). In fact, any single formulation\nof cognitive changes in people with ASD may fail to capture the heterogeneity and\nmultifactorial causality below the phenomena observed (Happe\nInterestingly, a recent study by Blaser, Eglington, Carter, and Kaldy (2014) examined\npupil responses of two groups of toddlers, one with ASD and one with typical\ndevelopment, during visual search and found that the ASD group had larger dilations\nduring this attentional task than the control group. The authors suggest that the increased\npupil size of the ASD group was a sign of increased attentional focus, which led this group to\nperform better than children with typical development. However, a similar explanation is\nunlikely in this study, since passive viewing of visual patterns is not as demanding as visual\nsearch, and the present findings indicate equal constrictions to the brighter illusions and no\nsign of an opposite, dilation, pupil response in the ASD group. In addition, recently, Lawson,\nMathys, and Rees (2017) showed that adults with ASD had a reduced dilation response to\nsurprising outcomes when learning about probabilistic relationships. They interpreted this\nfinding as resulting from a tendency to overestimate the ``volatility'' of the sensory\nenvironment. In the present context, as suggested in Zavagno et al. (2017), automatic\nconstrictions to subjective brightness suggest the presence of predictions of forthcoming\n``glare'' that prepare the visual system to a probable increase in light energy and the pupil\nadjusts its size as a ``protective response'' to anticipated dazzle. These fast pupillary\nconstrictions to probable blinding sunlight could be evolutionarily selected to reduce its\nthreat to survival and therefore may not result from an individual's learning about the\nvolatility of the sensory environment. Finally, Turi, Burr, and Binda (2018) showed that\nscores in the Autism Spectrum Quotient (Baron-Cohen et al., 2001) in a group of adults\nwith typical development were related to pupillary changes when reporting the direction of\nmotion of a bistable rotating object. These changes were interpreted as indicating\nadjustments of the focus of visual attention (as in Binda, Pereverzeva, & Murray, 2014;\nMatho\n^ t & van der Stigchel, 2015) to either the brighter or darker surfaces of the object.\nTuri et al.'s results show that traits typical of ASD relate to different ways of focusing\nattention and, in turn, affect pupil size. However, Turi et al. did not test participants with\nASD. Nevertheless, on the basis of their study, we surmise that similar deployments of\nattention took place in our ASD group and in the adults with typical development when\nviewing the brightness illusions. In general, it seems likely that the glare illusion effect actually\ndepends on ``predictive processes'' of a different kind than those that affect other illusory\nWe need to stress that there are several limitations in this study. First of all, it is based on a\nsmall sample of participants with ASD (N \u00bc 11) compared to other studies (e.g., N \u00bc 25 in\nHappe\n30 individuals with ASD, and these studies also failed to observe differences. In fact, in this\nstudy, we found no hints that the pupil responses of the participants with ASD differed on\naverage or in their variability to those of the controls, as indicated by the comparable effect\nsizes of physiological response of the pupils and the individuals' distribution of pupil change.\nThe Bayesian analysis leaned toward only ``weak'' if not inconclusive evidence (Dienes, 2014,\nor ``anecdotal,'' cf. Jeffreys, 1961) for the null hypothesis, since it found the present results to\nbe 2.6 times more likely under the null hypothesis than what predicted by a ``veridical\nperception'' account of ASD. We also note that this study investigated adults instead of\nchildren, and the perception of illusion is more common in adults than in younger children\n(cf. Doherty, Campbell, Tsuji, & Phillips, 2010). Hence, one possible explanation for the\ndifference in results from Happe\n\u00b4 (1996) may be that results with children with ASD reflect a\ndelay rather than a deviance from the typical developmental course. However, the studies by\nsignificant differences between ASD and control groups, had younger participants than\ncomparable to Happe\nMitchell (1999) did not differ systematically from the other groups. Moreover, we note\nthat our groups were not optimally matched with regard to fluid intelligence and genders'\nproportions, the former being higher in the control group and the proportion of females\nlower in the ASD group. However, we do not assume illusory perception to be influenced by\ndifferences in IQ in adults. In younger subjects, it is more likely that a lower susceptibility\nmight reflect more immature perceptual function, but this would constitute an influence that\nwould work against the present results. Similarly, there is no known gender difference in\nsusceptibility to brightness illusions. Finally, this study did not include a measure of severity\nof symptoms in the ASD group or of autistic traits in the control group. However, given the\nsmall group of individuals with ASD that we were able to recruit in this study, this\ninformation would not have been likely to reveal significant effects. Future studies, with\nlarger and better matched samples, should further address more detailed relationships\nbetween symptoms of ASD and the perception of illusory objects.\n"
