Tobacco is as-\nsociated with many adverse reproduc-\ntive health effects in women, includ-\ning adverse effects on pregnancy.3,4\nExposure to tobacco during the prena-\ntal period and to environmental to-\nbacco smoke during the postnatal pe-\nriod are leading causes of mortality and\nmorbidity, including problem behav-\niors, among children.4-6\nMost women who quit smoking dur-\ning pregnancy do so on their own.3,7\nNevertheless, most smokers do not quit\nsmoking during their pregnancy.3,7 Pre-\nnatal smoking cessation programs have\nbeen shown to increase quitting rates;\nhowever, postpartum relapse rates are\nvery high.7-9 Although the prevalence\nof smoking in the United States has de-\ncreased among adolescents and young\nwhether progress has been made to-\nward achieving the desired reduction\nin the national prevalence of smoking\nand women of childbearing age.13\nTo assess recent temporal trends in\npregnancy-related differences in the\nprevalence of smoking, we compared\nsmoking behaviors of pregnant women\nwith those of nonpregnant women of re-\nproductive age.

Over time, the median number of cigarettes smoked\nper day by pregnant smokers remained at 10, whereas among nonpregnant smokers\nit decreased from 19 to 15 (P.05 for trend). In the same period, among young women\n(aged 18-20 years), prevalence rates of smoking initiation and current smoking in-\ncreased slightly. Sociodemographic subgroups of women at increased risk for current\nsmoking were the same for pregnant and nonpregnant women (ie, those with a com-\npleted high school education or less, whites, and those who were unmarried).\nConclusions In this analysis, the decline in smoking over time among pregnant women\nwas primarily due to the overall decline in smoking initiation rates among women of\nchildbearing age, not to an increased rate of smoking cessation related to pregnancy.\nTo foster effective perinatal tobacco control, efforts are needed to further reduce the\nnumber of young women who begin smoking. Clinicians should query all pregnant\nwomen and women of childbearing age about smoking and provide cessation and re-\nlapse interventions to each smoker.\nrisk behaviors related primarily to\nchronic diseases. Designed to produce\nrisk factor estimates for the noninsti-\ntutionalized civilian population aged 18\nyears or older, it provides baseline data\nfor setting national health promotion\nand disease prevention objectives.13 The\nsampling weights used in the BRFSS are\nbased on the probability of selection and\nadjusted for nonresponses and dispro-\nportionate sampling of subgroups rela-\ntive to the state's population.

As an indi-\nrect measure of motivation to quit\nsmoking,16 we obtained the percent-\nage of current smokers who had at-\ntempted to quit16 smoking, which was\nbased on participants' response to the\nquestion \"During the past 12 months,\nhave you quit smoking for 1 day or\nsmoking was defined as smoking 20 or\nmore cigarettes per day. A question on\npregnancy status (\"To your knowl-\nedge, are you now pregnant?\") was\nasked after all questions on smoking\nand alcohol use.\nAnalyses\nWe aggregated the weighted state-\nspecific data from women aged 18 to\n44 years from the 33 states selected for\nthis analysis. From the total sample, we\nobtained the percentages of women\nwho reported ever smoking (smoking\ninitiation rate), were current smokers,\nand had quit smoking. We used 3 mea-\nsures to assess annual differences in cur-\nrent smoking behaviors between preg-\nnant women and nonpregnant women:\nthe prevalence rate ratio (PRR), the me-\ndian number of cigarettes smoked by\ncurrent smokers, and the adjusted odds\nratio; we used the latter measure to\nidentify sociodemographic subgroups\nof women at differential risk for smok-\ning. In the absence of information on\neach woman's smoking habits before\nand after planning or recognizing a\npregnancy, the PRR provides an indi-\nrect measure of the magnitude of the\nreduction in smoking prevalence after\nwomen recognize they are pregnant\n(pregnancy-related reduction). A PRR\nclose to zero indicates the greatest preg-\nnancy-related reduction in smoking.\nThe overall rates of smoking initia-\ntion, current smoking, and quitting\nwere age-adjusted to the age distribu-\n(TABLE 1). To examine variations in\ncurrent smoking among sociodemo-\ngraphic subgroups and time trends in\ncurrent smoking within those sub-\ngroups, we conducted analyses strati-\nfied by age, education, race, marital sta-\ntus,andemploymentstatus.Using these\nvariables as independent variables, we\ncreated multiple logistic regression\nmodels to calculate adjusted odds ra-\ntios for current smoking separately for\npregnant and nonpregnant women. Al-\nthough a given odds ratio may over-\nstate the strength of an association com-\npared with the corresponding PRR, it\nis a valid measure for identifying so-\nciodemographic subgroups at low or\nhigh risk for smoking. We used\nSUDAAN17 to obtain valid estimates of\nSEs. We created weighted least squares\nlinear regression models (using the in-\nverse of the variance estimates for\nweights) to determine the statistical sig-\nnificance of trends over time. A P value\nless than .05 was considered statisti-\ncally significant for all analyses. Be-\ncause most outcome measures showed\nTable 1.

Furthermore, most\nadult smokers in the United States be-\ncome regular smokers before age 18\nyears,10 and for such smokers quitting\nattempt to quit smoking each year are\nsuccessfulinquittingpermanently.16 The\nfact that most smokers (54%) continue\nto smoke after they learn that they are\npregnant underscores the need for more\nextensive efforts to reduce smoking by\nwomen over their entire lives and to re-\nduce the number of women who begin\nsmoking.\nWe found that the risk factors for\nsmoking are similar for pregnant and\nnonpregnant women and that many\nsuch women are likely to rely on pub-\nlicly funded health care providers for\ncare. Clinicians who provide this care\nshould extend the \"ask, advise, assist,\nand arrange\" strategy suggested in the\nclinical practice guidelines on smoking\ncessation20,21 to each woman. Efforts to\ncurb smoking during pregnancy should\nbegininthepreconceptionperiod.Clini-\ncally proven prenatal smoking cessa-\ntion interventions that can be deliv-\nered in primary care settings are now\nmary care clinic-based smoking preven-\ntion interventions have been found to\nbe effective.24 Nicotine replacement\nproducts can improve the effectiveness\nof comprehensive behavioral interven-\ntions to reduce smoking.25 For preg-\nnantwomen,nicotinereplacementprod-\nucts should be recommended only if the\nincreased likelihood of smoking cessa-\ntion outweighs the harmful effects of\nnicotine and potential concomitant\nsmoking on the fetus.20\nPregnancy may represent a period\nwhen smoking cessation activities are\nmost effective. If prenatal smoking ces-\nsation is not feasible, a reduction in the\nnumber of cigarettes smoked could ben-\nefit the pregnancy, including a reduc-\ntion in risk of low birth weight.8 To re-\nduce postpartum relapses in smoking,\ninterventions should continue be-\nyond the perinatal period. Of note, in\nour study declines in smoking rates\nwere not as pronounced among mar-\nried pregnant women as they were\namong their unmarried counterparts.\nBecause smokers may have partners\nwhose smoking habits match their own,\nand because the presence of such a part-\nner may negatively affect a woman's at-\ntempts to quit smoking,26 screening for\ntobacco use should be extended to part-\nners of women who smoke. For women\nwho are unable to quit smoking and\nwho are at risk of becoming pregnant,\nthe feasibility of pregnancy postpone-\nment until smoking cessation is\nachieved should be explored.27\nAlthough the importance of reduc-\ning tobacco use by current smokers\nis clear, the findings from our study,\nincluding the unchanging trends in\ncurrent smoking rates among young\nwomen, and reports from England,28\nTable 3.
