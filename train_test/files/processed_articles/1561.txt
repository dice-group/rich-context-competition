Less often used is an alternative technique\nof comparative ratings, in which twins are asked if\nthey or their partner had greater exposure.\nComparative ratings have been used in twin studies\nwhen absolute measures may be difficult to complete\nretrospectively or when differential experiences are a\nfocus of study. Additionally, only one twin is some-\ntimes available to provide data and comparative\nratings may be easier for proxy informants than\ntrying to estimate the exact extent of an exposure.\nAlthough the comparative approach is very attractive,\nlittle has been published using this approach.\nThe Sibling Inventory of Differential Experiences\n(SIDE) was one of the first comparative measures used\namong siblings (Baker & Daniels, 1990; Daniels &\nPlomin, 1985) to examine sibling interaction, parental\ntreatment and peer characteristics. Agreement among\nadult twins with respect to differences in parental treat-\nment and peer group characteristics was moderate\nwhile agreement regarding sibling interaction was\npoorer, particularly for twins who were 35 years and\nThomas Mack has established a comparative\napproach for risk factors for breast cancers and multi-\nple sclerosis. As yet unpublished findings suggest that\ntwin agreement is higher for objective (e.g., age at\nmenarche, breast cancer) than for subjective (e.g.,\nwho had greater success) or depreciatory comparisons\n(e.g., who had more trouble in school; T. Mack, per-\nsonal communication, March, 2000). Finally, the\nutility and reliability of twin comparative ratings has\nbeen examined in a study on mosquito bites in adoles-\ncent twins (Kirk et al., 2000). Findings indicated that\nperceived twin differences in mosquito bite frequency\n(`Compared with your twin who is bitten by mosqui-\ntoes more often?') were related to differences between\none twin's self-report and the twin partner's self-\nreport in the expected direction, suggesting that the\ncomparative rating was valid.\nRelevant published findings on the use of proxy\ninformation in a noncomparative format in a case-\ncontrol twin study of breast cancer (Hamilton &\nMack, 2000) indicate good to excellent reliability\nbetween proxy and self-reports for several breast\ncancer risk factors (e.g., ages at menarche and\nmenopause, oral contraceptive use, smoking), with\nkappa statistics ranging from .60 to 1.0. Similarly, co-\ntwins have also been used as proxy informants for\nsmoking during pregnancy (Heath et al., 2003).\nGenerally good agreement between twins' retrospec-\ntive reports of smoking during pregnancy was\nComparative Rating Measures of Health\nand Environmental Exposures:\nHow Well Do Twins Agree?\nChandra A.

However, pair\ndiscrepancies did occur in nearly 11% of twins with a\nhistory of smoking, and were interpreted as cases of\nunderreporting by the target twin. Such findings indi-\ncate that we could expect good agreement for twins'\ncomparative ratings of health factors.\nThe purpose of the present study was to examine\n(1) how well monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ)\ntwin pairs agree on comparative ratings relating to\nputative dementia risk factors; and (2) how well com-\nparative ratings agree with independent self-reported\ninformation about the exposures.\nMethods\nParticipants\nParticipants were selected from the third wave of in-\nperson testing (IPT3) from the Swedish Adoption/Twin\nStudy of Aging (Pedersen et al., 1991). The current\nanalyses included 52 MZ and 75 same-sex DZ twin\npairs reared together who both participated in IPT3.\nOne-hundred-and-forty individuals were female and\nyears with a mean age of 59.6 years.\nMeasures\nTwins were asked to complete a 44-item questionnaire\n(see appendix), indicating for each item whether they\nor their twin partner engaged in a particular behavior\nto a greater extent, had greater exposure to variety of\nenvironmental agents, or were in better or worse phys-\nical and psychological health. Responses of don't\nknow were set to missing. Nonreponse plus endorse-\nment of don't know accounted for between 3.94%\n(which twin born first) and 47.14% (age at\nmenopause) of responses across items. Furthermore,\nneither, equally or about the same were recoded into a\nsingle category.\nIn this and prior waves of data collection, there\nwere survey questions asking for self-reports of various\nexposures and health conditions. The corresponding\nvariables included: (a) use of cigarettes and alcohol; (b)\noccupational and hobby exposures, such as livestock\nslaughter or dressing wild game (including whether the\ncontact occurred as a youth or adult, and whether it\nhad occurred in the last three years or in multiple time\nperiods); (c) physical and psychological health such as\nself-reported health, number of illnesses, depressive\nsymptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies --\nDepression total score; Radloff, 1977) and number of\ntotal there were 11 self-report indicators that could be\nexamined in the validity analyses of the comparative\nratings (with 2 self-report indicators for smoking,\nalcohol use and stressful life events). For validity com-\nparisons difference scores were created in the twins'\nself-reports according to which twin was agreed upon\nto have higher alcohol or tobacco consumption, partici-\npated more in handling livestock or game hunting, or\nhad worse physical or mental health. Next, the pair dif-\nference scores were compared to type and level of\nagreement on the comparative measure. Each twin\npair's level of agreement on each item was coded as\nfollows: (1) twins who agreed that they differed were\nexpected to show the largest pair differences and were\ncoded as 1; (2) those pairs who responded either with\ndon't know or were nonresponders were coded as .5;\n(3) those pairs who disagreed across any response cate-\ngories were coded as \u00ad.5; and (4) those endorsing\nneither or equally as much were expected to show the\nsmallest differences and were coded as \u00ad1.\nResults\nAgreement Between Twins in a Pair\nMZ and DZ twins were compared with respect to\ntheir agreement as to which twin was more exposed to\na particular element or experienced with a greater fre-\nquency a specific physical or mental health symptom.\nTable 1 shows for each comparative rating how many\npairs provided complete data and how well pairs\nagreed. Kappa statistics were calculated using SAS 8.1\n(SAS, 1999) both within each zygosity group and\noverall. In order to estimate the kappa statistic in SAS\nProc Freq, it was necessary to ensure square cross-tab-\nulation tables for analysis as not all response\ncategories were endorsed for all items across pairs.\nThus, we followed the procedure of Crewsen (2001)\nwhere dummy observations are created but do not\nenter the computation of the kappa statistics. An\nequality test indicates whether there are differences in\nagreement by zygosity. Results of the equality tests\nshowed that kappa statistics did not differ signifi-\ncantly by zygosity except for item 1 -- worse health\nprior to age 20 -- where MZ pairs agreed more that\nDZ pairs. MZ pairs retained larger kappa statistics\nthan DZ pairs for 19 of 44 items, while DZ pairs\nexhibited higher kappa statistics for 22 of 44 items.\nThe average overall kappa was .40. Agreement was\nhighest for overt exposures or traits, such as weight\nand wild game exposure (kappa = .61). More subjec-\ntive or concealed traits such as headache frequency\n(kappa = .48), stress (kappa = .33) and finding one's\nway in unfamiliar places (kappa = .25) often showed\nconsiderably less agreement between twins. There was\na pattern of greater agreement for more recent expo-\nsures than earlier exposures: (a) worse health prior to\nthe age of 20 years (kappa = .31) is nearly the same as\nfor worse health between 20 to 40 years (kappa =\n.27), but both were lower than worse health after the\nage of 40 years (kappa = .45); (b) agreement was\nlower for total number of operations with anesthesia\n(kappa = .27) compared to the last 3 years (kappa =\n.40) but with overlapping confidence intervals.\nIn comparing kappa statistics across items, the\nunderlying assumption that proportions for each\nresponse category are the same (i.e., similar proportions\nendorse me, my twin, and equally as much/neither) may\nChandra A.

Examining this assumption revealed\nseveral response patterns. First, twins reported being\nthe same for many of the traits/exposures. The median\npercentage agreement of sameness (response of equally\nas much or neither) for MZ and DZ pairs is 58% and\n41% respectively, but ranges widely across traits (MZ\npercentage of twin pairs who disagreed whether they\nwere the same was 19% and 26% for MZ and DZ\npairs respectively (MZ range 0 to 42%; DZ range 0 to\n52%).

Signed rank tests, calculated using the\nSAS univariate procedure (SAS, 1999), were used to\ncontrast comparative ratings to differences between\none twin's self-report and the twin partner's self-\nreport on the corresponding variable. The validity of\ncomparative ratings was quite good, as indicated by\nsignificant signed rank test results. The response dif-\nferences were in the direction that was to be\nexpected: twins who were rated by both themselves\nand their co-twin as experiencing more exposure or\nhigher incidence of physical and mental health vari-\nables, also had greater self-report values for these\nmeasures. Signed rank tests were significant for all\nvariables with the exception of `Life Events' (p = .39)\nand `Uncontrollable Life Events' (p = .12).\nResponses from twins where only one had provided\na comparative rating (limited to endorsing me or my\ntwin) but both twins had supplied self-report were also\nexamined. The number of pairs for each trait ranged\nfrom 0 (dress wild game, livestock slaughter) to 17\n(depressive symptoms and uncontrollable life events).\nThe traits on which agreement between comparative\nrating and self-report responses was highest were the\ntwo smoking variables (where agreement was perfect\nbut data were only available for four pairs), followed\nby the two alcohol variables (where level of agreement\nwas similar to Table 2). Agreement for depressive\nsymptoms and uncontrollable life events was quite poor\nwith trends in the opposing direction: a greater number\nof pairs with self-report differences inconsistent than\nconsistent with the comparative report.\nTo examine the question of validity among all\navailable pairs, the relationships between absolute pair\ndifferences in self-report measures with level of pair\nagreement were examined based upon a pair's joint\nresponse to comparative ratings and coded as \u00ad1, \u00ad.5,\n.5 and 1, as described above. Spearman correlation\ncoefficients served as effect size estimates between\nlevel of agreement and absolute pair differences in\nself-report variables tapping a relevant exposure (see\nTable 3). A positive correlation suggests that greater\npair differences on self-report traits are associated\nwith level of agreement regarding twin dissimilarity.\nSpearman correlations ranged from \u00ad.07 to .81 with a\nmedian correlation of .27. Similar to the focused look\nat pairs who agree that they differed, the strength of\nthe association between pair differences and level of\nagreement across all comparative response categories\nwas notably higher for substance use or hobbies than\nChandra A.

Thus, the sign rank test is expected\nto be positive for all self-report variables except for self-report health where higher scores indicate better health.\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

By zygosity, the median\nSpearman correlations were .21 and .26 for MZ and\nDZ pairs, respectively. The relatively smaller correla-\ntions for MZ pairs may reflect a greater likelihood for\nMZ pairs to disagree than DZ pairs due to smaller\npair differences.\nDiscussion\nComparative ratings of risk factors are sometimes\nused in twin studies, particularly when only one twin\nmight be available to provide information, for\nexample, if the other twin is ill or demented. The\npresent study addressed the reliability and validity of\nsuch ratings. Results suggested that comparative\nratings of risk factors are useful for observable and\nobjective behaviors, though some caution is warranted\nfor subjective internal states. However, where twins do\nagree that exposure or experiential differences exist\nthere is a high validity with self-reports.\nOur findings on the validity of comparative ratings\nrelative to self-report data converge with direct tests of\nthe validity of proxy responses by co-twins for smoking\nduring pregnancy (Heath et al., 2003), as well general\nsmoking traits (Hamilton & Mack, 2000). Kappa sta-\ntistics are lower for ages at menarche and menopause\nthan those reported by Hamilton & Mack (2000), but\nwere very similar for amount smoked.\nSome caution is warranted in relying on proxy\nresponders for potentially derogatory traits (i.e.,\ndrinking problems, depression) as twins may show a\ntendency to promote their co-twin as having greater\nproblems. The bias to report the co-twin as having\nmore trouble with depression may have played some\nrole in the results for singletons, for example, where\nonly 2 of the 17 singletons reported that they had\nmore trouble with depression than their co-twin.\nThese analyses represent an extension of the com-\nparative rating methodology to older cognitively intact\nindividuals. In this older sample we find that there is\ngenerally better agreement for more recent exposures\nthan earlier exposures (e.g., worse health in past three\nyears versus worse health earlier in life). Given a\ncloser proximity in time for early life events, younger\nindividuals may show better agreement.\nIn conclusion, comparative ratings can be used for\nobjective attributes: twins do agree. Moreover, there\nappears to be no appreciable bias by zygosity. MZ and\nDZ twins do not significantly differ in agreement and\nonly small differences were apparent in validity analy-\nses. However, the overall level of agreement is less\nthan desirable, especially for more subjective traits.\nFurthermore, the most used response choice is don't\nknow. Finally, twins often say they are the same.\nFuture studies ought to consider differing rating scale\nformats with more choices to examine whether such\nresponse tendencies could be altered and the compara-\ntive approach made more useful.\n"
