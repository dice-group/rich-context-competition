In the angiotensin II AT1 receptor blockade,\ntelmisartan was administered by gastric gavage (10 mg/kg/day) during angiotensin II infusion. The heart and aorta were\nisolated for Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry.\nResults: Angiotensin II infusion caused a significant reduction in the number of monocytes in the spleen through\nthe AT1 receptor-activated monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. Comparison of angiotensin II infusion, splenectomy\nand telmisartan comparatively reduced the recruitment of macrophages into the heart. Associated with this change,\ntransforming growth factor 1 expression and myofibroblast proliferation were inhibited, and Smad2/3 and collagen I/\nIII were downregulated. Furthermore, interstitial/perivascular fibrosis was attenuated. These modifications occurred in\ncoincidence with reduced blood pressure. At week 4, invasion of macrophages and myofibroblasts in the thoracic aorta\nwas attenuated and expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase was upregulated, along with a reduction in aortic\nfibrosis.\nConclusions: These results suggest that macrophages when recruited into the heart and aorta from the spleen\npotentially contribute to angiotensin II-induced cardiac fibrosis and hypertension.\n",

The\nspleen is the largest organ in the lymphatic system and\nforms a reservoir containing over half of the body's mono-\ncytes besides the bone marrow.1 It has previously been\nreported that about 40\u00ad70% of monocytes are recruited to\nthe infarcted myocardium from a splenic reservoir.2 Upon\nmoving to injured tissue, these monocytes turn into mac-\nrophages to contribute to postischemic inflammatory\nresponse and injury. Animal studies have shown that\nthe extent of myocardial infarction is positively correlated\nwith the number of macrophages accumulated in the injured\nmyocardium after coronary occlusion, where macrophages\nRecruitment of macrophages\nfrom the spleen contributes to\nmyocardial fibrosis and hypertension\ninduced by angiotensin II\nNing-Ping Wang1, James Erskine2, Wei-Wei Zhang3,\nRong-Hua Zheng3, Li-Hui Zhang1, Garret Duron1,\nJulian Gendreau1 and Zhi-Qing Zhao1,3\n Keywords\nAngiotensin II AT1 receptor, collagen, hypertension, macrophages, myocardial fibrosis, splenectomy\nCardiovascular Research Laboratory, Mercer University School of\nMedicine, USA\n2Department of Internal Medicine, Navicent Health, USA\n3Department of Physiology, Shanxi Medical University, China\nCorresponding author:\nZhi-Qing Zhao, Department of Basic Biomedical Sciences, Mercer\nUniversity School of Medicine-Savannah Campus, 1250 East 66th\nEmail: zhao_z@mercer.edu\nOriginal Article\n2 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 00(0)\nproduce multiple cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor ,\nplatelet derived endothelial cell growth factor, transform-\ning growth factor 1 (TGF1) and interleukin-1 to initiate\ninflammation and progression of adverse cardiac remode-\nling.3,4 Clinical observations have also found that mac-\nrophage accumulation is closely associated with severe\nmyocardial injury and poor functional outcome in patients\nwith ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.5\u00ad8\nIt is well known that angiotensin II (Ang II) has profound\neffects on cardiovascular diseases acting via its binding to\ntwo main cell surface receptors, AT1 and AT2. Ang II sign-\naling has been associated with development of deleterious\ntissue repair after myocardial infarction through regulating\nmonocyte motility and release from the splenic reservoir.2 In\na mouse model of permanent coronary occlusion, enalapril,\nan angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, reduced\nthe release of monocytes from the spleen and subsequently\ninhibited the recruitment of monocytes into the infarct site.\nThis inhibition in macrophage accumulation in ischemic\nmyocardium was reproduced by splenectomy.9 In this\nregard, we have recently reported that four weeks of con-\ntinuous administration of Ang II to rats enhances mac-\nrophage accumulation and myofibroblast proliferation in\nthe myocardium, which was significantly inhibited by an\nAT1 receptor blocker, telmisartan. Consequently, deposition\nof collagen in perivascular coronary vessels and interstitial\nmyocardium was attenuated. In that study, we found that the\nextravasation and distribution of macrophages in the myo-\ncardium is the most important feature in activation of myofi-\nbroblast/TGF1/Smads-mediated fibrotic signaling.10\nAlthough previous studies have identified the splenic\nreservoir monocytes as a major source of macrophages\nthat accumulate in the infarcted myocardium,2,9 it is\nunknown whether splenic monocytes contribute to Ang\nII-induced macrophage accumulation in the myocardium\nand subsequent cardiac fibrosis and hypertension. Hence,\nthe purpose of this study was designed to evaluate whether\nsplenic release of monocytes participates in Ang II-elicited\ncardiac fibrosis and hypertension by modulating the popu-\nlation of macrophages in the myocardium and blood vessel\nin the in vivo rat model of Ang II infusion. Specifically, the\neffects of splenectomy and the AT1 receptor blockade on\nmonocyte/macrophage recruitment, monocyte chemoat-\ntractant protein-1 (MCP-1), TGF1/Smads, collagens and\nendothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) were examined\nas well as the interstitial/perivascular fibrosis and hyper-\ntension were assessed.\nMaterials and methods\nAnimals and noninvasive blood pressure\nmeasurement\nThe animal experimental procedures were approved by the\nInstitutional Animal Care and Use Committee, Mercer\nUniversity School of Medicine. Male Sprague-Dawley rats\nweighing 200\u00b110 g obtained from the Harlan Laboratories,\nIndianapolis, Indiana, USA were kept individually in a\n12-hour light/dark cycle, 60% humidity and temperature-\ncontrolled room with standard rat chow and water ad libi-\ntum. These procedures were in compliance with The Guide\nfor the Care of Use of Laboratory Animals.11 The blood\npressure was determined in conscious rats using a noninva-\nsive blood pressure measuring system (PowerLab, ML125\nAD Instruments NIBP controller, Colorado, USA). This\nsystem detects the signals via a pulse transducer during the\nperiodic occlusion of blood flow in the tail.\nOsmotic minipump implantation and\nsplenectomy\nThe rats were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection\nof a mixture of ketamine (90 mg/kg) and zylaxine (10 mg/\nkg) and implanted subcutaneously with osmotic minipumps\n(Model 2004, ALZET Corp, California, USA) in the dorsal\nregion to deliver Ang II. The pumps were preincubated in\nthe tubes with 0.9% sterile saline only or saline containing\nAng II at 37\u00baC overnight prior to implantation. In rats that\nreceived splenectomy, a midline skin incision was made\nafter the skin was shaved and sterilized with povidone-\niodine and alcohol. The splenic blood vessels were ligated\nafter the abdominal cavity was made. The spleen was\nremoved by transecting the vessels just distal to the ligature\nand the skin incision was then closed with sutures.\nExperimental design and study group\nFour weeks of experimental period was selected for all\nexperimental groups. Five concurrent groups of rats were\nrandomly assigned: (a) vehicle\u00adinfused rats (Sham, n=7):\nrats received saline minipump infusion; (b) Ang II-infused\nrats (Ang II, n=7): rats received subcutaneous Ang II infu-\nsion at a rate of 500 ng/kg/min (Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri,\nUSA); (c) splenectomy+Ang II infusion rats (Splen, n=7):\nrats received Ang II infusion at day 2 after splenectomy;\n(d) telmisartan+Ang II (Telmi, n=7): telmisartan\n(Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Ridgefield,\nConnecticut, USA) was administered at a dose of 10 mg/\nkg/day by gastric gavage starting day 1 after Ang II min-\nipump implantation; (e) splenectomy+telmisartan+Ang II\ninfusion rats (S+T, n=6): rats received telmisartan by gas-\ntric gavage after splenectomy and during Ang II infusion.\nAt the end of four weeks of the experimental period, the\nrats from different groups were euthanized. The hearts and\nproximal thoracic aortas were removed.\nWestern blot analysis of the AT1 receptor,\nMCP-1, TGF1, Smads and collagens in the\nspleen and myocardium\nThe freshly-frozen transmural tissue samples from the\nspleen and myocardium were homogenized in ice-cold\nWang et al. 3\nlysis buffer. Total proteins (60 g) were extracted, frac-\ntionated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis,\nand transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane as\ndescribed previously.10 The membrane was then incubated\nat 4\u00b0C overnight with the following antibodies: rabbit anti-\nies (Santa Cruz Biotech, Dallas, Texas, USA), a rabbit\nanti-MCP-1 polyclonal antibody and a mouse monoclonal\nUSA), rabbit anti-phospho-Smad2/3 monoclonal antibod-\nies (1:1000, Cell Signaling, Massachusetts, USA), mouse\nanti-collagen type I and III monoclonal antibodies (1:5000,\nSigma Chemical Co., Missouri, USA), respectively. Bound\nantibody was detected by horseradish peroxidase-conju-\ngated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG)). The mem-\nbrane was incubated with chemiluminescence detection\nreagents and exposed to a X-ray film. The images were\nthen imported into the ImageJ (National Institute of Health\n(NIH), Massachusetts, USA) and quantified as a ratio\nbased on the density of the target protein band divided by\nactin to correct differences during protein loading and/or\ntransfer.\nImmunohistochemical staining of Ang II receptors,\nmacrophages, myofibroblasts and eNOS in the\nspleen, myocardium, and thoracic aorta\nAll paraffin-embedded tissue sections (4 m thick) were\ndewaxed in xylene, and rehydrated through graded alco-\nhols as previously reported.10 Briefly, the sections were\nincubated overnight with primary antibodies including a\nrabbit anti-AT1 receptor polyclonal antibody (1:200, Santa\nCruz Biotech, Dallas, Texas, USA), a mouse anti-rat mon-\nMillipore, California, USA), a monoclonal antibody\nagainst -smooth muscle actin (SMA; 1:800, Sigma\nChemical Co., Missouri, USA) and a rabbit polyclonal\nantibodyagainsteNOS(1:200,Abcam,Inc.,Massachusetts,\nUSA), respectively. The slides were incubated with a bioti-\nnylated horse anti-rabbit IgG or an anti-mouse IgG (Vector\nLaboratories, California, USA), stained using the ABC-\nperoxidase kit or ABC-AR (alkaline phosphatase; Vector\nLaboratories, California, USA) and visualized with\n3,3'-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride or alkaline\nphosphatase substrate kit (Sigma, Missouri, USA). Quality\nof immunohistochemistry assay was controlled by either\nelimination of the primary antibody or incubation of the\ntissue with a non-immune IgG. Sections were counter-\nstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, and mounted by\nroutine methods. The density in expression of the AT1\nreceptor and eNOS, the accumulation of macrophages and\n-SMA\u00adexpressing myofibroblasts among groups were\ncompared using computer-assisted morphometry (ImageJ,\nNIH). The final results were reported from the eight rand-\nomized high-powered fields.\nMasson's trichrome staining of collagen\ndeposition in the heart and thoracic aorta\nThe transversal myocardial blocks and proximal thoracic\naorta were fixed in phosphate-buffered formalin solution\nand dehydrated in graded series of alcohol, and then\nembedded in paraffin as previously reported.10 Samples\nwere sectioned to a thickness of 6 m using a Microtome\n(Leica RM2135, Meyer Instruments, Texas, USA) and\nstained by Masson's trichrome method producing colla-\ngen blue, nuclei black and muscle fiber red. Ten rand-\nomized high-powered fields (HPFs) per tissue section\nwere evaluated to define the perivascular fibrosis,\nexpressed as the area of perivascular fibrosis divided by\nthe area of the vascular wall, i.e. perivascular fibrosis\nratio (PFR).12 The interstitial fibrosis was quantitated as\nthe positively stained collagen area (i.e. blue staining in\nthe interstitial myocardium) and expressed as percentage\nfibrotic area per HPF. The fibrotic area of thoracic aorta\nwas visualized by the fibrotic thickness in the adventitia\nand calculated as the micrometer per HPF. All histologi-\ncal evaluation was performed by a single well-trained\nobserver using a digital image analyzer (ImageJ, NIH,\nMassachusetts, USA).\nStatistical analysis\nData were reported as the mean\u00b1standard error. A one-\nway analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Student-\nNewman-Keul's post-hoc test was used to analyze group\ndifferences in the intensity of AT1/AT2 receptors, the\npopulations of macrophages and myofibroblasts, the\nexpression of TGF1, collagens, and phospho-Smads\nusing SigmaPlot (Systat Software Inc., California, USA).\nStatistical significance was set at a value of p<0.05.\nResults\nIdentification of monocytes and expression of\nthe AT1 receptor in the red pulp of the spleen\nHistological features of the spleen in rat are shown in\nFigure 1(a). The spleen is composed of two functionally\nand morphologically distinct tissues, the white pulp and\nthe red pulp. The white pulp regions of the spleen consist\nof lymphatic tissue containing T lymphocytes and B lym-\nphocytes that are responsible for destroying pathogens in\nthe blood and producing antibodies. The red pulp makes\nup 75% of the volume of the spleen and serves as an\nimportant reservoir for large quantities of phagocytic white\nblood cells called monocytes. To further demonstrate the\ndistribution of monocytes and the expression of the AT1\nreceptor, we stained the tissue sections of the spleen using\nimmunohistochemistry. As shown in Figure 1(b), mono-\ncytes and the AT1 receptor were predominately localized\nand expressed in the red pulp.\n4 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 00(0)\nInfusion of Ang II increased the protein level\nand expression of the AT1 receptor and\nreduced the monocyte population in the red\npulp of the spleen\nThe protein level of the AT1 receptor and its expression in\nthe red pulp were analyzed using Western blot assay and\nimmunohistochemistry. As shown in Figure 2(a), infusion\nof Ang II for four weeks significantly increased the protein\nlevel of the AT1 receptor relative to the sham group.\nPositive immunohistostaining for the AT1 receptor was\nfound in the red pulp during the course of the experiment in\nthe sham group but the immunohistostaining intensity of\nthe AT1 receptor was markedly enhanced with Ang II infu-\nsion at week 4 (Figure 2(b)). Consistent with changes in the\nAT1 receptor protein and expression, the population of\nmonocytes in the red pulp was significantly reduced with\nAng II infusion relative to the sham control (Figure 2(c)).\nTreatment with telmisartan over four weeks abrogated the\nupregulated AT1 receptor. The protein level and expression\nof the AT1 receptor were significantly attenuated, coincid-\ning with preserved numbers of monocytes in the red pulp\n(Figure 2(c)), suggesting a role of Ang II in the release of\nmonocytes in the spleen via stimulating the AT1 receptor.\nThe AT2 receptor was constitutively expressed in the\nspleen. Relative to the sham group, the infusion of Ang II\nand administration of theAT1 receptor blocker, telmisartan,\ndid not alter expression of the AT2 receptor (Figure 2(a)).\nBlockade of the AT1 receptor reduced the\nprotein level of MCP-1 in the spleen and\nmacrophage accumulation in the heart:\ncomparison to the splenectomy\nMCP-1 is a potent chemoattractant specific for monocytes\nand known to be associated with monocyte migration.\nAs shown in Figure 2(d), MCP-1 was constitutively\nFigure 1.

White pulp is lymphatic tissue that mainly consists of lymphocytes called\nB-lymphocytes and T-lymphocytes that surround arteries. Venous sinuses are essentially cavities filled with blood. The presence\nof macrophages and expression of the AT1 receptor were confirmed by immunohistochemistry (b). In a higher magnification of\nthe cross-section, it was found that monocytes are predominantly located within the red pulp, where the positively stained AT1\nreceptor shown as brown granular pigment was identified.

To associate\nthe release of monocytes from the spleen with the mac-\nrophage accumulation in the heart, the distribution of\nmacrophages in the heart after splenectomy and the AT1\nblockade was compared. As shown in Figure 3(a), the\nnumber of macrophages was significantly reduced after\nsplenectomy to a comparable level shown as the number\nFigure 2.

To\naddress whether this is a potential signaling mechanism\ninvolved in inhibition of myofibroblast proliferation in the\nheart after splenectomy and the AT1 receptor antagonism,\nTGF1 expression and myofibroblast proliferation were\ndetected using Western blot assay and immunohistochem-\nistry. As shown in Figure 3(b), Ang II infusion caused a\nsignificant increase in TGF1 protein level at week 4.\nAlong with an augmentation in expression of TGF1 pro-\ntein, the number of positively-stained -SMA-expressing\nmyofibroblasts was increased, suggesting a role of TGF1\nin myofibroblast proliferation (Figure 3(c)). Splenectomy\nbefore Ang II infusion or treatment with telmisartan over\nfour weeks reduced the protein level of TGF1 and myofi-\nbroblast proliferation. No further inhibition in macrophage\naccumulation, TGF1 expression, and myofibroblast pro-\nliferation was observed when treated with splenectomy\nand telmisartan (Figure 3).\nSplenectomy and the AT1 receptor antagonism\nreduced production of phosph-Smad2/3 and\ncollagen I/III in the heart\nPhosphorylation of Smads stimulates the synthesis of col-\nlagens following myofibroblast proliferation.

Splenectomy before Ang II\ninfusion or treatment with telmisartan over four weeks\nreduced phosphorylated levels of Smad2 and Smad3,\nwhich was in compliance with an inhibition of protein lev-\nels of collagen I and III. Splenectomy plus administration\nof telmisartan during Ang II infusion did not further affect\nthe protein levels of Smad2/3 and collagen I/III throughout\nthe experiment (Figure 4).\nSplenectomy and the AT1 receptor antagonism\ninhibited intermyocardial and perivascular\nfibrosis in the heart\nThe scale of intermyocardial fibrosis and the ratio of\nperivascular fibrosis were examined using Masson's tri-\nchrome method. Consistent with increased synthesis of\ncollagens, the production of fibrotic tissue in the inter-\nmyocardium and perivascular region was augmented with\nAng II infusion. At week 4, percent fibrotic area in the\nmyocardium (Figure 5(a)) and fibrotic ratio in the perivas-\ncular area (Figure 5(b)) were significantly increased at\nweek 4. Splenectomy before Ang II infusion or treatment\nwith telmisartan over four weeks significantly reduced the\nfibrotic tissue formation induced by Ang II infusion.\nCombination of splenectomy plus administration of tel-\nmisartan during Ang II infusion provided a comparable\ninhibition in fibrosis formation in the myocardium and\nperivascular region when compared with each individual\nintervention (Figure 5).\nSplenectomy and the AT1 receptor antagonism\nreduced blood pressure, attenuated\nmacrophage invasion and myofibroblast\nproliferation as well as augmented eNOS\nexpression in the proximal thoracic aorta\nFormation of perivascular and interstitial fibrosis is asso-\nciated with an increase in blood pressure.

With these improvements, the aortic\nwall thickness was reduced in both splenectomy and tel-\nin the Ang II group, p=0.04), indicating less smooth muscle\nproliferation and medial hypertrophy. These data suggest\nthat Ang II-induced vascular remolding is associated with\ninvasion of macrophages into the aortic walls by an AT1\nreceptor-mediated process. No further modulation in infil-\ntration of macrophages, proliferation of myofibroblasts,\nexpression of eNOS and the AT1 receptor as well as adven-\ntitial fibrotic area was observed when splenectomy and tel-\nmisartan treatment were combined relative to each\nintervention alone (Figure 7).\nDiscussion\nRecent studies highlight the role of splenic reservoir-\nderived monocytes/macrophages in the development of\nmyocardial infarction and heart failure.

This is the\nfirst study to illustrate that the release of monocytes from\ntheir splenic reservoir to the heart plays an important role\nin development of Ang II-induced cardiac fibrosis and\nhypertension. We demonstrate that, in the normal condi-\ntion, monocytes presented in the red pulp of the spleen,\nan area extremely rich in macrophages, primarily express\nthe AT1 receptor. Ang II infusion caused a significant\naccumulation of macrophages in the heart after the AT1\nreceptor is activated in the spleen, potentially through acti-\nvating MCP-1.

In this regard, other factors such as production of\nreactive oxidant species and inflammatory cytokines in the\nheart in addition to recruitment of macrophages may also\nparticipate in Ang II-induced cardiac fibrosis.16,17\nWe have previously shown that blockade of the AT1\nreceptor has inhibitory effects on myocardial fibrosis and\nhypertension through activating the AT2 receptor.10 To\nensure the relative contribution of splenic monocytes to\ncardiac fibrosis via the AT1 receptor antagonism, we also\nmeasured expression of the AT2 receptor in the spleen. As\nshown in Figure 2, the AT2 receptor is normally expressed\nin the spleen, but its expression was not altered by Ang II\ninfusion and telmisartan, excluding a role of the AT2\nreceptor in mobilization of splenic monocytes. MCP-1, a\npotent mononuclear cell chemoattractant, is reported to be\nFigure 6. Change in blood pressure during angiotensin II (Ang II) infusion.

The\navailable evidence suggests that the induction of MCP-1\nin response to Ang II is associated with mobilization of\nmacrophages through the production of inflammatory\ncytokines.18 In the present study, following the AT1 recep-\ntor antagonism, expression of MCP-1 in the spleen was\ndownregulated and the population of macrophages was\npreserved, evidenced by less accumulation of mac-\nrophages in the myocardium. These results suggested that\nlocal production of MCP-1 in the spleen can be consid-\nered as a potential mechanism by which macrophages are\nmobilized to the heart. This mobilization of monocytes/\nmacrophages from the spleen to the heart is activated by\nthe AT1 receptor.\nTGF- has been thought to be a key factor in the pro-\ngression of myocardial lesions following Ang II stimula-\ntion.19,20 TGF1 produced from activated macrophages\ncontributes to tissue fibrosis by stimulating Smads signal-\ning and releasing extracellular matrix, primarily collagens\nfrom myocardial myofibroblasts.10,21 In the present study,\ndifferentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts was identi-\nfied by the number of -SMA-expressing positive cells in\nthe heart. We found that, along with a reduction in migra-\ntion of monocytes from the spleen and macrophage accu-\nmulation in the heart by telmisartan, expression of TGF1\nand Smad2//3 was inhibited to a comparable level as seen\nafter splenectomy. Immunohistochemical assessment of\nsplenectomy/telmisartan-treated rats during Ang II infu-\nsion showed a significant resolution of normalizing the\nfibrotic parameters such as the number of -SMA-\nexpressing myofibroblasts and protein levels of collagens\nin the heart. Histological data presented at week 4 also\nshowed attenuation in tissue fibrosis as measured by a\nlower extent of collagen deposition. It is known that the\nspleen may have some beneficial effects on wound healing\nFigure 7. Representative photomicrographs of aortic cross sections stained with immunohistochemistry and Masson's trichrome\nmethod. In each high-powered field (HPF; original magnification: \u00d7400; scale bars: 100 \u00b5m), the recruitment of macrophages (MAC;\n(a)) and myofibroblasts (MYOFIB, (b)) in aortic intima and adventitia was determined by the number of positively-stained cells (brown\nand red granular pigments as indicated by arrows). Expression of eNOS (c) and the AT1 receptor (d) was identified by brown staining\nin the aortic intima and media. Collagen deposition in aorta (e) was analyzed by the thickness of adventitial fibrotic area shown as\nblue staining.

However, we found\nthat the fibrotic myocardium is still detected in the sple-\nnectomy/telmisartan-treated animals. Therefore, we can-\nnot exclude the possibility that progenitor macrophages\nreleased from the bone marrow or resident macrophages in\nthe heart may also participate in the Ang II-stimulated car-\ndiac fibrosis,23,24 which may not be altered by splenec-\ntomy/telmisartan. Furthermore, using flow cytometry\nmay help to quantitatively distinguish subtypes of mono-\ncytes in the spleen and demonstrate the surface marker\nexpression of monocytes after the AT1 receptor stimula-\ntion.2 Subendothelial infiltration of monocyte/mac-\nrophages has previously been reported to be associated\nwith endothelial dysfunction and spontaneous hyperten-\nsion.25 Treatment with an ACE inhibitor lowed blood\npressure by reducing subendothelial accumulation of\nmonocyte/macrophages.26 A recent study has also shown\nthat depletion of macrophages using liposome-encapsu-\nlated clodronate reduces blood pressure and vascular free\nradicals.27 In the present study, we found that Ang II,\nthrough the AT1 receptor, significantly increases blood\npressure by provoking adverse vascular remodeling.\nImmunohistochemistry revealed that reduction in inva-\nsion of macrophages and myofibroblasts in the aortic\nendothelium and adventitia by splenectomy to a compara-\nble level as seen in the AT1 receptor antagonism suggests\na role of monocytes/macrophages mobilized from the\nsplenic reservoir in the formation of fibrotic thoracic aorta.\nIt is well known that downregulated eNOS from the\nendothelium is related to impairment of endothelium-\ndependent relaxation and production of vascular prolifera-\ntion/hypertrophy during hypertension.28\u00ad30 We found that,\nin absence of the AT1 receptor stimulation by Ang II in the\nsham condition, eNOS is constitutively expressed in the\nendothelium and tunica media. We and others have previ-\nously shown that activation of the AT1 receptor enhances\nexpression of adhesion molecules such as intercellular\nadhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion\nmolecule-1 (VCAM-1), facilitates migration of inflamma-\ntory cells such as neutrophils and macrophages, and\nreduces eNOS expression.31\u00ad33 In these studies, downreg-\nulation of eNOS by TNF released from macrophages was\nidentified. Our data were consistent with these findings. In\nthe present study, telmisartan blocked the AT1 receptor,\ninhibited macrophage migration, and upregulated eNOS.\nEnhancement in eNOS expression by splenectomy further\nsupported that macrophages recruited in the aorta from the\nspleen reservoir may participate in vascular remodeling by\ndownregulating eNOS expression in Ang II-receiving rats.\nIn this regard, vascular/myocardial fibrosis in response to\nAng II stimulation has been associated with elevated blood\nreduction in the perivascular fibrosis and aortic hyper-\ntrophy by splenectomy and telmisartan, as identified by a\nreduction in intimal/medial thickness, the blood pressure\nwas significantly reduced, indicating a role of macrophages\nin induction of high blood pressure.\nLimitations of this study are expressed as follows.\nFirst, although we found that macrophage migration from\nthe spleen is mediated by MCP-1, also known as CCL2\n(CC chemokine ligand 2), after activating the AT1 recep-\ntor, the direct cause-effect relationship between MCP-1\nand macrophage migration needs to be further explored\nusing CCL2 knockout mice in the presence of Ang II.\nshown the alternative inhibitory role after the AT1 recep-\ntor blockade in Ang II\u00admediated cardiac and vascular\neffects, i.e. activation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2\n(ACE2)-Mas receptor, we do not know whether this path-\nway is also associated with an inhibition of macrophage\nmigration from the spleen. Therefore, studies are needed\nto compare the potency of splenectomy and ACE2 analog\nin modulation of macrophages in animals receiving Ang\nII. Finally, we showed that splenectomy or telmisartan\nreduces blood pressure. However, we cannot exclude the\npossibility that reduction in blood pressure by these inter-\nventions is directly linked to an attenuation of Ang\nII-driven tissue fibrosis. Therefore, using a model of\ntransverse aorta constriction might allow us to differenti-\nate the blood pressure-dependent and/or -independent\neffects of these interventions on myocardial/vascular\nfibrosis.10,16 Furthermore, it remains to be determined\nwhether acute infusion of Ang II after splenectomy affects\nthe blood count of monocytes and blood pressure.\nConclusions\nAlthough signaling in tissue fibrosis and hypertension is a\nhighly complex process involving many cell types and\nsignaling molecules, we demonstrate novel mechanistic\ninsights involved in Ang II-induced perivascular/intersti-\ntial fibrosis and hypertension through migrating mono-\ncytes/macrophages from the spleen reservoir via the AT1\nreceptor. Macrophages mobilized from the spleen to the\nheart trigger proliferation of myofibroblasts through\nTGF1, and activate Smads-mediated collagen synthesis\nand myocardial fibrosis. On the other hand, stimulation of\nthe AT1 receptor also causes invasion of macrophages into\nthe thoracic aorta and induces a fibrotic response, and\nthereby promotes vascular hypertrophy/stiffness and\nhypertension. However, the favorable and unfavorable\neffects after splenectomy have also been identified clini-\ncally.39,40 We cannot comment on the clinical application\nof splenectomy in patients based on the current data, but,\nour findings might be useful in exploring how therapeutics\nalready established, for example, ACE inhibitors or angi-\notensin receptor blockers, affect macrophage biology.\nTherefore, the development of macrophage-targeted new\ntherapeutic interventions may further prevent cardiac\nfibrosis and vascular hypertrophy during hypertension.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article:\nThis study was supported in part by grants from the Mercer\nUniversity School of Medicine, the Medcen Community Health\nFoundation, Georgia, USA and the National Natural Science\nReferences\n1.
