The aim\nof this study was to add to the literature on liability to initiate and use cigarettes during adolescence using\na nationally representative sample. Method: Data for this study came from adolescent and young adult\ntwin pairs (aged 14\u00ad33 years) from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. We\nran a series of developmental causal\u00adcontingent\u00adcommon pathway models to examine whether additive\ngenetic, shared, and unique environmental influences on liability to the initiation of cigarette use are shared\nwith those on smoking quantity, and whether their contributions change across development. Results: We\nfound evidence for a developmental shift in genetic and shared environmental contributions to cigarette\nuse. Early in adolescence, genetic and environmental influences work independently on liability to cigarette\nsmoking initiation and quantity of cigarettes smoked, but liability to these behaviors becomes correlated\nas individuals age into young adulthood. Conclusions: These findings provide insight into the causal pro-\ncesses underlying the liability to smoke cigarettes. With age, there is greater overlap in the genetic and\nenvironmental factors that influence the initiation of cigarette smoking and quantity of cigarettes smoked.\nKeywords: adolescents, development, genetic influences, environmental influences, cigarette smoking\nTobacco use during adolescence continues to be a serious\npublic health concern associated with increased mortality\nand personal and public costs (Substance Abuse and Mental\nHealth Services Administration [SAMHSA], 2009).

As adolescents reach late adolescence and\nyoung adulthood, additive genetic factors become increas-\ningly more important (Kendler et al., 2008; Koopmans et al.,\nDue to the conditional nature of drug use (Kendler et al.,\n1999b), properly estimating the heritability of smoking\nquantity requires employing a conditional model that takes\ninto account the heritability of cigarette smoking initiation.\nThe appropriate method to examine additive genetic and\nshared environmental factors to liability of drug use quan-\ntity is a causal\u00adcontingent\u00adcommon (CCC) pathway model\n(Kendleretal.,1999a)thatallowsfortheconcurrentestima-\ntion of quantity conditional on drug use initiation as well\nas for estimating the relationship between drug use initia-\ntion and drug use quantity (see Figure 1).

In a study of 11- to 19-year-old twins, the\nsameadditivegeneticandsharedenvironmentalfactorsthat\ninfluenced initiation of cigarette use were found to con-\ntribute to the variance in the number of cigarettes smoked\n(Fowler et al., 2007). The present study extends previous\nresearch in this area (Do et al., 2015; \u00a8\ncharacterizing in greater detail the developmental changes\nin the heritability of the quantity of cigarettes smoked per\nday conditional on cigarette use initiation across different\nage groups spanning adolescence and young adulthood and\ntesting for age-specific sex differences among twins from a\nnationally representative US sample.\nMaterial and Methods\nSample\nData for this study came from twin pairs available in the\nNational Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health\nstudy recruited adolescent participants when they were\nenrolled in high school and subsequently assessed them\nthrough three in-home interviews, for four waves of longi-\ntudinal data. In the first wave, participants' age ranged from\n12 to 17 years and in the last wave, participants ranged in\nage from 28 to 33 years. At each wave of the four-wave\nlongitudinal study, participants reported on whether they\nhad ever smoked a cigarette, and if they indicated they had\nsmoked, they were subsequently asked how many cigarettes\nthey had smoked per day in the previous 30 days.\nZygosityofthetwinpairswasdeterminedbymatchingon\n12 molecular genetic markers and through self-report ques-\ntionsregardingthetwins'similarity(Harrisetal.,2006).For\nthis study, participants were divided into five groups based\non sex and zygosity (monozygotic males (MZM), monozy-\ngotic females (MZF), dizygotic males (DZM), dizygotic fe-\nmales (DZF), and opposite sex dizygotic twins (DZO) so\nthat we could test for qualitative and quantitative sex differ-\nencesinthesourcesofgeneticandenvironmentalinfluences\non the phenotypes.\nIn the Add Health study, data were available for 740\nyears), the prevalence of smoking was very low and no par-\nticipants smoked more than 11 cigarettes per day, so data\nfor this age group was not used.

Tetra-\nchoric and polychoric correlations for cigarette smoking\ninitiation and cigarette smoking quantity are available in\nTables 2 and 3 respectively.\nMeasures\nThe aim of this study was to examine developmental\nchanges in the etiology of smoking cigarettes, so cigarette\nsmoking initiation and cigarette smoking quantity variables\nwere created for each available age in the Add Health data.\nThe smoking initiation variable was coded 1 when partic-\nipants responded yes, or 0 when the answer was no to the\nsurvey question: `Have you ever smoked a cigarette?' Sub-\nsequently, those participants who answered yes to having\ninitiated smoking were asked how many cigarettes they had\nsmoked in the previous 30 days. The answer to this question\nwas used to create the smoking quantity variable. In Wave 3\nof the Add Health data, the options available to participants\nto respond to the question about how many cigarettes they\nhad smoked in the previous 30 days were ordinal categories\nrather than open-ended, as in waves 1, 2, and 4. Therefore,\nthe quantity smoked variable used in the present analyses\nwas an ordered categorical variable such that `0' referred to\nnot having smoked any cigarettes in the previous 30 days,\n`1' referred to smoking between 1 and 11 cigarettes per day,\nand `2' indicated smoking more than 11 cigarettes per day.\nFurther, those participants who reported not having ever\nsmoked a cigarette (the never smokers) were coded as hav-\ning missing information for the smoking quantity variable\nas has been suggested by Neale and colleagues (2006).\nAnalysis Plan\nBehavioral genetic studies are designed to uncover the\nsources of individual differences that give rise to variations\nCristina B. Bares, Kenneth S. Kendler and Hermine H. Maes\nin a phenotype and take advantage of the differences in the\nproportion of segregating genes between pairs of monozy-\ngotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins who are reared to-\ngether. MZ twins share 100% of their segregating genes,\nwhile DZ twins share on average 50% of their genes. If\ngenetic factors contribute to a phenotype then MZ twins\nwould be expected to be more similar than DZ twins. The\nvariance in a phenotype is partitioned into additive genetic\n(A), shared environmental (C), or unique environmental\n(E) sources, where additive genetic sources of variance in-\nvolve the cumulative effects of individual genes on a phe-\nnotype. Shared environmental sources are aspects of the\nenvironment that both twins experience and increase their\nsimilarity. Non-shared environmental sources of variance\nare aspects of the environment that contribute to making\ntwinsdifferentinthesamefamily.Measurementerrorisalso\ncontained in the non-shared environmental component.\nThe first step in data analysis involved testing the as-\nsumptions that the thresholds for cigarette smoking initia-\ntion were equal across twin order, sex, and zygosity for each\nage group. Then univariate analyses for binary variables de-\ncomposed the variance of cigarette smoking initiation into\nadditive genetic (A), shared environmental (C), and unique\nenvironmental (E) sources and tested sex differences. Two\ntypes of sex differences were tested for: differences in the\nmagnitude of genetic effects between males and females\n(quantitative sex differences) as well as differences due to\na different set of genes influencing the phenotype in males\nthan in females (qualitative sex differences). Quantitative\nand qualitative sex differences in cigarette smoking initia-\ntion were tested by comparing the likelihood statistic (-2LL)\nproduced by reduced models with the likelihood of the full\nmodel. The difference in likelihood between the two models\nis known as the likelihood ratio test and is asymptotically\ndistributed as 2.\nCausal\u00adcontingent\u00adcommon analyses. Age-specific CCC\ndered categorical variables were run, starting with a full,\nsex-specific model where the three sources (A, C, E) of vari-\nance were included for both cigarette smoking initiation\nand cigarette quantity smoked, and included a common\npathway between initiation and quantity (Model 1). First,\nan overall test for sex differences was performed (Model\n2), followed by an overall test for the significance of ge-\nnetic factors for both smoking initiation (ai in Figure 1)\nand smoking quantity (aq in Figure 1) at once (Model 3),\nand shared environmental contributions to smoking initia-\ntion and smoking quantity simultaneously (Model 4). The\nsignificance of the common pathway between smoking ini-\ntiation and quantity smoked (b in Figure 1) was tested at\neach age group (Model 5). A common pathway coefficient\nof 0 would indicate that smoking initiation and quantity\nsmoked are independent processes for that particular age\ngroup, while a common pathway coefficient of 1 would in-\ndicate that smoking quantity is on the same continuum\nas smoking initiation. The statistical significance of the\nvariance components for smoking initiation (ai and ci in\nFigure 1) and for smoking quantity (aq and cq in Figure 1)\nwas tested separately by fixing each to zero and examining\nmodel fit (Models 6\u00ad9). Analyses were done in R (RCore,\nResults\nPrevalence of lifetime cigarette use by age group is presented\nin Table 1.

The\nproportion of heavy smokers was highest in the 16- to 17-\n(8.7%). Table 1 presents the prevalence of lifetime cigarette\nuse and quantity of cigarettes smoked by sex and zygosity.\nAge-Specific Univariate Models of Smoking Initiation\nFor each age group, we first fitted a saturated model, where\nthe thresholds and correlations for cigarette smoking initi-\nation were allowed to vary by twin order, sex, and zygosity.\nThen twin model assumptions were tested by evaluating\nchanges in model fit when the thresholds were constrained\nacross twin order, zygosity, same- and opposite-sex twins,\nand for males and females (results available upon request).\nThresholds could be equated across twin order, zygosity\n(except at young adulthood), same- and opposite sex, and\nmales and females (except in the oldest age group).

There was no evidence of\nqualitative or quantitative sex differences in cigarette smok-\ning initiation at any of the age groups (results available upon\nrequest).\nAge-Specific Causal\u00adContingent\u00adCommon Pathway\nModels\nFor the 14- to 15-year-old group, the full CCC path-\nway model allowed the loadings of variance components\nfor cigarette smoking initiation and quantity of cigarettes\nsmoked to be freely estimated across sexes (Table 4, Model\n1).

The influence of risk factors for quantity of cigarettes\nsmoked that exert their influence through their effect on\nsmoking initiation was found to increase through adoles-\ncence and into young adulthood. For the 14- to 15-year-old\nage group, we found that risk factors influencing smoking\ninitiation were independent of those that contributed to\nsmoking quantity. In the three older age groups, the risk\nfactors predisposing to smoking initiation were correlated\nwith those that influence smoking quantity (98%, 62%, and\n65%, respectively) suggesting substantial overlap in the fac-\ntors that influence initiating cigarette use and the number\nof cigarettes smoked among older adolescents and young\nadults.\nWe present estimates of the variance components for the\nsame model across all age groups (Table 5), even though\nthe causal path was not significant for age group 14\u00ad15 and\nsome of the genetic and shared environmental contribu-\ntions were not significant. We estimated that for the 14- to\n15-year-old age group, 42% of the variance in liability to\nsmoking initiation was accounted for by additive genetic\nfactors, 46% by shared environmental factors, and 12% by\nnon-shared environmental factors. Only non-shared envi-\nronmental factors accounted for a significant portion of\nthe variance (63%) in quantity of cigarettes smoked. In\nthe 16- to 17-year-olds, 43% of the variance in liability to\nsmoking initiation was accounted for by additive genetic\nfactors, 10% was attributable to the shared environment,\nand 26% by non-shared environment. The additive genetic\nand shared environmental influences on smoking initia-\ntion were found to be almost completely shared with those\nthat influence smoking quantity (causal path estimated at\n0.93) but no additional genetic effects or shared environ-\nmental effects were found for this age group to influence\nthe quantity of cigarettes smoked.

For the youngest age group, addi-\ntive genetic and shared environmental factors were found\nto contribute to the liability of smoking initiation, but there\nwere no new additive genetic or shared environmental in-\nfluences specific to the liability of smoking quantity. Pre-\nvious adolescent and young adult twin studies that have\nestimated the heritability of cigarettes smoked contingent\non cigarette use initiation have included twins of a broader\na time when the etiology of smoking behavior is chang-\ning rapidly. The differences in the results observed in the\npresent study compared with previous findings may be\ndue to our age-specific focus, which uncovered a develop-\nmental change that may have been previously overlooked.\nConsistent with our findings, recently, Do and colleagues\n(2015) reported no evidence of new additive genetic ef-\nfects on the quantity of cigarettes smoked in early adoles-\ncence. As individuals aged into late adolescence and young\nadulthood, the influence of additive genetic factors became\nmore important for the initiation of cigarette use, a find-\ning that is consistent with previous research (Do et al.,\nmental influences did not contribute significantly to the\nliability to initiate smoking but additive genetic effects were\nsignificant.\nWe show that there are changes in the overlap of addi-\ntive genetic and environmental factors that play a role in\nthe initiation of smoking during early adolescence and into\nyoung adulthood.

First, to examine devel-\nopmental changes, the sample of available twins in the data\nwas divided into groups according to age, and this may have\nreduced the power to detect significant sex effects, especially\nat the youngest ages where the sample of twin pairs was\n287. Second, to have a comparable quantity smoked vari-\nable across each assessment, we turned a continuous mea-\nsure of cigarettes smoked per day into an ordinal variable,\nwhich may have resulted in loss of information to detect\nindividual differences. Lastly, recent research has indicated\nimportant racial/ethnic differences in age of smoking on-\nset (Clark et al., 2013), in quantity of cigarettes smoked\n(Gutman et al., 2011), and in the development of nicotine\ndependence (Duncan et al., 2012). In the present analy-\nses, we did not test for the possibility that additive genetic\ninfluences on the liability to initiate smoking and on the\nquantity of cigarettes smoked would differ by racial/ethnic\nbackground.\n"
