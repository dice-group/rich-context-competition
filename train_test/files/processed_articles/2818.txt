Any remaining errors are the\nauthor's responsibility. The views expressed in this paper are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily\ncoincide with the views of the Deutsche Bundesbank or the Eurosystem.\n1 Introduction\nAfter reaching the zero lower bound on interest rates many central banks like the Federal\nReserve (Fed), the Bank of England (BoE), the Bank of Japan (BoJ), and the European\nCentral Bank (ECB) embarked on so-called unconventional monetary policy measures\nto stimulate their economies. These measures included new communication strategies,\nnegative interest rates, liquidity injections, and large-scale asset purchases (LSAP). These\nmeasures are sizable. Since their introduction in the Eurozone, the balance sheet of the\nECB has increased from approximately 1.1 trillion EUR in January 2007 to 4.5 trillion\nEUR in January 2018 and, as opposed to the Fed's balance sheet, is still growing. The\nquestion that has been at the center of the debate among policymakers, investors, and\nacademics is whether these measures are effective in stimulating economic activity and\nthrough which channels the transmission mechanism works. For instance, in the words\nof Ben Bernanke, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, in January 2014: \"The problem with\nQuantitative Easing (QE) is it works in practice, but it doesn't work in theory.\"\nI contribute to this debate by documenting how QE can affect economic activity via\nthe banking sector. I focus on a yield-induced portfolio rebalancing channel. According\nto this channel, banks might react to a yield compression of longer term securities by\n(a) reducing their bond holdings and (b) investing in alternative assets with a higher\nexpected return like loans to the real sector.1 To empirically test for the presence of this\nchannel, I consider Germany, which is the largest Eurozone economy. The Eurozone has\na bank-dominated financial system and banks are key for the transmission of monetary\npolicy. ECB Chief Economist Peter Praet (2016) argues that: \"This crucial role of the\nbanking system explains why many of our monetary policy interventions during the crisis\nwere aimed at repairing the bank lending channel.\"\nEconomic theory yields different predictions of how QE can work. In their seminal\nwork Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) develop the famous irrelevance result of QE. Ac-\ncordingly, in a standard New Keynesian model open market operations are ineffective at\nthe zero lower bound. Thus, unconventional monetary policy like asset purchases or the\nchange in the composition of the central bank balance sheet are not expected to have\ndirect real effects. Only a commitment about the future path of interest rates is a power-\nful way to stimulate the economy. Bhattarai, Eggertsson, and Gafarov (2015) show that\nLSAP can act as a commitment device by generating a credible signal about the future\npath of interest rates.\n1A similar transmission channel is also analyzed by Albertazzi, Becker, and Boucinha (2018), who\nprimarily focus on a rebalancing motive by economic sectors into riskier newly issued securities (see also\nSection 2 for a more detailed discussion).\nIn finance theory signaling is one channel through which QE can influence asset prices.\nLSAP can cause a change of the expectations of the future path of short term interest rates,\nthus, affecting the risk neutral component of bond yields (see e.g. Bauer and Rudebusch,\n2014). Alternatively, under the assumption of imperfect substitutability between central\nbank money and financial assets, investors faced by lower yields on securities purchased by\nthe central bank may turn to higher-yielding alternatives as corporate bonds or stocks.\nThis idea of a portfolio balance channel has been developed by early studies as Tobin\nprovided a formalization of the imperfect substitutability assumption: LSAP can affect\nthe term premium of long-term securities if investors have maturity-specific bond demands\n(see also Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen, 2011). There exists a vast empirical\nliterature that analyzes the impact of QE on prices and finds that, by and large, asset\npurchases positively affect asset prices and decrease bond yields.2\nIn my study, I take the result that QE affects bond yields negatively as given and\nask whether there are second-round effects that result in a portfolio reallocation of banks.\nBanks might be faced with different incentives to rebalance their portfolio composition.\nFirst, these incentives might stem from the additional liquidity emerging at banks. In\nthe spirit of Bagehot (1873) in crisis times the central bank can act as a lender of last\nresort and provide liquidity directly to banks to prevent a credit contraction (see e.g.\nCarpinelli and Crosignani, 2017). Alternatively, liquidity might be generated by the sale\nof securities to the central bank either by the banks directly (see e.g. Rodnyansky and\nDarmouni, 2017) or by the deponents of the bank (see e.g. Christensen and Krogstrup,\n2017). Second, the impact that the numerous unconventional monetary policy measures\nexert on yields (or prices) of securities held by banks might cause a rebalancing due to a\n\"stealth recapitalization\" (Brunnermeier and Sannikov, 2014). The increase in the value\nof these securities can raise banks net worth and result in increased credit supply.\nThere is a growing body of empirical literature that examines the liquidity-driven re-\nbalancing motive by banks (see e.g. Kandrac and Schlusche, 2016; Butt, Churm, McMa-\nhon, Morotz, and Schanz, 2014; Carpinelli and Crosignani, 2017; Andrade, Cahn, Fraisse,\nand M\u00b4\nesonnier, 2015). However, little work has been done on a rebalancing that is price-\nor yield-induced.3 My goal is to contribute to this strand of literature.\n2See e.g. Altavilla, Carboni, and Motto (2015) for the ECB's Asset Purchase Program, Krishnamurthy,\nNagel, and Vissing-Jorgensen (2018) on the ECB's Outright Monetary Transactions and the Security\nMarkets Program, Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2013) for the Fed's Quantitative Easing, and\nJoyce and Tong (2012) for the Bank of England's asset purchase program.\n3Exceptions are Albertazzi et al. (2018), Rodnyansky and Darmouni (2017), Chakraborty, Goldstein,\nMy study is motivated by the following descriptive findings (see Figure 1). Throughout\n2014 and 2015 there was a huge yield decline of all types of fixed-income securities in\nthe Eurozone that coincided with the expectation, announcement, and implementation\nof various unconventional monetary policy measures (Panel a). This yield decline led\nto a compression of bond yields that was stronger than the decrease of interest rates\non newly issued loans. Consequently, the spread between the average interest rate that\nGerman banks charged on loans to the non-financial sector and the average yield of banks'\nsecurities portfolio increased (Panel b). At the same time, the volume of credit supplied\nby German banks increased in relation to the nominal value of securities held (Panel c).\nThese stylized facts give rise to the question whether the increased credit quantity was\ndriven by the change in the relative price between book credit and bonds. In other words,\ndid the expectation and announcement of unconventional monetary policy measures that\nincreased the relative return of book credit in terms of bond yields led to a rebalancing\nfrom security holdings into credit?\nMotivated by these stylized facts, I develop the following hypotheses to test for the\npresence of a yield-induced portfolio rebalancing channel: (Hypothesis i) Banks facing\na larger compression of yields in their securities portfolio increase their book credit more\nstrongly because they target a specific yield level. (Hypothesis ii) Banks with a higher\naverage yield decline of their securities portfolio reduce their overall securities holdings\nmore intensely, especially selling those securities with the highest drop in yield and re-\nalizing valuation gains. Thus, I analyze whether, against the background of a change in\nrelative price between book credit and bonds, there is a rebalancing between the securities\nportfolio and the credit portfolio of banks that are more affected by the monetary policy\ninduced yield decline.\nIn order to empirically test for these hypotheses, the German security register proves\nparticularly useful. First, the granular information about the security-level holdings by\nGerman banks allows exploiting the impact that the expectation and announcement of\nvarious unconventional monetary policy measures, most importantly the Expanded Asset\nPurchase Program (APP) of the European Central Bank (ECB), had on the yield of each\nsecurity. More specifically, following Albertazzi et al. (2018), I use the cross-sectional\nheterogeneity in the composition of each banks' securities portfolio by calculating a bank\nspecific \"yield-drop\" variable. For each security that a bank holds in January 2014, one\nyear before the APP was announced by the ECB in January 2015 and well before investors\nstarted to expect and price in this measure, I calculate by how much the specific yield\nchanged between January 2014 and June 2015. In other words, to rule out endogeneity\nstemming from reverse causality I hold the composition of securities fix at its level in\nJanuary 2014 and take the impact of monetary policy on prices as given. Aggregating\nthis information on the bank level, this yield-drop variable is characterized by substantial\ncross-sectional variation.\nSecond, the securities register includes information about the maturity date of the\nsecurities held by banks. This provides another source of heterogeneity that I exploit for\nidentification of Hypothesis (i): From the point of view of January 2014 the amount of\nallows me to test whether the rebalancing arising from a high yield decline is stronger\nfor banks with many reinvestment decisions. In face of their compressed yields and the\nfreed up liquidity resulting from the maturing securities, those banks might increase their\ncredit granting more strongly to restore their targeted yield of their portfolio.\nThird, when analyzing banks' securities holdings (i.e. Hypothesis (ii)) I exploit the\nexhaustive detail of the security register for identification. I analyze the data at the\nsecurity-bank-month level. The inclusion of security*time fixed effects into my baseline\nregressions allows me to compare the level of holdings in the same security and the same\nmonth across banks more and less affected by unconventional monetary policy. Thus, I\ncan account for any observable or unobservable time-varying heterogeneity across securi-\nties, like liquidity, credit risk, and the level of issuance (credit demand by the securities'\nissuers).\nArmed with the two sources of heterogeneity, i.e. yield drop and maturing assets, I\nuse a difference-in-differences estimation technique and find significant and sizable effects\non credit supply for banks with a higher drop in yields as compared to their counterparts.\nOn average, banks with a decline in yield of one standard deviation increase the quantity\ntwo year period surrounding the monetary policy induced yield decline and reduce their\noverall holdings of securities by 5.1%. I find that the effect of credit supply is particularly\npronounced for banks with many maturing assets, i.e. banks facing many reinvestment\ndecisions. Moreover, I find that banks with a higher yield decline reduce their holdings\nof securities characterized by the largest valuation gains (i.e. with the largest drop in\nyield) more strongly, thus, realizing the gains from these security holdings. The results\nsuggest that banks target a specific yield level and, facing an average yield decline of their\nsecurities portfolio, actively rebalance towards higher-yielding book credit.\n4Among others, the maturity structure has been exploited for identification by Almeida, Campello,\nexploits banks' maturity structure to identify the effect of QE on lending using a similar dataset.\nInstead of increasing their book loans, banks more affected by monetary policy could\nseek to increase their investments in higher-yielding securities. Following Albertazzi et al.\n(2018), I investigate this alternative potential rebalancing opportunity but do not find\nevidence in favor of it. I follow a similar argumentation as Albertazzi et al. (2018) and\nargue that yields were already so compressed in Germany that, against the background\nof a home-bias, a rebalancing into securities with a relatively high yield would make\nit necessary to heavily change the portfolio composition. This highlights the economic\nplausibility of my findings: given the relative price change between securities and book\ncredit banks favor a rebalancing towards lending.\nI do not find robust evidence that the above effects are more pronounced for weakly\ncapitalized banks. One potential explanation might be that, outside crisis times, equity\ndoes not constitute a constraint for comparatively well-capitalized German banks. This\nconfirms the findings of Timmer (2018), who shows that, outside crisis times, the securities\ntrading behavior of banks does not depend on their equity ratio.\nThere are three potential concerns for identification that I address in the following\nway: First, the treatment intensity given by the monetary policy induced yield decline\ncould potentially be correlated with other events that simultaneously affect a bank's loan\nissuance through other channels. Between September 2014 and March 2017 the Targeted\nLonger Term Refinancing Operations (TLTROs) were implemented in the Eurozone with\nthe aim of fostering credit supply. They offer central bank refinancing at favorable condi-\ntions, which are tied to a bank's net credit supply. Using detailed proprietary data on the\nbank-specific TLTRO uptakes, I show that there is no differential drawing on this specific\ncredit facility between banks more and less affected by the treatment. Thus, the bank-\nspecific yield decline is not simply proxying for the TLTRO uptakes and is not capturing\na liquidity-driven rather than a yield-induced rebalancing motive.5\nSecond, an important prerequisite for my estimates to be attributable to the monetary\npolicy induced yield decline is that the treatment intensity (i.e. by how much the average\nyield of a bank's securities portfolio declined) is unrelated to other bank characteristics\nthat might influence the lending behavior. To address this issue, I carefully adjust the data\nby means of a matching approach in addition to controlling for a number of covariates.\nI effectively select a control group that has similar characteristics as the treated banks.\nThis weighting approach takes care of the parallel trend assumption.\n5Note that I am allowing the TLTROs to affect a banks credit supply through their overall effect on\nyields but I want to rule out that my treatment intensity is picking up the TLTROs' effect on banks'\ncredit granting through liquidity channels.\nThe third concern is that of distinguishing between supply and demand effects, which\nare mostly unobserved. The portfolio rebalancing channel analyzed in this paper is a\nnotion involving a supply-driven credit increase. As my credit data is on a bank level,\nI follow the bank lending channel literature (see e.g. Kashyap and Stein, 1995; Kishan\nand Opiela, 2000; Worms, 2001) when analyzing Hypothesis (i). Accordingly, I focus\non groups of banks for which economically the supply driven effect should be stronger.\nI robustly find that the yield-induced rebalancing motive towards more credit granting\nis particularly pronounced for banks facing many reinvestment decisions. This result\nreinforces the notion of a supply-driven credit expansion.\nVarious robustness checks support the presence of my findings. Most importantly,\na falsification test finds no significant differences in lending behavior between 2011 and\n2013 among banks with diverse valuation gains, i.e. in a period prior to the onset of the\ntreatment. Thus, the observed change in lending outcomes is most likely attributable\nto the monetary policy induced yield drop, as opposed to an alternative bank-specific\nunobservable force.\nThe rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes how this paper fits into\nthe existing literature. Section 3 presents the data used for the analysis and the empirical\ndesign. Section 4 reports the empirical results and Section 5 concludes.\n2 Related Literature\nMy paper contributes to the growing literature that assesses the effectiveness of unconven-\ntional monetary policy at the bank level. Many papers in this group study liquidity-driven\nchannels. Papers like Carpinelli and Crosignani (2017), Garcia-Posada and Marchetti\nwake of the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis to prevent a funding squeeze of the banking\nsector. Butt et al. (2014) focus on banks' deposits as the key pass-through variable of\nassets sales by the banks' deponents (e.g. institutional investors etc.). They show that the\nBank of England's asset purchases had no impact on bank lending through this channel.\nKandrac and Schlusche (2016) test for the existence of a reserve-induced portfolio rebal-\nancing channel, where the sale of securities increases banks reserves, thus, disturbing the\nbanks' optimal balance sheet composition. The authors exploit a regulatory change in the\nUS that influenced the reserve distribution and find that banks increase their lending and\nrisk-taking activity to reinstall the optimal asset and liability structure. Koetter, Podlich,\nand Wedow (2017) analyze the effect that the Eurosystem's Securities Markets Program\n(SMP) had on competition in the banking market. The authors exploit the heterogeneity\nin bank-level holdings of securities that were purchased under the SMP and find positive\neffects on loan and deposit market shares. Another paper studying the effect of QE on\nlending is Chakraborty et al. (2016). They analyze MBS and tresury purchases by the Fed\nand find a crowding out of commercial lending in favor of mortgage origination following\nMBS sales. In addition, they find that firms' borrowing from MBS selling banks reduce\ntheir investments.\nAnother paper close to this one is Rodnyansky and Darmouni (2017). The authors\nstudy the effect that the three rounds of QE in the US had on lending. They mainly\nfocus on mortgage lending and exploit the heterogeneity in the MBS holdings of banks.\nIn contrast to their approach, I do not consider banks' holdings of a particular asset class\nto define the treatment status but rather exploit the heterogeneity in the impact that\nunconventional monetary policy had on yields of all fixed-income securities that banks\nhold in their own accounts. Furthermore, they do not study banks security holdings\nbehavior.6\nOverall, my contribution consists of taking the result that asset purchases affect bond\nyields negatively as given and asking whether banks that face stronger yield reductions\nhave larger incentives to (a) reduce their securities holdings and (b) increase bank lending.\nThe two closest papers to my analysis are Albertazzi et al. (2018) and Tischer (2017).\nAlbertazzi et al. (2018) also study the yield-induced rebalancing motive using the hetero-\ngeneity in the APP induced yield decline. However, they mainly focus on different sectors\n(e.g. households, firms, pension funds, money market funds, banks etc.) and analyze\nwhether those sectors have a rebalancing motive into newly issued riskier securities. They\nalso give suggestive evidence in favor of a yield-induced rebalancing motive of banks from\ncountries less affected by the sovereign debt crisis by studying the credit granting behav-\nior of the largest 25 European institutions. As acknowledged by the authors \"(...) the\nsmall number of banks represents a constraint for the econometric analysis (...).\" Further,\nthey do not analyze the security holding behavior of these banks as outcome variable.\nIn contrast, my study explicitly focuses on banks and tests for the hypotheses developed\nabove, which are motivated by the stylized fact that the relative price between credit and\nsecurities has changed in Germany. As opposed to Albertazzi et al. (2018) I find that\n6Further papers studying the effects of unconventional monetary policy include: Grosse-Rueschkamp,\nSteffen, and Streitz (2017), Arce, Gimeno, and Mayordomo (2017), and Abidi, Miquel Flores, and Eterovic\n(2017) all analyze the effects of the ECB's Corporate Bond Purchase Program. Acharya, Eisert, Eufin-\nger, and Hirsch (2017), and Ferrando, Popov, and Udell (2016) study the announcement effects of the\nECB's Outright Monetary Transaction Program. Eser and Schwaab (2016) study the transmission of\nthe Securities Markets Program (SMP) on bond yields. Heider, Saidi, and Schepens (2017) analyze the\ntransmission of negative policy rates via banks.\nbanks with greater yield declines reduce their security holdings (besides increasing their\ncredit granting). Additionally, I intend to shed more light on the underlying bank-specific\nmechanisms as well as heterogeneities of the yield-induced portfolio rebalancing chan-\nnel. Furthermore, by making use of data from monetary policy operations, in particular\nbank-specific TLTRO-uptakes, I can control for alternative, liquidity-driven transmission\nchannels.\nTischer (2017) also analyzes the effect of QE on bank lending supply in Germany. To\nthis end, he exploits the maturity structure of banks' bond holdings and finds that more\nexposed banks increase their loan growth during QE relative to other banks. This result\nsupports my main finding that banks with stronger yield compressions increase assets\nwith a higher expected return, i.e. book credit, and reduce their security holdings at the\nsame time. In addition, it is consistent with the finding in this paper that the rebalancing\nmotive is stronger for banks with many maturing assets that simultaneously have a strong\ndecline of yields in their securities portfolio. In contrast to Tischer (2017), who primarily\nfocuses on maturing securities for identification, my main source of heterogeneity stems\nfrom the intensity of the average yield decline of a bank's securities portfolio. Furthermore,\nI analyze the security holdings decision of banks on a security-level as outcome variable,\nwhich allows for a rich identification. Understanding the security holdings behavior of\nbanks affected by unconventional monetary policy is a key contribution of this paper.\nAdditionally, using bank-specific TLTRO uptakes allows me to directly control for this\npotentially contaminating unconventional monetary policy instrument without the need\nof using proxy variables for this purpose.\nAnother related paper to my study is Peydr\u00b4\nanalyze banks investment behavior due to monetary policy using credit and securities\nregister data from Italy. They find that in crisis times less capitalized banks prefer buying\nsecurities rather than increasing credit supply in reaction to a softer monetary policy.\nOne key difference to my paper is the monetary policy indicator that they examine.\nThey mainly focus on the central bank balance sheet, which incorporates the actually\nimplemented monetary policy measures. In contrast, I use the impact that the anticipation\nand announcement of unconventional monetary policy had on yields. Additionally, Peydr\u00b4\no\net al. (2017) study crisis and non-crisis times, whereas I focus on a time period that spans\nthe implementation of the APP and the TLTROs.\nAnother group of papers studies the effects of asset purchases on macroeconomic\nvariables using VAR models. Their main focus are the effects of QE on output and\nprices. Weale and Wieladek (2016) rely on Bayesian inference and use a combination of\nzero and sign restrictions to identify an asset purchase announcement shock. They find\na positive effect on output and prices for the US and UK. A similar approach is taken\nby Gambacorta, Hofmann, and Peersman (2014), who estimate a Panel VAR for eight\nadvanced economies and focus on the aggregated central bank balance sheet as the main\npolicy variable. Lewis and Roth (2017) also estimate a Bayesian VAR and identify an\nasset purchase shock by using different aggregated items from the ECB's balance sheet.\nThe authors find a positive effect of asset purchases on output for both the Eurozone\nand Germany. They also analyze the response of bank lending to firms following the\nasset purchase shock and find no reaction of this variable in the German economy. All\nthose papers have the advantage that the exploitation of the time series variation enables\nthem to study the transitional dynamics of asset purchases. However, it is hard to draw\nconclusions about the heterogeneous reaction of various agents to the asset purchase shock.\nFurthermore, most of these papers use aggregate central bank balance sheet items that\ninclude the actually purchased amounts of securities or they construct an asset purchase\nannouncement series. Therefore, they do not fully incorporate the effects stemming from\nthe anticipation of asset purchase programs by investors. Especially in the case of the\nEurozone there is evidence that the APP has been anticipated by market participants,\nthus, affecting prices positively well in advance of the actual implementation. I explicitly\nincorporate this anticipated reaction in bond prices in my analysis.\nMy paper also relates to the literature analyzing the bank lending (Bernanke and\nBlinder, 1988; Bernanke and Blinder, 1992) and risk taking channels (Borio and Zhu,\n2008; Adrian and Shin, 2011) of monetary policy during conventional times. In their\nseminal paper, Kashyap and Stein (1995) exploit bank-level data and identify the bank\nlending channel by showing that small banks, i.e. banks facing larger frictions and having\ndifficulties in saturating their funding needs, contract their lending activity stronger after a\nmonetary policy tightening. In a similar vein, Kishan and Opiela (2000) and Gambacorta\nand Mistrulli (2004) focus on weakly capitalized banks instead of the banks' size. More\nrecent contributions analyze the bank lending and risk taking channel using loan level data\n(Jim\u00b4\nenez, Ongena, Peydr\u00b4\nenez, Ongena, Peydr\u00b4\no, and Saurina,\nThis paper also contributes to the literature studying security holdings of banks and\ninstitutional investors at the security-level. Abbassi, Iyer, Peydr\u00b4\nuse the German securities register in conjunction with lending data. However, they do\nnot study monetary policy, but are interested in securities trading by banks with trading\nexpertise in the crisis. Timmer (2018) studies security trading of institutional investors.\nContrary to my results, Timmer (2018) finds that banks respond pro-cyclically to price\nchanges, i.e. they sell securities when prices are falling. In contrast to Timmer (2018),\nI focus on banks with large credit and securities portfolios and focus on a time period\ncharacterized by a huge decline of the general yield level induced by monetary policy.7\n3 Data and Empirical Setting\nI focus on Germany to analyze the yield-induced portfolio rebalancing channel. Ger-\nmany's financial system is bank-dominated and the largest in the EMU making it an\nideal candidate to study the effects of unconventional monetary policy on bank lending\nand security holdings. Further, the availability and combination of the securities register\nwith balance-sheet information and data from monetary policy implementation provides\na comprehensive view on banks' balance sheets. In this section, I first describe the data\nused in this paper. Then, I turn to the stylized facts about the credit and securities\nmarket in Germany during the time period of investigation, i.e. from January 2013 un-\ntil December 2015, which provide descriptive evidence for the potential presence of a\nyield-induced rebalancing channel. Finally, I describe the identification strategy and the\nempirical setup.\nTo construct the dataset used for the empirical analysis I use the German securities\nregister, the balance sheet statistics, the interest rate statistics, and the income state-\nment statistics of German banks compiled by the Deutsche Bundesbank. This dataset is\naugmented with data on the refinancing operations of German monetary policy counter-\nparties. The baseline time period under consideration is January 2013 until December\nThe securities register includes the nominal amounts of the security holdings of each\nGerman bank on a security level for the end of each month. I merge this dataset with\nthe centralized securities data base to obtain additional security specific information as\nthe yield, price, maturity date, security type, and issuer sector. I complement this data\nwith monthly bank-level balance sheet information like total assets, equity capital, central\nbank reserves, saving deposits, and yearly income statement items such as net profits and\nnet interest received. The data on monetary policy refinancing operations includes the\nbank-specific TLTRO-uptakes.\nMy bank-level loan data comes from the interest rate statistics, composed of a sample\nof above 200 deposit taking and loan granting credit institutions. The sample is selected\nwith a stratified sampling procedure according to the categories of banks, regional criteria,\nand size. In terms of coverage around 70% of the total German loan business is captured\nby this dataset.8 Thus, the sample includes German banks with a strong focus on credit\ngranting. The unique feature of the MFI interest rate statistics is that, along with the\ninterest rates on loans, it includes the monthly volumes of new business at the end of each\nmonth for loans to households and non-financial corporations.\nAs I focus on newly issued loans, my final sample after merging the loan data with\nthe above datasets consists of 204 banks. This sample is interesting due to the following\nreasons: First, those are the banks most active in credit granting and, therefore, they\nare particularly important for the transmission of those unconventional monetary policy\nmeasures, which target an expansion of credit. Second, as described in the following\nsection, a difference-in-differences regression setup is used and the treatment intensity in\nthe average yield drop of a bank is exploited for identification. This requires to make sure\nthat the banks from the control group are similar in terms of observable and unobservable\ncharacteristics to the treated banks. As described in the following section, I deal with\nthe observable characteristics by means of a matching procedure. However, it is more\nchallenging to handle unobservable characteristics. Choosing banks with a similar business\nmodel, i.e. a strong focus on credit granting, can help in this respect.\nOne prerequisite for the presence of the yield-induced portfolio rebalancing channel is\nthat of a yield decline that can be attributed to unconventional monetary policy. Panel a\nof Figure 1 shows the evolution of 10-year government bond yields for selected Eurozone\ncountries. Between January 2014 and June 2015 yields of government securities declined\nsubstantially. The yield decline is not specific to government securities but can also\nbe observed among other fixed-income securities, like corporate or covered bonds. Along\nwith the government bond yields the graph shows various unconventional monetary policy\nmeasures that are indicated by vertical lines. In June 2014 the deposit facility rate was\nfirst tender of the first TLTRO-series was implemented, in January 2015 the APP was\nannounced, and in March 2015 the APP was implemented. It is challenging to quantify\nhow much of the yield decline between January 2014 and June 2015 was due to the specific\n8Details on data used are available at: http://www.bundesbank.de/Redaktion/DE/Standardartikel/\nStatistiken/einlagen und kreditzinssaetze.html.\nunconventional measures, especially because throughout 2014 there was a huge discussion\namong investors whether the ECB will announce an asset purchase program. Appendix\nA.1 contains a compilation of newsletter articles that highlight the investors' speculation\nthroughout the year 2014. As I want to capture this anticipation effects, in this paper,\nI take the impact of monetary policy on asset prices as given by calculating the drop in\nA further indication for the presence of a yield-induced rebalancing motive towards\nmore credit supply is that credit granting becomes more attractive relative to security\ninvestments. Panel b of Figure 1 illustrates the spread between the average interest rate\nthat German banks charge on loans to the non-financial sector and the average yield of\nbanks' securities portfolios. This figure is increasing over time, primarily driven by a\nstronger decline of the securities' yields as compared to the fall in interest rates on loans.\nThis spread gives rise to the presence of a potential rebalancing motive towards more\nlending. In other words, panel b shows the change in the relative return of bank loans\nin terms of bond yields, which is a prerequisite for the existence of a rebalancing motive,\nwhereby the compression of yields on securities held by banks induces them to invest in\nassets with a higher expected return, i.e. loans.9\nThe next piece of evidence is provided by panel c of Figure 1, which depicts the\nevolution of the ratio of the average credit volume extended to the non-financial private\nsector in the numerator and the average nominal value of securities held by all German\nbanks in the denominator. Similarly, also this ratio is increasing over time.\nFigure 1 provides first descriptive evidence in favor of a yield-induced portfolio rebal-\nancing channel. This needs to be formally tested at the bank level to gauge the causal\neffect of unconventional monetary policy on bank lending and securities holding behavior.\n3.3 Empirical Strategy\nThe identification strategy exploits differences in banks' exposure of their securities port-\nfolio to unconventional monetary policy measures. To this end, I construct a bank-level\nvariable indicating by how much the average yield of the securities portfolio dropped be-\nthey account for more than 95% of all securities holdings of German banks. Further-\nmore, debt securities are most comparable in their structure to bank loan contracts, thus,\n9One potential criticism of using this spread might be that the series increases because banks take\non more risk in the credit portfolio. Tischer (2017) calculates a risk-adjusted spread based on loans\nunderlying Asset Backed Securities in Germany for a similar time period and shows that the evolution\nof the risk-adjusted spread is similar to the unadjusted spread.\na rebalancing motive into more loan supply should be most pronounced for this asset\nclass. For each security I calculate by how much its yield dropped between 2014:M1 and\n2015:M6. I exclude all securities that mature in this time window to rule out that my\nfinal variable picks up any mechanical change in yield stemming from a possible pull-to-\npar effect10. Finally, I weight each security by its nominal amount. I label the resulting\nvariable \"MP\", which denotes monetary policy.\nHolding the composition of securities fixed at its level in January 2014, well before\ninvestors started to anticipate the asset purchase program,11 I can rule out any endo-\ngeneity stemming from reverse causality. Additionally, by calculating the drop in yield\nin 2015:M6 helps me to prevent endogeneity arising from the decision of banks to sell a\nsecurity due to unconventional monetary policy. The choice of June 2015 as the end date\nof the window for the yield decline calculation is driven by the following trade off decision.\nFirst, enlarging the window, e.g. choosing 2015:M12 as the end date, would result in a\nsmaller fraction of securities that are actually still held at the end date. Second, picking\na smaller window, e.g. 2014:M12 as the end date, would result in capturing a smaller\namount of unconventional monetary policy measures.12 Nevertheless, in Section 4.3 I\nshow that results are robust to choosing 2014:M12 as the end date of the window for the\nyield decline calculation.\nAlthough yields might have declined due to other reasons than unconventional mon-\netary policy, I follow Albertazzi et al. (2018) and argue that both anecdotal evidence\n(see Appendix A.1) and the empirical literature (e.g. Altavilla et al., 2015) demonstrate\nthat the announcement and anticipation of the APP by financial market participants was\nthe most important driver of asset prices in the Eurozone in the period examined in this\nSummary Statistics Table 1 shows the summary statistics of all variables used in the\nempirical analysis. Most importantly, the MP variable is characterized by substantial\ncross-sectional variation. While the securities portfolio of the lower quartile bank faced\na decline of 0.47 percentage points, the average yield drop of the upper quartile bank\n10Pull-to-par describes that the bonds price will gradually converge to par when maturity approaches.\n11To my knowledge, the first newsletter article that mentions speculations about an asset purchase\nprogram was published in March 2014 (see Appendix A.1).\nthe actual implementation of the APP on yields.\n13The anticipation effect on yields of securities makes it challenging to quantify how much of the overall\nyield decline was due to monetary policy. Considering only securities that were eligible under the APP\nwould introduce an endogeneity concern as the eligible assets were determined on the announcement date\nwas 0.79 percentage points. The ratio of maturing securities to total assets does also\ndisplay considerable cross-sectional variation: the lower quartile bank has securities that\nwhile this figure amounts to 4.7% for the upper quartile bank. Interestingly, the median\nbank holds approximately 17% of their total assets in fixed income securities and for the\nlower quartile bank this figure is at approximately 10%. This illustrates that the banks\nin my sample are characterized by a fairly large fraction of fixed-income securities on the\nasset side of their balance sheet.\nTable 2 displays additional descriptive statistics. Given the total securities holdings\n22.5% are maturing and 15.5% are sold in between. It is crucial to emphasize that\nbanks would not have a rebalancing motive if they held all assets until maturity as their\neventual yield would be determined at the moment of the security's purchase in this\ncase. However, as Table 2 shows, banks are selling a substantial fraction of their overall\nsecurities. Additionally, they face reinvestment decisions whenever a security matures.\nThus, it is an empirical question whether they continually target a specific yield level and\nwhether the change in relative price between book credit and securities drives their credit\ngranting and their security holdings decision.\nCredit Analysis To assess the yield-induced impact of unconventional monetary policy\non bank lending, i.e. Hypothesis (i), I employ a difference-in-differences (DID) approach\nand run the following bank-level regression (Baseline Model 1):\nLog(loans)i\n MPi\n+ Xi\n+ Banktype FE + ui\nwhere i denotes a bank. The dependent variable Log(loans)i\nis the change in the\nlogarithm of newly issued loans around the yield decline. To avoid problems of serial\ncorrelation, I follow Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullainathan (2004) and collapse the monthly\nThus, I have one observation for each bank. The alternative to collapsing the data is\ntwoway-clustering of the standard errors (see below). The key variable of interest is MPi\n.\nControl variables are denoted by Xi\n. Following the bank lending literature (Kashyap\nincludes the logarithm of total assets, the equity to assets ratio,\nand the return on assets. I include the central bank reserves to assets ratio to control\nfor any potential sales of securities by the bank to the central bank in the context of\nthe APP and to control for a possible reserve-induced transmission channel (Kandrac\nand Schlusche, 2016). The deposit to assets ratio controls for another liquidity-driven\ntransmission channel operating through deposits (Butt et al., 2014). I further include an\ninterbank lending to assets ratio to control for the funding situation of the bank and the\nnet interest margin to control for the profitability and the importance of credit business.\nAdditionally, banktype fixed effects (i.e. savings banks, cooperative banks, Landesbanks,\nbig commercial banks, regional banks) are included in the regressions. In this collapsed\nregression Model 1 all control variables are measured before the yield decline in December\nis an error term. The coefficient 1\nmeasures the treatment effect of the\nmonetary policy induced yield decline.\nAs an alternative specification to Model 1, I estimate the following panel equation\n(Model 2):\nLog(loans)i,t\n= i\n+ t\n(MPi\n) + Xi,t\n+ ui,t\nwhere i\nare bank fixed effects and control for bank-specific time invariant unobserved\ncharacteristics. t\ndenote time fixed effects and control for different economy wide de-\nvelopments that change over time.14 Note that a country-wide change of loan demand\nis absorbed by the time fixed effects. The dependent variable Log(loans)i,t\nis the log-\narithm of newly issued loans and POSTt\nis a dummy variable that takes the value of\nuntil 2015:M12. Time-varying control variables are denoted by Xi,t\nand include the same\nvariables as above. I follow Bertrand et al. (2004) and avoid problems of serial corre-\nlation of the error term by twoway clustering the standard errors at the bank and time\nlevel (Petersen, 2009) instead of collapsing the data as in Model 1. The key variable of\ninterest is the interaction term MPi\n, as I am interested in the differential effect\nof banks with a high decline in yields versus banks with a low yield decline comparing\nmeasures the treatment\neffect of the monetary policy induced yield decline.\nSecurities Analysis To analyze whether banks reduce their security holdings and re-\nalize the valuation gains stemming from unconventional monetary policy, i.e. Hypothesis\n14Among others, the time fixed effects control for conventional monetary policy, i.e. the main refinancing\n(MRO) rate of the Eurosystem, as well as economy wide shock.\n(ii), I estimate the following econometric model at the security-bank-month level:\nLog(security holdings)j,i,t\n(MPi\n High-yield-declinej\n)\n(MPi\n)\n High-yield-declinej\n)\n(MPi\n High-yield-declinej\n)\n+ Xi,t\n+ j,t\n+ i,t\n+ uj,i,t\nwhere the dependent variable is the logarithm of nominal holdings of security j by bank\ni at month t. Xi,t\nincludes the bank-specifiy, time-varying control variables from above.\nis a dummy variable that takes the value of 1 after 2015:M1. High-yield-declinej\nis a dummy variable that takes the value of one if a security has a high drop in yield\nFor identification, in the strongest specification, I include security*time fixed effects\nto control for any security-specific time varying observable or unobservable characteristics\n(e.g. liquidity, risk, issuance amount) and bank*time fixed effects to control for any bank-\nspecific time varying observable or unobservable characteristics. In some regressions I am\ninterested in the interaction between MPi\nand POSTt\n. I include security, bank, and\ntime fixed effects, or security*time fixed effects along with bank fixed effects and time-\nvarying, bank-specific control variables into the regression in this case as otherwise the\ninteraction term would be absorbed by the bank*time fixed effects. I cluster standard\nerrors at the bank, security, and time level.15 The estimated coefficient 2\nthen measures\nthe overall securities holdings of banks more versus banks less affected before versus\nafter the monetary policy induced yield decline. The estimated coefficient 1\nmeasures\nthe differential securities holdings of securities with a high decline in yield by banks\nmore versus banks less affected by monetary policy before and after the unconventional\nmonetary policy driven yield decline.\nParallel trend assumption The key identifying assumption is that the treatment\nintensity is unrelated to other bank characteristics that might influence a bank's lending\nbehavior. In other words, the trends related to loan granting need to be the same among\nmore and less treated banks before the treatment happens. Figure 2 provides a first test\nof this assumption. The sample is divided into high- and low-yield-drop banks according\nto the median of the MP variable. Before January 2014 the evolution of new loans looks\n15Results also hold when clustering at the security and bank level.\ncomparable. In line with the hypothesis of the paper, starting in the middle of 2014 banks\nmore affected by the monetary policy induced yield decline increase their new loans much\nstronger than less affected banks. This development continues throughout 2015.\nIn a next step, I assess whether the MP variable can be predicted by various (pre-\nshock) bank-level characteristics. Column 1 of Table 3 shows the results of a probit\nregression of the MP dummy on these characteristics. No variable has explanatory power\nfor the treatment status and also the p-value of the 2 test of overall model fit shows that\none cannot reject the null hypothesis that all coefficient estimates are zero. Nevertheless,\nas the p-value is close to the 10% significance level and given the pre-shock evolution of\nnewly issued credit shown in Figure 2, in a careful attempt to ensure that my results\nare not biased by the potentially endogenous determination of securities holdings (with\na high yield-drop), I perform a nearest-neighbor propensity score weighting approach. In\na first step, I divide my sample according to the median of the MP variable and regress\nthe resulting treatment status on the pre-shock bank-level characteristics. The propensity\nscores (predicted values) of this probit regression are used in a nearest neighbor propensity\nscore matching approach with replacement. For each bank out of the group with a high\nyield drop a control unit is selected out of the \"low-yield-drop\" group that gives the best\nmatch according to the propensity score. In a second step, I use the resulting weights\nthat are calculated based on the frequency of a match in my regressions. This way I\ndiscard the observations that are very dissimilar to the \"treated\" banks by giving them\na low weight. Column 2 of Table 3 displays the results of the probit regression with the\nmatched sample. Compared to column 1, the p-value of the 2 test of overall model fit\nincreases to 0.726, which indicates the satisfactory performance of the weighting exercise.\nI report results based on this matched sample in columns 2 and 4 of Table 4.\nTable 4 reports the main estimation results for the credit regressions to test Hypothesis (i).\nColumns 1 and 2 show the results of the collapsed baseline model 1, where the dependent\nvariable is the change of the logarithm of newly issued loans of bank i between the pre event\nfixed effects are included. The coefficient estimate of the MP variable is statistically\nsignificant at the 1% significance level. The positive sign is in line with the presence of\na yield-induced rebalancing motive: Banks experiencing a higher average yield decline of\ntheir securities portfolio induced by expansionary unconventional monetary policy increase\ntheir real sector lending more strongly in response. To illustrate the economic impact\nof the effect lets consider the coefficient of the MP variable in column 1, which shows\nthe results in a sample without propensity score weighting. A bank with a one standard\ndeviation decrease of the average yield (0.41) of its securities portfolio increases the average\ndecrease in yield.\nIn column 2, I report the results with the weighted sample based on the propensity\nscore matching procedure described above. The coefficient in colum 2 is only slightly\nsmaller as compared to the unmatched sample. This indicates that it is unlikely that my\nresults in the unmatched sample in column 1 are biased by the potentially endogenous\ndetermination of security holdings (with a high yield-drop).\nNext, in columns 3 and 4, I present results for model 2, where instead of taking pre\nand post event averages, the regression is performed using monthly observations with\nstandard errors clustered at the bank and time level. As the dependent variable is the\nnatural logarithm of newly issued loans, the coefficient estimate in column 3 suggests that\nbanks with a decrease of the average yield in their securities portfolio by one standard\n2015 as compared to banks without such decrease in yields. Compared to model 1,\nthe lower magnitude of the effect might be driven by the control variables. Whereas\nin model 1 the bank-specific control variables are measured before the monetary policy\ninduced yield decline (2013:M12), model 2 includes the time varying values. As before, the\ncoefficient estimate is only slightly changed when using the weighted sample (see column\n4). Therefore, for the ease of exposition, in all subsequent regressions I report the results\nwith the unweighted sample.\nHeterogeneities: Maturing Assets The main hypothesis analyzed in this paper is\nthat banks that face a stronger yield compression rebalance their portfolio towards al-\nternative assets with a higher expected return. This effect should be particularly strong\nfor banks that hold many maturing securities. Once a security matures and additional\nliquidity is released, the bank has to make a reinvestment decision. Hence, the yield-\ninduced portfolio rebalancing effect towards loans to non-financial companies and house-\nholds should be particularly strong for banks with many maturing assets that simulta-\nneously have a strong decline of yields in their securities portfolio. These banks might\nincrease their credit granting more strongly to restore their targeted yield of their securi-\nties portfolio.\nIn Table 5, I test for this incentive by exploiting the heterogeneity given by the amount\ninclude the maturing-assets-ratio along with an interaction term between MP variable and\nthe maturing-assets-ratio into the regression model 1. I precede equivalently in column 4\nfor model 2. As expected, in both cases the interaction term is positive and statistically\nsignificant. This means that the treatment effect is larger for banks with a higher maturing\nassets to total assets ratio. In both models the coefficient estimates of the MP variable\nremain positive and significant. The marginal effect of the MP variable depending on\nthe maturing-assets-ratio is depicted in Figure 3. Thus, the results seem to confirm\nthe above conjecture that banks that face reinvestment decisions due to many maturing\nsecurities increase their (higher yielding) credit granting when they are more heavily\naffected by the monetary policy induced yield decline. These findings seem to be in line\nwith banks targeting a specific yield level of their total assets. Furthermore, these findings\nare consistent with the results in Tischer (2017).\nHeterogeneities: Equity Now, I turn my attention to analyzing whether the effect of\nunconventional monetary policy is stronger for weakly capitalized banks. In the presence\nof funding constraints the monetary policy induced valuation gains on securities held\nby banks can potentially improve the banks' capital position and, consequently, their\ncredit-bearing capacity. Table 6 tests for this mechanism. The regression setup remains\nunchanged compared to above with the exception that an interaction term between the\nMP variable and the equity-ratio is included into the regression. Intuitively, worse cap-\nitalized banks should profit more by the valuation gains as opposed to well capitalized\nbanks because they face more frictions: they are more likely constrained by their capital\nposition and they have more problems in attracting funds. Hence, if this form of equity\nmechanism is at work one would expect a stronger effect of the MP variable on bank\nlending behavior for banks with a lower equity to assets ratio. The coefficient estimates\nof the interaction term between the MP variable and the equity ratio is not statistically\ndifferent from zero in neither model. Thus, I do not find evidence for the above conjecture.\nHeterogeneities: Sectors So far, I have focused on the total lending to the private\nnon-financial sector. An interesting question is which sectors receive the additionally\nissued loans. Table 7 contains the results of regressions with the dependent variable\nsplit into loans to non-financial corporations (columns 1 and 3) and loans to households\n(columns 2 and 4). The results do not show any difference in loan granting to any of the\n16The maturing-assets-ratio is calculated based on the securities portfolio in 2014:M1.\ntwo sectors. Accordingly, both, the non-financial corporations and the household sector\nface higher loan granting.\nContaminating Events One potential concern regarding the identification strategy\nimplemented in this paper is that one of the unconventional monetary policy measures\nthat potentially affects banks through other non yield-induced channels might be both cor-\nrelated with the MP variable and linked to banks' lending behavior. One such measure are\nthe Targeted Longer Term Refinancing Operations (TLTROs), which were implemented\nbetween December 2014 and March 2017, i.e. during most of the time period analyzed\nin this paper. The main aim of the TLTROs was to provide banks with liquidity under\nfavorable conditions to foster credit supply. These refinancing operations have a maturity\nof up to 4 years. The amount that a bank is allowed to draw in the numerous tender\noperations and the interest rate it has to pay for the central bank money are linked to\nthe banks' newly issued loans.\nIn an initial attempt to eye-ball whether the potential contamination of the TLTROs\nmight bias my results, in panel a of Figure 4 I use data on bank-specific TLTRO uptakes to\nshows the average TLTRO uptake as a fraction of total assets of the two groups of banks\ndivided according to the median of the MP variable. The evolution of the TLTRO-ratio\nis mostly parallel for the two groups, which is a first indication that banks with a higher\nyield drop do not use the TLTROs more extensively than banks with a lower yield drop.\nNext, in Table 8 I run regressions, where I explicitly control for the bank specific TLTRO\nuptakes. 17 All previous results hold. Thus, the results suggest that the monetary policy\ninduced yield decline is not simply proxying for TLTRO uptakes. This indicates that my\nresults do not seem to be driven by alternative liquidity-driven transmission channels but\nare rather capturing yield-induced rebalancing motives.\nApart from the TLTROs, further potentially contaminating events are the actual\npurchases of securities by the central banks of the Eurosystem in the context of the APP.\nWhen a bank sells eligible securities on behalf of their deponents, the bank's total central\nbank reserves on its asset side as well as its saving deposits on its liability side might\nincrease. This increase might disturb the bank's optimal balance sheet composition. In\norder to reinstall the original composition, banks might seek to increase their loan supply.\nThis argument has been made by Friedman and Schwartz (1963) and has recently been\n17I use the empirical specification of model 2 in this case because model 1 includes control variables\nresults with the additional control variable separately would be to directly include it in the main spec-\nification. However, in this case the TLTRO-ratio could only enter model 2. To ensure comparability\nof estimates stemming from the model choice and not from different control variables, I chose to report\nresults separately in Table 8.\nempirically tested by Kandrac and Schlusche (2016). In addition to controlling for the\ndeposit-to-assets ratio and the reserves-to-asset ratio in all regressions, panels b and c of\nFigure 4 show the evolution of those variables for the two groups of banks. Although the\ncentral bank reserves ratio increases sharply starting at the beginning of 2015, banks with\na higher yield drop do not face a larger increase compared to banks with a low drop in\nyield. Similarly, there is no differential pattern for the evolution of the deposit-to-assets\nratio. Thus, the MP variable does not proxy for this reserve-induced portfolio rebalancing\neffect.\n4.2 Securities Analysis\nThis section investigates whether banks more affected by the unconventional monetary\npolicy reduce their overall securities holdings and realize the gains from holding securities\nwith a high drop in yield (Hypothesis ii). Before conducting a detailed analysis Figure 5\nshows the evolution of the securities to total assets ratio of banks more and less affected\nby monetary policy. Banks more affected reduce their nominal overall security holdings\nthroughout 2014 and 2015, whereas banks less affected by the yield decline do not seem to\nadjust their securities portfolio. A similar pattern emerges when examining the fraction\nof securities with a high decline in yield to total assets in Figure 6. The Figure shows that\nbanks more affected by the monetary policy induced yield decline decrease their holdings\nof securities with the highest valuation gains. Banks with a lower average yield decline\ndo not seem to reduce their holdings of these securities.\nA more formal analysis, i.e. the results of estimating Equation (3), is presented in\nTable 9. Column 1 shows that banks more affected by unconventional monetary policy\nreduce their overall nominal securities holdings after the shock. Economically, banks with\na one standard deviation drop in the average yield of their securities portfolio reduce\n2 I add security*time fixed effects and find similar results in terms of significance and\nmagnitude. Banks more affected by monetary policy decrease their security holdings\nby 5.1%. In column 3 I add the triple interaction term between MPi\n, and\nHigh-yield-declinej\nalong with all other double interaction terms between those three\nvariables. I find that after the monetary policy induced yield decline, banks more affected\nby monetary policy (i.e. with a one standard deviation decline) reduce their holdings of\nsecurities with the highest yield decline by 5.6%. The coefficient of MPi\nremains\nlargely unchanged in column 3. In columns 4 and 5 I successively saturate the econometric\nmodel with bank*time and security*time fixed effects. The coefficient estimates of the\ntriple interaction term remain qualitatively similar. All in all, the results suggest that\nbanks more affected by monetary policy reduce both, their overall securities holdings and\nthe holdings of those securities that had the largest drop in yield, realizing the gains from\nthese securities.\nNext, I investigate the type of securities that banks more affected by unconventional\nmonetary policy are reducing. Corporate bonds are most comparable in their character-\nistics to book credit. An interesting question therefore is, whether banks are especially\nreducing their holdings of this particular asset class. To this end, I consider corporate\nbonds, government bonds, and other securities.18 I repeat the same type of security hold-\nings regressions for the different issuer sectors in Table 10, where I include security*time\nfixed effects, bank fixed effects, and time-varying bank-level controls into the regression.\nLooking only at the size of the coefficient estimates, the results might suggest that the\nrebalancing motive might be largest for corporate securities. However, one has to bear\nin mind that corporate bonds account only for a small fraction of overall banks' security\nholdings.19 In terms of nominal amounts, the largest reduction concerns the holdings of\nsecurities issued by financial institutions.\nIn unreported regressions I have investigated whether there is a differential heterogene-\nity in the securities holdings with respect to the equity ratio. I do not find evidence in\nfavor of the hypothesis that banks with a low equity ratio reduce their securities holdings\nmore strongly. One potential explanation might be that, outside crisis times, equity does\nnot constitute a constraint for comparatively well-capitalized German banks.\nFollowing Albertazzi et al. (2018), I have analyzed whether banks more affected by\nmonetary policy rebalance towards securities with a higher yield.20 I do not find evidence\nfor this kind of rebalancing into higher yielding securities. Similar as Albertazzi et al.\n(2018), I argue that one possible explanation might be that yields were already so com-\npressed in Germany that, against the background of a home-bias, investing in securities\nwith a relatively high yield would make it necessary to heavily change the portfolio com-\nposition. This highlights the economic plausibility of my findings: given the relative price\nchange between securities and book credit banks favor a rebalancing towards lending.\n18Those include mainly issues of financial institutions and, to a much smaller extend, of public sector\nentities like agencies etc.\n19The fraction of the total nominal amount of corporate bonds held by the banks in my sample in\n20This can be tested by the inclusion of an interaction term between MPi\n, and the time varying\nyield of the security yieldj,t\ninto the security-level regression equation 3.\nSo far, I found significant effects of the monetary policy induced yield decline on bank\nlending and securities holding behavior. In this section, I test the robustness of these\nresults. Most importantly, to test whether the MP variable picks up any other observable\nor unobservable traits that might be linked to banks' lending behavior, I run placebo\nregressions with a different timing of the dependent variable. I regress the change in\nthe logarithm of newly issued loans between 2011 and 2013, i.e. in a period where the\ndifferential yield decline should have no effect on bank lending, on all control variables\nfrom above. Table 11 shows the results of this falsification exercise. As expected, the\nMP variable is not statistically significant and has the wrong sign in all regressions. This\npoints towards the exogeneity of the MP variable. Hence, the change in lending outcomes\nobservable in the period under investigation is most likely attributable to the yield drop\nas opposed to an alternative observable or unobservable force.\nI present additional robustness checks in Table A1 of the Appendix. First, I show\nresults for an alternative dependent variable. Instead of newly issued credit, in column\n2 of Table A1 I use the outstanding stock of credit as outcome variable. The previous\nresults hold. As expected, the magnitude of the effect is reduced in this case because\nthe credit stock includes maturing assets, which might lead to a smaller increase of this\nvariable as opposed to the amount of truly newly issued loans. Looking at the coefficient\nof the MP variable in column 2 of Table A1 banks with a one standard deviation decrease\nof their average yield (0.41) in their portfolio increase their outstanding stock of credit by\nColumn 3 of Table A1 shows results with a dummy variable instead of the continuous\nMP variable. The dummy takes the value of 1 for banks with a yield drop above the median\nof the MP variable distribution. The baseline result remains qualitatively unchanged.\nNext, to further highlight the economic plausibility of my results, in column 4 of\nTable A1 I weight the MP variable with the securities to assets ratio. The rebalancing\nmotive should be larger for banks that hold a larger fraction of yield-decreasing securities\nrelative to their total balance sheet. As expected, this robustness check indicates that the\nsize of the securities portfolio plays a role in the strength of the rebalancing motive.\nTo rule out that the results are driven by potential outliers or the level of winsorization\napplied to the outcome variable in all preceding regressions, I present the results of two\nadditional specifications. In column 5 of Table A1 I winsorize the MP variable at the 1%\nand at the 99%-level of the distribution with little impact on the coefficient estimates. I\nreport results without winsorizing the dependent variable in column 6. The findings are\nconfirmed.\nNext, instead of estimating an interaction term between the maturing asset ratio and\nthe MP variable, I split the sample according to the median of the maturing assets to\ntotal assets ratio in columns 7 and 8. As expected the statistical and economic significance\nis larger for banks with a higher maturing assets to total assets ratio. For banks with\nbelow median maturing assets the coefficient estimate is still significant and positive.\nAdditionally, also the difference between the two coefficients of the two groups of banks\n(with a high or low maturing asset ratio) is significant for both models.21\nEventually, I change the timing of the construction of the MP variable. Instead of\ncalculating the decline in yields between January 2014 and June 2015, I choose a smaller\ntime window, i.e. January 2014 until December 2014. Results are robust to this alternative\ntiming and are displayed in column 9 of Table A1. The coefficient estimate of the MP\nvariable is somewhat smaller in this case. This makes sense economically, as yields further\n5 Conclusion\nI have documented new stylized facts regarding the credit and security holdings of German\nbanks. The change in the spread between the average interest rates that German banks\ncharge on loans to the non-financial sector and the yield on securities that they hold has\nincreased during a time period of implementation of various unconventional monetary\npolicy measures. At the same time also the volume of credit supplied has increased in\nrelation to the nominal securities holdings.\nBuilding on these stylized facts, in this paper I analyze the following questions: Given\nthe change in relative prices between securities and credit, do banks that face a larger\ndecrease in yields of their securities portfolio induced by unconventional monetary policy\nmeasures supply more credit to the real sector? Do those banks also reduce their securities\ninvestments, thus, changing their portfolio allocation? And if so, are those banks selling\nthe securities with the highest yield decline, thus realizing valuation gains? Are the effects\nstronger for less capitalized banks?\n21The p-value of the two-sided t-test of the difference between the two coefficients (with 87 degrees of\nfreedom, i.e. 102 observations-15 controls and fixed effects) is 3.9%. In both cases the t-statistic reads:\n( ^\n- ^\n)/( se( ^\n)2 + se( ^\nThe availability and combination of the securities register, bank balance sheet infor-\nmation, and, most importantly, data from monetary policy implementation, provides a\ncomprehensive view on banks' balance sheets and facilitates to answer the above questions.\nI find that banks experiencing higher drops in yields of their securities portfolio seek to\nrestore their targeted yield level by increasing their higher-yielding credit extension. This\neffect is particularly pronounced for banks with many maturing assets that have to make\nreinvestment decisions. At the same time, these banks reduce their security holdings and\nrealize the gains from securities with a high drop in yield. My results suggest that banks\nactively rebalance their investments from the securities portfolio to the credit book, given\nthe change in the relative price between credit and securities. Thus, the paper sheds\nadditional light on how the transmission of unconventional monetary policy works at the\nbank level.\nMy results are informative for the current debate on the effectiveness of unconventional\nmonetary policy. My paper highlights the importance of keeping hold of the impact of\nthese measures on financial markets as changes in relative prices between bonds and book\ncredit have implications for bank lending to the real sector.\nReferences\nAbbassi, P., R.
