Hicks\n  Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA\nChildren are often inextricably linked to their parents' hopes and dreams. As such, the\nloss of a child often represents one of the most traumatic experiences possible. The\ncurrent research explores how this specific loss relates to one's sense of purpose in life.\nWe further explore whether the loss of a child is particularly detrimental to one's sense\nof purpose for highly interdependent parents. Analyses of parents from the Midlife in the\nUnited States data set revealed, as expected, that the loss of child negatively predicts\none's sense of purpose in life, and that this effect is most pronounced for parents high\nin interdependent self-construal. Potential mechanisms and implications of the present\nfindings are discussed.\nKeywords: parental bereavement, purpose in life, interdependent self-construal, well-being, adaptation\nIntroduction\nPeople from diverse backgrounds commonly believe that children provide life with meaning and\nfulfillment (Toulemon, 1996; Stanley et al., 2003). Corroborating these beliefs, a series of studies\nrecently demonstrated that parents experience more positive emotions, less negative emotions, and\ngreater life satisfaction and meaning in life through child-care activities compared to non-parents\nand contradictory findings).\nWhile children often imbue life with purpose and meaning, the loss of child can shake the\nfoundation of one's existence and detrimentally influence both physical and psychological health.\nResearch shows, for instance, bereaved parents suffer from a wide array of physical and mental\nillness, including higher incidences of cancer (Li et al., 2002), increased mortality (Li et al., 2003),\nmore severe grief symptoms (Hazzard et al., 1992), post-traumatic stress disorder (Murphy et al.,\nand self-concepts (Neimeyer et al., 2002), and doubts in their world-views (Janoff-Bulman, 1989;\nParental bereavement is posited to reduce one's sense of meaning and purpose in life\n(Janoff-Bulman and Frantz, 1997). Indeed, a set of empirical data and qualitative investigations\ndemonstrate that bereaved parents often fail to find meaning in the loss experience for an extended\nperiod of time after the loss of their child, and that these parents report higher mental distress\nand lower physical health compared to those who successfully construct a sense of meaning in the\nLichtenthal et al., 2013; see also Park, 2010 for a review). While prior research has focused primarily\non how situational meaning and a sense of purpose serve as coping resources following the loss of\nKim and Hicks Loss of child and purpose in life\na child, the present study directly examines how losing a child\ninfluences parents' global purpose in life.\nResearchers have defined purpose in life as a central, self-\norganizing life aim that provides a person with a framework for\npursuing life goals (McKnight and Kashdan, 2009). Providing an\noverarching sense of goals and direction in life, purpose in life has\nbeen found to be positively associated with happiness and well-\n(2014) demonstrated that purpose in life serves to buffer against\nmortality risk across adulthood using data from the Midlife in\nUnited States (MIDUS) sample (see also Boyle et al., 2009). The\npresent research aims to explore the possibility that experiencing\nthe loss of a child may violate parents' overarching goals and\nfundamental beliefs about life, and thus reducing their sense of\npurpose.\nA secondary goal of the current research is to explore an\nunexamined psychological factor that may moderate the effect\nof loss of child on purpose in life (e.g., Lehman et al., 1987;\nMcIntosh et al., 1993). In the present study, we suggest that\nindividual differences in interdependent self-construal play a\npivotal role in the extent to which bereaved parents find it\ndifficult to extract purpose in life from the loss experience. People\nwho hold interdependent self-construals value harmony in social\nrelationships and place close others in the core part of their self-\nconcept, whereas those who hold independent self-construals\nvalue autonomy and maintain uniqueness by distancing others\nfrom their self-concept (Markus and Kitayama, 1991; Singelis,\n1994). The closeness between self and significant others among\nthose high in interdependent self-construal is particularly salient\nbetween caregivers and children. For example, among Eastern\nAsians (i.e., interdependent people), one's self is predominantly\ndescribed in terms of their caregivers (Markus and Kitayama,\nprocesses self-relevant information does not distinguish between\nstimuli related to one's self and one's mother, for example (Zhu\npart of the self-concept of parents who possess interdependent\nself-construals.\nBased on the relevant literature on parental bereavement and\ncultural psychology, we hypothesize that (A) losing a child will\ndetract from one's overall sense of purpose in life and (B) this\nrelationship will be stronger for parents high in interdependent\nself-construal than for those low in interdependent self-construal.\nTo test this hypothesis, we employed a longitudinal data\nset that includes American adult respondents. Specifically,\nwe used the same data set MIDUS that Hill and Turiano\n(2014) analyzed to demonstrate that purpose in life predicts\ndecreased mortality rates. Although investigations of self-\nconstrual are often conducted in a cross-cultural manner (e.g.,\nEast vs. West), there is also great variability in self-construal\nwithin cultures (Oyserman et al., 2002). The current research\nfocuses on how individual differences in self-construal, rather\nthan cultural differences, moderate the relationship between\nthe loss of a child and purpose in life. From both cross-\nsectional and longitudinal analyses of the data, we expect\nthat decreased purpose in life by the loss of a child would\nbe more pronounced for parents high in interdependent self-\nconstrual compared to their low interdependent self-construal\ncounterparts.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nWe used two waves of the data sets from MIDUS to test\nour hypotheses. This data set is composed of a nationally\nrepresentative group of individuals aimed at examining age-\nrelated differences in physical and mental health. An initial\ncontiguous states via random-digit dialing of telephone numbers.\npercent of the initial sample participated again. The final sample\nparticipated both in Wave 1 and 2 surveys, was entered in the\ncurrent analyses. The ages of these participants ranged from\nMeasures\nSelf-Construal\nParticipants completed the Self-Construal scale, which consists\nof interdependent self-construal and independent self-construal\nsubscales (Singelis, 1994). Interdependent and independent self-\nconstrual was assessed only at Wave 2. Each scale contained\nthree items (\"My happiness depends on the happiness of those\naround me,\" \"I often have the feeling that my relationships\nwith others are more important than my own accomplishments,\"\nand \"It is important to listen to other's opinions\" for the\ninterdependent self-construal subscale; \"I act in the same way\nno matter who I am with,\" \"I enjoy being unique and different\nfrom others in many respects,\" and \"Being able to take care\nof myself is a primary concern for me\" for the independent\nself-construal subscale). Participants rated the extent of their\nagreement with each item on a 7-point scale (1 = strongly\ndisagree, 7 = strongly agree). Average scores of the items\nin each scale were computed to form separate composites\nTABLE 1 | Cross-sectional analysis.\nPurpose in life W2\nPredictor B  t R2\nStep 1 LOSS\nINTER\nA hierarchical linear regression analysis predicting purpose in life from loss of child\nexperience, interdependent self-construal (Step 1), and interaction between loss of\nchild and interdependent self-construal (Step 2).\nLOSS, loss of child (-1 = no loss, 1 = loss); INTER, interdependent self-construal;\nKim and Hicks Loss of child and purpose in life\nFIGURE 1 | Regression lines predicting purpose in life as a function of losing a child for individuals \u00b11 SD from the mean on interdependent\nself-construal in the cross-sectional (A) and longitudinal (B) analyses.\nfor the interdependent and independent self-construal scales\n(Minter\nwith the previous literature, the two self-construal subscales were\nLoss of Child\nThe experience of losing a child was assessed in two ways.

This self-report was only measured in the Wave 2 survey.\nThere were 2,394 respondents who provided this information,\nand 14.2% of them (339) reported that they lost at least one\nchild in their lifetime. While this measure is the most face valid\nmeasure of loss in the data set, it did not allow us to control\nfor when the loss might have occurred (e.g., 30 years vs. 1 year\nago). To help control for this concern, for our second measure\nof loss, we subtracted the number of children at Wave 2 from\nthe number of children at Wave 1, and defined those having\na negative number for this difference score as parents who\nhad experienced child loss. There were 4,064 respondents who\nprovided the number of children both at Wave 1 and 2, and 7.3%\nof these participants (364) had fewer children at Wave 2 than\nPurpose in Life\nPurpose in life was measured by using the purpose in life\nsubscale of Psychological Well-Being scale (PWB; Ryff, 1989).\nThe subscale consisted of three items [\"I live life 1 day at a\ntime and don't really think about the future (reversed),\" \"Some\npeople wander aimlessly through life, but I am not one of them,\"\nand \"I sometimes feel as if I've done all there is to do in life\n(reversed);\" at Wave 1, at Wave 2], which were rated on a 7-\npoint scale (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree).

Importantly, however, the interaction effect was\nthe experience of losing a child predicted less purpose in life\nfor people high in interdependent self-construal (b = -0.56,\np < 0.001), whereas losing a child was unrelated to purpose in\nlife for those low in interdependent self-construal (b = -0.07,\np = 0.60). This interaction pattern remained consistent even\nwhen relevant covariates (i.e., age, gender, education level,\nincome, number of children, Big Five) were accounted for (see\nNext, we ran the same hierarchical linear regression analysis,\nsubstituting independent self-construal for interdependent self-\nconstrual, that is, entering the main effect terms of independent\nself-construal (centered) and the self-report of losing child\n(effect coded) in Step 1, and their interaction term in\nKim and Hicks Loss of child and purpose in life\nTABLE 2 | Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses.\nCross-sectional analyses Longitudinal analyses\nPurpose in life W2 Purpose in life W2\nPredictor B  t R2 B  t R2\nStep 1 Age\nGender\nIncome\nEducation\n# Children\nEXTRA\nNEURO\nOPEN\nCONS\nAGREE\nStep 2 LOSS\nINTER\nHierarchical linear regression analyses predicting purpose in life from covariates (Step 1), loss of child experience, interdependent self-construal (Step 2), and interaction\nbetween loss of child and interdependent self-construal (Step 3).\nGender: Female = 0, Male = 1; #Children, Number of Children; EXTRA, Extraversion; NEURO, Neuroticism; OPEN, Openness; CONS, Consciousness; AGREE,\nAgreeableness; PIL, purpose in life; LOSS, loss of child (-1 = no loss, 1 = loss); INTER, interdependent self-construal; W1, Wave 1; W2, Wave 2.\nStep 2.

However, the interaction term failed to\nAdditional Analyses\nWe also conducted the additional analyses to examine how\ninterdependent self-construal and parental bereavement predict\nother well-being variables (i.e., subjective well-being and\ndepression) that were available in MIDUS. The results of these\nanalyses did not reveal consistent patterns, indicating that\nthe interactive effect between interdependent self-construal and\nparental bereavement existed only with regard to purpose in\nlife (see Supplementary Material for tables depicting these null\neffects).\nKim and Hicks Loss of child and purpose in life\nDiscussion\nThese findings support our hypothesis that loss of a child erodes\none's sense of purpose in life and that this impact is particularly\npronounced for those with an interdependent self-construal. In\nboth cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses, we found that\nexperiencing loss of a child significantly lowered purpose in life\namong highly interdependent parents, whereas bereavement did\nnot affect purpose in life among parents low in interdependent\nself-construal. In both analyses, independent self-construal did\nnot moderate the effect of loss of children on purpose in life.\nThese findings are consistent with extant research on hedonic\nadaptation demonstrating that important individual differences\nmay bear on the restoration of psychological equanimity after\nthe experience of a negative life event (e.g., Lucas et al., 2003;\nAlthough our results found that purpose in life among parents\nlow in interdependent self-construal did not seem to be affected\nby a loss of a child, we do not suggest that these people are\nimmune to negative responses from these types of traumatic\nevents. Rather, we believe that this indicates that they may\nbe better at \"bouncing back\" from the trauma than highly\ninterdependent parents. They may, for example, have better\ncoping strategies that help them reconstruct purpose in life\n(e.g., they may find it easier to focus on other domains in life\nsuch as work). Of course, it is also possible that the initial\nexperience of bereavement is stronger for highly interdependent\nindividuals (cf., Lucas et al., 2003). The adaptation process\nmight be homogenous for all parents but, because of this initial\ndifference, those with interdependent self-construal may take\nmuch longer to regain their sense of purpose. Future research\nneeds to explore the mechanisms underlying the different levels\nof purpose in life between bereaved parents high and low in\ninterdependent self-construal.\nInterestingly, independent self-construal did not affect\npurpose in life among bereaved parents. This finding suggests\nthat experiencing parental bereavement life events is uniquely\nassociated with interdependent self-construal rather than\nindependent self-construal, which is consistent with prior\nresearch demonstrating that the dimensions of independent\nand interdependent self-construals are orthogonal and thus can\ncoexist in individuals (e.g., Singelis, 1994). However, it is possible\nthat other types of personal loss, that have more individualistic\nimplications (e.g., losing one's eyesight), might relate to purpose\nin life more strongly for people high in independent self-\nconstrual. Future research should investigate whether the various\ntypes of personal loss uniquely interact with independent and\ninterdependent self-construal to predict a sense of purpose.\nHedonic well-being is described as a subjective state of feeling\npleasure and satisfied with one's life, whereas eudaimonic well-\nbeing is defined as a state of human flourishing that is achieved\nfrom pursuing goals expressing one's true self and giving purpose\nand meaning to his life (Ryan and Deci, 2001). These two aspects\nof well-being often operate in tandem (e.g., King et al., 2006) but\nare also theoretically and empirically distinct (e.g., Baumeister\net al., 2013). Previous literatures on adaptation following critical\nlife events primarily focus on changes in hedonic aspects of\nhappiness (i.e., subjective well-being; Lucas et al., 2003; Luhmann\net al., 2012). However, eudaimonic aspects of happiness are\nalso influenced by various life events (Waterman, 2007; Durkin\npurpose in life as one particular dimension of eudaimonic well-\nbeing that is affected by the loss of a child. Future research should\nexamine how self-construal and specific types of trauma uniquely\ndetract from hedonic and eudaimonic sources of happiness.\nThe current findings have implications for cultural psychology\nby showing that the impact of parental bereavement on purpose\nin life is more pronounced for interdependent people than\nindependent people. An obvious limitation is that we only\ncompared interdependent and independent people within the\nsame culture. Future research should examine whether the same\npattern of results emerges in direct cross-cultural comparisons.\nFor example, is it possible that the loss of a child is more traumatic\nfor people from Eastern cultures compared to Western cultures?\nOr, perhaps people from Eastern cultures have other types of\ncoping mechanisms that help them regain a sense of purpose\nfollowing the loss of a child? These possibilities remain to be\naddressed by future research.\nConclusion\nOur findings demonstrate that the loss of a child threatens\nparents' sense of purpose and that it may be particularly difficult\nfor highly interdependent parents to rediscover meaningful goal\npursuits after such tragedy. It is our hope that future research will\nuncover the underlying mechanisms driving this effect and the\nvariables that help highly interdependent people cope with the\nloss of a child.\nAuthor Contributions\nJK and JH developed the research hypothesis.
