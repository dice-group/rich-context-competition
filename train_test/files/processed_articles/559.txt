For example,\nin 2010 among employed individuals whose highest degree was\na Bachelor's, females comprised around 42% of the workforce\nin mathematics, 11% of the workforce in engineering, 23% of\nthe workforce in computer and information sciences, and 34% of\nthe workforce in physical sciences (National Science Foundation,\nCareer aspirations based on individual competencies, values,\nand perceived compatibility of competencies and values, are for-\nmulated in adolescence and shape the academic pathways that lead\nto the STEM pipeline (Tai et al., 2006). It is very difficult to initiate\na STEM trajectory after beginning college, due to the very con-\nstrained and prescribed curricula in STEM fields (Tyson, 2011).\nTherefore, in order to prevent many talented and capable young\nwomen from opting out of the STEM pipeline, it is important to\nidentify the intellectual and psychological factors that surface in\nthe elementary and secondary school years and predict later career\ntodesigninterventionprogramstoimpactSTEMachievementand\noccupational choices through these factors will be more optimally\ntailored to females.\nDespite many researchers dedicating themselves to studying\nthe gender gap in STEM fields, the extant literature is limited in\nseveral ways. Current reform efforts primarily focus on improving\nstudents' exposure to and performance in advanced-level math\ncourses in high school as a way to address the gender gap in\nSTEM. While encouraging math achievement and enrollment in\nadvanced courses is an important step in setting the foundation\nfor the successful attainment of STEM careers, it alone does not\naccount for the complex motivational factors that influence STEM\ncareer choice (Eccles, 2009). In fact, neither mathematical apti-\ntude, nor advanced math course enrollment are strongly predictive\nof student enjoyment in math-related activities or career choice\n(Wang and Degol, 2013). Instead, students' motivational beliefs\n(e.g., competence beliefs, attitudes, values, interest) about math\nlearning are more critical determinants of future educational and\ntance of motivational beliefs has been widely recognized, most\nstudies are limited to STEM performance or college major as the\noutcome and very few longitudinal studies have addressed the\nunderlying factors in the high school years that motivate girls to\npursue actual STEM careers in adulthood (Lubinski and Benbow,\nAlthough ability self-concept (feeling competent to succeed)\nhas been shown to be an important predictor of academic per-\nand perceived task value play highly important roles in shap-\ning individual achievement and career choices, and can be\nmore influential than academic self-concept (Eccles, 2009). For\nexample, studies show that in early adolescence, girls and boys\ntend to endorse different work preferences and lifestyle values\nWang et al. Gender and STEM\n(Ferriman et al., 2009). These personal interests and task values\ncan rest outside of students' perceptions of their own intellectual\nabilities, and may contribute to the gender gaps in STEM perfor-\nmance and career choices. However, it is unclear whether students'\nmotivational beliefs (subjective task values in particular) medi-\nate the relation between gender and STEM career through math\nachievement.\nIn this study, we draw on Eccles' (2009) expectancy-value the-\nory to assess which intellectual competencies and motivational\nbeliefs move individuals toward or away from STEM careers.\nExpectancy-value theory posits that achievement-related choices,\nsuch as occupation selection, are most directly influenced by intel-\nlectual competencies, ability self-concepts, and the subjective task\nvalue attached to the various options. Subjective task value is com-\nprised of interest value (liking or enjoyment), utility value (the\ninstrumental value of the task for helping to fulfill personal goals),\nattainment value (the link between the task and one's sense of self,\nidentity, and core personal values), and cost (what may be given up\nby making a specific choice). Career choices are ultimately made\nafter a number of options, and their various components (e.g.,\nmoney, authority, social connection) are evaluated and identified\nas either fitting personal goals or not. Gender differences in career\nchoices reflect gendered differences in relative intellectual compe-\ntencies, ability self-concepts, and the relative subjective task value\nof each option under consideration.\nThere are small average gender differences between boys and girls\non some indicators of intellectual competencies: girls outperform\nboys in some tests on verbal skills (Park et al., 2008); and girls earn\nslightly higher grades in all school subjects, including high school\nmath and science (Hyde et al., 2008). Furthermore, differences in\nthe proportion of males and females scoring in the extreme right\ntail of high stakes math and reading standardized tests have been\nconsistently detected. Males outnumber females in the top 0.01%\nof the distribution in the SAT and ACT math subtests by 4:1 and\n3:1,respectively,whilefemaleshaveaslightadvantageontheverbal\nsubtests (Wai et al., 2012). These findings lead to the conclusion\nthat intellectual aptitude, at least by itself, is not the dominant\nfactor in the underrepresentation of women in STEM fields (Ceci\nExpectations for success, confidence in one's abilities to succeed,\nand personal efficacy have emerged as important predictors of\nacademic achievement and activity involvement (Wigfield et al.,\n2006). Both boys and girls who rate their math competence highly\nare more likely to enroll in advanced math courses and receive\nhigher grades in math (Pajares, 2005). Additionally, high school\ngirls tend to rate their math competence lower than boys with sim-\nilar math grades (Correll, 2001); a finding of particular interest\ngiven that poor math self-concept or perceived competence may\nplay a role in female underperformance in mathematics (Durik\net al., 2006). Yet intellectual competencies or competence beliefs\nare a necessary--but not sufficient--predictor of career choices\n(Joyce and Farenga, 2000). As suggested by expectancy-value the-\nory, career choices depend not only on confidence in one's abilities\nto succeed, but also on subjective task values--the value one\nattaches to relevant subject domains and the goals associated with\nthese domains.\nResearch on subjective task values shows a number of poten-\ntially interrelating effects and gender variations. For instance,\ndespite similarities in math performance, girls' `liking' of math\ndecreases on average as they move through adolescence to a greater\nextent than boys' (Koller et al., 2001). Girls also are more likely to\nexpress greater interest in English than math when compared to\nboys (Jacobs et al., 2002). These findings, in combination with\nresearch showing that even females with high math-aptitude tend\nto express less interest in math-intensive careers (Lubinski and\nBenbow, 2006), suggest that differential interest and task value\nin math may contribute to the underrepresentation of women in\nSTEM fields.\nGender differences in occupational and lifestyle values (forms\nof utility and attainment values) are also potentially impor-\ntant contributing factors to women's underrepresentation in\nexample, females are typically more interested in socially ori-\nented careers, while males are more interested in working\nwhile, women are more likely to value the development of\naltruistic, reciprocal relationships more than men (Schwartz\nand Rubel, 2005). This phenomena is illustrated by the fact\nthat women tend to put more value on jobs that allow\nthem to help others and make meaningful contributions to\nsociety (communion/affiliative orientation; Abele and Spurk,\n2011) and math-intensive careers are usually viewed as being\nobject-oriented (Webb et al., 2002) and less social (Hill et al.,\nFinally, research on how priorities beyond career fulfillment\nhelp shape females'decisions to refrain from entering STEM fields,\nindicate that life values and `sense of fit' are important factors.\nPer Hakim (2006), women tend to prefer more home-centered\nlifestyles, whereas men tend to prefer more work-committed\nlifestyles, and math-related careers are not perceived by females\nas accommodating to their desired work-family balance. Because\nwork-familybalanceishighlyrelevanttocareer-agedwomen,most\nstudies have been conducted with adult females; however, this\ngap in the literature makes it unclear whether family work bal-\nance is an important predictor of career choices for high school\nstudents.\nThe current study investigates (1) which intellectual and moti-\nvational factors in high school predict gender differences in career\nchoices and (2) whether students' motivational beliefs mediated\nthe pathway of gender on STEM career through math achieve-\nment. Two sets of analyses were conducted to this end. In the\nfirst set of analyses, we used hierarchical logistic regression to test\nwhether math ability self-concept and subjective task values (i.e.,\nmath interest, social and family values, and desired job character-\nistics) at 12th grade predicted gender differences in the selection\nof STEM vs. non-STEM careers, while holding math and reading\nability, and family socioeconomic status constant. In the second\nset of analyses, we tested the role of subjective task values and\nFrontiers in Psychology | Developmental Psychology February 2015 | Volume 6 | Article 36 | 2\nWang et al. Gender and STEM\nmath achievement as potential mediators for predicting gender\ndifferences in selecting STEM and non-STEM careers.\nPARTICIPANTS\nWe used data from the Longitudinal Study of American Youth,\na large-scale national study initiated in 1987 that followed two\ncohorts of students through middle school, high school, and at\nvarious stages beyond high school, focusing predominantly on\nstudent, family, and school characteristics that influence student\nachievement, interest, and occupational proclivities toward math\nand science. The base-year sample consisted of 3,116 students in\ngraders (mean age = 15 years, cohort I) from 50 public school sys-\ntems across the country. Schools were classified as urban (25%),\nsuburban (42%), and rural (33%). Selected schools are considered\nrepresentative of secondary schools across the country. Each year\nparticipants were given standardized tests of math achievement in\naddition to completing questionnaires about their experiences and\nattitudesonSTEM-relatedlearning. Readingachievementwasalso\nassessed for both cohorts in 12th grade. In 2007, when the original\nstudy participants were between 33 and 37 years of age, a sample\nof 3,689 original participants (76% response rate) completed the\ntelephone interview surveys, updating their educational and occu-\npationalhistoryfromposthighschoolintotheirmid-thirties. Data\nused in this study were mainly from two waves: 12th grade and the\nfemale adolescents.\nTo determine whether the students who participated in 12th\ngrade differed from those who dropped out between the ages of\n33\u00ad37, a series of independent samples contingency table anal-\nyses and t-tests were conducted with all independent, outcome,\nand demographic variables at 12th grade. Results revealed that\nthose who dropped out of the study did not differ from those who\nparticipated in the study at 12th grade. We used full information\nmaximum likelihood (FIML) estimation in Mplus 7.3 to account\nfor missing data in all analysis, as FIML was recommended as the\nmost appropriate approach to handle missing data when data are\nmissing at least at random (Allison, 2012).\nMEASURES\nSTEM occupation\nParticipants' occupations at ages 33\u00ad37 were self-reported in a\ntelephone interview conducted in 2007. We operationalized occu-\npations into two categories: (1) non-STEM, consisting of careers\nin the fine arts, literature, business, education, and social sciences,\nand (2) STEM jobs, consisting of occupations in mathematics,\nengineering, computer science, life science, medical science, and\nphysical science.\nMath and reading achievement\nStandardized math scores were used from tests taken by stu-\ndents in the spring of 12th grade. The test was developed by the\n(National Assessment of Educational Progress [NAEP], 1986) to\nmeasure students' knowledge of math, the application and utiliza-\ntion of math knowledge, and integration of math knowledge. A\nstandardized test of reading developed by the Educational Test-\ning Service was used to measure students' reading comprehension\nin the spring of 12th grade. Multiple-group item-response theory\n(IRT) methods were used to scale scores on a metric with a mean\nMath ability self-concept\nStudents completed a survey in the fall of 12th grade indicating\ntheir math ability self-concept. The math ability self-concept scale\n(Bleeker and Jacobs, 2004) included three items that measured\nstudents' perceived abilities and expectancy for success in math\n(e.g., \"I am good at math,\" \"I usually understand math\"). The\nacademic self-concept scale was rated from 1 (strongly disagree) to\n5 (strongly agree) with higher scores reflecting higher math ability\nSubjective task values\nIn the fall of 12th grade, we measured students' interest values,\nutility values, and attainment values (Eccles et al., 1997):\nMath task value. The math task value scale included five items\nthat measured students' interest, enjoyment, and the value they\nattach to math (e.g., \"I enjoy math,\" \"Math is useful in everyday\nproblems\"). The math task value scale was rated from 1 (strongly\ndisagree) to 5 (strongly agree) with higher scores reflecting higher\ntask values in math ( = 0.75).\nAltruism, family values, and monetary values. Students rated the\nrelative importance (1 = not important; 2 = somewhat important;\n3 = very important) of a variety of future economic, social, and\nfamilial goals. Three separate constructs were generated indicat-\ning the extent to which youth exemplified altruistic values, family\nvalues, and monetary values. A total of four items were used to\nindicate the importance students attributed to having an active\nrole in helping others in their communities, including changing\nsocial/economic wrongs,staying current on social issues,and help-\ning others within the community ( = 0.77). Family values were\nconstructed using two items that reflected the importance students\nattributedtohavingchildrenandprioritizingtheirfamilylifeinthe\nfuture ( = 0.69). Finally, monetary values measured the extent\nto which students valued making lots of money in the future.\nHigher scores indicate placing greater importance on altruism,\nfamily values, or monetary values.\nWork preferences. Students completed a survey indicating quali-\nties of a future career they would find preferable. Students checked\na box to indicate whether they preferred a job with the character-\nistics listed (1 = yes; 0 = no). In order to examine the extent to\nwhich youth preferred to work with people or objects, two items\nwere examined for the absence or presence of a checkmark: prefers\na job that allows work with other people in teams, and prefers a\njob that allows work with numbers and formulas. Working with\nteams, therefore, represents a people-oriented job focus and work-\ning with numbers and formulas represents an object-oriented job\nfocus.\nCovariates\nWe controlled for several potential confounds related to individual\ncareer choices in STEM fields, including child gender (0 = female;\nWang et al. Gender and STEM\n1 = male), child race/ethnicity (0 = White; 1 = others), parent\neducation (0 = some college/HS or less; 1 = BA/BS or higher),\nand parent STEM employment (0 = parents do not work in STEM\nor technical field; 1 = at least one parent is employed in a STEM\nor technical profession). Parental education and employment were\ncollected from parent reports.\nRESULTS\nWe compared males and females on career choice, covariates, and\nindependent variables. Chi-square tests were used for dichoto-\nmous variables, and independent sample t-tests for continuous\nvariables (see Table 1). More males chose STEM careers than\nfemales, and preferred to work with numbers. Moreover, males\nhad higher math achievement, math ability self-concept, math\ntask value, and a greater preference for high-paying careers. In\ncontrast, females had higher reading achievement, altruism, and\nfamily values.\nWe conducted hierarchical logistic regression to examine which\nintellectual and motivational factors were predictive of STEM\ncareers and contributed to gender disparities in selection of STEM\noccupations, controlling for child gender and race, parent educa-\ntion, and parent STEM employment (see Table 2). All continuous\npredictors, including math achievement, reading achievement,\naltruism, family values, math ability self-concept, and math task\nvalue, were standardized to have mean of zero and SD of one. All\ndichotomous predictors were indicator coded. Variance Inflation\nFactor (VIF) was calculated for all predictors and there was no\nconcern with multicollinearity (VIFs < 2.3).\nIn the first set of hierarchical logistic regression models,\nwe included gender as the only predictor to show the gen-\nder disparity in STEM occupation. Males were 1.38 times\n(p = 0.005) as likely as females to choose STEM careers.\nSecond, we added student race/ethnicity, parent education,\nand parent STEM occupation, which all significantly predicted\nSTEM occupation (ps < 0.02). The gender effect was still sig-\nThird, we added math and reading achievement, and found\nthat only math achievement was significantly related to STEM\noccupation. Importantly, the gender effect was reduced to non-\nsignificance. Fourth, we added math ability self-concept and\nmath task value, in which only math task value was positively\nassociated with STEM occupation. Fifth, we added altruism,\nfamily values, and monetary importance, with only altruism\nnegatively predicting STEM occupation. Finally, we added stu-\ndent's work preferences (e.g., either working with people or\nobjects), both of which failed to significantly differentiate career\nchoices.\nIn order to test the mediation effect of math task value and\nmath achievement on gender differences in career choice, we\nadopted the outlined procedure in Baron and Kenny (1986). We\nfirst assessed the total direct effect of gender on STEM occupa-\ntion with a logistic regression model while partialling out the\neffects of such covariates as race, parent education, parent occu-\npation, and reading achievement from STEM occupation. Then\nwe conducted two path models to tease out the mediation effects\nof math achievement, math task values, and altruism on gen-\nder difference in STEM occupation, while partialling out the\neffects of the covariates from all mediators and STEM occupa-\ntion. In the first mediation model (Figure 1A), we tested only\nthe mediation effect of math achievement. In the second media-\ntion model (Figure 1B), we added math task values and altruism\nas additional mediators given that the hierarchical logistic regres-\nsion results suggested that altruism and math task values were\nthe only significant motivational predictors of STEM occupa-\ntion. A direct relationship was modeled from math task value and\naltruismtomathachievement.

In the first path model, math\nachievement significantly mediated the gender difference in STEM\noccupation, with the indirect effect estimated to be 0.17 (95%\nBCI: 0.11-0.24), indicating that, indirectly via math achieve-\nment, the odds of males choosing STEM occupations increased\nby 1.19 times that of females. In the second path model, males\nhad higher math achievement and math task value, but lower\naltruism. Math task value was significantly associated with math\nachievement, while altruism was not. Both math task value and\naltruism were directly and significantly associated with STEM\noccupation, positively for math task value, and negatively for\naltruism. We found four significant indirect paths, including:\n(1) Gender  Math Task Value  STEM occupation, (2) Gen-\nder  Altruism  STEM occupation, (3) Gender  Math Task\nValue  Math Achievement  STEM occupation, and (4) Gen-\nder  Math Achievement  STEM occupation.

In order to elucidate the factors associated with\nfemales' underrepresentation in STEM, the current study exam-\nined which factors predicted gender differences in the selection\nof STEM occupations, and whether math task values and altru-\nism mediated the pathway of the gender effect on STEM career\nchoice through math achievement. Identifying potential barriers\nthat keep women from fulfilling their potential in STEM fields will\nhelp inform intervention efforts targeting the removal of these\nbarriers.\nWe found that math achievement in 12th grade mediated the\nassociation between gender and attainment of a STEM career\nby the early to mid-thirties. Women were less likely than men\nto pursue a career in STEM, but this relation was explained\nby gender differences in math achievement in high school. Our\nresults show that women, on average, had lower math stan-\ndardized scores than men, and unsurprisingly, individuals with\nhigher math achievement were more likely to attain a career\nin STEM. However, math achievement was not the only factor\ndistinguishing gender differences in STEM occupations. Math\ntask value partially mediated the pathways among gender, math\nachievement, and STEM careers. Women had lower math task\nvalues than men, and lower math task value was associated with\nlower math achievement and lower likelihood of pursuing STEM\ncareers. Essentially, despite math achievement explaining career\nFrontiers in Psychology | Developmental Psychology February 2015 | Volume 6 | Article 36 | 6\nWang et al. Gender and STEM\ndifferences between men and women, math task value also con-\ntributed to the gender differences in STEM career attainment\nthat were attributed to math achievement. These findings shed\nsome light onto the complex ways that ability self-concept and\nsubjective task values operate in promoting STEM career selec-\ntion. Expectancy-value theory posits that individuals consider\nmultiple factors when selecting potential careers, including prior\nachievement, perceived competencies, and task values. In line\nwith this theory, math task value and altruism (a form of util-\nity value) predicted STEM career, but math ability self-concept\ndid not. Previous research has found that ability self-concept is\npredictive of academic achievement, but, unlike subjective task\nvalues, it is not consistently linked to educational or career choices\n(Durik et al., 2006). In other words, believing that you are good\nat a task may further enhance your performance in the task, but\nit does not mean that you enjoy the task and will continue to\npursue it.\nHow do these findings relate to factors associated with females'\nunderrepresentation in STEM fields? Increasing math achieve-\nmentisimportantforincreasingwomen'srepresentationinSTEM,\nbut achievement alone may not be sufficient. We know that\nachievement matters for STEM enrollment; many of the most\nmathematically talented individuals eventually achieve prestigious\ncareers in STEM fields (Wai et al., 2010). Historically, women's\nunderperformance in quantitative reasoning skills relative to men's\nhas been considered one of the main factors in women's deci-\nsions to opt out of STEM fields (Halpern, 2007). In response,\npublic focus and political initiatives have centered on increasing\nfemale math performance and advanced math course enrollment.\nHowever, converging evidence from the current study and other\nresearch has demonstrated that increasing quantitative skills alone\nwill not effectively lead to greater female participation in STEM\net al., 2012). While gender differences in attainment of STEM\ncareers was explained by lower female performance on standard-\nized math tests in our first model, the second model demonstrated\nthat this pathway (gender to achievement to STEM career) was\npartially attributed to gender differences in math task values.\nGirls consistently express less interest in math (Jacobs et al.,\n2002) and view math and STEM careers as less aligned with their\npersonal career interests and goals (Su et al., 2009). Studies have\nshown that greater interest and greater perceived importance and\nutility value of math may lead to greater investment in and per-\nsistence in math activities, which ultimately lead to higher math\naside from promoting greater math achievement, current policy\ninitiatives also need to target the development of math task values:\nencouraging interest in math and its utility value. When women\nsee STEM fields as useful, widely applicable, and viable career\noptions they will be more likely to opt into them.\nGiven that math interest and task values are linked to aca-\ndemic performance, the benefits derived from enhancing math\ntask value may be twofold. If math task values impact math\nachievement and selection of STEM occupations, then intervening\nto promote subjective task values in math should not only increase\nSTEM persistence in the long run, but also enhance math achieve-\nment. Since math achievement positively predicted long term\ndecisions in STEM career, the developmental impacts of interven-\ntions that seek to increase math task value could be exponential\ncompared to programs that target math skills alone. Further-\nmore, targeting math task values may not only lead to increases in\nmath achievement, but improved math performance may actually\nfurther enhance math task value, given that the two are recipro-\ncally linked over time. Exclusively focusing on math achievement\nas a path to STEM persistence is a unimodal answer, while\nincreasing math task values in addition to achievement is a multi-\nmodal solution that could activate multiple pathways to a STEM\ncareer.\nFurthermore, since our study shows that math task values begin\nto predict students' STEM attainment as early as high school,\nearly intervention is vital. Recent studies have shown that interest\nand career aspirations in STEM emerge prior to entry into high\nschool, and that by 12th grade the decision to major in a STEM vs.\nnon-STEM career is largely solidified for many students (Maltese\nand Tai, 2011). While there are an increasing number of pro-\ngrams that target student interest, enjoyment, and engagement in\nSTEM (e.g., Detroit Area Pre-College Engineering Program, Great\nExplorations in Math and Science, Project Lead the Way), these\ncrucial motivating factors should become a greater focus of all k-\n12 interventions. Particularly, given that increases in STEM course\ntaking and achievement among females have not led to compa-\nrable increases in STEM workforce participation, programs need\nto strengthen teacher training and redesign curriculum to include\ntargeted strategies for dispelling gender stereotypes and increasing\nfemale interest in STEM.\nOur findings suggest that enhancing women's math task value\nmay be instrumental in inspiring larger numbers of women to\nseriously consider STEM fields as viable career options. But\nhow would this look in practice? We know that students are\nmore engaged in classrooms that incorporate hands-on learn-\ning, creative thinking, and challenging real-world applications\nof problems and concepts (Marks, 2000). For girls and women\nin particular, it may be helpful to take a proactive approach\nthat utilizes their unique strengths. For instance, a recent study\nshowed that girls are more likely than boys to have both high\nverbal and math skills (Wang et al., 2013). Therefore, incor-\nporating storytelling into math may not only capitalize on the\nstrengths of girls' verbal skills but also increase female interest\nin math and science by making these subjects appear hands-\non and practical. Additionally, specific teaching strategies such\nas focusing on women's historical contributions to these fields,\nand increasing girls' exposure and access to female scientists\nand engineers as career role models (Steinke et al., 2007), may\nhelp combat the pervasive math-gender stereotypes that affect\ngirls' math identities as young as 6 years of age (Cvencek et al.,\nAltruism can also be emphasized. Women view helping people\nand contributing to the greater good as highly important career\nceived to be in line with STEM careers. Indeed, our study suggests\nthat altruism mediated the gender effect on STEM occupations.\nSince it is plainly not the goal to make women less altruistic, STEM\neducators should place greater emphasis on demonstrating how\nfemale scientists can develop technologies and make discoveries\nWang et al. Gender and STEM\nthat greatly benefit people's lives. This is in line with the National\nAcademy of Engineering [NAE]'s (2013) recent efforts to alter\npublic perceptions by communicating that engineering is a help-\ning profession that works on solving problems of human health\nand safety throughout the world.\nInterestingly, differences in family and monetary values, and\npreferences for working with people or numbers did not explain\ngender differences in STEM careers. The lack of findings for fam-\nily values was not unexpected; previous research has demonstrated\nthat gender differences in work/family balance preferences do not\ntypically emerge until the mid-30 s or adulthood, when women\nare more likely to be raising children and building their fami-\nlies (Ferriman et al., 2009). Since family values were assessed in\n12th grade, we can expect that work/family lifestyle preferences\nwill not yet factor prominently in determining male/female dif-\nferences in STEM choice. Similarly, monetary values may not\nhave predicted gender differences in career choices at this age,\nbecause much like family values, concern over earned income is\na distal issue that will be experienced more fully in adulthood.\nMore immediate concerns over money, such as tuition costs and\nstudent loan debt, may have greater bearing in adolescence. Pref-\nerences for working with people or numbers, which typically\ndiffer along gender lines, also failed to explain gender differences\nin STEM careers. Most occupations allow for the opportunity\nto work with people, numbers, and objects to varying degrees.\nThe key difference is in how prominently these aspects are fea-\ntured in a career (e.g., interacting directly with people, such as\nteaching vs. interacting directly with numbers, such as engineer-\ning). However, enjoyment of working with numbers does not\nnecessarily indicate a lack of enjoyment in working with people\nand vice versa, and both may be large components of the same\ncareer (e.g., teaching engineering students). For this reason, it is\nlikely that these preferences may not explain gender differences in\nSTEM career selection to the same degree as math task value and\naltruism.\nCONCLUSION\nDespite women's advances in the U.S. workforce, their entrance\ninto lucrative STEM careers has been less successful, and these\nprofessions continue to be heavily male-dominated. The prestige\nand innovation surrounding math and science, along with their\naccompanying economic benefits, are not extended to women\nwhen they are non-participatory in these fields. Our study builds\non well-established literature by identifying the intellectual and\nmotivational factors contributing to women's underrepresenta-\ntion in STEM. However, it is important to reiterate that generating\ngreater female interest in STEM should not be equated with\nforcing unwanted career choices on them. We do not want to\ncoerce women into STEM fields if they have no interest in them,\nand we do not want to undermine the importance and value\nof non-STEM careers. Instead, we seek to alter instructional\napproaches to math and science education to demonstrate how\nSTEM careers can benefit society and provide opportunities for\nhelping and interacting with others, thereby, merging women's\npersonal task values and career aspirations. Furthermore, many\nadolescents may not truly understand what it means to obtain a\ndegree in STEM (Fralick et al., 2009). Introducing youth to the\ndifferent majors they can pursue in STEM and the careers that\nthese degrees will prepare them for can provide adolescents with\na better understanding of the nature of these occupations. Ensur-\ning that females are well informed of the full diversity of options\navailable in STEM will enable math-competent females to better\nevaluate the utility and cost of different STEM careers. Our main\ngoals are to present all of the STEM career opportunities avail-\nable to women, remove misconceptions that operate as barriers\nto STEM enrollment, and empower women to make career deci-\nsions that best meet their needs for personal and occupational\nfulfillment.\nREFERENCES\nAbele, A.
