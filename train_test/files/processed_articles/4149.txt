    "abstract": "Abstract\nWe report on the results of two online experiments designed to compare different soundtracks\nthat had been composed (by various researchers and sound designers) in order to evoke/match\ndifferent basic tastes. In Experiment 1, 100 participants listened to samples from 24 soundtracks\nand chose the taste (sweet, sour, salty, or bitter) that best matched each sample. Overall, the\nsweet soundtracks most effectively evoked the taste intended by the composer (participants chose\nsweet 56.9% of the time for the sweet soundtracks), whereas the bitter soundtracks were the least\neffective (participants chose bitter 31.4% of the time for the bitter soundtracks), compared with\nchance (choosing any specific taste 25% of the time). In Experiment 2, 50 participants rated their\nemotional responses (in terms of pleasantness and arousal) to the same 24 soundtrack samples\nand also to imaginary sweet/sour/salty/bitter-tasting foods. Associations between soundtracks and\ntastes were partly mediated by pleasantness for the sweet and bitter tastes and partly by arousal\nfor the sour tastes. These results demonstrate how emotion mediation may be an additional\nmechanism behind sound-taste correspondences.\n",

Another such area involves background noise and its impact on taste\nperception (Spence, Michel, & Smith, 2014). For example, white noise mimicking the\nconditions inside an airline cabin has been shown to selectively reduce the perceived intensity\nof sweet tastes (Yan & Dando, 2015). Meanwhile, performing a vocal shadowing plus musical\ndistraction task can significantly impair participants' ability to discriminate the alcohol content\nof a drink (Stafford, Agobiani, & Fernandes, 2013; see Spence, 2014, for a review).\nMoving beyond environmental sounds and their impact on taste/texture/flavor perception,\none also has to consider the influence of crossmodal correspondences. These are the general\nassociations that people make between seemingly unrelated attributes (or dimensions) of\ndifferent sensory modalities (see Spence, 2011, for a review). A growing list of\ncorrespondences have now been documented between specific sound and taste\nattributes--such as, for example, between high pitch and sourness, or between low pitch\nKno\nAs part of this growing movement to study sound-taste correspondences, a number of\nresearchers and sound designers have recently started to compose their own soundtracks to\nmatch (or, in some sense, go together well with) specific tastes. Increasingly, such\nsoundscapes/soundtracks are being used in both scientific research and artistic\nperformances (e.g., Crisinel et al., 2012; Knoeferle, Woods, Ka\nKontukoski et al., 2015; Mesz, Sigman, & Trevisan, 2012; Reinoso Carvalho, Van Ee,\nRychtarikova, Touhafi, Steenhaut, Persoone, & Spence, 2015; Reinoso Carvalho, Van Ee,\nRychtarikova, Touhafi, Steenhaut, Persoone, Spence, & Leman, 2015; Wang, 2013). Such\nsoundtracks could have either or both of the following aims: (a) to demonstrate a connection\nbetween taste and sound in terms of participants being able to associate certain soundtracks\nwith specific tastes and (b) to alter the perceived taste of food and drink while participants\nlisten to such soundtracks.\nWhile the connection between soundscapes and tastes (or taste words) can initially seem\nsurprising, it can also be seen as an extension of the power of music to express abstract ideas.\nMany years ago, when Rigg (1937) tested how well a group of college students could interpret\nthe intended meanings of musical compositions, the participants could only reliably\ndistinguish between broad categories of joyful and sad music but were unable to\ndiscriminate between more specific categories like farewell or mourning. More recently,\nhowever, Watt and Quinn (2007) have shown that music can be reliably associated with\nmany higher level concepts, such as gender (i.e., male vs. female) and age (young vs. old).\nThe fact that certain soundtracks can be reliably matched to particular taste words\n(e.g., Knoeferle et al., 2015; Mesz et al., 2012) demonstrates the strength of the crossmodal\ncorrespondences that exist between sound/music and taste.\nOne potential explanation for such matching of sound/music with taste is emotion\nmediation. That is, certain crossmodal correspondences may be explained by the common\nemotional associations (such as pleasantness or arousal, see Collier, 1996, for a reduction of\nemotion space down to two dimensions) of the various different stimuli involved. In general,\nsuch a hedonic matching account between seemingly unrelated stimuli presented in\ndifferent sensory modalities has been suggested by a variety of sources (see e.g., Palmer,\nSchloss, Xu, & Prado-Leo\nDeroy, et al., 2015; Velasco, Woods, Liu, et al., 2016). Relevant evidence pertaining to the\ncase of crossmodal correspondences between audition and taste has, however, been limited to\nthe pleasantness account. In an experiment designed to test for any crossmodal mappings\nbetween differently flavored chocolates (milk, marzipan, and dark) and sounds varying in\ntheir pitch and timbre (i.e., by instrument type), Crisinel and Spence (2012) reported that\nwhile their participants' choice of instrument could be predicted by the pleasantness ratings\nthey gave to the various chocolates, their choice of pitch was not. Besides pleasantness, to\ndate, no one has looked at the potential role of emotional arousal levels in crossmodal\ncorrespondences between audition and taste.\nUp until now, the soundtracks produced by various researchers and designers have never\nbeen tested in the same setting. Furthermore, some of the soundtracks, such as those used in\nKnoeferle et al. (2015) and Mesz et al. (2012), have only previously been tested in a\nconstrained context in which the participants were essentially given a four-alternative-\nforced-choice task (i.e., with four soundtracks to listen to and four taste words to choose\nfrom). Therefore, in Experiment 1, we tested a group of these recently created taste-inspired\nsoundtracks together in the same sound and taste word matching task. The participants were\nfree to choose any taste word they wished for each of the soundtracks, in order to determine\nwhich of them exhibited the strongest association with a given taste. In Experiment 2, we used\nthe same soundtracks in order to measure the role of emotion as a possible mediator in the\nsoundtrack-taste matching task. We did not ask participants to match the soundtracks to\ntaste words but instead asked for their emotion ratings (for pleasantness and arousal) of the\nsoundtracks and of bitter/salty/sour/sweet-tasting foods. These emotional ratings were then\ncombined with the soundtrack-taste matching results from Experiment 1 in order to calculate\nthe potential role of pleasantness and arousal in mediating the crossmodal correspondence\nbetween audition and taste.\nExperiment 1\nMethods\nParticipants. One hundred participants (51 women, 49 men) aged between 21 and 62 years\n(M \u00bc 34.06, SD \u00bc 9.53) took part in the study. The participants gave their informed consent\nand reported no cold or other impairment of their senses of smell, taste, or hearing. The\nparticipants were recruited from Amazon's Mechanical Turk. The experiment was approved\nby the central university research ethics committee of Oxford University (MSD-IDREC-C1-\nAuditory stimuli. Twenty-four root-mean-square normalized soundtracks (McCarthy, 2007)\nwere used (five bitter, five salty, seven sour, and seven sweet). The soundtracks varied\noriginally from 30 seconds to 6 minutes in length. Since the soundtracks were generally\nuniform in texture, we decided to use only the first 15 seconds of each soundtrack in order\nto have uniform length auditory stimuli and to limit the overall length of the experiment.\nHere is a brief description of the motivation and origins of the soundtracks, categorized by\ncomposer/designer (in alphabetical order):\nCondiment Junkie: A UK sound branding agency recently released an EP album of taste\nsoundtracks. We used excerpts of the sweet, sour, salty, and bitter soundtracks from the\nalbum. Note that an earlier version of the sweet and bitter soundtracks had been used\npreviously in a study by Crisinel et al. (2012). There, the participants rated samples of\nbittersweet toffee on a 7-point bitter-sweet scale while listening to the two sounds.\nTheir results revealed that the participants rated the cinder toffee samples (which came\nfrom the same batch) significantly differently under the two auditory conditions. In the\nsame study, the two soundtracks were pretested in a control experiment in order to ensure\nWang et al. 3\nthat the participants rated the soundtracks differently on a 1 to 9 bitter-sweet scale.\nAs expected, the sweet soundtrack (M \u00bc 6.68, SD \u00bc 1.78) was rated as significantly sweeter\non the bitter-sweet scale than the bitter soundtrack (M \u00bc 2.97, SD \u00bc 1.14).\nJialing Deng and Harlin Sun: Designed a set of sweet, bitter, salty, sour, and umami\nsoundtracks for synesthetic appetizer, part of Deng's Masters of Arts Thesis project\n(June, 2015). The stated aim was to create a narrative environment of a synesthetic world\nby offering augmented eating experiences through crossmodal interactions. The soundtracks\nwere designed to evoke specific tastes, with the goal of helping those who suffer from some\nform of sensory dysfunction and who might not otherwise be able to taste normally.\nEvan Kassof: Designed sounds to match each of the four basic tastes. These sounds were\nused in a citizen science experiment as part of the science museum cravings exhibit in\nLondon, UK. The participants could either access the experiment at the gallery or online,\nvia the science museum's homepage or the cravings exhibition information page (http://\nwww.sciencemuseum.org.uk/visitmuseum/Plan_your_visit/exhibitions/cravings/cravings-exp\neriment.aspx). The sounds were composed from four basis soundtracks that, when combined\nin different ratios, created composite soundtracks that varied in terms of their articulation,\npitch, loudness, and consonance (see Kno\nmuseum experiment, the participants were presented with individual sounds and had to\nmatch them to a taste word (sweet, bitter, sour, salty, umami, or else indicated that they\nwere unsure).\nKlemens Knoeferle and Florian Kau\n\u00a8 ppler: Designed a set of taste soundtracks (sweet, bitter,\nsour, and salty) inspired by Knoeferle et al.'s (2015, Experiment 1) study in which the\nparticipants had to match a number of auditory parameters (attack, discontinuity, pitch,\nroughness, sharpness, and speed) to basic taste words (bitter, sweet, salty, and sour). Based\non these results, low-level properties of a 30-second piece of synthesized music were\nsystematically manipulated in order to create soundtracks matching different tastes\n(Knoeferle et al., 2015, Experiment 2). These soundtracks were then tested online with\nparticipants from the United States and India in a matching task where all four\nsoundtracks and four taste words were presented as a group. On average, the North\nAmerican participants matched 1.75 sounds correctly while the Indian participants matched\n1.38 sounds correctly (as compared with matching one sound correctly by chance).\nImportantly, both groups performed at a level that was significantly better than chance.\nBruno Mesz: A group of musicians were initially asked to improvise on a MIDI keyboard\nbased on the taste words sweet, sour, bitter, and salty (Mesz et al., 2011). Based on those\nimprovisations, different loudness, pitch, duration, and articulation features were extracted\nfor each taste. Those features were then used to design an algorithm that automatically\ngenerated music of specific tastes by combining fragments of classical and popular music\nthat matched the aforementioned auditory features (Mesz et al., 2012). Note here that Mesz\nalso composes his own pieces based on the same principles and uses his compositions for both\nresearch and multisensory performances. Five pieces from Mesz were tested in the present\nstudy (see Table 2 for details on each soundtrack).\nFelipe Reinoso Carvalho: In collaboration with the Institute for Psychoacoustics and\nElectronic Music at the University of Ghent, Reinoso Carvalho designed sweet and bitter\nsoundtracks. The soundtracks were produced by Tim Vets @ IPEM, UGent; coproduced by\nFelipe Reinoso Carvalho, Sander de Keer, and Tomas Serrine; and mastered by Felipe\nReinoso Carvalho at sonictaste.flavours.me (2013).\nThe bitter and sweet soundtracks (along with a neutral soundtrack which was not used in\nthe present study) were used in a recent chocolate-tasting study (see Reinoso Carvalho, Van\nEe, Rychtarikova, Touhafi, Steenhaut, Persoone, Spence, & Leman, 2015). These\nsoundtracks were designed to be congruent with the taste of bitter and sweet\nchocolate, respectively. The soundtracks were inspired by Crisinel and Spence's\nThe sounds were first tested in an online study by 78 participants, who rated the\nsoundtracks as significantly different on a 6-point bitter-sweet scale. During the actual\nstudy, the participants first matched chocolate samples to the soundtracks and then tasted\nthe samples while listening to the soundtracks.\nQian (Janice) Wang: Designed a sour soundtrack for a study on the effect of taste-\ncongruent sounds on taste evaluation, as part of her masters' degree at the MIT Media\nLab (Wang, 2013). The soundtrack was composed in Ableton Live with features of high\npitch, fast tempo, and high dissonance (Mesz et al., 2011). The soundtrack consisted of notes\nplayed by synthetic instruments. The pitch of the notes ranged from C2 to C6. During the\nstudy, the participants listened to bitter, sweet, and sour soundtracks (bitter and sweet\nsoundtracks were the same as used in Crisinel et al., 2012) while rating juice samples in\nterms of their bitterness, sweetness, and sourness.\nTable 1.

Note that the\nitalicized soundtracks were not used in the present study.\nProcedure. The experiment was programmed on the Xperiment experiment-design and hosting\nplatform.1 Before the actual study began, the participants specified their gender, age, country\nof origin, and self-rated their musical expertise levels (the choices were none, amateur,\nintermediate, or advanced). The participants had to listen to all 24 soundtracks in a\nrandom order. After each soundtrack, the participants had to choose which basic taste\n(sweet, sour, bitter, or salty) best matched the sound clip that they had just heard and rate\nhow confident they were in having decoded the correct taste on a scale from 0 to 100. The\npresentation of taste choices was randomized for each trial.\nThe study lasted for approximately 10 minutes, and the participants were paid $1.20 USD\nfor taking part in the study.\nResults\nThe choices for the best-matching taste word were tallied for each soundtrack (see Figure 1\nfor chart and Appendix A for a table listing the precise values). The soundtracks with the\nhighest rate of matching for each taste were as follows: for bitterness, Condiment Junkie\n(42% of participants matched it with bitter, and they were 1.82 times more likely to match it\nwith bitter than with salty, the next most popular choice); for saltiness, Deng (58% of\nparticipants matched it with salty and were 2.76 times more likely to match it with salty\nthan with sour, the next most popular choice); for sourness, Mesz\u00adTango (58% of\nparticipants matched it with sour and were 1.76 times more likely to match it with sour\nthan with bitter, the next most popular choice); and for sweetness, Deng (89% of\nparticipants matched it with sweet and were 14.83 times more likely to match it with sweet\nthan with salty, the next most popular choice). In comparison, had the participants been\nTable 2.

A chi-square test for independence was conducted in order to assess\nwhether different taste words were chosen for different taste soundtracks, tallied over all of\nthe soundtracks that had been generated for each taste. The results indicated that the\np < .0001). The strength of this effect, measured by computing Cramer's V, can be\nclassified as medium (V \u00bc .32).\nA chi-square test of goodness of fit was calculated for each soundtrack to determine which\nof them induced a distribution of taste matches that was significantly different from chance.\nIn fact, out of the 24 soundtracks, only three had nonsignificant preferences in the choice of\ntaste matches (Knoeferle-bitter, Knoeferle-sour, Kassof-sweet). The resulting chi-square\nvalues can be seen in Table 3. Out of the 21 soundtracks with nonrandom distributions of\nresponses, for 14 of them, the most chosen taste word was also the one intended by the\ncomposer (see Figure 1).\nTo check that there was no response bias from the participants (i.e., there were not some\ntaste words that were simply chosen more frequently than others), we computed the total\nFigure 1. Results of participants' soundtrack-taste matching organized by each taste that the soundtracks\nwere designed to evoke in Experiment 1. The chart reveals the distribution of participants' choice of taste\nmatches for each soundtrack, with a total of 100 responses for each soundtrack. Soundtracks with\nnonrandom distributions of taste ratings (i.e., participants are not just matching tastes by chance) are shown\nwith asterisks (p <.05); out of these, the soundtracks where the most chosen taste was also the taste\nintended by the composer are shown by larger asterisks.\nnumber of responses given to each taste word. There were a total of 595 bitter responses, 587\nsalty responses, 606 sour responses, and 612 sweet responses. A chi-square test of goodness of\nfit was calculated and we did not find a distribution that was significantly different from\nthe participants (Erlebacher & Sekuler, 1971).\nOut of 100 participants, 29 identified themselves as having no particular musical\nexpertise, 51 identified themselves as amateurs, 17 identified as intermediates, and 3 as\nadvanced. The participants were assigned to two groups, those with no expertise\n(29 people) and those with some expertise (71 people). For each soundtrack, we\nperformed a chi-square test of independence to determine whether there was an\nassociation between musical expertise and choosing the intended taste word to match\nthe soundtracks (see Appendix B). Did musical expertise contribute to our participants'\nability to match tastes? Out of 24 soundtracks, only Mesz's sweet Makea soundtrack was\nfound to have a different distribution of right/wrong choices depending on the self-\nreported musical expertise of the participant. In particular, a higher percentage of those\nparticipants without musical expertise chose to match the soundtrack with sweetness than\nparticipants with musical expertise.\nThe confidence ratings for each soundtrack are shown in Figure 3. Repeated measures\nanalysis of variance (ANOVA) testing was performed within each group of soundtracks\n(categorized by taste) to determine if there are significant differences in confidence ratings\nbetween soundtracks. We found significant differences in confidence ratings between\nFigure 2. Overall distribution of participants' taste word matches in Experiment 1, averaged over all\nsoundtracks in each taste category.\nWang et al. 9\nTable 3. Results of Chi-Square Test of Good of Fit for Participant's Choice of Taste Word Matches for Each\nSoundtrack in Experiment 1, Grouped by Taste Category.\nFigure 3. Confidence ratings of taste matches for all of the soundtracks, organized by each taste that the\nsoundtracks were designed to evoke in Experiment 1. Confidence ratings were given on a scale from 0 to\n100. For each soundtrack, the average confidence ratings over all taste matches are shown. The error bars\nrepresent the standard error of means.\nMore specifically, for bitter soundtracks, participants were the least confident about their\ntaste word choice for the Deng bitter soundtrack compared with all other bitter soundtracks.\nThe participants were also less confident about the Condiment Junkie bitter soundtrack as\ncompared with the Reinoso Carvalho bitter soundtrack (p < .005 for all comparisons).\nIronically, the two bitter soundtracks that participants were the least confident\nabout--Deng and Condiment Junkie--were also the only soundtracks where bitter was\nchosen by the highest percentage of participants. For salty soundtracks, participants were\nsignificantly more confident about the Deng salty soundtrack than for Mesz and Knoeferle,\nand more confident about the Condiment Junkie soundtrack than for Knoeferle (p < .05 for\nall comparisons). This together with the fact that the Deng salty soundtrack was the most\nmatched with salty validates the effectiveness of the soundtrack in evoking salty tastes. For\nsour soundtracks, participants were significantly more confident about their taste matches for\nthe Mesz\u00adTango soundtrack than for the Kassof, Wang, and Knoeferle soundtracks;\nparticipants were also more confident about the Deng soundtrack as compared with the\nWang and Knoeferle soundtracks; finally, they were more confident about the Condiment\nJunkie soundtrack than the Knoeferle soundtrack (p < .05 for all comparisons). The Mesz\u00ad\nTango soundtrack was also the one that was most frequently matched with sourness,\nfollowed by the Deng soundtrack. For sweet soundtracks, participants were significantly\nmore confident about the Deng soundtrack than all other sweet soundtracks. In addition,\nthey were more confident about the Condiment Junkie soundtrack than all other sweet\nsoundtracks except for Deng's (p < .005 for all comparisons). As in the sour soundtrack\ncase, the Deng soundtrack was also the soundtrack that was matched most with sweetness,\nfollowed by Condiment Junkie's soundtrack. All post-hoc comparisons used Bonferroni\ncorrections.\nIn summary, for the salty, sour, and sweet soundtracks, the soundtracks that were most\nfrequently matched with the tastes that had been intended by the composers were also those\nwhere the participants were most confident about their choices. The only exception was for\nthe bitter soundtracks.\nOn average, the confidence levels for the bitter soundtracks were 57.80, SD \u00bc 17.57, for\nA repeated measures analysis of variance with Huynh-Feldt corrections was performed on\nthe average of the confidence ratings, where significant differences were found between the\ncomparisons with Bonferroni corrections revealed that the confidence ratings for the bitter\nsoundtracks were significantly lower than for all of the other soundtracks (p < .0005 for all\ncomparisons), the confidence ratings for the salty soundtracks were significantly higher than\nfor the bitter soundtracks (p < .0005) but lower than for the sweet (p < .0005) and sour\n(p \u00bc .001) soundtracks, and confidence ratings for sour and sweet soundtracks were not\nsignificantly different from each other, but both were significantly higher than for bitter\nand salty.\nDiscussion\nOverall, based on the taste-matching and confidence rating data, the results of the present\nstudy demonstrate that out of 24 soundtracks (five bitter, five salty, seven sour, and seven\nsweet) the sweet soundtracks most effectively evoked the tastes intended by the composer\n(i.e., sweetness), while the bitter soundtracks were the least effective. Specifically, 56.9% of\nthe participants' responses were correct for sweet soundtracks, and confidence ratings for\nsweet soundtracks were significantly higher (M \u00bc 69.53, SD \u00bc 15.78) than for bitter and\nsalty soundtracks; on the other hand, 31.4% of participants' responses were correct for\nbitter soundtracks, and confidence ratings were significantly lower for bitter soundtracks\n(M \u00bc 57.80, SD \u00bc 17.57) than for all other soundtracks. The reason why our participants\nfound it easiest to match soundtracks to sweetness is possibly because, out of all the\ntastes, people typically like sweetness most (Robin, Rousmans, Dittmar, & Vernet-Maury,\n2003). Unlike the other tastes, sweetness is almost always pleasant, so perhaps there is a\nstraightforward association here for participants with music and soundscapes that they\nfind pleasant, whereas all the other tastes become associated with unpleasant music. In\naddition, it is perhaps worth noting that sweetness is the only taste term that is also used\nin musical notation, that is, dolce, meaning to play in a gentle, sweet style (see Fallows,\n2015). Therefore participants--especially those with musical training--might more readily\nassociate music with sweetness (though, it should be said, we did not observe this in the\npresent study). Furthermore, our finding that sweetness somehow stands out from other\ntastes does not only apply to sound-taste correspondences; in shape-taste matching\nstudies, sweetness is consistently matched to round shapes, whereas all of the other\ntastes are consistently matched to shapes that are more or less angular (Velasco et al.,\nLooking more closely at Table 1, we can try to deduce why certain soundtracks were more\nhighly matched with tastes other than the one that had been intended by the composer.2 For\ninstance, the Reinoso Carvalho bitter soundtrack was the only nonlegato bitter soundtrack\nand it was matched mostly with salty or sweet tastes. Similarly, Mesz\u00adMakea, the only\nnonconsonant sweet soundtrack, was rated as more bitter than sweet.\nGiven the above-chance results of participants in matching soundtracks to their\nintended tastes, we were curious whether emotion played a role in mediating the\nassociations between the soundtracks and tastes, and whether the degree and type\n(pleasantness or arousal) of emotion mediation differed for each basic taste. These\nquestions are addressed in Experiment 2.\nFigure 4. Overall confidence ratings for the various soundtracks in Experiment 1.

Before the actual study began, the participants specified their gender, age, country\nof origin, and self-rated their musical expertise levels (the choices were none, amateur,\nintermediate, or advanced). The participants had to listen to all 24 soundtracks in a\nrandom order. After each soundtrack, the participants had to rate how pleasant and how\nenergizing/exciting they found the soundtrack, each on a scale from 0 to 100. At the end of\nthe test, participants were also asked how pleasant and how energizing/exciting they found\nbitter/salty/sour/sweet-tasting foods.\nThe study lasted for approximately 10 minutes, and the participants were paid $1.20 USD\nfor taking part in the study.\nResults\nThe mean pleasantness and arousal ratings for each soundtrack are shown in Figure 5. The\nmean pleasantness and arousal ratings for foods of a given taste are shown in Figure 6.\nTo analyze the role of pleasantness and arousal in mediating the matching\nbetween soundtracks and a given taste (T), we used the method documented in\ntaste combinations, we calculated the absolute difference between the mean pleasantness\nrating of the soundtrack and the mean pleasantness rating of the given taste. We then\ncalculated the correlation between this soundtrack-taste difference and the % of responses\nthat matched the given taste to the soundtrack. If the pleasantness of a taste T and of a\nsoundtrack S influenced the way people matched T and S, then we would expect the\nmeasure of pleasantness difference between taste T and soundtrack S to be negatively\nrelated to the % responses that match taste T to soundtrack S. The same procedure was\nrepeated for arousal.\nFor pleasantness, Pearson correlation coefficients of \u00c00.85 (p < .0005) were observed for\nsweetness (see Figure 7(a) for plots). This suggests that pleasantness partly mediates the\nsoundtrack-taste correspondence for bitterness and sweetness.\nAs far as arousal was concerned, Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.19 (p \u00bc .39) were\n(p < .0005) for sweetness (see Figure 7(b) for plots). This suggests that arousal partly mediates\nthe soundtrack-taste correspondence for sourness.\nFurthermore, we calculated partial correlation coefficients to assess whether the effects for\npleasantness and arousal are independent. The coefficient for pleasantness remained\nsignificant for the soundtrack-bitter taste (r \u00bc \u00c0.78, p < .0005) and soundtrack-sweet taste\n(r \u00bc \u00c0.72, p < .0005) matches when it was controlled for the effect of arousal. Similarly, the\ncoefficient for arousal (r \u00bc \u00c0.53, p \u00bc .009) remained significant for soundtrack-sour taste\nmatches when the effect of pleasantness was controlled for.\nGeneral Discussion\nThe results of Experiments 1 and 2 demonstrate that participants performed at an above-\nchance level in matching soundtracks to their intended tastes, and that pleasantness and\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 5. Mean pleasantness (a) and arousal (b) rating for each soundtrack, organized by each taste that the\nsoundtracks were designed to evoke in Experiment 2. Pleasantness and arousal are each rated on a scale of\n0 to 100. The error bars represent the standard error of means.\narousal partially mediated this sound-taste association. So then, to summarize, what are the\nfactors governing people's associations of these soundtracks with basic tastes (taste words)?\nFirst and foremost, the studies where many of the soundtracks originated have already\ndemonstrated associations between auditory parameters and tastes (Bronner, Frieler,\n& Spence, 2012, for a review). For instance, bitterness appears to be associated with sounds\ninterestingly, Condiment Junkie's bitter soundtrack, the most effective bitter soundtrack, also\nhad the lowest pitch of all the bitter soundtracks (in fact, it had the lowest pitch of all 24 of\nthe soundtracks). It has also been shown that the sound of the piano is most closely matched\nwith sweetness (Crisinel & Spence, 2010); the Deng sweet soundtrack, which was matched\nwith the word sweet by 89% of participants, makes liberal use of consonant high piano notes\nin the composition.\nIn addition, an important role of emotional mediation was also highlighted. As shown by\nthe results of Experiment 2, pleasantness partly mediates soundtrack-taste matches for\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 6.

A measure of the degree of pleasantness (a) and arousal (b) mediation in soundtrack-taste\nmatching, shown as the relationship between soundtrack-taste discrepancy from Experiment 2 (in terms of\ndifferences in pleasantness/arousal ratings of a given soundtrack-taste pair) and the degree of fit between each\nsoundtrack and a given taste (represented by the % of responses to the soundtrack-taste matching question\nfor a given taste from Experiment 1). The Pearson correlation coefficient is shown on each plot along with a\nlinear regression trend line. Asterisks after the correlation coefficient indicate statistical significance (p <.05).\nsweetness and bitterness, while arousal partly mediates soundtrack-taste matches for\nsourness. Whether intentional or not, the soundtrack designers seem to have captured\nsome emotional aspects of tastes in their soundtracks. For instance, sweet soundtracks\ntend to be pleasant, whereas bitter soundtracks tend to be unpleasant. As for sour\nsoundtracks, they tend to be the most arousing/exciting of all the soundtracks.\nLastly, some of the soundtracks--such as those by Condiment Junkie and Deng--also\nused semantic associations in the form of salt shaker sounds in the salty soundtrack (in fact,\nthe prominent salt shaker sound in the background of Deng's soundtrack might have been\nthe reason why it had the highest matching rate--58%--out of all the salty soundtracks). In\nlight of the emotion mediation results from Experiment 2, it is interesting to note that\nsaltiness is the only taste whose crossmodal correspondence with the soundtracks does not\nappear to be mediated by pleasantness or arousal. Perhaps this is why the use of straight-\nforward semantic associations was so effective for the salty soundtracks. On the other hand,\nrelying on semantic associations obscures crossmodal correspondences that are yet to be\ndiscovered between sounds and saltiness. In the future, it may be useful for researchers\nand designers to focus their energy on a creating a salty soundtrack which does not\ninvolve salt shaker sounds!\nIncidentally, it is interesting to note that for three out of the seven sour soundtracks, bitter\nand sour constituted the majority of the responses (for instance, Mesz\u00adtango had 58\nresponses for sour and 33 responses for bitter, Deng's sour soundtrack had 50 responses\nfor sour and 32 for bitter. See also Figures 1 and 2). Relevant here are previous findings that\npeople tend to confuse sour and bitter more than the other tastes (e.g., Meiselman &\nDzendolet, 1967; O'Mahony, Goldenberg, Stedmon, & Alford, 1979). So, for instance,\nO'Mahony et al. found that when participants were asked to apply taste adjectives (sweet,\nsour, salty, and bitter) to actual taste solutions, the most common error was calling the citric\nacid solution bitter instead of sour. In the context of the present study, the sour soundtracks\nmight have evoked the idea or sensation of sourness, but for those participants who associate\nthe feeling of sourness with the word bitter, they might have chosen to match the soundtracks\nwith bitterness instead of sourness. A follow-up experiment in which the participants are\nasked to match soundtracks with unlabeled taste solutions as opposed to taste words would\nverify whether the sour-bitter confusion contributed to many sour soundtracks being labeled\nas bitter.\nTo be fair, some of the soundtracks--such as those created by Knoeferle and\nKassof--were designed as a set in which some auditory parameters varied over the same\nmelody (while others remained constant). This may not be as effective when participants are\nasked to match the sounds to tastes without having the relevant context (in Knoeferle et al.'s,\n2015, study, e.g., the participants heard all four sounds and were asked to make a one-to-one\nmapping with the four taste words), which might account for why we did not observe a\ndistribution of responses that was significantly different from chance for some of the\nsoundtracks by Knoeferle and Kassof.\nIn addition, a possible limiting factor in the design of the present study was the fact that\nwe only used a 15-second excerpt from each soundtrack. One could argue that, because we\ndid not use the soundtracks in their entirety, the excerpts that were sampled might not have\nbeen the ideal (most informative) sections for matching with the desired tastes. Our decision\nto limit the length of each sound sample was designed to avoid participant fatigue. As all the\nsoundtracks were looping and fairly uniform in texture, it should not make a difference where\nwe sampled the music. To be sure, this is quite different from traditional music where there is\na defined beginning, middle, and end. For taste, music is usually atmospheric and hence has\nmore of a repetitive nature.We thought the first 15 seconds should be sufficient to evoke the\ndesired tastes, especially for the soundtracks used in experiments involving tasting real food\nproducts (soundtracks by Condiment Junkie, Mesz, Reinoso Carvalho, and Wang), where\nparticipants should feel the effect of matched taste as soon as possible.\nLastly, the present results highlighted an example of the role that musical expertise can\nplay in matching music with tastes. For Mesz's sweet Makea piece, those with no musical\nexperience were significantly more likely to match it to sweetness than those with musical\nexperience (for whom bitterness was the most common choice). This was potentially because\nMakea features dissonant chords and high pitched piano instrumentation; as musical novices\ntend to focus on timbre while those with musical experience tend to focus on melody and\nharmony (Wolpert, 1990), perhaps novices matched the high-pitched piano sounds to\nsweetness, while more experienced listeners matched the dissonant chords to bitterness.\nThis highlights the importance for future compositions to have consistent musical features\nacross all levels of music cognition.\nThe recent explosion of studies and performances that have attempted to bring together\nsound and taste demonstrate the level of interest in sonic seasoning, by which sound can be\nused to alter the taste of a dish. This study contributes to the effort by validating which\nsoundtracks that people can reliably match to tastes. Once these correspondences are found,\none can then study any perceptual effects of these soundtracks on the taste of real foodstuffs.\nFrom the soundtracks studied here, the earlier versions of bitter and sweet soundtracks by\nCondiment Junkie have been shown to significantly change people's ratings of toffee on a\nbitter-sweet scale (Crisinel et al., 2012). Meanwhile, the bitter and sweet soundtracks\ngenerated by Reinoso Carvalho were used in a chocolate-tasting study in which the sweet\nsoundtrack significantly changed people's rating of bitter chocolate on a bitter-sweet scale\n(Reinoso Carvalho, Van Ee, Rychtarikova, Touhafi, Steenhaut, Persoone, Spence, & Leman,\n2015). It remains to be seen whether the most effective soundtracks here, such as Mesz' sour\ntango soundtrack or Deng's sweet soundtrack, can lead to measurable taste modifications.\nSurely, in the years to come, the demand for future research into sound-taste\ncorrespondences will only increase, especially in the light of recent studies showing how\ncustomers are willing to pay significantly more for food/drink when it is accompanied by\nmatching multisensory stimuli than without (Michel, Velasco, Gatti, & Spence, 2014;\nReinoso Carvalho, Van Ee, Rychtarikova, Touhafi, Steenhaut, Persoone, & Spence, 2015).\nThe hope is that this type of comparative study will help guide design decisions for\nsoundtracks and experiments as more people explore this intriguing area between sound\nand taste.\n"
