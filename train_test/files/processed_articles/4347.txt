Despite advances in medical\nand surgical therapy over the past several dec-\nades, there has been relatively little reduction in\nesophageal cancer mortality. Extensive research\nhas been performed in colorectal cancer to iden-\ntify exposures that influence outcomes, and this\ninformation has in turn has led to the identifica-\ntion of clinically-relevant tumor subtypes with\npotential therapeutic implications [Chan et al.\nlimited understanding of exposures that influence\nesophageal cancer development, behavior, and\noutcomes.\nThere is substantial data to suggest that aspirin\nhas chemopreventive effects in esophageal can-\ncer, as prediagnosis use is associated with reduced\nincidence and esophageal cancer-specific mortal-\net al. 2012a].

A recent study of esophageal cancer\npatients found that combined pre- and postdiag-\nnosis aspirin as well as postdiagnosis only use was\nassociated with improved overall survival [Van\nStaalduinen et al. 2016]. Studies of prediagnosis\naspirin use alone; however, have had heterogene-\nous results, with some studies showing either no\nimpact on survival or possibly increased mortality\nThese paradoxical effects are difficult to explain,\nbut conceivably could be due to prevention of less\naggressive tumors, thus `selecting' for a worse\nphenotype among those patients who do ulti-\nmately develop cancer.\nIn light of the uncertainties regarding the effects of\naspirin in esophageal cancer, we aimed to investi-\ngate the impact of prediagnosis aspirin use on all-\ncause mortality, cancer-specific mortality, and\nmetastasis-free survival in a prospective cohort of\nesophageal cancer patients.\nMethods\nStudy population\nStarting in 2009 we prospectively enrolled indi-\nviduals with newly diagnosed esophageal cancer\nat Columbia University and Weill Cornell\nMedical Centers, two tertiary care centers in\nNew York, NY, USA. Adults 18 years of age or\nolder with histologically confirmed primary\nesophageal cancer were eligible for enrollment in\nthe study. We excluded from analysis individuals\nin whom the highest degree of esophageal neo-\nplasia was high-grade dysplasia (previously clas-\nsified as esophageal carcinoma in situ), who were\nenrolled at, or greater than, 180 days after diag-\nnosis, or who had a coexisting malignancy\n(excepting nonmelanoma skin cancers) within 3\nyears leading up to the diagnosis and initial\nworkup of esophageal cancer. We obtained writ-\nten informed consent from all study participants,\nincluding permission to obtain all follow-up\nclinical records. At the time of enrollment, we\nadministered a questionnaire pertaining to\ndemographics, medical history, medication use,\nand lifestyle factors (see below), and collected\nblood and urine samples for storage. The institu-\ntional review boards at both Columbia University\nMedical Center and Weill-Cornell Medical\nCollege approved the study protocol.\nBaseline assessment\nWe recorded patient demographics and self-\nreported height and weight, both at enrollment\nand 1 year prior. Using a combination of patient\nself-reporting and manual review of the medical\nrecords, we recorded co-morbidities, specifically\nnoting any history of cardiovascular disease\n(including coronary artery disease, congestive\nheart failure, arrhythmia, peripheral vascular dis-\nease, and cerebrovascular disease). We used the\nCharlson comorbidity index to quantify overall\ncomorbidity burden [Charlson et al. 1987],\nexcluding esophageal cancer from the calculation\nas this was the disease of interest. We also\nrecorded family cancer history, medication use\n(including specific notation of aspirin, non-aspi-\nrin antiplatelet medications (i.e. clopidogrel,\ndipyridamole), statins, proton-pump inhibitors,\nsmoking history (current/former/never and pack-\nyears), and history of alcohol use.\nAspirin exposure\nAs part of the administered baseline question-\nnaire, we asked patients whether they regularly\nused aspirin (`Do you take aspirin regularly?' Yes\nor no'). Among those who were current aspirin\nother) as well as the number of years that the sub-\nject had been taking aspirin prior to enrollment\n(`For how many years have you been taking aspi-\nrin regularly?'). For the purposes of analyses, we\ncategorized duration of aspirin use as follows:\nTumor characteristics\nFor each subject, we recorded the date of diagno-\nsis, tumor histology (adenocarcinoma, squamous\ncell, other) and differentiation (well, moderate,\npoor). If the differentiation straddled two grades,\nthen we assigned the tumor the worse of the two\ngrades (e.g. well-to-moderate was classified as\nmoderate). We used endoscopy reports and surgi-\ncal resection descriptions to assign subsite loca-\ntion (classified as esophagogastric junction, lower\nesophagus, mid-esophagus, or upper esophagus)\nbased on the most proximal extent of tumor. Any\ntumor whose epicenter was located either: (1)\ngreater than 5 cm distal to the esophagogastric\njunction; or (2) within the proximal 5 cm of the\nTherapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 9(6)\nstomach but did not extend to the esophagogastric\njunction or esophagus, was reclassified as a pri-\nmary gastric cancer and excluded from analysis.\nWe assessed tumor stage using a modification of\nthe TNM classification from the 7th edition of the\nAmerican Joint Committee on Cancer [Edge et al.\n2010]. We recorded clinical T stage based on the\nresults of endoscopic ultrasound, as well as patho-\nlogic T stage for those patients who underwent\ncurative resection (esophagectomy or endoscopic\nmucosal resection). For analysis purposes, we\nused the clinical T stage unless the subject had the\ntumor resected without previously receiving any\nchemo- or radiation therapy, in which case we\nassigned the pathologic T stage. We used a simpli-\nfied lymph node assessment, assigning lymph\nnode status as positive if there was clinical or path-\nologic evidence of lymph node involvement prior\nto receiving any chemo- or radiation therapy. We\nrecorded the presence of distant metastases (yes\nor no) as well as the site(s) of metastases. We clas-\nsified subjects with involved celiac, paraesopha-\ngeal, or cervical lymph nodes as lymph node\npositive but not distant metastasis positive [Edge\net al. 2010]. For tumors in which human epider-\nmal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) overex-\npression was assessed, we recorded HER-2 status\nas negative, equivocal, or positive.\nFollow up\nFor each subject, we collected follow-up data with\nregard to treatment received, imaging studies, and\nfollow-up endoscopies. Our primary outcome of\ninterest was all-cause mortality as it relates to aspi-\nrin use. We identified deaths through chart review,\nnext of kin, and the Social Security Death Index,\nand we recorded the date of death. Cause of death\nwas determined by consensus among two of the\ninvestigators who were blinded to aspirin expo-\nsure. We defined death from esophageal cancer as\na death that occurred as a result of tumor burden\n(e.g. failure to thrive due to inoperable obstructive\ndisease or due to extensive metastases), tumor-\nrelated complications (e.g. hemorrhage due to\ntumor), or as a result of any treatments directly\nrelated to esophageal cancer (e.g. post-esophagec-\ntomy respiratory failure).\nStatistical analysis\nWe analyzed categorical variables using Chi-square\ntests, and for continuous variables we used rank\nsum tests for non-normally distributed variables,\nand Student's t tests for normally distributed vari-\nables. For time-to-event analyses for all-cause\nmortality, we used the date of diagnosis as time\nzero. We then calculated time to death for those\nsubjects who died and censored all others at the\nlast time point at which they were known to be\nalive, based on direct contact with the subject or\nthe most recent data in the medical records. For\nesophageal cancer-specific mortality analyses, we\ncensored subjects at the last time point at which\nthey were known to be alive or, for those who died\nfrom other causes, at the date of death. For metas-\ntasis analyses, we only included individuals who\nwere metastasis-free at baseline and for whom at\nleast 6 months of surveillance imaging was availa-\nble. We calculated the time from date of diagnosis\nto the date of the first imaging study to demon-\nstrate metastatic disease. All others were censored\neither at the date of death or at the date of the most\nrecent imaging.\nWe used the log-rank test to compare survival\ncurves in aspirin users and nonusers. We per-\nformed multivariable time-to-event analyses\nusing Cox proportional hazards modeling. We\nfirst performed univariate Cox modeling to assess\nthe unadjusted association between each variable\nand mortality. We subsequently tested each one\nof these terms for interaction with aspirin use; we\nfound no evidence of significant interaction\nbetween aspirin and any of the other variables. In\nthe full model we included aspirin use as well as\nall of the variables associated with survival at p <\n0.20 in the univariate analyses. The variables\nincluded in the full model were the following: age\nat diagnosis, year of diagnosis, race, marital sta-\ntus, use of non-aspirin antiplatelet medications,\nuse of proton-pump inhibitors, smoking history,\ntumor histology, tumor subsite, T stage, N stage,\nM stage, receipt of surgery.

Tsibouris and\ncolleagues performed a retrospective case-control\nstudy to assess the association between nonsteroi-\ndal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), includ-\ning aspirin, and esophageal adenocarcinoma, with\nBarrett's esophagus patients serving as controls\n[Tsibouris et al. 2004]. In secondary analyses, the\nauthors reported no significant unadjusted asso-\nciation between prediagnosis NSAID or aspirin\nuse and overall survival, consistent with our find-\nings. Overall, two prior studies reported no sig-\nnificant association between NSAID use and\nesophageal cancer survival [Trivers et al. 2005;\nThrift et al. 2012]. These studies combined aspi-\nrin and non-aspirin NSAID use in the analyses,\nand defined regular use as at least weekly. The\neffects of aspirin alone as well as dose and dura-\ntion effects were not reported.\nParallels can be drawn with studies of aspirin\nexposure and colorectal cancer outcomes.\nBastiaannet and colleagues conducted a popula-\ntion-based study in the Netherlands, in which\ncolorectal cancer cases were identified using a\nnational cancer registry, and aspirin use was\ndetermined based on a linked prescription record\ndatabase [Bastiaannet et al. 2012]. The authors\nfound significantly higher mortality among\npatients who took aspirin prior to diagnosis for\neffects may not be limited to cancers of the gas-\ntrointestinal tract. In a large population-based\ncohort study of breast cancer patients from\nScotland, prediagnosis aspirin use was associated\nwith significantly increased all-cause (HR 1.62)\nand breast cancer-specific (HR 2.10) mortality\n[Fraser et al. 2014]. Other studies; however, have\nhad mixed results with regard to the effects of\nprediagnosis aspirin and cancer outcomes [Chan\nnot observe an association between prediagnosis\naspirin use and all-cause or cancer-specific mor-\ntality, our cohort was not sufficiently powered to\ndetect small to moderate effects.\nWe were surprised to find a significant increase in\nrisk of metastasis among those exposed to aspirin\nprior to esophageal cancer diagnosis. Multiple\nstudies have demonstrated that aspirin use is asso-\nciated with a reduced incidence of and lower mor-\ntality due to esophageal cancer [Thun et al. 1993;\nlate that aspirin may prevent esophageal cancers\nthat are associated with better outcomes, thus\n`selecting' for more invasive tumors. The cycloox-\nygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme is commonly impli-\ncated in the aspirin\u00adcancer paradigm. Expression\nof COX-2 is increased in both esophageal squa-\nmous cell cancer and adenocarcinoma, and higher\nlevels of COX-2 expression have been associated\nwith more severe disease and worse outcomes\nexerts chemopreventive effects exclusively through\nCOX-2, then one would expect selective preven-\ntion of these more aggressive tumors. However,\nin a randomized clinical trial in patients with\nBarrett's esophagus and dysplasia, COX-2 inhi-\nbition with celecoxib had no impact on expres-\nsion of COX-2 or on other markers associated\nwith neoplastic progression [Heath et al. 2007].\nStudies in colorectal cancer suggest that the effects\nof aspirin may be influenced by the PI3K pathway\nas well as other factors such as BRAF mutation\nstatus, 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase\n(HPGD) expression, and circulating macrophage\nTherapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 9(6)\nWe found that prediagnosis use of non-aspirin\nantiplatelet medications was associated with\nsignificantly increased all-cause mortality, but\nnot with esophageal cancer-specific mortality or\ndevelopment of metastases. Patients taking non-\naspirin antiplatelet medications were significantly\nless likely to undergo surgery and had higher\nCharlson comorbidity scores (data not shown).\nWe therefore suspect that patients who used these\nmedications were at increased risk of death due to\npoorer overall health status rather than a direct\neffect of the medications, and that poorer health\nstatus may not have been fully captured in our\nanalyses.\nStrengths of our study include its prospective\ndesign with aspirin exposure ascertainment at the\nbeginning of the study, thus minimizing recall bias.\nAll enrolled patients completed the administered\nbaseline questionnaire, and we thus had complete\ndata on prediagnosis aspirin use, including dose\nand duration history. We successfully obtained\nvital status information on all patients at the time\nof data analysis. Histologic and staging data were\ncollected for all patients, and we were able to adjust\nfor important confounders in our analyses. We\nwere able to collect comprehensive information on\ncancer treatment and progression, including devel-\nopment of recurrence and metastasis.\nStudy limitations include our lack of information\nabout indications for aspirin use. Additionally, our\nbaseline assessment likely did not capture inter-\nmittent aspirin use. We also did not collect data\non non-aspirin, NSAID medications. We did not\nassess postdiagnosis aspirin use, which may have\nbeneficial effects. Compared with prospectively-\ncollected data, retrospective assessment of postdi-\nagnosis aspirin use would likely have been less\naccurate and subject to potentially significant\nmisclassification bias. We suspect that postdiag-\nnosis aspirin use likely correlated with prediagno-\nsis use, and postdiagnosis use would therefore be\nexpected to bias towards the null for the associa-\ntion between prediagnosis aspirin and metastasis.\nHowever, we cannot rule out the possibility that\nmany patients in the cohort were started on aspi-\nrin only after diagnosis. The size of the study\ncohort was not large, thus limiting our ability to\ndetect smaller, potentially meaningful effects of\naspirin on outcomes. The effects of aspirin may\ndiffer by histological subtype, and the cohort size\nlimited out ability to perform stratified analyses.\nAssessment of cause of death has inherent limita-\ntions; however, we used an accepted definition of\ncancer-specific mortality [Howlader et al. 2010;\nSarfati et al. 2010], and we used two-physician\nconsensus for each case. Lastly, our cohort con-\nsisted of a heterogeneous group of patients who\nwere referred to two large tertiary care centers,\nwhich may restrict the generalizability of our data.\nIn conclusion, in a prospective cohort of patients\nwith esophageal cancer, prediagnosis aspirin use\nwas not associated with all-cause or cancer-specific\nmortality. However, we did find a significantly\nincreased risk of developing metastases. The rea-\nson underlying these observations are unclear,\nalthough we speculate that aspirin may `selec-\ntively' prevent the development of less-invasive\nesophageal cancers. The effects of prediagnosis\naspirin use should be investigated and confirmed\nin separate populations of esophageal cancer\npatients. Future studies should also be aimed at\nassessing the molecular and genetic characteris-\ntics of esophageal tumors in patients with and\nwithout aspirin use prior to diagnosis, as these\nbiological differences may have important prog-\nnostic and therapeutic implications.\n"
