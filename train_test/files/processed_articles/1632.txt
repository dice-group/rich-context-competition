Schechter3\nRates of overweight and obesity are disproportionately high within minority populations. This study examined the\ntrends in provider diagnosis of overweight from 1999 to 2004 and examined whether there were differences in provider\ndiagnosis based on race/ethnicity. We examined data from 4,071 adults with BMI 30 who participated in the National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) (1999\u00ad2004). Provider diagnosis was determined by self-report.\npotential confounders, non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans were less likely to report a provider diagnosis of\noverweight compared to non-Hispanic whites.

We tested multiplicative interaction terms between time and\ndemographic variables and between time and health history variables.\nIndependent correlates of provider diagnosis were determined via\nBased on prior studies (7,8), we included race/ethnicity, survey year,\nobesity class, gender, education, age, health insurance, having a\nroutine health-care provider, number of provider visits, and comorbid\nconditions in the models.

In each survey period, non-Hispanic blacks\nand Mexican Americans were significantly less likely to be\ndiagnosed as overweight compared to non-Hispanic whites\n(P < 0.001) (see Table 1). Women, having health insurance,\ncomorbid illnesses, and higher number of provider visits, were\nassociated with increased provider diagnosis in univariate\nanalyses. Interactions between time and age (P = 0.003), and\nbetween time and health insurance (P = 0.007) were significant\nsuch that the decrease in provider diagnosis was greatest for\nmiddle-aged individuals and for individuals with insurance.\nThere were no significant interactions between time and gender\nAfter controlling for potential confounders, non-Hispanic\nblacks and Mexican Americans remained less likely to be\n\ndiagnosed as overweight when compared to non-Hispanic\nwhites (Table 2). Multivariate odds ratio (OR) for provider\ndiagnosis in non-Hispanic blacks was 0.6 (95% confidence\nCI, 0.4\u00ad1.0).

Non-\nHispanic whites and Mexican Americans did not differ in\nweight-related perceptions.\nDiscussion\nUsing a nationally representative multiethnic sample with\nmeasured height and weight, we have demonstrated \ndecreasing\nNon-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans were less likely\nto be diagnosed compared to non-Hispanic whites \nhighlighting\na potential disparity in obesity management.\nData from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System\n(from 44 to 40%) in obese respondents who reported being\nadvised to lose weight by a health-care professional (8). Our\nfindings indicate a similar trend with provider diagnosis sug-\ngesting that despite increasing obesity prevalence, intervention\nby health-care providers is declining. Of concern are the lower\nrates of diagnosis among non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican\nAmericans. Prior studies have cited time, beliefs that weight\nloss counseling is ineffective, and lack of patient motivation\nas barriers to health-care providers addressing obesity (9,10).\nGiven the complexity of addressing obesity and the influence\nthat culturally related factors such as diet may have on obesity,\nwe question whether patient race/ethnicity is an unrecognized\nbarrier in providers addressing obesity.\nWe additionally found that participants with provider\ndiagnosis were more likely to perceive themselves as overweight\nand preferred to weigh less. Although it may seem unnecessary\nto diagnose a patient as overweight or obese, it is possible that\nadults living in communities with higher obesity prevalence\nmay view obesity as the social norm and not identify it as a\nhealth problem. Indeed, non-Hispanic blacks have the highest\nprevalenceofobesityandweremorelikelytoconsiderthemselves\nthe right weight in comparison to other groups, supporting\nprevious findings by Yancey et al. and Burroughs et al. (11,12).\nThis study has several strengths including a large sample size\nwith a diverse sampling of individuals and the use of measured\nanthropometrics. Our primary outcome of provider diagnosis\nis limited, however, because it is self-reported and subject\nto recall bias and random error. Additionally, the context in\nwhich adults were told about their weight and their weight\nat the time of diagnosis may affect their ability to recall being\ntold. Finally, non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans\nwere more likely to have missing data for BMI and provider\ndiagnosis, and our results may underestimate the problem of\ndecreased provider diagnosis.\nIn conclusion, our study suggests that provider diagnosis of\noverweight among obese individuals has decreased between\nincreasing obesity prevalence during this time. Non-Hispanic\nblacks and Mexican Americans have lower rates of provider\ndiagnosis. Reasons for this disparity and its impact warrant\nfurther investigation.\nDisclosure\nThe authors declared no conflict of interest.\nReferences\n1. Ogden CL, Carroll MD, Curtin LR et al.
