However, this form of classical Arabic has\nseen dwindling interest and the once widely spread and pres-\ntigious style of communication is presently confined to reli-\ngious and some literary texts. Instead, the modern standard\nArabic is now prevalent and dominates the media, although\nits use too is limited to official register and is often learned\nrather than acquired. Nevertheless, the treatment of prenomi-\nnal and postnominal adjectives in both classical and modern\nstandard Arabic remains indistinguishable for the most part.\nAdjectives in Arabic normally follow the nouns they\nmodify. Thus, the following order is commonly found in\nArabic:\nDeterminer Phrase (DP) + Noun Phrase (NP) +\nAdjective Phrase (AP).\nIn (1), both the DP and the NP precede the AP. However,\nit is the intrinsic property of some adjectives to precede the\nNP they modify (Fassi Fehri, 1999), yielding the following\norder:\n(2) DP + AP + NP.\nThis short article expounds on the status of adjectives in\nArabic. It argues that Kremers's (2003) analysis of prenomi-\nnal and postnominal adjectives, which rests on the notion of\ndefiniteness inheritance, presents a challenge for the X-bar\ntheory, is structurally superfluous and non-economic, and\ncan generate ungrammatical structures. The article sets forth\nan alternative minimalist account that posits a single under-\nlying structure for both prenominal and postnominal APs. In\nparticular, it is argued that the definiteness feature weakness\nor strength determines the AP prenominal versus postnomi-\nnal status in the DP.\nAdjectives in Arabic\nPositive Adjectives\nPositive adjectives usually follow the nouns they modify and\nagree with them in number, gender, case, and definiteness.\nConsider the following examples:\n(3) bint-u-n jameel-at-u-n\ngirl-nom-indef pretty-fem-nom-indef\n\"a pretty girl\"\n(4) al-bint-u al-jameel-at-u\ndef-girl-nom def-pretty-fem-nom\n\"the pretty girl\"\n1Imam University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia\nCorresponding Author:\nMahmoud S. Al Mahmoud, Imam University, College of Languages &\nEmail:mssaam@hotmail.com\nPrenominal and Postnominal Adjectives in\nArabic: A Proposed Analysis\nMahmoud S. Al Mahmoud1\n Keywords\nArabic adjectives, syntax, linguistics, theoretical linguistics, foreign languages\n2 SAGE Open\nThe adjective jameel-at-u-n \"pretty\" in (3) and al-jameel-\nat-u \"the pretty\" in (4) both agree with the preceding nouns\nbint-u-n \"a girl\" and al-bint-u \"the girl\" respectively in num-\nber (singular), gender (feminine), case (nominative), and\ndefiniteness.1\nPositive adjectives can, however, occur prenominally in\nwhich case they do not bear any case, gender, number, or\ndefiniteness agreement with the noun they modify:\n(5) (al)-jameel-u al-wajh-i\ndef-pretty-nom def-face-gen\n\"(the one with) the pretty face\"\nThe definite marker on the adjective (al)-jameel-u \"the\npretty\" is optional and is not the result of definiteness agree-\nment with the noun al-wajh-i \"the face.\" The adjective here\nwith the noun forms a construct state (CS; see \"Definiteness\nand the CS\" section) as apparent from the genitive case end-\ning -i on the nominal complement. It should be noted that the\nconstruction in (5) is not very common and is more likely to\nbe found in classical Arabic.\nComparative Adjectives\nComparative adjectives can only occur postnominally, but\nunlike positive adjectives, they do not agree with the noun\npreceding them in gender or number.2 Rather, comparative\nadjectives have to adhere to the form of Af'al Attafdheel3 and\nbe followed by the min \"than\" prepositional phrase:\n(6) al-bint-u (al)-akbar-u min ukht-i-ha\ndef-girl-nom (the)-older-nom than sister-gen-her\n\"the girl (who) is older than her sister\"\n(7) al-awlaad-u (al)-akbar-u min akhawaat-i-him\ndef-boys-nom (the)-older-nom than sisters-gen-their\n\"the boys (who) are older than their sisters\"\nThe comparative adjective (al)-akbar-u \"(the) older\"\nmodifies a singular feminine noun al-bint \"the girl\" in (6)\nand a plural masculine noun al-awlaad-u \"the boys\" in\n(7). Although the adjective has to agree with the noun in\ncase, agreement in number, gender, or definiteness is\nnon-obligatory.\nSuperlative Adjectives\nThe superlative adjective is constructed in Arabic using the\nsingular genderless Af'al form. However, unlike compara-\ntive adjectives, superlatives are unique in Arabic in that they\ncan occur prenominally or postnominally:\n(8) al-walad-u al-akbar-u\ndef-boy-nom def-oldest-nom\n\"the oldest boy (of a known group of boys)\"\n(9) akbar-u walad-i-n\noldest-nom boy-gen-indef\n\"the oldest boy\"\n(10) akbar-u al-awlaad-i\noldest-nom def-boys-gen\n\"the oldest of the boys\"\nIn (8), the superlative adjective al-akbar-u \"the oldest\"\nfollows the noun al-walad-u \"the boy\" and shows agree-\nment in definiteness and case. However, in (9) and (10), the\nsuperlative precedes the nouns walad-i-n \"boy\" and al-\nawlaad-i \"the boys\" but shows neither definiteness nor case\nagreement. In both (9) and (10), the adjective constitutes\nthe head of a CS with the following NP as the genitive com-\nplement. Lipinski (1997) discussed the various types of\nadjectives in Semitic languages (see also Abd Al-Ghani,\ntern Af'al is used for the superlative and may then take the\ndefinite article as in (8) or be defined by a genitive as in (9)\nand (10). In its prenominal use, the superlative adjective\nconveys a greater degree of the attribute compared with\npostnominal superlatives (Kremers, 2003).\nConstruct State\nThere is little discussion in the literature of the adjectival CS.\nMost of the work centers on the nominal CS, mainly in\nothers). A CS is the structure where the noun or the adjective\nis annexed to a genitive DP. Moscati (1964) defined the CS\nas\nthe special form taken by a noun when it is defined by a\nfollowing genitive (or prenominal suffix). The two nouns cannot\nbe separated, though there are certain exceptions to this rule.\nThe CS can be either nominal composed of the head noun\nfollowed by the genitive DP as in (11), or it can be adjectival\nin which case the head adjective is annexed to the genitive\nDP as shown in (12):\nqalam-u al-walad-i\npen-nom def-boy-gen\n\"the boy's pen\"\nAl Mahmoud 3\nakbar-u walad-i-n\noldest-nom boy-gen-indef\n\"the oldest boy\"\nThe NP construction in (11) expresses possessiveness.\nThe CS head qalam-u \"pen\" (the possessed) assigns its com-\nplement the DP al-walad-i \"the boy\" (the possessor) the\ngenitive case -i. The adjectival CS in (12) is very similar to\nthe nominal one structurally but rather expresses the superla-\ntive meaning of the adjective; the adjective akbar-u \"oldest\"\nis the head of the CS, and the noun walad-i-n \"boy\" is the\ngenitive DP complement.\nThe genitive case on the CS DP complement is believed\nto be structural because the genitive DP can assume different\nthematic roles in Arabic. It can be the subject, possessive,\nobject, or agent in a sentence. Lindauer (1995) argued that\nthe German genitive can have numerous thematic roles and\nthus concluded that the DP genitive case is structural.\nif the genitive noun can assume a number of theta roles, then\nthe genitive case is structural.\nDefiniteness and the CS\nTraditionally, grammarians stipulate that the superlative\nform of the adjective be definite (and singular). Moscati\n(1964) noted how the CS in Semitic languages is closely\nconnected with the function of definiteness and indefinite-\nnal, the superlative bears the overt definiteness marker al\n\"the\" as in (8). However, in its (CS) prenominal use, it\nacquires definiteness via annexation to the complement\nregardless of the DP definiteness status as in (9) and (10). In\nother words, the superlative adjective in Arabic has to be\nalways definite either via prefixation of the definiteness arti-\ncle or by constituting the CS head.\nEvidence for the inherent definiteness of CS heads can be\nfound for example in the ungrammaticality of the\nfollowing:\n(13) *al-akbar-u walad-i-n\ndef-oldest-nom boy-gen-indef\n\"the oldest boy\"\n(14) *al-akbar-u al-awlaad-i\ndef-oldest-nom def-boys-gen\n\"the oldest of the boys\"\nThe ungrammaticality of (13) and (14) is due to double\ndefiniteness of the superlative by the definite article al- \"the\"\nand by being the head of the CS. As stated above, because\nprenominal superlatives constitute the first element of a CS,\nthey are inherently definite, and as such, cannot realize the\novert definiteness marker.4\nFurther evidence for definiteness of the CS can be found\nin the use of adjectives modifying nominal heads in\nDP-possessive structures:\n(15) qalam-u al-walad-i al-jadeed-u\npen-nom def-boy-gen def-new-nom\n\"the boy's new pen\"\nThe positive adjective al-jadeed-u \"the new\" in (15)\ndescribes qalam-u \"pen\" and agrees with it in number (sin-\ngular), gender (masculine), definiteness (definite), and case\n(nominative). Such definiteness agreement on the adjective\nargues that the CS head qalam-u \"pen\" is in fact definite.\nKremers's Analysis of Postnominal and\nPrenominal Adjectives\nKremers (2003) proposed an analysis of postnominal and\nprenominal adjectives in Arabic according to which two syn-\ntactically different structures are posited. Consider the fol-\nlowing representation of the positive and superlative\nadjectives stated earlier in (4) and (10), respectively:\n(16) Postnominal adjectives.\nIn (16), the positive adjective al-jameel-at-u \"the pretty\"\nconstitutes the AP that occurs after the noun al-bint-u \"the\ngirl\" and is syntactically adjoined to the right of the number\n(Num) phrase. Whereas (16) is proposed for postnominal\nadjectives, the representation in (17) below is proposed for\nprenominal adjectives:\n(17) Prenominal adjectives.\nD\nD Num\n|\nal-\nthe Num AP\nNum N al-jameel-at-u\n| | the-pretty-fem-nom\n[SG] bint-u\ngirl-nom\nD/Poss\nD/Poss A\n|\n[+DEF] A D\n[+POSS, ] |\nakbar-u D N\noldest-nom | |\nal- awlaad-i\nthe boys-gen\n4 SAGE Open\nIn (17), the superlative adjective akbar-u \"oldest\" pre-\ncedes the DP al-awlaad-i \"the boys.\" On par with the nomi-\nnative and accusative case assignment of the subject and the\nobject by T and by little v, respectively, (Chomsky, 1995) and\ngiven the fact that genitive case assignment is structural, the\ngenitive case is therefore assigned by a functional head,\nnamely, possessive (POSS) (Delsing, 1993; Longobardi,\nassumed that the POSS head is a projection of the feature\nPOSS that has the value [\u00b1POSS] and determines whether\nthe head adjective in the construction has a DP dependent. If\nthe value of POSS is set as [+POSS], then it carries an addi-\ntional set of unvalued  features that need to be valued via an\nAgree relation with the DP complement that is assigned the\ngenitive case:\nThe head Poss has the value [+POSS] in addition to a set of\nunvalued -features. Because the -features are unvalued, Poss\nis active and tries to value these features. It probes its c-command\ndomain for an active match; it finds a match in the complement\nDP which is active because it has an unvalued CASE feature. A\nmatch is established and the unvalued features of both sides are\nThe assumption is that in a CS structure, the feature POSS\nmust always be valued as [+] that requires a set of unvalued\n features to be valued through Agree. The unvalued  fea-\ntures are matched with the unvalued CASE feature (genitive)\nof the DP complement.\nthe head of a CS is unmarked for definiteness. That is, it has\nneither the definite article al- \"the\" nor the indefinite marker\n-n. Instead, the CS head receives its definiteness value via\ndefiniteness inheritance from its complement DP. If the geni-\ntive DP is definite as in (18), then the head noun, namely,\ndarraaj-at-u \"bike\" would be definite and if the DP comple-\nment is indefinite as in (19), then the head noun will be indef-\ninite as can be discerned from the definiteness status of the\nmodifying adjective in the following examples:\n(18) darraaj-at-u al-awlaad-i al-saree-at-u\nbike-fem-nom def-boys-gen def-fast-fem-nom\n\"the boys' fast bike\"\n(19) darraaj-at-u awlaad-i-n saree-at-u\nbike-fem-nom boys-gen-indef fast-fem-nom\n\"boys' fast bike\"\nGiven the agreement in case, definiteness, gender, and\nnumber between postnominal adjectives and the nouns they\nmodify, the definiteness of the adjective saree \"fast\" in (18)\nand its indefiniteness in (19) result from its agreement with\nthe CS head darraaj-at-u \"bike.\" One may be led to believe\nthat agreement with the DP complement awlaad-i-n \"boys\"\nis what determines the adjectival definiteness. This is not the\ncase, however, as the adjective (al)-saree-at-u \"(the) fast\"\nshows case, number as well as gender agreement with the CS\nhead and not with the genitive DP. The adjective has the\nsame nominative -u, not genitive -i, case as the first element\nof the CS darraaj-at-u \"bike\"; is not plural as the DP com-\nplement; and carries the same feminine marker as the CS\nhead, namely, -at.\nFurthermore, Kremers assumes that definiteness inheri-\ntance is a result of Agree. The DEF feature gets valued in the\ncourse of the derivation through Agree. D enters the derivation\nwith a valued or unvalued DEF depending on the value of the\nPOSS feature. In other words, if POSS has the value [-POSS]\n(i.e., when the head noun has no genitive complement), DEF\nenters the derivation already valued as either the definiteness\nmarker al- \"the\" or the indefiniteness marker -n. However, if\nPOSS is valued as [+POSS], DEF is unvalued with neither the\ndefinite article al- nor the indefinite marker -n.\nDiscussion\nturally non-economical as it postulates two markedly differ-\nent syntactic representations for prenominal and postnominal\nAPs. Second, the analysis assumption of a hybrid category\nwith two heads, namely, D/POSS, in the NP is unattractive. It\ncompromises the endocentric property of X-bar phrases that\nrequires \"all phrases be headed by one head\" (Haegeman,\nphrases have heads\" (Hornstein, Nunes, & Grohmann, 2005,\np. 168). Third, the two features of the hybrid category D/\nPOSS inexplicably stand in a converse relationship: When\nPOSS has the value [+POSS], DEF is forced to remain unval-\nued and vice versa. It is not clear what causes this trade-off\nbetween the two features.\nMoreover, the stipulation that [+POSS] renders DEF\nunvalued and must therefore appear without the definite al-\nor indefinite -n marker seems to be contradicted by the kind\nof data mentioned in \"Positive Adjectives\" section (repeated\nhere in (20) for convenience):\n(20) (al)-jameel-u al-wajh-i\ndef-pretty-nom def-face-gen\n\"(the one with) the pretty face\"\nAlthough the definite article on the CS head adjective\n(al)-jameel-u \"(the) pretty\" is optional, (20) still presents a\nproblem for Kremers's (2003) analysis that mandates that\nPOSS be always valued as [\u00b1POSS] whenever in CSs. Such\ncondition requires DEF also to be unvalued (i.e., without the\ndefinite article al- \"the\" or the indefinite marker -n).\nHowever, this is not the case in (20) as the DEF feature is\nindeed valued for definiteness with the definite article al-\nbeing realized, albeit optionally, on the adjective (al)-jameel-\nu \"(the) pretty.\" In other words, positive prenominal\nadjectives pose serious problems for an analysis that assumes\na value mismatch between POSS and DEF.\nAl Mahmoud 5\nFinally, the notion of CS heads acquiring definiteness\nfrom DP complements (definiteness inheritance) seems to be\nundermined by examples involving conjoined adjectives\nsuch as the following:\n(21) ajmal-u bint-i-n wa* (al)-atwal-u\npretties-nom girl-gen-indef and def-tallest-nom\n\"the prettiest and tallest girl\"\nRecall that under definiteness inheritance, the definiteness\nof the CS head is dependent on and acquired by the genitive\nDP complement. CS heads inherit their definiteness value\nfrom the complement to which they are annexed (i.e., if the\nCS complement is definite, the head would be definite and\nvice versa). Thus, in (21), the CS head ajmal-u \"prettiest\" is\npredicted to be indefinite after its DP complement bint-i-n\n\"girl.\" However, note that the conjoined adjective al-atwal-u\n\"the tallest\" in (21) is in fact definite and carries the same\nnominative case ending -u as the CS head adjective ajmal-u\n\"prettiest.\" Clearly al-atwal-u \"the tallest\" cannot be in agree-\nment with the CS complement bint-i-n \"girl\" because the lat-\nter has different case (genitive -i) and gender (feminine)\nendings, and is specified for indefiniteness (-n). Therefore, it\nfollows that the definiteness on the adjective al-atwal-u \"the\ntallest\" in (21) results from agreement with the superlative CS\nhead ajmal-u \"prettiest.\" This indicates that the CS head\nadjective in (21) is indeed definite although overt definiteness\nmorphology is lacking. To sum up, a definiteness inheritance\nanalysis fails to account for the inherent definiteness of CS\nheads as it would incorrectly predict the CS head adjective\najmal-u \"prettiest\" in (21) to be indefinite based on the indefi-\nniteness of the DP complement bint-i-n \"girl.\"\nProposed Analysis\nRather than positing two different structures in the analysis\nof prenominal and postnominal adjectives, an alternative\nanalysis that makes reference to one unified syntactic struc-\nture is proposed. The following tree schema is suggested for\nboth prenominal and postnominal adjectives in Arabic:\nSyntactic representation of prenominal and postnom-\ninal adjectives in Arabic.\nTo explain how postnominal and prenominal adjectives\ncan be derived from the tree diagram in (22), consider the\nfollowing representation for postnominal adjectives:\nSyntactic representation of postnominal adjectives in\nArabic.\nThe NP in (23) raises to the specifier of the agreement\nphrase (AgrP). I assume after Cinque (2005) that what is\ntriggering the NP movement is the need for extended pro-\njections of the NP to be licensed. I also assume, after\nKoizumi (1995) and the argument made therein for the\nexistence of agreement phrases in Minimalist Syntax, that\nthe head category Agr has a maximal projection, namely,\nAgrP. In (23), the AgrP specifier's need for a nominal fea-\nture to be licensed within the DP triggers the movement of\nthe NP to [Spec-Agr].5 I assume further that D has a weak\nDEF (definiteness) feature that does not cause the move-\nment of the AP to the specifier of the DP. However, to\naccount for the elative form of postnominal superlatives, I\nassume that the adjective acquires the elative morphology\nby entering an Agree relation with [Spec-DegP] (Chomsky,\nNow consider the following tree structure for prenominal\nadjectives:\nSyntactic representation of prenominal adjectives in\nArabic.\nDP\nD\n[+DEF] DegP\nDeg\nAgrP\nAgr\nNP\nAP\nNP\nDP\nD\n[+DEF] DegP\nDeg\nAgrP\nAgr\nNP\nAP\nNP\nDP\nD\n[+DEF] DegP\nDeg\nAgrP\nAgr\nNP\nAP\nNP\n6 SAGE Open\nThe tree structure of prenominal adjectives in (24) is iden-\ntical to that of postnominal adjectives in (23); however, con-\ntrary to (23), D is said to have a strong DEF feature in (24)\nthat triggers the movement of the AP to the specifier of the\nDP. The AP undergoes movement first to [Spec-AgrP] then\nto [Spec-DegP] to acquire the elative (or superlative) mor-\nphology6 and ultimately to [Spec-DP] to check the strong\ndefiniteness feature on the determiner. Being in a spec-head\nrelation with the determiner, the adjective acquires definite-\nness and functions as a determiner in the sense that it singles\nout the most salient member of a set. Because the AP move-\nment blocks the movement of the NP to the specifier of the\nagreement phrase, [Spec-AgrP] has to acquire the nominal\nfeature that licenses its presence in the DP some other way.\nFollowing Cinque (2005), I assume that licensing is done\nthrough Merge. That is, the specifier of the agreement phrase\nacquires the nominal feature through an Agree relation with\nthe NP. In this manner, the extended projection of the NP is\nlicensed without resorting to movement of the NP to [Spec-\nAgrP], which would otherwise be impossible due to [Spec-\nAgrP] being already occupied with the AP.\nNote that the analysis proposed in (22), unlike that of\nKremers (2003), does not resort to hybrid maximal projec-\ntions. The maximal phrase is headed by one single head,\nnamely, D, which is a projection of the DP; thus, endocen-\ntricity of phrasal projections in the X-bar theory is respected.\nIn addition, problematic data for the definiteness inheritance\napproach are easily accounted for under this analysis.\nConsider the NP in (21) above where, contra to definiteness\ninheritance, the adjective ajmal-u \"prettiest\" was argued to\nbe definite although its genitive DP complement is not.\nAccording to (22), the adjective ajmal-u \"prettiest\" moves\nfirst to [Spec-AgrP], then to [Spec-DegP] to acquire the ela-\ntive form, and eventually to [Spec-DP] for checking the\nstrong definiteness feature in D.\nFinally, it is more adequate for economy considerations to\npostulate a unified syntactic representation for both to differ-\nent but related APs. The thrust of the argument is that the\nsyntactic representations in (23) and (24) are isomorphic and\nthe distinction between prenominal and postnominal adjec-\ntives is syntactically reduced to the featural strength of the\ndefiniteness feature on the determiner. In other words, the\nchoice of whether an adjective occurs prenominally or post-\nnominally is constrained by the definiteness feature in D. If\nD has a weak definiteness feature, then the AP is postnomi-\nnal, and if D has a strong definiteness feature, then the AP is\nprenominal.\nEvidence for Noun Phrasal Movement\nin Postnominal Adjectives\nTaking into account postnominal adjectives, the analysis pro-\nposed in the previous section assumes the movement of the\nwhole NP to the specifier of the agreement phrase. Evidence\nfor such movement of the NP can be found in constituency\ntests designed to reveal the syntagmaticity and wholeness of\na syntactic unit. For space limitations, I consider here two\ntests of constituency: modification and coordination.\nNoun Complement Modification\nRecall that the underlying representation or the deep struc-\nture (DS) for postnominal adjectives places the modified NP\nto the right of the AP before moving it to the left of the adjec-\ntive at the surface structure (SS) level:\n(25) DS: al-jameel-at-u sayyar-at-u al-walad-i\ndef-pretty-fem-nom car-fem-nom def-boy-gen\nSS: sayyar-at-u al-walad-i al-jameel-at-u\ncar-fem-nom def-boy-gen def-pretty-fem-nom\n\"the boy's beautiful car\"\nIn (25), the CS head sayyar-at-u \"car,\" along with its gen-\nitive complement al-walad-i \"the boy,\" moves to a preadjec-\ntival position. The derivation that takes place in (25) is\ndepicted in the following tree diagram:\n(26) Syntactic representation of postnominal adjectives in\nArabic.\nNow consider the following example where the NP under-\ngoes partial movement:\n(27) *sayyar-at-u al-jameel-at-u al-walad-i\ncar-fem-nom def-pretty-fem-nom def-boy-gen\n\"the boy's beautiful car\"\nThe ill-formedness of (27) stems from the head of the CS\nsayyar-at-u \"car\" moving to the spec of AgrP without its\ngenitive complement al-walad-i \"the boy.\" The example in\n(27) can only be grammatical if the whole NP (the noun\nDP\nD\n[+DEF] DegP\nDeg\nAgrP\nAgr\nNP\nAP\nal-jameel-at-u NP\nsayyar-at-u al-walad-i\nAl Mahmoud 7\nalong with its complement) moves to [Spec-AgrP]. The con-\nstituency of the NP as exemplified here can be taken as evi-\ndence for whole noun phrasal movement rather than head\nmovement to the specifier of the agreement phrase in post-\nnominal adjectives.\nCoordination\nAs mentioned earlier, movement to the spec of the agreement\nphrase targets whole NPs rather than single nominal heads.\nTherefore, in NPs made up of two or more conjoined nouns,\nthe single head along with its coordinated noun is expected\nto undergo movement as in (28):\n(28) DS: al-jameel-at-u al-kilaab-u wa al-?usood-u\ndef-pretty-fem-nom def-dogs-nom and def-lions-nom\nSS: al-kilaab-u wa al-?usood-u al-jameel-at-u\ndef-dogs-nom and def-lions-nom def-pretty-fem-nom\n\"the pretty dogs and lions\"\nNote the full agreement between the two coordinated nouns\nal-kilaab-u \"the dogs\" and al-?usood-u \"the lions\" in case,\nnumber, and definiteness. According to the analysis of post-\nnominal adjectives so far proposed, the NP constituent left-\njoins the specifier of AgrP as shown in the following diagram:\n(29) Syntactic representation of postnominal adjectives in\nArabic.\nIn (29), the entire NP moves to [Spec-AgrP] where it is\nmodified by the adjective al-jameel-at-u \"the pretty.\" Partial\nNP movement, however, would render the structure\nill-formed:\n(30) *al-kilaab-u al-jameel-at-u wa al-?usood-u\ndef-dogs-nom def-pretty-fem-nom and def-lions-nom\n\"the pretty dogs and lions\"\nThe illicitness of (30) is due to raising the noun al-kilaab-\nu \"the dogs\" to [Spec-AgrP] without the coordinated noun\nal-?usood-u \"lions.\" This presents further evidence that the\nmovement involved in (23) cannot be single head movement\nof the noun.\nFinally, the fact that when NP-to-[Spec-AgrP] movement\noccurs, it always affects the determiner al- \"the\" lends more\ncredence to the claim that phrasal rather than single head\nmovement takes place in postnominal adjectives as shown in\nthe ungrammaticality of the following example:\n(31) *bint al-jameel-at-u al-\ngirl def-pretty-fem-nom def-\n\"the pretty girl\"\nThe NP in (31) moves without its determiner al- \"the\" to\nthe specifier of the agreement phrase as illustrated in (32):\n(32) Syntactic representation of postnominal adjectives in\nArabic.\nThe diagnostics above indicate that the noun movement in\npostnominal adjective constructions is indeed a movement of\nthe maximal projection NP rather than a movement of the\nhead N.\nConclusion\nThis article has dealt with postnominal and prenominal\nadjectives in Arabic. It was argued that although Kremers's\n(2003) analysis captures some generalizations of the CS in\nArabic, it is not without its shortcomings. It presents a seri-\nous challenge to one important endocentric tenant of the\nX-bar theory: single head projection of phrases. Furthermore,\nin addition to assuming two distinct syntactic represent\nations for postnominal and prenominal adjectives, the\n\nanalysis fails to account for some new emergent data. In par-\nticular, definite adjective conjunctions with CS heads pose\nsome problems for a definiteness inheritance account.

Strong definiteness of D in prenominal adjec-\ntives triggers AP movement to [Spec-DP], whereas lack of it\nand the need for nominal features within the DP to be\nlicensed in postnominal adjectives trigger NP movement to\n[Spec-AgrP]. Tests of constituency, namely, NP modifica-\ntion and coordination, provide clear evidence for NP-phrasal\nvis-\u00e0-vis single head movement to the specifier of the agree-\nment phrase.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNotes\n1.

One of the\nreviewers noted that a zero-copula reading of the examples\nin (6) and (7) emerges when the comparative adjectives are\nindefinite. In such case, the adjectives would be predicative.\nHowever, a noun phrase (NP) reading is obtained when the\nadjectives are definite and are considered, therefore, attributive.\n3. The form Af'al is used to derive comparative as well as super-\nlative adjectives from positive adjectives in Arabic, for exam-\nple, the comparative/superlative form of the positive adjective\njameel \"pretty\" is ajmal \"prettier/prettiest.\" Af'al can also be\nused to express exclamation in Arabic.\n4. Similarly, in nominal construct states (CS), the head noun can-\nnot bear the definite article as it is already defined by annexa-\ntion to the complement:\n*al-qalam-u al-walad-i\ndef-pen-nom def-boy-gen\n\"the boy's pen\"\n5. Cinque (2005) also maintained that in addition to NP move-\nment, [Spec-AgrP] can acquire the nominal feature by Merge\nthat enters an Agree relation with the NP without movement.\nHe pointed out that whereas some languages use movement\nand others use Agree, still some make use of both.\n6. Where the adjective appears in the non-elative form (i.e., posi-\ntive prenominal adjectives), I assume that Deg has null elative\nmorphology.\nReferences\nAbd Al-Ghani, A. (2000). Annahuw Al-Kafi.
