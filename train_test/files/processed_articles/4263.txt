In clinical\ntreatment, PTH has been proven to have a\nreliable anti-osteoporosis effect; it is cur-\nrently among the first-choice anti-osteo-\nporosis drugs.\nExperimental studies in animals and\nhumans have demonstrated that intermittent\nadministration of low doses of PTH by daily\nsubcutaneous injection effectively stimulates\ncancellous bone formation, whereas con-\ntinuous high-dose application of the hor-\nmone promotes bone resorption. Therefore,\nachieving the desired effect of PTH requires\ncareful dosage, and the optimal regimen has\nnot yet been fully elucidated.2 Whether PTH\ncan promote fracture healing to accelerate\nrehabilitation of patients with fractures has\nbeen widely researched. Previous studies\nhave shown that different doses of PTH\ncan lead to different effects because binding\nof PTH to the PTH receptor activates\ndifferent signaling pathways. It is now clear\nthat the biological role of PTH is mainly\nachieved through activation of three signal-\ning pathways: the cyclic AMP/protein kinase\nA (cAMP/PKA), phospholipase C/protein\nkinase C (PLC/PKC), and non-PLC/PKC\npathways.3\nHowever, the roles of PTH signaling\npathways in bone are complex, and the\nspecific role of the non-PLC/PKC signaling\npathway in bone formation is not well\nunderstood. Its mechanism in bone metab-\nolism requires further study.\nThe aims of this study were to elucidate\nthe effects of PTH on osteoporotic fracture\nhealing via the non-PLC/PKC signaling\npathway and the mechanism of PTH in\npromoting bone formation. This informa-\ntion will help in the development of PTH-\nbased bone-formation drugs with higher\nefficacy and fewer side effects.\nMethods\nExperimental animals\nmice purchased from the Guangzhou\nAnimal Experimental Center were used in\nthis study. The average weight was 19 to\n20 g. All mice were kept in their cages for a\n1-week acclimatization period. An osteo-\nporotic fracture model was then established\nat 13 weeks of age. During the experiment,\nthe animals were handled based on\nGuidance Opinion about Kindly Treating\nAnimals, released by the Ministry of Science\nAnimal model\nThe osteoporosis model was established via\na previously described protocol of bilateral\novariectomy (OVX).4 Penicillin was injected\nintraperitoneally for 3 consecutive days.\nFour weeks after OVX, all mice received\ninhalational anesthesia using isoflurane gas\n(300 mL/min), then underwent an incision\non the left thigh and blunt separation of the\nmuscle and soft tissue to expose the left\nfemur. Intramedullary fixation of the femur\nwas performed by reverse insertion of\na needle (' \u00bc 0.45 mm) from the knee.\nA transverse osteotomy was then made at\nthe distal one-third of the left femur.\nPenicillin was injected intraperitoneally for\n3 consecutive days. Wound healing was\nroutinely monitored.\nPharmaceutical treatment\nAfter the fracture operation, all 96 mice were\nrandomly divided into 6 groups. The follow-\ning pharmaceutical interventions (subcutane-\nous injections) commenced from\npostoperative day 3: the control group\nreceived an equivalent dose of vehicle; the\n400 mg/kg five times a week for 4 consecutive\nweeks; the PTH(1-34) group received\n4 consecutive weeks; the zoledronic acid (ZA)\ngroup received a bolus dose of ZA at 100 mg/\nkg; the PTH(1-28)\u00feZA group received\nfor 4 consecutive weeks plus a bolus dose of\ntimes a week for 4 consecutive weeks plus a\nwas sourced from Bachem (Torrance, CA),\nand the ZA was sourced from Novartis\nPharma AG (Basel, Switzerland).\nSpecimen collection\nThe mice were killed at weeks 2 and 4 after\nfracture, and the left femur was collected for\nanalysis.\nMicro-computed tomography examination\nThe soft tissue and muscles surrounding the\nfractured femurs were carefully peeled, and\nthe needle was removed. These specimens\nhours, then removed and stored in 70%\nethanol at 4C. The fractured femurs were\nscanned using a micro-computed tomog-\nBruker, Billerica, MA) while wrapped in\nmoist tissue and placed in a sample scanning\nholder (Figure 1). The long axis of the femur\nwas aligned with the long axis of the scanner.\nThe scanning system was set to 50 kV, 98 mA,\nand a 9 -mm isotropic voxel size. After the\nscan, the regions showing new callus for-\nmation were selected using micro-CT soft-\nware, and the following parameters were\nquantified: bone mineral density (BMD),\nbone volume (BV), percent bone volume\n(BV/TV), mean trabecular thickness\n(Tb.Th), and structural model index.\nBiomechanical testing\nFollowing micro-CT scanning, the left\nfemur underwent biomechanical testing at\nweeks 2 and 4 after fracture (Figure 2).\nThree-point bending on the fractured cal-\nluses was performed using a commercial\nmaterial testing system ElectroPuls (Instron\nE1000; Instron, Norwood, MA). During the\ntest, the span of the fulcrum was set at 6 mm,\nand the load was applied vertically at the\nmidpoint of the callus at a speed of 2 mm/\nmin. The ultimate bending force was rec-\norded at the callus breakage, and the\nbending rigidity was calculated according\nto the force and displacement curves.\nStatistical analysis\nData are expressed as mean \u00c6 standard\ndeviation. Statistical analyses were per-\nformed using SPSS 20.0 (IBM Corp.,\nFigure 1. Micro-computed tomography findings.\n(a) Coronal and (b) cross section of the left femur.\nFigure 2.

The results are\npresented as the ultimate bending force and\nbending rigidity. As shown in Tables 1\nand 2, the least significant difference test\nwas performed when the two indices were\ndemonstrably different between groups. At\n1.3-fold and 2.2-fold higher bending rigidity\nand 1.2-fold and 2.0-fold higher ultimate\nbending force than the PTH(1-34) and\nZA groups, respectively. Moreover, the\nand 1.3-fold higher bending rigidity and\nultimate bending force than the PTH(1-28)\ngroup, respectively.\nDiscussion\nFracture healing is a complex process, and\nfactors that influence this process include the\nlocal blood supply, age, health status, and\niatrogenic factors.7 The rate of nonunion or\ndelayed union of fractures is about 5% to\nosteoporosis.8 PTH not only regulates the\nformation, transformation, proliferation,\nand apoptosis of osteoblasts but also\nTable 1.

PTH regulates osteoblasts by bind-\ning to PTH receptor I on the cell surface,\nwhich can activate multiple downstream\nsignaling pathways. Moreover, PTH indir-\nectly regulates osteoclasts via its action on\nosteoblasts.9 Jouishomme et al.10 reported\nthat PTH(29-32) activated PKC on the cell\nPTH(1-31) did not have this effect. This\nfinding indicates that the non-PLC/PKC\nsignaling pathway is relevant to the\nPTH(29-32) segment. However, the specific\nsignaling mediator molecules and corres-\nponding biological mechanism of the non-\nPLC/PKC pathway are not well understood.\nMcDonald et al.11 found that bolus ZA\ntreatment (100 mg/kg) increased the hard\ncallus bone mineral content more than\nweekly ZA treatment (five weekly doses of\n20 mg/kg). However, regardless of the\nmethod of delivery, there is no evidence\nthat ZA can promote complete fracture\nhealing. Some studies12,13 have shown that\nZA does not delay endochondral fracture\nrepair and allows hard callus remodeling to\nproceed in the long term, albeit more slowly\nthan normal fracture healing. Moreover,\nsome scholars14 have found that PTH\ncombined with bisphosphonates had no\nsignificant effect on osteoporosis. However,\nthe doses and injection methods in these\nstudies were inconsistent. PTH combined\nwith ZA was recently shown to have stron-\nger effects on fracture healing than either\nmonotherapy after OVX in rats.15 The ZA\nwas administered in a small dose via weekly\ninjections, and PTH was injected three times\na week. According to other studies,5,6 we\nexplored the non-PLC/PKC signaling path-\nway and observed whether it has a stronger\neffect on bone formation by using an opti-\nfive times a week] and ZA (bolus dose of\nDifferent signaling-selective PTH peptide\nanalogs and commonly used bisphospho-\nnates were compared with regard to their\nmechanism of action in bone tissue repair to\nprovide more information on the non-PLC/\nPKC signaling pathway. Bilateral OVX,\nwhich results in a decline in the estrogen\nlevel, is a classic method by which to estab-\nlish osteoporosis in animal models. In the\npast, femoral fracture in experimental ani-\nmals was produced manually, but the oper-\nation was difficult. Since then, specialized\nequipment to establish femoral fractures in\nmice has been designed.16 Despite its high\nrepeatability, the operation is more cumber-\nsome. Furuta et al.17 used a wire saw to\ncreate transverse fractures in the femurs of\nmale mice, and the fractures were directly\nvisualized and fixed with intramedullary\nnails. The fixation strength of osteoporotic\nfractures of middle-aged female mice has yet\nto be verified. In the present study, the\nmethod used to fracture the lower third of\nthe femur under direct visualization and\nfixation with an intramedullary nail in con-\njunction with OVX has the characteristics of\nreliable fixation, technical simplicity, and\nrepeatability.\nMicro-CT examination and biomechan-\nical testing were performed on the callus to\nstudy the fracture healing in each experi-\nmental group. PTH(1-34) treatment had a\nstronger effect on BMD, BV, BV/TV, and\nTb.Th than PTH(1-28) treatment. This indi-\ncates that while PTH(1-28) activates the\ncAMP/PKA and PLC/PKC signaling path-\nways, PTH(1-34) further increases the\nnumber of bony trabeculae and strength of\nthe callus and promotes healing of osteo-\nporotic fractures through its action on the\nnon-PLC/PKC signaling pathway. Among\nall treatment groups, PTH(1-34)\u00feZA treat-\nment had the strongest effect on BMD,\nBV/TV, Tb.Th, ultimate bending force, and\nbending rigidity. In addition, at week 2, the\nPTH(1-34)\u00feZA and ZA groups showed a\nhigher BV than those groups treated with a\nsingle drug. At week 4, the ZA group\ndemonstrated the highest BV, which could\nbe explained by the antiresorptive properties\nof ZA. The PTH(1-34)\u00feZA group also\ndemonstrated a high BV, but it was lower\nthan that in the ZA group, indicating that\nPTH can promote cancellous bone forma-\ntion in the bone callus and remodeling of\ntrabecular bone. At week 2, PTH(1-34)\u00feZA\nand ZA treatment had a similar effect on\nBV/TV; however, the PTH(1-34)\u00feZA group\nhad the highest BV/TV at week 4.\nPTH(1-34)\u00feZA treatment produced the\nmost bone mass, indicating that ZA may\ninhibit bone resorption while PTH promotes\nbone formation. The combination of the two\ndrugs not only decreases the loss of the bone\nmass of the callus but can also generate new\nbone tissue. Consequently, this group\nshowed the maximum increase in bone\nmass. The PTH(1-34)\u00feZA group had the\ngreatest callus intensity, which may be\ndependent on increasing the amount of\ncallus to improve early callus strength,\nwhile the later callus strength is mainly\ndependent on callus remodeling. All findings\nof this study show that PTH(1-34) combined\nwith ZA can increase the callus quantity,\nenhance callus remodeling, improve bone\nmorphology, and promote bone growth via\nmultiple signaling pathways in an osteopor-\notic fracture animal model.\nIn summary, PTH can promote fracture\nhealing after OVX in mice by increasing the\namount of callus and remodeling the callus\nvia a non-PLC/PKC signaling pathway and\nincreasing the callus hardness. Moreover,\nPTH combined with ZA had synergistic\neffects on fracture healing after OVX in\nmice. However, the observation time of this\nstudy was only 4 weeks; a longer period of\nobservation is required to more fully under-\nstand the effects of monotherapy or com-\nbined therapy. In addition, these results\nwere obtained in mice and may not translate\nfully to the human body. Clinical trials are\nrequired to prove the effectiveness of this\ntreatment in patients. Additional cellular or\nmolecular studies may cast more light on the\nmechanism behind these therapies. PTH\ncombined with ZA has a synergistic effect\non fracture healing in mice. Future studies\nshould be performed to explore different\ndoses and different injection frequencies of\nPTH and ZA for fracture healing.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis study was supported by grants from\nZhejiang Medical and Health Science Research\nReferences\n1.
