It is said\nto be a result of acquiring sexual preferences via exposure to the parental phenotype during\na sensitive period in early childhood. Since the first works of Konrad Lorenz, sexual\nimprinting has been examined experimentally in fish (e.g., Schielzeth, Burger, Bolund, and\nForstmeier, 2008), birds (e.g., ten Cate, Verzijden, and Etman, 2006), and mammals (e.g.,\nKendrick, Hinton, and Atkins, 1999; Penn and Potts, 1998). It has been found that, during\npair formation, adults tend to prefer sexual partners of the species that gave them parental\ncare when young rather than other adults of their own species (Immelmann, Prove, Lassek,\nSexual imprinting\nLikewise, studies using novel or artificially exaggerated ornaments in birds have\nfound positive sexual imprinting on these ornaments (ten Cate and Bateson, 1989). Early\nresearch seemed to show that imprinted preferences are life-long, however more recent\nstudies suggest that sexual preferences in cross-fostered individuals might depend upon the\nfirst courtship with a mate from the same or cross-fostered species, and that the process of\nimprinting might have two stages that influence the magnitude of long-lasting effects: (1)\nacquisition and (2) consolidation (Bischof and Clayton, 1991; Oetting, Prove, and Bischof.,\n1995). Thus, sexual imprinting might not be fixed during adolescence, as previously\nthought, and may change as a result of social experiences (as found by Oetting and Bischof,\nAlthough positive sexual imprinting affects species recognition and preference\nbetween color morphs or novel ornaments, these have been tested as categorical variables;\nto our knowledge there is only one cross-fostering experiment on non-human animals that\ntested the role of sexual imprinting on continuously variable traits. Schielzeth et al. (2008)\ncross-fostered female zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, and subsequently gave them a\nchoice between unfamiliar mates, one of which was a genetic son of their foster parents.\nThey found that cross-fostered females demonstrated neither significant avoidance nor\npreference towards the genetic sons of their foster parents. Additionally, it has been shown\nin birds that a conspecific sexual preference can occur in individuals that have not\nsocialized with any other individual. This result would suggest that animals have an innate\nconspecific sexual preference and sexual imprinting merely refines this bias in natural\nAlthough previous research suggests that positive sexual imprinting plays an\nimportant role in species recognition (Hansen, Johannessen, and Slagvold, 2007) and in\npreferences for novel ornaments in zebra finches (Witte and Caspers, 2006), it remains\npossible that it does not affect mating preferences for traits that display the whole span of\npossible variations in natural circumstances (Schielzeth et al., 2008). Thus, more studies\ntesting the role of sexual imprinting on continuously variable traits within the same species\nare needed before any generalization can be made.\nIn humans, there is some evidence for positive assortative mating according to\nparental hair and eye color (Laeng, Mathisen, and Johnsen, 2007; Little, Penton-Voak,\nBurt, and Perret, 2003; Wilson and Barrett, 1987), which simply means that the hair and\neye colors of sexual partners correlate positively with the hair and eye colors of parents.\nMoreover, it has been reported that the effect of the opposite-sex parent is significantly\nstronger than the same-sex parent in predicting both the hair and eye colors of actual\npartners (Little et al., 2003). Little and colleagues suggested that their study supported an\n\"imprinting-like\" (analogous to \"social learning\") effect on mate choice. Two groups of\nresearchers have found slight correlations between the ages of women's actual partners and\ntheir parents (Wilson and Barrett, 1987; Zei, Astofli, and Jayaker, 1981) and this effect is\nsupported by a study using computer-graphic digitally modified faces (Perrett et al., 2002).\nAlthough the methods used for these studies were robust, the association between parental\nhair and eye color and human mate choice may have alternative explanations, such as\nheritable preferences, that would affect results of the positive sexual imprinting (see\nSexual imprinting\nBereczkei, Gyuris, Koves, and Bernath (2002) tested the positive sexual imprinting\nhypothesis on facial traits in humans by measuring the resemblance of married women to\ntheir mothers-in-law. Participants were reported to have correctly matched the wives to\ntheir mothers-in-law at a significantly higher rate than expected by chance. Bereczkei\ncontinued his research in the same field by studying the sexual preferences of married\nwomen who were adopted as children. He asked judges to rank the similarity between\npictures of a woman's adoptive father, her husband and three randomly chosen controls.\nThe facial photos of husbands and adoptive fathers resembled each other significantly more\nthan expected by chance (Bereczkei, Gyuris, and Weisfeld, 2004). Another study correlated\nfacial measurements taken from people from the same family, and then compared that data\nwith measurements taken from randomly selected individuals from the same population\n(Bereczkei, Hegedus, and Hajnal, 2009). It was concluded that the study supported the\npositive sexual imprinting hypothesis. However, after the external expert appointed by the\njournal identified errors in the data analysis (which could have altered the results of the\nresearch), the authors decided to retract the article (see Bereczkei et al., 2009; retraction\nand publishers note); hence its results should not be taken into further discussion.\nTo test the role of sexual imprinting on actual mate preferences, Wiszewska,\nPawlowski, and Boothroyd (2007) compared the facial traits of men to the preferences for\nmale facial traits of their daughters. They found that women who had a good relationship\nwith their fathers as children showed a stronger preference in other men for some of the\ncharacteristics of their father's face, compared with women who had negative or neutral\nrelationships with their fathers. However, again, the results of this experiment may be\ndifficult to interpret because the authors excluded the majority of average stimuli faces\n(Wiszewska et al., 2007, p. 249). The effects of sexual imprinting on facial preferences\nthat were found in this study were thus only present in a subset of the original data, which\nwas not randomly selected; as average faces were excluded, only more extreme\ncharacteristics of faces were presented. A broader data set may have altered the results and\nconclusions of the paper, especially if women preferred faces close to the population mean.\nBased on this paper, then, it seems that there is evidence for positive sexual imprinting for\nhuman facial traits in faces that deviate from the average, but it is unclear to what extent\nthis is generalizable. What is more, Zietsch and colleagues, in a recent study on twins,\nfound no effects of sexual imprinting in any of their examined traits and near zero genetic\ninfluence on mate choice (Zietsch, Verweij, Heath, and Martin, 2011). It was suggested that\npartner similarity was based rather on assortative mating.\nThe aim of this study was to test the sexual imprinting hypothesis by measuring the\nfacial resemblance between participants' spouse's faces and that of their opposite-sex\nparents. We based our methods of the retracted study of Bereczkei et al. (2009), on a data\nset of long-term white Caucasian couples currently living in southern Poland. We also used\nthis data set to investigate the impact of the quality of child-parent interactions on positive\nsexual imprinting. Following other authors (e.g., Schmitt et al., 2012), we see value in\nreplication and re-evaluation of hypotheses with different methods and in different\npopulations.\nSexual imprinting\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nThe participants were from 70 families. From each family, we used three people: a\nparticipant, the participant's partner, and the participant's opposite-sex parent. In total, we\nparticipants had to have been in a relationship with their current partner for at least six\nmonths (M = 3.78 years, SD = 3 years). The mean age of male participants was 25 years\nand 33 males. Individuals were unsystematically chosen, all white, Caucasian, heterosexual\ncouples. We recruited them using several methods: Internet forums, leaving invitations to\ntake part in the research on the information desks in the universities, asking people\nopportunistically encountered on the university campus in Cracow, and, finally, by asking\nparticipants to forward the information about the research to their acquaintances.\nTwo digital photographs were taken of the face of each participant, spouse and\nparent: one from the front and one of the profile. Photos were taken with different cameras,\nbut with the same settings (i.e., same size of the picture, time of exposure, and brightness\ncontrol). It was not necessary to take all profile pictures from the same side, because\nreference points were marked to the profile line. Each participant was asked to stand still\nand to look straight ahead or directly into the camera, which was placed at eye level. In\ntotal, 420 pictures were taken by five different photographers who were instructed how to\ntake the pictures and followed similar procedures. All pictures were standardized in size\nand resolution. Pictures of partners and family members were usually taken on different\noccasions and in different places, hence there was no consistency between them in terms of\ntheir physical context (e.g., lighting, color, and shading).\nFacial Similarity Ratings\nFor each participant, we presented a tableau of five color, frontal, facial\nphotographs in a similar manner as used in previous papers (e.g., Bereczkei et al., 2002,\n2004). They displayed on the left-hand side the picture of the participant's opposite-sex\nparent identified by a number. On the right-hand side there were four photographs of three\nindividuals of the partner's age taken from the control group and a photograph of the actual\npartner of the participant. The control group was created by gathering individuals from\nsouthern Poland, unsystematically asking students on the campus. They did not know the\nindividuals approached. The age of control group individuals, 18 to 30 years old, was in the\nsame range as the age of the participants. Each of the four pictures of potential partners was\nmarked with a single letter from A to D. We chose to present four pictures from the\nparticipant's control age group. This is because a parent is a fixed stimulus presented\nthroughout the individual's sensitive phases as an individual grows, whilst a partner is\nhypothesized to have been chosen based upon that stimulus. Opportunistically chosen\njudges from southern Poland (i.e., other students from the campus and people encountered\nin the street; n = 120), were asked to rate the faces coded A to D on their similarity to the\nnumbered, opposite-sex parent's face on a scale from 1 (not at all similar) to 10 (extremely\nsimilar) (see Bereczkei et al., 2009). The tableaux of five pictures were shown to each\nSexual imprinting\njudge in a randomized order. Judges neither knew, nor recognized, the presented\nindividuals.\nQuestionnaires\nEach participant completed two questionnaires in the Polish language. The first\nquestionnaire was a shortened form of the EMBU questionnaire \u00ad Swedish acronym for\n\"My memories of upbringing.\" It measures relations between the parent and child during\nthe first ten years of his/her life (Arrindell et al., 1999), which is a standardized method for\nthe assessment of an adult's perception of their parents' rearing behavior. This\nquestionnaire was translated independently by two Polish native speakers with CAE\nCambridge certification, and their versions were consistent. The second questionnaire\nconsisted of general questions about demographics and personal information about the\nparticipant and his/her parents and partner.\nData Analyses\nSince Kolmogorov\u00adSmirnov analysis revealed that the data on ratings of facial\nresemblance were not normally distributed we transformed the data by taking the log (base\n10), after which the data were normally distributed. Thus, we used parametric tests to\ncompare facial resemblance between opposite sex parent with mate and controls. Since\nEMBU scores were not normally distributed and we were not able to transform it, we used\nnon-parametric correlations between EMBU scores and facial resemblances. All statistical\ntests were performed with PASW Statistics 18 software and all tests were two-tailed.\nResults\nMothers were subjectively rated to be more similar to their daughters-in-law than\ncontrols on average, t(30) = 2.84, p = 0.008, whereas fathers were not more similar to their\nthat men tend to pair with women who resemble their mother more likely than we would\nexpect by chance, but women do not tend to pair with men who resemble their father. We\nalso found that mothers were rated as more similar to their daughters-in-law than fathers\nare significantly better at seeing resemblance in mothers/daughters-in-law than in\nfathers/sons-in-law.\nTo test if the quality of the relationship between a participant and his/her parent had\nany effect on the facial resemblance between the spouse of participant and their parent, we\ntested whether facial similarity rating correlated with EMBU scores. The EMBU\nquestionnaire provided us with three main factors influencing parent-child relations:\nrejection, emotional warmth, and over-protection. However, none of the factors in either\nsex correlated with facial similarity ratings (see Table 1).\nSexual imprinting\nFigure 1. Log10 transformed facial resemblance (\u00b1SE) assessed by randomly chosen raters\n(of both sexes) between the partner, control and participant's opposite-sex parent\nTable 1. Correlations between facial similarity ratings and EMBU scores\nPartner-father (n = 37) Partner-mother (n = 33)\nrs\np rs\np\nDiscussion\nOur study was designed to test for facial resemblances between spouses and\nopposite-sex parents as predicted by the sexual imprinting hypothesis. We found that men\ntend to pair more often with women that facially resemble their mothers than expected by\nchance. In contrast, judges were not able to see facial similarity between fathers and their\nSexual imprinting\nsons-in-law. Interestingly, the quality of the relationship between a participant and their\nparent was not associated with facial resemblance between the spouse of the participant and\ntheir parent. Thus, our results support only partly those of Bereczkei et al. (2002, 2004)\nwho found that good parental relationships were associated with higher similarity ratings\nbetween opposite-sex parents and spouses (for possible explanations of lack of correlation,\nFurthermore, our study is not consistent with the mathematical model of Tramm\nand Servedio (2008), who found that imprinting may depend on the level of engagement of\nthe parent in rearing offspring (i.e., if the mother is the one providing care, maternal\nimprinting should be stronger, and vice versa for the father). It is possible that the pattern\nwe found is the result of positive sexual imprinting on facial traits of the opposite-sex\nparent, but since the relationship with the mother did not predict the facial resemblance\nbetween mother and spouse, our study suggests that facial resemblance might also be the\nresult of heritable components for facial preferences. Unfortunately, in our study we were\nnot able to rule out genetic effects or preferences for self-similarity because we did not\ninclude adoptive families. However, if the facial similarity between fathers and their sons-\nin-law were so weak that raters were not able to see it, it is unlikely that in adopted families\nthe similarity would be any higher. In addition, our study does not support the finding of\nWiszewska et al. (2007) who claimed that women who had a good relationship with their\nfather as a child showed a stronger preference in other men for some characteristics of their\nfather's face. It does not support either the results of Watkins et al. (2011), who found a\npositive correlation between women's preferences for self-resemblance in opposite-sex (but\nnot same-sex) individuals and reported emotional closeness to their fathers. Watkins et al.\n(2011) examined reported emotional closeness based on only 1 item; however, this should\nbe sufficient to depict parental support (e.g., Hall, 2009) and hence should not be the cause\nof our discrepant results. The cause of divergence might lay in the fact that Watkins et al.\n(2011) correlated parental support with self-similarity, not with the actual partner \u00ad\nopposite sex parent similarity (which as variables are not unequivocal).\nAnother factor that might explain the differences in sexual imprinting between\nmales and females is the Westermarck effect. It is known that individuals do feel sexual\naversion and tend not to bond with other individuals that were raised in the same peer or\nfamily group (e.g., Bixler, 1981; Blouin and Blouin, 1988). It has been also shown that this\naversion is stronger for women than men (Walter and Buyske, 2003). In females, weaker\nsexual attraction towards co-socialized individuals would support Trivers' (1972) parental\ninvestment theory, which states that females should show greater inbreeding avoidance\nthan males because of the greater costs they suffer as a consequence of inbreeding\ndepression. As inbreeding-avoidance would be a factor that suppresses possible sexual\nimprinting for parental traits, then the weaker inbreeding avoidance is, the stronger the\nsexual imprinting. In other words, in females showing strong inbreeding avoidance, sexual\nimprinting should be less visible, as it is suppressed more. Our data support this hypothesis.\nIt is noteworthy that among all animals, including humans, the actual state of\npairing does not always reflect the exact preferences of an individual. Competition to form\npartnerships and many other socio-cultural constraints may prevent individuals from\npairing with people that bear their preferred traits (Burley, 1983). In previous research, the\nSexual imprinting\ntraits of partners were interpreted as identical with individual preferences, although it might\nbe that partners are the most preferred individuals from those that are available. Thus, it\nmight be misleading to base a template of preferences on the actual mate of the individual,\nwhilst ignoring the constraints of human mate choice. Additionally, as individuals within a\nculture often have, on average, a common perception of what is physically attractive in the\nopposite-sex, attractiveness may signal good genes (see Roberts et al., 2005; Rantala et al.,\n2012), and a perception of certain facial qualities as attractive may have evolved as an\nadaptation to the problem of choosing a high-quality mate (Buss and Schmitt, 1993).\nConsequently, as attaining a high quality mate should enhance our fitness, it may be\nadaptive to mate with high quality mates for all females, despite their own self-perception,\nactual social position, etc. Hence the preferences of the majority of females would be\nsimilar, with little apparent variance, regardless of parental features. This also might\nexplain why we did not find facial similarity between fathers and their sons-in-law.\nIn this study we retested Bereczkei et al.'s (2009) hypothesis with a more robust\nmethodology. Although their study was criticized, our results suggest that there may indeed\nbe facial similarities between spouses and their opposite-sex parents in men, as Bereczkei\net al. (2009) suggested. However, the effects we observed were substantially weaker than\nthe ones reported in previous studies. Furthermore, we did not find any support for previous\nfindings that good parental relationships were associated with higher similarity ratings\nbetween opposite-sex parents and spouses. Since we did not use adoptive families in our\nexperiment, we were not able to say whether the pattern was a result of heritable\npreferences or sexual imprinting.\n"
