Data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, a longitudinal\nstudy of a nationally representative sample of adolescents in grades 7\u00ad12 in the United States who were sur-\nweight within this population. Outcomes of pregnancies were reported by participants in the fourth wave of data\ncollection (when participants were 24\u00ad32 years of age); data were compared between female participants who\nreported a first singleton livebirth at less than 20 years of age (n = 1,101) and those who were 20 years of age or\nolder (n = 2,846). Multivariable modeling was used to model outcomes; predictors included demographic charac-\nteristics and maternal health and behavior. Among black adolescents, low parental educational levels and older\nage at pregnancy were associated with higher birth weight, whereas low parental educational levels and being\non birth control when one got pregnant were associated with higher gestational age. In nonblack adolescents,\nlower body mass index was associated with lower birth weight, whereas being unmarried was associated with\nlower gestational age.

Giving birth\nduring adolescence (before age 20 years) is associated with\na number of pregnancy complications, including infant\ndeath (2\u00ad4), stillbirth (due largely to preterm labor and de-\nlivery) (5), congenital anomalies (6), preterm birth (PTB),\nand low birth weight (LBW) (7). For instance, in 2005,\n13.3% of births to girls less than 15 years of age resulted in\noffspring with LBW. The rate for 15\u00ad19-year-old girls was\n10.0%, whereas the overall rate was for all women was\n8.2%. Teens less than 15 years of age are at a particularly\nhigh risk, although such pregnancies are fairly rare (8\u00ad10).\nSeveral risk factors for LBW/PTB are known for adults,\nincluding black race, smoking, history of LBW/PTB, low\nweight gain, short maternal stature (11), low socioeconomic\nstatus, low weight, and nulliparity (12, 13). Teenage\nmothers are more likely to be unmarried, to smoke, to gain\na low amount of weight during pregnancy (14), and to get\ninadequate prenatal care, which has been strongly associat-\ned with preterm birth in this group (15). However, only a\nfew studies have addressed the risk factors specifically\nwithin the teenage age group. In 1 clinic-based study,\nunderweight teens were at higher risk of PTB and having\noffspring with LBW (16). In a study using national birth\ncertificate data, infant mortality among teenagers was asso-\nciated with not reporting the father on the birth certificate,\nas well as with alcohol use, tobacco use, and low weight\ngain (10). A study of Australian teenage mothers using data\nfrom a national surveillance system found that smoking\nwas associated with increased rates of small-for-gestational-\nage offspring, very PTB, and stillbirth, as was residence in\na very remote area. Nulliparity was associated with an\nincreased risk of small-for-gestational-age offspring but a\nreduced risk of very PTB (17).

For instance, in adults,\nmarried women have better birth outcomes than do single\nwomen (19). However, single adolescents may be more\nlikely to live with their parents, and the resources of this\narrangement might outweigh any support provided by mar-\nriage. Married or cohabiting teenage parents who do not\nlive with both parents are less likely to graduate high\nschool than are those who live with 2 parents (20). One\nstudy found that exposure to violence was associated with\nPTB in adolescents but not adults (21). There is also evi-\ndence that racial disparities are not as large within teenage\npopulations (22). Although young black teenagers are at\nparticularly high risk of LBW (17.2% among girls <15\nyears of age) compared with national averages, there also\nhas been some research indicating that black adolescents\nactually have better birth outcomes than do older black\nThe purpose of the present article is to further explore\nthe behavioral and demographic determinants of birth out-\ncomes among adolescents in a nationally representative\nsample and to explore whether predictors of birth outcomes\namong teens are different from those of women who first\ngive birth later in life. This analysis will add to past Ameri-\ncan studies by utilizing a nationally representative sample\nthat is more diverse than prior clinic-based studies but in-\ncludes more personal-level information than birth certificate\nstudies; by examining multiple risk factors simultaneously;\nand by focusing on both PTB and LBW.

The first stage\nof sampling included a stratified random sample of all\npublic and private high schools in the United States. A\nmiddle school with students who largely attended the se-\nlected high school was also recruited from each participat-\ning community. In-school surveys were attempted with all\nstudents attending participating schools; a total of 90,118\nwere completed. In the second wave I sampling stage, a\nsample of adolescents was drawn for in-depth in-home in-\nterviews, consisting of a random core sample plus selected\nspecial oversamples; a total of 20,745 interviews were con-\nducted at this stage. At wave II, most students (except wave\nI seniors) were eligible for re-interview; at waves III and\nIV, all respondents to the wave I in-home interview were\neligible for re-interview. A total of 15,701 interviews were\nconducted at wave IV (80.3% response rate). Sampling\nweights were adjusted for both unequal probabilities of\nselection into the original sample and for loss to follow-up.\nThe major goal of the analysis was to compare women\nwho gave birth before 20 years of age with women who\ngave birth when they were 20 years of age or older. We\napplied a number of inclusion criteria for our analyses.\nFirst, we limited it to females who participated in wave IV,\nas that was the only wave by which all respondents had\ncompleted their teenage years and thus had complete data\nTable 1.

Second, we limited our analysis to partici-\npants with valid sampling weights to make generalizations\nto the wider US population. Third, we limited our study to\nwomen whose first births occurred after wave I to ensure\nthe temporal ordering of predictors and outcomes. Fourth,\nwe limited analyses to first singleton livebirths.

If they indicated they had given birth,\nthey were asked, \"How much did the baby weigh at birth?\"\n\"Was [baby's name] born before or after [his/her] due\ndate?\" and then \"How many weeks or days early/late was\n[baby's name] born?\" This was subtracted from 40 weeks\nto calculate gestational age. In this analysis, both continu-\nous forms and indicators for LBW (<2,500 g) and PTB\n(before 37 weeks of gestation) were included.\nSociodemographic characteristics that have been related\nto birth outcomes among adults or adolescents in the prior\nliterature (race, ethnicity, family structure, and parental edu-\ncational level) were included in analyses. All such variables\nwere measured at wave I. Age at wave I was included as a\ncontinuous variable to control for possible cohort differenc-\nes. Self-reported race was specified as black/nonblack and\nethnicity as Hispanic/not Hispanic. Family structure (2 bio-\nlogical parents vs. other) is an important predictor for many\nadolescent health and social outcomes (26\u00ad28). Parental ed-\nucational level (higher of either co-residential mother or\nfather: less than high school diploma, high school diploma/\ngeneral equivalency diploma, some postsecondary, or\ncollege degree) was included as an indicator of family-\nof-origin socioeconomic status.\nA number of behavioral and maternal health variables\nwere also included based on their prior associations with\nadverse birth outcomes in either adult or adolescent popula-\ntions. Prepregnancy maternal health variables included gra-\nvidity (1 vs. >1) and prepregnancy body mass index (BMI;\nweight (kg)/height (m)2) at wave I (underweight, normal\nweight, overweight, or obese) and at the wave of data col-\nlection before pregnancy. Pregnancy-specific behaviors\nmeasured at wave IV included smoking during pregnancy\n(yes or no), prenatal care use (yes or no), and trimester of\nprenatal care initiation (first trimester, second trimester, or\nthird trimester or no prenatal care). Year of offspring's birth\nfor possible period effects, given the large decline in teen\nLastly, whether the participant was taking birth control\nwhen she became pregnant (yes or no) was used as a proxy\nfor intent to get pregnant.\nStatistical analyses\nAll analyses were conducted in SAS, version 9.2 (SAS\nInstitute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina) using survey proce-\ndures, which apply population weights and adjust standard\nerrors for nonindependence between observations due to\nschool-based sampling. Analyses began with descriptive\nstatistics of the analysis sample's demographic characteris-\ntics by first birth timing (teenaged mother vs. not). Next,\nbivariate relations between demographic and behavioral\nvariables and birth outcomes (LBW, PTB, birth weight,\nand gestational age) were examined using 2 analyses or\nanalysis of variance/t tests, depending on the specification\nof the predictor and outcome variables. Additionally, differ-\nences between teen and adult mothers in these associations\nwere tested using interactions between birth timing\nTable 2.

In the final step, all predictors were\nentered into multivariable models to test their relation with\nthe outcome, adjusted for other variables. Because of the\nknown differences in the context of adolescent pregnancy\namong racial groups (29), interactions with race (black vs.\nnonblack) were examined using product terms, and models\nare presented stratified on this variable. Variables were\nomitted from these models when cell sizes were less than 5.\nThe Add Health Study was approved by the institutional\nreview board of the University of North Carolina at Chapel\nHill, and this analysis was approved by the institutional\nreview board of Tulane University.\nRESULTS\nCharacteristics of the 2 groups are provided in Table 1.\nWomen who gave birth as adolescents (ages 13\u00ad19 years)\nwere more likely to be black or Hispanic, to live in a house-\nhold without 2 biological parents present, to have parents\nwith less than a high school education, to have an unem-\nployed parent, and to be unmarried than were women who\ngave birth at older ages (ages 20\u00ad33 years). They were\npregnant. They were not, however, at particularly high risk\nof PTB or LBW, and the mean gestational age was actually\na bit longer in the adolescents.\nIn bivariate analyses of high-risk outcomes (Table 2),\npredictors of LBW in the older women included higher\nbaseline BMI, black race, being primigravid, and not re-\nceiving prenatal care. In the adolescents, black race, being\nprimigravid, and not receiving prenatal care were associated\nwith a higher risk of having had a baby with a LBW. Pre-\ndictors of PTB (Table 3) among the adult mothers included\nHispanic ethnicity, not receiving prenatal care, and initiat-\ning prenatal care after the first trimester, whereas for ado-\nlescent mothers, being married or cohabiting were the only\ncharacteristics associated with PTB. Results were similar\nfor continuous outcomes for adults; mean birth weight was\nlower in adult smokers than nonsmokers (3.19 kg vs. 3.29 kg,\nYounger teen mothers (age at birth <18 years) were also\ncompared with a somewhat older adult group of mothers (age\nat birth 24 years); bivariate analyses were limited to contin-\nuous outcomes because fewer births occurred among this\nyounger group of teen mothers (n = 335) (Web Table 1, avail-\nable at http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/). Somewhat different pat-\nterns were seen with BMI in the 2 groups. For the younger\nwomen, the heaviest babies and longest gestations were in the\nobese group, whereas in the older women, the heaviest babies\nwere on average in the underweight group (P for interaction =\nIn multivariable analysis (Appendix Table 1), among\nblack adolescents, low parental educational levels and\nhigher maternal age at pregnancy were associated with\nhigher birth weight, whereas higher baseline age was asso-\nciated with lower birth weight. Lower parental educational\nlevels and being on birth control when one got pregnant\nwere associated with higher gestational age (Appendix\nTable 2). In nonblack adolescents, lower BMI was associat-\ned with lower birth weight (Appendix Table 1), whereas\nbeing unmarried was associated with lower gestational age\n(Appendix Table 2).\nDISCUSSION\nAlthough we found that girls who became pregnant as\nadolescents were more likely to fit a high-risk profile than\nwere girls who gave birth later, PTB and LBW were\nequally distributed between adolescent and young adult\nmothers. Whether adolescent mothers are truly at high risk\nfor these complications has been a matter of some debate\n(2, 30\u00ad32). Adolescents with good access to health care\noften do not show a higher risk of complications (33, 34).\nTable 3.

The na-\ntional proportion of adolescents who became pregnant\nbased in schools; this underrepresents girls who dropped\nout of school before wave I, a phenomenon that may be\nmore likely among adolescents in the older age cohorts\nwho become pregnant (29). It is also possible that\nthere was selective attrition before wave IV because of\nchildbearing, although weights constructed by Add Health\nresearchers are meant to address differential loss to\nfollow-up.\nA few risk factors for lower birth weight and gestational\nage among adolescents were identified. Being married was\nassociated with lower gestational age, consistent with re-\nsearch suggesting that adolescent parents may benefit from\nliving with their family of origin (20). There was also a\ntendency for gestational age to be longer in girls who were\nusing contraception when they conceived, especially\namong black women; higher risk with intended adolescent\npregnancy has been previously reported (36). In bivariate\nanalysis, rates of complications were higher in adolescents\nwho did not get prenatal care, but this association was not\nas strong as in the older women.\nBirth weight was lower in black adolescents than in white\nadolescents, but the disparity in LBW was similar to that\nin adolescents), and absolute levels of LBW were lower in\nblack teenagers than in older women, though not substan-\ntially (19, 22, 29). The interaction analysis suggested that the\nimpact of the social context on birth outcomes might differ\nby ethnic group, as the relation with parental educational\nlevel and maternal age differed by racial group and associa-\ntions were not necessarily in the expected directions. Greater\nbirth weight by age at pregnancy within black adolescent\nmothers is consistent with past studies, which have found\nyoung black adolescent mothers to be at particular increased\nrisk of adverse birth outcomes compared with their older\npeers (29). However, lower birth weight among black\nadolescent mothers with greater baseline age suggests possi-\nble cohort differences, such that earlier cohorts of these\nmothers were at increased risk of negative outcomes.\nStrengths of the study include the large, representative\nsample and the prospective data collection, but some limita-\ntions need to be mentioned. The present study relies on\nself-reporting of birth outcomes (birth weight and gesta-\ntional age). Although mothers' reports of these outcomes\nare generally reliable (37\u00ad40) and these pregnancies had\noccurred fairly recently, this is a potential source of error.\nStudies have found that maternal age does not affect the\naccuracy of reporting (39, 41), although ethnicity and soci-\noeconomic status have been found to predict errors (42).\nAlso, gestational age is ideally assessed with early ultra-\nsound (43), especially for teenagers, who have more irregu-\nlar menstrual cycles (44). For those who did not have such\nan ultrasound, the reported gestational age may have been\ninaccurate, even if the last menstrual period-based calcula-\ntion is correctly reported. A large proportion of the study\npopulation was also using contraception when they con-\nceived, which might have further delayed pregnancy recog-\nnition or contributed to errors in calculating last menstrual\nperiod. Given the multiple sources of error, the direction of\nbias is probably unpredictable. Also, the number of cases\nwas relatively small, leading to imprecise estimates and\nlimited power to examine interactions. We did not have any\ninformation on complications of pregnancy or whether a\nPTB was due to preterm labor, rupture of membranes, or\nmedical indication.\nThe results of this analysis suggest that teenagers as a\nwhole are not at increased risk of adverse birth outcomes\ncompared with adult mothers despite their overall riskier\nbehavioral and demographic profile. Further, the conven-\ntional risk factors, such as smoking and marital status, may\nnot exert as strong effects on adolescent mothers as on\nadults. Access to prenatal care and support from family\nmembers appear to be potential intervention targets to\nimprove birth outcomes among young mothers. Future re-\nsearch will address the social and environmental context of\nteen pregnancies and their relation with birth outcomes.\nTable 4.
