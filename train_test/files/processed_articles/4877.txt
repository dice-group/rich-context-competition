(Hilda Doolittle) and Virginia Woolf were\nintrigued by the potentialities of intersubjectivity--shared\nmeaning, thought, and experience--that media technologies\nin the first half of the 20th century made possible on a far\nwider scale than previously imagined or experienced. For\nH.D., the images produced by the projector bridge differ-\nences created by conventional language, culture, and nation-\nality, thus creating intersubjectivity. Her poems, \"Projector\"\nand \"Projector II (Chang),\" celebrate the reassertion of light\nas deity and speak to the importance of the machine--the\nprojector--that makes this reification possible. By contrast,\nVirginia Woolf privileges the aural in much of her writings,\nillustrating in many of her early novels that sound creates the\nintersubjective moment. Woolf's last novel, Between the\nActs, is a sustained interrogation of the role of media technol-\nogy in creating and maintaining intersubjectivity, for there\nexists within intersubjectivity a challenge to the individual's\nability to know and to act with agency. Both authors under-\nstood the dangers associated when the intersubjective\nmoment is generated by and dependent upon a machine.\nObeying mechanical directives alienates one from one of the\ndefining characteristics of the human: agency, or the ability\nto act. When Woolf (1970) writes in Between the Acts, \"They\nwere neither one thing nor the other; neither Victorians nor\nthemselves. They were suspended without being, in limbo\"\n(p. 178), she is considering the audience's sense of them-\nselves. However, she is also illustrating that those whose\nposition as the subject is challenged exist in a sort of limbo--\nthey are neither their own autonomous self nor are they truly\nmerged with the group. Intersubjectivity might unify, it\nmight bridge differences, but it also challenges the autonomy\nof the self, ultimately destabilizing the privileged position of\nthe subject even as it fails to unify members of the group.\nThe media technologies of the early 20th century seemed\nuniquely qualified to pose such a challenge.\nBy the first decade of the 20th century, both sound and\nimage technologies had pervaded mainstream culture. Media\ntechnologies such as the gramophone and the film projectors\nserved as reminders that objects have a life of their own.1 In\nhis essay \"Thing Theory,\" Bill Brown (2001) notes \"the sud-\ndenness with which things seem to assert their presence and\npower: you cut your finger on a sheet of paper, you trip over\nsome toy, you get bopped on the head by a nut,\" and argues\nthat these moments \"are occasions of contingency--the\nchance interruption--that disclose a physicality of things\"\n(pp. 3-4). Thus, objects are more than simply the results of\nproduction and consumption. They exert a presence in their\nenvironment, reminding the humans who live with them that\ntheir space is shared--sometimes pleasantly and sometimes\nwith the disruption that arises from the perversity of inani-\nmate objects. Thus, media technologies played a role in pre-\nparing the modernist writer to consider the potential agency\nof objects. The gramophone, for example, not only played\n1Connors State College, Warner, OK, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nTabatha Hibbs, Division of Communication and Fine Arts, Connors State\nEmail: tabatha.hibbs@connorsstate.edu\n\"They Were Neither One Thing Nor the\nOther\": Media Technology's Challenge to\nthe Subject\nTabatha Hibbs1\n Keywords\nVirginia Woolf, H.D., media technology, intersubjectivity\n2 SAGE Open\nback the human voices recorded on wax cylinders but also\nrecorded environmental white noise, sounds that the human\near typically disregarded as meaningless. Furthermore, the\ngramophone was quite capable of generating its own sounds:\nhissing and scratching when the needle stuck, and \"chuffing\"\nwhen the needle came to the end of the phonograph disc.2\nSuch sounds permeated the human body, dissolving ego\nboundaries. Likewise, the projector produced images that\ncould be read across cultural and socioeconomic boundaries.\nAs both the physical boundary of the body and the social\nboundaries of class and nation dissolved, new possibilities\nfor intersubjectivity emerged.\nH.D. and Woolf are not alone in their interest in media\ntechnologies. Such technologies as the phonograph, the\nprinting press, the typewriter, and the player piano appear in\nother works as varied as Arthur Conan Doyle's \"The Voice of\nSilence,\" James Joyce's \"Aeolus\" from Ulysses, Bram\nStoker's Dracula, and Joseph Conrad's The Secret Agent.\nHowever, while each of these objects exercise some agency\nin the texts, none challenge the position of the subject in the\nway that H.D.'s projector and Woolf's gramophone do.\nFurthermore, because H.D. privileges the visual in contrast\nto Woolf's interrogation of the aural, examining the\n\"Projector\" poems in tandem with Between the Acts allows\nthe opportunity to consider the influence of early media tech-\nnologies on the senses in producing intersubjectivity and, as\na result, challenging the autonomy of the self.\nProjected Gods and Intersubjectivity in\nH.D.'s Writing\nAs an Imagist, H.D. privileged sight as \"fresh, accurate\naccess to the exterior world\" (Morris, 2003, p. 96). The tenets\nof Imagism have been attributed to Ezra Pound (1913), who\ndeclared that \"[a]n `image' is that which presents an intel-\nlectual and emotional complex in an instant of time\" (p.\n200). However, the movement saw its earliest beginnings in\nthe poetry group which had T. E. Hulme at its center. It is\nfrom his thinking about poetry that the aesthetics of Imagism\ndeveloped, and Hulme (1955) privileges vision in his consid-\neration of the role of language in poetry, asserting, \"A man\ncannot write without seeing at the same time a visual signifi-\ncation before his eyes. It is this image which precedes the\nwriting and makes it firm\" (p. 79). This assertion suggests\nthat the physical eye, as much as the mind's eye, plays a vital\nrole in the creation of the image and, ultimately, the poem,\nplacing the instigating image--that image that is the starting\npoint of the poem--squarely in the realm of physical vision\nrather than mental imagery.\nHulme's (1955) privileging of vision arises from his con-\ntention that language is a \"[l]arge clumsy instrument\" that\n\"does not naturally come with meaning\" (pp. 83-84). While\nlanguage might not be sufficient to communicate adequately\nthe writer's ideas, vision and the images perceived by vision\nmight very well be universal. Morris (2003) notes that for the\nImagist, \"[s]ight is the acid bath that dissolves the sticky\nsludge of rhetoric . . . [and] connects us directly . . . with the\nthings of this world\" (p. 96). By contrast to those who privi-\nleged the aural, Morris observes that the Imagists found \"in\nvision a release from a shared system of signs into a spontane-\nous, intuitive, unmediated apprehension of essences\" (p. 97).\nYet, a poet works in language rather than in the visual as does\na painter or a photographer; thus, Hulme demands, \"Each\nword must be an image seen, not a counter\" (p. 79). This ten-\nsion, then, between sight and language, between the concrete\nthing and the abstract word(s) used to represent that thing is\nthe foundation of the Imagist aesthetic. Within this aesthetic,\ntoo, lies the desire, if unspoken, for the universal experience\nof the emotion, of the moment, and of the thing that lies at the\npoem's center, and that is the poem's raison d'\u00eatre.\nFor H.D., the image rather than sound provided a means\nto bridge differences created by the flawed and arbitrary\nmediation of language and to create intersubjectivity.3\nAlthough H.D. is best known for her poetry and prose, her\nforay into film reveals her belief that a universal language,\nthe dissolution of differences, and the intersubjectivity that\nmight result were dependent upon the image: not the lan-\nguage-dependent image created in poetry but the moving\nimage created by light projected through film. She declares\nfilm \"[a] perfect medium [that] has at last been granted us\"\ndevice for portraying the miraculous\" (H.D., 1998c, p.\nalso the medium by which \"there would be no more misun-\nderstandings . . . of nations\" (p. 117). As Laura Marcus\n(1998) observes, \"The dream of recapturing a prelapsarian,\nuniversal, pictographic language fed directly into early film\naesthetics\" (p. 103). How better to find commonality in com-\nmunication than through pictures, for while language might\nact as a barrier to shared understanding, H.D. believed\nimages would evoke a universal response from viewers.4\nThe search for a universal language is centuries old.\nUmberto Eco dates the desire for what he terms a perfect\nlanguage to the second century A.D. when syncretism gave\nrise to the belief in a universal World Soul. Because \"[e]ach\nlanguage organizes the way in which we talk or think about\nreality in its own particular way\" (Eco, 1995, p. 21), a uni-\nversal language could overcome different cultural and lin-\nguistic perceptions of reality, thus making it possible for\nthose of differing nations to converse without the risk of mis-\nunderstanding. Such linguistic commonality would promote\nthe sharing not only of ideas but also of consciousness. In\n1887, Ludwik Lejzer Zamenhof created Esperanto, an artifi-\ncial language that he hoped would become the universal lan-\nguage that had thus far eluded humankind, but despite its\nrelative ease of acquisition, Esperanto did not become the\nsingle tongue of humankind. Instead, 19th-century visual\ntechnologies such as photography and the cinema promised\nto bridge cultural and linguistic differences more quickly and\neffectively than any written or spoken language ever could.\nMichael North (2005) observes that, initially, photography\nwas thought to be the new \"Rosetta Stone, decoding every\nwritten language by reference to a visual language common\nto all\" (p. 5). The same observation can be made about the\nhopes for and beliefs about early cinema. Just as \"photogra-\nphy was strongly associated from its very beginnings with\nhieroglyphs\" (North, 2005, p. 5), so was \"the image of (silent)\nfilm\" seen \"as a form of hieroglyphics, a thinking in pictures\npictures, which were more universal than language, might\ncreate a shared experience and common understanding in\naudiences from varying cultural and language backgrounds.\nB\u00e9la Bal\u00e1zs noted, \"[O]n the motion picture screens all over\nthe world we currently witness the development of the first\ninternational language: that of facial expression and physical\nthen could form the \"halo of visual connotations\" (Eco, 1995,\np. 149) denied to the writer of poetry and prose, whose work\nwould be understood only by those who shared the same lan-\nguage experiences as the writer.\nThus, if images could overcome differences, then con-\nsciousness might be shared with others. This was a hope\nwidely expressed during the first decades of the 20th century.\nH.D. shared this enthusiasm and belief that unity might be\ncreated by the projected image, and she wrote ecstatically\nabout this, as well as about both light and film in the early\nissues of Close Up. In a June 1927 letter to Viola Jordan,\nH.D. writes, \"I feel [film] is the living art, that thing that\nWILL count but that is in danger now from commnerical\nHer belief in film and \"its ability to transform the human\nmentaries that she wrote for Close Up during its first two\nyears of circulation. Not surprisingly, the film aesthetics she\nespoused were similar to those that shaped much of her\npoetry. In a series of interlinking essays called \"The Cinema\nand the Classics,\" the poet gave voice to her ideas of film\naesthetics and her hopes of the role that cinema might fill.6\nH.D. saw film as an opportunity to create art that could cross\nnational boundaries and believed that her essays could help\nshape this art and help it resist the commercial pressures of\nHollywood.\nIn addition to establishing her theory of film aesthetics,\nH.D. also used her contributions to Close Up as a venue for\nher celebration of light. In the essay \"The Cinema and the\nClassics I: Restraint,\" she declared, \"[t]he fascinating ques-\ntion of light alone could occupy one forever\" (H.D., 1998b,\np. 111). Her adoration of light winds through her contribu-\ntions to Close Up, and light takes on mystical properties in\nthe two \"Projector\" poems she published in the July and\nOctober issues of the magazine. However, while her writing\ncelebrates light and film, the projector is the ultimate source\nof the light that H.D. deifies in her writing. The idea of pro-\njection pervades H.D.'s poetry. Projection is, as Morris\nthe thrust that bridges two worlds. It is the movement across a\nborderline: between the mind and the wall, between the brain\nand the page . . . between me and you . . . across dimensions of\ntime and space. (p. 96)\nThus, the medium of film provided the poet a way to approach\nher \"broader concerns with language and symbol, psycho-\nanalysis, mysticism and spiritualism, classicism, and the cel-\nebration of women's beauty and power\" (Marcus, 1998, p.\n98). Within the walls of the cinema, projected light reached\nacross the dark to cast images upon a screen, images that\npromised in many ways to overcome social and national dif-\nferences, and to become a universal language that might\nunite viewers when phonetic language failed. Projected light\nis made possible by the projector, a fact celebrated in the\npoems \"Projector\" and \"Projector II.\"\nEven as the projector's dynamism and agency made pos-\nsible light's reassumption of power in modern culture, it is\nthe light that most enamored H.D, who situated it as a reani-\nmation of Apollo. Laura Marcus (1998) reads the two\nProjector poems as \"invocations to Apollo, upon whom\n[H.D.] bestows the godhead of cinema\" (p. 98). In H.D.'s\nwriting, light is both the tool of the artist and an entity to be\ndeified. In writing of Kenneth Macpherson's work on the\nfilm Borderline, H.D. notes that \"those lights have been\narranged, re-arranged deliberately focussed [sic]. Those who\nknow anything, even of the technique of mere photography,\nrealise that Macpherson sculpts literally with light\" (H.D.,\nto be manipulated; it \"is pliant, is malleable. Light is our\nfriend and our god. Let us be worthy of it\" (H.D., 1998c, p.\n112). The notion that light is both a friend and a god is clearly\narticulated in \"Projector\" where the "
