Sanchirico \u00b7 Michael Batz\n\u00a9 Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2009\n Introduction\nU.S. households account for approximately 20% of the energy consumed in the\nUnited States, spending an average of almost $4,000 per household per year on\nelectricity, fuel oil, natural gas, and gasoline.1 Meanwhile, policymakers confronting\nissues of energy security, rising energy prices, and environmental protection are\nfocusing on market-based policies, such as energy taxes or cap and trade programs\nthat raise energy prices. For example, an analysis of cap and trade bills before the\n110th Congress found prices of between $20 and $50 per ton of carbon dioxide (CO2\n)\nA priori there is no reason to believe that the incidence of market-based policies\nin the energy sector will be uniform across the United States, as there are significant\nvariations in climate, electricity generation, and historical fuel use. Yet, no fine-\nscale publicly available spatial data on household energy use exist, because published\nmicrodata has the geographic identifiers removed to protect respondents' confiden-\ntiality. In this paper, thanks to an agreement with the Bureau of Labor Statistics\ngiving us access to such geographic identifiers, we quantify the geographic variation\nin energy use and the potential regional impacts of policies that could raise energy\nprices--particularly those policies related to carbon emissions.\nUnderstanding the spatial incidence and distribution of energy policies is impor-\ntant for at least two reasons. First, if variation among regions is significantly smaller\nthan variation within regions, then regional concerns need not necessarily figure into\npolicy design. But if it is large, as we hypothesize, quantifying this variation can\nhelp policymakers design a more equitable program, presumably with more aid and\nassistance focused on those regions facing greater impacts. Regions that drive more,\nthat are more dependent on coal-based electricity, or that require air conditioning\nall will face relatively higher burdens under a market-based climate policy. This\nis particularly relevant for the political economy of carbon regulation: government\nrepresentation is organized by geography, and members of Congress will want to\nknow whether their constituents will bear an \"unfair\" burden (Borenstein 2007;\nSecond, with an increasing emphasis on local initiatives, understanding the re-\ngional incidence of energy price increases can help with the analysis of state and\nregional initiatives such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative in the Northeast\n2Note that market-based policies that place a price on CO2 emissions can both raise prices paid by\nfossil energy consumers and depress prices received by fossil energy producers. The aforementioned\nstudy shows that typically the bulk of the price effect falls on consumers.\nDespite the policy relevance of regional variation in household impacts of energy\nprice increases, there has been little effort to quantify regional patterns of household\nenergy use. State-level data on residential energy use are available from the Energy\nInformation Administration (EIA, www.eia.doe.gov) for more recent periods, but\nresidential end-use is not disaggregated by fuel type, which is an important dimension\nwhen investigating the incidence of carbon taxes. Furthermore, states are not neces-\nsarily the most interesting geographic unit. States like California, New York, and\nFlorida have potentially important variation within their borders and dense urban\nareas often times cross state lines (e.g., Metropolitan New York, Washington, Kansas\nCity, and Philadelphia).\nUnder confidentiality agreements with the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we use non-\npublicly available data from the U.S. Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES) over the\nperiod 1984\u00ad2000 to estimate geographic variation in household use of electricity,\nfuel oil, natural gas, and gasoline, as well as the associated emissions of carbon.\nAlthough the non-parametric kernel \"smoother\" we employ can create estimates at\nan arbitrary spatial scale across the United States and improve our understanding of\nthe interactions between economic activity and geography, we focus on county-level\nestimates of annual household use of the four main fuels. But one can easily use the\nsame technique for other levels of detail, such as congressional districts and postal\nzip codes. In addition to mapping fuel use, we estimate the associated incidence of a\n$10 per ton carbon dioxide tax as a means to illustrate the potential value in having\nfiner-scale carbon dioxide emissions data to design carbon policies.\nWe note that our primary effort is not to estimate the behavioral response to\nmarket-based mitigation policies, which have been well-studied elsewhere in the\nliterature--including the responsiveness of the residential sector to higher energy\nprices (Dahl 1993).3 Instead, we wish to demonstrate the regional variation in\nburden. Behavioral responses, estimated in the aggregate, can then be layered on\ntop of the regional variation, a calculation we do in the text.\nEven with the CES data pooled over 15 years, the geographic coverage is not\ncomplete enough to compute county or even sub-state averages at a sufficiently fine\nlevel of detail. Out of more than 3,100 counties in the lower 48 states, the CES\nhas sampled households in only 666 over this period; these 666 sample counties are\ndisproportionately in urban areas, leaving large areas of the rural west unsampled.\nIf data were available at the level of detail for every region (county) that interests\nus, we could simply use those averages. Alternatively, we could construct simple\nregressions of energy use on household demographic variables and dummy-variables\nfor each region, again allowing us to pick out county averages--this time, controlling\nfor demographics. Here, the coefficients on the regional dummy-variables would\n3While a behavioral response is likely, the degree to which previous estimates that were calculated\nduring a period when consumer choices were limited due to regulations on energy efficiency is\nunclear as many consumers might have been \"forced\" to choose greater levels of efficiency than\nthey otherwise preferred.\nprovide the information we sought. But because the data are thin or non-existent\nover wide areas of less populated, rural areas, these techniques are not appropriate.\nDepending on the questions asked, the literature on estimating household (or\nunit-level) energy demand utilizes a wide variety of techniques. For example,\nresearch focused on durable equipment purchases and long-run versus short-run\ndemand responses typically use two-stage reduced form models that capture the\npurchase decision and decision on how to use the equipment (Baker and Blundell\ncasting energy use often entails detailed demographic models (Raupach et al. 2007;\nO'Neill and Chen 2002). In both cases, regional variation (if present) is addressed\nusing dummy variables for broad geographic identifiers available in the data. Where\nregional variation has been the object of a statistical effort, demographic and degree-\nday data has often been used to substitute for detailed geographic information using\neconometric modeling (typically geographic identifiers are removed from available\ndata for confidentiality reasons).4\nSpatial econometric analysis is another approach suited for cases where interest\ncenters on a regression model and there is a need to address spatial autocorrelation\nand heteroskedasticity in the residuals (Anselin 1988; Anselin et al. 2004). The\nspatial econometric approach is comparable to our formulation when we employ the\ndemographic information.5 However, given our simple focus on the data's spatial\npattern itself, we utilize a non-parametric, kernel regression (Silverman 1986). Here,\nthe term \"regression\" is almost misleading; this technique provides a transparent way\nto estimate local energy as an average of spatially near observations and a statistically\nconsistent framework to construct standard errors and handle covariates.\nIn other words, kernel regression applied to spatial data creates an estimate of\nenergy use at a particular geographic point based on an average of energy use at\nnearby, sampled points. It also allows for the fact that data for some of the sampled\ncounties, with many more observations than others, contains less sampling error\ncompared to other sampled counties with fewer observations.\nWe begin with a sample of observations of fuel quantities Y1\n,..., YI\nin a set of\nsampled counties 1,...,I located at coordinates x1\n,...,xI\n. We assume\nYi\n= f (xi\n) + ei\nwhere f(x) describes the relevant spatial pattern of fuel use, and ei\nare errors with\nE[ei\n] = 0. Given our knowledge of the number of observations collected for each\n4Various researchers have used localized information--on household characteristics, fuel use, or\nclimate data (heating/cooling degree days) at the county or finer level--coupled with regression mod-\nels of aggregate data on these variables to spatially disaggregate data without detailed geographic\n5In our demographic model, we construct an initial estimate of the regional energy use pattern and\nthen we estimate a demographic model of energy use in a second stage with the spatial effects netted\nout. This is analogous to a spatial econometric approach that first estimates the spatial correlation\npattern, then estimates the regression model on a transformed data set that is independently and\nidentically distributed. This approach is very similar to a geographically weighted regression (for\nmore information on these type of analysis, see Fotheringham et al. 2002).\ncounty, ni\n, we assume E e2\ni\n, where 2 is the variance associated with an\nindividual household observation.\nOur estimate of energy use at an arbitrary point x, ^\nf (x), given our set of I\nobservations is\n^\nf (x) =\nI\nni\nwi\nj\nnj\nwj\n\u00b7 Yi\n=\nI\nni\nw x - xi\nb (x)\nj\nnj\nw x - xj\nb (x)\n\u00b7 Yi\nwhere x - xi\nis the Euclidian distance between points x and xi\n, w() is the \"kernel\"\nor weighting function, and b(x) is the \"bandwidth\" that can vary over location x. We\ninclude the number of observations ni\nin the weighting scheme, because there are ni\nobservations of Yi\nlocated at xi\n. By doing so, we are weighting county observations by\ntheir precision (one over the variance), which is proportional to ni\n. Note that kernel\nregression is simply a weighted average, where the art is defining the kernel function\nAs a weighted average, it is straightforward to compute the variance associated\nwith our estimator.

We choose the Gaussian\nfunction where w(d/b) = exp(-(d/b)2). The effect of this function is that, relative to\nthe weight at a distance of zero, the weight at d/b = 0.5 is 0.78, the weight at d/b =\n1 is 0.37, and the weight at d/b = 2 is 0.02. The principal advantage of this function is\nthat it is not piecewise defined and therefore quite smooth--a useful property when\nwe next determine the bandwidth.\nTo choose the bandwidth, we use cross validation (Stone 1974) that minimizes\nthe difference between the predicted and observed values at the sample points xi\n.\nThat is, pick b to minimize I\n^\nYi\n- Yi\n, where ^\nYi\nis the predicted value using\n6We can alternatively estimate the regional variation controlling for demographics by replacing Yi\nin Eq. (2) with Yi - ^\nzi where zi are covariates and ^\n is an partial regression coefficient on the\ncovariates. This is further discussed in the Electronic supplementary material.\n7Imagine a two-dimensional box of size b(x) by b(x) with observations spread out with ^\ng (x) n per\nsquare unit.\n8Negative weights have been proposed as a way to reduce bias but they also introduce many\nall observations except the ith one (see Electronic supplementary material for more\ninformation).\nWe make one further modification by allowing b to vary by location based on the\ndensity of observations. That is, where there are fewer observations we use a larger\nbandwidth. In particular, we specify b (xi\n) = ^\ng (xi\n) \u00af\nb, where ^\ng (xi\n) is again an\nestimate of the density of observations at point xi\n, \u00af\ng is the geometric mean of the\ndensity estimate, and b, again, is a global bandwidth parameter now chosen by cross\nvalidation with the specified spatial variation.9 We considered further estimates of\nlocal bandwidths, attempting to numerically minimize estimated mean-squared error\nbut with little success. The supplementary material includes additional details on the\nadaptive-bandwidth approach.\nWe use the adaptive cross-validation approach to compute bandwidths for each\nfuel independently. This same fuel-specific adaptive bandwidth is also used to\nestimate the variance in household fuel demand, and, in turn, the variance of our\ncounty-level estimates.\nFor each of the three primary fuels, we compute CO2\nincidence by multiplying\nestimated fuel demand by the carbon content of the fuel and the reference price\nused in our analysis ($10 per ton). Electricity is considerably more compli-\ncated because not only does the carbon content of electricity vary by location, the\npricing of that carbon content varies depending on whether a particular region has\ncompetitive or regulated electricity markets. To provide a realistic estimate of how\nmuch consumers will be affected by a market-based CO2\npolicy, we use regional\nestimates of electricity price impacts associated with a given CO2\nprice and apply\nthat to our reference CO2\nincidence associated with electricity is then the estimated county-level electricity\ndemand multiplied by this change in regional electricity prices.\nWe describe the methods for including covariates in Eq. (1), the data used to run\nordinary least squares regressions of household demographics and characteristics\non the use of each of the four fuels, and the regression results in the Electronic\nsupplementary material. Overall, the regression results are compelling for a number\nof reasons. Although one always has to be careful not to place too much emphasis\non R2 values, the model's explanatory power is within reasonable limits. Second, the\nparameter estimates are largely consistent across the fuels, although the estimates\nfor fuel oil do not perform as well.\nFigure 1 shows our estimates for the patterns of electricity, natural gas, fuel oil, and\ngasoline use at the county level. The scale on each figure indicates both the energy use\nand associated incidence from a $10 per ton carbon dioxide emissions tax, except in\nthe case of electricity, where carbon intensity varies by location.

All years of the two surveys align, except that the\ngasoline survey is 1994 not 1993 (labeled with an *). The EIA estimates are average consumption\nfor a household in the region and our estimates include both averages and medians (across county\nestimates).

For example, in Maine, there is a 30% difference\nbetween the highest and lowest counties. Given New York's varied landscape, it is\nno surprise that it has significant within-state variation both in terms of percentage\ndifferences and levels. Although sporadic use exists here and there, there is little\nevidence of use in the South and West.\nGasoline usage shown in Fig. 1, panel c, shows remarkably little variation. From\na high of 1,090 gallons per year in Texas to a low of 790 gallons in New York\nand Maine, gasoline use fluctuates (geographically) much less than any other fuel.\nEIA estimates confirm the relative uniformity of gasoline use. Perhaps predictably,\nsouthern California, the Houston\u00adDallas corridor in Texas, and Atlanta show higher\n11Despite lower use per household in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, total fuel oil use is\nlarger in these states than in New England because of their higher populations.\nhousehold usage, and the more densely populated northeastern region shows some\nLooking at panel d in Fig. 1, the principal observation is that electricity usage\nin the South and Southeast is much higher than most other regions of the country.\nThis understandably arises from the need to operate air conditioning units most of\nthe summer and drives usage to more than 11,000 kWh in the South. According to\nEIA, air conditioning and space heating comprise 26% of the end-use consumption\nof residential electricity consumption in 2001. Another observation is the degree of\nheterogeneity within each state and census region. For example, the western census\nregion has highs of about 10,700 kWh in the Washington and Oregon and lows of\nWith natural gas, fuel oil, and gasoline, we can easily convert fuel use to emissions\ncoefficients from the Department of Energy and then multiply by $10\nper ton to get predicted CO2\nincidence levels. However, when we shift to carbon\nemissions from electricity production in Fig. 2, panel B, we need to take into account\nthe location and type of generation. The implication is that the pattern we observe in\nfuel use does not directly map onto CO2\nincidence.\nAlthough coal-fired power plants lead to high levels of carbon emissions per\nkilowatt-hour, hydropower in the Northwest and nuclear power in parts of New Eng-\nland and the Southeast have no emissions. Natural gas generation contains roughly\nhalf the carbon emissions per Btu compared to coal and has a considerably lower heat\nrate/higher conversion efficiency. In addition to the generation mix, differences in\nmarket structure are equally important in deriving CO2\nincidence measures because\nmarket structure affects how electricity prices will change in response to underlying\nfuel price changes. In particular, the Northeast is deregulated, and prices are set by\nthe marginal producer in the market (sometimes gas, sometimes coal).The South, on\nthe other hand, is regulated and prices are set at average cost, across all fuels, by\nregulators. Other regions face some mix of regulation and deregulation. The result\nof these differences is a concentration of electricity-related household CO2\nincidence\nin the Texas\u00adLouisiana region as well as around southern Indiana and Ohio. The\nsouthern census region has an average incidence level approximately 65% greater\nthan the northeastern region, which has the lowest mean level.\nFigure 2, panel a, aggregates up the CO2\nincidence of the $10 per ton CO2\ntax\nacross the four fuels, and we find average CO2\nincidence levels per household ranging\nfrom $240 per year in portions of the southern plains and Texas to less than $120 in\nthe Northeast and scattered throughout the West. Table 2 presents the differences\nin incidence within each census region. These results sharply focus the concerns we\nnoted at the outset: climate change policies that attempt to discourage carbon dioxide\nby raising the price of fossil fuels in relation to their CO2\nemissions will have different\neffects on households in different parts of the country. Impacts in some regions of the\n12As a check on our results, we can aggregate up our estimates to total gasoline consumption as\nmultiply it by 110 million households, which yields about 100 billion gallons. Next, we account for the\nfact that non-household motor-gasoline use accounts for about 15% of total gasoline use, yielding\n115 billion gallons of total demand. Finally, when we adjust for the 10% growth from our sample\nperiod to 2001 and the 10% since, we have roughly total annual motor gasoline consumption as\nfound in Annual Energy Review 2006, Washington: Energy Information Administration.\nTable 2 Annual household\nby census region\nMin Mean Median Max\nCounty County County County\nAll energy\nElectricity\ncountry are double the impact in others, and impacts in some counties are double the\nimpacts in other counties within the same region.\nThe flip side of CO2\nincidence is that the counties with higher incidence have\ngreater levels of household carbon emissions or are \"dirtier\" than other coun-\nties. The counties with total incidence greater than the 95 percent quartile are\nin Louisiana, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Texas, Kansas, Missouri, and Alabama. The\ncleanest counties--those with incidence levels less than the 5 percent quartile--\nare mostly in New York, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Vermont, Pennsylvania, and\nNevada. The median county is Santa Cruz County in Arizona with total incidence of\nSo far our discussion has ignored the fact that the CES collects extensive data on\nthe characteristics of households participating in the survey. Many of these--notably\nincome and household size--would be expected to have a large influence on energy\nuse. To the extent that there is substantial and persistent regional variation in these\ncharacteristics, the influence of these characteristics will be associated purely with\nregional variation based on the preceding approach.\nWhether we want to estimate regional variation in CO2\nincidence controlling\nfor this regional variation in household characteristics depends on the particular\nquestion. If we ask about the regional incidence of higher energy prices, there is no\nneed to control for these variables; we simply need to look at the regional patterns\nof energy use. However, we could ask how the energy use of a particular kind of\nhousehold would vary depending on where it is located. In this case we would want\nto hold constant characteristics and isolate the effect of geographic variation. For\nexample, policymakers might be interested in how low-income households might be\naffected in different parts of the country.\nFigure 2, panels c and d, illustrate the incidence levels of the median household\n(e.g., median income, household size, etc.) if you placed them in any particular\ncounty.13 Overall, the strong geographical patterns found in panels a and b remain,\nbut the tax burdens are lower, everything else equal, reflecting the skewed distrib-\nution of income and its impact on energy demand (median income is roughly half\n13Note that the variation in Fig. 2 panels c and d would be the same for any type of household based\non our model of energy use; only the level varies with demographic characteristics.\nmean income). The amount of relative variation (ratio of highest to lowest values) is\nsimilar in panels c and d, reflecting the fact that the bulk of overall variation is driven\nby geography, not demographic differences.14\nAlthough the patterns of energy use and CO2\nincidence appear to coincide with\nour intuition, it is useful to verify our estimates against other sources. Unfortunately,\nwe are not aware of another set of estimates at the county level. Table 1 compares our\nestimates aggregated (using population weights) to census regions versus household\nthe pattern of our mean aggregate estimates generally matches the EIA within the\nstandard error of our estimates.15 The notable discrepancies are lower estimates in\nour data for natural gas and fuel oil everywhere but the West.\nThere are several potential explanations for these discrepancies in Table 1. First,\ndata from EIA indicates this difference explains about one-quarter of the total\ndiscrepancy for natural gas (and does nothing for fuel oil). A second explanation\nis that the CES oversamples urban areas16 and urban households are less likely to\nuse natural gas and especially fuel oil. This effect is corrected in the demographic\nmodel where a control variable for urban/rural is used to predict fuel use.\nAs noted earlier, these estimates ignore any behavioral response. That is, the\nestimates assume consumers pay higher energy costs without investing in higher effi-\nciency equipment or choosing to forego energy services. In reality, we would expect\nboth to occur, with larger responses as more time elapses and capital stock turns over.\nAny of these kinds of mitigation efforts necessarily improve the consumers' outcome\nrelative to no behavioral response--in this way our estimates provide an upper bound\non actual impacts. Further, assuming behavioral responses are roughly proportional,\nsay, offsetting 15% of the initial impact absent any adjustment, the relative impacts\nacross counties will remain the same. Those counties with relatively high impacts will\ncontinue to experience relatively high impacts.\nConsulting the literature (Dahl 1993) we find short run elasticities of around\n0.15 and longer-run elasticities approaching unity or higher. These values suggest\nthat, in the short run, the pattern of impacts is unlikely to be much different than\nindicated in Figs. 1 and 2 with only 15% of the impact on energy prices offset by lower\nenergy consumption. In the longer run, reduced energy use might fully offset higher\n14This may not be true, however, at the very detailed level--in a particular county and year and for a\nparticular fuel. For instance, when we look at variation driven by solely by demographics (based on\nthe 2000 Census and our demographic control estimates), we find factors of 2, 3, 1.6, and 3 for natural\ngas, fuel oil, gasoline, and electricity, respectively, between the lowest and highest estimates. We\nfind, therefore, that the demographic variation is no larger than the geographic variation we found\nfor all fuels except perhaps gasoline (comparing Fig. 2a and c). Having said that, the demographic\nfactors suggest it is possible that at a fine level, demographic data could reveal additional variation.\nA recent study that lends support to our methods and results was a cross-country analysis that found\nthat access to natural resources and weather were significant explanatory variables in explaining\ndifferences in emissions even between countries with very similar income levels (Neumayer 2002).\n15A (small) portion of the difference in the West is because EIA includes Hawaii and Alaska in their\nestimates and we do not.\n16The purpose of the Consumer Expenditure Survey is to provide expenditure weights for the\nConsumer Price Index, which is turn constructed for various metropolitan areas.\nenergy prices. In this case, mitigation costs would be reflected in lower welfare (from\nreduced energy services) and higher capital costs (for greater energy efficiency).\nIt seems reasonable that these costs would continue to be roughly equal to some\nfraction of the initial impact on fuel expenditures.17\n4 Discussion\nIncreases in energy prices--whether arising from carbon policies or from other\nworld/national events--will have different impacts on households in different regions\nof the country. Electricity use is higher in the South, fuel oil is used almost entirely\nin the Northeast, and natural gas is much more prevalent in the Midwest. Gasoline\nusage fluctuates very little.\nPolicymakers need to be keenly aware of these differences as they contemplate\nclimate change policies that would put a price on CO2\nemissions. Such policies place a\nheavier burden on regions where geography and history have led to higher emissions\nper household. The South requires air conditioning. The Midwest is reliant on coal\nfor electricity generation. Californians drive more.\nquantify exactly how much these regional differences matter. While general patterns\nare well-known, our analysis implies that one size does not fit all. In fact, we find that\nthere exists considerable variation in the type of fuel used and the average level of\nuse across regions, states, and even counties. We also find substantial variation in the\nincidence of a CO2\ntax. This variation can be explained both by differences in energy\nuse as well as differences in the carbon intensity of electricity generation.\nAn interesting observation is that the regions of the country where incidence is\nlower--the Northeast and West Coast--happen to be those where recent initiatives\nhave been implemented to address climate change through state programs. Whether\nthe lower incidence is partly responsible for those efforts or whether it reflects a much\nlonger-term trend toward cleaner/more efficient energy use is unclear.\nWhat do our results quantitatively imply about the regional incidence of climate\nchange policies? The overall result for carbon emissions is that households in the\nNorthwest United States would likely bear half the burden of households in the\nMidwest and Texas where per household incidence is almost double. If equity is\na concern, policymakers will need to contemplate ways that this burden can be\nequalized--a process that most likely would occur in the design phase of the policy.\nWe should point out, however, that while the focus of this work has been regional\nincidence, it is also important to consider the distribution across other key household\nvariables, such as income (Dinan 2000) and more generally, how one might measure\ninterregional equity (Rose and Zhang 2004).\n17With roughly linear marginal mitigation costs and a unitary long-run elasticity, it is easy to\nshow that the long-run net cost impact would be x 1 + 1\nx (1 + x), where x is the original, frac-\ntional increase in energy costs. Here, the long-run impact is some fraction of the original impact x,\nreflecting the cost of fuel savings that range linearly between the original price p and new, higher\nprice (1 + x)p.\n"
