The experimental group received a number of learning strategies adopted and adapted\nby the researchers, including concept-mapping, vocabulary notebook, passage restatement, dictionary use, summary writing,\nand guessing. The treatment was carried out 4 hr a week for 15 consecutive weeks. The Language Learners' Beliefs Scale,\ndeveloped and validated by Birjandi and Mohammadi, and the reading comprehension section of Cambridge Preliminary\nEnglish Test (PET) were administered before and after the treatment to identify the students' shifts in beliefs about language\nlearning and to measure reading comprehension ability, respectively. The results of independent t test indicated that the\ninstruction of learning strategies changed the university students' beliefs about language learning.

In fact, in these systems, the sole purpose\nof a teacher, as Kreis (2004) asserted, is not to impart knowl-\nedge to his or her students, but to shape their beliefs so that\nthey are regarded as the extension of themselves. However,\nhow can a teacher shape and reshape the learners' mentality?\nStudents attend the class with a wide range of knowledge,\nsocio-cultural background, educational experiences, and per-\nsonal attitudes toward English language learning. This signi-\nfies the importance of studying learners' belief about\nlanguage learning and the ways to enrich it.\nSince the 1970s, when cognitive approach to language\nlearning became prevalent, learners were seen more actively\ninvolved in the process of language learning.Aline of research\ndealt with good language learners pioneered by Rubin (1975)\nidentified a set of strategies that facilitate their learning. The\nresults of these studies and many others were underlining the\nlearners' personal beliefs they held as their experience in the\nprocess of language learning. Omaggio (1978) summarized\nthese studies indicating that good language learners have\n\"insight into the nature of the task [of learning]\" (p. 2).\nHosenfeld (1978) also referred to \"mini-theories\" of second\nlanguage learning that forms the way learners learn language.\nThese theories are the beliefs learners hold and can be regarded\nas a variable, because they can vary from learner to learner.\nMuch of the research since then has been concerned with pro-\nviding new classification for the learners' beliefs.\nAdministering Beliefs About Language Learning\nInventory (BALLI), Horwitz (1987) suggested five general\nareas of beliefs: (a) the difficulty of language learning, (b)\naptitude for language learning, (c) the nature of language\nlearning, (d) learning and communication strategies, and (e)\nidentified a classification of beliefs with three categories: (a)\nuse of language, (b) beliefs relating to learning about the lan-\nguage, and (c) the importance of personal factors.\n1Department of English, Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad\nUniversity, Tehran, Iran\nCorresponding Author:\nMojtaba Mohammadi, Department of English, Faculty of Language and\nLiterature, Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran,\nIran.\nEmail: m.mohammadi@riau.ac.ir\nLearning Strategy Training and the Shift\nin Learners' Beliefs About Language\nLearning: A Reading Comprehension\nContext\nMojtaba Mohammadi1, Parviz Birjandi1, and Parviz Maftoon1\n Keywords\nlearning strategy training, beliefs about language leaning, learners' beliefs, LLBS, reading comprehension\n2 SAGE Open\nBenson and Lor (1999) also distinguished two different\ncategories: higher order conceptions and lower order beliefs.\nThey defined conceptions as \"concerned with what the\nlearner thinks the objects and processes of learning are,\"\nwhereas beliefs are \"what the learner holds to be true about\nthese objects and processes\" (p. 464).\nEllis (2004) divided the construct into two general levels:\nhigher order conceptions (epistemology) and lower order\nbeliefs. A number of studies, including Benson and Lor\ncertain conceptions regarding what language is and how it is\nlearned. It contains three categories: quantitative/analytic,\nqualitative/experiential, and self-efficacy/confidence.\nDespite all these classifications, a point to consider is that\nbelief is culture-based in nature, and learners in any context\ncan have their own type of beliefs being shaped or reshaped\nby means of a variety of sources. Learning strategy training\ncan be a case in point.\nLearning Strategy Training\nIn the past 40 years or so, the literature on language learning\nstrategy research has witnessed a diversity of issues on its\npath to reach the present status. Chamot (2004) introduced\neight such issues extracted from the literature of leaning\nstrategy in the literature. The first issue to discuss here is the\nidentification of language learning strategies. A substantial\nbody of literature is devoted to defining what learning strat-\negy is and identifying these unobservable mental learning\nstrategies. In English as a foreign language (EFL) context,\nRichards and Schmidt (2010) simply defined learning strate-\ngies as \"the ways in which learners attempt to work out the\nmeanings and uses of words, grammatical rules, and other\naspects of the language they are learning\" (p. 331). In Stern's\n(1983) view, strategy is \"best reserved for general tendencies\nor overall characteristics of the approach employed by the\nlanguage learner, leaving techniques as the term to refer to\nparticular forms of observable learning behavior\" (p. 236).\nAt the same time, Rubin (1987) asserted that learning strate-\ngies are \"strategies which contribute to the development of\nthe language system which the learner constructs and affect\nreferred to language learning strategies as \"behaviors or\nactions which learners use to make language learning more\nsuccessful, self-directed and enjoyable\" (p. 235). Anderson\n(2005) defined strategies as \"the conscious actions that learn-\ners take to improve their language learning\" (p. 757).\nAccording to Chamot (2005), learning strategies are \"proce-\ndures that facilitate a learning task. Strategies are most often\nconscious and goal-driven, especially in the beginning stages\nof tackling an unfamiliar language task\" (p. 112).\nWhen the concept of learning strategy was investigated\nand defined, it was time to devise some classifications\naccording to the conceptualization of the term learning strat-\negy. There are almost dozens of second language learning\nstrategy classifications. In Wenden's (1983) classification,\nshe identified three general categories of self-directing learn-\ning strategies: (a) knowing about language, (b) planning, and\n(c) self-evaluation. Rubin (1987) suggested that there are\nthree kinds of strategies that contribute directly or indirectly\nto language learning: learning strategies, communication\nstrategies, and social strategies. O'Malley and Chamot\n(1990) proposed a framework in which three major types of\nlearning strategies are classified: metacognitive, cognitive,\nand social/affective. Metacognitive strategies are the ones\nthat involve planning for learning, thinking about the learn-\ning process as it is taking place, monitoring of one's produc-\ntion or comprehension, and evaluating learning after an\nactivity is completed. Cognitive strategies, according to\nO'Malley and Chamot (1990), \"are more directly related to\nindividual learning tasks and entails direct manipulation or\ntransformation of learning materials\" (p. 8), strategies such\nas repetition, translation, grouping, deduction, contextualiza-\ntion, and transfer. Social/affective strategies concern interac-\ntion with other learners and native speakers and management\nof the affective demands made by language learning such as\ncooperation, question for clarification, and self-talks.\nOxford's model of learning strategies is believed to be\none of the most comprehensive classifications (Brown, 2007;\nbetween direct and indirect strategies. The former consist of\n\"strategies that directly involve the target language . . . [in a\nway that] require mental processing of the language\" (p. 37).\nThe latter, however, \"provide indirect support for language\nlearning through focusing, planning, evaluating seeking\nopportunities, controlling anxiety, increasing cooperation\nand empathy and other means\" (p. 151). The strategies under\nthe first category (direct), according to Oxford, are memory\nstrategies, cognitive strategies, and compensation strategies.\nMemory strategies, also called mnemonics, \"enables learners\nto store verbal material and then retrieve it when needed for\nvary a lot \"ranging from repeating to analyzing expressions\nof cognitive strategies: \"1) Practicing, 2) Receiving and\nsending messages, 3) Analyzing and reasoning, and 4)\nCreatingstructureforinputandoutput\"(p.17).Compensation\nstrategies, according to Oxford (1990), \"enable learners to\nuse the new language for either comprehension or production\ndespite limitations in knowledge\" (p. 47). The second cate-\ngory (indirect) includes \"actions which go beyond purely\ncognitive devices, and which provide a way for learners to\ncoordinate their own learning process\" (p. 136).\nStern (1992), furthermore, summarized and reclassified\nhis classification of 10 strategies, offered in Stern (1983),\ninto 5 main language learning strategies: (a) management\nand planning strategies, (b) cognitive strategies, (c) commu-\nnicative\u00adexperiential strategies, (d) interpersonal strategies,\nand (e) affective strategies.\nAnother line of research in language learning strategy is the\nrelationship between learning strategy and the learner vari-\nables such as gender and level of language proficiency. Several\nMohammadi et al. 3\nworks were carried out to underline the role of gender (El-Dib,\n(2004) asserted, we cannot certainly confirm any role for gen-\nder in learning strategy use.As for proficiency level, the results\ntend to be convergent. The majority of the studies (Anderson,\nmand of English are skillful users of learning strategies.\nThe next line in the language learning strategy research is\nthe fact that learning strategy use is culture- and context-\nspecific. The results of some studies underlined that the\nadoption of strategies may vary among the learners in differ-\nent learning contexts and with various cultural values\n(Keatley, Chamot, Spokane, & Greenstreet, 2004; Olivares-\nOne more research area in the literature of language learn-\ning strategy is the explicit instruction of strategy within such\nframeworks as Strategy-Based Instruction or Learning\nStrategy Training. Many scholars unanimously agree on the\nusefulness of explicit instruction of strategy (Anderson,\n2003). However, the integration or separation of strategy\ntraining from other learning tasks is a source of contention.\nSome argue for the integration of them (Chamot et al., 1999;\nalso introduced four core features of a strategy-based instruc-\ntion model: (a) awareness raising, (b) presentation and mod-\neling, (c) providing multiple practice opportunities, and (d)\nevaluating the effectiveness of strategies and transferring\nthem to new tasks.\nThere are some other research lines in the literature of\nlearning strategy such as the role of the language of instruc-\ntion in teaching learning strategies and the transfer of strate-\ngies to new tasks or to the rest of their education, which are\nrecently taken care of.\nA closer look at the above discussions implies that learn-\ning strategies are not just an affective factor but a cognitive\nfactor as well, which are affected by cultural, social, and situ-\national contexts of use. This study aimed to investigate the\nanswer to the following questions:\nResearch Question 1: Does teaching language learning\nstrategies have any significant effect on the beliefs of\nIranian EFL learners?\nResearch Question 2: Does teaching language learning\nstrategies have any significant effect on the reading com-\nprehension ability of the Iranian EFL learners?\nMethod\nParticipants\nThe population of the study included all the students studying\nEnglish language at the faculty of Persian literature and foreign\nlanguages in Islamic Azad University, Roudehen Branch in\nTehran. Out of them, two intact classes with a total of 92 stu-\ndents were selected from among the freshman students who had\nbeen admitted to the faculty using cluster random sampling. The\nfreshman students were selected because their beliefs about lan-\nguage learning were all shaped in their school period, and the\nchange could be more significant. They were both male (n = 23)\nand female (n = 55). To homogenize the students, a proficiency\ntest (Test of English as a Foreign Language [TOEFL]) was\nadministered to all of them. For the sake of practicality, only the\nreading comprehension and structure sections were adminis-\ntered. Based on the results, those at the extreme ends, standing\nat the point more than one standard deviation below and above\nthe mean, were crossed out of the study. They were totally 78\nstudents majoring in English language teaching, English lan-\nguage translation, and English language literature ranging\nInstrument\nThe research instrument in this study was Language Learners'\nBeliefs Scale (LLBS; see the appendix) designed by Birjandi\nreliability of the measure, as reported by Birjandi and\nMohammadi, the Cronbach's alpha coefficient was calcu-\nlated among a group of 328 university students, which came\nto be .78. To investigate the construct validity, they subjected\nthe 32-item LLBS to principal components analysis (PCA)\nusing SPSS Version 16. The Kaiser\u00adMeyer\u00adOklin (KMO)\nmeasure of sampling adequacy was 0.74, and Bartlett's test\nof sphericity had reached statistical significance supporting\nthe factorability of the correlation matrix. The results of five-\nfactor solution (Table 1) revealed a total of 36.52% of the\nvariance, with Components 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 contributing\nThe underlying constructs that were considered in the scale\nwere Mediatory beliefs (seven items), Self-beliefs (eight items),\nAttributive beliefs (six items), Traditional beliefs (six items),\nand Epistemological beliefs (five items). Self-beliefs referred to\nthe beliefs about self-worth, self-concept, and self-efficacy,\nTable 1. Total Variance Explained.\nFactors Eigenvalue % of variance Cumulative %\n4 SAGE Open\nwhereas epistemological beliefs were designated to the beliefs\nabout the nature of knowledge of language and learning.\nAttributive beliefs are beliefs about the causes of language\nlearning, and mediatory beliefs are composed of beliefs about\nthe role of mediators in language learning. Traditional beliefs\nalso refer to all the learning beliefs that are deeply rooted in\nthe traditional English language learning/teaching methodol-\nogy. The answer to the items of the LLBS was supposed to be\ndone on a 4-point Likert-type scale with 4 options for the\nresponses as strongly disagree, disagree, agree, or strongly\nagree. For the ease of computation, the responses were\nnumerically coded 1 to 4, respectively.\nThe reading comprehension section of Cambridge\nPreliminary English Test (PET) was also used as a pretest\nand posttest to measure participants' reading comprehension\nability. It included 35 items in five different parts adminis-\nProcedure\nHaving homogenized the students and deselected those at both\nextremes in the proficiency test, the researcher had two classes\nof control (n = 38) and experimental (n = 40) groups. LLBS and\nreading comprehension test, as pretests, were administered to\nboth classes to identify their beliefs about language learning and\ntheir reading comprehension ability prior to the treatment. Both\nof the classes were taught by one of the researchers so that the\nimpact of the teacher's cognition, bias, teaching methods, and\nstyles was nullified. The university syllabus for the course\nrequired the course book called Active Skills for Reading Book\n3 (Anderson, 2008, 2nd ed.). It should be mentioned here that\nalthough verifying strategy is one of the six basic assumptions\nof the book, the researchers decided to choose the course book\nfor two reasons: One is that what is claimed by the study is the\nexplicit instruction of learning strategies while it is not directly\nclaimed by the series' author. Second, the researchers' years of\nexperience revealed that the explicit teaching of learning strate-\ngies is not a common practice of the teachers in the classes of\nthis type. In the experimental class, in addition to their class-\nroom syllabus, the students were presented a set of strategies.\nBecause the classes were both \"Reading Comprehension,\" most\nof the learning strategies presented in the experimental class\nwere in one way or another related to it and the related skills and\nsubskills. The researchers adopted and adapted a number of\nlearning strategies for the experimental class, including con-\ncept-mapping, vocabulary notebook, passage restatement, dic-\ntionary use, summary writing, and guessing.\nIn concept-mapping strategy, students were required to\nidentify important concepts in their passages and relate those\nconcepts to each other. Students were also asked to prepare a\nvocabulary notebook for any new words they encountered in\nlessons along with their synonyms and antonyms, collocations,\nroots, and derivations. In passage restatement strategy, they\nwere supposed to restate the reading passage or the stories\nassigned to them for their classmates. This strategy had two\ndifferent versions: one by restating the story from different\npoints of view or from the character's point of view and the\nother by restricting them to use limited number of vocabulary\nto restate the text. It also contained the story reproduction using\ncertain given keywords. The students were also taught the\nproper use of monolingual dictionary and kept practicing it in\nclass. In summary writing strategy, to enhance their memory of\nthe main ideas, students were asked to write the summary of\ntheir reading passages (at most one to three paragraphs) and\ntheir story readings at home (more than five paragraphs). In\nguessing strategy, they worked on the meaning of the keywords\nin the passage and were encouraged to do the postreading activ-\nities guessing the other words through context, word roots, pre-\nfixes, and suffixes. This way, their tolerance of ambiguity could\nbe fostered. At the end of the semester (with a 15-week inter-\nval), the LLBS and reading comprehension test were adminis-\ntered again to check the probable changes in learners' beliefs\nabout language learning and reading comprehension abilities.\nData Analysis and Discussion\nTo answer the research questions, the data from the adminis-\ntrations of LLBS to both experimental and control groups\nwere collected as the pretest and posttest. Independent-\nsamples t tests were run to compare the experimental and\ncontrol groups' means on the pretest and posttest of beliefs.\nBefore discussing the results, it should be mentioned that the\nassumption of normality--a prerequisite to independent-\nsamples t test--was met (Table 2). The ratios of skewness\nand kurtosis over their respective standard errors were\nThe assumption of homogeneity of variance will be discussed\nwhen reporting the results of the independent-samples t test.\nThe data on pretests were, then, analyzed. Independent t\ntest was run to compare the experimental and control groups'\nmean scores on pretest of beliefs to prove that the two groups\nheld the same beliefs prior to the main study. As displayed in\nTable 3, the mean scores for experimental and control groups\nTable 2.

Thus, it can be\nconcluded that the two groups enjoyed the same level of\nbeliefs prior to the main study.\nIt should be noted that the assumption of homogeneity of\nis why the first row of Table 4, that is, \"Equal variances\nassumed,\" was reported. Figure 1 represents the homogene-\nity of pretest for both groups.\nNext, the posttests were analyzed. An independent t test\nwas run to compare the experimental and control groups'\nmean scores on posttest of beliefs to probe the effect of\nteaching learning strategies on the shifts in their beliefs about\nlanguage learning. As displayed in Table 5, the mean scores\nfor experimental and control groups on posttest of beliefs\nand the effect size, r = .29, representing an almost moderate\neffect size according to Field (2009), indicate that there was\na significant but moderate difference between experimental\nand control groups' mean scores on the posttest. Thus, it can\nbe concluded the null hypothesis as teaching language learn-\ning strategies does not have any significant effect on the\nbeliefs Iranian EFL learners possess is rejected although the\nresults should be interpreted cautiously due to the moderate\neffect size value of the t statistic.\nIt should be noted that the assumption of homogeneity of\nwhy the first row of Table 6, that is, \"Equal variances\nassumed\" was reported.

The instruction of learning strategies was integrated\nwith the linguistic content classroom tasks, and the results\nwere in line with those proposed by some scholars who argue\nfor their integration (Chamot et al., 1999; Chamot &\nproved a shift in the learners'beliefs about language learning\nand endorsed the results of the study by Yang (1992) who\nindicated that learning \"strategies can cause beliefs as well\"\nConclusion and Implications\nThis study was an attempt to examine the effect of teaching\nlearning strategies on learners' beliefs about language learn-\ning and their reading comprehension ability. The findings of\nthe study can be categorized into two parts: the effects of\nlearning strategies on both changes in learners' beliefs and\ntheir dynamicity and their reading comprehension ability.\nThe results of this study indicated that strategy-rich class-\nrooms can enrich the students' beliefs and develop their cog-\nnition about language learning. There are two groups of\nstudies in the literature adopting language learning beliefs\nand language learning strategies as the major variable. The\nfirst group examined the effects of learning beliefs on stu-\ndents' language learning strategies (Abraham & Vann, 1987;\nunanimously agreed that language learning beliefs can influ-\nence learning strategy use. The second group has examined\nthe relationship between beliefs about language learning and\nlearning strategy use (Abedini, Rahimi, & Zare-ee, 2011;\nneer work because, as mentioned above, there has been no\nsuch study in the literature as far as the researchers could\naccess.\nThe results of this study are also significant when the\nlearners' beliefs have changed during a short term. The lit-\nerature has witnessed two groups of studies in this respect:\nOne is related to those which claim that belief is stable,\ninflexible, and resistant to change that was once favorably\nTable 6.Independent t Test Posttest of Beliefs by Groups.\nLevene's test for\nequality of variances t test for equality of M\n\nF Significance T df\nSignificance\n(two-tailed)\nM\ndifference\nSE\ndifference\n95% confidence interval\nof the difference\n Lower Upper\nExperimental Control\nFigure 2.

The second group is related to those which concluded\nthat beliefs at micro-level (short time) are not changing and\nare very stable at the group level (e.g., Kern, 1995). The\nresults of this study have no commonalities with those in\nboth of the above groups. However, it is in line with the\nresults of a few studies that ended up with significant changes\nin learners' beliefs at 1-year intervals or shorter (Amuzie &\nThis study was conducted among university students with\nmore or less established beliefs about language learning. It\ncan be carried out among language learners of different pro-\nficiency levels. Also, belief changes here were investigated\nfrom an emic rather than etic perspective, which can be a\nsuggestion for further studies. Furthermore, the future stud-\nies can be on the investigation of macro-dynamicity of\nbeliefs about language learning rather than micro-dynamic-\nity, which was adopted by this study.\nThe results of this study enjoy certain implications for the\nstakeholders in language education. Teachers are suggested\nto equip students with the strategies for better learning along\nwith the course content. This is helpful for the students not\nonly to be a \"good language learner\" but also to improve\ntheir autonomy and self-efficacy. The message for the teach-\ners is that students' beliefs can be shaped or reshaped if there\nare meditational tools such as strategies for language learn-\ning. Syllabus designers are also recommended to include\nlearning strategies within the syllabus. If these strategies are\nreinforced by the course books all through the syllabus, stu-\ndents' beliefs are formed and reformed more systematically.\nOnly this can revive the hope that an educational system is\nstepping toward its ultimate goal, which is educating\nstudents for the future.\nTable 8.Independent t Test for Pretest of Reading Comprehension by Groups.\nLevene's test for\nequality of variances t test for equality of M\n\nF Significance T df\nSignificance\n(two-tailed)\nM\ndifference\nSE\ndifference\n95% confidence interval of\nthe difference\n Lower Upper\nEqual variances not\nassumed\nTable 9.
