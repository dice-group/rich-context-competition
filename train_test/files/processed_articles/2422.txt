Policing\nIntroduction\nMandatory arrest for misdemeanor domestic violence--mostly without injury--was\nadopted by over half of U.S. state legislatures in the 1980s (Mills 2003; Sherman\n1992). These laws required arrests for slaps, kicks, punches, or other acts unlikely to\ncause death or serious injury (as distinct from aggravated assault, for which arrest was\nnot made mandatory). They were based in part on a randomized experiment that found\narrest for these minor assaults caused less re-offending for 6 months after police\nYet by the early 1990s, five replications of the original experiment created a more\ncomplex body of evidence: arrests consistently reduced repeat offending for employed\nsuspects, but among unemployed suspects arrest doubled recidivism (Pate and Hamilton\nsample analysis of all six trials found a small average benefit but confirmed the different\neffects on jobless versus employed suspects (Maxwell et al. 2002). Although these\nrecidivism findings suggested that many victims, like their suspect counterparts, might\nbe harmed by mandatory arrest, the research had little impact on state laws or police\npolicies--partly because of measurement issues in both low-response rate victim\ninterviews and selective reporting of domestic violence to police.\nA quarter-century after these experiments, a clearer outcome can be exam-\nined to measure the impact of mandatory arrest on victims: death. This unam-\nbiguous measure provides a more powerful focus for debate about the wisdom\nof current state laws. While no experiment on cases can provide evidence on\nwhether a general deterrent effect of mandatory arrest lowers domestic assault\nacross entire cities, mortality data can suggest whether more victims are dying\nafter arrests than after warnings. Since the majority of domestic homicides\noccur without police contact of any kind with the victim prior to these murders\non mortality of those victims who do have contact with police may provide the\nmost concrete guidance for policy.\nOne case\u00adcontrol design has reported that for domestic homicide, arrest is a\nprotective factor (Campbell et al. 2003). No prospective-longitudinal or experimental\ndesign, however, has previously examined the association between partner arrest and\nmortality of domestic violence victims.\nWe began this long-term follow-up by attempting to discover whether arrest de-\nterred--or increased--future domestic homicide. As our study protocol indicated, we\nwere also open to all possible effects of arrest on mortality. Our intention in this\nanalysis was to explore any possible connection between arrest and long-term mortality\nrates. Milwaukee offered the experiment with the highest success rate (98 %) of the six\n1980s trials in delivering treatments as randomly assigned (Sherman 1992). This trial\narguably provides an opportunity to discover causal links of arrest to death even\nwithout directly measuring any causal pathways triggered by the randomly assigned\ntreatments.\nL.W. Sherman, H.M. Harris\nMethods\nSample and trial design\nThe 1987\u00ad88 Milwaukee Domestic Violence Experiment (MilDVE) was reported in\ndetail shortly after its completion (Sherman 1992; Sherman and Smith 1992), including\neligibility criteria, procedures, and treatment fidelity. No long-term mortality outcomes\nfor victims have been reported from MilDVE to date (Sherman and Harris 2013).\nMilDVE was a three-armed (1:1:1) randomized trial comparing \"short\" and \"long\"\narrests of suspected assailants to a warning. In the latter arm, police left the scene while\nsuspects and victims were usually still present together. In \"short\" arrests, police\nreleased suspects in a mean of 4.5 h after booking at police headquarters; in \"long\"\narrests release averaged 11.1 h after booking. About half of the victims in the arrest arm\nmet with a prosecutor at the courthouse the next business day, but only 5 % of the\narrests were prosecuted.\nCases of serious injury were ineligible, as were attempts to inflict serious injury.\nWhile 13 % of the eligible cases had an injury for which victims sought medical\nattention, only 5 % of victims went to hospital after the police came (Sherman 1992).\nBoth suspects and victims were required to be older than 18 and in a domestic\nrelationship. A team of 36 officers screened, enrolled, and accepted random assignment\nMortality follow-up study\nIn 2012\u00ad2013, the present authors obtained the list of victim names and dates of birth in\nMilDVE, then purchased mortality data from the Wisconsin Office of Vital Statistics\nthat we cross-checked and expanded through searches of the Social Security Death\nIndex (SSDI), which features national coverage of all persons who have ever received\nFederal welfare benefits of any kind. Tests of the comprehensiveness of its Death\nMaster File (DMF) show that for the people aged 25\u00ad54 (the age most victims in our\nsample entered the study) the percentage of publicly available death records compared\nto the national (confidential) list of death certificates was 75 % in 1997, having risen\nsteadily for over a decade (Hill and Rosenwaike 2001).\nSince only 10 % of the DMF cases found in our study lacked records in Wisconsin, a\nsmall but unknown number of cases were probably undetected during mortality follow-\nup, but were arguably not \"lost\" in CONSORT terms (Fig. 1) because we looked for\nthem in the same way that we found the other deaths. To avoid errors, multiple dates of\nbirth, cities in which decedents had resided, and other checks were used to determine\nmatches. Cause of death is not known for the nine deaths (out of 91) identified only by\nthe DMF. There is no evidence that any differential movement out of state was created\nby the randomly assigned treatment. Errors in detecting death would likely have the\nsame structure in both groups.\nWhile there was no national registry of crime and justice trials in 1987, the primary\nfor the random assignment of arrest was granted by a vote of the Milwaukee City\nCouncil and an Institutional Review Board of the Crime Control Institute of\nWashington DC, both in 1986. Approval for our 23-year follow-up study was obtained\nIncreased death rates of domestic violence victims\nfrom the Institutional Review Board of the University of Maryland in 2012, title\nRandomization and masking\nSuspects were randomly assigned to arrest or warning in a sequence determined by an\nindependent statistician (Sherman 1992), without consent of either victims or suspects,\nconsistent with ethical standards and law for experimentation in criminal sanctions\n(Federal Judicial Center 1981). Assignments were enclosed in sequentially numbered,\nopaque, sealed envelopes opened one at a time by the independent research team.\nDetails of the sequence remained unknown to all police and members of the research\nteam until police called researchers to report identifying details for both suspect and\nvictim, and each envelope was opened while police officers remained on the phone and\nresearchers communicated the assigned treatment. Because randomization assigned\nsuspects to different legal statuses, it was impossible to mask the treatment from the\nresearch staff or participants.\nProcedures\nAfter deciding that there was probable cause to believe that an eligible suspect had\nassaulted an eligible victim, MilDVE police officers called the warrant desk to insure\nthere were no outstanding arrest warrants for the suspect. Police then obtained the\nrandomly assigned treatment and arrested or warned the suspects accordingly, using a\nstandard script for the warning. Police handcuffed suspects in 94 % of arrests, doing so\nin front of the victims in 73 %. No victims in any case were arrested.\nMilDVE randomly assigned arrests or warnings to cases, rather than to people. A\nCONSORT diagram for victims appears below as Fig. 1. The experiment allowed re-\nenrolment of the same persons in multiple cases, based on a primary concern with\nTrial Profile: Victims As First Treated\nWarned: n=4\nArrested: n=2\nLost to Follow-Up: n=0 Lost to Follow-Up: n=0\nExcluded from Analysis: n=0 Excluded from Analysis: n=0\nEnrollment\nFollow -Up\nAnalysis\nAllocation\n* Estimated assuming all ineligible cases included unique individuals\n13 victims were treated\nas suspects before they\nwere treated as victims\nFig. 1 CONSORT diagram for MilDVE victims as first treated\nL.W. Sherman, H.M. Harris\nshort-term repeat offending (Sherman 1992). For purposes of assessing long-term\ndifferences in mortality, we analyzed the random assignment of intention-to-treat in\nthe first case in which each individual appeared as a victim, even if they were\nsubsequently treated as an offender or as a victim whose partner received a different\ntreatment. Only 1 % of victims (13 of 1,125) had previously been treated in the\nexperiment as suspects.\nStatistical analyses\nMost analyses below pool data from the two arms of the trial in which victims'\npartners were arrested. This procedure under-estimates the effect of the \"stan-\ndard\" arrest in Milwaukee at the time, described here as \"long\" arrest, since it\nwas only \"short\" arrest that was adopted for the unique purpose of the trial;\n\"long\" arrest was the standard arrest condition before and after the trial. We\ncombine the two arrest categories to both increase the power of moderator\nanalyses, and provide more external validity to a range of time periods in\npolice custody--something that can vary widely across police agencies operat-\ning under identical mandatory arrest laws.\nUsing the intention-to-treat principle, we calculate relative risk ratios and their\nconfidence intervals between mortality for victims whose partners were arrested or\nwarned in their first enrolment as a victim. We examine both main effects and subgroup\neffects conditional on theoretically relevant moderator factors. As a sensitivity analysis,\nwe tested the effect of partner arrest on victims who had at any point had their partner\narrested by random assignment in the experiment, and not just at the point of their\ninitial enrolment as victims; we found no different results from that procedure. We also\nused Cox hazard models to adjust for slight imbalances in known baseline covariates\nthat could predict outcomes, and again for race as a strong moderator. We used Stata\nVersion 13 for all analyses.\nResults\nassigned to arrest or warning, with 1,125 unique victims whose partners were treated in\none or more of the cases. The CONSORT diagram shows the treatment pathways of\nthis sample with 98 % compliance on intent-to-treat.\nTable 1 shows victims' characteristics at baseline, which are similar but not\nidentical for the two treatment groups. Both groups were about 70 % African-\nAmerican, 10 % male, and averaging 30 years of age. Of eight characteristics\nexamined, however, three show significant differences between treatment\ngroups. Victims whose partners were arrested were more likely than those\nwhose partners were warned to have had partners who were employed, partners\nwith a prior arrest, and a prior arrest themselves. The combined effect of these\ndifferences yields an under-estimate of the effect of partner arrest on mortality,\nbased on the moderator analyses reported in Table 3. We adjust for these\ndifferences in a Cox proportional hazard model estimated in Table 4 and\ndisplayed (after correction) in Fig. 6 below.\nIncreased death rates of domestic violence victims\nMain effects\nThe primary outcome for all cases showed 64 % more deaths among victims whose\nsuspects had been arrested (Fig. 2). The arrested-partner group suffered 92.8 deaths per\npartners had been warned (p=0.02).\nThe relative risk ratio was even larger (but not significant) in the first 5 years after\nrandom assignment, with victim deaths in that period over three times higher in the\npartner-arrest group. The 23-year trend in main effect size is displayed in Fig. 3.\nDisaggregating outcomes by cause of death (Table 2) showed only two categories with\neven marginally significant differences: heart disease (p=0.122), which caused twice as\nmany deaths for partner-arrested victims as for partner-warned, and \"other\" internal causes\n(p=0.06), for which arrest raised the risk of death by 183 % (d=0.4).

Sherman, H.M. Harris\ncandidates were selected for examination largely on the basis of previous moderators\nfound for arrest effects on repeat domestic assault (Sherman et al. 1992; Sherman and\nSmith 1992). In this analysis, victim employment and race were both powerful\nmoderators.\nThe overall 64 % difference between the arrest and warned group was almost\nentirely concentrated among the African-American victims (Fig. 4). The white sub-\ngroup had only a 9 % higher death rate after partner arrest than after a partner warning.\nFor the African-American victims, the rate of death after a partner's arrest was 98 %\nhigher than it was after a partner's warning (p=.03).\nFurther moderator analyses showed, in both races combined, that the association of\npartner arrest with victim mortality was much higher if the victim had a job (RR=\nAfrican-American victims, since there was no discernible treatment effect on mortality\namong white victims who were employed at time of enrolment.

The adjustment was informed by Table 4, which shows the predicted\neffect of having each imbalance equalized.

The results show higher mortality for the standard length\nof time in custody than for the artificially reduced time. Analyzing only the \"long\"\narrest condition against the warn condition, the raw relative risk ratio is 1:1.87,\ncompared to only 1:1.40 for the \"short\" arrest effect.\nOther analyses\nWe used Stata to calculate the population attributable fraction of deaths (Rockhill et al.\n1998) related to arrest as a risk factor in this analysis. In the absence of arrest, 30 % of\nthe observed mortality in this population over 23 years would have been avoided,\nholding all other factors constant. For black victims, 40 % of deaths would have been\navoided; for whites it would have been 6 %.\nFinally, since death was relatively rare in the sample overall, we performed a\npermutation test as a sensitivity analysis. This test shuffled the time order of deaths\nsaved each outcome. Figure 7 plots the actual order of deaths when time is real in\nrelation to the order when time is shuffled. It shows that the point estimate of arrest\neffects in the actual sequence (RR 1:1.85) lies in the far right tail of the distribution of\nall estimates. This result provides strong evidence that the relationship between victim\ndeath and partner arrest is causal, rather than a merely chance difference between the\ngroups that was not overcome by random assignment with very high treatment fidelity\nand little potential attrition.\nDiscussion\nThe analysis presented herein is an inductive exploration, not a deductive hypothesis\ntest. We did not predict our findings, and were surprised by their direction and\nmagnitude. This is not a reason to dismiss them: similar serendipity has characterized\nimportant scientific discoveries that withstood further testing, such as the effect of\npenicillin on infections (Haven 1994). Nevertheless, the present findings lack an\nTable 6 Short versus full arrest effects on victim mortality, all causes of death\nVariables Assigned (N) Deaths (N) Deaths (%) p value Relative risk ratio\nL.W. Sherman, H.M. Harris\nempirical context: They are both the result of the longest-ever follow-up of a random-\nized trial of a criminal justice sanction and the first study to examine the victim-\nmortality effects of suspect arrest for domestic violence.\nThis discussion seeks to provide a larger context for these findings. Doing so\nrequires that three key issues be addressed. One is the statistical risk that the findings\nare unique to this sample, and not indicative of a more general pattern. The second is\nthe theoretical pathway by which these results can be understood, especially the\ndifferences between black and white victims and by victim employment status. The\nthird is the potential policy implications of these findings, both for Wisconsin and\nelsewhere.\nStatistical interpretation\nWhile our results remained robust through multiple sensitivity tests, it remains possible\nthat they are not causal. Imbalances in measured covariates suggest that, despite\nrandom assignment, our results could contain spurious imbalances in unmeasured\nfactors predisposing mortality. Additionally, our findings may not generalize beyond\nthe Milwaukee sample, even if they generalize fully to the Milwaukee population from\nwhich they were sampled. Fortunately, because similar experiments were conducted at\nthe same time, our analytic process might be replicable in three more samples\n(Charlotte, Miami, and Omaha). Those replications, if accomplished, would provide\na valuable check on the external validity of our results.\nDespite the robustness of our results, some may question whether random assign-\nment can plausibly \"last\" so long and over a life-course in which other causes of death\ncould intervene. For example, this analysis does not examine common proximate\ncauses of death, such as cigarette smoking and obesity, but there is no time limit on\nthe causal interpretation of randomized experiments. Whatever the proximate causes of\ndeath may be, they are logically connected to differences in causal pathways influenced\nFig. 7 Permutation test distribution of 1,125 estimates, fluctuating the time order of death\nIncreased death rates of domestic violence victims\nby the exogenous instrument of random assignment itself. If, for example, the arrest\ngroup developed more obesity or a higher prevalence of smoking by year 23, such\ndifferences are likely to have been shaped by a causal pathway attributable to the\nrandomly assigned treatment.\nTheoretical interpretation\nThese results pose three related challenges of explanation:\n1. By what causal pathways can arresting a suspect cause a victim to die?\n2. What could explain why those pathways produced such different results for black\nand white victims?\n3. Why does victim employment double the lethal effect of suspect arrest among\nblack victims, but not among white victims?\nCausal pathways Currently, only hypotheses, not conclusions, can be drawn regarding\nthe particular causal pathways that may have extended from the arrest of MilDVE\nsuspects to the deaths of their victims. We suggest the interactions between arrest, race,\nand employment provide clues as to the direction those causal pathways took. We also\nsuggest that those clues point toward differential post-traumatic stress manifestations in\nvictims whose partners were arrested.\nExtensive studies of mortality and employment hierarchy in the British civil service\ndemonstrate that a large portion of the variation in mortality remains unexplained by\nsmoking, alcohol, or biological risk factors (Marmot et al. 1991, 1997; Kuper and Marmot\n2003; Kunz-Ebrecht et al. 2004). That variance can, however, be explained by psychoso-\ncial causes like the degree of autonomy people have in their work, the extent of their social\nisolation (Stringhini et al. 2012), and depression, which could result from an arrest that\nincreases stress by limiting current or even future intimate and other social relationships.\nBy the last wave of MilDVE victim interviews (77 % response rate at 6 months after\nenrolment), a large minority of victims in all three arms (45 % long-arrest; 44 % short-\narrest; 38 % warned) had already separated from their partners (Sherman 1992). Yet,\nwith no subsequent interviews, we cannot know whether arrest had long-term effects on\ntheir then-current or future relationships, on their loneliness and social isolation, or on\nany other potential stressor on a causal pathway to higher mortality. A new wave of\nMilDVE victim interviews could explore those stressors and causal pathways by\nexamining, for example, whether post-traumatic stress differences between victims\nwhose partners are warned or arrested create a biochemical pathway that reduces\nvictims' life-spans.\nGiven evidence of elevated levels of post-traumatic stress symptoms among women\nvictims of domestic violence in general (Silva et al. 1997; Golding 1999), the added\ntrauma of an arrest could be more dangerous than witnessing an arrest at lower baseline\nlevels of PTSS. Chronic but low-to-moderate elevation of post-traumatic stress symp-\ntoms have been reported to have a strong prospective link to premature mortality from\ncoronary heart disease (Kubzansky et al. 2007; Boscarino 2006), possibly via hyper-\nactivity of the central CRH [corticotrophin-releasing hormone] systems with under-\nactivity of the pituitary-adrenal axis (Kasckow et al. 2001). If some domestic violence\nL.W. Sherman, H.M. Harris\nvictims experience partner arrest as traumatic, that stress-related response chain could\ntrigger an increase in coronary heart disease and other morbidity leading to premature\ndeath. As a first step toward examining the viability of this pathway as an explanation\nof our results, new interviews could use PTSS assessment instruments to determine\nwhether victims in the partner-arrest group have higher current levels of PTSS than\nthose in the partner-warned group. Even better would be new experiments in which\nPTSS measures were taken within a few weeks after random assignment.\nExplaining racial differences A major obstacle to applying a PTSS theory to these\nresults lies with the racial differences. For the PTSS theory to fit the facts, African-\nAmerican domestic victims should presumably have higher baseline levels of PTSS\nthan white victims of domestic violence, on average. Yet, even a brief examina-\ntion of the literature shows, at worst, that black domestic violence victims\nsuffer less PTSS than whites, evincing greater resilience in relation to numerous\nsymptoms and measures of PTSS. At best, the literature, which includes only a\nA careful examination of that literature, however, shows that those findings may be\nconfounded with employment because unemployed African-American domestic vio-\nlence victims dominated the samples. Not all of the studies report employment data, but\nin the two that did unemployment amongst black domestic violence victims was greater\nor statistically similar to high unemployment among whites. In one study of 132\ndomestic violence victims in southern Michigan, in which 31 % of respondents were\nblack and 59 % white, 63 % of the black domestic violence victims were unemployed,\nwhereas only 31 % of the white victims were unemployed (Lily and Graham-Bermann\n2009). In the second study of 204 residents in a domestic violence shelter, unemploy-\nment was slightly, although not significantly, higher for white (76 %) than for black\n(72 %) victims (Wright et al. 2010). In the MilDVE sample, unemployment predom-\ninated amongst all victims at 70.6 %, but varied considerably by race. 75.5 % of black\nvictims were unemployed, whereas only 58.4 % of white victims were. Statistically\nspeaking, this significant racial difference in employment opens the door for a theo-\nretical explanation that may indicate a paradox of social context of the kind that\nSampson (2013) calls \"contextual causality.\"\nThe African-American victims in the MilDVE resided in the context of the most\nhyper-segregated metropolitan area in the US (Massey and Denton 1993). Most of the\nblack victims lived in areas of concentrated unemployment, while whites lived in\nmixed income neighborhoods dominated by employment rather than unemployment\n(Wilson 1981, 1996). This social context was also associated with a divergence in the\nstructure of intimate partner relationships between blacks and whites. Fertility in the\nabsence of marriage was more prevalent and accelerating far faster among black\ncontextual differences within the MilDVE victim sample may have led to equally\ndivergent identity constructs that Sampson (2013) calls \"identities of place\" (p. 2) that\ncould theoretically create a paradox in the relationship between race, employment, and\nvictims' vulnerability to PTSS mediating their risk of death in response to arrest.\nThe paradox would be present if there was greater resilience (and less PTSS) among\nblack victims who were unemployed than among those who were employed, and if\nIncreased death rates of domestic violence victims\nunemployed black victims also showed greater resilience than white victims whether\nthey were employed or not. That paradox may relate to the extent to which employed\nAfrican-American women, in particular, are more vulnerable to stress stemming from a\nthreat to their livelihood or a change in their status and identity resulting from the threat\nof loss of employment, in comparison to unemployed women. The latter not only had\nno job to lose; many could also predictably depend on welfare benefits (such as aid for\ndependent children) for their financial support. Only a minority of women in\nMilwaukee's concentrated poverty neighborhoods were employed \"strivers,\" pursuing\nwhat Anderson (1999) calls a \"decent\" code of conduct. They could reasonably have\nfeared a far greater loss of status and respectability from their partner being arrested\nthan most of the unemployed women, who had a different \"code\" or self-defined\nidentity unrelated to employment.\nFor employed white women in a neighborhood context of relatively high employ-\nment, the impact of a partner's arrest could have been very different. White victims\nwere more likely to have ever been married to their abusers than were black women (42\nvs. 26 %), with higher rates of employment among their partners. In particular, only\n16 % of the partners of employed black victims also had jobs, whereas 40 % of the\npartners of employed white victims, 38 % of the partners of unemployed black victims,\nand 30 % of the partners of unemployed white victims had jobs. White women were\ntherefore more likely to have been second earners, whose own employment provided a\nbuffer against a husband's or partner's loss of work, rather than the sole means of\nsupport in a single-parent household, as appears to have been the case for employed\nblack women. The psycho-social (and possibly biomedical) meaning of employment\nand its contribution to the identities of married white women, living in predominantly\nwhite neighborhoods of higher employment, could be quite different from that for\nemployment of unmarried African-American women in struggling neighborhoods.\nEmployment for white victims could even provide a protective effect against PTSS\nin response to a partner's arrest. Unemployment for white victims, however, could\nleave them more economically vulnerable to a loss of partner's earnings--or even the\npartner entirely--in the event of an arrest, thus increasing their stress levels.\nA race\u00ademployment paradox? The possibility that employment for black domestic\nviolence victims may lead to more PTSS from partner arrest, but make white victims\nmore resilient, implies that their death rates should correspond to this paradox of\nemployment and identity. Arrest should cause higher death rates for employed (vs.\nunemployed) black victims, but have the opposite interaction for white victims,\nregardless of their employment. As Table 3 shows, that is generally the case. For\nemployed black victims whose suspects were arrested, the 23-year death rate per 1,000\nwas 112; for unemployed black victims, the comparable figure was 94--less, but\nadmittedly not lower than for employed white victims. For white unemployed victims,\nthe death rate when partners were arrested was 111 per 1,000, almost the same as for\nemployed black victims; for white employed victims, it was only 40, and was actually\nlower for those whose partners were arrested than for those whose partners were\nwarned (which was 50).\nA further nuance in the findings is the different rates of death by race and employment\nafter partners are warned. For unemployed white women, the death rate after partner\nwarning was close to their death rate after partner arrest (87 vs. 111 per 1,000), but for\nL.W. Sherman, H.M. Harris\nemployed black women, the randomly assigned warning was a lifesaver: not one of them\nhad died after their partner was warned. If differences in neighborhood context help shape\ndifferent death rates (by race) from similar treatments, then these findings may be a prime\nexample of Sampson's (2013) concept of \"contextual causality.\"\nAlthough the results from this analysis failed to provide perfectly symmetrical\nsupport for it, the race employment paradox may still be true. It is simply one\nhypothesis for which the evidence provides limited support. Suffice it to say that\nevidence on PTSS among black and white victims of different employment statuses\nremains quite thin, and future evidence may still show that PTSS levels differ in direct\nproportion to the differences in death rates by demographic subgroups, consistent with\ndifferences in social context.\nThere are two ways to continue to investigate and develop these theoretical possi-\nbilities. One is gathering new evidence in the field from the Milwaukee sample (and the\nsamples of the companion experiments). The other is to analyze the data not by race but\nby neighborhood context. In further analyses we will examine the Census tract data for\nall victims, not only at random assignment but even at later periods of the follow-up, as\nmay be indicated by change of address data from the Wisconsin drivers' license records\nwe have obtained.\nPolicy implications\nRegardless of the reasons for the racial disparity we observe, the evidence is clear:\nAfrican-American victims of domestic violence are disproportionately likely to die after\npartner arrests relative to white victims. The magnitude of the disparity strongly\nindicates that mandatory arrest laws, however well-intentioned, can create a racially\ndiscriminatory impact on victims. While 6 % of the deaths amongst the white partners\nof arrested suspects could have been avoided, 40 % of the deaths amongst the black\npartners of arrested suspects could have been avoided, if only their partners had been\nwarned instead.\nWisconsin state law requires police to make arrests when they have probable cause\nto believe that a misdemeanor assault has occurred in a domestic relationship, irrespec-\ntive of race. This law was not intended to place black victims at a disadvantage to white\nvictims, or to deprive them of life. Like many other \"race-neutral\" policies, however,\nthis policy generates racially disparate outcomes. A key question is whether the\nunintended potential harm generated by that disparity is outweighed by the intended\npotential benefit of the policy.\nIn the realm of labor law, employment policies often require a high school diploma\nor passage of tailored exams to qualify for certain jobs. Those policies exemplify\nseemingly race-neutral policies that have resulted in racial disparity. In considering\nwhether those policies could be considered justified, the US Supreme Court has\nfocused on whether the policy under examination has sufficient evidence to justify its\nIn the realm of criminal law, there is no comparable body of US case law regarding\nunintentional disparate impacts of criminal justice policies on victims of crime. In fact,\nthere has been no prior evidence of victim mortality differences apparently caused by\nIncreased death rates of domestic violence victims\nany criminal sanction. Thus, it is unclear how US federal courts would rule if a\nConstitutional challenge to the Wisconsin mandatory arrest statute were filed by\nsurviving families of deceased African-American domestic violence victims whose\npartners had been arrested.\npeople of certain rights \"under color of\" statutes (or other acts or omissions). This code\nwas enacted to enforce the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which says (in\npart) that \"No State shall make or enforce any law which shall... deny to any person\nwithin its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" Whether equal protection is\ndefined by equal enforcement or equal effect is a theme of increasing discussion by\nlegal scholars, especially with respect to racially disparate effects of incarceration rates\nand the collateral consequences of incarceration. This has led to proposals for \"demo-\ngraphic impact statements\" regarding sentencing of offenders and to one state\n(Minnesota) reconsidering a potential change to its sentencing regime based on the\nprojection that it would differentially impact African-Americans (Reitz 2009).\nThat legislatures should consider the potential impact of legislation before enacting\nnew sentencing laws could apply equally to repealing existing arrest laws. The present\narticle can be seen as an example of what could be called a \"demographic victim\nimpact statement,\" as distinct from the case-by-case use of \"victim impact statements\"\nbefore sentencing (e.g., Davis and Smith 1994). Such statements are also relevant to\nproposals to repeal existing laws governing police conduct.\nPerhaps the key fact in any \"balancing test\" of evidence for or against a law that\nlegislatures or courts might consider is the lack of any discernible evidence of a\nlongevity benefit for victims, caused by the arrest of abusive partners. Using the\nstringently unambiguous criterion of victim life expectancy, none of the 22 moderator\nanalyses found any significant increase in longevity associated with arrest. Earlier\nfindings on short-term misdemeanor recidivism (Pate and Hamilton 1992; Sherman\nand Smith 1992) had demonstrated opposite effects for different subgroups, with\nvictims of employed abusers gaining a benefit of less violence from arrest, at the cost\nof victims of unemployed abusers experiencing a higher rate of domestic violence if the\nabusers had been arrested. When death is the test of benefit, the result is unambiguous:\nno victims appear to benefit.\nThe potential benefit of a general deterrent effect is much harder to examine, and\nremains untested with respect to overall mortality of domestic violence victims. Other\nbenefits, such as moral condemnation of domestic violence, also remain untested. If\nnothing else, the present findings may justify a shift in the burden of proof onto those\nwho would prefer to see mandatory arrest continued. For those who caution no policy\nchange (at least in Wisconsin) until there is more evidence, we must recall that the\nevidence on which the Wisconsin statute was based was a 6-month follow-up of an\nexperiment in Minnesota (Sherman and Berk 1984). For reasons of both internal and\nexternal validity, the present study covering 23 years arguably provides much more\npolicy-relevant evidence for Wisconsin.\nWhatever effect these findings may have on future research or policy decisions, they\nprovide strong evidence for proposals to test criminal sanctions in the same way that\nmedical treatments are tested. Evidence from controlled trials indicating a substantial\ncause of premature death for African-American victims should be taken seriously\nunless and until further strong evidence shows otherwise.\nL.W.
