The mental\nhealth field is an immensely complex professional field. To create access, the conventional education of mental health\nprofessionals compartmentalizes the field according to traditional professional boundaries. Personal\u00adprofessional expertise\nand user preference are thereby lost. Such personal experience is privileged in a pedagogy based on Giorgi's descriptive\nphenomenological method. Students learn systematically to describe a mental health phenomenon of their interest and\nreflect on this using each other's professional insights as well as relevant research literature. Phenomenological description\nand reflection are repeated several times in the curriculum. Kegan's subject\u00adobject theory of adult development explains\nhow this repetition may support transformation of insight in rather than an accumulation of information about mental health\nwork. The complexity of the mental health field thus emerges as a source of knowledge to exploit rather than merely a\nrugged landscape to navigate.\n",

Human existence colors the field's surface\nand determines its depth. The phenomena involved are as\nhuman as can be; everything in the mental health field is\nabout man and thus as complicated as we are (May, Angel, &\nEllenberger, 1958). This is reflected in the plethora of profes-\nsions and sciences that act and reflect on mental health in\nsome shape or form. Philosophy, theology, sociology, social\nwork, the psy-sciences, medicine, neurobiology, and others\ncontribute with influential perspectives on mental health;\nthese perspectives are influential, but not necessarily compat-\nible or mutually reducible. The history and theory of mental\nhealth is inflamed with debate and controversy, within and\nbetween the sciences, professions, and clients (cf. Coppock &\npolitics and ideology: At stake is not only what is healthy or\npathological, effective or relevant, but also what is normal or\nasocial, morally good or bad. In short, between the mutuality\nof human existence and mental health, and the related scien-\ntific-professional debates, emerges a field that is of over-\nwhelming complexity for any scientist, professional care\nworker, and educator.\nIn its effort to handle this complexity, professional higher\neducation of mental health workers creates access to this\nfield by excluding large parts of it and including only a few\npreferred areas--compartimentalization is preferred to inter-\ndisciplinarity (cf. Hillocks, 1999). Compartmentalization\nsupports established professional boundaries and is sustained\nby conventional pedagogy, that is, pedagogy that teaches\ninformation and skills based on accepted theory without spe-\ncific regard to the student's own experience from the field\nand his or her individual learning process (Dahlberg,\nwe present an alternative solution to accessing the mental\nhealth field in the higher education of adult students.\nPhenomenology provides both the rationale that undergirds\nour pedagogy and the research method that the students learn\nto use to advance the knowledge base of their practice.

The backdrop for this state curriculum was a\nmid-1990s report (the first of its kind in Norway) about the\nNorwegian mental health services that concluded that these\nservices had \"cracks at all levels.\" The treatment levels, from\nprevention and community services to institution-based\ntreatment and follow-up after discharge, were so weak that\nthe users of the services missed out on help needed, and the\nhealth care workers could not work satisfactorily (Norwegian\npointed out that the report could even have understated the\nsituation, missing out on problems such as one-sided (bio-\nmedical) views of mental illness and treatment, upholding\nsocietal us\u00adthem distinctions, and skewed power balances in\nface-to-face treatment situations (\u00d8stravik, 2008); all of\nthese are consistent with compartmentalization and conven-\ntional pedagogy. There was enough ground, in other words,\nfor the development of a new national curriculum in mental\nhealth work at the postgraduate level.\nThe state curriculum aims to improve and equalize the\nstandard of the mental health work competency of all profes-\nsional groups within Norway's health and social services.\nMental health is to be understood as a relational phenome-\nnon, making compulsory a relational perspective on the cli-\nent, and his or her social network and environment. The\ncurriculum emphasizes the relationship between and among\nworkers and clients. The psychiatric perspectives on mental\nillness and psychiatric nursing are thus to become subservi-\nent to a larger constellation bringing together the perspec-\ntives of many professions and approaches (such as social\nwork, psychomotor therapy, child care, and psychiatric nurs-\ning), and the services at various levels of organization within\nthe health care system. A vision of interdisciplinary collabo-\nration hence underpins the program.\nWith hindsight, we recognize that the state has also cre-\nated a platform for learning EBP. The best available research\nknowledge from various academic fields is to be applied by\nthe professional expert who, preferably together with col-\nleagues, judges the demands of the actual clinical situation in\nconcordance with the client's expressed preferences (Melnyk\n& Fineout-Overholt, 2005). But in contradiction to\nevidence-based medicine, where research-based knowledge\noften takes precedence over client experience, the state cur-\nriculum promotes EBP in which the client's individual\n\"resources, wishes and needs\" are the starting point for care\nand treatment (Forskrift til rammeplan for videreutdanning i\npsykisk helsearbeid, 2005, Section 2; authors' translation).\nClient collaboration, empowerment, and relational work\nbecome obligatory teaching topics. The client is placed at the\ncore of mental health work, along with interdisciplinarity\nand EBP.\nAlthough the main intention of the state curriculum is to\nensure a higher and stable standard of teaching countrywide,\nit leaves room for developing educational solutions depen-\ndent on regional circumstances. We have embraced this room\nbecause neither \"interdisciplinarity\" nor \"EBP\" reduce the\ncomplexity of the field sufficiently; there is still too much\nuncertainty for a postgraduate 1-year program. How does our\npedagogical approach simplify the complexity that remains\nafter the state curriculum?\nEmbedded Alternation of Description\nand Reflection in Our Curriculum\nOur postgraduate program at a university college in the\nsoutheast of Norway is the equivalent of 1 year's full-time\nstudy, divided equally over four semesters part-time. About\n35 adult students are enrolled annually. Almost all have prac-\ntical experience from a health or social care profession.\nMany of them return to higher education with the aim to sat-\nisfy personal\u00adprofessional or, in some cases, employer inter-\nests. The typical expectation is to acquire more and newer\ninformation about mental illness and how to treat it. However,\nwe consider that meeting the expectation of providing more\ninformation would imply a pedagogy that sustains compart-\nmentalization: It would force us to determine beforehand\nwhich themes to include and exclude in our program, regard-\nless of the enrolled student group. Furthermore, we do not\nregard our students and the professional field as separate\nunits that must be bridged by an information load. That is\nbecause our students are already part of the field. Therefore,\nwe see it as our task to teach students how to emerge from\ntheir embeddedness in this complex field--that is, how to\ntransform their way of knowing the field (Mayo, 2003).\nEach student brings into our program experiences at the\npersonal, relational, and organizational levels of work and\nlife. They are all much more simply human than otherwise\n(Sullivan, 1953, p. 32; italics in original) and, between them,\nthe students personify the mental health field as it transpires\nin Norway. These professional and personal experiences may\nnot be representative of how we prefer professionals to act\nand reflect after completion of their studies. But then, we do\nnot aspire to teach people what they already know; the stu-\ndents'existing knowledge rather forms a solid base on which\nto build our teaching. Therefore, we anchor our pedagogy in\nBongaardt et al. 3\nphenomenology. Phenomenology sets out to grasp our exis-\ntence from the inside out, where its passionate roots lie, on\nexactly those grounds that many of our students based their\nchoice of profession (cf. Jager, 1989). Rather than taking pri-\nmacy in rational accounts of life and living, phenomenology\nsuspends the use of concepts and brackets common-sense\nidioms. Within this so-called phenomenological reduction,\none withholds from existential claims: Instead of pondering\nthe reality status or truth of the phenomenon within the world\nof measurable biology, psychology, or sociology, phenome-\nnology opts to linger with how a phenomenon's form and\ncontent constitute meaning in the consciousness of the per-\nson who experiences it. However, it is not correct to con-\nclude that phenomenology is a mere solipsistic or solitary\nenterprise. It can involve a number of people; phenomeno-\nlogical researchers within psychology collect descriptions\nfrom various experiencing persons that, via systematic anal-\nysis, reveal the essence of the phenomenon (Giorgi, 2009).\nThe analysis process can also be a joint venture--and it is\nespecially in this way that phenomenology can reach out to\npedagogy (e.g., Dall'Alba, 2009; \u00d8stergaard, Dahlin, &\nWe apply Husserl's phenomenology as modified by\nGiorgi (2009) for use in psychology. Giorgi's phenomeno-\nlogical research method leads to descriptions of human phe-\nnomena relevant for psychology, such as learning, depression,\nor becoming a parent. These descriptions are preferably min-\nimally colored by theoretical or common-sense understand-\ning of the phenomenon at hand--Husserl spoke of returning\nto the \"thing itself.\" Giorgi's phenomenology doubles as a\nresearch method that our students learn to enable them to\nanalyze data derived from first-person experiences and a\nrationale that shapes our curriculum. We explicate this fur-\nther in what follows, where we describe the six-phase com-\nposition of one large part of our program, which we refer to\nas the critical-analytical part. The other parts of our program\npertain, respectively, to practicing relational skills and the\nnational laws and formal regulations of Norwegian mental\nhealth work. A full discussion of these two other parts is\nbeyond the scope of this article, but we sketch \"practicing\nrelational skills\" in our description of Phase 5.\nPhase 1: Describing Experiences of Good Mental\nHealth and Meeting Mental Illness\nCollection of data and analysis are related yet distinct parts\nof any research process. In our curriculum, we also distin-\nguish between these two parts. Early in the program, we col-\nlect the students' previous experiences of \"good mental\nhealth\" and \"meeting mental suffering.\" These two phenom-\nena represent key experiences in the mental health field at\nopposite ends of a long continuum. We invite students to\nwrite a response to the following stimuli: Please describe in\ndetail a situation in which you experienced good mental\nhealth; and Please describe in detail your first encounter\nwith mental suffering. There is no need to use theoretical\nconcepts or professional jargon in your descriptions. We ask\nfor \"experience\" to focus on a specific situation or encounter\nas a bearer of personal meaning and to avoid ending up with\ngeneric \"reflections\" that may have been formed later else-\nwhere. Through a detailed account, we hope to tease out\nexhaustive descriptions that make visible the smallest expe-\nrienced happenings (Stern, 2004). We use the \"good mental\nhealth\" descriptions as a base for a plenary discussion in\nclass about what mental health workers expect of their own\nmental health and what they expect service users to achieve\nthrough care or treatment (Tangvald-Pedersen & Bongaardt,\n2011). The \"meeting mental suffering\" descriptions typically\ncontain (in a class of 35) five to six main themes, such as\ndepression, family care, incest, therapeutic power balance,\nand professional uncertainty. These themes form the basis\nfor further analysis and hence are the starting point for the\ncritical-analytical part of the program, which runs until the\nlast day of teaching.\nWe divide the class into six interdisciplinary groups, and\nassign one theme to each group. Then the groups select four\nor five texts (from about 35) concerning their respective\nthemes. Next, each group analyzes these descriptions along\nclearly demarcated steps as recommended by Giorgi (2009).\nWe urge the students to refrain from theoretical or common-\nsense interpretation during the analysis and to dwell on the\ndata to let the phenomenon \"speak for itself.\" We explain\nthat this so-called \"phenomenological attitude\" is not unlike\n\"withholding judgment\" in therapeutic settings, which are\ndiscussed later in the study. Step 1 in the analysis consists of\neach group member reading carefully all selected descrip-\ntions to get a sense of the entire phenomenon at hand. In Step 2,\nthe students jointly mark each text every time they sense a\nshift in the meaning of the writer's subject matter, resulting\nin a division of each text into so-called meaning units. In\nStep 3, these meaning units are rewritten in a language typi-\ncal of the mental health field as understood by the group. The\nresult is that the texts under analysis are rewritten in similar\nand more easily comparable language. In Step 4, the result-\ning rewritten meaning units may now be clustered across the\ntexts forming core constituents of the phenomenon at hand.\nStep 5 involves the students writing a summary of what the\nphenomenon entails. In this summary, the phenomenon's\ncore constituents are related to each other, and as parts of a\nwhole form one meaning structure. This task completes the\ninitial phase.\nPhase 2: Reflecting Theoretically on a Theme\nWithin the Phenomenological Description\nHere, we leave the phenomenological reduction and open up\nfor reflection on the description. The three modes of reflec-\ntion presented are from a cause\u00adeffect, social context, and\n4 SAGE Open\nhuman-existential perspective. The groups choose one per-\nspective and are advised to use the library under supervision\nto find up-to-date research that, from their chosen perspec-\ntive of reflection, can shed further light on the phenomenon\nat hand. For instance, if the described phenomenon was \"liv-\ning in a family where one of the parents is diagnosed with a\nmajor depression,\" one of the following reflections is possi-\nble: Epidemiological research shows an increased risk of\nchildren becoming depressed later in life when one or two\nparents have a diagnosed major depression--a cause\u00adeffect\nperspective. Or qualitative research demonstrates that living\nwith a depressed parent may be experienced positively, lead-\ning the individual to spread a message of hope among others\nin the same situation--a human-existential perspective. Or it\nmay be pointed out that such family experiences are seldom\nreported in the popular media, which prefer to uphold a cul-\ntural image of happy nuclear families, implicitly evoking\nshame among those who do not meet such societal stan-\ndards--a (critical) social context perspective.\nThis phase is completed with a group paper, which must\nincorporate the phenomenological meaning structure and\nresearch-based reflection, and largely follow the IMRAD\nformat: introduction, method, result, and discussion (Day,\nPhase 3: Comments by a Professional Expert on\nthe Paper\nWhen we know the direction of the papers, we invite local\nmental health work experts to come to class and comment on\none paper each. The experts receive the papers two weeks\nbefore the classroom session. They are asked to offer a\nbroader perspective or deeper insight into the theme from\ntheir expert point of view.\nEach group presents its paper to the whole class, directly\nfollowed by the expert commentary. This situation easily\ngenerates discussion among everyone present--students,\nteachers, and experts--because reflections and descriptions\nfrom different professional, experiential, and research per-\nspectives may not easily align or may even be mutually\nexclusive and controversial. This is the first time in the pro-\ngram that the students engage in a discussion in an interdis-\nciplinary group of professionals about EBP that is anchored\nin first-person experiences. In doing so, many may still be\nembedded--unwittingly and exclusively--in the perspective\nof only the experiencing person, professional expert, or\nresearcher.\nPhase 4: Dialoguing Between the Rationale of\nEBP and Hands-On Practical Experience\nThrough the first three phases, the students slowly build up a\nsense of how three different sources of knowledge, that is,\npersonal experience, expert judgment, and research, mingle\nand merge in a mental health issue. Many students, however,\nmay still be embedded in one of these perspectives. In Phase\n4 of the program, we explicitly address EBP to help students\nemerge from this embeddedness. We present the \"who's\nfirst\" debate in the field; which of the three sources of knowl-\nedge should have primacy in daily practice. We also present\nthe \"best evidence\" debate, which takes place within each of\nthe knowledge source areas: Which research method has\nhighest status? Which expert judgment carries most weight?\nor Which user experience is trustworthy?\nThen, we ask the students to sum up the debate in an indi-\nvidual paper and take a stand based on their experiences with\npast clinical practice or their expectations about future clini-\ncal practice. They are encouraged to describe and analyze\nthese experiences or expectations using the phenomenologi-\ncal method. We offer individual supervision to help the stu-\ndent focus on a specific theme that somehow links his or her\nunderstanding of the EBP debate to what he or she considers\nrelevant in clinical practice. \"Who are you as a professional\nmental health worker, viewed from the angle of evidence-\nbased practice?\" \"Where do you stand, or prefer to stand?\"\nWhen we grade these papers, we are less interested in clear\noverviews of the EBP debate or univocal statements about\nwho the student is in a practice situation. We rather evaluate\nhow the student approaches the issue: To what extent is he or\nshe able to negotiate the ever-present ambiguity of practice\nsituations with the inherent uncertainty in the debates? In\nother words, does the student challenge the assumptions in\nthe debate or challenge the perception of himself or herself at\nwork, as a result of the tension between the two issues? We\ncontend that such an exploration of the edges of knowledge\npromotes the way of learning that is required in this field (see\nalso the \"Discussion\" section).\nPhase 5: Practicing EBP\nThe students have a 10-week placement in the field where\nthey can practice what they have learned so far. At this point,\nthe \"practicing skills\" part of our program becomes involved.\nThis runs parallel with Phases 1 to 4, and focuses on practic-\ning dialogue in student groups, using role-play, video, and\nwritten descriptions of actual situations from clinical prac-\ntice. These descriptions are analyzed in plenary class ses-\nsions, with special emphasis on human relational interaction,\nsuch as how to exert good judgment in the situation.\nBefore the clinical placement, the students learn a super-\nvision technique called \"reflecting team\" (Andersen, 1994).\nA student group is divided into three functional units: One\nperson who describes a challenging situation from work\nfrom a first-person perspective, one supervisor who guides\nthe process, and the rest of the group that first listens to the\ndescription and then reflects on it. The group is not to jump\nto conclusions or offer solutions. It simply reflects on the\nsituation described. The supervisor guards these boundaries\nand will not comment on content. After the explorations, the\nfirst person returns to the stage and conveys how his or her\nBongaardt et al. 5\nunderstanding has advanced as a result of the group's reflec-\ntions; he or she thus engages with the group in metacommu-\nnication about himself or herself in the situation at hand.\nWithin clinical practice, each student receives an obliga-\ntory assignment to define his or her learning goals, which is\nevaluated halfway and on completion of the placement. The\nlearning goals express how the student aims to shift focus\nbetween acting in the situation exercising relational compe-\ntency and reflecting on the situation using relevant theory.\nThe student is expected to use judgment to situate himself or\nherself correctly within the organization of the workplace\nand in relation to the client. Thus EBP--balancing expert\njudgment, theoretical knowledge, and clients' expressed\nneeds--is practiced and evaluated individually.\nPhase 6: Advancing EBP Through a Research and\nDevelopment (R&D) Project\nWork experiences are the starting point for an R&D project.\nGroups of four to six students are invited to write a summary\nof a phenomenon of their own interest stemming from a clin-\nical or work situation. This assignment is aimed at providing\na deeper understanding of this situation through theoretical\nreflection. The overall objective is to contribute to EBP in\nmental health work. The difference from Phases 1 and 2 is\nthat this phase implies collecting original data from respon-\ndents in the field. For practical reasons, the respondents are\nnot clients but other professionals (applying for approval\nfrom the medical research ethics committee is not feasible\nwithin the time frame of this phase). The data can be col-\nlected and analyzed using the phenomenological research\nmethod that we have introduced earlier in the program, but\nnot necessarily so. Students may also opt for a theoretical\nanalysis of, for example, an existing mental health promo-\ntion program or other interventions from the field. Strong\npersonal\u00adprofessional engagement with the chosen phenom-\nenon means that the papers may approach or even push the\nfrontiers of professional knowledge about the phenomenon\nat hand. We often point out that the students' daily involve-\nment in professional practice makes them preferred research-\ners or developers of projects about current pressing issues in\nthe field.\nThis six-step repeated alternation between experience-\nbased description and research-based reflection is the how of\nthe program. We discuss the \"how\" further below. The stu-\ndents determine the what of the program; they determine the\nthemes in focus during the various steps of the program, in\nwriting, practice, and supervision. As to the \"what,\" it is\nworth noting that we are still not able to cover all themes\nwithin mental health work as deemed relevant by the state\ncurriculum. And most certainly, we cannot cover all the\nthemes relevant to mental health work at large. Our phenom-\nenological approach, however, enables adult students to\naccess any phenomenon of relevance without being\nprimarily concerned with the traditional placement of this\nphenomenon in the professional mental health field. As long\nas they first systematically dwell with the phenomenon, and\nthen capitalize on each other's professional insights as well\nas library services to find relevant research literature and\nreviews, they can effectively cross knowledge boundaries\nthat previously may have constrained them. We assist adult\nstudents in formulating an experience-based entry point and\nto set out a path through the space of professional inquiry.\nThe complexity of the field thereby becomes a rich source of\nknowledge rather than a rugged landscape impossible to\nnavigate.\nDiscussion\nIn short summary, the rationale of our curriculum is as fol-\nlows: An individual's experience with a phenomenon is\nopened up by systematic phenomenological description\nstripped of theory or common sense, and closure is sought\nby reflection on the phenomenon guided by its essential\nfeatures--theory follows phenomenon, not vice versa. In\nstructuring this article, we have tried to stay true to this\nrationale. Above, we have described the background and\nstructure of our curriculum. In this section, we reflect on\nusing phenomenological description in higher education as\nwell as on using reflection as a means of promoting trans-\nformative learning in mental health work.\nSpiegelberg (1975), a philosopher and important historian\nand developer of phenomenology, describes in his book\nDoing Phenomenology how he toyed with the thought of a\npossible \"joint phenomenologizing\" and then actually tried\nout \"cooperative phenomenology\" (p. 24). At Washington\nbrought together between 7 and more than 20 persons to a\nworkshop. Each workshop was dedicated to the exploration\nand determination of essential structures of phenomena cho-\nsen beforehand or in the workshop. Spiegelberg's approach\nmay not have been as structured as we have described above\nin Phase 1. \"Steps,\" as in Giorgi's method, had then not been\ndefined as such. And the phenomenological analyses were to\nbe performed by the participants exclusively on their own\nexperiences. The vicarious phenomenological method,\nwhich makes possible the study of other persons' experi-\nences, was not as established as it is today. Nevertheless,\nsome of Spiegelberg's insights are important to note because\nof their pedagogical value. Retrospectively, he listed the pos-\nitive outcomes of cooperative phenomenology: It catalyzes\nnew perspectives; it sobers less-critical participants into\nclear communication; it \"intersubjectivizes,\" allowing for\nunivocal results in spite of a subjective base; it enriches the\njoint exploration, formulation, and reformulation of the\nessences of a phenomenon; and it attunes participants'aware-\nHe states that\n6 SAGE Open\none of the most meaningful and revealing occurrences may be\nwhen one of the partners suddenly exclaims \"aha\" in a tone of\nvoice indicating that he has not only just become aware of\nsomething new but also realizes that he has discovered what the\nSuch outcomes of group dwelling on a phenomenon are\nimportant contributions to any curriculum, including the cur-\nriculum we have described above. However, the strength of\nSpiegelberg's workshops may also have been their weak-\nness: Their focus on the process of doing \"joint phenomenol-\nogizing\" came with the price of a reduced focus on core\nexistential phenomena such as death, freedom, control, and,\nmost relevant here, health.\nIn the context of health care, the use of phenomenology in\nhigher education is discussed in Teaching the Practitioners\nin this anthology compares so-called \"narrative pedagogy,\"\ndeveloped by Diekelmann in the United States, with life-\nworld pedagogy, developed by Ekebergh in Sweden. Both\nways of teaching were developed from research for nursing\neducation. They have in common an emphasis on openness,\nwhich \"means that teachers and students make themselves\nreceptive and sensitive to the phenomenon of interest as it\npresents itself\" (Dahlberg et al., 2003, p. 34). An important\nphenomenon under study is the reciprocity between and\namong teachers and students, with a special focus on the role\nof the teacher. Dahlberg et al. emphasize that narratives,\nwhether oral or written stories, anecdotes or illustrations, can\ncapture challenging situations stemming from teaching prac-\ntice in nursing. They extract from these narratives that teach-\ners have a special responsibility to be sensitive to the\nstudent's learning process. The application of phenomenol-\nogy in these approaches thus seems to direct attention to nar-\nratives concerning the learning experience itself in higher\nhealth care education.\nThe emphasis in our own program is on first-person expe-\nriences with mental health that come from the student's per-\nsonal or professional life. That emphasis is possible because\nwe are privileged to work with adult students who all have\nsuch significant experiences. Naturally, our students are\nchallenged by our request--presented on their first day in the\nprogram--to capitalize on these experiences and at the same\ntime shortcut their reflex action of judging the clinical situa-\ntion, which has often been painstakingly acquired in the\nfield. The impact that our approach may have on students is\nmade explicit by narrative and lifeworld phenomenological\npedagogy as described above: We are aware of our responsi-\nbility as teachers carefully to balance the request for suspen-\nsion of judgment (openness) with practice-directed reflection\non the phenomenon under scrutiny (closure). A postmodern\n\"Open 24/7,\" as a celebration of differences or an opposition\nto traditional power relations (cf. Burbules & Rice, 1991), is\nnot an option for the higher education of professionals in the\nmental health field, as neither care worker nor client has such\nan option at hand at all times in real life beyond university\nHow then to achieve closure? When adopting the phe-\nnomenological attitude, students are submerged in the\ndescription of a phenomenon. But they must surface as well:\n\"It doesn't suffice that you unfold an experience. . . . The\nscientific act is to take responsibility to `milk' the descrip-\ntion, `dig' for its meaning, reflectively analyze, synthesize,\nor interpret the descriptions\" (Alapack, 2000, p. 7; italics in\noriginal). We understand reflection on phenomenological\ndescriptions as getting to know better what we know and\nwhat we do not know.\nsimplest of terms: What is subject must become object.\nPiaget's conceptual pair of assimilation and accommodation\nforms the inspiration of his approach (Lahey, Souvaine,\nKegan, Goodman, & Felix, 1988). It addresses how people\nstructure meaning in their world and how this structuring\nmay change throughout life. Kegan distinguishes different\nqualitative levels of complexity in meaning making; we are\nat any point in our life subject to (embedded in) one level of\ncomplexity, and we can make object (emerge from) a lower\nlevel of complexity. For instance, we can be subject to the\nideology that shapes our experience of self, which is firmly\nfenced off from another person's different ideology of self;\nhere, we do not easily open up to \"negotiation\" because we\ndo not have the metaview of our ideology that is required.\nBut then, we can take as object the way another person's\nfeelings and emotions influence our own, always letting our\nsense of self guide these feelings and emotions.\nWe have object; we are subject. We cannot be responsible for,\nor in control of, or reflect upon what is subject. . . . \"Object\"\nrefers to those elements of our knowing or organization that we\ncan reflect on, handle, look at, be responsible for. (Kegan, 1994,\nThe transformation from subject to object is often gradual\nand comes in discernible intermediate stages: We get to\nknow what we do not know slowly, only step-by-step adjust-\ning our overall way of making meaning to new situation-\nbound insights.\nKegan's (1994) main point in In Over Our Heads: The\nMental Demands of Modern Life is that society has defined\ncurricula for parenting, partnering, conflict resolution, adult\neducation, and other arenas of life that demand a complexity\nof mind that may be of a higher level than a large proportion\nof the population has reached so far. In our curriculum, we\ndeliberately use the alternation of complexities as a catalyst\nfor learning. As described in the six phases above, we repeti-\ntively create and help dissolve the students' sense of being\n\"in over their heads.\" Reflection is imperative if one is to\nlearn; it is a structural property of the learning process. But\nthe content of the reflection is inherent in the content of the\ndescription, which is different in each phase described above.\nBongaardt et al. 7\nTherefore, we give students a choice about how they sub-\nstantiate their reflections--we cannot prescribe what only\nthey can account for (see Phases 2, 4, 5, and 6). In our cur-\nriculum, students may experience closure every time subject\nbecomes object, but all the while, they are creating new sub-\nject matter to start pondering. Hence, we speak of a repeated\nalternation of description and reflection.\nConclusion\nWe argue for the primacy of simplifying complexity in the\nhigher education of mental health workers by appropriating\ndescriptive phenomenology. Such simplification derives in the\nfirst instance from a curriculum decreed by the Norwegian gov-\nernment and in the second instance from a \"self-simplification\"\nbased on the students'own experiences with life and work (cf.\nPattee, 1972). While a conventional pedagogy may emphasize\nwhat students should be informed about, we focus on how stu-\ndents can transform their way of making meaning in their\nPhenomenological pedagogy avoids traditional compartmen-\ntalization of the field. It rather profits from the field's com-\nplexity by treating it as a rich source of knowledge. The adult\nstudent's personal\u00adprofessionally experienced sense of rele-\nvance forms the starting point for navigating the field with the\npurpose to contextualize experiences and deepen understand-\ning. This promotes a work practice that integrates personal,\nrelational, and research sources of knowledge, and endorses\nthe interdisciplinary nature of the field. Ours is a way of teach-\ning that relies on adult students being grounded in their profes-\nsional identity yet willing to float freely during periods of life.\nThe clients they work with, who may have been floating freely\nin life longer than desired, demand and deserve that.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAlapack, R.
