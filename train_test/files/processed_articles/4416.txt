Serum cholinesterase\n(ChE) concentration is increased in patients\nwith fatty liver, but few studies have inves-\ntigated the direct association between gly-\ncaemic disorder and ChE and other markers\nof fatty liver. A single, small-scale study\nfound that ChE concentrations were higher\nin patients with non-alcoholic steatohepati-\ntis (NASH), which was also associated with\ndiabetes.9\nThe aim of this preliminary study, there-\nfore, was to examine the hypothesis that\nfatty liver (diagnosed via ultrasonography)\nand ChE are associated with HbA1c.\nSubject and methods\nStudy population\nThis cross-sectional retrospective analysis\nincluded workers or retirees aged between\nannual medical check-up as part of the\nhealthcare system at Jikei University\nHospital Health Care Centre, Tokyo,\n(i) treatment with hypoglycaemic agents;\n(ii) hepatitis B surface antigen positive; (iii)\nhepatitis C antibody positive; and (iv) etha-\nAll participants provided written\ninformed consent prior to enrolment in the\nstudy. The study was approved by the\nInstitutional Review Board of Jikei\nUniversity School of Medicine and carried\nout in accordance with the Declaration of\nHelsinki.\nUltrasonography\nExperienced technicians, who were unaware\nof the aims of the study and blinded to\nlaboratory findings, evaluated fatty liver via\nabdominal ultrasonography. All medical\nsonographers were registered with the\nJapan Society of Ultrasonics in Medicine\nand had been trained at Jikei University\nHospital. Study-specific fatty liver using\nultrasonography scores (FLUS) were\nassigned as follows: 2 points, moderate or\nsevere fatty liver (deep attenuation, vascular\nblurring, a fatty bandless sign and/or a\nbrighter liver compared with the\nliver, focal fatty sparing10 and/or high\npoints, normal liver.\nData collection\nMedical history and lifestyle information\nincluding alcohol consumption and smoking\nwere documented by a professional nurse.\nSubject height and weight were recorded\nwith subjects dressed in lightweight indoor\nclothes, and body mass index (BMI) calcu-\nlated as weight/height2 (kg/m2). Waist cir-\ncumference while undressed and standing\nwas measured (to the nearest cm) using a\nnonelastic soft tape at the umbilical level\nwhen the navel was between the lowest rib\nand the level of the iliac crest, or midway\nbetween the lowest rib and the level of the\niliac crest. Blood pressure (BP) was mea-\nsured using a standard mercury manometer\nafter 5 min rest in a sitting position.\nFollowing the blood pressure measurement,\nvenous blood specimens (12 ml for serum\nand 1.8 ml for plasma) were drawn between\nfast. Plasma and serum were stored at 10\u00ad\n15C prior to analysis within 4 h.\nLaboratory analyses\nFasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentra-\ntions were determined using the glucose\noxidase immobilized oxygen electrode\nmethod (GA08III; A&T Corporation,\nKanagawa, Japan).14 HbA1c (NGSP\nequivalent value)15 was determined with\nhigh-performance liquid chromatography\nJapan). Enzymatic methods were used to\nanalyse serum high-density-lipoprotein\ncholesterol (HDL-C) (MetaboLead HDL-\nC; Kyowa Medex, Tokyo, Japan), low-\ndensity-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)\nand triglyceride (TG) (Cholestest LDL and\nCholestest TG, respectively; Sekisui\nMedical, Tokyo, Japan), and aspartate ami-\nnotransferase (AST) and alanine amino-\ntransferase (ALT) (AST-J2 and ALT-J2,\nrespectively; Wako Pure Chemical\nIndustries, Osaka, Japan). Serum ChE and\ng-glutamyltransferase (GGT) levels were\ndetermined using a butyrylthiocholine\niodide method and g-glutamyl-3-carboxy-4-\nnitroanilide method (both Wako Pure\nChemical Industries, Ltd, Osaka, Japan),\nrespectively. Serum hepatitis B virus surface\nantigen and hepatitis C virus antibody (3rd\ngeneration) were quantified by chemilumin-\nescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA)\n(Architect i2000SR; Abbott Japan, Tokyo,\nJapan). Serum C-reactive protein (CRP)\nand uric acid were quantified by latex agglu-\ntination immunoassay (Iatro CRP-EX,\nMitsubishi Chemical Medicine\nCorporation, Tokyo, Japan) and uricase\nperoxidase method (Wako Pure Chemical\nIndustries), respectively. All samples were\nanalysed in the same laboratory at Jikei\nUniversity Hospital.\nStatistical analyses\nSubjects were stratified into sex-specific\nquintile groups by HbA1c concentration\noff points are applied to both men and\nwomen in clinical practice, but subjects were\nstratified by sex in the present study in order\nto permit analyses of possible sex-specific\ndifferences. Participant characteristics were\npresented as mean \u00c6 SD for continuous\nvariables and proportions (%) for dichot-\nomous variables. The association between\nHbA1c and all other variables was evaluated\nas a trend-test with linear regression models\nfor continuous variables and logistic regres-\nsion models for dichotomous variables.\nIn addition, the numbers of individuals\nevaluated for ChE and FLUS were tested\nwith the Jonckheere\u00adTerpstra test. Multiple\nregression models stratified by BMI and age\nwere further used to evaluate determinants\nof HbA1c. Subjects were stratified according\nto median BMI and age for the linear\nregression analysis. The analysis was also\nperformed with stratifications for HbA1c\nquintiles in order to test for differences in\nassociations between those with lower and\nthose with higher quintiles.\nStata statistical package version 10.1\n(StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas,\nUSA) was used for statistical analysis.\nP-values < 0.05 were considered statistically\nsignificant.\nResults\nsubjects were excluded (receiving hypogly-\ncaemic agents n \u00bc 248; alcohol consumption\nn \u00bc 51; hepatitis C positive n \u00bc 29; missing\nHbA1c data n \u00bc 56).

Serum ChE levels\nDemographic and clinical characteristics of\nthe subjects stratified by sex and HbA1c\nquintile are given in Tables 1a and 1b.\nIn both men and women, there was a\nsignificant graded increase in BMI, mean\nage and FPG from quintile 1 to quintile 5\nData regarding the metabolic syndrome\nand hepatic function markers are shown in\nTables 1a and 1b. Waist circumference, TG,\nand systolic and diastolic BP showed a\nsignificant graded increase, and HDL-C\nwas significantly decreased from quintile 1\nto quintile 5 in both men and women\n(P < 0.001 for each trend). In addition,\nthere were significant graded increases in\nAST and ALT from quintile 1 to quintile 5\nin both men and women (P < 0.001 for each\ntrend).\nLinear regression analysis of subjects\nstratified according to median BMI\n(22.3 kg/m2) indicated that FLUS score was\nsignificantly associated with HbA1c inde-\npendent of BMI in the total study popula-\nTables 2a and 2b).

Fatty liver\nmarkers within or slightly above the upper\nlimit of the normal range have been shown to\nbe pathogenic, and fatty metamorphosis of\nhepatocytes leads to insulin resistance,16\u00ad18\nwith optimum levels of metabolic markers\nbeing below mean values in healthy subjects\nliver markers are not included among the\ncriteria of the metabolic syndrome, however.\nWe therefore compared the criteria of\nthe metabolic syndrome with fatty liver\nmarkers in terms of glycaemic status.\nThere is a lack of consensus regarding the\nideal marker for glycaemic status, particu-\nlarly in the postprandial state. Although\nelevated FPG increases medical care costs in\npatients with impaired fasting glucose,23\npost-challenge hyperglycaemia is associated\nwith death and macrovascular complica-\ntions even before the development of overt\ndiabetes.24 Slightly elevated HbA1c is useful\nas it suggests a history of slightly raised\nplasma glucose, especially in the postpran-\ndial state,25 and this has been found to be\nsignificantly associated with increased mor-\ntality even in people without diabetes.26\u00ad28\nAlthough HbA1c is an internationally\nrecognised marker of glycaemic status,29 it\nis not included among the criteria for the\nmetabolic syndrome.\nPlasma ChE is a pseudocholinesterase\nfound primarily in the liver, and it is\nincreased in patients with fatty liver, neph-\nrotic syndrome, Grave's disease and hepa-\ntocellular carcinoma.30\u00ad33 In the present\nstudy, only two individuals had nephrotic\nsyndrome and their exclusion did not\ninfluence the results. Patients with overt\nand untreated Grave's disease and hepato-\ncellular carcinoma were not included in the\nannual health check-up, and were therefore\nnot enrolled in the study cohort. ChE is\nknown to decrease in patients with hypothy-\nroidism, liver cirrhosis, fulminant hepatitis\nor sepsis, and those undergoing kidney dia-\nlysis or who are pregnant.32,34 Patients with\nthese conditions were also not included in\nthe annual health check-up programme.\nElevated ChE was associated with HbA1c\nin subjects in quintiles 1 \u00fe 2 in the present\nstudy. This may lead to worsening of HbA1c\nstatus, as indicated by the association\nbetween HbA1c and FLUS points in quin-\nIt has been suggested that biochemical\nfatty liver markers be included among the\ncriteria of the metabolic syndrome,35 but\nprevious fatty liver indices did not include\nChE.7,36 Elevated ChE was significantly\nassociated with raised HbA1c in the present\nstudy.\nData from the present study indicate an\nincrease in ALT from quintile 1 to quintile 5.\nALT is used in the scoring system during\nselection of patients for liver biopsy,37 and\nfor scoring NASH and the risk of incident\ndiabetes.36,38 Elevated ALT can be used to\npredict the onset of type 2 diabetes and the\nmetabolic syndrome even within the upper\nlimit of the normal range,19,20 and increased\nALT within the normal range is associated\nwith cardiovascular risk factors independent\nof obesity.21 A Korean study found a direct\nassociation between aminotransferase con-\ncentration (even within the normal range)\nand mortality from liver disease.22\nNevertheless, ChE and FLUS were shown\nto be better markers of fatty liver than ALT\nin our present study.\nOvert NAFLD has been identified as a\nrisk factor for type 2 diabetes in Japanese\nsubjects.39 Magnetic resonance imaging is\nthe most reliable noninvasive imaging\nmethod for assessing intrahepatic\ncontent,40,41 but ultrasonography is the\nmost commonly available resource and\ngives a high degree of certainty during\ndiagnosis of fatty liver in large cohort\nstudies.13,42 Quantitative techniques aimed\nat evaluation of fatty liver by ultrasonog-\nraphy have yet to be established.\nUltrasonography has been used to assess\nthe presence or absence of fatty liver and to\ndetermine the proportion of subjects with\nNAFLD.7 There is a positive correlation\nbetween the degree of fatty changes and an\nincrease in echogenicity,11 however, and we\ntherefore attempted to evaluate fatty liver\nquantitatively via FLUS. A bright liver,\nfocal fatty sparing or high hepato\u00adrenal\necho contrast indicates mild fatty liver, as\n20% cannot be reliably detected by ultra-\nsonography,11 ChE may be a useful marker\nin these subjects. Fatty liver diagnosed with\nultrasonography (FLUS) was significantly\nassociated with raised HbA1c in higher\nquintiles in the present study.\nA slight elevation in ChE level was\nassociated with glycaemic status as indicated\nby lower HbA1c in the current study (quin-\ntiles 1 \u00fe 2), whereas FLUS scores were\nimportant in higher quintiles (3 \u00fe 4 \u00fe 5\ncombined). This result is in line with the\nfindings of others,5 and may explain why\nthere is no study reporting that fatty liver\ndetected by ultrasonography is generally\nassociated with the full spectrum of HbA1c.\nThe present study is limited by the fact\nthat the data were not sufficient to provide\ncause\u00adeffect analysis due to its cross-sec-\ntional nature. It is not possible to determine\nwhether higher HbA1c leads to more severe\nfatty liver/ChE or whether higher fatty liver\nscores/ChE result in higher HbA1c.\nLongitudinal studies are required to clarify\nthis issue. The present study did not include\nspecific details of antihypertensive drug\ntreatment. In addition, patients with undiag-\nnosed or untreated diabetes may have been\nincluded in our analysis as we did not\nperform oral glucose tolerance testing.\nAlthough smoking is a known risk factor\nfor diabetes,43 smoking (self-reported infor-\nmation) was not significantly associated\nwith HbA1c in the present study. In add-\nition, FLUS and ChE data were not avail-\nable for all participants. It is not possible,\ntherefore, to exclude the possibility that\nthese issues might impact on our findings.\nIn conclusion, our study shows that a\nslight elevation in plasma ChE is correlated\nwith lower HbA1c quintile, while FLUS is\nimportant thereafter (independent of BMI\nand age). A change in marker from ChE to\nFLUS was observed with increasing HbA1c.\nBoth ChE and FLUS are significantly\ncorrelated with HbA1c level and are there-\nfore useful markers, although their contri-\nbution may be at different ends of the\nHbA1c distribution. These markers may\nenable early intervention, which is known\nto have a beneficial effect on the improve-\nment of fatty liver.44\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nData analysis, writing of the manuscript and\npublication were supported by Japanese Grants-\nin-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI\nCulture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan.\n"
