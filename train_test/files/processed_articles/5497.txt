We collected Saddam's public speeches and interviews\nin private, we garnered a comparison corpus of 58,000 words. These text-sets were processed to locate markers of\nconflict, control and complexity. We find that Saddam's hostile, conflict-oriented worldview and his perception of\nhimself as a significant political actor was consistent across public and private domains. The major difference between\nthese spheres was his more complex private view of international affairs compared to his more definitive public stance.\nOur evidence supports the notion that private beliefs can be inferred from the public speech of political leaders.\n",

Saddam discussed his views of\nthe US, Israel, Iran and other national security issues in\ntranscripts now available to researchers. While Saddam\nspoke extensively in public speeches during his decades\nin power, there had few means by which to judge whether\nthese were merely manipulative communications \u00ad until\nnow.\nUsing automated content analysis, we compared\nSaddam's public and private speech by looking for markers\nof conflict, control and complexity as identified in well-\nestablished coding schemes. We collected Saddam's public\nspeeches and interviews on international affairs from\nFrom the captured transcripts, we garner a set of private\ntext (58,000 words) to compare to this public corpus.

Politicians say one\nthing in public and another in private. If public presenta-\ntions differ from private realities, and if private realities\ndrive behavior, then the value of analyzing public speech is\nThe concern is especially apposite when dealing with\ndistinctive personalities at the apex of repressive regimes.\nLeaders of rogue regimes are disproportionately involved\nin conflict and disproportionately difficult to understand\n(Londono, 2013). Closed regimes give us public speech,\nbut little information on private deliberations. The question\nof whether we can believe what dictators say in public has\nbeen a key problem in US foreign policy for many years.\nFor several decades it was Saddam Hussein of Iraq who\ncaused this question to be raised most urgently. The pro-\ngenitor of a rolling series of wars, Saddam harbored unclear\nintentions derived from opaque motives (Duelfer and\nDyson, 2011). The closed nature of his regime revealed lit-\ntle knowledge of his private reckoning. The world commu-\nnity often had just the public face of the regime to use in\npredicting likely behavior.\nPsychology gives us two broad views on public versus\nprivate beliefs: intra-situational consistency and impression\nmanagement (Tetlock and Manstead, 1985). If the intra-\nsituational consistency position is correct, then political\nfigures reveal their sincere beliefs in all contexts, and these\nbeliefs are stable across time, topic and audience. If the\nimpression management hypothesis is accurate, speech is\ncalibrated to achieve some strategic end. Revealed beliefs\nof the political figure will vary across time, topic, and audi-\nwith the reality probably somewhere in between. Whether\npublic speech reveals private beliefs is ultimately an empir-\nical question.\nThe question is hard to test, though. Politicians speak a\nlot in public, but we have few records of their private\nspeech. Adolf Hitler had his dinnertime conversations,\nwhich ranged across politics, history, and the arts, tran-\nRoper, 1953). John F Kennedy and Lyndon B Johnson had\ntaping systems installed in the White House and the tran-\nscripts of these recordings provide valuable insights into\nKennedy's deliberations during the Cuban Missile Crisis\nmethods of persuasion (Beschloss, 1998). Infamously,\nRichard M Nixon kept tapes that showed his involvement\nin the cover-up of the break-in at the Watergate complex\n(Kutler, 1998). His national security advisor, Henry\nKissinger, recorded his telephone calls as he practiced\nhigh-level personal diplomacy (Burr, 1999).\nFollowing the Nixon catastrophe few Western politi-\ncians have, to our knowledge, thought it wise to install\nno such inhibitions. After the collapse of the Saddam\nregime, US forces discovered a vast trove of recordings\nand transcripts. Archivists translated, transcribed, and cat-\negorized the recordings (Woods et al., 2011).\nApproximately 2,300 separate tapes feature Saddam as a\nprimary participant, and most of these are records of\nRevolutionary Command Council, Council of Ministers\nor ad hoc National Security group meetings. Whilst the\ntapes cover the vast majority of the years Saddam held\noffice, the distribution is uneven, with \u00ad unfortunately \u00ad\nconfrontation with the US.\nWhy would a leader as paranoid and secretive as Saddam\nmake the tapes? It was important to him to have records of\nwhat his ministers had promised. In the highly centralized\nBa'ath system Saddam and his closest aides made decisions\non an extremely wide range of topics and he wanted some\nway to keep track of their discussions. In January 1981\nSaddam was at the end of a particularly frustrating series of\ntelephone calls with his general staff, and became exasper-\nated at the confusion. `From now on let us record all tele-\nphone calls', he ordered (Woods et al., 2011: 7). On the\ntapes, Saddam speaks candidly on sensitive subjects \u00ad he\ndid not expect the records to become publicly available\nThe captured tapes have been exploited in a fascinating\nseries of qualitative studies, investigating Saddam's private\ndeliberations on nuclear weapons (Brands and Palkki,\nstrategic view of the United States (Brands and Palkki,\n2012) and his conduct of internal Iraqi affairs (Sassoon,\nSome initial conclusions have been offered on the pub-\nlic/private question. David Palkki, acting director at the\nConflict Records Research Center in Washington DC,\nwhich holds the Saddam tapes, finds that `when it came to\nhis worldview, what Saddam said in public was very simi-\nlar to what he said in private. Although Americans often\ndiscount what dictators say in public, Saddam was gener-\nally sincere in his public rhetoric' (Palkki, 2011: see also\nsystematically in this paper.\nPrivate text\nOur main source of private text is the volume The Saddam\nTapes, containing more than 300 pages of transcripts of\nmeetings where Saddam was a primary participant. The\neditors of the volume cut some passages from the published\ntranscripts: `In theory, the less excised from a transcript, the\nbetter the reader can understand the context of the conver-\nsation. In practice, many of the translations contain ram-\nbling, tangential discussions or otherwise distracting and\nrelatively unimportant material' (Woods et al., 2011: xi).\nThe editors selected transcripts that related to major\nnational security matters; in particular, the US, Israel, the\nIran\u00adIraq war, the first Persian Gulf War and the sanctions\nDyson and Raleigh 3\nregime of the United Nations. These sampling decisions are\nconsistent with our research aims.\nTo supplement this material, one of the present authors\nmade a research visit to the Conflict Records Research\nCenter, at the National Defense University, to work with\nthe full volume of records. Additional material featuring\nSaddam speaking on topics of interest was collected. We\nrendered all of this material into electronic form and thereby\nconstructed a database of Saddam's private speech, totaling\nPublic text\nsecurity topics. The major source for this text was the\nForeign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS), maintained\nby the US State Department as, essentially, a pre-internet\nmethod of monitoring foreign news services. FBIS carried\nmajor addresses and interviews given by Saddam until its\ndiscontinuation in 1995. It is archived on micro-fiche in\nmost university libraries. We supplemented the FBIS mate-\nrial with speeches collected from internet archival sources\nthe private text.\nContent analysis procedures\nWe applied a quantitative content analysis to Saddam's\npublic and private speech. The underlying assumption was\nthat the words people speak are related to the thoughts they\nhave, and the thoughts they have are related to how they\nderived from two content analysis schemes: the `Leadership\nTrait Analysis' approach developed by Margaret G\nHermann (Hermann, 2005) and the `Verbs in Context\nSystem'for operational code analysis developed by Stephen\nG Walker and Mark Schafer (Schafer and Walker, 2006).\nBoth schemes have been automated for use with the content\nanalysis software engine Profiler Plus.1 Automated coding\nremoves the possibility of human variability in coding deci-\nsions and so eliminates inter-rater reliability concerns.\nVariables\nWe used four variables that capture key elements of a polit-\nical figure's worldview. These beliefs and personality traits\nhave proven especially fecund in previous analyses and\nbear upon central issues of an actor's strategic approach to\ninternational politics.\nImage of other is a variable from the operational code\nscheme (termed the first philosophical belief in that research\nprogram). The focus is the hostility or friendliness of both\npolitical life in general and of specific actors within the\npolitical universe. The variable represents the optimism or\npessimism of the agent about their environment, and has\nbeen likened to the idealism/realism split in international\nScores on this variable are created by coding verbs in the\nagent's speech referring to actions taken by others as either\nhostile and threatening, or friendly and cooperative.\nCalculating the balance between the types of verbs pro-\nduces a scale where lower scores indicate a more hostile\nview of the other.\nImage of self, also drawn from the operational code\nscheme (termed the first instrumental belief), is the coun-\nterpoint to image of other, and measures whether the agent\nsees their own behavior as hostile or cooperative. The focus\nis on verbs describing actions taken by the individual and\ntheir state and, again, lower scores indicate more hostile\ndispositions.\nBelief in ability to control events represents the degree\nto which the leader under evaluation sees themself and\nthe state they lead as an influential actor in world politics.\nLeaders who score higher on this measure see the world\nas more malleable and so tend to discount barriers to the\nachievement of goals. They have been found to prefer\nproactive policies in service of ambitious goals (Dyson,\n2006). Leaders who score lower perceive material, his-\ntorical and social forces as determinate. These individu-\nals tend to be reactive and risk averse. The belief in\nability to control events score is created by identifying\nverbs in the individual's speech related to action taken by\nthe leader or their state as a percentage of the total verbs\nin a text sample. Higher scores indicate greater percep-\ntion of control.\nConceptual complexity refers to the sophistication of a\nleader's cognitive architecture (Suedfeld, 1992). Individuals\nhigher in complexity have a differentiated view of the\nworld, with multiple schemata at different levels of gener-\nality that are integrated into a complex information pro-\ncessing system. These individuals prefer inductive\ninformation processing, tend to require more information\nprior to making a decision, and often revisit previous deci-\nsions and the premises upon which they were made.\nIndividuals who score lower on this measure, in contrast,\ntend toward more definitive, black-and-white cognitive\nstyles. These leaders rely heavily on a few core beliefs and\nprinciples at a high level of generality and process incom-\ning information deductively, selectively perceiving or mod-\nifying new information so that it remains consistent with\ntheir existing cognitive predispositions. Lower complexity\nleaders have a tendency to divide the outside world into\nrelatively straightforward categories \u00ad such as friend and\nenemy, good and evil \u00ad and rarely revisit past decisions\nwords related to higher complexity (i.e., approximately,\npossibility, trend) and low complexity (absolutely, cer-\ntainly, definitely) and reports the balance. Higher scores\nindicate more complex worldviews.\n4 Research and Politics \nResults\nFor ease of interpretation, we normalized Saddam's scores to\na separately constructed reference group of world political\nleaders with a mean of 0.50 and a standard deviation of 0.10,\nand plotted the results graphically, as shown in Figures 1\u00ad4\n(see Appendix for raw scores for Saddam and reference\ngroup).2 Examining Saddam's overall worldview (all material\non all topics coded), we see congruence between private and\npublic beliefs on each element other than conceptual com-\nplexity (see Figure 1). Saddam held a resolutely hostile image\nof the political universe (image of other) and a preference for\nnon-cooperative strategies (image of self). He exhibited pub-\nlic confidence in his ability to shape events, and this was even\nmore pronounced in private. He exhibited higher complexity\nin private than in public, crossing the boundary between low\nand high as established by the world leader reference group.\nWe separated material where Saddam was speaking\nabout his three great enemies, the US (Figure 2), Iran\n(Figure 3) and Israel (Figure 4). His beliefs about these\nstates are strikingly similar to his overall worldview: hos-\ntile images of self and other, high perceptions of control,\nand variable levels of complexity. There are, however,\nsome notable differences. Saddam's most hostile beliefs\nconcern Israel, and he privately perceived lower ability to\ninfluence their actions, whilst expressing a greater per-\nceived control in public \u00ad perhaps evidence of an impres-\nsion management strategy.\nSaddam's beliefs concerning the United States are par-\nticularly interesting. He described the US as more hostile\nwhen speaking in public than when discussing policy in\nprivate (image of other). Conversely, he portrayed Iraq's\nactions in public as less conflict-oriented than when strate-\ngizing privately (image of self). Saddam displayed a higher\nlevel of conceptual complexity when speaking about the\nUnited States to colleagues in private settings, and talked\nabout the US in more definitive terms in public. Other than\ncomplexity, though, these are differences of degree rather\nImage of self Image of other Belief can control events Conceptual complexity\nNormalized trait score\nPrivate Public Reference Group Mean\nFigure 1.

Saddam's view of the US.\nDyson and Raleigh 5\nthan kind: Saddam maintained hostile views of the US in\nboth public and private (see Brands and Palkki, 2012, for a\ndetailed discussion of Saddam's view of the US).\nInferring private beliefs from public\nspeech\nThese data give us two ways to summarize the public/pri-\nvate congruence in Saddam's worldview. First, does\nSaddam's placement relative to the reference group vary\ndepending upon the setting of his comments? For example,\nif he scores as having a hostile worldview in public, do his\nprivate comments reveal similar hostility? Second, how\ngreat is the quantitative distance between his public and pri-\nvate scores, regardless of `high' or `low' categorizations?\nConsidering the four elements of Saddam's worldview\nacross the four readings of it (overall, US, Iran and Israel)\ngives us sixteen comparisons of public/private beliefs. In\nthirteen of the sixteen public/private dyads, Saddam's rela-\ntionship to the reference group mean (above or below) is\nconsistent from public to private. In terms of quantitative\ndistance between the public and private scores, thirteen of\nthe sixteen dyads maintain a one standard deviation or less\ndistance.3\nIn the case of Saddam, then, we see a similar political\nactor in public and private most of the time. Researchers\narmed with content analysis technologies now have some\nevidence showing that beliefs revealed publicly match\nthose concealed privately (see also Renshon, 2009).\nSaddam is revealed as showing broad intrapsychic con-\nsistency \u00ad he was largely the same political actor speaking\nin private to his colleagues as in public before a crowd.4\nSome evidence of impression management is apparent,\nperhaps for political advantage or as an artifact of the\nImage of self Image of other Belief can control events Conceptual complexity\nNormalized trait score\nPrivate Public Reference Group Mean\nFigure 4.

Saddam's higher complexity\nwhen speaking in private is the prime example of this in\nour study.\nOf course, impression management may take place both\nin front of a crowd and behind closed doors: Saddam may\nhave been performing for his advisers in private and for a\ncrowd in public. This would suggest that a third set of data,\nperhaps diary entries or similarly intimate materials, would\nbe needed to capture the `true' private Saddam. This is a\nquestion of how we define `private'. Our argument is that\nwe see Saddam displaying broadly the same political\nworldview in public rhetorical and private policy making\nsettings, with the exceptions noted above.\nComparing public and private worldviews is not, of\ncourse, the same as being able to predict the actions of\npolitical leaders. These are baseline propensities Saddam\nexhibited when thinking about the world, and diagnosing\na worldview is far from foreseeing an action on a spe-\ncific date directed at a specific target. Worldviews of\npolitical actors interact with an array of other factors\nboth internal and external to the state in producing\naction. One can, for example, hold a hostile belief toward\na state but have no intention of acting upon it, for pru-\ndential reasons.\nWe need additional investigations focused upon the\nsmall population of political actors for whom we have tran-\nscripts of private deliberations: Hitler, Kennedy, Johnson,\nNixon and Kissinger. We believe that students investigating\nhow politicians seek to shape public opinion will find much\nto mull over in the findings that public speech is sincere and\npredictive of private beliefs rather than manipulative in\nnature. Finally, we hope that more leaders in both demo-\ncratic and authoritarian political systems follow Saddam's\nexample of recording their deliberations for posterity so\nthat we can continue to judge the sincerity of political lead-\ners when they speak in public.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any funding agency\nin the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\nNotes\ncienceautomation.com.\n2. The charts (Figures 1\u00ad4) show the four elements of world-\nview along the horizontal axis, and the scores on each trait\nalong the vertical axis. The score for each dimension of\nworldview generated from public text is represented by a\ndiamond, the score from private text by a circle. The hor-\nizontal line is the reference group mean, so scores above\n(below) the line are higher (lower) than this mean. The vari-\nables and their measures are of course separate from one\nanother, so the charts show four columns in one chart (one\nfor each element of worldview) rather than a scatterplot\nwhere a trend line can be drawn horizontally to connect the\ndata points.\n3. On these criteria, then, Saddam's public beliefs matched\nchances to do so. Readers may wish to apply a different\nstandard of congruence, or to compare Saddam's beliefs to\na different reference group or particular political leader. To\nfacilitate this, we have included the raw trait scores in a sum-\nmary table contained in an appendix to this article.\n4. Saddam, though, was a member of several sub-categories\nof political leader, including dictators and very possibly\npersons with diagnosable mental pathologies. This is to say\nthat more such analyses are necessary before reaching firm\nconclusions on the degree to which public speech reveals\nprivate beliefs.\nReferences\nBeschloss M (1998) Taking Charge: The Johnson White House\nTapes.
