For other conditions, up to 10 times more\ndeaths were identified from multiple-cause data than from underly-\ning-cause data. The 10 leading causes of death differed when using\nthe 2 types of data.\nConclusions: Whenever possible, underlying and multiple cause-of-\ndeath statistics should both be presented. Analyses that use only the\nunderlying cause of death ignore additional information that is readily\navailable from multiple-cause data, and the more limited data may\nunderestimate the importance of several leading causes of death.\nAnalysis of mortality data is critical in efforts to assess the\nburden of disease, to develop policy initiatives, and to\ndesign effective public health interventions. Generally, cause-\nof-death statistics are compiled by examining the underlying\ncause of death as specified on death certificates by the\nexaminer.1 The underlying cause of death is defined as \"the\ndisease or injury that initiated the train of events leading\ndirectly to death, or the circumstances of the accident or\nviolence, which produced the fatal injury.\"2\nHowever, deaths rarely have only 1 cause, and relying\non underlying cause-of-death data does not allow researchers\nto assess the role of other conditions that contributed to death.\nIn many cases, these additional conditions may have been\nnecessary factors in the chain of events leading to death, such\nthat death would not have occurred in their absence. Yet\nbecause they did not initiate the chain of events resulting in\ndeath, they are overlooked in underlying cause-of-death anal-\nyses. Underlying-cause data are also limited in that different\nexaminers often disagree as to which of the many factors\ncontributing to death was the underlying cause.3 Multiple\ncause-of-death data, which specify both the underlying cause\nof death and as many as 20 contributing causes of death, offer\nan alternative.4\nMortality analyses that inform policy and funding ini-\ntiatives at state and national levels still rely almost exclu-\nsively on underlying-cause statistics.5\u00ad11 Thus, policy deci-\nsions may be taken based on information that seriously\nunderestimates the importance of some causes of death.\nHowever, the extent to which analyses of underlying causes\nof death and analyses of multiple causes of death differ for\nthe leading causes of death has not been fully addressed.\nWe compared death statistics compiled using multiple-\ncause data with statistics compiled from underlying-cause data\nleading causes of death as defined by the National Center for\nHealth Statistics (NCHS).12 We evaluated the degree of differ-\nence between underlying- and multiple-cause statistics.\nMETHODS\nData were examined for all reported deaths occurring in\nnational multiple-cause-of-death data to identify both under-\nlying and contributing causes of death.13 Mortality frequen-\ncies were tabulated for each condition comparing any men-\ntion of the condition with a listing of the condition as the\nunderlying cause only.\nA list of 50 rankable leading causes of death and\ncause-specific International Classification of Diseases, 10th\nleading causes were formulated by sorting several common\ncauses of death into 50 mutually exclusive categories that\nwere thought to be useful from a public health perspective.6\nWe identified special conditions of interest not among the\nrankable leading causes of death from an NCHS-compiled list\nRESULTS\nper decedent were listed in multiple cause-of-death data\n4.00).

For inten-\ntional injuries (homicide, suicide), the underlying cause of\ndeath captured 99% of deaths identified in multiple-cause\ndata (Table 1; supplementary table available with the online\nversion of this article). Underlying-cause data also captured\nmore than 90% of deaths reported in multiple-cause data for\nmalignant neoplasms and HIV.\nHowever, underlying-cause data captured only a frac-\ntion of deaths identified by multiple-cause data for some\nleading causes of death: diabetes mellitus (33%); influenza\nand pneumonia (29%); nephritis, nephrosis, and nephrotic\nsyndrome (19%); and essential hypertension and hyperten-\nsive renal disease (8%).\nFor other leading causes of death, the degree of agree-\nment between underlying-cause and multiple-cause statistics\nwas moderate. Underlying-cause data captured 73% of deaths\nrecorded by multiple-cause data from accidents or uninten-\ntional injuries, 61% percent of deaths from heart disease, 60%\nof deaths from Alzheimer disease, 59% percent of deaths\nfrom cerebrovascular disease, and 49% of deaths from\nchronic lower respiratory disease.\nThe 10 leading causes of death differed when we exam-\nined the 2 types of statistics (Table 2). Although the ranking\nof the first 4 leading causes of death is the same for\nboth sources, the fifth leading cause according to underlying\ncause reports (accidents) is ranked tenth according to multi-\nple-cause data. Conversely, the fifth most common cause\naccording to multiple-cause data (essential hypertension and\nhypertensive renal disease) does not appear on the underly-\ning-cause list. Alzheimer disease is the eighth most common\nunderlying cause, but it is not among the 10 most common\nmultiple causes. The rankings are similar on the 2 lists for the\nfollowing: diabetes mellitus; influenza and pneumonia; ne-\nphritis, nephrosis, and nephrotic syndrome; and septicemia.\nDISCUSSION\nOur analyses indicate that the use of underlying cause-\nof-death data alone substantially underrepresents the mortal-\nity burden for several important causes of death. The increase\nin deaths observed when using multiple-cause data rather\nthan underlying-cause data differed widely by condition. For\nsome conditions, there was little difference between the 2\nestimates. For other conditions, however, as many as 10 times\nmore deaths were found from multiple-cause data than from\nunderlying-cause data. The difference between the 2 sets of\nstatistics was extreme enough to affect the ranking of the 10\nleading causes of death in the United States.\nMortality analyses that drive policy and funding\ninitiatives at state and national levels still rely almost\nTABLE 1.

However, mortality\nfrom diabetes mellitus, influenza and pneumonia, nephri-\ntis, nephrotic syndrome, and nephrosis, and essential hy-\npertension and hypertensive renal disease may be severely\nunderrecognized in underlying-cause data. To a lesser\ndegree, mortality from other leading causes of death (in-\ncluding unintentional injuries, heart disease, cerebrovas-\ncular disease, and Alzheimer disease) may also be under-\nrecognized in underlying-cause data.\nAnalyses based on underlying-cause data alone may\nfail to recognize the full importance of these conditions,\nresulting in policy choices that may not be the most effective.\nDiabetes prevention, for example, may not be given the\nfunding that it deserves if policymakers estimate mortality\nbased solely on underlying-cause statistics, which capture\napproximately one third of diabetes deaths identified from\nmultiple-cause statistics. Similarly, the impact of influenza\nand pneumonia may be substantially underestimated if re-\nsearchers tabulate mortality based solely on underlying-cause\nstatistics, which fail to capture approximately 70% of influ-\nenza and pneumonia deaths, as tabulated in multiple cause-\nof-death reports. Even for conditions such as lung cancer, in\nwhich underlying-cause statistics capture 94% of multiple-\ncause-identified deaths, the additional 6% of deaths not rec-\nognized by underlying-cause statistics represent more than\nAlthough underlying-cause statistics by themselves can\nfail to describe the full importance of a disease or condition\nas a cause of death, multiple-cause statistics by themselves\ncan fail to convey the sometimes marginal importance of the\ncondition in generating the deaths it is reported to have\ncaused. Conditions with extremely low case fatality such as\nanemia may be reported as contributing causes of death in\nmultiple-cause data even if they have played only a negligible\nrole. They may even be reported simply to reflect their\nprevalence at the time of death. In this analysis, for example,\nmultiple-cause data showed both anemia and prostate cancer\nto 2001. However, prostate cancer was reported as the\nunderlying cause of death in approximately 70% of cases,\nwhereas anemia was only reported as the underlying cause\nin 10% of cases. Although multiple-cause data reports\nalmost the same number of deaths from prostate cancer as\nfrom anemia, additional information from underlying-\ncause data indicates that prostate cancer is more important\nas a cause of death.\nThis report has important limitations. No gold standard\nexists for cause-of-death statistics. Causes of death may be\nincorrectly reported on death certificates. It is not possible to\ndiscern based on the coding how important a role the condi-\ntion played in causing death or whether death could have\nbeen postponed if the condition had been prevented. Death\ncertificates may not contain information on conditions such as\ndepression that cause substantial morbidity but contribute to\ndeath only indirectly. Although there are inherent differences\nbetween the 2 types of cause-of-death data, some discrepancy\nmay also be due to the accuracy of reporting, and these\neffects are very difficult to assess.\nWe suggest that both multiple and underlying cause-\nof-death statistics should be presented to provide readers with\na more complete picture of the mortality burden from differ-\nent conditions. Exclusive use of either type of cause-of-death\nstatistic ignores important information that is readily avail-\nable and is helpful in characterizing cause-specific mortality.\nHowever, for conditions such as anemia in which case fatality\nis low, caution should be exercised in interpreting additional\ncases found in multiple-cause data.\nREFERENCES\n1.
