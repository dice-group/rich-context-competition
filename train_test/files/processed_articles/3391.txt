Routine blood parameters\nwere measured. Free tri-iodothyronine (FT3), free thyroxine (FT4) and TSH levels were measured.\nResults: Seventy-six patients with AP were enrolled in the study. FT3 and TSH levels were\nsignificantly higher in patients with MAP than in patients with MSAP. FT4 and TSH levels were\nsignificantly lower in the HLAP group than in the BAP group. TSH levels in both MAP and MSAP\npatients were significantly lower in the HLAP group than in the BAP group. TSH was inversely\ncorrelated with triglyceride levels in patients with HLAP. FT3 was a risk factor for MSAP in patients\nwith AP and also demonstrated moderate accuracy in predicting AP severity.\nConclusions: THs and TSH decrease with the severity of AP, especially in patients with HLAP. FT3\nmay be a useful biomarker for the early assessment of the severity of AP.\nJournal of International Medical Research\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\nimr.sagepub.com\n1Department of Endocrinology, Beijing Chaoyang Hospital,\nCapital Medical University, Beijing, China\n2Department of Gastroenterology, Beijing Chaoyang\nHospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China\nCorresponding author:\nJian-Yu Hao, Department of Gastroenterology, Beijing\nChaoyang Hospital, Capital Medical University, 8\nEmail: haojianyucyyy@sina.com\nCreative Commons CC-BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial\n3.0 License (http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits non-commercial use, reproduction and\ndistribution of the work without further permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access page\n(https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\n",

Thyroid hormones\n(THs) secreted by the thyroid gland, princi-\npally thyroxine (T4) and tri-iodothyronine\n(T3), play important roles in regulating the\nbody's energy metabolism, promoting\ngrowth, development and tissue differenti-\nation, and modulating islet function and\nsugar, fat and protein metabolism.12 The\nmajority of circulating T4 and T3 is bound\nto serum proteins and is largely biologically\ninert; determination of the levels of biologic-\nally active free T3 and T4 can more accur-\nately assess the status of the thyroid gland.13\nSince the secretion of THs by the thyroid\ngland is regulated by many things, such as\nthe hypothalamic\u00adpituitary\u00adthyroid axis\nand some pathological factors, serum TH\nlevels may be altered in many disorders.14\nNonthyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS) is a\nstate of adaptation or dysregulation of\nthyrotrophic feedback control characterized\nby unusual levels of THs (typically\ndecreased serum total T3 and FT3, increased\nreverse T3, normal or reduced serum total\nT4 and FT4, and normal or reduced serum\nthyroid stimulating hormone [TSH]); this\ncondition is often seen in starvation, mal-\nnutrition, trauma, critical illness or in\npatients admitted to intensive care units.15\nNTIS has been associated with adverse\nclinical outcomes and is one of the most\nsensitive independent predictors of short-\nterm survival in hospitalized elderly\nStudies have shown that serum TH levels\nundergo significant changes in AP patients\nand return to normal as the condition\nimproves.17\u00ad20 In addition, serum TH levels\nhave been demonstrated to be able to assess\nAP severity.17 However, it remains unclear\nwhether serum TH and TSH levels differ\nbetween patients with AP of different\naetiologies, and whether serum TH and TSH\nlevels can be used to assess the severity of AP\nin such patients. The present study aimed to\ninvestigate possible differences in serum TH\nand TSH levels between patients with BAP\nand those with HLAP. The study also\nassessed the value of serum TH and TSH\nlevels in predicting AP severity in patients\nwith BAP and HLAP.\nPatients and methods\nPatient population\nThis retrospective study enrolled sequen-\ntial patients with AP who were sequen-\ntially admitted to the Department of\nGastroenterology, Beijing Chaoyang\nHospital, Capital Medical University,\nmade when at least two of the following\nthree criteria were met: (i) classic abdominal\npain; (ii) elevation of amylase and/or lipase\nthree-times above the upper limit of normal;\n(iii) evidence of acute pancreatitis revealed\nby contrast-enhanced computed tomog-\nraphy (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging or\nabdominal ultrasound. HLAP was diag-\nnosed in patients with AP when TG levels\nexceeded 11.3 mmol/l or when TG levels\nobserved, and other causes such as biliary\nobstruction were excluded. BAP was diag-\nnosed in patients with AP when biliary\nobstruction was suspected according to bio-\nchemical parameters or imaging findings\nand confirmed by endoscopic retrograde\ncholangiopancreatography (ERCP). AP\nwas classified by severity as mild acute\npancreatitis (MAP) or moderately severe\nacute pancreatitis (MSAP), based on the\ndefined by the presence of clinical features\nand biochemical changes typical of AP,\nwithout organ failure, local or systemic\ncomplications. MSAP was defined by the\npresence of clinical features and biochemical\nchanges typical of AP, with transient organ\nfailure (spontaneously resolved in 48 h),\nlocal complications or exacerbation of\ncomorbid disease (not spontaneously\nresolved in 48 h). A diagnosis of fatty liver\nwas made when ultrasonography revealed a\n`bright' liver with increased echogenicity, or\nCT showed a lower density in the liver than\nin the spleen. Patients with AP due to other\ncauses, such as ERCP or surgery, use of\nanticoagulant drugs and chronic pancrea-\ntitis, and those with a previous history of\nthyroid disease or diseases that could cause\nabnormal TH were excluded. Patients who\nwere taking medications that may affect\nthyroid hormone secretion and metabolism\n(e.g. amiodarone) before enrolment were\nalso excluded.\nThis study was conducted according to\nthe principles of the Declaration of Helsinki\nand the guidelines of the Ethics Committee\nof Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, Capital\nMedical University, Beijing, China. The\nstudy was approved by the Ethics\nCommittee of Beijing Chaoyang Hospital\nsent was obtained from all patients.\nBiochemical measurements\nVenous blood samples (15 ml) were collected\nfrom the cubital vein into VACUETTE\u00d5 Z\nSerum Clot Activator tubes (Greiner Bio-\nOne, Kremsmu\n\u00a8 nster, Austria) within 48 h of\nhospital admission.

Serum levels of TSH\nin MSAP patients were significantly lower in\nthe HLAP group than in the BAP group\nFT4 showed no significant between-group\ndifference (Table 5).\nCorrelations between serum FT3, FT4\nand TSH levels and CHOL, HDL-C,\nLDL-C and TG were analysed in all patients,\nin patients with HLAP and in patients with\nBAP. The results showed that serum TSH\nlevels were significantly inversely correlated\nwith TG in patients with HLAP (r \u00bc \u00c00.414,\nP \u00bc 0.021), but not in patients with BAP.\nLogistic regression analysis was per-\nformed to assess the possibility of FT3,\nFT4 and TSH being risk factors for MSAP\nin all patients with AP, in patients with\nHLAP and in patients with BAP. Only FT3\nwas identified as a risk factor for MSAP. A\nreduction in FT3 by one increased the risk of\npatients with AP, patients with HLAP and\npatients with BAP, respectively (Table 6).\nThe value of FT3 in predicting the sever-\nity of AP was assessed using a ROC curve\nanalysis. The cut-off values, area under the\nROC curve, sensitivity, specificity, PPV and\nNPV in all patients with AP, in patients with\nHLAP and in patients with BAP are shown\nin Table 7.\nDiscussion\nSerum levels of FT3 and FT4 have been\nfound to be reduced in patients with AP in\nprevious studies.17,18 One possible explan-\nation for this reduction in THs is cytokine\nelevations caused by the inflammatory\nresponse and endotoxins in AP. These can\nalter serum TH levels directly or indirectly,\nfor example, by impairing the hypothal-\namic\u00adpituitary\u00adthyroid axis,21 reducing the\nactivity or release of TSH22\u00ad24, inhibiting the\nTable 6.

This can be explained by the\nimpaired activity of hepatic thyroxine 5'-\ncan be secreted by the thyroid gland,$ 80%\nof circulating T3 is produced from T4 via\ndeiodination (catalysed by 5'-deiodinase).36\nPatients with AP often have concomitant\ninfections, and endotoxins produced by\nbacteria enter the liver via the portal vein,\nstimulate the activation of Kupffer cells,\ncause lysosomal rupture and result in liver\nnecrosis.37 Biliary obstruction in patients\nwith BAP even aggravates liver necrosis.38\nConversely, various cytokines released\nby inflammatory pancreatic tissue, such as\nAs a result, activity of hepatic thyroxine\n5'-deiodinase is impaired, and conversion\nfrom T4 to T3 is affected, which may result\nin the more significant decline of FT3 in AP\nCirculating T3/T4 can feed back to the\nhypothalamus and anterior pituitary gland\nto negatively regulate thyrotropin releasing\nhormone (TRH) and TSH release.39\nHowever, serum levels of TSH were also\nsignificantly decreased in the MSAP group\ncompared with MAP group in the present\nstudy, despite the decline in FT3 levels. Since\nTSH levels are regulated dually by THs and\nTRH, the decline of TSH may be caused by\nthe impact of endotoxins and cytokines on\nthe hypothalamus and pituitary gland or the\naltered response of the pituitary gland to\nTHs.21 The majority of critically ill patients\nwith infection have substantially elevated\ncatecholamine and glucocorticoid levels,\nand often develop hypofunction of the\nhypothalamus and pituitary gland, therefore\nhaving a reduced release of TRH and\nThe present study found that serum levels\nof FT4 and TSH were significantly lower in\nthe HLAP group than in the BAP group,\nalthough FT3 levels showed no significant\nbetween-group difference. In addition,\nserum levels of TSH were inversely corre-\nlated with TG in patients with HLAP, but\nnot in patients with BAP. These findings\nsuggest that HLAP and BAP may have a\ndifferent pathogenesis and clinical course.\nHL can not only be the consequence of AP\nbut also it can be an independent factor\npatients with AP had abnormal serum lipid\nlevels, and 1\u00ad12% of AP cases are caused by\nHL.4,5 THs have diverse effects on lipid\nmetabolism, and hypothyroidism causes\nhypercholesterolaemia.41 Previous studies\ndemonstrated that HLAP patients had sig-\nnificantly elevated FFA levels and that FFA\nlevels were associated with AP severity.42,43\nInterestingly, FFA levels are derived mainly\nfrom TG-rich lipoproteins by lipolysis cat-\nalysed by lipoprotein lipase.43 FFAs can\ndirectly damage pancreatic acinar cells and\nsignificantly inhibit the protein binding,\ndeiodination and conversion of THs.9,44\nTherefore, the current study findings suggest\nthat patients with HLAP more easily\ndevelop NTIS and have more significant\nchanges in TH levels, compared with\npatients with BAP.\nThe present study demonstrated that\nserum levels of FT3 and TSH were signifi-\ncantly lower in patients with MSAP com-\npared with patients with MAP, in the overall\nAP patient population and in the HLAP and\nBAP groups, suggesting that serum FT3 and\nTSH levels are associated with AP severity.\nStudies have demonstrated that NTIS is\nassociated with nonthyroid disease sever-\nity.45,46 This present study further demon-\nstrated that the FT3 level was an\nindependent risk factor for MSAP. Given\nthat low FT3 and FT4 levels can reduce\noxygen and energy consumption, we suggest\nthat the decline of serum levels of FT3 and\nFT4 may be a self-protective physiological\nmechanism adopted by critically ill patients.\nConsistent with this suggestion, it has been\nobserved that TH levels return to normal\nwhen patients with NTIS recover.19\nCurrently, there is no evidence that hormone\nreplacement therapy can help patients\nrecover more rapidly.\nThe present study had several limitations.\nFirst, the sample size was relatively small,\nwhich might have resulted in insufficient\nstatistical power. Secondly, the mean age\nwas significantly lower in the HLAP group\nthan in the BAP group, and the confounding\neffect of age could not be excluded. Thirdly,\npatients with severe AP were not included in\nthis study as there were very few cases.\nFinally, the timing of TH and TSH detection\nmay have an impact on the results.\nHowever, due to the fact that the patients\nwere admitted at different times after the\nonset of abdominal pain, TH and TSH levels\nwere measured as early as possible. In\naddition, TH and TSH levels were only\nmeasured once, and thus it was not possible\nto assess whether THs and TSH had differ-\nent declining speeds between MAP and\nMSAP patients. Future studies should care-\nfully address these issues.\nIn conclusion, the present study demon-\nstrated that decreased TH and TSH levels\nmay be closely associated with AP severity.\nThe TH abnormality appears to be more\nsignificant in patients with HLAP than in\npatients with BAP. Detection of THs levels\nin patients with early AP, especially HLAP\npatients, may help predict disease severity,\nselect appropriate initial treatment and\nimprove prognosis.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor- profit sectors.\nReferences\n\u00a8 ppel G.
