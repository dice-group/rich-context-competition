But many are hampered in\ntheir ability to write them down. The reasons for this may\ninclude lack of confidence or practical skills, having\nEnglish as a second language, learning disabilities, or cul-\ntural deficits. This difficulty in communicating through\nwritten forms affects both the children's social develop-\nment and their academic attainment, with serious conse-\nquences for prospects in adult life. The Write Here\ncollaborative project was designed to address the chal-\nlenges children face as writers. It drew from Dorothy\nHeathcote's Mantle of the Expert dramatic enquiry teach-\ning approach to allow a certain degree of learner flexibility\nand creativity in exploring the process of writing, as\nopposed to learning about different writing styles. Our\nmain goals included (a) testing how visual art, play, and\nmultimodal learning can help engage children with pur-\nposeful, meaningful creative writing practices; (b) capital-\nizing on this motivation to support the acquisition of\npractical \"nuts and bolts\" writing skills; and (c) promoting\nthe engagement of young people with art galleries. The\nproject involved a professional writer working in residency\nin both an art gallery and in schools, collaborating with a\ngallery education officer and a lead schoolteacher, to\ndevelop a sustainable body of practice designed to support\nyoung people's confidence and skill in writing.\nContext\nThe Teaching of Literacy\nWriting is a complex set of practices which is far more than a set\nof skills. (National Writing Project, 1989)\nOver the past 50 years, different approaches to the teaching of\nwriting\"havebeeninfluencedbythedebateoftheday\"(Bearne,\nwriting was regarded as a \"creative\" activity. By the mid-1970s,\nthe internationally renowned linguist Michael Halliday\n(Halliday, 2002) emphasized the significance of social pro-\ncesses for developing writing skills. In this view, children should\ninitiate the learning, and the teacher responds with support, but\nnot by direct teaching. By the early 1980s, Donald Graves's\n(1983) initiative \"Writer's Workshop\" had pioneered what the\nNational Writing Project described as \"the Horticultural model\nof development\" (p. 9). He identified the importance of what a\nchild brings to the writing process (including experiences and\n1Nottingham Trent University, UK\n2Mellers Primary School, Nottingham, UK\nCorresponding Author:\nIryna Kuksa, Nottingham Trent University, 321A Bonington, Burton\nStreet, Nottingham, NG1 4BU, UK.\nEmail: iryna.kuksa@ntu.ac.uk\nSeeing, Doing, Writing: The Write\nHere Project\nPeter Rumney1, Joy Buttress2, and Iryna Kuksa1\n Keywords\nliteracy, creative writing, visual art, multimodal learning, gallery education\n2 SAGE Open\nassumptions learned outside school) and the role of the teacher\nas a fellow \"writer.\" Since the 1990s, however, the establish-\nment of a National Curriculum and the work of the National\nStrategies in the United Kingdom have led teachers to regard\nwriting as a set of skills, which need to be taught directly. In this\nprocess, children work through each stage until they achieve a\nfinished product--that is, planning, drafting, revising, and edit-\ning before the final copy is made (Department for Education\nand Employment, 1998). Since the turn of the century, writing\nhas remained at the top of the national educational agenda, for\ntwo main reasons: (a) the much poorer results achieved by 10-\nto 11-year-olds in writing, compared with reading, maths, and\nscience, at the end of Key Stage 2 Standard Assessment Tests\n(SATs), and (b) the poor performance of boys in writing (Palmer\nNew National Curriculum in England indicates how writing\nremains a priority in schools today, and the subject of bitter\ndebate.\nKey Practitioners\nBefore they can write, children need meaningful experiences to\nwrite about, and opportunities to talk them through. (Palmer &\nPie Corbett, the educational writer and poet, was an advisor\nhe introduced \"Talk for Writing\" (now common practice in\nU.K. classrooms), at the heart of which lies children's talk\nand discussion as a prerequisite to the writing process. He\nhas developed a multisensory approach to the teaching of\nwriting, to appeal to different learning styles. In this approach,\na new story with archetypal structure and tropes is read to the\nclass, who then cocreate a visual map of the story using a set\nof visual symbols that have been learned. The story is then\ntold physically by the children in groups (using the map as\nprompt) with performative symbols so the story becomes\nembodied by the pupils. Subsequently, when writing the\nstory down as text, the children gradually substitute their\nown individual words, characters, and actions into the origi-\nnal story, making it their own. The \"Talk for Writing\" pro-\ncess advocates strongly that the teacher should play a pivotal\nrole in modeling a scaffolded writing process to help the\nchild engage with \"shared\" given texts and encourage their\n\"guided\" and then \"independent\" writing. This process\nresponds to Corbett's observation that children need to inter-\nnalize language constructions through the \"imitation\" and\noral rehearsal of given texts, \"acting out\" the narrative in\nclass together, using visual maps or cues to build confidence.\nWhen the words, structures, and phrases are sufficiently\nembedded through this process, the children are in a position\nto \"substitute\" their own ideas, and subsequently \"innovate\"\ntheir own spoken and written narratives and nonfiction texts\nwith confidence. This method has been shown to be highly\neffective, improving the quality of writing, and increasing\nthe child's motivation and engagement. This is especially\ntrue for boys, for children using English as an additional lan-\nguage, and for those with special educational needs (Corbett,\nThe importance of talk in laying the foundation for a writ-\ning process is also supported by Sue Palmer, a former pri-\nmary head teacher, writer, and education consultant. Palmer\nargues that human beings are not \"hard-wired\" for literacy,\nwhereas we are \"hard-wired\" for speech (Palmer, 2011). She\nbelieves we are able to talk and articulate as we are exposed\nto speech from birth. This is very different to reading and\nwriting, which have to be explicitly taught. However, liter-\nacy is more than an agglomeration of speaking, listening, and\nwriting. Literacy affects the way people think, view, and con-\nstruct the world around them. Talking about one's experience\nis essential to writing about it. Palmer introduces the \"Two\nHorses Before the Cart\" model for writing, originating from\nthe assumption that writing without any talking is, \"putting\nthe cart before the horse.\" In this approach, children are\nrequired to use two different types of talk: talk for learning,\nwhich gives them the opportunity to discuss the subject they\nare going to write about; and talk for writing, which is a dis-\ncussion of the reading and technical writing of a type of text.\nPalmer has developed writing \"skeletons\" to support the\ntransference of talk into writing. These skeletons help to\norganize and plan the writing process by using diagrammatic\nrepresentations and visual models, which can support even\nvery young children's thought processes.\nLike Corbett, Palmer is offering children a range of tools\nand methods of motivation for the job in hand. But there is\nstill debate among leading practitioners about the relation-\nship between--or prioritization of--\"skills acquisition\" and\n\"creativity\" in developing young writers. Some studies sup-\nport the view that writing skills need to be taught first\n(Wilson, 2002), whereas others argue against establishing a\n\"crude checklist\" to allow children to think like writers, to\nbecome motivated, thoughtful, and creative in their endeav-\nThis project adopted the \"Talk for Writing\" approach,\nmaking use of the aforementioned individual and collabora-\ntive processes, but also extending them into new practice to\nexplore greater detail in writing, and more varied degrees of\nindividual authorship of the archetypal story. The strategy\nproposed by Corbett was particularly suitable for this study,\nas so many children in participating schools (especially in\nMellers, which was the lead school) use English as a second\nlanguage, and this technique proved to benefit the pupils in\nthe past.\nMultimodal Learning and Play\nChildren can, and need to, learn in a variety of different\nways. These have been described variously as \"learning\nstyles,\" \"multiple intelligences,\" or \"personalized learning.\"\nIndividual learners may have preferences for a particular\nRumney et al. 3\nsensory modality (e.g., visual, auditory, or kinesthetic) and,\nas a result, may engage with the learning process more enthu-\nsiastically. However, recent scientific evidence suggests that\n(notwithstanding the very important motivational benefits)\nnew knowledge is not necessarily processed more effectively\nif young learners receive information according to their pre-\nferred learning style. This is due to the fact that although\nvisual, auditory, and kinesthetic information is indeed pro-\ncessed in different parts of the brain, these parts are highly\ninterconnected (Coffield, Moseley, Hall, & Ecclestone,\n2007). Bearing the above in mind, this study adopts the term\nmultimodal learning, and bases its definition on Goodwin\n(2005): \"the engagement of all senses in interpreting differ-\nent parts of the story offers visual, auditory, and kinaesthetic\nsupport to all the children--especially for those for whom\nlanguage and literacy are not easy\" (p. xv). Multimodal here\nembraces the social, verbal, and playful elements advocated\nby practitioners alluded to above.\nPlay is as important to young children's linguistic devel-\nopment as it is to their social and emotional development.\nPlay as formalized through drama, or as expressed through\nvisual mark making, offers opportunities to \"explore the pos-\nLev Vygotsky argued that \"It is incorrect to conceive of play\nas activity without purpose . . . Creating an imaginary situa-\ntion can be regarded as a means of developing abstract\nthought\" (p. 103). He also stated earlier that \"in play a child\nis always above his average age, above his daily behaviour;\nin play it is as though he were a head taller than himself\"\nchild's imagination tangible and visceral. In terms of the per-\nformative aspects of play, it can help children to interpret,\ncreate, and communicate ideas. The Write Here project used\ndrama as \"an emancipatory device that frees its participants\nintention here was to enable young learners to inhabit a state\nof metaxis, or in other words, a state of belonging to two\nautonomous worlds at the same time, which is applicable to\nperformance studies when actors go in and out of character\ndramatic role-taking by the young learners, to embrace mul-\ntiple viewpoints and perspectives when exploring a particu-\nlar issue or emotion. This ongoing awareness of both the\nfictional world and the social reality of the classroom\nstrengthens the children's ability to reflect on the task, as\nwell as helping them to realize that there is a multitude of\npossible solutions to a given problem classroom (Boal, 1995;\nUnfortunately, however, in mainstream education, such\nuse of \"play\" and \"drama\" is all too often left behind after\nKey Stage 1 (ages 5-7), and abandoned all together by Key\nStage 2 (ages 7-11; or limited to occasional basic drama les-\nsons and role-play). Even teachers who want to use drama as\na tool (for literacy or elsewhere across the curriculum) may\nhave had very limited exposure to drama techniques during\ntraining. They may lack the confidence to use it, or may not\neven value it is a thing \"of itself.\" By its nature, drama\nrequires risk-taking, asks uncomfortable questions, and can\nchallenge hierarchy in the learning space; but it cannot be\nforced to a predetermined conclusion, hence its potential for\nuse in fostering children's creative writing.\nThe discouragement of children to learn through play,\nafter a certain age, is mirrored by a long-standing and reduc-\ntive tendency in the subject of visual art. Here, pupils aged 7\nand above are suddenly required to \"represent\" the world lit-\nerally, as opposed to being able to \"interpret\" it more\nabstractly, which was deemed more acceptable for younger\nchildren in the past. The disadvantages of this formalist\napproach are evident to Further Education (FE) and Higher\nEducation (HE) lecturers involved in interviewing art foun-\ndation or arts degree candidates at the end of the mainstream\nschool cycle. Many 18-year-olds spend their first year of\nhigher education in a process of unlearning, reacquainting\nthemselves with experimentation and playfulness, and reed-\nucating themselves to take responsibility for their own, non-\nobjective led learning.\nResearch Questions and Aims\nThe main research question posed by the Write Here project\nwas as follows:\nResearch Question 1: How can visual art and multi-\nmodal learning increase motivation, and attainment in\nliteracy?\nThe project engaged in the essential task of facilitating all\nchildren in their literacy development, regardless of back-\nground, life experience, mother tongue, or \"ability.\" The main\naims were incremental and interconnected: (a) to inspire and\nmotivate children's writing through experiential engagement\nwith visual art, (b) to develop techniques designed to improve\nattainment in writing generally, and (b) to find ways to engage\nmore young people with art galleries.\nPhilosophically and politically, the Write Here project\naimed to challenge the (now prevailing) tendency toward\nlearning that is objective-led and predicated on knowledge\nacquisition, accompanied by an unseemly and aggressive\nflight from explorative learning. The project was conceived\npartly to address the debate about the value of play and formal\nlearning, which has become polarized and acrimonious. The\ncurrent Coalition government's agenda visibly exerts down-\nward pressure on state schoolteachers who wish to teach liter-\nacy (and other subjects) creatively. Children need a variety\nof \"playful, profound, and unusual\" experiences to draw on,\nto develop their communication skills (Rumney, 2008).\nConnecting with children's personal experiences is not only an\neffective way of fostering their engagement with core literacy\nskills, but also a meaningful one. But the project sought to\n4 SAGE Open\ndemonstrate that nurturing a creative writing process can sup-\nport not only a sense of personal achievement, but measurable\nattainment as well. The effects of teaching literacy creatively\nhave been evidenced recently by data collected by the National\nAssociation of Writers in Education (NAWE) in a study that\ndemonstrates how the intervention of professional writers into\nschools can have a remarkable effect on both achievement and\nattainment (see Owen & Munden, 2010). The decision to\ninvolve a professional writer in this project was based on\nteachers' beliefs that the act of writing becomes more mean-\ningful when it is shared by a professional reading or creating\ntheir own text. This brought an alternative working knowl-\nedge, a fresh perspective to the use of vocabulary, grammar,\nand punctuation, and unexpected literary ideas (e.g., using\nseveral genres), which expanded and challenged the received\napproaches of the school curriculum. Interestingly, in this\nstudy, the fact that the writer was male had a significant impact\non boys, who traditionally have more negative (sometimes\nculturally informed) attitudes to writing.\nMethod\nThe Write Here project was a longitudinal examination of\n\"cycles of shared learning,\" focused on developing chil-\ndren's writing skills and creative thinking. The core project\nworked with 900 children from 12 primary and secondary\nschools. It extended the previous NAWE research, by plac-\ning a writer into both an art gallery setting, and a lengthy\nresidency in a lead school. The project's methodology was\npredicated on an extended, tripartite relationship between a\nwriter (Peter Rumney), an art gallery learning officer (Ruth\nLewis-Jones, Djanogly Gallery, Lakeside Arts Centre,\nUniversity of Nottingham), and a literacy coordinator (Joy\nButtress, Mellers Primary School, Radford). This triumvirate\nof practitioners sharing diverse pedagogies was supported by\nWriting East Midlands, by undergraduates and graduates\nfrom both the University of Nottingham and Nottingham\nTrentUniversity,andbytheNottinghamCentralImprovement\nthe gallery for a half-day session, developing their writing\nskills further after they returned to school. In addition, 60\npupils at Mellers were allocated the role of \"experts\" for the\nproject, with their attainment being statistically measured.\nAll the gallery sessions were modeled, planned, and evalu-\nated in conjunction with staff and pupils at Mellers, and with\nthe Djanogly gallery team. Preparatory and post-gallery ses-\nsions were conducted in Mellers to deepen and extend the\nresearch methodology. The techniques developed there were\napplied and refined in microcosm with the other schools in\nthe four core gallery exhibitions explored in the project.\nBaseline assessments, teacher profiling and evaluations,\nSATs results, and pupil self-evaluations were used to test the\nefficacy of the approach, demonstrating its effects on moti-\nvation and a sense of \"achievement,\" and on \"attainment\" in\nwriting.\nIn light of the pedagogical context discussed above, three\nassumptions were made about the development of children's\nliteracy: (a) that they need to play to maximize learning, (b)\nthat multimodal activities are crucial in engaging imagina-\ntions and attention, and (c) that visual art of all kinds offers\nan open-ended, empathetic stimulus through which children\nuse their own life experiences and imaginations to motivate\nwriting. Philosophically, the methodology was underpinned\nby principles of discovery-based learning (Bruner 1967,\n1987), mediated by enhanced discovery learning (Marzano,\n2011), and facilitated by use of both \"soft\" and \"hard\" scaf-\nfolding to engage different learning styles (Brush & Saye,\n2002). Practically, the study drew on and developed whole\nschool approaches to writing (such as the \"Talk for Writing\"\nand \"Big Writing\" schemes).\nOne might argue that persuasive or report writing have an\nequivalent (or even more important) role in adult life, requir-\ning a different form of discourse than that of creative writing.\nThis study, however, is in agreement with Aitken (2013),\nwho states that by adopting Mantle of the Expert approach,\nthe students are no longer asked to carry out a piece or writ-\ning \"because we are learning about persuasive writing\" (p.\n46), but instead, they are empowered to be more in charge of\ntheir learning process. It could also be claimed that all the\nskills learned through the creative writing, such as narrative\nstructure and editing techniques, can be applied to formal\nwriting structures as taught in school. In this article, how-\never, we intend to avoid any deliberate tendencies to polarize\none approach from another.\nDorothy Heathcote's dramatic enquiry teaching approach\nwas influential in determining the project methodology, as\nwere later iterations of her philosophy. This approach known\nas Mantle of the Expert encompasses the idea of \"learning\ngrowing like a mantle\" (Aitken, 2013, p. 35) and, as Ericsson\n(2011) argues, is highly applicable within the new field\ncalled arts didactics (an approach explored in the research\nproject Kunstfagdidaktikk, led by Professor Aslaug Nyrnes,\nThere are several good reasons to revisit the work of Heathcote\ntoday. For one thing, it represents an approach to teaching that\nstrives to empower pupils to reflect critically about issues. It\nalso stands for a pedagogy that seeks to involve the class\ncollectively in a process of investigation, and it works from an\nart-based philosophy of education that is not informed by a\nromantic prioritising of creative expression inherited from the\nprogressive education movement, or a prioritising of\nperformance of worship of individual talent that is modelled in\ncontemporary competitions for young people on television.\nThe Mantle of the Expert methodology is quite flexible and\nbrings together \"the individual and the collective, language\nthe center of the learning process, responsive to his or her\nneeds (Heston, 1993). This approach, however, is far from\nRumney et al. 5\nchild-led. Aitken (2013) argues that although it assumes a\nprogressive view of learning and positions the child as its\ncompetent co-constructor, it also requires careful teacher\nplanning and designing activities appropriate to the curricu-\nlum level. Children are not just \"given expert status in an\nempty way, but are encouraged to earn and justify that posi-\nthe Mantle of the Expert approach relies on is the concept\nbased on the study of \"a frame\" by the sociologist and writer\nErving Goffman (1986). He argued that every individual\nuses conceptual frames as a means of organizing his or her\nexperiences and structuring his or her societal perceptions.\nThe allocation of the role of an expert to the young learners\n(or, in other words, framing them as such) empowers them to\ntake responsibility for their own learning process and subse-\nquently improve their achievements (Kahnemann, 2012).\nCase Studies\nHaving postulated that play and multimodal activities are\nimportant to developing creative writing, the art gallery pro-\nvided a unique \"domain\" for young people's engagement\nwith both art and literacy. It offered a significantly different\nexperience from encountering individual artworks (sponsored\nby supermarkets) hanging in the school corridor, however\nuseful and pleasing to the eye such benefactions might be. An\nart exhibition, or a collection of museum artifacts, offers audi-\nence choice. Making choices about which works to gravitate\nor respond to leads to more active learning. The gallery acts\nas a transformative or liminal space in which to encounter art,\na place full of opportunities to construct new knowledge,\nquestion the self, and express this through the written word.\nThe Write Here team used four Lakeside Arts Centre Gallery\nengagement with art and literacy.All these exhibitions offered\npowerful, motivational stimuli to the making of meaningful\nstories (through prose or poetry), and opportunities to explore\nwriting techniques once the children had been engaged.\nThis article focuses on two contrasting case studies from\nthe body of work. In the first, Revolution on Paper (2009-\n2011), we discuss how the artwork was used to explore the\nwriting of prose, with an emphasis on understanding narra-\ntive structures. The children engaged with the art through a\nprocess of empathy, which motivated them to understand and\nattempt the detailed task of developing narrative causality.\nThis case study also examines how the work was prepared\nfor and followed up in the school classroom, and how the\nWrite Here project was connected to and developed a major\nliteracy strategy, Pie Corbett's \"Talk for Writing\" alluded to\nearlier. In the second case study, Dust on the Mirror (2010-\n2011), we discuss how the gallery offered opportunities to\nwrite poetry. Children responded to the artworks through a\nprocess of reflection and contemplation, which excited their\npoetic imaginations and led to writing that was liberated\nthrough experimentation with formal structures.\nRevolution on Paper was a British Museum traveling\nexplored the politics, iconography, and aesthetics of the mid-\n20th century Mexican post-revolutionary period (Ades, &\nMcCLean 2009). Images of class struggle propaganda, the\nexperience of urban and rural poverty, the influence of indig-\nenous cultures on modern Mexican life, the symbolism Day\nof the Dead festivities, and global concerns in the Totalitarian\nera jostle with intense portraiture, all encapsulated in Diego\nRivera's iconic portrait of Emiliano Zapata and His Horse\n(1932). Through engaging with and responding to this exhi-\nbition, 90 children aged 9 to 14 achieved complex and\nadvanced narrative writing, which reflected their own con-\ntemporary lives. The process described below embraces the\ngallery-based work undertaken by all the participating\nschool, and the pre-research and follow-up research work\ncarried out in the lead school.\nPre-work (Mellers, 60 children). The gallery visit was prepared\nfor by a series of kinesthetic interventions in the participating\nschool hall. The purpose was twofold: (a) to encourage\nengagement with and empathy for characters depicted and\n(b) to inculcate and extend the pupils' understanding of nar-\nrative structures and archetypes. Physical work included the\nembodiment of pictures through tableaux, the description of\nan artwork to peers who could not see it, and the develop-\nment of personal narratives from art images, through discus-\nsion. A series of warm-up exercises were developed to start\naddressing \"causality\" in narrative, to deal with \"and then\nsyndrome\" (Wray & Lewis, 2005), which is one of the big-\ngest challenges to young writers. For example, a backward\nlearning game called \"And . . . Why . . . Because\" was\ndevised and introduced. In this, an archetypal story opening\n(e.g., \"A girl walked into the forest, and . . . .\") is offered to\nthe group by the writer/teacher. Each child has then to\ndevelop the narrative in turn by saying \"and\" what happened\nnext. The exercise is then repeated, but the story begins, \"A\ngirl walked into the forest . . .Why? . . . Because . . . \" Each\nchild has now to explain in turn the narrative events in terms\nof causality (e.g., \"Why did the girl walk into the forest?\"\n\"Because she was running away.\" \"Why was she running\naway?\" \"Because she was scared.\" \"Why was she scared?\"\n\"Because . . . etc.\"). This process encouraged lateral thinking\nthrough word association activities and was a helpful precur-\nsor to interpreting the visual artworks in the gallery.\nGallery work (four schools,90 children). After orientation to the\ngallery experience, the children were asked to investigate the\nMexican Revolutionary art with minimal (historical) context\n(Figure 1), and the simple question, \"What are these Mexi-\ncan artists trying to say to us about the world?\" Children\nwere free to select the images that most interested, puzzled,\nor annoyed them, and discussed the content in small groups\nsupported by an adult (from the professional and student vol-\nunteer team).\n6 SAGE Open\nDrama was used to interrogate the artwork, and key\nimages were brought to life through tableaux, which were\nresponded to and developed by other pupils in the class\n(Figure 2). The children identified very strongly with the\nimages of another era and culture. In enacting and discussing\nthe revolutionary imagery, they were able to articulate very\nclearly their own understanding of class and gender politics,\nnotions of justice, and family dynamics. One refugee with\nlittle English later wrote,\nI thought it was brilliant . . . and when we look at the stories I felt\nthat I was scared because if I was in that time, I might be dead\nbecause of the war that killed their father . . . their story was\nimportant because it was true . . . because I've seen lots in my\nlife, because I have lots of things like war and I want to learn\nmore about them. Was it like my story or not? . . . (Eritrean\nrefugee aged 10, Mellers)\nAlthough this child's personal experiences may be an\nextreme and particular example of empathy with the art-\nworks, it did demonstrate the general empathetic response of\nthe children to the exhibition, and their motivation to make\nstories from it.\nAfter these initial engagements, the children were intro-\nduced to novel ways of identifying narrative structure,\nthrough words, symbols, and kinesthetic structures, such as\nstory strings. These are simple, long lengths of twine that are\nmanipulated by the child to create a flexible (and change-\nable) narrative \"thread\" that maps a story on the floor or\nlarge sheet of paper. Post-it notes are then used to assay and\nwrite down possible narrative events and way markers in the\nnarrative journey, inspired by the child's chosen picture. The\npost-it notes are moved around the string at will, providing a\nskeleton for more detailed writing of the story later on. The\nstory can be written from any point in the narrative, but par-\nticipants were challenged to invent their personalized story\nbackward from the very end (literally writing it upward from\nthe bottom of the page) to foster causal thinking and to facili-\ntate the shifting of writer's block. The \"And . . . Why . . .\nBecause\" game was reintroduced to facilitate this process.\nAfter initial reticence, all the gallery visitors embraced this\n\"backward\" writing technique, irrespective of whether they\nhad encountered it previously in school.\nPost-gallery follow-up sessions (Mellers, 60 children). The writer\nwas asked by the class teacher to write a short five-part story\ninspired by one of the Mexican poster images, but adhering\nstrictly to the format set out by Corbett's \"Talk for Writing\"\nscheme (which had previously been adopted by the school)\nRumney's new archetypal story (Bala and Wareem) drew\nconsciously on the life experiences of the children as per-\nceived from their fictional writing in the early gallery inter-\nactions. The new story was then used in the \"Talk for Writing\"\nmodel. It was mapped out visually, then acted out and told\nthrough a version of coded sign language. Once the story and\nits structure had been learned and embodied physically in\nthis way by the children, they developed it into their own\nnarratives through independent writing. Elements of the\noriginal story were substituted with their own ideas, thus\ninnovating and personalizing the story into new and distinc-\ntive narratives.\nThis use of the \"Talk for Writing\" process with an art-\ninspired story was successful, but it raised the question of\nwhether more detailed writing could be achieved by extend-\ning this scheme in new ways. To investigate this, a set of\nexercises was devised using playing cards and the simple\nwell-known game of \"Sevens\" to develop further the con-\ncepts of sequencing and backward thinking. Returning to the\nstory strings and causal games, the pupils continued writing\ntheir own narratives, but backward, constantly expanding\nand developing detail through the post-it note mapping struc-\nture. The stories were then rewritten from the beginning.\nThis also introduced practically the idea of editing in story\nwriting. At the same time, the children were asked to con-\nsider and subsume familiar strategies from their classroom\nteaching into the new story (e.g., focusing on particular parts\nFigure 1. \"Revolution on Paper\": Preparing the pupils for\nengaging with the gallery artwork.\nFigure 2. \"Revolution on Paper\": Acting out the images before\ndeveloping written narratives.\nRumney et al. 7\nof speech or grammatical tropes). In addition, in Mellers,\nvisual artist Huw Feather worked alongside the writer to cre-\nate group drawings of the new stories, using TV camera tech-\nniques (\"close-ups,\" \"mid-shots,\" and \"long-shots\") to\n\"focus\" on different aspects of the narrative structure and\ncharacter development through storyboarding, helping to\nrefine the writing further. Finally, the children used the same\nstoryboarding techniques to evaluate the whole Write Here\nproject, discussing it as if it were a narrative of the kind that\nhad been inculcated during the writing process. They criti-\ncally assessed the work in detail, considering the advantages\nand disadvantages to their own learning of all the writing\ntechniques described above, scoring the stages accordingly.\nIn addition to this raw material, the teaching staff contextual-\nized the children's evaluations according to their own assess-\nments of the pupils in terms of ability, attainment, and\nlearning needs. This process was subsequently used by the\nteam to evaluate the whole Write Here process.\nDust on the Mirror (eight schools, 290 children) was an\nexhibition of multimedia art (drawing, painting, and video\ninstallation) by Si\u00e2n Bowen, Christopher Cook, Susan Derges,\nDonna Ong, and Charwei Tsai (Godfrey, 2010). The artists\nused materials such as graphite, light particles, and film to cre-\nate contemplative, abstract artworks (Figure 3). Central to the\nexhibition (and therefore germane to the Write Here research)\nwere the notions of interconnectedness, deep thinking, and\nsensual imagining, which were used to explore a range of writ-\ning issues: reflection and the finding of characters and genera-\ntion of stories, freeing up the writing process, generating\nlanguage and poetic ideas, manipulating expressive language\nand finding structure for poetic ideas, and editing.\nWhereas the gritty realism and macabre fantasy of the\nMexican revolutionary exhibition enabled young people to\nwrite stories derived from relatively direct connections they\nmade with their own lives, engagement with the meditative\nand reflective works in Dust on the Mirror engendered calm\nabstraction and engagement with mythic themes.\nThe artwork encouraged philosophical reflection and\nstimulated higher order thinking, as well as developing\naspects of emotional intelligence. Children aged 5 years\nupward explored the poetry of the image, be it still or mov-\ning. The writing (and speaking) work, therefore, addressed\nprimarily the generation and structuring of poetic ideas.\nThere were no previsit sessions for this case study. The\nwork began with the pupils reclining on duvets in a side gal-\nlery to view two simultaneously projected Charwei Tsai\nfilms. In these, the artist wrote/painted mantras on large mir-\nrors reflecting the sky and the ocean. Each pupil was then\ngiven a personal mirror to look at, to explore the notion of\n\"reflection\" in both its physical and metaphorical senses. By\n\"reflecting\" upon both the \"inner\" and \"outer\" world, the\nchildren could then invest their own experiences in making\nstatements, assumptions, and suppositions about the charac-\nter of the artist. This raised a series of questions designed to\nchannel the pupils'imaginations into story and myth making:\n\"What do we know?\" (differentiated for younger children as\n\"What can we see?\"),\"What do we think we know?\" (differ-\nentiated as \"What can we guess?\"), and \"What would we like\nto ask the artist/girl/woman in the film?\" The potential sto-\nries or histories of the artist were then debated in small\ngroups, supported by an adult, and shared among the whole\nclass.\nThe session then moved physically from the \"reflection\"\nspace into the wider gallery, surrounded by the other artists'\nabstract works. On the floor, rolls of Mylar (thick mirrored\npaper) were unscrolled. These replicated the sea and sky of\nTsai's videos, and the children were invited to draw or write\nstories on the reflective surface, effectively adopting the\nmantle of the artist seen in the videos. This mark making\nexercise was intended to free up the \"writer,\" unfettered by\nformal language, using the children's propensity to write and\ndraw simultaneously. The unpressurized work was particu-\nlarly important for unskilled writers or those with no discern-\nible writing skills at all (due to age, disability, or lack of\nEnglish). The mirrored writing surfaces, placed with sensi-\ntivity to the exhibition works, became de facto new, collab-\norative artworks on the gallery floor, increasing the pupil's\nFigure 3. \"Dust on the Mirror\": Interrogating abstract artworks\nto inspire poetry writing.\n8 SAGE Open\nsense of involvement in, and ownership of, a cultural space\nthey would not normally access.\nAt this point, as part of interventions discussing the prob-\nlems of being a professional writer, participants discussed\n\"blank page\" syndrome. This demonstrated to the children\nthat the issues they faced as writers were shared by adults as\nwell, with the intention of raising self-esteem and confidence\nto tackle their writing tasks. Once again, speaking and listen-\ning to the stories and images that the pupils had committed to\nthe \"blank\" mirror paper was an important developmental\nphase in the gallery session. The second \"writer's issue\"\naddressed was the challenge of accessing and developing\ninteresting ideas. Responding to the array of images sur-\nrounding them on the gallery walls, the pupils were invited to\nextrapolate potential stories that they could see in the images\n(irrespective of the artists' original intentions). This was\nachieved though modeling the \"what is possible\" questions.\nThe openness to interpretation of the abstract works, and\nlack of judgment in adult's responses to the children's ideas,\nwere key in realizing their potential as story makers.\nTo collate and embed these responses to the imagery, the\npupils were given A4 scaffolding grids on which they wrote\ndown all the characters/emotions/sounds/senses/thoughts/\nconflicts that they felt were expressed in the artworks. The\nwords or phrases they wrote were unencumbered by expecta-\ntions of grammatical or spelling accuracy (which was explic-\nitly put aside). Once these grids or word banks were filled\nout, Rumney modeled the writing of \"Mykus\" (a new haiku\nform in which the Japanese 5/7/5 syllable line structure is\nreplaced by a more accessible 5/7/5 word structure), using\nthe grids as source material. The children's writing had there-\nfore been scaffolded very carefully, but the writing was fresh,\nexperimental, and improvisatory. The final Myku writing\nexercise took place in the last 10 min of the 120-min session.\nThis was achievable because of the depth of imaginative\nwork, and the scaffolding, that led up to it.\nThey gained a new way of thinking about art and writing through\nthe writing strategies in the workshop . . . I found it particularly\ninteresting their response to the installation. Having the space to\nreflect over that expanse of time is something largely missed\nfrom their ordinary, fast-paced timetable, and the pupils got a lot\nout of the experience. (Key Stage 3 teacher, SamworthAcademy,\nBelow is the example of Mykus written by children\nA cold misty night where\nstray dogs and spirits roam all around\nand the only sound is water\nI was fighting in the\nwar with my best friends, but on\nthe radio he died silently\nI held the cross tightly.\n\"Lord save us.\" And then I ran.\nRan to save my country\nAshes floating down from war,\nthe salty tears of devastated children crying.\nFiery bombs, upset children thinking all is lost.\nFindings\nAttainment\nThe findings of the Write Here project are presented here in\nthe context of previous data on pupils' attainment in writing,\nand based on a new dataset created as part of this research\ncohort) were part of the project evaluation (Table 1). This\ncore group of young learners evaluated the project through\ncreative recall exercises, and drew up with the writer a list of\nthe activities they had undertaken throughout the project.\nThese activities were then grouped into a simple list form\nwith options to indicate (from 1 to 10) how effective the chil-\ndren had found them.\nThe medium term benefits of the study are attested by the\neffect on SATs levels after a year. It is impossible, however,\nto determine the longer term benefits (i.e., beyond 2 years)\ndue to the participating cohort being lost to a diverse second-\nary system once they leave primary school. Although no\nclaim for this improvement in terms of attainment can be\nmade for the project in isolation from other strategies used in\nthe school, staff across the school indicated that the Write\nHere project was hugely influential on attainment (particu-\nlarly by those struggling with writing), because of its impact\non pupil motivation and engagement.\nTable 1. Respondents' Attainment Levels Were Compared\nWith the Two Previous Year's SATs Results.\nCohort Involvement Results\nproject writer\n60% of the class achieved\nLevel 4 or above in\nproject writer in small\ninterventions\n65% children achieved\nLevel 4 or above in\nwriter over 2 terms\nand in the gallery\n73% children achieved\nLevel 4 or above in\nNote. SAT = Standard Assessment Test.\nRumney et al. 9\nThe Write Here project and strategies . . . have had a huge impact\non the writing attainment of children over the last two years\n[with]a dramatic increase in the number of children achieving\nLevel 4 or above. (Primary Literacy Coordinator)\nIn addition to above, a target group of six pupils was iden-\ntified, to analyze the more subtle sublevels attained by the\nchildren. Three out of six pupils demonstrated accelerated\nprogress, exceeding teacher expectations. These three reflect\na wide range of abilities and confidence as writers.\nI feel really confident at writing stories than I did before . . . I can\nplace a lot of punctuation with writing before and I'm not really\ngood at SATs but getting higher at the level. It makes me feel\ngood about myself. (Pupil, Mellers)\nThree other pupils also met expectations; one was high\nability technically, but poor in terms of actual content, which\nnevertheless improved; the other had both Special Needs\nand English as a second language, therefore their \"average\"\nprogress was regarded as \"very good\" for a child with this\nparticular learning needs. The third pupil, a refugee with no\nEnglish on arrival, made a five sublevels increase in a year.\nThe teacher assessments for the children's work indicate\nthat all these six pupils made \"very good progress\" in writ-\ning skills and imaginative content through the project, and\nthat this is reflected in their attainment. Since the study was\nconducted, there has been a change in the way \"progress\" is\nmeasured in primary schools. The idea of \"levels and sub-\nlevels\" attained across a child's lifetime in primary school\nhas been abandoned and replaced with a more \"age appro-\npriate\" approach. When the project data were collected,\nhowever, the old \"levels\" system of progress measurement\nindicated that greater than expected progress had been made,\nas indicated in the specific examples cited.\nEngagement With the Art Gallery\nDuring the project, teacher evaluations attested to the effec-\ntiveness of the gallery-based work in motivating children to\nspeak and write, irrespective of their age:\nPupils began to develop their own narratives for the paintings\nthrough discussion . . . their individual work enabled them to\nfocus on their language choices. (Year 8 Teacher)\nAt the heart of the pedagogy was play, stillness, reflection,\nand nonobjective led learning.\n[This was] a new way of thinking about art and writing, [giving]\na sense of ownership of their work, [and offering] the use of\nreflection (both kinds!) to build thinking skills and the space to\ncreate. (Year 8 Teacher)\nOf the 28 lead teachers who attended, two found the approach\nchallenging because they had expectations that children\nwould be \"doing more writing\" to develop their literacy. The\nchildren's imaginative, passionate, and unusual follow-up\nwriting subsequently submitted to the gallery by these teach-\ners attested to the powerful motivation and inspiration\nachieved by the Write Here methodology.\nMotivation\nThirty children from Year 5 (Mellers, 2011 cohort) scored\neach activity in the Write Here project out of 10 (Figure 4).\nThe average scores for most activities are high, demonstrat-\ning that the work motivated the children and offered a range\nof activities that appealed to all abilities. The lowest average\nscores are given to some of the more technical aspects of the\nwork, such as writing backward. However, teacher observa-\ntions indicate that some of the children were marking these\naspects down because they were difficult, rather than because\nthey were unhelpful, and that these strategies were useful to\nthe whole group, however unusual and challenging.\nGallery Work: Legacy Project\nAfter the main Write Here project ended, 700 Key Stage 2\npupils from inner city Nottingham schools have visited the\nin the legacy program of literacy workshops. These work-\nshops have been delivered in the gallery by 28 graduate and\nundergraduate volunteers, who have been mentored and\ntrained in cascade fashion by the original research team.\nFaced with competition for scarce time and resources in\nschools, the literacy work has proved to be an effective mag-\nnet to bring pupils into the gallery. Teachers have been able\nto make a pragmatic choice to engage with both the \"nuts and\nbolts\" of writing and with a cultural site in one visit.\nIt was a great introduction to how interesting a gallery can be\nand how art can be used to develop literacy skills. . . . A great\nopportunity for a real writing experience to further develop the\nliteracy experience. . . . [It] Enthused students, many of whom\nreturned with family and friends in order to share their\nexperiences, and [it was] a great opportunity to see important\nworks of art that I believe they will appreciate even more as they\ngrow up. (Primary Arts Coordinator/Year 6 Teacher)\nConclusion\nFrom September 2014, children as young as 4 years old will\nbe expected to be able to write a sentence by the time they\nfinish their foundation stage year. Some children are able to\ndo this, but many still need time to play first. The New\nNational Curriculum states that all children will achieve\nexpected levels, regardless of special educational needs. This\nwill seriously affect many vulnerable children, and it is not\nclear how this will raise standards throughout the education\nsystem. The Write Here project demonstrated that the teach-\ning of writing skills should not be undertaken simply for\ntheir own sake, or solely for utilitarian purposes. Participating\npupils regarded \"pointless\" writing as demotivating, and this\nattitude affects their attainment. The project demonstrated\nhow effectively an art gallery could be used to enable chil-\ndren, of all ages, to make a personal connection to art, talk\nabout it, be motivated to write about it, and support that writ-\ning with specific skills acquisition. The project scaffolded a\nprocess of ownership for the children, demystifying the writ-\ning process, and demonstrating to pupils that they are not\nalone in struggling to express themselves.\nThis work, in both the art gallery and the classroom, led to\na series of impacts. First, children developed (a) a significant\nimprovement in literacy attainment, especially in sublevels,\nand (b) increasing confidence to express themselves in writ-\ning, irrespective of their \"ability.\" The children no longer\nsaw \"writing\" as \"work.\" Second, professional writers were\nenabled to achieve a greater understanding of their potential\nto influence young writers, whereas student writers acquired\nimportant workplace skills and knowledge (public speaking,\npresentation, teamwork), which affected their abilities to fos-\nter writing and others in the future. In the longer term, the\nstudy demonstrated impact in embedding experiential learn-\ning strategies developed by the research team, and subse-\nquently implemented by teachers into the school curriculum.\nThe study evidenced the importance of creative, playful,\nmultimodal activities in fostering both motivation and\nachievement in children's writing. It also indicated what a\npowerful site for learning an art gallery can be, due to the\npossibilities for individual interpretation and empathy that\nvisual art can offer the young writer. At the same time, the\nstudy also acknowledges that formal structures can be used\nintelligently and creatively to liberate pupils' imaginations,\nand consequently enable them to express themselves coher-\nently. Paradoxically, to achieve what many might consider to\nbe a \"prosaic\" goal--the raising of attainment--this work\ndrew on the most \"poetic\" of ideas--the practice of playing\nwith form to discover meaning. This process enabled a fun-\ndamental principle underpinning the work, namely, that\nyoung people have something important to communicate\nabout their experience of the world, and that \"seeing\" things\nand \"doing\" things have a vital role in enabling them to give\nwitness to their lives through the written and spoken word.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAdes, A., & McCLean, A.
