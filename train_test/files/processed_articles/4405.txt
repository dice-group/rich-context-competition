Only patents with complete medical records, preoperative computed tomography scans\nusing typical imaging and follow-up data were included.\nResults: A total of 79 patients were enrolled in the study. Technical and clinical success rates were\n100% and 91% (n \u00bc 72), respectively. Only two patients experienced major complications. Post-\nembolization syndrome (i.e. fever, abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting) was reported in 68 (86%)\npatients, but all symptoms were mild and resolved with conservative measures. Mean radiological\ntumours decreased in size; mean \u00c6 SD tumour size significantly decreased from 8.4 \u00c6 3.5 cm\npre-embolization to 6.7 \u00c6 3.0 cm post-embolization.\nConclusions: This study provides long-term evidence that SAE is a safe and effective method in\nthe treatment of patients with renal AMLs.\n",

Only patents with com-\nplete medical records, preoperative CT scans\nusing typical imaging and follow-up data\nwere included. Demographic data, type of\nAMLs (sporadic or TSC-related), clinical\nsymptoms, tumour size and location, tech-\nnical success, clinical success, complications\nand tumour relapse were recorded by one of\nthree investigators (G.N., Z.Y. or B.Z.). The\nprimary indications for SAE were acute\nhaemorrhage, haematuria, pain or asymp-\ntomatic size greater than 4 cm. Indications\nfor unplanned repeat embolization included\nuncontrolled symptoms, re-bleeding and\nsubsequent increase in the size of the mass.\nThis study received institutional review\nboard approval from the Ethics Committee\nof Peking University First Hospital, Beijing,\nChina before commencement and because it\nwas a retrospective study, patient informed\nconsent was not required.\nAngiography methods\nAngiography was performed in all patients\nunder local anaesthesia via the femoral\nartery. Abdominal aortography had been\ntaken to identify renal arteries and exclude\nalternative feeding vessels. In addition,\nselective renal arteriography was performed\nthrough a standard 5-F catheter (Figure 1).\nOnce the feeding vessels to the targeted\nAML were identified, they were catheterized\nsupra-selectively using a coaxial microcath-\neter. Based on the size and number of\nthe feeding vessels of the tumour,\nan appropriate amount of embolic material\nhad been injected under continuous fluoro-\nscopic guidance to prevent reflux and non-\ntarget embolization. Bleomycin-lipiodol\npolyvinyl alcohol (PVA) particles were\nused as embolic agents to interrupt the\nblood flow of the AMLs. Coils were also\napplied to seal feeding vessels when aneur-\nysms were found on the angiograms. Coils\nare increasingly used to treat aneurysms and\nprovide satisfactory proximal occlusion as a\ncomplement to distal occlusion to maximize\nthe embolic effect and so facilitate the rapid\ncessation of blood flow in a targeted inflow\nartery.12 If the lesion was large or had\nmultiple feeding vessels, embolization was\nstaged to keep complication rates low.6\nTumour size was measured as the max-\nimal diameter on axial CT images and the\nshrinkage rate was calculated by comparing\nthe change in the cross-sectional diameter of\nthe lesion with previous imaging. Technical\nsuccess was defined as tumour vascular\nocclusion characterized by cessation of\nflow in the target vessels and lack of\ntumour staining. Clinical success was\ndefined as no worsening of symptoms, no\nevidence of severe complications attributed\nto SAE and/or a re-bleeding episode after\nSAE. Post-embolization syndrome was\ndefined as fever, abdominal pain, nausea or\nvomiting after SAE that the patient experi-\nenced during hospitalization. Tumour\nrelapse after SAE was defined as recurrent\nsymptoms (i.e. flank pain, tumour bleeding,\nor tumour rupture) requiring further treat-\nment or tumour growth larger than 2.0 cm\nmeasured according to follow-up images.\nHowever, if a repeat embolization was used\nFigure 1.

Tumours selected for\nstaged treatment at initial presentation\nwere not deemed failures due to repeat\nembolization as part of this treatment plan.\nStatistical analyses\nNominal variables were summarized as\ncounts and percentages whereas continuous\nvariables were reported as mean \u00c6 SD. To\ncompare groups, 2-test and Student's t-test\nwere used for nominal data and continuous\nvariables, respectively.

Bleomycin-\nlipiodol emulsion and PVA were success-\nfully used as the main embolic agents in this\npresent study. Bleomycin, a complex of 11\nglycopeptide antitumour antibiotics,13\nacts by intercalation of DNA and RNA.14\nLipiodol has the advantage over other\nembolic agents of causing permanent occlu-\nsion at a capillary level and hence inducing\ntissue necrosis.15 Lipiodol also aids in the\nvisualization of the embolic mixture, which\nhelps prevent reflux and non-target embol-\nization. PVA is available with different\nparticle sizes and is considered a permanent\n500 mm, PVA facilitates occlusion of the\ndistal vascular bed of the tumour.17 Only a\nsmall proportion of patients (13%) in this\nstudy required additional coiling of\naneurysms.\nIn this present study of 79 patients at a\nsingle centre in China, SAE for renal AMLs\nachieved a technical success of 100%, clin-\nical success of 91% and tumour shrinkage\nwas significant. The present findings of a\nmean \u00c6 SD reduction in axial dimension of\nprevious report18 and demonstrate the effi-\ncacy of SAE on renal AMLs. In addition,\nthe present results were similar to the con-\nclusions of a systematic review of 31 studies\nthat involved 524 AML cases treated with\ntransarterial embolization, which found a\nmean technical success rate of 93.3% and\nno procedural mortality.19 However,\nthe authors reported that among 263\nAML patients with a mean follow-up of\n39 months, angiomyolipoma was reduced by\nthan the present result (mean \u00c6 SD decrease:\n1.7 \u00c6 1.3 cm). A possible explanation for the\ndiscrepancy may be the difference in the\nradiological follow-up period; the mean\nfollow-up period for the present study was\nThis present study found no differences in\npre-embolization mass size, decrease in\nmass size with embolization, complications,\nrequirement for repeat embolization or\nhaemorrhage between patients with and\nwithout TSC. Treatment options for\nAMLs are often complicated by the presence\nof bilateral and multiple lesions, which\nparticularly affect the TSC subgroup.20 In\nthe present study, 71% of patients had\nmultiple lesions, rendering traditional surgi-\ncal techniques for preserving renal function,\nsuch as partial or total nephrectomy, a less\nfavourable option.6 TSC is an autosomal\ndominant disease affecting approximately\n2 million people globally.21 Mutations in\nthe TSC1 and TSC2 genes, important regu-\nlators of the mammalian target of rapamy-\ncin (mTOR) signalling pathway, result in\nthe development of tumours involving mul-\ntiple organ systems.22 As many as 80% of\npatients with TSC develop renal AMLs and\nthe tumours are frequently bilateral and\nAs observed in this present study, several\npatients may have multiple, large or\nre-growing AMLs that require re-\nembolization. However, repeated emboliza-\ntions may cause loss of normal renal\nparenchyma and renal function. Therefore,\nan effective pharmacological treatment is\nrequired to address this problem. A recent\nstudy suggests that the mTOR inhibitor,\neverolimus, may become an effective treat-\nment option for AMLs in TSC patients.24\nMoreover, everolimus is currently licenced\nin Europe and USA for the treatment of\nAMLs in adult patients with TSC. As more\ndata from large clinical trials becomes avail-\nable, mTOR inhibitors may be approved for\nthe treatment of TSC-AMLs worldwide.\nA main limitation of the present study\nwas its retrospective design. In addition, the\nsample size was small; several patients had\nto be excluded from the study because they\nlacked complete radiological follow-up\ndata. Prospective studies are required to\nconfirm these findings and better evaluate\nthe characteristics of AMLs and clinical\noutcomes.\nIn conclusion, this present study provides\nlong-term evidence that SAE using bleomy-\ncin-lipiodol emulsion and PVA is a safe and\neffective method in controlling haemor-\nrhage, improving clinical symptoms and\npreventing tumour progression in patients\nwith renal AMLs.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
