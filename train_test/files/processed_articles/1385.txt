Most teen pregnancies in the USA are unin-\ntended and due to a combination of contraceptive nonuse and contra-\nceptive failure (Manlove et al., 2004). The association between poor\ncontraceptive use and teen pregnancy is supported by studies demon-\nstrating that improved use of contraception played a key role in redu-\nHowever, despite the encouraging trend toward fewer teen pregnan-\ncies, a summary of health services used by teen women published by\nthe National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy reveals that over\nhalf of women aged 15\u00ad19 did not access any reproductive health\ncare in the year preceding the 2002 survey (Suellentrop et al.,\n2008). If these women are at risk for pregnancy, it follows that\nthere is an unmet need for reproductive health care among young\nwomen in the USA.\nA recent analysis of sexual and reproductive health service use\namong US women of reproductive age (15\u00ad44) shows that,\nwhereas overall use of sexual and reproductive health care services\nvices sharply rose over the same period of time, especially among the\nyoungest women (Frost, 2008). On the basis of these results, we seek\nThis study was presented at the 2008 National Survey of Family Growth Research Conference, Hyattsville, MD, USA in 16\u00ad17 October 2008.\n& The Author 2009.

We\nexpand our population to include women less than 25 years old, as\nthey account for half of all abortions performed in the USA (Guttma-\ncher Institute, 2008) and half of all sexually transmitted infections\n(Weinstock et al., 2004); the proportion of pregnancies that are unin-\ntended is also highest in this age group (Finer and Henshaw, 2006).\nWe control for sexual experience in this analysis, with the understand-\ning that not all young women have the same reproductive health\nneeds.\nOur study also looks at factors associated with the types of repro-\nductive health services obtained by young women. Results of the 1995\nand 2002 National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) surveys indicate\nthat publicly-funded family planning clinics are more likely to provide\ncontraceptive counseling and STD testing and treatment to women\nclinics receiving Medicare funding. In 2003, fewer family planning clinics\nprovided free reproductive health care services to adolescents than in\nincrease in contraceptive service use over this period, women\nacross the USA may not have equally participated in this increase in\nservice use. Thus, in this context of resource vulnerability and\nreduced provision of family planning services to the poorest teens,\nwe analyze the distribution of reproductive health services for preven-\ntive care obtained by women aged 15\u00ad24 who participated in the\nMaterials and Methods\nthe NSFG, a population-based survey conducted by the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics\nto provide national data on contraception, infertility, sexuality and health\nof men and women in the USA (Lepkowski et al., 2006). For both the\nsample representing the household population of the USA, 15\u00ad44 years\nof age. In-person interviews were conducted in the homes of 10 847\nand Hispanic women. The response rate was 80%. The interviews were\nvoluntary and confidential. The study was approved by the Institutional\nReview Panel for Human Subjects at Princeton University.\nFor the purposes of this study, we restricted the population analyzed to\nwomen between the ages of 15 and 24. We analyzed data only from\nwomen who were not currently pregnant and who had not received pre-\nnatal or post-natal care in the past year, as we hypothesized that repro-\nductive health service use by women who were either pregnant or had\nrecently given birth would be disproportionately greater than that of the\ngeneral population. With these restrictions, our study population was\nreproductive health service use in the last 12 months for all women\n15\u00ad24. We then stratify the results by sexual activity status (`ever had\nsex' and `never had sex') and further explore changes over time by focus-\ning on the use of reproductive health services for preventive care, which\nwe divided into two categories: `contraceptive services' and `other preven-\ntive reproductive health services.' Contraceptive services include consul-\ntation, prescription and/or counseling for birth control (including\nsterilization). In addition, women in the 2002 survey were also asked if\nthey had received a prescription or counseling for emergency contracep-\ntion. Only 11 of the 156 women who received emergency contraception\nservices did not report other contraceptive service use. These women\nrepresent 0.3% of the total population receiving contraceptive services.\nOther reproductive health services for preventive care include pap\nsmears, pelvic exams and STI testing or treatment (excluding HIV\ntesting and treatment). The NSFG questionnaire did not allow for the dis-\ntinction between STI treatment and STI testing. It was not possible to\ndetermine the category of reproductive health services used by\ntest (which may have been performed in a non-reproductive health care\nsetting) and 32 denied receiving any of the 13 types of reproductive\nhealth services examined in the 1995 survey. In addition, 52 women\ndescribed having used abortion services only (n \u00bc 6), or having only\nreceived a pregnancy test (n \u00bc 48). These women as well as the\n73 described above were considered to have received services other\nthan preventive care services.\nIn the second part of the analysis, we compare the determinants of con-\ntraceptive service use and other reproductive health preventive care\nhad sex and never had sex). We test for changes in the patterns of\nhealth care use over time. Finally, as we identified different determinants\nhealth care use changed over time, we present a multivariate analysis\nfor determinants of the use of the two types of preventive reproductive\nhealth services (contraceptive and other services) for the most recent\nyear 2002. The multivariate models included all variables for which\nP-values were 0.25 or lower in the univariate analysis. All analyses were\nperformed using logistic regression models. Changes in the patterns of\nhealth care use were tested by introducing an interaction term between\nthe survey year in the factors associated with the use of services. The ana-\nlyses were performed using Stata 10 SE (Stata Corporation, College\nStation, TX, USA). Data are weighted to account for the complex\nsampling design of the NSFG surveys (unequal probabilities of being\nincluded in the survey). The numbers shown in the tables are unweighted,\nbut the percentages are weighted.\nResults\nWe found no difference in the overall use of reproductive health ser-\nthe use of these services for preventive care only (Table I) In both\nsurvey years, most women used a combination of preventive care ser-\nvices during the 12 months preceding the survey. Thus, among women\nwho received at least one preventive care service, 11% received con-\ntraceptive services alone, 23% received other preventive care services\nalone and 66% received both. When stratifying use of reproductive\nhealth services by women's sexual activity status, we found a 4.8%\npoint increase in the use of preventive care services (including contra-\nceptive services, STI testing/treatment, pap smear and pelvic exam)\namong women who had ever had sex. Results also indicate that\npreventive services sought.

Only the last\nfactor was associated with contraceptive service use among women\nwho had never had sex.\nThe second multivariate model analyzing factors associated with\nother preventive reproductive health service use in 2002 shows that\nthe use of these services among those who were sexually experienced\nvaried according to women's socioeconomic background. In particu-\nlar, women not in the labor force/school were less likely to report\nusing these services in the previous 12 months. The same was true\nfor women who were less educated or had less educated mothers.\nConversely, women with at least one sexual partner in the last\n12 months and black women were more likely to have sought these\nservices in the last year. Among women who had never had sex\nolder age, higher level of education, and reporting difficulty with men-\nstruation or ovulation were all predictive of service use (Table VI).\nDiscussion\nreproductive health service use among young women in the USA con-\nceals widening socioeconomic disparities in use of these services.\nAlthough the study shows a 10% point average increase in the use\nof services for contraception, young women of low socioeconomic\nstatus enjoyed smaller increases in use of these services. These\ngrowing social differentials are even more striking when it comes to\nother reproductive health services for preventive care (pelvic\nexams, pap smears, STD testing/treatment). Use of these services\nhas remained stable on average; however, it has sharply declined\namong the socially disadvantaged, including women who were\nforeign born and lacking insurance coverage. In a recent analysis of\nreproductive health service use by type of provider in the USA\nceptive service use among women of reproductive age (15\u00ad44) is\nalmost entirely due to an increase in contraceptive care received by\nwomen visiting private doctors. In contrast, she shows the delivery\nof contraceptive services by other providers has remained unchanged\n(Frost, 2008). These findings may partly explain why contraceptive\nservice use has mostly improved among the most advantaged young\nwomen but has stagnated among others.\nOur results suggest that disparate use of reproductive services for\npreventive care is rooted in social inequalities, perhaps more pro-\nconclusions of a recent report expressing concern over the lack of\nimprovement in contraceptive use among poor women in the USA.\nThis plateau comes after a period of continuous improvement in contra-\nceptive use following the passage of Title X of the Public Health Service\nAct in 1970, legislation enacted to provide publicly subsidized family\nplanning (Boonstra, 2008). There was a 4% increase in contraceptive\nnon-use among women at risk of an unintended pregnancy between\nwomen with lower education and lower income (Boonstra, 2008). In\na representative sample of US women at risk for unintended pregnancy\ninterviewed in 2004, Frost and colleagues found that less educated\nwomen were only a third as likely to use any form of contraception\nas those who had a college degree (Frost et al., 2007). They also\nfound a greater risk of not using contraception among women who\nreported having no healthcare provider. Such disparities ultimately\nwiden the socioeconomic gap among women experiencing unintended\npregnancy. In a similar vein, Finer and Henshaw show that between\nlescents, college graduates and the wealthiest women but increased\namong poor and less educated women (Finer and Henshaw, 2006).\nInterestingly, we found that lack of health insurance, often cited as a\nculprit in deterring use of prescription contraceptive methods, was\nnot significantly associated with contraceptive service use, after control-\nling for other socio-economic factors (Culwell and Feinglass, 2007).\nImproving reproductive healthcare coverage for women in the USA is\nan essential step towards reducing social inequalities (Ranji et al.,\n2007), but this alone is unlikely to close the gap. Indeed, as Boonstra\nargues in an analysis of government program impact on reproductive\nhealth inequalities, targeted initiatives have limited impact in solving\nthe multidimensional cause of these disparities.\n................................................... ..........................................\n.............................................................................................................................................................................................\nTable IV Continued\nDeterminants of other\nreproductive health\npreventive service use\nin the last year\nEver had sex Interaction\nby year of\nsurvey\nNever had sex Interaction\nby year of\nsurvey\nArea of residence\nHas had trouble with ovulation/menstruation\nReproductive health service use among young women 3015\nIn contrast to many studies, our results show greater use of contra-\nceptive services among the youngest women.
