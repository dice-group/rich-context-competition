Disease-modifying antirheumatic\ndrugs (DMARDs) represent the standard of care for RA,\nwith demonstrated ability to reduce pain and disability\n(1). Whereas the traditional model of RA treatment had\nbeen a \"pyramid\" approach, beginning with nonsteroidal\nantiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and glucocorticoids for\nthe first phase of treatment, the recommended strategy\nnow includes immediate DMARD therapy (1). These agents\nare recommended by the major rheumatologic societies,\nand in rheumatic disease specialty practices more than\n90% of patients with RA received DMARDs (1\u00ad3). This\napproach has been widely embraced. In fact, US national\ncare quality organizations have included DMARD treat-\nment for RA as a performance standard (4).\nSince the 1990s, DMARD options have proliferated with\nincreased numbers of both synthetic small molecules and\nbiologic treatments, e.g., tumor necrosis factor inhibitors,\nB cell depleting therapy, a costimulatory agonist, and an\ninterleukin-6 antagonist (5). Despite the increased number\nof DMARD options and the agreement on their importance\nin RA, several studies suggest that many patients do not\nreceive these therapies. A study using Medicare data from\nciaries with RA filled a DMARD prescription during the 12\nmonths after cohort entry (6). Data from British Columbia\n1Daniel H.

Furthermore, a very recent study using data from\nMedicare Managed Care plans found that 59% of benefi-\n(8). These studies suggest that there may be widespread\nunderuse of DMARDs for RA, yet the reasons remain un-\nclear. Prior studies identified older age, depression, and\nlack of a rheumatology visit as correlates of not using a\nDMARD (6\u00ad8), suggesting potential disparities in DMARD\nuse. However, these studies covered a short duration and\nfocused on a relatively narrow range of patients, mostly\nolder Medicare beneficiaries.\nTo overcome these limitations, we examined DMARD\nuse for RA using nationally representative data on office\nvisits with physicians from the National Ambulatory Med-\nical Care Survey (NAMCS) (9). Based on previous studies\nfrom other therapeutic areas suggesting that the receipt of\nspecific interventions often differs by race (10\u00ad13), we\nexamined the effect of race, ethnicity, and physician spe-\ncialty on DMARD prescribing. The effects of race and\nethnicity were first analyzed in the whole cohort. To ex-\namine whether access to rheumatology care modified a\npossible race and ethnicity effect, we also analyzed this\nrelationship in samples stratified on whether the visit was\nwith a rheumatologist.\nStudy sample. We studied data from the NAMCS, an\nannual visit-based cross-sectional survey conducted in\nphysicians' offices. The NAMCS includes a nationally rep-\nresentative probability sample of ambulatory physician\npractices across the US using a multistage cluster strategy,\nselecting physicians by geographic location and provider\nspecialty. Physicians and their office staff are trained to\ncomplete the survey for all visits in a randomly sampled\nweek. The purposeful sampling strategy and use of\nweights allows one to generalize to the 650 million office\nvisits made annually to physicians in the US. Physicians\nand patients are not sampled repetitively across years.\nOur study sample consisted of all visits recorded in the\namong any of the diagnoses on the visit survey form. The\nstudy protocol was approved by the Institutional Review\nBoard of the Partners Healthcare System.\nRA treatment. Up to 8 new or ongoing medications and\nup to 3 diagnoses were recorded for each visit in the\nNAMCS. The primary outcome for these analyses was\nDMARD prescribing as recorded on the visit survey form.\nWe included nonbiologic DMARDs (azathioprine, cyclo-\nsporine, D-penicillamine, gold preparations, hydroxychlo-\nroquine, leflunomide, methotrexate, and sulfasalazine)\nand biologic DMARDs (abatacept, adalimumab, anakinra,\netanercept, infliximab, and rituximab). A variable on the\nsurvey indicates whether the prescription is new or a\ncontinuation. Prescriptions for oral glucocorticoids, opi-\noids, and NSAIDs (nonselective and selective) were also\nassessed.\nPotential correlates of DMARD prescribing. The NAMCS\nvisit data include a limited set of variables possibly related\nto DMARD prescribing. These include: 1) sociodemo-\ngraphic variables concerning the presenting patient, such\nas age, sex, race (white, African American, and other),\nethnicity (Hispanic, non-Hispanic, and unknown), health\ninsurance coverage, and region of residence, 2) the number\nof non-DMARD drugs prescribed, and 3) the type of pro-\nvider who conducted the visit. We categorized the types of\nproviders as rheumatologists or nonrheumatologists.\nStatistical analyses. We assessed the percentage of RA\nvisits associated with a DMARD prescription for each of\nthe 12 study years. The variables were compared across\nvisits with and without DMARDs, and then risk ratios\n(RRs) were estimated using generalized linear models ac-\ncounting for the clustered nature of the visits and sampling\nweights. The unit of analysis is the visit coded for RA\nand not persons with RA; RA cases are not followed lon-\ngitudinally over 12 years since different RA individuals\nare sampled every year. The variables associated with\nDMARD use were examined in a series of models with an\nincreasing number of covariates, testing whether the effect\nof race and/or ethnicity was diminished with increasing\nadjustment. Region of residence and health insurance sta-\ntus were not significant predictors in univariate or multi-\nvariate models and were removed from analyses. We\nadded the rheumatologist covariate as the last variable to\ndetermine whether the effect of race and ethnicity was\nmediated by access to rheumatology care. Based on initial\nresults, we further examined whether the effect of race and\nethnicity were modified by rheumatology care by compar-\ning RRs in 2 sets of adjusted models, i.e., 1 for visits to\nrheumatologists and 1 for visits to nonrheumatologists. We\nalso assessed the interaction effect of race and ethnicity by\nrheumatology care. We used SUDAAN statistical software,\nversion 10.0.1 (Research Triangle Institute) to account for\nthe complex survey design.\nRESULTS\nWe identified 859 visits with a diagnosis of RA over the\n12-year study period.

Oral glucocorticoids and NSAIDs/coxibs\nwere each used by one-quarter to one-third of subjects\nwith RA without any clear time trends.\nDISCUSSION\nThe early and aggressive use of DMARDs has improved the\ncare and outcomes of RA (14,15). However, several studies\nsuggest that the potential benefits of DMARDs are not\nbeing reaped by many people experiencing RA because of\nunderuse of these agents (6\u00ad8). To guide strategies to\nimprove DMARD use, a better understanding of this prob-\nlem and its determinants is required. We examined data\nfrom a US national survey conducted over a 12-year time\nperiod and investigated whether race and/or ethnicity dis-\nparities exist in DMARD utilization.\nOver the study period, we found that fewer than half of\nRA visits listed a DMARD and the DMARD treatment rates\nimproved only slightly over the 12-year study period. This\nwas surprising as a substantial increase has been noted in\nseveral other studies (6,8). It is unclear whether the rela-\ntively small increase that we observed in comparison to\nother studies was due to differences in the population or\nwas related to how DMARD use was measured. African\nAmerican race was a significant correlate of DMARD non-\nuse, with African Americans having a 30% reduced utili-\nzation of any DMARD compared to whites; similar trends\nwere observed for biologic DMARDs. African American\nrace was noted to be a correlate of DMARD nonuse in\nanother US study among Medicare beneficiaries (6). As\nwell, African American race has been found to be corre-\nlated with less frequent use of many health services, in-\nTable 2.

This\nsuggests that lack of access to a rheumatologist may be one\nmediator of the racial disparity. There was also evidence\nthat the effect of African American race was modified by\nwhether or not the visit was to a rheumatologist (Table 3).\nHealth insurance status was not significantly associated\nwith use of DMARDs.\nWhile seeing a rheumatologist was strongly associated\nwith DMARD use for all racial and ethnic groups, most\npersons with RA are not seen by rheumatologists in the US\nuse has increased slightly over a period of time despite\nthe following: 1) at least 5 new DMARDs were introduced,\n2) scientific data clarified the important role of DMARDs\n(15), and 3) DMARDs for RA became a quality measure for\nhealth plans in the US. The lack of prescribing improve-\nment speaks to the slow pace with which medical practice\ncatches up to clinical evidence, i.e., 17 years as estimated\nby the Institute of Medicine (21).\nThis study has important limitations, mostly associated\nwith the NAMCS. The NAMCS does not allow one to\nconfirm diagnoses. Therefore, it is impossible to know the\naccuracy of the RA code. Based on the calculated national\nestimates compared with other data sources, it is likely\nthat some visits coded with RA are inaccurate (22). Typi-\ncally, this type of misclassification biases toward the null,\nmaking it more difficult to observe the effect of other\nvariables, such as African American race. Moreover, the\nmedication lists are not validated against prescription\ndata, but prior work suggests that NAMCS data are accept-\nably accurate (23). The scope of the NAMCS is a great\nstrength of this study. The purposeful sampling strategy\nused by the NAMCS, including urban and rural areas and\npatients of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds, allows\none to generalize to the entire US. As well, we studied a\nrelatively large group of visits sampled over a long period.\nPrior studies are typically restricted to specific patient\ngroups or narrow geographic regions, while the NAMCS\nrepresents a national sample. However, the NAMCS does\nnot include information about several sociodemographic\nvariables of interest, including household income and ed-\nucation level. Health insurance status was not associated\nwith DMARD use in these data, but future studies should\nalso determine whether African American race is a surro-\ngate for socioeconomic issues and/or limited access. While\nthese variables may underlie some of the differences in\nDMARD treatment that we observed, the models presented\nherein point toward race as being an important patient\ncharacteristic that may serve as a useful target for further\nepidemiologic studies and interventions.\nIn conclusion, we studied 12 years of data from a na-\ntionally representative sample of ambulatory visits in the\nUS. Among the visits identified with a diagnosis of RA,\nonly 47% were associated with a DMARD. DMARDs were\nprescribed much less often for African Americans than for\nwhites, especially among visits to nonrheumatologists.\nThis finding suggests that part of the reason that African\nFigure 2.

Interventions should be considered to\nimprove DMARD prescribing, focusing particularly on pa-\ntients who do not see rheumatologists and on African\nAmerican patients who appear to have less access to rheu-\nmatologists. Health insurance status was not significantly\nassociated with DMARD use in these data, but future stud-\nies should also determine whether African American race\nis a surrogate for socioeconomic issues and/or limited\naccess.
