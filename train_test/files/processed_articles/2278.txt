Parallel trends in adolescent behaviors that drive this\nepidemic have not been well studied.\nWHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Analyses of recent data indicate the\nprevalence of overweight and obesity may be stabilizing. Over the\nsame period, adolescent physical activity, breakfast eating, and\nfruit and vegetable consumption increased and television viewing\nand consumption of sweets and sweetened beverages decreased.\nabstract\nOBJECTIVE: The high prevalence of adolescent obesity in the United\nStates has been attributed to population changes in physical activity\n(PA), sedentary behaviors, and dietary behaviors. This study examines\n8-year trends in these behaviors in US adolescents ages 11 to 16.\nMETHODS: Nationally representative samples of US students in grades\ntistage stratified designs, with census regions and grades as strata,\nand school districts as the primary sampling units. African-American\nand Hispanic students were oversampled to obtain better estimates\nfor those groups. Using the Health Behavior in School-aged Children\nquadrennial surveys, identical questions assessed BMI, PA, and\nsedentary and dietary behaviors at each school year. Logistic and\nlinear regression analyses were conducted taking into account the\nsampling design and controlling for age, gender, race/ethnicity, and\nfamily affluence.\nRESULTS: Across the quadrennial surveys, significant increases were\nidentified in number of days with at least 60 minutes of PA, daily con-\nsumption of fruits and vegetables, eating breakfast on weekdays and\nweekends, and BMI. Television viewing and consumption of sweets and\nsweetened beverages decreased across this same period. These same\npatterns were seen in all racial/ethnic groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: These patterns suggest that public health efforts to\nimprove the obesity-related behaviors of US adolescents may be\nhaving some success. However, alternative explanations for the\nincrease in BMI over the same period need to be considered.\nAUTHORS: Ronald J.

African-American\nand Hispanic students were over-\nsampled to obtain better estimates for\nthose groups. Participants completed\nthe Health Behavior in School-aged Chil-\ndren (HBSC) survey anonymously with\non the requirements of the partici-\npating school districts, active or\npassive parental consent were ob-\ntained. The study was approved by the\nInstitutional Review Board of the\nEunice Kennedy Shriver National In-\nstitute of Child Health and Human De-\nvelopment.\nMeasures\nDuring the middle of each school year,\ntrained assistants administered pa-\nper copies of the HBSC quadrennial\nsurveys, which contained identical\nquestions assessing BMI, PA, SB, and\nSocio-demographic Variables\nSocio-demographic variables included\ngender, age, race/ethnicity (white,\nAfrican-American, Hispanic, and other)\nand family affluence. An estimate of\nfamily socioeconomic status was pro-\nvided by the Family Affluence Scale: the\nadolescent having his/her own bed-\nroom, scored 0 = no, 1 = yes; frequency\nof family traveling vacations in the past\nthan twice; number of family com-\nputers,scored0=noneto3=morethan\n2;andnumberofmotorvehicles,scored\nwas used as a continuous covariate in\nanalyses with possible scores ranging\nPhysical Activity\nA definition of PA was provided, \"any\nactivity that usually increases your\nheart rate and makes you get out of\nbreath some of the time,\" with exam-\nples of qualifying activities and fol-\nlowed by an item that asked \"How often\nover the past 7 days have you been\nphysically active for a total of at least\n60 minutes per day.\" The measure has\nbeen shown to have acceptable validity\nSB: TV, Playing Video Games, and CU\nAmount of time viewing television was\nmeasured by the question \"About how\nmany hours a day do you usually watch\ntelevision (including videos and DVDs)\nin your free time.\" Video game playing\n(VG) time and CU (chatting on-line, In-\nternet, e-mailing, homework, etc) were\nranged from \"none at all\" to \"about 7 or\nmore hours a day.\" These HBSC items\nhave been shown to have acceptable\ntest-retest reliability (intraclass corre-\nand validity (rs ranged from 0.36 to\nweekdays and weekends, and a weighted\naverage of weekdays and weekend days\nwas computed.\nDietary Intake\nAs part of a validated brief food fre-\nquency questionnaire, participants were\nasked how many times a week they\nusually ate fruits, vegetables, sweets\n(chocolates and candy), and sweetened\nsoft drinks.19 The response options for\nthe items were scored as 1 = \"never,\"\n2 = \"less than once a week,\" 3 = \"once\nto 6 days a week,\" 6 = \"once a day, every\nday,\" and 7 = \"every day, more than\nonce.\"\nBreakfast\nParticipants were asked \"How often do\nyou usually have breakfast (more than\na glass of milk or fruit juice)\" sepa-\nrately for weekdays and weekends with\nchoices indicating the number of days.\nWeight Status\nAdolescents reported their heights and\nweights. Using BMI percentiles derived\nfrom the gender-specific BMI-for-age\ngrowth charts of the Centers for Dis-\nease Control and Prevention, weight\nstatus was categorized as follows: un-\nderweight or at risk for underweight\n(#15th percentile); normal weight\nARTICLE\nTrends in both BMI percentile and\nweight status were examined.\nStatistical Analyses\nRegression analyses were conducted\nfor continuous outcome variables with\neach outcome regressed on year, gen-\nder, age, and race/ethnicity.

This pattern of obesogenic\nbehaviors is not surprising given the\nhigh prevalence of cardiovascular\ndisease risk factors among US ado-\nlescents.2 Establishment of obeso-\ngenic behaviors during adolescence is\nimportant because PA and diet track\nfrom adolescence to adulthood.23\nFurthermore, there is evidence that\nmost US youth engage in multiple\nobesogenic behaviors, putting them at\ngreater risk for physical and psycho-\nlogical health problems and indicating\nthey could benefit from interventions\ntargeting PA, SB, and diet.24\nIt may be that current public health\nefforts are succeeding; the trends from\ntrast with earlier studies, PA increased\nandTV,themostprevalentSB,decreased\nperiod consumption of fruits and vege-\ntables and frequency of eating break-\nfast increased, whereas consumption\nof sweetened beverages and sweets\ndecreased. Yet it appears that the\nmagnitude of these changes in health\nbehaviors were not sufficient to re-\nverse the trends in weight status; BMI\nwas no significant increase in BMI from\nthe increase in adolescent obesity ob-\nserved over previous decades may be\nbeginning to stabilize.1 This leveling of\nthe obesity trend may be somewhat\nunique to the United States, and con-\ntinued improvements in PA, SB, and DB\nmay be necessary before the trend\nbegins to turn downward.4\nAlthough the overall trends in obeso-\ngenic behaviors were generally the\nsame for adolescents of different gen-\nder, age, and race/ethnicity over the\nperiod being studied, there were sig-\nnificant differences in the level of these\nbehaviorsacrossgender,age,andrace/\nethnicity. Consistent with previous\nstudies, boys report more PA than girls\nat all 3 times but also more screen-\nbased SB (TV and VG), with the excep-\ntion of CU, where girls exceeded boys.7,8\nIt should be noted that most studies of\nobesogenic SB have focused on TV and\nassociations between TV and diet,\nwhereas negative effects of VG or CU\nhave not been well established.25 Pre-\nvious studies have revealed mixed\nresults with respect to gender differ-\nences in diet; however, in our national\nsamples, girls exceeded boys in con-\nsumption of fruits and vegetables but\nalso reported eating sweets more fre-\nrisks for overweight and obesity, BMI\npercentiles, adjusted for age and gen-\nder, were higher in boys than girls.\nThus, the overall pattern of obesogenic\nbehaviors was not uniformly better in\none gender overanother: boys reported\nmore PA but also more SB; girls\nreported more frequent consumption\nof fruits and vegetables but also higher\nfrequency of consumption of sweets\nand lower frequency of eating break-\nfasts. Based on these findings, pedia-\ntricians might provide different advice\nfor boys and girls, and interventions\ncould be tailored to the adolescent's\ngender (eg, reducing SB in boys and\nincreasing PA in girls, or increasing\nfruit and vegetable consumption in\nboys and decreasing consumption of\nsweets in girls).\nAge differences in these behaviors sug-\ngest a disturbing trend consistent with\nyounger adolescents, older adolescents\nreported less PA, more CU, less frequent\nconsumption of fruits and vegetables,\nmore frequent consumption of sweets\nand sweetened soft drinks, and less\nfrequent consumption of breakfast on\nweek days. However, younger adoles-\ncents reported more frequent VG, a SB.\nEven though BMI percentiles controlled\nfor age and gender, based on age dif-\nferences in obesogenic behaviors, it\nshould be no surprise that the adjusted\nBMI percentiles were higher in older\nadolescents. Thus, it appears that obe-\nsogenic behaviors increase with age,\nand this increase corresponds with an\nincrease in obesity. Further study is\nneeded to determine whether it is more\nefficient for clinics and public health\nefforts to focus on unhealthy patterns in\nolderadolescents or if early intervention\nwith youngeradolescents would prevent\nthe increases seen in older adolescents.\nAlthough cardiovascular risk factors in\nUS adolescents are prevalent across\ndifferentrace/ethnicitygroups,African-\nAmerican and Hispanic youth in the\ncurrent studyreported higher BMIthan\nwhite and otheradolescents.2 Even with\nfamily affluence statistically controlled,\nPA was lower in Hispanic adolescents\ncompared with white adolescents;\nTV, VG, and CU were lowest in white\nadolescents; fruit, vegetable, and break-\nfast consumption was highest in white\nand otheradolescents; and consumption\nof sweets and sweetened soft drinks\nwere highest in African-American ado-\nlescents. These findings are consistent\nwith previous studies of obesogenic\nneighborhood access to recreational\nfacilities and produce markets, school\nfood services and policies affecting\nPA, and availability of healthful ver-\nsus unhealthful foods and support\nfor PA at home are potential socio-\nenvironmental contributors to racial/\nprevalence of overweight and obesity\nand the pattern of obesogenic behav-\niors in nonwhite groups confirm the\nneed to identify the social and envi-\nronmental conditions that influence\nthese behaviors in adolescents and the\nneed for interventions targeting the full\nrange of obesogenic behaviors in US\nminority children and adolescents.\nThe primary limitation of these data is\nthat they are based on self-report.\nHowever, the measures have been vali-\ndated, and other studies have revealed\ngood correlations between self-reported\nandmeasuredBMI,makingitsuitablefor\npopulation studies.37,38 Another limita-\ntion is that nationally representative\nsamples were maintained at each wave,\nwhereas matched samples could have\nreducedtheriskofsamplingbias.Finally,\nthesecross-sectionaldatadonotprovide\ninformation regarding the causal rela-\ntions between the behaviors and weight\nstatus. Further research is needed to\nexamine the differential effects of single\nand multiple obesogenic behaviors on\nthe development of overweight and obe-\nsity in US adolescents.24\nCONCLUSIONS\nEfforts to increase adolescent PA and\nreduce time spent watching television\nmay be working.

Relapse, which can be triggered simply by the memory\nof alcohol or drinking, is common. No easy intervention exists. However, recent\nresearch has brought greater understanding of the pathophysiology and po-\ntential treatment of alcohol abuse. As reported by The New York Times (Science:\nJuly 1, 2013), researchers used rats who had binged on alcohol for several weeks\nas an animal model of alcohol dependence. Following a short period of absti-\nnence, the rats were exposed to a minuscule amount of alcohol and then sub-\njected to brain scans to identify the pathways triggered by memories of alcohol.\nResearchers then gave the rats a single dose of rapamycin (also known as\nsirolimus), an immunosuppressant often used in transplantation that blocks\nactivation of the mTORC1 signaling pathway. Rats given rapamycin were signif-\nicantly less likely to \"relapse\" over the two weeks following re-exposure when\ncompared to rats not given rapamycin. How long the drug will be beneficial is not\nknown as the trial lasted only two weeks. While there is still significant research\nto be done on this topic, studies such as this one indicate that a pharmacologic\nsolution to alcohol abuse may not be a pipe dream.\nNoted by Leah H.
