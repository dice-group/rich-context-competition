Two questions are of immediate interest: First, what is\nthe relationship between vertical technology transfer (vtt) from a multina-\ntional to its local suppliers and the equilibrium degree of backward linkages?\nSecond, and perhaps more importantly, how does the nature of contractual\nrelationships between multinationals and their local suppliers affect the de-\ngree of backward linkages in the local industry?2 The objective of this paper\nis to shed light on these questions.\nWe develop a two-tier model in which the production of a final good\nrequires an intermediate good and market structure at both stages of pro-\nduction is oligopolistic. The model focuses on the entry decision of a multi-\nnational firm that produces the final good. Upon entry, the multinational\nsources the intermediate good locally and also engages in vertical technology\ntransfer (vtt) to its suppliers if it enters into a contractual relationship with\nthem. Under a contractual relationship, the selected suppliers must abide by\nan exclusivity condition that precludes them from serving other customers.\nExclusivity requirements in the context of international technology trans-\nfer are empirically relevant. In a recent survey of 413 companies in the au-\ntomobile sector in Central and Eastern Europe, Lorentzen and Mollgaard\n1The concept of linkages is due to Albert O. Hirschman (1958).\n2To the best of our knowledge, contractual relationships between multinationals and\ntheir suppliers have not received any attention in related analytical literature. Existing\nanalyses of backward linkages focus mainly on market interaction between multinationals\nand local firms.\n(2000) found that 61 percent of the automobile parts manufacturers had re-\nceived technology from their customers (automobile assemblers, which are\nmostly multinational companies), and 36 percent of the customers imposed\nan exclusivity condition on their suppliers. Similarly, according to Mizuno\n(1995), car component suppliers in South Korea can be classified into the fol-\nlowing types: (1) the exclusive type which supply over 75% of total produc-\ntion to their principal car manufacturers; (2) the semi-exclusive type which\nsupply 50-75 percent of total production to their principal car manufacturers;\nand (3) the dispersed type (and the independent type) which supply below\n50% of their total production to their principal car manufacturers.3\nOur focus on contractual relationships uncovers an interesting new effect\ncalled the de-linking effect. In fact, in our model, exclusivity necessarily\nimplies de-linking between local final good firms and their suppliers. Such de-\nlinking makes the intermediate good market less competitive due to market\nseparation (or foreclosure of competition) and can cause total output of the\nintermediate good (as well the final good) to shrink. This point emerges most\nsharply in the case where the intermediate good is produced by a duopoly\nand this case is discussed in detail toward the latter part of the paper.\nThe de-linking effect is reminiscent of an astute observation made by\nRodriguez-Clare (1996): when analyzing the effect of multinationals on back-\nward linkages in a host country, it is important to recognize that multination-\n3It is worth noting that multinationals have an incentive to impose exclusivity even\nin the absence of vtt. Driven by strategic considerations, a multinational may impose\nexclusivity on its suppliers so as to foreclose its local rivals from having access to a wide\nrange of suppliers. As the number of their suppliers declines, the multinational's local\nrivals are forced to pay a higher price for the intermediate goods, thereby giving a cost-\nadvantage to the multinational. This raising the rivals' cost motive and the potential\nanti-competitive effects of exclusivity practices on the part of multinational companies\nare discussed in the World Investment Report of 1997 (UNCTAD, 1997). See Salop and\nScheffman (1987) for the seminal contribution on cost raising strategies.\nals don't just create new linkages -- they also displace pre-existing linkages\nbetween local firms and suppliers. In our context, such displacement oc-\ncurs contractually whereas in Rodriguez-Clare it occurs if the multinational\nfinds it optimal to source intermediates from its source country headquarters\n(which is the case when communication costs are high). Thus, the present\npaper highlights an independent mechanism via which multinationals alter\nthe degree of linkages in the host country.\nOur model permits an investigation of conditions under which the multi-\nnational prefers to impose exclusivity on its local suppliers as well as factors\nthat lead the latter to accept such a condition. In general, a multinational\nfaces the following conflicting incentives. On the one hand, exclusivity seems\nnatural when viewed from the intellectual property protection perspective\nof the multinational: it has a strategic incentive to prevent its local rivals\nfrom benefitting from vtt and this can be accomplished via exclusivity. On\nthe other hand, the multinational would also like a large number of sup-\npliers to serve it in order to secure the intermediate at a more competitive\nprice. However, exclusivity tends to discourage local suppliers from serving\nthe multinational since they have to give up the opportunity of serving other\nlocal producers. It is shown that, in equilibrium, the multinational is able\nto implement exclusivity if and only if the extent of vtt exceeds a critical\nlevel. By contrast, when the degree of vtt is low, only a small number of\nlocal suppliers are willing to accept exclusivity, leading the multinational to\nprefer market interaction.\nThe literature on multinationals and technology transfer is vast and has\nexception of Pack and Saggi (2001) much of the analytical literature has ig-\nnored technology transfer between multinationals and their suppliers.4 This\nis unfortunate since empirical evidence on productivity spillovers indicates\nthat there is no guarantee that (horizontal) spillovers from multinationals to\ntheir local rivals will materialize whereas the evidence on vtt is quite pos-\nindustry, Lall (1980) notes that vtt can take places in several ways. A multi-\nnational might (1) help prospective suppliers set up production capacities;\n(2) provide technical assistance/information to raise the quality of suppliers'\nproducts and/or to facilitate innovations; and (3) provide training and help\nin management and organization. Our model captures channel (2) of vtt.\nThere exists a voluminous informal as well as empirical literature on back-\nward linkages. For example, the 1996 issue of the World Investment Report\nwas devoted entirely to the effects of foreign direct investment on backward\nlinkages in host countries. However, analytical models that explore the rela-\ntionship between multinationals and backward linkages in the host country\nare hard to come by. To the best of our knowledge, there exist only two such\nthese studies provide important insights regarding the two-way relationship\nbetween multinationals and linkages. Markusen and Venables (1999) note\nthat the entry of multinationals can have profound effects on backward link-\nages, industrial development, and welfare of the host country if such entry\nimpacts the structure of imperfectly competitive industries. In fact, one can\nmake a stronger statement: Since multinationals operate mostly in oligopolis-\ntic industries (see Markusen, 1995), their entry must have substantial effects\non local market structure, especially in small developing countries. In the\n4Pack and Saggi (2001) study vtt but their analysis assumes that the multinational\ncannot contractually prevent its suppliers from serving other firms.\nintermediate goods sector is monopolistically competitive so that foreign\ninvestment alters incentives for entry into such markets. In both models,\nEthier's (1982) formulation of the so called love-of-variety production func-\ntion for final goods, which is in turn derived from Dixit and Stiglitz (1977), is\nat the heart of the interaction between multinationals and local suppliers. By\ncontrast, we consider an environment where further entry into intermediate\nproduction is ruled out and the multinational's entry affects strategic inter-\naction amongst suppliers and final good producers, as well as local market\nstructure (the delinking effect).\nsize demand creation effects of multinationals on the host economy: multina-\ntionals generate derived demand for intermediate goods, thereby promoting\nlocal industrial development. In addition, the Markusen and Venables model\nalso allows for a competition effect wherein the entry of a multinational hurts\nits local rivals.5 Our model focuses on the supply-side effects of multination-\nals on local suppliers, although the demand creation and competition effects\nare also present in our model.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains the\nmodel, including the benchmark case of auraky. Section 3 examines the\nsubgame of market interaction and it highlights the demand creation effect\nof the multinational's entry. In Sections 4, entry via an exclusive contract is\nstudied. Section 5 derives the subgame perfect equilibrium of the entire game\nwhile section 6 focuses on the effects of exclusivity on backward linkages and\nlocal welfare in the case with two local suppliers. Section 7 concludes.\n5In Rodriguez-Clare (1996), the host country is assumed to be in a `bad' equilibrium\nwhere the final good is produced only by multinationals. As a result, the competition\neffect is absent in his model (which has substantial richness along other dimensions).\nThere are n  1 local producers of the final product, indexed by j, where\nj = 1, ..., n. One unit of the final good requires one unit of an intermediate\ngood. The intermediate good is produced at unit cost cI\nindexed by i, where i = 1...m. From hereon, intermediate good producers are\ncalled `suppliers' and final good producers are called just `producers'. The\nmarginal cost of a producer equals the sum of the price of the intermediate\ngood and the unit cost of transforming the input into the final product (given\nby c > 0). The demand for the final good is assumed to be linear p = a - Q\nand all firms are assumed to compete in the Cournot fashion (at both the\nupstream and downstream levels).\nOur interest lies in examining the effects of the entry of a multinational\nfirm (who produces the final good) on domestic industry. The multinational's\nmarginal cost of transforming the intermediate good is (1 - )c, where  \n[0, 1] measures the degree of its cost-advantage over local producers.6 As\na benchmark, we first describe market equilibrium in the absence of the\nmultinational.\n2.1 The benchmark case: autarky\nPrior to the entry by the multinational (referred to as autarky), producers\nand suppliers are linked in the following way: All producers buy the interme-\ndiate good via the open market wherein all suppliers compete. Denote the\nprice of the intermediate by w.\nGiven w, Cournot competition between local producers yields the aggre-\n6A large body of literature documents that multinational firms have technological ad-\nvantages over their local rivals (see Markusen, 1995).\ngate quantity Q produced by them\nQ =\nn(a - c - w)\n, i = 1, ..., n. (1)\nFrom above, the derived demand for the intermediate equals\nw = a - c -\nn\nCompetition among suppliers yields the following equilibrium output of a\ntypical supplier:\nqA\ni\n=\nn\nwhere   a - c - cI\n> 0. Substituting the equilibrium quantities into\nthe demand equation for the intermediate yields the equilibrium price of the\nintermediate:\nwA =\n\n+ cI\nThe profit of each supplier is easily calculated:\nA\ni\n= (wA - cI\n)qA\ni\n=\nSimilarly, the profit of each producer equals:\nA\nj\n= (a - mqi\n- c - wA)\nmqA\ni\nn\n=\nLet the aggregate level of output of the intermediate good measure the degree\nof backward linkages (BLA) under autarky:\nBLA = mqA\ni\n=\nmn\nTo explore the effects of the multinational's entry on local industry we now\nstudy an entry game wherein the multinational's choice regarding the mode\nof interaction with its local suppliers is endogenous.\n2.2 Entry by the multinational firm\nUpon its entry, the multinational competes with local producers in supplying\nthe final product. We assume that the multinational does not import the\nintermediate from abroad and sources it locally. Such local sourcing might\narise because of technological reasons (such as high transportation costs or\nthe costs of relying on far away suppliers) or due to policy restrictions (such as\nlocal content requirements imposed by the government in the host country).7\nFurthermore, as Rodriguez-Clare (1996) notes, producer services (such as\nbanking, auditing, consulting, wholesale services, transportation, machine\nrepair etc.) are nontradable goods and proximity between suppliers and\nproducers is essential. In any case, our focus is on how the multinational is\nlinked with local suppliers, given that it sources the intermediate locally.\nThe sequence of moves is as follows:\n\u00b7 First, the multinational chooses between two alternatives (i) an arms\nlength arrangement with its suppliers (i.e. market interaction) wherein\nit simply buys the intermediate from the market as an anonymous buyer\nand (ii) a contractual relationship that involves vertical technology\ntransfer (vtt) from the multinational to its suppliers . In exchange for\nvtt, the selected suppliers agree to serve the multinational exclusively\n(ex).\n\u00b7 If a contractual relationship is chosen, the multinational approaches k\nsuppliers called `invited suppliers', with the offer (vtt, ex).\n\u00b7 Then, the invited suppliers simultaneously decide whether or not to ac-\ncept the multinational's offer. Let S(k) denote the number of suppliers\n7See Qiu and Tao (2001) for an analysis of local content requirements when the final\ngood market is oligopolistic.\nthat accept the multinational's offer.\n\u00b7 Fourth, the multinational carries out vtt to its suppliers. The other\nm - S(k) suppliers serve local producers with their old technologies.\nPayoffs of all parties equal their respective Cournot profits given market\nstructure. If no suppliers accept the multinational's offer (i.e. S(k) =\n0), then all firms engage in anonymous market interaction.\nWe model vtt as a reduction in the marginal cost of the supplier from cI\nto cI\n-d where the parameter d captures the degree of vtt. Alternatively, we\ncan interpret vtt as an improvement in the quality of the intermediate good.\nSpecifically, with the help of the multinational, the product quality of local\nsuppliers is improved so that one-unit of the intermediate becomes equivalent\nto  units where   1. This means that a typical supplier's marginal cost\nof producing one effective unit of the intermediate becomes cI\n\n. Clearly, the\nreduction in the supplier's cost equals d = (1 - 1/)cI\n.\nWe next derive the subgame perfect equilibrium of the entry game, using\nthe standard backward induction procedure.\n3 Market interaction and demand creation\nUnder market interaction, the multinational sources the intermediate locally\nand all producers buy the intermediate good in the open market at the price\nw.8 Given w, downstream Cournot competition yields the following quanti-\nties for the multinational and the local producers:\nqf\n=\na - c + (n + 1)c - w\nand qj\n=\na - c - c - w\n8This assumption is standard in the literature and allows a comparison of our results\nThe derived demand for the intermediate equals\nQ = qf\n+ nqj\n w = a - c +\nc\n-\nComparing the above equation with equation (2), shows that the multina-\ntional's entry raises the derived demand for the intermediate through two\nchannels. First, the number of producers increases from n to n + 1 thereby\nincreasing the total output of the final product (as well as the quantity de-\nmanded of the intermediate -- i.e. the demand creation effect). Such demand\ncreation is evident in the fact the derived demand for the intermediate be-\ncomes flatter relative to autarky (its slope decreases from -(n + 1)/n to\n-(n + 2)/(n + 1)). The second channel through which the multinational\nraises demand for the intermediate is through its technological advantage\n(c) over local producers and this is captured by the term c/(n+1) in equa-\ntion (9). Because of this cost-advantage, the multinational producers a larger\nquantity than its local rivals. However, the flip side of this cost-advantage\neffect is the competition effect that is reflected in the decrease in the output\nof each local producer. Furthermore, the larger is  the greater the reduction\nin local producers' outputs. However, the aggregate output level increases\nwith . Note that the magnitudes of the competition and cost-advantage\neffects are negatively related to the number of local producers n.\nThe following observation is useful in understanding some of the results\nderived later in the paper.\nRemark 1: The demand creation effect of the multinational's entry de-\ncreases with the number of local producers (n).\nGiven the derived demand for the intermediate good, the Cournot output\nlevel of a typical supplier equals\nqM\ni\n=\n(n + 1) + c\nand its equilibrium profit equals\nM\ni\n=\n\u00a1\nqM\ni\n\u00a2\nThe profit of the multinational equals\nM\nf\n=\n\u00a3\nqM\nf\n\u00a4\n=\n\nm(n + 1) + c (n(m + 1)(n + 2) + m)\n\u00b8\nwhereas that of each local producer equals\nM\nj\n=\n\n\u00b8\nAs under autarky, the degree of backward linkages in the economy under\nmarket interaction equals BLM = mqM\ni\n. We have\nBLM - BLA = m(qM\ni\n- qA\ni\n) =\nm[ + (n + 1)c]\nProposition 1: When the multinational buys the intermediate good via\nthe market, its entry increases the degree of backward linkages in the local\nindustry relative to autarky.\nConsider next how the multinational's entry under an exclusive contract\naffects local industry.\n4 Exclusive contract\nUnder an exclusive contractual relationship, local suppliers are divided into\ntwo groups: those who supply the multinational only and those who supply\nlocal producers only. Without of loss of generality, suppose that the 1...k\nsupply the multinational while k + 1...m supply local producers. While the\nsuppliers of the multinational are delinked from the rest of the local final\ngood producers, they receive vtt from the multinational. Let wf\nand wh\ndenote the unit prices of the intermediate paid by the multinational and\nlocal producers respectively. Given these prices, the multinational's marginal\ncost of production equals wf\n+ (1 - )c while that of local producers equals\nwh\n+ c. Under Cournot competition downstream, the equilibrium output of\nthe multinational equals\nqf\n=\na - c + (n + 1)c - (n + 1)wf\n+ nwh\nwhile that of a typical local producer equals\nqj\n=\na - c - c - 2wh\n+ wf\nRewriting the above two equations in terms of prices gives the derived\ndemands from the multinational and local producers respectively:\nwf\n= a - c + c - 2qf\n-\nm\nX\nqj\nand wh\n= a - c - qf\n-\nn\nm\nX\nqj\nBelow, we first derive the market equilibrium for given k, and then explore\nthe optimal k for the multinational.\n4.1 Market equilibrium under exclusivity\nA typical supplier to the multinational solves the following problem:\nMax\nqi\n[wf\n- cI\n+ d]qi\nwhereas a typical supplier to local producers solves:\nMax\nqi\n[wh\n- cI\n]qi\nwhere the demand functions for the intermediate are given by equation (17).\nThe total amount of intermediate supplied to the multinational equals Qf\n=\nP\nk\nqi\nand that supplied to local producers equals Qh\n=\nP\nm\nqi\n.The first\norder conditions for the above problems can be written as\n+\nk\nX\nqz\n) + Qh\nand\n = Qf\n+\nn\n\u00c3\n+\nm\nX\nqz\n!\nLet the equilibrium output of a supplier that caters to the multinational equal\nm\nwhile that of a supplier that caters to local firms equal qEX\nh\n. Thus, the\nabove first order conditions become\n + d + c = 2(k + 1)qEX\nm\n+ (m - k)qEX\nh\nand\n = kqEX\nm\n+\nn\n(m - k + 1) qEX\nh\nThe solution to the above system is\nm\n(k) =\n(m + n - k + 1)  + (n + 1)(m - k + 1)(c + d)\nfor each supplier to the multinational and\nh\n(k) =\nn (k + 2)  - nk(c + d)\nfor each of the other suppliers.\nThe aggregate amount of the intermediate supplied to the multinational\nequals kqEX\nm\n(k), while (by the first order conditions) the prices of the inter-\nmediate paid by the multinational and the local producers are\nf\n(k) = 2qEX\nm\n(k) + cI\n- d and wh\n(k) =\nn\nh\n(k) + cI\nThe equilibrium profit of a typical supplier to the multinational equals\nEX\nm\n(k) = (wEX\nf\n(k) - cI\n+ d)qEX\nm\n\u00a3\nm\n(k)\n\u00a4\nand that for a supplier serving local producers is\nEX\nh\n(k) = (wEX\nh\n(k) - cI\n)qEX\nh\n(k) =\nn\n\u00a3\nh\n(k)\n\u00a4\nThe profit of the multinational equals\nEX\nf\n(k) =\n\u00a3\nkqEX\nm\n(k)\n\u00a4\nwhich increases with k, d and . Finally, the profit of each local producer\nequals\nEX\nj\n(k) =\n\n(m - k)qEX\nh\n(k)\nn\n\u00b8\n4.2 Best response of invited suppliers\nOnce invited, a supplier has two options: either to become an exclusive sup-\nplier for the multinational or to serve home producers only. The trade-off\nbehind this choice is as follows. On the one hand, by serving the multi-\nnational, a supplier captures a share of the multinational's demand for the\nintermediate and also receives vtt from it. On the other hand, it must forego\nthe option of serving local producers. Whether or not it is profitable for a\nsupplier to serve the multinational depends on (i) how many other suppliers\naccept the multinational's offer; (ii) the extent of vtt; and (iii) and the\nmagnitude of the intermediate demand generated by local producers. Specif-\nically, given that k - 1 suppliers accept the multinational's offer, the kth\nsupplier is willing to serve the multinational if and only if\nEX\nm\n(k)  EX\nm\nRemark 2: The profit of a supplier that accepts the multinational's offer\ndecreases with k whereas the profit of a supplier that rejects the multinational's\noffer increases with k.\nThe intuition behind the above result is simple: As more suppliers switch\nto serving the multinational exclusively, competition among them intensifies\nwhereas competition among those that supply local producers declines.\nLet k be the largest integer that satisfies (31). Obviously, such k is unique\nand in general is between 0 and m. If the multinational announces a k that is\nsmaller than (or equal to) k, then all invited suppliers accept its offer because\n(31) holds. If k  k + 1, then (31) is violated at k by the definition of k so\nthat the kth supplier, even if invited, will choose to reject the offer and stay\nas a supplier of home producers. We thus have the following result.\nLemma 1: Given the k announced by the multinational, its equilibrium\nnumber of exclusive suppliers S(k) is as follows:\nS(k) =\n\u00bd\nk, if k  k\nk, if k > k.\n\u00be\nAlthough we cannot obtain an analytical expression for k, it is easy to\nshow that it increases with the degree of vtt (d), as well as the technological\ngap between the multinational and its local rivals (). In fact, as d or  rises,\nfunction EX\nm\n(k) shifts upwards and function EX\nm\n(k - 1) shifts downwards,\nimplying that k goes up. Intuitively, for larger d or , the option of becoming\nan exclusive supplier to the multinational becomes more attractive, leading\na larger number of suppliers to accept the exclusivity offer.\nTo preclude the uninteresting case that all suppliers become the exclusive\nsuppliers of the multinational thereby driving all local producers out of the\nmarket, we make the following assumption which guarantees that k  m-1.\nAssumption 1: EX\nh\n(m - 1) > EX\nm\n(m).\nThe right-hand-side in the above assumption EX\nm\n(m) is the Cournot\nprofit of a supplier when the multinational is the only producer of the final\ngood.9 This assumption says that a supplier prefers to be the sole supplier to\nall local producers than to serve the multinational exclusively (together with\nall other m - 1 suppliers). Assumption 1 requires that (d + c)/ be not too\nbig \u00ad in other words, the technological advantage of the multinational over\nits local rivals and the degree of vtt be not too large relative to the local\nmarket size.\nUsing the expression for EX\nh\n(m - 1), Assumption 1 can be written as\nn\n\nn (m + 1) - n(m - 1)g\n\u00b8\n>\n\n\u00b8\nwhere g  (c + d)/.\nSimilarly, to make exclusivity an attractive option for suppliers, the fol-\nlowing assumption is necessary (it ensures that k  1):\nAssumption 2: EX\nm\nh\n\n(m + n)  + (n + 1)m(d + c)\n\u00b8\n>\n\n(n + 1)  + c\n\u00b8\nThe right-hand-side of the inequality EX\nh\n(0) is the profit of a typical\nsupplier under market interaction (see equation (11)) -- i.e. when no supplier\naccepts the multinational's offer whereas EX\nm\n(1) is the profit of a supplier\nwhen it is the only one serving the multinational. Assumption 2 implies\nthat once the multinational offers (vtt, ex) to certain suppliers, it is not\na Nash equilibrium for all of those suppliers to reject the offer; at least one\nwill choose to accept the offer. Assumption 2 holds, for example, if d is not\ntoo small.\n9Derivation of this profit is straightforward. One way to obtain it is to substitute n = 1\ninto the supplier's profit function in the case of autarky derived in section 2.\nSince EX\nf\n(k) is an increasing function of k, the multinational would an-\nnounce k = k and, by Lemma 1, earn a profit of EX\nf\n(k) under exclusivity.\nLemma 2: Suppose assumptions 1 and 2 hold. Then, the optimal strategy\nfor the multinational, given that it chooses exclusivity, is to set k = k and\nits equilibrium profit equals EX\nf\n5 Equilibrium mode of entry\nRegarding the choice between an exclusive contractual arrangement or mar-\nket interaction, the basic trade-off facing the multinational is as follows.\nFirst, exclusivity prevents the multinational's local rivals from enjoying the\nbenefits of vtt that the multinational undertakes to its suppliers. Second,\nby its very nature, exclusivity limits the number of competing suppliers that\nserve the multinational's local rivals. Both of these advantages raise the\ncosts of the multinational's rivals. The disadvantage of exclusivity is that\nthe multinational is able to attract only k suppliers under exclusivity while\nit buys the intermediate in an open market where all m suppliers compete\nwith one another. One thus naturally expects that either exclusive contract\nor market interaction can be optimal for the multinational firm depending\non parameter values. Clearly, exclusivity occurs in the subgame perfect equi-\nlibrium of the entry game if and only if   EX\nf\n(k) - M\nf\nSince protection of vtt is the primary reason for the choice of exclusive\ncontract by the multinational, exclusivity becomes more attractive the larger\nthe extent of vtt. In fact, because EX\nf\n(k) increases with d and k, and the\nnumber of equilibrium suppliers of the multinational (k) also rises with d, the\n10Strictly speaking, any announcement k by the multinational where k  k would\nconstitute an equilibrium. However, if conveying the extent of vtt to a potential supplier\nincurred even a minute cost (say  > 0 where  is arbitrarily small), the multinational\nwould not approach more than k suppliers.\nprofit differential  increases as d goes up. Noting that M\nf\nis independent of\nd (there is no vtt under market interaction), we have that  > 0 if and only\nif d exceeds a threshold. Assume that there exists d such that |d=d\nProposition 2: The multinational firm opts for an exclusive contract\nif and only if the extent of vtt undertaken by it is sufficiently large (i.e.\nd > d).\nAn important parameter of the model is the magnitude of the multina-\ntional firm's cost advantage in transforming the intermediate good into the\nfinal product (). If  rises, both EX\nf\n(k) and M\nf\ngo up. So in general it is not\nclear whether exclusivity becomes more or less attractive with an increase in\n. For the case with two suppliers considered in the next section, it is shown\nthat exclusivity is less likely to occur for larger .\nHow does exclusivity affects the degree of backward linkages, consumer\nsurplus and local welfare? As mentioned earlier, the multinational's entry\nwith exclusive contract impacts local industry in three ways: (i) it increases\ncompetition downstream and this tends to raise the level of backward linkages\n(and thus consumer surplus); (ii) de-linking reduces the degree of competi-\ntion among suppliers which tends to lower the aggregate output level of the\nintermediate good (as well as consumer surplus); and (iii) local suppliers\nbenefit from vtt, which tends to raise the level of backward linkages. The\nnet effect of the three forces can either be negative or positive -- we explore\nthese three effects in greater detail below for the case of two local suppliers..\nLocal producers are affected in two separate ways by the multinational's\nentry under exclusivity. First, their market shares decline due to increased\ncompetition from a more efficient producer. Second, local producers suffer\n11If such a d does not exist, then  is either always negative or positive and such cases\nare of limited interest.\nalso from the decline in the number of suppliers who serve them. The delink-\ning of k producers changes market structure of the two-tier industry and\nraises the market power of the m - k suppliers who serve local producers.12\nHow do suppliers fare under exclusivity relative to autarky? Since the\nequilibrium number of suppliers serving the multinational (k) cannot be\nsolved for analytically in the general case, we are unable to derive general\nanalytical results regarding the effects on suppliers. However, in the special\ncase of upstream duopoly (considered in the next section), we show that the\nsupplier who serves the multinational is better off and the other supplier\nis worse off relative to autarky. Nevertheless, the average profit of the two\nsuppliers exceeds the profit of a typical supplier under autarky.\n6 Two local suppliers\nTo further explore the choice between the two contracting arrangements, this\nsection considers the case of two local suppliers (i.e. m = 2). First note that,\nif the multinational opts for exclusivity, then under Assumptions 1 and 2 in\nthe previous section the equilibrium number of exclusive suppliers is one (i.e.\nk = 1). From derivations in the previous section, the equilibrium quantities\nfor the two suppliers (where 1 serves the multinational and 2 serves local\nfirms) are:\n=\nand qEX\n=\n3n - n(d + c)\n12To see this, note from (30) that a local producer's profit declines with k. Thus,\nEX\nj\n(k) < EX\nj\n=\n.\nThe right-hand-side of the above equation equals the profit of a local producer under\nautarky.\nThe prices for the intermediate good equal\nf\n+ cI\n- d and wEX\nh\n=\nn\n+ cI\nand the profit of the two suppliers are\nEX\n= (wEX\nf\n- cI\n+ d)qEX\n\u00a3\n\u00a4\nand\nEX\n= (wEX\nh\n- cI\n)qEX\n=\nn\n\u00a3\n\u00a4\nThe multinational's profit is\nEX\nf\n= [a - qEX\n- qEX\n- wEX\nf\n- c]qEX\n=\n\n\u00b8\n.\nStraightforward comparison of intermediate good prices shows the follow-\nf\n< wEX\nh\nRemark 3: Under exclusivity, the multinational pays a lower price for\nthe intermediate good than other local producers if vtt is substantial (i.e. d\nis large) or if its cost advantage over local competitors is not too large (i.e.\n is small).\nObviously, vtt lowers the unit cost of suppliers of multinational and thus\ntends to reduce the intermediate price for the multinational. An increase\nin the cost-advantage of the multinational in transforming the intermediate\nh\n> wA if d + c is not too big.\nThus, the multinational's entry under exclusivity can raise the costs of local producers by\nlowering the number of suppliers who serve local producers. By contrast, when d + c is\nlarge, the market shares of local producers is small and their demand for the intermediate\ngood is low. Under such a scenario, the multinational's entry can actually lower the price\nthey pay for the intermediate relative to autarky.\ngood erodes the market share of a typical local producer, thereby lowering\nits demand for the intermediate good.\nExclusivity occurs in equilibrium if and only if it is more profitable for the\nmultinational firm relative to market interaction: i.e., if and only if EX\nf\nM\nf\n, which in this case is equivalent to\n \n-\nTaking partial derivatives of  with respect  yields the following result.\nLemma 3: Suppose assumptions 1 and 2 hold and m=2. Then, the\nlarger the cost-advantage of the multinational over its local competitors, the\nweaker its incentive to choose an exclusive contract over market interaction\n( \n\nThis result can be understood as follows. If the multinational possesses\na larger cost-advantage () in transforming the intermediate good into the\nfinal product, then it is less worried about protecting its vtt and is more\nconcerned about creating competition among its suppliers. As a result, the\nmultinational is more likely to prefer market interaction.\nTo concentrate on the role of vtt, we next consider the case where the\nmultinational has no direct cost advantage over its local rivals ( = 0).\n6.1 Isolating the role of VTT\nWhen  = 0 condition (40) is equivalent to\nd\n\n\n\n\u00b8\nwhich always holds as long as n  2. If n = 1, then (41) holds if and only if\nProposition 3: Suppose assumptions 1 and 2 hold (so k = 1), m=2,\nand  = 0. Then, the following hold:\n(i) If n  2 then exclusivity always occurs in equilibrium; and\n(ii) If n=1 then exclusivity arises iff the extent of vtt is sufficiently\nIf n = 1, the local industry is a double duopoly after the entry of the\nmultinational. When the extent of vtt is large (d/ > 1/12), the benefit of\npreventing its suppliers from serving its local rival is high so that exclusivity\nis a better choice. By contrast, when vtt is minor the multinational prefers\nmarket interaction so as to enjoy more competition among suppliers. If the\nnumber of rival producers of the multinational exceeds 2, the incentive to\nprevent vtt to leak to its downstream rival firms dominates the incentive\nto create competition among suppliers so that the multinational opts for\nexclusivity.\nWe next focus on the case that exclusivity emerges in equilibrium ( n  2)\nand examine its effects on the local economy.\n6.1.1 Effects of exclusivity on local industry\nAs mentioned for the general case, local producers are certainly worse off\nunder exclusivity relative to autarky because of competition from the multi-\nnational as well as due to reduction of competition among suppliers.\nFor suppliers, Assumption 2 guarantees that supplier 1 is better off rela-\ntive to market interaction and thus is better off relative to autarky as well.\nFor supplier 2, straightforward comparison of EX\nand A\nshows that sup-\nplier 2 is better off under exclusivity if and only if d/ < (2n + 1)/(3n + 3).\nThus, if vtt to supplier 1 is not significant, supplier 2 gains from the multi-\nnational's entry under an exclusive contract with supplier 1. But if vtt is\nsubstantial, then the multinational commands too large a market share, lead-\ning to a sharp decline in the derived demand facing supplier 2. In such a\ncase, supplier 2 is worse off relative to autarky.\nRecall that at the contracting stage of the game where the multinational\nselects suppliers, the equilibrium probability of a supplier being invited to\nbecome an exclusive supplier to the multinational equals k/m (which in the\npresent case equals1/2). Thus, the average profits of a typical supplier in the\ntwo-supplier case equals\nEX\n+ EX\n=\n+\n.\nIt is easy to show that the above average profit is an increasing function of\nd and that \u00b5\nEX\n+ EX\n\u00b6\n> A\n.\nLemma 4: Suppose m=2, n  2, and  = 0. A typical supplier earns\ngreater expected profit under the multinational's entry with exclusivity relative\nto autarky.\nThis result is consistent with both case-study evidence and formal econo-\nmetric investigations of the effects of multinational firms on local suppliers\n6.1.2 Backward linkages and local welfare under exclusivity\nAs under autarky, the degree of backward linkages here can be measured by\naggregate output\n+ qEX\n=\nComparing to autarky, we have that the multinational's entry raises the\ndegree of backward linkages (i.e., BLEX > BLA) if and only if\nd\n\n>\nThat is, for given n, exclusivity increases the level of backward linkages if\nand only if vtt or the cost-advantage of the multinational exceeds a critical\nvalue (Proposition 2). Furthermore, the critical value, GBL\n(n), increases with\nn, so that for lager n, it is less likely that exclusivity will raise the degree of\nbackward linkages in the host industry. The intuition for this is that if n is\nsmall, the increase in the derived demand for the intermediate caused by the\nmultinational's entry is relatively large. As a result, the level of backward\nlinkages rises despite the de-linking effect caused by exclusivity. If n is big,\non the other hand, the market share of the multinational is small after its\nentry. This implies that the extra demand for the intermediate caused by\nsuch entry is small. In fact, it is so small that it cannot offset the negative\neffect on backward linkages generated by exclusivity.\nAggregate local welfare equals\n+ EX\n+ nEX\nj\n+\n[qEX\n+ qEX\nPrior to the entry of the multinational, the level of local welfare (when m = 2)\nis\ni\n+ nA\nj\n+\n\u00a3\nBLA\n\u00a4\nEntry by the multinational enhances local welfare (WEX > WA) if and only\nif\nd\n\n> GW\nwhere g = GW\n(n) is the (positive) solution to WEX = WA.\nFor the special case considered here, Assumption 1, which guarantees\nthat at least one supplier prefers to be the sole supplier of local producers\nthan to serve the multinational exclusively along with the other supplier, is\nequivalent to\nd\n\n(n) \np\np\nand Assumption 2, which guarantees that the supplier is no worse-off serving\nthe multinational exclusively relative to market interaction, becomes\nd\n\n(n) \n\"\n\nr\n#\nFor a supplier to be willing to accept the exclusivity offer, the extent of\nvtt must be large enough. Function G2\n(n) represents the vtt threshold\nfor given n. As noted earlier, a larger n implies a higher opportunity cost of\nserving the foreign exclusively. As a result, G2\n(n) increases with n.\nFigure 1 illustrates the effects of the multinational's entry on backward\nlinkages and local welfare in the (n, d\n\n) space.\n\u00ad Figure 1 here \u00ad\nAssumptions 1 and 2 require that the feasible parameter values lie below\n(n) and above G2\n(n). Within the feasible region, Figure 1 can be divided\ninto four areas labelled as I, II, III, and IV. In region IV, the extent of vtt\nis so large that the multinational's entry raises both the level of backward\nlinkages and local welfare. In region II, however, the multinational's entry\nlowers both the level of backward linkages and local welfare. For the other\ntwo areas, the degree of backward linkages and welfare do not move in the\nsame direction: in region III the multinational's entry raises local welfare\neven as it lowers the degree of backward linkages but, whereas the opposite\nis true in region I.\nThe intuition for why the multinational's entry enhances both backward\nlinkages and local welfare in region IV is simple: If vtt is substantial, the\nmultinational's entry is beneficial to the host country despite the negative\neffects of exclusivity. Likewise, if the extent of vtt is low and local market\nstructure downstream is relatively competitive (i.e. n is big), such as in\nregion II, the negative effect of exclusivity dominates the positive effects of\ndemand creation and vtt, in which case both local welfare and the level of\nbackward linkages decline due to the multinational's entry.\nFor the other two areas (I and III), the multinational's entry increases\neither local welfare or the level of backward linkages (but not both), depend-\ning on the value of n. If n is small and vtt is not very substantial (region\nI), backward linkages increase but welfare declines. This is because when\nn is small, the demand creation effect of the multinational's entry is large\n(as noted in Remark 1) and the resulting increase in the output of the in-\ntermediate good translates into higher consumer surplus as well and greater\nprofits of suppliers. However, for small n, the market is concentrated and the\nerosion of the profits of local firms that results from entry is large and this\nnegative effect on local producers leads to a reduction in local welfare. Area\nIII can be similarly understood: If n is large and vtt is moderate, backward\nlinkages decrease but local welfare increases with entry. The negative effect\non backward linkages stems from the fact that the demand-creation effect of\nentry is weak when n is large. Local welfare increases despite the reduction\nin backward linkages because the benefits of vtt dominate the losses of local\nproducers. The following proposition highlights the possible negative effect\nof exclusivity:\nProposition 4: Suppose assumptions 1 and 2 hold, m = 2, and  = 0.\nThen, there exist parameter values for which the multinational firm chooses\nto enter with an exclusive contract and its entry lowers the level of backward\nlinkages (ranges II and III in Figure 1).\n7 Conclusion\nThe model developed in this paper differs from existing literature on back-\nward linkages in two main respects. First, while existing literature focuses\non the demand-creating effects of the entry of multinational firms on local\nindustry (e.g. Markusen and Venables, 1999), we focus on the supply-side\neffects of such entry. In particular, vtt and the possibility of exclusive con-\ntract between the multinational and its local suppliers are two key ingredients\nof our model. Existing literature has given us important insights regarding\nthe scenario where multinationals purchase required intermediates via the\nmarket. However, such research, by design cannot shed light on issues that\nsurface once the contractual options available to the multinational are con-\nsidered. For example, an important insight of our model is that while vtt is\nbeneficial for the local economy, it comes at an implicit price when accompa-\nnied with exclusivity: under such a contractual arrangement the recipients\nof vtt are no longer able to supply local producers they supplied prior to\nthe entry of the multinational.\nOur second point of departure from existing literature is that our model\nconsiders oligopolistic competition at both the upstream and downstream\nstages of production. Such a setting enables us to examine how the contrac-\ntual relationship between the multinational and its suppliers affects strategic\ninteraction in the local industry. For example, in addition to the competition\neffect identified in Markusen and Venables (1999), entry by the multinational\ninto the final good market also hurts its local rivals through a delinking effect:\nWhen exclusivity arises in equilibrium, local producers lose some of their old\nsuppliers to the multinational. Put differently, while the entry of the multi-\nnational does create additional demand for the intermediate good, it may\nalso reduce the number of suppliers available to its local rivals. This nega-\ntive supply side effect can dominate the positive demand side effects so that\nthe total output of the intermediate good (as well as the final good) shrinks\ndue to the multinational's entry. Our model identifies delinking as another\nchannel, in addition to importing of intermediate goods as recognized in the\nliterature, via which foreign direct investment may lower industrial linkages\nin the host country. However, it is worth noting that the entry of the multi-\nnational even under exclusivity increases aggregate local welfare (and the\ndegree of backward linkages) so long as the degree of vtt is not too small .\nThe model focuses on the entry decision of a single multinational and does\nnot consider competition amongst multinationals. Further research is needed\nto determine how strategic competition amongst multinationals affects their\nincentives to impose exclusivity conditions on their local suppliers.\nReferences\n[1] Aitken, Brian, and Ann E.
