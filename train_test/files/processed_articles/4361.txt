It may be\nphysical (e.g., a punch) or verbal (e.g., an insult), but in both cases the target is able to\nidentify the aggressor and retaliate immediately. The possibility of immediate retaliation is\nwhat makes direct aggression distinct from indirect aggression, which is delivered via\ncircuitous means and hence conceals the identity of the aggressor (Archer and Coyne,\nSex differences in the use of direct aggression appear in the first two years of life\nand persist through childhood and adolescence (Card, Stucky, Sawalani, and Little, 2008),\nalthough there is always some overlap between male and female distributions. As adults,\nmen use more direct aggression than women in laboratory settings (Bettencourt and Miller,\n1996), as well as in real life settings \u00ad whether measured by self report (Archer, 2004) or\nby frequencies of arrest for violent crime (Roe, Coleman, and Kaiza, 2009). The sex\nSame-sex aggression, sociosexuality, and risky impulsivity\ndifference in direct aggression is consistent across cultures (Archer, 2009; Campbell, 1999)\nand time periods (Daly and Wilson, 1988). In contrast, indirect aggression does not show\nconsistent sex differences in adults (Archer, 2004). Because this article is concerned with\nsex differences, the focus will be on direct as opposed to indirect aggression (and the term\naggression will refer to direct aggression). This article also focuses on same-sex, as\nopposed to opposite-sex, aggression. Aggression towards opposite-sex targets does not\nshow a robust sex difference in the male direction (Archer, 2004; Cross, Tee, and\nCampbell, in press), and evolutionary accounts of sex differences in aggression have\nfocused on the role sex-specific selection pressures on same-sex aggression (Campbell,\nSex differences in same-sex aggression: Evolutionary accounts\nDaly and Wilson (1988) explained men's high levels of same-sex aggression as\nfollows. Social status and access to sexual partners are a crucial limiting factor in men's,\nbut not women's, reproductive success \u00ad the number of offspring who survive to maturity\nto reproduce themselves. Furthermore, there is greater variance in reproductive success for\nmen than for women (see Brown, Laland, and Mulder, 2009, for a review), with men being\nmore likely than women to fail to reproduce at all. Although for men who engage in\naggression there is a chance of being injured or killed, men who fail to secure a mate face\nreproductive death regardless of how long they themselves stay alive. This threat of\nreproductive death is sufficiently dire to make risky, aggressive competition adaptive even\nwhen potential costs are high (see Wang, 2002). Although Daly and Wilson's (1988)\nanalysis is outlined here in terms of the costs of failing to compete, this argument is often\ndiscussed in terms of men's rewards for competing successfully (e.g., \"Bigger prizes\nIn a contrasting analysis, Campbell (1999) argued that the low level of same-sex\naggression found in women is not merely the result of an absence of the adaptation for\naggression found in men; it is itself an adaptive trait which serves the function of\nsafeguarding physical integrity. Although women stand to gain little from competing for\nnumbers of mates, they have much to compete for in terms of securing the best quality\nmates or sequestering food resources for provisioning their offspring. Women's levels of\nsame-sex aggression, although always lower than men's, are sensitive to resource shortage\nin the same way (Campbell, Muncer, and Bibel, 2001). Low levels of aggression between\nwomen are therefore not the result of an absence of female-female competition. However,\nthere is a stronger selection pressure on women than on men to avoid physical injury\nbecause infants are considerably more dependent on mothers than on fathers. The\ndetrimental effect of maternal death on infant survival is much stronger and more\nconsistent than the effect of paternal death (Sear and Mace, 2008). Consequently, women's\nphysical integrity is more tightly bound to their reproductive success as a whole than\nmen's, and the resulting selection pressures drive down women's engagement in\naggression.\nSex differences in sociosexuality\nSex differences in sociosexuality, like sex differences in aggression, are marked and\nSame-sex aggression, sociosexuality, and risky impulsivity\nrobust across cultures (Schmitt, 2005). Sociosexuality measures a tendency to change\nsexual partners frequently, to desire large numbers of sexual partners, and to require little\nor no emotional intimacy in order to have sex (Simpson and Gangestad, 1991). Men in\nevery region of the world desire a greater number of sexual partners than women do and are\nmore likely to report actively seeking short-term sexual partners (Schmitt, 2003). Men\nreport a greater interest in casual sex than women do (Oliver and Hyde, 1993; Petersen and\nHyde, 2010), require less time than women do before consenting to sex with a new partner\n(Schmitt, Shackelford, and Buss, 2001) and, after one-night stands, experience fewer\nSociosexuality, like aggression, is a form of behavior for which the cost-benefit\ntrade-off differs for men and women. (see, e.g., Mulder and Rauch, 2009; Penn and Smith,\n2007). Women bear greater metabolic costs following a successful conception than men do,\nand their ability to make other, potentially better, investments in offspring is limited for\nmuch longer. This makes the consequences of a poor choice of partner more severe for\nwomen than for men (Bjorklund and Kipp, 1996; Trivers, 1972). Men have more to gain\nthen women from mating with additional partners (Jokela, Rotkirch, Rickard, Pettay, and\nLummaac, 2010), and women suffer reputational costs from unrestricted sexual activity\nwhich men do not (Jonason, 2007). Sexually transmitted infections pass more easily from\nmen to women than from women to men (Devincenzi et al., 1992). Furthermore, women\nare approximately ten times more likely than men to be raped or sexually assaulted (Roe et\nal., 2009), and an increased number of sexual partners increases the risk that at least one\npartner will be sexually aggressive (Franklin, 2010). Again, this suggests that the optimally\nadaptive level of engagement in sexual activity is higher for men than for women.\nA common proximate mechanism?\nSame-sex aggression and sociosexuality, therefore, both show robust and marked\nsex differences which are argued to be the result of differing selection pressures on men\nand women. For both forms of behavior, the optimal level of involvement is higher for men\nthan for women. I therefore postulate that a single proximate psychological mechanism\nmight underlie the sex difference in both same-sex aggression and sociosexuality, and that\nrisky impulsivity is a promising candidate for such a mechanism. The risky impulsivity\nscale was developed specifically to measure risk-taking which occurs without prior thought\n(Campbell and Muncer, 2009). In the following paragraphs I outline the conceptual links\nbetween risky impulsivity and the proximate mechanisms postulated by previous\nevolutionary accounts of the sex difference in aggression.\nWilson and Daly (1985) argue that a male \"taste for risk\" explains men's greater\nuse of same-sex aggression and there is considerable evidence that men engage in risky\npursuits more than women. Men are more likely to take part in extreme sports, for example\n(Murray, 2003), and this form of risk-taking involves careful planning to minimize the\nchances of accident. However, men are also overrepresented in illegal drug use\n(Degenhardt et al., 2008), dangerous driving convictions (Corbett, 2007), and deaths from\nnon-vehicle accidents (Pampel, 2001), which implies that men are also more likely than\nwomen to take risks without adequate consideration of the consequences. This suggests\nthat a measure of risk-taking which occurs without forethought might be instructive in\nSame-sex aggression, sociosexuality, and risky impulsivity\ndeveloping an account of sex differences in aggression and sociosexuality.\nCampbell (1999) argued that women's higher levels of fear was important in\nexplaining sex differences in aggression, and later outlined a model in which early sex\ndifferences in levels of fear lead to later sex differences in impulsivity, which then mediates\nthe sex difference in aggression (Campbell, 2006; see also Str\u00fcber, Luck, and Roth, 2008).\nGirls are more likely than boys to have high levels of fearfulness in childhood (Cot\u00e9,\nTremblay, Nagin, Zoccolillo, and Vitaro, 2002), and more fearful children develop more\neffective control of their impulses (Kochanska and Knaack, 2003). Impulsivity, therefore,\nis a construct which is conceptually related to both Wilson and Daly's (1985) and\nCampbell's (1999) proposed mechanisms for the sex difference in aggression. Furthermore,\nimpulsivity is correlated with involvement in aggressive behavior (Henry, Caspi, Moffitt,\nand Silva, 1996; Vigil-Colet, Morales-Vives, and Tous, 2008) and sexual risk-taking\n(Hoyle, Fejfar, and Miller, 2000). Risky impulsivity is correlated with aggression\n(Campbell and Muncer, 2009) and data are suggestive of a correlation with sociosexuality\n(Boothroyd, Cross, Gray, Coombes, and Gregson-Curtis, 2011).\nThe present study\nThe chief aim of the present study is to test risky impulsivity as a possible common\nmechanism for same-sex aggression and sociosexuality. A secondary aim of the present\nstudy was to test the factor structure of risky impulsivity in male and female subsamples\nseparately. The most widely used psychometric measure of impulsivity (Barratt\nImpulsiveness Scale; Patton, Stanford, and Barratt, 1995) has a factor structure which\ndiffers in male and female subsamples (Ireland and Archer, 2008). This is a problem for\nany scale being used to investigate sex differences, as any quantitative difference in scores\nbetween the sexes is confounded with qualitative difference in the structure of the trait.\nFinally, sex differences in variability in same-sex aggression, risky impulsivity, and SOI\nwere examined. Archer and Mehdikhani (2003) argue that sexual selection produces greater\nvariance in men than in women for sexually selected traits, including aggression. If risky\nimpulsivity and SOI are part of the same sexually selected adaptive complex, then we\nmight expect to see greater male than female variance in risky impulsivity and SOI as well\nas aggression.\nIt was hypothesized that risky impulsivity would emerge as a common cause of\nboth same-sex aggression and sociosexuality. Furthermore, it was hypothesized that risky\nimpulsivity would mediate the sex differences in same-sex aggression and sociosexuality.\nFinally, it was hypothesized that same-sex aggression, SOI, and risky impulsivity would\nhave larger variances in men than in women.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\n(mean age = 32.5, SD = 9.3 years), who completed a questionnaire posted on a university\nwebsite. Ninety-three per cent of the sample classed themselves as European, 2% North\nAmerican, 2% British, and 3% other.\nSame-sex aggression, sociosexuality, and risky impulsivity\nMeasures\nRisky impulsivity scale. The 12 items in this scale were derived from exploratory\nand confirmatory factor analyses of an item pool generated by focus groups (Campbell and\nMuncer, 2009), and are designed to measure the tendency to behave in potentially\ndangerous ways without prior thought. Example items are \"Have another drink even though\nI am already drunk,\" and \"Drive too fast when I am feeling upset.\" Because the main\npurpose of this instrument was to assess tolerance of general risk rather than aggression,\nnone of the items refer to aggressive acts. Campbell and Muncer (2009) report a\nCronbach's alpha of .81 for this scale. Participants were asked \"Based on your previous\nexperiences, how likely would you be to do each of these things on impulse?\" and indicated\ntheir answer using a Likert scale from 1 (very unlikely to do this) to 5 (very likely to do\nthis). The Likert scores for each item were summed to form a scale total.\nSociosexual Orientation Inventory. This 7-item scale was developed by Simpson\nand Gangestad (1991) and measures an unrestricted attitude towards sexual behavior. The\nfirst three items are free-response self-report items (e.g., \"With how many people have you\nhad sex in the last 12 months?\"). Because these items can cause scores on the whole scale\nto be highly skewed, these were recoded onto a 9-point Likert scale, following Penke and\nAsendorpf (2008). The SOI also has three attitudinal items (e.g., \"Sex without love is OK\")\nwhere participants indicate strength of agreement on a 9-point Likert scale, and an item\nassessing frequency of sexual desire, which is scored on an 8-point Likert scale. Simpson\nand Gangestad report a Cronbach's alpha of .73. High SOI scores are associated with\nhaving sex early in a relationship, and having sexual relationships with more than one\npartner at a time.\nSelf-reported same-sex direct aggression. Archer and Webb (2006) compiled a 16-\nitem list of acts of direct aggression from items used in other studies of aggressive behavior\nitems (e.g., \"screamed at someone\") and 12 physical items (e.g., \"grabbed someone\").\nArcher and Webb (2006) reported a Cronbach's alpha of .84 for this scale. In the present\nstudy, participants indicated how many times in the last 12 months they had used each of\nthe 16 acts towards someone of their own sex by choosing one of five categories, ranging\nfrom \"never\" to \"more than 10 times.\"\nResults\nPsychometrics and sex differences\np < .001, the mean difference being 2.1 years. Age is therefore controlled in the following\nanalyses of sex differences.\nSociosexuality. Means and standard deviations for all variables can be found in\nTable 1. Cronbach's Alpha for the SOI was .79, which is comparable to the value found in\nSimpson and Gangestad's (1991) original article. As anticipated, men scored significantly\nhigher than women on the SOI (See Table 1). The variance ratio was significantly larger\nthan 1, indicating greater male variability.\nSelf-reported aggression. Cronbach's alpha was .89 for same-sex aggression, which\nSame-sex aggression, sociosexuality, and risky impulsivity\nis comparable to the value given by Archer and Webb (2006). Table 1 shows that, as\nhypothesized, men scored significantly higher than women. The variance ratio was\nsignificantly larger than 1, indicating greater male variability.\nRisky impulsivity. Cronbach's alpha for the 12-item risky impulsivity scale was\nacceptable at .76, which is similar to the value given by Campbell and Muncer (2009).\nMen scored significantly higher than women on risky impulsivity (see Table 1), but the\nvariance ratio was not significantly different from 1, indicating no sex difference in\nvariability.\nTable 1. Means and standard deviations for all variables\nVariable Male mean\n(SD)\nFemale mean\n(SD)\nratiob\nNote: The effect of age is controlled in analyses of sex differences. a d = a measure of effect size given by\n(male mean \u00ad female mean) / pooled SD. b Variance ratio = male variance divided by female variance. Values\nsignificantly larger than 1 indicate significantly larger male variance. **p < .01; ***p < .001\nConfirmatory factor analysis was used to test the factor structure of the risky\nimpulsivity scale. The model evaluated by Campbell and Muncer (2009) was tested using\nAMOS 7. This model had three intercorrelated factors: injury risk, criminal risk, and health\nrisk. The estimation method used was maximum likelihood. The factor structure was\nconfirmed on the male data and female data separately. The fit statistics were more than\n= .92, for females. Inspection of modification indices revealed no alterations that would\nimprove the fit for either males or females. This indicates that risky impulsivity is a trait\nthat manifests itself in the same way for both sexes. The factor loading and mean scores for\neach item on the risky impulsivity scale can be found in Table 2.\nSame-sex aggression, sociosexuality, and risky impulsivity\nTable 2.

Risky impulsivity was significantly correlated with same-sex\naggression and sociosexuality for both men and women (see Table 3). Aggression and\nsociosexuality were also significantly correlated for both sexes. Risky impulsivity was\nsignificantly more strongly related to male-male aggression, r = .40, than to female-female\nSame-sex aggression, sociosexuality, and risky impulsivity\nTable 3.

All correlations are\nPath analysis. In order to test the hypothesis that risky impulsivity drives both\nsociosexual and aggressive behaviour, three competing path models were tested. In Model\n1, risky impulsivity was a common cause of both sociosexuality and same-sex aggression\n(see Figure 1a). In model 2, SOI was tested as a common cause of risky impulsivity and\nsame-sex aggression. In model 3, same-sex aggression was evaluated as a common cause\nof risky impulsivity and SOI. It was hypothesised that only model 1 would show a good fit\nto the data. This model fit the data well for both the male (2/df = 2.83, RMSEA = .00, 90%\n.55], TLI = -1.24, CFI = 0.26). This further supports the argument that risky impulsivity is\na common cause of direct same-sex aggression and sociosexuality.\nIn order to test the hypothesis that risky impulsivity accounts for the sex differences\nin same-sex aggression and sociosexuality, sex was incorporated into the path model (see\nFigure 1b). Although there were statistically significant indirect effects of sex on\nsociosexuality and same-sex aggression, this model did not fit the data well, 2/df = 142.13,\neffects of sex on sociosexuality and same-sex aggression improved the model fit\nchange (2) = 424.7, p < .001. This suggests that risky impulsivity accounts for some of the\nbetween-sex variance in same-sex aggression and sociosexuality, but is not enough to\nexplain it completely.\nSame-sex aggression, sociosexuality, and risky impulsivity\nFigure 1. Relationships between: a) risky impulsivity, same-sex aggression and\nsociosexuality, and b) sex, risky impulsivity, same-sex aggression and sociosexuality\nNote: Dashed lines indicate paths that were not originally specified but which were indicated by modification\nindices. See main text for model fit statistics.\nDiscussion\nThe present study sought to evaluate the hypothesis that same-sex aggression and\nsociosexuality share a common proximate psychological mechanism, namely risky\nimpulsivity, which might also explain sex differences in both of these variables. The\nprincipal finding of the current study is that risky impulsivity appears to be a common\ncause of both same-sex aggression and sociosexuality. This implies that the reason these\ntwo variables are related is because they share an element of risk, and that risky impulsivity\nrepresents a single mechanism which underlies individual differences in behavior in two\ndistinct domains. Furthermore, this relationship holds in both sexes, indicating that within-\nsex differences in risky behavior are mediated by the same mechanisms in men and\nwomen.\nIn terms of evolutionary accounts of same-sex aggression and sociosexuality, the\npresent results suggest that high levels of impulsivity might have been selected in men\nbecause they served two adaptive functions at the same time: promoting competition with\nother males and pursuing mating opportunities. Conversely, low levels of impulsivity might\nhave been adaptive in women not only because they inhibited dangerous intrasexual\ncompetition but because they resulted in more cautious and restricted sexual behavior.\nImpulsivity was therefore subject to two different forms of sex-specific selection pressure.\nSex differences in same-sex aggression and sociosexuality might have evolved\nconcurrently, with impulsivity as a common substrate. A single common mechanism\nrepresenting a tolerance for impulsive risks would be a more parsimonious account of\nindividual differences in same-sex aggression and sociosexuality \u00ad and the correlation\nSame-sex aggression, sociosexuality, and risky impulsivity\nbetween them \u00ad than two separate mechanisms governing aggressive and sociosexual\nbehavior.\nThe results suggest that risky impulsivity is a measure well suited to investigating\nsex differences in risky behavior: There is a significant sex difference in risky impulsivity,\nand it has a factor structure that is invariant across the sexes. Risky impulsivity, however,\ndid not fully account for the sex differences in same-sex aggression or sociosexuality,\ndespite the evidence that it accounts for significant within-sex variation. The sex difference\nin risky impulsivity, although significant, is smaller than the sex differences in same-sex\naggression and sociosexuality and may therefore not be large enough to account for them.\nIt is possible that risky impulsivity, although a valid measure of individual differences in\nimpulsive risk-taking, is sensitive enough to detect the sex difference but not sensitive\nenough to reflect its magnitude. Risky impulsivity measures the tendency to take risks that\narise commonly in everyday life. Including activities which are slightly more dangerous\nmight produce more substantial sex differences. However, care would need to be taken not\nto compromise the applicability of the scale to community and student samples who might\nnot have experience of extreme forms of risk-taking.\nThere was greater male than female variance on same-sex aggression, which is\nconcordant with Archer and Mehdikhani's (2003) argument that men are more free to vary\nin their parental investment strategies than women. SOI also showed greater male than\nfemale variance, which is consistent with the argument that same-sex aggression and SOI\nmight form part of a single adaptive complex. There was no evidence, however, of greater\nvariability among men than women in risky impulsivity. At first blush, this appears\ninconsistent with the argument that the sex difference in risky impulsivity is the result of\nsexual selection, despite the strong relationships between risky impulsivity, same-sex\naggression, and SOI. However, the absence of items relating to extremely risky activities\non the risky impulsivity scale might account for the absence of greater male variance, as\nwell as the lack of complete mediation of the sex difference in same-sex aggression.\nTwo further factors to consider in explaining the sex difference in same-sex\naggression are qualitative differences between male and female same-sex aggression, and\nthe possibility that a mean difference between the sexes has a synergistic effect when\nlooking at male-male compared to female-female dyadic interactions. First, men's conflicts\nare characterized by a need to preserve face in response to a slight or a threat to status\n(Felson, 1982). The costs of `backing down' are greater for men than for women (Wilson\nand Daly, 1985). Men are more likely than women to use explosive forms of anger\nexpression such as angry shouting or hitting inanimate objects (an effect which is partially\nmediated by risky impulsivity; Campbell and Muncer, 2008). This form of anger\nexpression might be perceived as threatening, in turn provoking a counter-threatening\nresponse and an upward spiral of aggression. In contrast, women's conflicts are more likely\nto be characterized by the use of defusing forms of anger expression such as withdrawing\nor crying (Campbell and Muncer, 2008), which are less likely to be perceived as\nthreatening or provoking and make escalation less likely.\nSecond, research on the escalation of aggressive behavior in laboratory settings\nindicates that when individuals with high trait aggressiveness interact, the trait\naggressiveness levels of both individuals have additive effects on aggressive escalation\nSame-sex aggression, sociosexuality, and risky impulsivity\n(Anderson, Buckley, and Carnagey, 2008). A relatively small mean difference between\nmen and women in risky impulsivity might therefore have large effects when same-sex\ndyads are considered. This might explain why risky impulsivity is a stronger correlate of\nsame-sex aggression in men than in women. If interactions between men are characterized\nby greater provocation and have a greater tendency towards escalation than interactions\nbetween women, then individual differences in risky impulsivity have greater latitude to\naffect the behavioral outcome in the former. All of this suggests that an interactionist\napproach to explaining sex differences in aggression is appropriate. An individual's sex\nmight be a factor in determining their level of tolerance for risk, but it also affects\nqualitatively the antagonistic encounters in which they are likely to become involved.\nThere were, of course, some limitations of the present study. Firstly, limiting the\nscope of inquiry to same-sex aggression means that the role of impulsivity in aggression\ntowards opposite-sex targets could not be addressed. Aggression towards opposite-sex\npartners has been shown to relate less strongly than aggression towards same-sex targets to\nimpulsivity. Future work could examine the role of risky impulsivity in partner aggression\nmore closely, particularly in same-sex partnerships which are under-researched. Secondly,\nthe present article cannot address the role of impulsivity in indirect aggression. It was\ndecided to focus on direct aggression because it carries a risk of immediate retaliation, and\nsex differences are evident. Impulsivity might be less relevant to indirect aggression in\nwhich the aggressor has to maintain sufficient self-control to refrain from direct\nconfrontation and deliver his or her aggressive acts circuitously. Thirdly, because risky\nimpulsivity did not completely account for the sex differences in same-sex aggression and\nsociosexuality, consideration must be given to other possible mechanisms and how they\nmight interact with risky impulsivity.\nTo conclude, the present study indicates that same-sex aggression and\nsociosexuality are correlated because of their shared element of risk, and that sex\ndifferences in both behaviors might be the result of sex-specific selection pressures acting\non a general tendency to tolerate risk. While risky impulsivity can account for individual\ndifferences in both of these behaviors, a more sensitive measure might be needed to reflect\nthe true extent of sex differences in impulsive risk-taking. Individual differences in\nimpulsivity also need to be considered in concert with variables at the dyadic level in order\nto give a complete account of sex differences in same-sex aggression.\n"
