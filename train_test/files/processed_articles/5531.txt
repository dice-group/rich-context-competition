Endoscopic treatment is first recom-\nmended due to its minimal invasiveness and low\nburden to patients.4 In contrast to the high tech-\nnical and functional success rate of the first stent\nimplantation, the endoscopic management of\nSEMS complications represents a real challenge\neven for experienced gastroenterologists.\nThe aims of our retrospective study were to eval-\nuate the complications rate of SEMS implanta-\ntions and to identify their predicting factors which\ncould help in the screening of high-risk patients.\nWe determined the frequency and efficacy of\nrepeated endoscopic interventions for the treat-\nment of SEMS complications. We provide tech-\nnical recommendations on appropriate stent\nselection based on the results of a correlation\nanalysis between the stent features and the type of\ncomplications.\nPatients, material and methods\nA total of 212 patients with malignant esophageal\nobstruction or TEF who underwent SEMS\nthe Hungarian tertiary level referral gastroenter-\nology centers were retrospectively enrolled in our\nstudy. The inclusion criteria were malignant\nesophageal obstruction or TEF confirmed by\nendoscopy or barium swallow/meal examination;\npathologically diagnosed esophageal malignancy;\nunresectable tumor with advanced stage or poor\nsurgical candidates; onco team recommended\noncological treatment or palliative esophageal\nSEMS implantation. The study was approved by\nthe Regional and Institutional Human Medical\nBiological Research Ethics Committee of the\nUniversity of Szeged (ethics approval number:\n3680 SZTE). Informed consent for this study was\nwaived by the ethics committee owing to the ret-\nrospective nature of the investigation. The study\nwas carried out under the Declaration of Helsinki.\nStent implantations were performed under intra-\nvenous sedation (5\u00ad10 mg midazolam) with or\nwithout intravenous analgesics (10\u00ad20 mg nal-\nbuphine). Various types of esophageal stents were\nused from the following manufacturers: Leufen\nMedical GmbH (Berlin, Germany); Boston\nScientific Corporation (Minneapolis, Minnesota,\nUSA); Taewoong Medical Co. Ltd, (Seoul,\nSouth Korea); Changzhou Health Microport\nMedical Device Co. Ltd (Changzhou, Jiangsu,\nChina); Endo-Technik (Solingen, Germany);\nENDO-FLEX GmbH (Voerde, Germany);\nAccura Medizintechnik GmbH (Karben,\nGermany); BVM Medical Ltd (Trinity Lane,\nLeicestershire, UK); Micro-Tech Co. Ltd\n(Nanjing, China). The diameter of the body of\nthe applied stents was 18 or 20 mm, and the stent\nmaterial and its coating were identical in products\nmade by the same manufacturers (polytetrafluor-\noethylene, silicone, polyurethane, etc.; nitinol,\nsteel, etc.). The pattern (weave, braided, knits,\netc.) and shape of stents varied widely depending\non the altered anatomical situations. The selec-\ntion of the optimal stent depends on the disease\nlocation and the length of obstruction. In the case\nof tumors of the upper third of the esophagus and\nthe cardia, specific SEMS were inserted (cardia\numbrella stent, antireflux valve, antimigration\nproperty, etc.) which could reduce the risk of for-\neign body sensation in the pharynx and the sever-\nity of gastroesophageal reflux. The choice between\npartially and fully covered stents was individual-\nized, depending on the risk of restenosis and\nmigration: fully covered SEMS was preferred in\nthe case of a long and significant stenosis, in con-\ntrast to partially covered stents, which were\napplied in cases with higher migration risk. The\nstent was at least 2 cm longer than the endoscopi-\ncally measured length of stenosis. The proximal\nand distal ends of the neoplasia were marked with\nexternal metal markers. If the stenosis was too\ntight to allow the passage of the stent delivery sys-\ntem and the endoscopic visualization of the distal\npart of the esophagus, endoscopic balloon or bou-\ngie dilation was performed first. After the removal\nof the endoscope, the stent was inserted into the\nright position with guidewire assistance under\nX-ray control, and finally the proper SEMS posi-\ntion was verified endoscopically (Figure 1).\nOur study had three different aims: to evaluate\nthe success and complication rate of esophageal\nstent implantation; to determine the frequency\nand efficacy of repeated endoscopic interventions\nrelated to SEMS complications; to propose\ntechnical recommendations for optimized stent\nselection based on the results of our study. The\nefficacy of SEMS implantation was characterized\nby technical and functional success rate. The\nintervention was considered technically success-\nful if the stent was opened correctly in the proper\nposition confirmed by X-ray and endoscopy, and\nfunctionally successful if the oral feeding of the\npatients became possible 24 h after the interven-\ntion. Minor complications were defined as mild\nR Bor, A F\u00e1bi\u00e1n et al.\njournals.sagepub.com/home/tag 601\nto moderate events related to stent implantation\nwhich could be treated conservatively without\nthe need for hospitalization (gastroesophageal\nreflux, emesis, retrosternal pain, mild dysphagia,\netc.). All patients received opiate pain killers\nand in the case of distal obstruction prophylacti-\ncally proton pump inhibitor therapy with or\nwithout prokinetic drugs to avoid the reflux.\nMajor complications were defined as severe,\noften life-threatening complications, which\nrequired repeated hospitalization and endoscopic\ninterventions (TEF, stent migration or obstruc-\ntion, aspiration pneumonia, arrhythmia, hemate-\nmesis, etc.). We determined the rate, type,\nfrequency and efficacy of repeated endoscopic\nexaminations; furthermore, we analyzed the\ncharacteristics of patients, the SEMS types and\nthe SEMS implantations to identify the risk fac-\ntors and success of reinterventions.\nStatistical analysis was performed using SPSS\nsoftware version 22 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,\nUSA). Descriptive statistics were expressed as\nmean and median with ranges. We used logistic\nregression analysis, Fisher's exact test and 2 test\nto identify the factors that can modify the risk of\nSEMS complications.\nResults\nSEMS implantation\ntions were performed due to malignant esopha-\ngeal obstructions caused by predominantly\nprimer esophageal tumors (83.49%) or lung can-\nthe time of SEMS implantation. The characteris-\ntics of patients and stent implantations are\nsummarized in Tables 1 and 2. The technical\nsuccess rate of the first SEMS implantations was\n99.06%. In two cases the cardia stent spontane-\nously migrated into the stomach immediately\nafter the implantation, and the reposition was not\nfeasible. In one case intolerable retrosternal pain\nand severe dyspnea and in three cases develop-\nment of severe complications (arrhythmia, pneu-\nmonia) hampered the oral feeding of patients,\ntherefore the functional success rate decreased to\ntwo patients died due to malignant supraven-\ntricular arrhythmia and aspiration pneumonia\nless than 24 h after stent implantation.\nSEMS complications\nIn total, major and minor complications were\nRetrosternal pain (13.68%) and stent migration\n(6.57%) were the most frequent early complica-\ntions, and they appeared less than 4 weeks after\nFigure 1.

Fatal complications were\nseen in three cases. One patient died 24 h after\nstent implantation due to aspiration pneumonia,\nrespiratory insufficiency and septic shock. In two\ncases malignant supraventricular tachycardia\noccurred with cardiovascular instability immedi-\nately after stenting. These patients died despite\ntheir admission to the intensive care unit and the\nremoval of the stent. After the 4-week follow up,\nstent obstruction caused by tumor overgrowth or\nTEF formation (7.08%) were the most common\ncomplications. No correlation was found between\nclinical/procedural factors (sex, age, tumor type,\nlocation, necessity of dilation during stenting,\ncoverage of SEMS, and presence of TEF at the\ntime of stenting) and the development of compli-\ncations (Table 4).\nRepeated endoscopic interventions\nventions were performed, the indications of which\nare shown in Figure 2. In 16 patients the first\nreintervention was performed 24\u00ad48 h after stent\nimplantation; this was necessary due to early stent\nmigration (12 cases), supraventricular arrhythmia\n(2 cases), dyspnea (1 case) and intolerable retros-\nternal pain (1 case). In this group, multiple endos-\ncopies were required in every second patient\nduring the follow up. In the case of patients with\nan uncomplicated early postimplantation period\nmedian 2) were performed per patient at an aver-\nafter stenting. The type and frequency of endo-\nscopic interventions are presented on Figure 3.\nStent reimplantation occurred in 23 cases: 21\npatients received two, 1 patient had three and 1\npatient had four SEMSs due to stent migration (7\ncases), occlusion (10 cases) or new TEF forma-\ntion (8 cases) (Figure 4). Endoscopic removal of\nthe stent due to complications (arrhythmia, ret-\nrosternal pain, migration) was unavoidable in\nfeeding was resolved by an endoscopic procedure;\nin six cases transient parenteral or permanent\nenteral feeding with a gastric tube or percutane-\nous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) was feasible.\nTable 2.

Additionally, our results revealed\nthat the majority of SEMS complications could\nbe successfully managed by endoscopic interven-\ntions (stent reimplantation, dilation of stenosis,\nstent reposition).\nThe role of SEMS placement in the palliative\ntreatment of malignant esophageal stenosis is\nunquestionable because it provides immediate\nand potentially long-lasting relief of obstructive\nsymptoms.5,6 SEMS placement is superior to the\nremaining endoscopic procedures such as self-\nexpandable plastic stent (SEPS) placement, dila-\ntion alone or argon plasma coagulation (APC),\nbecause it provides a more durable asymptomatic\nperiod and is associated with decreased risk of\ncomplications.7\u00ad9 However, previous studies have\nshown that the rate of SEMS-related adverse\nevents is high, and varies between 22% and 50%\ndepending on the location of the tumor, the pres-\nence of a fistula or tumor shelf, concomitant\nchemoirradiation, tumor vascularity and the stent\ndesign.7 Stenting of upper esophageal tumors\nrepresents a real therapeutic challenge due to\nTable 4.

Indication of repeated endoscopic\ninterventions.\nFigure 3. Repeated endoscopic interventions after\nTherapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 10(8)\n604 journals.sagepub.com/home/tag\npain and globus sensation, an elevated risk of\nTEF and aspiration pneumonia.10 In this location\nthe use of a specially designed stent is recom-\nmended, the proximal end of which keeps a 2 cm\ndistance from the upper esophageal sphincter\nafter stenting. A retrospective study analyzed the\nclinical data of 104 patients with malignant proxi-\nmal esophageal stenosis and concluded that\nSEMS placement is safe and effective, and the\ncomplication rate is not elevated compared with\nstenting in the distal esophagus.11 The use of\nnewly designed esophageal stents could reduce\ncertain types of complications such as SEMS with\nantireflux valve or antimigration property, and\ncardia umbrella stents.12 The results of previous\nstudies have shown better long-term efficacy in\nthe case of partially or fully covered stent place-\nment compared with uncovered stent place-\ndesigned stents could help to prevent the devel-\nopment of short- and long-term adverse events.\nIn our study, fully covered SEMS were applied\nmost frequently (partially covered 16.39% versus\nfully covered 83.11%), and in every cardia or\nproximal esophageal tumor specially designed\nstents were inserted. We have noted complica-\nrelation with tumor type, location, necessity of\ndilation during stenting, coverage of SEMS and\nthe presence of TEF at the time of stenting. The\ndifference between the risk factors of complica-\ntions in the published data and our study might\nbe caused by the retrospective study design or the\nrelatively small number of adverse events,\nalthough it could also suggest that our stent\nchoice was adequate. We considered that the\nstent design substantially influenced the effective-\nness and complications of SEMS placement,\ntherefore we always strived for individualized\nstent choice. We experienced that:\n- There is no difference between the migra-\ntion rates of partially and fully covered\nstents, but fully covered stents reduce the\nrisk of tumor ingrowth. In the case of\nrepeated endoscopic interventions, the\nreposition of these stents is often easy even\nmonths after stenting.\n- There are differences between the coatings\nof SEMS. Only chemically and mechanically\nresistant coating could help to prevent tumor\ningrowth. The time for decomposition of\nTeflon (polytetrafluoroethylene) coating is\nlonger compared with silicone and polyure-\nthane coating, therefore the stent occlusion\nby tumor ingrowth may occur later. In addi-\ntion, the longer durability of SEMS coverage\nallows the stent to be repositioned an\nextended period after implantation, for\nexample in cases of stent occlusion due to\ntumor overgrowth of the stent ends.\n- Stents with a larger fitting surface at the\nends compress the esophagus less, thus the\nrisk of fistula formation at the stent ends is\nlower.\n- Flexible stents (based on our observations,\nespecially in the case of braided stent\ndesign) do not stay straight, but also adapt\nto the altered anatomy of the tumorous\nesophagus. Therefore they increase the\ninternal stent patency and result in a\nreduced and steady radial force throughout\nthe entire length of the stent. Therefore, the\nuse of SEMS with enhanced flexibility may\nprevent damage to the esophagus wall by\nthe end of the stent (ulceration, TEF for-\nmation) and decrease the intensity of\nSEMS-related retrosternal pain.\n- Bougie dilatation of esophageal stenosis\ncould be necessary before stent implantation\nto allow the passage of the endoscope through\nFigure 4. Indications of restent implantations (n = 23) and stent removal (n = 9).\nR Bor, A F\u00e1bi\u00e1n et al.\njournals.sagepub.com/home/tag 605\nthe malignant obstruction. Therefore, stents\ndiameter considering also the `rule of three'.\n- In the case of significant esophageal steno-\nsis requiring bougie or balloon dilatation,\nsmaller diameter stents could substantially\nresult in lower retrosternal pain without\nelevated risk of stent migration.\n- In the case of tumors of the upper third of\nthe esophagus and in the cardia, the use of\nspecially designed stents is essential.\n- The chemically and mechanically resistant\nstent retrieval loop may allow the move-\nment of the stent for a long time after\nimplantation.\nThese recommendations would decrease the bur-\nden to patients and could also make the treatment\nof stent complications more cost effective because\nthey may reduce the frequency of stent-related\ncomplications, the number of repeated endo-\nscopic interventions and the necessity of stent\nreimplantation.\nEndoscopic reinterventions can successfully treat\nSEMS-related complications in most of cases.15\nHomann et al. analyzed the clinical data of 133\npatients with unresectable esophageal cancer.\nThey found that delayed complications occurred\nsuccessfully treated by dilatation (24%), place-\nment of a second or third stent (27%), laser ther-\napy (16%), or placement of a feeding tube (19%).\nPatients with repeated endoscopic interventions\nhad a significantly longer life expectancy (222 \u00b1\nRecurrent dysphagia occurred in one-third of\npatients due to tumor over- or ingrowth via the\nstent, noncancerous granulomatous tissue over-\ngrowth or food impaction. In the case of stent\nobstruction, either endoscopic reposition, APC,\nexchange for a new stent or a second SEMS\nimplantation could be effective in restoring\nesophageal patency.17 Incidence of stent migra-\ntion ranges from 4% to 36%. This could be\nasymptomatic or manifest, presenting as chest\npain, recurrent dysphagia or dyspnea. Stent repo-\nsition or removal of the stent with a new stent\nimplantation are the effective endoscopic thera-\npeutic options in these cases.18 In our study, in 48\nplications oral feeding was solved by endoscopic\ninterventions (dilation, reposition, restent implan-\ntation, stent removal). We confirm that the\nsecond SEMS placement was effective in 91.31%\nof cases; one of the 23 stents migrated distally and\none was removed due to retrosternal pain. Stent\nreposition might be a good alternative to SEMS\nreimplantation due to its effectiveness, low cost\nand relative simplicity. We experienced that:\n- In the case of fully covered or double-cov-\nered SEMSs the reposition or removal is\neasy and well tolerated a few months after\nstenting, despite partial tumor ingrowth.\n- Stents can be displaced safely for centime-\nters and can also be positioned in spite of a\nsignificant migration.\n- Fixation of the proximal end of SEMS by\nhemoclips may prevent repeated stent\nmigration.\n- If repeated stent implantation is required\ndue to a fistula or tumor overgrowth at the\nstent ends, we recommend distal dragging\nof the first stent, above which a second\nstent can be implanted.\n- In the case of multiplex TEF with a thinned\nout esophageal wall, simultaneous tracheal\nand esophageal SEMS placement may be\neffective.\nIn most cases, TEF develops next to the proximal\nor distal end of the stent due to the radial force and\nresulting pressure necrosis.17 The study performed\nby Shin et al. highlighted that SEMS placement is\nclinically successful in 80% of patients with TEF,\nbut during the follow up, recurrence of fistula was\nexperienced in one third of the cases.19 We have\nfound that the risk of fistula formation is high in\npatients with TEF at the time of stenting (Figure\ntion endoscopic reposition or a second SEMS\nplacement solved the oral feeding of patients.\nRetrosternal pain often occurs after stent implan-\ntation, but it is mild to moderate in most cases,\nand could be managed with opiate analgesics.\nThe frequency of this minor complication varies\nwidely among different studies from 13% to\nretrosternal pain, but only two of them required\nendoscopic intervention, stent removal (6.89%).\nIn one quarter of patients we should expect the\ndevelopment of complications. Despite the simplic-\nity and high success rate of SEMS implantation,\nthe treatment of SEMS-related complications\nTherapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 10(8)\n606 journals.sagepub.com/home/tag\nrepresents the real clinical challenge. Our study has\nnot found any clinical factors which could help the\nselection of high-risk patients. Nonetheless, we\nconsider that the individualized stent choice could\nhelp to reduce the frequency of adverse events and\nmake repeated endoscopic interventions easier. We\nrecommend endoscopic interventions as the first-\nline treatment for SEMS-related complications\nbecause in most cases they make oral feeding pos-\nsible. Our recommendations for stent selection\nmay decrease the burden to patients and could also\nmake the treatment of stent complications more\ncost effective because they may reduce the fre-\nquency of stent-related complications, the number\nof repeated endoscopic interventions and the neces-\nsity of stent reimplantation.\n"
