This study examined the associations of objectively assessed sedentary time and\nbreaks (interruptions) in sedentary time with continuous cardio-metabolic and inflammatory risk biomarkers, and\nwhether these associations varied by sex, age, and/or race/ethnicity.\nMethods\nand results\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). An Actigraph accelerometer was used to derive sedentary time [,100\ncounts per minute (cpm)] and breaks in sedentary time. Independent of potential confounders, including moder-\nate-to-vigorous exercise, detrimental linear associations (P for trends ,0.05) of sedentary time with waist circum-\nference, HDL-cholesterol, C-reactive protein, triglycerides, insulin, HOMA-%B, and HOMA-%S were observed.\nIndependent of potential confounders and sedentary time, breaks were beneficially associated with waist circumfer-\nence and C-reactive protein (P for trends ,0.05). There was limited evidence of meaningful differences in associ-\nations with biomarkers by age, sex, or race/ethnicity. Notable exceptions were sex-differences in the associations\nof sedentary time and breaks with HDL-cholesterol, and race/ethnicity differences in the association of sedentary\ntime with waist circumference with associations detrimental in non-Hispanic whites, null in Mexican Americans,\nand beneficial in non-Hispanic blacks.\nConclusion These are the first population-representative findings on the deleterious associations of prolonged sedentary time\nwith cardio-metabolic and inflammatory biomarkers. The findings suggest that clinical communications and preventive\nhealth messages on reducing and breaking up sedentary time may be beneficial for cardiovascular disease risk.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKeywords Epidemiology  Cardiovascular risk factors  Prevention  Population  Sedentary  Accelerometry\nIntroduction\nCardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of premature\ndeath in the USA and Europe.1,2 Elevated levels of cardio-\nmetabolic and inflammatory biomarkers have been associated\nwith increased risk of CVD and premature mortality, even at\nlevels below traditional cutpoints of categorically defined risk.3,4\nLack of regular exercise is an established modifiable risk factor\nfor these biomarkers as well as incident CVD and premature mor-\ntality.5 More recently, time spent in self-reported sedentary behav-\niour has been recognized as a unique risk factor, with detrimental\nassociations observed with several of these outcomes.6 Both of\nthese behavioural risk factors are highly prevalent, with objective\nmeasures revealing remarkably low levels of moderate\u00advigorous\nexercise7 and high levels of sedentary time8 in adult populations.\nFurthermore, they are independent of each other, with the\nadverse influence of prolonged sedentary time being seen indepen-\ndent of exercise,9,10 and in those who are physically active at or\nabove recommended levels.9 These findings are consistent with\nthe idea that sedentary behaviours have the potential to influence\nrisk of disease, independent of exercise participation.\nTo date, the majority of evidence on associations of sedentary\ntime with cardio-metabolic biomarkers has been derived from self-\nreport measures. Only three studies, from Europe and Australia,\nPublished by Oxford University Press on behalf of the National Institutes of Health 2011.\nhave examined these associations using an objectively derived (via\naccelerometers) measure of sedentary time.11 \u00ad 15 These studies,\nless prone to the biases and errors of self-report, showed that\ntotal sedentary time was detrimentally associated with waist cir-\na focus on high-risk individuals,14 and have only evaluated white\nadults of European descent.11 \u00ad 15 Given that variations in the exist-\nence or strength of the associations of self-reported sedentary\ntime with measures of cardio-metabolic health have been noted\n(mostly by sex6 but also by race/ethnicity16), it is important to\nestablish (particularly in large, representative samples) whether\nsuch differences exist for objectively derived sedentary time.\nFurthermore, just as focusing exclusively on exercise time\nignores the substantial daily contribution of both light-intensity\nincidental activity and sedentary time,12 focusing only on the\ntotal time spent sedentary might overlook important issues, such\nas how sedentary time is accumulated. An accelerometer-\nmeasurement study of 168 Australian adults showed accruing\nsedentary time in shorter periods (with more interruptions) to\nbe less detrimental for cardio-metabolic health than accruing\nsedentary time in prolonged periods (with fewer interruptions).15\nHere, breaks (interruptions) in sedentary time were beneficially\nassociated with adiposity, triglycerides, and 2 h plasma glucose,\nindependent of total sedentary and exercise time.15 No other\nstudies have explored this `breaks' hypothesis in relation to cardio-\nmetabolic biomarkers.\nGiven the comparative lack of information about the relation-\nships of sedentary time with cardio-metabolic and inflammatory\nrisk in non-white populations, and the need to confirm and\nextend on earlier findings regarding breaks in sedentary time,\nour aim was to examine the associations of accelerometer-derived\ntotal sedentary time and breaks in sedentary time with cardio-\nmetabolic and inflammatory risk biomarkers in a large, ethnically\ndiverse sample of US adults.\nMethods\nThe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is\na cross-sectional study that uses a complex, multistage probability\ndesign to obtain a representative sample of the USA civilian non-\ninstitutionalized population. The methods are described in detail at:\nhttp://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm.17 The survey consists of a house-\nhold interview and an examination conducted in a mobile examination\ncentre (MEC). For this study, data were drawn from the 2003/04 and\n2005/06 NHANES cycles. For adults, response rates for the examin-\nstudy complies with the Declaration of Helsinki, the National Center\nfor Health Statistics Ethics Review Board approved the protocols,\nand written informed consent was obtained.\nStudy sample\nexcluding those who were pregnant or taking insulin) who wore an\naccelerometer were included in the present study (eligible sample:\n7797). Those with missing values for outcome variables or covariates\nor with insufficient valid accelerometer data were also excluded. Data\nfrom 4757 adults were available for full analyses (full sample), with\nsub-samples of 2118 available for fasting analyses (fasting sub-sample),\nand 910 for 2 h plasma glucose analysis (oral glucose tolerance test:\nOGTT sub-sample). Further details are provided in the Supplementary\nmaterial oline, Figure S1.\nAccelerometer data collection and analysis\nAll ambulatory participants attending the MEC were eligible for the\naccelerometer component (Actigraph 7164; Actigraph, LLC, Fort\nWalton Beach, FLA).17 The Actigraph accelerometer is a small\ngrated acceleration information as an activity count, which provides an\nobjective estimate of the intensity of bodily movement (particularly\nambulatory movement).8 As these activity counts are time and date\nstamped, detailed data on the time, volume, and intensity of movement\ncan be derived. This differs from a pedometer, which only measures\nthe volume of movement. Lack of, or minimal movement recorded\nby the accelerometer can be used to derive the time spent sedentary.\nThe accelerometer was worn on the right hip during waking hours\n(except for water-based activities) for 7 days. Initial screening excluded\ndata from monitors not in calibration and data identified as question-\nable at the download phase.17 An automated program (SAS 9.1: http://\nriskfactor.cancer.gov/tools/nhanes_pam/)8 was adapted and used to\nimplement quality control procedures, derive wear time, and summarize\nminute-by-minute data. Non-wear time was defined as intervals of at\nleast 60 consecutive minutes of 0 cpm, with allowance for up to 2 min\nof observations of some limited movement (,50 cpm) within these\nperiods. Days with at least 10 h of wear time that did not contain exces-\nsively high counts (.20 000 cpm) were considered valid. To estimate a\nlonger-term pattern of sedentary time, only participants with at least\nfour valid days (10+ h of wear), including at least 1 weekend day,\nwere included in the analyses.\nAccelerometer counts were used to classify all worn time as\n1951 cpm), or moderate\u00advigorous intensity physical activity (exercise,\ncurrent physical activity guidelines.5 Interruptions in sedentary time,\nor a transition from a sedentary (,100 cpm) to an active state\n(100 cpm), was considered a break.15 The number of breaks was\nsummed over valid days15 and the mean duration of breaks was calcu-\nlated. Correction for the influence of variation in wear time on both\nthe sedentary (total and breaks) and exercise variables was achieved\nby standardizing these values using the residuals obtained when regres-\nsing the variables on wear time.19 To facilitate interpretation of the\nclinical significance of the findings, sedentary time, breaks, and exercise\n(corrected for wear time) were examined as quartiles. Light-intensity\ntime was not examined as it had an almost perfect inverse correlation\n(Spearman's r \u00bc 20.98) with sedentary time (corrected for wear) and\nwould have caused collinearity.\nCardio-metabolic outcomes\nWaist circumference was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm at the level\nof the iliac crest. Resting systolic and diastolic blood pressures were\nmeasured three to four times with a mercury sphygmomanometer\nby trained staff and are reported as averages (excluding the first\nreading and questionable values).17 Non-fasting serum measures of\nHDL-cholesterol were collected and analysed using the Roche/\nBoehringer-Mannheim Diagnostics direct HDL method. Non-fasting\nC-reactive protein concentrations were measured by latex-enhanced\nnephelometry on a Behring Nephelometer.\nAdditionally, in a sub-sample of participants who attended the\nmorning examination (half of all sampled), fasting measures were\n  in US adults 591\nobtained for triglycerides, plasma glucose, and insulin. There was no\nexclusion for the fasting sample based on drug treatment, and no\nspecific instructions were given with respect to a drug washout\nperiod for those in this portion of the study. Triglycerides were\nmeasured enzymatically at both time points, using the Beckman\nin 2005/06. Glucose was analysed using the hexokinase method, using\nanalyser in 2005/06. Insulin was analysed via the Tosoh AIA-PACK IRI\nimmunoenzymometric assay in 2003/04 and the Merocodia Insulin\nELISA immunoassay in 2005/06. To account for differences in the\nmethods, we applied correction equations to the fasting plasma\nglucose and insulin values, after truncating values to assay-specific\ndetectable ranges (to avoid negative estimates). These corrected\nvalues were used in the Homeostatic Model Assessment to provide\nmeasures of b-cell function (HOMA-%B) and insulin sensitivity\n(HOMA-%S). Furthermore, all fasting participants in the 2005/06\nsurvey underwent an OGTT from which 2 h plasma glucose values\nwere obtained. All outcomes were treated continuously, with\nnatural log transformation applied to non-normal distributions.\nCovariates\nSocio-demographics\nInterviewer-administered questionnaires obtained socio-demographic\ninformation. Age (years) at the time of the survey was treated continu-\nously, allowing for curvilinear relationships by also modelling\nage-squared (where statistically significant). Categories of educational\nattainment, marital status and poverty\u00adincome ratio, and self-reported\nrace/ethnicity were used, as listed in the Supplementary material\nonline, Table S1.\nBehaviours\nSmoking status was categorized according to serum-cotinine levels.\nA single 24 h diet-recall coupled with US Department of Agriculture\nfood composition data measured intakes of total energy and saturated\nfat (as a percentage of total energy) and alcohol. Additionally, potass-\nium, fibre, caffeine, and calcium intakes were considered with respect\nto blood pressure. Dietary variables were examined as quintiles,\nexcept for alcohol, which was collapsed into sex-specific categories\nbased on US Dietary guidelines.20\nMedical history\nDichotomous variables were generated from self-reported medical\nhistory for diabetes, CVD, and cancer and (for females only) use of\noral contraceptives, hormone replacement and post-menopausal\nstatus. Current medication use was recorded, and coded according\nto the Lexicon Plus (Cerner Multum Inc.) database.17\nStatistical analysis\nTo obtain population-representative findings, linearized estimates with\nweightings were computed in Stata v.11 (College Station, TX, Stata\nCorporation). Two year sample weights for each NHANES cycle\nperiods. Sub-sample weights were used for the fasting and OGTT out-\ncomes; all other analyses used examination weights that were\nreweighted to account for the non-random absence of accelerometer\ndata.7 Statistical significance was set at P , 0.05 for main effects, and\nP , 0.1 for interactions; tests were two-sided.\nLinear regression analyses examined the associations of total seden-\ntary time and breaks in sedentary time with cardio-metabolic out-\ncomes. Model 1 adjusted only for age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Model\n2 additionally adjusted for socio-demographic, behavioural, and\nmedical confounding factors that a backward elimination process had\npreviously identified as specifically relevant for each outcome (P ,\n0.2 for retention: see Supplementary material online, Table S2) as\nwell as quartiles of exercise time. To examine the extent to which\ncentral obesity may mediate the associations observed with other\ncardio-metabolic outcomes, Model 3 further adjusted for waist\ncircumference. The associations for breaks were examined having\nadjusted for sedentary time (quartiles). The findings from Model 2\nare presented as the main results; the results from Model 1 and\nModel 3 are reported in Supplementary material online, Table S4.\nResults are reported as marginal means for each quartile of\nexposure, back-transformed from the log scale for the non-normal\noutcomes.\nInteractions examined whether associations varied by sex, race/\nethnicity, or age (adjusting as per Model 2, but without weighting,\nto avoid the problem of inflated standard errors). Race/ethnicity\ncomparisons excluded the `Other' race/ethnicity group, where\nthe small sample size precluded meaningful interpretation. Strati-\nfied analyses differed from the main analyses in that they adjusted\nfor reproductive variables (in female only models, if P , 0.2); rou-\ntinely adjusted for poverty\u00adincome ratio (all race/ethnicity\nmodels); used collapsed sampling strata and response categories\nfor smoking and alcohol when required due to insufficient\nnumbers; and used sex-specific, race/ethnicity specific, or sex and\nrace/ethnicity specific quartiles as appropriate. Age interactions\nwere tested using continuous age, centred on the mean\n(unweighted mean \u00bc 53.0 years).\nResults\nThe population-weighted socio-demographic and behavioural\ncharacteristics of the sub-samples (fasting, OGTT) were similar\nto the full sample and to all potentially eligible participants (see\nSupplementary material online, Table S1). Furthermore, there\nwere minimal differences between those included in the samples\nand the eligible (but excluded) participants in terms of their demo-\ngraphic characteristics and study outcomes. The average age of the\nspent in exercise. Sedentary time was broken up an average of\nClear differences by sex and race/ethnicity in accelerometer and\ncardio-metabolic characteristics were observed (see Supplemen-\ntary material online, Table S3). Females were more sedentary,\nbut had more breaks and a more-favourable cardio-metabolic\nprofile than did males. Mexican Americans were the least\nsedentary, but had significantly higher triglycerides than did non-\nHispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks. In the full sample, exer-\ncise had a moderate inverse correlation with sedentary time\nand breaks were weakly correlated overall (Pearson's r \u00bc 20.25,\nG.N. Healy et al.\nOverall associations of total sedentary\ntime and breaks with cardio-metabolic\nrisk biomarkers\nFollowing adjustment for covariates, including exercise (Table 1),\nthere were significant detrimental, linear associations of total\nsedentary time with waist circumference, HDL-cholesterol, C-\nreactive protein, triglycerides, insulin, HOMA-%B, and\nHOMA-%S. The magnitude of the average difference between\nthe top and bottom quartiles of sedentary time (a difference of\n2.3 h), was clinically meaningful for triglycerides (0.26 mmol/L),\nIndependent of total sedentary time (as well as exercise and\npotential confounders), breaks in sedentary time were significantly\ndetrimentally associated with waist circumference, C-reactive\nprotein, and fasting plasma glucose (Table 1), although only the\nfirst two were consistent, linear associations. The associations\nwith waist circumference were particularly strong and clinically rel-\nevant. Here, Quartiles 2, 3, and 4 were all significantly different\nfrom Quartile 1 (reference) and corresponded to, on average, a\n2.4, 2.9, and 4.1 cm lower waist circumference, respectively.\nSex differences\nSignificant interactions (P , 0.1) between sedentary time and sex\nwere seen with blood pressure, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides,\ninsulin, HOMA-%S, and HOMA-%B. For breaks, significant inter-\nactions were seen with these same outcomes, except for\nHOMA-%B, and also with 2 h plasma glucose. However,\nHDL-cholesterol was the only outcome for which there was any\nevidence that an association with sedentary time or breaks was\npresent for one sex but not the other (sedentary time in males;\nbreaks in females). Detailed results are available in Supplementary\nmaterial online, Table S5.\nRacial/ethnic differences\nAssociations of total sedentary time with waist circumference, sys-\ntolic blood pressure, insulin, HOMA-%B, and HOMA-%S differed\nsignificantly by race/ethnicity (Figure 1A\u00adE). The most marked\ndifference between the racial/ethnic groups was for waist circum-\nference, where sedentary time was detrimentally associated in\nnon-Hispanic whites only, with the association null for Mexican\nAmericans, and beneficial in non-Hispanic blacks. In contrast,\nsedentary time had significant detrimental associations with\ninsulin, HOMA-%B, and HOMA-%S within all racial/ethnic\ngroups, with only the shape of the relationship differing. No associ-\nation between sedentary time and systolic blood pressure was\nevident within any racial/ethnic group (despite the interaction).\nWith one exception, HDL-cholesterol (Figure 1F), associations of\nbreaks did not differ by race/ethnicity (P . 0.1). Breaks had a\nlinear, significant, beneficial association with HDL-cholesterol in\nnon-Hispanic whites but no association within both Mexican\nAmericans and non-Hispanic blacks. Detailed stratified results are\navailable in Supplementary material online, Table S6.\nAge differences\nWe examined whether the differences in cardio-metabolic out-\ncomes between quartiles of sedentary time or breaks (relative to\nthe bottom quartile) varied with each additional year of age. Signifi-\ncant interactions were observed for waist circumference (P \u00bc\n(P \u00bc 0.005) for sedentary time, and systolic blood pressure (P \u00bc\n0.005) for breaks. For each of these outcomes, the effect of seden-\ntary time or breaks was the same in direction and significance as\nwas seen previously in the overall analysis (Table 1). Detailed\nresults are presented in the Supplementary material online,\nDiscussion\nProlonged sitting time is a common feature of contemporary\nsociety.21 However, compared with other modifiable health beha-\nviours, such as diet, smoking, and lack of exercise, the potential\nhealth risks of this ubiquitous behaviour are relatively unknown.\nThis is the first study in a large, representative, multi-ethnic,\npopulation-based sample to examine the associations of objec-\ntively derived total sedentary time and breaks in sedentary time\nwith cardio-metabolic and inflammatory risk biomarkers. Indepen-\ndent of exercise time and other potential confounders, total\nsedentary time was detrimentally associated with several bio-\nmarkers, whereas breaks, independent of sedentary time, were\nbeneficially associated with waist circumference, C-reactive\nprotein, and fasting plasma glucose. These findings complement\nand build upon previous results from smaller and/or less-diverse\npopulations and highlight the importance of considering prolonged\nsedentary time as a distinct health risk behaviour that warrants\nexplicit advice in future public health guidelines.5 In particular,\nthe findings are likely to have implications for settings where pro-\nlonged sitting is widespread, such as office workplaces.\nOur findings overall, and among non-Hispanic white participants,\nwere consistent with those observed among Australian and Euro-\npean adults;11 \u00ad 15 namely, the strongest associations with sedentary\ntime were observed for triglycerides and markers of insulin resist-\nance, rather than for blood pressure. This is consistent with plaus-\nible physiological mechanisms: fewer skeletal muscle contractions\nmay result in reduced lipoprotein lipase activity and clearance of\nplasma triglycerides, reduced clearance of an oral glucose load\nfrom plasma, and less glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.21 The\nmagnitude of the differences between the top and bottom quar-\ntiles were clinically meaningful for triglycerides and insulin resist-\nance suggesting that, in theory, population wide reductions in\nsedentary time (of a magnitude of 1\u00ad2 h per day) could have a\nsubstantial impact on CVD prevention.22\nThis study also showed, for the first time, that sedentary time\nwas detrimentally associated with C-reactive protein, while\nbreaks were beneficially associated. Given that C-reactive\nprotein is an inflammatory marker associated with increased risk\nof several major disease, including coronary heart disease and vas-\ncular mortality,4 inflammation may be an adjunct pathway (along\nwith reduced muscular contractions) though which prolonged\nsedentary time may impact on CVD risk. Furthermore, as the cor-\nrelation between sedentary time and light-intensity time was\nalmost perfectly inverse, findings could also reflect the benefits\n  in US adults 593\n.............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n.............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n.............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nTable 1 Adjusted means (95% CI) for continuous cardio-metabolic biomarkers across quartiles of total sedentary time and breaks in sedentary time in US adults\nCardio-metabolic biomarker Mean (SD) or\nMedian (IQR)\nSedentary\nvariable\nQuartile 1 Quartile 2 Quartile 3 Quartile 4 P for trend\nData are adjusted means (95% CI), weighted to the USA population.

Quartile cutpoints, corrected for wear time, are 7.24, 8.51, 9.57 h/day for total sedentary time;\naBack-transformed from the log scale.\nG.N. Healy et al.\nFigure 1 Associations of total sedentary time (A\u00adE) and breaks in sedentary time (F) with cardio-metabolic biomarkers by race/ethnicity\n(Model 2) in US adults 20 years (NHANES 2003\u00ad06). Only associations where a significant interaction (P , 0.1) was observed are\nicans, and 449, 545, 638 for non-Hispanic blacks. Sedentary variables standardized for wear time prior to categorization.\n  in US adults 595\nA key contribution of this study is the confirmation and exten-\nsion of our previous findings15 indicating that patterns of sedentary\ntime accumulation are important in addition to amount of seden-\ntary time. This was particularly pertinent for waist circumference\nwhere those in the top quartile of breaks had, on average, a\n4.1 cm lower waist circumference than those in the lowest quartile.\nOf importance to note is that a break could be as short as 1 min\nand not necessarily entail `exercise', suggesting that regular breaks\nfrom sedentary time are probably feasible in many contexts.\nHowever, the measure of breaks is relatively unsophisticated: it\ndoes not differentiate between breaks of a long and/or high\nintensity, and those of a short, low intensity. More detailed exam-\nination of sedentary time patterns, as well as laboratory\nexperimental studies and real-world intervention trials examining\nthe effects of reducing and/or breaking up sedentary time, are\nneeded.\nA unique element of this study was the examination of the\nrelationship of objectively derived sedentary time with cardio-\nmetabolic biomarkers by race/ethnicity. The patterning of findings\nby race/ethnicity has some coherence with studies showing racial/\nethnic differences in the relationship of waist circumference with\nvisceral adiposity,23 the compensatory responses to insulin resist-\nance,24 lipoprotein responsiveness to exercise,25 and the relation-\nship between triglycerides and insulin resistance.26 For waist\ncircumference in particular, the racial/ethnic differences were\nquite pronounced--with no evidence of a detrimental association\nof sedentary time at all with Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic\nblacks. Regardless of whether the racial/ethnic differences are bio-\nlogical, or due to unmeasured confounding factors, it is clear that\nthis field of research needs to expand beyond predominantly white\npopulations, to explore this heterogeneity and avoid potentially\ninappropriate generalization of findings.\nA strength of our study is the objective measurement of\nexposure variables. Compared with self-report, objective\nmeasures are more precise, less biased, and reduce the potential\nfor differential measurement errors. However, some error could\nstill be present. First, estimates depend heavily on wear time,\nwhich was estimated rather than directly measured. Second, the\nuniaxial accelerometer predominantly captures ambulatory activi-\nties and cannot distinguish between different postures or variations\nin walking conditions. Thus, though the sedentary cutpoint\n(,100 cpm) provides a useful estimate of sitting time,8 some\nstanding still time may also be included as sedentary time.\nAlthough we controlled for confounding using several well-\nmeasured relevant variables, including measures of health status,\nresidual confounding is possible. For example, adjustments were\nnot made for occupational characteristics (unavailable for the\n2005/06 survey). This is unlikely to be an important issue, as a sen-\nsitivity analysis of the 2003/04 data (not reported) adjusted for\nemployment status and work type, did not attenuate any of the\nassociations statistically or in terms of effect size; most interactions\nwere also unaffected. There may have been some selection bias as\nwe excluded a large proportion of participants, predominantly for\nlacking sufficient accelerometer data to acquire habitual estimates\nof sedentary time; however, this bias is likely to be minimal, par-\nticularly in view of the reweighting for accelerometer non-\nresponse. Of importance to note is that these associations were\ncross-sectional. Thus, reverse causation is a possibility, and causal-\nity cannot be determined.\nIn summary, these population-based findings provide further evi-\ndence on the deleterious associations of sedentary time with\ncardio-metabolic health in adults, and provide novel evidence on\nthe relationship of sedentary time with the inflammatory bio-\nmarker C-reactive protein. Furthermore, we found significant ben-\neficial associations of breaking up sedentary time with\ncardio-metabolic health--particularly waist circumference--inde-\npendent of overall sedentary time. In general, these associations\nwere consistent across sex, age, and race/ethnicity subgroups. Pro-\nlonged sedentary time is likely to increase with future technological\nand social innovations,21 and it is important to consider a whole of\nday approach to physical activity promotion. Reducing and regu-\nlarly breaking up sedentary time may be an important adjunct\nhealth message, alongside the well-established recommendation\nfor regular participation in exercise. While further evidence of a\ncausal nature is required from longitudinal and intervention\nstudies, less sitting time would be unlikely to do harm, and\nwould, at the very least, contribute to increase overall levels of\nenergy expenditure.\nSupplementary material\nSupplementary material is available at European Heart Journal online.\nFunding\nThis work was supported a National Health and Medical Research\nCouncil (NHMRC #569861)/National Heart Foundation of Australia\n(PH 08B 3905) Postdoctoral Fellowship to G.N.H.; a Victorian\nHealth Promotion Foundation Public Health Research Fellowship to\nD.W.D.; and Queensland Health Core Research Infrastructure grant\nN.O.
