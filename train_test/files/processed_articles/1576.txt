It has been estimated that for 1998 more\nthan 62,000 new cases of NHL will be diagnosed in the\nUnited States [2], with NHL-related deaths being ranked\nseventh among all cancer deaths.\nIn the last 30 years the reported incidence of NHL\nmarkedly increased and has nearly doubled since the\nearly 1970s. Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology\nand End Results (SEER) data base indicate a 50% in-\nAlthough the reasons for this increase are not fully un-\nderstood, a significant number of NHL cases are linked\nto the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epi-\ndemic [4\u00ad6], thus contributing to the high incidence. The\npredisposition of immunosuppressed individuals to de-\nvelop NHL has long been recognized. Transplant recipi-\nents who have received immunosuppressive therapy have\nbeen reported to have a 28\u00ad49 times greater incidence in\nNHL compared to that of the general population [7].\nSimilarly, individuals with congenital immunodeficiency\nsyndromes have approximately 100 times greater risk of\ndeveloping NHL [1,8]. The association of lymphomas\nNHL was included in the AIDS case definition [11].\nAlthough the 5-year survival rate for persons with\nNHL has increased in recent years, the mortality rate has\nalso increased [12].

Although the reason(s) for these increases\nare not entirely known, the epidemic of HIV/AIDS has\nsubstantially contributed to the increases in reported in-\ncidence and death from NHL [22]. Through the use of\nmortality data complied from death certificates, this\nstudy demonstrates the significant effect of HIV has had\non the NHL death rate and shows that despite previous\nreports of a lower incidence of NHL among blacks with\nHIV/AIDS, the death rates among persons with HIV-\nrelated disease have been markedly higher for blacks\nthan for whites.\nFor the last 50 years, NHL incidence and mortality has\nFig. 4. Age distribution of NHL with\nHIV death rates by sex and race,\nbeen higher among whites and among males [12]. More\nrecent incidence data have suggested a similar pattern for\npersons with both AIDS and NHL [23]. The data pre-\nsented here demonstrate an increase in the NHL death\nrates for males and females as well as for whites and\nblacks. This upward trend in mortality during the 18-year\nstudy period was not surprising given the reported in-\ncrease in NHL incidence [12]. Also parallel to the re-\nported incidence data [12] was the observation that males\nhad the greatest increase in NHL deaths. Whereas whites\nhave been reported to have the highest incidence of NHL\n[12,24], this study found that although blacks had a lower\nNHL death rate than whites they had the greatest in-\ncreases in mortality. Despite a reported low NHL inci-\ndence in the South [22] and a significant increase in the\nMidwest [25], this study found no marked differences in\ndeath rates among the four regions of the United States.\nApproximately 10% of current NHL cases have been\nestimated to be AIDS related [23]. Reflective of the NHL\nincidence rate for the U.S. population, reports have in-\ndicated that among individuals with HIV/AIDS, the risk\nfor NHL is lower for blacks than for whites [22,24]. A\nsimilar decrease in NHL risk was seen for drug users\nwith HIV/AIDS [24]. These observations have led some\nto suggest a lower NHL risk for individuals of lower\nsocioeconomic status [22] and that being black is protec-\ntive [24]. However, mortality rates present a different\npicture from that of incidence data. The markedly higher\ndeath rate observed for both black males and females\nmay however be attributed to the increased incidence of\nAIDS among this population [26\u00ad28]. Also the increase\nin death among white females may also be due to the\nincreased AIDS incidence that has occurred among fe-\nmales overall [28]. Since the prognosis for HIV/AIDS\npatients with NHL is poor [29], it is doubtful that pos-\nsible differences in health care access has had any sig-\nnificant effect on the mortality rate. However, we cannot\nexclude lack of health care access as a contributing cause\nto the increased mortality rate for blacks. We also cannot\nexclude reporting differences in the coding of death cer-\ntificates or the possibility that a more aggressive subtype\nof NHL may be more common in blacks.\nIt has previously been reported that the geographic\ndistribution of HIV/AIDS has had an effect on the re-\ngional incidence of NHL. In three East Coast study sites,\nthrough1988, with persons with AIDS accounting for\n24% of this increase [30]. During the same reporting\nperiod in San Francisco, PWA were responsible for 66%\nof a 73% increase in newly diagnosed cases of NHL [30].\nDetailed analysis of the effect of HIV/AIDS on NHL\nhas been difficult to perform because of methodological\nproblems encountered in estimating the size of the risk\ngroups [30] and because NHL has also increased in\nTABLE III.

In an early attempt\nto differentiate between HIV-related NHL and non-HIV-\nrelated lymphoma in New York City, Kristal et al. [31]\nconsidered that factors other than HIV may have been\nresponsible for the increased incidence and mortality ob-\nserved for NHL. However, following incidence and mor-\ntality analysis of females and never-married males,\nKristal et al. [31] did conclude that the increases in lym-\nphoma seen in young males were probably due to HIV\ninfection and not to other causes.\nThe linkage of the Illinois AIDS and Cancer Registries\nallowed Cote\n\u00b4 et al. [32] to directly examine the relation-\nship between AIDS and cancer. This study found that\nlymphomas (mixed lymphocytic/histiocytic) occurred at\n80 times the expected rate in persons with AIDS. The\nstudy also documented that among homosexual men with\nAIDS, whites were more likely to have NHL than non-\nwhites. In a similar study linking the San Francisco AIDS\nSurveillance Registry with the California Tumor Regis-\ntry, Reynolds et al. [33] found as compared to non-\nwhites, whites had a markedly higher NHL incidence.\nThe reason(s) for this apparent racial difference was not\nknown, but it could be speculated that differential racial\npredispositions or differences in health care access could\nbe attributed to the low numbers of NHL found among\nthe non-white homosexual AIDS population as a conse-\nquence of being under diagnosed.\nCONCLUSION\nThe analysis of NHL mortality data presented here not\nonly supports and confirms findings from previous stud-\nies [12] but has also directly examined the influence of\nHIV on NHL-associated mortality. One significant find-\ning from this study is that despite other reports of a lower\nincidence rate of NHL among African-Americans with\nHIV/AIDS, death rates from lymphomas associated with\nHIV/AIDS have markedly increased in black males and\nfemales over time. This observation parallels the higher\nincidence of AIDS that has been reported for African-\nAmericans compared to whites [26\u00ad28]. Another impor-\ntant finding was a decrease in NHL/HIV mortality ob-\nserved in 1996, the last year of the study. This finding,\nwhich was in agreement with the recently documented\ndecrease in AIDS deaths, may be attributed to therapeutic\nadvances in antiviral therapy and treatment of opportu-\nnistic infections [34].\nREFERENCES\n1.
