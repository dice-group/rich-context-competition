Med.\nSurvey (NHANES) released, for the first time, the ActiGraph AM-7164 accelerometer-defined step data in addition to time in intensity\n(defined by activity counts). This accelerometer is known to have a lower sensitivity threshold than accepted pedometers, leading to\nrelatively higher step estimates. Purpose: The purpose of this analysis is to provide the population- and sex-specific epidemiology of\naccelerometer-determined steps per day with and without censoring steps detected at the lowest end of the activity spectrum (i.e.,\ninactivity). Methods: The analysis sample represents 3744 participants Q20 yr who had at least one valid day (i.e., at least 10 h) of\nmonitoring. Means (SE) for steps per day were computed using all steps (i.e., uncensored) and again after censoring those steps taken at\nan intensity G500 activity counts per minute (indicative of inactivity intensity). Results: On average, US adults took 9676 T 107\nuncensored steps per day or 6540 T 106 censored steps per day. Conclusions: The results of this nationally representative survey\nindicate that US adults take approximately 10,000 uncensored accelerometer-determined steps per day, which is improbable considering\nother studies of free-living physical activity in the United States. Until a more valid conversion factor is ascertained for translating\naccelerometer and pedometer-determined steps, our use of the G500 activity count per minute threshold holds considerable merit.\nPhysical activity assessment has benefited greatly from\nthe swift growth and development of body-worn\ntechnologies, including accelerometers and pedome-\nters, which allow precise and objective quantification of\nday-to-day physical activity patterns and volumes. Accel-\nerometers in particular provide an output (e.g., activity\ncounts), which is typically interpreted using established cut\npoints to classify time in escalating intensities of physical\nactivity (i.e., from light to vigorous intensity) (7). In turn,\nthese outputs can be used to estimate levels of adherence to\nintensity-based physical activity recommendations (16). For\nexample, the US National Health and Nutrition Examina-\ntion Survey (NHANES) uses the ActiGraph AM-7164\n(formerly distributed as CSA/MTI AM-7164; manufactured\nby ActiGraph, Fort Walton Beach, FL) to objectively\ncapture free-living physical activity behaviors. On the basis\nof these data, Troiano et al. (21) reported that less than 5%\nof monitored adults obtained 30 minIdj1 of moderate-to-\nvigorous physical activity. More recently, Matthews et al.\n(13) used these data to present time spent in sedentary\nbehaviors.\nThe accelerometer model used in NHANES also has a\nstep counter function that provides another objective\nmeasure of physical activity. The assessment and the\ninterpretation of the number of steps people take during\nthe course of a day are becoming more acceptable to\nresearchers and practitioners alike (3,17). Specifically,\ndistilling step data as steps per day offers a simple means\nof expressing habitual daily volume of physical activity.\nPrevious studies have documented the validity of the\nNHANES accelerometer model in terms of both intensity\n(7) and step outputs (10); however, it is also known to be\nmore sensitive to low threshold accelerations (e.g., slow\nwalking) compared with highly revered research-quality\npedometers (11,22). For example, in one study of free-\nliving adults (22), the ActiGraph (then distributed as the\nCSA) detected approximately 1800 more steps per day than\nthe Yamax (Yamax Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) pedometer,\nsuggesting that values of steps from one instrument cannot\nbe easily compared with the other. Unfortunately, current\ndialogues revolving around ``how many steps are enough?''\nhave been largely reflective of pedometer-determined steps\nper day, using research-quality pedometers like the Yamax\nmodel (27). In a proof of concept study, the ActiGraph\ndetected approximately 17-fold more erroneous steps than\nthe Yamax pedometer when both were worn concurrently\nduring a 20-mile car drive (11).

In a manner, the higher-intensity threshold of\nthe Yamax pedometer censors out lower-intensity accel-\nerations (i.e., does not count these as steps), effectively\ncapturing only the faster walking paces. An exact transla-\ntion of this sensitivity threshold in terms of the ActiGraph\naccelerometer steps output is not known.\nThe unique ability of the ActiGraph to capture both steps\nand intensity data simultaneously minute by minute allows\nexploration of the ``quality'' of steps taken (i.e., the number\nof steps taken at each intensity level). Further, it is possible\nthat post hoc censoring of low-intensity steps (e.g., by using\ncurrent cut points reflective of such intensity levels) in the\nNHANES data will produce an output more congruent with\npedometer-assessed expected values previously collected in\nrepresents the first NHANES opportunity to examine these\nstep data; previous releases did not make this particular\nvariable available. Therefore, the purpose of this analysis of\nis to provide the population- and sex-specific epidemiology\nof accelerometer-determined steps per day in the United\nStates with and without censoring steps detected at the\nlower end of the activity spectrum (i.e., inactivity).\nMETHODS\nsigned as a periodic survey of the nation's health profile.\nSince 1999, it has been rolled out on a continuous basis with\nrelated data releases in 2-yr increments. NHANES is collected\nyear-round and practices standardized data collection methods\nto minimize the potential for error. Initially, households are\nidentified for inclusion and a NHANES interviewer visits the\nhome. Once the household interview is completed, par-\nticipants are asked to attend a mobile examination center\n(MEC) to receive a health examination. Like preceding\nunder a complex, multistage probability design to be a\nnationally representative sample of the civilian, noninstitu-\ntionalized US population.\nThe physical activity monitor (PAM) component was\nrelease of accelerometer-determined step data in addition to\nthe more commonly collected and reported intensity and\nduration data based on accelerometer-determined activity\ncounts. Participants Q6 yr were recruited for this component\nin the MEC. Those who had walking impairments or other\nlimitations that prevented wearing an accelerometer were\nexcluded. The device was worn on the right hip using an\nelasticized fabric belt. The accelerometers were programmed\nto record information in 1-min intervals (epochs). Partic-\nipants were instructed to wear the accelerometer during\nwaking hours for 7 d, to remove them during any water\nactivities (e.g., swimming, showering, and bathing), and to\nreturn them by prepaid mail in return for a $40 remuneration.\nand consists of multiple records of sequential minute-by-\nminute activity count and step data for each participant.\nNHANES data processing and editing included review for\noutliers and unreasonable values based on published litera-\nture and expert judgment. In addition to flagging data from\ndevices that were out of calibration upon return, a variable\nwas added to indicate whether data were deemed reliable or\nnot. Examples of data flagged as not reliable were records\n(maximum value possible) activity counts per minute\n(Captain Richard P. Troiano, personal communication).\nThe National Center for Health Statistics ethics review board\napproved the original survey protocols, and informed\nconsent was obtained for all NHANES participants. The\nPennington Biomedical Research Center's institutional re-\nview board approved of this secondary analysis.\nData treatment. This analysis is limited to NHANES\nadult participants Q20 yr (individuals older than 85 yr were\ntop coded as 85) with designated reliable accelerometer data.\nTime worn (hours and minutes) was computed using a SAS\nmacro provided by the National Cancer Institute at http://\nriskfactor.cancer.gov/tools/nhanes_pam/. Keeping with pre-\nwear. Previous analyses also required at least four valid days\nof monitoring for determining an average value of steps per\nday (21). Before accepting this threshold condition, we\nanalyzed the data to ascertain potential for bias. Figure 1\ndisplays obvious bias: mean steps per day vary with valid\ndays worn. To emphasize, those with less than four valid\ndays of monitoring (n = 731) took significantly fewer\nmore valid days of monitoring (n = 3013); that is, the most\nactive people tended to wear the accelerometer for more days\nthan the least active people. We determined that by deleting\nthose participants with less than four valid days, the sample\nFIGURE 1--Mean uncensored accelerometer-determined steps per\nday by valid days (i.e., Q10 h) worn.\nACCELEROMETER STEPS PER DAY IN US ADULTS Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise\nd\nCopyright @ 200 by the American College of Sports Medicine.

We therefore decided that it was more appropriate to\nbase this descriptive analysis on the 3744 participants who\nhad at least one valid day of monitoring. Other analyses have\nalso included those with at least one valid day (13).\nIntensity of steps taken was anchored using activity count\nminute of records for each individual, and the activity\ncounts recorded in each minute were accordingly classified\nbased on 2020 activity counts per minute (indicating\nactivity counts per minute (indicating vigorous intensity\nequivalent to Q6 METs). For these analyses, we further\nstratified the lower-intensity categories (i.e., G2020 activity\ncounts per minute) into inactive (0\u00ad499 activity counts per\nintensities in agreement with earlier analyses (22). Finally,\nwe adopted the Matthews et al. (13) cut point of G100\nactivity counts per minute to define sedentary behaviors;\nwhich also required that we adjust the inactive intensity to\nStep data were recorded concurrently minute-by-minute.\nSteps per minute were summed over the 1440-min day to\nproduce a cumulative daily record. We linked the step data\nwith the activity count data to identify steps taken at each\naccelerometer-defined intensity. Daily steps were summed\nand divided by the number of days the accelerometer was\nworn to derive average steps per day. We used established\npedometer-determined physical activity cut points for healthy\nadults (23) to organize steps per day\u00addefined activity levels:\n(``active''); and 5) Q12,500 steps per day (``highly active'').\nanalysis, we further segmented the sedentary category\ninto G2500 steps per day (``basal physical activity'') and\nstrategy also helped to keep the pedometer-defined sedentary\nlevel (which encompasses basal and limited physical activity\nlevels) distinct from the accelerometer-defined sedentary\nintensity (i.e., G100 activity counts per minute).\nAnalysis. All analyses were performed using procedures\nfor sample survey data that are readily available in the\nSAS\u00d3 System for Windows Version 9.1 (SAS Institute,\nCary, NC, 2004) to account for the complex sampling\ndesign of NHANES. All analyses included sample weights\nto account for oversampling and nonresponse to provide\nnationally representative results. Sex-specific means, SE,\nand 95% confidence intervals (CI) for steps per day were\ncomputed using all steps (i.e., uncensored) and again after\ncensoring out those steps taken at an intensity G500 activity\ncounts per minute. We examined the proportion of\nuncensored and censored steps taken at each of the\naccelerometer-determined intensities by sex. Finally, we\nreport the proportion of the population who were catego-\nrized at each of the step-defined activity levels described\nabove, considering both uncensored and censored steps.\nRESULTS\nSample characteristics (i.e., sex, age group, and race or\nethnicity) of adult NHANES respondents who participated\nrequirements for this analysis are presented in Table 1.\nsample of 4372 adults. Three hundred and fifty-six were\nexcluded based on NHANES reliability flags; 272 were\nexcluded because they did not meet the threshold condition\nof at least 1 day with the minimum of 10 h of wear time.\nTable 2 shows the mean wear time and uncensored and\ncensored steps per day. On average, the US sample took\ncensored steps per day. On average, males wore the device\n30 min longer than females during the monitoring day and\nsteps per day when lower-intensity steps were censored.\nFigure 2 displays uncensored and censored steps per day\nfor males and females, segmented to show the proportion of\nsteps (relative to the sex-specific total) that are taken within\neach accelerometer-defined intensity category. The greatest\nproportion of daily steps are taken at light intensity for\nmales (47% of uncensored and 66.9% of censored) and\nextremely few steps are taken at sedentary intensity, and no\nsteps are taken during nonwear time (which therefore does\nnot appear in Fig. 2). Because both sedentary and inactive\nsteps are not considered with censoring, these steps do not\nappear under this condition, increasing the relative percen-\ntages of all other intensities.\nFigures 3\u00ad5 present the proportion of the population, and\nby sex, who were categorized at each of the step-defined\nTABLE 1.

As anticipated, censoring shifts\nall of the curves to the left. The modal frequency in the total\nsample for uncensored steps is ``somewhat active,'' whereas\nit is ``limited activity'' for the censored steps. Censoring\nalso attenuates the predominant peak of highly active males\nthat the uncensored data suggest.\nDISCUSSION\nThe results indicate that US adults in this nationally\nrepresentative sample took approximately 10,000 uncen-\nsored accelerometer-determined steps per day. This is\nconsiderably higher than at least two US samples: Colorado\nper day) (26). Further, it approximates a level of steps per\nday that is used to identify active individuals (23,27) and\ntherefore suggests that physical activity intervention is\nunwarranted in this country. In reality, however, evidence\ncontinues to accumulate that the American obesity epidemic\npersists and is actually growing in magnitude unthwarted\n(4,15). Further, other NHANES accelerometer estimates\n(based solely on time in intensity, not steps taken) conclude\nthat G5% of adults adhere to public health recommendations\nfor physical activity (21). These incompatible results from\nthe same instrument administered using highly controlled\nand systematic measurement protocols demand explanation.\nThe measurement of ``step'' is inexact and unregulated by\nany authoritative body with a single exception: pedometer\nquality is regulated by Japanese industry standards to a\nmaximum permissible miscounting error of 3% (9). It has\nbeen previously noted that Japanese-manufactured pedome-\nters are among the most accurate instruments available to\nmeasure steps per day (5). Outside of Japan and lacking\nindustry standards to guide instrument performance, manu-\nfacturers are independent to operationally define a step for\ntheir own purposes. Unfortunately, enduring continued\nlowering of sensitivity thresholds in a dogged pursuit of\n``every step'' results in a predictable sensitivity/specificity\ntrade-off that blurs the more important focus on health-related\nphysical activity. Further, manufacturers' attempts at stan-\ndardization are inevitably constrained by patents protecting\ntheir unique designs. There are also concerns that models\nwithin the same brand are discrepant in measurement\nmechanism; new evidence derived from mechanical oscilla-\ntions suggests that a newer generation of the ActiGraph\nTABLE 2.

This implies that fewer\nlow-intensity steps would be detected and that population\nestimates of steps per day would also be lower if this newer\nmodel were to be adopted. A head-to-head comparison of the\ndifferent generations of the ActiGraph under free-living\nconditions has not yet been conducted, so again, no con-\nversion factor is available at this time. A solution to these\nmeasurement issues is not straightforward and also not\nwithin the scope of this manuscript. However, because\nFIGURE 3--Proportion of the population who were categorized at each of the step-defined activity levels, considering both uncensored and censored steps.\nFIGURE 4--Proportion of males in the population who were categorized at each of the step-defined activity levels, considering both uncensored and\ncensored steps.\nhttp://www.acsm-msse.org\n1388 Official Journal of the American College of Sports Medicine\nCopyright @ 200 by the American College of Sports Medicine. Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.\ncurrent steps per day recommendations (23,27) and cut\npoints (6,24,28) are based on the output of similarly\nperforming research-quality pedometers, it behooves us to\nattempt to interpret the NHANES accelerometer-determined\nsteps per day output accordingly.\nAlthough instrument sensitivity thresholds are known\nto differ between the ActiGraph 7164 and the Yamax pe-\ndometer, for example, there is not an exact method of\nconverting the output of one to the other. Although we pre-\nviously demonstrated that the ActiGraph (then distributed as\nthe CSA) detected approximately 1800 more steps per day\nthan the Yamax pedometer in a small free-living sample (22),\nwe felt it was too simplistic to apply this single strategy\nuniformly to all NHANES PAM participants in a broad-\nhanded attempt to make their accelerometer-determined\nsteps per day appear more congruent with that of research-\nquality pedometers. A more acceptable strategy would\nconsider each individual's unique activity patterns and\nwould attempt to censor out excessive low-force acceler-\nations that are more likely to be picked up by this\naccelerometer (11,22). Obviously, our decision to censor\nthose steps taken G500 activity counts per minute was\narbitrary. However, faced with no exact conversion factor,\nwe believe that it was a logical choice. Extrapolating from\nwork done by Barnett and Cerin (2), 500 activity counts per\nminute is approximately equal to walking at 2.7 kmIhj1 or\n1.7 milesIhj1. Interpreting a figure provided by Matthews\n(12) gives a good indication of the types of ambulatory\nactivities that would fall below 500 activity counts per\nminute, for example, steps undertaken while cooking,\nironing, washing dishes, grocery shopping, laundry, and\nlight cleaning. We did consider censoring those steps taken\nat G100 activity counts per minute, following the study of\nsedentary time by Matthews et al. (13). However, using this\ncut point reduced total estimates by only 557 steps per day\n(because very few steps are detected when sitting is\nimplied). We also considered censoring out all those steps\ntaken at less than moderate intensity (i.e., at G2020 activity\ncounts per minute); however, this drastically reduced steps\neither. Until a more valid conversion factor is ascertained\nfor translating accelerometer and pedometer-determined\nsteps, our use of the G500 activity count per minute\nthreshold holds considerable merit.\nIt is important to disclose here that the previous acceler-\nometer analysis focused on time in moderate to vigorous\nintensity (21), indicating that G5% of US adults were\nachieving recommended amounts of physical activity. As\nindicated above, even our conservative use of censored steps\nday (``somewhat active'' to ``highly active''). It is apparent\nthat the decision rules that count only minimal 10-min bouts\nabove set activity counts per minute are much more re-\nstrictive than the allowance for accumulation of a volume of\nsteps taken over the course of a day. Perhaps the literal trans-\nlation of a recommendation primarily based on self-report\n(21) is too narrow to reflect what may truly be healthful\nphysical activity. This is, of course, pure speculation in an\nattempt to reconcile vastly discrepant conclusions. Continued\nresearch using multiple instruments and/or cross-tabulated\nFIGURE 5--Proportion of females in the population who were categorized at each of the step-defined activity levels, considering both uncensored\nand censored steps.\nACCELEROMETER STEPS PER DAY IN US ADULTS Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise\nd\nCopyright @ 200 by the American College of Sports Medicine. Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.\nexamination of different outputs (e.g., step and activity count)\nwithin the same instrument will likely provide additional\ninsight into these measurement conundrums.\nSeveral limitations must be acknowledged. First, like\nother waist-mounted motion sensors, the ActiGraph is most\nsensitive to ambulatory activity (i.e., walking), missing\nupper body movements, load carrying, and water activities\n(the latter of which requires removal of the instrument).\nHowever, walking is the most prevalent form of leisure time\nphysical activity in the United States (20) and is a\nfunctional part of daily life (25). Further, those activities\nmost likely to be missed (e.g., swimming, aqua-fitness,\nbicycling) or underestimated (e.g., weight-training, yoga)\nby waist-mounted motion sensors are infrequently per-\nformed (8). Attempts to adjust for nonambulatory steps\ntaken for these types of activity are unwarranted in terms of\npopulation estimates (14).\nSecond, there are many different activity count cut-point\nvalues that have been used to ascertain moderate and/or\nvigorous physical activity using this particular accelerometer.\nFor example, the choice of cut point will affect classification of\nmoderate-intensity steps; a lower cut point (e.g., 1952 (7) vs\n2020 used herein) will shift more light-intensity steps into the\nmoderate-intensity category. We decided it was most appro-\npriate to use the same cut points that had been previously used\nwith the NHANES data (21).\nThird, the question of ``how many days'' should a motion\nsensor be worn to achieve a valid and reliable estimate\nof habitual activity continues to be debated (1). Before\naccepting a previously implemented threshold of 4 d (21),\nwe examined the relationship between steps per day and\ndays monitored and discovered a pattern suggesting a self-\nselection bias. As indicated above, the most active people\ntended to wear the accelerometer for more days, and the\nleast active people wore it for fewer days. Although it is\ntempting to eliminate those at the lower end, basing the\nargument on presumed lack of compliance, this act inflates\nphysical activity estimates by screening out the most\nsedentary individuals. Wearing a physical activity monitor\nis not a blind experience. We speculate that it is plausible\nthat those who are most active enjoy showing this and are\ntherefore readily compliant with the regimen. In contrast,\nthe most sedentary can easily realize that this is a physical\nactivity monitor, and because they do not typically do any\nphysical activity, they may grow weary of the whole point\nof wearing the instrument at all and therefore give up ear-\nlier. Put another way, fewer days of wear may be a reason-\nable proxy estimate for a sedentary lifestyle.\nFinally and along these lines also falls the question\nconcerning minimal time worn: how long must a PAM be\nworn to capture a valid day of physical activity? The worry\nis that we will miss physical activity performed when the\nmotion sensor is not attached. Schmidt et al. (19) performed\na thorough examination of this question in regards to\npedometer time worn. They assessed alternative methods\nfor adjusting for wear time and also evaluated the\nrelationship between steps and associated biological mea-\nsures (e.g., BMI, waist circumference, and systolic blood\npressure) to determine whether any manner of adjustment\nimproved correlations observed using the raw data. None of\nthe adjustment methods used produced substantially stron-\nger associations. Ultimately, the researchers concluded that\nerror related to wear time is dependent on participants'\nactivity level when not wearing the pedometer; if those\npeople who wear it for a short time also do little physical\nactivity when it is off, then the magnitude of error is\nminimal. They also asserted that adjusting for wear time\nusing a stepping rate (e.g., steps per hour) might actually\noverestimate physically activity in those individuals with a\nshort wear time who are not active after they take off the\npedometer. It is our speculation that those who are\nphysically active are reluctant to remove a motion sensor\nthat is able to capture their lifestyle. Further, those who are\nmore physically inactive are likely to remove the device\nearly if they believe that it has nothing more to assess (i.e.,\nit is not relevant) in their typically sedentary day.\n2006 NHANES offers both accelerometer-defined step data\nin addition to time in intensity (defined by activity counts).\nBecause this accelerometer is known to detect more low-\nforce movements than accepted research-quality pedome-\nters, this analysis examined population- and sex-specific\ndescriptive epidemiology of accelerometer-determined steps\nper day with and without censoring steps detected at\nthe lowest end of the activity spectrum (i.e., inactivity).\nThe uncensored values obtained are almost 3000 steps per\nday more than what might be expected compared with other\npedometer-based studies of free-living physical activity\nin the United States. Censoring these accelerometer data\nusing a defensible activity count per minute cut point\nprovides a distribution that is more in line with current\nunderstanding. Further cross-examination of these robust\nobjectively monitored data is warranted to advance under-\nstanding of patterns of physical activity and inactivity in\nthe United States.\nThe authors would like to thank Meghan McGlone for her\nassistance with data analysis and presentation.
