    "abstract": "Abstract\nAdherence to treatment of diabetes mellitus (DM) can support successful therapy due to drug consumption over longtime\nperiods. The objectives of this study are to evaluate the treatment adherence in DM as related to the quality of life and to\nevaluate factors associated with adherence and quality of life. This study used the Brief Medication Questionnaire (BMQ) to\nmeasure patients' adherence. The Diabetes Quality of Life Clinical Trial Questionnaire (DQLCTQ) was used to measure\npatients' quality of life. Subjects of this cross-sectional study were DM patients attending two private hospitals in Yogyakarta\nand who had been taking DM medications for more than 6 months. Statistical analyses used in this study were student's\nt test and regression linear test. We recruited 65 DM patients who met the inclusion criteria. There were no significant\ndifferences of BMQ screens and DQLCTQ functions between monotherapy and combination therapy groups (p> .05). The\nBMQ screens' score of combination therapy were higher than monotherapy groups. The physical function, health distress,\nand mental health of combination therapy groups were higher than monotherapy group. The male patients had significantly\nhigher score of regimen domain of BMQ than female patients (0.35 and 0.17, respectively). The older age has the lower score\nof treatment effect of DQLCTQ (p< .05). The belief, recall, and belief about adverse drug reaction of BMQ have positive\ncorrelation with physical function (r = .542, .424, and .640, respectively). Our study concluded that the quality of care, sex,\nand age may predict patients' adherence and quality of life. There were positive correlation between patients' adherence and\nquality of life.\n",

The discontinuation\nrates of the medication on the 30 days of treatment reached\n42% and non oral treatment of DM had the high risk of dis-\ncontinuation (Vanelli et\nResearch involving outpatients shows that more than 70% of\npatients do not adhere to correct administration and appro-\npriate medicine dosage (Basuki, 2009). According to the\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) report in 2003, average\nof patient adherence in long-term therapy for chronic dis-\neases in developed countries is only 50%, while in develop-\ning countries, it is even lower (Asti, 2006). The prevalence of\nnonadherence in diabetic patients is high, due to the duration\nof treatment, and may lead to an increase in mortality, mor-\nbidity, and other adverse effects (Blackburn, Swidrovich, &\nshowed that nonadherence in oral antidiabetic treatment was\nassociated with the incidence of end-stage renal disease, and\nthe effect was more significant in the polytherapy of oral\nantidiabetic treatment and under the metformin polytherapy,\nbesides other risk factors (Chang, Chien, Lin, Chiou, & Chiu,\nAdherence to treatment involves patient psychology, such\nas knowledge and motivation.

Under such conditions, the quality of medical services\nwill negatively affect, so it is necessary to encourage condi-\ntions that improve individual motivation toward the adoption\nof long-term treatment, including their quality of life\n(Sarafino, 1998). A previous study about health-related qual-\nity of life (HRQoL) of type 2 DM patients in Bangladesh\nshowed that some patients' characteristics like age, gender,\nincome, education, family history, duration of DM, and treat-\nment prescribed could affect patients' quality of life (Saleh,\nMumu, Ara, Hafez, & Ali, 2014). Other previous study in\nMalaysia reported that the use of insulin could give negative\nimpact to the patients' quality of life. Patients treated with\ninsulin, who also supported by strict lifestyle management,\ngot desired glycemic control. However, that management\ncould cause the deterioration in quality of life (Daher etal.,\nOne method for understanding patient adherence is the\nuse of the Brief Medication Questionnaire (BMQ). The ques-\ntionnaire illustrates the patient's assumptions toward medi-\ncation, including necessity, awareness, illustration of painful\neffects, and excessive drug use (Menckeberg etal., 2008). A\nprevious study conducted on type 2 DM patients in Iran con-\ncluded that low BMQ scores were related to low patient\nadherence, which resulted in experiences of adverse drug\nThe Diabetes Quality of Life Clinical Trial Questionnaire\n(DQLCTQ) is one of the DM quality of life questionnaires\ndeveloped by the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes\nStudy (UKPDS) group. This instrument has been piloted in\nSan Francisco, California, and Lyon, for type 1 and type 2\nDM patients. The items measured in the DQLCTQ include 8\ndomains: physical function, energy/fatigue, health distress,\nmental health, satisfaction, treatment satisfaction, treatment\nflexibility, and frequency of symptoms. Total scores vary\nbetween 0 (poor quality of life) and 100 (highest quality of\nlife). The higher scores indicate a better health status (Shen\netal., 1999). To date, there have been no studies in Indonesia\nwith the objective of exploring patient adherence and quality\nof life in DM patients or to analyze predictors using the\nBMQ and DQLCTQ questionnaires. The objectives of this\nresearch are to evaluate the treatment adherence in DM as\nrelated to the quality of life and to evaluate factors associated\nwith adherence and quality of life.\nMethod\nParticipants\nThis study used a cross-sectional design and the data were col-\nlected prospectively. We conducted this study at two private\nhospitals in Yogyakarta. The subjects of this research were all\ntype 2 DM outpatients who had used a minimum of 6 months\nmonotherapy or combination therapy since diagnosis. Inclusion\ncriteria were type 2 DM patients, at least 6 months after initial\ndiagnosis, who voluntarily became involved in the research,\nand were literate. Exclusion criteria were type 2 DM patients\nwho were suffering chronic disease complications, patients\nwith psychiatric diseases and who did not volunteer to enroll in\nthis research. We excluded these patients by finding the diagno-\nses in their medical records. By excluding the complications of\nthe patients, we also excluded the patients with comedications.\nPatients who used monotherapy DM treatment had only one\nkind of DM medication, whether oral or injection. Patient who\nused combination DM therapy used a combination of more\nthan two types of DM medication as well as oral\u00adoral, oral\u00ad\ninjection, or injection\u00adinjection (combination of short acting\ninsulin and medium acting insulin).\nWe conducted and compared our study in two private hos-\npitals which are under the similar organization in Yogyakarta.\nThe differences between the hospitals are the location, the\ncapacity, and the status of hospital. The Hospital A is located\nin the city, higher capacity and having status as education\nhospital. However, the Hospital B is located in urban area,\nlower capacity and the education hospital status is still sub-\nmitted to the government. Thus, the differences between the\nhospitals could be according to the typical of the patients\nwhich came around the city and the urban area. Both of the\nhospitals are the referral hospitals from the primary health\ncare, and the government health insurance has been applied\nin the two hospitals. There are no differences between the\ntreatment guideline, due to the universal health coverage\napplied in the hospitals.\nPatients at both hospitals were asked to join the research\nvoluntarily and to give their informed consent. To aid quality\ncontrol during data collection, the researcher accompanied\nthe patients while they completed the questionnaires. This\nresearch was approved by the Research Ethic Committee of\nUniversity of Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta.\nQuestionnaires\nWe used the Indonesian version of the BMQ and an already\nvalidated Indonesian version of the DQLCTQ. The two\nquestionnaires were used in this study due to the availability\nof DQLCTQ in Bahasa Indonesia and the short version of\nBMQ. Adherence to treatment was measured by the BMQ\nwith the screen of dose regimen, recall, access, and belief.\nThe regimen screen has 0 to 5 scale; however, the recall,\naccess, and beliefs screens have 0 to 2 scale. There are also\nthree questions about fear or worry about drug side effect\nwhich has 0 to 3 scale. The higher scale of screens is the bet-\nter compliance and positive concern about recall, access, and\nbeliefs, and less fear about side effect. This questionnaire has\n0 to 1 scale which shows the higher score is the better adher-\nence (Svarstad etal., 1999). This study was preceded by a\nforward\u00adbackward translation from the original version of\nBMQ to obtain an Indonesian BMQ version and was fol-\nlowed by pilot testing and a validity and reliability test for\nPerwitasari and Urbayatun 3\nDM patients. Validation and reliability tests using the\nIndonesian version of the BMQ were conducted on 20 DM\npatients. Forward and backward translation of the BMQ was\ncarried out before this study. Two Indonesian translators who\nwere experts in the English language performed the forward\ntranslation process. Discussions were carried out to compare\nthe questionnaires and agree on one version in Bahasa\nIndonesia. The Indonesia version was backward translated\nby a native speaker who was fluent and understood Bahasa\nIndonesia.To corroborate the translation result, an Indonesian\nwho was an expert in the English language performed a\nbackward translation. The comparison of the two results\nfrom the backward translation and the original version of the\nquestionnaire were performed, and one version in Bahasa\nIndonesia was obtained with the same content as the original\nversion.\nThe results of a pilot test on the first draft of the Indonesian\nBMQ version were related to the layout of the questionnaire.\nThe respondent suggested a clearer layout for the question-\nnaire to make it easier to answer. Pilot testing also showed\nthat there were no significant differences in the domains of\nbeliefs and adherence among healthy respondents and sick\nrespondents (p> .05). However, a significant difference was\nseen in the dosage regimen domain among healthy and sick\nrespondents (data not shown). This result can be explained\nbecause healthy respondents did not take drugs, so there\ncould be no problem with their dosage regimen.\nWe used the Cronbach's alpha coefficient which was\nmore than .7 to meet the criteria of validity. Furthermore, the\nconstruct validity to measure the convergent and discrimi-\nnant validity of Indonesian version of BMQ was performed\n(P\u00e9rez-Escamilla, Franco-Trigo, Moullin, Mart\u00ednez-\nPatient quality of life was measured with the DQLCTQ\nwith the domains of physical function, energy, health dis-\ntress, mental health, satisfaction, treatment satisfaction,\ntreatment effect, and frequency of symptoms. This question-\nnaire has 0 to 100 scale which shows the higher score is the\nbetter quality of life. The Indonesian version of DQLCTQ\nhas been validated in the previously study (Hartati & Asdie,\nStatistical Analysis\nCronbach's alpha coefficient was defined to understand the\nreliability of Indonesian version of BMQ. Pearson-correlation\ntest was performed to understand the construct validity of\nIndonesian version of BMQ. The item of questionnaires met\nthe convergent validity if significantly related to its domain\nand met the discriminant validity if the relation between item\nand its domains was higher than its relation with other\nThe differences between the BMQ and DQLCTQ scores,\nbetween the monotherapy and combination therapy groups,\nand between the two hospitals were tested using the student's\nt test (for parametric tests) or the Mann\u00adWhitney test (non-\nparametric tests). Regression linear tests were used to under-\nstand the predictors of adherence and quality of life.\nResults\nAn earlier step in our study was the translation and validation\nof the Indonesian version of the BMQ. The Indonesian\nDQLCTQ was available as a validated version.\nTable 1 presents the Cronbach's alpha value (>.70), which\nshows that all BMQ domains met the criteria for reliability.\nThe results of the validation test can be seen in Table 2. All\nquestions and domains of the Indonesian BMQ version met\ndiscriminant and convergent validity with significant results\n(p< .01), except for Question Number 7c on the regimen\ndomain and the Question Number 2 of recall domain. That\nwas because there was only one answer from the respondent,\nso it was not possible to have variation.\nTable 3 presents patient characteristics; most of the\n11.41, and they were prescribed combination therapy for DM\ntreatment (66.2%). The score of BMQ screen was good,\nwhich mean that the patients adhere to the regimen of the\ntreatment (4.45 \u00b1 0.95), the patients had a good recall of their\nmedication (1.92 \u00b1 0.97), the refill of medication was afford-\nable (1.93 \u00b1 0.30), the belief about the effectiveness of their\nmedication was good (1.71 \u00b1 0.55), and there was less fear or\nThe results of the BMQ and quality of life analysis regard-\ning the type of patient treatment (monotherapy and combina-\ntion therapy) are shown in Tables 4 and 5. There were no\nsignificant differences of BMQ screens between the types of\ntreatment. Moreover, there were no quality of life differences\nbetween the monotherapy and combination therapy groups.\nWe analyzed the scores differences of BMQ domains and\nquality of life domains between two hospitals. The dosage\nregimen shows significant differences between the two hos-\npitals, which is patients of Hospital B had a higher mean\nscore for dosage regimen than those of Hospital A (4.18 \u00b1\nthere was significant difference between the two hospitals in\nthe treatment effect domain (p< .01). Patients of Hospital B\nhad a higher mean treatment effect than those of patients at\nHospital A. Generally, the quality of life domains score was\nmore than 70, which showed that the quality of life at both\nTable 1. Reliability Test of Indonesian Version of BMQ.\nDomain Cronbach's  value\nNote. BMQ = Brief Medication Questionnaire.\n4 SAGE Open\nhospitals was quite high, except for the treatment effect\ntively) and the patients' satisfaction domain in both hospitals\n(data were not shown).\nRegarding the demographic factors in this study, we found\nthat only the BMQ regimen domain was significantly differ-\nent between sexes. The mean score of the regimen domain of\nmale patients was higher than for female patients (0.35 and\n0.17, respectively; p = .03). However, only the treatment\neffect domain of the DQLCTQ showed a significant differ-\nence between sexes with the score of male patients being\ntively; p< .01). However, patient age significantly affected\nthe DQLCTQ treatment effect domain (r = .28, p< .02, data\nwere nor shown).\nAccording to the correlation between BMQ domain and\nquality of life domain, we find that beliefs, recall, and beliefs\nabout adverse event screens of BMQ had positive correlation\n.05, data were not shown).\nDiscussion\nIn general, we found positive correlation between adherence\nto medication and quality of life. Patient demographic fac-\ntors like age and sex affect patient's adherence and quality of\nlife. There are no significant differences of BMQ screens and\nDQLCTQ functions scores between monotherapy and com-\nbination therapy. On the contrary, there are some significant\ndifferences of BMQ screens and DQLCTQ functions scores\nbetween the two hospitals. Our findings were supported by\nprevious study which stated patient's access to drugs which\nwas definitely determined by the distance between the\npatient's house and the hospital, the duration of disease,\ncomplexity of treatment, polytherapy, psychological factors,\nsafety, and tolerability became potential reasons for patients'\nnonadherence. It means that adherence will decline with an\nincrease in drug numbers (Garc\u00eda-P\u00e9rez, \u00c1lvarez, Dilla, Gil-\nAccording to high scores of BMQ screens and moderate\nscores of DQLCTQ, it can be a challenge for health care pro-\nviders, especially pharmacists, nurses, doctors, and psychol-\nogists, to motivate patients to carry out their therapy properly.\nOf course, this is not an easy thing, because collaboration\nfrom various health personnel is needed to help patients to\nadapt to their disease and treatment. Previous studies have\nstated that DM health care teams should collaborate to sup-\nport patients to cope with the disease and treatment, and thus\nto improve their adherence (Delamater, 2006). Another pre-\nvious French study shows that most diabetic patients have\nmedium adherence which is affected by demographic fac-\ntors, health provider-related factors, and disease treatment-\nrelated factors (Miv et\nmodifiable, meaning that the health care provider can give\nindividualized patient recommendations. However, some\ndemographic factors like older age and complexity of disease\nand treatment could not be modified.\nAccording to the DM treatment type, the score of all\nscreen in BMQ for combination therapy is higher than for the\nmonotherapy group. A previous study also shows that\ndecreased adherence was related to polytherapy (Claxton,\nCramer, & Pierce, 2001). This factor can be modified by\nchanging the medication into a simple regimen which can be\nmanaged by patients. There was also no difference in quality\nof life between the monotherapy group and combination\ntherapy. The previous study used the EuroQol five dimen-\nsionsquestionnaire (EQ-5D), which only consisted of five\nquestions; this certainly helped the patients to fill in the ques-\ntionnaire with ease. This study shows that patients with low\nadherence have a low quality of life (Saleh etal., 2014). In\ncontrast, the current research showed that, on average, a\npatient's quality of life was quite good (score >75) except on\nsome domains such as satisfaction and treatment effect. This\ndifference could be caused by sample number, variation due\nTable 2.

Other previous studies regarding factors\nrelated to the quality of life of diabetic patients stated that\nDM had a negative impact on patients'quality of life and that\ncomorbidity may further decrease patients' quality of life\nPatients' quality of life at both hospitals was only signifi-\ncantly different with regard to the domain of treatment effect.\nThis treatment effect can be categorized into therapeutic\neffects and adverse effects. Adverse effects of treatment may\nappear when the drug is taken for a long time period or may\nbe due to the interaction with other drugs taken for other\npathologic conditions. Previous studies showed that nonad-\nherence of DM patients was significantly related to medica-\ntion-adverse effect (Chao, Nau, & Aikens, 2012; Rwegerera,\nexperience complications may be given more than three\ntypes of drug, which could result in drug interaction and\nadverse effects (Curkendall, Thomas, Bell, Juneau, & Weiss,\nunderstand that such issues will of course affect patient\nquality of life as patients may avoid taking DM medication,\nand therefore, therapeutic effects will decrease. However, if\na patient decided to continue on taking DM medication\ndespite the unpleasant side effects, the patient may suffer\nduring treatment. In general, the quality of life for DM\npatients at both hospitals was quite high, with scores >75,\nexcept for some domains such as satisfaction and treatment\neffect. Most of the type 2 DM patients experienced hypogly-\nadherence (Chao etal., 2012; Nam, Chesla, Stotts, Kroon &\nJanson, 2011). Because of the long duration of treatment,\nother adverse effects such as constipation, headaches, and\nwater retention may also result in nonadherence in diabetic\npatients (Garc\u00eda-P\u00e9rez etal., 2013). Poor adherence can have\nclinical impacts such as a decrease in glycemic control, com-\nplication of the disease, mortality, and hospitalization\n(American Diabetes Association [ADA], 2013; Blackburn\ndata of adverse effect experienced by the patients. However,\nwe can see patients' perceptions about adverse effect in the\nbeliefs domain of BMQ. We can see the hypoglycemia effect\nfrom the domain of treatment effect and frequency of symp-\ntoms of DQLCTQ, because DQLCTQ adopted the hypogly-\ncemic fear survey in its domain (Shen et\nTable 3.

However, there were three questions about the fear of\npatients toward adverse effect. The patients in both of the\nhospitals had less fear or worry about drug adverse event.\nThis finding was also supported by higher score of treatment\neffect of DQLCTQ, whereas the higher score of Hospital B\nreflected that patients in Hospital B had better treatment\neffect than Hospital A. According to the patients' adherence,\nwe can see that patients in Hospital A had lower score of\nadherence than Hospital B, and it could be due to the higher\nadverse effect fear experienced by patients of Hospital A.\nAccording to the hospital's service, even though Hospital\nA is located in the city and has higher status level, the\nHospital B could provide better health service and could be\nacceptable to the patients. Thus, Hospital B supported\npatients' attempts to adhere to their medical treatment and\ncope with the disease in their life. The integrated health ser-\nvice in the Hospital B from the physician, nurse, pharmacist,\nand dietician could support patients' adherence. A previous\nstudy showed that demographic, psychological, social sup-\nport; health care providers; medical systems; disease; and\ntreatment-related factors can promote diabetic patients'\nadherence. Social support given by nurses in DM health care\nteams may improve glycemic control, lipid levels, and blood\npressure levels (Delamater, 2006). The multidisciplinary\napproach to the diabetes management and the nature of clini-\ncal setting can influence patients' adherence and quality of\nlife (Nau, 2012). The results of the previous study are in line\nwith our study, which showed that the sex and age of patients\nmay influence patients' adherence and quality of life.\nOur study also found that the physical domain of\nDQLCTQ was affected by BMQ domain such as belief,\nrecall, and beliefs about Adverse Drug Event (ADE). It\nmeans that patients'belief about the effectivity of their medi-\ncation, and about the ADE and patients' adherence in taking\nthe medication, can predict patients' quality of life. These\nresults are in line with previous study in which medication\nadherence had positive correlation with DM patients quality\nof life (Chew, 2015). However, previous studies about the\ncorrelation of DM patients' adherence and HRQoL in\nPakistan showed that the patient' HRQoL decreased associ-\nated with the poor adherence (Nazir, Hassali, Saleem, Bashir,\nTo the best of our knowledge, our study was the first to\naddress adherence to treatment in DM patients using the\nIndonesian version of the BMQ. This questionnaire is suit-\nable for DM patients as it meets minimum requirements for\ntest reliability and validity. Systematic review about valida-\ntion of questionnaires to measure patients' adherence in\nhypertensive patients showed the results of internal validity\nthere were no construct validity reported of BMQ in the sys-\ntematic review (P\u00e9rez-Escamilla et\npresents the good value of Cronbach's  and acceptable val-\nues of convergent and discriminant validities.\nThe limitation of our study was the small sample size and\nwe only recruited outpatients of DM. We also cannot gener-\nalize our findings to all DM patients due to the exclusion\ncriteria in our study which could not find in the medical\nrecords. We have conducted the interview training to all\nresearchers involved in this study; however, we cannot stan-\ndardize the information which should be deeper explored to\nthe patients. For further research, we propose intervention\nfrom pharmacists, psychologists, nurses, and physicians as a\nhealth care team to work together to improve patients'adher-\nence to treatment in outpatient and inpatients situation.\nConclusion\nOur study concluded that the quality of care, sex, and age\nmay predict patients' adherence and quality of life.\nFurthermore, there are positive correlation between patients'\nadherence and quality of life.\n"
