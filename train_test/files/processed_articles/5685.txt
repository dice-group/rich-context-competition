    "abstract": "Abstract\nA new generation of environmental satellites, the Sentinels, has recently been launched by the European Space Agency\n(ESA). Part of ESA's Copernicus Programme, the sentinel mission has adopted an Open Data policy which intends to\nmake different levels of data freely available via an online data hub. Sentinel data will support applications including land\nmonitoring, emergency management and security and will thus form the evidence-base for a wide-range of local, regional,\nnational and international decisions, from individual insurance claims to humanitarian interventions. By providing ever\nmore data streams for monitoring and managing the planet, the sentinels institute a novel mode of visibility in terms of\nresolution, coverage and frequency. At the same time, they are co-constitutive of the increasing datafication of the\nenvironment. In the entwinement of heavenly gaze and data visions, I want to recover the work of `data fictions' in order\nto demystify notions of visibility and calculability associated with ``earth observation'' and trouble its unquestioned\npursuit of total monitoring.\n",

How to figure\nagency, recover subjectivities and disclose a space of con-\ntestation in environmental data streams? In 2008a\nnumber of disgruntled mycologists demonstrated how\nan open letter to GenBank, the world's largest DNA/\nRNA database, might be a good start (Bidartondo,\n2008). The issue that prompted it was (and remains)\nthat many of the database records for fungal sequences\nwere erroneously annotated, that is, the contextual infor-\nmation which ensures the intelligibility of sequence data\nwas inadequate.1 The signatories suggested the introduc-\ntion of open, collective annotation and while this\ndemand has not been met, the letter proved surprisingly\nefficient in other ways: It garnered an irate response from\nGenBank's host institution, the National Center for\nBiotechnology Information, elicited an editorial in\nScience as well as comments from a number of promin-\nent scientists and caused widespread debate about open-\ning Big Data resources for community editing.\nThe letter thus occasioned somewhat of an `infra-\nstructural inversion' (Bowker and Star, 1999), a\nmoment in which infrastructural matters are compelled\nto come to the fore. In relation to climate data Edwards\n(2010) has shown how such inversions can take the\nform of what he calls `data frictions', the resistance\nwhich arises from the habitual unpacking and re-packa-\nging of data as they travel across communities and plat-\nforms (see also Leonelli, 2009). I would contend that\ninversions and frictions also reveal something about the\ndata fictions that allow this trajectory to cohere within\ninfrastructures, and importantly, across interfaces,\ndomains and communities of practice. During a\nrecent workshop of the European Group on Earth\nObservations (GEO), a central struggle appeared to\nbe the articulation of a consensual imagination capable\nnot only of reconciling different types of data but of\nturning a corollary of issues (poverty, sustainability,\npublic health, food security, etc.) thinkable and\ndoable primarily through environmental Big Data.2\nBureau for troubles, Museum fu\n\u00a8r Naturkunde Berlin, Germany\nCorresponding author:\nTahani Nadim, Bureau for troubles, Museum fu\n\u00a8r Naturkunde Berlin,\nEmail: Tahani.nadim@mfn-berlin.de\nBig Data & Society\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav\nbds.sagepub.com\nCreative Commons Non Commercial CC-BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-\nNonCommercial 3.0 License (http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits non-commercial use, reproduction\nand distribution of the work without further permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages\n(https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\nAnd so it is with regard to data fictions that I find\nthe open letter to GenBank such an instructive episode.\nThe letter, a narrative device, variously discloses and\noccasions protagonists, histories, materials, interests\nand so prepares the ground for novel or other problem-\natisations (in this case conflicting understandings of\n`openness').3 In other words, it helps `unearth the\ndramas inherent' in data infrastructure (Bowker and\nand at times trouble the imaginaries that instruct the\nproduction, processing and distribution of data.\nMethodologically, this compels discussions about\n`making data global' (Edwards, 2010) to encompass\nquestions related to the workings and purchase of\ngenre, convention, sensitivity, aesthetic and rhetoric\nand invites a `diffractive' (Haraway, 1992) engagement\nthat reads data through its fictions. Because the ease\nwith which satellites have become sensible guardians\nof the environment tends to obscure questions about\nthe complexities, the labours and the differential visions\neffected by environmental Big Data.\nEnvironmental data fictions\nIn 2014, the European Space Agency (ESA) launched `a\nnew family of missions' entitled Sentinels in order to\nsupport the work of Copernicus, Europe's earth obser-\nvation programme (formerly known as the Global\nMonitoring for Environment and Security). The senti-\nnels will total 20 satellites, which will fly in constellation\n(as `twins') allowing more frequent revisits and the\ncreation of near real-time data (Showstack, 2014).\nTwo sentinel satellites have already been launched\nfrom Europe's spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana\nSentinel-1A, a high-resolution radar imaging mission\nwith a 5 -m ground range resolution, and Sentinel-2A,\na high-resolution optical mission with a spatial reso-\nlution from 10 to 60m. Sentinel-1s will provide observa-\ntions for applications covering ocean, seas and polar\nareas including oil spill monitoring, sea-ice monitoring,\nship traffic and routing, as well as for land applications\nincluding emergency responses and security. Sentinel-2s\nfocuses on land observations such as land cover and\nusage while also monitoring inland water and coastal\nzones, similarly providing data for emergency and secur-\nity services. In short, the sentinels' objective is `to manage\nthe environment effectively and help respond to the chal-\nThe ceaseless gaze of the new sentinels purports to\nput eyes on the environment as it encompasses all land\nand coastal areas between latitudes 84 north and 56\nsouth, from beyond the tip of Greenland to just beyond\nthe southernmost point of Chile. It covers all islands\ngreater than 100 km2, all islands in the European\nUnion, all within 20 km of a coastline, the entire\nMediterranean Sea and all inland water bodies and\nclosed seas. Specifically, the sentinel flies over and\nscans an area acquiring a continuous image that is\nreferred to as a `datatake'. The maximum length of a\nVanimo, Papua New Guinea). Because it is not possible\nfor a single earth observation station to cover this, so-\ncalled datastrips, portions covering 5,000 km of the\nimage, are downlinked to ground stations. These data-\nstrips form the basis for the Copernicus programme's\nenvironmental data. Data are provided on three levels\nfrom 0 to 2 where 0 means unprocessed instrument and\npayload data (at full resolution) and 2 indicating\nrefined measures such as surface wind speed. Data for\nSentinel-1A and Sentinel-2A are already available\nthrough the Sentinel Data Hub portal at scihub.coper-\nnicus.eu. The data hub gives access to what one com-\nmentator has termed, perhaps not so coincidentally, a\n`data explosion' as well as an `enormous dump of free\ndata' (Amos, 2014). It thus continues the decisive devel-\nopment of open remote-sensing (RS) data that began in\n2008 when the US Geological Survey's Landsat pro-\ngram (ongoing since 1972) made their data available\nfor free download.4\nEvidently then, the basis for effective environmental\nmanagement is an enormous continuous stream of near\nreal-time RS data. Sentinel-1s and Sentinel-2s alone\nwill provide about 3.4 terabytes of data per day,\nwhich will be instantaneously downlinked to ground\nstations before being released between 2 and 12 h\nfrom sensing. Most of the data will be made available\non an open and free basis online (with some security\nexceptions). In terms of coverage, data volume and\ndata dissemination, the sentinels represent a `new era\nin earth observation' (Showstack, 2014). And all this is,\n`literally, (. . .) for the benefit of mankind', according to\nJosef Aschbacher, who is responsible for coordinating\nESA's earth observation programme (quoted\nShowstack, 2014).5 Advocates for the sentinels and\nearth observation are adamant that the environment\ncan and should be made intelligible principally through\nBig Data produced by extremely expensive artefacts\nthat orbit the earth at a distance of approximately\nIf satellites (and the environmental data they gener-\nate) are the answer to environmental crises, then we\nmight do well to consider how this entrenches the ques-\ntion of how best to address environmental change. To\nput it differently, what is the shape and form of crisis if\nthe primary response impels the environment to\nbecome `utterly absorbed into data and data space, a\ndigital ghost in the machine' (Waldby, 2000: 7)? One\npossible figuration is that of war, which also provides\nan answer to the question of how satellites got there in\n2 Big Data & Society\nthe first place. Whether in the description of the\nLandsat programme as `civilian', the stress on strategic\nmeasures and `combating' environmental challenges, or\nthe drive for ever more penetrating and panoptic vision,\nenvironmental Big Data can appear close to the rhet-\noric of warfare. Yet in contrast to much environmental\nruination war is infinitely more sensible in that it has\npresent effects and follows recognisable conventions\n(e.g. soldiers, military hardware, bombings). That one\ncan at least grasp the condition of war and thus com-\nprehend it through an established set of fears, expect-\nations and knowledges emerges as a central argument\nin the accounts of the people of Chernobyl recorded by\nescapes the senses, comprehension and imagination is\n(radioactive) pollution and the long-term or far-away\neffects of environmental degradations.\nArtful accounting\nSentinels account for the environment by observing,\nmeasuring and modelling earth surface characteristics.\nIn relation to terrestrial sensing, these characteristics\nare indicative of different types of land cover formed\nby biophysical and biochemical patterns resulting from\nthe interaction of biotic and abiotic factors including\nhumans, climate, geology, soils, animals, fungi and\nplants. Parameters measured are, for example, leaf\narea index, chlorophyll and nitrogen as well as spectral\nproducts like `red edge' position and the normalised\ndifference vegetation index (NDVI), an index of photo-\nsynthetic activity. None of this is captured directly.\nInstead theories and models from one phenomenon\nsuch as reflectance or radiance are extended into the-\nories and models of another phenomenon such as\nas real or virtual (manufactured based on model simu-\nlations) observation though remains a critical uncer-\ntainty in the pursuit of Big Data environmental\n`Is it a piece of art or a satellite image?' the Copernicus\nwebsite asks of an image (Figure 1) produced by\nSentinel-2A. An article in The New Scientist discussing\nthe same image asserts that `Gustav Klimt would like it'\n(Firth, 2016). Looking at Figure 1 one is certainly per-\nsuaded to appreciate it aesthetically: a pretty mosaic of\nred, grey and black tiles. The caption, however, makes\nclear that this is not Jugendstil art but agricultural fields\nin Italy's Fucino valley imaged in false colour (here\nshowing the `red edge' where plants and chlorophyll\nshow in different red tones). The picture, then, is both\nart and satellite image and while such equivocacy high-\nlights the instrumental combination of imaging and\nknowing (e.g. Daston and Galison, 2007), it also trou-\nbles the logic according to which visibility, legibility and\ncalculability connect and proceed. It is not a matter of\ncourse that sensors apprehend digital numbers and pixel\nvalues beget data, which in turn become images that are\ncommensurable with environments. Sentinel data\nrequires continuous and habitual inverting: A recorded\nobservation has to `be translated into numerical terms\nFor Waldby, the digital ghost (in her case, the human\nbody) problematises any neat distinctions between the\nFigure 1. Sentinel-2A false colour image of Fucino Valley, Avezzano, Italy. Copyright Copernicus Sentinel data (2015)/European\nSpace Agency (ESA).\nvirtual and the real for it demonstrates how issues such\nas sex and `race' become re-materialized via data.\nSimilarly, the picture of the Fucino Valley is not quite\nreal, nor entirely virtual. It is hard to tell what might\nhave gone astray on the convoluted and laborious path\nof data processing: from dark signal and crosstalk\ncorrection, defective pixel restoration, de-convolution\nand de-noising, re-sampling and imagery compression\nto further resampling, orthorectification, masks compu-\ntation and additional imagery compression. The picture\nis more of a vision than a clear-cut observation. Yet\nconsequential data fictions are being woven that can,\nin the case of the Fucino valley, sensibly contain and\nrelate RS observations, biomass proxies, crop yield\nand acreage, per capita food demand, gross domestic\nproduct or population statistics. Thus transformed\ninto so-called `agricultural intelligence' (e.g. Atzberger,\n2013), remote-sensed crop monitoring can (and indeed,\nhas) become a staple in narrating the politics (and infra-\nstructures) of food security. But there is a lot which\nescapes sentinels: migrant workers and labour relations,\ntypes of fertiliser and pesticides used (and their long-\nterm environmental and public health effects), agricul-\ntural subsidies, futures traded on crop forecasts, or\nmycorrhizal entanglements. These omissions are not\nonly due to technical limitations but also connected to\nlimited imaginations about Big Data and environmental\ncrises. How do we read an image like the one shown\nabove? What, with reference to Waldby, are the consti-\ntutive dynamics between the real and the virtual\nand how can we grasp the similarities and differences\nthat matter?\nThe sentinels\nThe sentinel with the long gaze\nThe sentinel with the long gaze\nAnd the dugout was called\nCENOBITES\nThe sentinel with the long gaze the sentinel with the\nlingering gaze\nCome in the sow\nGuillaume Apollinaire, ``Cotton in your Ears'', 1918\nApollinaire's poem ``Cotton in your ears'' takes us\ninto the trenches of World War I where the sentinel\ncuts an odd figure. The poem, part of his\n(1980) collection, begins with an explosion accompa-\nnied by words set unto the page like artillery fire. On\nthe poem's second page, things have calmed as the\nletters settle into their grid until the shout of ``Come\nin the sow'' (perhaps a call sign bellowed into a field\ntelephone), all caps. It is then that the sentinel makes\nhis first appearance. Senses stifled by the crashing and\nthe screaming, still his gaze remains fixed on the\nadversary, enduringly unfazed. He is only interrupted\nby the strange sign informing us of this particular dug-\nout's name (`the tranquil cenobites') before returning\nonce more with his gaze long and lingering. The repe-\ntition of sentinel might not refer to the same but to\nmore of the same indicating the steady replacement of\nparts obliterated by war. The sentinel here is both\nwitness and guard in the midst of a type of warfare\nthat remote sensing technology, with its `surgical'\ngaze, is supposed to have rendered obsolete. Yet the\nspectre of some sort of war is not far when sentinels\nwatch the earth for the benefit of `mankind' amongst\nother satellite families that supply data for the navi-\ngation and guidance of missiles.\nFor one, the cycle of destruction and substitution\n(or, restoration) chimes with the logic of environmental\neconomics and its particular notion of ecosystem as a\nquasi-mechanistic functional unit defined primarily by\nits service provisions to (some) humans. Accordingly,\nruination of one environment can be offset by conser-\nving another. Earth observation satellites are important\ntools for such environmental book-keeping as well as\nfor tracking compliance with regulatory frameworks\nsuch as EU agricultural policy or for arbitrating land\ndisputes (Bartel, 2005). Next-generation environmental\nscience predicated on Big Data and the promises of the\n`fourth paradigm' (Hey, 2009), the discovery and col-\nlaboration in and from Big Data, expand this vision to\ninclude total surveillance of the planet. There is some-\nthing disconcerting about the level of urgency by which\na total monitoring of earth is made reasonable and\nnecessary. The not-so subtle conflation of military\nrationalism7 with earth observation efforts becomes\nmirrored in the militarisation of environmental protec-\ntion that is using military technologies and shoot-on-\nsight policies (Kelly and Ybarra, 2016; Peluso and\nWatts, 2001). Sentinels seamlessly merge environmental\nconcerns with securitization, capturing invasive popu-\nlations, human and vegetal alike. If environmental sci-\nence is configuring its infrastructures according to war\nscenarios, it begs the question of how exactly earth\nobservation constitutes its battleground. If earth obser-\nvation requires sentinels, that is, guarding soldiers\nthen what are the battle lines and who, exactly, is the\nenemy?\nDark data\nFor Serres global environmental perils such as climate\nchange signal a new kind of war, one in which nature\n4 Big Data & Society\n`brutally and without warning' imposes itself into `our\nschemes and maneuvres [sic].' (Serres, 1995: 3) The stakes\nof this war are greater than of any battle seen before: the\nEarth itself, humanity in toto. Anthropogenic means\nof mass destruction, from nuclear submarines to internal\ncombustion engines, have given rise to an entirely\nnew class of opponents: air, atmosphere, water and\nsoil. This transformation has gone, however, unnoticed\nas `history remains blind to nature.' (Serres, 1995: 7)\nHistory, however, was not entirely ignorant if we con-\nsider the armament of the atmosphere by toxic gas on the\nYpres front in 1915. For Sloterdijk this event marked `the\nintroduction of the environment into the battle between\nadversaries' and the `transition from classical warfare to\nditional security threat (think of `food security' or `water\nsecurity') or potential weapon warrants unyielding\nobservation.\nThe violence (`data explosion') and waste evoked in\nthe description of sentinel data is not trivial. They\nmatter as part of imaginaries conjured up in comments\nand technical descriptions, built into specifications and\ndata sheets, and reproduced in the shared conceptual-\nisations of models, standards and ontologies that govern\nthe earth observation project. Apollinaire's poem\nalludes to both the possibilities and the limits of repre-\nsentation when it comes to sensibly relaying what both,\nthe military and remote sensing community call ground\ntruth, actual conditions on the ground. But where the\ndata-take seeks calculated visibility, the poem deliber-\nately courts opacity. The materiality of the words, their\ntypesetting, speech patterns and semiotic modes refuse\nclear divisions between sensations and observations. In\ncontrast, the sentinels are meant to monitor without\npassion or prejudice the objective destructions wrought\nupon Earth. Their very deployment, part of an effort\nthat Serres likens to `general mobilisation', betrays the\ncoupling of immanent threat and indiscriminate appre-\nhensions that characterises a continuum of war and\nenvironment, to paraphrase Massumi (2009).\nTroubling sentinels\nA letter, as Simmel (1908) observed, enters a space of\nmany uncertainties once it leaves its writer. As it travels,\ninterception and manipulation are possible. Similarly\nvolatile is its reception by its addressee: Will they read\nits content the way the sender had meant it? Much the\nsame anxieties accompany environmental Big Data as\nthey are sensed, collected, assembled, relayed and dis-\nseminated. The sentinels and their data are used to\naccount for the environment and in doing so, they appre-\nhend the environment narratively. In other words, they\nmake certain stories possible. In this, the genre of crisis\nis popular as it suspends hesitations and allows a\nfrictionless alignment of environmental and security\nconcerns. It is important to trouble the self-evidence\nby which perpetual capture is a sensible response to\nunrivalled destructions of forms of life, many of which\nremain of course unseen by sentinels and their relatives.\nIn her reflections on Sputnik, the world's first satel-\n[1958]) diagnoses a troubling flight from earthly `speech\nand sound'. She writes that `it could be that we, who are\nearth-bound creatures and have begun to act as though\nwe were dwellers of the universe, will forever be unable\nto understand, that is, to think and speak about the\nthings which nevertheless we are able to do' (Arendt,\n1998: 3). The sentinels will stay with us for a while.\nData from the sentinels will find their way into deci-\nsions and policies that will have wide-ranging effects on\nlives, human and otherwise. That is why the expanding\nworlds of environmental satellites, their continuous\nstreams of data and their laborious rendering into\ndata products, what Gabrys (2016) calls `creaturing',\nrequire inventive problematisations. Critical engage-\nment must thus work on assembling a language `to\nthink and speak' about sentinels. This is not a question\nof how to escape their gaze but of crafting copious\nimaginaries that put them in their place and time.\n"
