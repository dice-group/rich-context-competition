Therefore, we\nconducted this study to assess medication\nliteracy status and to examine risk factors of\ninadequate medication literacy in a cohort of\noutpatients in China.\nPatients and methods\nPatients\nOutpatients from four tertiary hospitals\n(Xiangya Hospital of Central South\nUniversity, Second Xiangya Hospital of\nCentral South University, Third Xiangya\nHospital of Central South University, and\nthe People's Hospital of Hunan Province,\neach with > 500 inpatient beds) in\nChangsha, Hunan, China, were invited to\ninformed consent was obtained. We\nobtained approval from the ethics board of\neach participating hospital before the study\nbegan. The eligibility criteria for participa-\ntion were as follows the following: older\nthan 18 years, competent language commu-\nnication ability, mentally stable, and cur-\nrently taking at least one medication.\nExclusion criteria included the following:\ninpatients, engaged in health care-related\nwork currently or before retirement, men-\ntally unstable or major mental disorder, and\ncancer or other severe systemic diseases that\naffect participation.\nData collection\nDemographic and clinical data were\ncollected using structured interviews.\nMedication literacy was assessed using the\nChinese version of the Medication Literacy\nScale (MedLitRxSE). This scale was origin-\nally developed by Sauceda et al.9 from the\nUniversity of Texas at El Paso in the United\nStates.10 The scale consists of four case\nscenarios, with 14 items and a dichotomous\nscoring system (correct, 1; incorrect, 0). The\nmaximum scale score is 14; higher scores\nindicate greater medication literacy.\nAccording to the principle of calculation\nformula of the distinction degree, which is\nused in the educational statistics, the scores\nwere classified into three groups: inadequate\nliteracy (<4), marginal literacy (4\u00ad10), and\nadequate literacy (>10). We obtained per-\nmission from Sauceda et al.9 to translate the\nscale into Chinese and modified it to suit the\nChinese culture. The validity and reliability\nof the Chinese version of the MedLitRxSE\nhas been published elsewhere.11 In brief, the\nChinese version has validity and reliability\nequivalent to the original English version,\nwith internal consistency reliability (the\nThe confirmatory factor analysis indicated\noverall good model fit: the root mean square\nwas 3.06, Bentler's comparative fit\nindex was 0.94, and the goodness of fit\nData analyses\nArmonk, New York, United States) was\nused for all analyses. Descriptive statistical\nanalyses were used to analyse demographic\ninformation. We used t-tests, analysis of\nvariance, and the Kruskal\u00adWallis H test for\nthe univariate analysis. Logistic regression\nanalysis was used to analyse the independent\neffects of determinants of medication\nliteracy.\nResults\nA total of 465 outpatients were enrolled in\nthe questionnaires and were included in the\nfinal analysis.

Three factors\nshowed an independent association\nwith inadequate medication literacy. The\nrisk of inadequate medication literacy was\ngreater for older and unmarried patients,\nbut lower for those with more education.\nDiscussion\nOur study of a cohort of outpatients in\nChina showed that medication literacy was\npoor: only 30.8% of the study participants\nhad adequate medication literacy. Analysis\nby case scenarios revealed some disturbing\nfindings: about half the outpatients did not\nhave detailed knowledge of some aspects of\nmedication, such as dosage (50.2%), side\nWe found that older age (>55 years) was\nindependently associated with increased risk\nof inadequate medication literacy. This\nfinding is consistent with results from studies\nof other populations.12\u00ad14 As patients age,\ntheir cognition, learning, and memory abil-\nities deteriorate.15,16 Our findings indicate\nthat greater education is associated with\nbetter literacy. This is inconsistent with\nfindings from a report by Maniaci et al.7\nThis may be because we had a greater\npercentage of participants with low educa-\ntion than Mania et al.7 As a result, our study\nmay have greater power to detect the effect\nof education on medication literacy. Our\nfindings also showed that married patients\nhad greater medication literacy. We could\nnot identify any previous studies on the\nassociation between marital status and\nmedication literacy. We suggest that married\ncouples provide each other with support,\nwhich enhances their medication literacy.\nLack of medication literacy exposes out-\npatients to increased risk of re-hospitaliza-\ntion, emergency department visits, or\nserious consequences owing to adverse\nevents related to unsafe medication.15,17\nMedication literacy could be improved\nby patient education. Adequate and effective\ncommunication about medication between\nTable 3.

In addition, follow-up after discharge\ncould remind patients to pay more attention\nto their medication.\nOur study has several strengths. First, to\nour knowledge, this is the first study to\nexamine outpatient medication literacy in\nmainland China. Second, we identified sev-\neral risk factors of medication literacy,\nincluding unmarried status, which has not\nyet been identified as a risk factor in the\nliterature. Third, we used a validated tool to\nassess medication literacy.\nThis study has some limitations. First,\ndata were collected from four tertiary hos-\npitals in Changsha. Further studies are\nneeded to determine whether findings from\nthis population can be generalized to popu-\nlations in other parts of China. Second, the\nsample size was not sufficiently large, which\nprevented us from performing more refined\nanalyses, such as item-specific analysis, or\nexamining potential interactions among risk\nfactors.\nIn conclusion, we found that the medica-\ntion literacy in outpatients in China was\ngenerally low, and older age, lower educa-\ntion, and unmarried status were independ-\nent risk factors of inadequate medication\nliteracy. Although prescription drugs are\nregulated in China, enforcement of these\nregulations is often weak, and patients or\ntheir relatives can obtain prescription drugs\nsuch as antibiotics from local drug stores\nwithout a doctor's prescription. Therefore,\npatient education to improve medication\nliteracy is an important issue in mainland\nChina.\n"
